He grew up in a working-class family with 14 children. After studying business in school, he went to work in an office but found the white-collar environment too stultifying. Deciding that the only way out was to become an intellectual, he attended the for a time and was a supporter of Borduas' automatiste movement. He also made 8 mm amateur films, which landed him a job as picture editor in the news department of the CBC. After three short personal films that confirmed his talent, he was hired by the National Film Board (NFB) at what was the beginning of the candid eye movement in 1956. National Film Board His first film with the NFB was Les Raquetteurs (1958). Co-directed with Michel Brault, and including the important contribution of sound recordist Marcel Carri√®re it surpassed the candid eye approach, establishing for the first time in film history, the filmmakers in the midst of the ongoing event. Seeking a truthful relation to the captured film reality, sound is also captured live. The film, not devoid of comical aspects, is also seen as an important step in anthropological cinematography. It captures without judgement, a social phenomenon that would have seemed unimportant in its archaism and triviality (a snowshoe convention on asphalt!), thus revealing with documented distanciation elements of popular Quebec culture that were previously disdained. In 1961, Groulx's focus shifted from the crowd to the individual, with his short documentary, Golden Gloves. Voir Miami (1962) revealed Groulx's poetic side. Although it presents an indictment of contemporary America, it does so in a poetic, almost lyrical style. In 1964, Groulx turned to a highly social and political type of filmmaking, which would be characteristic of his work to the very end. The Cat in the Bag (Le Chat dans le sac), his first feature-length drama, is about coming of age: for the protagonists as they face difficult political choices, and possibly for the Quebec people as well. Not only did Groulx write and direct the film, he also did his own editing (as he would for all subsequent films). In his dramas, Groulx liked to film non-professionals who were the real characters in the story or who were very similar to them and could improvise within a given situation. Before undertaking another feature, Groulx made the documentary short Un jeu si simple (1965), a dramatic look at the sport of hockey in the province of Quebec, and in particular, the Montreal Canadiens teams of 1950-1960. This was followed in 1967 by the film ', a complex collage of images reflecting the daily lives of Quebeckers. Groulx questions their choice of lifestyle through an unconventional filmic language giving unprecedented importance to sound. Barraging the spectators with a disturbing mix of chanting voices, songs, quotations and advertisements from the mass media, the film is a protest against the consumer society, a denunciation of the dehumanizing mechanisms created and used by man against man. Continuing in this pamphleteering vein, Groulx made 24 heures ou plus, a veritable call to revolution, which was censored by the NFB. Shot at the end of 1971, the film was not officially released until 1977. In 1977, he directed the feature-length documentary Premi√®re question sur le bonheur, a Mexico- Canada co-production in which Groulx again questions the exploitation of man by man, but this time in the context of rural Mexico. In 1980, Groulx was involved in a serious automobile accident that put an end to his career, although he did manage to come back in 1982 and complete the feature film he had been working on. Au Pays de Zom is a scathingly funny satire on the businessman ethos in the unexpected form of a musical, in which Joseph Rouleau, an opera singer greatly admired by Groulx, plays the role not of a romantic hero but of a financier. Legacy Groulx's films are the work of a worried man perpetually questioning life and the world around him. Through them, he explored different aspects of Quebec society, always varying his style to suit the subject. He was one of the first Quebec filmmakers to make auteur films, both documentary and drama. Overall, it could be said that his films convey a Marxist philosophy with a Brechtian aesthetic. The Cat in the Bag (Le Chat dans le sac) (1964) remains his best known film and played a seminal role in the development of Quebec cinema. In 1985, the Government of Quebec presented Groulx with the Prix Albert-Tessier for lifetime achievement. Filmography =Fiction= *The Cat in the Bag (Le Chat dans le sac) (1964) *O√π √™tes-vous donc?

They developed from the middle of the 1st millennium BC to the early centuries of the 1st millennium AD. The languages are known almost exclusively from inscriptions, principally of Oscan and Umbrian, but there are also some Osco-Umbrian loanwords in Latin.  Relationship with the Italic languages  Following an original theory by Antoine Meillet, the Osco-Umbrian languages were traditionally considered a branch of the Italic languages, a language family that grouped Latin and Faliscan together with several other related languages.Francisco Villar, Gli Indoeuropei e le origini dell'Europa, pp. 474-475. However, this unitary scheme was criticized by, among others, Alois Walde, Vittore Pisani and Giacomo Devoto, who proposed a classification of the Italic languages into two distinct Indo-European branches. This view gained acceptance in the second half of the 20th century, although the exact processes of formation and penetration into Italy remains the object of research.Villar, cit., pp. 447‚Äì482.  Historical, social and cultural aspects  Oscan was one of the many languages spoken in the heart of the Italian peninsula, such as Umbrian and other languages belonging to the Sabine languages, such as Volscian, Sabine, South Picene, Marsian, Paeligni, Hernican, Marrucinian, Pre-Samnite and Sidicini. Aequian and Vestinian may also have been part of the group. They have traditionally been ascribed to either an Oscan group or an Umbrian group. However, they are all poorly attested, and such a division is not supported by evidence. It appears that they may have formed a continuum, with Umbrian in the north, Oscan in the south and the 'Sabellic' languages in between (see next section) having features of both.Rex Wallace, 2008, \\"Sabellian Languages\\", in Woodard, ed., The Ancient Languages of Europe, CUP, p 98 However, there were also colonies that spoke Oscan, scattered throughout Southern Italy and Sicily. Oscan was the language of the Samnite tribes, powerful enemies of the Romans, who took years to subdue them (the Samnite wars took place from 370 BC to 290 BC). These languages are known from a few hundred inscriptions that are between 400 BC and the 1st century. In Pompeii there are numerous Oscan inscriptions, such as dedications in public buildings and signs. Umbrian began a process of decline when the Umbrians were subdued by the Romans and the process of Romanisation led to its demise. Of all the Osco-Umbrian languages, it is the one that is the best known, mainly because of the Iguvine Tablets.  Distribution  These languages were spoken in Samnium and in Campania, partly in Apulia, Lucania and Bruttium, as well as by the Mamertines in the Sicilian colony of Messana (Messina).  Past usage  Sabellic was originally the collective ethnonym of the Italic people who inhabited central and southern Italy at the time of Roman expansion. The name was later used by Theodor Mommsen in his Unteritalische Dialekte to describe the pre-Roman dialects of Central Italy that were neither Oscan nor Umbrian. The term is currently used for the Osco-Umbrian languages as a whole. The word \\"Sabellic\\" was once applied to all such minor languages, Osco-Umbrian or not. North Picene was included, even if it has always been known to have been unrelated.  Classification  The Osco-Umbrian languages or dialects of which testimony is preserved are:Vetter, 1953; Adiego-Lajara, 1992; Rix, 2000. *Oscan, with spoken languages in the southern central region of the Italian peninsula, which includes: **Oscan is the best documented language of the group, along with other varieties that are poorly known and considered related to Oscan: ***Marrucinian ***Paeligni ***Sidicini *Umbrian, with languages spoken in the northern central region of the peninsula. **Umbrian **Marsian **Sabine **Volscian **Hernican *Picene-Pre-Samnite **South Picene **Pre- Samnite, a language documented in the south, but which seems to contain characteristics closer to South Picene than to Oscan. *Unknown **Aequian **Vestinian Little-documented variants collectively known as \\"Sabellic dialects\\" are ascribed without much evidence to the two main groups. Some authors doubt such traditional classification, placing, for example, Aequian and Vestinian in opposite branches, instead of grouping them together.Coleman, 1986  Linguistic description  The Osco-Umbrian languages are fusional inflected languages with about 5 different morphological cases in the singular, similar to those of Latin. = Differences from Latin = Although the Osco-Umbrian languages are far more poorly attested than Latin, a corpus of a few thousand words' worth of inscriptions has allowed linguists to deduce some cladistic innovations and retentions. For example, while Proto-Indo- European aspirates appear as b, d and h/g between vowels in Latin (medius < *med ∞yos), the aspirates all appear in Sabellic as f (Oscan mefiai). In addition, while Latin retained the Proto-Indo-European labiovelar series (\\"Q-Italic\\"), the Osco-Umbrian languages merged them with the labials (\\"P-Italic\\"): Latin quattuor, Oscan petora.

Peter Merkel is a villain of the original Flash. The second Rag Doll is an enemy of Starman. The third Rag Doll is the son of the original and a member of the Secret Six. Rag Doll made his live appearance on the fifth season of The Flash played by Troy James and voiced by Phil LaMarr. He returned in an episode of the sixth season. Publication history Rag Doll was first introduced as an adversary for the Golden age Flash in a story published in Flash Comics #36 (December 1942), created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Lou Ferstadt. In the Starman series, James Robinson revived the character, giving him a darker reimagining under the name Colby Zag. His son, Peter Merkel, Jr., most recently used his father's name as a member of the Secret Six. Fictional character biography =Peter Merkel= Golden Age Peter Merkel, a native of the Midwestern United States, was born with a unique condition, \\"triple-jointedness\\". Like the more common \\"double-jointedness\\", Merkel's condition was characterized by extremely extensible ligaments and tendons, though to a significantly extended degree. The son of a side-show barker, Merkel found work in a small local carnival as a contortionist and eccentric dancer. In the early 1940s, the carnival fell on hard times and Merkel found himself out of work. Wandering the streets, Merkel despaired of having money. Seeing large boxes of toys being loaded into a department store, Merkel hit on the idea of hiding himself in one of the large rag dolls and then robbing the store after closing. Going unnoticed among the toys, Merkel carried his idea one step further: He would rob while still hidden in the Rag Doll suit. In these earliest days of costumed villains, the idea seemed novel and Merkel decided that no one would believe that a Rag Doll could commit crime. In time, the legend of the Rag Doll grew far and wide. Petty crooks began to seek out the Rag Doll, to take advantage of his criminal success. In 1943, the Rag Doll moved his operation to Keystone City. There he had his thugs deliver him as a gift to a young heiress named Geralda Cummins. The young girl was holding a much-touted party for her circle of socialites and the Rag Doll aimed to take advantage of the situation. To coordinate the event, Cummins had selected Joan Williams who had recently begun a party and festival business. It was decided that each of the wealthy guests would donate $10,000 in defense bonds to serve as a prize in a treasure hunt. Whoever solved the hunt first, won the prize. Unknown to Joan, the doll Geralda had received as a gift was listening and planning a much different outcome. The next evening, the guests gathered to hear the reading of the first clue. As the guests departed, the Rag Doll signaled his thugs to follow them to the museum while he stayed to interrogate Joan Williams. His ploy was delayed however, by the untimely arrival of Williams' beau, Flash. While the Rag Doll remained in hiding, Williams and the Flash departed for the museum to provide the next clue. On their arrival, they were waylaid by the Rag Doll's thugs. While the Flash made short work of the henchmen, the Rag Doll himself drugged Joan with chloroform and stole the remaining clue. With these, he could find the treasure himself. With the henchmen wrapped up, the Flash returned to find Joan amnesiac from the chloroform and with no recollection as to the location of the bonds. Taking the first clue, the Flash then began to solve the puzzle at super-speed and intercepted the Rag Doll on the 4th clue, at a local aquarium. The Rag Doll got the jump on Garrick with a swift blow to the skull and dumped the hero into an aquarium containing a giant octopus. He then raced quickly back to the Cummins estate to solve the treasure hunt with the 5th clue. Meanwhile, the Flash came to and after a tussle with the octopus, hotly pursued the criminal. He arrived just in time to see the Rag Doll pull the defense bonds out of their hiding place in the Cummins' grand piano. Quickly, and literally, tying the villain in knots, the Flash returned the gift and carted the outlandish criminal off to the Keystone City Jail.Flash Comics #36. DC Comics. Silver Age Flash is reported to have had several other encounters with the Rag Doll over the years but none have been recorded. In the mid-1970s, the Rag Doll became a pawn in a rather bizarre series of robberies. After an encounter with the Thinker, the Rag Doll became brainwashed to commit crimes based on dolls. When the Flash intercepted the criminal, mundane \\"accidents\\" befell the elder speedster, undermining his self-confidence. The Thinker's plan was to destroy the Flash's self-esteem to the point that the hero would be too ineffectual to stop his grander plans. The Thinker was undone however, by a surprise visit from the Silver Age Flash, Barry Allen, who quickly captured the former carnival worker. Allen also noticed a bizarre aura around the heads of Garrick and Merkel, suggesting that each was being manipulated in some way. At Merkel's interrogation, the Rag Doll swore that he had no recollection of any crimes, convincing Allen that there was a greater force at work. Quickly switching Merkel for a real rag doll, he convinced Garrick and the Keystone police that a bizarre transmogrification had occurred and that Merkel was somehow dead. He then departed, only to return and hide in the evidence room when the Thinker himself paid a visit to confirm the demise of his agent. Caught red-handed, the Thinker was quickly apprehended by the two Flashes and both the Thinker and the Rag Doll were returned to prison.Flash Comics #229. DC Comics. Ragdoll in his Golden Age costume from Who's Who. In the early 1980s, the Rag Doll was contacted by the Ultra-Humanite, a long-standing foe of the Justice Society. Along with other elder villains as well as new younger recruits, the Rag Doll became a founding member of the second generation of the Secret Society of Super Villains. The Ultra-Humanite had devised a machine that, for the sacrifice of ten heroes from the Justice Society and Justice League to be held in stasis, (five from each team), all the heroes on Earth would disappear. Each villain then was assigned to dispose of his long-time nemesis and the Rag Doll took the Flash. After delivering a false tip to the Flash, the Rag Doll ambushed the hero on a freight ship in Keystone Harbor. After luring him into the hold, the Flash learned too late that all he would find there was a bomb, the explosion of which dropped the unconscious hero at the feet of his adversary. As the other members of the Secret Society completed their task, the heroes were dispatched to Limbo, clearing Earth of costumed heroes. Unfortunately, the Ultra-Humanite had deceived the Earth-One villains into helping, by telling them they had an equal chance of their Earth being purged of heroes. This was not true. The Earth -One villains were placed in Limbo, but, while the Rag Doll and his colleagues waged a massive crime wave, the villains rescued the captured heroes in Limbo. In short order, the Secret Society of Super-Villains were consigned to Limbo and the balance of heroes on Earth was restored.Justice League of America #195-197. DC Comics. Limbo would not prove a prison for the Rag Doll for long. While trapped there, the Ultra- Humanite made contact with himself in the past, when he occupied the body of Dolores Winters in 1942. Through the contact of advanced information, the Ultra-Humanite taught himself a way to open a portal to Limbo in the 1940s. On doing so, the Rag Doll and other members of the Secret Society escaped to assist the young Humanite defeat the All-Star Squadron. After a romp across the landscape of their youth, the aging villains proved no match for the large numbers of heroes and were beaten back to Limbo.All-Star Squadron #24-26, Annual #1. DC Comics. Modern Age By the late 1980s, the Rag Doll was well into his 60s. His hyper-elastic ligaments had begun to collapse and over- extend, causing the villain great pain. Using his persuasive speaking skills he learned as a circus barker, he gathered together a cult of followers which he used to initiate a crime wave in Opal City. Ted \\"Starman\\" Knight, unable to stop the madman, asked Justice Society of America members Green Lantern, Flash, Hourman, and Dr. Mid-Nite to assist him. The heroes thwarted Rag Doll's plans and captured the villain. Restrained, Rag Doll taunted the heroes, telling him that he would command his horde from prison. He threatened the lives of Jay, Alan, and Ted's families. While the JSA listened, Rag Doll managed to slip free of his bonds. In the confusion, Rag Doll was killed. It has since been largely concluded that Starman, fearing for the safety of his sons, had slain the villain, a fact disputed by witnesses Flash and Green Lantern. The next afternoon, Rag Doll's body disappeared from the morgue.Starman #9-11. DC Comics.Starman 80-Page Giant #1. DC Comics. Exactly how the Rag Doll survived is unknown. His body was retrieved by his followers. Some years later, Rag Doll was approached by the demon-lord Neron. In exchange for Rag Doll's soul, Neron restored the villain's youth and health and enhanced his flexibility. He also instructed Rag Doll to remain hidden until approached by a man named Simon Culp. Years later, Culp did come looking for Rag Doll's help. Trapped in the form of the Shade, Culp explained that he had a very profitable plan to launch against Opal City and the Shade. Rag Doll agreed to help.Starman #68. DC Comics. Rag Doll helped Culp's gang subdue Mikaal Tomas when the alien attempted to make contact with Ted Knight.Starman #64. DC Comics. Rag Doll watched as Culp cast a spell on the Black Pirate, causing Opal City to become encased in a shadow-dome.Starman #63. DC Comics. Rag Doll and his gang then helped Culp seize control of the entire city. The villains then paraded their prisoners, baiting Jack Knight into a confrontation. Jack held his own until, cut off from the stars, his cosmic rod failed. As Rag Doll and the villains beat Jack down, the Shade fell to the ground as Culp emerged from within his shadow form.Starman #65. DC Comics. Just as Culp was about to slit Knight's throat, Adam Strange and Black Condor attacked. Their distraction enabled Knight to fight his way free. The three heroes freed Culp's prisoners, and escaped. Culp and his gang remained in custody of the Shade however, and withdrew to prepare for the final rite.Starman #67. DC Comics. While Culp prepared, he sent Mist, Solomon Grundy, Rag Doll, and Crusher to search for the escaped heroes Starman #69 Ted confronted Doctor Phosphorus in the streets of Opal and, no longer needing to be cautious of his health, fought the villain toe-to-toe. Ted defeated his radioactive foe, but as he was about to deliver a killing blow, he was ambushed by the Rag Doll.Starman #70 Phosphorus quickly recovered and the two villains closed in on Knight. As they moved in for the kill, Ted used his cosmic rod to tear the pavement from beneath Dr. Phosphorus and drive him into the earth, killing the villain. With that, the rod's charge was exhausted. Ted turned to face Rag Doll, challenging the villain to kill him, sparing him a suffering death from Phosphorus' radiation poisoning. Rag Doll then turned and left.Starman #71. DC Comics. Rag Doll was then recruited to join a new version of the Injustice Society. He helped rescue the Icicle from incarceration, leading to a showdown with the JSA. In the ensuing battle, the Injustice Society used strange discs to teleport the elder JSAers away. Their mission accomplished, the Injustice Society disappeared.JSA All-Stars #1. DC Comics. He then briefly rejoined a reformed version of the Secret Society. During an assault against the Secret Six, he battled his son (who had taken over the Rag Doll name and identity). Their battle was cut short by other attacking villains.Villains United #5-6. DC Comics. Soon afterward, Rag Doll died while on a mission with the reformed Injustice Society (JSA Classified #5-7). The team was attempting to retrieve the Cosmic Key (which would return Johnny Sorrow), but they were betrayed by the Society. In the midst of the battle, it appeared as if that Rag Doll and the Gentleman Ghost betrayed their comrades and ran away with the Key. However, Tigress witnessed the return of Johnny Sorrow whose sudden emergence killed Rag Doll, although Gentleman Ghost was prepared for it as he handed Sorrow his all-important mask. Sorrow and the rest of the Injustice Society escaped to safety in the Crooked House, the former abode of Prometheus. It was then revealed that Gentleman Ghost, Wizard and Icicle were expecting Rag Doll to turn on them, so they set him up to die. The New 52 In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Peter Merkel has been incarcerated in Arkham Asylum. Merkel first appears as one of the many inmates attempting to escape in a riot.Batman: The Dark Knight (vol. 2) #1. DC Comics. Merkel later takes part in the Arkham War.Forever Evil: Arkham War #1-6. DC Comics. =Colby Zag= Jack Knight has also squared off against a mentally unbalanced impostor named Colby Zag. created by James Robinson. During the time when the original Rag Doll was believed dead, Zag met band player Mr. Tyrell through the internet. Tyrell had bribed his former bandmates to keep quiet about his involvement in a drug related death. Eventually, his bandmates began extorting more money from him, so Tyrell planned to kill them. He helped Zag adopt the personality and mannerisms of the Rag Doll and sent him to kill the extortionists. Zag succeeded in killing four of the five men, but was stopped thanks to the intervention of Jack Knight.Starman 80-Page Giant #1 =Peter Merkel, Jr.= Peter Merkel has a son named Peter Merkel Jr. who also operated as Rag Doll. Ragdoll's other children Besides his son, Peter Merkel stated to Icicle that he had many other children. This seems backed up by Peter Merkel Junior's mention of having a triple-jointed brotherSecret Six #1. DC Comics. and the recent appearances of his daughter Alex, a.k.a. Junior.Secret Six #5-7. DC Comics. Along with his children, Rag Doll also had his cult followers who all apparently committed suicide while blowing up their house. Powers and abilities Rag Doll is a master contortionist and, in later years, successful hypnotist through oratories he delivers. His body is absorbent enough to withstand concussive forces capable of rendering most human individuals unconscious. He is an adequate marksman and typically relies on the element of surprise. He is a skilled thief, and augments his stealth with his ability to hide in unexpected places where a human normally could not place themselves. In other media Rag Doll as appeared in The Batman. * Rag Doll appears in The Batman episode \\"Ragdolls to Riches\\", voiced by Jeff Bennett. Able to bend himself into every imaginable position and withstand being wholly crushed, Rag Doll is a formidable opponent for Batman and Catwoman. His fighting style includes swinging his arms and legs lazily at his opponent, and also bending in different positions when attacking or dodging. In \\"Team Penguin\\", Rag Doll is among the villains that help out Penguin in his latest crime spree. When Penguin forms his team of villains, Rag Doll suggests they call themselves \\"Villains United\\". * The Peter Merkel version of Rag Doll appeared in The Flash episode \\"All Doll'd Up\\", portrayed by contortionist Troy James and voiced by Phil LaMarr. This version is an African-American criminal who was \\"crushed, snapped, and broken\\" by shrapnel from the Thinker's Enlightenment Satellite. This gave Merkel the ability to contort himself in nightmarish ways as he started targeting people's most treasured items. When he attacks Barry Allen with power-dampening cuffs, Iris is able to get the cuffs off of him in time while Merkel is defeated by Ralph Dibny, who literally swallows the criminal to suffocate him into submission. While Cisco Ramon gives Merkel the name \\"Rag Doll\\", Dibny states that Rag Doll is being remanded to Iron Heights. Rag Doll returns in \\"Gone Rogue\\", where he teams up with Brie Larvan, Weather Witch, and XS for a heist at McCulloch Technologies. After the rest of the team turns on XS, they fight Team Flash with Rag Doll apprehended by Iris and Joe West. In the episode \\"So Long and Farewell,\\" Black Hole member Joseph Carver hires Rag Doll to target Joe West. The first attack had him cutting the brakes to Joe's car which Joe bailed from. The second attack in the Central City Police Department had Rag Doll giving Joe a shoulder wound while springing Sunshine from police custody in the process. The third attack involved capturing Cecile Horton and having her placed on a motion bomb. Taking advantage of the pipes that Rag Doll was in, Flash banged them until Rag Doll came out enough to place the power-dampening cuffs on him.

The word cantonment, derived from the French word canton, meaning corner or district, refers to a temporary military or winter encampment. For example, at the start of the Waterloo campaign in 1815, while the Duke of Wellington's headquarters were in Brussels, most of his Anglo‚Äìallied army of 93,000 soldiers were cantoned, or stationed, to the south of Brussels.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Eleventh Edition Waterloo Campaign In India and other parts of South Asia a cantonment refers to a permanent military station. In United States military parlance, a cantonment is, essentially, \\"a permanent residential section (i.e. barracks) of a fort or other military installation,\\" such as Fort Hood. List of permanent cantonments =Afghanistan= The former Sherpur Cantonment in Kabul, Afghanistan, which was the site of the Siege of the Sherpur Cantonment (1879) in the Second Anglo-Afghan War (1878‚Äì1880), is now maintained as a British Army cemetery. =Bangladesh= In Bangladesh, cantonments are residential quarters for many military personnel aside from soldiers. These individuals include officers, teachers, military doctors, military nurses, junior commanding officers, and non‚Äìcommissioned Officers. A wide variety of military training is provided in the Bangladeshi cantonments: *Alikadam Cantonment, Bandarban *Bandarban Cantonment, Bandarban *Bangladesh Military Academy, Chittagong *Chittagong Cantonment, Chittagong *Comilla Cantonment, Comilla *Dhaka Cantonment, Dhaka *Dighinala Cantonment, Khagrachari *Halishahar Cantonment, Chittagong *Jahanabad Cantonment, Khulna *Jahangirabad Cantonment, Bogra *Jalalabad Cantonment, Sylhet *Jamuna Cantonment, Tangail *Jessore Cantonment, Jessore *Kaptai Cantonment, Kaptai *Khagrachari Cantonment, Khagrachari *Kholahati Cantonment, Dinajpur *Majhira Cantonment, Bogra *Mirpur Cantonment, Dhaka *Mymensingh Cantonment, Mymensingh *Padma Cantonment, Shariatpur *Postogola Cantonment, Dhaka *Qadirabad Cantonment, Natore *Rajendrapur Cantonment, Gazipur *Rajshahi Cantonment, Rajshahi *Ramu Cantonment, Cox's Bazar *Rangamati Cantonment, Rangamati *Rangpur Cantonment, Rangpur *Saidpur Cantonment, Rangpur *Savar Cantonment, Dhaka *Shahid Salahuddin Cantonment, Ghatail =Bhutan= The Indian Army maintains a training mission in Bhutan, known as the Indian Military Training Team (IMTRAT) which is responsible for the military training of the Royal Bhutan Army (RBA) and Royal Bodyguard (RBG) personnel. All RBA and RBG officers are sent for training at the National Defence Academy and the Indian Military Academy. Moreover, Project Dantak, a division of the Indian Border Roads Organisation and subdivision of the Indian Army Corps of Engineers, was established in Bhutan on 24 April 1961, with its first commanding officer, Colonel TV Jaganathan. Project Dantak has since been responsible for the construction and maintenance of more than \`\` of roads and bridges, Paro Airport, a disused airfield at Yongphulla Airport, heliports, and other infrastructure. These serve India's strategic defence needs, but also provide economic benefits for the Bhutani citizens. =British India= Several cities among the Indian subcontinent, such as Ahmedabad, Ambala, Belgaum, Bangalore, Danapur, Jabalpur, Kanpur, Bathinda, Delhi, Meerut, Pune, Peshawar, Ramgarh, Rawalpindi, Sialkot, Secunderabad, and Trichy, contained large cantonments of the former British Indian Army, with Meerut and Ramgarh being two of the most important cantonments in northern India, second only to the headquarters at Rawalpindi. Meerut was established in 1803 and for 150 years was the largest cantonment in the region. Although cantonments in India were considered to be semi-permanent in the 18th and 19th centuries, by the turn of the 20th century they had transitioned to being permanent garrisons. They were further entrenched as such, via the military reforms of Lord Kitchener in 1903, and the Cantonments Act of 1924.Sheikh, M.

Lee Man-soo (, Hanja: ÊùéËê¨Ê¥ô; born September 9, 1958 in Cheorwon, Gangwon-do, South Korea), also spelled as Man Soo Lee, is a former Korea Professional Baseball catcher and First baseman and manager. After a distinguished career as a professional player in South Korea from 1982 to 1997, Lee moved on to coaching in 1998, including positions on the coaching staff of the Chicago White Sox, and came back to South Korea in 2006 to serve as a bench coach for the SK Wyverns. Playing career Upon graduation from Hanyang University in 1982, Lee made an agreement with the Korea Baseball Organization to play for one of the new pro league's teams instead of remaining in the amateur league. Prior to the inaugural Korean professional baseball season, Lee was finally signed by the Samsung Lions. In the first game of the KBO pro league on March 27, 1982, Lee hit the first home run in Korean professional baseball history against the MBC Chungyong. Lee was a regular catcher of the Lions during the 1982 season and helped his team to reach to the inaugural Korean Series, where the Lions lost to the OB Bears, 4‚Äì1‚Äì1. Lee, nicknamed \\"Hulk\\" and \\"Babe Ruth of Korea\\" for his power and home run ability, was a full-time catcher and first baseman for 16 seasons with the Samsung Lions, hitting 252 home runs and knocking in 861 RBIs during his career. In 1983, he won his first home run title and was named league MVP, and the next year became the league's first triple crown winner as the leader in three major offensive categories ‚Äï home runs (23), runs batted in (80) and batting average (.340). His home run and RBI totals also led the league in 1985. Gold Gloves came in 5 straight years, 1983‚Äì1987, and he appeared in 12 All-Star games. Lee's ultimate career home run total, 252, remained the record until Chang Jong-hoon of the Hanwha Eagles hit his 253rd on May 23, 1999.  Coaching career  After retiring in 1997, Lee began his coaching career in the United States as the hitting coach for the Class A Kinston Indians in 1998. He moved to the White Sox organization in 1999, and served as the first base coach for the White Sox AAA affiliate Charlotte Knights until assuming his bullpen position with the big club in 2000. From 2000 to 2006, Lee was a coaching staff for the Chicago White Sox, the first Korean to coach in the major leagues. In 2005, as a coach for the White Sox, he earned a World Series ring following the 2005 World Series. After the 2006 season, Lee returned to South Korea and signed a two-year contract with the SK Wyverns as the club's bench coach on October 30, 2006. On August 18, 2011, SK Wyverns manager Kim Sung-keun was sacked following his decision to retire from coaching after the 2011 season. Kim's dismissal came just one day after the 68-year-old manager announced his decision to step down from his post at the end of the season, and Lee was named interim manager of the Wyverns on the same day.

RailTel was formed in September 2000 with the objective of creating nationwide broadband, telecom and multimedia network, to modernise train control operation and safety system of Indian Railways. RailTel's network passes through around 5,000 stations across the country, covering all major commercial centres. History The Indian Railways (IR) was initially solely dependent on the Department of Telecom (now BSNL) for their control and administrative communication circuits. To increase circuit efficiency, the Railways began building up its own communication systems from early 1970s based on overhead telephone lines, quad cables and microwave signalling. In 1983, the Railway Reforms Committee decided to introduce optical fibre cable (OFC) based communications in IR to provide safety, reliability, availability and serviceability through use of a dedicated network. The decision was also taken to create a network independent of the DoT and replace the existing microwave telecom systems (60% of which had reached end of life) with OFC. Indian Railways commissioned the first OFC on the Churchgate‚ÄìVirar line in Mumbai in 1988 for train operation and control purpose, which consisted of 60 km of network across 28 stations. The network was expanded in Central India with the commissioning of 900 km of OFC network in 1991‚Äì92 across Durg‚ÄìNagpur, Nagpur‚ÄìItarsi and Itarsi‚ÄìBhusaval sections of the Howrah‚ÄìNagpur‚ÄìMumbai line, and in Eastern India with the commissioning of 60 km of OFC network in Tatanagar‚ÄìChakradhrapur section of the same line. The second National Telecom Policy in 1999 opened the National Long-Distance segment under favourable licensing conditions with revenue sharing to assist mobile network operators to spread their networks across India. In 2000, the Government announced the formation of a telecom corporation to build a nationwide broadband multimedia telecommunication network. RailTel was established in September 2000 as a Public Sector Undertaking (PSU), wholly owned by the Indian Railways.Rural Broadband Connectivity Provider in India  RailTel Projects =Wi-Fi and WiMax= RailTel, in collaboration with Google, provides free WiFi access at selected railways stations across India.

The film was directed by Alexander Hall and starred Jane Wyman, Ray Milland, Aldo Ray, and Tom Helmore. It is the story of a composer's wife (Wyman) who tries to make him (Milland) jealous, but the ploy backfires and leads to divorce. This film is a reworking of a stage play by Arthur Richman, The Awful Truth (1922), which was previously filmed under the title in 1925, 1929, and 1937. The last version features Irene Dunne and Cary Grant in the leads. The lyrics for the musical numbers were written by Ned Washington. Plot Actress Connie Stuart tells her husband, composer Gary Stuart, that she spent an evening in a country inn with rival composer Courtney Craig. He accuses her of infidelity. She, in turn, accuses him of adultery with dancer Lilly Adair. The couple divorce. Several weeks pass as the couple waits out the 60-day period for the divorce decree to be final. One day, Gary goes to Connie's apartment to speak to her about retrieving his piano, as a hole must be cut in the wall to get it out. He discovers she has agreed to appear in Courtney's new play. Her performance draws the attention of uranium mining millionaire Frank McGraw, and they begin dating. Gary, jealous of Courtney but unwilling to admit he still loves Connie, bribes his piano movers to take their time so that he can repeatedly visit Connie. Gary's brother, Chet, tells Gary that Connie is seeing the miner Frank, not the playwright Courtney. Gary spends the night at Connie's, composing a song for her in an attempt to win her back. When Frank shows up at dawn and sees Gary at Connie's, he assumes Connie is two-timing him. Gary's new musical is a hit, but he is morose without Connie as the star. Chet tells him that Connie's claim about spending the night with Courtney in a country inn was a fabrication designed to make Gary jealous. Deciding to marry Connie to get her away from Gary, Frank goes to Connie's apartment to propose. Courtney attempts to prevent the engagement; he arrives before Frank, but Connie shoos him into the bedroom. Gary shows up moments later, furious to find Courtney there. Frank arrives to propose marriage, while Gary and Courtney fight in the bedroom. Frank withdraws his proposal of marriage and dumps Connie when he finds the two men exchanging blows. After finding Courtney at Connie's, Gary remains convinced Connie committed adultery. He now begins dating socialite Deborah Randolph. Connie finally gets Gary to come to her apartment to get the piano out. While there, Gary telephones Deborah. Connie attempts to interfere in their relationship by singing a romantic song. Deborah overhears the woman's voice, and Gary claims that it is his sister doing the singing. \\"Gary's sister\\" then dupes Deborah into hosting a party for Gary and inviting her. Connie shows up at the party in a fashionable gown and sings for the guests. Deborah, realizing that \\"Gary's sister\\" is really Connie, tells Gary to go back to his wife. Gary realizes he was a fool to show interest in Lilly Adair. With only minutes before the divorce decree goes into effect, Connie admits she has always been faithful and Gary pledges renewed fidelity to her. They embrace and resume their marriage.

(1994).  Explanation  In developing the theory of archaeology of knowledge, Foucault was trying to analyse the fundamental codes which a culture uses to construct the episteme or configuration of knowledge that determines the empirical orders and social practices of each particular historical era. He adopted discontinuity as a positive working tool. Some of the discourse would be regular and continuous over time as knowledge steadily accumulates and society gradually establishes what will constitute truth or reason for the time being. But, in a transition from one era to the next, there will be overlaps, breaks and discontinuities as society reconfigures the discourse to match the new environment. The tool is given an expanded role in genealogy, the next phase of discourse analysis, where the intention is to grasp the total complexity of the use of power and the effects it produces. Foucault sees power as the means for constituting individuals‚Äô identities and determining the limits of their autonomy. This reflects the symbiotic relationship between power (pouvoir) and knowledge (savoir). In his study of prisons and hospitals, he observed how the modern individual becomes both an object and subject of knowledge. Science emerges as a means of directing and shaping lives. Hence, the modern conception of sexuality emerges from Christian codes of morality, the science of psychology, the laws and enforcement strategies adopted by the police and judiciary, the way in which issues of sexuality are discussed in the public media, the education system, etc. These are covert forms of domination (if not oppression), and their influence is to be found not only in what is said, but more importantly, in what is not said: in all the silences and lacunae, in all the discontinuities. If one idea is discussed, then it is not discussed, whose interest is served by this change?  References  *Foucault, M. The Order of Things: An Archaeology of the Human Sciences.

Malmquist was a student of Carl Charlier at Lund and became one of the best known members of the so-called \\"Lund school\\" in statistical astronomy. His work in that field led, among other things, to his observation of the Malmquist bias. As professor at the Uppsala Astronomical Observatory he got interested in Schmidt telescopes and took the initiative, together with √Öke Wallenquist, to get a large Schmidt telescope installed at Uppsala University's Kvistabergs Observatorium (Kvistaberg Observatory, 1964), at the time one of the largest Schmidt telescopes in the world with a mirror of 135 cm and a corrector plate of 100 cm. He also arranged for the university to construct a Schmidt telescope and build a dome at Mount Stromlo in Australia in 1956, \\"The Uppsala Southern Station\\".

Kuitun is located between Wusu and Shihezi on the railway from √úr√ºmqi to Kazakhstan, close to a desert. The city was historically associated with the 7th Xinjiang Agriculture Construction Division (), which had run it until 1975, and still continues to administer the city's Tianbei New Area. Local industries include food processing and textile industries, as well as Kuitun Power Plant. Name The name of Kuytun () was from the Mongolian language, meaning extreme cold (). The name of Kuiteng (), which firstly appeared in the official historical book History of Yuan (), was the present Kuytun River. According to legend, in the period of Mongolian Westward Expansion, Genghis Khan' troops once stationed in the place, when it was very cold in winter, his soldiers shouted \\"Kuitun\\", since that time, the place was named after Kuytun. History At the latest in the 3rd century BC (Qin dynasty), the Saka people appeared in the place of present Kuytun area. This was followed by the Great Yuezhi people and then the Usans. Kuytun was part of Protectorate of the Western Regions (59 BC) in the Han period. During the period of the Jin, Sixteen Kingdoms and Northern and Southern dynasties, it was part of Ruipan State (), then that was followed by the Northern Wei, Rouran and then the First Turkic Khaganate. It was the territory of Tyueles () in Western Turk in the Sui period and of Kunling Commandery () in the Tang period. It was part of Toquz Oghuz () and it was followed by Liao State in the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. The place was within the territory of Mongol Qurzh () in the period of Genghis Khan (1206 - 1227), and as part of the fiefdom of Chagatai Khan' Descendants () between 1306 - 1330. As the pastureland of Oirats (), it was under the administration of Kurkalawusu () of Dzungars in the Qing period. When Xinjiang Province was found in 1884, the army camps () and fortress () in the province were changed into military posts (), Kuytun Post () was one of that in those days. The territory was Kuytun Divion (Kuitunzhuang, ), one of nine divisions in Wusu County () in 1913. In 1945, Wusu County was divided into four minggans (administrative Division below the county, ), Kuytun was one of that. The minggan of Kuytun had five centenarii () of Kuytun (), Bayingou (), Jiujianlou (), Huanggong () and Bashisihu () under its administration. The security police station () was found in Kuytun in 1948. In August 1950, the administrative division of minggan in Wusu County was transformed into a district, and a centenarii into a township. Kuytun was the 1st township of the 2nd district in Wusu County, and it had five unincorporated villages of Huanggou (), Tashikuitun (), Kalasu (), Diankuitun () and Kaiganqi () under its administration. In the further adjustment of administrative divisions in March 1954, Kuytun became the 1st township of the 1st district of Wusu County. In early 1957, The three townships of Kuytun (), Bashisihu () and Jiujianlou () were amalgamated into Xinfu Township (). In March 1957, the 7th Division of XPCC () moved its headquarters to Kuytun from Paotai (). In July 1958, Kuytun was incorporated to Karamay from Wushi County. On March 25, 1975, the XPCC was withdrawn, the 7th Division with agriculture and animal husbandry farms, and its owned industrial enterprises were devolved to the local administration. On August 29, 1975, the county-level city of Kuytun was approved to establish from Karamay by the State Council, and it was under administration of Ili Autonomous Prefecture. On September 10 of the same year, Kuitun City was officially established and the seat of Ili Autonomous Prefecture was moved to Kuytun from Yining. Based on agriculture and animal husbandry farms, and industrial enterprises owned by the 7th Division of XPCC, Kuytun Bureau of Farms and Land Reclamation () was incorporated in July 1978. Kuytun City and the Kuytun Bureau of Farms and Land Reclamation were implemented a team with two brands. The seat of Ili Autonomous Prefecture was moved back to Yining from Kuytun in October 1979. The XPCC was approved to restore in December 1981. Based on the Kuytun Bureau of Farms and Land Reclamation which was revoked, the 7th Division of XPCC () was restored in April 1982.

Battiato's songs contain esoteric, philosophical and religious themes, and have spanned genres such as experimental pop, electronic music, progressive rock, and new wave. He is and has been for decades one of the most popular singer-songwriters in Italy. His unique sound, song-crafting and especially his lyrics, often containing philosophical, religious, and culturally exotic references, as well as tackling or painting universal themes about the human condition earned him a unique spot on Italy's music scene, and the nickname of \\"Il Maestro\\" (\\"The Master\\" or \\"The Teacher\\"). His work includes songwriting and joint production efforts with several Italian and international musicians and pop singers, including the long-lasting professional relationship with Italian singer Alice. Together with Alice, Battiato represented Italy at the 1984 Eurovision Song Contest with the song \\"I treni di Tozeur\\".https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKmuFJEfkLM Biography =Early years and experimental period= After graduating from high school at the Liceo Scientifico \\"Archimede\\" in Acireale, and following the death of his father (truck driver and longshoreman in New York), in 1964 he moved first to Rome. Franco Battiato moved to Milan at age 22, and soon after won his first musical contract. His single, \\"La Torre\\", was released and Battiato appeared on TV to perform the song. He scored some success with the romantic song √à l'amore. After further covers of pop songs, he met the experimental musician Juri Camisasca in 1970 and collaborated with Osage Tribe, an Italian psychedelic-progressive rock band. As a solo artist, he released the science- fiction single La convenzione (The convention), one of the finest Italian progressive rock songs of the 1970s. Starting from 1971, Battiato devoted much of his efforts to experimental electronic music, producing a series of LPs that remained almost unknown at the time, but are now eagerly sought by collectors worldwide. Starting out with electronic progressive rock with some emphasis on vocals, his music became increasingly experimental, gradually moving into the realms of musique concr√®te and minimalism: Foetus (1971, its cover was censored), Pollution (1972), Sulle Corde di Aries (1973), Clic (1974) and M.elle le ‚ÄúGladiator‚Äù (1975). In 1975, he moved to the Dischi Ricordi label, producing Battiato (1975), Juke Box (1976) and the experimental L'Egitto prima delle sabbie (Egypt Before the Sands, 1977), which won the Stockhausen award for contemporary music. =National success= After the Ricordi label failed to re-sign him, Battiato signed with EMI. He abandoned the prog rock experiments of the previous years and moved to a more pop- oriented style which afforded him ever increasing popularity with Italian audiences. In this period his albums were usually in collaboration with the renowned musician and violinist Giusto Pio, whose two later albums were produced by Battiato. After L'era del cinghiale bianco (The Era of the White Boar, 1979). Patriots was released, and it was his first LP of the 80s. That album was successful enough to reach the thirtieth position on the charts. It contains a few songs which have become Battiato's classics, such as \\"Le Aquile\\" (The Eagles), and \\"Prospettiva Nevskij\\" (Nevsky Prospect). This new era of his music marks the beginning of his collaboration with the singer Alice and the violinist Giusto Pio. His following LP was \\"La Voce del Padrone\\" (His Masters Voice). He had even more success with this album than with \\"Patriots\\". His compositions sound both elegant, yet easy to listen to. This was the key to his growing fan base, of course. \\"La Voce del Padrone\\" contains many songs which became classics of Italian music. It stayed in the number one position for six months, becoming the first Italian LP with more than one million copies sold. His commercial success was confirmed by L'arca di No√® (Noah's Ark) in 1982. Songs such as \\"L'era del cinghiale bianco\\", \\"Prospettiva Nevskij\\" (\\"Nevsky Prospekt\\"), \\"Centro di gravit√† permanente\\" (\\"Permanent Gravity Centrepoint\\"), \\"Bandiera bianca\\" (\\"White Flag\\"), and \\"Voglio vederti danzare\\" (\\"I Want To See You Dance\\") established Battiato in Italy. Orizzonti perduti (Lost Horizons, 1983), which Battiato himself called a kipper, was followed by the successful Mondi Lontanissimi (Faraway Worlds, 1985), which featured a solo version of the popular \\"I treni di Tozeur\\" (\\"The Tozeur Trains)\\", originally a duet with Alice performed at the 1984 Eurovision Song Contest.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKmuFJEfkLM 1988's Fisiognomica (Physiognomy) sold more than 300,000 copies and it confirmed Battiato's success. The album, considered by Battiato himself his best work for the balance between music and lyrics, contained the hit \\"Nomadi\\" (\\"Nomads\\"), originally recorded by Alice and written by his old friend Juri Camisasca, who in the meantime had retired to a Benedictin monastery. The album also included the songs \\"E ti vengo a cercare\\", which was performed by director/actor Nanni Moretti in his 1989 movie Palombella Rossa, and \\"Veni l'autunnu\\" with lyrics entirely in the Sicilian and Arabic languages. In 2013 he signed a publishing deal with Roberto Mancinelli and Sony/ATV Music Publishing. =Collaboration with Manlio Sgalambro= Battiato in concert during the Notte Bianca 2007 in Rome He carried on making albums, mixing electronic and classical sounds. In the middle of the 90s he started a collaboration with the Sicilian philosopher Manglio Sgalambro, and most of the songs which were written in that period were really complicated, either in terms of the style or the text. However, the LP \\"L'imboscata\\", issued in 1996, contained \\"La Cura\\" (\\"The Cure\\"), one of the best songs he has ever written, based on its popularity. Afterwards, he explored rock with \\"Gommalacca\\" (1998), which contains heavier rock sounds in which electric guitars played a bigger role. In 1994 Battiato began to collaborate with the Sicilian philosopher Manlio Sgalambro, who was to write almost all the lyrics of his following albums. After the tentative L'ombrello e la macchina da cucire of 1995, in 1996 the duo published what is considered their best work so far, L'imboscata, containing the romantic hit \\"La cura\\" (\\"The care\\"), elected best Italian song of the year. Gommalacca (1998, with an unusual stress on hard rock), Ferro battuto (2000) and Dieci stratagemmi (2004) continued on the same path, with variations mainly set by Battiato's unceasing desire for musical experimentation. In 2003 Battiato released his first feature film, Perduto amor (Lost love), for which he also composed the soundtrack. The movie won the Silver Ribbon for the best debutant director. However, heavy criticism struck against his following movie, Musikanten, a rather experimental work about Beethoven's last four years of life. The German musician was played by the Chilean director Alejandro Jodorowsky. In November 2012 he accepted an offer from newly elected Sicilian regional president Rosario Crocetta to become the new Regional Minister for Tourism and Culture, announcing he will not take any compensation for the job, but was subsequently fired soon after his controversial claim that there were \\"troie in Parlamento\\" (whores within Parliament). =Later Career= Ten years later, he issued \\"Fleurs 1, Fleurs 3, and Fleurs 2, one after the other, in that specific order. They contained well-made covers taken from the most important Italian singers. He continued with his music, balanced between pop and electronic, until 2010. He had been touring with Alice for the whole of 2016, but in 2017 he held his last concert in Catania. He would have continued his work, but he had to give up for health reasons. At the end of 2019, his manager announced his definitive retirement from the scene.

He was a consultant to Dick Clark, advising him which records were popular in the African-American community. He went on to play the talents of emerging artists like the Temptations, Stevie Wonder and Michael Jackson over the radio. In the 1960s, Woods used the airwaves to talk about the American civil rights movement.

The Hettergouw at the lower Rhine in the Frankish Empire, named after the Hetware. The Chattuarii (or Attoarii) were a Germanic tribe of the Franks. They lived originally north of the Rhine in the area of the modern border between Germany and the Netherlands, but then moved southwards in the 4th century, as a Frankish tribe living on both sides of the Rhine. According to Velleius Paterculus, in 4 AD, the emperor Tiberius crossed the Rhine, first attacking a tribe which commentators interpret variously as the Cananefates or Chamavi, both being in the area of the modern Netherlands, then the Chattuari, and then the Bructeri between Ems and Lippe, somewhere to the north of the modern Ruhr district in Germany. This implies that the Chattuari lived somewhere in the west of Westphalia. Strabo mentions the Chattuari as one of the non-nomadic northern Germanic tribes in a group along with the Cherusci, the Chatti, and the Gamabrivii. (He also contrasted with other non nomadic tribes supposedly near the Ocean, the Sugambri, the \\"Chaubi\\", the Bructeri, and the Cimbri, \\"and also the Cauci, the Ca√ºlci, the Campsiani\\".) Strabo also notes them as one of the tribes who allied under the Cherusci and were made poor after being defeated by Germanicus. They apparently appeared at his triumph in 17 AD along with the Ca√ºlci, Campsani, Bructeri, Usipi, Cherusci, Chatti, Landi, and Tubattii. There is no consensus on any connection between the Chattuarii and either the similar-sounding Chatti or, less likely, the Chasuarii, who both lived in a similar region of Germany, and are also mentioned in Roman era texts. The Chattuari appear again in the historical record in the 4th century, living on the Rhine amongst the first tribes to be known as Franks. Ammianus Marcellinus reports that Emperor Julian, crossed the Rhine border from Xanten and... > ...entered the district belonging to a Frank tribe, called the Attuarii, men > of a turbulent character, who at that very moment were licentiously > plundering the districts of Gaul. He attacked them unexpectedly while they > were apprehensive of no hostile measures, but were reposing in fancied > security, relying on the ruggedness and difficulty of the roads which led > into their country, and which no prince within their recollection had ever > penetrated. Some of them (laeti) were also settled in France pagus attuariorum (French; Atuyer, comprising Oscheret at that time) south of Langres in the 3rd century. Under the Franks, the name of the Chattuari was used for what became two early medieval gaus on either side of the ride, north of the Ripuarian Franks, whose capital was in Cologne. The eastern side, they were near the Ruhr river, and across the Rhine they settled near the Niers river, between Maas and Rhine, where the Romans had much earlier settled the Germanic Cugerni. This western gau (Dutch: Hettergouw, German: Hattuarien) is mentioned in the Treaty of Meerssen, in the year 870 AD., p.74ff. The Chattuarii may also appear in the poem Beowulf as \\"Hetwaras\\" where they appear to form a league together with the Hugas (who may be the Chauci) and the Frisians to fight against a Geatish raiding force from Denmark. The Geats are defeated and their king Hygelac is killed, Beowulf alone escaping. According to Widsith, the H√¶twera were ruled by Hun.

It is also known as \\"prosector's wart,\\" because it was a common occupational disease of prosectors, the preparers of dissections and autopsies. Reinfection by tuberculosis via the skin, therefore, can result from accidental exposure to human tuberculous tissue in physicians, pathologists and laboratory workers; or to tissues of other infected animals, in veterinarians, butchers, etc. TVC is one of the many forms of cutaneous tuberculosis, such as the tuberculous chancre (which results from the cutaneous inoculation in immunocompetent people without previous exposure), and the reactivation cutaneous tuberculosis (the most common form, which appears in previously infected patients). Other forms of cutaneous tuberculosis are: lupus vulgaris, scrofuloderma, lichen scrofulosorum, erythema induratum and the papulonecrotic tuberculid. It was described by Ren√© Laennec in 1826.  Signs and symptoms  Because the TVC's entry point usually is the site of a trauma, wound or puncture in the skin (during an autopsy, for example), the most frequent site for the wart are the hands. But it can occur anywhere in the skin, such as in the sole of the feet, in the anus, and, in the case of children from developing countries, in the buttocks and knees. This is because children from countries of high incidence of tuberculosis can contract the lesion after contact with tuberculous sputum, by walking barefoot, sitting or playing on the ground. When recent, the skin lesion has the outside appearance of a wart or verruca, thus it can be confused with other kinds of warts. It evolves to an annular red-brown plaque with time, with central healing and gradual expansion in the periphery. In this phase, it can be confused with fungal infections such as blastomycosis and chromoblastomycosis. Cause  Diagnosis  The diagnosis is confirmed by a skin biopsy and a positive culture for acid-fast bacilli. A PPD test may also result positive.  Treatment  Therapy for cutaneous tuberculosis is the same as for systemic tuberculosis, and usually consists of a 4-drug regimen, i.e., isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol or streptomycin.

Life Born in Bath on 26 August 1790, he moved to Edinburgh in 1809 and worked there for over forty years as an actor, manager and dramatist. Around that time (1809), he married Anne Dyke, the sister of tragedienne Mary Ann Duff, but she died soon after the marriage.Joseph Norton Ireland (1882) Mrs. Duff, James R. Osgood and Co., Boston He managed the Theatre Royal by the \\"North Bridge\\", at first jointly with Henry Siddons (son of Sarah Siddons), then after 1816 on his own. He was the son of the actor and dramatist Charles Murray, and grandson of the Jacobite Sir John Murray of Broughton who, when captured after the Battle of Culloden, saved his life by betraying his fellow Jacobites then lived out his life in Edinburgh as a haunted and hated figure. Walter Scott's father as a lawyer had professional dealings with the old man, but on one occasion after his wife brought tea, he afterwards threw the cup out the window saying, \\"Neither lip of me nor of mine comes after Murray of Broughton's.\\" This incident may have later contributed to Scott's antiquarian interest in the family and friendship with William Henry Murray. 10 June 1818 saw the first performance of Murray's operatic adaption of Walter Scott's novel Rob Roy. It was titled \\"Rob Roy MacGregor\\". When Scott was preparing for the visit of King George IV to Scotland in 1822 he was quick to draw on Murray's expertise for the management of events. Murray created the settings at various venues, contrived the \\"revived ancient dresses\\" and arranged the \\"traditional\\" pageants. He was particularly acclaimed for his success in transforming the Assembly Rooms in George Street into a theatrical palace for the Peers' Grand Ball, an event that was pivotal in making the tartan kilt which had been thought of as the primitive dress of mountain thieves into the national dress of the whole of Scotland. The King's last and least formal public appearance during the visit to Edinburgh was at a theatre performance of Scott's Rob Roy adapted and produced by Murray. He died in St Andrews on 5 May 1852 and is buried against the eastern wall of St Andrew's Cathedral churchyard, backing onto the Eastern Cemetery.

During World War II, he was appointed as a coroner by the British Columbia Provincial Police in the town of Lillooet, British Columbia. In addition to coroner's duties he also served as effective general practitioner in the Lillooet area, including for the area's four wartime \\"self-supporting centres\\". Miyazaki's practice also included the Japanese Canadian internment camp at Taylor Lake. Towards the end of his life, Miyazaki was recognized for his services to the community, which included founding the local ambulance service and instigating a proper hospital for Lillooet, by being enrolled in the Order of Canada. Early life Miyazaki was born in the vicinity of Hikone City in Japan and moved to Canada in 1913 with his father. Graduating from the University of British Columbia in 1925, he was unable to pursue medical training in Canada due to laws preventing post-secondary study by Japanese Canadians and pursued study in the United States, at the Kirksville College of Osteopathy and Surgery in Missouri, graduating in 1929. Dr. Miyazaki received his licence to practise from the College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia but pursued further training in Los Angeles, ultimately opening an office in Vancouver in 1930. During his time in Vancouver he was active in Japanese Canadian community affairs, and served as treasurer of the Canadian Japanese Association from 1938 to 1941. World War II =Japanese Relocation= Bridge River hydroelectric townsite at South Shalalth - Closeup of hotel and residential area, 1940s. During wartime, the houses were occupied by relocated families, single men and some families. were housed in the semicircle of smaller buildings were barracks originally built for hydroelectric construction Following the attack on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese Empire on December 7, 1941, wartime paranoia led to the forced evacuation of Japanese and Canadians of Japanese ancestry away from the British Columbia coast to the province's interior and beyond to other provinces farther east. One of the sites chosen for these relocations was a semi-abandoned hydroelectric-development village at Shalalth (then known as Bridge River), one of them at East Lillooet in the Fraser Canyon, across the Fraser River from the town of Lillooet; Miyazaki was first relocated to Bridge River and then upon his appointment as coroner was moved to the town of Lillooet. Other sites in the area were at Minto City, McGillivray Falls. These were not fenced internment camps, like the infamous one at Tashme, and mostly included family groups who had been able to \\"buy\\" a better situation in the Interior, with some chance of work, although comings-and-goings were still regulated by police and permits. Many of the Japanese at the \\"Bridge River\\" townsite worked for the Pacific Great Eastern Railway and the cartage companies, while those at McGillivray Falls relocated to nearby Devine to work in a sawmill. At Lillooet, the presence of the Japanese helped keep the wartime merchant economy going, and the Japanese interest in market gardening helped rebirth the valley's small produce industry. =Coroner and Bush Doctor in Lillooet= One of the relocatees at Bridge River was Masajiro Miyazaki, a Canadian-trained osteopath whose practice had been thriving in Vancouver before the war. When the town of Lillooet's doctor died and a wartime replacement was not to be had to perform autopsies, the town's provincial costabulary recruited Miyazaki to act in the capacity of coroner. Special permits were created to allow him to stay in Lillooet instead of at Bridge River. This position quickly evolved into that of all-around town-and-country doctor, dentist and obstetrician, with patients throughout the whole region from Pemberton-Mount Currie to Pavilion and Lytton. Miyazaki's practice also included the Japanese-Canadian internment camp at Taylor Lake, northeast of 70 Mile House, a long distance away via the tortuous roads of the Fraser Canyon and the Thompson Canyon. His autobiography, My Sixty Years In Canada, contains many accounts of harrowing trips on mountain roads and rail lines in difficult weather and adverse conditions. =Miyazaki House= The Miyazaki House in Lillooet, British Columbia, which now serves as a museum. Miyazaki was invited to use as his surgery and residence Longford House, a late 19th-century manor near the main street owned by one of the town's oldest families (see Caspar Phair). Like many of the relocated Japanese in this district, Miyazaki stayed on after the war and became a major community leader during the 1950s, leading the campaign for a local ambulance service and proper hospital -- despite longstanding resistance from the provincial medical establishment over his qualifications, as he was only an osteopath and not a medical doctor. In 1983, after Miyazaki donated the property to the community when he left Lillooet that year, Longford House was renamed Miyazaki House . The house remains open as a heritage site for tours and still exhibits Miyazaki's office as he left it. His office still contains all original articles, including surgical instruments, medical texts, and skeletal displays. The house also has displays of local artwork and the history of the house before Miyazaki moved there. Order of Canada Towards the end of his life, Miyazaki was recognized for his services to the community by being enrolled in the Order of Canada, an honour shared by one of Lillooet's other notable citizens, Kansas-born Margaret Lally \\"Ma\\" Murray. His Order of Canada commendation reads: C.M. (Member) December 15, 1976 April 20, 1977 Miyazaki died of an infection in Kamloops, British Columbia on July 23, 1984.

Early life Kerr was born in St. Louis, Missouri, one of Richard J. and Anna (n√©e Tieman) Kerr's nine children. Kerr's father worked as a firefighter on rafts along the Mississippi. Prior to playing baseball, Kerr competed in amateur boxing. Kerr married Cora (nicknamed \\"Pep\\") Downing at age 21, on July 7, 1914. The couple remained married until Kerr's death in 1963. Kerr started playing baseball 14 alongside amateur adult baseball players. In 1909, Kerr and one of his brothers joined the Paragould Scouts in the Northeast Arkansas League. He played for lower level teams from 16 to 22, including the Cairo Egyptians and the Cleburne Railroaders. In 1917, he joined the Milwaukee Brewers of the American Association, then one of the top minor leagues, for whom he pitched 448 innings in two seasons. Professional baseball Buck Weaver and Clarence \\"Pants\\" Rowland recommended Kerr for the major leagues and the Chicago White Sox team. This happened during the \\"work or fight order\\" of World War I. At the time Dickey was about 5‚Äô7 and weighed 155 pounds. Kerr was living in the Fairbanks and Morse areas of Wisconsin, and working in a factory. Weaver was a mechanic at one of the other shops at the same factory. The owner of the Chicago White Sox at the time was Charles Comiskey, and the manager was Kid Gleason. Kerr played for the White Sox from 1919 to 1921. Eight of Kerr's teammates took bribes to throw the 1919 World Series against the Cincinnati Reds. They would forever become known as the Chicago Black Sox. These teammates were permanently banned from Major League Baseball after throwing the World Series against the Cincinnati Reds were Chick Gandil, Happy Felsch, Eddie Cicotte, Shoeless Joe Jackson, Lefty Williams, Buck Weaver, Fred McMullin, and Swede Risberg. Kerr was not involved in the scandal and won both of the games he started. Nevertheless, owner Comiskey refused to give Kerr what he believed to be a fair raise. Dickey held out for more pay before the 1922 season and refused to play. This resulted in a suspension from the White Sox. Kerr played exhibition games with other teams. This led to a suspension from the Major Leagues by Commissioner Kenesaw Landis. Kerr did not play Major League Baseball from 1922-24. Dickey returned to semiprofessional leagues. In 1925, Kerr made a short comeback to the major leagues, playing for the White Sox. Kerr had a 53‚Äì34 career record. From 1927-38, Kerr played for minor league teams before retiring from his playing career. =Coach= From 1927 to 1940, Kerr worked as a coach. He began with the Rice University (then Rice Institute) Owls. He coached in Washington and West Virginia before accepting a position in Florida. Kerr began managing the Daytona Beach Islanders in the year of 1940. His coaching led him to Stan Musial. Kerr told Musial, then beset by arm problems, to stop pitching and become a batter. Kerr's mentoring may have helped Musial attain his later success. Musial smacked career 3000 hits. In 1958, right before Musial's batting accomplishment, Kerr was working for an electric company. Musial gave Kerr a house for his birthday. He purchased the home for somewhere around $10,000‚Äì$20,000, from his income of around $100,000. Kerr lived there until his death in 1963.  Legacy  Writer Jim Baker noted that of the thirteen principal members of the 1919 White Sox, only Kerr and Nemo Leibold neither were banned for life nor were selected for the National Baseball Hall of Fame.Jim Baker, \\"Ray Schalk\\", published in Kerr is not eligible for the Hall of Fame under the Hall's current rules, which require a player to have played in at least ten major league seasons (Kerr played in only four). Although Kerr was never inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame, his accomplishments received recognition. He \\"received the inaugural Tris Speaker Memorial Award from the Houston Chapter of the Baseball Writers Association of America\\", an award given to athletes, and baseball officials that have made some sort of exceptional contribution towards the game. He received Houston's key to the city during a night honoring him in 1961 at Busch Stadium. A statue was dedicated to him at the Astrodome after his death. Kerr lost his fight with cancer and died May 4, 1963, and he is buried in Houston, Texas at the Forest Park Lawndale Cemetery. Kerr's friend Stan Musial attended the Second Annual Old Timers' Game in honor of Kerr. His statue since has changed locations a few times. The bronze statue of Kerr started at the Astrodome and was last on display at Constellation Field. Its last known keeper was the Finger Family, and their curator Tom Kennedy. In the 1988 film Eight Men Out, about the Black Sox scandal, Kerr was portrayed by actor Jace Alexander. The film inaccurately portrayed Kerr as a right-handed pitcher when in fact he was a lefty.

The word Shalalth (pronounced Sha-LATH and spelled Tsal‚Äô√°lh in St'at'imcets, the Lillooet language) means simply \\"lake\\" or, particularly, the lake, meaning Seton Lake, a freshwater fjord stretching twenty miles through a desert canyon westwards from the Fraser River at Lillooet. Geography At the western end of that lake is a short isthmus of land, beyond which is the similar-sized Anderson Lake and the start of pavement southwestwards through the resort areas of Pemberton and Whistler via the port, railway and logging town of Squamish to Vancouver. Located on the portage is the neighbouring community of Seton Portage, which contains the other main communities of the Seton Lake Band of the St'at'imc Nation plus a mix of residential and resort homes owned by non-natives (pop. 700). 19th- century history These lakes figured prominently as part of the Douglas Road or \\"Lakes Route\\", a series of trails and portages from the head of river navigation from the Coast at Port Douglas on Harrison Lake. During the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush, a horde of miners bound for the upper Fraser bars around Lillooet streamed through the valley in the matter of a few weeks. Estimates range from 15,000‚Äì30,000 in this migration, although official records of the time suggest there were no more than 5,000 miners active on the upper Fraser at its peak. During this migration, Shalalth was largely bypassed as the \\"road\\" at this point was the waters of Seton Lake offshore from the benches above the lake forming the community. The Lakes Route was near-completely abandoned by the later 1860s due to the construction of the new Cariboo Wagon Road from Yale to the newer Cariboo Goldfields farther north via the lower the Thompson River and the town Ashcroft, where that route branches off from that river via the Bonaparte River. By the late 19th century, an Oblate mission had been established at Shalalth, which as a result became known as \\"the Mission\\", a term which gaves its name to creek coming down from the high mountain pass above, and to that pass and the ridge from there to Lillooet along the north side of Seton Lake. View of Seton Lake from mountainside above Shalalth. The steep, switchbacking packtrain route over this pass, 3500' in elevation above the lake, was the easiest route into the upper Bridge River Valley on the north side of the pass, and when that country's immense gold potential began to be increasingly prospected and exploited, the Mission Mountain trail evolved into the Mission Mountain Road, suitable for the first rugged trucks to replacement the old muletrains, although equipment for the mines being was still barged in by lake to Shalalth and then hauled piece-by-piece over the mountain. Then, before engines and freight wagons were brought in (a road along the route of the trail was not built until 1912) equipment and heavy supplies bound for the mines were rafted up the still-flowing Bridge River from a few miles west of the north foot of the pass (in order to avoid rapids and strong currents). Nearly all infrastructure costs for the development of the Mission Mountain Road and the Bridge River Road were born by local citizens, as the government would not invest; the same is true of the \\"New Road\\" through the canyon from Terzaghi Dam to Moha. 20th-century history Shalalth during the late 1940s. The buildings on the farther point are the train station and offices and warehouses of various shipping companies, as well as a few small hostelries and private cabinsSurvey and construction of the Pacific Great Eastern Railway along the lakes, completed by 1915, promulgated Shalalth as the \\"port\\" for the Bridge River goldfields beyond the pass, and a variety of cartage services and hostelries sprung up at the base of the road, just around the point from The Mission and the core village-area of Shalalth. Seton House at Shalalth, 1946The traffic of professionals visiting the mines included Geoffrey Downton, a hydroelectric engineer who was the first to notice the hydroelectric potential resulting from the 1600' difference in elevation between the Bridge River and Seton Lake, which are only narrowly separated by Mission Ridge. =Bridge River Townsite (South Shalalth)= Bridge River townsite at South Shalalth during Powerhouse No. 1 construction, c. 1947Development of the electrical potential was in full swing by the mid-1920s, with a \\"model village\\" erected around the west side of the bay where Shalalth is located, and one of the tunnels piercing the mountainside above completed, but construction came to a halt with the onset of the Great Depression and the collapse of the finances backing the project, and work ground to a halt in 1929. The townsite remained largely empty during the 1930s, although steady traffic to the mines in the Bridge River Country over the mountain kept the hotels busy. =Japanese internment= When World War II came, the semi-abandoned village built for the hydro project at the rail stop of South Shalalth, which had gone dormant at the start of the Great Depression and colloquially known as Bridge River, was chosen for one of several relocation centres for Japanese-Canadians from the coast in the Lillooet area. One of the relocatees at Shalalth was Dr. Masajiro Miyazaki, a US-trained osteopathic physician who stayed on after the war and became one of Lillooet's two Companions of the Order of Canada. =Post-War Bridge River townsite= Bridge River townsite at South Shalalth ‚Äì closeup of hotel and residential area, 1940sAfter the war, construction of the hydroelectric project resumed with a vengeance, and along with a new boom in traffic to the mines came a surge in equipment to finish the power project. For the next twenty or twenty-five years, Shalalth became the main transportation hub for the surrounding region, with nearly 24-hour heavy traffic over the pass, either to and from the mines or to the new, expanded damsite just over the pass at the head of the Bridge River Canyon. In addition to lakeside hostelries such as Seton House and Shalalth Lodge at Shalalth itself, a large hotel was built above the hydro townsite's railway station, adjacent to the managers' houses and the semicircle of barracks built for workmen (which had been used for the Japanese relocation, as had the empty houses in the townsite itself). The hotel's guests included not only project-related visitors but businessmen and investors en route over Mission Mountain to visit the Bridge River mines. The hotel sadly burned down around 1949. During the 1950s, the population of the Bridge River Townsite on Seton Lake and Seton Portage area mushroomed into the thousands, mostly single men as is typical of construction booms but with enough families to boost the schools population into the hundreds. Other hydro townsites were located at Terzaghi Dam in the Bridge River Canyon, at Lajoie, below the site of Lajoie Dam 35 miles upriver, and also caused a building boom in Lillooet, filling in the formerly empty land between the old Main Street and the train station. =Building of the Mission Mountain Road= A medical crisis in Bralorne, the most important of the Bridge River gold towns, at the far upper end of that valley, prompted community efforts to build a road via the Bridge River Canyon directly to Lillooet, which after the hydro project was finished had the effect of reducing the importance of the Mission Mountain Road and therefore also of Shalalth, once the hydro project was completed in 1962. =Ohin= In recent history, the Seton Lake Indian Band built a new residential subdivision named Ohin, further east than the traditional Shalalth rancherie area (beginning at the base of the Mission Mountain Road to a few coves east). The name Ohin, pronounced OO(kh)win means \\"frostbite\\", is a reminder of the bitter cold of the Seton valley in winter. Beyond Ohin the roads peter out towards Lillooet, and travel to the foot of the lake is possible only by rail or water (although fragments of the old cliffside catwalks of the Lillooet Cattle Trail remain in places). There is a private recreational property before the first point, and two isolated reserves on debris fans farther along the lake, all of which are only accessible by water or rail. =Along the lake to Lillooet= The distance from the end of roads in Shalalth and Ohin to roads out of Lillooet is only about 10 miles along the lake, but the cliffside of the lake is too severe to allow any road construction because of the railway ‚Äì which is already built on trestles. Locals sometimes walk the line, to the disapproval of the railway company. Sections of the old Lillooet Trail catwalks still exist on the cliffs above the rail line but are not safe to use. Mountain goats and sheep remain common on the slopes of Mission Ridge above Shalalth, and particularly along the bluffs around Retaskit and at Seton Beach, at the Lillooet end of the lake. Mount Brew and Lillooet Because of the obstacle posed by the lakeshore, the Mission Mountain Road remains the valley's only official road contact with the outside world, although the High Line Road to D'Arcy/N'quatqua is serviceable for most vehicles (but not recognized as an official roadway for insurance purposes). Water taxi service is available on Seton Lake, but has no formal schedule or licensed service. Most pleasure craft on the lake are from the Lillooet end. Social conditions In the years since, the valley has dwindled into quietude, with the native people once again the majority of the population in the valley, and especially at Shalalth itself. Their local economy is based on a small native-run timber milling outfit and various small businesses, and there is a native-run school dedicated to the preservation and encouragement of St'at'imc culture and the St'at'imcets language. Transportation Regular passenger service to and from neighbouring native communities to the southwest and North Vancouver beyond ended in 2002, but service between Seton Portage and Lillooet (the region's main social and commercial centre) is available through the Kaoham Shuttle. The Rocky Mountaineer, a blue-plate tourism service, also operates along the rail line, but fares are prohibitive and the service only stops locally in Lillooet. Shalalth remains without easy road access to the outside world, the only two routes in and out of the valley being extremely difficult mountain roads ‚Äì the Mission Mountain Road, and a powerline road along Anderson Lake known as the High-Line Road, leading to the native and recreational community of D'Arcy (N'quatqua) at the farther end of that lake, which connects by regular road to Highway 99 at Mount Currie, and from there to Pemberton, Whistler, Squamish and Vancouver.

The school is the only high school in the Kokomo School Corporation. History The earliest Kokomo High School found in records was in existence from about 1872 to 1916. The construction of the original Kokomo High School started in 1870 on the corner of Armstrong and Taylor with the first class commencing in 1872 according to a newspaper of that time.http://newspaperarchive.com/kokomo- journal/1870-05-20/page-3?tag=kokomo+high+school&rtserp;=tags/?pc=15127œà=38&pci;=7&pep;=kokomo- high-school&psb;=dateasc In 1898 the original high school burned down and a second building was built on the corner of Market and Sycamore. In 1914 the high school was again destroyed by fire. The third campus of Kokomo High School, first known as Howard County's Central School Building, was dedicated on October 19, 1917.http://kokomo.newspaperarchive.com/PdfViewer.aspx?pubdateid=11366376&src;=browse Located at 303 East Superior Street, this building now houses Central Middle School.http://blackboard.kokomoschools.com/webapps/portal/frameset.jsp?tab=courses&url;=%2Fbin%2Fcommon%2Fcourse.pl%3Fcourse_id%3D_395_Former Kokomo High School The current campus of Kokomo High School was built in 1968 Previously, the downtown campus was known as Kokomo High School and the south campus was named Haworth High School. However, in 1983 the Kokomo-Center Township Board of Trustees decided that two high schools were no longer necessary. Consequently, in 1984 Haworth High School was closed and the former Haworth students began attending Kokomo High School. After the reorganization, Kokomo High School was split into two campuses. The downtown campus had 8th and 9th grade students, and the south campus (the former Haworth High School) had 10th, 11th, and 12th graders. After the south campus was expanded, the south campus became the primary location and served 9th to 12th grade students. The downtown campus later became Central Middle School in 1998. Kokomo High School still has visible reminders of the building's history, including a framed portrait of C.V. Haworth and a case featuring Haworth's mascot, the Haworth Huskies. The C.V. Haworth award is also given to Seniors who show \\"exceptional ability in writing and speaking\\". The C.V. Haworth Memorial Scholarship Fund is available to capable seniors from Kokomo High School who are entering a bachelor's degree program at Indiana University at either the Kokomo or Bloomington campuses.http://www.cfhoward.org/images/annualreport99 Extracurricular Activities = Arts = Kokomo High School is host to a variety of visual and performing arts programs. Within the school are ceramic, drawing, painting and multimedia studios. Students' works are displayed in the Student Gallery. Seniors submit art for the annual senior art show in May. Performing arts are enjoyed in diverse student activities. Kokomo High School hosts six choirs: Chorale, Karisma, Choraliers, Vocal Jazz, Chamber, and Advanced Chamber. Fall Marching Band serves as the school's most popular extracurricular activity, placing second at Indiana's State Fair Band Day in 2017. Fall Color Guard and Winter Guard are similarly popular. Extracurricular music activities include Jazz Band, Winter Wind Ensemble, and Indoor Percussion. Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced Concert Band, Wind Ensemble, Percussion, and Elementary and Advanced Orchestra comprise the school's music classes. Athletics Kokomo High School offers more than 20 sports under the Indiana High School Athletic Association. It is a member of the North Central Conference. Boys' teams compete under the title of Wildkats; girls' team compete as Lady Kats. Fall sports offered by the school include Boys' and Girl's Cross Country, Boys' and Girls' Soccer, Boys' Tennis, Girls' Golf, Boys Football, Girls' Volleyball. Winter sports include Boys' and Girls' Basketball, Boys' and Girls' Swimming and Diving, and Boys' Wrestling Spring sports at Kokomo High School include Boys' Golf, Girls' Tennis, Boys' Baseball, Girls' Softball, Boys' and Girls' Track and Field, and Unified Track and Field. Cheerleading and Competitive Dance are available as a non-IHSAA club sport. In 2017, Kokomo High School's football team was the state runner- up in the IHSAA's Class 5A football. The competitive dance team also advanced to state finals for the 2017-2018 school year.

As a critic and theorist she has published steadily since 1965 in Artforum, Art International and Art in America. She was associate editor of Artforum from 1971 to 1974 and has been editor of October, a journal of contemporary arts criticism and theory that she co-founded in 1976. Early life Krauss was born to Matthew M. Epstein and Bertha Luber Rosalind E. Krauss biography in Washington D.C. and grew up in the area, visiting art museums with her father. After graduating from Wellesley in 1962, she attended Harvard, The Real Thing: An Interview with Rosalind E. Krauss by David Plante at: http://www.artcritical.com/ whose Department of Fine Arts (now Department of History of Art and Architecture) had a strong tradition of the intensive analysis of actual art objects under the aegis of the Fogg Museum. Krauss wrote her dissertation on the work of David Smith.Chilvers, Ian & Glaves-Smith, John eds., Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009. p. 384 Krauss received her Ph.D. in 1969. The dissertation was published as Terminal Iron Works in 1971. In the late-1960s and early-1970s Krauss began to contribute articles to art journals such as Art International and Artforum ‚Äî which, under the editorship of Philip Leider, was relocated from California to New York. She began by writing the \\"Boston Letter\\" for Art International, but soon published well-received articles on Jasper Johns (Lugano Review, 1965) and Donald Judd (Allusion and Illusion in Donald Judd, Artforum, May 1966). Her commitment to the emerging minimal art in particular set her apart from Michael Fried, who was oriented toward the continuation of modernist abstraction in Jules Olitski, Kenneth Noland and Anthony Caro. Krauss's article A View of Modernism (Artforum, September 1972), was one signal of this break. Career =Founding October= Krauss became dissatisfied with Artforum when in its November 1974 issue it published a full-page advertisement by featuring the artist Lynda Benglis aggressively posed with a large latex dildo and wearing only a pair of sunglasses promoting an upcoming exhibition of hers at the Paula Cooper Gallery. Although Benglis' image is now popularly cited as an important example of gender performativity in contemporary art, it provoked mixed responses when it first appeared.Richmond, Susan. \\"\\" \\"Sizing Up the Dildo: Lynda Benglis' Artforum Advertisement as a Feminist Icon\\", n.paradoxa 15 (January 2005): 24-34. Krauss and other Artforum personnel attacked Benglis' work in the following month's issue of Artforum, describing the advertisement as exploitative and brutalizing, and soon left the magazine to co-found October in 1976. October was formed as a politically- charged journal that introduced American readers to the ideas of French post- structuralism, made popular by Michel Foucault and Roland Barthes. Krauss used October as a way of publishing essays on post-structuralist art theory, Deconstructionist theory, psychoanalysis, postmodernism and feminism. The founders included Krauss, Annette Michelson and the artist Jeremy Gilbert- Rolfe. Krauss was appointed as its founding editor. Jeremy Gilbert-Rolfe withdrew after only a few issues, and by the spring of 1977, Douglas Crimp joined the editorial team. In 1990, after Crimp left the journal, Krauss and Michelson were joined by Yve-Alain Bois, Hal Foster, Benjamin H. D. Buchloh, Denis Hollier, and John Rajchman. =Academic= Hunter College Krauss taught at Wellesley, MIT and Princeton before joining the faculty at Hunter College in 1974. She was promoted to professor in 1977 at Hunter and was also appointed professor at the Graduate Center of CUNY. She held the title of Distinguished Professor at Hunter until she left to join the Columbia University faculty in 1992. In 1985, a monograph of essays by Krauss, titled The Originality of the Avant-Garde and Other Modernist Myths was published by The MIT Press. Columbia University Previously Meyer Schapiro Professor of Modern Art and Theory at Columbia, in 2005 Rosalind Krauss was promoted to the highest faculty rank of University Professor. She has received fellowships from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts and has been a fellow of the Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts and of the Institute for Advanced Study. She received the Frank Jewett Mather Award for criticism from the College Art Association in 1973. She has been a fellow of the New York Institute for the Humanities since 1992 and was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1994. She recently received an honorary doctorate from the University of London. =Curator= Krauss has been curator of many art exhibitions at leading museums, among them exhibitions on Joan Mir√≥ at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (1970‚Äì73), on surrealism and photography at the Corcoran Museum of Art (1982‚Äì85), on Richard Serra at the Museum of Modern Art (1985‚Äì86), and on Robert Morris at the Guggenheim (1992‚Äì94). She prepared an exhibition for the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris called \\"Formlessness: Modernism Against the Grain\\" in 1996. Critical approach =Greenbergian tradition= Krauss's attempts to understand the phenomenon of modernist art, in its historical, theoretical, and formal dimensions, have led her in various directions. She has, for example, been interested in the development of photography, whose history ‚Äì running parallel to that of modernist painting and sculpture ‚Äì makes visible certain previously overlooked phenomena in the \\"high arts\\", such as the role of the indexical mark, or the function of the archive. She has also investigated certain concepts, such as \\"formlessness\\", \\"the optical unconscious\\", or \\"pastiche\\", which organize modernist practice in relation to different explanatory grids from those of progressive modernism, or the avant- garde. Like many, Krauss had been drawn to the criticism of Clement Greenberg, as a counterweight to the highly subjective, poetic approach of Harold Rosenberg. The poet-critic model proved long-lasting in the New York scene, with products from Frank O'Hara to Kynaston McShine to Peter Schjeldahl, but for Krauss and others, its basis in subjective expression was fatally unable to account for how a particular artwork's objective structure gives rise to its associated subjective effects. Greenberg's way of assessing how an art object works, or how it is put together, became for Krauss a fruitful resource; even if she and fellow \\"Greenberger\\", Michael Fried, would break first with the older critic, and then with each other, at particular moments of judgment, the commitment to formal analysis as the necessary if not sufficient ground of serious criticism would still remain for both of them. Decades after her first engagement with Greenberg, Krauss still used his ideas about an artwork's 'medium' as a jumping-off point for her strongest effort to come to terms with post-1980 art in the person of William Kentridge. Krauss would formulate this formalist commitment in strong terms, against attempts to account for powerful artworks in terms of residual ideas about an artist's individual genius, for instance in the essays \\"The Originality of the Avant- Garde: A Postmodernist Repetition\\" and \\"Photography's Discursive Spaces.\\" For Krauss, and for the school of critics who developed under her influence, the Greenbergian legacy offers at its best a way of accounting for works of art using public and hence verifiable criteria. =Translating ephemeralities into prose= Whether about (Cubist collage, Surrealist photography, early Giacometti sculpture, Rodin, Br√¢ncu»ôi, Pollock) or about art contemporaneous to her own writing (Robert Morris, Sol LeWitt, Richard Serra, Cindy Sherman), Krauss translates the ephemeralities of visual and bodily experience into precise, vivid English, which has solidified her prestige as a critic. Her usual practice is to make this experience intelligible by using categories translated from the work of a thinker outside the study of art, such as Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Ferdinand de Saussure, Jacques Lacan, Jean-Fran√ßois Lyotard, Jacques Derrida, Georges Bataille, or Roland Barthes.Chilvers, Ian & Glaves-Smith, John eds., Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009. p. 385 Indeed, she participated in the translation of Lacan's key text \\"Television\\" which was published in October and later reissued in book form by Norton. Her work has helped establish the position of these writers within the study of art, even at the cost of provoking anxiety about threats to the discipline's autonomy. She is currently preparing a second volume of collected essays as a sequel to The Originality of the Avant Garde and Other Modernist Myths (1986). In many cases, Krauss is credited as a leader in bringing these concepts to bear on the study of modern art. For instance, her Passages in Modern Sculpture (1977) makes important use of Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology (as she had come to understand it in thinking about minimal art) for viewing modern sculpture in general. In her study of Surrealist photography, she rejected William Rubin's efforts at formal categorization as insufficient, instead advocating the psychoanalytic categories of \\"dream\\" and \\"automatism\\", as well as Jacques Derrida's \\"grammatological\\" idea of \\"spacing.\\" See \\"The Photographic Conditions of Surrealism\\" (October, winter 1981). =Picasso's collages= Concerning Cubist art, she took Picasso's collage breakthrough to be explicable in terms of Saussure's ideas about the differential relations and non-referentiality of language, rejecting efforts by other scholars to tie the pasted newspaper clippings to social history. Similarly, she held Picasso's stylistic developments in Cubist portraiture to be products of theoretical problems internal to art, rather than outcomes of the artist's love life. Later, she explained Picasso's participation in the rappel √† l'ordre or return to order of the 1920s in similar structuralist terms. See \\"In the Name of Picasso\\" (October, spring 1981), \\"The Motivation of the Sign\\" (in Lynn Zelevansky, ed., Picasso and Braque: A Symposium, 1992), and The Picasso Papers (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1998). =Freudian theory= From the 1980s, she became increasingly concerned with using a psychoanalytic understanding of drives and the unconscious, owing less to the Freudianism of an Andr√© Breton or a Salvador Dal√≠, and much more to the structuralist Lacan and the \\"dissident surrealist\\" Bataille. See \\"No More Play\\", her 1984 essay on Giacometti, as well as \\"Corpus Delicti\\", written for the 1985 exhibition L'Amour Fou: Photography and Surrealism, Cindy Sherman: 1975‚Äì1993 and The Optical Unconscious (both 1993) and Formless: A User's Guide with Yve-Alain Bois, catalog to the exhibition L'Informe: Mode d'emploi (Paris: Centre Pompidou, 1996). =Interpreting Pollock= Years after her time at Artforum in the 1960s, Krauss also returned to the drip painting of Jackson Pollock as both a culmination of modernist work within the format of the \\"easel picture\\", and a breakthrough that opened the way for several important developments in later art, from Allan Kaprow's happenings to Richard Serra's lead-flinging process art to Andy Warhol's oxidation (i.e. urination) paintings. For reference, see the Pollock chapter in The Optical Unconscious, several entries in the Formless catalog, and \\"Beyond the Easel Picture\\", her contribution to the MoMA symposium accompanying the 1998 Pollock retrospective (Jackson Pollock: New Approaches). This direction provided intellectual validation for the explosive Pollock markets; but it exacerbated already tense relations between herself and more radical currents in visual/cultural studies, the latter growing steadily impatient with the traditional western art-historical canon. In addition to writing focused studies about individual artists, Krauss also produced broader, synthetic studies that helped gather together and define the limits of particular fields of practice. Examples of this include \\"Sense and Sensibility: Reflections on Post '60s Sculpture\\" (Artforum, Nov. 1973), \\"Video: The Aesthetics of Narcissism\\" (October, spring 1976), \\"Notes on the Index: Seventies Art in America\\", in two parts, October spring and fall 1977), \\"Grids, You Say\\", In Grids: Format and Image in 20th Century Art (exh. cat.: Pace Gallery, 1978), and \\"Sculpture in the Expanded Field\\" (October, spring 1979). Some of these essays are collected in her book The Originality of the Avant-Garde and Other Modernist Myths.

The band wrote all its songs about movies and was named after a 1971 film directed by Monte Hellman. The members of the band were Matt Harrop on vocals and guitar, Luke Hutching on bass, Phil Smiley on drums, and Pip Brown on lead guitar and background vocals. The band was influenced by protopunk groups such as The Stooges and The MC5, and were often compared with contemporary hard rock bands such as fellow countrymen The Datsuns. History The band formed in early 2001 when Harrop's then hardcore band was looking for a second guitarist. Harrop invited Brown to audition after meeting her in a documentary film class. Harrop and Brown's mutual interest in old cinema and 70s rock inspired them to form a new band and start writing songs. Smiley, a mutual acquaintance of Brown and Harrop, was asked to drum, introducing a darker feel to the sound, and another design school student, Ben Fraser, a trained jazz musician, was called in to play bass. As a member of two other local bands, Fraser didn't have enough time for the increasing workload of Two Lane Blacktop and soon left the band. Nato Hickey, bass player in the band Paselode, temporarily filled in while the band looked for a replacement. Hickey introduced the band to their future manager Dave Benge, then manager of New Zealand bands Fur Patrol and Cassette, before Hutching, lead guitarist for the band Fore Arm of Fury, was brought in on bass about one month before their first scheduled shows in Australia. The band enjoyed quick success in Australia, riding the wave of the popular New Rock revival, and it wasn't long before the band was making frequent trips between the two countries. In May 2003, the 7\\" single \\"The Rat\\" / \\"Hellhound\\" was released through Infidelity Records and distributed throughout New Zealand and Australia. It gained considerable air play in each country and was placed on rotation by John Peel on his Radio 1 programme. The band was received well by the Australian press, appearing in the 'ones to watch' issue of Rolling Stone magazine in June 2003, as did their single \\"The Rat\\", which made it onto the CD which came with that issue. Back in New Zealand, the band gained nominations for 'Best new band' and 'Best unreleased song' in the New Zealand BNet awards. In mid-2003, the band made its first trip to America, playing 3 weeks of shows in Los Angeles and New York.

As a part of his political activities he was the Chairman of National Council of American-Soviet Friendship starting from the early 1940s. Career =Early years= Lamont was born in Englewood, New Jersey, on March 28, 1902. He was the son of Florence Haskell (Corliss) and Thomas W. Lamont, a partner and later chairman at J.P. Morgan & Co. Lamont graduated as valedictorian of Phillips Exeter Academy in 1920, and magna cum laude from Harvard University in 1924. The principles that animated his life were first evidenced at Harvard, where he attacked university clubs as snobbery. In 1924, he did graduate work at New College University of Oxford, where he roomed with Julian Huxley. The next year Lamont began graduate studies at Columbia University, where he studied under John Dewey. In 1928, he became a philosophy instructor there. He received his Ph.D. in philosophy in 1932 from Columbia.Corliss Lamont, Steadfast Activist at 84. New York: Basic Pamphlets, 1984; p. 4 Lamont taught at Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, and the New School for Social Research. =1930s= Lamont became a radical in the 1930s, moved by the Great Depression. He wrote a book about the Soviet Union and praised what he saw there: \\"The people are better dressed, food is good and plentiful, everyone seems confident, happy and full of spirit\\". He became critical of the Soviets over time, but always thought their achievement in transforming a feudal society remarkable, even as he attacked its treatment of political dissent and lack of civil liberties. Lamont's political views were Marxist and socialist for much of his life. Lamont was one-time chairman of the Friends of the Soviet Union. Lamont began his 30 years as a director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) in 1932. In 1934, he was arrested while on a picket line in Jersey City, New Jersey, part of a long battle between labor and civil rights activists and Frank Hague, the city's mayor. Lamont later wrote that he \\"learned more about the American legal system in one day .. than in one year at Harvard Law School\\". In 1936, Lamont helped found and subsidized the magazine Marxist Quarterly. When the Dewey Commission reported in 1937 that the Moscow trials of Leon Trotsky and others were fraudulent, Lamont, along with other left-wing intellectuals, refused to accept the Commission's findings. Under the influence of the Popular Front, Lamont and 150 other left- wing writers endorsed Josef Stalin's actions as necessary for \\"the preservation of progressive democracy\\". Their letter warned that Dewey's work was itself politically motivated and charged Dewey with supporting reactionary views and \\"Red-baiting\\". Lamont wrote an introduction to an anti-Polish pamphlet Behind the Polish-Soviet Break by Alter Brody.Introduction by Corliss Lamont = 1940s = Lamont was a key founder of the National Council of American-Soviet Friendship (NCASF) (originally National Council on Soviet Relations or NCSR). (Other founders included: Professor Ralph Barton Perry of Harvard University and Edwin Seymour Smith.) He served as its first chairman from 1943 to 1947. Lamont remained sympathetic to the Soviet Union well after World War II and the establishment of satellite Communist governments in Central and Eastern Europe. He authored a pamphlet entitled The Myth of Soviet Aggression in which he wrote: = 1950s = Lamont ran for the U.S. Senate from New York, in 1952 on the American Labor ticket. He received 104,702 votes and lost to Republican Irving M. Ives. When called to testify in front of Senator Joseph McCarthy's Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations in 1953, he denied ever having been a Communist, but refused to discuss his beliefs or those of others, citing not the Fifth Amendment as so many others did but the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech. The committee cited Lamont for contempt of Congress by a vote of 71 to 3 in August 1954. Some senators questioned McCarthy's authority and wanted a federal court to rule on it. In November Lamont donated $50,000 to create a $1,000,000 Bill of Rights Fund to support civil rights advocates, citing anti-Communist legislation, travel restrictions, and blacklisting in the entertainment industry. That same month he challenged the subcommittee's authority in court. The same year, he penned Why I Am Not a Communist. Despite his allegiance to Marxism, he never joined the Communist Party USA, and supported the Korean War.Rothbard, Murray N.. Confessions of a Right-Wing Liberal, Ludwig von Mises Institute In April 1955, Lamont withdrew from his role as a philosophy lecturer at Columbia University pending the outcome of these legal proceedings, and the university said it was Lamont's decision, made \\"without prior suggestion by any officer of the university\\". Judge Edward Weinfeld of the U.S. District Court found the indictment against Lamont was faulty, but the government, rather than seek a new indictment, appealed that ruling. A unanimous panel of the Court of Appeals agreed in 1955 and in 1956 the government chose not to appeal to the Supreme Court. As a director of the ACLU, Lamont had resisted attempts to purge the organization of Communists and, in 1954, he resigned his position because he felt the ACLU had not supported him in the face of McCarthy charges. The complete record of the legal proceedings in Lamont's case against the McCarthy subcommittee was published in 1957. In 1951 and 1957, he was denied a passport by the State Department, which considered his application incomplete because he refused to answer a question about membership in the Communist Party. He sued the State Department in June 1957 seeking a hearing on its action. He obtained his passport in June 1958 following a Supreme Court decision in another case, Kent v. Dulles, and left the U.S. for a world tour in March 1959. He ran again for the U.S. Senate from New York in 1958 on the Independent-Socialist ticket. He received more than 49,000 votes out of more than 5,500,000 cast and lost to Republican Kenneth B. Keating. In 1959, Lamont became an enthusiastic supporter of Fidel Castro and his revolutionary government in Cuba.Lamont, Corliss, A Lifetime of Dissent, New York: Prometheus Books (1988) Day described Lamont in her diary as a \\"'pinko' millionaire who lived modestly\\". = 1960s = In 1964, Lamont sued the Postmaster General for reading and, at times, refusing to deliver his mail under the anti-propaganda mail law of 1962, passed over the objections of the Department of Justice and the Post Office, that allowed the Postmaster General to destroy \\"communist political propaganda\\" sent from outside the United States unless the addressee says he wants to receive such mail. The statute did not apply to sealed correspondence, but was aimed at published materials. He lost a 2 to 1 decision in U.S. District Court, after the Post Office delivered one such item of mail, and he appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the single delivery was a subterfuge designed to moot his lawsuit while continue to interrupt his mail service. On May 24, 1965, he won in the Supreme Court, which held unanimously in a decision in Lamont v. Postmaster General written by Justice William O. Douglas, that the law was unconstitutional. It was the first time the Supreme Court invalidated a statute as a violation of the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech. Lamont' attorney was Leonard B. Boudin, who worked on many civil liberties cases. He won a similar lawsuit against the Central Intelligence Agency in federal court the same year. In the mid-1960s, he became chairman of the National Emergency Civil Liberties Committee, a position that he held until his death 30 years later. = Later life = In 1971, after a congressman called him an \\"identified member of the Communist Party, U.S.A.\\", Lamont issued a statement that \\"although it is no disgrace to belong to the Communist party, I have never even dreamed of joining it.\\" That same year, he financed Dorothy Day's visit to the Soviet Union and several other countries in Eastern Europe. In 1979, Lamont founded Half-Moon Foundation, Inc. Half-Moon Foundation was a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization and was incorporated in the state of New York. The Foundation was formed \\"to promote enduring international peace, support for the United Nations, the conservation of our country's natural environment, and to safeguard and extend civil liberties as guaranteed under the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.\\" Lamont was president emeritus of the American Humanist Association and in 1977 was named Humanist of the Year. In 1981, he received the Gandhi Peace Award. In 1998, Lamont received a posthumous Distinguished Humanist Service Award from the International Humanist and Ethical Union and he was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto. Personal life and death In 1928, Lamont married Margaret Hayes Irish. They divorced in the early 1960s. In 1962, he married Helen Boyden Lamb; she died of cancer in 1975. In 1986, Lamont married Beth Keehner; she survived his death. He died at home in Ossining, New York, on April 26, 1995. Legacy Following the deaths of his parents, Lamont became a philanthropist. He funded the collection and preservation of manuscripts of American philosophers, particularly George Santayana, as well as Rockwell Kent and John Masefield. He became a substantial donor to both Harvard and Columbia, endowing the latter's \\"Corliss Lamont Professor of Civil Liberties.\\" He was the great-uncle of Ned Lamont, a 2006 Democratic Party nominee for Connecticut to the United States Senate, and current Governor of Connecticut. Writings Lamont was a prolific author. He wrote, co-wrote, edited, or co-edited more than two dozen books and dozens of pamphlets, and wrote thousands of letters to newspapers, magazines, and journals on significant social issues during his lifelong campaign for peace and civil rights. In 1935, he published The Illusion of Immortality (originally published in 1932 as Issues of Immortality: A Study in Implications), which was a revised version of his doctoral dissertation. According to James Leuba the book is considered to remain the standard work on the subject and shows conclusively that the arguments for immortality are totally insufficient.Leuba, James. (1935). The Illusion of Immortality by Corliss Lamont. The Journal of Religion. Vol. 15, No. 3. pp. 323-325. Lamont argued that people can live satisfactory lives without belief in life after death and that human life may be recognized to be more precious if it is realized that it only comes once to each man.Sellars, Roy. (1951). The Illusion of Immortality by Corliss Lamont. Philosophy and Phenomenological Research. Vol. 11, No. 3. pp. 444-445. His most famous work is The Philosophy of Humanism (originally published in 1949 as Humanism as a Philosophy), now in its eighth edition. He also published intimate portraits of John Dewey, John Masefield, and George Santayana. = Books authored or co-authored by Corliss Lamont= *A Humanist Funeral Service (revised by Beth K.

The attack on Fort Duquesne was part of a large-scale British expedition with 6,000 troops led by General John Forbes to drive the French out of the contested Ohio Country (the upper Ohio River Valley) and clear the way for an invasion of Canada. Forbes ordered Major James Grant of the 77th Regiment to reconnoiter the area with 850 men. Grant, apparently on his own initiative, proceeded to attack the French position using traditional European military tactics. His force was out- maneuvered, surrounded, and largely destroyed by the French and their native allies led by Fran√ßois-Marie Le Marchand de Lignery. Major Grant was taken prisoner and the British survivors retreated fitfully to Fort Ligonier. After repulsing this advance party the French, deserted by some of their native allies and vastly outnumbered by the approaching Forbes, blew up their magazines and burnt Fort Duquesne. In November the French withdrew from the Ohio Valley and British colonists erected Fort Pitt on the site. Forbes commanded between 5,000 and 7,000 men, including a contingent of Virginians led by George Washington. Forbes, very ill, did not keep up with the advance of his army, but entrusted it to his second in command, Lt. Col. Henry Bouquet, a Swiss officer commanding a battalion of the Royal American Regiment. Bouquet sanctioned a reconnaissance of Fort Duquesne by Major James Grant of Ballindalloch, Fort Duquesne On September 11, 1758, Grant led over 800 men to scout the environs of Fort Duquesne ahead of Forbes' main column.Fleming, p. 391 Bouquet believed the fort to be held by 500 French and 300 Indians, a force too strong to be attacked by Grant's detachment. Grant, who arrived in the vicinity of the fort on September 13, believed there were only 200 enemy within, and sent a small party of 50 men forward to scout.Fleming, pp. 391-392 These saw no enemy outside the fort; they burned a storehouse and returned to Grant's main position, two miles (3 km) from the fort.Fleming, p. 392 The next morning, Grant divided his force into several parts. A company of the 77th, under a Capt. McDonald, approached the fort with drums beating and pipes playing as a decoy. A force of 400 men lay in wait to ambush the enemy when they went out to attack McDonald, and several hundred more under the Virginian Maj. Andrew Lewis were concealed near the force's baggage train in the hope of surprising an enemy attack there ... The French and Indian force was in fact much larger than anticipated, and moved swiftly. They overwhelmed McDonald's decoy force and overran the party that had been meant to ambush them. Lewis's force left its ambush positions and went to the aid of the rest of the force but the French and Indians had by then gained a point of high ground above them and forced them to retire. The Indians used the forest to their advantage; \\"concealed by a thick foliage, their heavy and destructive fire could not be returned with any effect\\".Stewart, Volume I, pp. 312-313 In the one-sided battle in the woods, the British and American force suffered 342 casualties, of whom 232 were from the 77th Regiment, including Grant, who was taken prisoner.Stewart, Volume I, Page 313 Out of the eight officers in Andrew Lewis's Virginian contingent, 5 were killed, 1 was wounded and Lewis himself was captured.Dolack, Founder‚Äôs Son Leads Area Through Wars with French and British Nevertheless, most of Grant's force escaped to rejoin the main army under Forbes and Bouquet. The Franco-Indian force suffered only 8 killed and 8 wounded. James Smith wrote \\"Notwithstanding their (the Indians') vigilance, Colonel Grant, with his Highlanders, stole a march upon them, and in the night took possession of a hill about eighty rod from Fort Du Quesne; this hill is on that account called Grant's Hill to this day. The French and Indians knew not that Grant and his men were there until they beat the drum and played upon the bagpipes, just at daylight. They then flew to arms, and the Indians ran up under cover of the banks of Allegheny and Monongahela, for some distance, and then sallied out from the banks of the rivers, and took possession of the hill above Grant; and as he was on the point of it in sight of the fort, they immediately surrounded him, and as he had his Highlanders in ranks, and in very close order, and the Indians scattered, and concealed behind trees, they defeated him with the loss only of a few warriors; most of the Highlanders were killed or taken prisoners.\\" A plaque on the Allegheny County Courthouse, erected in 1901 commemorates the site of the battle, and the hill where the battle was fought is today called Grant Street, in Pittsburgh. French retreat Though the French had beaten off the initial British attack, Lignery understood that his force of about 600 could not hold Fort Duquesne against the main British force of more than ten times that number. The French continued to occupy Fort Duquesne until November 26, when the garrison set fire to the fort and left under the cover of darkness. As the British marched up to the smoldering remains, they were confronted with an appalling sight. The Indians had decapitated many of the dead Highlanders and impaled their heads on the sharp stakes on top of the fort walls, with their kilts displayed below. The British and Americans rebuilt Fort Duquesne, naming it Fort Pitt after the British prime minister William Pitt, who had ordered the capture of that strategic location.

After twice batting over .350 for the Chicago Colts, he starred on championship teams with the Brooklyn Superbas and the New York Giants. At the end of his career he held the major league record for career games played (2,443); he ranked second in walks (1,064, behind Billy Hamilton's 1,187) and fifth in at bats (9,033), and was among the top ten in runs batted in (1,234), doubles (414) and extra base hits (661). He was also among the NL's top seven players in hits (2,461; some sources list totals up to 2,471), runs (1,589), triples (163) and total bases (3,447). After leading the league in assists four times and double plays three times, he set major league records for career games (2,132), putouts (4,850), assists (7,500), total chances (13,325) and double plays (881) as a shortstop; he still holds the record for total chances, and is second in putouts and fourth in assists. His 42-game hitting streak in was a record until , and remains the fourth longest in history and the longest by a right-handed NL hitter. Career Baseball card of Bill Dahlen, T206 set. Dahlen was born in Nelliston, New York at the corner of Berthoud and Dahlen and East Main to a family of German descent. \\"His father, Daniel, was a German immigrant; his mother, Rosina (n√©e Shellhorn), was the daughter of a German immigrant.\\" He was a very good hitter and had a good amount of power for the dead-ball era. He began his career with the Colts in , and during his eight years with the team finished among the NL's top ten players in home runs four times and in slugging average three times. He also scored over 100 runs with 10 or more triples in each of his first six seasons; in 1894 he posted the highest batting average to that time by a major league shortstop (various sources state .357 or .362), and he followed with a .352 average in . His 1894 season included a record 42-game hitting streak from June 20 to August 6, surpassing the 33-game streak by George Davis one year earlier. Amazingly, after going 0-for-6 in the next game, a 10-inning contest on August 7, Dahlen pulled off another 28-game streak, ending up having hit in 70 of 71 games. His mark was broken three years later by Willie Keeler, who hit in 44 straight; that NL record was eventually tied by Pete Rose. Only Joe DiMaggio, with his 56-game streak in , has bettered Dahlen's mark among right- handed batters. Dahlen also twice hit three triples in a game, and once he tripled twice in one inning (August 30, 1900). Prior to the 1899 season, Dahlen was traded by Chicago, and ended up in Brooklyn after another deal. His new team won the NL title in each of his first two seasons, and although his batting average had dropped from that of earlier years, he compensated by continuing to accumulate numerous walks and stolen bases and by playing outstanding defense. In 1902, he finished fourth in the NL with 74 RBI. In he set an NL record for fielding percentage with a .948 average, breaking George Wright's 1878 mark of .947; Tommy Corcoran broke his record in with a .952 average. Bill Dahlen, circa 1908 After the 1903 season, Dahlen was traded to the Giants, the team he'd always strived to play for, in exchange for pitcher Jack Cronin and Charlie Babb. While Cronin and Babb contributed only three bad years to Brooklyn, Dahlen posted great numbers with the Giants, leading the league with 80 RBI in his first year, . In 1905 he was again among the RBI leaders, despite hitting only .242, as the Giants won their first World Series title. Although he was hitless in the five-game Series, he contributed with flawless defense and by drawing three walks and stealing three bases. He was often considered one of the quietest players in the game, keeping to himself most of the time. After the 1907 season, he was traded to the Boston Doves, for whom he played his last two full seasons. In he broke Jake Beckley's record of 2386 career games; his record was broken in turn by Honus Wagner in . He was named Brooklyn's manager for the 1910 season, but never finished above 6th place in four seasons. His last playing appearances were three games as a pinch-hitter in 1910, and one game at shortstop in . In a 21-season career, Dahlen batted .272; his 84 home runs were then among the fifteen highest totals in history, and ranked behind only Herman Long (91) among shortstops. His 289 stolen bases after the statistic was redefined in 1898 were then among the ten highest totals, as were his 547 total steals since they were first recorded in 1887. His records for games and putouts at shortstop were broken by Rabbit Maranville, and his mark for assists was surpassed by Luis Aparicio, with his NL record standing until Ozzie Smith broke it in ; his record for double plays was broken by Roger Peckinpaugh. Dahlen's 14,566 total chances at all positions have been surpassed by only Maranville (16,091) and Wagner (15,536). In four years as a manager, all for Brooklyn, he posted a 251‚Äì355 record for a .414 winning percentage; he earned his nickname with a ferocious arguing style which drew 65 ejections as a manager, still among the top ten in history. Personal Dahlen died in Brooklyn after a long illness at age 80, and was buried in the Cemetery of the Evergreens, Brooklyn, New York City, New York. As of 2006, his grave remains unmarked. In August 2008, he was named as one of ten former players who began their careers before 1943 to be considered by the Veterans Committee for induction into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2009. The Nineteenth Century Committee of the Society for American Baseball Research named Dahlen the Overlooked 19th Century Baseball Legend for 2012‚Äîa 19th-century player, manager, executive or other baseball personality not yet inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. Dahlen was featured in David Pietrusza's 1995 television documentary \\"Local Heroes\\" in the segment \\"Knocking on Cooperstown's Door.\\" Dahlen was included on the Veterans Committee ballot for 2013 induction to the Hall of Fame. The results were announced on December 3, 2012. Dahlen received 10 out of 16 votes, falling 2 votes short of election, the highest total of any person on the ballot who was not elected and will have to wait until the end of 2015 for election.

(2005). \\"Taiheiki\\" in Japan Encyclopedia, pp. 923‚Äì924. It deals primarily with the Nanboku-ch≈ç, the period of war between the Northern Court of Ashikaga Takauji in Kyoto, and the Southern Court of Emperor Go-Daigo in Yoshino. Original work The latest English translation consists of 12 chapters of the 40-chapter epic, and spans the period from Go-Daigo's accession in 1318 (when Takauji was still a minor vassal of the Kamakura shogunate's H≈çj≈ç clan), through Takauji's betrayal of the H≈çj≈ç, and Go-Daigo's fall and expulsion by Takauji in 1333, to his return to Kyoto in 1338. Go-Daigo, unlike many of the emperors before him, sought to supersede the power of the sh≈çguns, and to actually rule in addition to reigning in name. Thus began a series of battles, both military and political, as the Fujiwara family, who dominated the Imperial regency following the fall of the H≈çj≈ç, sought to retain influence. These battles, political maneuvers, and other developments of the time are related in the Taiheiki. Historical significance These battles are historically very important as they led to the extinction of the Southern Court of the Japanese Imperial Line, which to this day is seen as legitimate. Northern Court members may be considered pretenders, but the ramifications are relics of history. One Southern Court descendant, Kumazawa Hiromichi, proclaimed himself Japan's Emperor after World War II, calling Emperor Hirohito a fraud, as Hirohito's entire line is descended from the Northern Court. Despite this, he was not arrested for l√®se majest√©, even when donning the Imperial Crest, because he had a koseki detailing his bloodline back to Go-Daigo in Yoshino. Kumazawa has been unsuccessful at creating any political change other than some sympathy. Analysis Like most Japanese historical epics, the Taiheikis tendencies towards drama and exaggeration are acknowledged, but the text is regarded as remaining mostly accurate. It is the primary source on many of the warriors and battles of this period, and also documents elements of the fall of the powerful and historically important H≈çj≈ç clan. Cultural references NHK's 1991 taiga drama Taiheiki was noted for its portrayal of Ashikaga Takauji as an agent of change against the decadent H≈çj≈ç, rather than a national traitor as generally viewed by Japanese historians.

Launched by Greyhound Bus Lines using a fleet of Boeing 727s leased from the Kelowna Flightcraft Air Charter company, the airline began service in July 1996. Its aim was to link major cities in Canada (Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Toronto, Ottawa, and Hamilton, through a connecting hub in Winnipeg), then connect passengers with Greyhound bus service to smaller communities. The airline was closed after the Canadian bus line was taken over by Laidlaw 14 months later in September 1997. It never approached profitability, and flight loads were well below expectations. The anticipated synergies of the two modes of transportation were entirely absent. The airline ran a notable ad campaign which featured a Greyhound dog lifting its leg to urinate against the wheel of an airplane.

He is known for his theory of the sublime in which he presents the notion of limit- situations in life as being central to the human experience. Personal life Tsang in Oxford in 2012 Tsang was born in Wuhua County, Guangdong, China on 7 October 1943, the son of Tsang Kwok Ying (1906‚Äì1999), District Minister of Tsung Tsin Mission (formerly Basle Mission) of Hong Kong, and Wong Kun Tsing (1916‚Äì2014), a devout Christian committed to the church and family. They moved to Hong Kong when he was two years old.A picture of Tsang (center) with siblings taken in Kau Yan Church, Hong Kong in 1946. Today he and his wife Tse Wai Yee live in Hong Kong. They have two sons, Tze Yee and Tze Yan. Education and work Tsang attended church-operated public schoolsKau Yan School, then College (1949‚Äì1961), and St. Paul's College (1961‚Äì1963). before studying at the University of Hong Kong from 1963 to 1968, graduating with a B.A. in philosophy and modern languages and an M.A. in philosophy.The University of Hong Kong Gazette, Vol. XIV, No. 2, p. 17 & Vol. XVII, No. 2, p. 21. From 1968 to 1970 he was a philosophy tutorThe Chinese University of Hong Kong Bulletin, Vol. 5, Issues 1‚Äì8. at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. From 1969 to 1974, he continued his study at HKU for a PhD in philosophical method, which ended with his withdrawal due to gradual digression of his research interests. From 1975 until 2004, he was a faculty memberSee HKBU e-News, Wed. 12 May, 2004. in general education and religious studies at Hong Kong Baptist University; from 1978 to 1979, its exchange professor to Malone College, USA; and, from 1995 to 2000, head of its Department of Religion and Philosophy. From 1985 to 1991 Tsang re-enrolled for the PhD program at HKU, this time in philosophy of religion, with the research topic of existential wonder.Tsang, Lap-Chuen (1991) \\"Wittgenstein, World and Wonder\\", New Blackfriars 72 (850): 269‚Äì277; reprinted in To place the topic in a historical context, his supervisor F.C.T. Moore introduced him to Kant‚Äôs Critique of Judgment on the concept of the sublime. Eventually, he worked out a thesisThe thesis is entitled A Theory of the Sublime (1991), The HKU Scholars Hub. See also The University of Hong Kong Gazette, Vol. XL, No. 1, p. 2. on a new theory of the sublime in the tradition of Longinus, Burke and Kant, later published as The Sublime: Groundwork towards a Theory by the recommendation of Joseph A. Munitiz, then the Master of Campion Hall, Oxford. Theory of the Sublime In the light of Wittgenstein on \\"language games\\", L√©vi-Strauss on \\"ritual and myth\\" and Freud on \\"ideas and dreams\\",See also references in the book to F.C.T. Moore, Dan Sperber, Martin Hollis, Bernard Williams, Robert C. Roberts, Harry Frankfurt and Malcolm Budd. Tsang develops a conceptual framework of [i] construal, [ii] evocation, [iii] affectivity and [iv] instantiation, giving a coherent account of the elements that can be distinguished in the phenomenon of the sublime, with the event of the Crucifixion as an exemplary instance. In the experience of the sublime, Longinus emphasises our contemplation and thought reaching the limit of the natural order of grandeur; Burke our self-preservation in situations which defy our existing capacities; and Kant our transcendence of the natural order as supersensible beings. Each of them is concerned with an aspect of the sublime which Tsang characterises, in general terms, as that which transports us to a self-realization at the limit of our existence. According to the theory Tsang proposes, the sublime is concerned with a limit-situation in life and our self-realization in it such that the core of all experience of the sublime is an intensified awareness of our self-realization at a life-limit. Life-limits are of three kinds, the top limit to our being which borders on that which transcends the natural and the human, the bottom limit to our being which borders on the non-existent, and the median limit which designates the bloom of our being in its domain.. By our very nature, we desire affirmation at the summit, preservation at the basis, and equilibrium in the domain of being; . Typical instances evocative of the sublime in the natural order are, e.g., Mount Everest, a precipitous cliff and the fall of leaves in autumn, respectively; . We come to an intensified awareness of our self-realization at a life-limit in our encounter with an object which is so construed that it elicits a set of thoughts and reactions pertaining to certain themes, including the limits of our powers and abilities, and the importance of being able to go up to or even beyond those limits.. For instance, the Crucifixion may be construed in terms of the sublime in its three senses. As an object construed in terms of the sublime at the top limit in the affirmative mode, the Crucifixion may be looked upon as an authentic expression of autonomy at its perfection. As an object construed in terms of the sublime at the bottom limit in the preservative mode, the Crucifixion may be regarded as the infliction of the utmost torture on a human being. And then, as an object construed in terms of the sublime at the median limit in the appreciative mode, the Crucifixion may be depicted as God's act of reconciliation with man, making peace on earth. . The sublime is concerned with the notion of a limit to what can be said and thought and willed. The sublime is not an object per se, but a particular manner in which certain objects are construed and are evocative of certain thoughts and reactions. There is no one common property of sublime objects, no one single emotional state in sublime experiences, which is an essential feature of the sublime. For the sublime is but a notion in the mind and heart of the person in relation to the object, any object,Any object, be it a thing, an event, a thought, an action, a situation, or the like. . which is confronted as sublime. However, from the standpoint of an external observer, one is able to distinguish in the experience of the sublime that which presupposes the universality of certain concepts and human characteristics and that which belongs to particular cultural and social forms and varies from culture to culture.See further explanation of the theory in Alasdair MacIntyre's \\"Foreword\\" to . Reference to St Anselm The Sublime: Groundwork towards a Theory is concerned with language, thought and ultimate reality; as such, the book is a sequel to Tsang's master's thesis on logic, language and religion, which concludes with the possibility of God's existence and the relevance of St Anselm's \\"faith seeking understanding\\" to the question of God's existence.Tsang Lap Chuen, Logic, Language and Religion (MA Thesis, University of Hong Kong, 1968), pp. 120-1. \\"Faith seeking understanding\\" is the original title of Anselm's Proslogion. The Epilogue of The Sublime alludes to, without affirming, two central ideas in the Proslogion: that God is Existence (‚ÄúI am that I am.‚Äù Exodus 3:14), as explained in Anselm's ontological argument; and that man is created in the image of God.St Anselm, Proslogion (1078), Prologue & Chapters 1-3. Before engaging in the sublime, Tsang had been interested in existential wonder, which is wonder at the world of our existence and our existence in the world. An experience of the sublime, which is an intensified awareness of our self-realization at a life-limit, is existential wonder occasioned by an object construed as connected with going to the limit of some human possibility, and here the person may further respond in faith, seeking to understand what lies at the limit. The Epilogue of The Sublime concludes with the self-fulfilling conception of the devout Christian in imitation of Christ the son of God under totally adverse conditions, attaining the sense of eternity in the active reflective order. Here is an example of the person of faith seeking to understand what lies at the limit of some human possibility, despite its inevitable subjectivity, even if unreachable, albeit ultimately desirable. Recognition The Sublime is recognised in some quarters as ‚Äòan important work offering a viable theory for the concept of \\"sublime\\" in philosophy‚Äô.See, e.g., its entry in PhilPapers; and Google Books. Among those who consider the theory to be acceptable are Alasdair MacIntyre,See MacIntyre's \\"Foreword\\" to The Sublime, Groundwork towards a Theory, pp. ix‚Äìxii. an influential moral philosopher, and Cyril Barrett,See Barrett's review of the book in Studies: An Irish Quarterly Review, Vol. 88, No. 350 (Summer, 1999), pp. 231‚Äì234. a renowned aesthetician and art critic.See The Irish Times, Sat. 1 January 2004; and the 'Introduction' for Cyril Barrett to \\"Works donated by Dr Cyril Barrett,\\" University of Warwick Art. However, as has been pointed out, the theory as proposed, even if it is viable, needs to be spelled out further.As pointed out by MacIntyre and Barrett. Bibliography * Tsang Lap Chuen (1998).

Virginia Tech also has had since 1974 a non- military marching band, The Marching Virginians.Information about the Virginia Tech Regimental Band that is paraphrased here is found in the historical collection of Virginia Tech yearbooks, The Bugle, on-line, 1895-1989 History =Roots of the band= Glade Cornet Band, 1884 From 1875 to 1892, the Corps hired civilian bands to provide music when needed. One of the best-known of these groups was the Glade Cornet Band, formed by several Blacksburg townspeople in 1883. In 1892, corps Commandant John Alexander Harman formed a six-piece drum and bugle corps. One member, Cadet Lieutenant Frank Daniel Wilson, sought out several other cadets with musical experience, and formed an unofficial band. Besides Wilson, the initial musicians included Sergeants Clifford West Anderson, John William Sample, Theodore Graham Lewton, and Lorenzo Montogery Hale; and Privates Harry Woodfin Phillips, William Marshall Watson, Charles Lewis Pedigo, William Rufus Prige, James Archer Walsh, and Robert Beverly, Jr. Professor and LtCol Ellison Adger Smyth was also a member of the band and a key figure in establishing the band, as well as the first football team in 1892. Wilson eventually convinced Harman and the board of trustees of the need for a distinct band company, and it was formed in May 1893 with Major James Patton Harvey as the first director and Wilson as the first company commander. In 1894 the Corps traveled to Richmond for the first time for the unveiling of the Soldiers and Sailors Monument. In 1896, the Band played at the Jefferson Davis Monument dedication in Richmond, Virginia. They were the only band so honored. In 1896, the band, along with the entire corps, traveled to Roanoke, Virginia for the first annual Thanksgiving Day VPI-VMI football game and pre-game parade to the stadium. This tradition continued until 1970, when Virginia Tech and VMI stopped playing in Roanoke. (The final Virginia Tech-VMI football game was played in Norfolk, VA in 1984.) =Service in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War= Citation Cord for Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War Service Band of the 2nd Virginia Infantry Volunteers, circa 1890 In 1898, the Band volunteered for duty in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. The War Department authorized the organization of bands of twenty-four pieces for the volunteer infantry regiments. A Major Shanks wrote to Major Harvey, Director of the VPI Band, requesting him \\"to prevail upon his Band to join the Second Virginia as its regimental band. The director, Major James Patton Harvey, and 20-members of the band joined some Blacksburg, Virginia townspeople and former bandsmen to form the Regimental band for the US Army's 2nd Virginia Regiment. Since service specifically as a VPI unit had been denied, along with the lettered units of the Corps, Major Harvey and fifteen cadets of the Band resigned from VPI and enlisted as individuals with the Second Regiment, along with four VPI alumni and five members of the Blacksburg Glade Cornet Band. Major Harvey was appointed Chief Musician and Leader of the new organization. The Second Virginia's new Regimental Band was a VPI organization constituted as an Army unit. The band was to be stationed in Cuba, however the war was over before they were scheduled to leave from Florida. They were called on to play many times during their stay. The Highty Tighties were presented with the white citation cord in 1936 for meritorious service in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. According to Band legend, the cord was pinned on the Band commander backward by Eleanor Roosevelt. It has been worn with the braid on the outside ever since. The official university story is that President Burrus presented the citation cord to the band. During the absence of Major Harvey, Frank Carper became director of the Band during his senior year in 1898. =Early history= The VPI Cadet Band and Corps of Cadets traveled to several expositions in the early 1900s. In 1901, the band played \\"The Thunderer\\" for John Philip Sousa at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. Sousa was so impressed that he dedicated a performance of his latest march, \\"Hands Across the Sea\\", to the band. The band played \\"Dixie\\" 72 consecutive times in 1902 at the Charleston Exposition, setting the world record. At this exposition, the band also played for Teddy Roosevelt, who was quoted to have said he \\"had never seen such a band.\\" John Philip Sousa met each member of the band personally in 1904 at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition (100th anniversary celebration that was delayed for one year) in St. Louis, Missouri. The VPI Cadet Band played in their first of several Presidential Inaugural Parades for President Woodrow Wilson in 1917. Wilfred Preston (\\"Pete\\") Maddux, a trombone and baritone player in the Highty-Tighties (member of the band from the Fall of 1917 to 1919), jointly composed \\"Tech Triumph\\" (1985 recording) in 1919 along with Mattie Walton Eppes (Boggs). Mattie Eppes was a neighbor of Pete in his hometown of Blackstone, Virginia. When he was home, Pete would often play violin with Mattie accompanying him on the piano. One evening in the summer of 1919, Pete asked her to help him compose a fight song for VPI. She played the tune and Pete wrote out the score and the words for two verses in a single evening. Pete Maddox is not listed in the yearbook with the band after 1919. Ms. Eppes later married John C. Boggs, Superintendent of Randolph-Macon Military Academy. =Name origin= The Band gained a nickname while marching at the Richmond parade, honoring Field Marshal Ferdinand Foch of France in 1921.This section is based on oral tradition passed down by the Highty Tighties. It has also been quoted in the \\"Early History of Virginia Tech\\" by Harry Downing. The drum major attempted a mace toss as he passed the reviewing stand. The wind blew the mace and it fell to ground, bouncing once. The drum major caught the mace off the bounce and still rendered a proper salute to the reviewing officer. Foch supposedly yelled 'hoity-toity' (show-off in French) in response to the drum major's display. For many years this was believed to be the origin of the band's name. However, history states that the name came from a cheer that was invented when the band was housed in Division E, the fifth stairwell of Lane Hall. While waiting for meals, each unit would give up a cheer. The bandsmen were tired of not having a name, and made up a cheer that went: \\"Highty Tighty, Christ Almighty, who the hell are we? Riff ramm, goddamn, we're from Division E.\\" It has since evolved over the years. Band company organizations The Highty- Tighties formed several musical units within the band over the years, including *1873, A 16-member drum and bugle corps was formed. The Bugle Corps was a separate unit, but in some years the buglers were part of the Corps units. In modern times, the buglers have been an integral part of the band. *Band members, including Pete Maddux played in the VPI Jazz Orchestra in the early 20th century. *1931, A dance band, called The Southern Colonels was formed. The Southern Colonels were also called the Collegians early prior to 1933. In 1937 and 1940, the Southern Colonels traveled to Germany and France on the USS New York to perform in nightclubs. The Southern Colonels are still active today, performing at weddings and other special occasions. Other big band group included the Virginia Techmen, which in 1933 replaced the Tech Buccaneers (1927‚Äì1933). In 1934, there was also a group called the Techadets. *Members of the band also performed in a mandolin orchestra and glee club in the late 19th century and early 20th century. *The Highty-Tighties traditionally performed as a concert band every Spring during the 1960s and 1970s at various colleges in the State of Virginia, including Radford University, Hollins College, Sweet Briar College, and Randolph-Macon College. This concert band tradition was a follow-on to the concerts that the Band gave in the Spring on the Tech campus in the 1930s. *1976, A Fife and Drum Corps was organized to perform at United States Bicentennial events, including one at which they played for Virginia's Governor Mills E. Godwin Jr.. Parades and performances In addition to home coming parades and home and away football pre-game and halftime shows, the Highty-Tighties have marched and played at all manner of events within Virginia and elsewhere. The following are some of the significant activities and events in the life of the Highty- Tighties in the 20th century. = 1893-1950 = * 1934, The Band was President Franklin Roosevelt's official band, when he dedicated the Veterans' Hospital in Salem, Virginia. * 1937, Jim Schaeffer returned as band director, remaining until his death in 1951. He died on November 27, 1951. When he was buried, he was accorded the highest tribute the corps can bestow‚Äîthe streets of Blacksburg were lined on both sides from the Lutheran Church to the cemetery by cadets standing at attention and saluting the body when it passed. The band led the funeral procession but played no music. It was a most impressive and respectful tribute to Schaeffer and his contributions. Director Jim Schaeffer is considered by many to be responsible for elevating the Band to the high level of quality in marching and musicianship that it still maintains. = 1951-1980 = Lane Hall circa 1888‚Äì89 Lane Hall in 2004 * 1958, The Band placed first in the Shenandoah Apple Blossom Festival Parade and was featured on the Today Show in New York. In 1959, the band again won the Apple Blossom Parade. The Band first marched in the Apple Blossom Parade in the Spring of 1935. * 1960, The band performed at the halftime show for the Washington Redskins‚ÄìDallas Cowboys football game. * 1963, The Band won the National Cherry Blossom Festival Parade in Washington, D.C. * 1964, The Band marched as the opening band for the New York World's Fair in 1964. * 1964, The Band inaugurated the first football Band Day at VPI on October 10. * 1966, The Highty Tighties were the last Virginia Tech students to live in Lane Hall in the Fall Quarter of 1966. Lane Hall, named after General James H. Lane when it first opened in 1888, still stands but it is used now for faculty offices. The Highty-Tighties took up residence in Brodie Hall when classes resumed in 1967. * December 1966 and 1968, The band was featured at the Liberty Bowl (Memphis, Tennessee) football game in which VPI played against the University of Miami (1966) and Mississippi (1968). The games were televised as the \\"game of the week.\\" * 1966, 1970, 1984, 1988, 1996, 1999, 2001, 2004, and 2010 The Highty- Tighties marched in the Cherry Blossom Parade in Washington, D.C. * 1971, The band performed at the halftime show for the Baltimore Colts-Buffalo Bills football game in Baltimore, Maryland. * In the Spring of 1971, the Band won the Azalea Festival Parade in Norfolk, Virginia. * 1971, Tom Dobyns retired as band director, after almost twenty years of continuous leadership. He was honored at a banquet commemorating his great service to the band. Mr. Joseph Lamoureux was named as director to succeed Tom Dobyns. * 1972, The Highty- Tighties performed in the half time show at the Washington-Dallas game at RFK Stadium * 1972 and 1974, The Highty-Tighties won the International Azalea Festival parade. * 1974, the band marched as the honor band in the Virginia Governor's Inaugural Parade. * 1975, the Highty-Tighty Alumni Association was formed. The purpose of the Alumni Association was to support the Highty- Tighties and to sustain their growth and development. Alumni were concerned about the decreasing size of the Band and the Corps and established scholarships for Highty-Tighties to assist in recruiting and retention. Charles O. Cornelison was the first Highty-Tighty Alumni Association President. The Alumni formed an Alumni band that began marching with the Highty-Tighties during the Homecoming Parade and during the pre-game and halftime show. Christopher Bise, HT '72, has been the Alumni Band Drum Major since 1975. * During World War II, women from Radford University (temporarily part of VPI) were reportedly allowed to march with the Highty-Tighties. In 1975, the first females were integrated into the Band as Highty-Tighties. Stephanie Hahn was the 1st of eight women to march with the Highty-Tighties in 1975. These women lived in L company, an all female company. According to Virginia Tech history, Marilyn Helmeyer was the first woman officially in the Band Company in 1977.

Presidential inaugural parades Highty-Tighties march in the 1969 Nixon Inaugural Parade The honor of marching in Presidential Inaugural parades has been bestowed on the Highty Tighties 11 times since 1917. This honor represents both the reputation and pride of the band and the hard work of Highty-Tighty alumni and friends in lobbying for this honor. *March 4, 1917, The VPI Cadet band played in their first Presidential Inaugural Parades for President Woodrow Wilson. *Jan 20, 1953, The Highty- Tighties won the grand prize in President Dwight D. Eisenhower's first Inaugural Parade. *Jan 20, 1957, The Highty-Tighties won their second consecutive Presidential Inaugural parade, again marching for President Eisenhower. *Jan 20, 1961, The Highty-Tighties won their third consecutive Presidential Inaugural, marching for President John F. Kennedy. In doing so, they become the only band to win the parade three times consecutively. No other band had won more than once at a time. *Jan 20, 1965, The Highty- Tighties marched for President Lyndon Johnson as retired champions of the Presidential Inaugural Parade. This was the first parade ruled non- competitive, a decision made only days before the parade, most likely because of the Highty-Tighties dominance of the parade in past years. *Jan 20, 1969, The Highty-Tighties marched in President Richard M. Nixon's Inaugural Parade in January 1969 as \\"undefeated champions\\", and were presented with the white ribbon with 3 silver stars. This ribbon symbolized the 3 consecutive years the Highty-Tighties won the parade. Earlier bands were awarded the white ribbon with a single star for an Inaugural Parade first place appearance. *Jan 20, 1973, The Highty-Tighties marched in President Richard M. Nixon's second inaugural parade. *Jan 20, 1977, The Highty-Tighties marched in President Jimmy Carter's Inaugural Parade. *Jan 20, 1981, The Highty Tighties marched in President Ronald Reagan's first Inaugural Parade, as a marching unit without instruments. *Jan 20, 1985, The Inaugural Parade, President Reagan's second, was cancelled due to extreme cold (only time in inaugural history). *Jan 20, 1997, The Highty-Tighties marched in President Bill Clinton's second inaugural. *Jan 20, 2005, The Highty-Tighties marched in President George W.

It also looks at the social, emotional and practical impact cancer can have, and campaigns for better cancer care. Macmillan Cancer Support's goal is to reach and improve the lives of everyone who has cancer in the UK. History The charity was founded in 1911 as the Society for the Prevention and Relief of Cancer, by Douglas Macmillan following the death of his father from the disease. In 1924, the name was changed to the National Society for Cancer Relief, which it retained until 1989 when it was changed to Cancer Relief Macmillan Fund, later changed again to Macmillan Cancer Relief. From 5 April 2006, Macmillan Cancer Relief became known as Macmillan Cancer Support, as this more accurately describes its role in supporting people who have cancer. It has adopted the principles of being a \\"source of support\\" and a \\"force for change\\". Douglas Macmillan was a vegetarian. In 1909, he wrote an open letter to all Christians entitled Shall We Slay which encouraged orthodox Christians to consider vegetarianism. As the National Society for Cancer Relief, the organization provided funding to support the work of the Breast Care and Mastectomy Association of Great Britain which would later become Breast Cancer Care. Macmillan Cancer Support is one of the 50 largest UK charitable organizations ranked by annual expenditure. It is governed by a Board of Trustees and Executive Management Team. The charity's head office is based in London.Charities Direct: Top 500 Charities ‚Äì Expenditure Macmillan Cancer Support merged with cancer information charity Cancerbackup in 2008. Macmillan works in partnership with other cancer research organisations and is a partner of the National Cancer Research Institute.  Cancer Support  Macmillan Cancer Support supports local information and support centres, cancer support groups, benefits advisers and cancer support specialists, and can help with practical, medical, financial and emotional support. Macmillan provides information about cancer through its Information Standard website, free printed and recorded materials, telephone support line and over 170 local cancer information and support services nationwide.  Events  Macmillan host a series of annual fundraising events, which include running, golf and cycling events. The most notable event is World's Biggest Coffee Morning, which has made ¬£75,000,000 since it began in 1991. Macmillan also hosts other large fundraisers, including Brave the Shave which raises over ¬£4,000,000 each year, as well as Go Sober for October which has raised over ¬£3 million.  Previous controversy over fundraising methods  Macmillan faced criticism when it placed adverts in Facebook and on Google associating the viral fundraising activity, the Ice Bucket Challenge with itself. It had been suggested that the aim of the Macmillan marketing campaign was to divert web traffic and subsequently awareness and donations away from smaller charities with whom the challenge had been mostly associated, namely those relating to motor neuron disease and ALS. Amanda Neylon, the head of digital at Macmillan, said the charity got behind the Ice Bucket Challenge, which asks participants to pour a bucket of iced water on their heads, because it was criticised for being too slow on the uptake for the #nomakeupselfie social media campaign. On missing out on the #nomakeupselfie campaign, Neylon said: \\"We were too slow ‚Äì it was a big motivator to be much better the next time an opportunity came along.\\" In 2016, Macmillan scrapped the head of digital role responsible for the controversial fund raising method mentioned above.

On 2 May 2005, the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army (CSA) approved the creation of the CAB to provide special recognition to U.S. soldiers who personally engaged, or are engaged by, the enemy. The CAB is intended to serve as a companion to the Combat Infantryman Badge (CIB) and Combat Medical Badge (CMB) and was created to recognize the greatly expanded role of non-infantry soldiers in active, ground combat.AR 600‚Äì8‚Äì22, Ch 8-8a, 5 March 2019 U.S. Army infantrymen or special forces soldiers with the rank of colonel or below and who are a member of a brigade-sized or smaller infantry or special forces unit, receive the Combat Infantryman Badge (CIB) instead of the CAB.  History  Since the Combat Infantryman Badge was introduced in 1943, followed by the Combat Medical Badge in 1945, other army branches argued in favor of their own badges, but a War Department review board just after the war ruled these out. Unofficial combat badges for non-infantry soldiers were in some instances worn in violation of uniform regulations or included in personal award displays wherein the rifle and blue field of the CIB were replaced with the appropriate army branch insignia and color. These unofficial combat badges began to appear shortly after the creation of the Combat Infantryman Badge and while the practice continued until the creation of an official non-infantry combat badge it never became widespread. Throughout the Vietnam War and afterward, soldiers serving in combat engineer and armored units continued to lobby for their own version of the EIB/CIB. Despite numerous staff studies and recommendations, the request never gained the support of senior army leadership. However, as soldiers from across the spectrum of military occupational specialties engaged in direct contact with enemy forces in the Global War on Terrorism, the proposal gained new traction. It appears that the concept for the current Combat Action Badge came when Captain Shawn Monien reignited the debate on establishing combat/expert badges for all soldiers of the United States Army in his September‚ÄìOctober 2003 Armor magazine article, \\"Reinstating the Combat Tanker Badge\\" drawing historical references to General George S. Patton in World War I and other historical vignettes from World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the Persian Gulf War. Monien's article encouraged former United States Army Chief of Armor, Major General Thomas H. Tait to re-join the effort: ::Dear ARMOR, ::I have been reluctant to enter the debate regarding the combat and expert armor badges. However, after reading the article by CPT Shawn Monien, ‚ÄúReinstating the Combat Tanker Badge,‚Äù in the September‚ÄìOctober 2003 issue of ARMOR, I decided to put my oar in the water. ::In the January‚ÄìFebruary 1988 issue of ARMOR, Commander‚Äôs Hatch, (an editorial primarily written by Majors Scott Rowell and Bob Wilson), I stated we were developing a Scout‚Äôs ‚Äúrite of passage.‚Äù The Scout Badge (SCB) proposed to be similar to the Expert Infantry Badge (EIB) and concentrated on individual scout skills. I also asked for your input. We designed the badge, similar to the EIB, except it had a saber instead of a rifle and was red and white. The requirements for the SCB were considered more difficult than those for the Combat Infantry Badge (CIB), as we did not want it to be considered, under any circumstances, to be easy. The design and requirements were sent through channels to the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) and the proposal was turned down, either by TRADOC or Department of the Army ‚Äî I do not remember which because consensus could not be reached by the sitting four stars. We fought the good fight and lost, saluted, and moved on. ::Turning the calendar ahead to 1991 following Desert Storm, as Director of the Desert Storm Study Group, it was my pleasure to interview soldiers and leaders after the conflict and discuss things that went right and things that needed improving. My personal focus was with senior leaders (battalion-level commanders and above) and members of my team spent much of their time with troops. One thing that was very apparent was the disparity in awarding combat badges. For instance, the 1st Squadron, 4th Cavalry did not have enough 19Ds to man their tracks. They were given 11Ms and 11Bs as substitutes for the scouts. After the war, the infantrymen were given CIBs and scouts serving on the same track were given handshakes. The letter from Todd A. Mayer, reprinted in CPT Monien‚Äôs article, which states that mortarmen in 4-64 Armor who never fired a shot received CIBs is another example of badges that were erroneously presented. When this type of information was presented to the DA General Officer Steering Group (GOSC) with a recommendation to create and award Combat Armor, Cavalry (Scout), and Engineer badges as they closed with, met, and destroyed the enemy, it was challenged by the Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel, LTG Reno. When he stated it was not General Marshall‚Äôs intent to give awards of this type to tankers, he was reminded that during WWII, Korea, and Vietnam it took 30 days of combat to receive a CIB. I also stated that I doubted General Marshall intended for infantrymen who rode around in Bradley Fighting Vehicles, mortar tracks, and busses to get them either. He relented. I am not trying to disparage our great infantry soldiers, but in my opinion, there are many others who fight and deserve equal recognition. ::Once again, this went forward to the Chief of Staff of the Army and, once again, the four- star generals shot it down. I went to most of the division commanders who fought and to the two corps commanders and they were either supportive or offered no objection. ::It is also interesting to note that Armor officers were told they could not wear the Vietnamese Armor Badge, but all other branches wore whatever the Vietnamese gave them. I found it interesting that the late LTG Tom Kelly wore his as a member of the joint staff while being interviewed on an almost daily basis by the media during Desert Storm. We also used to wear gunnery qualification badges on our fatigues. When we went to BDUs, we were told to take them off. However, if one looks at the number of badges on the uniforms of other branches of the Army, none of this makes sense. ::Let‚Äôs dust off the 1988 study by Office of the Chief of Armor and resubmit. I doubt if anything has changed that much and this issue has been ‚Äústudied‚Äù long enough. THOMAS H. TAIT, Major General, U.S. Army, Retired Major Matthew De Pirro continued the narrative of a combat badge in 2004 with an article written for Armor magazine in Spring 2004 describing the need for such a badge based upon the evolving face of warfare and the ongoing transformation of the army. De Pirro stated: ::Fellow troopers, I submit to you that our Army would be better served by recognizing our soldiers who have faced an enemy in direct-fire combat with a Combat Action Badge. We are an Army in transformation. A few years ago, we donned the black beret as a symbol of that transformation. It is time for the disparity of the Combat Infantry Badge to end. It is time for the perceived badge wars to end. It is now time to take our transformation one step further. It is time for the Combat Action Badge. The Combat Action Badge was originally planned as a ribbon which was to have been known as the \\"Combat Recognition Ribbon\\" (similar to the Navy/Marine Corps Combat Action Ribbon created in 1969). However, as ribbons are generally seen as less prestigious than medals and badges, the CAB was then proposed as the \\"Close Combat Badge\\" (or CCB), thus granting the award badge status vice ribbon. This was to be a combat award only for soldiers who did not hold the infantry military occupational specialty (MOS), but who were deployed specifically to fulfill an infantry duty. This was in response to the large number of non-infantry (Tank crews, Field Artillerymen example) who were deployed to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and whose units were reorganized to function as infantry (motorized or light) due to the lack of need for tanks, Artillery and shortage of infantry. The change from the Close Combat Badge to the Combat Action Badge may have come about thanks to a question put to Donald Rumsfeld in an April 2005 Afghanistan town hall meeting by a female military policeman as to why the CCB would not include military police soldiers in its awarding criteria despite the combat nature of the military police's job in Afghanistan and Iraq's 360-degree battlefield. The Combat Action Badge was approved on May 2, 2005, and was retroactively awarded to soldiers who were engaged in combat after September 18, 2001. On June 29, 2005, General Peter J. Schoomaker awarded the CAB for the first time to Sergeants April Pashley, Michael Buyas, Manuel J. Montano, Timothy Gustafson and Sean Steans. Over one hundred thousand CABs have been awarded since the creation of the award. Most commanders do not issue the CAB to qualified soldiers unless they are directly engaged in combat. Notably, it is granted exclusively for contact with enemy combatants, so actions by noncombatants like detainees or rioting civilians do not qualify. The soldier must be personally present and actively engaging or being engaged by the enemy, and performing satisfactorily in accordance with the prescribed rules of engagement. There is no specific requirement for the enemy hostile contact to be direct.Army Regulation 600-8-22 Military Awards (24 June 2013). Eligibility requirements The Combat Action Badge may be awarded to any soldier not assigned or attached to a unit that would qualify the soldier for the Combat Infantryman Badge (CIB) or Combat Medical Badge (CMB) after the date of September 18, 2001, and: * The soldier must be personally present and under hostile fire while performing satisfactorily in accordance with the prescribed rules of engagement, * The soldier must be performing their assigned duties associated with the unit‚Äôs combat mission in an area where hostile fire pay or imminent danger pay is authorized, * For all named conflicts beginning after the effective date of this publicationAR 600‚Äì8‚Äì22, Ch 8-8, 5 March 2019 https://armypubs.army.mil/epubs/DR_pubs/DR_a/pdf/web/ARN18147_R600_8_22_admin2_FINAL.pdf (5 March 2019), a soldier must also be performing in an offensive or defensive act while participating in combat operations, engaging, or being engaged by the enemy. The CAB may be awarded to any army branch or military occupational specialty including infantrymen except when serving in a role where they would be eligible for the CIB. In addition to Army soldiers, the CAB may also be awarded to Servicemembers of other U.S. Armed Forces and foreign military personnel assigned to a U.S. Army unit, provided they meet the above criteria (for example, KATUSA in the 2d Infantry Division). The Combat Action badge is unique in that unlike the Combat Infantryman and Combat Medical badges, it can be awarded to soldiers of any rank, including general officers, whereas the CIB and CMB are both restricted to colonels and below. Award of the CAB is not automatic and will not be awarded solely based on award of the Purple Heart.AR 600‚Äì8‚Äì22, Ch 8-8, 5 March 2019 https://armypubs.army.mil/epubs/DR_pubs/DR_a/pdf/web/ARN18147_R600_8_22_admin2_FINAL.pdf Qualifying conflicts, operations and periods The only current qualifying period for the CAB is the Global War on Terrorism. Thus, only one CAB can be awarded to any soldier at this time. Retroactive awards of the CAB are not authorized prior to 18 September 2001. Award of the CAB is authorized for the following qualifying wars, conflicts, and operations. To date, a separate award of the CAB has been authorized for qualified Soldiers in the following qualifying period: * (1) Global War on Terrorism (18 September 2001 to a date to be determined) **(a) War in Afghanistan (OEF, 18 September 2001 to 31 December 2014; OFS, 1 January 2015 to a date to be determined). **(b) Iraq War (OIF, 19 March 2003 to 31 August 2010; OND, 1 September 2010 to 31 December 2011). **(c) Anti-terrorism operations in Iraq and Syria (OIR, 15 June 2014 to a date to be determined). Award for qualifying service in any previous conflict is not authorized. Subsequent award of the CAB is not authorized for the same qualifying period, as outlined above.AR 600‚Äì8‚Äì22, Ch 8-8, para 3f-g, 5 March 2019 Badge design and wear A freshly-awarded CAB pinned onto a soldier's Army Combat Uniform blouse; when worn the CAB is worn on the left side of a jacket, shirt, or blouse. The emblem features both an M9 bayonet and M67 grenade. A silver badge 2 inches (5.08 cm) in width overall consisting of an oak wreath supporting a rectangle bearing a bayonet surmounting a grenade, all silver. In comparison to the CIB, the CAB has a silver rectangle backing rather than blue, and the CAB is 1 inch shorter in length than the CIB. Second and subsequent award of the CAB will be indicated by superimposing one and two stars respectively, centered at the top of the badge between the points of the oak wreath; one star for the second award and two stars for the third award. However, like the CIB and CMB, only one can be awarded per \\"qualifying period;\\" as defined in AR 600-8-22.Army Regulation 600-8-22 \\"Military Awards\\" (24 June 2013). When worn, the CAB is worn on the left side of a jacket or blouse. On combat uniforms it is worn on the blouse above the \\"U.S. ARMY\\" nametape and on dress and service uniforms it is worn on the shirt or jacket above any ribbons and medals.

He also fronts the side projects World Destroyer and Kreft, and since 2003 also has a solo project of his own. Biography Rasmussen was born in Sandnes, Rogaland County, Norway. His first musical ventures were with the black metal band The Childmolesters, which he founded in 1990 alongside his future Carpathian Forest bandmate Johnny \\"Nordavind\\" Kr√∏vel. The band was very short-lived, ending in the same year; from its ashes arose Enthrone, which changed its name to Carpathian Forest in 1992. During Carpathian Forest's first years of existence, Nattefrost used the pseudonym Lord Nosferatu; he would not be known as \\"Nattefrost\\" (Norwegian for \\"Night frost\\") until 1995, when the band released its first EP, Through Chasm, Caves and Titan Woods. In 2000 Nattefrost formed his first side project, World Destroyer, alongside Eivind Kulde and his Carpathian Forest bandmate Daniel Vrangsinn. The band released a demo album, Diabolical Quest, in 2004; it is their only release so far. He would form the duo Kreft in 2011 alongside Patolog Falk, releasing in the same year the EP Lommemannen. In 2003 Nattefrost announced that he would begin a solo project, and in the following year he released his first album, Blood & Vomit. His second album, Terrorist (Nekronaut, Part I), came out in the following year and counted with guest appearances by numerous musicians, such as Carl-Michael Eide, Sanrabb of Gehenna and Hoest of Taake. He also released a live EP in 2006, entitled Drunk and Pisseskev at Ringnes 2004, which was recorded during his first show, in Ringnes, and a compilation of rarities, Hell Noise and Live Terrorism, came out in 2008. Nattefrost's latest release was the 2009 split album Engangsgrill, with Darkthrone's Fenriz's doom metal side project Fenriz's Red Planet. In 2016 he collaborated with Urgehal, providing vocals and lyrics for the song \\"Endetid\\", off their seventh album Aeons in Sodom.

Characters without speaking parts or who only appear in one episode or chapter are not included. The characters are first described as they appear in the TV series, followed by their portrayals in the other story versions. Main characters =Ayato Kamina= * : At the beginning of the series, Ayato Kamina is a student and artist living with his mother in Tokyo. Most of his artwork shown in the series consists of drawings or paintings of a girl on a cliff looking towards the sea. He has birthmark-like symbols on his belly resembling runes, which are revealed to be a sign of his being a potential instrumentalist for the RahXephon. After being taken from Tokyo by Haruka and the RahXephon, Ayato moves in with Rikudo Shougo, Haruka's uncle on Nirai Kanai. At first, this arrangement does not sit well with Ayato, as Haruka and her younger sister Megumi live in Rikudo's annex, but they slowly adapt to each other's presences. As a stranger from Tokyo Jupiter, Ayato struggles to find his place and acceptance in the outside world. Although he pilots the RahXephon in defending Nirai Kanai, he questions his abilities and self-worth. He also struggles with trying to piece together and understand his relationship with Haruka, handling the feisty Megumi, and interacting with the other TERRA personnel, who regard him with a broad spectrum of reactions, from acceptance and friendship to cool scientific interest to distrust and even contempt. It is revealed that Quon is genetic provider of both Ayato and Itsuki Kisaragi while she is sleeping. Conceived with the help of Ernst von B√§hbem and raised by Maya as an instrumentalist -- someone who can successfully use the RahXephon to re-tune the world. There are several other instrumentalist candidates, but at this point of the series most have passed their ideal age. At the end of the series, Ayato succeeds in becoming one with the RahXephon, and re-tunes the world. In this new world, the great dimensional split never happened, and Tokyo Jupiter never existed. Ayato is now an adult and married to Haruka and have an infant daughter named Quon. ;In other versions In the movie, Ayato is Maya's naturally conceived biological son. In this version, he has to remain in his position as a \\"Watcher of time\\" and can not return to the world. In the manga, Ayato is not just the result of in vitro fertilization but also of in vitro growing; multiple tanks with Ayato clones growing inside them are shown. =Haruka Shitou= * : A 29-year-old officer within the TERRA organization, Haruka Shitou is partially responsible for aiding Ayato in leaving Tokyo Jupiter. Originally a Captain in the Intelligence Division, she is promoted to Major in the Tactical Division. Haruka is shown to have very strong feelings for Ayato and struggles at maintaining a relationship with him for many reasons. Her position within TERRA makes Ayato think that she is only using him because of his ability to pilot the RahXephon. Ayato's own personal struggles also create barriers for their relationship. It is later revealed that the girl that Ayato is constantly drawing and painting is actually a young Haruka. They had fallen in love when they were younger. The earliest date when the show places them together is at August 10, 2011, at age 13. When the Tokyo Jupiter barrier was established (just after the end of 2012), Haruka was on a vacation in a different part of Japan. Ixtli uses Ayato's distorted memories of Haruka to create the form of Reika Mishima. Haruka aged much more than Ayato in the outside world due to Tokyo Jupiter's time dilation effect. She had a relationship with Itsuki Kisaragi, possibly due to his similarity to Ayato. ;In other versions There is no real difference between Haruka's portrayal in the series and in the movie. In the manga, Haruka is more ditzy but has a similar role in the story until the end, where she is revealed to be a reincarnation of Reika. =Reika Mishima= * : Reika Mishima first appears in the series as the subject of one of Ayato's paintings. She then appears, in person, during the attack on Tokyo in episode 1. She leads Ayato to the RahXephon, and is shown to have some sort of connection to it via her singing. Throughout the series, it is hinted that Reika is not a normal human being. She does not have a reflection unless she needs to, Ayato is able to call her at an unassigned phone number, and she appears to alter Ayato's classmates' memories to make them remember her. She later appears as an aide to Makoto Isshiki, apparently altering TERRA personnels' memories in the same fashion. It is revealed that Reika is actually Ixtli, the soul of the RahXephon, and that her appearance is a manifestation of Ayato's innermost desires. This enables him to connect with and fully use the RahXephon; in artistic terms, she is his muse. Her form is chosen to closely mimic that of a young Haruka Mishima (later Shitou) with whom Ayato had fallen in love. This is to ensure that the performer, or instrumentalist, is more cooperative to Ixtli and more trusting of her than would initially be the case. Ixtli appears to Quon as Reika at first but later takes the guise of Ayato as he has become very important to her. Despite disappearing often, Ixtli/Reika Mishima is quite caring of Ayato, and will go the extra mile to see that he fully matures into his role as 'Ollin' and punishes those who would ruin her goal of a successful 'tuning'. Although Ayato initially rejects Reika after he learns the truth about her and what she is, he later chooses to accept her and become one with the RahXephon, thus enabling him to re-tune the world. Reika is the focus of an important and recurring visual leitmotif used throughout the series. She stands on a higher point, with her back facing Ayato, and slowly turns around to smile upon him. This image is also repeated in Ayato's paintings. The origin of the leitmotif is shown in the \\"Dandelion Girl Coda\\" at the end of the series. ;In other versions In the movie, Reika is one of the Watchers of Time, a 'soul' of one of the two RahXephons. Further complicating matters, Ayato and Haruka's granddaughter is also named Reika and appears identical to Reika Mishima. In the manga, Reika is a more comical character who has grown up as Ayato's adoptive sister and who is openly jealous of any woman who gets between them. It is revealed that Reika is a Mulian miko who was forced unprepared into a ritual involving the RahXephon. The ritual failed disastrously, due to Reika's spiritual emptiness and destrudo. She is trapped in a cycle of reincarnation, and is destined to die prematurely. Despite Ayato's best efforts, Reika dies in his arms after they promise each other to meet again in a later life. As Haruka and Itsuki prepare to get married, it is revealed that Haruka is actually Reika's reincarnation and that Itsuki is Ayato's. This is a partial reversal of the TV series, where Reika takes Haruka's image. =Quon Kisaragi= * : Quon Kisaragi is a mysterious young girl who speaks the first words of the TV series and is shown meeting Ayato in episode 4. Her standard expression of surprise or agreement is \\"Ra-ra\\" (or \\"La-la\\") and most of her dialogue is cryptic and musically themed. She and Ayato do not connect romantically, but she displays a level of both physical and interpersonal comfort and intimacy with Ayato. She is also one of the few people who never treats Ayato as a curiosity or an annoyance, and she seems to have an understanding of his situation and what his eventual role is, calling him \\"Ollin\\" (\\"motion\\" in Nahua). Like Ayato, she has the marks of a potential instrumentalist. She and Ayato are both shown undergoing examinations, and while outside of her home she wears a vest-like device called a Life Module. Quon is skilled in playing both the violin and piano. She also is portrayed as curious about music that other people listen to on headphones, often taking them off to listen to the music. It is later revealed that Quon is a Mulian. She is the sister of Maya Kamina, and the genetic provider of both Ayato Kamina and Itsuki Kisaragi. When she entered the human world, she slept for quite a while and stayed young, while Maya is awake and grew older. Because of this, she is often called the \\"Sleeping Beauty\\". In episode 9, Quon goes with Ayato into a shrine (shaped like a Ryukyuan tomb) where she learns that she is also \\"Ollin\\". After a period of lying comatose she goes with Ayato to Tokyo Jupiter, where she finds her own black RahXephon. At the end of the series, she merges with this RahXephon, and appears to battle Ayato after he merges with his RahXephon. She is eventually absorbed into Ayato, and he re-tunes the world. In the new world, the infant child of Ayato and Haruka is named Quon and also has pink hair, suggesting that Quon is reborn into the re-tuned world. ;Design In the designs created by Akihiro Yamada and adapted by Hiroki Kanno, Quon is shown wearing a short dress with long sleeves, the Life Module, high heeled shoes, a thigh strap (worn like a garter), a beret, and a parasol, leading to a stereotypical \\"French\\" look. In some illustrations, like Yamada's DVD 2 cover design (used in France and Japan, but not in the initial U.S. and UK release), Quon wears a frilly lace-trimmed dress and stockings, which with the parasol complete a \\"Gothic Lolita\\" look. In Ouran High School Host Club, another anime series by Bones, the \\"French\\" otaku Renge is shown cosplaying as Quon on one occasion. ;In other versions In the movie, Quon is a failed instrumentalist who is forced against her will to destroy the world of the humans. She spends most of the movie asleep, awakening only for her final conflict with Ayato. In the manga, as in the TV series, Quon and Maya show friendship and love towards each other, but here Quon goes into battle against the malevolent Maya. =The RahXephon= The RahXephon is a bipedal humanoid mecha. It is about 50 m high, immensely strong, and capable of unassisted flight. Its offensive capabilities include energy blades which project from its forearms, concussion energy bullets from its hands or fingertips, releasing immensely powerful shockwaves and/or energy waves with its voice and an energy bow. It can also form energy shields around its forearms, and create impenetrable spheres of energy in its hands which are used for carrying and protection. The RahXephon is also referred to as ÁøºÁ•û‰∏ñÈü≥ (Yokushin Seon), literally \\"wing god world sound\\". This is essentially a translation of the name \\"RahXephon\\", and it is also the Chinese term for the series and the mecha. While dormant, the RahXephon's face is shown covered by a pair of large wings which are attached to its forehead; these wings separate and spread when the RahXephon becomes active, and appear to be tied into its overall function. Its forehead features a golden disk, alluding to the sun god Ra and Ollin Tonatiuh. Its eyes are normally red but are occasionally golden with visible irises; it also has a pair of smaller red eyes on its visor. Below its face is an egg-shaped protected barrier which Ayato is absorbed through when entering; he is then dropped through another barrier into the pilot's seat, which resembles a pair of cupped hands emerging from a seemingly endless pool of dark water and contains two control rods. The RahXephon is connected physically, mentally, and emotionally to its instrumentalist. Its arms and head mimic Ayato's movements. The field of view from the pilot's seat is a grid of hexagons which follows Ayato's view; the RahXephon's shields also have a hexagonal grid shape. Ayato is shown to be absorbed into the RahXephon in a variety of manners, and it moves on its own to meet Ayato several times. Ayato can also trigger awakening and entering the RahXephon through voice command. Ayato appears to feel damage inflicted on the RahXephon as physical pain. During the battle with the Dolem Forzando, the RahXephon is pierced through the shoulder with a spike of debris; Ayato is shown in the cockpit holding his shoulder in the same place shortly thereafter. It is revealed that the RahXephon was created by Ernst von B√§hbem as a tool for re-tuning the world. This re-tuning would involve the RahXephon joining with a special person who has the potential to accomplish the re-tuning, referred to as an instrumentalist. The Mu refer to the robot as \\"Xephon\\", adding the honorific of \\"Rah\\" near the end of the series when Ayato is ready to tune the world. The RahXephon's TERRA designation is the \\"5-A\\" OOPArt or \\"Mulian Artifact Class 5 A (MA-C5A)\\". The RahXephons were designed by mecha designers Michiaki Sato and Yoshinori Sayama. In the manga, the RahXephon is an artifact mysterious even to the Mu, used in a ritual that grants the desires of its occupants. Tokyo Jupiter =Maya Kamina= * : Maya Kamina is Ayato's mother and is often away from home, leaving Ayato feeling neglected and wishing to spend more time with her. Although Ayato initially believes she works in a lab, she is actually a very powerful Mulian leader. Just before Ayato leaves Tokyo Jupiter for the first time, Maya is injured by flying debris, and Ayato is severely rattled when he sees her blue blood. From then on, he is fearful and mistrusting of her. Maya reveals that she is actually Ayato's aunt, and that she adopted Ayato. She was originally sent to the human world along with her sister Quon (Ayato's biological mother). The only Mulian that was there before them was Ernst von B√§hbem. Maya was raised by Shougo Rikudo while Quon slept in the care of B√§hbem. Maya married Rikudo's research assistant, Shirow Watari. When Maya's Mu phase awakened, she left her husband and joined the Mu. ;In other versions In the movie, Maya is Ayato's biological mother, and her turn to the Mu is more violent: She ran away while pregnant with Ayato and killed his father. In the manga, Maya does not turn from the \\"normal\\" humans to the Mu. She turns from a kind Mulian who shows compassion for Reika into a malevolent character who tries to kill Reika and stages a coup d'√©tat within the Mulian government. Her agenda is the eradication of red-blooded humans, and she shows far less attachment to Ayato than in the animated versions. =Hiroko Asahina= * : Hiroko Asahina is a classmate and friend of Ayato and Mamoru Torugai. During the attack on Tokyo in episode 1, she is lightly injured, and bleeds red blood. While Ayato is in the real world, her Mu phase activates. When Ayato returns to Tokyo Jupiter, Hiroko is relieved to see him again but is distressed by the memory loss resulting from her Mu phase activating and a feeling that Mamoru's explanation for Ayato's absence is not right. Later, she is shot by agents guarding Mamoru; Ayato finds her, and she asks Ayato \\"It's red, right?\\" while she is covered in blood (now blue) from her wounds. Ayato assures her that her blood is red, but they are afraid to admit to each other its real colour. When Ayato leaves Tokyo Jupiter for the second time, she leaves with him, and the two of them live together for a short time. While she is with Ayato, she has terrifying visions of herself as a Mulian bound to a Dolem, but cannot bring herself to talk about this with Ayato. However, she keeps a diary where she can write down her feelings. Her Dolem Vibrato eventually shows up, and Ayato destroys it, killing Hiroko in the process, which deeply traumatizes Ayato. At the end of the series, when Ayato re-tunes the world, Hiroko is brought back to life along with Mamoru. It is revealed, through flashbacks in the series as well as in the movie prologue, that Hiroko was in love with Ayato while they were in their early teens, before Tokyo Jupiter was created, and that her feelings have not subsided even though she is dating Mamoru. ;In other versions Asahina's role in the movie is identical to that in the TV series. In the manga, she is Ayato's tsundere girlfriend; Ayato entered the relationship in part to escape Reika's advances. Here, Asahina escapes from Tokyo Jupiter with refugees and arrives in Nirai Kanai where she projects three Dolem and holds Reika hostage, forcing Ayato to kill her. =Mamoru Torigai= * : Mamoru Torigai is another friend and classmate of Kamina's in Tokyo Jupiter. He was seeing Hiroko Asahina before she left Tokyo Jupiter with Ayato. Deep down, he dislikes Ayato because of Asahina's feelings for him. Mamoru is a true Mulian, like Ernst von B√§hbem, Maya, and Quon, and holds a high position within the Mulian society. He follows Ayato to Nirai Kanai the second time he leaves Tokyo Jupiter and lives with Ayato for a short period of time. While in Nirai Kanai, Mamoru discovers that Asahina died. He blames Ayato for her death and fights the RahXephon with his Dolem Obbligato. His Dolem is no match for the RahXephon and loses an arm in the battle. He returns with a fully repaired Dolem and battles the RahXephon again, this time after Ayato had joined with the RahXephon, and dies in the battle. He is brought back to life, along with Asahina, when Ayato re-tunes the world. His given name, \\"Mamoru\\", also means \\"to protect\\" in Japanese. In the light of his failure to protect Asahina and his turning against Ayato, his name becomes ironic. ;In other versions In the movie, Mamoru's role is similar to that in the TV series. In the manga, Mamoru only appears as a classmate who makes unsuccessful advances towards Asahina. =Masayoshi Kuki= * : Masayoshi Kuki appears as second in command to Maya in Tokyo Jupiter. He sometimes questions Maya's orders and also shows some disapproval of how she treats Ayato. It is revealed that Kuki was the JSDF officer that ordered Jin Kunugi to perform the nuclear strike on the Mu in the Great Mu War. Kuki attacks Nirai-Kanai with the Largo, and appears invincible to its defense systems. Kunugi, however, activates a Jupiter device, killing Kuki and enacting his revenge before dying of his injuries. ;In other versions In the movie, Kuki also acts as the second in command, but without the history and conflict with Kunugi. He does not appear in the manga. =Shinobu Miwa= * : Shinobu Miwa appears to be third in command in the Tokyo Bay base control center. She is shown working with Kuki in the control center, and holding down the fort with other subordinates while Kuki and Maya are away. At the end of the series, Miwa briefly expresses doubt over the Mu agenda before finally becoming bound to the Dolem Allegretto. ;In other versions In the movie, Miwa appears briefly in the base. In the manga, Maya is shown to have a female second in command, but this character is not named. TERRA =Jin Kunugi= * : Jin Kunugi is the stern and quiet commander of TERRA's military operations. He prefers delegating tasks to his subordinates and \\"managing by exception\\". Kunugi was an officer of the Japan Self-Defense Forces, under the command of Kuki Masayoshi, who ordered him to perform a nuclear strike on the Mu. His daughter Michiru was killed in the following war, and Kunugi became estranged from his wife. It is falsely stated in the anime that his wife is his daughter. It is revealed that Kuki was acting on behalf of the Mu (or some element within the Mu government), who wanted the humans to attack, providing justification for their further plans. Kunugi eventually stays behind after Nirai Kanai is evacuated and activates a Jupiter device there, sacrificing himself to kill Kuki and destroy Largo, the Dolem which was bound to Kuki. ;In other versions In the movie, Kunugi's conflict with Kuki is removed, substituting conflict with B√§hbem. Kunugi thus takes part of the role Futagami had in the TV series. In the manga, Kunugi also appears as the commander, but with little background and drama surrounding his character. =Megumi Shitou= * : Megumi Shitou is Haruka's younger sister. She initially protests Ayato living with her, Haruka, and their uncle, but she does her best to help Ayato feel at home, and develops a crush on Ayato as the series progresses. She often serves pocky and other snacks, and introduces Ayato to ramune. Although seemingly energetic and upbeat, she has many internal issues. She did not fit in well in school, so she joined TERRA as a trainee. She would later be promoted to the rank of a full officer. She initially has a crush on Souchi Yakumo, but gives up on him when she finds out that he is seeing her friend, Kim Hotal. She feels as if she is constantly living in her sister's shadow, and this comes to a head when she learns that Ayato and Haruka had a relationship when they were younger, as by the end of the series she has developed a crush on Ayato. In the end, she openly renounces her feelings for Ayato for the sake of her sister. ;In other versions In the movie, as in the series, Megumi helps make Ayato feel at home, but does not fall in love with Ayato or Yakumo -- at least not in the scenes shown. In the manga, Megumi and Kim have minor roles as classmates, \\"bodyguards\\", and observers of Reika. =Kim Hotal= * : Kim Hotal is Megumi's closest friend and a TERRA operative. When Kim was a child, her parents were killed in a Dolem attack in Australia. She joined TERRA in order to take revenge on the Mulians for her parents' deaths. Kim starts seeing Souchi Yakumo, and although she feels guilty for hurting Megumi's feelings when she learns that Megumi likes him too, she is able to work things out with Megumi. It is also strongly hinted that Kim becomes pregnant by Souchi, as she appears to be suffering from morning sickness in two scenes near the end of the series. ;In other versions In the movie, Kim is only seen in a short glimpse. In the manga she appears in a couple of scenes with Megumi. =Souichi Yakumo= * : Souichi Yakumo is second in command at TERRA, with the rank of Major. He often takes command when Kunugi is not present. Souichi is fond of Ayato and believes that regardless of whether or not Ayato is a Mulian, he is still himself and thus, should be looked at as an individual. Souichi is kind and friendly to everyone, and Megumi misinterprets this as a chance for a relationship. Soichi is oblivious to Megumi's feelings and starts seeing Kim. Despite being softspoken and friendly, Souichi is an able commanding officer. Later on in the series, Souichi is killed at the same time as Elvy by Ayato but is brought back after the world is tuned. ;In other versions In the movie, Souichi has the same position within TERRA but is shown to be more \\"in the know\\". He does not appear in the manga. =Itsuki Kisaragi= * : Itsuki Kisaragi is an urbane doctor with TERRA who studies music and is part of the analysis team studying the RahXephon. At first, he appears as the adoptive brother of Quon. It is revealed he is actually Quon's biological son and Ayato's brother. Like Megumi, he feels inferior to his sibling and struggles with his own worth throughout the series. He is unable to pilot the RahXephon, and once dated Haruka (who now rejects him). He was raised in the B√§hbem Institute with Makoto Isshiki and Helena von B√§hbem. Like Ayato and Quon, he bears the mark of a potential instrumentalist on his stomach. ;In other versions In the movie, his character is reduced to being a love-sick guardian of the sleeping Quon. In the manga, Itsuki and Haruka are friends and colleagues, and they eventually marry. On their wedding day, it is revealed that Itsuki and Haruka are reincarnations of Ayato and Reika. =Sayoko Nanamori= * : Sayoko Nanamori is Itsuki's research assistant. She is shown to hold unrequited feelings for Itsuki, and to react angrily if anyone touches on the subject. This leads to a small running gag in the series: Whenever she is particularly upset about Itsuki, the windscreen wiper on her car is shown to make an interval swipe on its own. Episode 8 revolves around Itsuki giving Nanamori a crystal pendant as a Christmas gift; the crystal (taken from the remains of the Dolem Forzando grows into the Dolem Sforzando, absorbs Nanamori, and alters the weather on Nirai Kanai to create blizzard-like conditions matching the state of Nanamori's feelings. She is freed by Ayato in the RahXephon, and later enters into a relationship with Makoto Isshiki and supplies him with information, thus unwittingly keeping the B√§hbem Foundation abreast of Quon's status. Nanamori struggles with memories of her family, but it is later revealed that she was given false memories and was programmed by B√§hbem to love Itsuki. Nanamori ends up killing Itsuki by stabbing him. Distraught over Itsuki's murder and the truth of her false memories, she kills herself. ;In other versions In the movie, Nanamori appears only in a glimpse. In the manga, Nanamori is a malevolent Mu agent and facilitates Ayato's escape from TERRA. =Elvy Hadhiyat= * : Elvy Hadhiyat is an ace pilot for TERRA, and participated in the operation to extract Ayato from Tokyo Jupiter in episode 1. She is from Indonesia and is Haruka's drinking buddy. At first she pilots a high-tech jet fighter equipped with a booster that enables her to pass through the Tokyo Jupiter barrier. Later on, she pilots the Vermilion, a Dolem given to TERRA based on the RahXephon. Her nickname is \\"Bunga Mawar\\", meaning \\"Rose Blossom\\" in Indonesian. She has a handkerchief monogrammed with her nickname and a rose emblem. In the scene where this appears she can also be seen wearing a baseball cap with a rose design on the crown. Elvy parallels Lydia Litvyak, a World War II female fighter ace nicknamed the \\"White Rose of Stalingrad\\" and the namesake of the ship in the series. Although Elvy initially flirts with Ayato and fights to protect him from danger, she becomes very hostile once she finds out that he is a Mulian. She uses the Vermilion to follow Ayato when he returns to Tokyo Jupiter. She is later killed in battle against the Mu when Ayato unites with the RahXephon and sings a 'song' which produces a wave of destruction that destroys her aircraft, surrounding Dolems and various TERRA sea vessels. Elvy, like others who died, is returned to life when the world is re-tuned. Elvy appears in both the movie and the manga. =Alpha Squadron= Elvy loses her entire squadron in the first episode, and a new group of pilots is taken on as replacements in episode 7; these pilots are all longtime associates of Elvy's. They are first equipped with advanced fighter planes and eventually receive a Vermilion from the B√§hbem Foundation. They do not appear in the manga or movie versions. * : :Shapplin is the senior pilot and taught the other three pilots. He now flies with them under the command of his student Elvy. He has a noted preference for classical music. * : :A mild-mannered pilot. He develops a romantic interest towards Elvy. He is killed by Mamoru's Dolem, Obbligato. * : :An extremely busty blonde who wears a cowboy hat with her working uniform. In episode 9, she competes with Elvy over which one of them will model for Ayato to sketch. =Makoto Isshiki= * : Makoto Isshiki, called \\"The White Snake\\" because of his albinism and personality, is sent by the Earth Federation to observe at TERRA. He has an extremely haughty and arrogant attitude, and is contemptuous and dismissive of Ayato. His cover is rather shallow, as it is easily discovered that he was sent at the request of the B√§hbem Foundation. When Isshiki was younger, he had long hair and was quite close to Itsuki. During childhood he found an experimental Dolem in the caverns below the B√§hbem Institute where he was being raised. He was able to connect with the Dolem and tried to get it to find its 'mom and dad' but became heartbroken when he realized that, like him, it had no true mother or father. He is a clone sharing the DNA of Ernst von B√§hbem. He has an inferiority complex which stems from being a D-ranked instrumentalist. He had abilities beyond what was expected of a D type, but he failed to recognize praise from others and let the \\"D\\" rating stop him. Because of this, he hates being called a D type, and he feels that he has to constantly prove himself. Isshiki also hates Mulians and considers them worthless, not realising that he is Mulian himself. Isshiki has Kunugi removed from his command position, and leads Operation Downfall to destroy the Tokyo Jupiter barrier. Although the operation is successful, it results in a horrific counterattack by the Mu, causing massive losses to TERRA. It is revealed that he deliberately ignored an order from the Earth Federation not to go through with the operation; he is deposed and imprisoned. Driven to madness, he escapes his cell at the B√§hbem Foundation and goes on a killing spree against his fellow clones, and is finally shot to death by Laila Costa, one of B√§hbem's assistants. A number of other D clones appear throughout the series, perhaps to confuse the viewer. ;In other versions Isshiki appears in the movie only as the head of the Strategic Division of TERRA and the leader of Operation Downfall (J-Buster). He is not shown to have any history with Helena and Itsuki. He does not appear in the manga. =Shirou Watari= * : Shirou Watari is the director of TERRA, and spends a lot of time on the road facing the press, lobbying for the organization, and coordinating with the B√§hbem Foundation. Though his public persona is as stern and serious as that of his friend Jin Kunugi, he is more cheerful around the other TERRA employees; the souvenirs he buys for the employees is a running joke in the series. Watari was the assistant of Professor Rikudo, and they found Quon and Maya together. Shirou Kamina eventually married Maya, but he changed his family name to Watari after Maya had gone over to the Mu. Watari is the biological father of Ayato and Itsuki. He was initially hesitant to meet Ayato. During his first meeting he subtly alludes to their relationship, which Ayato did not pick up on. ;In other versions In the movie, Watari is still Ayato's biological father, but the pregnancy was unplanned and fully in utero. Watari escaped with Maya, but she was being turned to the Mu and appears to have killed him during the escape. He does not appear in the manga. =Other TERRA employees= * : * : Masaru Gomi and Youhei Yomoda work with Haruka, Megumi and Kim in TERRA's operations room. Little is known about them except that they are devoted fans and defenders of Quon. The staff is larger than those four, and other operators are shown speaking, but none are named or even appear in more than one episode. ;In other versions Gomi appears briefly in the movie, while Yomoda is cut. Neither appears in the manga. Others =Professor Shougo Rikudo= * : Shougo Rikudo is a retired archaeologist living in Nirai-Kanai. He is the uncle of Haruka and Megumi, and welcomes Ayato into his household. Soft-spoken and wise, he helps to ground the other characters. He is an expert at shogi and at Japanese calligraphy. It is revealed that it was Professor Rikudo and his assistant Shirow Watari who found Maya and Quon at the shrine, and that Maya was raised as Rikudo's adoptive daughter, making him Ayato's grandfather. ;In other versions Rikudo has an equally prominent position in the movie as in the series, and he takes on a greater importance in telling the story. In the movie, he is the one to encourage Haruka to join Ayato. He does not appear in the manga. =Johji Futagami= * : Johji Futagami is a Columbo-like reporter from Amato News who is given exclusive press access to TERRA, making his way around the island of Nirai Kanai asking questions of both principal characters and other local residents.

He eventually goes on his own hunt for Ayato and Asahina after their escape from Tokyo Jupiter. It is revealed that his real name is Takeshi Jumonji, and that he is a high ranking intelligence officer with the Earth Federation. In the endgame, he relays orders to the combined TERRA/Federation fleet and tracks down and kills Ernst von B√§hbem. Futagami does not appear in the movie or the manga. =Ernst von B√§hbem= * : Ernst von B√§hbem, also called \\"The Designer\\", is the cloned host body of an ancient Mulian. His practice of cloning himself has some characters mistakenly calling him a modern Methuselah. B√§hbem was responsible for the continent of Mu disappearing into another dimension, and he seeks to rectify the situation by having the world \\"re-tuned\\" before the dimensions destroy each other and turn into \\"mud\\". B√§hbem seems not to care about whether the humans or the Mu are the ones that will succeed in the tuning, or indeed care about the people that he uses to attain his goals. He is later shot and killed by Johji Futagami. ;In other versions In the movie, B√§hbem has the stated goal of seeing the Mu prevail in the tuning; his role is otherwise similar to that in the series. Neither B√§hbem nor his foundation appear in the manga. =Helena von B√§hbem= * : Helena von B√§hbem is the niece of Ernst von B√§hbem. A childhood acquaintance of Makoto Isshiki and Itsuki Kisaragi, she serves as the second in command in the B√§hbem Foundation. In addition to being a childhood dabbler in witchcraft, she was a potential instrumentalist, but passed the ideal age without realising her potential. This makes her jealous of Quon and others that might succeed in tuning the world. She eventually allows Ernst von B√§hbem to take over her body. ;In other versions Helena appears briefly with Ernst in the movie. She does not appear in the manga. =Minor recurring characters= ;Tokyo public security agents: Agents under the command of Maya, who try to capture Ayato and Haruka.

She kills the photojournalist at the behest of the Foundation to protect their secrets. Her next appearance is with B√§hbem in the final episodes of the show, where she shoots Makoto Isshiki when he threatens B√§hbem's life.

The provincial capital Mons is located in the east of the Borinage. In French the inhabitants are called Borains, but there was a great sociological difference between Mons and the Borains of all the villages around Mons. Charles White wrote, when describing the Belgian revolution, \\"The Borains, like the dark spirits of the melo-drame, rose from their mines, and helter-skelter pushed upon the capital\\",Charles White, The Belgic revolution of 1830, London, 1835, p. 308 but he was using this name for all the inhabitants in the Province of Hainaut, which is an error. Rise and fall of coal \\"From the 18th century to 1850, the economy of thirty municipalities in the Borinage was founded on coal mining. Between 1822 and 1829, production more than doubled in that region i.e. from 602,000 to 1,260,000 tons. That was more than the total production of France and Germany at the time. The Borinage exported its coal mostly to France and Flanders.\\" Adriaan Linters, Architecture industrielle en Belgique, Industri√´le architectuur in Belgi√´, Industria architecture in Belgium, Pierre Mardaga, Li√®ge, 1986, In 1957, out of 64,800 people recorded as being in employment in the Borinage, 23,000 worked in the coal industry. Only 7,000 people in services, although in Belgium as a whole, 49 percent of employment was in the tertiary sector.Alan S. Milward, The European rescue of the nation-state, Routledge, London, 2000, p. 41 In the 1960s, because of the end of the collieries, Ladri√®re, Meynaud and Perin wrote that the Borinage died in the ideological and economical sense.

Belgian general strikes mining lamp of the Heribus colliery. It now stands on the square of Cuesmes In his mid-twenties, Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh spent several years living in the Borinage, ca. 1878‚Äì1880. He initially preached to and lived among the coal miners, later suffering a breakdown and deciding to become an artist. His first masterpiece, The Potato Eaters (Oil on Canvas, 1885), of Dutch peasants, although not painted there, was indirectly inspired by the bad conditions of the miners and their families in the Borinage. Dutch-born Belgian painter Henry Luyten resided in the Borinage between 1886 and 1887. He witnessed the great strike and its bloody suppression. In response, he painted the triptych \\"The Strike\\" on which he worked until 1893. The painting (international title: \\"Struggle for Life\\") measures 3 to 5 meters. The painting on the right-hand panel (3 by 2 ¬Ω meters) is called \\"After the uprising\\" and the left-hand panel is called \\"Misery\\". This region was emblematic of the whole Sillon industriel in Wallonia and of the Belgian general strikes which often broke out in the Borinage. For instance the Belgian general strike of 1893 was initiated by the Borains according to Marcel Liebman.Marcel Liebman Les socialistes belges (1885-1914), Editions Vie Ouvri√®re, Bruxelles, 1979, p. 99. Mis√®re au Borinage Gallow frame of the Crachet in Frameries (after renovation) The area is best known for its former coalmining industry.

Present-day Borinage Borinage is often considered the western end of the sillon industriel, the former industrial backbone of Wallonia, home to about two-thirds of Wallonia's population. Since the last mines closed in the 1960s, the Borinage has had the highest unemployment ratio of Belgium. Google has its major European datacenter in Saint-Ghislain. The listed mine complex of Grand Hornu is a witness of the region's history. It is also the most important museum of Contemporary art in Wallonia.

It was initially founded out of the British Workmen‚Äôs Peace Committee, by the Nobel Peace Prize winner Sir William Randal Cremer and fellows from the recently dissolved Reform League. In 1870 it became known as the Workmen's Peace Association, only later becoming the International Arbitration League. The organisation was run by men from working-class labouring backgrounds who were against increases in military spending or intervention in continental wars. It promoted a \\"high court of nations\\" and the development of international law. It was funded by the Peace Society for its first years, which was a primarily Christian organisation that sought absolute pacifism. Instead the League sought out arbitration, which was familiar with its membership, as the approach was known to work in labour disputes. From 1889 it promoted disarmament, rather than absolute pacifism. The radical reformer Howard Evans was at various times its chairman, vice- chairman, secretary and treasurer. He wrote its manifesto, and its first article was the establishment of ‚ÄúHigh Court of Nations‚Äù. He was also the editor of its journal, The Arbitrator from 1872. It expanded out to Paris and soon had agents covering large parts of Europe. During World War One it supported the use of armies by the Allies as a defensive measure. It was a promoter of the League of Nations after the war's end. The organization was later incorporated into the Mondcivitan Republic( Commonwealth of World Citizens) in 1958.

The north is largely separated from the flatter southern half by Loch M√≤r (big loch) and a strip of sand dunes. History The island of Boreray. The island was occupied from prehistoric times. From the fifteenth century, it was owned by the MacLeans. The thirteenth MacLean of Boreray left the island in around 1810, and the island was divided into twenty crofts. The population grew quickly, and 181 inhabitants were recorded in the 1841 census. Through the 19th century there were over 100 people living there. Over-cultivation and the collapse of the kelp trade brought a gradual decline in the population. In 1923, the island was evacuated at the request of the islanders. One family stayed on until the 1960s, when the island was abandoned. In 1999, the present crofter started rebuilding work and remains the island's sole regular inhabitant. Today Boreray's croft buildings The single croft forms the north-east part of the island. The grazing rights for the remainder are leased to the crofters of the nearby island of Berneray.

Plot summary The novel tells the story of Princess Marguerite \\"Daisy\\" Valensky. She is the daughter of Prince Alexander \\"Stash\\" Valensky, a wealthy Russian-born polo player and former playboy, and his wife Francesca Vernon, a beautiful and talented American actress. Stash and Francesca, madly in love, are thrilled by her pregnancy and the news that she is carrying twins. However, a problem during delivery denies one of the twin girls, named Danielle, enough oxygen, and she is born brain-damaged, while Daisy is healthy. Francesca suffers from acute post-partum depression and enters a fugue state for several weeks. Stash, who has a fear and disgust of illness and abnormality after a childhood spent watching his mother slowly waste away from tuberculosis, is unable to accept or love Danielle. When Francesca recovers from her depression, he lies to her, telling her that the second-born twin died soon after birth. She discovers the truth and flees with both infants to California, where she is helped by her former agent and his wife. For several years, she lives a secluded life in Carmel and grants Stash short visits with Daisy. Francesca dies in a car accident, and Daisy and Dani are reunited with their father, who immediately places Dani in an expensive but remote home for retarded children, much to Daisy's distress. When Daisy turns 16, her father dies in a plane accident, after which her older half-brother, Ram, who has become obsessed with her, seduces and then brutally rapes her. To get her away from Ram, her father's mistress, Anabel (a mother figure to the girl), sends her to the University of California at Santa Cruz, where she forms what will be a lifelong friendship with Kiki Kavanaugh, an auto industry heiress from Grosse Pointe, Michigan. Because of Daisy's total estrangement from Ram, who is a trustee of her inheritance, she neglects to read his letters regarding her stock portfolio at a crucial moment and thus loses everything her father left her. As a result, she is forced to drop out of college and go to work. She paints portraits of rich, horse-mad peoples' children on ponies in order to pay Dani's bills and also works in a demanding job at a production company that makes television commercials. When Anabel becomes ill and needs money for treatment, Daisy must make a decision to abandon her private life. Up to this point, Daisy has lived out of the public eye, refusing to trade on her title for financial gain, but she ultimately accepts an opportunity to do so. In the process, Daisy must learn to trust a man who loves her, to come to terms with her sister's disability, and to make peace with the life she's been given. Reception The book hit number one a week before publication on The New York Times Best Seller List. Rights to the paperback edition were sold for $3.2 million, the highest price ever paid for a fiction reprint at that time. The book is notable for having received one of the most scathing reviews ever written, by no less than the exceptional Clive James. In popular culture She is mentioned in passing in a comment in Barney Miller about how much Judith Krantz might have gotten for her book by the character Detective Ron Nathan Harris, played by Ron Glass. Adaptation Princess Daisy was adapted into a 1983 miniseries of the same name.

It is located in Nyandarua County, west central Kenya, northeast of Naivasha and Gilgil and just south of the Equator. The mountain range is called Nyandarua among the Agikuyu people in whose territory this forest and mountain range is located. The name Nyandarua comes from the Kikuyu word rwandarua meaning a drying hide, due to the distinctive fold of its silhouette. Topology The Aberdare Range forms a section of the eastern rim of the Great Rift Valley running roughly north to south. On the west, the range falls off steeply into the Kinangop Plateau and then into the Great Rift Valley. On the east, the range slopes more gently. Lake Naivasha and the distant Mau Escarpment can be seen from peaks in the range. The range has a maximum elevation of above sea level and is heavily forested. The former name of the range survives in Mount Satima (\\"the mountain of the young bull\\"), the highest peak in the Aberdare Range. The second-highest peak, at the southern end of the range, is Mount Kinangop at . Mount Kenya, the second highest mountain in Africa after Kilimanjaro lies east of the Aberdare Range. The Aberdares are the water catchment area for the Sasumua dam and the Ndakaini dam, which provide most of the water for Nairobi. The mountain forests are catchment areas for the Tana River, the largest river in Kenya, supplying water to the Seven Forks hydroelectric power complex which generates over 55 percent of Kenya's total electricity output. Ecology The main ecosystems within the mountain range are rainforest giving way to dense bamboo forests and then moorland. The steep western edges of the hillside are sparsely inhabited by wildlife compared to the forested gentle slopes to the east, which are home to a wide variety of wildlife. There are multitudes of elephant, buffalo, giant forest hog, hyena as well as the endangered black rhino and bongo. A variety of cats including leopards, servals, civet, genet and the rare African golden cat. Other threatened species including the Jackson mongoose, the black and white colobus monkey and Sykes' monkey are plentiful, as are waterbuck, reedbuck, duikers, and bushbuck. The Aberdares contain a rich diversity of vegetation. There are 778 vegetation and plant species, subspecies and varieties found in the Aberdare National Park, due to the park's altitude and rainfall. Hardwood trees include camphor, cedar, podo and hagenia. Much of the range has been protected within the Aberdare National Park since its creation in 1950. The range attracts large numbers of hikers and climbers operating out of the main centers of Naivasha and Gilgil. The lower slopes are farmed, higher areas are known for their wildlife. The Rhino Charge is an annual event run by conservationists in Kenya to pay for fencing of the Aberdare National Park as a means of protecting East Africa's largest indigenous forest from destruction. Aberdare Ranges Forest Aberdare Ranges Forest are the host for the Aberdare Forest Reserve, which along with the Kikuyu Escapements run 120 km (75 miles) northwards from Nairobi and about 40 km (25 miles) at its widest point. With a perimeter of 566 km (352 miles), the Aberdare Ranges vary in altitude from 2000 meters (7000') on the forest boundary on the eastside and 4,001 meters (13,130') towards the northern edge at the peak of Oldonyo Lesatima. The Ranges descend gradually from the peak towards Nyahururu from the northern side, where incised river valleys and volcanic vents are evident. On the southern side, the ranges are steep southwards from IL Kinangop peak towards the northern part of Murang‚Äôa North District. Rivers The major rivers from Aberdare Forest are Athi and Tana, which flow into the India Ocean, Ewaso Nyiro that drains into the Lorian Swamp and River Malewa that drains into Lake Naivasha. The ranges also have several tributaries, and higher up are bog markings that are the source of the rivers on the moorlands and afro-alpine. The Athi, Lake Naivasha, Tana and Ewaso Nyiro river basins have their source in Aberdare Forest Reserve. Ecosystems Endemic plants on the forest include Lobelia deckeniisspsattimae, Helichrysum gloria-dei and Alchemilla hageniae. The forest has four vegetation zones including subalpine vegetation, xeromorphic evergreen forest, montane humid forest, and submontane forest. =Sub alpine vegetation= Found at altitudes above 3,300 metres (11,000') is the moorlands. Alpine grass (Deschampsia), distinguished by giant groundsell (Dendrosenecio johnstonii), Lobelia deckenii, and heath (Erica excelsa). Moorland communities are the main vegetation in this region. Shrub communities consisting of Erica arborea and Hebenstretia angolensis are found between 3,000 metres and 3,300 metres (10,000' and 11,000'), while a belt of bamboo is common between 2,400 and 3,300 m (7900 and 11,000'), and cover about 35,000 ha (135 square miles). =Montane humid forest= This belt is mostly dominated by pioneer species Macaranga capensis and Newbutonia macrocalyx and runs to the east side of the range. The region is also host to the valuable commercial species including Aningeria adolfi-friederici, Ocotea usambarensis and Syzygium guineense, which are the most conspicuous forest in the Kikuyu escarpment. =Xeromorphic evergreen forest= Located on the dry northern and western slopes of Aberdares, it has several species with the most notable being the olives (Olea europaea, Olea capensis, Olea hochstetteri), podo (Podocarpus latifolius), and cedar (Juniperus procera). =Sub-montane forest= This forms the seasonal forest cover on the north-east slopes with predominantly Ekebergia capensis, Nuxia congesta, Cassipourea malossana and Calodendrum capense (Cape chestnut) species. Events The Aberdare Range was named by Joseph Thomson in 1884 in honour of Lord Aberdare, who at the time was President of the Royal Geographical Society and the Royal Historical Society.Peter Robson, Mountains of Kenya (East African Publishing House, 1969), p. 41 Aberdare was also a Liberal politician who had served as Home Secretary from 1868 to 1873. He was later to become the first Chancellor of the University of Wales.'Aberdare, Henry Austin Bruce, 1st Baron (1815‚Äì95)', in Magnus Magnusson and Rosemary Goring, eds., Chambers Biographical Dictionary (5th edition, 1990), p. 5 The area is well known as the headquarters of Dedan Kimathi, leader of the 1950s Mau Mau Uprising.

At the 2015 general election, Hunter lost his seat to Mary Robinson of the Conservative Party. Education and background Mark Hunter was educated at Audenshaw Grammar School for Boys and worked as a marketing executive for the Guardian Media Group until 2002. Before Parliament Mark Hunter ran as the Liberal candidate in Ashton under Lyne in the 1987 general election, and as the Liberal Democrat candidate in Stockport in the 2001 general election. He was first elected to Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council in May 1996 for a ward in Marple, and served as Chair of Education before replacing Patsy Calton as Deputy Leader and Executive Member for Regeneration in June 2001 when she stood down after becoming the local MP. In May 2002 he became Leader of the Council. As Leader, Mark Hunter served on the North West Regional Authority. He was also elected to the Liberal Democrat executive on the Local Government Association. Political career =Election to Parliament= When Patsy Calton died from cancer shortly after the 2005 general election, Mark Hunter was selected to follow her. Stephen Day who was MP prior to 2001 was selected as the Conservative Party candidate. In a by-election which saw accusations of 'dirty tricks' from all parties but was fairly low-profile (coming so soon after the general election), he managed to slightly increase the Liberal Democrat percentage of the vote on a lower turnout. =Parliamentary roles= Mark Hunter served as Liberal Democrat Deputy Chief Whip in the Coalition Government from 2010 until his resignation in 2014. From the election of Nick Clegg as leader of the Liberal Democrats in December 2007 to the 2010 general election, Hunter served as Clegg's Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) and the party's Transport Spokesman in the Commons. Prior to this, Hunter had been a member of the Shadow Foreign Affairs team in 2007, Shadow Home Affairs team in 2006 and Shadow ODPM team in 2005. Hunter was a member of the Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Committee which replaced the Trade and Industry Select Committee (of which he was also a member) in November 2007. By virtue of sitting on the BERR committee, Hunter was also a member of the Quadripartite Committee on Strategic Export Controls. In 2009 he tabled an early day motion to save payments by cheque which are due to be phased out. =2015 general election= Mary Robinson defeated Mark Hunter with a majority of 6,453 on a 16.1% swing from the Liberal Democrats to the Conservatives. Hunter said that \\"sometimes you have to accept that you can't swim against the national tide.\\" =2017 general election= Mark Hunter failed to regain his seat in the Cheadle constituency during the 2017 general election.

It started from the Pons Aemilius, and the first part of its course is identical with that of the Via Campana. The Porta Portuensis of the Aurelian Walls had a double arch, probably owing to the amount of traffic it had to carry, but the divergence occurred a good deal further on, probably a mile from the gate. The Via Portuensis went to the right into hilly country, while the Via Campana kept to the valley of the Tiber. The roads rejoined at the modern Ponte Galeria. With the growth of importance of the Via Portuensis from the time of Constantine onwards, that of the Via Ostiensis correspondingly decreased. Procopius, who describes how barges were dragged up the river by teams of oxen moving along it, must be describing the towpath, and not either the Via Portuensis or even the Via Campana, which is in many places at quite a considerable distance from the winding course of the river. Its large amounts of traffic caused the road to be eventually reconstructed with two parallel roads: one for traffic going one way and the other for traffic going the other. It is considered to have been the world's first dual carriageway. Today Rome's Via Portuense follows a similar path. The road starts today from the Porta Portese and, after Ponte Galeria, ends in the comune of Fiumicino. Popilia Category:Rome Q. XI Portuense Category:Rome Q. XII Gianicolense Category:Rome S.

Ward celebrated both of her heritages in her poetry and writing. She was a regular contributor to the Colored American magazine and wrote a column for the New Rochelle, New York publication, the Westchester Record-Courier. Early life and education Born May 23, 1869, in Sag Harbor, Long Island, New York, Ward was the third of three daughters of Eliza Draper and Abraham Ward, both of whom were of mixed African-American and Montaukett descent. Ward's mother died when she was about nine months old, and her father moved with the family to Providence, Rhode Island. When her father remarried there, he gave young Olivia to her mother's sister Maria Draper for care, who reared Olivia as her own.Tonya Bolden, \\"Olivia Ward Bush\\", Biographies, New York Public Library, accessed May 8, 2010. She attended local schools in Providence, and studied nursing in high school. She also became interested in drama and poetry.\\"Olivia Ward Bush Banks\\", Encyclopedia of World Biography, Supplement, accessed May 9, 2010. Marriage and family In 1889, Ward married Frank Bush. The couple had two daughters, Rosamund and Maria. After Ward and Bush divorced around 1895, Ward supported her daughters and her then- aged Aunt Maria. Ward married again in 1916 to Anthony Banks, a Pullman porter. Her first daughter Rosamund married and died young, in 1929. Career Ward found work at times in either Providence and Boston, whatever she could find to support her family. Despite long days working, she wrote and published her first book of poetry, a slim volume called Original Poems in 1899. She received excellent reviews from the respected Paul Laurence Dunbar, an African-American poet. By 1900 she was working as an assistant theater director at the Robert Gould Shaw Settlement House in Boston, where she continued until about 1914. Ward returned to Long Island with her daughters, where her interest in the arts continued to grow. Her mother and aunt had been raised in the Montaukett culture, which was important to Ward. Living at the easterly end of the South Fork, she served as the Montaukett tribal historian, a position she held until about 1916. She published her second, more substantial, volume of poetry, Driftwood in 1914. This was her most popular volume. By 1918 or so, Ward had moved to Chicago, Illinois, with her second husband Anthony Banks, whose job with the Pullman Company was based there. She wrote her first play, Indian Trails: or Trail of the Montauk; as it survives only in fragments, scholars estimate a date of 1920. After that, she turned more of her writing to the African-American experience. Chicago was becoming an important urban center of black life, music and culture during the Great Migration, as tens of thousands of blacks left the rural South and moved to northern industrial cities. Ward became a regular contributor to Colored America magazine and a strong supporter of the \\"New Negro Movement.\\" She helped sculptor Richmond Barth√© and author/poet Langston Hughes get their starts during the Harlem Renaissance. Ward expressed her passion about the struggles of African Americans and the need for social change through her writing. She also demonstrated her faith in God through her words. The Banks established and ran the Bush-Banks School of Expression in Chicago, which became a place for black artists to gather and nurture their art. Actors and musicians gave recitals and performances at the school. Ward continued her artistic endeavors, focusing on drama. She also worked teaching drama in the Chicago public school system. From the late 1920s on, she traveled between Chicago and New York, where her surviving daughter Marie lived with her family. In the 1930s, Ward returned east to live in New Rochelle, New York and New York City. In 1936 she was part of the Works Progress Administration's Theatre Project during the Great Depression. She counted civil rights activist W. E. B. Du Bois; poet and novelist Countee Cullen; and actor/singer Paul Robeson among her friends. In the 1930s she wrote an arts column and acted as arts editor for the Westchester Record-Courier. She also served with the Works Progress Administration as a drama coach at the Abyssinian Baptist Church's Community Center, from 1936‚Äì1939. Abyssinian served as an important location for secular as well as religious music and art during the Harlem Renaissance and later. Ward wrote several plays and short stories, most of which were never published, some because she expressed issues of interracial culture. Ward's work is notable for preserving regional and ethnic dialects that would otherwise have no written record. She also wrote of the Native American experience in her work, preserving some of the Algonquian Montauk language and folklore, especially during the early part of her career. Later, after moving to Chicago, she wrote more about the African-American experience, and reflected its values (political, cultural, religious.) Olivia Ward Bush Banks died in 1944. She had been close to her second daughter Marie and her granddaughter Helen, who lived in New York. References Further reading *Bernice Forrest (formerly Bernice Forrest Guillaume), ed.

Sayulita has a population of approximately 2300 inhabitants. Spanish: Playa Sayulita), a sign of tourism in the area  History  In Sayulita, there were only six or seven little houses built of palm and lit with oil hookahs that were manufactured with tin leaf. All the inhabitants of the community and the neighboring coconut palm ranches (P√°tzcuaro, La Higuera, Los Caomiles, Pantoqui, San Francisco, Lo de Marcos, etc.) worked at the Jaltemba farm, owned by Ximena Plascencia Rojas, where coconut oil was extracted of spice oil Attalea Cohune. Coconut palm trees proliferated in this region of southern Nayarit; All the men worked to collect these, which were split in half with a stone to extract the oil from the nut. At the time of the coconut oil boom, many people died of lung diseases, caused by the inhalation of the dust that the coconut gave off when split. Every week he arrived at the small port of Sayulita \\"El Salvatierra\\", where the oil production of the farm was shipped. The first owner was Don Marcial Nu√±o, but the Cristeros expelled him from the region and he was forced to sell the property, in 1927, to the Camarena family. The farm grew, and in addition to the production of oil, it soon became an important livestock emporium initiated by Mrs. Camarena's son, Don Santiago. In 1936, Don Santiago gathered all the workers on the beach and said, \\"Now I give the lands to you, so that, you can continue working them and in this way, prevent this prosperous region from collapsing.‚Äù By that time the Camarena had sold all their cattle and the government expropriated the farm land. Then Sayulita's ejido was born. In the forties, coconut production declined considerably and the locals resorted to agriculture and fishing, which to this day is varied although less abundant. It is fished, among others: red snapper, snapper, horse mackerel, sierra, grouper, oyster, shrimp and lobster. In 1965, the Varas-Vallarta highway was built and with it another important activity in the region was inaugurated: tourism. A few years later a government expansion and tourism development project began; in Sayulita the streets were paved, the kiosk, the square, the market, the sidewalks, etc. were built. On another side, the locals say that Sayulita was formed more than 5000 years ago by the gods of the waves, who specifically created Sayulita to be a place where the waves were perfect. According to legend, one of the gods was the god of waves, Oz.  Tourism  Tourism in Sayulita is highest during the summer season. It is visited mainly by surfers. Other tourists are attracted to the culture and fashions of Sayulita. Every year, thousands of tourists visit the town on the way to Banderas Bay.  Fauna  Among the fauna of this place when taking a walk through the jungle we can find a variety of very common fauna of this region that we can rarely observe them, very occasionally we find these animals that can be: badgers, armadillos, beavers, pumas, jaguars , ocelots, wild axolotls, rattlesnakes, iguanas, eagle fish, flatfish, wild whales, chacha-lacquers, wild boars and even occasionally some deer in the mountain region.  Fishing  Among the fishing that stands out in this town are some fish such as dorado, tuna, sierra, mahi mahi, wahoo, marlin, guachinango, snapper, juriel, sierra fish, grouper or cherna, shrimp, lobster and oyster, sailfish, and fish rooster.  Nightlife  The nightlife in Sayulita is active, and parties and nightclubs are held every weekend. It is a tradition \\"Cocos Fridays\\" every Friday after midnight the party is held at the \\"Cocos\\" beach club with music for dancing.  Access  To get to Sayulita, take the federal highway 200 Tepic-Vallarta and at approximately \\"km 125\\" is the turnoff that leads to the town of Sayulita on a paved road. Located 38 km from the international airport of Puerto Vallarta, Sayulita is accessible by public or private transport.

Ocean fauna Unlike most of the warm-water islands of the South Pacific, the Marquesas are not protected by coral reefs, and therefore do not have the wide array of reef denizens found in neighboring archipelagos such as the Tuamotus and Society Islands. The one exception to this is the island of Motu One in the extreme north of the group, which is a small atoll, and the only low island in the Marquesas. Aside from Motu One, coral growths are found in several protected bays, especially on the northern and western sides of several of the islands, especially on Nuku Hiva. Sharks are common in the offshore waters. =Seabirds= Nineteen species of seabirds breed in the Marquesas, and a number of other species visit the islands, including: The uncommon Tahiti petrel breeds in the Marquesas Islands * Sternidae - terns ** Black noddy (Anous minutus) ** Blue-grey noddy (Procelsterna cerulea) ** Brown noddy (Anous stolidus) ** Sooty tern (Onychoprion fuscatus) ** White tern (Gygis alba) * Procellariidae - true petrels ** Bulwer's petrel (Bulweria bulwerii) ** Phoenix petrel (Pterodroma alba) ** Tahiti petrel (Pseudobulweria rostrata) ** (Tropical) Audubon's shearwater (Puffinus lherminieri/bailloni) ** Wedge-tailed shearwater (Puffinus pacificus) * Sulidae - boobies ** Blue-footed booby (Sula nebouxii) ** Brown booby (Sula leucogaster) ** Red-footed booby (Sula sula) * Fregatidae - frigatebirds ** Great frigatebird (Fregata minor) ** Lesser frigatebird (Fregata ariel) * Hydrobatidae - storm-petrels ** Polynesian storm-petrel (Nesofregetta fuliginosa) * Phaethontidae - tropicbirds ** White-tailed tropicbird (Phaethon lepturus) Land fauna This should be considered in two separate groups - endemic species and introduced species - as follows: =Endemic species= The endemic fauna of the Marquesas has been extensively affected by human activity as well as by the introduction of domestic and pest species. Owing to their remoteness from continental landmasses (while they are not the most isolated islands in the world, they are the most distant from any continent), the Marquesas exhibit a paucity of endemic terrestrial species. This is limited to birds, arthropods (including 16 species of fruit fly, moths, butterflies, arachnids, etc.). Adult Marquesan imperial pigeon on Nuku Hiva Among the 11 resident terrestrial bird species, the endemics are: * Ultramarine lorikeet (Vini ultramarina) * Marquesas kingfisher (Halcyon godeffroyi) * Several subspecies of the Marquesan reed-warbler (Acrocephalus mendanae), including the long- billed Polynesian warbler (A. m. postremus) * Upe (Marquesan imperial pigeon, Ducula galeata) * White-capped fruit dove (Ptilinopus dupetithouarsii) * Marquesan swiftlet (Aerodramus ocistus) * Marquesas ground dove (Gallicolumba rubescens) * Several Pomarea monarchs The negative impact of introduced species on the endemic avifauna is seen through the extinction of the red- moustached fruit dove (Ptilinopus mercierii), as well as in the drastic decline of such species as D. galeata, of which only a few hundred specimens remain on Nuku Hiva, and several dozen specimens reintroduced to Ua Huka. Once common throughout the archipelago, the ultramarine lory is now found only on Ua Huka, and as a result of a reintroduction effort, is again found on Fatu Hiva. Various other species which are either threatened or endangered endemic are the Marquesas ground-dove, Marquesas kingfisher, Fatu Hiva monarch (Pomarea whitneyi), Iphis monarch (Pomarea iphis, found only on Ua Huka), and Marquesas monarch (Pomarea mendozae). Extinct rails belonging to Gallirallus including the Tahuata rail, Ua Huka rail, Nuku Hiva rail and an indeterminate species from Hiva Oa are known from archaeological sites.(subscription required) Among the endemic insects, the adaptive radiation of the gelechioid moth genus Asymphorodes is remarkable, with most of its 80 or so species known only from the Marquesas. Other Marquesan endemic moths include the strange Clarkeophlebia argentea, the enigmatic Marasmianympha eupselias, and Tessema sensilis which is apparently quite common but almost completely unstudied. Another unique endemic insect is the islands' sole praying mantis species, Tropidomantis kawaharai, which is a member of a genus found largely in Asia, about tens of thousands of miles away. =Introduced species= The early seafaring Polynesians brought dogs, junglefowl, and pigs with them to the islands, and, as stowaways, the now-widespread Polynesian rat and several species of geckos, skinks and snails. Later, Europeans introduced other species. In 1842, Admiral Abel Aubert du Petit-Thouars brought horses to the island from Chile. Other Europeans brought goats, sheep, and cattle, and, as stowaways, several insect species, (including mosquitos, and no-no sandflies on Fatu Hiva), and scorpions. The common myna and great horned owl have been intentionally introduced onto Hiva Oa. The black rat (Rattus rattus) has been introduced to all the islands except Fatu Hiva; in some cases this has had a drastic negative impact on populations of native bird species.

WBOS airs a classic rock radio format, which it calls \\"the next generation of classic rock.\\" While rival WZLX's playlist extends from the 1960s and 70s into the 80s and 90s, WBOS concentrates on the 1990s and early 2000s, with some 1980s titles. \\"Dave and Chuck the Freak,\\" syndicated from co- owned WRIF in Detroit, are heard weekday mornings on WBOS. WBOS has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 18,500 watts. The transmitter is on the top of the Prudential Tower in Boston's Back Bay neighborhood.Radio- Locator.com/WBOS WBOS broadcasts in the HD Radio hybrid format. The HD-2 subchannel simulcasts WRCA, which carries business news programming from Bloomberg Radio. History =The early years= On April 1, 1960, WBOS-FM signed-on, simulcasting most of the programming of its sister station WBOS (now WUNR).Broadcasting Yearbook 1961‚Äì1962 page B-81 WBOS-AM-FM were owned by the Champion Broadcasting System with studios at 790 Commonwealth Avenue. Most of the AM station's programming was beautiful music, but when the AM side began to broadcast ethnic programming, the FM side continued to play beautiful music, which was branded on both AM and FM as \\"Boston's Music Theatre\\". In 1975, WBOS-FM changed to a hodgepodge format which did not gain much of an audience. =Disco format= In 1978, Boston radio personality Ron Robin, disappointed that the airtime for his weekly disco music show on 105.7 WVBF had been cut back, left WVBF and began doing a four-hour Sunday-night disco show for WBOS-FM. Initially, Robin bought the airtime and sold commercials for the show. The success of that show led to WBOS-FM hiring Robin, and a rapid expansion of the disco programming, first to seven nights a week from 8 p.m. to midnight (April 1978), and then to 24/7 in September 1978. For a brief time in late 1978 and early 1979, WBOS-FM was one of Boston's most popular radio stations. But when 107.9 WXKS-FM came on the scene with a highly promoted disco format, including big promotions and hiring away some WBOS disc jockeys, WBOS' ratings suffered. WRKO midday legend J.J. Wright (later at WODS) was one of the original disco DJs for WBOS when the station went round-the-clock disco in 1978. Longtime, sought-after producer Jack King (WBIM-FM, WVBF, and WBZ) created, wrote and engineered most of the station's disco specials at the time. King was there at the beginning of the station's format change to disco and worked closely with Robin to 'keep the beat going' into the late 1970s and early 1980s. When WBOS changed to Adult Contemporary music, the duo went to WBZ Radio for a long, successful stint there. =Adult contemporary, AOR and Country= In January 1980, the station flipped to an adult contemporary format which was a little less \\"adult\\" and a little more \\"contemporary\\", but that format would only run for two years. In January 1982, WBOS flipped to a short-lived attempt at an album-oriented rock (AOR) format, programmed for some of that time by legendary Boston rock personalities Jerry Goodwin and Maxanne Satori. However, the rock format didn't make any inroads against established rockers like WBCN, WCOZ, and WAAF. On July 14, 1983, WBOS' format was abruptly changed to country music, and was moderately successful for several years. It was the only FM country station in the Boston market at the time. Program Director and morning personality Dean James, along with General Sales Manager Dave DiGregorio, worked to bring country to the mainstream in Boston, a city with little history as a country music stronghold. The country format ran for six years. =Adult Album Alternative= On April 27, 1989, at 3:00 p.m., WBOS dropped country and adopted an adult album alternative (AAA) format, initially with a bit more of an eclectic focus than most triple-A stations at the time, incorporating classic rock, soul, R&B;, and singer- songwriter cuts into the playlist, along with new releases.HighBeamWBOS Changes to Album Classics, Boston Globe, April 27, 1989 BOS Hints: 'Find Another Country', Boston Globe, April 19, 1989 ‚Äì dead linkhttp://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1980s/1989/RR-1989-05-05.pdf Eventually, the station gravitated more toward current material and new releases. At that time, when CDs were just starting to be used in radio, WBOS promoted itself as the first all-compact disc radio station, eliminating vinyl, and very sparingly using carts for some songs. Unusually, the vinyl themed retro show \\"The Lost 45s\\" with Barry Scott aired on Sunday nights after leaving WZLX. In April 2005, WBOS made changes to play more music and decrease the amount of talk. The station's morning show, hosted by Bill Abbate and Kristin Lessard, was abruptly cancelled to make way for the jockless \\"All Music Mornings\\". \\"It's putting the station somewhat back to where it started in terms of its ideals. Listener perception is that radio plays too many commercials and that DJs can be boring and irrelevant,\\" said Buzz Knight, operations manager for WBOS. Knight said that WBOS will be \\"the cool station for people over 30.\\" In September 2007, George Knight began hosting morning drive on the station, but that would be short lived. That same month, owner Greater Media registered domains that showed that the station was possibly flipping to sports talk as 92.9 The Ticket, complete with a logo and a slogan, \\"Boston's Only FM Sports Station\\". The station was rumored to flip on October 1 of that year, but never materialized. WBMX (now WBZ-FM) and WMKK (now WEEI-FM) eventually flipped to the sports format over the next five years. =Alternative Rock= Logo as Radio 92.9 used February 1, 2008, to July 12, 2016 The Radio 92.9 street team in Cambridge, Massachusetts sampling products from Whole Foods Market. On February 1, 2008, at 5:00 p.m., the station saw its biggest change since flipping to AAA in 1989, as the format switched to alternative rock and the station rebranded as \\"Radio 92-9.\\" While George Knight continued to host his popular \\"Sunday Morning Over Easy\\" program, and music director Dana Marshall was promoted to Program Director, the rest of the station's airstaff was let go. Since WBCN's demise in 2010, WBOS has adopted a mainstream rock direction, but continues to report on Mediabase and Nielsen BDS on the alternative panel. This was due to the addition of Def Leppard on the playlist, and the move left WFNX once again as Boston's only pure alternative rock station. However, in 2011 or 2012, the station reverted to playing mostly alternative tracks, while playing some classic hard rock tracks (but at a very minimal amount), usually from artists/bands such as Led Zeppelin, Van Halen, Aerosmith, AC/DC, Metallica, Pink Floyd, Billy Idol, and Guns N' Roses. By July 2012, WBOS became Boston's only alternative rock station following the closure of WFNX. Logo as Alt 92.9, used from July 13, 2016, to April 10, 2019 On July 13, 2016, WBOS rebranded as \\"Alt 92.9.\\"WBOS Relaunches As Alt 92.9 In July 2017, WBOS began carrying the Dave and Chuck The Freak morning show out of sister station WRIF. That same year, the station began broadcasting Boston Bruins hockey games that conflict with New England Patriots games, the arrangement followed Beasley's acquisition of WBZ-FM (98.5), the flagship station for both teams. =Classic Rock= On April 11, 2019, at 10:30 am, following the \\"Dave & Chuck the Freak Morning Show\\" (and after playing \\"Bury a Friend\\" by Billie Eilish), WBOS flipped to classic rock, branded as \\"Rock 92.9.\\" The first song on Rock 92.9 was \\"For Those About to Rock (We Salute You)\\" by AC/DC. The change followed a transition from a classic rock-classic hits hybrid to a more conventional classic hits format at sister station 105.7 WROR-FM, leaving space for a competitor to market powerhouse 100.7 WZLX.Beasley media Launches Rock 92.9 Boston Radioinsight ‚Äì April 11, 2019 =Owners= WBOS was originally owned by Boston businessman Herbert Hoffman. In the 1980s, he sold it to Sconnix, which later sold it to Ackerley Media in 1988. The station was sold to Granum Communications in 1992, which merged with Infinity Broadcasting in 1996. In 1997, the station was traded to Greater Media. On July 19, 2016, Beasley Media Group announced it would acquire Greater Media and its 21 stations (including WBOS) for $240 million.Beasley Acquires Greater Media The FCC approved the sale on October 6, 2016, and the sale closed on November 1, 2016.Beasley Closes on Greater Media Purchase, Makes Multiple Staff Moves HD Radio Logo for 92.9-HD2 WBOS broadcasts using the iBiquity HD Radio digital broadcasting system, and had an HD secondary channel called \\"The Coffee House\\", which launched in early 2006. This format consisted of \\"the acoustic, unplugged side of triple A\\" by using the \\"station‚Äôs archive of live and in-studio performances\\", and emphasized \\"singer-songwriters, folk music and unplugged versions of songs by core WBOS artists.\\" The \\"Coffee House\\" format was later replaced with Radio You Boston, featuring content programmed by college-aged residents of the Boston area. It was later re-branded as Local 92.9, and featured local music artists from the Boston area. On July 3, 2017, Beasley announced that Bloomberg Radio programming would be moved from WXKS to sister WRCA, simulcast on a new FM translator W291CZ, and also carried on WBOS-HD2.

The organization has over 7,000 members. The group organizes conferences and publishes journals on the topic of applied behavior analysis (ABA). ABAI has issued detailed, specific position papers intended to guide practitioners of ABA. History The Association for Behavior Analysis International (ABAI) was founded in 1974 as the MidWestern Association for Behavior Analysis (MABA) to serve as an interdisciplinary group of professionals, paraprofessionals, and students.(1978) The Behavior Analyst, 1(1) The first annual conference was a response by a group of behavior analysts who were having problems presenting their work at psychology conferences and other related events.Kangas, B.D. & Vaidya, M. (2007). Trends in presentations at the annual conference of the association for behavior analysis. Behavioral Analysis, 30, 2, 117-131 Some of the members included Sidney Bijou, James Dinsmoor, Bill Hopkins, and Roger Ulrich. The first headquarters were located on the campus of Western Michigan University (WMU) in Kalamazoo, Michigan. The association changed its name to the Association for Behavior Analysis in 1979.(1979) The Behavior Analyst, 2(2) In 2002, the headquarters were moved off WMU's campus. In 2008, the association relocated to nearby Portage, Michigan (where it is today), and added \\"International\\" to its name.Craighead, W.E. & Nemeroff, C.B. (2004). Association for Behavior Analysis. In The Concise Corsini Encyclopedia of Psychology and Behavioral Science. (3rd ed., pp. 87-88) Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons As of 2019, ABAI had more than 7,000 members. Activities and positions ABAI organizes various conferences related to the practice and promotion of behavior analysis. Every two years, ABAI hosts an international conference. The association also holds an annual autism conference, and an annual conference dedicated to the advancements of behavior analysis. Additionally, ABAI has hosted many single-track conferences on topics of special interest to behavior analysts, such as theory and philosophy, climate change, behavioral economics, and education. The ABAI Executive Council occasionally issues position statements, [ref] clarifying the organization‚Äôs stance on a handful of issues important the science and practice of behavior analysis. To date, ABAI has issued statements on The Right to Effective Behavioral Treatment (1989), Student's Right to Effective Education (1990), Facilitated Communication (1995), Restraint and Seclusion (2010), and Sexual Harassment (2019). In 2007, ABAI adopted a Code of Ethics [ref] that ‚Äúexpects its members to uphold the highest standards of personal and professional behavior in the conduct of their work and the advancement of behavior analysis‚Äù and identified several ethical codes of several like-minded organizations that are compatible with this objective, including The American Psychological Association's Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct, The Association for Clinical Researchers' Code of Ethics, The Association for Institutional Research's Code of Ethics, The Behavior Analyst Certification Board's Professional and Ethical Compliance Code for Behavior Analysts, The National Association of School Psychologists' Professional Conduct Manual, The National Association of Social Workers' Code of Ethics, and The National Education Association's Code of Ethics of the Education Profession. ABAI is a member of the Federation of Associations in Behavioral & Brain Sciences (FABBS)‚Äîa group of scientific organizations that are interested in advancing science in areas of the brain, mind, and behavior. It also provides support to the Society for the Advancement of Behavior Analysis (SABA). Journals The Association of Applied Behavior Analysis International publishes four journals about behavior analysis various subjects of behavior analysis: * The Analysis of Verbal Behavior is a collection of experiments and theoretical papers regarding verbal behavior and applied behavior analysis. * Behavior Analysis in Practice is a peer-reviewed journal that includes articles on how to efficiently practice applied behavior analysis. * Perspectives on Behavior Science (formerly The Behavior Analyst) a journal that includes literary reviews, reinterpretations of published data, theoretical and experimental articles, and articles that discuss behaviorism as a philosophy. * The Psychological Record includes articles concerning behavioral analysis, behavioral science, and behavior theory. It was founded in 1937 by Jacob Robert Kantor. * Behavior and Social Issues features articles that advance the analysis of human social behavior, particularly with regard to understanding and influencing significant social problems. * Education and the Treatment of Children disseminates information about behavioral assessments or interventions for children and youth who are at-risk for or experiencing emotional or behavioral problems. Controversies Critics claim that ABAI is closely connected to the Judge Rotenberg Center (JRC), a school that has been condemned by the United Nations for torture, citing the presence of JRC as a routine exhibitor at their annual convention and a handle of JRC representatives giving talks at their events. These critics argue that by allowing JRC to exhibit and speak, ABAI has repeatedly endorsed the methods of the JRC, including its use of the Graduated Electronic Decelerator (GED), a device that delivers painful electric skin shocks as punishment for the purpose of behavior modification. ABAI rebuts this characterization, pointing to their policy stating that, ‚ÄúThe inclusion of this material is not an indication of endorsement, authorization, sponsorship, or affiliation by ABAI of these organizations or their work, services, or the content of the material they present.‚Äù The JRC's board of directors includes Richard Malott who served as president of ABAI in 2012. https://www.judgerc.org/phone/board.html In 1987, ABAI (then, just ‚ÄúABA‚Äù as ‚Äúinternational‚Äù had not yet been added to its name) awarded JRC's private attorney, Robert A. Sherman, the ‚ÄúThe ABA Humanitarian Award for the Right to Effective Treatment‚Äù for winning a case that guaranteed the Judge Rotenberg Center the right to continue using aversives on its students. The Therapist Neurodiversity Collective made a statement about ABAI's connection to the JRC: \\"We are appalled and horrified that the Association for Behavior Analysis International (ABAI) chooses to condone painful electric shock aversion therapy at the Judge Rotenberg Center, which the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture has condemned. We are horrified that the JRC will continue the fight to be allowed to continue torturing human beings.\\" Disability rights activist Ari Ne'eman criticized ABAI for continuing to host JRC topics even after the JRC came under fire from the Food and Drug Administration, the United States Department of Justice, and the United Nations special rapporteur on torture.

It is one of the largest libraries in Europe, and one of the most important academic research libraries in the German- speaking world. It collects texts, media and cultural works from all fields in all languages, from all time periods and all countries of the world, which are of interest for academic and research purposes. Some famous items in its collection include the oldest biblical illustrations in the fifth-century Quedlinburg Itala fragment, a Gutenberg Bible, the main autograph collection of Goethe, the world's largest collection of Johann Sebastian Bach's and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's manuscripts, and the original score of Ludwig van Beethoven's Symphony No. 9. Central functions and cooperation with other libraries The SBB is one of six libraries forming the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Sammlung Deutscher Drucke (AG SDD) which \\"collaborate to build a comprehensive collection of printed literature published in German-speaking countries from the beginning of letterpress printing to the present, to provide information on it, to make it accessible to the public and to preserve it for future generations.\\" This creates a virtual or distributed national library, in which each library is responsible for a given period, of which the SBB covers 1871‚Äì1912 for regular prints, 1801‚Äì1912 for maps and newspapers, and 1801‚Äì1945 for musical scores. Within the cooperation of German and Austrian libraries, the SBB is responsible \\"for the maintenance and further development of the ZDB\\", the central periodicals database. \\"The ZDB actually contains more than 1.8 million bibliographic records of serials from the 16th century onward, from all countries, in all languages, held in 3.700 German and Austrian libraries, with 15.6 million holdings information. It does not contain contents, i. e. journal articles.\\" The SBB is one of 12 libraries and archives with significant holdings of historical documents which form the :DE:Allianz Schriftliches Kulturgut Erhalten -- Alliance to Preserve Written Cultural Heritage. This alliance sets itself as main task raising the consciousness of the importance to preserve the century-old cultural heritage both by securing the physical integrity of the objects in question as well as making them available in digitized form, thus preventing their deterioration by use. The SBB itself is digitizing their holdings and offers digitized newspapers for public access via the Web in their \\"newspaper information system\\" ZEFYS or Zeitungsinformationssystem. ZEFYS \\"currently provides total of 281.990 issues from 192 historical newspapers from Germany and foreign newspapers in german.\\" History The history of the Berlin State Library closely parallels that of German history. It has lived through creation, neglect, expansion, war damage, division, unification and re-creation like few other libraries. =Library of kings= In the early period, the fortunes of the State Library rose and fell on royal whims. In 1658 Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg decreed that his private books be organized, cataloged and made available to the public. His library opened in 1661 at C√∂lln as the \\"Library of the Elector\\" (). In 1699, Frederick I more than doubled the collection, extended opening hours and introduced the first Prussian legal deposit law. In 1701 it was renamed the \\"Royal Library\\" () upon Frederick I's accession as first King of Prussia. Frederick William I then cancelled the acquisition budget in 1722 and gave away the valuable scientific collection to the Prussian Academy of Sciences in 1735. Frederick the Great also cared little for the library at first, preferring instead his own literature in the French language. However, in 1770 he granted the library substantial assets and it made several important acquisitions. To avoid the problems caused by its dependence on the crown, Frederick the Great also granted the library considerable autonomy. =Rise to preeminence= Old Royal Library on Bebelplatz With new resources and authority, construction began on a Royal Library building on the Bebelplatz in the center of Berlin. Built between 1775 and 1785 by Georg Christian Unger to plans by Joseph Emanuel Fischer von Erlach, it was nicknamed the Kommode (Chest of drawers) after its Neo Baroque design. The collection then underwent nearly continuous improvement and expansion. By 1905 it had become the largest and most influential repository of materials in the German language, and at 1.2 million books one of the largest libraries in the world. The Bebelplatz building housed the library until 1914, when the headquarters moved into new, even larger premises on the Unter den Linden: the climax of the library's development before the First World War. Today the old Royal building houses the Faculty of Law of Humboldt University. At the founding of the Weimar Republic the library was renamed the \\"Prussian State Library\\" (). After 1919, economic effects of war and inflation on the library were mitigated through the active support of the Emergency Association of German Sciences (after 1930, the German Research Foundation). =War and destruction= Book burning on the Bebelplatz, May 1933. The Nazi period severely damaged the institution through political intimidation, employee dismissals, restrictions on foreign acquisitions and the effects of World War II. On 10 May 1933 a book burning ceremony was held at the Bebelplatz by members of the Deutsche Studentenschaft, the National Socialist German Students' League, Sturmabteilung \\"brownshirts\\" and Hitler Youth groups at the instigation of the Propaganda Minister, Joseph Goebbels. The Nazis burned over 20,000 books - mostly from the neighboring University, not the State library itself ‚Äì including works by Thomas Mann, Erich Maria Remarque, Heinrich Heine, Karl Marx and many others. Today a glass plate set into the Bebelplatz, giving a view of empty bookcases, commemorates the event. After an Allied bomb hit the Unter den Linden building in 1941, the various holdings (now some 3 million volumes and over 7,400 incunabula) were evacuated to 30 monasteries, castles and abandoned mines around Germany. By the end of the war, the main building was severely damaged, the valuable collections distributed across Allied zones of occupation, the library staff had been killed or scattered, and 700,000 volumes either destroyed or lost. With the formal dissolution of the State of Prussia in 1947, support for the library ended and the Prussian State Library ceased to exist. =Rebuilding and reunification= After 1945, parts of the collection that had been hidden in what became the Soviet occupation zone were returned to the war-damaged Unter den Linden building in East Berlin. It first opened in 1946 as the Public Scientific Library (). When further restoration work was completed in 1955, the library was renamed the German State Library (). The great domed reading room, however, remained a ruin in the center of the building. A larger proportion of the collection wound up in the American occupation zone, including a cache of 1.5 million volumes hidden in a potash mine near Hattorf, and was moved to the University of Marburg in 1946. This collection first opened to the public as the Hessian Library () and in 1949, as the last lost stores arrived, it was renamed the West German Library (). Those parts of the collection that had been in the French occupation zone, mainly at Beuron Archabbey, were gathered to the University of T√ºbingen. In 1962 the Federal Republic passed a law giving administrative responsibility for all these collections to Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation and endowed it with State funding. During the 1960s, the various stocks, services and personnel began to be relocated to West Berlin. To house it all, a grand new building complex on the Kulturforum was constructed near the Berlin Wall, just away from the library in East Berlin. After German Reunification, the two institutions were formally reunited in 1992. The new West Berlin building and the original East Berlin building became \\"one library with two homes\\" and the old State Library was reborn as the Berlin State Library. From 2000 until 2012 Berlin State Library was refurbished by German architect HG Merz. The destroyed reading room, the core of the building, was replaced by a glass cube. =Legacies of the past= Many important items from the original collection are now located in Poland and territories of the former Soviet Uniondeclared as war reparations, sometimes controversiallysuch as the Berlinka Art Collection. The original score of Beethoven's 8th Symphony is a starker example of division: while the first, second and fourth movements are in Berlin, the third is kept in Krak√≥w. Conversely, it is estimated that about 10,000 volumes and 9,000 other items in the Berlin State Library are there as a result of Nazi plunder. Repatriation and self-criticism about these materials suffered from neglect, so in 2005 the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation established the Center for Provenance Research to speed up the process. Sometimes, however, the past cannot be mended. In 2008 a Library user found an encyclopedia entitled Religion in History and the Present Day with a bookplate indicating it once belonged to a Jewish theologian. Library staff managed to find his widow in Israel, but she wrote back: \\"I appreciate your offer to return this book to me, but I have no use for it now.\\" Locations Haus Unter den Linden Haus Potsdamer Stra√üe Former Westhafen Granary housing the newspaper department and children library The State Library operates from two major public sites, Haus Unter Den Linden and Haus Potsdamer Stra√üe, called the \\"Library in Two Homes\\". There are additional subsidiary locations for newspapers, magazines, and archives not open to the public. =Haus Unter Den Linden= The original main building was built between 1908 and 1913 by the Prussian Construction and Financial Direction of Berlin, then responsible for public constructions in the city. The Neo Baroque design is by popular Wilhelmine court architect Ernst von Ihne and was further adapted by Alexander Baerwald, who was in charge of the construction management. In front of the building is an equestrian statue of Frederick the Great. The building was 40% damaged during World War II, and after the division of Berlin wound up in East Berlin. It is undergoing a major expansion by HG Merz, including a new translucent central reading room on the ruins of the old dome, and will become the main historical research library housing the collection up to and including 1945. =Haus Potsdamer Stra√üe= This is the newer building in the Kulturforum on Potsdamer Stra√üe in West Berlin, designed by Hans Scharoun with substantial participation by Edgar Wisniewski. Construction began in 1967 to house those parts of the library's evacuated holdings from the western Allied occupation zones at the end of World War II. After 11 years of construction, it was finally dedicated by Federal President Walter Scheel and opened to the public in 1978. It was renovated from 1999 to 2001. The building is currently being further redeveloped into a modern research library as a companion to the Haus Unter den Linden and will house the collection from 1946 onwards. =Additional sites= *Westhafen: located in Berlin-Moabit, this building is a renovated granary and houses the newspaper collection and the children and youth library.

Gion Matsuri is one of the largest festivals in Japan for purification and pacification of disease causing entities . It takes place in the month of July on the 17th and 24th. There are many ceremonies held during the festival, but it is best known for its parade, the . The festival takes place at the Yasaka Shrine and the festival gets its name from the Gion district of the city . Kyoto's downtown area is reserved for pedestrian traffic on the three nights leading up to the massive parade. These nights are known as (ÂÆµÂ±±) on July 16 and July 23, (ÂÆµ„ÄÖÂ±±) on July 15 and July 22, and (ÂÆµ„ÄÖ„ÄÖÂ±±) on July 14 and July 21. The streets are lined with night stalls selling food such as (barbecued chicken on skewers), , , , traditional Japanese sweets, and many other culinary delights. Women dressed in (summer kimono) walk around the area, carrying with them traditional purses and paper fans. During the evenings leading up to the parade, some private houses in the old kimono merchant district open their entryways to the public, exhibiting family heirlooms in a custom known as the By≈çbu Matsuri, or Folding Screen Festival. This provides visitors with an opportunity to visit and observe traditional Japanese residences. History =Ancient years= The parade held in Kyoto in the 1920s Traditional wooden floats in Gion Matsuri 2014. This festival originated during an epidemic in 869 as part of a purification ritual () to appease the gods thought to cause fire, floods and earthquakes. In 869, when people were suffering from a plague attributed to the rampaging deity , Emperor Seiwa ordered prayers to the god of the Yasaka Shrine, Susanoo-no- Mikoto. Sixty-six stylized and decorated halberds, one for each of the traditional provinces of Japan, were prepared and erected at Shinsen-en, a garden, along with portable shrines () from Yasaka Shrine. This practice was repeated wherever an outbreak of plague occurred. In 970, the festival became an annual event and it has since seldom failed to take place. During the Ashikaga shogunate, late 15th and early 16th century, the festival was halted. Later in the 16th century it was revived by Nobunaga. Over time the increasingly powerful and influential merchant class made the festival more elaborate and, by the Edo period (1603‚Äì1868), it was using the parade to brandish its wealth. Smaller floats lost or damaged over the centuries have been restored, and the weavers of the Nishijin area offer new tapestries to replace destroyed ones. When they are not in use, the floats and regalia are kept in special storehouses throughout the central merchant district of Kyoto. The festival serves as an important setting in Yasunari Kawabata's novel, The Old Capital in which he describes the festival, along with the Festival of Ages and the Aoi Festival, as \\"the 'three great festivals' of the old capital\\".Kawabata, Yasunari.

Festival-goers take turns getting on the float through a side building. The floats in the Yoiyama Parade are divided into two groups, the larger Hoko (\\"halberd\\") and the smaller Yama (\\"mountain\\"), and are collectively called Yamaboko (or Yamahoko) . The nine Hoko represent the 66 halberds or spears used in the original purification ritual, and the 23 Yama carry life-sized figures of famous people. All the floats are decorated with tapestries, some made in Nishijin, the textile district of Kyoto, others imported from all over the world. Musicians sit in the floats playing drums and flutes . The floats are pulled with ropes down the street and good luck favors are thrown from the floats to the crowd .In 1979 Yamahoko was listed on the Important Intangible Folk Cultural Properties. And in 2009 Yamahoko was listed on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. On the 17th the floats take the Guardian Gods from the shrine to the center of the city to a temporary dwelling . They reside here for a week and are available to parishioners . On the 24th they are taken back to the Yasaka Shrine to their permanent dwelling . On the way back to the shrine, the procession stop at the Imperial garden. At the garden the Gauardian Gods are met with offerings of food, music, and dance. Each year the families that maintain the floats draw lots at a special meeting to determine in what order they will take part in the festival. These lots are issued at a special ceremony before the parade, during which the Mayor of Kyoto dons the robes of a magistrate. On the Naginata Hoko is the , a young boy in Shinto robes and crowned with a golden phoenix, chosen from among the Kyoto merchant families as the deity's sacred page. After weeks of special purification ceremonies, during which he lives isolated from contaminating influences such as the presence of women, he is carried onto the float, as he is not permitted to touch the ground.

He was famous for his works on historical and religious subjects.  Early life  Nikolai Ge was born in Voronezh at Ivanovsky khutor (now the Shevchenkovo village) to a Russian noble family of French origin. His grandfather who was a French nobleman immigrated to the Russian Empire during the 18th century and married a Russian woman. Ge's mother died when he was three months old.https://muzei- mira.com/biografia_hudojnikov/2856-nikolaj-nikolaevich-ge-biografija.html Ge grew up on his family estate in Popelukhy near Mohyliv-Podilskyi in Podilia. His grandmother and a serf nurse cared for him.https://muzei- mira.com/biografia_hudojnikov/2856-nikolaj-nikolaevich-ge-biografija.html He graduated from the first Kyiv Gymnasium No. 1 where Mykola Kostomarov was one of his teachers. Then he studied physics and mathematics at Kyiv University and Saint Petersburg University.  Career  In 1850, Ge gave up his career in science and enrolled in the Imperial Academy of Arts in Saint Petersburg. He studied under master painter Pyotr Basin. In 1857, he graduated from the Academy where he received a gold medal for The Witch of Endor Invoking the Spirit of the Prophet Samuel. According to Ge, during that period he was strongly influenced by Karl Briullov. The gold medal secured a scholarship for Ge to study abroad. He visited Germany, Switzerland and France. In 1860 he settled in Italy where he met Alexander Andreyevich Ivanov in Rome. The Russian artist became a strong influence to Ge's future works. In 1861, Ge painted The Last Supper using a photograph of Aleksandr Ivanovich Herzen as an image for his central figure of Christ. The photograph was taken by Herzen's cousin, Russian photographer Sergei Lvovich Levitsky. Ge recounted, \\"I wanted to go to London to paint Alexander Herzen Herzen's portrait [...] and he responded to my request with a large portrait by Mr. Levitsky.\\" The final painting's similarity between the pose of Levitsky's photo of Herzen and Ge's pose of the painted Christ led the press of the day to hail the painting as \\"a triumph of materialism and nihilism.\\" This was the first known occasion where photography was used as the main source for a central character in a painting and speaks to the deep influences that photography would have later on in art and artistic movements like French Impressionism. The painting (first purchased by Tsar Alexander II of Russia) made such a strong impression when it was shown in Saint Petersburg in 1863 that Ge was made a professor of Imperial Academy of Arts. In 1864, Ge returned to Florence and painted Herzen's portrait along with the Messengers of the Resurrection and the first version of Christ on the Mount of Olives. The new paintings were not much of a success and the Imperial Academy refused to exhibit them in its annual exhibition. In 1870, Ge again returned to Saint Petersburg where he turned to Russian history for subject matter. The painting Peter the Great Interrogates Tsarevich Alexey at Peterhof (1871) was a great success, but his other historical paintings were met with little to no interest. Ge wrote that a man should live off of farming and art should not be for sale. He bought a small khutor (farm) in Chernigov gubernia (currently Ukraine) and moved there. Ge became acquainted with Leo Tolstoy around this time and became a follower of his philosophy. In the early 1880s, he returned to religious subjects and portraits. He claimed that everyone had the right to have a personal portrait and agreed to work for whatever commission the subject could afford. Among his later portrait subjects were Tolstoy, Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin and the biblical Judas. His later paintings on New Testament subjects were praised by liberal critics like Vladimir Stasov and criticized by conservatives for illustrating Ernest Renan rather than the New Testament and were banned forbidden by authorities for blasphemy. Quid Est Veritas? Christ and Pilate (1890) was also banned from an exhibition. The Judgment of the Sanhedrin: He is Guilty! (1892) was not admitted to the annual Academy of Arts exhibition; The Calvary (Golgotha) (1893) remained unfinished; The Crucifixion (1894) was banned by Tsar Alexander III. Legacy Ge died on his farm in 1894. The fate of many of his works remains a mystery. Ge had bequeathed all of his works to his Swiss benefactress, Beatrice de Vattville in exchange for a small stipend from her during his lifetime. When she died in 1952, none of Ge's works was found in her castle. Among the lost works is Ge's supposedly magnum opus painting The Crucifixion. Ge's drawings were later discovered by art collectors in Swiss second-hand stores as late as 1974. Many \\"were acquired by a young collector, Christoph Bolman [...] he had no idea of their origin, simply recognizing their value. Only some 15 years later, when he was visited during the Perestroika by Soviet acquaintances, did the attribution become clear. Negotiations for their acquisition and return to Russia ‚Äì as a full collection, rather than sold off in parts ‚Äì failed repeatedly during the 1990s. They were only concluded in 2011 after the Tretyakov Gallery was able to arrange sponsorship from a Russian state bank to purchase them for donation to the gallery's permanent collection.\\" Selected works Image:Carrara Ge.jpgCarrara at Taganrog Museum of Art File:Nikolay Ge 067.jpgPainting, 1852 File:The Judgment of the Sanhedrin- He is Guilty!.jpgThe Judgment of the Sanhedrin - He is Guilty!

In 1991, he started his own label, Accelerate, where he released a string of influential releases as DBX. Bell was influenced primarily by Chicago House as well as the works of the minimalist composers Steve Reich and Philip Glass. His productions are characterized by minimalist house grooves accented by blips and bleeps. Some tracks feature bizarre voice effects and eerie atmospherics such as 1994's delay driven \\"Losing Control\\". Bell moved behind the scenes to set up 7th City Distribution in November 1994. Smaller U.S.-based techno and house labels required distribution overseas and domestically and 7th City moved in to fill this void. However, by 1998, the number of active, independent techno labels in the U.S. dropped significantly and Bell closed the distribution company. In 2000, he relocated to Berlin, Germany, and released his first mix CD, The Button-Down Mind of Daniel Bell, on Tresor Records. 2003 brought a follow-up release on Logistic records, The Button-Down Mind Strikes Back and soon after a retrospective was released: Blip, Blurp, Bleep: The Music of Daniel Bell.

In spite of various biographical details having been created, there are no unambiguous records of his existence except in the patronymics of his sons, Garc√≠a and √ç√±igo Jim√©nez, indicating a father named Jimeno. In 850, the French court received envoys from Induo and Mitio, \\"dukes of the Navarrese\\", and it has been supposed that these names represent those of √ç√±igo Arista and Jimeno, but S√°nchez Albornoz argued against the latter identification. Likewise it has been suggested that, like his son, he may have been ruler of \\"another part of the kingdom\\" of Pamplona, or even that he was regent of the entire kingdom (for which there is no evidence). The location of his hypothetical principality has been placed around √Ålava, where a count Vela Jim√©nez, traditionally thought to have been his son (again based on patronymic), held sway.P√©rez de Urbel, \\"Jimenos y Velas\\" He has sometimes been described as Jimeno the Strong, but this results from confusion with a much earlier man of that name. Likewise, he sometimes appears as Jimeno Garc√©s due to hypotheses about his origins. The belief that he was kinsman of √ç√±igo I Arista has led to various reconstructed pedigrees, filling the gaps with otherwise unknown or chronologically misplaced individuals, the most common version making him son of a Garc√≠a Jim√©nez, and thereby making \\"Garc√©s\\" the patronymic of Jimeno. If he ruled, he was apparently succeeded in his principality by son Garc√≠a Jim√©nez. He is noteworthy as the earliest documented ancestor of a royal house --the Jim√©nez--that displaced the line of Arista in 905 and reigned in Navarre until 1234. No record of his wife remains, although historian Justo P√©rez de Urbel has suggested that he was the unnamed prince of Pamplona who married Leodegundia Ordo√±ez, daughter of King Ordo√±o I of Asturias. S√°nchez Albornoz harbors no doubts that Leodegundia married a king of Pamplona, as mentioned in the \\"C√≥dice de Roda\\" when she is called Domna Leodegundia Regina, nevertheless, he believes that she would have married a reigning king, not Jimeno of Pamplona, who would also have been much too old for her and that, in any case, the most likely candidate would have been either Garc√≠a √ç√±iguez or his son Fort√∫n Garc√©s. Jimeno had at least two children, both documented: *Garc√≠a Jim√©nez, who apparently succeeded him *√ç√±igo Jim√©nez, named as brother of Garc√≠a Jim√©nez in the C√≥dice de Roda. It has also been suggested that he was the father of two other children, although both hypotheses have been contested: *Vela Jim√©nez, founder of the Vela clan, the connection is not directly attested, but has been speculated based primarily on his patronymic, geography and chronology. *Oneca, wife of count Diogo Fernandes, the parents of several children including a Jimeno and Leodegundia and Countess Mumadona Dias. This identification is linked to P√©rez de Urbel's hypothesis that Leodegundia Ordo√±ez was Jimeno's wife but others assign Oneca other parentage and suggest that Leodegundia could have married King Garc√≠a √ç√±iguez of Pamplona.

Biography Brenner was born to Jewish parents in ≈†iauliai, Lithuania. His name at birth was Avigdor David Brenner (\\"Avigdor ben Gershon,\\" in Hebrew, as his gravestone attests), but he changed the name to Victor David Brenner. He emigrated to the United States in 1890, living mostly in the New York City area. When Brenner arrived in America, he had little more to fall back upon except the trade taught him by his father -- gem and seal engraving. This technical preparation included the tools of the sculptor's craft. He took night classes at Cooper Union. Brenner soon mastered English as he had mastered French. Eight years later Brenner was in Paris, studying with the great French medalist, Oscar Roty at the Acad√©mie Julian. There he exhibited his work and obtained awards at the Paris Exposition of 1900. He returned to the United States, and from that time on his career prospered. He appeared to be on his way to the fulfillment of the splendid predictions made for his future by Rodin. Brenner died in 1924 and is buried at Mount Judah Cemetery, Ridgewood, Queens County, New York.  Lincoln cent  The Lincoln Cent, showing placement of the initials of Victor David Brenner from 1918 onward. Brenner is probably best known for his enduring Lincoln coin design, the obverse of which is the longest-running design in United States Mint history, and perhaps the most reproduced piece of art in world history. Brenner's design had been picked by 26th U.S. President, Theodore Roosevelt, who had earlier posed for him in New York. Since arriving nineteen years earlier in the United States, Brenner had become one of the nation's premier medalists. Roosevelt had learned of Brenner's talents in a settlement house on New York City's Lower East Side and was immediately impressed with a bas-relief that Brenner had made of Lincoln, based on the early Civil War era photographer, Mathew Brady's photograph. Roosevelt, who considered Lincoln the savior of the Union, the greatest Republican President and also considered himself Lincoln's political heir, ordered the new Lincoln penny to be based on Brenner's work and that it be produced to commemorate Lincoln's 100th birthday in 1909. The likeness of President Lincoln on the obverse of the coin is an adaptation of a plaque Brenner executed several years earlier and which had come to the attention of President Roosevelt in New York. Bronze bas-reliefs dated 1907 and signed by Brenner have been identified and some sold in auctions for as much as $3,900. Charles Eliot Norton of Harvard, whom Brenner counted among his friends, gave the sculptor an unpublished portrait of Lincoln which served Brenner as a basis for Lincoln's features. He also examined other portraits.Gardner C. Teall, \\"The Lincoln Cent and its Maker,\\" Harper's Weekly, 1909, p. 24. When Brenner forwarded the model of the Lincoln cent to the Director of the Mint, the design bore his whole name, after the fashion of the signatures on the coinage of other countries, notably on the gold coins which Oscar Roty designed for France. The Director, however, decided to have the initials substituted for the name. Following the precedent of James B. Longacre, whose initials \\"JBL\\" (or simply \\"L\\") graced a number of U.S. coin designs for much of the latter half of the 19th century, Brenner placed his initials \\"VDB\\" at the bottom of the reverse between the wheat ear stalks. Widespread criticism of the initials' prominence resulted in their removal midway through 1909, the design's first year of issue. In 1918, Brenner's initials returned as small letters below Lincoln's shoulder, where they remain today. (The incorporation of the designer's initials into a coin design is now commonplace in the U.S.) 1909 VDB penny on Mars, covered in Martian dust despite its vertical mounting position. A 1909 VDB US cent was mounted on the calibration target on the Mars Curiosity rover. This is a nod to the rover's geologic mission and the common practice by geologists including a coin in photographs to document the size of objects.Catalog Page for PIA16131 Works Some of Brenner's most noteworthy sculptural works include: # Rev.

Instead food is passed around all day long and the crew works continuously. The lack of a lunch break means that crew members and the cast have to steal moments to eat. Joel Schumacher employed French hours when filming Phone Booth, a film completed in 10 days. Ridley Scott also used the approach when filming Robin Hood, noting that actors often had to eat on horseback between takes. Scott also agreed with the cast and crew that he would adhere strictly to a 10 hour shooting day due to lack of a traditional lunch break. In accordance with union rules and the SAG contract, what traditionally takes place when French hours are instituted is that the cast and crew are remunerated in the form of \\"meal penalties\\". In the film and television industry, the cast and crew are required to be officially broken for lunch six hours after their initial call time. Meal penalties are monetary compensation that are incurred every half hour after the six-hour deadline until a meal break is given, or the shoot day ends. On a film like Phone Booth, it would not be unusual for the cast and crew to receive 20 or more meal penalties.

The Jim√©nez dynasty that would later rule the kingdom of Navarre originally held a territory within that realm distinct from that held by the descendants of I√±igo Arista. Garc√≠a is presumed to have succeeded his father in this role, either during the lifetime of King Garc√≠a √ç√±iguez or of his son King Fort√∫n Garc√©s, and is called \\"king\\" by the C√≥dice de Roda, being of \\"another part of the kingdom\\" of Pamplona. There is no documentary evidence of Garc√≠a Jim√©nez playing any role in the government of the greater kingdom. However, such a role has been assigned to him. In 860, Fort√∫n Garc√©s son and heir of king Garc√≠a √ç√±iguez, was imprisoned in C√≥rdoba, and was kept there for 20 years. The traditional death date of Garc√≠a √ç√±iguez in 870 would have meant there was a de facto 10-year interregnum before the return of Fort√∫n to the kingdom. It has been suggested that Garc√≠a Jim√©nez was called 'king' due to his service as regent during this period, lasting until he was killed at Aybar (882) in a battle against the Emir of C√≥rdoba. On this basis, he is sometimes called Garc√≠a II. However, an alternative reconstruction would make the 882 casualty identical to Garc√≠a √ç√±iguez himself, thus allowing him to survive past his son's return, in which case no interregnum existed. There are likewise several references to a Sancho (presumably the son of Garc√≠a √ç√±iguez and younger brother of captive Fort√∫n) being lord of Pamplona or 'king' in the 860s and 870s. The C√≥dice de Roda shows Garc√≠a Jim√©nez to have married twice, firstly to Oneca, \\"Rebel of Sang√ºesa\\" with whom he had two children: *√ç√±igo, called 'king' in the C√≥dice de Roda when reporting his marriage to a granddaughter of Fort√∫n Garc√©s of Pamplona, but not in his own entry as son of Garc√≠a Jim√©nez. He perhaps succeeded to his father's sub-kingdom (else the term is being used as an honorific rather than a title). *Sancha, married as her first husband √ç√±igo Fort√∫nez, son of king Fort√∫n Garc√©s of Pamplona, and subsequently remarried to Galindo Azn√°rez II, Count of Aragon. Garc√≠a Jim√©nez married secondly Dadildis de Pallars, sister of count Raymond I of Pallars and Ribagorza, having by her two sons: *Sancho I, later sole king of Pamplona. *Jimeno, tutor of his nephew Garc√≠a S√°nchez and regent until his death on 29 May 931.

The boats from Niphon were sent to destroy Hebe, but were swamped in heavy seas and their crews captured. Then opened fire on Hebe and she was burned to the waterline.  Niphon captures the large blockade runner Ella and Annie  With , Niphon captured the steamer Cornubia north of New Inlet on 8 November. Cornubia‚Äôs papers exposed the whole scheme by which the Confederacy had clandestinely obtained ships in England. The next day Niphon captured the blockade runner Ella and Annie off Masonboro Inlet, North Carolina, attempting to slip in with a cargo of arms and provisions. Trying to escape, the runner rammed Niphon but surrendered to Federal bluejackets who boarded her when the ships had swung broadside. Ella and Annie was later commissioned in the Union Navy as . After capturing Ella and Annie, Niphon returned to Boston for repairs, but was back off New Inlet on 6 February 1864. On 21 April, Niphon, , and destroyed the salt works at Masonboro Sound, North Carolina. On 27 August, Niphon and ventured up Masonboro Inlet to silence a Confederate battery. Landing parties from the ships captured arms, ammunition, and food stuffs. A boat expedition from Niphon landed at Masonboro Inlet on 19 September to gain intelligence on the defenses of Wilmington, North Carolina. They learned that raider and several blockade runners were at Wilmington. That day Acting Master Edmund Kemble relieved Breck in command.  Attacking blockade runners  On 25 September, Niphon, Howquah, and , in an engagement with blockade runner Lynx and Confederate shore batteries, chased the blazing steamer ashore where she burned until consumed. Late on the night of 29 September, Niphon fired upon Night Hawk as she attempted to run into New Inlet, and observed her go aground. A boat crew led by Acting Ensign Semon boarded the steamer and, under fire from Fort Fisher, set her ablaze and brought off the crew as prisoners.  Mrs. Rose O‚ÄôNeal Greenhow drowns with a bag of gold around her neck  Niphon ran the British blockade runner Condor aground off New Inlet on 1 October, but was prevented from destroying the steamer by intense fire from Fort Fisher. Among the passengers on board Condor was one of the most famous Confederate agents of the war, Mrs. Rose O'Neal Greenhow who, fearful of being captured with her important dispatches, set out in a boat for shore. Her craft overturned in the heavy surf. The crew managed to get ashore; but the lady, weighted down by $2,000 in Confederate gold in a pouch around her neck, drowned.  Niphon, under fire, saves a stranded Berberry  On the 7th, the Union blockader chased the blockade runner Annie ashore at New Inlet, under the guns of Fort Fisher, but the 285-ton Federal wooden steamer ran aground herself and was destroyed to prevent capture. Niphon rescued Aster‚Äôs crew under a hail of fire from Confederate batteries and towed out , after the Northern steamer had become disabled trying to pull Aster off the shoal. On the last day of October, and Niphon seized another blockade runner named Annie off New Inlet, North Carolina. She was a British steamer with cargo of tobacco, cotton, and turpentine.  End-of-war decommissioning and sale  Late in November Niphon, in need of extensive repairs, steamed to Boston where she was decommissioned on 1 December. She was sold at public auction there on 17 April 1865, and was documented as Tejuca on 23 October 1865 and was sold abroad in 1867.

It is located about halfway between Las Vegas, and Taos on Highway 518, at an altitude of 7,180 feet. The Republic of Texas performed a semi-official raid on Mora in 1843. Two short battles of Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War were fought in Mora in 1847, where US troops eventually defeated the Hispano and Puebloan militia, effectively ending the Taos Revolt in the Mora Valley. The latter battle destroyed most of the community, necessitating its re-establishment. Mora is today three plazas and four settlements: Mora proper, Cleveland (originally named San Antonio), and Chacon with plazas, and Holman (without a plaza, and originally named Agua Negra) lying between Chacon and Cleveland. In the mid-19th century, there were just two settlements, Upper and Lower Mora. History David F. Cargo Library in Mora Court House, Mora County, New Mexico = Early settlement of the area = Spanish settlers had sporadically occupied what is now known as the Mora Valley since the late 18th century. The surviving written history of the settlement of Mora dates to 1818, when a group of settlers petitioned to build a church in what was then named Lo de Mora;, or in long form ; they had come from (originally Caypa Pueblo, and today named Ohkay Owingeh). However, Mora was formally founded as a Hispanic farming community ‚Äì after Mexican independence from Spain ‚Äì upon a land grant issued September 28, 1835, by Centralist Republic of Mexico Governor of Nuevo Mexico Albino P√©rez, It provided title to a strip of Mora Valley land to each of dozens of families willing to settle there. Despite fanciful stories about subsistence on berries (mora means 'mulberry' in Spanish), the valley, the river, the town, and eventually the county appear to have taken their name from the family name Mora, borne by several of the settlers. While mulberry trees are found in the area, they are not native to the Americas and thus were brought by Spanish or later settlers. The whole of eastern New Mexico was claimed by the breakaway Republic of Texas in 1836, and became nominally US territory after of the Texas annexation in 1845, but was treated by the US and many residents as a militarily occupied territory until 1848. = The town = The settlement, of Hispanos from elsewhere in New Mexico and local Puebloans, was well established by 1843, when there was a raid on the town by freebooters from the Republic of Texas under Colonel Charles A. Warfield claiming that the people in Mora had purchased stolen Texan cattle from the Comanche. The Texans killed five men and took eighteen women and children captive, as well as 75 horses. The people of the Mora Valley convened a posse, overtook the Texans, and sent them back to Texas on foot. Mora was subject to occupying United States control under the US provisional government of New Mexico beginning in 1846, during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican war. The town, then consisting of the two settlements of Upper and Lower Mora, (sometimes misspelled \\"Moro\\" in American documents of the era) was the site of two armed conflicts between United States Army troops and a militia of Hispano and Puebloan Mexican-nationalists, in the Taos Revolt, a guerilla campaign of the war. In the First Battle of Mora, on January 24, 1847, a group of over 150 New Mexican resistance fighters repelled an expedition of 80 US Army troops, and killed their commander, Captain Israel R. Hendley, and several others. On February 1, Capt. Jesse I. Morin and his 200 men, with artillery, destroyed the village and surrounding ranches and crops, in retaliation. This sent surviving combatant and civilian residents of Mora and its environs fleeing into and over the mountains to other settlements. The town was rebuilt some time later, after crops could be re-established. This destruction has made historical and genealogical research on Mora difficult beyond 1848, because most early records went up in flames with the buildings. The entire war ended February 3, 1848, with all of New Mexico then under official US control, as the Mexican Cession of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo relinquished all claims by Mexico to lands north of the Rio Grande. The New Mexico Territory was formalized by the Compromise of 1850. The US Army controversially built Fort Union in 1851 on private Mora Grant land in the valley, along the Santa Fe Trail; while this sparked decades of unresolved legal actions, local farmers sold crops to the fort, which was a new and reliable source of income to the community, and the population swelled. Ceran St. Vrain, an American veteran of the Taos Revolt (originally from St. Louis in what was then the French Upper Louisiana Territory), settled in Mora in 1853; he built a grist mill, and became a major supplier of flour, grain, and fodder to the fort. The ruins of St. Vrain's mill still sit one block north of Mora's main street. The county of Mora was established in the territory on February 1, 1860. Mora continued to grow as an agricultural community; by the late 19th century, there were five mills operating in Mora, though Fort Union, after being rebuilt for a second time, was finally closed in 1891. The population peaked around 1920, declined markedly for several decades, then stabilized in the 1970s. It remains about 80% hispanic. Cultural references One of Frank Waters's most popular novels, People of the Valley () takes place high in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains where an isolated Spanish-speaking community (based on Mora) confront a threatening world of change. The settlement is mentioned in Willa Cather's 1927 historical novel Death Comes for the Archbishop(Book Two, Chapter 2), about the establishment of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Santa Fe. Mora was also in Louis L'Amour's Western novel The Daybreakers, in which the character Orrin Sackett is the fictional marshal of Mora.

For fifteen years, The Wolfsonian has been a division within Florida International University. The Wolfsonian's two collections comprise approximately 180,000 pieces from the period 1885 to 1945 ‚Äî the height of the Industrial Revolution until the end of the Second World War ‚Äî in a variety of media, including: furniture; industrial-design objects; works in glass; ceramics; metal; rare books; periodicals; ephemera; works on paper; paintings; textiles; and medals. The museum is an affiliate within the Smithsonian Affiliations program, sharing affiliation with the Frost Art Museum. The countries most strongly represented are Germany, Great Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, and the United States. There are also significant holdings from a number of other countries, including Austria, Czechoslovakia, France, Hungary, Japan, and the former Soviet Union. Among the collection‚Äôs strengths are: the British Arts & Crafts movement; Dutch and Italian variants of the Art Nouveau style; American industrial design; objects and publications from world‚Äôs fairs; propaganda from the First and Second World Wars and the Spanish Civil War; New Deal graphic and decorative arts; avant-garde book design; and publications and design drawings relating to architecture. History Entry to The Wolfsonian-FIU from Washington Avenue. The carved sandstone frieze above the entrance is typical of Spanish Renaissance and Baroque-revival architecture.The Wolfsonian is named for Mitchell Wolfson Jr., a Miami Beach native and collector and expert on modern design, architecture, and the decorative arts. Wolfson began amassing much of what is now The Wolfsonian's collections of rare books and objects in the 1970s. He began to store his collection at the Washington Storage Company facility on Washington Avenue in Miami Beach, which had been operating since 1926. In 1986, with 90% of the facility's storage space occupied by his collection, he bought the building and established The Wolfsonian Foundation in order to oversee the collection and make it available to researchers and scholars for research. He hired Peggy Loar, as the Foundation's founding director, who brought in experts in the fields to begin to document, research, and publish what the collection held. In 1992, Wolfson hired the architect Mark Hampton to expand and renovate the Washington Storage Company building and convert it into a museum and research center. Hampton, in collaboration with architect William Kearns, transformed the building to include a sleekly modernist lobby, museum caf√© and shop, and, upstairs, permanent and temporary galleries dramatically arranged around light wells, a library, offices, and storage. The museum opened to the public in 1995. Loar departed the museum in fall 1996 and the Foundation Board hired Cathy Leff, then-vice president of The Wolfson Initiative Corporation and executive editor and publisher of The Journal of Decorative and Propaganda Arts, to step in as interim director. On behalf of Wolfson and the Board, Cathy Leff negotiated the gifting of the collection and its state-of-the-art museum facility to Florida International University. The acquisition of this gift was approved by the Florida State Legislature in 1997, and The Wolfsonian officially became a department of the Florida International University in Miami in July of that year. Since 1995, The Wolfsonian has exhibited both selections from the collection in permanent galleries as well as temporary exhibitions drawn from its collections and loaned from outside collections. As part of its commitment to support the arts, The Wolfsonian has also hosted temporary exhibitions of work by contemporary artists. It also maintains a teaching gallery at the Frost Art Museum on the Modesto Maidique Campus of FIU in western Miami, where FIU faculty often co-curate shows drawing on items in The Wolfsonian collections in conjunction with their classes. It regularly serves as a venue for community engagement with the arts, including children's programs, lectures and conferences, contemporary art shows, and musical performances. It offers fellowships for visiting scholars and researchers and actively supports the use of its collections by FIU classes. Toaster on display in the Wolfsonian- FIU's permanent galleriesIn 2009, The Wolfsonian-FIU, which is located several miles away from FIU's two large campuses in western Miami and the northern end of Biscayne Bay, received a three-year grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to strengthen its ties with FIU faculty and staff; the Mellon Foundation awarded the museum another three-year grant beginning in 2012, to run through 2015. The museum has used the awards to expand its grant programs to faculty to incorporate the collections into their classes, provide fellowships for graduate students at FIU to research the collections for theses and dissertations and publications, hold scholarly conferences, host research fellows from outside FIU working on relevant topics to the collections, and expand opportunities for FIU faculty to help curate exhibitions from the museum's collections. In 2012, The Wolfsonian completed a new strategic plan that would guide its next level of development, as it had successfully transitioned from a private collection to a reputable museum and research center. In recognition of its new plan and to encourage greater access to the collection, physically and online, it was awarded a $5 million grant from the John S and James L. Knight Foundation. This involves the renovation of the museum's main building on Washington Avenue and offsite storage in order to improve access to the collections by both FIU faculty and students and outside researchers. These changes are projected to take place over the next several years. It is expected that both the Mellon grants and the Knight grant will also facilitate the continued documentation of the collection and its dissemination in digital form online to an even broader public. Mitchell Wolfson has continued to collect after donating a large portion of his holdings to The Wolfsonian. He maintains a separate but very similarly-themed private object and library collection in downtown Miami, known as the Mitchell Wolfson, Jr. Study and Research Centre, the contents of which will eventually be acquired by The Wolfsonian and integrated into its collections. The grants that The Wolfsonian has received recently are intended to help accommodate the absorption of these objects and printed materials over the next several years. Cathy Leffhttp://www.wolfsonian.org/content/leff%E2%80%99s-accomplishments-pave-way- next-generation remained director of the museum until April 1, 2014. The Wolfsonian was the first public building to have air conditioning installed. Locations Tiles of the fa√ßade of the Norris Theater, Norristown, Pennsylvania, built in 1929‚Äì30. The building was demolished in 1982, and these pieces were salvaged and have been reassembled in the lobby of the Wolfsonian- FIU as the backdrop to this fountain.The Wolfsonian is considered one of the seven campuses of FIU. Its facilities consist of the main building at 1001 Washington Avenue, the former Washington Storage Company building. The lower three floors of the structure were originally constructed by the architectural firm of Robertson & Patterson in the Spanish Renaissance style in 1926, then the popular choice for structures in South Florida, largely due to the region's long and well-known Spanish colonial heritage. Two floors were added by architect Robert M. Little in 1936. The building retained its five-floor configuration until 1986, when Mitchell Wolfson Jr. bought it. The storage facility was designed with a tall ground floor space and large main entry to accommodate cars. It was envisioned that automobiles carrying large pieces of furniture would drive through the main gate into what is now the lobby, where their contents would be unloaded and placed in a freight elevator (the first in Miami Beach and still in operation) which would take the large items to the storage levels on the upper floors. There was no storage space on the ground floor in order to protect the items in storage from potential flooding during rainstorms and especially hurricanes. The building contains thick concrete walls in order to maintain a cool, constant temperature and to keep out humidity. It was principally used by wealthy northerners from New York, Philadelphia, Boston, and other major cities who maintained winter vacation homes in Miami and, before the days of air-conditioning, needed space to store their home furnishings during the summer to protect them from the hot and humid Florida weather. In 1992, the structure was renovated and expanded to transform it into a combined museum and research center. Two more floors, the sixth and seventh levels, were added by Mark Hampton and William S. Kearns. The fifth floor was converted into permanent gallery space for The Wolfsonian's collections, while the sixth and seventh floors house temporary exhibitions. The fourth floor contains storage space for part of the object collections. The third floor contains the Wolfsonian's research library of some 60,000 items, including rare books and periodicals, pamphlets, and other printed materials and ephemera, including items as diverse as brochures, prints, timetables, advertising flyers, artist portfolios, calendars, and matchbook covers. The ground floor contains the lobby and museum caf√©, bookstore and gift shop. Many parts of the building include permanent decorative and functional elements from the original Washington Storage Company, such as its doors to storage vaults, as well as items salvaged from other destroyed structures and reinstalled in the Wolfsonian. Most of the Wolfsonian's vast object collections of some 120,000 items are stored offsite in an old Bell Telephone building. The items housed there are currently only accessible to non-museum personnel by special request, though it is believed that the museum's long-term plans are to renovate its offsite storage to make these collections more available to FIU students, faculty, and outside researchers. It is possible that such renovations will include the addition of classroom space. Principal collections Interior view of part of the permanent galleries at the WolfsonianThe Wolfsonian consists of two collections: its library collection, which consists of some 60,000 smaller- format works on paper, and the object collection, which includes all three- dimensional objects and large-format works on paper, such as posters, as well as a large collection of modern paintings. Most of the collections at The Wolfsonian were donated by Mitchell Wolfson, Jr., but the museum also holds large numbers of items acquired through other donations, purchases, and long- term loans. The Wolfsonian library is non-circulating, but it is open regularly to researchers and scholars, though scheduling an appointment is necessary. Their holdings are entirely searchable through the catalog on The Wolfsonian's website. The object collections not on view are available by appointment only and subject to accessibility. Its holdings are only partially searchable online via the museum's collection of digital images. Contact with the museum staff is required to learn the full extent of what the object collection contains. The flags that fly from poles above the main entrance on Washington Avenue are those of the countries most prominently represented in The Wolfsonian's collections. Between them, the two collections' holdings can be divided into several principal areas: * American Industrial Design ‚Äì posters, graphic designs, patent models, trade catalogs and samples, as well as objects such as cameras, clocks, radios, and phonographs. Designers include Donald Deskey, Walter Dorwin Teague, Kem Weber, and John Vassos * British Arts and Crafts Movement ‚Äì works by C. R. Ashbee, Christopher Dresser, Ernest Gimson, Charles Rennie Mackintosh, William Morris, M. H. Baillie Scott.

Propaganda from Russia/USSR, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Spain are well represented. The British, Dutch, German, Italian, and American holdings may be the most comprehensive in the United States. * Transportation and travel ‚Äì objects relating to ocean liners, airplanes, zeppelins, and trains * World's Fairs and expositions ‚Äì furnishings, sculpture, paintings, and ephemera from World's Fairs since 1851. Prominently represented expositions include the 1902 Prima Esposizione Internazionale d'Arte Decorativa Moderna in Turin; the 1925 Exposition Internationale des Arts D√©coratifs et Industriels Modernes in Paris; the 1933 Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago; and the 1939 World's Fair in New York. In early 2006, the Wolfsonian-FIU opened a branch institution in Nervi, on the Italian Riviera. The sister museum is housed in a renovated school overlooking the sea, and is administered by the City of Genoa and the Region of Liguria. It features mainly Italian fine and decorative arts, design, and architecture. Publications Austrian Art Nouveau sideboard in collection of the Wolfsonian-FIU, seen in offsite storageThe Wolfsonian has published catalogues of some of its exhibitions and parts of its collections, and there are plans to produce publications more frequently of future museum exhibitions.

He appears in Arabic records as Forto√ªn ibn Garsiya (ŸÅÿ±ÿ™ŸàŸÜ ÿ®ŸÜ ÿ∫ÿ±ÿ≥Ÿäÿ©). He was the eldest son of Garc√≠a I√±√≠guez and grandson of √ç√±igo Arista, the first king of Pamplona. Reigning for about thirty years, Fort√∫n Garc√©s would be the last king of the √ç√±iguez dynasty.  Biography  Fort√∫n was born at an unknown date, being the eldest son of Garc√≠a √ç√±iguez, king of Pamplona, and a woman named Urraca, who could have been the granddaughter of Musa ibn Musa ibn Qasi, the leader of the Banu Qasi clan. Little is known about his early life. King Garc√≠a √ç√±iguez had worked towards a closer relationship with the Kingdom of Asturias, distancing himself and his kingdom from the Banu Qasi dynasty that ruled the lands near the Ebro river. He was involved in repeated armed conflicts with the Muslim forces of the Banu Qasi, and Muhammad I, emir of C√≥rdoba, who invaded Pamplona in the year 860 and captured Fort√∫n in Milagro, along with his daughter Onneca Fort√∫nez and took them hostages in C√≥rdoba. The Wali of Zaragoza Muhammad ibn Lubb besieged and ultimately destroyed the castle of Aibar, resulting in the death of the king Garc√≠a √ç√±iguez. After the death of his father, Fort√∫n Garc√©s was allowed to return to Pamplona to take his place as king. Fort√∫n Garc√©s reigned with a policy very accommodating to the wishes of the Banu Qasi clan, which caused anger within the Pamplonese nobility. He would frequently retire to the Monastery of Leyre.Royal pantheon in the Monastery of Leyre A drastic change took place in 905, when Sancho Garc√©s was chosen by the Pamplonese nobility to replace Fort√∫n Garc√©s as king. The reasons behind this decision reside in the fact that Sancho Garc√©s had a very well respected military prestige and had the support of important figures such as Raymond I, Count of Pallars and Ribagorza, Galindo Azn√°rez II, Count of Aragon and Alfonso III, King of Asturias. Fort√∫n Garc√©s permanently retired to the Monastery of Leyre in 905, where he died in 922.

Career  He was the former Senior Vice President of Software Engineering at Apple Inc., where he worked from 1997 to 2011. He succeeded Avie Tevanian in the position in July 2003. In this position he was primarily responsible for the release of Mac OS X (including 10.4 Tiger, 10.5 Leopard and 10.6 Snow Leopard). He led development of the Workspace manager in NeXTSTEP and OPENSTEP. Before joining Apple he worked at Xerox PARC and NeXT. Serlet spoke at WWDC 2006 on the perceived similarities between Mac OS X Tiger and Windows Vista, including comparing Apple's Aqua interface and Microsoft's Aero interface. He poked fun at the apparent visual similarities and referenced a 2004 WWDC banner that read, \\"Redmond, start your photocopiers\\" -- a reference to Microsoft headquarters, which is located in Redmond, Washington. He also spoke at WWDC 2009 and gave an in-depth demonstration of Snow Leopard, which included further references to Microsoft's Windows operating system -- claiming that Windows 7 is just another version of their widely criticized Vista release, citing the ongoing use of the Windows Registry, DLLs, the User Account Control (UAC) subsystem and existence of an interactive disk defragmenter. On March 23, 2011, Apple announced that Serlet was leaving the company \\"to focus less on products and more on science.\\" According to Business Insider, he has founded a startup in cloud computing called Upthere along with other former Apple employees. In November, 2012, Upthere raised an undisclosed amount of venture capital funding from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Elevation Partners, and Google Ventures.

Created by Peter David and Bill Mumy, it premiered on March 2, 1996 and ended on January 27, 1997 with reruns until 1998. It aired for a time on Nickelodeon's Saturday night block of shows known as SNICK, and on Nickelodeon UK, with reruns on Family and TVOntario in Canada. An episode aired on TeenNick in the US as part of its The '90s Are All That block on the night of October 14, 2011 for the block's U Pick with Stick line-up, and again on December 27, 2011 for Party Like It's the '90s. Space Cases returned once again on the night of January 1, 2016 on TeenNick during the new The Splat programming block but has not aired since; the first four episodes of Season One were aired. The show's premise revolves around a group of misfit students and two adults who are stranded far from home aboard an alien ship. Their attempts at journeying back see many dangerous adventures and controversies, with some occasionally more mature themes. The series was shot in Montreal, Quebec. Because of budget constraints, props from Are You Afraid of the Dark? and other Nickelodeon programs were used in the series. In other episodes, more mundane props were used, as in the episode \\"Homeward Bound,\\" the character Suzee is sitting in a chair with compact discs pasted to either side. During the first season, electronic games such as Lights Out, were used as control panels on walls. Season One's original theme song was orchestra-based, with an announcer voiceover giving a preamble. A vocal song telling the story of the Space Cases was used as the closing. For Season Two, this song was moved to the front and re-recorded to accommodate the removal of Catalina, the addition of Suzee, and some re-arranging to how the characters were presented. At some point after the series ended, Nickelodeon had the song re-recorded once more, using the same character arrangement as Season Two, but removing Suzee and adding Catalina back in, and created a new opening for the Season One episodes with this song. The series features a multitude of celebrity guest stars throughout its run, including George Takei, Mark Hamill, Bill Mumy, Katey Sagal, Michelle Trachtenberg, Danny Tamberelli and Robin Leach. Characters *Theresa James \\"T.J.\\" Davenport (Cary Lawrence) is the children's vice principal, but serves as their teacher aboard the Christa. Davenport takes herself and the rest of the universe a little too seriously. She has a habit of fainting at the first sign of danger, but on several occasions has stood strong in the face of terrible danger, even though she ends up bluffing some of the time. In one episode, she becomes curious of Thelma's activities, and accidentally downloads herself, literally, into the ship's computers; her mood swings caused problems with the navigation until she was rescued. *Commander Seth Goddard (Paul Boretski) is a former Stardog, and fought in the Spung War. Busted in rank from Captain and forced to teach the \\"Space Cases,\\" Goddard is tough enough to whip the kids into shape, though his rigidity sometimes entices the kids to provoke him and Miss Davenport with practical jokes. He has a long and bitter rivalry with a space pirate named Reaver. It is revealed in the second-season episode \\"Long Distance Calls\\" that Goddard was busted in rank for \\"almost starting a war\\" with Reaver. Goddard's backstory is one of the least explained in the series, and Reaver's appearance in the episode (whose entrance into the plot is explained by the creation of a communications device that the Christa's crew has possession of and Reaver wants to steal) raises more questions than answers. For example, Reaver can hold his own in a fight against Radu, who is Andromedan and allegedly has the strength of ten Earth men. Reaver even, for a time, 'psychically' combats Suzee who, up to this point in the series, never had problems pitching her consciousness into another entity to control them. *Harlan Band (Walter Emanuel Jones) is a human from Earth, and is attending the Academy to become a Stardog like his biological father, who was killed by an Andromedan during the Andromedan War. Because of this, he is often antagonistic and prejudiced against Radu, at least during Season One. Harlan is headstrong and the self- appointed leader of the students, acting as pilot on the bridge. However, he is extremely overconfident, which sometimes leads to his endangering the crew. Harlan displays advanced martial arts and gymnastics skills. Jones is also credited as stunt coordinator in an episode of Space Cases. *Catalina (Jewel Staite) is a rainbow-haired female ship's engineer from Titan, a moon of Saturn. Saturnians possess evolved vocal patterns, giving them and Catalina the ability to release destructive sonic screams. Though hers have disabled missiles, floored large attackers and assaulted the ship and all its contents, Catalina considers her powers to be \\"nothing\\" compared to the really skilled Saturnians who are known to shatter buildings with a single sonic blast. Catalina is often heard using the term \\"grozit\\" which appears to be a Saturnian non-vulgar expletive, similar in usage to the word \\"Heavens,\\" in context such as \\"Heavens, no/grozit, no.\\" Series co-creator Peter David has used the curse \\"grozit\\" in his Star Trek: New Frontier novels and Captain Marvel comics. Initially, Catalina carries on conversations with Suzee, a person whom she explains is an invisible friend that no one else can see, but her crewmates initially believe Suzee to be an imaginary friend, despite Catalina's insistence to the contrary. In the Season 1 finale, \\"On the Road to Find Out\\", Suzee is explicitly revealed to be a real person, played by Rebecca Herbst. It is explained that Suzee existed in another dimension, on a planet called Yensid. In Season One, Catalina explains that their brainwaves are attuned to the same sonic frequency, allowing them to speak and even see each other as though they are in the same room (Catalina even turns to face Suzee as she talks to her). Catalina even tells the others that she can see Suzee, but no one else can. In Season Two, when Suzee and Catalina trade places, Catalina lives at Suzee's home and is not present on the ship in the same manner that Suzee seemed to be during Season One. During the second season, Suzee explains that something blocks off her ability to communicate with Catalina interdimensionally, which may have something to do with the reason why Suzee cannot see Catalina the same way Catalina saw Suzee in Season One. Staite would again play a young engineer on a spaceship years later as Kaylee Frye in the cult television series Firefly. *Radu (Kristian Ayre) is a being from a planet called Andromeda (most people assume this to mean that he is from the Andromeda Galaxy). He has no real family, since Andromedans are hatched from eggs. Radu has super-sensitive hearing and superhuman strength, just as all Andromedans do, which was the reason behind the Spungs enslaving them and starting the Andromedan War. Radu suffers from an inferiority complex; as such, he tries his very hardest to get people to like him. The Andromedan culture is based on uniformity of mind and purpose, making Radu's desire to have a family and be his own person an anomaly of character. Radu has an appreciable sense of direction, which makes him the best candidate for the ship's navigator, forcing him to work in conjunction with the pilot, rival Harlan Band. Andromedans not only possess an internal temperature, but an internal barometric pressure as well. For this reason, when ill, snow may exude from an Andromedan's ears. Radu has a significantly greater molecular density than most humanoids, which accounts for his superior strength, and long hair, which is nearly impossible to cut. In the episode \\"Desperately Seeking Suzee,\\" when the Christa is knocked around, and the entire crew is thrust, Radu who stands comfortably still with his arms crossed. He is also more patient, logical and realistic than the rest of the crew, especially Harlan. *Bova (Rahi Azizi) is from Uranus. Members of his race have a small, pronged antenna growing from their forehead which can generate powerful blasts of electricity. Bova has an incredible metabolism that supplements his advanced energy production, which is the reason for his incredible appetite. He will eat nearly anything, and is always hungry. Being from Uranus, and thereby \\"the butt of every joke,\\" he is consistently pessimistic in every situation, a Uranian cultural trait. Bova is responsible for operating and monitoring the Christa's shields. The nature of Bova's name is never explained, but in the Season Two episode \\"Long Distance Calls,\\" when Bova's father, Benn, calls to speak to his son. This is a reference to science fiction writer Ben Bova. *Rosie Ianni (Paige Christina) is from Mercury, and has the ability to produce vast amounts of heat at will. At the beginning of the series, she wears a helmet to help her control this ability, but it falls into disuse in subsequent episodes, revealing her naturally bald head, a trait of Mercurians. Because Mercury is so close to the Sun, all Mercurians have a tendency to \\"look on the bright side\\" of things, and as a result, Rosie is the mothering influence within the crew, always trying to make sure that her fellow cadets are happy and getting along. She serves as a doctor/scientist as well as acting as the communications officer on the bridge. She has a tendency to adopt seemingly cute things that turn out to be troublesome for the crew. At one point in the series, Rosie temporarily took on the power to generate telekinetic energy blasts. *Thelma (Techno Human EmuLating MAchine) (Anik Matern), the mysterious ship's only native inhabitant, is an android who often malfunctions, owing in no small part to the fact that her memory chip, a small gem residing in her forehead, is cracked. (It is unclear whether the crystal was cracked when Harlan stepped on it, or if the damage was preexisting.) She has a habit of taking things too literally, and often does not realize moderately obvious things. In season 2, her appearance changes to reflect the altered appearance of the Christa following the emergency crash on a planet. Her color changes from copper to silver and her gem changes from amber to sapphire. *Suzee (Rebecca Herbst) is Catalina's best friend, and is believed to be imaginary by the crew throughout Season One. Following Catalina's apparent death at the end of Season One, Suzee joins the crew in her stead. Suzee's hair is similar to Catalina's, but is longer and actually shows up as colored streaks interspersed through her predominantly brunette hair. She is very intelligent (she is said to be \\"smarter than a million books\\" in the revised opening title sequence that includes her character) and has two sets of gills just beneath both sides of her clavicle that allow her to breathe in any atmosphere, though not in the vacuum of space. A bit overconfident herself, and sometimes at odds with Miss Davenport for being treated like a child despite not officially being one of her students, Suzee is also a telepath who can read others' minds and project her consciousness into other people's minds in order to possess their bodies. This ability even extends to sentient computers, such as Pezu in the series finale \\"A Friend in Need\\". Suzee often acts as a rival to Harlan. Rosie once accidentally blurts out that Suzee is attracted to Radu. *Elmira (Katie Emme McIninch) is a frequent ally of the Christa crew. She is a Spung oracle and as such, the crew did not trust her at first (especially Radu). Due to Spung society having a low opinion of their women, Elmira ran away from home years ago. Despite her upbringing, she is quite gentle and pleasant, if rather secretive. Although Radu at first despises her for her origins, the two grow close and kiss twice. It is revealed in the Season One finale that she is Warlord Shank's daughter. She gives the first foreshadowing of Catalina's later \\"death\\" when she predicts that someone new will come and Catalina will disappear. *Warlord Shank (George Takei), is a Spung commander who is a deadly space pirate and adversary for the crew of the Christa, having elite Spung officers under his command. He first appears in his Killcruiser when he intercepts and threatens to destroy the Christa after discovering that his daughter Elmira, a Spung princess and love interest of Radu, could be on board. Shank develops into a major villain throughout the run of the series. =Additional cast= * Mark Hamill as Pel * Bill Mumy as Jin * Serge Houde as Neinstein * Daisy Eagan as Sofiana Mrtz * Mark Camacho as Warden Opus * Jim Bradford as Dram * Zachary Ouimet as Kirge * Peter David as Benn * Chip Chiupka as Reaver * Alexander Chapman as Ubi * Robin Leach as Utz * David Schramm as Yee Haw Jones * Marcel Jeannin as Jesse * Ted Jessup as Gunter Ianni Synopsis In the first episode of the series, a small group of misfits are kept behind from a Space Academy field trip. Nearby, an odd bird-like alien ship appears, and Harlan Band decides to sneak onto it; the other students, all of whom are younger and much less troublesome, follow Harlan onto the ship. During their exploration of the ship's interior, the organic ship bonds to each student when each touches a bulkhead. TJ Davenport, their teacher and principal, and Commander Seth Goddard go after them and, in a series of unfortunate events, become separated throughout the vessel. One of the students accidentally charges the engines, hurtling the ship off into a spatial rift. By the time everyone figures out that only the children who bonded to the ship can actually control it, the ship has stopped several light years away from the Academy. They set off on a return trip which would take them at least seven years, four months, and twenty-two days at maximum speeds.

The development of Jonah was enabled by new approaches to the geology and engineering. The McMurry group with the help of their engineering consultant, James Shaw, experimented with energized and multiple stage fracture treatments, revolutionizing gas development where 2,500 feet of section was treated (instead of only 250 feet) and wells were drilled on very close spacing - as little as 10 acre centers. The 'Basin-centered' geology model was radically changed by Warner to the 'Compartmentalization model' which enabled the entire field to be developed with virtually no dry holes, a cost savings of several hundred millions of dollars.

Development Jonah Field is known for being one of the largest on-shore natural gas discoveries in the USA in the early 1990s. The startling fact is that Jonah has a surface area of approximately one township yet it contains of gas. In comparison, the Hugoton Field covers most of the southwest portion of Kansas, a 14 county area, yet it contained only about three times the volume of gas in Jonah. The principal technical challenge in Jonah was the identification and stimulation of productive intervals in a to section of stacked lenticular fluvial sand/silt/shale sequences which comprise the Upper Mesaverde, Lance, and Unnamed Tertiary formations. Previous attempts to fracture treat Lance sandstones in the Jonah and Pinedale Fields areas had all ended in failure. The McMurry group used new energized foam fracture technology and then went on to successfully stack fracture treatments, one after another. This revolutionary approach increased per well reserves from 1.5 BCF to 6.5 BCF. The original Jonah partners (see History), due to a lack of interest from Northwest Pipeline, were forced to form Johah Gas Gathering, LLC. They found new ways of inexpensively building pipelines using a proprietary engineering system called Zaplocking. The entire initial out-of-pocket expense for the pipeline system was about $150,000. Today the system is worth an estimated $4 billion. All the Jonah partners sold out to EnCana Oil and Gas in April 2000 except Warner who held on until gas went from $2/mcf to $12/mcf. Warner sold out to the Williams Company in December, 2000. The principal gas companies currently developing the field are the EnCana Corporation and Linn Energy. Other active gas companies involved in the Jonah Field include Ultra Petroleum, Yates Petroleum and Hogshead Spouter. Other large natural gas fields in and around Sublette County, Wyoming include the Pinedale Anticline, the Wamsutter gas field, and several sour gas H2S fields operated by ExxonMobil.

Burridge's Multilingual Dictionary of Birds of the World: Volume II. pp. 14 (Lophonetta specularioides) is a species of duck native to South America, the belonging to the monotypic genus Lophonetta. It is sometimes included in Anas, but it belongs to a South American clade that diverged early in dabbling duck evolution. There are two subspecies: L. specularioides alticola (Andean crested duck) and L. specularioides specularioides (Patagonian crested duck). The Patagonian crested duck is also called the southern crested duck and its range lies in the Falklands, Chile, and Argentina. Mountain Lake at ~4000 m (~13100 ft) - Peru  Description  The crested duck is a medium-sized waterfowl species, with adult males reaching up to just over a kilogram. Males and females look similar, with males having a slightly more prominent crest than females. The feathers of the mantle, back and scapulars are dark brown with pale centers, giving a mottled appearance. The abdomen, flanks and tail coverts are light gray, with the tail itself being distinctly elongated and black. The upperwing is gray brown to light brown, with the secondaries having an iridescent coppery to greenish sheen, with a broad back band behind, narrowly edged with white. Juveniles are similar but lack crests, have light brown faces, and paler abdomens than adults.  Distribution and habitat  Crested ducks are endemic to South America. The two subspecies occupy different elevations in the Andes, with Lophonetta s. alticola occurring from 2500-4800m from Peru to central Chile and Lophonetta s. specularioides occurring below 1500m in the southern Andes near Patagonia and the Falkland Islands. The two subspecies co-occur in a zone of intermediate elevational habitats in Mendoza, Argentina and Talca, Chile. The crested duck is found in lakes, marshes, and grassy areas from shallow coastal bays to high elevation lakes. In the Altiplano, they gather in turbid, alkaline lakes with large concentrations of zooplankton. They reside in sheltered bays and on beaches along the coast, where they forage for clams and other marine amphipods among rocks and kelp beds  Behavior  = Social behavior = Crested ducks are non-gregarious, flocking only in areas of unusually high food supplies. Generally pairs will expel others of their own species as well as alien species from their foraging areas. For these reasons they are considered highly territorial = Breeding = Nesting birds are found almost throughout the year, depending on location within the range of crested duck. In the high elevations of the Andes, active nests can be found throughout the summer from October to April. The season is shorter in Patagonia and the Falklands, with nests found from September to January. Two broods per year are common, but three may occur as well. Nests are on the ground, close to water and usually built among grass or ferns for reduced visibility. Eggs are cream colored, and a clutch may have from five to eight eggs. The incubation period lasts about 30 days. Only the female incubates the eggs, but males play an important role in the ducklings early development. Crested Ducks are monogamous and mating pairs exhibit high levels of cooperation which allow the species to live in proximity to other species such as gulls and skuas. = Diet and foraging = Crested ducks are dabbling ducks, which means they sieve through mud, silt, or gravel to find macroinvertebrates. Their diet, which is highly dependent on habitat, ranges from zooplankton, clams, kelp, and other macroinvertebrates.  Status and conservation  Crested duck is one of the most common duck species in the Tierra del Fuego and has been evaluated as Least Concern References External links * Patagonian Crested Duck.

It is the second largest city in the Moquegua Region and capital of the Ilo Province. History Before the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, the area was populated by the people of the Chiribaya culture. The Conquistadores were given land grants by Charles V and brought olives to this area. Olive agriculture was the main crop and source of work until the early 20th century. A small settlement, Pacocha, was established by the seashore where the Osmore River (Rio Osmore) flows into the Pacific Ocean. High tides in the late 19th century flooded Pacocha and the population moved to Ilo's actual location, adopting its current name. Until the beginning of the 20th century most of the people lived along the banks of the Rio Osmore, whose waters flow sporadically during the summer months. Ilo was a port of call to the ships travelling from the east to the west coast of the United States via Tierra del Fuego. After the building of a pier in the 19th century, international trade flourished in the region. Italians, Chinese, Japanese and Germans settled in Ilo during this time. However, the building of the Transcontinental Rail Road and the Panama Canal caused commercial activities to decrease and mostly steamships transporting goods between Peruvian and Chilean ports remained. The Battle of Pacocha took place near Ilo. Along with its pier, a railroad was built to connect Ilo to Moquegua. The railroad was named after Calamazo (Spanish pronunciation of Kalamazoo, from the name stamped on the equipment used by the railroad). The main economic activities of the city include fishing and mining. Copper mines originally owned by the Southern Peru Copper Corporation (SPCC) have provided several jobs to the region. SPCC was established by the American Smelting and Mining Corporation in the middle of the 20th century. Many Americans and Peruvians working for SPCC live in an area of Ilo called Ciudad Nueva. The copper smelting plant and a formerly state-owned refinery located 10 kilometers far from the city have contributed to a large amount of air and water pollution in the region. Ilo's industry appeared in the Canadian documentary film The Corporation, as an example of environmental problems caused by industries. Local swimming areas include Pozo de Lisas, Monte Carlo and Puerto Ingles. Bolivia has in the past utilized Ilo as a free gate to the ocean for both recreational and trade purposes.  Transport  The Peruvian government has granted a 99-year lease to the government of landlocked Bolivia to develop a port facility, in effect allowing Bolivia to claim to be a \\"Pacific Ocean nation\\". Bolivia lost an earlier claim to a portion of Pacific coast after going to war with Chile in the 19th century. A new railway through Bolivia to Brazil is also proposed.  Climate  Temperatures in Ilo range between 18 and 28 degrees Celsius year round. Rain is almost non-existent, as Ilo is located north of the Atacama Desert, one of the driest coastal deserts in the world. Pacific Ocean terminal of the Interoceanic Highway Ilo is the southernmost of the three ports which comprise the Peruvian termini of the Interoceanic Highway which is being constructed to link the state of Acre, in the Amazon Basin in Brazil, across the Andes to the Pacific Ocean.

Population: 221,085 (2010 Census results); It is called Stary Oskol (Old Oskol) to distinguish it from Novy Oskol (New Oskol) 60 km south. Both are on the Oskol River. History It was near the Muravsky Trail used by Crimeans and Nogais to raid Muscovy. In 1571 a fort was built nearby. It was abandoned after 15 years, but the area was still patrolled. In 1593Charter of Starooskolsky Urban Okrug Oskol was refounded as a fortress. In 1617 it was burned by the Poles. The surrounding area was frequently raided by the Tatars. In 1655 it was renamed Stary Oskol to distinguish it from the new fort at Novy Oskol. Later it was affected by the Russian Civil War in 1919, as well as by World War II, where it was captured by Hungarian troops. After World War II, industry developed in the city and its population started to grow. Etymology Accurately confirmed information about the meaning of the word Oskol does not exist today, but there are many hypotheses and assumptions. At present, two hypotheses are widespread. Candidate of Historical Sciences, Anatoly Pavlovich Nikulov believes that the word ‚ÄúOskol‚Äù is of Turkic origin, since the lands of modern Stary Oskol in the early Middle Ages were part of the Khazar Kaganate, being in constant proximity to the lands inhabited by ancient Slavic tribes. At the same time it was proved that the settlements appeared in the V century AD. er and the main occupation of the population was the mining of iron ores and the smelting of metal. Then these lands in the 9th ‚Äî 10th centuries became part of Kievan Rus and remained frontier for two states, then the so-called ‚ÄúWild Field‚Äù. According to the second, the word \\"Oskol\\" can be divided into two: \\"Os\\" and \\"Kol\\". The first \\"Os\\" means Rus, the Russians, since it is known that in the 7th-8th centuries in Byzantium the people living in the northern Black Sea region were called the people of Ros and the Arabs took this word to their arsenal. But in the Turkic languages there is no clear pronunciation of the sound ‚ÄúR‚Äù, and it is replaced by a softening of the next sound, so instead of a clear ‚ÄúRos‚Äù there was a softened ‚ÄúOs‚Äù. The word ‚ÄúKol‚Äù in Turkic languages means ‚Äúpond‚Äù, ‚Äúlake‚Äù or ‚Äúriver‚Äù. In it is assumed that the word \\"oskol\\" is of Slavic origin and means splitting, crushing that is a technological procedure for grinding iron ore before smelting in a furnace ... This explanation fits well with the proximity to the ancient city of Oskol (now Stary Oskol) of a large iron deposit. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, Stary Oskol serves as the administrative center of Starooskolsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated of Microsoft separately as the town of oblast significance of Stary Oskol‚Äîan administrative unit with a status equal to that of the districts.Law #248 As a municipal division, the territories of the city of oblast significance of Stary Oskol and of Starooskolsky District are incorporated as Starooskolsky Urban Okrug.Law #159 Economy Stary Oskol is an important center of iron ore mining, situated at the border of the Kursk Magnetic Anomaly, one of the largest deposits of iron ore worldwide.

Civilization has a long history throughout Asia and it probably involved politics right from the start although some of the earliest discernible political structures arose in Mesopotamia with the advent of writing offering details of these politics. A large and well organized civil service the like of which arose in China is also a necessary adjunct to politics. Much of the political climate in Asia today is affected by colonialism and imperialism of the past with some states retaining close links with their former colonial governors while others involved in bitter independence struggles the consequences of which continue to be felt. The situation today is still mixed, with hostilities in parts of Asia such as the continuing tensions over South China sea, Kashmir, Taiwan, Tibet, North Korea as well as economic competitiveness between the People's Republic of China and India.

At university, Telushkin was an active leader of the Student Struggle for Soviet Jewry. As part of his position, Telushkin visited the Soviet Union, where he met with dissidents such as Andrei Sakharov. He was eventually listed by the KGB as an anti- Russian agent. An Orthodox rabbi by training, Telushkin serves as a spiritual leader of the Los Angeles Synagogue for the Performing Arts, founded in 1972 by Rabbi Jerome Cutler.

Her film roles include Tina Tech in Flashdance (1983), Jackie in Staying Alive (1983), Penny in Dirty Dancing (1987) and Runaway as Thompson.  Career  Born in Nashville, Tennessee, Rhodes began her show-business career working at Opryland USA as a singer and dancer while attending Glencliff High School during the 1970s. Raised in a Baptist family, Rhodes tried to maintain a clean-cut image in her acting roles and in the media, turning down scripts that required nudity and refusing offers to pose for pictorials in Playboy magazine. Sylvester Stallone, the director of Staying Alive, reinforced these facts by stating that Rhodes \\"would sooner quit the business before doing anything to embarrass her parents.\\" Rhodes played a small role in the fantasy musical Xanadu (1980). In 1982 she appeared in a video production called The Tubes Video directed by Russell Mulcahy and choreographed by Kenny Ortega. This 52-minute long form music video featured Rhodes as one of three backup dancers for the San Francisco-based rock band The Tubes and includes hits such as \\"Talk to You Later\\", \\"Sushi Girl\\", \\"Sports Fans\\" and \\"Mondo Bondage\\". Her next role was as Tina Tech in the musical film Flashdance. After Flashdance, Rhodes was cast opposite John Travolta in Sylvester Stallone's 1983 film Staying Alive, a sequel to the 1977 hit film Saturday Night Fever. Rhodes' character, Jackie, was an ensemble dancer, bar band singer, and sometime love interest of Travolta's character, Tony Manero. While poorly reviewed, the film was commercially successful. Rhodes garnered her first non-dance related role in Michael Crichton's 1984 science fiction thriller Runaway with Tom Selleck, Kirstie Alley and Gene Simmons. Her most notable role was as dance instructor Penny Johnson in the hit 1987 motion picture Dirty Dancing with Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze. Rhodes' final motion picture role was the character of Vickie Phillips, playing opposite Jameson Parker, in the sleeper action-adventure movie Curse of the Crystal Eye. Rhodes also appeared as a dancer in a number of music videos, including \\"Rosanna\\" by the band Toto, \\"The Woman in You\\" by the Bee Gees, and \\"Don't Mean Nothing\\" by Richard Marx. She was a dancer for the glam rock band The Tubes when they toured in the early 1980s. Rhodes later joined the pop group Animotion, replacing their lead singer Astrid Plane, for the recording of their third album of original material. Though the group's single \\"Room to Move\\" (from the film My Stepmother Is an Alien) rose to 9 on the Billboard charts, the album failed to match the group's earlier success, peaking at only No. 110 on the pop charts; shortly thereafter, the group disbanded. In 2002, Rhodes co-wrote the smooth jazz track \\"Perfect Day\\" with then-husband Richard Marx for December, trumpeter Chris Botti's holiday album.  Personal life  Rhodes was married to singer-songwriter Richard Marx. They met in 1983 while Marx was working on the motion picture soundtrack for Staying Alive. Rhodes, seven years his senior, thought Marx was much too young for her to date at the time. Marx and Rhodes did not start their relationship until two years later, when they were reacquainted at a party. After a four-year courtship, the couple married on January 8, 1989. After marrying Marx and giving birth to three boys, Rhodes retired from her performing career to raise her family. In an Us Weekly article dated April 4, 2014, Marx's representative confirmed that he and Rhodes were divorcing after 25 years of marriage.

He was the son of √ç√±igo Arista, the first king of Pamplona. Educated in Cordoba, he was a successful military leader who led the military campaigns of the kingdom during the last years of his father's life.  Biography  Educated in C√≥rdoba, as a guest at the court of the Emir of C√≥rdoba, Garc√≠a was the son of √ç√±igo Arista, the first king of a Basque dynasty ruling in Pamplona up to the late 9th century. When his father was stricken by paralysis in 842, he became regent of the kingdom (or perhaps co- regent with his uncle Fort√∫n √ç√±iguez). He and his kinsman M≈´sƒÅ ibn M≈´sƒÅ ibn Fort√∫n of the Banu Qasi rebelled against the Cordoban emir in 843. This rebellion was put down by Emir Abd ar-Rahman II, who attacked the Kingdom of Pamplona, defeating Garc√≠a badly and killing Fort√∫n. At his father's death in 851/2 (237 A.H.), he succeeded to the crown of Pamplona. Following the death of √ç√±igo Arista, the Banu Qasi leader M≈´sƒÅ ibn M≈´sƒÅ pursued a policy of closer allegiance with Muhammad I of C√≥rdoba, leaving Garc√≠a to look to Christian Asturias for an ally. In 859, the Vikings captured King Garcia I√±iguez, probably far removed from his Basque kingdom of Navarre, somewhere in the Andalusian heartland, and extorted a hefty ransom, rising to around 70,000 gold dinars. Later the same year, M≈´sƒÅ ibn M≈´sƒÅ attacked the Pamplonese city of Albelda. Garc√≠a and his new friend Ordo√±o I of Asturias together dealt M≈´sƒÅ a crushing blow, killing, it is said, 10,000 of his magnates in the Battle of Albelda. This, in turn, provoked a raid by Mohammed I of C√≥rdoba in response and the next year, 860, saw Garc√≠a's son and heir Fort√∫n captured and imprisoned by Mohammed I of C√≥rdoba. He languished in C√≥rdoba for the next 20 years. In 870, Garc√≠a formed an alliance with the Muslim rebel Amr≈´s ibn Umar ibn Amr≈´s, who had killed Garcia's nephew M≈´sƒÅ ibn Galindo of Huesca, and the next year was apparently in a new alliance with the sons of M≈´sƒÅ ibn M≈´sƒÅ, now in rebellion against C√≥rdoba. Garc√≠a's death has been subject to scholarly dispute, a result of a paucity of records from the last years of his reign. The lack of subsequent mention of him after 870 led to the suggestion that he died in that year, and as his heir was in the hands of his enemies, it was argued that Garc√≠a Jim√©nez then governed the kingdom as regent. Garc√≠a's son, Fort√∫n Garc√©s, is then made to succeed upon his release in 880. There is, however, no evidence for such a regency, and Sanch√©z Albornoz has cited evidence that Garc√≠a was still living at the time of his son's return. Thus it is likely that Balparda was reporting an accurate tradition when he suggested Garc√≠a and ally Umar ibn Hafsun fought a battle at Aibar, nor far from present-day Lumbier, against the troops of the Emir of C√≥rdoba in 882, Garc√≠a dying there (although the age provided him, 84 years, is clearly exaggerated).  Marriage and descendants  The identity of Garc√≠a's wife or wives is poorly documented, and has been subject to much speculation. An undated confirmation of an earlier lost charter refers to King Garc√≠a and Queen Urraca Mayor, and this is thought by some to refer to Garc√≠a √ç√±iguez and an otherwise unknown wife, Urraca. Based on her name alone and the fact that one of his sons' names was Fort√∫n, a common name among the Banu Qasi dynasty, it has been argued that Urraca could have been a granddaughter of Musa ibn Musa ibn Qasi, the leader of the Banu Qasi clan. Other historians have suggested alternative parentage, or suggested the document does not refer to Garc√≠a √ç√±iguez at all but instead to Garc√≠a S√°nchez II of Pamplona and his mother Queen Urraca Fern√°ndez. A second possible wife is infanta Leodegundia, daughter of Ordo√±o I of Asturias. She is known to have married a ruler of Pamplona not named in the primary source, and Garc√≠a √ç√±iguez is one of those speculated to have been this prince. * Fort√∫n Garc√©s, King of Pamplona from 870 until 905 and married to Auria. * Onneca Garc√©s, married to Aznar Gal√≠ndez II, Count of Aragon. * Sancho Garc√©s, father of Aznar S√°nchez de Larraun ‚Äî the second husband of his cousin Onneca Fort√∫nez ‚Äî and probably of Velazquita, who married Mutarrif ibn Musa, of the Banu Qasi. He may also have been the father of Jimena, who married King Alfonso III of Asturias between 26 May and 20 December 873, both appearing together for first time in 874 making a donation to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela. Her name and the status of her husband as the premier monarch in Christian Iberia suggests that she could have come from nothing short of the highest levels of Pamplona society, though some have instead derived her from the Jimenez dynasty.

Statue of San Juan Bautista, erected 1935 Guarico is the fourth largest state in the country in terms of area, but not in population, as it has a low population density. San Juan de Los Morros used to be part of Aragua state, but it was exchanged during the 1930s to Guarico state, and the town was later elevated to become capital of the state, replacing the former capital Ortiz. Among the major features of the city are the Statue of San Juan Bautista (John the Baptist) which is 19.8 meters (62,3 ft) high, the Bandera Monument, Bolivar Plaza, the 'Los Morros de San Juan' monument, the historic place and monument known as \\"La Puerta\\" (The Gate), and the hot springs. The medicinal sulfuric content of the springs makes them a significant tourist attraction. San Juan de Los Morros has a climate of 24 to 32 degrees Celsius and is dominated by the surrounding mountains, which contrasts with the plains of the rest of the state.

It is related to militarism, which is an ideology that reflects the level of militarization of a state, and which is associated with the glorification of the military, armed forces and weapons and of military power, including through symbolic displays (e.g., parades of tanks and soldiers) and actual use of force, such as through warfare. The process of militarization involves many interrelated aspects that encompass many levels of society. Geopolitical The perceived level of threat influences what potential for violence or warfare the state must achieve to assure itself an acceptable level of security. When the perceived level of threat is low, as with Canada, a country may have a relatively small military and level of armament. However, in Israel, the threat of attack from neighbouring countries means that the armed forces and defense have a high profile and are given significant funding and personnel. This threat may involve the: :*Balance of power of neighboring states (pre-World War I Europe, for example.) :*Terrorism, rogue states, weapons of mass destruction and state terror :*Threats to state-interests, such as political control of an oil-rich region, or preventing the spread of a conflicting ideology (e.g., the U.S.'s use of CIA interventions to undermine various communist governments) Political Militaristic ideas are referred to within civilian contexts. The War on Poverty declared by President Lyndon B. Johnson, and the War on drugs declared by President Richard Nixon, are rhetorical wars. They are not declared against a concrete, military enemy which can be defeated, but are symbolic of the amount of effort, sacrifice, and dedication which needs to be applied to the issue. They may also be a means of consolidating executive power, because war implies emergency powers for the executive branch which are normally reserved for the legislature. As well, politicians have invoked militaristic ideas with rhetorical wars on other social issues. Some governments draw on militaristic imagery when they appoint \\"task forces\\" of bureaucrats to address pressing political or social issues. Economic *military-industrial complex *metropolitan-military complex (Lotchin, 2002, Ch. 1) Militarization has been used as a strategy for boosting a state's economy, by creating jobs and increasing industrial production. This was part of Adolf Hitler's plan to revive the German economy after the devastation it suffered after the First World War. Social Increasingly, Christian evangelical prayer has taken on militaristic forms and language. Spiritual warfare is a form of prayer spoken in militarized discourse. Its adherents, sometimes referring to themselves as \\"prayer warriors\\", wage \\"spiritual battle\\" on the \\"prayer battlefield.\\" Spiritual warfare is the latest iteration in a long-standing partnership between religious organization and militarization, two spheres that are rarely considered together, although aggressive forms of prayer have long been used to further the aims of expanding Christian influence through a variety of conversion tactics. These tactics have begun being articulated in militaristic imagery, using terms such as \\"enlist, rally, advance and blitz\\". Major moments of increased political militarization have occurred concurrently with the growth of prominence of militaristic imagery in many evangelical communities, such as the evangelical engagement in a militarized project of aggressive missionary expansion conducted against the backdrop of the Vietnam War in the 1970s. =Gender= The military also has a role in defining gender identities. War-movies (i.e. Rambo) reflect the cultural identities of masculinity with the warrior. (See Gibson, 1994.) Representations of Vietnam in popular culture display the male body as a weapon of war and contribute to ideals of masculinity in American culture. Military prowess has been crucial to understandings of contemporary masculinity in European and American culture. During World War I soldiers who experienced shell-shock were seen as failures of masculinity, unable to withstand war as the ultimate task of manliness. The maintenance of military life relies on the ideas about men and manliness as well as ideas about women and femininity, included notions of the fallen women and patriotic motherhood. Women have been mobilized during times of war to perform tasks seen as incompatible with men's roles in combat, including cooking, laundry, and nursing. Women have also been seen as necessary for servicing male soldiers' sexual needs through prostitution. For example, during the Vietnam War, Vietnamese women who worked as prostitutes were allowed on US bases as local national Jabaits. =Civil-military relations= The role and image of the military within a society is another aspect of militarization. At differing times and places in history, soldiers have been viewed as respectable, honoured individuals (for example, this was the view of Allied soldiers who liberated Nazi-occupied Netherlands in WW II, or the view of Americans and Canadians who place support our troops car magnets on their vehicles during the war on terror) or even as heroes (for example, the Finnish people's view of the Finnish sniper nicknamed \\"White Death\\", who killed many Russian invaders); as \\"baby killers\\" by U.S. anti-war activists during and after the Vietnam war; or as war criminals (the Nazi leaders and SS units responsible for the Holocaust). Structural organization is another process of militarization. Before World War II, the United States experienced a post-war reduction of forces after major conflicts, reflecting American suspicion of large standing armies. After World War II, not only was the army maintained, but the National Security Act of 1947 restructured both civilian and military leadership structures, establishing the Department of Defense and the National Security Council. The Act also created permanent intelligence structures (the CIA et al.) within the United States government for the first time, reflecting the civilian government's perception of a need for previously military based intelligence to be incorporated into the structure of the civilian state. How citizenship is tied to military service plays an important role in establishing civil-military relations. Countries with volunteer-based military service versus universal conscription have a different mindset. In some countries, men must have served with the military to be considered a citizen. Compare historical Prussia, where every male was required to serve, and service was a requirement of citizenship, to post-Vietnam America's all- volunteer army. In 2016 in Israel, military service is mandatory. This creates a society where almost all people have served in the armed forces. See also Frevert, 2004, Ch. 1.4, 1.5. Race Racial interactions between society and the military: * During imperial Germany, military service was a requirement of citizenship, but Jews and other foreigners were not allowed to serve in the military. (Frevert, 2004, pp. 65‚Äì9) * During Nazi Germany's Holocaust, SS units committed war crimes and crimes against humanity on a massive scale, including executing millions of civilians. * In the United States, beyond the Civil War, military service was a way for blacks to serve the country, and later appeal for equal citizenship during World War II. The military was one of the first national institutions to be integrated. In 1948, President Harry S. Truman issued Executive Order 9981 establishing equality within the armed services. The military was also a tool of integration. In 1957, President Dwight Eisenhower sent troops to Little Rock, AR to desegregate a school after the Brown v. Board Supreme Court decision in 1954. (See also MacGregor, 1985.) * Improved race relations was seen as a national security issue during the Cold War. Communist propaganda cited American racism as a major flaw, and America wanted to improve its image to third-world countries which might be susceptible to Communism. Eleanor Roosevelt said \\"civil rights [is] an international question. . . [that] may decide whether Democracy or Communism wins out in the world.\\" (Sherry, 1995, p. 146) and this sort of false dichotomy was continued further throughout the McCarthy era and the Cold War in general. Class The military also serves as a means of social restructuring. Lower classes could gain status and mobility within the military, at least after lev√©e en masse after the French Revolution. Also, the officer corps became open to the middle class, although it was once reserved only for nobility. In Britain, becoming a military officer was an expectation for 'second sons' who were to gain no inheritance; the role of officer was assumed to maintain their noble class. In the United States, military service has been/is advertised as a means for lower-class people to receive training and experience that they would not normally receive, propelling them to higher incomes and higher positions in society. Joining the military has enabled many people from lower socioeconomic demographics to receive college education and training. As well, a number of positions in the military involve transferable skills that can be used in the regular labor market after an individual is discharged (e.g., pilot, air traffic controller, mechanic). Police Police SWAT team members, some armed with assault rifles, prepare for an exercise. The militarization of police involves the use of military equipment and tactics by law enforcement officers. This includes the use of armored personnel carriers, assault rifles, submachine guns, flashbang grenades,The flash from a flashbang grenade detonation momentarily activates all photoreceptor cells in the eye, making vision impossible for approximately five seconds, until the eye restores itself to its normal, unstimulated state. The loud blast is meant to cause temporary loss of hearing, and also disturbs the fluid in the ear, causing loss of balance. The concussive blast of the detonation can still injure, and the heat created can ignite flammable materials. grenade launchers,Texas Rangers, Department of Public Safety, Branch Davidian Evidence, Investigative Report No. 1, September 1999; Investigative Report No. 2, January 2000 (PDFs available at Texas Rangers website). The Rangers found that the FBI used grenade launchers to fire two 40 mm M651 grenades. The Army considers the M651 a pyrotechnic device and that it is known to cause fires. The Army Tech Manual for the M651 warns that it can penetrate 3/4\\" plywood at 200 meters and \\"projectile may explode upon target impact.\\" During inventory of the Waco evidence the Texas Rangers also found flashbang grenades. sniper rifles, Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) teams. The militarization of law enforcement is also associated with intelligence agency-style information gathering aimed at the public and political activists, and a more aggressive style of law enforcement. Criminal justice professor Peter Kraska has defined militarization of law enforcement as \\"the process whereby civilian police increasingly draw from, and pattern themselves around, the tenets of militarism and the military model.\\" Observers have noted the militarizing of the policing of protests. Since the 1970s, riot police have fired at protesters using guns with rubber bullets or plastic bullets.http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/plastic+bullet \\"A solid PVC cylinder, 10 cm long and 38 mm in diameter, fired by police or military forces to regain control in riots.\\" Tear gas, which was developed for riot control in 1919, is widely used against protesters in the 2000s. The use of tear gas in warfare is prohibited by various international treatiese.g. the Geneva Protocol of 1925: 'Prohibited the use of \\"asphyxiating gas, or any other kind of gas, liquids, substances or similar materials\\"' that most states have signed; however, its law enforcement or military use for domestic or non- combat situations is permitted. Concerns about the militarization of police have been raised by both ends of the political spectrum in the United States, with both the right-of-center/libertarian Cato Institute and the left-of- center American Civil Liberties Union voicing criticisms of the practice. The Fraternal Order of Police has spoken out in favor of equipping law enforcement officers with military equipment, on the grounds that it increases the officers' safety and enables them to protect civilians.

Early years Regan was the oldest of five children of an Irish immigrant couple who lived in Brooklyn, New York. When he was 13 years old, Regan \\"had to quit school and drive a team of horses in Brooklyn.\\" Before venturing into a career in entertainment, he went on to work as a boatman, a court clerk, a clerk for an oil company, and a policeman. Career Regan worked as a detective on the NYPD, before his singing was overheard by a radio producer at a party. He was signed by CBS radio \\"as a result of his singing -- gratis -- at a charity benefit.\\" He became known as \\"The Romantic Singer of Romantic Songs\\" when he performed with Guy Lombardo and his orchestra on the Burns and Allen radio program. This earned him the nickname \\"The Singing Cop\\". Regan went on to headline musical comedies at both Republic and Monogram studios. His film debut was in The Key. William Gilmore, in a review of the film Laughing Irish Eyes in the Brooklyn Eagle, described Regan as having \\"astonishing good looks and an extraordinarily pleasing tenor voice.\\" He performed the National Anthem at the 1949 inauguration of President Harry S Truman. Later years Regan retired in the mid-1950s. After retiring, Regan spent his time in his Palm Springs and Santa Barbara houses. Regan dabbled in politics, endorsing Ronald Reagan for governor of California in 1966 against incumbent Pat Brown. Bribery conviction In 1972, he became involved with a developer named Halimi, who had created successful developments at Lake Tahoe and elsewhere. Halimi had purchased the option to develop a large coastal property on More Mesa in Santa Barbara, California, which required a permit from Santa Barbara County. He was aware that three of the five supervisors were in favor, but he wanted to find a fourth vote for Halimi to avoid an appeal. He approached Frank Frost in December 1972. Frost had just been elected to the Board of Supervisors and would take office in January. Frost perceived that an attempt at bribery was being arranged and reported his suspicions to the county district attorney and sheriff. A \\"sting\\" was planned and Regan passed $1000 to a friend of Frost's who posed as a go- between. Testimony at Regan's trial established that he had promised an additional $5000 for Frost's vote. Regan was arrested, convicted, and sentenced to two years in prison. He was released after one year. Upon his release, Regan returned to Santa Barbara.

Description In this organic reaction, a tertiary alcohol is cleaved in an organic oxidation by a peroxyacid to a ketone. The acid used is often p-nitroperoxybenzoic acid because the p-nitrobenzoic acid anion is a good leaving group. center The reaction mechanism has similarities with the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation where the intermediate hydroxyperacid is called a Criegee intermediate. The per-acid forms a per-ester with the alcohol group. One alkyl substituent migrates from carbon to the adjacent oxygen atom, replacing the carboxylic acid leaving behind a carbocation. A hydrolysis step forms the ketone together with the alcohol. The order of migrationary aptitude is a tert-butyl as the best substituent followed by isopropyl then ethyl and then the methyl group. From this it is inferred that the migrating group carries a partial positive charge in the transition state leading to the carbocation. The consecutive Criegee Rearrangement is carried out in an acidic environment and an ester forms from the carbocation. This opens the way to multiple O-insertion reactions, eventually leading to the orthoester.  References  * Criegee, R., Chem. Ber. 1944, 77, 722 * Criegee, R.; Kaspar, R., Ann.

She went on to rule as high priestess, and has been shown in several artefacts from the period. Biography She was a Kushite princess, the daughter of Pharaoh Kashta and Queen Pebatjma. She is likely to have been the sister of pharaohs Shabaka and Piye. Kashta arranged to have Amenirdis I adopted by the Divine Adoratrice of Amun, Shepenupet I, at Thebes as her successor. This shows that Kashta already controlled Upper Egypt prior to the reign of Piye, his successor. She ruled as high priestess approximately between 714 and 700 BCE, under the reigns of Shabaka and Shabataka, and she adopted Piye's daughter Shepenupet II as her successor. She also held the priestly titles of Divine Adoratrice of Amun and God's Hand. Upon her death, she was buried in a tomb in the grounds of Medinet Habu. She is depicted in the Osiris-Hekadjet (\\"Osiris, Ruler of Eternity\\") temple in the Karnak temple complex, and in Wadi Gasus, along with Shepenupet I. She is mentioned on two offering tables, five statues, a stela and several small objects including scarabs. A statue of Amenirdis I carved from granitoid and decorated in gold leaf is held by the Nubian Museum in Aswan, Upper Egypt.

It was built in 1844 as an entertainment venue for the restaurant owner Joseph Kroll. During its eventful history it was redeveloped as an opera house in 1851 and was used by various owners and directors for opera, operetta and drama. It was later operated by the Prussian state opera and drama companies and served as the assembly hall of the German Reichstag parliament from 1933 until 1942. On 19 July 1940, the opera house was used to host the 1940 Field Marshal Ceremony. Severely damaged by bombing and the Battle of Berlin in World War II, it was finally demolished in 1951. History =1842‚Äì1848: Early years= The Kroll story began in the Silesian capital Breslau, where the entrepreneur Joseph Kroll (1797‚Äì1848) had opened the \\"Kroll Winter Garden\\" in 1837. The Breslau authorities chose this reputable establishment to entertain the new Prussian King Frederick William IV when he visited the city in 1841. The King was impressed by the splendid, flower-decorated rooms and suggested that something similar should be initiated in Berlin to become the social hub for the nobility in the Prussian residence. 1879 map of the K√∂nigsplatz, Krolloper on the left, projected site of the new Reichstag on the right After a consultation with his garden director, Peter Joseph Lenn√© and other members of the government, the king presented an order from the cabinet dated 19 August 1842, which specified the building site on the west side of the parade ground in the Gro√üer Tiergarten park, and laid out the conditions: Kroll was able to use the property without charge, but he would have to return the land and demolish any structures he had built if the project failed. The parade ground, which had stood since 1730, was outside of the city just to the north west of the Brandenburg Gate. It had long degenerated into a sandy field, and the Berliners therefore derisively called it the \\"Sahara\\". Every step on the sandy ground would kick up a cloud of dust on the square. When it rained, the soil would turn into a mass of dirty mud. Yet Kroll took solace in the fact that the greenery of the Tiergarten park lay just beyond the property. The plans for the new building came from the court architect Friedrich Ludwig Persius, which was a good indicator of the significance that the project had for Frederick William IV, co-working with Carl Ferdinand Langhans and Eduard Knoblauch. After a construction period of only ten months, Kroll's enterprise opened on 15 February 1844. Forty waiters were to serve up to five thousand guests in the three halls (the main hall, also referred to as the King's Hall, and two smaller halls), thirteen boxes for at least thirteen people each, and fourteen large rooms (for smaller parties). Sixty musicians provided entertainment. The \\"Tunnel\\" was a special attraction and praised as a novelty for Berlin ‚Äì a hall where one could smoke! A technical innovation was the newly implemented gas lighting, which \\"consisted of 400 flames\\". During the first year Kroll had satisfactory results. The main attractions were the large exhibitions, concerts and balls, which took place around lavishly constructed stage sets, attracting even the \\"Waltz King\\" Johann Strauss Jr. and his orchestra, who guested at Kroll's in 1845. Yet despite its uniqueness in Germany, as noted by the critics, the enterprise became increasingly difficult to sustain. On 15 April 1848, on his deathbed, Kroll regretted that his King had once had breakfast with him.\\"1 =1848‚Äì1894: Between success and bankruptcy= Joseph Kroll's successor was his eldest daughter, Auguste. The \\"National People's Garden\\" was opened as soon as May 1848 as part of an expansion. Great attractions were offered first in the garden and later in the great hall, such as performances with wild animals by their tamers and an extensive trade fair in 1849. In 1850 Auguste Kroll established a permanent summer theatre with open-air performances of operas and other events. Here, among others, Auguste's prot√©g√© Albert Lortzing directed his operas Undine, Der Waffenschmied (The Armourer) and Zar und Zimmermann. Poster in celebration of the 25 years jubilee, 1869 The operation of the new Theatre and Opera Company was suddenly disrupted on 1 February 1851, when the curtains were accidentally set on fire while lamps were being lit. But Auguste Kroll didn't let that stop her; she encashed the fire insurance sum and on 24 February 1852, the theatre already reopened in a completely new building. About a year later, Auguste married her capellmeister, the Hungarian violinist, conductor and businessman Jakob Engel. They successfully expanded the \\"Kroll Opera Pool\\" and brought many new comic operas to the stage, but also enacted lengthy music dramas by Richard Wagner. But the couple could not prevent the business from closing its doors on 1 April 1855. Despite all efforts, the earnings were far beneath the costs of operation. One of the creditors, the entrepreneur Heinrich Bergmann, took over the insolvent operation and brought in such luminaries as Jacques Offenbach for one of his first guest appearances in Berlin. In 1862 however, \\"Kroll\\" was again forced into auction, which enabled Jakob Engel to buy it back. Although the company was still weighed down by debt, Engel was beaming with optimism, and attempted to bring the Berliners back into his establishment in droves with a diverse program ‚Äì albeit only with moderate success. The situation worsened in 1869, when the implementation of economic freedom in Prussia led to a boom of newly established amusement parks all over Berlin. Engel's attempts to sell failed because of the Prussian tax authority and the heavy mortgage that weighed down the business. In addition, the former parade ground had been refurbished and named K√∂nigsplatz (King's Square\\") by 18 December 1864, the gardens were redone, and later plans were made for a series of monuments to honour the Prussian victories from 1864-71. After the Franco-Prussian War the Victory Column was solemnly unveiled in the middle of the square on 2 September 1873, while at the same time a long discussion took place at the German Reichstag diet about whether to tear down the Kroll establishment and build a new parliamentary building in its place. Only in 1876 did these proposals, which were so detrimental to any future investments, get tossed out, so that Jakob Engel was able to proceed with the modernization and improvement of his establishment. In 1885 ‚Äì the first time in Berlin ‚Äì the old gas lighting was therefore replaced by the \\"Edison system\\" of electric lighting. Two years later, Engel was also able to secure a contract extension for another forty years, but he ran out of time to implement his plans. He died unexpectedly from a stroke on 28 June 1888. His son tried to continue his work, but the \\"lack of interest from the Berlin public\\" for the Kroll stage's artistic presentation forced him to sell in 1894.\\"Reichhardt Hans J., (October 1988). Bei Kroll 1844 BIS 1957, Landesarchiv Berlin, KalekreuthstraBe 1-2, Berlin 30, . Page ? =1895‚Äì1931: State opera= Shortly afterwards the building was acquired by the Prussian K√∂nigliche Schauspiele royal theatre company and Kroll's establishment was rebuilt as the Neues K√∂nigliches Operntheater, a second state opera house (the other being the Staatsoper Unter den Linden). Works by young composers like Igor Stravinsky and Gustav Mahler were performed here, but also popular concerts given by Enrico Caruso and operettas like Die Fledermaus. As the decent opera house Unter den Linden did not match with Emperor Wilhelm's attitudes, plans for a new luxuriant opera hall at the site of the Krolloper were developed and demolition had already started in 1914, when the outbreak of World War I halted the construction works. Opera house in 1930 After the war the authorities of the Free State of Prussia were unable to finance the reconstruction, which was finally carried out by the Volksb√ºhne theatre company according to the plans of a Volksoper (\\"People's Opera\\") designed by Oskar Kaufmann. Nevertheless it appeared that the Volksb√ºhne company also had overextended itself and the completion of the refurbishment had to be secured by public funds. On 1 January 1924 the building was re-opened again as the Oper am K√∂nigsplatz, the second home of the Berlin State Opera, with Erich Kleiber conducting Wagner's Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg. With the square, the house was renamed Staatsoper am Platz der Republik in 1926. To Berliners it remained known as the Krolloper. In 1927 the Kroll Opera was again detached from the Staatsoper Unter den Linder as a separate opera company with Otto Klemperer as its resident conductor, re-opened on 19 November with Beethoven's Fidelio. During Klemperer's term the house saw world premi√®res as Paul Hindemith's Neues vom Tage in 1929 and Arnold Sch√∂nberg's Begleitmusik zu einer Lichtspielszene in 1930. He worked with renowned conductors like Alexander von Zemlinsky and directors like Gustaf Gr√ºndgens, as well as Caspar Neher, L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy, Teo Otto, Oskar Schlemmer and Giorgio de Chirico as stage designers. The entire singing cast was placed in the hands of the singing pedagogue, Professor Frederick Husler. In an interview on German radio Husler talks about the special atmosphere which existed at the opera house during this period. He mentions some of the singers who were engaged at the time: \\"Jarmilla Novotna, who later went to New York to the Metropolitan Opera. Or Kaethe Haidersbach. She became very famous as Evchen in \\"Meistersinger\\" in Bayreuth. Or Maria Schult-Stormburg and Moie Vorbach, two very distinct personalities. They went to the other house Unter den Linden later. And a very impressive personality: Iso Golland, the Russian. He returned to Russia and has become a highly respected pedagogue.\\" He describes the generosity which existed among the singers: \\"Their comradeship was extraordinary. No intrigues would arise. I remember that before rehearsals for a performance of \\"Die Verkaufte Braut\\" three \\"Brides\\" were sitting in my room. Novotna, Haidersbach and Zaezilie Reich. I remember them discussing, absolutely unselfishly, who of them should sing. Haidersbach said Novotna was the original Czech. Novotna said that Haidersbach had the more suitable lyric voice, whereas she herself was a coloratura soprano. And Reich then put forward an argument (and against herself) the benefit of the whole group. Where could you find such a thing?\\" Klemperer's performances and their modern mise-en-sc√®ne were ahead of their time and raised the opposition by conservative circles. In the highly charged political atmosphere during the late days of the Weimar Republic, public pressure made the general administrator of the Prussian state theatres Heinz Tietjen realize that the administration could not afford the funding of three opera houses in Berlin. Despite Klemperer's protests, the Krolloper was finally closed on 3 July 1931 with the last performance of Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro. =1933‚Äì1951: Seat of the Reichstag and destruction= Hitler declares war on the United States in front of the Reichstag delegates on 11 December 1941 The building stood empty for nearly two years, until the Reichstag fire on 27 February 1933 severely damaged the Reichstag building vis-√†-vis. After the German federal election on 5 March 1933, the Krolloper became the seat of the Reichstag. It was chosen both because of its convenient location and for its seating capacity. On 23 March 1933, the majority of the Reichstag delegates in the Kroll Opera House disempowered themselves passing the \\"Enabling Act\\" that gave Adolf Hitler virtually unlimited authority. At this time the elected MPs of the Communist Party and several Social Democrats were already in hiding or arrested. After the election on 12 November 1933 the National Socialists occupied all seats. The main hall of the Krolloper was used for sittings of the Reichstag from 1933 to 1942. It was here on 30 January 1939, the sixth anniversary of the Machtergreifung (the appointment of Hitler as Reichskanzler), that Hitler warned: \\"If international finance Jewry in and outside Europe should again succeed in plunging the nations into a world war, then the result will not be the Bolshevization of the earth, and thus the victory of Jewry, but the annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe.\\" 88mm Flak cannon in the foreground, May 1945 The grandiose plans of Welthauptstadt Germania, prepared by Albert Speer for Hitler, included the demolition of the Kroll Opera House and its replacement by a sumptuous \\"F√ºhrer's Palace\\", which would have stood on the western side of a \\"Gro√üer Platz\\" with an area of around . The outbreak of war and Germany's eventual defeat prevented any of this from being implemented. The last session of the Reichstag was held in the Kroll Opera House on 26 April 1942, passing a decree proclaiming Hitler \\"Supreme Judge of the German People,\\" allowing him to override the judiciary and administration in all matters. In those last days the building once again was the site of several performances of the Berlin State Opera after the house Unter den Linden had been damaged by air raids. However, the Krolloper itself was devastated by a RAF Bomber Command attack on 22 November 1943. It was further damaged in the last days of World War II in Europe when forces of the Red Army stormed the Reichstag ruin. However, already in the summer of 1945 a restaurant re-opened in the gardens of Kroll's establishment, keeping up business even after the remains of the building were demolished in 1951. The Kroll-Garten inn finally closed in 1956 and one year later the last premises were cleared. Today the site is nothing but a large lawn south of the Bundeskanzleramt, since 2007 marked by a memorial plaque.

For example, if we have a set of random points on the real number line between 0 and 1, the correlation dimension will be ŒΩ = 1, while if they are distributed on say, a triangle embedded in three- dimensional space (or m-dimensional space), the correlation dimension will be ŒΩ = 2\\\\. This is what we would intuitively expect from a measure of dimension. The real utility of the correlation dimension is in determining the (possibly fractional) dimensions of fractal objects. There are other methods of measuring dimension (e.g. the Hausdorff dimension, the box-counting dimension, and the information dimension) but the correlation dimension has the advantage of being straightforwardly and quickly calculated, of being less noisy when only a small number of points is available, and is often in agreement with other calculations of dimension. For any set of N points in an m-dimensional space :\\\\vec x(i)=[x_1(i),x_2(i),\\\\ldots,x_m(i)], \\\\qquad i=1,2,\\\\ldots N then the correlation integral C(Œµ) is calculated by: :C(\\\\varepsilon)=\\\\lim_{N \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} \\\\frac{g}{N^2} where g is the total number of pairs of points which have a distance between them that is less than distance Œµ (a graphical representation of such close pairs is the recurrence plot). As the number of points tends to infinity, and the distance between them tends to zero, the correlation integral, for small values of Œµ, will take the form: :C(\\\\varepsilon) \\\\sim \\\\varepsilon^ u If the number of points is sufficiently large, and evenly distributed, a log-log graph of the correlation integral versus Œµ will yield an estimate of ŒΩ. This idea can be qualitatively understood by realizing that for higher-dimensional objects, there will be more ways for points to be close to each other, and so the number of pairs close to each other will rise more rapidly for higher dimensions. Grassberger and Procaccia introduced the technique in 1983; the article gives the results of such estimates for a number of fractal objects, as well as comparing the values to other measures of fractal dimension. The technique can be used to distinguish between (deterministic) chaotic and truly random behavior, although it may not be good at detecting deterministic behavior if the deterministic generating mechanism is very complex. As an example, in the \\"Sun in Time\\" article, the method was used to show that the number of sunspots on the sun, after accounting for the known cycles such as the daily and 11-year cycles, is very likely not random noise, but rather chaotic noise, with a low- dimensional fractal attractor.

He was best known for playing trumpet in the Sun Ra Arkestra in Chicago from 1959 to 1961, and for his involvement in the foundation of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM). Biography Cohran was born in Oxford, Mississippi, on May 8, 1927. When he was about nine, he moved with his family to Missouri. There, his father became a cook in a restaurant in Troy, while the rest of the family stayed in St. Louis. Cohran played trumpet in bands led by Jay McShann in the early 1950s, and then in a U.S. Navy band. He was introduced to the Sun Ra Arkestra by John Gilmore in 1959. He appeared on the albums Fate In A Pleasant Mood and Angels and Demons at Play among others. He played mostly trumpet and sometimes stringed instruments such as the zither. When the Arkestra moved from Chicago in 1961, Cohran declined to accompany them. In 1965 he took part in the founding of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM). He formed the Artistic Heritage Ensemble with Pete Cosey, future members of Earth, Wind and Fire's horn section and Motown percussionist \\"Master\\" Henry Gibson, among others. By this time, he was playing the harp, cornet, French horn, baritone saxophone and percussion. The group recorded the album On the Beach around 1967. Early in his career, he invented an instrument he called the Frankiphone or the Space Harp, which is actually an electrified mbira or kalimba; he played it on some of Sun Ra's early albums. This instrument inspired Maurice White to use an electrified Kalimba in performance with Earth, Wind and Fire. Cohran said that he taught White and his brothers music in their youth, much as The Wailers were tutored by Joe Higgs. On the Beach features the Frankiphone on the title track, as well as a piece called \\"New Frankiphone Blues\\". Several of Cohran's sons make up eight of the nine members of the Hypnotic Brass Ensemble, which consists of four trumpets, two trombones, one euphonium, a sousaphone and drums. With Hypnotic Brass Ensemble he recorded an album which had a simple idea: \\"my music and their band\\". Cohran taught voice and music to inner city youth and adults at Northeastern Illinois University's Center for Inner City Studies. He died in Chicago on June 28, 2017 at the age of 90.

The Ramayana describes Mandodari as beautiful, pious, and righteous. She is extolled as one of the Panchakanya (\\"five virgins\\"), the recital of whose names is believed to dispel sin. Mandodari was the daughter of Mayasura, the King of the Asuras (demons), and the apsara (celestial nymphs) Hema. Mandodari bears threesons: Meghanada (Indrajit), Atikaya, and Akshayakumara. According to some Ramayana adaptations, Mandodari is also the mother of Rama's wife Sita, who is infamously kidnapped by Ravana. Despite her husband's faults, Mandodari loves him and advises him to follow the path of righteousness. Mandodari repeatedly advises Ravana to return Sita to Rama, but her advice falls on deaf ears. Her love and loyalty to Ravana are praised in the Ramayana. In a version of Ramayana, Hanuman tricks her into disclosing the location of a magical arrow which Rama uses to kill Ravana. Different versions of the Ramayana record her ill-treatment at the hands of Rama's monkey generals. Some versions say they disturb a sacrifice by Ravana, and some that they destroy her chastity, which was the last protection for Ravana's life. Many versions of Ramayana state that after Ravana's death, Vibhishana‚ÄîRavana's younger brother who joins forces with Rama and is responsible for Ravana's death‚Äîmarries Mandodari on the advice of Rama. Birth and early life The Uttara Kanda of the Ramayana mentions that Mayasura visited Svarga (heaven), where the apsara Hema was given to him by the gods. They had two sons, Mayavi and Dundubhi, and a daughter, Mandodari. Later, Hema returned to heaven; Mandodari and her siblings were left with their father. =Other versions= The Telugu text Uttara Ramayana mentions that Mayasura is married to the apsara Hema. They have two sons, Mayavi and Dundubhi, but long for a daughter, so they start performing penances to seek the favour of the god Shiva. Meanwhile, an apsara named Madhura arrives at Mount Kailash, the abode of Shiva, to pay her respects. In absence of his wife Parvati, Madhura makes love with the god. When Parvati returns, she finds traces of ashes from her husband‚Äôs body on the breasts of Madhura. Agitated, Parvati curses Madhura and sends her to live in a well as a frog for twelve years. Shiva told Madhura that she will become a beautiful woman and be married to a great valorous man. After twelve years, Madhura becomes a beautiful maiden again and cries out loudly from the well. Mayasura and Hema, who are performing penance nearby, answer her call and adopt her as their daughter. They bring her up as Mandodari.George Williams (2008) [2003], A Handbook of Hindu Mythology, Oxford University Press, , pages 208-9 In this version, Meghanada, the son of the demon-king Ravana and Mandodari, is said to originate from the seed of Shiva embedded in Mandodari's body. Scene from the Thai Ramakien, Thotsakan (Ravana), carries Montho (Mandodari) back to his kingdom. In the Telugu Ranganatha Ramayana, Parvati creates a doll, which is turned into a damsel by Shiva. However later, Parvati becomes worried due to the maiden's beauty; Shiva turns her into a frog, who is later turned back to a human and granted to Mayasura as a daughter. In another Telugu tale and the Kuchipudi dance tradition, Ravana asks Shiva for Parvati as his wife. Shiva consents; however Parvati creates a look-alike maiden from a frog and entrusts her to Ravana. Since the woman was created from a frog, she was called Mandodari.Mandodari - Born of a Frog Devlok Mini with Devdutt Pattnaik Feb 16, 2018 In the Ananda Ramayana, Vishnu creates Mandodari from sandalwood paste smeared on his body and rescues Parvati from Ravana by handing him Mandodari as the real Parvati. The frog motif also reiterated in other stories. The Odia Dharma Purana narrates that the earth sends her son Maninaga to poison their cow's milk of the sages Mandar and Udar, who had denied her the share of the milk. A female frog jumps in the vessel to save the sages. Cursed by the sages for her supposed gluttony, she turns into a beautiful maiden called Vengavati. She has pre-martial coitus with Vali. Ravana demands her hand in marriage from the sages, who refuse. Ravana assumes Vali's form and kidnaps Vengavati. The real Vali and Ravana pull in opposite directions, thereby tearing her apart. As a consequence, Angada (generally described as Tara's son) is born. The death-god Yama and wind-god Vayu resurrect her and is named as Mandodari, after the two sages. Mahari dance tradition narrates a similar tale where a snake poisoned the milk of a hermit; the female frog jumps in the milk and dies to rescue the sage. She is cursed by the hermit in the misbelief of her greed and turns into the beautiful Mandodari. Marriage with Ravana Ravana comes to the house of Mayasura and falls in love with Mandodari. Mandodari and Ravana are soon married with Vedic rites. Mandodari bears Ravana's two sons: Meghanada (Indrajit), Atikaya and Akshayakumara. Mandore, a town located 9 km north of Jodhpur, is believed to be the native place of Mandodari. Ravana is treated as a son-in-law among some local Brahmins and has a temple dedicated to him here. Despite Ravana's faults, Mandodari loves him and is proud of his strength. She is aware of Ravana's weakness towards women. A righteous woman, Mandodari tries to lead Ravana to righteousness, but Ravana always ignores her advice. She advises him to not to subdue the Navagraha, the nine celestial beings that govern one's destiny, and not to seduce Vedavati, who would be reborn as Sita and cause the destruction of Ravana. Saviour of Sita Mandodari stops Ravana from slaying Sita. Ravana kidnaps Sita, the wife of Rama (the exiled prince of Ayodhya and avatar of the god Vishnu). Mandodari advises Ravana to return Sita to Rama, but to no avail. Mandodari knows this lust will bring the downfall of Ravana. Mandodari is described as a beautiful woman in Valmiki's Ramayana. When Hanuman, the monkey messenger of Rama, comes to Lanka in search of Sita, he is stupefied by Mandodari's beauty when he enters Ravana's bed chambers and mistakes Mandodari for Sita.Mani p. 476 When Hanuman finally finds Sita, he finds Ravana threatening to kill Sita unless she marries him. Ravana raises his sword to behead Sita when she refuses. Mandodari saves Sita by holding Ravana's hand. Mandodari says that the murder of a woman is a heinous sin and thus Ravana should not kill Sita. She asks Ravana to entertain himself with his other wives and give up the idea of having Sita as his wife. Ravana spares Sita's life, but does not give up his wish to marry Sita. Though Mandodari considers Sita inferior to her in beauty and ancestry, Mandodari acknowledges Sita's devotion to Rama and compares her to goddesses like Sachi and Rohini. During the war When all attempts for a peaceful return of Sita fail, Rama declares war on Ravana's Lanka. Before the final battle against Rama, Mandodari makes a last attempt to dissuade Ravana, but to no avail. Finally, Mandodari stands by her husband in the final battle like an obedient and faithful wife, though she advises her son Meghanada, alias Indrajit (\\"One who had conquered Indra; the god-king of heaven\\"), not to fight Rama. Several manuscripts of the Ramayana mention a story in which Angada drags Mandodari by her hair in presence of Ravana as a punishment for Ravana's treatment of Sita. Satyatirtha, a commentator on Ramayana, dismisses this story as spurious. According to this story: When all of Ravana's sons and warriors die, Ravana organizes a yajna (\\"fire sacrifice\\") to assure his victory. Rama sends a troop of monkeys headed by Hanuman and the monkey prince Angada to destroy this yajna. The monkeys create havoc in Ravana's palace, but Ravana continues the yajna. Angada drags Mandodari by her hair in front of Ravana. Mandodari pleads to her husband to save her and reminds him what Rama is doing for his wife. The enraged Ravana abandons the yajna and strikes Angada with his sword. With the yajna disturbed, Angada's purpose is served and he leaves Mandodari and escapes. Mandodari again implores Ravana to surrender Sita to Rama, but he refuses. Other Ramayana adaptations present more gruesome descriptions of the incident. The Krittivasi Ramayan narrates that the monkeys dragged Mandodari and tore off her clothes. In Bicitra Ramayana, it is Hanuman who humiliates Mandodari. The Thai adaptation Ramakien narrates a symbolic rape of Mandodari. that Hanuman sleeps with Mandodari in the form of Ravana and destroys her chastity, which protects Ravana's life. While preparations for Ravana's funeral are underway, Ravana's wives headed by Mandodari (with her back to the viewer, upbraiding her hair) lament his death. Ravana fights the final duel with Rama. Rama fails to kill Ravana with his ordinary arrows, but finally kills with a magical arrow. While Valmiki's Ramayana narrates that the magical arrow was given to Rama by Indra, in other versions the magical arrow is hidden in Mandodari's bed chambers or under her bed. While Mandodari is engrossed in worshipping the goddess Parvati for Ravana's wellbeing, Hanuman comes to her disguised as a Brahmin. After winning her confidence, he tricks her into revealing the secret location of the arrow. Hanuman seizes the arrow and gives it to Rama, leading to Ravana's end. Mandodari appears at the death scene of Ravana in a disarrayed state and laments his death. In this battle, Mandodari loses her husband, her sons and her kinsmen. Remarriage with Vibhishana? The Valmiki Ramayana never mentioned this incident, but many versions of Ramayana state that after the death of Ravana, Rama advises Vibhishana to take Mandodari as his wife, even though he already has a wife. A theory suggests that Ravana's race may have had matrilineal families and thus, to restore order in the kingdom after Ravana's death, it was necessary for Vibhishana to marry the reigning queen to get the right to rule. Another theory suggests it may be a non-Aryan custom to marry the reigning queen. The marriage between Mandodari and Vibhishana is purely an \\"act of statesmanship\\", rather than a marriage based on their \\"mutual sexual interference\\". Mandodari may have agreed to marry Vibhishana, her younger brother-in-law, as this would lead the kingdom to prosperity and stability as allies of Rama's Ayodhya, and she would continue to have a say in governance. Another reason for the marriage is as an alternative to suicide for the widowed Mandodari, which is averted by Rama. Mother of Sita? Ravana abducts Rama's wife, Sita. According to some Ramayana adaptations, Ravana was abducting his own daughter from a union with Mandodari. Though Valmiki's Ramayana does not record Mandodari as being the mother of Sita, some later adaptations of the Ramayana depict Mandodari as the mother of Sita or at least the cause of the latter's birth. The Adbhuta Ramayana narrates: Ravana used to store the blood of sages he killed in a large pot. The sage Gritsamada was practicing penance to acquire the goddess Lakshmi as his daughter. He stored milk from Darbha grass and purified it with mantras in a pot so that Lakshmi would inhabit it. Ravana poured the milk from this pot into his blood pot. Mandodari is frustrated seeing the evil deeds of Ravana, so she decides to commit suicide by drinking the contents of the blood-pot, which is described to be more poisonous than poison. Instead of dying, Mandodari gets pregnant with the incarnation of Lakshmi due to the power of Gritsamada's milk. Mandodari buries the foetus in Kurukshetra, where it is discovered by Janaka, who named her Sita. The Devi Bhagavata Purana says: When Ravana wants to marry Mandodari, Maya warns him that her horoscope indicated her first-born would destroy her clan and should be killed. Ignoring Maya's advice, Ravana buries his first child by Mandodari in a casket in Janaka‚Äôs city, where it is discovered and grew up as Sita. Jain adaptations of the Ramayana like Vasudevahindi, Uttara-purana, and others also state that Sita is the daughter of Ravana and Mandodari, and is abandoned when she is prophesied to be the cause of the end of Ravana and his family. In the Malay Seri Rama and the Indonesian-Javanese Rama Keling, Ravana wants to possess Mandodari, the mother of Rama, but instead marries a pseudo-Mandodari, who looks like the real one. Rama's father has a union with this pseudo- Mandodari, resulting in the birth of Sita, who is nominally Ravana's daughter. According to the Ananda Ramayana, king Padmaksha had a daughter named Padma - an incarnate of the goddess Lakshmi. When her marriage is organized, Rakshasas (demons) kill the king. The grief-stricken Padma jumps into fire. Ravana discovers her body, which had turned into five jewels, in the fire and takes it to Lanka sealed in a box. Mandodari opens the box and finds Padma inside it. She advises Ravana to cast off the box containing the ill-fated Padma, who led to the doom of her father. When the lid of the box is closed, Padma curses Ravana that she will return to Lanka and cause his doom. Ravana buries the box in the city of Janaka, who discovers Padma and brings her up as Sita.Mani p. 721 Assessment Queen Mandodari and the women of Lanka mourning the death of Ravana.

Hindus remember the panchakanya - the five virgins or maidens in this daily prayer, though none of them is considered an ideal woman who could be emulated. Mandodari, with Ahalya and Tara, belong to the Ramayana, while the rest are from the Mahabharata. Among the five elements, Mandodari is equated to water, \\"turbulent on the surface and deep in her spiritual quest\\". The writer Dhanalakshmi Ayyer says: > Her story is a reminder that the universal denigration of a group, based on > the behaviour of a few, cannot cloud the greatness of the individual. > Mandodari defies the stereotype of this racism. She is simple, unswerving, > and self-effacing, driven by the light of knowledge which gives meaning to > solid materialism in an age that is shrouded by impulse, passion, and > desire. She is the instrument that awakens the mind and counsels reason when > irrationality becomes the core being. That she goes unheard and unheeded > does not change her path.

Mandodari thought that > her duty to her husband on issues of morals and values ended with her > telling him what she thought of his actions. She neither put up any brave > fight to stop him nor considered it her duty to do so. Mandodari's role is short in the Ramayana but very important. She is described as a pious and righteous royal lady. Compared to the rest of the panchakanya, Mukherjee considers Mandodari's life as \\"less colourful and eventful\\". He adds: \\"Mandodari seldom got prominence ... Her image lacks substance and fades quickly\\", though he lays stress on her love and loyalty towards her husband. Pradip Bhattacharya, author of the book Panchkanya: Women of Substance notes that \\"there is hardly anything special that Valmiki (Ramayana) has written about her (Mandodari) except that she warns her husband to return Sita and has enough influence to prevent his [sic] raping her.\\" References ; Notes ; Bibliography   * * External links Category:Rakshasa in the Ramayana ","title":"Mandodari"},{"id":"2075285","text":"Jon Moritsugu (born February 15, 1965) is an American cult-underground filmmaker.

Rolling Stone named it one of the \\"25 Greatest Punk Rock Movies of All Time\\" and said: \\"Underground filmmaker/art terrorist Jon Moritsugu reimagines a rise-and-fall showbiz narrative as a scuzzy, 16mm skullfuck opus set in a lo-fi punk world...This movie feels like punk rock: dirty, angry, righteous, handmade, exhilirating.\\" The movie was self-released theatrically, after which Moritsugu moved to the West Coast in 1990. West Coast years Settling in San Francisco, Moritsugu completed Hippy Porn in 1991, a 16 mm black-and-white feature which shot for 10 days. Redolent of early Jim Jarmusch, it follows several terminally bored students at a pretentious art school, perfectly nailing the pervasive jadedness of wannabe artists.Harvey. \\"Jon Moritsugu - Back with a Vengeance.\\" Fandor.com. 04 June 2013. Web. 04 June 2013. Top indie label Matador Records was to release the movie's soundtrack, but after numerous and lengthy delays, Moritsugu terminated the deal. Stated label head Gerard Cosloy, \\"Jon Moritsugu set the Hippy Porn contract on fire and tore the CD negatives apart with his teeth (we didn't have the guts to tell him the test pressings arrived that day).\\" Hippy Porn was released theatrically in America and gained noticeable notoriety. Picked up for European distribution, the movie was a hit in the Netherlands, Switzerland and France, playing non-stop in Paris for over one year at the Action Christine Cinema. Moritsugu immediately started pre- production in 1992 for Mod Fuck Explosion, which starred Amy Davis. This low- budget riff on the teen film loosely revolved around a lonely girl's search for a leather jacket while a turf war between mods and bikers looms. The movie, produced by Henry S. Rosenthal and co-produced by Andrea Sperling, was shot by Todd Verow in 16mm. It featured a dream sequence set in garden of meat, which was filmed in Rosenthal's garage with 800 pounds of raw, rotting beef. After wrapping, and in the middle of post-production in 1993, Moritsugu received word that he had received a grant from ITVS to create a PBS television show. He says: \\"I completed (the script) in 42 hours... and it got the green light. So right after shooting Mod Fuck Explosion, I got $360,000 to shoot Terminal USA. Terminal USA, filmed in Panavision 16mm, was a vicious sitcom parody laying to waste the studious image of the \\"model minority.\\" The director himself played twins - a drug-dealing son and a repressed and closeted math nerd - in a radically dysfunctional Asian American family. The movie was an extreme challenge for Moritsugu, who again worked with producer Andrea Sperling and director of photography Todd Verow. In addition to complications with insurance, payroll, salaries and a large unionized cast and crew, the production itself was fraught with problems including a major outbreak of scabies on the set. Executive produced by James Schamus (former CEO of Focus Features), Moritsugu stated: \\"I sort of blew it. I was young, full of myself, no one could help me. I basically spit in his face\\". When Terminal USA was completed, it caused a firestorm of controversy with the conservative right because it had been funded with taxpayer money. It screened at the Toronto and Rotterdam Film Festivals and was broadcast on television in over 200 cities across America. After a European promotional tour and American appearances to support Terminal USA, Moritsugu resumed post-production work on Mod Fuck Explosion. \\"A defiantly rough-hewn return to barely-aboveground roots despite some overlaps with Terminal USA,\\" it was completed in 1994 and won \\"Best Feature\\" Award at the New York Underground Film Festival. It played the film fest circuit and received tremendous attention, with Moritsugu saying, \\"Mod Fuck blew-up in Germany, Scandinavia, and the Benelux countries‚Äîthey really responded to the angst, death, and Amy as a hot blonde walking on raw meat.\\" In America, the movie opened in a number of cities including a 13-week engagement in Los Angeles at the Laemmle Sunset 5 and sold-out runs in Seattle and Baltimore.<> Giant Robot said about the movie: \\"Jon Moritsugu hit some weird epiphany during the making of this film, which was his first mass- watchable work. Jon‚Äôs wife Amy Davis plays a performance art girl who‚Äôs caught in a rumble between a small group of mods and a Japanese motorcycle gang. [‚Ä¶] The performances are weird, intentionally screwed up, and dumb, but that‚Äôs part of the film‚Äôs brilliance. If you‚Äôre a fan of strange flicks, you‚Äôll start remembering the lines and using them. [‚Ä¶] Awesome soundtrack by Unrest and Karyo Tengoku\\". The movie was picked by the readers of Wired as one of the \\"Wildest Exploitation Movies,\\" sharing the honor with Eraserhead, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, Night of the Living Dead and Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!. Moritsugu's next feature was 1997's Fame Whore, which reprised sitcom mockery and absurdism in service of three parallel stories critiquing fame and featuring Amy Davis as a stoner, trust-fund brat. Produced again by Andrea Sperling, the 16mm movie was a recipient of a Rockefeller Foundation Award. It received \\"Best Feature\\" and \\"Festival Choice\\" honors at the New York Underground Film Festival and the Los Angeles Times said of it, \\"Fame Whore is crude, edgy and energetic, and its stars throw themselves into their roles with welcome gusto.\\"http://jonmoritsugu.com/films/awards.php?film=fame_whore The movie opened theatrically throughout the US and Europe, screening at Lincoln Center in NYC and running for 5 weeks in Los Angeles.http://jonmoritsugu.com/films/reviews.php?film=fame_whore Fame Whore was considered for an Academy Award in 1999, but it was rejected on a technicality because it had opened in Los Angeles in 16 mm, and at the time, all Academy Award considerations had to be shown in 35 mm. In late 1999 Moritsugu started work on his next feature, Scumrock, produced once again by Andrea Sperling. He stated: \\"The original plan was for Scumrock to be a $2 million, 35mm picture. I thought it was totally do-able, what with the success of Fame Whore. This budget proved to be elusive so we cut it down to $50,000. And alas, we ended up shooting Scumrock for $5,000 using a $150 camcorder.\\" Starring Amy Davis (who also was co-writer and director of photography), James Duval (\\"Frank the Bunny\\" from Donnie Darko), and Kyp Malone (who would later join the band TV on the Radio), the movie was a deadpan comedy capturing the lives of fringe-art rebels dealing with the perils of turning 30 with little to show for their avant- gardness.http://jonmoritsugu.com/films/reviews.php?film=scumrock After receiving a post-production grant from Creative Capital, the movie's footage was decimated and completely degenerated, Moritsugu's intent being to drag it into the gutter and destroy any sheen or aura of a \\"pristine digital look.\\" Scumrock was edited on a VHS cuts-only system and upon completion in 2002, it won the \\"Best Feature\\" Award at the Chicago Underground Film Festival, following that up with a \\"Best Feature\\" Award at the 2003 New York Underground Film Festival. It was selected by The Village Voice Film Critics Poll as \\"Best of 2003\\" and then opened theatrically in the US and Canada in 2004, receiving rave reviews from the Los Angeles Times, LA Weekly and E!. After Scumrock, Moritsugu took a break from \\"cinema,\\" focusing on musical and other creative outlets and moving with Davis to Honolulu, Seattle, and finally Santa Fe. New Mexico In 2010, Moritsugu began production on his seventh feature, Pig Death Machine. Starring Davis (who was also co-writer) and lensed by Todd Verow in digital video, the movie was shot in the wilds of New Mexico over 12 days with a small crew. In spring 2011 and in the middle of Pig Death Machine post-production, Moritsugu directed with Davis a music video for the song \\"No Future Shock\\" by Brooklyn rock band TV on the Radio. As described by writer Rani Molla: \\"Santa Fe filmmakers Jon Moritsugu and Amy Davis veer (very slightly) from their underground experimental base with a music video released today for popular Brooklyn experimental band TV on the Radio. The video is one in a movie-length series of music videos for the band's new album Nine Types of Light\\". In 2012, the project received a Grammy Nomination in the \\"Long Form Music Video\\" category. In 2013 Pig Death Machine premiered at the Chicago Underground Film Festival, where Moritsugu and Davis won the \\"Jack Smith Lifetime Achievement Award.\\" The movie screened at a number of US and international film festivals and also made it onto several \\"Best Films of 2013\\" lists including one compiled by critic Jack Sargeant.http://jonmoritsugu.com/films/awards2.php?film=pig_death It then opened theatrically across America and also played with the Moritsugu retrospective of 7 features and 9 shorts in select cities including Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco. Pig Death Machine received glowing reviews from the Wall Street Journal, Los Angeles Times and LA Weekly.http://jonmoritsugu.com/films/reviews2.php?film=pig_death In 2015, Anthology Film Archives of New York City completed a two-year restoration project of Moritsugu's 1987 senior thesis film, Der Elvis. With support from the National Film Preservation Foundation and the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, the movie was digitally scanned, remastered, reprinted in 16mm and described as, \\"one of the most impressive and precocious student films ever made.\\" Later that year, Moritsugu wrote and directed his first fashion video lookbook. Created for Mishka NYC's fall 2015 collection, the project was co-written and photographed by Davis and featured the music of Low on High. Also in 2015, James Schamus, former CEO of Focus Features, stated to the New York Times: \\"Jon is a true cinema original. I'd rather be spit on by Jon than kissed by 95 percent of the directors out there.\\" In September 2016, an exhibition of seven Moritsugu features opened at the Ramiken Crucible in NYC. Entitled \\"Semiotics of Sleaze,\\" the movies were projected simultaneous on the gallery's walls for a one-month run. The Village Voice wrote: \\"Jon Moritsugu's cinema is aggressive, abrasive, and it doesn't stop. His zero- budget movies have spastic editing, disorienting post-sync sound, and bright neon colors; they're a treat for the senses, and poison for the mind... While watching his films, you may feel tired, weak, or nauseous, but you will have had an experience, and a physical one at that ‚Äì an effect to which many moving images can't lay claim... The gallery is showing these works simultaneously and blasting them at full volume; you'll feel the noise.\\" In August 2017, Moritsugu wrapped principal photography for his eighth feature, Numbskull Revolution. Shot in New Mexico, the movie aims to \\"satirize and deconstruct the high art scene in an eyeball-scorching onslaught of mind-blowing narrative madness and honey-laced pathos\\".\\" It stars James Duval as artist \\"Futurecide\\" and Amy Davis as twin sisters. Moritsugu landed a book deal in 2018 and is writing his memoir and completing post-production for Numbskull Revolution. Music Moritsugu also fronted (1997‚Äì98) a punk band with Andy Matinog and Mike Masatsugu called No-No Boy after the novel by John Okada and is currently in a lo-fi indie garage rock band with Amy Davis called Low on High.

It is administered within Horsham District Council and West Sussex County Council. History One of the oldest buildings in the parish is Great House Farmhouse, a listed building at Grade II* built up from a late medieval structure in the Tudor period just west of the town. Whilst mixed agriculture provided a lucrative industry for centuries, much of the population of Southwater originated from the workforce of the brick industry which thrived in the clay-pits until the 1980s. Following the closure of the brickworks, there was a project implemented to transform the area into a country park, which is now a major family attraction in the district. Community In 2006 the centre of Southwater Village was renewed at a cost of ¬£25 million. Southwater has three public houses: the Hen and Chicken; the Tipsy Fox; and the Lintot which opened soon after the building of Lintot Square - the name is a reference to Barnaby Bernard Lintot (1675‚Äì1736), an English publisher born in Southwater. Southwater Country Park is a 70-acre site with three lakes and numerous access paths located close to the centre of the village. The Park contains a visitor centre with information displays, and also a caf√©, a skate park, and a children's adventure playground, and Southwater Water Sports Centre with facilities for sailing and canoeing. The Country Park and the Southwater Area Community Centre both have direct access to the Downs Link footpath/cycleway. Church Holy Innocents Anglican parish church dates from 1848‚Äì49 and is Grade II listed. Grade II Listing details of Holy Innocents Church. The Church was consecrated by Ashurst Turner Gilbert, Bishop of Chichester, on 7 June 1850, and the ecclesiastical parish was formed from part of Horsham Parish in the north and part of Shipley Parish in the south.

He was the second king of the Jim√©nez dynasty, succeeding his father when he was merely six years old.  Biography  Son of Sancho I and Toda Azn√°rez, he succeeded his father in 925 when he was only six years old and reigned under the tutelage of his uncle Jimeno Garc√©s and of his mother, Toda. Three of Garc√≠a's sisters married kings of Le√≥n: Urraca married Ramiro II; Oneca was the wife of Alfonso IV; and Sancha S√°nchez was first married to Ordo√±o II. After Ordo√±o's death, she became the wife of √Ålvaro Herram√©liz, Count of √Ålava, and after his death married Fern√°n Gonz√°lez, Count of Castile. Another sister, Velasquita, married Munio V√©laz, who was √Ålvaro Herram√©liz's predecessor as count of √Ålava. According to historian Gonzalo Mart√≠nez D√≠ez, \\"the intimate family ties of the Navarrese dynasty with the monarchs of Le√≥n and with the counts of Castile and √Ålava, would be reflected in the battlefield where soldiers from Pamplona frequently fought side by side with the Leonese and Castilians against a common enemy, Islam\\". Thanks to this web of alliances crafted by Queen Toda, Pamplona was able to increase its power and play a key role in the affairs of the Christian kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula. Upon the death of his uncle and tutor, Jimeno Garc√©s, on 29 May 931, another uncle, √ç√±igo Garc√©s, half- brother of Garc√≠a's father, Sancho I, probably tried to become the regent of the kingdom and perhaps even usurp the throne, to the detriment of his nephew's rights. Both Garc√≠a and his mother Toda appear in a charter at the Abbey of San Pedro de Siresa on 9 March 933 without the royal titles. A year later, in May 934, the Caliph of C√≥rdoba, Abd-ar-Rahman III, led a military expedition against King Ramiro II of Le√≥n. The Caliph's original intention was to penetrate Castile, but he changed his plans when the Tujibid governor of Zaragoza, Muhammad ibn Hashim, refused to join forces. His armies first attacked the fortress in Maluenda and then ibn Hashim's fortress in Rueda de Jal√≥n. When Abd-ar-Rahman was about to penetrate the Kingdom of Pamplona, he received an embassy from Toda asking him to withdraw his troops, and also reminding him of the family ties that bound them. The objective of Toda's embassy to his nephew Abd-ar-Rahman III could also have been to seek his protection for herself and her son and to have the Caliph \\"expressly recognize her son, the young monarch Garc√≠a S√°nchez I\\". This would have secured Garc√≠a the crown in the face of possible counterclaimants (such as √ç√±igo Garc√©s). Abd-ar-Rahman, who had never met his aunt, imposed the condition that she was to meet him at his camp in Calahorra \\"as proof of the sincerity of her motives\\". She accepted and went to meet him. As described by historian Ibn Hayyan, as part of the \\"pact of submission and vassalage\\", she was to submit to him and detach herself from the other Christian rulers, allies, and relatives, desist from supporting them, and do nothing to hurt the Muslims. She was also to allow free passage to his armies through the Kingdom of Pamplona and had to liberate the Muslim hostages that she had as a pledge for a payment due to her. She consented to all of his demands and he, in turn, gave her son, Garc√≠a, Pamplona and all of its districts in investiture. She left on the same day taking with her the rich presents that he had given her. Shortly afterwards, the Muslim armies rapidly crossed the territory under the Pamplonese monarchy so as not to cause damage, and attacked the neighboring √Ålava and Castile, attacking the fortress in Gra√±√≥n. They burned crops, chopped down fruit trees, and destroyed vineyards and buildings along the way. In 937, King Garc√≠a allied himself with Ramiro II of Le√≥n and Muhammad ibn Hashim, governor of Zaragoza, resulting in a military campaign by Abd-ar- Rahman III via Calatayud and Zaragoza into Garc√≠a's lands. He participated in July 939 in the Battle of Simancas alongside Ramiro II and Fern√°n Gonz√°lez with the Christian armies defeating the caliphal forces. After this reversal, Abd-ar-Rahman III was planning another expedition for March 940 but suspended all plans when he received a messenger from Ramiro II to negotiate a truce. The Caliph, in response, also sent an envoy to the Leonese court for the negotiations. At about the same time or sometime before, he had also begun talks with Sunyer, Count of Barcelona, the result of which was a two-year truce. The accord, very advantageous for the Christians in commercial terms, included several conditions, one of which was the cancellation of the plans (or the annulment of the marriage) of King Garc√≠a with Count Sunyer's daughter. The peace negotiations between King Ramiro II and Abd-ar-Rahman III were not concluded until the summer of 941. The peace included \\"all the frontier communities between the kingdoms of Leon and Pamplona, from Santar√©m to Huesca since Ramiro had a great interest in including Garc√≠a S√°nchez I, the king who governed the destinies of the Pyrenean kingdom, rather than leaving him in the hands of Abd-ar-Rahman as the only Christian ruler remaining in a state of war with the Cordoban caliphate\\". Following the death of Ramiro II and his successor Ordo√±o III of Le√≥n, the Pamplona kingdom threw support behind the deceased king's younger brother, Sancho I of Le√≥n, who was Garc√≠a's nephew. When Garc√≠a's brother-in-law, later also his son-in-law, and ally Fern√°n Gonz√°lez of Castile switched his support and installed his own son-in- law Ordo√±o IV of Le√≥n in place of Sancho, Fern√°n's relationship with Garc√≠a became strained and the death of Fern√°n's wife, Garc√≠a's sister Sancha, the next year led to a break. Garc√≠a directly intervened in Le√≥n, capturing Fern√°n and restoring Sancho. Fern√°n was forced to make territorial concessions to Garc√≠a to gain his release and their alliance wasn't fully restored until 964, when Fern√°n remarried, this time to Garc√≠a's daughter Urraca. He died on 22 February 970 and was interred in the castle of San Esteban de Deyo in Villamayor de Monjard√≠n, Navarre.  Marriage and children  Garc√≠a married his first cousin Andregoto Gal√≠ndez, daughter of Galindo Azn√°rez II, Count of Aragon and his wife Sancha Garc√©s. Given that Galindo Azn√°rez II did not have any legitimate male heirs, the rights to the County of Aragon passed down to Andregoto, and then to her first son with Garc√≠a S√°nchez, as a county within the Kingdom of Pamplona. The following children were born of this marriage: * Sancho II of Pamplona, King of Pamplona and Count of Aragon until his death in 994. He was married to his first cousin, Urraca Fern√°ndez, daughter of Fern√°n Gonz√°lez of Castile, Count of Castile and his wife Sancha S√°nchez, who was Sancho's paternal aunt. * Toda Garc√©s Andregoto was repudiated by her husband in 942. She retired to her lands in Aibar where she died sometime after June 971. The King had reached an agreement to marry the daughter of Sunyer, Count of Barcelona, but the forced submission of Sunyer to Abd-ar-Rahman included the abandonment of this plan. By 943, Garc√≠a had married Teresa of Le√≥n, daughter of his ally King Ramiro II of Le√≥n and Adosinda Guti√©rrez. They had the following children: * Ramiro Garc√©s of Viguera (died 981), first King of Viguera. * Jimeno Garc√©s * Urraca Garc√©s (died before 1008), was the second wife of Fern√°n Gonz√°lez, Count of Castile, and, after his death, married to count William S√°nchez of Gascony.

The music played at such recitals is typically written for pipe organ, which includes church organs, theatre organs and symphonic organs (also known as concert organs). Increasing restoration of theatre and cinema organs (such as the Wurlitzers) also allows current performances of many pieces that can only be played on theatre organs. History Recitals appear to have arisen from playing before and after religious services. In 19th-century synagogues, organs appeared before their use in services was allowed; instead their purpose was to give concerts before the sundown Shabat service. Sweelinck's duties described here included the giving of extra-liturgical concerts in Amsterdam's Oude Kerk.  Logistics  Pipe organs are not, in general, portable instruments. The venues for organ recitals using those instruments are thus the churches, theatres, or halls where the organs are housed. Some instruments of about a century ago were built to be listened to while strolling, such as those at the Wanamaker department store in Philadelphia or the museum of San Francisco's Palace of the Legion of Honor, which is not heard to best advantage from any one spot. However, with some organs the console is portable to a limited extent (such as, for example, being attached to a platform that can be raised or lowered, which is often the case for theatre organs, but less often the case for church organs, with some exception, like the Crystal Cathedral organ in California. Where this is the case, the console is moved for the recital so that the audience can see the organist playing.  Notable venues and recitals  The Wanamaker Organ is played twice daily, Monday through Saturday, free of charge, for patrons and those who visit Macy's Department Store in the Wanamaker Building in Philadelphia. The Grand Court Organist is Peter Richard Conte, and when he is touring, assistant organists perform to ensure the organ is played every day. The Dane and Polly Bales Organ Recital Hall at the University of Kansas was specifically constructed for organ recitals. The Harvard Organ Society holds regular organ recitals at the Adolphus Busch Hall. The Temple Square Organ Recitals show off the organs in and around Temple Square, including the Salt Lake Tabernacle organ (most often in the Tabernacle) others are the LDS Conference Center organ and the Salt Lake Assembly Hall organ (occasionally). During the summer: Monday through Saturday noon and 2 pm. Sunday 2 pm. Non- summer: Monday through Saturday noon, and Sunday at 2 pm. To show off its new concert organ, the Walt Disney Concert Hall held a series of organ recitals in 2004 and 2005. There is now a regular season of organ recitals at the venue featuring famous classical organists from around the world. In Hollywood, California, the historic El Capitan Theater (also owned by the Disney company) showcases its Wurlitzer Organ regularly before its scheduled shows and movie showings. Organ recitals preceding Disney shows usually consist of Disney Favorites and Show Tunes, but well-known theater organ greats occasionally visit to do special shows at the theater, such as Bob Ralston of Lawrence Welk fame. Mr. Ralston also hosts organ recitals at his home in Granada Hills. Also in California, the Orange County Theater Organ Society hosts frequent theater organ recitals at the Plummer Auditorium in Fullerton, featuring its own original Wurlitzer pipe organ from 1930. As part of its season, some of these recital programs also include a silent film accompanied by the theater organ, to provide a complete experience the way it was originally intended. A long list of accomplished organists regularly frequent the Plummer, including Chris Elliot and the inimitable Bob Ralston. While world-famous organist Frederick Swann was in residence at First Congregational Church in Los Angeles between 1998 and 2001, where he supervised the improvement of the organ to rival that of his former church, the Crystal Cathedral, to become the largest church organ in the world (with over 20,000 pipes), he instituted a music festival called \\"Organ Alive!\\" that featured organ recitals and concerts, collaborating with many renowned musicians to revive Los Angeles' organ music culture. The annual conference and organ series attracted people from all over the world to Los Angeles and continued in the years following Mr. Swann's retirement as principal organist of the church. Following the success of this recital series and the awareness that was revived in the city, two new significant pipe organs were commissioned in the city: that of the Disney Concert Hall and the Catholic Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels (one block from Disney Hall). The Los Angeles OLA Cathedral also holds weekly organ recitals on Wednesdays at 12:45 pm, following the noon mass. Follow the music link on the Cathedral's website for details on artists and programs. A performance of the complete organ works of Johann Sebastian Bach was held on November 22, 2014 at St. Peter's Lutheran Church in Manhattan. Twenty organists from The Juilliard School performed. Juilliard Organ Department Chair, Paul Jacobs, curated the eighteen-hour performance.

Life Salvini was born in Milan. His father and mother were both actors. His father was involved in the Bon and Berlaffa Company and the actor who was to play Pasquino fell ill. Instead of closing the theatre for the night his father asked the young Salvini to play the role. In his autobiography, he writes that \\"when I perceived that some of Pasquino's lines were amusing the audience, I took courage, and, like a little bird making his first flight, I arrived at the goal, and was eager to try again ‚Ä¶ It is certain that from that time I began to feel that I was somebody.\\" In 1847 Salvini joined the company of Adelaide Ristori, who was then at the beginning of her career. It was with her as Elettra that he won his first success in tragedy, playing the title role in Alfieri's Oreste at the Teatro Valle in Rome. Salvini fought in the First Italian War of Independence in 1849, but otherwise devoted his life to acting. In 1853, however, he took a year off because \\"he rarely felt adequately prepared for a role\\". During this time, he prepared roles in great depth. Salvini's most famous role was Othello, which he played for the first time at Vicenza in June 1856. His other important roles included Conrad in Paolo Giacometti's La Morte civile, Egisto in Alfieri's Merope, Saul in Alfieri's Saul, Paolo in Silvio Pellico's Francesca da Rimini, Oedipus in Niccolini's play of that name, Macbeth and King Lear. The core of his acting method came from his studies. While visiting Gibraltar, for example, he spent time studying the Moors and found one particular man whom he based his Othello on. Instead of relying on a mustache, which was the traditional way of depicting a Moor, he tried to copy \\"gestures, movements, and carriage\\" to depict the character. Salvini acted frequently in England, and made five visits to the United States, his first in 1873 and his last in 1889. In 1886, he played Othello to the Iago of Edwin Booth. He always delivered his lines in Italian while the rest of the company spoke English (except during his first tour, when he had an Italian company). According to the New York World (27 October 1885), \\"had he spoke Greek or Chocaw, it would have been much the same. There was that about him that was universal, and had he remained mute and contented himself with acting alone his audience could scarcely have failed to understand, so faithful was his portraiture of human instincts and their action\\" Salvini's acting in Othello greatly inspired the young Russian actor Constantin Stanislavski, who saw Salvini perform in Moscow in 1882 and who would, himself, go on to become one of the most important theatre practitioners in the history of theatre. Stanislavski wrote that Salvini was the \\"finest representative\\" of his own approach to acting.Stanislavski (1938, 19) and Benedetti (1999, 18). Alexander Salvini (1861-1896),Alexander Salvini, findagrave.com son of Tommaso Salvini Salvini retired from the stage in 1890, but in January 1902 took part in the celebration in Rome of Ristori's eightieth birthday. Salvini published a volume entitled Ricordi, aneddoti ed impressioni (Milan, 1895). Some idea of his career may be gathered from Leaves from the Autobiography of Tommaso Salvini (London, 1893). He died, aged 86, in Florence. Salvini was so confident in his talents as an actor that he was once quoted as saying, \\"I can make an audience weep by reading them a menu.\\" Salvini made at least one recording for Zonofono in 1902 of \\"Il sogno\\" from Saul. Listed in a contemporary Zonofono celebrity catalogue recently found. His son Alessandro (aka Alexander Salvini) (1861‚Äì1896), also an actor, had several notable successes in America, particularly as d'Artagnan in The Three Guardsmen. Another son, Gustavo Salvini, was a stage actor. Gustavo's sons, Tommaso's grandsons, were Alessandro Salvini (1890‚Äì1955) and Guido Salvini (1893‚Äì1965). Alessandro acted in movies dating back to silent pictures and Guido directed and wrote for films in the sound era. References Sources * * Benedetti, Jean. 1999. Stanislavski: His Life and Art.

Gartzez; c. 860 ‚Äì 10 December 925), also known as Sancho I, was King of Pamplona from 905 until 925. He was the son of Garc√≠a Jim√©nez and was the first king of Pamplona of the Jim√©nez dynasty. Sancho I was the feudal ruler of the Onsella valley, and expanded his power to all the neighboring territories. He was chosen to replace Fort√∫n Garc√©s by the Pamplonese nobility in 905.  Biography  Sancho Garc√©s was born around the year 860, son of Garc√≠a Jim√©nez and his second wife Dadildis de Pallars. Around the time of the death of King Garc√≠a √ç√±iguez he ruled the Onsella valley in the western part of the kingdom. He managed to take control of the city of Pamplona while Fort√∫n Garc√©s was still king, aided by Alfonso III of Asturias and the Count of Pallars. Along with the Pamplonese nobility, they plotted to remove the king's children from the line of succession, which passed down to the king's granddaughter Toda, who was married to Sancho Garc√©s. He proclaimed himself King of Pamplona in 905. Throughout his reign, he involved himself in the squabbles among the Muslim lords to the south with repeated success. In 907, he turned on his former ally Lubb ibn Muhammad, killing him in battle. Four years later, another former ally, Galindo Azn√°rez, joined with his brother-in-law Muhammad al-Tawil and Abd Allah ibn Lubb ibn Qasi to attack Sancho, but they were defeated and neutralized as a threat. Al- Tawil fled and was killed shortly afterward, and the power of the Banu Qasi was severely crippled, while Galindo was forced into vassalage to Sancho, leading to the incorporation of the County of Aragon into the Pamplona kingdom. In 918, Sancho combined with Ordo√±o II of Le√≥n to attack the Upper March. Though they failed to occupy N√°jera, they took Calahorra, Arnedo and Viguera from the Banu Qasi, and attacked Valtierra, and though they failed to take its fortress, they burned it's mosque and surrounding lands. Two years later Sancho teamed with Bernard I of Ribagorza and Amrus ibn Muhammed, son of Muhammad al-Tawil, to attack Banu Qasi-held Monz√≥n. His successes allowed him to join Lower Navarre to his own dominions and extend his territory as far as N√°jera. As a thanksgiving offering for his victories, in 924 he founded the monastery of San Mart√≠n de Albelda. He died near the town of Resa, close to the Ebro river on 10 December, 925 and was buried in Villamayor de Monjard√≠n. His son, Garc√≠a, was only seven years old, so Sancho was succeeded by his brother, Jimeno Garc√©s. Sancho appears to have been the original king called by the byname Abarca, though confusion among family members of the same name had led to it being instead applied to his grandson, Sancho II of Pamplona, by the 19th century. Sancho I gave rise to a dynasty that would rule several Iberian kingdoms, the last ruling until the 13th century, and the dynasty would be called the Banu Sanyo or the Banu Abarca by Al-Andalus scholars, denoting his role as founder.  Marriage and issue  The Kingdom of Pamplona at the death of Sancho I Sancho Garc√©s was married to Toda Azn√°rez, daughter of the Count Aznar S√°nchez and Onneca Fort√∫nez, herself being daughter of Fort√∫n Garc√©s. According to the C√≥dice de Roda, they had one son, Garc√≠a, and five daughters, all of whom except Orbita married either kings of Le√≥n or counts: * Garc√≠a S√°nchez I, King of Pamplona from 925 until 970, married first to Andregoto Gal√≠ndez, daughter of the Count of Aragon Galindo Azn√°rez II and later to Teresa Ram√≠rez, daughter of Ramiro II of Le√≥n. * Urraca S√°nchez, Queen consort of the Kingdom of Le√≥n from 931 until 951 after marrying Ramiro II of Le√≥n. * Oneca S√°nchez, Queen consort of the Kingdom of Le√≥n from 926 until 931 after marrying Alfonso IV of Le√≥n. * Sancha S√°nchez (died between 949 and 963), was queen consort of Le√≥n as the third wife of King Ordo√±o II. After the king's death in 924, she married √Ålvaro Herram√©liz, count of √Ålava and then, after his death in 931, she became the wife of Fern√°n Gonz√°lez, count of Castile, who also succeeded her second husband as count of √Ålava. * Velasquita S√°nchez, married first to Munio V√©laz, Count of √Ålava, second to Galindo of Ribargoza and third to Fort√∫n Galindez. * Orbita S√°nchez, nothing is known about her life. Out of wedlock, he had a daughter, Lupa S√°nchez, who was married to Dato II, Count of Bigorre, with whom she had one son, Raymond I, Count of Bigorre (940‚Äì956).

It is named for American explorer John C. Fremont who climbed the peak with Charles Preuss and Johnny Janisse from August 13 to August 15, 1842. Kit Carson had been with the climbing party on its first attempt at the peak, but had gone back for supplies the day Fremont and his men reached the summit. Carson is thought by some to have been the first to climb neighboring Jackson Peak. At that time, Fremont Peak was mistakenly thought to be the highest mountain in the Rocky Mountains, although there are actually over 100 higher peaks in the Rocky Mountain range.  Geography  The peak is located on the Continental Divide and is the second highest peak in the remote Wind River Range after Gannett Peak. The east flank of the peak is in the Fitzpatrick Wilderness of Shoshone National Forest, while the west side is in the Bridger Wilderness of Bridger-Teton National Forest. The Upper Fremont Glacier is located on the north slopes of the mountain.  Climbing  Due to the remote location and difficult ascent, most mountain climbers spend a total of three to five days hiking up to the mountain, climbing to the summit and then later hiking back to their starting point. Hazards Encountering bears is a concern in the Wind River Range. There are other concerns as well, including bugs, wildfires, adverse snow conditions and nighttime cold temperatures. Importantly, there have been notable incidents, including accidental deaths, due to falls from steep cliffs (a misstep could be fatal in this class 4/5 terrain) and due to falling rocks, over the years, including 1993, 2007 (involving an experienced NOLS leader), 2015 and 2018. Other incidents include a seriously injured backpacker being airlifted near SquareTop Mountain in 2005, and a fatal hiker incident (from an apparent accidental fall) in 2006 that involved state search and rescue. The U.S. Forest Service does not offer updated aggregated records on the official number of fatalities in the Wind River Range.

It is named after Hermenegildo Galeana, a lieutenant involved in the country's movement towards independence. Galeana shares borders with the states of Coahuila, San Luis Potos√≠ and Zacatecas to the west; with the municipalities of Aramberri and Doctor Arroyo to the south; Rayones to the north; and with Linares, Montemorelos, Rayones and Iturbide to the east. Galeana is the largest municipality in the state, totaling 7,154.6 km¬≤, however it's scarcely populated with only 38,930 inhabitants resulting in a population density of 0.18 persons per square kilometer. Galeana, the municipal seat, is the best developed town in the region. It has services such as hospitals, accommodations, restaurants, bars and the largest drink distributor in the zone. However it remains as a low per-capita income city. Climate Climate in Galeana is usually much colder than the rest of the state. In summer it is pleasantly cool and during winter, temperatures may reach down to -9¬∞C. Annual average temperature is 17¬∞C, and the average rain precipitation is around 446 mm. The winter cold blends with a noticeable lack of air humidity. Predominants winds comes from the north. =Crops= The main crop in Galeana is the potato, which is exported to different states and is also internationally shipped.

It is operated by Boston Harbor Cruises (BHC) under contract to the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA). The system consists of three routes that terminate in downtown Boston. F1 service runs from Rowes Wharf to Hewitt's Cove in Hingham. F2H service runs from Long Wharf to Hewitt's Cove, with some trips stopping at Logan Airport, Pemberton Point in Hull, and/or some of the Boston Harbor Islands. F4 service runs in the inner harbor between Long Wharf and the Charlestown Navy Yard. Two additional seasonal routes, not funded by the MBTA but included on some MBTA documents, run from Boston to Salem and Winthrop. In the 19th century, numerous steamship routes ran from Boston to various destinations in the inner harbor, North Shore, and South Shore, plus routes to elsewhere in New England and to Europe. Ferry service declined in the late 19th century and 20th century due to competition from railways, streetcars, and finally automobiles; by the 1930s, only summer routes plus the East Boston ferry remained. Year round service to Hull was reintroduced in 1963, and was then the only commuter ferry service in the country. This was followed by Hingham service in 1975, tourist-oriented Charlestown service in 1979, and Quincy service in 1996 ‚Äì as well as several other short-lived routes. Most routes were either unsubsidized or state-funded; from 1986 to 2002, they gradually became subsidized by the MBTA. Service to Quincy and Hull was combined in 1998; in 2013, the Quincy terminal was replaced by Hingham due to wharf damage. The MBTA owns two ferries used on the F2H route; BHC owns ferries used on the F1 and F4 routes. The ferry system has the highest on-time performance and farebox recovery ratio of MBTA service types. However, it is only a small component of MBTA service: in 2014, the three MBTA-funded routes carried 5,070 passengers per weekday ‚Äì about 0.3% of total MBTA ridership. Routes =Inner Harbor ferry= A ferry on the F4 route in 2006 *F4 Boston (Long Wharf)‚ÄìCharlestown Navy Yard service runs year-round on weekdays with ferries operating on 15-minute headways at rush hour and 30-minute headways at other times, and on a reduced schedule on weekends. The fare is $3.70; Zone 1A passes on CharlieCards are accepted. Boat service between Boston and Charlestown ended in 1786 after the completion of the Charles River Bridge. The Winnisimmet Ferry to Chelsea ran until January 1917, with a brief revival starting on May 15, 1990 during early Big Dig construction. Boston Harbor Cruises (BHC) began tourist-oriented service, funded by the National Park Service, between Long Wharf and the Navy Yard in June 1979. In June 1987, this was switched to general-purpose ferry service funded by the Boston Redevelopment Authority. In October 1988, the Massachusetts Department of Public Works (DPW) began a four- year reconfiguration of the interchange between the Tobin Bridge and the Charlestown High Bridge. Charlestown ferry service was then increased, with funding from the DPW via the MBTA, and increased again in 1989. In 2004, the MBTA began directly funding the service. Two additional routes ‚Äì the F3 Lovejoy Wharf‚ÄìBoston Navy Yard and F5 Lovejoy Wharf‚ÄìWorld Trade Center via Moakley Courthouse ‚Äì began operation in 1997 during Big Dig construction. They were discontinued on January 21, 2005 due to low ridership. The F5X Lovejoy Wharf‚ÄìWorld Trade Center express route was not funded by the MBTA and was run until February 24, 2006. A one-year pilot of a privately funded Lovejoy Wharf‚ÄìFan Pier route, intended mostly as a private employee shuttle, began in January 2019. It is overseen by the Massachusetts Convention Center Authority on behalf of private companies in the Seaport, rather than by the MBTA. The fare for public riders was substantially reduced in April 2019. F4 service was indefinitely suspended on March 17, 2020 due to reduced ridership during the COVID-19 pandemic. On June 22, 75% of weekday service was restored, though weekend service remains suspended. East Boston Former East Boston dock, used from 1995 to 1997 Ferry service to East Boston began in 1832 and lasted until 1952. City-run service ran from a wharf at Lewis Street to Long Wharf from 1995 to 1997; it was discontinued due to extremely low ridership (an average of 1.3 passengers per trip) as the Blue Line provided a faster and more frequent service along the same corridor. (second page) In 2011, then- mayor Thomas Menino proposed ferry service between East Boston and Fan Pier on the South Boston Waterfront, a route without current direct transit service. In August 2012, the Federal Highway Administration awarded $1.28 million to the city for the purchase of two boats. In September 2012, the Boston Redevelopment Authority accepted the grant and agreed to rehabilitate the East Boston Marine Terminal for the ferries, which were then expected to begin operation in 2013. In August 2014, the MBTA opened bidding for providing the two boats for East Boston service. However, the grant was less than the actual cost of two boats, and plans for the service stalled. =South Shore= The MBTA-owned Flying Cloud at Long Wharf on F2/F2H service in 2004 *F1 Boston (Rowes Wharf)‚ÄìHingham service runs year-round on weekdays only. The single- ride fare is $9.75; MBTA Commuter Rail passes from Zone 6 and above are accepted. *F2H Boston (Long Wharf)‚ÄìHingham and Hull via Logan Airport service runs year-round on weekdays and weekend service during the summer. Not all trips stop at Logan or Hingham; some also stop at Grape Island and Georges Island. The fare is $9.75 from Hingham and Hull to Boston (with Zone 6 or above passes accepted). Ferry service between Boston and Hingham began in 1832; after the South Shore Railroad began operation in 1849, ferries served largely recreational traffic rather than commuters. Service to Hull was added in 1848 (first Allerton Harbor, later Pemberton Point), and to Nantasket Beach in 1869. Service to the Hingham shipyard ended in 1898, though some service to Crow's Point lasted until 1923. Most of the Nantasket Boat Lines ferries were destroyed in a 1929 fire. The service was increasingly unprofitable to run; only summer service lasted past 1933. Hingham service ended in 1952; the last remains of Nantasket service ended in 1963. Massachusetts Bay Lines (MBL) restored year-round Pemberton Point‚ÄìBoston service in March 1963 ‚Äì then the only commuter ferry service in the country ‚Äì followed by seasonal Nantasket service in 1964. Bay State Cruises took over the route in 1980. Paragon Park closed in 1985, and Nantasket service ended again in 1992. In 1996, Bay State Cruises sold the Hull route to Boston Harbor Cruises (BHC), who obtained an MBTA subsidy. Renewed Rowes Wharf‚ÄìHingham service began with a single round trip on October 6, 1975. The service was initiated by Ed King, then director of the Massachusetts Port Authority. Service was run by several operators, sometimes with state funding, most of the next eight years. In March 1983, Massachusetts Bay Commuter Services began eleven subsidized round trips (reduced to eight that June). The state began subsidizing eight additional round trips by Boston Harbor Commuter Services in 1984 during Southeast Expressway reconstruction. The MBTA began subsidizing service in 1986; after 1991, only Boston Harbor Commuter Services received a subsidy. In the 1990s, expanded ferry service was proposed as an alternative to the controversial return of commuter rail service on the Greenbush Line. Boston Harbor Cruises (which had briefly operated Hingham service in 1978) took over the Hingham‚ÄìBoston service in 1997. The MBTA-owned Lightning at Quincy on F2/F2H service in 2008 In 1996, Water Transportation Associates (WTA), doing business as Harbor Express, began service between Fore River Shipyard in Quincy and Long Wharf via Logan Airport. Two ferries and five years of operations were funded by then-shipyard owner General Dynamics. Quincy‚ÄìLogan service began on November 18, 1996, with Long Wharf service added several weeks later. In 1998, the MBTA and BHC failed to reach a subsidy agreement. MBTA-subsidized Hull stops were added to several existing WTA Boston-Hingham trips. After the original funding ran out in 2001, the state funded service for the first half of 2002. In April 2002, the MBTA bought the WTA assets (two ferries, the Quincy terminal, and the Long Wharf lease); the WTA later won the contract to run the service. The MBTA designated the Hingham‚ÄìBoston service as F1 and Quincy‚ÄìBoston as F2, with trips serving Hull called F2H. Attempts in 2010 and 2011 to restore summer weekend service to Nantasket failed due to high fuel costs. On July 1, 2013, BHC took over Hingham services from WTA. Quincy service was temporarily discontinued on October 14, 2013, with boats redirected to Hingham, when a water main break added to existing structural problems with the sea wall at the Quincy wharf. In January 2014, the MBTA made the closure (and increased Hingham service) permanent after it was determined that repairs would cost $15 million for five years of additional service, or $50 million for 50 years. The damage also forced the closure of the USS Salem museum. Quincy proposed Squantum Point as an alternative terminal to maintain ferry service to the city. In July 2014, a neighboring shipyard purchased the Quincy site from the MBTA. The Salem was to be moved to East Boston in 2015; however, in February 2016 it was determined that it would stay in Quincy and eventually reopen. In 2019, Quincy submitted an application to the MBTA to establish Squatum‚ÄìLogan‚ÄìBoston service in 2020. Weekend summer service on the F2H route, last operated in 1998 and 1999, was introduced on May 24, 2014. The Hingham Intermodal Center was opened in January 2017, providing a larger waiting area and ticketing facilities. On January 2, 2018, ferry service to Hingham was indefinitely suspended due to ice damage to the dock during severe cold the previous week. Service resumed on January 15 after repairs to the dock. F1 and F2H was suspended on March 17, 2020 due to reduced ridership during the COVID-19 pandemic. On June 22, 75% of weekday service was restored, though weekend service remains suspended. =North Shore= The Salem Fast Ferry in June 2009 Two summer-only routes to the North Shore are not funded by the MBTA but are included on MBTA maps: *Salem Fast Ferry ‚Äì operates from Salem Ferry Terminal to Long Wharf. Four round trips are run Mondays through Wednesdays, and five round trips on other days. Fares are $8 for commuters and $25 for others; MBTA Zone 3 passes are accepted only on some weekday trips. *Winthrop Ferry ‚Äì operates from Winthrop Ferry Terminal to Central Wharf, with stops at Fan Pier and Marina Bay on most trips. Three round trips are run on weekdays and weekends. Fares are $6; MBTA passes are not accepted. Steamboat service between Salem and Boston was run at various points between 1818 and 1931; because of competition from the Eastern Railroad, it was largely intended for recreation. Service to Winthrop was operated during several periods between 1840 and 1898; it too was largely out-competed by the Boston, Revere Beach and Lynn Railroad for the commuter market. Lynn service was operated in the 1870s, and between 1892 and 1908. Ferry service between Boston and Salem was operated during the summer of 1998 by WTA, funded by a state grant. BHC ran unsubsidized service in the summers of 1999 and 2000. Salem service resumed on June 22, 2006, with a ferry funded largely by a $2.3 million state grant. It was operated by WTA during the summers of 2006 to 2011; BHC took over the service without subsidy in 2012. In 2009, Salem began allowing MBTA Commuter Rail passes to be used on certain peak-hour trips. Winthrop service, run by BHC under a three-year state grant, began on August 2, 2010 and lasted until 2012. A local charter operator ran some unsubsidized service in 2013. Service resumed on April 16, 2016 with a town-owned vessel operated by town employees. The Marina Bay stop (previously served by several short-lived services between 1977 and 1997) was added on August 16, 2016. The Boston terminal was at Fan Pier from April to June 2017, then Rowes Wharf (with an intermediate Fan Pier stop) for the remainder of the summer. Central Wharf became the Boston terminal in 2018. The service's high cost and low reliability has attracted criticism; it was not run for six weeks in 2019 due to mechanical issues and lack of staff. The Lynn Ferry formerly operated from Lynn Ferry Terminal to Central Wharf. Service began on May 19, 2014 with three weekday round trips, as a two-year pilot program funded by the state. Fares were $3.50; MBTA Commuter Rail passes from Zone 2 or above were accepted for fares. Although the state spent $8.5 million on the terminal and $4.5 million in federal funds was secured for a larger ferry, the service was not run in summer 2016 due to lack of $700,000 in operations funding. Service resumed for June--September 2017 with funding from MassDOT, with one daily round trip timed for commuting. Fares were doubled to $7, and MBTA passes were not accepted. Due to low ridership in 2017 ‚Äì just 30 daily passengers ‚Äì the service was not resumed in 2018. Operation All MBTA-funded services are operated by Boston Harbor Cruises (BHC) under contract to the MBTA. The Salem route is also operated by Boston Harbor Cruises, but under contract to the town. It is the most reliable mode of MBTA service, with on-time performance typically above 95%. In 2014, the MBTA-funded portion of the system carried 5,070 passengers per weekday ‚Äì about 0.3% of total MBTA ridership. Until 2017, the MBTA owned two ferries, the Lightning and the Flying Cloud, both built in 1996. They were largely replaced by the new catamarans Champion (named for Champion of the Seas) in October 2017, and Glory (after Glory of the Seas) in May 2018. The MBTA-owned ferries are used for the F2H route, while BHC-owned ferries are used for the F1 and F4 routes. , the MBTA plans to overhaul the older catamarans in 2020‚Äì22; new double-ended ferries for route F4 are also being considered. =Finances and averted cuts= MBTA boat services have the highest farebox recovery ratio of any MBTA service type ‚Äì 55% in 2012. However, the service still operated at a $5 million annual loss to the MBTA and carried a relatively small percentage of passengers, which resulted in calls for its discontinuance or modification. In 2012, facing a substantial budget gap, the MBTA proposed substantial service cuts and fare increases. All ferry routes were to be cut, resulting in $3.7 million savings for the agency. Temporary measures were found to avoid some service cuts including the ferries; however, weekend Quincy service was eliminated and fares raised 35% in an attempt to eliminate the subsidy required. State lawmakers also then proposed that Massport take over the ferries from the MBTA. By 2014, farebox recovery increased to 62%.

Karhupuisto Kallio Library (1912) The Kallio church, designed by Lars Sonck and built in 1908‚Äì1912, represents the Finnish national romantic school of architecture, as well as a change to Art Nouveau. Kallio () (literally \\"the rock\\") is a district and a neighbourhood in Helsinki, the capital of Finland, located on the eastern side of the Helsinki peninsula about one kilometre north from the city centre. It is one of the most densely populated areas in Finland. Kallio is separated from the city centre by the Siltasaarensalmi strait, over which is a bridge called Pitk√§silta (\\"long bridge\\"). Traditionally, the bridge symbolizes the divide between the affluent centre and the more working class areas around Kallio. After the forming of the new centre in the 19th century, the city expanded northward. The intense industrialization which began in the 1860s in Helsinki saw the construction of the industrial areas around S√∂rn√§inen harbour and to the workers' district of Kallio, with the area becoming inhabited mostly by factory workers. However, most of the working-class families have long ago been replaced as the most typical Kallio residents by young adults and elderly people living alone, in a process which could be seen as some sort of gentrification. For many people who move into Helsinki from elsewhere in Finland, Kallio is the area where they first settle. Most flats are small, and rents are typically lower than elsewhere in central Helsinki, partly explaining the area's popularity among students and artists. The small flat sizes also mean that Kallio is expected to resist full gentrification. However, the rents have increased as the district has grown more popular and become an increasingly desirable area to live in. Hakaniemi Market Hall (1914), is one of the three main market halls in Helsinki Kallio (and Harju, which is often considered a part of Kallio) also has, more than any other district in Helsinki, a reputation as a \\"bohemian\\" and liberal area. The area has a heterogeneous population and many bars. The area also has a number of sex shops, strip clubs and massage parlors. President Tarja Halonen was born in Kallio and lived there until she was elected president in 2000.  Street names  Five SE‚ÄìNW streets of Kallio are named with Finnish ordinal numbers: Ensi linja, Toinen linja, Kolmas linja, Nelj√§s linja and Viides linja, meaning First Line, Second Line, Third Line, Fourth Line and Fifth Line, forming thus an example of numbered streets, rare in Europe and unique in Helsinki. The SW‚ÄìNE streets in the same area are named after Finnish scientists from the 18th and 19th century. Starting from South-east these include: * Porthaninkatu, named after Henrik Gabriel Porthan, known as the Father of Finnish History. * Suonionkatu, named after Julius Krohn, known by his pen name Suonio. * Castr√©ninkatu, named after Matthias Castr√©n, ethnologist and philologist. * Wallininkatu, named after Georg August Wallin, orientalist and explorer. To the east, the Torkkelinm√§ki area also has: * Franz√©ninkatu, named after Frans Michael Franz√©n * Agricolankatu, named after Mikael Agricola, Protestant reformer and the father of Finnish written language. Many of the streets on both sides of Helsinginkatu in the Kallio and Harju are named after Swedish kings and lords of the 16th and 17th century * Vaasankatu, named after the royal House of Vasa that ruled Sweden 1523-1654 * Kustaankatu, named after the first Vasa king Gustav I of Sweden, reign 1523-1560 * Kaarlenkatu, named after Charles IX of Sweden, reign 1604-1611 * Fleminginkatu, named after the Fleming family * Sturenkatu, named after the Sture family * Brahenkatu (eastern and western), named after the Brahe family See also *Hakaniemi *S√∂rn√§inen *Merihaka External links * Baarikierros ‚Äì This animated, mapped site lists and reviews most of the bars in Kallio.

NEPAD parents the E-School Program and is an economic program that aims to bring economic and social development to African nations and ensure 'Africa's Renewal'. The E-School Program began with Demonstration Projects and has developed further yet remains a work in progress in many countries, facing both criticism and support.  Origins and Goals  The E-School program was developed in 2003 at the African Economic Summit. The project aims to provide computers, internet access, and other Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to all schools in Africa within 10 years, under the NEPAD agreement. The main goal of the program is to expand students' ability to learn in schools through internet connection and technology access. The aim is to cover all high schools within 5 years of the start of implementation and all primary schools within 10 years, a total of some 600,000 schools. This is an initiative to provide more equality and access to education across African schools. The program does this by bringing techniques used elsewhere, ICT, to provide more academic opportunities for African children to succeed. NEPAD schools are unique from non-NEPAD schools in that they have significantly higher integration of ICTs, allowing children more opportunities for academic improvement. At the World Economic Forum Africa Summit in Cape Town, it was announced that the first school to benefit from the program would be Bugulumbya Secondary School in the village of Busobya, Uganda. Projects = Demonstration Projects = The initial step in implementing the E-School Program the creation of 'Demonstration Projects' aimed to understand the most effective methods and the different situations which may be incurred along the implementation process. The main goals of these projects were to show \\"the costs, benefits, appropriateness and challenges of a satellite based network\\" which would be implemented under this program. These projects have been headed by \\"the private sector partners... AMD, Cisco, HP, Microsoft and Oracle\\". Each of these companies had a 'consortia' which contained other companies working on the initiative. Six schools from 16 African countries participated in these Demo Projects, but some (Kenya, Ghana, Rwanda) had much more investment into their programs than others. The Demo Project was only intended to last one year but faced challenges ,causing an extension. The project's aim was to discover the 'best practices' of implementing the program and how to do so most effectively. This demonstration project took place in 16 countries including: Algeria, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Egypt, Gabon, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Mali, Mauritius, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, South Africa and Uganda. The schools involved in the Demonstration Projects were also able to utilize the ICT early on in the preliminary test stages of the project. = Other Initiatives = Kenya There have been implementations of the NEPAD E-School program in Kenya. One study was done to compare the learning opportunities and resources of NEPAD secondary schools versus non-NEPAD secondary schools in Kenya. In this study, measures of the integration of the provided Information and Computer Technology (ICT) and the successes across six provinces in Kenya. The researchers selected six schools of each type (NEPAD and non-NEPAD) and used a questionnaire to determine the level of success of the schools within the recent past of the schools. They found that e-learning had been much more successful in application in NEPAD schools since students and teachers in E-Schools had better teacher support in utilizing e-learning than non-NEPAD schools. Rwanda Rwanda has seen growth in their school programs over the past two decades. Additionally, Rwanda was one of the nations which received ICT under a 'Demonstration Project' in 2006 which allowed a chance to utilize new technology in the growing school systems. But, one study uses examples from Rwanda to claim the objectives of the e-schools program have not been met. This study cites the nation's lack of ability to fund such an expensive program in a nation with a developing infrastructure. Many schools find it difficult to fully utilize the ICTs provided by the E-School program due to lack of funding, teacher training, and knowledge about the ICTs themselves.  Criticisms and Next Steps  As of 2012, not much change had been made towards the goal of the E-School Program. The countries which had the most initial investment in their schools by this program have seen the most success with the program. Many nations are still working to implement the program and utilize new ICT technologies in their school systems but have often found other obstacles, as mentioned above, in their way. Poor African nations are often unable to invest enough money into the program to make actual change. The program is costly and many nations in Africa do not have enough money or infrastructure to put adequate investment into the program. This was the case in Rwanda, which was unable to fully utilize the program's resources. The program is not deemed a failure but has faced many obstacles in its implementation, common in social projects in Africa. In the aforementioned study done in Kenya, researchers found one of the largest downfalls of the implementation of ICT into African schools to be the lack of teacher support and resources. Teachers are given general technology training through this program. However, they often have no additional training responses once this training is complete. This can be resolved through more investment in educational infrastructure at the most basic levels such as teacher training and school funding. Many schools have also been critical of the post-demo project sustainability of the program. However, to combat this, the project and schools themselves have worked to create sustainability plans for the program and tweak the necessities of the plans. This was suggested in the Demonstration Project's initial roll out to provide a next step for E-schools.

Biography =Early life= Henry Harrison Young was born in Mendon, Massachusetts, on February 9, 1841. Young's father died when he was young, which required him to care for his mother and younger sister. =Civil War service= A resident of Pawtucket, Rhode Island when the American Civil War started in April 1861, Young was eager to serve in the Union Army. With his sister, who was only ten years old at the time, driving a carriage for him, and a book of tactics open on his knee, he went from house to house, through the villages of Blackstone Valley. Stopping in public places and calling a crowd around his carriage, he harangued them with such patriotic ardor that in one day he enlisted sixty- three men for the Union Army. On June 6, 1861, at the age of 20, Young enlisted in the Union Army as a private in the 2nd Rhode Island Volunteer Infantry. Although only 5 feet 2 inches tall, Young proved to be a natural leader and a fierce fighter. Young fought with his regiment at the Battle of Bull Run on July 21, 1861. He was promoted to 2nd lieutenant the next day in recognition of his heroism during the battle and was again promoted to first lieutenant in November of that same year. Young would later fight in the Battle of Fredericksburg and the Battle of Salem Heights. On April 30, 1863, Young was promoted to captain and was assigned as an Acting Assistant Inspector General at the brigade headquarters. As this was an administrative position, it disagreed with Young as he desired to return combat service. He held this position until he was promoted to major in November 1864 and reassigned as an acting aide-de-camp and chief of scouts to Major General Philip Sheridan, commander of the Cavalry Corps of the Army of the Potomac. Young commanded a 58-man scout band, popularly called the \\"Jessie Scouts\\", under General Sheridan in the final months of the war. The Jessie Scouts employed irregular warfare tactics, such as wearing enemy uniforms, and provided long range reconnaissance behind enemy lines. Other activities included tapping telegraph wires and misdirecting supply trains. Young was noted for his ability to disguise himself as either a Confederate soldier or civilian and move unnoticed in Confederate camps gathering intelligence. By infiltrating the enemy in disguise he was legally considered a spy and could have been lawfully executed if captured by the Confederates. Among Young's notable exploits was the capture of Confederate Colonel Harry Gilmor on February 4, 1865. Gilmor was the leader of raiding detachment whose capture was considered critical to General Sheridan. Young, along with several of his scouts, disguised themselves as Confederate soldiers and told individuals who knew Gilmor they needed to see the colonel. When provided with Gilmor's location, Young went to the house and captured Gilmor in bed at gun point. Young then escorted him to the prison for Confederate officers at Fort Warren in Boston, Massachusetts, where Colonel Gilmor was delivered on February 10, 1865.http://www.jessiescouts.com/JS_Accounts_Young.html Young was breveted to lieutenant colonel of Volunteers in March 1865, shortly before he was mustered out of service four months later. =Post war= Colonel Young was mysteriously killed in late 1866 while crossing the Rio Grande. He was with a group of veteran soldiers on their way to serve as a bodyguard for Mexican General Mariano Escobedo who was allied with Mexican president Benito Juarez against Emperor Maximilian. Upon hearing of Young's death, General Sheridan wrote \\"Major Young‚Äôs record during the war, if the details could be gathered, would be of more interest than any romance of war ever written. I shall always remember him with pride and affection.\\" Legacy Young statue in Burnside Park, Providence, Rhode Island A statue named \\"The Scout\\" was erected in his honor at Burnside Park in downtown Providence, Rhode Island. This statue is probably a figurative representation of Young rather than literal one as the statue figure wears the uniform and accouterments of a Cavalry soldier whereas Young was an officer in the Infantry.

Many of the facilities there were originally built by Will Keith Kellogg of Kellogg's cereal, after whom the station is named. KBS includes nearly 16.5 square kilometres of land and, together with nearby state lands and preserves, allows for large-scale studies by biologists. The National Science Foundation has a Long-Term Ecological Research site at KBS. KBS offers classes to undergraduate and graduate students in biology-related fields, including the Enhancing Linkages between Mathematics and Ecology (ELME) program, which consists of three weeks of mathematics and four weeks of field work.

Situated above Gull Lake, it has spectacular lake views.W.K. Kellogg Manor House at Pure Michigan. The Manor House was designed by the architectural firm of Benjamin and Benjamin. Built in 1925, the Manor House served as a summer home for W.K. Kellogg and his second wife Dr. Carrie Staines. They lived there until 1942. Designed in a Tudor revival inspired style. It has leaded glass bay windows, oak coffered ceilings and Rookwood tile bathrooms and fireplaces. The estate also includes a Carriage house, green house with potting shed, a caretaker's cottage, boathouse, an authentic Dutch windmill and several beautiful gardens. Kellogg then gave permission for the house to be used by the Coast Guard as an induction and training center. With the end of World War II a need for rehabilitation centers arose. As the number of wounded soldiers rose, the Manor House was converted into an estate for injured veterans. In 1951 ownership of the estate changed hands. Upon Mr. Kellogg‚Äôs death, the Manor House and its surrounding land was given to Michigan State University. From the and outbuildings the Kellogg Biological Station was formed. The Manor House was recently restored to its original grandeur and is now open for tours. The two-story home is now used for conferences and weddings. In 1998 a grant was given by the Kellogg Foundation to restore the Manor House to its original state. Kellogg Bird Sanctuary Group of Cornerstone University ornithology students at Kellogg Bird Sanctuary A popular destination at the biological station is the Bird Sanctuary. Modeled after a similar wildlife refuge in Canada, the Bird Sanctuary is home to many wild birds and waterfowl, including trumpeter swan, Canada geese, diving and dabbling ducks, herons, cranes, songbirds, and more. The Sanctuary has been an integral part in re-establishing both Canada goose and trumpeter swan populations to the Midwest, serving as an important flyway stop for migrating birds. The Sanctuary also houses captive birds of prey and game birds on-site. Originally opened as a refuge in 1927, the sanctuary was donated to the Michigan State College of Agriculture and Applied Science (now Michigan State University) in 1928 to be used for research and education. The Sanctuary remains a popular stop for visitors, offering tours, courses and programs to the public year-round. Kellogg Experimental Forest 7060 N. 42nd St., Augusta. Established on abandoned agricultural land in 1932, the 716-acre Forest is known worldwide for research on tree breeding and genetics, planting techniques, and plantation establishment and management. Much of the research that developed the Spartan spruce, a hybrid that combines the color and drought resistance of a blue spruce and the softer needles and rapid growth rate of the white spruce, was done at the Kellogg Forest. The forest is open to the public for biking, hiking, jogging, horseback riding and cross-country skiing and also has more than 15 miles of interpretive trails. Bow hunting, trout fishing and picnicking also are permitted. Gull Lake Library An MSU branch library, also known as the Gull Lake Library, is part of Michigan State University's W.K. Kellogg Biological Station. The Gull Lake Library contains over 12,000 volumes, many of which are bound journal volumes. Nearly 150 current serial titles are received. The collection supports the research interests of KBS faculty, staff, students and visiting scientists in aquatic and terrestrial ecology, evolution, behavior and agro-ecology. The first director of the station, Dr. Walter F. Morofsky, was an entomologist with MSU. Today the library has a strong historical entomology collection. Early Bird Sanctuary research and teaching led to a good waterfowl collection. Once the year round research station was established in 1965, and the branch library was established, a strong research program in limnology was begun, which continues to this day. Currently, there are strong research programs in limnology, microbial ecology, plant ecology, agricultural ecology, fish ecology and vertebrate behavioral ecology.

Shapwick is one of the nine Thankful Villages in Somerset ‚Äî those that suffered no casualties in World War I. Manor The manor of Shapwick originally belonged to Glastonbury Abbey, forming part of its Pouholt (Polden) estate in 729. It was divided into two halves in medieval times. After the Dissolution of the monasteries the manor passed to Thomas Walton and then to the Rolle family. Shapwick House Hotel Shapwick House was built by Sir Henry Rolle in 1630 in place of the original manor house.

It dates from around 1475; originally it was moated but the moat was filled in during the rebuilding by Henry Bull in the first quarter of the 17th century. Shapwick Manor is also a Grade II* listed building. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council‚Äôs operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of Sedgemoor, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Bridgwater Rural District, which is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, highways, public transport, fire service, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. Policing is provided by the Avon and Somerset Constabulary. It is also part of the Bridgwater and West Somerset county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. Geography Shapwick Heath is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest and national nature reserve It is a former raised bog lying in the basin of the River Brue. The site supports a diverse community of terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates. National rarities are the large marsh grasshopper (Stethophyma grossum) found on sphagnum moss bogs, the greater silver diving beetle (Hydrophilus piceus) and the lesser silver diving beetle (Hydrochara caraboides) which is now confined nationally to the Brue Basin Peat Moors. The adjoining Shapwick Moor has been purchased by the Hawk and Owl Trust and will be their first reserve in south west England. The land will be farmed traditionally in order to recreate the habitats of the past. The management plan for the site is being overseen by Natural England. The first steps in the creation of the nature reserve are to reseed the land and then reintroduce Devon ruby red cattle to the site. The priority is to encourage wildlife, not human visitors and there will be no visitor centre or permanent structures, but a public footpath which crosses the site will be improved and hides built along the footpath at key vantage points. Birds identified at the site include: buzzard, sparrowhawk, kestrel, hobby, red kite, barn owl, lapwing, pheasant, cuckoo, woodpecker and skylark. Religious sites The Anglican parish Church of St Mary, which was consecrated in 1331, is an anachronism. Parts of the current building including the piscina and font were moved from an earlier church in fields outside the village. Its central tower is a style that was at least a century out of date. It underwent some alteration in the 15th century, particularly to tower and West end, with further restoration in 1861 by George Gilbert Scott. It has been designated as a Grade II* listed building. Education Shapwick is home to Shapwick School which was founded in 1974 in Glastonbury, but moved into the village in 1984. It is a special school for children aged 8 to 18 with dyslexia. Pupils aged 13 to 18 are based at Shapwick Senior School in the village, while those aged 8 to 12 are based at Shapwick Prep in nearby Burtle. In November 2010, the school was featured in November a BBC Three documentary Kara Tointon: Don't call me stupid about actress Kara Tointon who suffers from dyslexia. Transport Shapwick railway station was a station on the Highbridge branch of the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway. It opened in 1854 and closed in 1966. Notable residents It was the birthplace of Australian politician Henry Strangways in 1832 and Girl Guide leader Joan Marsham in 1888. Churchill Julius, later the first Archbishop of New Zealand, was briefly Vicar of Shapwick in the 1870s. Shapwick in popular culture In 2012, the musician Jon Brookes (aka 'The Advisory Circle' of the Ghost Box record label) released an electronica album entitled 'Shapwick' (on the Clay Pipe record label) based on \\"an imaginary impression of\\" the village and its surrounding countryside, following an unplanned car journey through the area one autumn evening: \\"I felt a certain energy around the place. The images created by the trees in the dark conjured inspiration and it struck me that an album could be based on an imaginary impression of this area. I had already recorded some pieces that were in search of a home and the idea formed within seconds.\\" Shapwick also featured in songwriter Daren Hayman's Thankful Villages project in 2017. Hayman visited each of the 54 villages and recorded songs and interviews with local residents and a short film. The film for Shapwick features Darren performing his song based on the folk tale The Mistletoe Bride in locations around the village. http://thankful-villages.co.uk/ References External links *The Shapwick Project, Somerset: A Rural Landscape Explored (2007) edited by Dr Chris Gerrard and Professor Mick Aston Category:Villages in Sedgemoor Category:Somerset Levels Category:Civil parishes in Somerset ","title":"Shapwick, Somerset"},{"id":"2075410","text":"thumb Morfa Dyffryn beach is on the west coast of Wales, between Barmouth and Harlech in Gwynedd. This sandy beach is several miles long and is chiefly known for having an officially recognised naturist area, in length. The beach is very clean and is also known for regular sightings of dolphins. The nearest settlements are the villages of Dyffryn Ardudwy and Llanbedr where several camp and caravan sites and guest-houses are available. Naturism at Morfa Dyffryn Naturism has been practised at Morfa Dyffryn since the late 1930s. The beach can attract several hundred naturists in summer during fine weather - despite which, it is rarely crowded. Most visitors come from North Wales and North West England, although visitors from mainland Europe are not unknown. In 2000, after complaints from local residents of indecent exposure on other parts of beach and the access footpaths, steps were taken to designate a clearly marked 1 kilometre length of the beach as officially naturist. Although the official designation was resisted by some local residents, complaints of indecent exposure and related behaviour have markedly decreased since 2000. The naturist section of the beach is now clearly marked by signs at both ends. Some naturists complain that the official section is too small - the traditional naturist area was in length. Another complaint by naturists relates to the ban on naturist sunbathing in the sand dunes. Traditionally, most families and heterosexual couples have sunbathed on the beach while most gay men and many single heterosexual men have sunbathed on the dunes. Patrols by the police or beach patrol take place, and usually result in sunbathers being instructed to move down from the dunes onto the beach. The naturist section of the beach is up to 30 minutes' walk from the nearest car parks.

Most simplistically, a mental state is a mental condition. It is a relation that connects the agent with a proposition. Several of these states are a combination of mental representations and propositional attitudes. There are several paradigmatic states of mind that an agent has: love, hate, pleasure and pain, and attitudes toward propositions such as: believing that, conceiving that, hoping and fearing that, etc.  Academia  Discussions about mental states can be found in many areas of study. In cognitive psychology and the philosophy of mind, a mental state is a kind of hypothetical state that corresponds to thinking and feeling, and consists of a conglomeration of mental representations and propositional attitudes. Several theories in philosophy and psychology try to determine the relationship between the agent's mental state and a proposition. Instead of looking into what a mental state is, in itself, clinical psychology and psychiatry determine a person's mental health through a mental status examination.  Epistemology  Mental states also include attitudes towards propositions, of which there are at least two‚Äîfactive, non-factive, both of which entail the mental state of acquaintance. To be acquainted with a proposition is to understand its meaning and be able to entertain it. The proposition can be true or false, and acquaintance requires no specific attitude towards that truth or falsity. Factive attitudes include those mental states that are attached to the truth of the proposition‚Äîi.e. the proposition entails truth. Some factive mental states include \\"perceiving that\\", \\"remembering that\\", \\"regretting that\\", and (more controversially) \\"knowing that\\". Non-factive attitudes do not entail the truth of the propositions to which they are attached. That is, one can be in one of these mental states and the proposition can be false. An example of a non-factive attitude is believing‚Äîpeople can believe a false proposition and people can believe a true proposition. Since there is the possibility of both, such mental states do not entail truth, and therefore, are not factive. However, belief does entail an attitude of assent toward the presumed truth of the proposition (whether or not it's so), making it and other non-factive attitudes different than mere acquaintance.

The title means Malagasy Adventure in English. There are conflicting reports as to the true inspiration for the film, lawyer Jules Fran√ßois Clermont or actor Claude Dauphin. Some sources claim the film is based on the real-life activities of Jules Fran√ßois Clermont, who wrote and starred in the film under the name \\"Paul Clarus\\". In September 2011, The Daily Telegraph published an article noting that writer and actor Claude Dauphin had collaborated with Hitchcock to recount his own experiences of operating an underground radio station in Nazi occupied France.  Plot summary  Paul Clarus, a French actor (played by \\"Paul Clarus\\") is chatting with his fellow actors (the \\"Moli√®re Players\\") as they put on their makeup before a performance. He reminisces about a very unpleasant Vichy official, the Chef de la S√ªret√©, (Paul Bonifas) that he knew when he was part of the Resistance on the island of Madagascar during the Second World War. The events on Madagascar are shown in flashback. Paul Clarus pretended to be loyal to the Vichy official, while he simultaneously worked as the head of the Resistance movement. He ran an illegal pro-Resistance radio station \\"Madagascar Libre\\", and helped arrange numerous boats to take loyal Frenchmen out of the island to safety. Finally when the Vichy government falls, we see that the Vichy official is nothing but a turncoat; in his office he rapidly replaces a portrait of Marshal Philippe P√©tain with a portrait of Queen Victoria, and he changes his bottle of Vichy water for bottles of Scotch and soda water.

He was the eldest son of Sancho II of Pamplona and Urraca Fern√°ndez and the second Pamplonese monarch to also hold the title of count of Aragon. Modern historians refer to him as the Tremulous, though this appellation likely originally applied to his grandfather, Garc√≠a S√°nchez I of Pamplona.  Biography  Throughout his reign, his foreign policy seems to have been closely linked to that of Castile. His mother was an aunt of count Sancho Garc√≠a of Castile, and also of the powerful count of Salda√±a, Garc√≠a G√≥mez of Carri√≥n, and she appears to have played a role in forming a bridge between the kingdom and county. He joined his cousin Sancho in attempting to break from the submission his father had offered to C√≥rdoba, as a result of which he had to face Almanzor. In 996 he was forced to seek peace in C√≥rdoba. In 997 during an expedition into the land of Calatayud, Garc√≠a killed the governor's brother. Almanzor took revenge by beheading 50 Christians. At the Battle of Cervera in July 1000, he joined, along with count Garc√≠a G√≥mez of Salda√±a, in a coalition headed by count Sancho Garc√≠a of Castile that was defeated by Almanzor (that count Sancho led the group is thought to reflect Garc√≠a's decline). Tradition names him one of the Christian leaders at the 1002 Battle of Calata√±azor, which resulted in the death of Almanzor and the consequent crisis in the Caliphate of C√≥rdoba, but there is no contemporary record of him after 1000, while his cousin Sancho Ram√≠rez of Viguera may have been ruling in Pamplona in 1002. Garc√≠a was certainly dead by 1004, when his son Sancho Garc√©s III first appears as king. Domestically, he granted the rule in Aragon to his brother Gonzalo, under the tutelage of his mother Urraca. A tradition reports that he freed all of the Muslim captives being held in the kingdom.  Marriage and children  Garc√≠a S√°nchez II was married to Jimena Fern√°ndez, daughter of Fernando Berm√∫dez, Count of Cea and a distinguished member of the highest ranks of the nobility of the Kingdom of Le√≥n. They had the following children: * Sancho Garc√©s III, King of Navarre and Count of Aragon from 1004 until his death in 1035. * Elvira Garc√©s, nun in the Monastery of Leyre. * Garc√≠a Garc√©s * Urraca Garc√©s, Queen consort of Le√≥n by her marriage to Alfonso V of Le√≥n from 1023 until her death in 1031.

The species primarily feeds on plant material and typically nests in large groups on beaches. Due to hunting of adults, collecting of their eggs, pollution, habitat loss, and dams, the Arrau turtle is seriously threatened. Range and habitat Arrau turtles are found in the Amazon, Orinoco and Essequibo basins in Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela and Guyana. On occasion, typically after floods, individuals turn up in Trinidad. They are found in deep rivers, ponds, freshwater lagoons and flooded forest in white-, black- and clear-water. Appearance Adult at Krefeld Zoo, Germany Arrau turtles can reach up to in weight and the carapace length is up to . Most individuals are considerably smaller with the average adult female having a carapace length of and the average adult male . In addition to an overall smaller size, males can be recognized by their longer tail and straighter carapace than the females. Arrau turtles are brown, gray or olive-green, but the exact color varies depending on the algae growing on the carapace. Behavior =Feeding= Adult Arrau turtles feed almost entirely on plant material such as fruits, seeds, leaves and algae, but may also take freshwater sponges, eggs and carcasses of dead animals. Captives have been recorded feeding on meat. Juveniles feed on fish and plant material. The species is mainly active during the day. =Breeding and life cycle= Young in Venezuela When nearing the breeding season, Arrau turtles migrate to certain sites where the eggs are laid. In some locations nesting occurs in large groups on beaches, which reduces the risk posed by predators. Some beaches have as many as 500 nesting females. Mating occurs in the water. During and just before the nesting season the species frequently basks, typically in groups. It is suspected that the additional heat accelerates the ovulation in the females. At other times the species is generally not found on land. When on land, it is usually very shy and retreats to the water at the slightest hint of danger. The female lays an average of 75‚Äì123 eggs (average varies depending on region), which are placed during the night in a deep nest that is dug on the beach. The eggs are laid during the low water season and hatch as the water starts to rise. If it rises too fast or too early, the nest is flooded and the young die within the eggs. As long as nests are not dug up by predators, the hatching success rate is usually high, averaging at 83%. The eggs hatch after about 50 days and the sex of the young depends on the nest temperature (females at higher temperatures, males at lower). When hatching, the young are around long and dart directly for the water, but they emerge to the attentions of many predators so that only about five percent ever reach the adult feeding grounds.The Simon and Schuster Encyclopedia of Animals When hatching, the females emit sounds which attract the young; they stay together for a period in the flooded forests. Vocalizations appear to play an important role in the social life of this turtle and in addition to the \\"connect to newly hatched young\\" sound, four primary sounds have been documented during the nesting season: one used during migration, one before basking, one when nesting at night and finally one when in the water after nesting. They can reach an age of 20 years or more in the wild, and captives have lived for at least 25 years. Based on certain scientific models it has been estimated that the largest individuals perhaps are as old as 80 years. Conservation status Facility for raising Arrau turtles in Venezuela The Arrau turtle is widespread and was not considered threatened overall by the IUCN in 1996 (the year of the last full review), but it has declined drastically, and a draft review by the IUCN Species Survival Commission‚ÄîTortoise and Freshwater Turtle Specialist Group in 2011 recommended that it should be considered critically endangered. The species is slow to mature; some have suggested that females reach maturity when 4‚Äì8 years old and other when about 17 years old. Their social behavior, especially at certain nesting beaches, makes them and their eggs vulnerable to humans. In addition to being used for food, they are sometimes used in traditional medicine. At the main known nesting beaches, it is estimated that the number of nests fell from 34,000 in 1963 to 4,700 in 1981. In the middle Orinoco River alone, it is estimated that as many as 330,000 nested in 1800, but less than half this number nested in 1945 and by the early 2000s (decade) it had fallen to 700‚Äì1300. In addition to hunting and collecting of their eggs, threats include pollution, habitat loss, and dams, which can cause flooding of nest sites. Several countries in their range have implemented laws protecting the species, but hunting and egg collection (even if illegal) continues. A number of conservation projects have been initiated. For example, 54 nesting beaches have been protected in Brazil, beaches used by more than 1,000 females are protected in Colombia, and since the mid-1990s many thousand eggs have been collected in Venezuela for safe incubation, the hatchlings \\"headstarted\\" (getting them through the most dangerous period) and then released. All species in the genus Podocnemis are listed on CITES Appendix II. The slow growth limits its potential for major commercial turtle farming. Nevertheless, about 880,000 turtles of various species were kept at 92 farms (both ones that are commercial and ones with conservation purpose) in 2004 in Brazil alone, and some of these keep Arrau turtles, also in semi-intensive farm systems.

He served as a ship's engineer during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, and after the war did experimental work with steam propulsion. Rising to the rank of rear admiral, as Engineer-in-Chief of the Navy during the Civil War, he helped to found the Navy's Bureau of Steam Engineering. Career in civilian engineering Isherwood was born in New York City. He worked for the Utica and Schenectady Railroad and trained under William C. Young, one of the most prominent engineers of that period. Isherwood then worked on the Croton Aqueduct, followed by an engineering job on the Erie Canal. Designing and constructing lighthouses for the Treasury Department was Isherwood's last employment before joining the Navy. Early Naval career At the age of 22, Isherwood was appointed first assistant engineer in the Navy May 23, 1844, serving aboard from 1846 to 1847. During the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, he served on the , and later was senior engineer of the . When the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War ended, Isherwood was assigned to the Washington Navy Yard, where he assisted Charles Stuart in designing engines and experiments with steam as a source of power for propelling ships. Throughout the 1850s, Isherwood compiled operational and performance data from steam engines in American and foreign commercial vessels and warships. He used these empirical data to analyze the efficiency of engine types then in use. In the twelve years between the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War and the Civil War, Isherwood published 55 technical and scientific articles on steam engineering and vessel propulsion in the prestigious Journal of the Franklin Institute. In 1859 the engineer published the results of his own original thermodynamic experiments in the two-volume Engineering Precedents for Steam Machinery. Isherwood was the nation's most prolific antebellum technical writer. Isherwood went to sea during the period between the wars, serving as Chief Engineer of the steam frigate on a cruise of more than three years on the Asiatic Station. During this cruise he was stricken with dysentery, prompting his return to the United States. Civil War Shortly after the outbreak of the Civil War, Isherwood was appointed Engineer-in-Chief of the Navy, and so important were his services considered that the Bureau of Steam Engineering was created under his direction. When the Civil War began, the Navy had 28 steam vessels, and during the war, the number grew to 600. Isherwood conducted the design and construction of the machinery necessary to accomplish this. He designed ships that were fast enough to pursue the blockade runners. In 1863 and 1865, Isherwood published the first and second volumes of Experimental Researches in Steam Engineering, which were translated into six languages and became a standard engineering text upon which future steam experimentation was based. Post-war activities Immediately upon the conclusion of the war, Isherwood was principally involved with organizing a new scientific curriculum for steam engineering at the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis. By 1874, naval engineers refined this curriculum to the point that it served as the model for mechanical engineering education at most American universities. In 1869 Isherwood ran afoul of former shipmate Admiral David Dixon Porter. During the war years Isherwood led a campaign to increase the rank and influence of engineering officers in the navy. Porter opposed this change in the service's class structure. After the presidential inauguration of Ulysses S. Grant, Isherwood's longtime patron, Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles, could no longer protect him. Admiral Porter banished Isherwood to the Mare Island Navy Yard in San Francisco. Despite his diminished stature, Isherwood continued to produce technical innovations. In 1870 and 1871, Isherwood conducted experiments that resulted in a propeller that was used by the Navy for the next 27 years. He was a pioneer in the production of fast cruisers, producing this class against strong opposition. Following a tour of European dockyards, he became president of the Experimental Board under the Bureau of Steam Engineering until his retirement on October 6, 1884. Isherwood died in New York City at the age of 92. Legacy The Navy has recognized Isherwood's contributions in various ways. Isherwood Hall, built in 1905 on the campus of the United States Naval Academy, was the home of the Department of Marine Engineering. It was razed in 1982 to make space for the Academy's new Alumni Hall. Isherwood's name lives on as the new hall's Isherwood Entrance. The Rear Admiral Benjamin F. Isherwood Award is awarded by the Navy to recognize \\"innovation and expertise in the effective assessment, development, execution, or deployment of technological solutions for operational Fleet needs.\\" Three U.S. Navy ships ‚Äì two destroyers named and the never-finished fleet replenishment oiler ‚Äì have been named for him. In a 1941 article in the United States Naval Institute's Proceedings, George W. Dyson stated that Isherwood might possibly be the greatest engineer the United States Navy had developed. The revolutionary engineering program initiated by Isherwood at the U.S. Naval Academy became the template for professional American mechanical engineering education. That basic curriculum designed at Annapolis in the late 1860s and early 1870s still serves as the core of university mechanical engineering pedagogy.

The line operated the ship until it was requisitioned by the War Shipping Administration (WSA) the last day of 1941 for service as a troop transport. The line then operated the ship as agent for the WSA until 6 May 1944 when operation was transferred to the United States Army for support of the Normandy landings with the ship arriving off the beaches on 7 June 1944. Borinquen continued service post war until redelivered to the owners 14 June 1946. The ship was sold in 1949 and became the Arosa Star. After further sales and change in the cruise ship regulations the ship was again sold and grounded as La Jenelle on the California coast in 1970. Construction Borinquen, designed by Theodore E. Ferris, was laid down at the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation's Fore River Shipyard in Quincy, Massachusetts 20 January 1930, launched 24 September 1930 and completed in 1931 with delivery 20 February 1931. The ship's name comes from the Taino language name, Borik√©n, for the island of Puerto Rico. Borinquen was delivered to the Atlantic, Gulf & West Indies Steamship Lines (AGWI) for operation by AGWI's subsidiary, New York & Porto Rico Line. Borinquen was similar in characteristics and design to the line's earlier ship, SS Coamo (1925) with the Lloyd's Register, 1930‚Äì31 showing the ship as ordered for the New York & Porto Rico Steamship Company with an original date of 1930, both stricken, with a new date 1931 and \\"Coamo S.S. Corp\\" with New York & Porto Rico Steamship Company as manager.Ship ownership may be a separate entity, for example a holding company, and \\"Coamo S.S. Corp\\" may have been such a holding company associated with AGWI. The ship was propelled by single, impulse- reaction type, reduction geared turbines furnished with steam by oil fired tube boilers for about 6,500 horsepower. Commercial operation The ship arrived in New York 22 February 1931 and began her working career with a maiden voyage from New York to San Juan, Puerto Rico and Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic which would become her regular scheduled route. World War II operation During World War II she was requisitioned from Agwilines, Inc. by the War Shipping Administration on 31 December 1941 with Agwilines as the operator. On 6 May 1944 Borinquen was transferred to direct War Department operation by the Transportation Corps under bareboat charter as the USAT Borinquen until returned to Agwilines 14 June 1946. She had a capacity for 1,289 troops and 404 medical patients. USAT Borinquen was one of the Army transports at Normandy. Beginning on 15 January 1942 the ship's operations centered on the North Atlantic with overseas ports in Iceland and Scotland until 10 May, when she departed Scotland for Freetown and began a period of operation involving African ports. In June she began a voyage from Cape Town to Aden and Suez before returning to West African operations. After a return to New York on 10 August she began operations beginning in November from Belfast and Liverpool involving North Africa and Britain with Oran, Casablanca and Algiers as usual ports before making port in Palermo, Sicily on 31 July 1943. After a return to New York on 22 August 1943 operations were between ports in the United States and Britain until on 5 June she departed Swansea, with the destination being listed as Port en Bessin, France, that was the arrival off Normandy invasion beaches on 7 June 1944. She made one more trip to Belfast, returning to Grandcamp, France, 9 July before beginning a shuttle service largely between Belfast and Liverpool until a return to New York 25 October 1944. After departure from New York 3 January 1945 she again began a routine shuttle between Southampton and Le Havre until a run to Marseille in August and a return to New York on 31 August 1945. Sale and subsequent names On 25 April 1949, she was sold to the Bull Steamship Company and renamed the Puerto Rico. In 1954 she was purchased by the Arosa Line (Compa√±√≠a Internacional Transportadora ‚Äì owned by Nicolo Rizzi, a Swiss-Italian financier) and operated as the extensively rebuilt Arosa Star until 1958.Cruising the Past As the Arosa Star she was the third largest ship of the Arosa Line, a Swiss cruise line, operating in the mid-1950s. The 2 larger ships in the fleet were the flagship Arosa Sky, and the older Arosa Sun ‚Äì originally the French-built liner Felix Roussel. Then came the Arosa Star, with Arosa Kulm bringing up the rear. The Arosa Star was a ship which traveled several different routes, with many crew on board. At one time Kurt Ebberg was master, Alex Von Blessingh was first officer, Ernest Kuehne was chief engineer, Karl Nahrath was chief purser, and Hasso Wolf was the doctor of the ship. During at least part of this period, she transported immigrants from northern Europe to Canada and the United States, with regular ports of call at Halifax, Quebec City, Montreal and New York City. With the advent of affordable air travel, the market for hauling immigrants quickly disappeared and the Arosa Line went bankrupt. In the years 1959‚Äì69, she was operated for Eastern Steamship Lines as the Bahama Star, sailing primarily between Florida and the Bahamas. During this period, the Bahama Star managed to rescue 489 people from the burning SS Yarmouth Castle, another cruise ship; 90 people perished in the blaze. In an ironic twist of fate, this accident led to changes to the maritime regulations pertaining to such ships at the Geneva Convention of 1964, outlawing the operation of passenger vessels with wooden super-structures. The cost of complying with the new regulations proved too expensive, so the ship was sold to the Western Steamship Company. She was renamed again, this time to La Jenelle. The new owners brought her to Port Hueneme, California, where they intended to sell her. Some say that plans were underway to make her a floating restaurant/casino. Others claim she was to be sold to an Indonesian shipping firm, but neither plan materialized. By 1970, she was anchored outside the harbor to avoid expensive docking fees while efforts were made to find a buyer. On April 13, her luck ran out. That particular day was blustery, with a northwest gale ripping the tops off the waves. Seas broke everywhere, and nearly everyone was in port. La Jenelles starboard anchor ‚Äì the only one out ‚Äì began to drag. There were only two crewmen aboard, and they were unable to stop her drift. Only 23 minutes later, she struck the sandy beach west of the Port Hueneme breakwater, her stern just missing the rocks. La Jenelle began to list as she took on water. The crew stayed aboard, attempting to pump her dry so she could be righted, but the seas were pouring in from many smashed portholes and windows making their efforts fruitless. A helicopter arrived to rescue them as the ship settled further into the sand.La Janelle The La Jenelle proved to be quite an attraction. Crowds flocked to Silver Strand Beach to see the stranded behemoth. Surfers paddled out to the stricken ship to wander among passageways canted at impossible angles, reminiscent of the film, Poseidon Adventure. Salvers picked over her bones, tearing away loose brass hardware and anything else of value. Her plates began to buckle under the incessant pounding of the surf as one compartment after another was destroyed. A fire, perhaps started by vandals, gutted her interior. La Jenelle became a real hazard in time, for it was impossible to keep people off her. Eventually a souvenir hunter fell from the wreck and was drowned. By then, the owners had faded from the scene during the litigation that follows such an incident. A United States Navy team cut the top off the ship and brought in rocks to fill in the carcass. La Jenelle was transformed into a new arm for the Port of Hueneme breakwater.Wreck site  Notes   See also  *The violent history of Arosa Sky alias Bianca C. *Arosa Kulm  References  Bibliography * *  External links  * Borinquen * Porto Rico Line (New York & Porto Rico Steamship Co.) * The USAT Borinquen and its Voyages * Arosa Star Promo * Life on Arosa Star 1957 *Los Angeles Times photo archive of shipwreck Category:1930 ships Category:Troop ships of the War Shipping Administration Category:Transport ships of the United States Army Category:Cruise ships Category:Maritime incidents in 1970 Category:Maritime incidents in the United States Category:Shipwrecks of the California coast ","title":"Borinquen (1930)"},{"id":"2075510","title":"Art Gallery of New South Wales"},{"id":"2075511","text":"This is a list of United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan species.

producer best known for being the founder of the metal opera project Avantasia and singer and primary songwriter of the power metal band Edguy. Sammet founded Edguy in 1992 with schoolmates. Under the musical influence of AC/DC, Freddie Mercury (Queen), and Helloween, the typical power metal sound of his band, in which he mainly acts as a singer and frontman, emerged. After several tours and chart placements with Edguy, Sammet founded his all-star project Avantasia and released a metal opera under this name. Initially planned as a once-in-a-lifetime studio project, he launched Avantasia again in 2006 and since then he regularly produced concept albums and rock operas. When he was offered the evening program of the main stage with Avantasia at the Wacken Open Air in 2008, he decided to put his side project on stage. Since then, he has regularly toured North and South America, Asia and Europe with Edguy and Avantasia. He made guest appearances on Rob Rock's album Holy Hell, on the metal opera Aina, and on Revolution Renaissance's New Era album, besides others. In 2011, readers of the Japanese Burrn Magazine ranked him best songwriter after he had released the two albums The Wicked Symphony and Angel Of Babylon simultaneously. The albums featured guest appearances by Klaus Meine, Eric Singer, Jon Oliva and Michael Kiske and contained 21 songs that had been solely written by Tobias. During a headliner show of the band Edguy at the Bang Your Head Festival in 2012, Sammet fell off the stage and broke his nose and several ribs.

In the summer of 1281, the Yuan invaded with two large armies. The Japanese defenders were aided by a major storm which sunk a sizeable portion of the Mongolian fleets. The invaders who reached the shore were repulsed shortly after landing. The Japanese called the opportune storm kamikaze (\\"divine wind\\"), a name later used in the Second World War for pilots who carried out aerial suicide attacks. Background After the failed first invasion by the Yuan navy, the Japanese made many defense preparations, constructing numerous fortifications along the coast. Armies of samurai trained in swordsmanship were kept in a state of readiness to repel a further attack. In early 1280 Kublai Khan planned another invasion of Japan and ordered his shipbuilders to rebuild the whole fleet within a year. In the short time available many of the ships were poorly made; many were flat-bottomed river boats requisitioned by the Emperor. Battle By June 1281, 900 Yuan ships were gathered in Korea; the force was called the Eastern Route Army. They were crewed by 17,000 sailors, and transported 10,000 Korean soldiers and 15,000 Mongols and Chinese. The Southern Route Army, meanwhile, was assembled just south of the Yangtze River, in China. It is said to have consisted of 100,000 men on 3,500 ships. As before, Iki and Tsushima islands fell quickly to the much larger Yuan forces. The Eastern Route Army arrived at Hakata Bay on June 23, and decided to proceed with the invasion without waiting for the larger Southern force which had still not left China. They were a short distance to the north and east of where their force had landed in 1274, and were in fact beyond the walls and defenses constructed by the Japanese. The samurai responded quickly, assaulting the invaders with waves of defenders, denying them the beachhead. At night small boats carried small bands of samurai into the Yuan fleet in the bay. Under cover of darkness they boarded enemy ships, killed as many as they could, and withdrew before dawn. This harassing tactic led the Yuan forces to retreat to Tsushima, where they would wait for the Southern Route Army. However, over the course of the next several weeks, 3,000 men were killed in close quarters combat in the hot weather. Yuan forces never gained a beachhead. The first of the Southern force ships arrived on July 16, and by August 12 the two fleets were ready to attack Japan. On August 15 a major tempest struck the Tsushima Straits, lasting two full days and destroying most of the Yuan fleet. Contemporary Japanese accounts indicate that over 4,000 ships were destroyed in the storm; 80% of the Yuan soldiers either drowned or were killed by samurai on the beaches. The loss of ships was so great that \\"a person could walk across from one point of land to another on a mass of wreckage\\".Winters, pp. 14‚Äì15 Main battles of the K≈çan Campaign = Battle of Tsushima Island ‚Äì Japanese victory = On June 8, the Mongolian Army landed on Tsushima island and invaded.

It was conceived of by an Ogivly & Mather NYC advertising employee and introduced in 1997 by Post Cereals. In 2001 the cereal got a new recipe with real creme filling.Spokesman.com  Archives A variation of Oreo O's called Extreme Creme Taste Oreo O's contained Oreo filling-flavored marshmallows. The cereal was launched in 1997Pioneer Press: Search Results and discontinued in 2007 everywhere outside South Korea. In May 2017, Post Cereals announced that it would restart production of Oreo O's starting June 23 and continue production indefinitely. Advertising Several advertisements were run on television for Oreo O's during the late 1990s and early 2000s. The variation Extreme Cr√®me Oreo O's had its own television commercial starring the \\"Cr√©me Team,\\" a troupe of humanoid marshmallows sporting sunglasses, in 2001. The advertisement promoted the Extreme Cr√®me Oreo O's variation as more chocolatey in taste and creamier.  Discontinuation  The cereal was a joint product from Post Cereals and Kraft Foods, which allowed both companies to share the rights, distribution and profits after 1997. The cereal was very successful when it came to sales, and parental approval as a suitable breakfast food. In 2007, both companies ceased co-branding, which made the cereal impossible to produce. Kraft foods owned the copyrights to the name Oreo, yet Post owned the copyrights to the cereal recipe itself. Neither company wished to relinquish either rights; therefore forcing the cereal to become discontinued worldwide.  International availability  Due to an international loop hole with the rights of Oreo O's, they were only produced and available in South Korea, with boxes of the product being available for international purchase on eBay from third-party sellers for well over $10. Korean food manufacturer Dongsuh Foods was established as a joint venture of General Foods and Dongsuh Companies Inc., and had distribution rights to produce Post Foods cereals in Korea. When Kraft Foods acquired General Foods, half of Dongsuh Foods' stock automatically became property of Kraft, thus making Dongsuh Foods the only company with both licenses required to make Post Foods and Oreo O's. The product was recalled in 2014 due to Dongsuh having intentionally diluted E. coli-contaminated product with normal product.SBS CNBC, ÎèôÏÑúÏãùÌíà 'ÎåÄÏû•Í∑† ÏãúÎ¶¨Ïñº' ÏïåÍ≥†ÎèÑ Ïû¨ÌåêÎß§‚Ä¶ÎªîÎªîÌï® Ïñ¥ÎîîÍπåÏßÄ? ,2014-10-14ÎèôÏÑúÏãùÌíà, ÎåÄÏû•Í∑† Í≤ÄÏ∂ú ÏãúÎ¶¨Ïñº ÏÉà Ï†úÌíàÏóê ÏÑûÏñ¥ ÌåêÎß§, Íµ≠ÎØºÏùºÎ≥¥ 2014-10-14ÎåÄÏû•Í∑† ÏãúÎ¶¨Ïñº Ïû¨ÌôúÏö©, ÎèôÏÑúÏãùÌíà ÏûÖÏû• Îì§Ïñ¥Î≥¥Îãà‚Ä¶ Ìï¥Îü¥ÎìúÍ≤ΩÏ†ú 2014-10-14. In September 2016, Dongsuh resumed selling Oreo O's within South Korea when it spun off from General Foods.  Experimental off-brand and worldwide return  In early 2017, a subsidiary company of Post, Malt-O-Meal Cereals, continued selling the cereal in the United States as a market test. The only differences were that the marshmallows from the 2001 version were not included, the cereal contained artificial flavors and it did not use the Oreo name for licensing reasons. Instead, the cereal was called \\"Cookies & Cream\\" and was sold in bags in many Walmart stores. Due to high sales and a marketing deal made by Walmart, Post announced that Nabisco would once again co-brand the cereal. Soon afterward, Oreo O's were re-released with their original 1997 recipe worldwide as a Walmart Exclusive Product, including the United States on June 23. As of 2018, the cereal was available to all grocery stores. On June 17, 2019, Walmart started selling the cereal with the marshmallows from the 2001 recipe as an exclusive product. Instead of being labeled \\"Extreme Cr√©me Oreo O's\\", it was labeled \\"Mega Stuf Oreo O's\\".

It purports to contain secret prophecies Moses revealed to Joshua before passing leadership of the Israelites to him. It contains apocalyptic themes, but is characterized as a \\"testament\\", meaning it has the final speech of a dying person, Moses.  Manuscript history  The Assumption of Moses is known from a single sixth- century incomplete manuscript in Latin that was discovered by Antonio Ceriani in the Biblioteca Ambrosiana in Milan in the mid-nineteenth century and published by him in 1861.Manuscript \\"C. 73 inf\\" published by A. Ceriani with the title of Fragmenta Assumptionis Mosis in Monumenta sacra et profana 1,1, Milano 1861 pag 55-66 Identification The two titles of this manuscript are due to different identifications with lost texts. The Stichometry of Nicephorus and some other ancient lists refer to both a Testament of Moses and an Assumption of Moses, apparently as separate texts. *Ceriani, and later Tromp with him, identified the manuscript with the Assumption of Moses (which is also called the Ascension of Moses) due to a match of verse 1:14 with a quotation included in the Historia Ecclesiastica of Gelasius of Cyzicus.verse 2,17,17 critical edition: G.C. Hansen, Gelasius Anonyme Kirchengeschichte (hansen) Gcs Nf 9 pag 58 This apocryphal work, entitled ◊§◊ò◊ô◊®◊™ ◊û◊©◊î in Hebrew, and ·æΩŒëŒΩŒ¨ŒªŒ∑œàŒπœÇ or ·æΩŒëŒΩŒ¨Œ≤Œ±œÉŒπœÇ ŒúœâœÖœÉŒ≠œâœÇ in Greek, is also mentioned by other ancient writers, including Athanasius (in his Synopsis Sacr√¶ Scriptur√¶) and Origen; *Charles, in his edition of 1897R.H Charles The Assumption of Moses, Translated from the Latin Sixth Century MS., the Unemended Text of Which Is Published Herewith, Together with the Text in Its Restored and Critically Emended Form, London 1897 suggests that the manuscript shall be identified with the Testament of Moses because the extant text does not describe any assumption of Moses to heaven, but simply contains the last exhortations of Moses (thus his testament). Charles furthermore suggests that these two separate texts were later united to form a single work. Relation to the Epistle of Jude Some ancient writers, including Gelasius (verse 2,21,17) and Origen (De principiis, III,2,1), cite the Assumption of Moses with reference to the dispute over the body of Moses, referred to in the Epistle of Jude , between the archangel Michael and the devil. This dispute does not appear in Ceriani's manuscript; this could lend support to the identification of the manuscript with the Testament of Moses, but could also be explained by the text's incompleteness (it is believed that about a third of the text is missing). An alternative explanation is that Jude is compounding material from three sources: * general Jewish traditions about Michael as gravedigger for the just as in the Apocalypse of Moses * contrast with the accusation by Michael of Azazel in the Book of Enoch * contrast with the angel of the Lord not rebuking Satan over the body of Joshua the High Priest in Zechariah 3. This explanation has in its favour three arguments: (1) Jude quotes from both 1 Enoch 1:9 and Zechariah 3. (2) Jeshua in Zechariah 3 is dead - his grandson is serving as high priest. The change from \\"body of Jesus\\" (Greek spelling of Jeshua) to \\"body of Moses\\" would be required to avoid confusion with Jesus, and also to reflect the historical context of Zech. 3 in Nehemiah concerning intermarriage and corruption in the \\"body\\" of the priesthood. (3) The example of Zech. 3 provides an argument against the \\"slandering of heavenly beings\\", since the Angel of the Lord does not do in Zech. 3 what Michael is reported to do in 1En1.2 Peter, Jude - Neyrey, Jerome H. - Yale University Press 1995Carol L. Meyers, Haggai, Zechariah 1-8 Anchor Bible Series, Vol. 2:5B 1987 Content The text is in twelve chapters: * In Chapter 1 Moses, before dying, chooses Joshua as successor and leaves him the books he shall preserve to the end of days, when the Lord will visit his people. The role of Moses as mediator is highlighted. * Chapters 2‚Äì5 contain a brief outline of Jewish history up to Hellenization under Antiochus IV. This is narrated in the form of foretelling. * Chapter 6 predicts easily recognizable figures, including the Hasmonean and Herod the Great with his sons. The history follows up to the partial destruction of the Temple.Probably it refers to the event narrated in Bell 2,5,1 happened in 4 BCE, but there is not consensus among scholars * Chapter 7 is about the end of days, but the manuscript is too fragmented to fully understand the text. * Chapter 8 narrates a great persecution of Jews at the hands of hypocrites. Some scholars read this as an eschatological prophecy, while others, like Charles, interpret this as events that happened before the Maccabee rebellion. Charles also suggests that chapters 8 and 9 were originally located between chapters 5 and 6. * In Chapter 9 the narrative follows with a description of a Levite man named Taxo and his seven sons, who, rather than give in to hellenizing influences, seal themselves into a cave. * Chapter 10 contains an eschatological hymn: At the end of the times God will arise, punish the Gentiles, and exalt Israel. Before the coming of God a messenger (Latin nuntius)The nuntius is usually identified with Michael, with an interesting parallel in 11QMelch with sacerdotal tasks is prophesied, who will avenge Israel. * Chapters 11 and 12 conclude the text with Moses exhorting Joshua not to fear, as history fully provides for God's covenant and plan. Date, original language and themes Due to the vaticinia ex eventu, most scholars date the work to the early 1st century AD, contemporary with the latest historical figures it describes. Some others,for example J. Licht Taxo, or the Apocalyptic Doctrine of Venegance JJS 12 p. 95-103 (1961) or G. Nickelsburg however, date it to the previous century and suggest that the 1st- century references in Chapters 6 and 10 were later insertions. Based on the literal translation of idioms within the text, it is generally accepted that the extant Latin version is a translation from Koine Greek, with the Greek itself probably a translation from Hebrew or at least a text with considerable Semitic influence. There are no theological peculiarities to help us attribute the text to any specific Jewish group. * The main theme is the apocalyptic determinism of a history that unfolds according only to God's plan, regardless of the acts of either the Israelites or the Gentiles. Another theme is the figure of Moses, who is shown as a mediator and intercessor between God and humanity. *The dispute mentioned between the Archangel Michael and the Devil does not suit itself to the doctrinal views of the Sadducees since they denied the existence of angels. (Acts 23:8 states this clearly.) Pharisees or some other Jewish group may have had ties to this document. * finds the most striking feature in this work to be the writer's scathing condemnation of the priesthood before, during, and after the Maccabean period and an unsparing deprecation of the Temple services.

A usage common among Marxist activist groups (\\"historical ultra-left\\" below) is as a generally pejorative term for certain types of positions on the far-left that are extreme or uncompromising. Another definition historically refers to a particular current of Marxist communism, in which the Communist International repudiated social democratic parties (and all other progressive groupings outside of the Communist Party). Pejoratively, ultra-left is often used by Marxists against other socialists, communists, and anarchists within far-left parties who advocate strategies which some Marxists may consider to be without regard of the current political consciousness or of the long-term consequences that would result from following a proposed course. Ultra-leftism within and outside the Communist International was evident in periods when political groupings pursued council communism and left communism.  Historical ultra- left  The term ultra-left is rarely used in English. Instead, people tend to speak broadly of left communism as a variant of traditional Marxism. The French equivalent, ultra-gauche, has a stronger meaning in that language and is used to define a movement that still exists today: a branch of left communism developed by theorists such as Amadeo Bordiga, Otto R√ºhle, Anton Pannekoek, Herman Gorter, and Paul Mattick, and continuing with more recent writers, such as Jacques Camatte and Gilles Dauv√©. This standpoint includes two main traditions, a Dutch-German tradition including R√ºhle, Pannekoek, Gorter, and Mattick, and an Italian tradition following Bordiga. These traditions came together in the 1960s French ultra-gauche.\\"Bring Out Your Dead\\", Endnotes 1, 2008 The political theorist Nicholas Thoburn refers to these traditions as the \\"actuality of... the historical ultra-left\\".Nicholas Thoburn \\"Do not be afraid, join us, come back? On the \\"idea of communism\\" in our time\\" Cultural Critique Number 84, Spring 2013, pp. 1-34 The term originated in the 1920s in the German and Dutch workers movements, originally referring to a Marxist group opposed to both Bolshevism and social democracy, and with some affinities with anarchism.Philippe Bourrinet The Dutch and German Communist Left (1900‚Äì68): 'Neither Lenin nor Trotsky nor Stalin!' ‚Äì 'All Workers Must Think for Themselves!', BRILL, 8 Dec 2016, p. 8: \\"As for the term 'ultra-left', which is often equated with 'sectarianism', it can only define those currents which historically split from the KPD between 1925 and 1927. Left communism never appeared as a pure will to be 'as left as possible'.\\" The ultra-left is defined particularly by its breed of anti- authoritarian Marxism, which generally involves an opposition to the state and to state socialism, as well as to parliamentary democracy and wage labour. In opposition to Bolshevism, the ultra-left generally places heavy emphasis upon the autonomy and self-organization of the proletariat. As Dauv√© put it: > The ultra-left was born and grew in opposition to Social Democracy and > Leninism‚Äîwhich had become Stalinism. Against them, it affirmed the > revolutionary spontaneity of the proletariat.

During the May 1968 events in France, ultra-leftism was initially associated with the opposition and critique to the French Communist Party (PCF) and its cautious, relatively disengaged approach to the mobilizations. Ultra-leftism was thus used by the established currents of the communist movement to prevent, sometimes correctly, against \\"self-indulgent ultra-leftism [that] could only make it more difficult for the revolutionary left to win rank and file PCF members away from their leaders‚Ä≥.Ian Birchall \\"The Left and May 68\\", Socialist Worker Review, N. 109, May 1988  Ultra-leftism within the Marxist movement  Used pejoratively, ultra-left is used to label positions that are adopted without taking notice of the current situation or of the consequences which would result from following a proposed course. The term is used to criticize leftist positions that, for example, are seen as overstating the tempo of events, propose initiatives that overestimate the current level of militancy, or which employ appeals to violence in their activism. The mainstream Marxist critique of such a position began with Vladimir Lenin's Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder, which critiqued those (such as Anton Pannekoek or Sylvia Pankhurst) in the nascent Communist International, who argued against cooperation with parliamentary or reformist socialists. Lenin characterized the ultra-left as a politics of purity‚Äîthe doctrinal \\"repetition of the 'truths' of pure communism\\".Lenin, cited in ≈Ωi≈æek The Idea of Communism, p.37, see Nicholas Thoburn \\"Do not be afraid, join us, come back? On the \\"idea of communism\\" in our time\\" Cultural Critique Number 84, Spring 2013, pp. 1-34 Leninists typically used the term against their rivals on the left: \\"the Communist Party's Betty Reid wrote in a 1969 pamphlet Ultra- Leftism in Britain that the CPGB made 'no exclusive claim to be the only force on the left', but dismissed the groups to the left of the CPGB as the 'ultra- left', with Reid outlining the ultra-left as groups that were Trotskyist, anarchist or syndicalist or those that 'support the line of the Communist Party of China during the Sino-Soviet Split' (pp. 7‚Äì8)\\".\\"Introduction\\" in Smith Evan, Worley Matthew Against the grain: The British far left from 1956, Oxford University Press, 1 Dec 2014 Trotskyists and others stated the Communist International was pursuing a strategy of unrealistic ultra-leftism during its Third Period, which the Communist International later admitted when it turned to a United Front strategy in 1934‚Äì5.e.g. John Molyneux \\"What do we mean by ultra-leftism?\\" (October 1985) in Socialist Worker Review 80, October 1985, pp. 24‚Äì25. The term has been popularized in the United States by the Socialist Workers Party at the time of the Vietnam war, using the term to both describe opponents in the anti-war movement including Gerry Healy. Ultra- leftism is often associated with leftist sectarianism, in which a socialist organization might attempt to put its own short-term interests before the long-term interests of the working class and its allies.  Ultra-leftism today  At present, some currents of ultra-leftism have moved away from ultra-leftism's left communist origins and have adopted a decentralized version of Marxism. Some ultra-leftists have been influenced by autonomism, communization and the theories of Max Stirner. This ideological move has created a divide between traditional left communists and the current ultra- left, mostly on the issue of centralism. Some consider the modern ultra-left a neo-Situationist doctrine inspired, among others, by the works of Guy Debord. Some ultra-leftists are also inspired by the works of Stirner, identifying themselves egoist-communists.

It was nominated for the International Dublin Literary Award in 2004. Plot introduction Set in the late 1980s, the story is written from the perspective of David Zimmer, a university professor who, after losing his wife and children in a plane crash, falls into a routine of depression and isolation. After seeing one of the silent comedies of Hector Mann, an actor missing since the 1920s, he decides to occupy himself by watching all of Mann's films and writing a book about them. The publishing of the book, however, triggers another series of events that draw Zimmer even deeper into the actor's past. The middle of the story is largely dedicated to telling the life story of Hector Mann, involving his self-imposed exile from his past life and career, which serves as a form of penance for his role in the death of a woman who loved him. In his last days, Mann's wife sends a letter to Zimmer, requesting him to come to their New Mexico home to bear witness to Mann's final legacy of films. The events that ensue form the overarching story of Zimmer's rehabilitation from his reclusive state, and his coming to terms with the manner in which his family was killed.  Links to other works  The book makes many direct references to the autobiography of Fran√ßois-Ren√© de Chateaubriand, M√©moires d'outre-tombe; one of Zimmer's ongoing projects is producing a new translation of the book. David Zimmer appears in Auster's earlier novel Moon Palace. The Book of Illusions revisits a number of plot elements seen in Auster's first major work, The New York Trilogy. These include: * The protagonist driving himself into isolation * Extended focus on a character's (fictional) body of work * Writers as characters * A character disappearing, only to resurface years later, having spent some of the intervening years wandering and doing odd jobs * Parallels drawn between a work of Nathaniel Hawthorne and the plot itself * Notebooks (also in Oracle Night) * A meta-referential ending that places the protagonist as the author of the book itself In addition, the book also bears the stylistic distinction of not using quotation marks; Auster has previously used this in Ghosts, the second book of The New York Trilogy and Travels in the Scriptorium. He also does this in his later book, Invisible The Silent World of Hector Mann The Silent World of Hector Mann is an album by Duke Special inspired by the character Hector Mann with each song themselves based on a film each written by a different songwriter. Reception James Wood, a critic of Auster's work, nevertheless named it as 'probably his best novel.' He praised Auster's 'painstaking and vivid fictional re-creation of the career of a silent-movie actor of the nineteen twenties.' However, he says the novel 'soon hurtles into absurdity.' https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/11/30/shallow-graves References Category:Novels by Paul Auster Category:2002 American novels Category:Novels set in New Mexico Category:Henry Holt and Company books Category:Novels about writers Category:Novels about actors ","title":"The Book of Illusions"},{"id":"2075561","text":"Jeremy Dyson (born 14 June 1966) is an English author, musician and screenwriter who, along with Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith, is one of the League of Gentlemen.

On 19 May 1846, only six days after President James Polk signed the Declaration of War with Mexico, Secretary of the Navy George Bancroft authorized the purchase of Spitfire and , two light draft steamers being built for the Mexican Navy. The ships were delivered to the United States Navy on 14 July 1846, and Spitfire was commissioned on 21 August 1846, Commander Josiah Tattnall in command. Service history After carrying dispatches for United States forces in California to Chagres, Panama, Spitfire joined the American blockading force off Vera Cruz on 10 November; and, as she was a new and efficient vessel designed specifically for service on Mexico's Gulf Coast, she significantly strengthened Commodore David Conner's squadron. =Occupation of Tampico= Spitfire amongst the U.S. naval expedition under Perry, ascending the Tuspan River; destroying the forts, and taking possession of the port of Tuspan On the 12th, the small side wheel gunboat got underway with the squadron for an expedition against Tampico. The American ships gathered off Tampico bar on the morning of the 14th. At 10:45, Conner boarded Spitfire and used her as his flagship during the attack which they opened at about 11:00 by firing a gun. Spitfire joined other light draft vessels of the squadron and boats from the heavier American warships in moving across the bar and up the P√°nuco River and past the fort which guarded the stream. In the early afternoon, a delegation from the city boarded Spitfire to discuss surrender. No agreement was reached; but, after a landing party had occupied the town, Conner decided that no formal capitulation was necessary. Two days later, boats from Spitfire and Vixen ascended the Panuco and captured three small Mexican gunboats. On the 18th, Spitfire and schooner went further up the river and captured the town of P√°nuco the next morning. They also destroyed nine Mexican 18-pounders, threw a large supply of 18-pound shot in the river, and burned military stores before heading downstream on the 21st. On 25 November, after a \\"norther\\" sank Neptune at Tampico, Spitfire rescued that steamer's crew without loss of life. On 13 December, Conner departed Tampico in Princeton and left Commander Tattnall in charge there until enough Army troops arrived to hold the town. Thus, Spitfire did not return to Vera Cruz until 3 January 1847. =Siege of Veracruz= Preparations were soon underway for operations against that important port city. On 9 March, Spitfire led a flotilla of gunboats and other light draft naval vessels close to the shore to support the landing of Army troops who began to invest the city. Just after dawn the following day, Spitfire anchored east of the fortress at San Juan de Ul√∫a and opened fire on the castle to divert the attention of the Mexicans from General Winfield Scott who shifted his headquarters ashore that morning. After an engagement lasting about 30 minutes, Spitfire withdrew out of range of the Mexican cannon. The days that followed were devoted to preparations for a siege of the city. At mid-afternoon on the 22nd, when the cannonading began, Spitfire led Josiah Tattnall's flotilla in an attack on the shore end of the city walls and maintained the bombardment until dark. The steamer's fire was praised as being especially accurate and effective. During the action, the batteries in the fortress fired on the flotilla, but its ships were undamaged. That night, Spitfire's executive officer, Lt. David Dixon Porter, made a daring boat reconnaissance of the harbor at Vera Cruz to locate the best position for the flotilla when it resumed its shelling. The next morning, Tattnall sailed his gunboats within grape-shot range of Fort Santiago and opened fire on both the town and the fort. The Mexican guns replied but were unable to depress their pieces sufficiently to hit the fearless American gunboats. =Further operations= After the surrender of Vera Cruz, Spitfire participated in the expedition against Alvarado and the capture of Tuxpan as Commodore Matthew C. Perry's flagship. On 14 June, she was part of the force which took Frontera at the mouth of the Tabasco River. The American ships then ascended the river, engaged Mexican batteries at three points on the Tabasco, and occupied the city of the same name on the 16th. The American warships remained until 22 July when they headed down river toward the Gulf of Mexico. But, by this time most of the fighting of the Navy in the Gulf of Mexico had ceased. After routine duties protecting Army supply lines and communication, Spitfire returned home and was sold at Norfolk in 1848.

It is a parody of the anime production business itself. It was released on DVD in North America by Central Park Media. Plot = Animation Runner Kuromi 1= The plot revolves around a girl called Mikiko \\"Kuromi\\" Oguro who grows up watching the fictional anime Luis Monde III. She decides that animation is something she wants to do, and so enrolls in animation school. When she gets out of school, she is delighted to find a job at a small animation studio named Studio Petit. The director of the studio shows her around and gives her the nickname \\"Kuromi,\\" a name meant to abbreviate her own. Very soon after Mikiko arrives the director falls seriously ill and leaves his post, but not before he appoints Mikiko with the job of Production Desk Manager, on the second episode of the studio's current anime, Time Journeys. The audience follows Mikiko's frantic attempts and schemes to convince the studio's artists to work harder and produce their key frames in time to send them for production. = Animation Runner Kuromi 2 = Mikiko \\"Kuromi\\" Oguro is still working as Production Desk Manager at Studio Petit, and thanks to the excellent job she did, she is now in charge of 3 anime series. Luckily for Mikiko this time around she has some help from a veteran producer in the form of Takashimadaira. Unfortunately Takashimadaira is concerned only with getting the product out on time, even if it means cutting on the quality of the product. This leaves Mikiko with a difficult decision on which is the more important, the quality of the product or the deadline.

Many of the problems Kuromi faces are the same as those faced by software project managers. The second episode is a classic example of what Ed Yourdon calls a \\"Death March\\" in his book of the same name, and many of the solutions Kuromi comes up with, particularly the use of triage, are the same as those found in the book.

It consists of honey-flavored corn cereal bits in a honeycomb shape.The honey comb are 1 1/2 Inches. Versions At the end of 2006, Post changed the formula for this popular cereal to improve its health content. This change, although tested by Post beforehand to positive reviews, received mainly negative reviews from consumers. Following this public response, in March 2007, Kraft Foods (then-owner of Post Cereals ) introduced a new \\"Improved Taste\\" version of the cereal that, the company claimed, would improve \\"the cereal's taste, texture and appearance while incorporating key nutritional benefits to the product.\\" Three variations have been marketed, Strawberry Blasted Honeycomb, which added strawberry flavoring, and Chocolate Honeycomb, with chocolate flavoring in the pieces. Another variety Cinna- Graham Honeycomb added cinnamon flavor to the cereal. On May 1, 2017, Post reformulated its Honeycomb cereal recipe. Reviews of the cereal on retailer websites such as Amazon and Walmart posted after the reformulation date were almost universally negative, 1-star complaints about the new recipe. In April 2018, after refusing to comment on the recipe change since it has been released, Post began replying to customer complaints that they would be returning to the old recipe at some point during the summer of 2018. =Ingredients= The product's ingredients are listed as: :corn flour, sugar, whole grain oat flour, modified cornstarch, corn syrup, honey, salt, turmeric (color), wheat starch. :Ferric Orthophosphate (source of iron), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3), Zinc Oxide (source of zinc), Thiamin Mononitrate (Vitamin B1), Calcium Pantothenate (a B-Vitamin), Pyridoxine Hydrochloride (Vitamin B6), Folic Acid. The product's ingredients prior to May 2017 are listed as: :corn flour and bran blend (corn flour, whole grain corn flour, corn bran), sugar, whole grain oat flour, honey, salt, yellow 5, BHT added to packaging material to preserve product freshness. :Vitamins & minerals: niacinamide (B vitamin), reduced iron, zinc oxide (source of zinc), Vitamin B6, Vitamin A palmitate, riboflavin (Vitamin B2), thiamin mononitrate (Vitamin B1), folic acid (B vitamin), Vitamin B12, Vitamin D When Bran Blend, defined as whole grain corn flour and corn bran, was included in the ingredient list, the fiber content was tripled (from 1g to 3g per serving). This put the cereal in Kraft's Sensible Solution program. Advertising and marketing Originally, an animated cowboy named The Honeycomb Kid was the cereal's mascot. The cereal's jingle was borrowed from the song \\"Honeycomb\\", a 1957 hit for Jimmie Rodgers. =Honeycomb Hideout= During the 1970s and 1980s, television commercials featured visitors to a children's clubhouse called the Honeycomb Hideout in which the visitor arrives, initially hostile, and exclaims a need for a \\"big\\" cereal. Then, the kids introduce the visitor to the cereal, winning over the visitor, examining the size of the cereal bits with a tape measure and singing the jingle: :Honeycomb's big...yeah yeah yeah! :It's not small...no no no! :Honeycomb's got...a big big bite! :Big big (taste/crunch) in a big big bite! During the 1980s, the cereal offered the Honeycomb Hideout Club for children, distributing badges, membership cards and clubhouse toy incentives on specially marked box tops. The jingle was spoofed on the Futurama episode entitled \\"The Sting\\" in 2003. =Honeycomb Kid= Honeycomb Kid sought what he called \\"The Honeycomb Secret.\\" Honeycomb Kid had learned from his prior adventures that the secret consisted of three separate parts: The first was the Crunch, the second was the Shape, however the third and most important answer had always eluded him. In the last installment of his first commercial appearances, Honeycomb Kid discovers the third component of the Honeycomb secret to be the Taste. A new set of Honeycomb Kid commercials were made in the 1980s where a child athlete would get done practicing then come up to a table with Honeycomb cereal, exclaim it was his or her favorite cereal, to where the older guys at the table would somewhat mock the \\"little kid\\" or \\"little guy\\" for wanting \\"big Honeycomb\\", to where the kid would go, \\"Little kid (guy)?! Watch this!\\" then go and show off his or her skills to them, thoroughly impressing them (saying \\"Big stuff!\\" and \\"Honeycomb kid!\\" as they watch) and being accepted by them (\\"I didn't know you were a Honeycomb kid!\\") and the commercial ends with the kid happily eating a bowl of Honeycomb. =Crazy Craving= In 1995, a mascot, Crazy Craving, was introduced as a wild-haired, marsupial-like cartoon character who rabidly craves Honeycomb cereal and whom children in the commercials transform into. Its catch-phrase was \\"Me Want Honeycomb\\". The name Crazy Craving means that the character is the anthropomorphism of hunger. =Bernard, the Bee Boy= A more recent commercial introduces Bernard, a boy raised by bees. He is found and attempted to be socialized. Although he had clearly been a feral child, he apparently cannot argue the fact that he is a 'bee' not a 'boy,' and he enjoys Honeycomb. In a later commercial, a man gives a safari-like tour for the bee boy, luring him with Honeycomb. In a commercial released in 2010, a second bee boy was introduced played by Canadian actor Joel Cox. Mini scale models and license plates In 1969, one of Post Cereal's most profitable promotions was launched for the twentieth time in as many years. Free scale models of four different 1969 Mercury automobiles were packed one to a box of Honeycomb. Offered in six authentic '69 Mercury colors, the entire set included 24 different cars. Since these were not offered by mail, it took a lot of Honeycomb to acquire the entire collection. The Mercurys were followed by a series of generic racing cars (1970), an offering of marble-powered dune buggies (1973) and a small model of the Flintmobile, from \\"The Flintstones\\" television series (1975). By then, Honeycomb had become the source for automotive toys from Post. While miniature license plates had been a cereal premium mainstay since 1953, Honeycomb continued the tradition into the 1970s and 1980s with their free \\"in pack\\" mini-license plate promotion. One miniature state license plate was free inside each box, with the ability to order the whole set of 50 plates by mail for a few dollars. Once, Post also included plates that said \\"LUCKY\\" and the finder of those plates won a BMX bike. The commercial for this showed a girl winning and later riding the BMX bike.

The station is owned and operated by The Walt Disney Company. The KRDC broadcast license is held by ABC Radio Los Angeles Assets, LLC. KRDC, formerly Radio Disney station KDIS, was broadcast in the HD (hybrid) format until late 2014 when all Radio Disney affiliates were sold except for the Los Angeles station which returned to analog transmissions. KRDC is still licensed for digital (HD) operation. 1110 AM is a United States clear-channel frequency. History The station initially signed on as KPAS in 1942, a station featuring popular music. J.

The station originally broadcast from its El Monte transmitter site, near Santa Anita Ave and the Pomona, or \\"60\\" Freeway, in the vicinity of the Peck Road exit. =KRLA (1959‚Äì2000)= The station later became KRLA, \\"The Big 11-10\\", on September 1, 1959, and became one of the top radio stations in the Los Angeles area, competing with KFWB and later KHJ to be L.A.'s dominant top 40 station. The on-air personalities included Dave Hull (The Hullabalooer), Emperor Bob Hudson, Ted Quillin, Rebel Foster, Jimmy Rabbitt, Casey Kasem, Bob Eubanks, Dick Biondi, Sam Riddle, Dick Moreland, Jimmy O'Neill, Wink Martindale, and Johnny Hayes. In 1968, Lew Irwin became news director in order to create The Credibility Gap, which broadcast topical comedy along with the news. In 1969, John Gilliland debuted the Pop Chronicles music documentary. KHJ (AM) countered with \\"The History of Rock and Roll,\\" a 48-hour ‚Äúrockumentary‚Äù that chronicled the evolution of Rock and Roll, on Friday February 21, 1969 at 12 noon, the beginning of a Washington‚Äôs Birthday holiday weekend. The 1969 film The Model Shop features a radio newscast by Ralph Thompson, KRLA. During the 1960s, the KRLA studio was in an old carriage house just off the parking lot of the old Huntington Sheraton Hotel on Oak Knoll Drive in Pasadena, making it possible to drop by and watch the on-air DJ do his show, those who did were called \\"porch people\\" by the staff. When Dave Hull was fired, \\"Porch people\\" and other listeners staged a sit-in. When the station switched to oldies, KRLA was noted for its prominence in Southern California Chicano culture.Garcia, M. (1999). The\\" Chicano\\" Dance Hall: Remapping Public Space in Post-World War II Greater Los Angeles. Counterpoints, 96, 317-341.

The show also included a trivia question that Hayes asked for people to call in with their answer in order to win a prize. Each day's show counted down the top 11 songs from that date in a previous year as well as a few extras.

They dropped current music in 1984, electing to play the oldies of the late 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. By 1994, KRLA leaned towards an urban oldies format. On February 25, 1997, CBS Radio announced that it would trade WMMR in Philadelphia, and WOAZ and WBOS in Boston to Greater Media in exchange for KRLA and sister station KLSX, as part of its acquisition of Infinity Broadcasting Corporation. The swap was completed on August 22.

Logo used from 2013 until 2017. On August 13, 2014, it was revealed that all of Radio Disney's remaining stations, excluding KDIS, were to be sold in an effort to focus more on digital distribution of the Radio Disney network. KDIS was retained to serve as the originator of Radio Disney's programming, and its operations were assumed by the network's national staff. =KRDC (2017‚ÄìPresent)= On June 9, 2017, KDIS changed call letters to KRDC and flipped to a country format as \\"Radio Disney Country\\", becoming the first terrestrial radio station carrying the formerly online-only platform. KRDC also added a translator, 99.1 K256CX, which broadcasts from KRDC's transmitter in Irwindale. The children's radio/contemporary hit radio hybrid continued in the market on KRTH's HD2 subchannel until Entercom's deal with Radio Disney expired at the end of May 2018. Transmitter In 1987, KRLA moved its transmitter site from South El Monte to Irwindale, where a similar antenna array was installed. During the 1990s, KRLA was authorized to increase nighttime power from 10,000 to 20,000 watts. When the power increase went into effect, KRLA started broadcasting from the new transmitter site in Irwindale. This is a few miles north of the old El Monte site. The El Monte transmitter building still stands as a shell. The entire inside is burned out; however, there are still clues to its historic past, namely the first incarnation of its directional antenna arrays (four in-line 135-degree towers, one days, four nights), the second incarnation (four 135-degree towers in a parallelogram, days and a 90-, two 135-, and a 180-degree towers, nights), and the last incarnation, with seven total towers, four days and four nights, with one tower in common, days and nights). There are numerous ducts to keep the equipment cool and an underground channel to divert the cooling water for the transmitters. A well nearby supplied the water. Still visible is the wooden archway where the transmission cables gently bent toward underground conduits running to the transmission towers in the nearby field. All that remains of these towers are the concrete pylons, all aligned as described. The present Irwindale site includes five 135-degree towers, two days and four nights, with one in common. The significantly northern location, relative to the old El Monte site, allows the large \\"Inland Empire\\" to be served with 50,000 watts and only two towers, not four, days, and the greater Los Angeles metro to be served with 20,000 watts and four towers, nights. K256CX K256CX is a broadcast translator licensed to Pasadena. The transmitter is located in Irwindale. The station went on the air June 9, 2017, and rebroadcasts KRDC on 99.1 MHz. =History= The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) granted an original construction permit on December 6, 2013, to build an FM translator (K293BZ, now K256CX) licensed in Beaumont, California, and located in the 106.5 MHz frequency, which would rebroadcast KWVE-FM in San Clemente. On October 18, 2016, KDIS's licensee ABC Radio Los Angeles Assets agreed to acquire from the Calvary Chapel Costa Mesa the permit with the intention to rebroadcast the AM station for $45,000. On November 8, the FCC, as part of the AM revitalization program, granted a modification to move the transmitter location to Irwindale (although the translator will maintain Beaumont as its license city) and change the frequency to 99.1. The transaction was closed on February 7, 2017. Following the launch of K256CX and KDIS' switch to Radio Disney Country as KRDC on June 9, 2017, Mount Wilson FM Broadcasters, owner of existing country music station KKGO, said in a statement welcoming the station that the translator would mainly cover the San Gabriel Valley and that the FCC had also authorized another station on the 99.1 FM frequency in Long Beach.

History  Transmitting towers, located in Maspeth, Queens. WFME began operations as W2XR, an experimental television station, owned by inventor John V. L. Hogan, operating at 2100 kHz, which went on the air on March 26, 1929. Hogan was a radio engineer who owned many patents, and wanted a permit for an experimental station. To avoid interference, the frequency granted in 1934 by the Federal Radio Commission was considerably above the normal broadcasting range, which at that time ended at 1500 kilocycles. Hogan's permit was one of four construction permits; the others, all granted on the same day, were W1XBS Waterbury and W9XBY Kansas City, both on 1530 kHz, and W6XAI Bakersfield, which shared 1550 kHz with W2XR. W2XR was licensed as an \\"experimental broadcast station\\" on June 29, 1934. But Hogan was also a connoisseur of music, and he drew on his own record collection to provide the sound for his experiments, which typically lasted for an hour in the evening. W2XR began to broadcast Classical music recordings on 1550 kHz. His television broadcasts came to naught, but Hogan began to hear from unknown individuals who encouraged him to continue broadcasting music.Ivan Veit, preface to Howard Taubman, The New York Times Guide to Listening Pleasure (NY: Macmillan and London: Collier-Macmillan, 1968), pp. ix-x. In 1936, Hogan and Elliott Sanger formed the Interstate Broadcasting Company, with the intention of turning W2XR into a commercial station at a time when there were already about twenty-five radio stations in New York. The transmitter, which used a homemade antenna mounted on a wooden pole, was located in a garage in Long Island City, near the Queensborough Bridge, and its 250 watts provided just enough power to reach midtown Manhattan and parts of Queens.Ivan Veit, preface to Howard Taubman, The New York Times Guide to Listening Pleasure (NY: Macmillan and London: Collier-Macmillan, 1968), p. x. On December 3, 1936, W2XR became WQXR, the cursive form of the letter \\"Q\\" mimics the number \\"2\\". An FM service, W2XQR, was added in 1939. The North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement of 1941 formally extended the AM band to 1600 kHz, ending the \\"high-fidelity\\" service but keeping all four original stations near their existing dial positions. WQXR was originally slated to move to 1600 as a five-kilowatt class III-A regional station, but was able to persuade the FCC to make it a class I-B station on 1560 kHz instead. = \\"The radio station of The New York Times\\" (1944‚Äì1998) = The New York Post approached the company in the early 1940s about purchasing the stations. Sanger said publicly that he would have preferred to sell to The New York Times, and in early 1944, the Times agreed to pay just over $1 million for ownership of Interstate Broadcasting Company. A transfer application was filed with the FCC on March 1, 1944, including a financial statement showing that the stations had made over $22,000 in profits the previous year, on revenues of $411,000; after FCC approval, the sale was completed on July 25, 1944. (The Times continued to operate its radio stations under the Interstate Broadcasting name for many years, maintaining what its president called \\"basic good-music policies,\\"Ivan Veit, preface to Howard Taubman, The New York Times Guide to Listening Pleasure (NY: Macmillan and London: Collier-Macmillan, 1968), p. xi. Veit defined good music as \\"any music that has lasting value . . . symphonies, concertos, chamber works, opera, of course; but also the best of the lighter forms, including operettas, Broadway show tunes, fold music, and the world of jazz.\\" but later used the name The New York Times Radio Company.) It broadcast classical music full-time, along with New York Times news. At 9 PM, the newspaper having been \\"put to bed\\", the station would broadcast a brief discussion of the news which would appear on the front page of the next day's issue. Older logo of WQXR displaying both FM and AM frequencies WQXR was the first AM station in New York to experiment with broadcasting in stereo, beginning in 1952. During some of its live concerts, it used two microphones positioned six feet apart. The microphone on the right led to its AM feed, and the one on the left to its FM feed, so a listener could position two radios six feet apart, one tuned to 1560 and the other to 96.3, and listen in stereo.\\"More Air Hats in Stereo Ring\\". The Billboard. November 9, 1959. pp. 16‚Äì20. Retrieved February 19, 2015 ‚Äì via Google Books. In 1964, there was controversy when its 11 PM program \\"Nightcap\\" was sponsored by Schenley Liquors. Advertising hard liquor was considered a violation of the voluntary NAB standards. In 1965, the FCC began requiring commonly owned AM and FM stations in large markets to broadcast separate programming for at least part of the day. WQXR-FM concentrated on longer classical works, while WQXR (AM) aired lighter Classical music and talk programs produced in conjunction with The New York Times. While this plan gave Classical music fans in the New York area two options, it also increased expenses for the stations. In 1971, the Times put WQXR-AM-FM up for sale. Many offers were received for the FM station, but none of the bids for 1560 AM were satisfactory to management. When the FCC agreed to waive rules prohibiting stations from simulcasting if they were broadcasting classical music, the Times took the WQXR stations off the market. Simulcasting was also allowed, for example, for WGMS and WGMS-FM in Washington. On December 2, 1992, the AM side broke away from the simulcast for good, changing to an American popular standards format, which was inaugurated by a live studio performance by Tony Bennett. The change came a few months after WNEW (1130 AM), New York's heritage popular standards station, announced an impending sale to Bloomberg L.P. and a format switch to business information with the new call letters WBBR. The format change at 1560 to standards happened 10 days before WNEW's transition. To reflect the heritage of both outlets, WQXR (AM) changed its call sign to WQEW. The station focused on a broad range of pop standards‚Äìthe format's foundation artists including Frank Sinatra, Nat \\"King\\" Cole, Ella Fitzgerald, Dean Martin and Perry Como, but also artists from the big band era (such as Tommy Dorsey, Artie Shaw, Glenn Miller, Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington); and non-rock-and-roll pop hits (by artists like Neil Diamond, Barbra Streisand, Ray Charles, Bobby Darin and Pat Boone, among others). Light rock'n'roll material such as the Turtles was also occasionally heard. = Radio Disney (1998‚Äì2015) = Final Radio Disney logo for WQEW. Although initially successful, the station's advertising revenues were not spectacular, and older audience demographics were deemed undesirable for long-term success. On December 3, 1998, the Times announced that WQEW would switch to Radio Disney after agreeing to what was initially an eight-year local marketing agreement term with the Walt Disney Company and its ABC Radio subsidiary. The entire WQEW air staff, under orders to not discuss the pending changes on the air, was released on December 21; the station played Christmas music without announcers through the holiday. Regular programming resumed on December 26 and ended on December 27 at 11:59 p.m., when a pre-recorded signoff read by program director and air personality Stan Martin was played. Radio Disney programming launched on WQEW on December 28, 1998. At the end of the agreement with the Times in late 2006, Disney had the option to purchase the station or to extend the arrangement with the Times maintaining ownership. Disney exercised the option to purchase in early January 2007. Disney/ABC officially became the owner of the station on May 24, 2007. On August 13, 2014, Disney announced its intention to end terrestrial distribution of the Radio Disney format, in order to focus on digital distribution. Disney would also sell its remaining Radio Disney broadcast outlets, including WQEW and with the lone exception of KDIS in Los Angeles. Disney set a deadline of September 26, 2014 to complete the sales or have deals in principle set or the stations in question, including WQEW, would fall silent. However, Disney backtracked and the stations would remain on the air, continuing to broadcast Radio Disney programming until each were sold. = Family Radio (2015‚Äìpresent) = On November 21, 2014, Oakland, California-based Family Stations announced it would purchase WQEW from Disney/ABC for $12.95 million. The transaction had been rumored for at least a month, as it was originally reported by the New York Daily News on October 14, 2014; however, Disney had clarified that it had not yet agreed to the sale. In January 2013 Family Radio sold the original, Newark, New Jersey-licensed WFME (94.7 FM, which it had owned since 1966 but had been programming since 1963) to Cumulus Media, who converted the station into country music-formatted WNSH. In what amounted to a station trade-plus- cash transaction, Family Stations also acquired the license for WDVY (106.3 FM) in Mount Kisco, New York. The 106.3 FM signal, combined in tandem with Family Radio-owned WFRH (91.7 FM) in Kingston, New York mainly serves the Hudson Valley region; another Family Radio outlet, WFRS (88.9 FM) in Smithtown, New York serves Long Island. This left Family Radio programming unavailable over-the-air in New York City proper and northern New Jersey (including Newark) for over two years. After the FCC approved the sale on February 10, 2015, 1560 AM went silent on February 17 in preparation of the format change. The sale was finalized on February 20 and the call sign was changed to WFME. The station returned to the air on February 27, again giving Family Radio full coverage of the New York City market. Concurrent with the sale, the FCC converted 1560 AM's broadcast license status from commercial to non-commercial educational. Since the initial move from 94.7 in 2013, WFME's originating role with the Family Radio network has been reduced; the station previously originated a portion of the network's overnight program Nightwatch, which was hosted by now-retired station manager/chief engineer Charlie Menut. The entirety of the station's schedule originates from Family Radio headquarters (which in 2016 moved from Oakland to nearby Alameda, California), although WFME does carry local programming to comply with the FCC's public affairs requirements.

He is best known for writing a libretto, supposedly based on a true story, about a woman who disguises herself as a man to rescue her husband from prison, which formed the basis of Beethoven's opera Fidelio as well as a number of other operas.  Life  Bouilly was born near Tours, and was briefly a lawyer for the Parlement de Paris. At the outbreak of the Revolution he held office under the new government and was head of the military commission in Tours during the Reign of Terror. In 1795, he served as a member of the Committee of Public Instruction having a considerable share in the organization of primary education, but retired from public life four years later in order to devote himself to literature.

James Lardner Biography Born at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, he was the sixth son of John Lardner and Margaret (n√©e Saltar) Lardner. Lardner was appointed midshipman on May 10, 1820. He served in the Pacific Squadron from 1821 to 1824, and joined the Mediterranean Squadron in 1825 after escorting General Lafayette in back to France. He received promotion to lieutenant on May 17, 1828, and served as navigating officer of the sloop on her historic circumnavigation, and then served on the flagships of the Mediterranean, Brazil and Pacific Squadrons. In 1850 he sailed for the coast of Africa in the brig and was promoted to commander on May 17, 1851. Lardner spent three years as commander of Porpoise and the sloop-of-war in the Africa Squadron before returning to Boston, Massachusetts, in 1853. He was promoted to the rank of captain, on May 19, 1861. In September 1861, during the Civil War, Lardner, in command of the frigate , took a pertinent part in the Battle of Port Royal and the capture of Forts Walker and Beauregard. He was commended for gallantry in action by Rear Admiral Samuel F. Du Pont; his name was sent to Congress for a vote of thanks by President Abraham Lincoln. In May 1862, he assumed command of the East Gulf Blockading Squadron and was promoted to commodore on July 16, 1862. In December 1862 he returned to Philadelphia to recover from a severe attack of yellow fever. From May 1863 to October 1864, Lardner commanded the West India Squadron. After his retirement on November 20, 1864, he was appointed rear admiral on July 25, 1866. He served on special duty with various boards until 1869, when he was appointed Governor of the Naval Asylum, Philadelphia. He held this post until 1871. Lardner died on April 12, 1881 in Philadelphia. Namesakes Two United States Navy destroyers have been named for him. Personal life Lardner married Margaret Wilmer on February 2, 1832, and they had three children, two of whom died in infancy. After his wife's death on April 25, 1846, he married her sister, Ellen Wilmer and had two further sons. It was because of James Lawrence Lardner that one of his nephews came to be known as Ring Lardner: James Lardner was a friend of Cadwalader Ringgold, another Navy officer who also became a rear admiral. James Lardner named one of his sons \\"Ringgold Wilmer Lardner\\", and James' brother gave exactly the same name to his own son after the newborn's cousin. Ring Lardner never liked his given name and shortened it, yet he \\"lost the battle\\" when his son, Ring Lardner, Jr. was named after him.

Rabbinical tradition considers him to be the angel of mercy. Zadkiel was said to be the Angel who prevented Abraham from sacrificing his son, Isaac. In rabbinic writings Zadkiel belongs to the order of Hashmallim (equated with the Dominations or Dominions), and considered by some sources to be chief of that order (others sources name Hashmal or Zacharael). In Maseket Azilut Zadkiel/Hesediel is listed as co-chief with Gabriel of the order of Shinanim. As an angel of mercy, some texts claim that Zadkiel is the unnamed biblical Angel of the Lord who holds back Abraham to prevent the patriarch from sacrificing his son, and because of this is usually shown holding a dagger. Other texts cite Michael or Tadhiel or some other angel as the angel intended, while others interpret the Angel of the Lord as a theophany. Zadkiel is one of two standard bearers (along with Jophiel) who follow directly behind Michael as the head archangel enters battle. Zadkiel is associated with the color violet. In iconography, he is often depicted holding a knife or dagger. In Jewish mysticism and Western ritual magic, Zadkiel is associated with the planet Jupiter. The angel's position in the Sephirot is fourth, which corresponds to mercy. Gallery File:Set of Archangels - Zadkiel.jpgThe Dominion Zadkiel, engraving by Crispijn van de Passe, circa 1590.

Richard Salomon described them as \\"stories, usually narrated by the Buddha, that illustrate the workings of karma by revealing the acts of a particular individual in a previous life and the results of those actions in his or her present life.\\" This literature includes around 600 stories in the PƒÅli language ApadƒÅna (\\"Legends\\"). There are also a large number in Sanskrit collections, of which the chief are the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika's MahƒÅvastu (\\"Great Book\\") and the SarvƒÅstivƒÅda's AvadƒÅna≈õataka (Century of Legends) and DivyƒÅvadƒÅna (The Heavenly Legend). These latter collections include accounts relating to Gautama Buddha and the third-century BCE \\"righteous ruler,\\" Ashoka.\\"AvadƒÅna\\" (2008). Amongst the most popular avadƒÅnas of Northern HinayƒÅna Buddhism are: * the story of Sudhana, preserved in the MahƒÅvastu under the title Kinnarƒ´ jƒÅtaka, amongst others, who falls in love with a kinnarƒ´ and saves her life. * the Vessantara JƒÅtaka, the story of the compassionate prince who gives away everything he owns, including his wife and children, thereby displaying the virtue of perfect charity. * the Suvannasankha jƒÅtakaPadmanabh S.

It aired in the United Kingdom between 1971 and 1973, repeated for two years after that and again in the late 1980s. The series starred Gillian Blake in the lead role. Notable people connected with the series were actors Desmond Llewelyn and Arthur English and directors Jack Cardiff, Stephen Frears, Michael Apted and David Hemmings. It was originally inspired by Monica Dickens' 1963 novel Cobbler's Dream (republished in 1995 as New Arrival at Follyfoot); she later wrote four further books in conjunction with the series‚ÄîFollyfoot in 1971, Dora at Follyfoot in 1972, The Horses of Follyfoot in 1975, and Stranger at Follyfoot in 1976.Follyfoot.tv.co.uk  Original Follyfoot novels /  Background and production  The series, which was filmed on the Harewood family estate, was set at a home of rest for horses. Despite an apparent appeal limited to young girls with an equine interest, Follyfoot was actually aimed squarely at the teenage market and often had challenging things to say about the treatment of horses and animals generally in British society. The ethos of Follyfoot generally was to give another chance to both horses and people who had been rejected by the rest of society: the stance of the series was recognisably pro-animal, and characters who resembled the archetypes of the Pullein-Thompson sisters et al were overwhelmingly shown in a negative light. Continuity in the series was assured by the use of mainly one writer, Tony Essex, who wrote 34 of the 39 episodes. The series' theme song, \\"The Lightning Tree\\", written by Francis Essex, the brother of Tony Essex and sung by The Settlers, is well-remembered, sometimes more so than the series itself. The song reached No. 36 in the UK charts in 1971.Official Charts Company  \\"The Lightning Tree\\" Chart information An album featuring music from the series was also released. The main actors were Gillian Blake as Dora, Steve Hodson as Steve, Christian Rodska as Ron Stryker, Desmond Llewelyn as the Colonel and Arthur English as Slugger. Several other famous people had minor roles, one being Pam St Clement, the others being Gretchen Franklin as the Colonel's housekeeper and Kathy Staff in two separate bit parts. But what really characterised the series was its rotation of directors, many of whom have since become revered figures in the UK film industry, including Stephen Frears, Michael Apted and even Jack Cardiff who took time out from working overseas with Kirk Douglas to direct two episodes of the series. Also, in the third series, most notably, David Hemmings took the time to appear in one episode, \\"Uncle Joe\\" and also to direct two other episodes which took place before and after that episode: \\"The Bridge Builder\\" and the final episode, \\"Walk In the Wood\\". The series proved to be very popular and was sold to many countries at the time of the original UK transmission. The first series won the Harlequin award for best production at the 1972 BAFTA Awards, while the second series episode, \\"The Debt\\", reached the top 20 in the weekly television ratings‚Äîa rarity for an afternoon-timeslot show.IMDb.com - 1972 BAFTA awards Hill and Beyond series overview During production for the third series, it was intended that this would be the last, a film version of Follyfoot was planned, but the idea was ultimately shelved.Steve Hodson newsletter with mention of the film The children's magazine Look-in featured a picture-strip of the series each week as well as regular features, while five annuals were released in association with Yorkshire Television. These ran until 1976‚Äîlong after the series had finished.Littleoak.com - Follyfoot annuals 1973-1977 Follifoot (note the slightly different spelling) is a small village just three miles from Harrogate, not far from the Yorkshire Television studios in Leeds. Characters =Main Characters= * Dora Maddocks (Gillian Blake): the series' central character and niece of The Colonel. The daughter of a bigwig ambassador, she has spent a miserable childhood because her parents have never understood her and being showered with material possessions was no compensation. In Series 2 ep 4, she recalls the pain of her 10th birthday where, instead of getting the pony she wanted, she instead got the most expensive dresses available. The story begins when Dora is sent to live with the Colonel when her parents leave for a government commission in South America‚Äîwhen she discovers Follyfoot farm, Dora finds her idyll. Dora is an idealist and a dreamer; she cannot cope with change and tries to shut out the fact the world is full of bad people. When the Colonel signs Follyfoot over to her, Dora desperately tries to keep the farm running as it always has done, despite this becoming increasingly impractical and the resulting tension with her love interest, Steve. Her disillusionment with the elite world she was brought up in is redolent of Monica Dickens's own feelings in the 1930s (she had been a debutante, but abandoned that privileged life to go into domestic service). * Steve Ross (Steve Hodson): Miner's son and former reform school pupil who served time in prison for lashing out at a man he found whipping a horse. A very competent horseman, he comes to work at Follyfoot after his previous employer, the Squire, refuses to believe he wasn't involved in an attack on his horses. Steve believes in the same values as Dora but through life experiences has a more realistic view of the world and this causes increasing tension with Dora throughout the second and especially the third series. He has an emotional attachment with Dora and wishes he could be more idealist like her. * Ron Stryker (Christian Rodska): the third of the trio of young workers at Follyfoot but also the shadiest. He is known to the police and one of his friends is Lewis Hammond, member of local miscreant gang the Night Riders. His father persuaded the Colonel to give him a job at Follyfoot to help keep him out of trouble, yet Ron is workshy and ignores constant warnings not to burst through the main gate at Follyfoot with his distinctive Triumph Tiger motorbike. Despite the rough exterior, Ron is essentially warm- hearted and loves the horses as much as everyone else. Ron is already working at Follyfoot when Dora, then Steve, arrive. * Slugger Jones (Arthur English): ex-boxer and \\"housekeeper\\" at Follyfoot Farm who has been working for the Colonel for over 20 years. He proves to be an emotional rock for Dora but will readily tell her to \\"snap out of it\\" where necessary. Slugger is gruff yet cuddly at the same time and is rather fond of Ron despite their love-hate fa√ßade. His cookery is notorious for its lack of variety‚Äîbacon and eggs or stew! * Colonel Geoffrey Maddocks (Desmond Llewelyn): Dora's uncle and the original owner of Follyfoot farm. He started Follyfoot years ago as his response to all the cruelty in the world and his attempt to do something about it. The Colonel has a reputation as a kindly eccentric and is the first person most people call on when they've got a horse in need of rehoming. He thinks the world of Dora and proves to be more of a father to her than her actual father, but an illness weakens him in Series 2 and when he signs Follyfoot over to Dora, she must increasingly have to manage under her own steam. He comes over, broadly, as a One Nation Tory, very much of the centre ground. =Minor Characters= * Lewis Hammond (Paul Guess): known locally as \\"The Louse\\", Ron's friend and leader of motorcycle thugs the Night Riders. He is complicit in the death of two of the Squire's horses which leads to Steve being wrongly implicated and sacked. * Callie Holmes (Gillian Bailey): teenage schoolgirl who occasionally helps out at Follyfoot. In the episode Moonstone, Callie coerces Steve into helping her hide a horse she's stolen from the circus, believing the animal to be unhappy. Steve is naturally twitchy because of his criminal past. Callie has a crush on Steve. * Gip Willens (Bryan Sweeney): young boy who loves horses but has little idea how to look after them. After Ron spins him a line about Follyfoot being a place where horses are tortured, Steve has his work cut out trying to convince him otherwise and it takes the near-death of Gip's horse to win him round. * Wendy Bendiger (Elaine Donnelly): a brief love-interest for Steve, which causes much upset for Dora. She eventually breaks up with him, which Steve puts down to their class difference. * Sam Lockwood (Frederick Treves): unscrupulous horse trader who is in it only for the money and does not care whether his animals are going to good homes. He proves the main series villain in Series 3, with Follyfoot having to take in two of his animals. His son Chip (Nigel Crewe) briefly dates Dora but he is too loyal to his father for the relationship to progress. * Hazel Donnelly (Veronica Quilligan): 14-year-old reform school delinquent sent to Follyfoot by the probation service. Dora takes an initial dislike to her, especially when she almost attacks her favourite horse Copper and forms a bond with Steve, but Hazel is essentially a younger version of Dora with the same background and strained relationship with her parents. After a volatile start she takes to working at Follyfoot and it is widely thought among the show's fans Hazel would have become a regular character had the series continued. * Another recurring (but very minor) character is the Vet (unnamed), played by Geoffrey Morris, who appears in several episodes during series 2 and 3. A second vet, played by Colin Rix, appeared in the first and last episodes of series 1 and in both cases was seen putting a sick horse out of its misery.

It is the first book published in the Dalemark Quartet, although chronologically it is the third in the series, coming in time hundreds of years after The Spellcoats and a year or so after Drowned Ammet.  Plot summary Osfameron Tanamoril (Moril) Clennenson is a travelling musician, who travels with his father, Clennen, his mother, Lenina, and his elder siblings, Dagner and Brid, through Dalemark, a country torn by civil war between the South and the North. They travel around, playing music, taking passengers and messages, and spreading news throughout the country. When Clennen (the father and main performer) is murdered by the Earl of South Dales, who suspects him of being a spy for the North, Lenina (who is high-born and gave up the chance of being a Lady when she married Clennen) takes her three children and their passenger Kialan, the fugitive son of a Northern earl, back to her home town of Markind in South Dalemark. Within the same day as her husband's death, Lenina is married to her former fianc√© the Lord of Markind, guided by the belief that this is the only way to counter the bad luck caused by Clennen's murder. Dagner, Brid, and Moril encounter their father's murderer among the wedding guests in Markind and together with Kialan they flee the town and try to reach the North, while continuing to perform for a living. However, without Clennen and Lenina, they find this difficult to do. The oldest son, Dagner, tries to continue their father's work as a Northern spy, but is arrested for treason against the Earl of South Dales. Brid, Moril, and Kialan are forced to flee, believing that Dagner will be hanged. Before he died, Clennen left his youngest son Moril a magical cwidder (a common musical instrument in Dalemark similar to a lute with some properties of an acoustic guitar). It is rumoured to have been owned by Moril's ancestor and namesake Osfameron, who was both a minstrel and a famous magician, featuring in many of the legends of Dalemark. Throughout their travels from the South to the North, Moril discovers that he has the power to use the magic of his newly inherited instrument. As they travel, they become embroiled in the civil war. As the Southerners are about to attack the North, Moril uses his magical cwidder to make the mountains 'walk' and close Flennpass, the only mountain pass between the North and the South, just as his ancestor, the famed Osfameron, did in so many of the songs Moril's father had sung nearly every day. The walking mountains crush the attacking Southern army, killing the evil Earl of South Dales, Clennen's murderer, and saving the North. However, after the battle, Moril is wracked with guilt, as he caused the deaths of hundreds of men, and mainly because he was angry that his beloved horse, Olob, had been shot. In the end, when all safely reach Hannart, the earldom of Kialan's father, they are joined by Dagner who has been released from jail after the death of the Earl of South Dales and travelled to North Dalemark with another travelling Singer, Hestefan. Moril decides that he should travel with Hestefan and learn how to be a proper Singer. Hestefan accepts, and they leave to continue travelling through Dalemark. Characters *Moril (full name Osfameron Tanamoril) ‚Äì the youngest son of Clennen and Lenina, who inherited his father's magic cwidder and learned to use its powers with dramatic results. *Clennen Mendakersson ‚Äì one of the most famous Singers in Dalemark and a composer of many songs with which he travelled through both North and South. In secret, he is the Porter, the notorious Northern spy wanted by the South Earls, using his status as a Singer to allow him to travel freely around the country. *Kialan (Collen or Halain in Southern pronunciation) ‚Äì the 14-year- old son of the Earl of Hannart of North Dale, shipwrecked on the coast of Holand in the South and now trying to escape a certain death by hanging in the hands of the Southern earls. He joins Clennen's band as a fugitive travelling to the North. *Dagner (full name Dastgandlen Handagner) ‚Äì the eldest son of Clennen and Lenina, a promising composer. After Clennen's murder, he tries to pass sensitive information to Southern freedom-fighters, but is arrested and threatened with execution. He is released when Tholian, the Earl of South Dales, is killed with all his male relatives by the \\"walking mountains\\" in Fennpass and, as Tholian's second cousin, becomes nominally the heir to the earldom of South Dales. *Brid (full name Cennoreth Manaliabrid) ‚Äì the daughter of Clennen and Lenina, a singer and panhorn player performing with her parents and two brothers from a garishly painted pink cart, travelling from the South to the North. *Lenina Thornsdaughter ‚Äì the niece of Earl Tholian of South Dales, wife of Clennen the Singer, and mother of Dagner, Brid, and Moril. Brought up as an aristocrat in the Southern earldom of Neathdale, she became bethrothed to Ganner Sargesson, but at their betrothal feast, she met Clennen, fell in love with him, ran away with him, and eventually married him. *Tholian ‚Äì the evil Earl of South Dales who murders Clennen and amasses an army to attack the North. Killed by the \\"walking mountains\\" that block Flennpass in response to the magic music from Moril's cwidder. *Ganner Sagersson ‚Äì the Lord of Markind (a vassal of the Earl of South Dales), a former fianc√© of Lenina who lost her to Clennen's magic in a singing performance and finally marries her after Clennen's death. (The Glossary included at the end of the tetralogy's final volume, The Crown of Dalemark, includes about a half-dozen entries which are simply insulting nicknames for Ganner.) *Olob (full name Barangarolob) ‚Äì the faithful horse that pulled Clennen the Singer's cart in all the travels. Olob had a special sense that made him whinny and misbehave when enemies were near. Olob was killed by a stray Southern bullet in the attack on Fennpass, and this event energised Moril into magic-making on his cwidder. Explanation of the novel's title The novel's title refers to the cart in which Singers travel around South and North Dalemark and the cwidder, a lute-like string instrument played by Singers as an accompaniment to their songs and stories.

It is a distant relative of its 18th-century predecessor, konfederatka (because of use by members of the Bar Confederation), although similar caps have been used by light cavalry since the 14th century. It consists of a four-pointed top and a short peak, usually made of black or brown leather. Although rogatywka (derived from r√≥g which means horn or corner) in English seems to mean the same as czapka, the word 'czapka' in Polish designates not only rogatywka, but all caps (not hats). Konfederatka The konfederatka was based on the hats of the Lithuanian Tatar national costumes of the 18th century, as the Vanguard regiments of the army of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was heavily influenced by the dress of Lithuanian Tatars, among other elements. Usage The rogatywka usually comes in two variants: the hardened and soft version. The hardened model, based on the rogatywka Mk. 1935, olive green with black peak, is used in full gala uniforms, while the rim colour marks unit type (for example, navy blue - typical, scarlet - military police, green - artillery, and so on). It was not worn during most of the People's Republic of Poland era but was reintroduced for ceremonial wear by the Honour Guard Company in 1983. The soft version was used before World War II and during the People's Republic of Poland period for garrison dress; it was withdrawn after 1990. Polish soldiers, unlike those of most military forces, decorate their caps not with the emblem of their corps, but with their service's version of the Polish military eagle. The military eagle insignia is based on an early 19th-century design, comprising a modified White Eagle (from the Polish coat of arms) perched atop an 'amazon shield'. Army branches are indicated by the following colored cap bands: * navy blue ‚Äì generals, mechanized troops, legal corps, logistics corps, National Honour Guard * orange ‚Äì units dedicated to honour historical armoured troops, scouts * dark green ‚Äì rocket forces, artillery, anti-aircraft units * black ‚Äì engineering units, chemical corps, cartographic service, technical cadets * cornflower ‚Äì adjutant general corps, radio and communication corps * cherry ‚Äì medical service, medical cadets * scarlet ‚Äì military police * violet ‚Äì chaplains * yellow ‚Äì headquarters of 1st Warsaw Mechanized Division, 1st Warsaw Armoured Division Others The rogatywka is used by Polish firefighters (hardened, all navy blue) and Polish State Railways staff (soft, navy blue or red). Green rogatywkas with brown leather peak and scout Fleur- de-lis symbol are traditionally worn by Polish boy scouts, while grey caps are sometimes used by girl guides.

It can be found from Australia to Korea, Japan and India. Taxonomy and systematics The oriental dollarbird was originally described in the genus Coracias. Formerly, some authorities have also considered the broad-billed roller and the azure dollarbird to have been subspecies of the oriental dollarbird. Alternate names for the oriental dollarbird include the Asian dollarbird, dark roller, dollar roller, dollarbird, eastern broad-billed roller and oriental broad-billed roller. The generic name derives from Ancient Greek eurustomos 'wide-mouthed' and the specific epithet is Latin orientalis 'eastern'. =Subspecies= Keulemans, 1892 Ten subspecies are recognized: * E. o. cyanocollis - Vieillot, 1819: Found from the Himalayas through China to south-eastern Siberia, Korea and Japan * E. o. orientalis - (Linnaeus, 1766): Found from the southern Himalayas to Indochina, the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Java, Borneo and the Philippines * E. o. laetior - Sharpe, 1890: Found in south-western India * E. o. gigas - Stresemann, 1913: Found on southern Andaman Islands * E. o. irisi - Deraniyagala, 1951: Found in Sri Lanka * E. o. oberholseri - Junge, 1936: Found on Simeulue (off north-western Sumatra) * Australian roller (E. o. pacificus) - (Latham, 1801): Originally described as a separate species in the genus Coracias. Found on the Lesser Sunda Islands, northern and eastern Australia * E. o. waigiouensis - Elliot, DG, 1871: Originally described as a separate species. Found on New Guinea, western Papuan islands, D'Entrecasteaux Islands and the Louisiade Archipelago * E. o. crassirostris - Sclater, PL, 1869: Originally described as a separate species. Found in the Bismarck Archipelago * E. o. solomonensis - Sharpe, 1890: Originally described as a separate species. Found in the Solomon Islands Description The oriental dollarbird has a length of up to 30 cm. It is dark brown but this is heavily washed with a bluish-green sheen on the back and wing coverts. Its belly and undertail coverts are light coloured, and it has glossy bright blue colouring on its throat and undertail. Its flight feathers are a darker blue. Its bill is short and wide and in mature animals is coloured orange-red with a black tip. It has very light blue patches on the outer parts of its wings which are highly visible in flight and for which it is named. The females are slightly duller than the males but overall the two are very similar. Immature birds are much duller than the adults and do not have the blue colouring on their throats. They also have brown bills and feet instead of the red of the adults.http://www.birdsinbackyards.net/species/Eurystomus-orientalis Distribution and habitat The oriental dollarbird is found from Australia to Japan and India. It breeds in northern and eastern Australia between the months of September and April and winters in New Guinea and nearby islands. The birds prefer open wooded areas with hollow-bearing trees to build nests in.  Behaviour and ecology  The oriental dollarbird is most commonly seen singly with a distinctive upright silhouette on a bare branch high in a tree, from which it hawks for insects, returning to the same perch after a few seconds.

Jamestown was launched in 1844 by the Gosport Navy Yard, Virginia; and commissioned there on 12 December, with Commander Robert B. Cunningham in command. Service history =Africa, Ireland, 1845‚Äì1850= She departed Hampton Roads on 25 June 1845 as flagship of Commodore Charles W. Skinner in command of United States naval vessels operating off the western coast of Africa to suppress the slave trade. At the end of her first deployment the sloop arrived at Boston, Massachusetts on 6 August 1846. While she was moored at the Boston Navy Yard word reached the United States that for the second consecutive year blight had ruined the potato crop of Ireland, depriving the people of that country of their chief means of subsistence. A joint resolution of Congress approved 3 March 1847 authorized the Secretary of the Navy to place Jamestown and at the disposal of Captains Robert Bennet Forbes and George Coleman De Kay to carry food to the starving poor of Ireland. Jamestown sailed from Boston on 28 March and arrived at Cork, Ireland on 12 April. After unloading her life-saving cargo, the sloop returned to Boston on 17 May. As flagship of Commodore William Compton Bolton, Jamestown again stood out of Boston on 22 July to operate on the west coast of Africa. A year later she was transferred to the Mediterranean Squadron to assist in protecting American citizens and interests during the epidemic of revolutions which convulsed Europe in 1848. After political conditions became more stable, Jamestown returned to Norfolk, Virginia on 4 May 1850. =South America, Africa, West Indies, 1851‚Äì1860= After a year at home, she was assigned to the Brazil Squadron departing Norfolk on 1 June 1851 to begin operations off South America lasting until her return to Philadelphia Navy Yard on 2 May 1854. She decommissioned there nine days later. Recommissioning on 22 February 1855, Jamestown sailed as flagship of the African Squadron under Commodore Thomas Crabbe, departing Key West on 9 June and returning to Philadelphia on 2 June 1857 and decommissioning. She re- commissioned on 16 December and cruised the West Indies with the Home Squadron until decommissioning at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on 14 February 1860. =Civil War, 1861‚Äì1865= USS Jamestown, right foreground, burns the bark Alvarado, in the distance at left, near Fernandina, Florida, on 5 August 1861\\\\. Illustration from Harper's Weekly, 28 September 1861.After the outbreak of the Civil War, Jamestown re-commissioned on 5 June 1861 and was assigned to the Atlantic Blockading Squadron, where she compiled a record of outstanding efficiency. The sloop chased the bark Alvarado ashore off Fernandina, Florida and set her on fire on 5 August, and captured the schooner Aigburth off the coast of Florida on 31 August 1861. Four days later she captured, dismantled, and scuttled the schooner Colonel Long. Next she captured the schooner Havelock on 15 December. Her final prize was the brig Intended, taken off Wilmington, North Carolina on 1 May 1862. Jamestown departed for the Pacific on 12 October to protect American commerce from Confederate privateers; and she remained on that duty until after the end of the war, decommissioning at Mare Island on 17 September 1865. =Pacific, 1866‚Äì1881= Having been converted to a transport and store ship, she recommissioned on 3 September 1866 to serve at Panama as a store and hospital ship. Because of fever on board, Jamestown was ordered north on 2 April 1867 and was disinfected at San Francisco, California. Joining the North Pacific Squadron, she served as guard and storeship at Sitka, Alaska, from 11 September 1867 until 30 May 1868. Jamestown was present at the hoisting of the U.S. Flag at Sitka on 18 October 1867 after Alaska was purchased from Russia. Jamestown arrived at Mare Island on 23 July 1868; decommissioned there on 13 August; and recommissioned on 25 January 1869, following repairs. For almost three years, Jamestown cruised the Pacific on the west coasts of North and South America, and as far west as Tahiti and the Fiji and Hawaiian Islands. Decommissioning on 7 October 1871, Jamestown was placed in ordinary at Mare Island until 16 March 1876 when she recommissioned for use as a State Public Marine School. She operated at the Hawaiian Islands in this capacity until she was returned to the Navy Department and decommissioned on 3 March 1879. She was recommissioned on 8 May and sailed for Sitka, Alaska, where she surveyed the harbor and protected American interests. In 1881, she sailed the Pacific until decommissioning at San Francisco on 21 September. =Training and hospital ship, 1882‚Äì1913= Having been fitted out as an apprentice training ship, Jamestown recommissioned on 14 February 1882 and proceeded to the Atlantic coast via Cape Horn. In her new capacity, she sailed the Atlantic Ocean, voyaging to the West Indies, Spain, and as far north as the State of Maine. While at the Brooklyn Navy Yard on 20 December 1883, Landsman J. W. Norris and Ordinary Seaman Robert Augustus Sweeney jumped overboard and rescued a man from drowning, for which they were each awarded the Medal of Honor. On 31 August 1888, Jamestown decommissioned at Norfolk. Recommissioning 13 April 1889, Jamestown cruised to France and to the West Indies with apprentices, and decommissioned again on 6 September 1892 at Norfolk. On 9 September she was transferred to the Treasury Department for Marine Hospital Service for quarantine purposes in Hampton Roads. She was destroyed by fire at the Norfolk Navy Yard on 3 January 1913, after being returned to the Navy Department.

She was built in 1927 as an ocean liner and refrigerated cargo ship, converted in 1929 into a cruise ship and requisitioned as a troopship in the Second World War. At the end of June 1940 she was assigned the task of transporting Italian and German civilians among a small number of prisoners of war to Canada. On 2 July 1940 she was sunk in controversial circumstances by a German U-boat with a large loss of life, 805 people. Construction In 1925 Blue Star ordered a set of new liners for its new London ‚Äì Rio de Janeiro ‚Äì Buenos Aires route. Cammell Laird of Birkenhead built three sister ships: Almeda, Andalucia and Arandora. John Brown & Company of Clydebank built two: Avelona and Avila. Together the quintet came to be called the \\"luxury five\\". Cammell Laird launched Arandora on 4 January 1927 and completed her in May. As originally built she measured , was long, had a beam of and accommodated 164 first class passengers. She had a service speed of . A major refit in 1929 reduced her cargo space and increased her passenger accommodation to turn her into a cruise ship. Peacetime service As Arandora she sailed from London to the east coast of South America from 1927 to 1928. In 1929 she was sent to Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company Limited of Glasgow for refitting. In the refit, her gross tonnage was increased to 14,694 and first class accommodation was increased to 354 passengers. A tennis court was also placed aft of the funnels on the boat deck and a swimming pool was installed in the after well deck. Upon completion, she returned to service as a full-time luxury cruise ship. At the time of this refit, she was also renamed Arandora Star. The renaming was done to avoid confusion with Royal Mail Ships which typically bore names beginning and ending in \\"A\\". As a cruise ship Arandora Star was based mainly in Southampton, and voyaged to many different destinations, calling in some instances at home ports such as Immingham. Cruises included Norway, the Northern capitals, the Mediterranean, the West Indies, Panama, Cuba, and Florida. Arandora Star also had two unique nicknames because of her colour scheme of a white hull with scarlet ribbon. The nicknames most frequently used were \\"The Wedding Cake\\" or the \\"Chocolate Box\\". Second World War service When the Second World War broke out in September 1939, Arandora Star was en route from Cherbourg to New York. She returned to Britain via Halifax, Nova Scotia, where she joined the very first HX-series convoy, Convoy HX 1. At the end of September, the Admiralty assessed the ship at Dartmouth, Devon and decided she was unsuitable for conversion to an armed merchant cruiser. In December, she was ordered to Avonmouth where she was fitted with the Admiralty Net Defence anti-torpedo system, consisting of underwater wire mesh suspended from booms either side of the ship. She was fitted out at Avonmouth and then spent three months based at Portsmouth testing nets of various gauges in the English Channel. On tests the system was successful at catching torpedoes and reduced Arandora Stars speed by only . In March 1940, the ship was sent to Devonport where the equipment was removed. She was then sent to Liverpool for orders. On 30 May, the ship left Liverpool for Norway to help evacuate Allied troops. She sailed unescorted to Harstad, where she embarked 1,600 personnel; most of them members of the Royal Air Force in addition to some French and Polish troops. She left Harstad on 7 June and took her evacuees to Glasgow. On 14 June, the ship left Glasgow en route for Brest, in Brittany, to rescue troops and refugees. Continuous Luftwaffe attacks on the port and town prevented her from entering, and only 12 refugees managed to get out by boat to the ship. Arandora Star escaped with the aid of a destroyer, which provided anti- aircraft cover and came under heavy air attack. The liner took her handful of evacuees to Falmouth, where she bunkered. She then went to Quiberon Bay, on the Bay of Biscay, where she evacuated about 300 people from Saint-Nazaire on 17 June. Sources disagree whether she took these to Falmouth or Plymouth. Arandora Stars trip to Saint-Nazaire was fairly uneventful; the same day, Luftwaffe aircraft sank at the port killing several thousand people. Arandora Stars next trip to France was to the southwest, near the border with Spain. There she found Bayonne under Luftwaffe attack, but assisted by a destroyer, she picked up about 500 people who were in an overloaded small craft adrift off the beach. These she took to Falmouth, before returning to the same area. She entered Saint-Jean-de-Luz, where some Polish troops were trapped. She embarked roughly 1,700 troops and refugees, including the Polish staff, and left just in time as Luftwaffe aircraft approached to bomb the town. She took her evacuees to Liverpool. Sinking What became Arandora Stars final voyage, was the transport of Italian and German internees as well as German prisoners of war to Canada. In Liverpool on 27‚Äì30 June, she embarked 734 interned Italian men, 479 interned German men, 86 German prisoners of war, and 200 military guards, in addition to her crew of 174 officers and men. Her Master was Captain Edgar Wallace Moulton. The ship was bound for St John's, Newfoundland, and her internees for Canadian internment camps. Sources disagree as to whether the ship left Liverpool on 30 June, or at 4 h on 2 July 1940. She sailed unescorted, and early on the morning of 2 July she was about 75 miles west of Bloody Foreland when she was torpedoed. , commanded by G√ºnther Prien, struck Arandora Star with a single torpedo. Prien believed the torpedo to be faulty, but it detonated against Arandora Stars starboard side, flooding her aft engine room. All engine room personnel, including two engineer officers, were killed. Her turbines, main generators and emergency generators were all immediately put out of action and therefore knocked out all lights and communications aboard. Chief officer Frederick Brown gave the ship's position to the radio officer, who transmitted a distress signal. At 7:05 hours Malin Head radio acknowledged the message and retransmitted to Land's End and to Portpatrick. =Lifeboats= Otto Burfeind The cruise ship carried 14 lifeboats and 90 liferafts. The torpedo destroyed one starboard lifeboat and disabled the davits and falls of another. Two lifeboats were damaged during their launch and thus useless. The crew successfully launched the remaining 10 lifeboats and more than half the liferafts. Some lifeboats were overloaded by prisoners descending the falls and side ladders, but many of the Italians were afraid to leave the ship. At least four of the remaining lifeboats were launched with a very small number of survivors. One other lifeboat was swamped and sank shortly after being launched. One of the internees was Captain Otto Burfeind, who had been interned after scuttling his ship, the . Burfeind stayed aboard Arandora Star organizing her evacuation until she sank and he was lost. The ship listed further to starboard. At 7:15, Captain Moulton and his senior officers walked over the side into the rising water, leaving behind many Italians who were still afraid to leave the ship. At 7:20, the ship rolled over, raised her bow in the air and sank. 805 people were killed, including Captain Moulton, 12 of his officers, 42 of his crew and 37 of the military guards. =Rescue= HMCS St. Laurent rescued 868 survivors from Arandora Star At 9:30, an RAF Coastal Command Short Sunderland flying boat flew over and dropped watertight bags containing first aid kits, food, cigarettes, and a message that help was coming. The aircraft circled until 13:00, when the Canadian C-class destroyer HMCS St. Laurent arrived and rescued 868 survivors, of whom 586 were detainees. The injured were taken to Mearnskirk Hospital in Newton Mearns, Glasgow. One of the survivors was the athletics coach Franz Stampfl. On 3 July, the UK War Cabinet received a report on the disaster. Its impact was overshadowed by the Royal Navy attack on Mers- el-K√©bir, French Algeria, that sank elements of the French battle fleet. Throughout July and August, bodies were washed up on the Irish shore. On 30 July, the first body was found; 71-year-old Ernesto Moruzzi, who was found at Cloughglass, Burtonport. Four others were found on the same day. During August 1940, 213 bodies washed up on the Irish coast, of which 35 were from Arandora Star and a further 92 unidentified, potentially from the ship. =Citations= Captain Moulton was posthumously awarded Lloyd's War Medal for Bravery at Sea. Captain Burfeind was posthumously cited for his heroism in the evacuation, and the Canadian commander Harry DeWolf was cited for his heroism in the rescue. Wreck and memorials The wreck's position is . In the weeks following the Arandora Stars sinking many bodies of those who died were carried by the sea to various points in Ireland and the Hebrides. In the small graveyard of Termoncarragh, Belmullet, County Mayo, Luigi Tapparo, an internee from Edinburgh, and John Connelly, a Lovat Scout, lie buried side by side. Belmullet garda√≠ received a call from Annagh Head that another body had been found. From a service book on the body, Garda Sergeant Burns identified 27-year-old Frank Carter from Kilburn, London, a trooper in the Royal Dragoons. The body of Cesare Camozzi (1891‚Äì1940) from Iseo, Italy was washed ashore on the Inishowen peninsula, County Donegal and is buried at Sacred Heart graveyard, Carndonagh. 46 German civilian detainees, who were being shipped from England to Canada for internment when the ship sank, are buried in the German war cemetery in Glencree, County Wicklow. The body of EG Lane from Kingsteignton, Newton Abbot, Devon, England, a private in the Devonshire Regiment, was washed onto the beach near Ballycastle, County Mayo and is buried in the local cemetery. His grave was re-dedicated in 2009 by the Mayo Peace Park Committee. An unidentified sailor, unrecognisable other than for a tattoo bearing the name \\"Chrissie\\", was washed ashore near Newhouse, on the Atlantic coast of Kintyre, Argyll and, after official investigation, buried at the local churchyard of Killean, Kintyre, Argyll. A memorial chapel was built in a cemetery in Bardi, home town of 48 of the dead, and an annual commemorative mass is held in the town. A street in Bardi was renamed Via Arandora Star. Memorial to the dead of the Arandora Star at St Peter's Italian Church, London, unveiled in 1960 St Peter's Italian Church in Clerkenwell, London, unveiled a wall memorial in 1960, and added a second memorial to London victims in 2012. In 2004 the Italian town of Lucca unveiled a monument to 31 local men lost in the sinking, located in the courtyard of the museum of the Paolo Cresci Foundation for the History of Italian Emigration.. There is also a Via Arandora Star in Parma. Numerous bodies were found on the Scottish island of Colonsay. A memorial was unveiled on Colonsay on 2 July 2005, the 65th anniversary of the tragedy, at the cliff where the body of Giuseppe Delgrosso was found. A bronze memorial plaque was unveiled on 2 July 2008 at the Church of Our Lady and St Nicholas, Liverpool. It was relocated to the Pier Head in front of the old Mersey Docks and Harbour Board building after building work was finished. In 2009, the 69th anniversary of the sinking, the Mayor of Middlesbrough unveiled a memorial in the town hall commemorating the town's 13 interned Italians held in cells there prior to deportation and death on the Arandora Stars final voyage. On 2 July 2010, the 70th anniversary of the sinking, a new memorial was unveiled in St David's Roman Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral, Cardiff by the Arandora Star Memorial Fund in Wales. Italian Cloister Garden Memorial by St Andrew's Cathedral, Glasgow On the same day, 2 July 2010, a memorial cloister garden was opened next to St Andrew's Roman Catholic Cathedral, Glasgow. Archbishop Mario Conti said at the time he hoped the monument would be a \\"fitting symbol\\" of the friendship between Scotland and Italy. The wreck of one of the lifeboats remains visible at Knockvologan beach on the Ross of Mull, largely buried but with its iron suspension hooks still above the sand. Photographs of the lifeboat remains in 1969, as well as an eyewitness account by a Ms. Bella MacLennanin can be found in the citation. A 2006 picture shows the build up of sand over time.

Versions have also been performed in movies and on television. Comedians Harry Steppe, Joey Faye, and Samuel Goldman each laid claim to this routine, also referred to as \\"The Stranger with a Kind Face\\" by clowns, \\"Niagara Falls\\" by fans of The Three Stooges and Abbott and Costello, \\"Martha\\" by fans of I Love Lucy, \\"Pokomoko\\", and \\"Bagel Street\\". Routine The routine features a man recounting the day he took his revenge on his enemy ‚Äì and becoming so engrossed in his own tale that he attacks the innocent listener to whom he is speaking. The attacker comes to his senses, only to go berserk again when the listener says something that triggers the old memory again. Typically, the routine has two characters meeting for the first time, with one of them becoming highly agitated over the utterance of particular words. Names and cities (such as Niagara Falls) have been used as the trigger, which then sends the unbalanced person into a state of mania; the implication is that the words have an unpleasant association in the character's past. While the other character merely acts bewildered, the crazed character relives the incident, uttering the words, \\"Slowly I turned ... step by step ... inch by inch...,\\" as he approaches the stunned onlooker. Reacting as if this stranger is the object of his rage, the angry character begins hitting or strangling him, until the screams of the victim shake him out of his delusion. The character then apologizes, admitting his irrational reaction to the mention of those certain words. This follows with the victim innocently repeating the words, sparking the insane reaction all over again. This pattern is repeated in various forms, sometimes with the entrance of a third actor, uninformed as to the situation. This third person predictably ends up mentioning the words and setting off the manic character, but with the twist that the second character, not this new third person, is still the recipient of the violence. Depictions Abbott and Costello performed the \\"Pokomoko\\" version in their 1944 film Lost in a Harem, and later did a \\"Niagara Falls\\" version for their early '50s television show, with Sidney Fields, who played many characters, as the delusional man beating Costello while they were both locked in a jail cell. The television version ended with Costello‚Äôs troublesome lawyer, also played by Fields, entering the scene. Costello asks for the lawyer to take the case of the storytelling stranger, and the lawyer says, \\"Help him out? I don‚Äôt know anything about him! What‚Äôs his name? Where is he from?\\" Costello whispers in the Fields' ear, to which he responds aloud, \\"Niagara Falls?\\" and then he is immediately attacked. Another variation on the Abbott and Costello Show was the Susquehanna Hat Company/Bagel Street routine, also done as the Floogle Street routine. The Three Stooges performed the sketch (as part of the show they put on within the movie, as they play performers) in Gents Without Cents, a 1944 short. In their version, the final punchline is that the third character to arrive (played by Larry) is, in fact, the object of the hate of the storyteller (played by Moe). However, even though Curly (who has just been repeatedly beaten up by Moe and Larry, who is also triggered by the sketch‚Äôs word, which is \\"Niagara Falls\\") eggs him on, Moe refuses to attack Larry and instead they make peace. Curly then says \\"Niagara Falls\\" and both Moe and Larry chase him off the stage and at the end of the short when the Stooges and their new wives driving on their honeymoon. Moe would later perform a version of the sketch on his own as the storyteller on an episode of The Mike Douglas Show. The routine also appears in episode 19, \\"The Ballet\\" of season 1 of I Love Lucy, with Lucy playing the stranger with a kind face and a clown playing the storyteller, with the trigger word \\"Martha\\". Lucille Ball later performed the \\"Martha\\" version on CBS Opening Night in 1963, now playing the vagabond storyteller herself, with Phil Silvers as the stranger with the kind face. Danny Thomas and Joey Faye reprised the routine in Season 8, episode 20 (\\"Good Old Burlesque\\") of the Danny Thomas Show. Hawkeye Pierce (played by Alan Alda) references this routine in the second-season M*A*S*H episode \\"Dr. Pierce and Mr. Hyde\\", in which the sleep-deprived surgeon insists on responding to an ambulance arrival. Steve Martin's character Rigby Reardon had a similar trigger, the words \\"cleaning woman\\", in his film noir homage Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid. Milton Berle's performance of this routine was played on the Dr. Demento radio show several times using the trigger word \\"Buffalo\\". The lyrics of Native Love by the drag singer Divine are based on this routine, along with Don't Call Me Dude by eclectic thrash metal band Scatterbrain. Performing this routine on Your Show of Shows in the early 1950s, Sid Caesar plays the poor sap who gets beaten up, and Imogene Coca plays a distraught manic lamenting her life with \\"Jeffery\\", the trigger word, who is prevented from throwing herself off the Empire State Building by Caesar's character. In the end, she runs off just as another woman comes running over to jump off the building. Caesar stops her, but rather than go through all that again, he jumps off instead.

The Vai are known for their indigenous syllabic writing system known as Vai syllabary, developed in the 1820s by Momolu Duwalu Bukele and other tribal elders. Over the course of the 19th century, literacy in the writing system became widespread. Its use declined over the 20th century, but modern computer technology may enable a revival. The Vai people speak the Vai language, which is of the Mande languages. The Sierra Leonean Vai are predominantly found in Pujehun District (around the Liberian border) . Many Sierra Leonean villages that border Liberia are populated by the Vai. In total only about 1200 Vai live in Sierra Leone.Sierra Leone 2015 Population and Housing Census national analytical report. Statistics Sierra Leone, October 2017, p89‚Äì99. Group of Vai women and girls, 1907 History The earliest written documentation of the Vai is by Dutch merchants sometime in the first half of the seventeenth century, denoting a political group near Cape Mount. The Vai likely settled there as part of the Mane invasions from the Mali Empire in the middle of the sixteenth century and, according to Vai oral tradition were led by the brothers F√°bule and Kƒ´at√°mba in conquering the land down to the coast. Culture and education In many aspects, the Vai are a unique African ethnicity. Many believe that the region inhabited by the Vai is the original home of the Poro, a male secret society known throughout West Africa. The Vai are also quite musical. They play many instruments and perform dances on special occasions. The Vai have three types of schooling. The first and most important is the bush school, where the children learn traditional Vai socialization skills, important survival skills, and other traits of village life for four to five years. Second is the English school; some Vai children attend English schools to learn the English language. Finally, there are the Quranic schools, where Vai children are taught the Arabic language under the guidance of the local Muslim religious leader. Vai script Religion and spiritual belief The Vai are predominantly Muslim, and have for centuries practiced traditions rooted in studying the Quran, with a minority being Christian. These monotheistic religions however coexist with traditional beliefs in the supernatural, and shamanistic practices are common as people consider themselves to be surrounded by spirits that can change into living creatures or objects. These spirits are believed to have the power to do evil to individuals or to the whole tribe. The Vai perform ceremonies for the dead in which they leave articles of clothing and food near the graves of the deceased. Economy Most Vai make their living by farming the fertile land. Rice is their staple crop and can be cultivated with other vegetables on upland plots of cleared land. In addition to rice, crops such as cotton, corn, pumpkins, bananas, ginger, coffee, and cocoa are raised. The Vai also gather various nuts and berries from the forests. The palm tree is an important commodity to the Vai. Nuts, butter, wine, fuel, soap, and baskets are among its many derivatives.

The simplest form of set square is a triangular piece of transparent plastic (or formerly of polished wood) with the centre removed. More commonly the set square bears the markings of a ruler and a half circle protractor. The outer edges are typically bevelled. These set squares come in two usual forms, both right triangles: one with 90-45-45 degree angles, the other with 30-60-90 degree angles. Combining the two forms by placing the hypotenuses together will also yield 15¬∞ and 75¬∞ angles. They are often purchased in packs with protractors and compasses. Less commonly found is the adjustable set square. Here, the body of the object is cut in half and rejoined with a hinge marked with angles. Adjustment to the marked angle will produce any desired angle up to a maximum of 180¬∞.  Geodreieck  In many European countries, the most common form of set square combines a 90-45-45 triangle with a protractor into a single tool made of clear plastic. Named \\"Geodreieck\\" (German colloquial short form of \\"Geometrie-Dreieck\\", meaning \\"geometry triangle\\"), it was originally developed and trademarked by the German-Austrian manufacturer Aristo-Instrumente Dennert KG (now GEOtec Zeichen- und Kunststofftechnik GmbH) in 1964.

Though a Rakshasa himself, Vibhishana was younger brother of raavana , Vibhishana deserted Ravana and joined Rama's army. Later, when Rama defeated Ravana, Rama crowned Vibhishana as the king of Lanka before returning to Ayodhya. In the Ramayana Rama and Sita worship god Shiva at Rameshwaram as Vibhishana (right) looks on with Lakshaman, Tumburu and Narada Vibhishana had a sattvic (pure) mind and a sattvic heart. From his early childhood, he spent all his time meditating on the name of the Lord. Eventually, Brahma appeared and offered him any boon he wanted. Vibhishana said that the only thing he wanted was to have his mind fixed at the feet of the Lord as pure as lotus leaves (charan kamal). He prayed that he should be given the strength by which he would always be at the feet of the Lord and that he would receive the darshan (holy sight) of Lord Vishnu. This prayer was fulfilled when he was able to give up all his wealth and family, and join Rama, who was Avatar of Lord Vishnu (God incarnate). Vibhishana was the youngest son of Kaikesi and Sage Vishrava, who was himself a son of Sage Pulatsya, one of the Heavenly Guardians. He (Vibhishana) was the younger brother of the Lord of Lanka, Ravana and Kumbakarna. Even though he was born in the demon race, he was alert and pious and considered himself a Brahmin, since his father was intuitively such. When Kaikesi, daughter of the demon Sumali, expressed to Vishrava her wish to become his wife, Vishrava said that due to her asking this wish at such an inauspicious time that their children would be born with horrible body structure and cruel nature. Hearing this, Kaikesi fell at the Brahmin's foot and began crying. Observing this, Vishrava said that destiny could not be changed, but due to Kaikesi's devotion and actions as a dutiful wife that their youngest son would be born with normal body structure and a pious mind though the others would remain same. Due to Vibhishana's differences with Ravana, because he was against the act of kidnapping Sita and most of all because Ravana wanted the throne for himself, he fled Lanka. His mother, Kaikesi, advised him to go and serve Shri Rama, who was at that time assembling an army to conquer Ravana and to recover Sita. He divulged the secrets of Ravana's army and made sure Rama was victorious in the great battle. Lord Rama accepted Vibhishana's service and anointed him the Lord of Lanka after Ravana's death. In the Lanka War, Vibhishana's knowledge about the secrets of Lanka proved invaluable to Shri Rama. Vibhishana freely divulged many secrets that became key to the success of Rama's attack, including revealing the secret path to the temple of Mata Nikumbala, the family deity of the Pulatsya Clan. In the climactic battle between Rama and Ravana, when Rama was unable to kill Ravana, he revealed the secret of Ravana's death to Rama. He told Rama that Ravana has stored the nectar of immortality in his belly and it is necessary to dry it. With this knowledge, Rama was finally able to kill Ravana. In the Ramayana, Vibhishana's characterization assists in demonstrating the practical implications of the concept of Dharma. The epic stresses that neither Vibhishana or Kumbhakarna strayed from the path of Dharma and that there is no single way out of a moral dilemma. The Ramayana teaches that Kumbhakarna adhered to the Dharma of loyalty to his kin when his advice fails, while Vibhishana chose to oppose his kin when his advice failed. Symbolically, Vibhishana represents a devotion to Shri Rama and as a demon devotee, he shows that the Lord does not distinguish between his followers based on birth or circumstances in life. A similar theme may be found in the story of Prahlada and Narasimha. When Vibhishana attained the position of the King of Lanka, he turned his subjects from the path of evil to the path of Dharma (righteousness). His wife, Queen Sarama also aided him in this effort. He had a daughter named AnalTe. When Rama was about to leave Ayodhya at the end of his reign, Lord Rama in his original form of Shri Vishnu ordered Vibhishana to stay on earth and serve the people and guide them to the path of truth and Dharma. Hence, Vibhishana is considered one of the seven immortals or Chiranjeevins. Lord Vishnu also ordered Vibhishana to pray the family deity of Sun Dynasty, Lord Ranganatha. Legends Vibishana is attached with the legend of Srirangam Ranganathaswamy temple, considered the abode of Vishnu on earth and the primary temple of Vishnu on earth. During the coronation of Rama, the avatar of Vishnu, Vibishana was presented the sacrosanct Sri Ranga Vimana. He was carrying it all the way to his kingdom of Sri Lanka and midway, to rest, he placed the image on the banks of Kaveri. After performing his routine pooja, he tried to lift the Vimana, but it could not be lifted. Mahavishnu appeared to him and said that he desired to stay as Ranganatha in the place, which went on to become Srirangam. Vishnu also desired to watch the Brahmotsavam at Tirucherai. The festivals of the temple are thus considered sacred. In some period of history Sinhalese people have considered Vibhishana as one of the Sathara Waram Deviyo (four guardian deities). This belief was more prominent in the Kotte period. According to the Ravana Katha of Wickramasinghe Adigar, after the defeat of Ravana, Vibhishana transferred the Yaksha capital from Alaka mandawa to Kelaniya.Dr. Mirando Obeysekere, Was Maya Dannawa the architect of Sigiriya?, Daily News, 6 March 2003. http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~lkawgw/mdannawa.html In the 15th- century poem of Thotagamuwe Sri Rahula Thera, the s√¶lalihini sandesaya, Myna is ordered to carry the missive to Vibhishana at his temple in Kelaniya. After the 16th century, he was replaced as a God of the four warrants by the goddess Pattini. He continues to be worshipped by a diminishing number of adherents, mainly in the Kelaniya area.Nandasena Ratnapala, Folklore of Sri Lanka, State Printing Corporation, Colombo, 1991; References See also Category:Rakshasa in the Ramayana Category:Chiranjivins Category:Characters in the Ramayana ","title":"Vibhishana"},{"id":"2075899","text":"Steve Hodson (born Bradford, West Riding of Yorkshire, 5 November 1947) is a British actor who played the role of Steve Ross in Follyfoot.Follyfoot- tv.co.uk - Steve Hodson profile Hodson was working as a civil servant in Bradford when he won a place at the Central School of Speech and Drama in London.

Biography  Born in Istanbul in 1938, Sarkis studied French, painting and interior design before moving to Paris in 1964. In 1967, he won the painting prize at the Biennale de Paris and presented his work Connaissez-vous Joseph Beuys ? at the Salon de Mai, in a reference to the man he considered the most important artist of the day. In 1969 he was invited by the critic and curator Harald Szeemann to take part in the now legendary show When Attitudes Become Form. Teaching and the sharing of experience are key concerns of this artist. From 1980 to 1990 he was director of the Art Department at the √âcole des Arts D√©coratifs in Strasbourg, and from 1988 to 1995 he ran a seminar at the Institut des Hautes Etudes en Arts Plastiques created by Pontus Hulten. Since the 1980s, Sarkis has taken part in numerous international exhibitions (including Documenta and the biennials in Venice, Sydney, Istanbul and Moscow) and had his work shown in the world‚Äôs leading museums. In the exhibition Passages at the Pompidou Centre in 2010, works by Sarkis were allowed to dialogue with works by Kasimir Malevich, the wall from Andr√© Breton‚Äôs studio, and Plight by Joseph Beuys, who is one of Sarkis‚Äôs sources of inspiration, along with the Russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky, one of whose films he explored in the Brancusi studio. Passages evoked both the permanent back-and- forth between an artist‚Äôs studio and the museum, and Walter Benjamin‚Äôs great unfinished work about the arcades of Paris. The exhibition featured a series of recent or specially created works produced by the Pompidou Centre. These works, standing as the artist‚Äôs KRIEGSSCHATZ (trophies), comprised found objects, art works and ethnographic objects from different civilizations. In 2011 the Mus√©e d‚ÄôArt Moderne et Contemporain in Geneva (MAMCO) devoted an important retrospective to the artist entitled H√¥tel Sarkis. The presentation on four floors brought together 200 works created between 1971 and 2011, and explored the artist‚Äôs different practices (video and sound installations, watercolours, photographs, films) and thus amplified the resonance of a body of work produced in response to other artists, whether musicians, architects, writers, philosophers, painters, sculptors or filmmakers. In 2012, Sarkis presented Ballads in the 5000 square metres of the underwater Hangars, at the invitation of the Museum Boijmans van Beuningen and the Port of Rotterdam, as well as Ailleurs, Ici on the estate of Chaumont-sur-Loire, following a commission by the regional council of Centre.

In 2013, Sarkis took part in the exhibition When Attitudes Become Form, Bern 1969/Venice 2013 at the Prada Foundation as part of the 55th Venice Biennale. He also showed at Passages Crois√©s en or at the Ch√¢teau d‚ÄôAngers, and was invited to present his Frise de Guerre at the Museum of Old and New Art (MONA) in Tasmania as part of the exhibition The Red Queen.

Early life and career Shabalala was born in the town of Ladysmith (eMnambithi district) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa. His parents, Jonathan Mluwane Shabalala and Nomandla Elina Shabalala, raised Joseph and his six siblings on a white-owned farm called Tugela. His father died in the late 1940s; Joseph, being the eldest, had to take care of the family. He left the farm, however, in 1958 to search for work in the nearby city of Durban. During this time, he was spotted by a well-known group, the Durban Choir, after he delighted audiences with his smooth guitar playing and soprano voice. When he joined the choir, he attempted to teach them some of his new compositions, namely his first song \\"Nomathemba\\" (which was made into a play in 1995). They refused, and so he left them after only two years. In 1958, Shabalala discovered an isicathamiya group, The Highlanders, led by his hero Galiyane Hlatshwayo. Hlatshwayo was the man who encouraged Shabalala to use his voice powerfully. Shabalala formed his own group the following year 1959, Ezimnyama (\\"The Black Ones\\"). A series of dreams he had in his sleep in December 1960 was a major turning point in the formation of the group; when he saw how well his group did in the once-weekly isicathamiya competitions, he renamed them Ladysmith Black Mambazo, \\"Mambazo\\" meaning axe, referring to how the group chopped down the other choirs by winning almost every time. After local radio airplay (on the S.A.B.C. station Radio Zulu), Shabalala accepted a recording contract that was offered in 1972 by Gallo Music producer West Nkosi. The group sold over 40,000 copies of their first album and continued to do so through other recordings. In 1976, he became a Christian, and the songs in the Mambazo repertoire were shuffled to one side to include generalized Christian, Methodist, and Zionist hymns sung in the Zulu language. Rising to stardom In 1986, Paul Simon travelled to South Africa to collaborate with South African artists for his upcoming Graceland album. Simon collaborated with Shabalala and the group, and co-composed the now-famous song, \\"Homeless\\". The group's popularity spread all over the world, and since then they have sold records popular enough to earn platinum disc certification. In 1987, the group won their first solo Grammy Award for Shaka Zulu. Since then, they have won one more and have been nominated over ten times. Following the worldwide success of Graceland, Shabalala began composing more songs in English (prior to this they had only recorded two in English and one in German). On the night of 10 December 1991, his brother and fellow member Headman Shabalala was killed by an off-duty white security guard near the town of Ladysmith. The death was thought to be a racial murder. Joseph, helped by his beliefs, persevered, and the group continued; the members now included his brother Jockey, close relatives Albert and Abednego Mazibuko, Russel Mthembu and Jabulani Dubazana and his sons Sibongiseni, Thamsanqa, Thulani and Msizi. Nevertheless, tragedy returned. In May 2002, Shabalala's wife of 30 years, Nellie, was shot and killed by an assailant outside the couple's home in Clermont, KwaZulu-Natal. Shabalala's hand was wounded in his attempt to protect his wife. Mboneni Mdunge was convicted of the murder and sentenced to life in prison. At the same trial, Shabalala's son Nkosinathi Vivian Shabalala (Nellie's stepson) was charged, tried and acquitted on charges of having paid Mdunge for Nellie's murder.  Later life and death  The next album from the group, Wenyukela, was expected to have a solemn touch to it. Indeed, it did, including a tribute to Nellie by her grandsons Gagamela and Babuyile Shabalala, encouraging Shabalala to carry on and that \\"S-H-A-B-A-L-A-L-A will live on.\\" Six months after Nellie's death, he married Thoko Maduna, which was a \\"controversial stunt,\\" according to the South African press. Despite this opposition, Shabalala managed to continue to carry on singing and even managed to set up the Ladysmith Black Mambazo Foundation, a music academy to promote and teach isicathamiya music to young South African children. Tragedy struck again in June 2004 when his brother and former Mambazo member Ben Shabalala was shot and killed by an unknown individual whilst driving his two children to school. In February 2006, his brother Jockey (his only brother in the group by this time), died of natural causes at his home in Ladysmith, South Africa. Shabalala announced, in January 2008, that his youngest son Thamsanqa would take over as leader of Ladysmith Black Mambazo when the time comes for him to retire from international touring (see main article for more information). On 11 February 2020, Shabalala died in Pretoria at the age of 78.

The game was to be a real-time strategy game, with elements from first-person shooter games. According to Dave Taylor, the game's name came from Shakespeare's King Lear tragedy, wherein Golgotha was a massive plain and a future battlefield.  Plot  The game plays in the fictional future of the year 2048 AD, where a global nuclear disarmament and the coincidental murder of a beloved American archaeologist leads to an American military incision on Iraq. Which, in turn, elicits a European military power play and begins World War III. The commander of the American force sent to invade Iraq questions his mission. With no suitable answers, he abandons his country and takes his troops on the quest for truth. In the try to recover what really happened at Golgotha they discover a supernatural conflict behind a veil of political discord.  History  After the successful release of Abuse in February 1996, Crack dot Com began instantly with a new project, called Golgotha. The game was originally meant to be a real-time strategy game, with elements from first-person shooter games. This FPS/RTS hybrid should draw inspiration specifically from Doom and Command & Conquer. = Demo = The last released demo, version number 5c, was playable in Windows. It supported both software rendering and 3dfx Glide-based 3D cards. The demo included two levels, one based on Switzerland and one based on Cairo. The Switzerland demo level was the more complete one. In addition to this, the demo also had a non-interactive demo level that showed the terrain rendering capabilities of the graphics engine. In the demo, the gameplay worked in the following fashion. The player controlled a super-tank, which can be driven in first-person mode. In third-person mode, the player is presented with a bird's-eye view of the battlefield, and can command squads of individual units. The object of the level is to secure the enemy base and move any unit capable of taking over enemy bases to the \\"takeover pad\\" in the base. = Re-design = In September 1998, around the time the company folded, the gameplay had several issues: Basically, there was no way to control squads any more; grand-scale strategy was limited to choosing path for the produced units to follow. This didn't allow for much variation in gameplay. Also, many AI issues had been left unattended. Though originally inspired by Command & Conquer, the team decided to abandon the traditional RTS format because both the team and budget proved to be ill-suited to solving the problems inherent in an RTS. As they would learn later, pathsolving and routing are famous for bringing RTS teams to their knees and theirs was no exception. Rather than suffer, they decide to pull the kill chain on it and adopt a simpler gameplay mechanic. The removal of squad control in Golgotha was intentional. Crack Dot Com tossed C&C; as the inspiration and embraced Rescue Raiders, changing it from a 1.5D RTS/action hybrid to a 2.5D RTS/action hybrid. In the new version of Golgotha, players controlled a supertank in a very twitchy action game. So squad control was reduced to picking a path, then queuing a rock-paper- scissors-ish sequence of baddies so that players could quickly return to control of their supertank. This change dramatically improved gameplay. Artificial intelligence for the opposing supertank was still wobbly and posed another notoriously challenging problem, but it was a far more tractable problem than the pathsolving/routing problem and a much better fit for the team. However, about the time the team had finally settled on this, they had burned through the cash generated from sales of Abuse, in addition to a little money from AMD for 3DNow! optimizations and a gracious gift from Richard Garriott. = Release into public domain = The unfinished game's assets were released to public domain on October 22, 2000. This included source code, game data, textures and music, some of which have been recycled into other games. After the release, some volunteers started working on the game code. The development effort was rekindled as Golgotha Forever, headed by Mark O'Hara.The resurrection of Golgotha on salon.com (1999) However, the interest later died down.

FeRAM is one of a growing number of alternative non-volatile random-access memory technologies that offer the same functionality as flash memory. FeRAM's advantages over Flash include: lower power usage, faster write performance and a much greater maximum read/write endurance (about 1010https://www.fujitsu.com/us/Images/MB85R4001A-DS501-00005-3v0-E.pdf to 1014http://www.cypress.com/file/136476/download cycles). FeRAMs have data retention times of more than 10 years at +85 ¬∞C (up to many decades at lower temperatures). Market disadvantages of FeRAM are much lower storage densities than flash devices, storage capacity limitations and higher cost. Like DRAM, FeRAM's read process is destructive, necessitating a write-after-read architecture. History Ferroelectric RAM was proposed by MIT graduate student Dudley Allen Buck in his master's thesis, Ferroelectrics for Digital Information Storage and Switching, published in 1952.Dudley A. Buck, \\"Ferroelectrics for Digital Information Storage and Switching.\\" Report R-212, MIT, June 1952. This was during an era of sharing research between members of the scientific community as a means to rapidly propel technological innovation during a rapid buildup of computing power in the Cold War era. In 1955, Bell Telephone Laboratories was experimenting with ferroelectric-crystal memories. Following the introduction of metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) dynamic random- access memory (DRAM) chips in the early 1970s, development of FeRAM began in the late 1980s. Work was done in 1991 at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) on improving methods of read out, including a novel method of non- destructive readout using pulses of UV radiation.Optically Addressed Ferroelectric Memory with Non-Destructive Read-Out FeRAM was commercialized in the late 1990s. In 1996, Samsung Electronics introduced a 4Mb FeRAM chip fabricated using NMOS logic. In 1998, Hyundai Electronics (now SK Hynix) also commercialized FeRAM technology. The earliest known commercial product to use FeRAM is Sony's PlayStation 2 (PS2), released in 2000. The PS2 hardware's Emotion Engine central processing unit (CPU) manufactured by Toshiba contains 32kb embedded FeRAM fabricated using a 500 nm complementary MOS (CMOS) process. A major modern FeRAM manufacturer is Ramtron, a fabless semiconductor company. One major licensee is Fujitsu, who operates what is probably the largest semiconductor foundry production line with FeRAM capability. Since 1999 they have been using this line to produce standalone FeRAMs, as well as specialized chips (e.g. chips for smart cards) with embedded FeRAMs. Fujitsu produced devices for Ramtron until 2010. Since 2010 Ramtron's fabricators have been TI (Texas Instruments) and IBM. Since at least 2001 Texas Instruments has collaborated with Ramtron to develop FeRAM test chips in a modified 130 nm process. In the fall of 2005, Ramtron reported that they were evaluating prototype samples of an 8-megabit FeRAM manufactured using Texas Instruments' FeRAM process. Fujitsu and Seiko-Epson were in 2005 collaborating in the development of a 180 nm FeRAM process. In 2012 Ramtron was acquired by Cypress Semiconductor.http://www.bizjournals.com/denver/news/2012/11/21/cypress- semiconductor-completes.html FeRAM research projects have also been reported at Samsung, Matsushita, Oki, Toshiba, Infineon, Hynix, Symetrix, Cambridge University, University of Toronto, and the Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre (IMEC, Belgium). Description Structure of a FeRAM cell Conventional DRAM consists of a grid of small capacitors and their associated wiring and signaling transistors. Each storage element, a cell, consists of one capacitor and one transistor, a so-called \\"1T-1C\\" device. It is typically a type of MOS memory, fabricated using CMOS technology. DRAM cells scale directly with the size of the semiconductor fabrication process being used to make it. For instance, on the 90 nm process used by most memory providers to make DDR2 DRAM, the cell size is 0.22 Œºm¬≤, which includes the capacitor, transistor, wiring, and some amount of \\"blank space\\" between the various parts ‚Äî it appears 35% utilization is typical, leaving 65% of the space empty (for separation). DRAM data is stored as the presence or lack of an electrical charge in the capacitor, with the lack of charge in general representing \\"0\\". Writing is accomplished by activating the associated control transistor, draining the cell to write a \\"0\\", or sending current into it from a supply line if the new value should be \\"1\\". Reading is similar in nature; the transistor is again activated, draining the charge to a sense amplifier. If a pulse of charge is noticed in the amplifier, the cell held a charge and thus reads \\"1\\"; the lack of such a pulse indicates a \\"0\\". Note that this process is destructive, once the cell has been read. If it did hold a \\"1,\\" it must be re- charged to that value again. Since a cell loses its charge after some time due to leak currents, it must be actively refreshed at intervals. The 1T-1C storage cell design in an FeRAM is similar in construction to the storage cell in widely used DRAM in that both cell types include one capacitor and one access transistor. In a DRAM cell capacitor, a linear dielectric is used, whereas in an FeRAM cell capacitor the dielectric structure includes ferroelectric material, typically lead zirconate titanate (PZT). A ferroelectric material has a nonlinear relationship between the applied electric field and the apparent stored charge. Specifically, the ferroelectric characteristic has the form of a hysteresis loop, which is very similar in shape to the hysteresis loop of ferromagnetic materials. The dielectric constant of a ferroelectric is typically much higher than that of a linear dielectric because of the effects of semi-permanent electric dipoles formed in the crystal structure of the ferroelectric material. When an external electric field is applied across a dielectric, the dipoles tend to align themselves with the field direction, produced by small shifts in the positions of atoms and shifts in the distributions of electronic charge in the crystal structure. After the charge is removed, the dipoles retain their polarization state. Binary \\"0\\"s and \\"1\\"s are stored as one of two possible electric polarizations in each data storage cell. For example, in the figure a \\"1\\" is encoded using the negative remnant polarization \\"-Pr\\", and a \\"0\\" is encoded using the positive remnant polarization \\"+Pr\\". In terms of operation, FeRAM is similar to DRAM. Writing is accomplished by applying a field across the ferroelectric layer by charging the plates on either side of it, forcing the atoms inside into the \\"up\\" or \\"down\\" orientation (depending on the polarity of the charge), thereby storing a \\"1\\" or \\"0\\". Reading, however, is somewhat different than in DRAM. The transistor forces the cell into a particular state, say \\"0\\". If the cell already held a \\"0\\", nothing will happen in the output lines. If the cell held a \\"1\\", the re-orientation of the atoms in the film will cause a brief pulse of current in the output as they push electrons out of the metal on the \\"down\\" side. The presence of this pulse means the cell held a \\"1\\". Since this process overwrites the cell, reading FeRAM is a destructive process, and requires the cell to be re-written. In general, the operation of FeRAM is similar to ferrite core memory, one of the primary forms of computer memory in the 1960s. However, compared to core memory, FeRAM requires far less power to flip the state of the polarity and does so much faster. Comparison with other memory types =Density= The main determinant of a memory system's cost is the density of the components used to make it up. Smaller components, and fewer of them, means that more cells can be packed onto a single chip, which in turn means more can be produced at once from a single silicon wafer. This improves yield, which is directly related to cost. The lower limit to this scaling process is an important point of comparison. In general, the technology that scales to the smallest cell size will end up being the least expensive per bit. In terms of construction, FeRAM and DRAM are similar, and can in general be built on similar lines at similar sizes. In both cases, the lower limit seems to be defined by the amount of charge needed to trigger the sense amplifiers. For DRAM, this appears to be a problem at around 55 nm, at which point the charge stored in the capacitor is too small to be detected. It is not clear as to whether FeRAM can scale to the same size, as the charge density of the PZT layer may not be the same as the metal plates in a normal capacitor. An additional limitation on size is that materials tend to stop being ferroelectric when they are too small.Ferroelectric Phase Transition in Individual Single-Crystalline BaTiO3 Nanowires . See also the associated press release.Junquera and Ghosez, Nature, 2003, DOI 10.1038/nature01501 (This effect is related to the ferroelectric's \\"depolarization field\\".) There is ongoing research on addressing the problem of stabilizing ferroelectric materials; one approach, for example, uses molecular adsorbates. To date, the commercial FeRAM devices have been produced at 350 nm and 130 nm. Early models required two FeRAM cells per bit, leading to very low densities, but this limitation has since been removed. =Power consumption= The key advantage to FeRAM over DRAM is what happens between the read and write cycles. In DRAM, the charge deposited on the metal plates leaks across the insulating layer and the control transistor, and disappears. In order for a DRAM to store data for anything other than a very short time, every cell must be periodically read and then re-written, a process known as refresh. Each cell must be refreshed many times every second (typically times per secondTN-47-16: Designing for High-Density DDR2 Memory ) and this requires a continuous supply of power. In contrast, FeRAM only requires power when actually reading or writing a cell. The vast majority of power used in DRAM is used for refresh, so it seems reasonable to suggest that the benchmark quoted by STT-MRAM researchers is useful here too, indicating power usage about 99% lower than DRAM. The destructive read aspect of FeRAM may put it at a disadvantage compared to MRAM, however. Another non-volatile memory type is flash RAM, and like FeRAM it does not require a refresh process. Flash works by pushing electrons across a high-quality insulating barrier where they get \\"stuck\\" on one terminal of a transistor. This process requires high voltages, which are built up in a charge pump over time. This means that FeRAM could be expected to be lower power than flash, at least for writing, as the write power in FeRAM is only marginally higher than reading. For a \\"mostly-read\\" device the difference might be slight, but for devices with more balanced read and write the difference could be expected to be much higher. =Performance= DRAM performance is limited by the rate at which the charge stored in the cells can be drained (for reading) or stored (for writing). In general, this ends up being defined by the capability of the control transistors, the capacitance of the lines carrying power to the cells, and the heat that power generates. FeRAM is based on the physical movement of atoms in response to an external field, which happens to be extremely fast, settling in about 1 ns. In theory, this means that FeRAM could be much faster than DRAM. However, since power has to flow into the cell for reading and writing, the electrical and switching delays would likely be similar to DRAM overall. It does seem reasonable to suggest that FeRAM would require less charge than DRAM, because DRAMs need to hold the charge, whereas FeRAM would have been written to before the charge would have drained. However, there is a delay in writing because the charge has to flow through the control transistor, which limits current somewhat. In comparison to flash, the advantages are much more obvious. Whereas the read operation is likely to be similar in performance, the charge pump used for writing requires a considerable time to \\"build up\\" current, a process that FeRAM does not need. Flash memories commonly need a millisecond or more to complete a write, whereas current FeRAMs may complete a write in less than 150 ns. On the other hand, FeRAM has its own reliability issues, including imprint and fatigue. Imprint is the preferential polarization state from previous writes to that state, and fatigue is increase of minimum writing voltage due to loss of polarization after extensive cycling. The theoretical performance of FeRAM is not entirely clear. Existing 350 nm devices have read times on the order of 50‚Äì60 ns. Although slow compared to modern DRAMs, which can be found with times on the order of 2 ns, common 350 nm DRAMs operated with a read time of about 35 ns, so FeRAM performance appears to be comparable given the same fabrication technology. Overall FeRAM remains a relatively small part of the overall semiconductor market. In 2005, worldwide semiconductor sales were US$235 billion (according to the Gartner Group), with the flash memory market accounting for US $18.6 billion (according to IC Insights). The 2005 annual sales of Ramtron, perhaps the largest FeRAM vendor, were reported to be US $32.7 million. The much larger sales of flash memory compared to the alternative NVRAMs support a much larger research and development effort. Flash memory is produced using semiconductor linewidths of 30 nm at Samsung (2007) while FeRAMs are produced in linewidths of 350 nm at Fujitsu and 130 nm at Texas Instruments (2007). Flash memory cells can store multiple bits per cell (currently 3 in the highest density NAND flash devices), and the number of bits per flash cell is projected to increase to 4 or even to 8 as a result of innovations in flash cell design. As a consequence, the areal bit densities of flash memory are much higher than those of FeRAM, and thus the cost per bit of flash memory is orders of magnitude lower than that of FeRAM. The density of FeRAM arrays might be increased by improvements in FeRAM foundry process technology and cell structures, such as the development of vertical capacitor structures (in the same way as DRAM) to reduce the area of the cell footprint. However, reducing the cell size may cause the data signal to become too weak to be detectable. In 2005, Ramtron reported significant sales of its FeRAM products in a variety of sectors including (but not limited to) electricity meters, automotive (e.g. black boxes, smart air bags), business machines (e.g. printers, RAID disk controllers), instrumentation, medical equipment, industrial microcontrollers, and radio frequency identification tags. The other emerging NVRAMs, such as MRAM, may seek to enter similar niche markets in competition with FeRAM. Texas Instruments proved it to be possible to embed FeRAM cells using two additional masking steps during conventional CMOS semiconductor manufacture. Flash typically requires nine masks. This makes possible for example, the integration of FeRAM onto microcontrollers, where a simplified process would reduce costs. However, the materials used to make FeRAMs are not commonly used in CMOS integrated circuit manufacturing. Both the PZT ferroelectric layer and the noble metals used for electrodes raise CMOS process compatibility and contamination issues. Texas Instruments has incorporated an amount of FRAM memory into its MSP430 microcontrollers in its new FRAM series.

He appeared in two games for the Pirates before he required Tommy John surgery that kept him out of the majors until the end of the 2003 season. 2004 marked Vogelsong's first full season in the major leagues. He spent most of the season as a starting pitcher. Vogelsong struggled in that role, ending the season with a 6‚Äì13 record and 6.50 ERA. He rebounded in 2005 after being moved to the bullpen, posting a 4.43 ERA and 2‚Äì2 record while being used primarily as a middle reliever.

He started the season in AAA Fresno, but on April 17, 2011, the Giants purchased his contract to replace the injured Barry Zito.\\"Giants' Zito placed on DL, Vogelsong called up\\". csnbayarea.com. April 17, 2011. On April 28, 2011, after making two relief appearances, Vogelsong got his first start since the 2004 season against his former club, the Pirates. He held the host Pirates to two earned runs on four hits and struck out eight en route to a 5‚Äì2 Giants victory and his first MLB win since September 2005.\\"Ryan Vogelsong Pitches Giants Past Pirates\\". espn.com/mlb. April 28, 2011. Vogelsong continued to excel in his replacement role, posting a record of 6‚Äì1 with a 2.17 ERA in the first half, which secured him a spot in San Francisco's vaunted starting rotation. Giants and 2011 National League All-Star manager Bruce Bochy named Vogelsong to the 2011 NL All-Star Team on July 3, 2011.\\"Vogelsong superb as Giants top Twins\\". mlb.com. June 23, 2011. He didn't see any action in the NL 5‚Äì1 win over the AL. His first start after the All-Star break on July 18, 2011, a 5‚Äì0 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers, gave him enough innings pitched to qualify for the National League leader in ERA with 2.02. In his final start of the season Vogelsong pitched seven shutout innings against the Colorado Rockies, giving up four hits and walking no batters. The 33-year-old Vogelsong finished his first MLB season as a starting pitcher since 2005 with a 13‚Äì7 record and a 2.71 ERA, the lowest among the San Francisco starting rotation that boasted Tim Lincecum, Matt Cain, and Madison Bumgarner. Five of Vogelsong's seven losses occurred in a row, during a stretch where Vogelsong received three total runs of support, with no more than one run scored each game by a struggling San Francisco offense. During the month of August 2011, Vogelsong stated that playing winter ball in Venezuela in 2010 with Tiburones de La Guaira was the turning point to recover his career. Prior to his experience in Venezuela, Vogelsong had 10 wins, 22 losses and 5.86 ERA in his MLB career 2012 (World Series) In January, Vogelsong and the Giants agreed to an $8.3 million, two-year contract. Vogelsong continued to dominate in 2012. He boasted the lowest ERA in the National League at the All-Star Break and a 7‚Äì4 record. Despite his impressive pitching, Vogelsong did not make the 2012 All-Star team, a decision Giants fans consider a major snub. Vogelsong was the first ERA leader not to make the All-Star team since 2001 (Josh Johnson had not pitched enough innings in 2006 to qualify for the ERA title). On August 3, 2012, Vogelsong's 16-game streak of allowing three or fewer runs per game was snapped by the Colorado Rockies when he allowed 4 runs while pitching 6.1 innings in a 16‚Äì4 Giants win. Vogelsong finished the regular season with a 14‚Äì9 record in 31 starts with a 3.37 ERA. In the 2012 postseason, Vogelsong would play a pivotal role in the Giants push toward their 2012 World Series title. During Game 3 of the 2012 National League Division Series in Cincinnati, with the Reds holding a commanding 2‚Äì0 lead in the series and the Giants facing elimination, Vogelsong pitched a tight game tied at one run through 5 innings. The Giants would go on to win Game 3, 2‚Äì1 in 10 innings on a Joaquin Arias ground ball mishandled by Scott Rolen allowing Buster Posey to score the winning run. During Game 2 of the 2012 National League Championship Series in San Francisco, Vogelsong faced Chris Carpenter, with the Cardinals holding a 1‚Äì0 series lead. Vogelsong allowed 1 run in the 2nd inning to tie the game, but proceeded to shut out the Cardinals offense through seven innings en route to a 7‚Äì1 win at home to tie the series at one game apiece. During Game 6 of the NLCS in San Francisco, Vogelsong and the Giants faced elimination for a fifth time. Giants' pitching had begun to dominate. Vogelsong had a very strong outing this time, scattering five hits and allowing one run (in the 6th inning), after the Giants set the tempo with a four-run 2nd inning to break the game open. He set a new career-high of 9 strikeouts on the night after he struck out Daniel Descalso with a foul tip. The Giants won 6‚Äì1, pushing the NLCS to the limit in a magical Game 7, which they won to complete the comeback and advance to the World Series. During Game 3 of the 2012 World Series in Detroit, the Giants held a surprising 2‚Äì0 lead for the first time in the 2012 postseason. Vogelsong again had a strong outing, posting a shutout through 5.2 innings. The Tigers threatened to open the scoring with the bases loaded and one out in the 5th inning, but Vogelsong struck out Quintin Berry and got Miguel Cabrera to pop out to end the threat. The Giants would go on to win Game 3, 2‚Äì0, and posted the first back-to-back shutouts since 1966. The Giants went on to sweep the Detroit Tigers 4‚Äì0 to win the World Series. Vogelsong and Barry Zito were the only pitchers to go undefeated in the postseason amongst all Giants' starting pitchers. Vogelsong posted a 3‚Äì0 record with a 1.09 ERA, allowing three runs through 24.2 innings, the lowest ERA among all Giants' starting pitchers. Vogelsong's postseason ERA was the best since Orel Hershiser's 1.05 in 1988 (minimum 24 innings). Vogelsong joined Christy Mathewson as the only pitchers to start their postseason careers with four consecutive starts of five or more innings giving up one run or fewer. 2013 Vogelsong began 2013 as the #5 starter in the Giants rotation. His season didn't start out well, where in his first 9 starts, he went 2‚Äì4 with a 7.19 ERA and 1 quality start. In a start on May 20 against the Nationals, he was pitching 5 shutout innings when he came to bat against Craig Stammen, who hit him on the hand with a fastball, fracturing two bones and dislocating a joint. Vogelsong missed almost 12 weeks before returning on August 9. He had a strong final two months, lowering his ERA by 1.46. In 19 starts in 2013, Vogelsong went 4‚Äì6 with a 5.73 ERA, striking out 67 in 103.2 innings. On November 4, Vogelsong had his $6.5 million club option declined, and instead was paid a $300,000 buyout. However, the Giants remained interested in negotiating a less- expensive deal with him. Vogelsong agreed to a 1-year, $5 million contract on November 29, 2013, pending the completion of a physical examination. The deal was officially completed on December 4, 2013. 2014 (World Series) Vogelsong made a career-high 32 starts in 2014, finishing the season 8‚Äì13 with a 4.00 ERA, striking out 151 in 184.2 innings. During the postseason, Vogelsong started three games, and although he received three no decisions, the Giants went on to win each game. Vogelsong won his second World Series ring as the Giants defeated the Kansas City Royals four games to three. 2015 On January 23, 2015, Vogelsong re-signed with the Giants on a one-year, $4 million contract. On September 3, he hit his first career home run, a 2-run homer off Chris Rusin at Coors Field. =2016= On December 18, 2015, Vogelsong signed a one-year contract to return to the Pirates for the 2016 season. On May 23, 2016, Vogelsong was hit in the face by a pitch from Colorado Rockies right-hander Jordan Lyles. He suffered damage to his left eye socket, including fractures to the orbital bone. He was subsequently placed on the 15-day disabled list. =2017= On January 10, 2017, Vogelsong agreed to a minor league contract with the Minnesota Twins, with an invite to spring training. He was released on March 21, 2017 after he struggled to a 7.72 ERA in just 8 innings of spring work. The Giants held a ceremony on September 17, 2017, before the game at AT&T; Park, to officially retire Vogelsong as a Giant. Pitcher profile Vogelsong throws a four-seam fastball, two-seam fastball, cut fastball, circle changeup, and curveball. His four seam sits in 90‚Äì93 mph.

In descending order of forest land area it is located in parts of Liberty, Wakulla, Leon, and Franklin counties. The forest is headquartered in Tallahassee, as are all three National Forests in Florida, but there are local Forest ranger district offices located in Bristol and Crawfordville. Hunting and fishing Hunting and fishing are monitored and governed by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC). The national forest itself is a wildlife management area. The FWC divides the management area into sections that allow dog hunting, still hunting, and private property. Modern gun season for large game starts Thanksgiving weekend and ends in January.Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission Environment The Apalachicola National Forest is in the southeastern conifer forests ecoregion. Areas of the national forest with dry, sandy soils support Florida longleaf pine sandhills and east Gulf coastal plain near-coast pine flatwoods. Sandhills are woodlands dominated by longleaf pine (Pinus palustris). Pine flatwoods are forests and woodlands on broad, sandy flatlands. Both of these pine communities are sustained by frequent fires. Near the floodplains of spring-fed rivers grow southern coastal plain hydric hammocks, dense forests of evergreen and deciduous hardwood trees. Blackwater rivers support southern coastal plain blackwater river floodplain forests of baldcypress (Taxodium distichum) along their banks. Major rivers support diverse east Gulf coastal plain large river floodplain forests. Notable animals that inhabit this forest are red-cockaded woodpecker, fox squirrel, red fox, raccoon, gray fox, bobcat, coyote, black bear, wild turkey and alligator. It is also home to several wetland plant communities. Southern coastal plain nonriverine basin swamps are large, seasonally flooded depressions of baldcypress (Taxodium distichum) and swamp tupelo (Nyssa biflora). East Gulf coastal plain savannas and wet prairies are low, flat plains covered in grasses and sedges, which are seasonally flooded and maintained by frequent fires. Southern coastal plain nonriverine cypress domes are small wetlands of pond cypress (Taxodium ascendens) notable for their dome-shaped appearance. The Forest contains thousands of acres of old growth Pond Cypress swamps (cypress domes). In addition, Bradwell Bay Wilderness contains about of old-growth Slash Pine - Swamp Tupelo swamps.

The fess represents a pathway, with the edge suggesting the city's green spaces and the continuing wealth and amenities flowing from local forests. The railway is highlighted through the red steam locomotive wheel and the twin bands of gold, the color of commerce. The shield's upper area celebrates the Coquitlam River from which the city takes its name. Coquitlam is an Aboriginal word meaning \\"little red fish\\". The crest is set on a wreath of two of the city's official heraldic colors, white and green. It is composed of a mural coronet, an emblem for municipal government. The coronet is set with six anchors, three visible, which represent ships and maritime commerce and refer to the \\"port\\" in the city's name. The supporters stand on a compartment representing the grass of the city lands. The beaver supporters, colored in the gold of commerce to echo the motto, are taken directly from the old emblem on City Hall. They have patriotic and thematic meaning. In addition to being Canada's national animal and a symbol of industry, the beavers play an important role in the city's own heritage of symbols.

It is present in 90 countries, operating in several sectors, including retail, financial services, shopping centres management, software and information systems, media and telecommunications. It is the largest private employer in Portugal, with 53,794 employees. Sonae is listed on the Euronext PSI-20 in Lisbon, under the code SON. In the first quarter of 2018, Sonae's turnover amounted to 2,680 million euros, with net results in the order of 98 million euros, more 34.2% than the same period last year.  History  Sonae was founded in 1959 by the entrepreneur, banker and patron from Arouca, Afonso Pinto de Magalh√£es. The business group originated from the Sociedade Nacional de Estratificados, an industrial company operating in the area of processed wood, more specifically, in the production of decorative high-pressure laminated panels. During the first two decades of existence, Sonae remained as a small to medium-size business company. Afonso Pinto de Magalh√£es, also the founder of the Pinto Magalh√£es Bank, placed F√°bio Lemos in control of Sonae in the turbulent years following the Carnation Revolution. During that period, the company was nationalized and then reprivatized. In 1982, Afonso Pinto de Magalh√£es gave 16% of Sonae to Belmiro de Azevedo, who had been admitted to Sonae in 1965. After the death of the founder, Belmiro de Azevedo reached the majority of the capital, with 54.6%, taking control of the company. During the 1980s, Sonae began its fast growth. In 1985, Sonae Investimentos SGPS, S.A. was created and the group entered the Lisbon Stock Exchange. It was also in the early 1980s that Sonae began its business diversification strategy through acquisitions and the creation of new investments. The group entered into the modern distribution market by opening the first hypermarket in Portugal, \\"Continente\\", in Matosinhos. Two years later, Sonae launched seven takeover bids to seven companies, which allowed the business group to grow in various business areas. In 1993, Sonae Ind√∫stria expanded its investments by acquiring a controlling position in Spanish company Tafisa, which allowed the company to extend its business segment. Posteriorly, another important step was taken when Sonae entered into the specialized retail area with the launch of Worten. In 1998, with Paulo de Azevedo leading the project, Optimus was born. The mobile operator merged with Zon in 2013, giving rise to NOS. In 2007, Paulo de Azevedo took over the leadership of the Sonae group, succeeding his father, Belmiro de Azevedo. In March 2015, Belmiro de Azevedo announced his resignation as Sonae chairman. Paulo de Azevedo was chosen as the new chairman and CEO of the Sonae group, sharing the executive committee presidency with √Çngelo Paup√©rio, who was the vice president of Sonae until that point. In 2018, Cl√°udia Azevedo was elected executive president of Sonae by the biggest shareholder company of the group, the Efanor. Belmiro de Azevedo's daughter started functions in May 2019, replacing the group Co-CEOs, Paulo de Azevedo and √Çngelo Paup√©rio.

However, aside from the use of metal acetylides as nucleophiles, such a process rarely works well in practice due to metal‚Äìhalogen exchange and/or the formation of large amounts of reduction or elimination side-products.However, see Wurtz coupling for cases where an in situ generated organosodium reagent reacts with an alkyl halide. As a solution to this problem, the Corey‚ÄìHouse reaction constitutes a general and high yielding method for the joining of two alkyl groups or an alkyl group and an aryl group.  Scope  The scope of the Corey-House synthesis is exceptionally broad, and a range of lithium diorganylcuprates (R2CuLi, R = 1¬∞, 2¬∞, or 3¬∞ alkyl, aryl, or alkenyl) and organyl (pseudo) halides (RX, R = methyl, benzylic, allylic, 1¬∞, or cyclic 2¬∞ alkyl, aryl, or alkenyl and X = Br, I, OTs, or OTf; X = Cl is marginal) will undergo coupling as the nucleophilic and electrophilic coupling partners, respectively. The reaction usually takes place at room temperature or below in an ethereal solvent. Due to the wide range of applicable coupling partners, functional group tolerance, and operational simplicity, the Corey‚ÄìHouse synthesis is a powerful and practical tool for the synthesis of complex organic molecules. However, as limitations, hindered (2¬∞ or 3¬∞) alkyl halides are generally unsuccessful or low-yielding substrates for the Corey-House synthesis. Furthermore, alkynylcuprates are generally inert under usual coupling conditions. The forging of aryl-aryl bonds is also inefficient and much more effectively achieved using palladium catalysis. Reaction process and mechanism The Corey-House synthesis is preceded by two preliminary steps to prepare the requisite Gilman reagent from an alkyl halide. In the first step, the alkyl halide is treated with lithium metal in dry ether to prepare an alkyllithium reagent, RLi. The starting alkyl halide for the lithiation step can be a primary, secondary or tertiary alkyl chloride, bromide, or iodide: :R‚ÄìX + 2Li¬∞ ‚Üí RLi + Li+X‚Äì In the second step, a lithium dialkylcuprate, also known as a Gilman reagent (named after Henry Gilman of Iowa State University) is prepared from the alkyllithium by treatment with cuprous iodide (CuI) in a transmetalation reaction: :2RLi + CuI ‚Üí Li+[R‚ÄìCu‚ÄìR]‚Äì \\\\+ LiI If the use of alkyllithium reagents is precluded by functional group incompatibility, transmetalation from other metals (e.g., Mg, Zn, Al, B) may be considered as alternatives for the preparation of the organocopper reagent. The Corey-House synthesis process is the reaction between the organocopper reagent, usually a lithium dialkylcuprate as prepared above, and a second alkyl (pseudo)halide or an aryl iodide. This results in the formation of a C‚ÄìC bond between the two organic fragments: :Li+[R‚ÄìCu‚ÄìR]‚Äì \\\\+ R'‚ÄìX ‚Üí R‚ÄìR' + \\"RCu\\" + LiX From the stoichiometry, it is apparent that one equivalent of the R group is wasted as an ill-characterized alkylcopper species (likely polymeric; usually converted to RH upon aqueous workup) in the most common form of the Corey‚ÄìHouse synthesis. To avoid this for cases where R is a precious or complex fragment, a reagent (R)(RU)CuM, where RU is an untransferable dummy ligand (e.g., RU = cyano, alkynyl, 2-thienyl, etc.) can be prepared and used instead. It is important to note that when R and R' are different, only the cross product R‚ÄìR' is obtained; R‚ÄìR or R'‚ÄìR' are not formed in significant amounts. The Corey‚ÄìHouse reaction is therefore an example of a cross-coupling reaction. The Corey‚ÄìHouse synthesis is, in fact, one of the earliest transition metal- mediated (or catalyzed, see below) cross-coupling reactions to be discovered. In the case of alkyl bromides and tosylates, inversion of configuration is observed when an configurationally pure alkyl electrophile is used. The reaction is believed to proceed via an SN2-like mechanism to give a copper(III) species, which undergoes reductive elimination to give the coupling product. When alkyl iodides are used, scrambling of configuration is observed, and cyclization products are observed to form for alkyl iodides with an olefin tether, both of which are indicative of the involvement of radicals. alt=It is important to note that for this reaction to work successfully, the alkyl (pseudo)halide coupling partner should be methyl, benzylic, allylic, 1¬∞ alkyl, or 2¬∞ cycloalkyl. In most cases, 3¬∞ and acyclic 2¬∞ electrophiles give unsatisfactory results. (However, see below for recent modifications that allow 2¬∞ electrophiles to be used successfully.) On the other hand, sterically hindered organocopper reagents, including 3¬∞ and other branched alkyl reagents, are generally tolerated.In a typical example, lithium dibutylcuprate reacts with 2-bromopentane to give the coupling product in only 12% yield. However, aryl derived cuprate reagents can react successfully. For instance, lithium diphenylcuprate reacts with (R)-2-bromobutane (73-78% ee) to afford (S)-2-phenylbutane (67-68% ee) in 67-87% yield (84-92% stereoinversion). However, aryl bromides, iodides and sulfonates, which do not ordinarily undergo nucleophilic substitution in the absence of a transition metal, can be used successfully as coupling partners.  Catalytic version  In 1971, Kochi reported that Grignard reagents and alkyl bromides could be coupled using a catalytic amount of lithium tetrachlorocuprate(II), a process that was extended to alkyl tosylates by Schlosser and Fouquet. In the catalytic process, the Grignard reagent undergoes transmetalation with the copper salt or complex to generate an organocuprate as a catalytic intermediate, which then undergoes reaction with the (pseudo)halide electrophile to form the coupling product and release the copper and complete the catalytic cycle. 400x400px Under recently discovered conditions, using TMEDA as the ligand for copper and lithium methoxide as a base additive, it is now possible to couple 1¬∞, 2¬∞, and 3¬∞ Grignard reagents with 1¬∞ and 2¬∞ alkyl bromides and tosylates in high yields with nearly exclusive stereoinversion. Even Œ≤-branched 2¬∞ alkyl tosylates react to give coupling product in moderate yield, greatly expanding the scope of the catalytic Corey‚ÄìHouse synthesis (Kochi‚ÄìSchlosser coupling). Background While the coupling of organocopper compounds and allyl bromide was reported as early as 1936 by Henry Gilman (Iowa State University), this reaction was fully developed by four organic chemists (two at Harvard and two at MIT): * E.J. Corey (Harvard University), research advisor of Gary Posner * Gary H. Posner (Johns Hopkins University), a student of Harvard University at the time * George M.

Wada pitched in the 2004 Athens and 2008 Beijing Olympics as well as the 2006 World Baseball Classic for the Japanese national team. He set a Tokyo Big6 Baseball League record with 476 strikeouts during his college career at Waseda University and was the Pacific League Most Valuable Rookie in 2003. Early life and high school career Wada was born in K≈çnan, Aichi Prefecture, a member of the age group often referred to as the \\"Matsuzaka Generation\\". He began playing baseball as a first grader at K≈çnan Municipal Fujisato Elementary School for the K≈çnan Danchi Baseball team. In 1991, Wada and his family moved to Izumo, Shimane Prefecture, Wada's father's hometown. Wada enrolled in Shimane Prefectural Hamada High School in Hamada upon graduating from junior high, leading them to the 79th National High School Baseball Championship in the summer of his second year of high school (the equivalent of eleventh grade in the United States) in 1997. His team faced Akita Commercial High School, led by current Tokyo Yakult Swallows ace Masanori Ishikawa, in the first round, but Wada walked that very Ishikawa with the bases loaded in the bottom of the ninth inning and suffered a walk-off loss. Wada's team secured a berth in the national tournament again the following summer (1998). They defeated Niigata Prefectural Shibata Agricultural High School, whose battery consisted of right-hander Kazuhiro Togashi (who later played for the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters) and catcher Ken Katoh (currently with the Yomiuri Giants), in their first game. They faced Teikyo High School, the East Tokyo champions, in their next game. Though Wada, who was not only the team's ace but also their cleanup hitter, gave up a home run to current Fighters outfielder Hichori Morimoto, Hamada High won 3-2, making it to the quarter-finals. They narrowly lost in the quarter-finals to Toyota Otani High School (led by current Orix Buffaloes outfielder Katsuaki Furuki) in extra innings. Though Wada had ruptured his left triceps muscle the previous fall and struggled to even reach with his fastball during the tournament, Teikyo High players remarked after facing Wada that \\"[his fastball] looked like it was .\\" College career Wada went on to enroll at the prestigious Waseda University as a human sciences major after graduating from Hamada High. He made his collegiate debut in the fall of his freshman year, pitching in a game against the University of Tokyo on September 12. He rebuilt his pitching mechanics from scratch that year, succeeding in increasing the velocity of his fastball until it consistently hit speeds of and above within a mere two months of joining the team. He became a full- fledged starter for Waseda in the spring of his second year, drawing attention with the furious pace with which he racked up strikeouts. =2002= Taking on the uniform number 18 that had traditionally denoted the team's lefty ace (and had previously been worn by current Fighters left-hander Shugo Fujii), Wada led Waseda to consecutive Tokyo Big6 league titles in the spring and summer seasons of his senior year (2002) for the first time in university history since 1950. He received the league Best Nine Award in both seasons. That year, Waseda earned a berth in both the 51st All-Japan University Baseball Championship Series as well as the Meiji Jingu Tournament, but the team fell short of a championship in both tournaments, losing to Asia University (whose pitching staff featured right-handers Katsuhiro Nagakawa and Hiroshi Kisanuki, both of whom would later turn professional) in the finals in the former and succumbing to Tohoku Fukushi University in the semi-finals in the latter. Wada set a new Tokyo Big6 record for career strikeouts that year, surpassing the 443 set by Suguru Egawa (who later pitched for the Yomiuri Giants) and finishing with 476.\\"Special Report: Path of Waseda Athletics\\" Waseda Online He also set a new Waseda record in wins for left-handed pitchers, finishing his college career with a 27-13 record and a 1.35 ERA. His dedication and commitment were said to have had a positive influence on younger players on the team like Norichika Aoki, Takashi Toritani, Toshimitsu Higa and Shintaro Yoshida (all of whom later went pro), the core that later led Waseda to four consecutive league titles for the first time in Tokyo Big6 history. Wada was dubbed the \\"Dr. K (√† la former Major League Baseball pitcher Dwight Gooden) of the Tokyo Big6\\" during his college years and was one of the most coveted prospects in Japanese college baseball as he entered his senior year.

Professional career =2003= Wada secured a spot in the Hawks' starting rotation from his rookie year (2003), making his professional debut in a regular season game against the Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes on April 1 (he gave up five runs in innings). He earned the first win of his career against the Seibu Lions on April 8, pitching six shutout innings, and recorded his first career complete game win (a shutout) against the Chiba Lotte Marines on April 16. Overall, he finished the year with a 14-5 record,\\"Rain postpones Game 3\\" The Japan Times 3.38 ERA and 195 strikeouts (second only to young Lions right-hander Daisuke Matsuzaka's 215), earning Pacific League Most Valuable Rookie honors.

The couple had their wedding ceremony at Izumo Taisha, a Shinto shrine, on December 14. =2006= Wada was chosen to play in the inaugural 2006 World Baseball Classic as a member of the Japanese national team but saw little playing time as a middle reliever, coming on in relief in Japan's second-round match against Mexico and pitching two shutout innings in his first and only appearance of the tournament (Japan won the game 6-1). Wada had perhaps his finest year yet in the regular season, pitching just innings but going 14-6 with a career-best 2.98 ERA and allowing the fewest walks and hits per inning pitched of his career (1.10). His wife, Kasumi, gave birth to their first child (a daughter) on September 13 of that year. =2007= Though Wada improved on his ERA still more by lowering it to 2.82 in the 2007 season, he was plagued by poor run support and went 12-10 for the year.\\"Pair of rookie hurlers could make big impact for their teams this season\\" The Japan Times He pitched the most innings (182) and amassed the most strikeouts (169) since his rookie campaign and became the only active pitcher other than the aforementioned Masanori Ishikawa (and the first in Hawks franchise history since Sugiura) to record double-digit wins in each of the first five seasons of his professional career. He underwent endoscopic surgery in Los Angeles during the season to remove articular cartilage fragments in his left elbow after experiencing discomfort in the region during the season. =2008= The rehab that Wada had to undergo following the elbow surgery kept him from making his first start of 2008 until April 6, roughly two-and-a-half weeks into the season. Despite the slight setback, he started the season of well, putting up eight wins before the All-Star break and garnering selection to the Japanese national team that would play in the 2008 Beijing Olympics. However, he did not pitch as had hoped in the Olympics,\\"Beijing exit must spur bout of soul-searching\\" The Japan Times giving up six runs (five earned) in two starts en route to a 4.82 ERA over 9‚Öì innings (albeit while striking out 13) and being one of the factors in Japan's disappointing fourth-place finish\\"Japan fails to win medal\\" The Japan Times behind South Korea, Cuba and the United States.

However, more injury trouble found Wada in the form of left elbow inflammation. He went to the United States for treatment, and was taken off the active roster on June 11. He was expected to miss at least three weeks initially, but did not return until September 9, when he was hammered by the Chiba Lotte Marines for 6 runs in 3 and 2/3 innings. Wada finished 2009 with a record of 4-5 with a 4.06 ERA. =2010= Wada started the 2010 campaign pegged as the fourth starter in the rotation behind Toshiya Sugiuchi, Kenji Ohtonari, and D.J. Houlton. His first start of the season came against the Orix Buffaloes, and he gave up two runs on three hits in five innings, walking two and striking out eight. Despite the performance, he took the loss. More of the same came from Wada in his second outing against the Saitama Seibu Lions, as he gave up four runs on five hits in five innings, but he managed to get the win. His third start was one of the best in his career, as he gave up one run on four hits in a complete-game effort, striking out a career-high 15 Marines to record his second win of the season. He continued his winning ways into interleague, where he won all five of his starts, going at least six innings every start and striking out at least five batters, by the end of interleague, he had won nine games.https://www.baseball- reference.com/bullpen/2010_Pacific_League_Most_Valuable_Player_Award Wada was selected for the All Star Series in 2010 and started game 1. His team-mate Sugiuchi Toshiya started game 2. They lead the Pacific League in wins through most of the season. It was their fine form that carried the Hawks to the league title in 2010 as the rest of the team's starters struggled. Wada was named Pacific league MVP for the 2010 season, helping the Hawks win the regular season pacific league pennant. =2011= Wada and the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks defeated the Chunichi Dragons in seven games to win the 2011 Japan Series. =Move to the MLB 2012‚Äì2015= On December 14, 2011, Wada agreed to a two-year deal with the Orioles, including an option for a third year.http://www.masnsports.com/school_of_roch/2011/12/orioles-passing-on- darvish-probably-introducing-wada-thursday.html Wada underwent Tommy John surgery on May 11, 2012 due to a partially torn ligament in his left elbow and spent the rest of the 2012 season on the disabled list. He started the 2013 season on the 60-day disabled list, and was expected to join the Orioles around June 1, 2013. He started a rehab assignment with the Triple-A Norfolk Tides on May 16. On June 14, he was activated from the 60-day disabled list and optioned to Norfolk. Chicago Cubs in 2015 Wada signed a minor-league contract with invitation to spring training with the Chicago Cubs on January 24, 2014, but he was released on March 23, 2014. He re-signed with the Cubs on another minor league contract the next day. His contract was selected from the Triple-A Iowa Cubs on June 22, and he was optioned to Iowa. He was recalled by the Cubs on July 8, and started the second game of that day's doubleheader against the Cincinnati Reds. In 2014 Wada compiled a 4-4 record and a 3.25 ERA. His strongest outing came on August 24, 2014 when he took a no-hitter into the seventh inning against the Baltimore Orioles. He was removed from the game after giving up a solo home run, the only hit he allowed in the contest. The Cubs won 2-1, and Wada was credited with the win. He was signed to a one- year $4 million contract after the season. Wada made seven starts for the Cubs during May and June 2015 before suffering a shoulder injury, he returned in September but pitched out of the bullpen.http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/baseball/cubs/ct-report-cubs- dodgers-spt-0623-20150622-story.html =2016= Wada returned to Japan, signing with the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks of Nippon Professional Baseball for the 2016 season.http://mlb.nbcsports.com/2015/11/03/cubs-left-hander-tsuyoshi- wada-goes-back-to-japan/ In 2016 season, Wada finished the regular season with a 24 Games pitched, a 15‚Äì5 Win‚Äìloss record, a 3.04 ERA, a 157 strikeouts in 163 innings.

On November 1, he pitched against the Yokohama DeNA BayStars as a starting pitcher in the 2017 Japan Series. =2018= Wada spent the 2018 season on rehabilitation for left shoulder pain. =2019= On June 5, Wada made a comeback and pitched Interleague play (NPB) against the Chunichi Dragons. In 2019 season, he finished the regular season with a 12 Games pitched, a 4‚Äì4 Win‚Äìloss record, a 3.90 ERA, a 45 strikeouts in 57 2/3 innings. On October 23, he pitched against the Yomiuri Giants as a starting pitcher in the 2019 Japan Series, and won the game for the first time in 16 years since the 2003 rookie year. Pitching style Wada is a 5 ft 11 in, 180 lb, left-handed pitcher with an unorthodox delivery, throwing from an overhand arm slot but deceiving hitters by keeping his throwing arm back and delaying its swing as he drives to the plate with his lower body. Wada's four- seam fastball has good late life but decidedly below-average velocity, topping out at 92 mph and usually sitting at 88-89 mph.FanGraphs Tsuyoshi Wada Pitch Type He compensates for this with his deceptive arm swing and late release point,\\"2008 Beijing Summer Olympics: Tsuyoshi Wada Profile & Bio, Photos & Videos\\" NBC Olympics complementing it with a solid-average slider, an occasional curveball, and a changeup.\\"Tsuyoshi Wada Profile ‚Äì 2008 Olympics\\" SI.com\\"Tsuyoshi Wada Pitching Data\\" NPB Tracker While Wada has good command of his pitches overall, recording a career walks per nine innings rate of 2.46 (until 2011 season), he has established somewhat of a reputation as a pitcher who is prone to throwing mistake pitches and giving up a large number of home runs. However, he has shown marked improvement in this area since making his professional debut, giving up progressively fewer homers in every season of his career except for 2005.

Haustl«´ng (Old Norse: 'Autumn-long'; anglicized as Haustl√∂ng) is a skaldic poem composed around the beginning of the 10th century by the Norwegian skald √ûj√≥√∞√≥lfr of Hvinir. The poem has been preserved in the 13th- century Prose Edda by Snorri Sturluson, who quotes two groups of stanzas from it and some verses to illustrate technical features of skaldic diction. Snorri also who drew inspiration from √ûj√≥√∞√≥lfr to redact his own version of the myths told in Haustl√∂ng. The poem describes mythological scenes said by the skald to have been painted on a shield: Loki's betraying of I√∞unn, the √Üsir's \\"old-age cure\\", who was snatched from them by the eagle-shaped j√∂tunn √ûjazi; and Thor's victorious combat against the strongest of the j√∂tnar, Hrungnir.  Title  The title of the poem, Haustl«´ng, translated as 'Autumn-long', may refer to its period of composition or gestation by the skald, identified from a relatively early period with √ûj√≥√∞√≥lfr of Hvinir.  Text  = Abduction of I√∞unn = The stanzas 1‚Äì13 of the poem depict the encounter of the √Üsir (gods) Odin, Loki and H≈ìnir with the j√∂tunn √ûjazi in the form of an eagle. As the three gods Odin, Loki and H≈ìnir are trying to cook an ox, the eagle-shaped √ûjazi asks for some. Loki strikes at him with a staff, but the latter sticks to the eagle and to Loki's hand as the bird flies out. The eagle then asks Loki to bring him the gods' \\"old-age cure\\", I√∞unn. Without I√∞unn, tells the poet, \\"all Ingi-Freyr‚Äôs kin [the √Üsir] became old and grey in their assembly; the powers were rather ugly in form\\". Then the gods catch Loki and force him to get I√∞unn back: \\"‚ÄòYou shall be trapped, Loki,‚Äô the angry one spoke thus, ‚Äòunless by some scheme you bring back the renowned maid, enlarger of the fetters' [gods'] joy.\\" Loki flies to J√∂tunheimar with the help of a hawk's flight-skin. There the J√∂tnar direct a storm-wind against the eagle-shaped god to keep him out from their abode. = Thor's duel with Hrungnir = In the stanzas 14‚Äì20 of Haustl√∂ng, √ûj√≥√∞√≥lfr depicts Thor's journey to the duel with the j√∂tunn Hrungnir while the entire cosmos reacts. Then Hrungnir and Thor fight by hurling their weapons at each other (the j√∂tunn's whetstone and Thor's hammer), and the poem alludes at the end to the removal of the piece of whetstone from Thor's head.

The system of education in Uganda has a structure of 7 years of primary education, 6 years of secondary education (divided into 4 years of lower secondary and 2 years of upper secondary school), and 3 to 5 years of post-secondary education, according to Education News Uganda The government of Uganda recognizes education as a basic human right and continues to strive to provide free primary education to all children in the country. However, issues with funding, teacher training, rural populations, and inadequate facilities continue to hinder the progress of educational development in Uganda. Girls in Uganda are disproportionately discriminated against in terms of education; they face harsher barriers when trying to gain an education and it has left the female population disenfranchised, despite government efforts to close the gap. Primary education The headmaster of Nsaasa Primary School answers a question for a USAID worker. The present system of education, known as Universal Primary Education (UPE), has existed since 1997, and its introduction was the result of democratisation and open elections, as there was great popular support for free education. Despite its promising boosts in enrolment, issues with funding and organisation have continued to plague the UPE. In 1999 there were six million pupils receiving primary education, compared to only two million in 1986. Numbers received a boost in 1997 when free primary education was made available to four children per family. According to Education News Uganda, one of the authoritative publications in Uganda, only some of primary school graduates go on to take any form of secondary education. This is contingent upon their passing their Primary Leaving Examinations (PLE). Uganda is one of East Africa's developing countries, bordered by Tanzania, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Sudan, and Kenya. It occupies and has 26,404,543 people.CIA, \\"CIA World Fact Book, 2004/Uganda\\", Central Intelligence Agency of the United States, 1 January 2003 According to CIA World Fact Book 2004, more than 80 percent of its population is rural and 35% of the people lives below poverty line. The United Nations characterised the current condition of Uganda with its unstable government and struggling people as \\"the world‚Äôs worst humanitarian crisis.\\" Community school at Kolir (Bukedea District) In 1997 the Ugandan government introduced the Universal Primary Education (UPE) program to improve enrollment and attainment in primary schools. It was initially realized to provide free education for four children per family, but the program was not performing based in its regulations due to the complex structure of Ugandan families. Most Ugandan families have more than four children and households started sending every child, which resulted in a rapid increase in student enrollment in primary schools. Due to the circumstances, President Museveni announced that the UPE was open to all children of all families (Omona 74). When the new policy was executed, schools experienced a massive influx of pupils and the demand for learning materials, teachers, and infrastructure became a challenge to the education system. Ngaka argues that the UPE resulted in costly consequences, including but not limited to a poor quality education, low pupil achievement, untrained teachers, improper infrastructures and classroom settings. The Human Rights Measurement Initiative gives Uganda a score of 92.3% for primary school enrolment. Uganda has seven years of primary education and the legal age for school entry is six. According to the Ministry of Education and Sports (MoES) statistics, school enrollments increased from three million to 5.3 million in 1997 and the number rapidly increased to seven million by 2004. Even though the increased number of pupils was perceived as a good thing, there were only 125,883 teachers, exceeding the UPE required pupil-teacher ratio of 1:40. The large number of pupils worsens the learning environment and it becomes harder for the teacher to be heard and teach. According to Arbeiter and Hartley, classes have between 70 and 150 pupils and there is over-age studying in all schools. Moyi explains the issue of many classes having the inappropriate age of pupils as having been driven by late enrolment or grade repetition, which in turn is caused by the poor quality of education. For instance, ‚Äúthird grade included pupils aged between seven to sixteen years and in sixth grade there were pupils up to nineteen years of age.\\" Secondary education There is a significant disparity between enrolment rates in primary and secondary schools in Uganda. Census data from 2004 indicates that for every ten students enrolled in primary schools, only one is enrolled at a secondary institution. The Human Rights Measurement Initiative gives Uganda a score of 36%. The structure of Uganda's secondary education system follows the education system of its former colonial masters, Britain. It is divided into the Ordinary level and Advanced level. Lower secondary consists of 4 years of schooling at the end of which students undertake Ordinary-level exams (O-level) in at least 8 subjects with a maximum of 10 subjects. Upper secondary consists of 2 years of schooling at the end of which students sit Advanced-level exams (A-level) in at least 3 subjects. The curriculum for lower secondary is currently being reviewed by the National Curriculum Development Centre, and a new curriculum is expected to be rolled out in 2014 or 2015. Three-year technical schools provide an alternative to lower secondary school. Alternatives for graduates from lower secondary school include: 2-3 year Technical institutes; 2 year Primary Teacher Colleges (PTC); Department Training Colleges (DTCs) and Upper secondary schools; including: * Kitante Hill Secondary School - Mixed day school * St Mary's Secondary School Kitende * St. Mary's College Kisubi - All boy's boarding school * Mount Saint Mary's College Namagunga - All-girl boarding school (S1 to S6) * Kibuli Secondary School - Mixed day and boarding school (S1 to S6) * Bugema Adventist Secondary School - Mixed boarding school(S1 to S6) * King's College Budo - Mixed boarding school (S1 to S6) * Gayaza High School - All-girl boarding school (S1 to S6) - Oldest girls secondary school * Uganda Martyrs' Secondary School Namugongo - One of the best in the country * Mengo Senior Secondary School - Mixed day school * Ndejje Senior Secondary School - Mixed boarding school (S1 to S6) * Ntare School *Yesu Akwagala high School-Kalungu Masaka. mixed day and boarding * Nabumali High School * St. Henry's College Kitovu * St. Kizito S S Kabowa - Mixed day and boarding school (S1 to S6) * Makerere College School * Comboni College * Kinaawa High School-mugongo- mixed school * German Secondary School Uganda * Kiira College Butiki - Boys' boarding school in Jinja (S1 to S6) founded in 1959 * Ebony College Luwero - Mixed day and boarding school (S1 to S6) * Seat of Wisdom Secondary School- All-girl day and boarding school (S1 to S6) * Sseguku Hill College- All-girl day and boarding school (S1 to S6)http://hellouganda.com/listing/listing.php?id=86 * Mackay Memorial College Mixed day and boarding school located in Nateete (S1 to S6) * Serere Township Secondary School\\\\- A Christian private \\"O\\" and \\"A\\" Level Mixed Day and Boarding School * St.Lawrence Group Of schools.

The majority of students go to universities, both public and private. Makerere University in Kampala has about half of the total student population in Uganda's universities.

The UN has led efforts to support this form of education through the UNESCO subdivision International Centre for Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET). According to a UN report, \\"Uganda‚Äôs TVET mission is defined as being to ensure that individuals and enterprises acquire the skills they need to raise productivity and income.\\"UNESCO-UNEVOC International Centre for Technical and Vocational Education and Training. \\"World TVET Database Uganda.\\" UNESCO, 2014. These TVET programs range in both complexity and scope. Some provide for craftsmen or technician level training that replaces standard modes of secondary education, while some TVET programs provide graduate engineering level education to students seeking education at the tertiary or post secondary level. = Literacy programs = Young mothers receive communal based informal education Early literacy movements were characterized by Western aid and leadership and have since given way to a more local decentralized approach to adult and youth literacy in Uganda. This transition is due in part to the realization of leaders in the West and in Uganda that literacy, and literacy in English particularly, is not a silver bullet for solving Uganda's economic issues. Much of the literacy work is conducted by NGOs acting on a local level in conjunction with local or village governments. There is a great demand for these programs, and their rates of return, satisfaction, and literacy retention for graduates have been high.The World Bank. \\"Adult Literacy Programs in Uganda.\\" The World Bank, 2001. However, these programs face great challenges including lack of funding, social reluctance, and a general lack of appreciation for literacy and literature. Northern Uganda Education is important for a successful post-conflict transition in Northern Uganda (see Conflict in Northern Uganda), as it helps develop peoples' abilities to break free of circles of violence and suffering.Kate Bird and Kate Higgins (2009) Conflict, education and the intergenerational transmission of poverty in Northern Uganda London: Overseas Development Institute Uganda's Universal Primary Education (UPE) has resulted in high enrolment rates in Northern Uganda, but education tends to be of a low quality and few pupils actually complete primary school. There are inadequate facilities; e.g. out of 238 primary schools in Pader, 47 are still under trees, limited teacher accommodation is causing high rates of teacher absenteeism and in some areas the average primary school teacher to student ratio is 1:200. Furthermore, there is some evidence to suggest completion of secondary school is necessary to provide an individual with a proper chance to escape poverty, as employment and income levels for those who completed primary schools are similar to those who did not attend at all. Their region has particular difficulties as teachers are hard to find, the conflict created a lost generation without an adequate education themselves and teachers from other areas are still highly concerned about security in the region.  Female education  Young women receiving teacher training Literacy discrepancies and educational inequity are a serious factor in the propagation of gender inequality. Female school attendance at all levels of society in Uganda is lower than that of men. This can be attributed to poverty, inadequate infrastructure, social pressures, and early maternity. These barriers continue throughout a woman's life, as one cited challenge to adult females' participation in literacy education in Uganda is home life. A World Bank report found that a significant force in preventing attendance at adult literacy classes was husbands stopping their wives from attending. According to United Nations' Girls Education Initiative statistics, literacy rates for young females still lag behind that of young boys by five percent, and nearly half of all girls in Uganda are married before the age of 18. Studies have shown that marriage and pregnancy rates prior to the age of 18 is decreased by roughly 7% when girls receive an extra year of education. Since 1997, UPE has aimed to bring equality of education to all the children of the country, specifically to those in rural, impoverished areas. It has had controversial results, but overall the UPE program has successfully allowed for higher enrollment, specifically among young girls. However, there is no clarity over whether there are true gender discrimination factors affecting whether the children go to school; it is noted that girls enrollment is dependent upon their age and their mother's level of schooling. Boys, on the other hand, are not affected by their father or mother's education level. Uganda received a score of .517 on the UN Development Programme Gender Equality index as reported in the Human Development Report. This measure evaluates the respective equality of women in various dimensions including: health, empowerment, and access to labor market. Uganda implemented the National Strategy for Girls' Education (NSGE) in order to bring equality in the education system for both women and girls and indicates some of the various impediments to them obtaining an education, and particularly secondary education. Ultimately, the NSGE framework is more inclined to identify these barriers rather than offer insight to help overcome these obstacles such as location, menstruation, home responsibilities and overall attitudes within the school domain. In 2007 the government implemented Universal Secondary Education (USE) with research showing that girls secondary public education enrollment rates increased approximately 49%. This policy is most beneficial to girls of poor households who otherwise would not have had the opportunity to attend due to fees and the general belief that boys secondary education yields more benefits than a girls. There are a few explanations for the increased enrollment aside from the USE policy such as poor or inaccurate reporting of student enrollment, the growing population, and new schools being built or included in the USE policy. Further, the overall performance since the USE has been utilized has decreased in the schools, as teachers are working in worse conditions and students are not as motivated, especially as their parents have now seen education as completely in the realm of the government whereas the policy meant to involve a plethora of actors to support children's education. The government has attempted various policies targeted at adult education, with inconsistent results. These include: the Functional Adult Literacy (FAL) Programme, Women's Empowerment Programme (WEP), and the National Adult Literacy Strategic Investment Plan (NALSIP). Some results prove that these programmes have bettered the living conditions of women, as they have increased influence in decision making, greater economic accumulation, better self-esteem, and knowledge of their rights in society. However, these results are not widespread; many women do not register for these programmes, especially those in the rural parts of Uganda. The women who do choose to enroll often have low attendance rates or high drop-out rates.

They had a blues-based sound and scored a Top 5 hit in the United States in 1969 with a cover of the Burt Bacharach song \\"Baby It's You\\", featuring Gayle McCormick on lead vocals. This disc sold over one million copies between July and October 1969, out-charted popular versions by the Beatles and the Shirelles, and received a gold record awarded by the R.I.A.A. Beginnings The group evolved from \\"The Smiths\\" (not to be confused with later English band The Smiths), which featured two of the same members, and had attempted a hit single with \\"Now I Taste The Tears\\", produced and arranged by Ron Budnik. \\"Tears\\" was a brooding, foreboding sounding record that didn't chart well. When the band did not succeed, McCormick, who had started her career singing songs by Tina Turner, Etta James and others, was added as a front woman and lead vocalist. The group were then discovered by 1960s rocker Del Shannon in a nightclub in Los Angeles. Shannon arranged \\"Baby It's You\\" for the group and got them signed to the ABC-Dunhill label. Career Smith released an album titled A Group Called Smith, which spent 11 weeks in the Top 40 album listings of the since-called Billboard 200 record chart. On the album, vocals were split amongst Rich Cliburn, Jerry Carter and McCormick. Smith recorded a second album titled Minus-Plus with lesser success since it only reached #74. Smith's version of \\"The Weight\\" was included on the epochal Easy Rider soundtrack because, due to contractual reasons, The Band's version, which appeared in the movie, was unavailable. Most of their material consisted of covers of popular rock and R&B; tunes. The band's singles \\"Take a Look Around\\" and \\"What Am I Gonna Do\\" reached the charts, but the group broke up after two albums. The band's hit \\"Baby It's You\\" was featured in Quentin Tarantino's Grindhouse film, Death Proof. McCormick solo career After Smith disbanded, McCormick went on to record three solo albums, Gayle McCormick in 1971, Flesh & Blood in 1972 and One More Hour in 1974. The single \\"It's A Cryin' Shame\\" from her eponymous first album was a minor hit for her, reaching #44 on the charts in 1971.

Biography =Early life and ordination= Julius D√∂pfner was born in Hausen (today a part of Bad Kissingen) to Julius Matth√§us and Maria D√∂pfner. He was baptised two days later, on 28 August. D√∂pfner had a sister, Maria, and two brothers, Paul and Otto. Entering the Augustinian-run gymnasium at M√ºnnerstadt in 1924, he later attended the Seminary of W√ºrzburg and the Pontifical German-Hungarian College in Rome. D√∂pfner was ordained to the priesthood by Archbishop Luigi Traglia on 29 October 1939, and then finished his studies at the Pontifical Gregorian University, from where he obtained a doctorate in theology in 1941, writing his dissertation on Cardinal John Henry Newman. He worked as a chaplain in Gro√üwallstadt until 1944. =Bishop= On 11 August 1948, D√∂pfner was appointed Bishop of W√ºrzburg by Pope Pius XII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 14 October from Archbishop Joseph Kolb, with Bishops Joseph Schr√∂ffer and Arthur Landgraf serving as co-consecrators. The consecration took place in the Neum√ºnster Collegiate church, W√ºrzburg, due to the fact that W√ºrzburg Cathedral was unusable due to the Bombing of W√ºrzburg in World War II. He was named Bishop of Berlin on 15 January 1957, and became the youngest member of the College of Cardinals when he was created Cardinal-Priest of Santa Maria della Scala (pro hac vice) by Pope John XXIII in the Consistory of 15 December 1958. Promoted to Archbishop of Munich and Freising on 3 July 1961, D√∂pfner participated in the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965), and sat on its Board of Presidency. Along with Cardinal Ra√∫l Silva Henr√≠quez, he assisted Cardinal L√©on-Etienne Duval in delivering one of the closing messages of the Council on 8 December 1965.Christus Rex. To Women The German prelate was one of the cardinal electors in the 1963 papal conclave, which selected Pope Paul VI. From 1965 to 1976, D√∂pfner was Chairman of the Conference of the German Bishops and thus the spokesman of the Catholic Church in Germany. He was often described as papabile, but he died at age 62 in the archiepiscopal residence of Munich. Views =Church reform= The Cardinal, who was considered liberal in his positions,Time Magazine.

He allowed only one run on four hits in 7 2/3 innings in a game the Dodgers eventually won in 11 innings.August 13, 1988 Dodgers vs. Giants box score He got his first career win on August 29 against the Montreal Expos. That season, he won his first and only World Series ring with the 1988 Los Angeles Dodgers. He had a breakout season in 1990, when he won 20 games, struck out 18 batters in a game (on June 4), was selected an All-Star, and finished second in strikeouts as well as in the Cy Young Award balloting. He remained a solid pitcher for several years, winning 17 games in 1991 and 1995. On July 14 of the latter year, Mart√≠nez no- hit the Florida Marlins 7-0 at Dodger Stadium. In his no-hitter, the only thing that kept him from a perfect game was a walk to Tommy Gregg with two outs in the 8th inning. Early in the 1998 season, Mart√≠nez suffered a torn rotator cuff and torn cartilage, which was surgically repaired on June 30. The Dodgers did not pick up a $5.6 million option after 1998 and he signed with the Boston Red Sox. In 11 seasons with the Dodgers, he was 123-77 with a 3.45 ERA and 1,314 strikeouts and was the team's opening day starter five times. =Boston Red Sox= Ram√≥n started the 1999 season in the minor leagues for rehabilitation. He was called up by the Red Sox in August, to pitch again alongside brother Pedro, making four starts for a 3-1 record with an ERA of 3.05. Martinez was less successful in 2000, with a record of 10-8 and a 6.03 ERA, and his option for 2001 was not picked up by the Red Sox. After his two years with the Red Sox, he signed again with the Dodgers, but they released him at the end of spring training. He played briefly with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 2001 before retiring. Family Ram√≥n has three brothers, Pedro, Nelson and Jesus. While he was a starter for the Dodgers, Ram√≥n repeatedly asserted that Pedro was an even better pitcher than he was. Nevertheless, Dodgers management thought Pedro was too small to be successful and traded him away. Pedro went on to win three Cy Young Awards with the Expos and Red Sox, and was a first-ballot inductee to the Hall of Fame in 2015. Ram√≥n and Pedro were eventually reunited as teammates during Ram√≥n's two years with the Red Sox.

Cast * Ivan Sergei as David \\"Jill\\" Jillefsky * Amanda Peet as Jacqueline \\"Jack\\" Barrett * Sarah Paulson as Elisa Cronkite * Jaime Pressly as Audrey Griffin * Justin Kirk as Barto Zane * Simon Rex as Mikey Russo Production The main characters were David Jillefsky (Ivan Sergei) and Jacqueline Barrett (Amanda Peet, replacing Amelia Heinle after the pilot). The two become romantically involved just as they both face major obstacles in their relationships with their friends. The show's theme song was \\"Truth About Romeo\\" written by Pancho's Lament, the stage name of songwriter Jeff Cohen. It was performed by Pancho's Lament during the first season and by David Crosby and Beth Hart in the second season. Due to the average ratings of the first season, the second season was only 13 episodes long and was aired as a midseason show. The final episode detailed the problems during preparations for the couple's wedding. Jacqueline discovered she was pregnant, but before she could tell David, he decided that their relationship was moving too fast and he wanted to call the wedding off and move things slower. Despite the rallying of fans, the series was not renewed for a third season, so the series ended in a cliffhanger. Co-stars Amanda Peet and Sarah Paulson would later reunite for the NBC series Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip, which debuted in 2006.

Early in his reign, in March 656 BC, Psamtik I dispatched a powerful naval fleet to Thebes and compelled the then serving God's Wife of Amun, Shepenupet II, a daughter of Piye, to adopt Nitocris as her heir to this powerful office. The ceremony of the adoption and elevation of Nitocris I is commemorated in the well known Adoption Stela. It is not known at what date she assumed the office of Divine Adoratrice of Amun, but she served in this position until Year 4 of Apries in 585 BC. Prior to her career in this office, the Assyrians had invaded Egypt in 671 BC, sacked Thebes, and robbed its temples of their many treasures.

Its organisation, structure and recruitment were guided by the Coalition Provisional Authority after the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and it is commanded by the reformed Iraqi Ministry of the Interior. \\"IP\\" refers to the Iraqi Police, and \\"ISF\\" to the broader Iraqi security forces. The current commander of the Federal Police Forces is Lieutenant General Raed Shaker Jawdat.  History  The current Iraqi Police has some links with the pre-war Iraqi police service. The prewar police service was low in repression priority and was professional. Therefore, the police was expected to remain cohesive and be a useful instrument also after the invasion. It was intended to form the basis for the police force of the new Iraq, but the civil disorder caused this project to be abandoned. Following the emergency stipend payment, some police came back especially in Baghdad and the U.S. Army military police conducted emergency training. At the same time, in the south the British forces began to establish local police forces in coordination with Shiite religious leaders. In the north, Kurdish security forces did not experience any interruption, and in Mosul a thousand former police officers were hired by Major General David Petraeus in order to maintain the public order. In the meantime, the Coalition Provisional Authority worked with the renewed Ministry of Interior in order to purge Baathist officials (7,000 police officers fired by Bernard Kerik only in Baghdad) and to establish a police forces in short terms. In the first four months, the first training course was launched and over 4,000 officers were trained. In 2003 recruitment, applicants were mostly former soldiers and police officers who served under the Baathist rule. At the end of 2003, Iraqi Police formally totalled 50,000 officers.  Organization and oversight  Police river boat on the Tigris In 2009 the Iraqi Police was under the command of Major General Hussein Jassim Alawadi. The Multi-National Security Transition Command ‚Äì Iraq (MNSTC-I) was a United States Central Command organisation tasked to train, mentor and equip all Iraqi civilian security forces. MNSTC-I also had the goal of training their counterparts in the Iraqi government of Iraq to assume their role. MNSTC-I was dissolved in 2010. The Iraqi Police had three main branches: * Iraqi Police Service: Uniformed organisation tasked with the general patrol of Iraq's cities and incident response * Federal Police: Paramilitary organisation designed to bridge the gap between the police and the army. It responds to domestic incidents beyond the capabilities of the IPS, but not severe enough for the Iraqi Army. The FP originated as the Special Police (SP) on Aug. 15, 2004 to provide national rapid-response capability to counter armed insurgency, large-scale civil disobedience and riots. In 2005, the Ministry of the Interior consolidated its ad-hoc Police Battalions into the Emergency Response Unit (a SWAT unit), the 8th Police mechanised brigade (3 motorised battalions), the Public Order Division (4 brigades/12 battalions), and the Special Police Commando Division (4 brigades/12 battalions). It became the Iraq National Police (NP) March 30, 2006, and on August 1, 2009 the NP was renamed as the Federal Police. Iraqi National Police Renamed Federal Police By 2012-13 there were four Federal Police Divisions, spread out around the country. The 1st and 2nd Motorized Divisions were headquartered in Baghdad and created out of the former Commando Division and the Public Order Division. The 3rd Federal Police Division, with its headquarters in Mosul, collapsed in the ISIS 2014 Northern Iraq offensive by 9 June.http://www.insideiraqipolitics.com/Files/IIPNinawaExcerpts.pdf, page 13. The 4th Division was headquartered in Basra. Some reinforcing units, such as the 9th Brigade, 4th Federal Police Division, also withered once deployed to the front lines. * Supporting forces: Remaining supporting organisations, primarily the Department of Border Enforcement (tasked with securing Iraq's borders and ports of entry) and the Iraqi Prison Service. The Facilities Protection Service protects buildings owned by the Iraqi government.  Uniforms  Iraqi Police officer steadied during target practice The Iraqi Police Service uniform consists of a long-sleeved, light-blue shirt with a blue brassard on the left arm with an embroidered Iraqi flag and \\"Iraqi Police\\" embossed in English and Arabic, black or light-blue trousers or blue combat trousers similar to those of the United States Navy. They wear a dark- blue baseball cap with \\"POLICE\\" in white letters or body armour and a PASGT helmet. Federal Police wear a black-and-blue camouflage uniform similar to the U.S. Army Combat Uniform Universal Camouflage Pattern, which includes a baseball cap, body armour and PASGT helmet. FP uniforms are issued when an officer has completed training; officers not yet trained wear a variety of uniforms, including woodland camouflage. FP officers are organised into brigades which cover geographic areas. Rank insignia for the IP is nearly identical to that of the Iraqi Army, except that the shoulder boards are usually dark blue.  Ranks  Officers ranks and ranks of NCOs and constables are the same that of Iraqi army, from highest to lowest, with symbol on epaulette, as below: * Colonel general (ŸÅÿ±ŸäŸÇ ÿßŸàŸÑ) : one silver eagle, two silver stars and two silver crossed swords * Lieutenant general (ŸÅÿ±ŸäŸÇ) : one silver eagle, one silver star and two silver crossed swords * Major general (ŸÑŸàÿßÿ°) : one silver eagle and two silver crossed swords * Brigadier (ÿπŸÖŸäÿØ) : one silver eagle and three silver stars * Colonel (ÿπŸÇŸäÿØ) : one silver eagle and two silver stars * Lieutenant colonel (ŸÖŸÇÿØŸÖ) : one silver eagle and one silver star * Major (ÿ±ÿßÿ¶ÿØ) : one silver eagle * Captain (ŸÜŸÇŸäÿ®) : three silver stars * First lieutenant (ŸÖŸÑÿßÿ≤ŸÖ ÿßŸàŸÑ) : two silver stars * Lieutenant (ŸÖŸÑÿßÿ≤ŸÖ) : one silver star  Controversy  Iraqi Police officers patrol downtown Najaf. The Iraqi Police has faced a number of problems since it was reformed by the Coalition Provisional Authority after the fall of Baghdad. It became the target of fighters from inside and outside Iraq; thousands of officers have been killed by gunfire and bombings by Iraqi insurgents, foreign terrorists and, in some cases, friendly fire from Coalition troops. An estimated 4,250 Iraqi police officers were killed from January 2005 and 4 March 2006. Due to high unemployment in Iraq, many young Iraqi men have volunteered to join the police forces. A number of recruits have been killed by suicide bombers and suicide car bombs whilst queueing at police stations. The IP has also been infiltrated by insurgents, who use access to privileged information, training and weapons for their own motives. Many police stations have been attacked, blown up, had weapons stolen from them and have been occupied by opponents of the Iraqi government; as a result, many police officers have abandoned their posts. As of October 7, 2006, 12,000 Iraqi Police deserted and 4,000 were killed. On 17 August 2016, a market owner was killed by a police officer after a brawl began when the market owner \\"refused to back his vehicle\\" in Baghdad.  Sharia  The Baathist regime began to increase the role of Islam in government during the early 1990s, with required religious education in the schools, honor killings and religious committees to punish those deemed in violation of traditional mores (such as adultery, fornication and homosexuality). The Iraqi constitution stipulates Islam as the official religion, enacted laws must conform to sharia and provisions for civil rights and liberties are in accordance with public mores. Many members of the Iraqi police and Interior Ministry have ties to the Islamic fundamentalist Badr Brigade, which have been given leeway to punish those suspected of immorality. In Basra, police guarding a local park reportedly made no attempt to stop an armed group from severely beating two women and shooting a male Iraqi friend of theirs to death.  Iraqi government  The Iraqi government has been accused of using (or allowing) the police and other groups to carry out sectarian killings and kidnappings of Sunni Iraqis. In December 2005, US troops found 625 inmates held in \\"very overcrowded\\" conditions in a Baghdad Interior Ministry building. Twelve of the prisoners reportedly had signs of torture and malnutrition. The story gave credence to the accusations, sowing further distrust of the police force. A report into the findings at the building was promised by Iraqi president Ibrahim Jaafari at the end of December 2005, but as of 4 May 2006 no report was issued. The United States Department of State released a 2006 human rights report accusing the Iraqi police of widespread atrocities. In October of that year, the Iraqi government dismantled a police brigade with connections to sectarian death squads. The dismantled brigade was transferred to a US base for retraining. Other police brigades will be investigated for links to death squads.  Strength  Iraqi policewomen in 2007 The number of police is difficult to estimate, since local police chiefs may exaggerate their numbers to obtain increased funding for their stations and people drift in and out of service. Although the total Ministry of Interior payroll exceeds 300,000, many are off-duty at any given time. As of mid-2007, the National Police Forces employed about 25,000 officers. The number is somewhat misleading, because one-third to one-half of the NP are on leave at any given time.  Deaths  Iraqi Interior Minister Jawad al-Bulani announced that as of December 24, 2005, 12,000 police officers in Iraq died in the line of duty since the 2003 US-led invasion.  Transition teams  Large-scale operations were conducted by coalition forces to assist in policing and train the Iraqi Police (IP) and security forces. Police transition teams (PTTs) are US military-police squads deployed to Iraqi Police stations. The teams conduct joint patrols with the IP, share station defense and gather station information and counter-terrorism intelligence. The joint patrols of the PTTs have helped curb violence, increasing respect for Iraq's police force. These duties were later performed by United States Air Force Security Forces members. An International Police Liaison Officer (IPLO), an experienced US police officer, accompanied most of the transition teams to aid post-academy training of the IP. National Police Transition Teams (NPTT) are 11-man military transition teams embedded in Iraqi Police units at the battalion, brigade, division and corps levels. These teams are supplied by the US Army and the US Marine Corps. Like the PTTs, each team is assisted by an IPLO and one to six local interpreters.  Equipment  Members of the Iraqi Police use the Glock 19 and HS2000 handgun, and may carry a shotgun, Type 81, or AK-47 rifle on patrol. Iraqi Federal Police have also been seen using the Croatian-made HS Produkt VHS-2 bullpup carbine during military options against ISIS in northern Iraq. For marine operations, the police are equipped with Safe Boat International 230 T-Top patrol boats.

The warriors were mostly made up of the Cherokee, led by Dragging Canoe. Small groups of Shawnee and Creek lived with and fought with them, in addition to the occasional bands of Muskogee, who also served as allies. Renegade whites; white traders; Spanish, French, and British agents; and runaway slaves also inhabited the area.The Annals of Tennessee to the End of the Eighteenth Century, a History; Ramsey, J. G. M.; 1853; [online transcriptions]; retrieved June 2013 =Town= After those wars, the settlement of Nickajack eclipsed the neighboring town of Running Water (Dragging Canoe's seat of operations) as the dominant town in the immediate area, due to its position on the river near the crossing of the \\"Federal Road\\" running from Athens to Nashville over the Tennessee River. One of the town's more prominent residents, Turtle-at-Home (Dragging Canoe's brother), owned the ferry at that crossing and had other commercial interests. In addition, Turtle-at-Home was on the council of the Lower Towns and served as Speaker of the Cherokee National Council. = Cave = Nickajack Cave, formerly called Tecallassee, near the site of the former town, may have been used as a hideout and cache by the Chickamauga Cherokee. Its deposits of bat guano were mined by Confederate forces during the Civil War, and the cave became one of the leading sources of saltpeter for the Confederate Powderworks at Augusta, Georgia. The road used to transport the material became known as the \\"Nickajack Trail\\".  Civil War era  The Nickajack region was a loosely defined region of North Alabama and East Tennessee where public sentiment adhered more strongly to the Union. In the period leading up to the American Civil War, there had been increasing talk of secession by the politicians representing the interests of wealthy plantation owners in the Black Belt that stretched across central and southern Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia. Citizens in the more mountainous regions of North Alabama and East Tennessee, where slave ownership was less common, often remained in favor of the Union, believing, as some said at the time, that rebellion would become \\"a war for the rich, fought by the poor.\\" A proposal arose, should Tennessee and Alabama attempt to secede, that adjacent territories in North Alabama and East Tennessee secede from their respective states and join into a new state called Nickajack that remained within the Union joined at the southeast corner of Kentucky. Nothing became of the idea, although Winston County, Alabama discussed secession. The area's reputation as the Free State of Winston persists and was mentioned in the bestselling novel To Kill a Mockingbird. =Regional discord= On January 7, 1861, Alabama Governor Andrew B. Moore called delegates from Alabama to Montgomery for a convention to debate the Articles of Secession. Delegates from South Alabama wanted the convention delegates to determine the vote, while northern delegates wanted the issue put to a popular vote. Because the apportionment of delegates to the convention was based on total population (including slaves), the Southern delegates effectively voted \\"on behalf\\" of the African-American slaves, who made up a large proportion of the population in the region. The results of the poll determined that the balance of power would shift to the North, where the population was mostly white. Ultimately, the Alabama Ordinance of Secession was passed by a vote of 61 to 39, split along geographic lines. In addition to Nickajack, Winston County, Alabama, threatened to form its own Free State of Winston. These threats of internal separation never materialized, but men in the region fiercely resisted conscription into the Confederate Army, with many joining the Union Army.

The steel truss vertical lift bridge and specially-built causeway connect the Hobart suburbs of and . The bridge was completed in 1946 and accommodates a two-lane highway, a single track railway and a grade-separated footpath. The bridge is the major connector of the Midland Highway on the eastern shore and the Brooker Highway on the western shore. The bridge is the oldest surviving lift span bridge in Australia; lifting of the bridge can cause considerable traffic delays. History The Bridgewater Bridge was one of the first bridges constructed in Tasmania following British settlement in 1803, and gave its name to the nearby suburb of Bridgewater. Lieutenant-Governor George Arthur commissioned the construction of the bridge and causeway as part of the Launceston Hobart Trunk Road, linking both Tasmanian towns and providing easier access to farmlands in the interior of Tasmania. =The causeway= Construction commenced on the bridge in 1829. Operations were supervised by Roderic O'Connor. The causeway, which was constructed first, was built by a workforce of 200 convicts who had been condemned to secondary punishment. These convicts, using nothing but wheelbarrows, shovels and picks and sheer muscle power, shifted of soil, stones and clay. The finished causeway stretched , although did not span the full width of the Derwent. The original plan apparently called for a viaduct, but this plan was abandoned and the half-built arches were filled in to form the present causeway. =The first bridges= Upon completion of the causeway, a punt operated across the deep, navigable section of the river, but could not cope with traffic demands. To resolve this issue, the first bridge across this point of the Derwent opened in 1849. The bridge was designed by the firm of architect and former convict James Blackburn. Being a swing bridge, it could pivot out of the way to allow ships to pass. In the late 1870s, the Launceston-Hobart Railway called for modifications to the causeway so they could lay tracks over it. The causeway required widening and the swing bridge was modified as well. On 22 July 1886, a train from the north was passing over the bridge when the engine left the tracks and tipped over, hanging precariously above the water on the edge of the southern end of the swing bridge. The fireman and driver were injured, but no one was killed and the locomotive was salvageable. The cause of the accident was found to be that the rails failed to match properly when the bridge was closed, so the bridge was modified again to solve this problem. The bridge lasted several decades more before being replaced by another swing bridge in the early 1900s. The pivot and the sandstone abutments of this bridge are still standing and can be viewed on the left of the present bridge as one travels towards the north. Both the first and second swing bridges did not run straight off the end of the causeway; rather, they turned slightly to the right. The second swing bridge was left standing when the present lifting bridge was being constructed to prevent traffic stoppages, so the present bridge deviates from the causeway quite appreciably. The current lift bridge The Bridgewater Bridge (facing east). The rail line runs on the left (north side) of the causeway and bridge. The Bridgewater Bridge, Tasmania, from the eastern access near the town of Bridgewater (facing west). Construction on the present steel vertical lift bridge across the Derwent began in 1939. It was briefly interrupted by World War II, but was finally completed in 1946. It consists of a long concrete bridge that leads off the end of the causeway, and a steel lifting section just before the northern bank of the river. The lifting section is one of only a few remaining in the Southern Hemisphere, and is the largest of its kind remaining in Australia. The bridge was designed to last a century without replacement. A small control house stands on the lifting section. Inside are the switches and locks which operate the bridge. Until 1984, the Australian Newsprint Mills (now Norske Skog Paper) at Boyer, near New Norfolk, upstream from Bridgewater, moved all its produce by river. Many barges were used to transport paper from the mill to the storage sheds at Pavilion Point at Hobart, and for this reason the bridge was required to open very frequently. Consequently, a bridge-keeper lived on-site and opened and closed the bridge when required. However, when the decision was made to cease river transportation, an on-site keeper was no longer necessary, so although the bridge can and does still open, bridge openings are now infrequent. In response to vandalism of the house which contains the bridge operating controls, closed-circuit television cameras were installed along the lifting span sometime between 2003 and 2005. On 30 October 2006 a fault was found in one of the steel cables holding up the two concrete counterweights above the road, forcing the temporary closure of the bridge. This closure caused peak hour traffic delays, mainly along the East Derwent Highway, due to traffic being diverted over the Bowen and Tasman bridges. The cables, which were put in place in 1994, were supposed to have a 20-year lifespan, and as they have lasted barely over half that time. = Engineering heritage = The bridge received an Engineering Heritage Marker from Engineers Australia as part of its Engineering Heritage Recognition Program. Replacement bridge Between 2001 and 2005, the Australian Government granted A$100 million towards the replacement of the Bridgewater Bridge, soon after the Tasmanian Government decided to build the replacement to the south of the existing bridge. However, after years of inaction the State government has encountered some heritage issues with replacing the bridge and is now to be replaced as part of the final stage of the Brighton Bypass and Midland Highway upgrade. Towards the end of 2010, the State government released plans for a new Derwent River crossing, next to the current bridge. The new bridge, when complete, will carry the Midland Highway and the old bridge will be left open for rail, pedestrian and local traffic. While the Bridgewater Bridge is recognised as being limited in its ability to perform the function of the Midland Highway, it also has important heritage values and is recognised as a landmark in the area. From 2006 until 2010, the lifting segment of the Bridgewater Bridge was out of commission, due to failed maintenance. The State Government spent $14 million to refurbish the bridge and provide it with a further 15 years of life, until a replacement can be built. This refurbishment replaced the vandalised control house and its controls and all of the cabling to raise and lower the bridge. Touted as a \\"major tourist attraction\\" with expected regular openings for tourist and private vessels to travel between Hobart and , the bridge refurbishment has been a major embarrassment to the Tasmanian Government. It has opened no more than six times successfully and has caused major traffic delays, including on a well-promoted occasion the lift span raised approximately and was stuck in that position for several minutes before being lowered again. In March 2016, Infrastructure Tasmania published its review of a design and cost estimate for the construction of a replacement structure for the existing Bridgewater Bridge, which considered various options for a replacement structure and provided advice as to the most feasible crossing solution. As part of the 2018-19 federal budget, the Australian Government announced a $461 million grant towards the construction of a new Bridgewater Bridge, representing 80 per cent of the expected total construction cost. The Tasmanian Government is expected to contribute $115 million. Construction was expected to commence in 2019; however, following independent assessment of the project by Infrastructure Australia in July 2019, the evaluation identified a range of issues, which may add to costs and require further work to address, and recommended that the Tasmanian Government revise its business case. The project is scheduled to start design and approvals in 2019, with the design to be agreed by the end of 2020. Substantive construction is expected to commence in 2022 and completion is targeted in 2024. The concrete box girder bridge is expected to carry dual carriageways with a clearance of above the Derwent River.

His story, along with that of Texas patient David Vetter, was used to create the 1976 made-for-TV movie The Boy in the Plastic Bubble. In the film, John Travolta played \\"Tod\\", a teenage boy who lived in a sterile bubble due to illness. DeVita was 14 when the film, unauthorized by his family, was released. In 2004, the story of DeVita's life, illness, death, and the lasting impact of these events on his family was examined in a memoir by his younger sister, Elizabeth DeVita-Raeburn, entitled The Empty Room: Surviving the Loss of a Brother or Sister at Any Age. Ted DeVita was the son of NIH oncologist and researcher Vincent T. DeVita, Jr., MD, who diagnosed his son's illness in 1972. Severe aplastic anemia is a rare disease in which the body is suddenly unable to produce new blood cells and platelets. Its victims have no effective immune system and must be protected from infection. DeVita was admitted to the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center. While scientists and physicians tried all known treatments for his condition, DeVita was isolated in Building 10, in a \\"laminar airflow room\\". This specialized room on \\"13-East\\" had been created in 1969 to protect leukemia patients whose immune systems had been compromised by chemotherapy. Physicians hoped the sterile room and frequent blood transfusions would sustain him until he recovered spontaneously or an effective treatment was found. The \\"laminar airflow room\\" gave DeVita a living space the size of a normal bedroom. He was able to walk around and participate in many normal activities, but could be touched only with gloved hands. He lived surrounded by plastic sheeting containing a door-sized space through which sterilized objects, including food, clothing, and books, and occasionally doctors and nurses, could pass in and out. He was surrounded by a \\"curtain\\" of air, a steady outflow of positive air pressure to expel potential pathogens. His family recalls DeVita as a bright and curious boy who grew to be a strong-willed teenager. DeVita's emotional adjustment to the confinement and isolation was difficult. From a later review of medical notes, his younger sister, Elizabeth DeVita-Raeburn, learned the staff saw DeVita as alternately \\"hostile, angry, and cheery\\". Especially during the first year, he indulged in tantrums, throwing things out of the sterile area in his room, and creating a cavity in the wall to hide thousands of his hated pills. On the few occasions DeVita left his room, he was enclosed in a spacesuit and helmet, with an air pump that expelled pathogens. The suit drew so much attention that he rarely chose to leave. His sister remembers that the only time DeVita was not stared at was at a Star Trek convention. Ted DeVita died in 1980 at NIH Hospital in Bethesda. His death was not primarily due to aplastic anemia, but was caused by iron overload from too many transfusions. Treatment for DeVita's disease is much more successful today, with a cure rate of up to 80 percent of aplastic anemia patients. Bone marrow transplants, transfusions, iron chelating regimens, and brief periods in positive airflow rooms are used in treating these patients.

Nearby places include Bigfork, Talmoon, Bowstring, Deer River, and Effie. Despite its unincorporated status, Marcell appears on most more detailed maps of Minnesota due to the presence of several locally important businesses and the lack of larger communities in the surrounding area. History Marcell was founded under the name Turtle Lake in 1905. The name was changed to Marcell the following year due to a name conflict with other communities named Turtle Lake. The name Marcell is in honor of Andy Marcell, a conductor on the former Minneapolis and Rainy River Railway, who was involved in a railway accident in the area. The site of the town center was originally at a store operated by John Lundeen on Big Turtle Lake, but was moved in 1910 to its present location near the railway.

Kernighan and P. J. Plauger, is a study of programming style, advocating the notion that computer programs should be written not only to satisfy the compiler or personal programming \\"style\\", but also for \\"readability\\" by humans, specifically software maintenance engineers, programmers and technical writers. It was originally published in 1974. The book pays explicit homage, in title and tone, to The Elements of Style, by Strunk & White and is considered a practical template promoting Edsger Dijkstra's structured programming discussions. It has been influential and has spawned a series of similar texts tailored to individual languages, such as The Elements of C Programming Style, The Elements of C# Style, The Elements of Java(TM) Style, The Elements of MATLAB Style, etc. The book is built on short examples from actual, published programs in programming textbooks. This results in a practical treatment rather than an abstract or academic discussion. The style is diplomatic and generally sympathetic in its criticism, and unabashedly honest as well-- some of the examples with which it finds fault are from the authors' own work (one example in the second edition is from the first edition). Lessons Its lessons are summarized at the end of each section in pithy maxims, such as \\"Let the machine do the dirty work\\": # Write clearly ‚Äî don't be too clever. # Say what you mean, simply and directly. # Use library functions whenever feasible. # Avoid too many temporary variables. # Write clearly ‚Äî don't sacrifice clarity for efficiency. # Let the machine do the dirty work. # Replace repetitive expressions by calls to common functions. # Parenthesize to avoid ambiguity. # Choose variable names that won't be confused. # Avoid unnecessary branches. # If a logical expression is hard to understand, try transforming it. # Choose a data representation that makes the program simple. # Write first in easy-to- understand pseudo language; then translate into whatever language you have to use. # Modularize. Use procedures and functions. # Avoid gotos completely if you can keep the program readable. # Don't patch bad code ‚Äî rewrite it. # Write and test a big program in small pieces. # Use recursive procedures for recursively-defined data structures. # Test input for plausibility and validity. # Make sure input doesn't violate the limits of the program. # Terminate input by end-of-file marker, not by count. # Identify bad input; recover if possible. # Make input easy to prepare and output self-explanatory. # Use uniform input formats. # Make input easy to proofread. # Use self- identifying input. Allow defaults. Echo both on output. # Make sure all variables are initialized before use. # Don't stop at one bug. # Use debugging compilers. # Watch out for off-by-one errors. # Take care to branch the right way on equality. # Be careful if a loop exits to the same place from the middle and the bottom. # Make sure your code does \\"nothing\\" gracefully. # Test programs at their boundary values. # Check some answers by hand. # 10.0 times 0.1 is hardly ever 1.0. # 7/8 is zero while 7.0/8.0 is not zero. # Don't compare floating point numbers solely for equality. # Make it right before you make it faster. # Make it fail-safe before you make it faster. # Make it clear before you make it faster. # Don't sacrifice clarity for small gains in efficiency. # Let your compiler do the simple optimizations. # Don't strain to re-use code; reorganize instead. # Make sure special cases are truly special. # Keep it simple to make it faster. # Don't diddle code to make it faster ‚Äî find a better algorithm. # Instrument your programs. Measure before making efficiency changes. # Make sure comments and code agree. # Don't just echo the code with comments ‚Äî make every comment count. # Don't comment bad code ‚Äî rewrite it. # Use variable names that mean something. # Use statement labels that mean something. # Format a program to help the reader understand it. # Document your data layouts. # Don't over-comment Modern readers may find it a shortcoming that its examples use older procedural programming languages (Fortran and PL/I) which are quite different from those popular today. Few of today's popular languages had been invented when this book was written. However, many of the book's points that generally concern stylistic and structural issues transcend the details of particular languages.

This view is opposite to the idea of monogenism, which posits a single origin of humanity. Modern scientific views no longer favor the polygenic model, with the monogenic \\"Out of Africa\\" theory and its variants being the most widely accepted models for human origins. Historically, polygenism has been used to advance racial inequality.  Origins  Many oral traditions feature polygenesis in their creation stories. For example, Bambuti mythology and other creation stories from the pygmies of Congo state that the supreme God of the pygmies, Khonvoum, created three different races of humans separately out of three kinds of clay: one black, one white, and one red.Mbiti, John, African Religions & philosophy, Heinemann, 1990, p. 91. In some cultures, polygenism in the creation narrative served as an etiological function. These narratives provided an explanation as to why other people groups exist who are not affiliated with their tribe. Moreover, distinctions made between the creation of foreign people groups and the tribe or ethnic group to which the creation myth pertains served to reinforce tribal or ethnic unity, the need to exercise wariness and caution when dealing with outsiders, or the unique nature of the relationship between that tribe and the deities of their religious system. An example may be found in the creation myth of the Asmat people, a hunter-gatherer tribe situated along the south-western coast of New Guinea. This creation myth asserts that the Asmat themselves came into being when a deity placed carved wooden statues in a ceremonial house and began to beat a drum. The statues became living humans and began to dance. Some time later, a great crocodile attempted to attack this ceremonial house, but was defeated by the power of the deity. The crocodile was cut into several pieces and these were tossed in different directions. Each piece became one of the foreign tribes known to the Asmat.Feder, Kenneth L.; Michael Alan Park, Human Antiquity: An Introduction to Physical Anthropology and Archaeology, Mayfield Publishing Company, 1989, pp. 3-4. The idea is also found in some ancient Greek and Roman literature. For example, the Roman Emperor Julian the Apostate in his Letter to a Priest wrote that he believed Zeus made multiple creations of man and women.Julian, Letter to a Priest, trans. WC Wright, The Works of the Emperor Julian, 3 vols. LCL, Cambridge, Mass., 1913-23. In his Against the Galilaens Julian presented his reasoning for this belief. Julian had noticed that the Germanics and Scythians (northern nations) were different in their bodies (i.e. complexion) to the Ethiopians. He therefore could not imagine such difference in physical attributes as having originated from common ancestry, and so maintained separate creations for different races. In early classical and medieval geography the idea of polygenism surfaced because of the suggested possibility of there being inhabitants of the antipodes (Antichthones). These inhabitants were considered by some to have separate origins because of their geographical extremity.Flint, Valeria, Monsters and the Antipodes in the Early Middle Ages and Enlightenment, Viator, Vol. 15, 1984, pp. 65-80. The religion of the Ainu people claims that the ancestors of the Ainu people arrived on Earth from the skies separate from the other races. See Ainu creation myth. Main beliefs Traditionally, most Jews, Christians and Muslims have embraced monogenism in the form that all modern humans ultimately are descended from a single mating pair, named Adam and Eve. In this context, polygenism described all alternative explanations for the origin of humankind that involved more than two individual \\"first people\\". This definition of polygenism is still employed among some Creationists and within the Roman Catholic Church (see Humani generis). With the development of the evolutionary paradigm of human origins, it has become widely recognized within the scientific community that at no point did there exist a single \\"first man\\" and a single \\"first woman\\" who constituted the first true humans and to whom all lineages of modern humans ultimately converge. If Adam and Eve ever existed as distinct historical persons, they were members of a much larger population of the same species.Tenesa, P. Navarro, B. J. Hayes et al. \\"Recent Human Effective Population Size Estimated from Linkage Disequilibrium,\\" Genome Research 17 (2007), pp. 520‚Äì6 However, a common scientific explanation of human origins asserts that the population directly ancestral to all modern humans remained united as a single population by constant gene flow. Therefore, on the level of the entire human population, this explanation of human origin is classified as monogenism. All modern humans share the same origin from this single ancestral population. Modern polygenists do not accept either theological or scientific monogenism. They believe that the variation among human racial types cannot be accounted for by monogenism or by evolutionary processes occurring since the proposed recent African origin of modern humans. Polygenists reject the argument that human races must belong to a single species because they can interbreed. There are several polygenist hypotheses, including biblical creationist polygenism and polygenist evolution.David N. Livingstone, Adam's ancestors: race, religion, and the politics of human origins, 2008John P. Jackson, Nadine M. Weidman Race, Racism, and science: social impact and interaction, Rutgers University Press, 2005 The Bible To make polygenism compatible with the Biblical account in the early chapters of the Book of Genesis, some argument is needed to the effect that what is in the Bible is incomplete. Three standard positions are: *Pre-Adamism; *Co- Adamism;For pre-Adamism and co-Adamism, see Livingstone, David, The Preadamite Theory and the Marriage of Science and Religion, Transactions of the American Philosophical Society, New Series, Vol. 82, No. 3, 1992, p. 63. *incompleteness of the Table of Nations in Genesis 10. In Christian terms, polygenesis remained an uncommon Biblical interpretation until the mid-19th century, and was largely considered heretical; however, it has been pointed out by some modern scholars that, while Pre-Adamism was strongly rejected by most and deemed heretical, Co-Adamism was not received with the same degree of hostility.Livingstone, p. 10. A major reason for the emergence of Biblical polygenism from around the 18th century was because it became noted that the number of races could not have developed within the commonly-accepted Biblical timeframe. Francis Dobbs (1750‚Äì1811), an eccentric member of the Irish Parliament, believed in a different kind of biblical polygenism. In his Concise View from History written in 1800 he maintained that there was a race resulting from a clandestine affair between Eve and the Devil (see Serpent Seed). Polygenism was heavily criticized in the early 20th century Roman Catholic Church, and especially by Pope Pius XII in the encyclical Humani generis (1950), on the grounds that polygenism is incompatible with the doctrine of Original Sin. =Pre-Adamism= Pre-Adamism claims there were already races of humans living before the creation of Adam. It traces back to Isaac La Peyr√®re in the 17th century. =Co-Adamism= Co-Adamism claims that there was more than one Adam ‚Äì small groups of men, created at the same time in different places across the Earth ‚Äì and therefore that the different races were separately created. The idea of co-Adamism has been traced back as far as Paracelsus in 1520.Graves, Joseph, The Emperor's New Clothes: Biological Theories of Race at the Millennium, Rutgers University Press, 2003, p. 25. Other 16th century advocates of co-Adamism included Thomas Harriot and Walter Raleigh, who theorised a different origin for the Native Americans.Livingstone, p. 22. In 1591 Giordano Bruno argued that because no one could imagine that the Jews and the Ethiopians had the same ancestry, then God must have either created separate Adams or Africans were the descendants of pre-Adamite races.Joseph L Graves, The Emperor's New Clothes: Biological Theories of Race at the Millennium, 2003, p. 25 An anonymous Biblical paper supporting co-Adamism was published in 1732 entitled Co-adamitae or an Essay to Prove the Two Following. Paradoxes, viz. I. That There Were Other Men Created at the Same time with Adam, and II. That the Angels did not fall.Livingstone, p. 10 Henry Home, Lord Kames was a believer in co- Adamism.Livingstone, p. 14 Home believed God had created different races on Earth in separate regions. In his book Sketches on the History of Man in 1734 Home claimed that the environment, climate, or state of society could not account for racial differences, so that the races must have come from distinct, separate stocks.John P. Jackson, Nadine M. Weidman Race, Racism, and science: social impact and interaction, Rutgers University Press, 2005, pp. 39 - 41 Charles White was another advocate of co-Adamism, although he used less theology to support his views.Livingstone, p. 15. White's Account of the Regular Gradation in Man in 1799, provided the empirical science for polygenism. White defended the theory of polygeny by refuting French naturalist Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon's interfertility argument the theory that only the same species can interbreed ‚Äì pointing to species hybrids such as foxes, wolves and jackals, which were separate groups that were still able to interbreed. Charles Hamilton Smith, a naturalist from England, was a polygenist: he believed races had been created separately. He published the book The Natural History of the Human Species in 1848. In the book he maintained that there had always been three fundamentally distinct human types: the Caucasian, the Mongolian and the Negro. He also referred to the polygenist Samuel George Morton's work in America.Gustav Jahoda, Crossroads Between Culture and Mind: Continuities and Change in Theories of Human Nature, 1993, p. 93 Samuel Kneeland wrote an 84-page introduction to the American edition of the book where he laid out evidence which supports polygenist creationism and that the Bible is entirely compatible with multiple Adams.David N. Livingstone, Adam's ancestors: race, religion, and the politics of human origins, 2008, pp. 97-99 John William Colenso, a theologian and biblical scholar, was a polygenist who believed in co-Adamism. Colenso pointed to monuments and artifacts in Egypt to debunk monogenist beliefs that all races came from the same stock. For example, Ancient Egyptian representations of races showed exactly how the races looked in his time. Egyptological evidence indicated the existence of remarkable permanent differences in the shape of the skull, bodily form, colour and physiognomy between different races which are difficult to reconcile with biblical monogenesis. Colenso believed that racial variation between races was so great, that there was no way in which all the races could have come from the same stock just a few thousand years ago. He was unconvinced that climate could change racial variation and also believed, in common with other biblical polygenists, that monogenists had interpreted the Bible wrongly.Colin Kidd, The forging of races: race and scripture in the Protestant Atlantic world, 1600 - 2000, 2006, pp. 153-156 Colenso said: \\"It seems most probable that the human race, as it now exists, had really sprung from more than one pair\\". Colenso denied that polygenism caused any kind of racist attitudes or practices; like many other polygenists he claimed monogenesis was the cause of slavery and racism. Colenso claimed that each race had sprung from a different pair of parents, and that all races were created equal by God. =Criticism of the Table of Nations= Biblical polygenists such as Colenso, Louis Agassiz, Josiah Clark Nott and George Gliddon maintained that many of the races on Earth, such as Africans and Asians, were not featured in the Table of Nations in Genesis 10. They argued that its authors' knowledge was limited to their own region. Nott in his books claimed this, and that the Bible does not concern the whole of the Earth's population. According to Nott, there are no verses in the Bible which support monogenism; and that the only passage the monogenists use is Acts 17:26, where (he wrote) the monogenists are wrong in their interpretation of this verse because the \\"one blood\\" of Paul's sermon only includes the nations he knew existed, which were local.Scott Mandelbrote, Nature and Scripture in the Abrahamic Religions: 1700-Present, Volume 2, 2010. pp. 151 - 154 Atheist polygenism According to Lansdown (2006), \\"Polygenism, the concept of different human species, was heretical and 'atheistic'; it was embraced only by the most isolated and heterodox thinkers\\".Richard Lansdown, Strangers in the South Seas, 2006, p. 193 Atheist polygenism was most notably supported by Ephraim Squier (1821‚Äì1888).Curtis M. Hinsley, Savages and scientists, 1981, p. 28 In Europe in the 19th century the general public had favored polygenism, as many believed it contradicted the Genesis account and thus was more scientific than religious monogenism.William B. Cohen, James D. Le Sueur, The French encounter with Africans: white response to Blacks, 1530-1880 1980, p. 233 The British atheist leader Charles Bradlaugh was also interested in the theory of polygenesis. He found it useful to undermine Genesis accounts of creation, but this did not mean he advocated racist policies.Nathan G. Alexander, \\"Atheism and Polygenesis in the Nineteenth Century: Charles Bradlaugh's Racial Anthropology.\\" Modern Intellectual History. (2018) Scientific polygenism During the late 17th century and early 18th century many countries first began to encounter different races from other countries due to colonial expansion, discovery, overseas exploration and increases in trade routes. Because of the encounters with different races, many people could not believe that they had the same ancestry of other races, because of the extreme racial differences. Many explorers and scientists visited other countries to observe and study different races and write down their findings. Later they went back to their own countries to publish books and journals on their findings and claim that the evidence supported polygenism.John P. Jackson, Nadine M. Weidman Race, Racism, and science: social impact and interaction, Rutgers University Press, 2005, See sections on polygenismThe French encounter with Africans: white response to Blacks, 1530-1880 By William B. Cohen, James D. Le Sueur, 2003, See sections on polygenism =18th century= Polygenists of the 18th century included Voltaire and David Hume. Voltaire in his 1734 book Trait√© de m√©taphysique wrote that \\"Whites ... Negroes ... the z races are not descended from the same man\\". Voltaire brought the subject up in his Essay on the Manner and Spirit of Nations and on the Principal Occurrences in History in 1756 (which was an early work of comparative history). He believed each race had separate origins because they were so racially diverse. Voltaire found biblical monogenism laughable, as he expressed: > It is a serious question among them whether the Africans are descended from > monkeys or whether the monkeys come from them. Our wise men have said that > man was created in the image of God. Now here is a lovely image of the > Divine Maker: a flat and black nose with little or hardly any intelligence. > A time will doubtless come when these animals will know how to cultivate the > land well, beautify their houses and gardens, and know the paths of the > stars: one needs time for everything.Voltaire Les Lettres d'Amabed (1769), > Septi√®me Lettre d'Amabed When comparing Caucasians to those with dark skin, Voltaire claimed they were different species: > The negro race is a species of men different from ours as the breed of > spaniels is from that of greyhounds. The mucous membrane, or network, which > nature has spread between the muscles and the skin, is white in us and black > or copper-colored in them.Voltaire The Works of Voltaire, Vol. XIX > (Philosophical Letters) (1733) John Atkins, an English naval surgeon, was one of the earliest scientists to be a proponent of the polygenist theory. In his book A Voyage to Guinea (1723) he said \\"I am persuaded that the black and white race have sprung from different coloured parents.\\" In the last two decades of the 18th century polygenism was advocated in England by historian Edward Long and anatomist Charles White, in Germany by ethnographers Christoph Meiners and Georg Forster, and in France by Julien-Joseph Virey.George W. Stocking Race, culture, and evolution: essays in the history of anthropology : with a new preface, 1968, p. 39 =19th-century views= Polygenism was most widespread during the 19th century.George W. Stocking, Race, Culture and Evolution: Essays in the History of Anthropology, 1968, pp. 38-40 The racial studies of Georges Cuvier, the French naturalist and zoologist, influenced scientific polygenism and scientific racism. These theories proposed a graduation from ‚Äòcivilisation‚Äô to ‚Äòbarbarism‚Äô, at once justifying the European acquisition of foreign territories and highlighting the belief in the singular role of the Europeans as a civilizing force. Georges Cuvier Georges Cuvier, a French naturalist and zoologist, believed there were three distinct races: the Caucasian (\\"white\\"), the Mongolian (\\"yellow\\") and the Ethiopian (\\"black\\"). Cuvier claimed Adam and Eve were Caucasian, forming the original race of mankind, while the other two races originated by survivors escaping in different directions after a major catastrophe hit the Earth 5,000 years ago, with those survivors then living in complete isolation from each other.John P. Jackson, Nadine M. Weidman, Race, racism, and science: social impact and interaction, Rutgers University Press, 2005, pp. 41-42Colin Kidd, The forging of races: race and scripture in the Protestant Atlantic world, 1600 - 2000, 2006, p. 28 Each race received marks for the beauty or ugliness of their skull and quality of their civilizations. According to Cuvier the white race was at the top and the black race was at the bottom.Benjamin H. Isaac, The invention of racism in classical antiquity, 2006, p. 105 Cuvier wrote regarding Caucasians: > The white race, with oval face, straight hair and nose, to which the > civilised people of Europe belong and which appear to us the most beautiful > of all, is also superior to others by its genius, courage and > activity.Georges Cuvier, Tableau elementaire de l'histoire naturelle des > animaux (Paris, 1798) p.71 Regarding those he termed \\"Ethiopian,\\" Cuvier wrote: > The Negro race ... is marked by black complexion, crisped of woolly hair, > compressed cranium and a flat nose, The projection of the lower parts of the > face, and the thick lips, evidently approximate it to the monkey tribe: the > hordes of which it consists have always remained in the most complete state > of barbarism. Cuvier's racial studies held the main features of polygenism, which are as follows:John P. Jackson, Nadine M. Weidman, Race, racism, and science: social impact and interaction, Rutgers University Press, 2005, p. 42 *Fixity of species *Strict limits on environmental influence *Unchanging underlying type *Anatomical and cranial measurement differences in races *Physical and mental differences between racial worth *Human races are all distinct Prichard Scientific polygenism became popular in France in the 1820s in response to James Cowles Prichard's Researches into the Physical History of Man (1813) which was considered a pioneering work of monogenism.Augstein, Hannah, James Cowles Prichard's anthropology: remaking the science of man in early nineteenth-century Britain, Rodopi, 1999, p. 58. An anthropological school advocating polygenism arose to counter Prichard's monogenism in France.Augstein, p. 59. Key French polygenists of this period included the naturalist Jean Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent and Louis-Antoine Desmoulins (1796‚Äì1828), a student of Georges Cuvier.Augstein, p. 60. Retzius Anders Retzius, a Swedish professor of anatomy, was a polygenist. Retzius studied many different skull types, and because the skulls were so different he believed that the races had a separate origin.Peter Rowley-Conwy, From Genesis to Prehistory: The Archaeological Three Age System and its Contested Reception in Denmark, Britain, and Ireland, 2007, p. 120 Later European trends Polygenist schools arose in the 1830s and 1840s across Europe. The Scottish anatomist and zoologist Robert Knox was considered to have influenced polygenism in Britain; he argued in his The Races of Men (1850) that \\"[r]acial natures ... were unchanging over thousands of years, and were so different that they should be called different species\\". A colleague of Knox, James Hunt, was also an early author who promoted polygenism in Britain, though he was more concerned with establishing white superiority. Hunt dedicated his On the Negro's Place in Nature (1863) to Knox who had died a year before its publication.Claeys, Gregory, Encyclopedia of nineteenth-century thought, Taylor & Francis, 2005, p. 21. John Crawfurd, a Scottish physician and colonial administrator, was a polygenist. He studied the geography of where different races were located, and believed that different races had been created separately by God in specific regional zones for climatic circumstance.David N. Livingstone, Adam's ancestors: race, religion, and the politics of human origins, 2008, p. 112 American views Charles Caldwell was one of the earliest supporters of polygenism in America. Caldwell attacked the position that environment was the cause of racial differences and argued instead that four races, Caucasian, Mongolian, American Indian, and African, were four different species, created separately by God.John P. Jackson, Nadine M. Weidman, Race, Racism, and science: social impact and interaction, Rutgers University Press, 2005, p. 45 Charles Pickering (naturalist) was a librarian and curator of the Academy of Natural Sciences. In 1843, he traveled to Africa and India to research human races. In 1848, Pickering published Races of Man and Their Geographical Distribution, which enumerated eleven races. Indigenous Races of the Earth (1857). Josiah Clark Nott and George Robins Gliddon implied that \\"Negroes\\" were a creational rank between \\"Greeks\\" and chimpanzees. Polygenism came into mainstream scientific thought in America in the mid 19th century with the work of several corresponding natural scientists such as Samuel George Morton and Charles Pickering as well as Egyptologist George Gliddon, the surgeon Josiah Clark Nott and more prominently the paleontologist and geologist Louis Agassiz in the United States. All had contributed to a major ethnological work of 738 pages entitled Types of Mankind which was published in 1854 and was a great success; it was followed by a sequel Indigenous Races of the Earth (1857). These works sparked the first formal Polygenist vs. Monogenist debates across America, and advocates of the polygenism school became known as pluralists. Since Louis Agassiz backed the pluralists, polygenism received mainstream public approval and wide exposure during the 1840s-1860s. Numerous articles promoting polygenist views were published in the American Journal of Science and Arts during this time period.Lurie, Edward, Louis Agassiz and the Races of Man, Isis, Vol. 45, No. 3, Sep., 1954, p. 232 The archeologist Ephraim George Squier helped Morton's polygenism by excavating an ancient cranium from the midwestern mounds and sending a drawing of it to Morton. Morton found its similarities striking to Central and South American crania, confirming his belief that the American Indian nations had a common and indigenous origin. Morton's polygenism explicitly stated the Mound Builders were an American Indian race of great antiquity, they did not migrate from Asia, and their physical form has remained essentially unchanged in their descendants.John P. Jackson, Nadine M. Weidman Race, Racism, and science: social impact and interaction, Rutgers University Press, 2005, pp. 49-50 Both Squier and Gliddon demonstrated for Morton the permanence of racial characteristics, and the suitability of each race to the region for which it had been created. American Indians supported Morton's conclusions, whilst some white archaeologists supported Morton. Others such as William Pidgeon did not accept Morton's conclusions because at the time some white archaeologists such as Pidgeon could not believe that Native Americans had created the archaeological remains they saw around them; instead William Pidgeon wrote a book called Traditions of Dee-Coo-Dah and Antiquarian Researches in 1858.Pidgeon, William (1858) Traditions of Dee-Coo-Dah and Antiquarian Researches. Horace Thayer, New York In the book Pidgeon attempts to prove that a vanished race, culturally superior to and existing earlier than the American Indians, occupied America first and that The Mound Builders were not Native Americans. Pidgeon's book was revealed mostly to be a hoax. The famed archaeologist Theodore H. Lewis later revealed that Pidgeon had fabricated most of his research and distorted much of the rest of it, mapping mounds where none existed and changing the arrangement of existing mound groups to suit his needs.Lewis, Theodore H. (1886) \\"The 'Monumental Tortoise' Mounds of 'Dee-Coo-Dah'\\" The American Journal of Archaeology 2(1):65-69. Morton's work gained more support because his work was considered to be evidence of true objective science unlike others such as Pidgeon. Morton won his reputation as the great data-gatherer and objectivist of American Science. Oliver Wendell Holmes praised Morton for \\"the severe and cautious character\\" of his works, which \\"from their very nature are permanent data for all future students of ethnology\\".Sandra G. Harding The \\"Racial\\" economy of science: toward a democratic future p. 100 By 1850 Agassiz had developed a unique form of co-Adamism. God he believed had created several different zoological provinces with different races in them, but also fauna and animals specific to those regions. An essay of Agassiz promoting this theory with maps of the zoological zones was attached as a preface to Types of Mankind in collaboration with Morton, Gliddon, Nott and others.Agassiz, Sketch of the natural provinces of the animal world and their relation to the different types of man, Types of Mankind, Philadelphia, 1854, p. lxxvi. Agassiz's theory developed some support amongst Christians, and he often wrote articles in Christian magazines claiming his views on polygenism were compatible with the bible.The Diversity of Origin of Human Races, Cristian Examiner, 49, 110-145, 1850. Christian fundamentalists however who held to Young Earth Creationism and strict monogenism (i.e. everyone on Earth from Adam and Eve) attacked his views, as well as those of Gliddon and Nott.Lurie, p. 236. Unlike Josiah Nott, the slave-owner from Alabama, Agassiz was never a supporter of slavery. He claimed his views had nothing to do with politics.John P. Jackson, Nadine M. Weidman Race, Racism, and science: social impact and interaction, Rutgers University Press, 2005, p. 51 Effect of evolutionary ideas and debates from the 1860s The notion that races were separate and came together by hybridism, rather than being variations from a common stock, was cast into doubt with the publication of Darwin's Origin of Species in 1859, which Agassiz opposed till his death. Yet the influence of polygenism persisted for many years. For example, the Hamitic Hypothesis, which argued that certain African populations were the descendants of a proto- white invasion in the ancient past, was influenced by polygenism and continued to hold sway in linguistics and anthropology until the 1950s.Michael F. Robinson, The Lost White Tribe: Explorers, Scientists, and the Theory that Changed a Continent (New York: Oxford University Press, 2016), 85-94. Darwin did not address man's origin directly at this stage, and the argument continued for a number of years, with the creation of the Anthropological Society of London in 1863 in the shadow of the American civil war, in opposition to the abolitionist Ethnological Society. The Anthropologicals had the Confederate agent Henry Hotze permanently on their council. The two societies did not heal their differences until they merged in 1871 to form the Anthropological Institute. Georges Pouchet, the French naturalist and anatomist, was a polygenist. Pouchet made contributions in several scientific fields, and specialised in comparative anatomy of fishes and whales. He was a prime advocate of polygeny, and was the author of an anthropological work titled De la Pluralit√© des Races Humaines (1858), which was translated into English as The Plurality of the Human Race in 1864 by the Anthropological Society. John Thurnam with Joseph Barnard Davis published a work in two volumes under the title of Crania Britannica in 1865, important for craniometry. Thurnam and Davis were both believers in polygenism, in the form that different races had been created separately. Davis was a collector of crania, and had over 1700 specimens.Bronwen Douglas, Chris Ballard, Foreign bodies: Oceania and the science of race 1750-1940, 2008, pp. 219-223 Because of the racial differences of the crania, Davis and Thurnam believed that proofs of polygenism were to be found in studying the skull types of different races. Davis also wrote Thesaurus craniorum: catalogue of the skulls of the various races of man (1875). Although it took many years, polygenism, which required species to be created in specific geographic locations and to remain immutable, has been almost entirely replaced among scientists by Darwin's theory of evolution from a common ancestor. Persistent antagonism to Darwinian theory is today primarily a matter of religious or political viewpoint.see Darwin's Sacred Cause (2009), A Desmond and J Moore, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt; and other works by these authors as a team or individually.  Polygenist evolution Polygenist evolution is the belief that humans evolved independently from separate species of apes. This can be traced back to Carl Vogt in 1864. Polygenist evolution allowed polygenists to link each race to an altogether different ape. This was shown in the work of Hermann Klaatsch and F. G. Crookshank.Eviatar Zerubavel, Time Maps: Collective Memory and the Social Shape of the Past, 2004, pp. 70-71 Carl Vogt believed that the inhabitants of Africa were related to the ape, and was separate from those of European descent. In Chapter VII of his Lectures of man (1864) he compared both ethnicities, describing them as \\"two extreme human types\\". The difference between them, he claimed, are greater than those between two species of ape; and this proves the two are a separate species altogether.Gustav Jahoda, Images of savages: ancient roots of modern prejudice in Western culture, 1999, p. 83 In an unusual blend of contemporary evolutionary thinking and pre- Adamism, the theistic evolutionist and geologist Alexander Winchell argued in his 1878 book Adamites and Preadamites for the pre-Adamic origins of the human race on the basis that Africans were too racially inferior to have developed from the Biblical Adam. Winchell also believed that the laws of evolution operated according to the will of God.Christian Smith, The secular revolution: power, interests, and conflict in the secularization, 2003, p. 50 Before Darwin published his theory of evolution and common descent in his Origin of Species (1859), scientific theories or models of Polygenism (such as Agassiz's) were strictly creationist. Even after Darwin's book was published, Agassiz still stuck to his scientific form of polygenist creationism and denounced the idea of evolution. However, by the late 19th century most scientific polygenists had abandoned Agassiz's creationism and began to embrace polygenist forms of evolution. This even included many students of Agassiz, including Nathaniel Shaler, who had studied under Agassiz at Harvard.Cohen, Nancy, The reconstruction of American liberalism, 1865-1914, UNC Press Books, 2002, p. 77 Shaler continued to believe in polygenism, but believed the different races evolved from different primates. The prominent French anthropologist Paul Broca by 1878 had also converted from creationist polygenism to accepting a form of polygenist evolution.Langham, Ian, The Wider domain of evolutionary thought By Ian Langham, Springer, 1983, p. 304. In his work The Descent of Man (1871), Charles Darwin and some of his supporters argued for the monogenesis of the human species, seeing the common origin of all humans as essential for evolutionary theory. This is known as the single- origin hypothesis. Darwin even dedicated a chapter of his The Descent of Man to an attempt to refute the polygenists and support common ancestry of all races. Polygenist evolution views however continued into the early 20th century, and still found support amongst prominent scientists. Henry Fairfield Osborn for example in his The Origin and Evolution of Life (1916) claimed blacks and whites both evolved from different primates.Eviatar, Zerubavel, Time Maps: Collective Memory and the Social Shape of the Past, University of Chicago Press, 2004, p. 70. Alfred Russel Wallace was also an advocate of polygenist evolution, claiming that the physical differences in races must have occurred at such a remote time in the past before humans had any intelligence, when natural selection was still operative on human bodies. The differentiation into separate races with distinct physical traits must have happened so soon after humans had just appeared on Earth that for all practical purposes all races had always been distinct.Jackson, John, Race, racism, and science: social impact and interaction, Rutgers University Press, 2005, p. 68 In contrast to most of Darwin's supporters, Ernst Haeckel put forward a doctrine of evolutionary polygenism based on the ideas of the linguist and polygenist August Schleicher, in which several different language groups had arisen separately from speechless prehuman Urmenschen, which themselves had evolved from simian ancestors. These separate languages had completed the transition from animals to man, and, under the influence of each main branch of languages, humans had evolved as separate species, which could be subdivided into races. Haeckel divided human beings into ten races, of which the Caucasian was the highest and the primitives were doomed to extinction.John P. Jackson, Nadine M. Weidman Race, Racism, and science: social impact and interaction, Rutgers University Press, 2005, p. 87 Haeckel claimed that Africans have stronger and more freely movable toes than any other race, which he interpreted as evidence that members of the race were closely related to apes. Reasoning that apes use their toes to cling tightly to tree branches, Haeckel compared Africans to \\"four-handed\\" apes. Haeckel also believed that Blacks were savages and that Whites were significantly more civilized.

J. Poncet, who passed through Sennar in 1699, left this description of his interview with King Badi: :When we had almost past over the court, they oblig'd us to stop short before a stone, which is near to an open hall, where the King usually gives audience to embassadors. There we saluted the king according to the custom of the country, falling upon our knees and thrice kissing the ground. That prince is nineteen years of age, black, but well shap'd and of a majestick presence; not having thick lips nor flat nose, like the rest of his subjects. He was seated upon a rich bed under a canopy, with his legs across, after the oriental fashion; and round him twenty old men, seated after the same manner, but somewhat lower. He was cloath'd with a long vest of silk, embroider'd with gold, and girt with a kind of scarf made of fine calico. He had a white turban on his head. The old men were clad much after the same manner.An anonymous English translation from 1709, reprinted with notes by William Foster, The Red Sea and Adjacent Countries at the Close of the Seventeenth Century (London: Hakluyt Society, 1949), p. 103. Poncet's departure from Sennar was delayed at the border for 19 days until 11 June 1699, due to the death of King Badi's mother. A Jesuit residing at Port Said, Jean Verzaeu, wrote on 20 October 1700 that the kingdom and Ethiopia were at war over the assassination of a Sennar national in Ethiopia, and that the trade route between the two countries was closed.Richard Pankhurst, An Introduction to the Economic History of Ethiopia (London: Lalibela House, 1961), p. 320. Because of the success of Poncet's visit to Ethiopia, Charles de Maillet, the French consul at Cairo, ordered Lenoir de Roule to visit the Ethiopian Emperor on behalf of Louis XIV. Due to the hostility of the natives of the lands he travelled through, de Roule was unable to get any further than Sennar, where he was murdered with his five companions before the royal palace on November 10, 1705. Although King Badi was seen by many as being responsible for this act, the Scots traveller James Bruce, who travelled through Sennar later in the eighteenth century, accused the Franciscans of having manipulated the events that led to these deaths.E.

They were responsible for setting fire to English-owned holiday homes in Wales from 1979 to the mid-1990s.  History  The group first came to prominence in 1979.

Biography Phillips was born in Omaha, Nebraska. He studied at the Denver College of Music with Edwin Stringham and at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York, with Howard Hanson and Bernard Rogers. On September 17, 1928, he married Alberta Phillips (who wrote many of his librettos; died 1979). The couple had a daughter, Ann (b. 1931; actress Ann E. Todd, later Ann Basart) and a son, Stephen (1937‚Äì1986), who predeceased his father. Due to privations caused by the Great Depression, the children, Ann and Stephen, were raised by their maternal grandparents. Phillips's first important work was Selections from McGuffey's Reader, for orchestra, based on poems by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. . He wrote of this work in his 1933 diary, \\"I don't think anybody had written such 'American-sounding' music before. On the first night, the students said it was corny. And it was. But I didn't care, because it was a huge success.\\" In his 1943 diaries, he looked back at his \\"Courthouse Square\\" (1935) and is struck by \\"the poor scoring and the clich√©s and triviality of the material. There is almost self-conscious simplicity, not to say idiocy, about it. Too sweet, although the vitality of rhythm is there. But it wasn't a bad way to begin a career.\\" By the 1940s he had turned to a more astringent and expressive idiom . In 1942, he wrote in his diary, \\"I have decided that my slow movements from now on are going to be different; they are going to play for keeps and not just be soft, sensuous, tender, delicious, delicate, dramatic, or dark. No more warm middle-western summer-night scenes, but the cool, stormy, volcanic, passionate stretches of the soul.\\" He commented in his 1944 diary, \\"I want something with more bite to it, with an ache and some force. I want the structure of this work to be evident. I want to use some of the elements of the mind in working it out, such as fugue, passacaglia, etc. I want to write with humor or wit in some parts‚Äîanother function of mind. The underlying emotional warmth, however, must always be there.\\" In 1960 his String Quartet Number Two was premiered at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. by the Paganini Quartet, with the composer present, and broadcast on live FM radio. In the early 1960s he turned to free serial techniques, less sharply accented rhythms, and increasing fantasy . In his 1987 diaries, he wrote, \\"Yesterday, I read about [Elliott] Carter's Double Concerto for piano and harpsichord. I find I am developing a type of chordal structure similar to his, but I never knew anything about this phase of his before reading about it. I certainly don't feel attracted to his rhythmic style, but the widespread open distribution of intervals in the chords & the cluster forms & inversions are very much what I have been doing. I hadn't, until lately, done anything to arrive at a new chordal style because of my predominant drive for linear motion, thematic or contrapuntal.\\" He wrote, in 1983, of his musical influences: \\"The first music of a serious nature I was introduced to as a child was the 2- and 3-part inventions of Bach. Then Haydn and Chopin. All of these are simple and clear, and their harmonic content is not obscured by an elaborate overlay of either contrapuntal virtuosity or chromatic sugaring. After college I emerged with a fairly self-recognized set of preferences: Scarlatti, Soler, Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Berlioz, Debussy, Stravinsky‚Äîall those whose attitude toward the sonic portion of music is one of making things clear and strong-flavored.\\" Phillips taught composition and theory at Eastman (1933‚Äì49), the University of Illinois (1949‚Äì64), the Juilliard School of Music (1968‚Äì69), and Cornell University (1972‚Äì73). His students include Jack Beeson, William Flanagan, Kenneth Gaburo, Ben Johnston, H. Owen Reed, Daria Semegen, Steven Stucky, David Ward-Steinman, and Charles Whittenberg , as well as Jerry Amaldev. He was a Fulbright Lecturer in Barcelona, Spain, in 1960‚Äì61, and received Guggenheim fellowships in 1942‚Äì43 and 1961‚Äì62 , when the entire Phillips family reunited in Paris. Death He died in Berkeley, California on June 22, 1988, aged 80, of complications after a heart attack (; ).

It is one of the oldest musical instruments in China and has been in use for approximately seven thousand years. The xun was initially made of baked clay or bone, and later of clay or ceramic; sometimes that instrument made with bamboo. It is the only surviving example of an earth (also called \\"clay\\") instrument from the traditional \\"eight-tone\\" (bayin) classifications of musical instruments (based on whether the instrument is made from metal, stone, silk, bamboo, gourd, earth, hide, or wood). Components The xun is an egg-shaped aerophone, containing at least three finger holes in front and two thumb holes in back. It has a blowing hole on top and can have up to ten smaller finger holes, one for each finger. It is similar to an ocarina but does not contain a fipple mouthpiece, unlike other Chinese flute-like instruments, such as the Wudu and Taodi. The xun can come in a variety of sizes. The entry for the Xun in the oldest surviving Chinese encyclopedia, Erya (Refined Definitions, c. 3rd century BC), describes it as being of two types: # large, shaped like a goose egg, with flattened bottom and six holes (lower pitch); # small, shaped like a chicken egg (higher pitch). History and development The origin of this unique wind instrument dates back to the Stone Age and has much to do with early Chinese hunting practices. During ancient times, people often tied a stone or mud ball to the rope that was used for hunting wild animals. Some of the balls were hollow, which allowed it make many sounds when thrown. Most people found it enjoyable and learned how to blow air into it. Gradually, the \\"stone meteor\\" became the musical instrument we know as \\"xun\\". Archaeologists have discovered vessel-flutes like the xun in common graves of the Xia dynasty. Those had three finger holes and could produce the notes do, mi, so, la and fa. The shape of the instrument and number of finger holes of the xun as we know it today were standardized during the Shang dynasty. Most xun of that era had five finger holes and produced sound of much better quality. They were able to produce all the tones and half-tones in a single octave. By the Zhou dynasty, it was a common instrument and was played in the imperial courts. The design of the xun varied according to whether it was played for enjoyment or for celebrations. Cultural significance A modern ceramic xun decorated with an engraving of a dragon. The use of xun in the Chinese history was found mainly in the performance of palace music. However, the sound of xun is also associated as the symbol of respectable hermits, lady in sorrow, or heroes at the end of their strength, and is considered the best instrument to perform a heartbreaking tone, or to make solemn music within the royal court. The sound of xun represents a particular beauty, which combines with loneliness, desolate and elegance. It is the embodiment of the unique Chinese aesthetic conceptions. In a traditional Chinese orchestra, xun plays the important part of alto voice. Its soft, heavy voice makes high-pitch and low- pitch in a harmonious proportion. In this sense, xun represents also the idea of harmony, which is one of the main parts of traditional Chinese values. In literature The Erya (Â∞îÈõÖ): \\"A large xun is like a goose egg, with a flattened bottom and six holes; a small one is like a chicken egg\\" Classic of Poetry (ËØóÁªè): \\"The elder brother plays xun, the younger brother plays chi [transverse flute]\\" Similar instruments The Korean equivalent is the hun (hangul: Ìõà; hanja: Â°§). In Japan, the same type of instrument is called tsuchibue (hiragana: „Å§„Å°„Å∂„Åà ; kanji: ÂúüÁ¨õ, lit. \\"earthen flute\\"). In Assam, it is known as Xutuli.

Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), Gardner syndrome, Lynch syndrome, Muir‚ÄìTorre syndrome, celiac disease, Peutz‚ÄìJeghers syndrome, Crohn's disease and juvenile polyposis syndrome are risk factors for developing this cancer. The duodenum is the first part of the small intestine. It is located between the stomach and the jejunum. After foods combine with stomach acid, they descend into the duodenum where they mix with bile from the gallbladder and digestive fluid from the pancreas. Signs and symptoms The cancerous mass tends to block food from getting to the small intestine. If food cannot get to the intestines, it will cause pain, acid reflux, and weight loss because the food cannot get to where it is supposed to be processed and absorbed by the body. Patients with duodenal cancer may experience abdominal pain, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, and chronic gastrointestinal bleeding. Treatment Resection is sometimes a part of a treatment plan, but duodenal cancer is difficult to remove surgically because of the area that it resides in‚Äîthere are many blood vessels supplying the lower body. Chemotherapy is sometimes used to try to shrink the cancerous mass. Other times intestinal bypass surgery is tried to reroute the stomach to intestine connection around the blockage. A 'Whipple' procedure is a type of surgery that is sometimes possible with this cancer. In this procedure, the duodenum, a portion of the Pancreas (the head), and the gall bladder are usually removed, the small intestine is brought up to the Pylorus (the valve at the bottom of the stomach) and the liver and pancreatic digestive enzymes and bile are connected to the small intestine below the pylorus. The removal of part of the Pancreas often requires taking pancreatic enzyme supplements to aid digestion. These are available in the form of capsules by prescription. It is not unusual for a people having received a Whipple procedure to feel well, and to lead a normal life. Some patients need to be fitted with tubes to either add nutrients (feeding tubes) or drainage tubes to remove excess processed food that can not pass the blockage.

Chicago: Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Inc., 15th edn., 1992, Vol. 1, p. 611. It was used to contain perfume or oil, and is often depicted in vase paintings being used by athletes during bathing. In these depictions, the vessel is at times attached by a strap to the athlete's wrist, or hung by a strap from a peg on the wall. The shape of the aryballos originally came from the oinochoe of the Geometric period of the 9th century BCE, a globe-shaped wine jar. By the Proto-Corinthian period of the following century, it had attained its definitive shape, going from spherical to ovoid to conical, and finally back to spherical. This definitive form has a wide, flat mouth, and a single small handle. Some later variations have bell-shaped mouths, a second handle, and/or a flat base. Potters also created inventive shapes for aryballoi.

Biography  Lebedev was born in 1874 in Lublin and went to school in Warsaw. In 1900, he graduated from St. Petersburg University and found work at the Petersburg Margarine Factory. Starting in 1902, Lebedev moved from university to university in Russia, starting at the Saint-Petersburg Institute for Railroad Engineering. In 1904, he returned to St. Petersburg University to work under Alexey Favorsky (Stalin Prize, 1941, for contributions to the manufacture of synthetic rubber). In 1905, he married his second wife, the artist Anna Ostroumova-Lebedeva. In 1915, Lebedev was appointed Professor at the Women's Pedagogical Institute in St. Petersburg. After 1916, he was a Professor of the Saint Petersburg Academy for Military Medicine. In 1925, he became the leader of the Oil Laboratory (after 1928, the Laboratory of Synthetic Resins) at St. Petersburg University. He died in Leningrad and is interred in Tikhvin Cemetery.  Works  Lebedev in his lab Lebedev's main works are devoted to polymerisation of diene hydrocarbons. He was the first to research the polymerisation of butadiene (1910‚Äì1913). In 1910, Lebedev was the first to get synthetic rubber based on poly-butadiene. His book Research in polymerisation of by-ethylene hydrocarbons (1913) became the bible for studies of synthetic rubber. After 1914, he studied polymerisation of ethylene monomers, leading to modern industrial methods for manufacturing of butyl synthetic rubber and poly-isobutylene. Between 1926 and 1928, he developed a single-stage method for manufacturing butadiene out of ethanol. In 1928, he developed an industrial method for producing synthetic rubber based on polymerisation of butadiene using metallic sodium as a catalyst. This method became the base for the Soviet industry of synthetic rubber. The Soviets lacked reliable access to natural rubber, making the manufacture of synthetic rubber important. The first three synthetic rubber plants were launched in 1932‚Äì33. For butadiene production they used grain or potato ethanol as a feedstock. It caused a number of jokes about \\"Russian method of making tires from potatoes\\". By 1940, the Soviet Union had the largest synthetic rubber industry in the world, producing more than 50,000 tons per year. During World War II, Lebedev's process of obtaining butadiene from ethyl alcohol was also used by the German rubber industry.The rise of synthetic rubber. Encyclopaedia Britannica Another important contribution of Lebedev's was the study of the kinetics of hydrogenation of ethylene hydrocarbons and the development of a number of synthetic motor oils for aircraft engines.  Honors  * In 1931, Lebedev was awarded the Order of Lenin for his work on synthetic rubber * In 1932, he became a full member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. * In 1945 the National Institute for Synthetic Rubber was named \\"Lebedev's Institute\\".

At least 300 people, including the chief baron and sheriff, are thought to have died as a result of this event. It received its name because it was believed to have been associated with a trial at the Assize Court at Oxford Castle. Casualties Reports vary as to the total number of deaths that occurred in the \\"Black Assize\\". The casualties in Oxford itself are consistently recorded as approximately 300, but some reports say that further deaths occurred outside the city. One report records: This reported lack of deaths among women and children led to speculation about the causes of the casualties. Possible causes On the wall inside the Main Hall of the Old County Hall of Oxfordshire in New Road, an inscription reads: Plaque on a wall inside County Hall From the time of the Black Death in the mid-14th century until the second half of the 19th century, Oxford was regularly visited by plague, cholera, smallpox and typhoid fevers. In 1348, the Black Death reduced the city's population to such an extent that Gloucester College (from which Gloucester Green derives its name) was forced to close. In 1571, Oxford University had to postpone the start of term because of an outbreak of plague, and the 'gaol fever' six years later may have been part of the same epidemic, being considered more worthy of note because its victims included the Lord Chief Baron and the Lord High Sheriff. This account of disease is reflected in a number of sources. An early Chronicle records: A 19th-century account is more sure of the cause: Other accounts reject the notion of disease as a cause: Further accounts merely attribute the deaths to a curse supposedly uttered by Rowland Jenkes. Popular culture The Black Assizes has featured as a display at Oxford Castle and is a regular feature of Oxford ghost tours, where the story of Rowland Jenkes' curse is given prominence. The events of this time are part of the backdrop to the historical crime novel Heresy by S. J. Parris in which Rowland Jenkes appears as a character.

Early history In 1938 Irvin Athearn built a detailed O scale model railroad layout in his mother's house, which gained an overwhelming response when he placed an advertisement to sell it. Deciding to make his career selling model railroad supplies, he became a full-time retailer in 1946. Athearn opened a separate facility in Hawthorne, California in 1948, and that same year he branched into HO scale models for the first time. Athearn acquired the Globe Models product line and improved upon it, introducing a comprehensive array of locomotive, passenger, and freight car models. Improvements included all-wheel drive and electrical contact. One innovation was the \\"Hi-Fi\\" Interview with Irv Athearn drive mechanism, employing small rubber bands to transfer motion from the motor spindle to the axles. Another was the double-ended ring magnet motor, which permitted easy connection to all-wheel-drive assemblies. Athearn was also able to incorporate flywheels into double-ended drives. The company produced a model of the Boston & Maine P4 class Pacific steam locomotive which incorporated a cast zinc alloy base and thermoplastic resin superstructure. It had a worm drive and all power pickup was through the bipolar trucks that carried the tender. This item was discontinued after the Wilson motor was no longer available, and was not redesigned for a more technologically advanced motor. Postwar expansion Starting in the mid 1950s, Athearn produced shortened versions of streamlined and heavyweight passenger cars based on Southern Pacific and Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe prototypes. The company also offered a variety of freight cars with sprung and equalized trucks. The cars could be obtained in simple kit form, or ready-to-run. A model of the Budd Rail Diesel Car was introduced in 1953 with a metal body, and reintroduced in 1958 in plastic. The comprehensive scope of the product line contributed to the popularity of HO as a model railroad scale, due to the ready availability of items and their low cost. When Lionel Corporation introduced their line of HO scale trains in 1958, many of the trains were produced by Athearn. Athearn also produced trains for the short-lived Cox Models brand of electric train sets in the 1970s. Many of these products were pre-existing items from the Athearn catalog repackaged with Cox branding. Freight cars packaged with train sets sold by Atlas Model Railroad Co. in the 1970s also came from Athearn. Irv Athearn died in 1991. New owners took control in 1994, but continued to follow Athearn's business model. Paul Lubliner's fine quality tooling for his \\"Highliners\\" brand of EMD F-units was acquired by Athearn in 1998 and integrated into their new Genesis line. In 2002, Athearn acquired Rail Power Products, as well as the tooling for modern 50' boxcars from Details West. Horizon Hobby acquisition Athearn was purchased in 2004 by Horizon Hobby, which moved the company from Compton to a new facility in Carson, California. At the same time, Horizon purchased Model Die Casting and their line of Roundhouse brand trains. A major international hobby distributor, Horizon Hobby is headquartered in Champaign, Illinois. In 2006, Horizon purchased McHenry Couplers. In 2008, Athearn acquired the tooling for the short-lived \\"Tower 55\\" series of HO scale diesels from Overland Models. Much of this tooling made its way into the Athearn Genesis line. In mid-2009, all remaining U.S. production was moved to China and warehousing moved to parent Horizon Hobby. Sales and product development was moved to a smaller facility in Long Beach, California. On October 16, 2009, Athearn announced that it would stop making so-called \\"blue-box kits\\" citing increased manufacturing and labor costs. Athearn continues to produce ready-to-run models of diesel locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars representing a variety of eras and railroads. The company sells three lines: Genesis, the highest-cost, highest-quality, with DCC sound and fine details; and two lower-priced, less-detailed lines: Ready-to-Roll, representing trains from the steam-to-diesel transition period to today; and Roundhouse, representing trains from the days of steam era railroading. Athearn has recently added the \\"Genesis 2.0 line to their lineup. Theese new models sport new LED lighting, spinning roller bearing caps, and a very large image of male sausage on the lid of all blue and gold boxes. References McMurtry L.

The young owl is unjustly kicked out of his family's house by his disciplinarian violinist father, Professor Fritz Owl (Billy Bletcher), after he is caught singing jazz instead of \\"Drink to Me Only with Thine Eyes\\" to the reed (pump) organ accompaniment of his mother (voiced by Martha Wentworth). While wandering, he comes across a radio amateur contest (clearly a takeoff of the Major Bowes Amateur Hour), hosted by \\"Jack Bunny\\" (a pun on Jack Benny and later used in Goofy Groceries, voiced by Tedd Pierce). Billing himself as \\"Owl Jolson\\" (a reference to Al Jolson) he wins the contest, but not before his father has finally seen his son's potential and allows him to freely sing jazz. His singing voice is by Johnnie Davis. Production notes * The first owlet hatched sang the opening bars of \\"Chi mi frena in tal momento\\", from the opera Lucia di Lammermoor. (Papa Fritz compared him to the great opera singer Enrico Caruso.) Translated in Italian is \\"Who is holding me back at this time?\\" * The second owlet to hatch played the beginning of \\"Tr√§umerei\\" by Robert Schumann on the violin. (Papa Fritz compared him to the violinist Fritz Kreisler.) * The third owlet, a flautist, played the first notes of \\"Spring Song\\" by Felix Mendelssohn from his work Songs Without Words. * Owl Jolson is made to sing (badly and off key, due to his loathing of classical music) \\"Drink to Me Only with Thine Eyes\\", the lyrics of which are Ben Jonson's 1616 poem \\"Song. To Celia.\\" Whenever Mama had to pause playing her piano to turn the sheet music page, Jolson managed to get in a few bars of \\"I Love to Singa\\". * The first known reject in the contest played a few bars of \\"Listen to the Mocking Bird\\" on the harmonica. * The blackbird in the blue jacket played a few bars of \\"Nola\\", composed by Felix Arndt, on the saxophone. * The bird with the accordion briefly played \\"Turkey in the Straw\\". * The dark, operatic bird sang a line from the silent film Laugh, Clown, Laugh, even though the lyrics to the theme song don't have those actual words (this version was later used in Yankee Doodle Daffy when Porky Pig opened the door and saw Daffy Duck dressed as the clown singing, then shut the door). * The overweight bird (voiced by Bernice Hansen) got only a few notes of \\"I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles\\" sung before being rejected. * The country bumpkin bird (voiced by Lou Fulton) stuttered through the first and almost all of the second verse of the nursery rhyme Simple Simon before voluntarily rejecting himself. Reception and legacy As with several early Warners cartoons, it is in a sense a music video designed to push a song from the Warners library. The song in question, \\"I Love to Singa\\", was first written by Harold Arlen and E.Y. Harburg for the 1936 Warner Bros. feature-length film The Singing Kid. It is performed three times in the film: first by Al Jolson and Cab Calloway, then by the Yacht Club Boys and Jolson, and finally again by Calloway and Jolson. During this period, it was customary for Warners to have their animation production partner, Leon Schlesinger Productions, make Merrie Melodies cartoons based upon songs from their features. The cartoon has become a cult favorite, with a pervasive impact on popular culture. The short, one of the earliest Merrie Melodies produced in Technicolor's 3-strip process, is recognized as one of Avery's early masterpieces. The May 7, 2013 episode of The Looney Tunes Show, \\"Gribbler's Quest,\\" featured a Merrie Melodies segment in which Gossamer plays the piano and sings \\"I Love to Singa\\" (with new audio sung by Kwesi Boakye). This was one of two instances of the show's Merrie Melodies segment using a classic song rather than a new composition with the other instance being Yellow Bird. However the lyrics were changed to remove racist terms such as \\"mammy.\\" In the first episode of the American animated television series South Park, \\"Cartman Gets an Anal Probe\\", Cartman is hit by a beam, causing him to begin singing and dancing to \\"I Love to Singa\\". Afterwards, Stan Marsh asks \\"What the hell was that?\\" and Kyle Broflovski stating that Cartman \\"Is under alien control!\\" Owl Jolson appears in several levels of the video game tie-in to Looney Tunes: Back in Action, singing \\"I Love to Singa\\" via archive audio. Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck will comment upon Owl when they get close enough.

Hughes attended high school in Abilene at Abilene High School. College career Hughes played college football at Texas Western College, now the University of Texas at El Paso, where he is still listed in the all-time football records; his accomplishments include: * The most all-purpose yards in a single game, 401 in 1965 against North Texas State (he is also second with 360 the same year against Arizona State) * The most yards per reception for a single game, 34.9, also in 1965 against North Texas‚Äîthis is also an NCAA record * The most receptions in a single game, 17, also against Arizona State in 1965 * Second in all-purpose yards for a season, with 2044 in 1966 * First in all-purpose yards per game for a season, 204 in 1965 * Second in all-purpose yards per game for his career with 132 * Fifth in all-purpose yards all-time with 3,989 * Second in career receiving touchdowns with 19 and yardage with 2,882 He was inducted into the UTEP Athletics Hall of Fame in 2006. Professional career Hughes was selected in the fourth round by the Philadelphia Eagles in the 1967 NFL/AFL draft and played three seasons with the Eagles before he was traded to the Detroit Lions prior to the start of the 1970 season. Although listed as a wide receiver he saw most action on special teams, being a backup at wide receiver. In his five-year career he caught only 15 passes. Death On Oct. 24, 1971, the Lions hosted the Chicago Bears at Tiger Stadium. Late in the 4th Quarter, with Detroit trailing 28‚Äì23, the Lions were driving into Chicago territory and Hughes, who entered the game as an injury replacement, caught a pass from quarterback Greg Landry for 32 yards and a first down at the Bears' 37-yard line. Three plays later, Landry threw a pass that tight end Charlie Sanders dropped near the end zone. Hughes, a decoy on the play, began running back to the huddle with 1:02 showing on the clock. Suddenly, he dropped to the turf clutching his chest around the 20-yard line. Hughes collapsed near Bears linebacker Dick Butkus, who saw him begin to convulse violently on the field. Butkus motioned to the sideline frantically to get Hughes assistance. Both teams' doctors and trainers, along with a physician who happened to be attending the game, ran to Hughes to try to save him. An ambulance was called for and arrived to take Hughes to Henry Ford Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 5:34 pm that afternoon. He was 28 years old. The game was played to its conclusion in front of a now-stunned silent crowd in Tiger Stadium, with the Bears' lead holding. The Lions awaited word of Hughes' condition after the game and the players were informed once word had broken that he was dead. A postmortem examination revealed that Hughes was suffering from undiagnosed and advanced arteriosclerosis (one of his coronary arteries was 75% blocked) and that he had a family history of heart disease. The direct cause of death was a coronary thrombosis, which caused a massive myocardial infarction that cut off the blood flow to his heart. Hughes was buried in San Antonio, Texas, and all 40 of his Lions teammates attended his funeral, including head coach Joe Schmidt. He was survived by his widow, Sharon Leah, and by his son, who was 1 year and 11 months old at the time, Brandon Shane. A $10,000 trust fund was set up for his son by an insurance company. His widow filed a $21.5 million malpractice lawsuit against Henry Ford Hospital in 1972 for not diagnosing his condition when he was hospitalized after complaining of chest pains. The lawsuit was settled on October 3, 1974 for an undisclosed amount of money.

He was born in Kapustynie in Volhynia and was educated at the school of the Basilians at Szarogrod, from which in 1785 he ran away in order to enlist as a volunteer in the Polish army. Chlopicki entered the army in 1785 and fought under Ko≈õciuszko in the Uprising of 1794. Warsaw was surrendered to the Russians on November 8, 1794, after which Chlopicki went to France and joined the Army of the Cisalpine Republic under General Jan Henryk DƒÖbrowski. In France he is known as Gr√©goire Joseph Clopicki de Necznia.:fr:Liste des g√©n√©raux de la R√©volution et du Premier Empire He was present at all the engagements fought during 1792-1794, especially distinguishing himself at the Battle of Rac≈Çawice, when he was General Franciszek Rymkiewicz's adjutant. On the formation of the Italian legion he joined the second battalion as major, and was publicly complimented by General Nicolas Oudinot for his extraordinary valour at the storming of Peschiera. He also distinguished himself at the battles of Modena, Busano, Casablanca and Ponto. In 1807 he commanded the first Vistulan regiment, and rendered good service at the battles of Eylau and Friedland. In Spain he obtained the Legion of Honour and the rank of a French Imperial Baron for his heroism at the battle of Epila and the storming of Zaragoza, and in 1809 was promoted to be general of brigade. He was involved in battles from 1806 to 1812, including his involvement in the Spanish Campaign from 1808 to 1811. In 1812, he followed Napoleon to Russia where he fought at Smolensk and on the Moscow. At Smolensk he was seriously wounded, and on the reconstruction of the Polish army in 1813 was made a general of division. Upon his return to Poland in 1814, Tsar Alexander I made him a General in the new Polish army with the rank of a general officer, but a personal insult from Grand Duke Konstantin Pavlovich resulted in his retiring into private life. He held aloof at first from the November Uprising of 1830-31, but at the general request of his countrymen accepted the dictatorship on 5 December 1830. However, he saw the hopelessness of the insurrection and quickly resigned on 23 January; then, however, he joined the army as a private soldier and fought in some battles. At Wawer (February 19) and at the Battle of Olszynka Grochowska (February 20) he displayed all his old bravery, but was so seriously wounded at the Battle of Olszynka Grochowska that he had to be conveyed to Krak√≥w, near which city he lived in complete retirement until his death in 1854.

The film includes elements of tongue-in-cheek horror, comedy, romance and drama, and does not fit neatly into any one genre. Synopsis May Ho (Sammi Cheng) is a woman who inherits a vast fortune when her rich husband drowns in a scuba diving accident in the Caribbean. May told several joking lies to win her Stanford-educated, extremely successful husband, and his mother and sister are less than pleased when they find out, especially since they still harbor suspicions about her motives in marrying her husband after knowing him for only seven days. Nonetheless, the house, fortune, and a portion of the family fashion company are hers. Depressed, alone, and deeply missing her husband (feelings further exacerbated when her husband's dog, Whisky, dies), May goes on a binge of eating, drinking, smoking, watching television, and stealing from her own company's stores, culminating in a drunken car ride and near-fatal car accident. May finds herself lying on the ground outside her car and thinks she is unscathed, until she approaches her vehicle and sees her bloody body in the driver's seat. Ken Wong (Lau Ching Wan) appears to her and scares her into returning to her body, reviving herself. Although she just barely evaded death, the left side of May's face is heavily injured. Later in the hospital, when she removes the gauze covering her left eye, she suddenly realizes she can see ghosts with that eye. She soon finds herself in the constant company and care of the ghost Ken, who claims that he is her former classmate who died when he was 13 in a typhoon out at sea. Throughout their escapades in the realm of the supernatural, May slowly develops a connection with him. However, despite all the ghosts she has encountered, her husband has never appeared to her and she deeply wants to see him, even for just an instant. Ken attempts to help her fulfill this wish before he crosses the Twilight Junction to be reincarnated though it initially appears she did not succeed. Only the spirit of her husband's late dog, Whisky, appears - seemingly close to Ken as if the canine knows him. Ken ask May for a final wish to hug her before he moves on, and in doing so she had to pretend that he was her husband. Later, she goes to check on the restoration of her husband's vintage car and discovers the restorer resembles Ken, who turned to be the real Ken who did not really die when he was 13. She finally realize that the ghost who had been at her side all the while was actually her dead husband in disguise to prevent her from becoming too attached to him and to urge her to move on. She tries several ways to contact him after he had moved on, but all attempts were useless. Her ability to see ghosts had also disappeared. The film ends with a hint of a future romance between May and Ken.

Continental collision is a variation on the fundamental process of subduction, whereby the subduction zone is destroyed, mountains produced, and two continents sutured together. Continental collision is only known to occur on Earth. Continental collision is not an instantaneous event, but may take several tens of millions of years before the faulting and folding caused by collisions stops. The collision between India and Asia has been going on for about 50 million years already and shows no signs of abating. Collision between East and West Gondwana to form the East African Orogen took about 100 million years from beginning (610 Ma) to end (510 Ma). Collision between Gondwana and Laurasia to form Pangea occurred in a relatively brief interval, about 50 million years long. Subduction zone: the collision site The process begins as two continents (different bits of continental crust), separated across a tract of ocean (and oceanic crust), approach each other, while the oceanic crust is slowly consumed at a subduction zone. The subduction zone runs along the edge of one of the continents and dips under it, raising volcanic mountain chains at some distance behind it, such as the Andes of South America today. Subduction involves the whole lithosphere, the density of which is largely controlled by the nature of the crust it carries. Oceanic crust is thin (~6 km thick) and dense (about 3.3 g/cm¬≥), consisting of basalt, gabbro, and peridotite. Consequently, most oceanic crust is subducted easily at an oceanic trench. In contrast, continental crust is thick (~45 km thick) and buoyant, composed mostly of granitic rocks (average density about 2.5 g/cm¬≥). Continental crust is subducted with difficulty, but is subducted to depths of 90-150 km or more, as evidenced by ultra-high pressure (UHP) metamorphic suites. Normal subduction continues as long as the ocean exists, but the subduction system is disrupted as the continent carried by the downgoing plate enters the trench. Because it contains thick continental crust, this lithosphere is less dense than the underlying asthenospheric mantle and normal subduction is disrupted. The volcanic arc on the upper plate is slowly extinguished. Resisting subduction, the crust buckles up and under, raising mountains where a trench used to be. The position of the trench becomes a zone that marks the suture between the two continental terranes. Suture zones are often marked by fragments of the pre-existing oceanic crust and mantle rocks, known as ophiolites. Deep subduction of continental crust The continental crust on the downgoing plate is deeply subducted as part of the downgoing plate during collision, defined as buoyant crust entering a subduction zone. An unknown proportion of subducted continental crust returns to the surface as ultra-high pressure (UHP) metamorphic terranes, which contain metamorphic coesite and/or diamond plus or minus unusual silicon-rich garnets and/or potassium-bearing pyroxenes. The presence of these minerals demonstrate subduction of continental crust to at least 90‚Äì140 km deep. Examples of UHP terranes are known from the Dabie‚ÄìSulu belt of east-central China, the Western Alps, the Himalaya of India, the Kokchetav Massif of Kazakhstan, the Bohemian Massif of Europe, the North Qaidam of Northwestern China, the Western Gneiss Region of Norway, and Mali. Most UHP terranes consist of an imbricated sheets or nappes. The fact that most UHP terranes consist of thin sheets suggests that much thicker, volumetrically dominant tracts of continental crust are more deeply subducted. Orogeny and collapse fault movement An orogeny is underway when mountains begin to grow in the collision zone. There are other modes of mountain formation and orogeny but certainly continental collision is one of the most important. Rainfall and snowfall increase on the mountains as these rise, perhaps at a rate of a few millimeters per year (at a growth rate of 1 mm/year, a 5,000 m tall mountain can form in 5 million years, a time period that is less than 10% of the life of a typical collision zone). River systems form, and glaciers may grow on the highest peaks. Erosion accelerates as the mountains rise, and great volumes of sediment are shed into the rivers, which carry sediment away from the mountains to be deposited in sedimentary basins in the surrounding lowlands. Crustal rocks are thrust faulted over the sediments and the mountain belt broadens as it rises in height. A crustal root also develops, as required by isostasy; mountains can be high if underlain by thicker crust. Crustal thickening may happen as a result of crustal shortening or when one crust overthrusts the other. Thickening is accompanied by heating, so the crust becomes weaker as it thickens. The lower crust begins to flow and collapse under the growing mountain mass, forming rifts near the crest of the mountain range. The lower crust may partially melt, forming anatectic granites which then rise into the overlying units, forming granite intrusions. Crustal thickening provides one of two negative feedbacks on mountain growth in collision zones, the other being erosion. The popular notion that erosion is responsible for destroying mountains is only half correct - viscous flow of weak lower mantle also reduces relief with time, especially once the collision is complete and the two continents are completely sutured. Convergence between the continents continues because the crust is still being pulled down by oceanic lithosphere sinking in the subduction zone to either side of the collision as well as beneath the impinging continent. The pace of mountain building associated with the collision is measured by radiometric dating of igneous rocks or units that have been metamorphosed during the collision and by examining the record of sediments shed from the rising mountains into the surrounding basins. The pace of ancient convergence can be determined with paleomagnetic measurements, while the present rate of convergence can be measured with GPS.  Far-field effects  The effects of the collision are felt far beyond the immediate site of collision and mountain-building. As convergence between the two continents continues, the region of crustal thickening and elevation will become broader. If there is an oceanic free face, the adjacent crustal blocks may move towards it. As an example of this, the collision of India with Asia forced large regions of crust to move south to form modern Southeast Asia. Another example is the collision of Arabia with Asia, which is squeezing the Anatolian Plate (present day Turkey). As a result, Turkey is moving west and south into the Mediterranean Sea and away from the collision zone. These far-field effects may result in the formation of rifts, and rift valleys such as that occupied by Lake Baikal, the deepest lake on Earth.  Fossil collision zones Continental collisions are a critical part of the supercontinent cycle and have happened many times in the past. Ancient collision zones are deeply eroded but may still be recognized because these mark sites of intense deformation, metamorphism, and plutonic activity that separate tracts of continental crust having different geologic histories prior to the collision. Old collision zones are commonly called \\"suture zones\\" by geologists, because this is where two previous continents are joined or sutured together.

He became the Bishop of St David's in 1897. Born at Ysgubor Wen, Caernarfonshire (Gwynedd), his father Griffith Owen was a Welsh Calvinistic Methodist. Though he never deviated from his own loyalties, he watched his son‚Äôs career as an Anglican with great pride. Owen‚Äôs mother, Ann Jones from Aberdaron, could not easily reconcile herself to her son becoming an Anglican, however, nor could she wholly accept the fact that he married an English wife. In 1872, Owen was awarded a mathematical scholarship at Jesus College, Oxford, where he read classics and mathematics. As a graduate, he began a teaching career at Botwnnog grammar school. Whilst at Botwnnog, Owen discovered an interest in the Anglicanism and was gradually drawn towards ordination, though he decided to teach for a few years until he was sure of his vocation. As a respected educator, Owen was appointed Professor of Welsh at St David‚Äôs College, Lampeter (now the University of Wales Trinity Saint David) in 1879 and committed himself in two respects: he would advance the study of the Welsh language at the college and would aim to be ordained before, or soon after, joining the college. In both respects he was successful and was ordained deacon in 1879 and priest in 1880. In 1889, A. G. Edwards, newly appointed Bishop of St Asaph, invited Owen to join him as dean. At St Asaph, Owen maintained an interest in education and his colleagues nominated him to serve on the charter committee of the nascent University of Wales, established in 1891, which gave him a new emphasis to his existing interest in higher education. In 1892, Owen returned to Lampeter as principal, an office he was to hold until he became Bishop of Saint David's in 1897. His time as principal was not an easy one: he fought a sustained battle for Lampeter to be included in the newly formed federal University of Wales, which had already embraced the colleges at Aberystwyth, Bangor and Cardiff universities. Lampeter already conferred its own degrees under Royal Charter and, for Owen, it was unthinkable that it should be excluded from this new university. Those against Lampeter's admission, however, argued that the original plan for Lampeter had been to found a theological college and, as such, it should be excluded like any other denominational college in the nation. Owen was furious, regarding Lampeter as a university institution and theological college. He petitioned the privy council, sparking a debate in the House of Lords. Lampeter‚Äôs case was upheld, but the Prime Minister, William Ewart Gladstone, refused to be moved and the University of Wales received its royal charter with Lampeter firmly excluded. Too late to effect this outcome, Owen established a supplemental charter for the college, re-affirming in the plainest terms that the college existed to \\"receive and educate any person whatsoever, whether destined for Holy Orders or not\\". Lampeter was not to be admitted to the university until 1971. In January 1897, William Basil Jones, Bishop of St David‚Äôs, died and, within six weeks, Owen had been named as his successor. Much of Owen‚Äôs episcopate was marked by controversy and he was not afraid of confrontation, even so he led the Church in Wales through the difficult disestablishment and become regarded as spokesman for the Welsh church during this time. In private correspondence there was even a suggestion that he should become Wales‚Äô first archbishop, but he refused to consider it. In Easter week 1920, he presided over the election of Bishop Edwards as the first Archbishop of Wales. Owen died of a short illness on 4 November 1926 and was buried on 9 November at Abergwili, Carmarthenshire. Owen is extremely well documented not least in the press, both denominational and national (in both senses) due to his combative nature and the controversial positions he took. The two volume Life by his daughter, Eluned Owen, is inevitably partial but most readily available. Sources Eluned E.

In a more narrow sense, binders are liquid or dough-like substances that harden by a chemical or physical process and bind fibres, filler powder and other particles added into it. Examples include glue, adhesive and thickening. Examples of mechanical binders are bond stones in masonry and tie beams in timber framing.  Classification  Binders are loosely classified as organic (bitums, animal and plant glues, polymers) and inorganic (lime, cement, gypsum, liquid glass, etc.). These can be either metallic or ceramic as well as polymeric depending on the nature of the main material. For example, in the compound WC-Co (Tungsten Carbide used in cutting tools) Co constitutes the binding agent for the WC particles. Based on their chemical resistance, binders are classified by the field of use: non-hydraulic (gypsum, air-cements, magnesia, hydrated lime), hydraulic (Roman cement, portland cement, hydraulic lime), acid-resistant (silicon fluoride cement, quartz cement), and autoclavable (harden at 170 to 300¬∞–° i.e. 8-16 atm pressure and, e.g., comprise CaSiO3 materials).  Physical properties  Some materials labeled as binders such as cement have a high compressive strength but low tensile strength and need to be reinforced with fibrous material or rebar if tension and shear forces will be applied. Other binding agents such as resins may be tough and possibly elastic but can neither bear compressive nor tensile force. Tensile strength is greatly improved in composite materials consisting of resin as the matrix and fiber as a reinforcement. Compressive strength can be improved by adding filling material. Uses Binders hold together pigments and sometimes filling material to form paints, pastels, and other materials used for artistic and utilitarian painting. Materials include wax, linseed oil, natural gums such as gum arabic or gum tragacanth, methyl cellulose, or proteins such as egg white or casein. Glue is traditionally made by the boiling of hoofs, bones, or skin of animals and then mixing the hard gelatinous residue with water. Natural gum-based binders are made from substances extracted from plants. Larger amounts of dry substance are added to liquid binders in order to cast or model sculptures and reliefs. In cooking, various edible thickening agents are used as binders. Some of them, e.g. tapioca flour, lactose, sucrose, microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone and various starches are also used in pharmacology in making tablets. Tablet binders include lactose powder, sucrose powder, tapioca starch (cassava flour) and microcrystalline cellulose. In building construction, concrete uses cement as a binder. Asphalt pavement uses bitumen binder. Traditionally straw and natural fibres are used to strengthen clay in wattle-and-daub construction and in the building material cob which would otherwise become brittle after drying. Sand is added to improve compressive strength, hardness and reduce shrinkage. The binding property of clay is also used widely to prepare shaped articles (e.g. pots and vases) or to bind solid pieces (e.g. bricks). In composite materials, epoxy, polyester or phenolic resins are common. In reinforced carbon‚Äìcarbon, plastic or pitch resin is used as a source of carbon released through pyrolysis. Transite, hypertufa, papercrete and petecrete used cement as a binder. In explosives, wax or polymers like polyisobutylene or styrene-butadiene rubber are often used as binders for plastic explosives. For polymer-bonded explosives, various synthetic polymers are used. In rocket fuels, polybutadiene acrylonitrile copolymer was used in 1960-70's big solid-fuel booster rocket fuels. Organic binders, designed to disintegrate by heat during baking, are used in sintering.  History  In the Classical World painters used materials like egg, wax, honey, lime, casein, linseed oil or bitumen as binders to mix with pigment in order to hold the pigment particles together in the formation of paint. Egg-based tempera was especially popular in Europe from the Middle Ages until the early 16th century. However, since that time, the binder of choice for paint has been oil.

' was the head of the domestic affairs section of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II. In August 1945, he helped plan a coup, the Ky≈´j≈ç incident, along with Major Kenji Hatanaka and a handful of others. The intent of the attempted coup was to prevent the Emperor's announcement of Japan's surrender from being broadcast. As one of the most senior officers involved in the coup, he was, at times, the leader of the group. He believed, as did his co-conspirators and many others, that the Emperor had to be separated from his peace-seeking advisors and convinced to change his mind. They believed that the costs of repelling an Allied land invasion would not be devastating, and that, ultimately, Japan would be better off under military rule, with his brother-in-law, Minister of War Korechika Anami as sh≈çgun. Takeshita had a close relationship with Anami, and was among the few who had the Minister's ear; Anami considered Takeshita one of his closest confidants, and so it was through him that the rebels gained much of their information and influence. Ultimately, however, Anami insisted that while he was sympathetic with the rebels' cause, he could not actively oppose the wishes of the Emperor. Despite being so trusted by the Minister, he was at times confused as to Anami's true desires regarding the coup. In the afternoon on August 14, Anami officially announced to the conspirators that the Cabinet had decided to terminate the war. The Cabinet operated by unanimous decision, and so this meant that Anami had given in. Faced with the now fully official opposition of the Cabinet, and the final loss of any aid Anami might have provided, Takeshita withdrew from the plot along with Col. Okikatsu Arao. Early on the morning of August 15, 1945, Major Hatanaka spoke with Takeshita, trying one last time to convince him to rejoin the rebellion, and to secure the aid of General Anami. Takeshita refused, and realized, given the circumstances, that Anami would probably try to commit suicide. He traveled to the General's house, and acted as kaishakunin, second, in his brother-in-law's act of seppuku. Unlike several of his co-conspirators, Takeshita survived through the events of August 15, and, as of 1968, was the head of the Command and General Staff college, a general in the Land Self- Defense Forces.

He wrote about 200 compositions including the popular \\"Caller Herrin'\\". Early life Nathaniel was born to Niel Gow and Margaret Wiseman, at Inver, near Dunkeld, Perthshire, on 28 May 1763. He was taught the fiddle at first by his father, but was soon sent to Edinburgh where he was taught successively by Robert \\"Red Rob\\" Mackintosh, the fiddler Alexander McGlashan, and his elder brother William Gow. He also learnt the cello under Joseph Reinagle. In 1782 he was appointed as one of His Majesty's herald trumpeters for Scotland. Career In 1796, Gow started a music-selling and publishing business with William Shepherd at 41 North Bridge, Edinburgh, which continued until Shepherd's death in 1813. Gow became prominent as the leader of many bands, and was important at many assemblies such as the Caledonian Hunt Balls. His patron was the Duke of Atholl. Between 1799 and 1824 he published a significant number of collections of tunes. He married twice, and had five daughters and one son by his first wife, Janet Fraser. By his second wife, Mary Hog, whom he married in 1814, he had three sons and two daughters; only Augusta seems to have followed in the family profession, and became a teacher of music in Edinburgh. Gow played for King George IV at the Royal Caledonian Hunt ball during his visit to Scotland in 1822. Nathaniel Gow died in Edinburgh on 19 January 1831, and was buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard.

An analyst at CTU Los Angeles (and later New York), she is Jack Bauer's most trusted colleague, often doing unconventional and unauthorized favors for him, even at personal risk to herself. As O'Brian, Rajskub appeared in 137 episodes of 24, more than any other actor except series star Kiefer Sutherland, who appeared in all 204 episodes of the series. UGO.com named her one of the best TV nerds. AOL named her one of the 100 Most Memorable Female TV Characters. Characteristics O'Brian is exceptionally intelligent; in particular she displays extraordinary mastery of computer science. Spending most of her time behind a computer terminal, she is rarely sent on field assignments; however, she has demonstrated proficiency with weapons in Day 4, 5, and 8. She works very well under pressure, yet it is obvious when she is under pressure, that she has always demonstrated a degree of social awkwardness. Despite her lack of social graces, Chloe has gained several friends at CTU and has shown to have a great deal of loyalty to them. She helped CTU Agent Chase Edmunds take care of his daughter from a previous relationship after the child's mother abandoned Chase and their child. She even tried to pass the child off as her own, so as to keep Chase's then- girlfriend, Kim Bauer, from knowing. Before the start of Day 6, she and Milo Pressman briefly dated. This was a source of hostility between Milo and Morris. Toward the end of Day 6, it is revealed that Chloe is pregnant with Morris's child. In interviews to promote the show's return to Fox with the miniseries, 24: Live Another Day, actor Kiefer Sutherland revealed that Rajskub would be reprising Chloe, but hinted that the relationship between her and Jack Bauer would be more adversarial than before. He also suggested that the reason for this was possibly related to her actions during the show's final season. Appearances =24: Season 3= Introduced in the third season of the series, Chloe O'Brian is a senior analyst at CTU. Her other experience at CTU includes Intelligence Agent and Internet Protocol Manager. She received her education at the University of California-Davis, having received her BSc in Computer Science. In 24: The Game, it is revealed that before coming to CTU Los Angeles, she worked at CTU: Washington DC with Chase Edmunds. =24: Season 4= Chloe continues to work at CTU as an analyst. She continues to help Jack (at the time, not a member of CTU) to follow the terrorists while risking her career. She is detained and fired when Director of CTU Los Angeles Erin Driscoll (the person who fired Jack) discovered Chloe is helping Jack behind her back. When Driscoll resigns and Michelle Dessler steps in, she is reinstated since none of the other CTU employees were as skilled as Chloe was. When the crisis ends later in the day, she, along with Michelle Dessler, Tony Almeida and former President David Palmer, help Jack to fake his death. =24: Season 5= Chloe continues to grow as a person with the introduction of a love interest, a subordinate named Spenser Wolff. She finds out later that Spenser is a mole (albeit unknowingly), and turns him in immediately. He later states he is not a mole but at CTU as an Internal Affairs investigator. Chloe is the only person who had continual contact with Jack since he faked his death. Chloe is also the only one involved in the plot to fake his death to survive from murder attempts committed by unknown parties (later discovered to be President Charles Logan and Jack's brother, Graem Bauer), narrowly escaping a car bomb and a subsequent attack by the terrorists who planted the bomb. She is briefly arrested for aiding Jack, though her skills with computers allow her to avoid the consequences of her actions and returns to work at CTU. Sadly, Edgar Stiles does not survive the events of Day 5 and Chloe watches him die through the glass door. Chloe is visibly shaken by the death of one of her few best friends and regrets having been short with him earlier that day. Chloe is later forced to work directly against her superiors in Homeland Security in order to help Audrey and Jack. She hacks into a CTU server and interferes with a satellite tracking Audrey's car. She is able to slip into the bathroom just before being caught red handed, but Homeland Security bureaucrat Miles Papazian is very suspicious that she is deliberately interfering with their orders to attempt to apprehend Jack, at that time subject to a warrant by President Logan. Homeland Security tricks Chloe into calling a pay phone where Audrey is currently located. They track the call to Van Nuys Airport and alert President Logan that they have located Bauer. Chloe is then put into custody by Miles. However, Chloe steals his keycard and escapes from detention. She grabs her laptop and leaves CTU. When leaving she encounters Shari Rothenburg but Chloe blackmails her to stay quiet. Chloe works with Buchanan from his home but Papazian is able to track her. Karen Hayes contacts Bill to alert them that Papazian has sent a team to arrest Chloe and that she has mere minutes to leave the house. Chloe is able to escape and continues to aid Jack from a nearby hotel. Combined with Hayes, she works to help Jack locate the passenger on a private plane in possession of the audio tape implicating Logan in Palmer's death. Eventually she confirms that it is the co-pilot who has the tape. Hayes and Buchanan bring Chloe back to CTU shortly thereafter to help Jack make an emergency landing, because Logan has ordered an F18 to shoot down the plane. Bill Buchanan is able to locate a 4000 ft. strip on a Los Angeles Highway to use for a landing. Jack eventually lands safely and escapes from Logan's marine force with the help of Curtis Manning. Once Jack gets the audio tape back to CTU, Chloe sets to work preparing the audio tape for the United States Attorney General. Unfortunately, unbeknownst to Chloe, Miles destroys the digital recording while she is distracted. In the final hours of Day 5, Chloe aids Jack in preventing Bierko from firing missiles from a Russian submarine. After the mission ends successfully, Jack tells her that he is going to attempt to get a confession from Logan and will need her help. With help from Mike Novick, Chloe is able to get Jack the necessary papers to board the presidential helicopter as a co-pilot. After Jack places a listening device on Logan that records his confession to Martha, Chloe transmits the recording to the Attorney General. When the crisis ends, Bill brings her something from Edgar's locker, a picture of Chloe and Edgar together. An emotionally spent Chloe leaves CTU for the day with her ex-husband Morris O'Brian, whom she had enlisted to help her at CTU. =24: Season 6= After the failed assassination of Assad via military helicopter, Chloe found an image of Jack rescuing the terrorist. She shared the information with Bill Buchanan, who conceded that from Jack's perspective, a rescue was the right action. Chloe suggests if Jack is right, then Fayed should be monitored. Buchanan agrees, and subsequently CTU obtains information that Fayed was indeed behind the latest waves of bombings. Chloe is later able to recover data from the hard drive of one of Fayed's men that he was particularly interested in a specific set of terrorists Fayed demanded be set free. Later, after Jack notices Curtis Manning's demeanor around Assad, asks her to find out if there is a past connection between the two men. She later confirms that Manning's military unit took heavy losses at Assad's hands and that Assad beheaded two members of Manning's unit on television. Jack uses that information to prevent Manning from killing Assad, though the price is Manning's life. When chatter is intercepted between Fayed and Darren McCarthy, a profile of the man able to arm the four remaining suitcase nukes is sent, though the message is badly degraded. Morris works on reconstructing the image, while Milo finds information that states Morris's brother has been exposed to the radiation from the Valencia bomb and is in a hospital. Chloe informs him, but while Morris wants to go to his brother's side at once, Chloe insists he retrieve the data. After Morris downloads an illegal program that will speed up the reconstruction of the data, he leaves, and Chloe kisses him goodbye. Chloe then monitors the retrieval to find that the engineer was, in fact, Morris. Bill has her call Morris via cell phone with Jack on the line, and Chloe jumps nervously after hearing gunfire erupt as McCarthy corners and kidnaps Morris from his car and put into his with the help of McCarthy's girlfriend, Rita. Chloe works to help locate Morris, who was tortured by Fayed into programming a device which would allow the detonation of the suitcase nukes. Chloe gives Jack the needed information in how to disable the suitcase nuke Fayed left behind after CTU assaulted his safe house. Afterwards, Jack and Chloe have a reunion at CTU where she thanks him for saving Morris's life, and she tells him she's glad Fayed didn't kill him. Jack thanks her for everything. She later visits Morris in the infirmary, but her attempts at compassion are dismissed by Morris's claims that he's responsible for Fayed ability to arm the remaining suitcase nukes. He tells her to go away. She later goes back to say they have a lead, and asks him to return to duty. He dismisses it as a ruse to get him to go back to work, and admits he's a coward. Chloe retorts he's pissing her off, and Morris says she can add it to his list of failings. Chloe slaps him, and he tells her if she wants to save somebody, save somebody who is worth saving. She tries to slap him again, but he blocks it. She tells Morris to stop feeling sorry for himself and get back to work. Later, she finds Morris is not at his work station. She investigates his palmtop, and calls his sponsor, who says she hasn't been in touch with Morris for years. Chloe confronts Morris in the men's room. He tells her he has a different sponsor now ‚Äì who he did speak to on the phone ‚Äì and berates Chloe for being 'obsessive' about his contacts. However, when Chloe leaves, he drains what is left of a bottle of whiskey down the sink. When Milo suspects that Morris has been drinking again, he asks Chloe to check Morris for any signs of alcohol. She reluctantly agrees, and walks over to him and kissed him, when he asked \\"What was that for?\\" she responded by saying \\"Just checking your breath.\\" Later, she helps Jack to steal the bomb's schematics. However, Morris discovers her act and forces her to tell Bill. When Bill orders everyone to help Jack Bauer under presidential order, he excludes her saying that \\"I don't trust you\\" but he changes his mind in the next episode when he tells her he needs his best people working on this. Chloe is apparently upset and angry at Morris for forcing her to tell Bill the truth and the pair argue until Chloe's anger gets the better of her and she throws the fact that he armed nuclear weapons for terrorists, back in his face. Chloe insists that she didn't mean it but Morris puts in for a transfer out of Com and to no longer work aside Chloe. She is visibly upset and scolds herself for pushing the issue too far. Later, she attempts to apologize, but Morris tells her that their relationship is over. As Morris goes back to work, Chloe bursts into tears. Minutes later, Nadia notices that Chloe is not at her station and Morris claims not to know where she is. Later, Chloe confronts Morris over his decision to break up. Morris tells Chloe that he ended their relationship because he felt that neither of them would be able to move past the fact that he had armed the nuclear weapons. Soon afterwards, CTU came under attack and the entire staff, including Chloe, was taken hostage. Eventually Nadia, Jack, and Morris attacked the men holding them hostage and Chloe commended Nadia on her bravery. While at work, Chloe faints and is taken to the CTU medical department. It was revealed near the end of the final episode that she is pregnant. Morris, presumably the father, appears pleased at the news, and the two resume their relationship once again (in typical Morris fashion, he dismisses their breakup with a \\"Sod that!\\" comment). =24: Season 7= Chloe does not appear in 24: Redemption, the two-hour TV prequel, which aired on Sunday, November 23, 2008, she and Bill Buchanan first appear in the third episode of the season. Actress Mary Lynn Rajskub revealed her role in the upcoming seventh season: ‚ÄúI show up, time has passed and I have a 4-year-old and a wedding ring, [and I'm] calling Morris (Carlo Rota) while I'm busy. So far he's taking care of the baby, but he'll be around.\\" \\"We're a rogue operation ‚Äì we are working outside of the government to uncover the conspiracy within the government.\\" When asked by Matobo if she is a federal agent, she replies, \\"No, I'm a stay-at-home-mom.\\" She and Morris have named their son Prescott. Kiefer Sutherland commented \\"Chloe is crankier than ever; the dammit count is pretty high.\\" Chloe was working with Bill Buchanan and Tony Almeida who was undercover with Emerson's gang, to uncover the conspiracy within the US government who had been supporting General Juma and his regime in Sangala, Africa. Chloe co-ordinates numerous operations for the team, until later they become compromised through their efforts to secure the CIP device used by Juma's henchman, Dubaku to launch attacks on America. After this Chloe collaborates with the FBI, working from their headquarters in Washington. Later on, after Dubaku is captured and the threat seemingly ended, Jack is informed by Tony of another impending attack. Jack enlists Chloe's help while he follows a lead on Ryan Burnett ‚Äî a US-based conspirator named as a traitor in the files retrieved from Dubaku. Jack asks Chloe to erase Burnett's name from the files to buy him time to get to Burnett and interrogate him. Janis Gold, one of the FBI's analysts, becomes suspicious of Chloe's and finds out what she has done. Janis reports her to Agent Larry Moss, who has Chloe arrested and detained. Chloe is later released when her husband Morris cuts an immunity deal for her, and the two go home to get some sleep. This plot development was partially to work around Rajskub's pregnancy. In earlier episodes, \\"I sit behind my computer and every time I stand up, they yell cut, and bring in a body double.\\" Chloe's arrest allowed her to be temporarily written out of the show so that Rajskub could go on maternity leave; meanwhile, Morris takes over her role in the story. Chloe is called back into action by Jack at around 3:30 AM, when CTU's servers are dug out of storage and made available for FBI use; Chloe is (of course) the person best suited to integrating them and getting them running. Jack tells her that Tony has betrayed them, but (as of 4 AM) has not informed her of his own condition. Jack eventually informed her of his condition, but asked her to remain focused and help them find Tony and the pathogen. Thanks to Chloe's help, Jack is able to find and capture Tony. However, the tables are turned and Jack is kidnapped by Tony. When Kim recovers a laptop from one of Tony's lackeys, Chloe is able to track Jack's location and save him. At the 7:30 am mark, Chloe has decided to stay and be there for Jack in his final hours. =24: Season 8= In Season 8, Chloe is re-employed by the revived CTU, but is at times struggling with the new hardware, software and interfaces; dialogue between her and Head of CTU Brian Hastings (Mykelti Williamson) indicates that Morris has lost his job and Chloe is keeping the family afloat. She is also subordinate to Dana Walsh (Katee Sackhoff), who holds Chloe's usual position of Head Analyst, causing the insecure Chloe additional stress. Chloe quickly goes head-to-head with her co-workers when evidence is uncovered that implicates journalist Meredith Reed (Jennifer Westfeldt) in an assassination plot against President Omar Hassan (Anil Kapoor). Chloe is suspicious of the ease with which CTU obtained this evidence, feeling that Reed might be being framed by actual conspirators. Hastings refuses to follow up on her suspicions, even threatening her job if she takes time to investigate, so she recruits Jack to do it instead. As it turns out, Chloe's instincts are proved correct, leading CTU to the actual assassin, and Hastings formally apologizes and commends her actions in the official logs. Later, after Dana's behavior in relation to former associate Kevin Wade (Clayne Crawford) affects her job performance, Chloe is then reinstated to Head Analyst, with Dana now reporting to her. In the 183rd episode of the show (Season 8, 6:00 am ‚Äì 7:00 am), Chloe surpassed Tony Almeida (Carlos Bernard)'s episode count of 115, becoming the character who has appeared in the most episodes of the show other than Jack Bauer. Perhaps appropriately, just after 8 am that day, Chloe is promoted to (Acting) Director of CTU, replacing Hastings. This puts Chloe in an abnormal position in regard to Jack: normally she helps him carry out clandestine operations in defiance of their mutual boss, but now she is the boss he is defying. This new dynamic is put to the test within two hours of her promotion, when Jack steals a helicopter to pursue justice in direct defiance of orders from President Allison Taylor (Cherry Jones). Chloe sticks with the responsibilities of her position, ordering pursuit instead of supporting Jack; this is the first time in several years the two have pursued clashing goals. At the end of the 8th season (3:00 pm to 4:00 pm), Chloe manages to talk Jack out of assassinating the Russian president in revenge of a friend's murder earlier that day and gets him to agree to expose the conspiracy her way. Jack orders Chloe to shoot him in order to free herself from suspicion and to expose the cover up of Hassan's murder. Chloe refuses to go through with it until Jack points the gun at his own head, forcing her to either shoot him or having him kill himself. She shoots him in the shoulder. Coordinating with Cole Ortiz, she tries to get evidence collected by Jack vital to expose the cover up, but is stopped by Jason Pillar and CTU. After Jack is saved from death by President Alison Taylor's order, he calls Chloe and makes her promise to protect Jack's family, and along with President Taylor, plans to buy him as much time as she can for him to flee the country before the Americans and Russians come after him for his actions. Jack thanks her for all she has done for him since she joined CTU and forgives her for her actions during the day. Chloe has the distinction of speaking the final line in the series by saying \\"shut it down\\" to Arlo Glass in regards to the CTU drone. As Jack looks one last time towards CTU's monitoring, Chloe gives one final tearful look to Jack in CTU's monitor screen before the clock counts down to zero. In the Season 8 DVD bonuses, it is revealed that Chloe was arrested soon after the events of Day 8 by the FBI for covering up Jack's escape. She returned in the miniseries 24: Live Another Day, which started airing in May 2014. =24: Live Another Day= Four years after the end of Day 8, Chloe is situated in London and has taken to a new, darker appearance. Since being arrested for helping Jack escape, she has become a member of the free information movement and is working with a hacker group named Open Cell, which devotes itself to exposing government secrets. Her new goals are a stark contrast to the loyal CTU agent Chloe once was; it is suggested she was betrayed by the American government, at one point telling Jack not to judge her \\"after what [she's] been through.\\" At the start of the miniseries, she was being detained by the CIA for leaking thousands of classified DOD documents. Jack, allowing himself to be captured to gain access to the facility, frees her and then follows her to the hideout of Open Cell's leader, hacker Adrian Cross (Michael Wincott). Chloe convinces her colleagues to assist Jack in locating Derrick Yates (Joseph Millson), a former member of their movement who Jack believes to be involved in a planned assassination attempt on President James Heller (William Devane). By this time, Yates had already managed to commandeer a U.S. drone and fire upon a military convoy in Afghanistan, killing two American and two British soldiers. Together, Jack and Chloe track Yates to an apartment complex, but are circumvented by the CIA's efforts to apprehend them. After losing Yates, Jack evades capture and escapes with Chloe. In the show's third episode, Jack discovers Yates' corpse, left behind by his female companion, Simone Al-Harazi (Emily Berrington). Chloe loses sight of Al-Harazi after being distracted by a passing family, after which she reveals to Jack that Morris and Prescott were killed as a result of her knowledge of Jack's disappearance following Day 8. Together, they return to Open Cell's headquarters in order to establish a cover for Jack to infiltrate the U.S. embassy in London and question Lieutenant Chris Tanner (John Boyega), the man Yates had framed for the drone attack. However, Cross betrays Jack by botching Jack's cover; Chloe senses something amiss and warns him to escape, giving Jack enough time to create a diversion and enter the embassy. Throughout the rest of the day Chloe aids Jack as he searches for Margot Al-Harazi. Chloe manages to hack into Al-Harazi's video feed from her drone's cameras and fake President Heller's death and then track her with Adrian Cross' help. Jack kills Al-Harazi and stops an attack on Waterloo station, but Chloe refuses to have anything more to do with him, telling Jack it was good working with him again before rejoining Cross. After Cross receives the override device from Steve Navarro, Chloe tries to steal it but is forced by Cross to give it back. She is shocked to discover that Cross is working with Jack's old enemy Cheng Zhi who forces Chloe to fix the device and murders Cross who admits that he learned that the death of Morris and Prescott were actually an accident and he kept it from her so she wouldn't leave him. A horrified Chloe can only watch as Cheng uses the override device to order the sinking of a Chinese aircraft carrier by a United States submarine to spark a war between the two countries, but manages to leave a recording of Cheng behind so that Jack knows who is behind everything. As she is being transported, Chloe escapes and contacts Jack. Remorseful over her decisions, Chloe offers Jack her help in guiding him through Cheng's hideout, telling him she's the only friend he's got left. Reluctant to trust her, Jack agrees. Chloe runs satellite surveillance for Jack and Belcheck, but they lose contact with her shortly before Jack captures Cheng. Shortly afterwards, Jack gets a call from the Russians to trade himself for Chloe who they have kidnapped. The next morning, Jack meets with the Russians and willingly trades himself for Chloe and his family's safety. Before leaving, Jack affirms that Chloe is his best friend and asks her to look after Kim. As Jack leaves with the Russians, a reluctant Chloe drives away with Belcheck.

He has been the president of both the American Academy of Forensic Sciences and the American College of Legal Medicine, and headed the board of trustees of the American Board of Legal Medicine. He served as County Commissioner and Allegheny County Coroner and Medical Examiner serving the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. He is perhaps best known for his criticism of the Warren Commission's findings concerning the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Background Wecht was born to Jewish immigrant parents in a tiny mining village in Dunkard Township, Pennsylvania, called Bobtown. His father, Nathan Wecht, was a Lithuanian-born storekeeper; his Ukrainian-born mother, Fannie Rubenstein, was a homemaker and helped out in the store. When Wecht was young, Nathan moved the family first to McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania, and then to the Hill District neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and opened a neighborhood grocery store. He attended and graduated from the now closed Fifth Avenue High School in Pittsburgh. Wecht had musical leanings and was concertmaster of the University of Pittsburgh Orchestra during his undergraduate years.Music Man (letter) Pitt Magazine, Spring 2007, p. 3 He earned a B.S. from the University of Pittsburgh in 1952, an M.D. degree from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine in 1956, an LL.B. from the University of Pittsburgh School of Law in 1962, and a J.D. degree from the University of Maryland School of Law. After serving in the United States Air Force, he became a forensic pathologist. He served on the staff of St. Francis Hospital in Pittsburgh before becoming Deputy Coroner of Allegheny County in 1965. Four years later he was elected coroner. Wecht served as coroner from 1970 to 1980, and again from 1996 to 2006. Forensics career Wecht became famous appearing on television and consulting on deaths with a high media profile. Some of the cases include; Robert F. Kennedy, Sharon Tate, Brian Jones, the Symbionese Liberation Army shootout, John F. Kennedy, the Legionnaires' Disease outbreak, Elvis Presley, Kurt Cobain, JonBen√©t Ramsey, Dr. Herman Tarnower (the Scarsdale diet guru), Danielle van Dam, Sunny von B√ºlow, the Branch Davidian incident, Vincent Foster, Laci Peterson, Daniel and Anna Nicole Smith, and Rebecca Zahau. During his career, Wecht performed more than 14,000 autopsies. He is a clinical professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and an adjunct professor of law at Duquesne University. =Cyril H. Wecht and Pathology Associates= Since 1962, Wecht has had a private practice. He has served as a medical-legal and forensic pathology consultant in both civil and criminal cases. Wecht is consulted by both plaintiffs' and defense attorneys in civil cases, and by both prosecutors and defense attorneys in criminal cases in jurisdictions throughout the United States and abroad. His forensic consultant engagements include: * for the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office in regard to the 1968 Robert F. Kennedy assassination, the 1969 Sharon Tate/LaBianca cases, and the 1974 Symbionese Liberation Army Deaths; * for the Health Hospital, Panama Canal Zone as a member of the Special Expert Panel on American Legionnaires' Disease (Department of Health, Education and Welfare, Centers for Disease Control) * for the ABC network television show 20/20 in regard to the John F. Kennedy assassination (1976) and the death of Elvis Presley (1979) * U.S. House of Representatives Select Committee on Assassinations, Forensic Pathology Panel * for the 1991 film JFK * the expert on the Jeffrey Locker case. JFK assassination In 1965 Wecht presented a paper critiquing the Warren Commission to the meeting of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences. In 1972 Wecht was the first civilian ever given permission to examine the Kennedy assassination evidence. It was Wecht who first discovered that Kennedy's brain, and all related data in the killing, had gone missing. In 1978, he testified before the House Select Committee on Assassinations as the lone dissenter on a nine-member forensic pathology panel re-examining the assassination of John F. Kennedy, which had concurred with the Warren Commission conclusions and single bullet theory. Out of the four official examinations into the Kennedy Assassination, Wecht is the only forensic pathologist who has disagreed with the conclusion that both the single bullet theory and Kennedy's head wounds are mutually consistent.Vincent Bugliosi, Reclaiming History, p. 863 Investigation into the death of Daniel Smith Wecht was hired by Callenders and Co, a Bahamian law firm, to do an independent autopsy on the body of Daniel Smith, the son of Anna Nicole Smith, who died while visiting his mother in the Bahamas. Wecht attested that Daniel Smith died as a result of the interaction of methadone, sertraline (Zoloft) and escitalopram (Lexapro). In 2000, the Duquesne University School of Law established the Cyril H. Wecht Institute of Forensic Science and Law. The Institute offers graduate degree and professional certificate programs in forensic science to a diverse group of students spanning the disciplines of law, nursing, law enforcement, pharmacy, the health sciences, business, the environmental sciences and psychology. =Books= Wecht has written numerous books, including: *From Crime Scene to Courtroom (2011) *Investigation of Police Related Deaths (2011) *Forensic Science and Law (2006) *Tales from the Morgue (2005) *Forensic Aspects of Chemical and Biological Terrorism (2004) *Mortal Evidence (2003) *Into EVIDENCE: Truth, Lies and Unresolved Mysteries in the Murder of JFK *November 22, 1963: A Reference Guide to the JFK Assassination *Grave Secrets: A Leading Forensic Expert Reveals the Startling Truth about O.J.

Four years later he was elected Coroner of Allegheny County. Wecht served as coroner from 1970 to 1980. His initial departure from the office of Coroner was not met without controversy. Wecht did not resign as Coroner until January 9, two days after his swearing-in as an Allegheny County Commissioner, as the law did not prohibit him from holding both the offices of Coroner and Commissioner. He resigned under pressure from a variety of sources, including his predecessor as Coroner, Dr. Ralph Stalter, a Republican, and the administration of Governor Dick Thornburgh, also a Republican. He initially recommended that Dr. Joshua Perper succeed him, and indeed Perper held the title of Acting Coroner until Thornburgh appointed Dr. Sanford Edburg to succeed Wecht. While Perper initially rejected the appointment as unconstitutional, the State Supreme Court upheld Thornburgh's right to appoint Edberg, who duly took over the office of Coroner on March 2, 1981. In 1978, he was elected chairman of the Allegheny County Democratic Party. One year later, Wecht was elected to the Allegheny County Board of Commissioners. In 1982, he was the Democratic party's nominee to oppose freshman Senator John Heinz in bid for a second term; Heinz won the election with 59 percent of the vote.Barone, Michael; and Ujifusa, Grant. The Almanac of American Politics 1988, p. 1006. National Journal, 1987. Wecht and fellow Democratic County Commissioner Tom Foerster were frequently at odds, and battled for control of the Democratic Party in Allegheny County, which Wecht chaired. Although the Democratic Committee rejected Foerster and endorsed Wecht for re-election as commissioner in 1983, the committee paired him with Sheriff Gene Coon, with whom he also had a longstanding political feud. Foerster teamed up with former Pittsburgh Mayor Pete Flaherty, and the two defeated Wecht and Coon in the primary election for the two Democratic nominations. Wecht then lost the chairmanship of the county's Democratic Party in 1984 to Foerster's hand- picked candidate, Scott Township Tax Collector Ed Stevens. Wecht then sought to become chair of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party that same year, but was defeated by Ed Mezvinsky, a former Congressman from Iowa. =Later years (1995‚Äì2006)= In 1995, Wecht, after 12 years out of public life, was again elected as Allegheny County's Coroner. In 1999, he ran for the newly created position of Allegheny County Chief Executive, defeating one-term minority County Commissioner Mike Dawida in the Democratic primary, but losing to prominent Republican businessman Jim Roddey in his first bid for elective public office. While serving as the county's coroner, Wecht continued to operate a private forensic consulting business on the side known as Wecht Pathology Associates. Wecht Pathology Associates charges clients for examining cases, conducting autopsies, and testifying in civil and criminal trials. In his official capacity as county coroner, Wecht continued to squabble with DA Zappala, often over deaths that took place during encounters with police. In the case that is the precursor to Wecht's federal prosecution, US vs. Wecht, Wecht ruled that Charles Dixon had been suffocated through positional asphyxiation during a 2002 encounter with police officers from Mount Oliver and Pittsburgh. When Wecht ruled the death of Dixon a homicide, DA Zappala refused to press charges against the officers. In response, Wecht, acting in his private capacity as an employee of Wecht Pathology Associates, wrote a medical opinion outlining the officers' alleged role in Dixon's death which was utilized by Dixon's family in a civil suit against the county. In response to Wecht's testimony in the Dixon case, Zappala accused Wecht of violating the federal Hobbs Act, which prohibits public officials from using their offices for private gain. In early 2005, Zappala launched an investigation into whether Wecht had been using county resources to carry out private work ‚Äî allegations similar to those Wecht had faced before. By spring of 2005, FBI agents were seizing documents in Wecht's private and county offices. Wecht continued to serve as Coroner until the position was eliminated in 2006. County Executive Dan Onorato named him as the county's first appointed Medical Examiner in 2006. By January 2006, a federal grand jury had indicted Wecht on 84 criminal counts, prompting Wecht to step down from his county post per an agreement he made when the investigation became public in 2004 that if indicted he would resign as county coroner. Court cases =Allegheny County criminal trial (1979‚Äì1981)= Wecht's tenure as Allegheny County Coroner was controversial. While he was responsible for significant upgrades in the professionalism and technology of the coroner's office during his service in that office from 1970 to 1980, making the Allegheny County Coroner's office one of the best in the nation, Wecht's political career proved controversial due to his opinionated nature and as he put it his unwillingness to \\"run away from a fight.\\" In 1979 Wecht was accused of performing autopsies for other counties at the county morgue and depositing the fees from these autopsies in his private business's bank account. Wecht responded that the funds in question had been used solely to upgrade the office and staff. After a long investigation, Wecht was indicted on multiple criminal counts that charged Wecht with personally profiting from work at the coroner's office. Wecht allegedly transacted approximately $400,000 of his private business work using county facilities and the county morgue. In spring 1981, the six-week-long criminal trial began. All charges were dismissed except for one, theft of services. Wecht was acquitted on the remaining charge. The original judge at trial was censured by a judge's panel and some findings vacated due to judicial misconduct. Wecht's attorneys alleged that he was a victim of a political conspiracy. =Allegheny County civil trial= Although Wecht was acquitted in the criminal case, the County Controller levied a civil surcharge of $390,000 against him for mingling private and public work at the morgue. In 1983, a civil court ruled that Wecht owed the county $172,410. On appeal, the original award to the county was increased to $250,000. In 1992, the county and Wecht reached a settlement resulting in Wecht having to repay the county $200,000. =Federal criminal trial= On January 28, 2008, a federal trial against Wecht began, on charges of public corruption. Roughly two weeks prior to the trial, 43 of the 84 counts against Wecht were withdrawn; judge Arthur J. Schwab dismissed those charges with prejudice. Following trial the jury could not reach agreement on the remaining counts, and the judge declared a mistrial. The prosecution immediately announced that they planned to retry Wecht. Concerns were raised about the motivation and conduct of the prosecution before and after the trial. Speculation arose that the prosecution of Wecht was politically motivated. Former Attorney General and Governor of Pennsylvania Dick Thornburgh, a defense lawyer for Wecht, testified before a House panel investigating the US Attorneys' Firing Scandal that Wecht was targeted politically. Congressmen Mike Doyle (whose district includes Pittsburgh) and John Conyers questioned the prosecution's tactics in the aftermath of the first trial and instituted Congressional hearings on the matter. Op-eds in The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review called for dismissal of the proposed re- trial. On April 12, 2008, 33 prominent leaders in the Pittsburgh community sent a letter to Attorney General Michael Mukasey and US Attorney Mary Beth Buchanan requesting that the prosecution dismiss the indictment against Wecht. Shortly after the press release of this letter, Senator Arlen Specter publicly recommended against a retrial for Wecht. Former jurors stated to the press that they believed that the prosecution had been politically motivated. On May 5, 2008, the Department of Justice's Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) revealed that it initiated an investigation into the Wecht prosecution due to claims that the case was a \\"selective prosecution\\". On May 14, 2009, a new trial judge in the retrial excluded most of the evidence against Wecht because it was seized under an illegal and improperly executed search warrant. On June 2, 2009, Buchanan announced that her office would file a motion to dismiss all charges against Wecht. Personal life In October 1961, Wecht married Sigrid Ronsdal; they have four children together, including David Wecht. On May 16, 2020, Wecht promoted a less reactive and restrictive response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In popular media Wecht was portrayed by Albert Brooks in the 2015 film Concussion. In the film, Wecht was a staunch supporter of Bennet Omalu's efforts to expose the link between concussions and football.

Schaffer was co-chairman of the Congressional Ukrainian Caucus, and an outspoken leader in promoting American interests and human rights in Eastern Europe. Schaffer is currently Headmaster of Liberty Common High School in Fort Collins, Colorado. Under Schaffer's leadership, two classes have broken the state's all-time record composite ACT and SAT scores, respectively. In 2004, Schaffer lost in the primary election to be the Republican nominee for a U.S. Senate seat. He was the Republican nominee for Colorado's other Senate seat in the 2008 election, which he lost to Democratic nominee Mark Udall. Biography =Early years= Schaffer was born in Cincinnati, Ohio and raised Catholic. He attended Archbishop Moeller High School. The son of public-school teachers, Schaffer worked his way through college as a farm hand. In 1984, he graduated from the University of Dayton with a B.A. in Political Science. He was later awarded an honorary doctorate in Management from Colorado Technical University. Colorado State Senator Schaffer served for nine years as a Colorado State Senator in the Colorado General Assembly. Schaffer was only 25 years old in 1987 when he was appointed to finish Colorado State Senator Jim Beatty's term, making Schaffer the youngest to serve in Colorado's Senate. As a Colorado Senator, he was Chairman of the Finance Committee, the State Veterans and Military Affairs Committee, and the Local Government Committee. Schaffer also was the Vice-Chairman of the Senate Education Committee. Schaffer was awarded the \\"National Republican Legislator of the Year for 1995\\" by the National Republican Legislators Association. In 1993, Schaffer made headlines when he removed a display from the Capitol‚Äîthat was in clear view of visiting children‚Äîthat contained pamphlets describing \\"unsafe sexual practices.\\" U.S. Congressman Schaffer was first elected to the U.S. Congress in November 1996 representing Colorado's 4th congressional district, succeeding Wayne Allard and Hank Brown. Schaffer served three terms in Congress, fulfilling the three-term pledge he made during his first Congressional campaign. Schaffer upheld his pledge in spite of pleas from national Republicans and President George W. Bush to run for another term. Schaffer lead no less than four congressional delegations to Ukraine, and offered an ultimately unsuccessful balanced budget resolution and amendment. He was described as fiscally and socially conservative and to the right of the center of the party. His education policy work focused on school-choice and local control, and Schaffer was remembered for being able to help his Republican colleagues form their arguments when debating this issue. He was succeeded by Marilyn Musgrave in January 2003. His congressional colleagues recount his tenure in congress as an education-policy expert. Schaffer is of Ukrainian heritage, the son of a Ukrainian immigrant to the United States. He has received multiple recognitions for his advocacy of Ukraine‚ÄìUnited States relations, and for defense of Ukraine's territorial integrity under the 1994 Budapest Memorandum. Schaffer was co-founder and co-chair of the Congressional Ukrainian Caucus. Schaffer served as an election observer in Ukraine during parliamentary election 2002 and presidential election 2004 (‚ÄúOrange Revolution‚Äù). The American Conservative Union gave him a 100% evaluation in 2001. Post-2002 career =Liberty Common High School= In 2010, Schaffer was appointed principal of Liberty Common High School, a college-preparatory charter school in the Poudre School District in Fort Collins, Colorado. During his time at Liberty Common, the first four graduating classes posted the highest average composite ACT score in Colorado, with the class of 2015 breaking the state record. In 2017, Schaffer was appointed headmaster of both Liberty Common High School and Liberty Common School, its elementary counterpart. Controversy In May 2019, Liberty Common High School banned four seniors from attending graduation. The seniors had bought a box of 25 condoms and distributed them in lockers across the school; they claimed this action was a statement against Schaffer's criticism of Colorado House Bill 19-1032, which would mandate comprehensive sex education in Colorado schools. Schaffer condemned the distribution of condoms as \\"sexual bullying.\\" The incident was covered in statewide news and generated minor controversy online about the seriousness of the condom distribution. In 2019, Liberty Common High School was granted a waiver from the sex education bill. =Energy Industry= Schaffer was vice-president for business development at Aspect Energy, LLC., where he was involved in a variety of energy, mining and education projects, working primarily in wind energy. He was also a board member on the National Alternative Fuels Foundation, but environmental groups released attack ads during the 2008 U.S. Senate race highlighting Shcaffer's congressional vote which gave $2.5 billion to alternative energy research and a much larger amount to traditional energy research and tax credits. =Board Member= Schaffer served as president of the Parental Alliance for Choice in Education, a non-profit corporation promoting school choice reform in Colorado's public education system, and is active in the state's transformation to a market-driven education system. Leadership Program of the Rockies Schaffer has been chairman of the Leadership Program of the Rockies, a nonprofit corporation that provides economic education and civic- leadership training in Colorado. Schaffer is a regular columnist for the Fort Collins Coloradoan daily newspaper. Schaffer was also an opinion columnist for the now-defunct Northern Colorado Courier. Colorado League of Charter Schools Since 2003, Schaffer has been chairman of Leadership Program of the Rockies, a nonprofit organization providing economic education and civic- leadership training in Colorado. Republican National Committee In March 2005, Schaffer was elected Republican National Committeeman for Colorado. Colorado State Board of Education Schaffer was appointed to fill a vacancy on the Colorado State Board of Education by a party vacancy committee, representing a district that is coterminous with the state's Fourth Congressional District. He successfully ran for the seat in 2006, against Democrat Tom Griggs. In January, 2009, Schaffer was made chairman of the Colorado State Board of Education with a unanimous decision of the four Republican and three Democratic board members. Fellow board members elected Schaffer to continue his chairmanship in 2011. As Chairman of the Colorado State Board of Education, Schaffer borrowed ideas from Singapore and Finland when working to create new forward-thinking standards that are both internationally benchmarked and designed to grow students‚Äô strategic thinking capabilities over fact memorization. Citing the importance of letting parents know if someone proximal to their children has been arrested, Schaffer took a leadership role in the effort to require parent notification if a school employee is arrested or charged with a serious crime. The measure went into effect in April 2011 despite strong opposition from the Colorado Education Association, the state-based teachers' unions. Schaffer maintained the position throughout the debating of the measure that parents are in the best position to make decisions about their children's safety. He voted against adopting Common Core standards, but the federal standards passed on a 4-3 vote. Adopting the standards were a keystone factor to the Colorado's application for $175 million in Race to the Top funds. In early 2011, Schaffer took heat from Democratic State Board of Education member Mary Johnson. The disagreement was over Schaffer's inviting William Maloney, Colorado education commissioner under both parties from 1997 to 2007, who spoke on ‚Äúthree incontestable realities concerning which America has been in denial for decades,‚Äù regarding America's education performance on a global scale, the unsustainable costs of education, and the availability of better models for the path forward. Under Schaffer's chairmanship tenure, unanimous charter school guidelines were adopted. The new concrete rules adopted best practices for charter school authorization. Other He is the Colorado Chairman of the Judicial Confirmation Network. In 2006, Schaffer founded Dreamsoft Colorado, LLC, a firm that creates high-end interactive websites for business and political clients. He is also the President of AMDG LLC. As a member of the Fort Collins, Colorado community, he owned a small business. 2004 U.S. Senate race In 2004, Schaffer contended for the Republican nomination to the U.S. Senate after incumbent Republican Ben Nighthorse Campbell chose not to run for re-election. Brewing magnate Pete Coors opposed Schaffer. Coors entered the bitter primary battle after Schaffer faced down potential contenders such as David Liniger, founder of ReMax. The nomination battle concluded when Coors won the Republican nomination over Schaffer with 61% of the vote. Coors went on to lose to Democratic nominee Ken Salazar in the 2004 general election. 2008 U.S. Senate election Schaffer's Jefferson County field office in 2008 Schaffer was the Republican nominee for the open seat of retiring Senator Wayne Allard. He lost to Mark Udall, the Democratic nominee. On May 9, 2007, Schaffer filed his official statement of candidacy with the Federal Elections Commission. On May 12, 2007, he made an official announcement in Boulder that he would run for the Senate to a group of over 150 Republicans attending a fundraising event. On September 28, 2008, Udall and Schaffer appeared on Meet the Press's Senate Debate series, discussing the proposed bailout of the U.S. financial system. =Political opposition= In 2008, the League of Conservation Voters named Schaffer a member of its \\"Dirty Dozen\\" because of an anti-environmental record during his tenure in Congress. In 2001, then-congressman Schaffer voted for President Bush's energy plan that Democrats argued was a $33 billion gift to the oil corporations. Republicans argued that the bill would help reduce America's dependence on foreign oil. =Endorsements= * Grand Junction Daily Sentinel on October 9, 2008 * The Pueblo Chieftain on October 17, 2008 Link to the Jack Abramoff Scandals Schaffer was allegedly linked to the Mariana Islands worker abuse scandal by his association with the Traditional Values Coalition. The organization was used by Jack Abramoff to pay for the trip of the then-Congressman to visit the island. The Denver Post reported that the TVC paid the $13,000 travel bill for the trip, organized by Abramoff's lobbying firm. Schaffer criticized the Denver Post's reporting, asserting that he had no contact with the individuals in the report, including Jack Abramoff. Schaffer claimed that he spoke with local clergy who denied there was a problem of forced abortions in the Northern Marianas, the only area of the United States where abortion is banned by their local constitution. After his return from the islands, Schaffer used his position on the Resources Committee to attack reports of abuses on the islands.

It was first published in 16 BC in five books, but Ovid, by his own account, later edited it down into the three-book edition that survives today. The book follows the popular model of the erotic elegy, as made famous by figures such as Tibullus or Propertius, but is often subversive and humorous with these tropes, exaggerating common motifs and devices to the point of absurdity. While several literary scholars have called the Amores a major contribution to Latin love elegy, they are not generally considered among Ovid's finest works and \\"are most often dealt with summarily in a prologue to a fuller discussion of one of the other works\\". History Speculations as to Corinna's real identity are many, if indeed she lived at all. It has been argued that she is a poetic construct copying the puella-archetype from other works in the love elegy genre. The name Corinna may have been a typically Ovidian pun based on the Greek word for \\"maiden\\", \\"kore\\". Though most of this book is rather tongue-in-cheek, some people didn't take it that way and this could be the reason or part of the reason why Ovid was banished from Rome. However, his banishment probably has more to do with the Ars Amatoria, written later, which offended Augustus. There is also a connection between Ovid and Augustus' daughter, Julia, who was also exiled. Summary The Amores is a poetic first person account of the poetic persona's love affair with an unattainable higher class girl, Corinna. It is not always clear if the author is writing about Corinna or a generic puella. Ovid does not assume a single woman as a subject of a chronical obsession of the persona of lover. The plot is linear, with a few artistic digressions such as an elegy on the death of Tibullus. =Book 1= *1.1 - The poet announces that love will be his theme. *1.2 - He admits defeat to Cupid. *1.3 - He addresses his lover for the first time and lists his good qualities, *1.4 - He attends a dinner party; the poem is mostly a list of secret instructions to his lover, who is also attending the party along with her husband. *1.5 - He describes a visit Corinna, here named for the first time, makes to his rooms. *1.6 - He begs the doorkeeper to let him into the house to see his love. *1.7 - He hits his lover and is remorseful. *1.8 - Mostly a monologue from Dipsas, a tipsy procurer, to a young lady about how to deceive rich men. This is the longest poem in the book. *1.9 - The poet compares lovers with soldiers. *1.10 - He complains that his mistress is demanding material gifts, instead of the gift of poetry. *1.11 - He asks Corinna's maid to take a message to her. *1.12 - The poet responds angrily when Corinna cannot visit. *1.13 - He addresses the dawn and asks it to wait, so he can stay longer with his mistress. *1.14 - He mocks Corinna for ruining her hair by dyeing it. *1.15 - The book ends with Ovid writing of the famous poets of the past, and claiming his name will be among them. The book has a ring arrangement, with the first and last poems concerning poetry itself, and 1.2 and 1.9 both contain developed military metaphors. =Book 2= * 2.1: The poet describes the sort of audience that he desires. * 2.2: The poet asks Bagoas, a woman's servant, to help him gain access to his mistress. * 2.3: The poet addresses a eunuch (probably Bagoas from 2.2) who is preventing him from seeing a woman. * 2.4: The poet describes his love for women of all sorts. * 2.5: The poet addresses his lover, whom he has seen being unfaithful at a dinner party. * 2.6: The poet mourns the death of Corinna's parrot. * 2.7: The poet defends himself to his mistress, who is accusing him of sleeping with her handmaiden Cypassis. * 2.8: The poet addresses Cypassis, asking her to keep their affair a secret from her mistress. * 2.9a: The poet rebukes Cupid for causing him so much pain in love. * 2.9b: The poet professes his addiction to love. * 2.10: The poet relates how he loves two girls at once, in spite of Graecinus' assertion that it was impossible. * 2.13: The poet prays to the gods about Corinna's abortion. * 2.14: The poet condemns the act of abortion. =Book 3= * 3.1 - Ovid imagines being confronted by the personified 'Elegy' and 'Tragedy', who start to argue since Tragedy believes Ovid never stops writing elegies. Elegy responds by arguing her case, responding sarcastically to Tragedy that she should \\"take a lighter tone\\" and points out she is even using her (elegiac) metre to lament. Elegy seems to be victorious. * 3.2 - Ovid woos a girl at the races, despite perhaps only just having met her. Ovid seems to be very desperate - as shown by quickly making his move. The reader is left unsure whether his advances were truly accepted or whether Ovid (chooses to?) misinterpret the girl's rejections. * 3.3 - Ovid laments that his lover has not been punished for lying. He blames the gods for allowing beautiful women \\"excessive liberties\\" and for punishing and fighting against men. However, he then states that men need to \\"show more spirit\\" and if he was a god, he would do the same as them, with respect to beautiful women. * 3.4 - Ovid warns a man about trying to guard his lover from adultery. He justifies this through a commentary on forbidden love and its allure. * 3.5 - Ovid has a dream about a white cow that has a black mark. The dream symbolises an adulterous woman who now has been forever stained by the mark of adultery. * 3.6 - Ovid describes a river preventing him from seeing his lover. He compares then compares it to other rivers in Graeco-Roman mythology, and their associated myths such as the Inachos and the Asopus. * 3.7 - Ovid complains of his erectile dysfunction. * 3.8 - Ovid laments over his lover's avarice, complaining that poetry and the arts are now worth less than gold. * 3.9 - An elegy for the dead Tibullus. * 3.10 - The Festival of Ceres prevents Ovid from making love to his mistress. Characteristically of Ovid, he complains he should not be held responsible for the gods' mistakes. * 3.11a - Ovid has freed himself from the shackles of his lover. He is ashamed of what he did for her and his embarrassment in standing outside her door. She exploited him, therefore he has ended it. * 3.11b - The poet is conflicted. He loves and lusts after his lover but acknowledges her evil deeds and betrayals. He wishes she were less attractive so he can more easily escape her grasp. * 3.12 - Ovid laments that his poetry has attracted others to his lover. He questions why his descriptions of Corinna were interpreted so literally, when poets sing of stories of fiction or, at least, embellished fact. He stresses the importance of this poetic licence. * 3.13 - Ovid describes the Festival of Juno, which is taking place in the town of his wife's birth, Falsica (Falerii), and its origins. He finishes the poem hoping Juno will favour both him and the townspeople. * 3.14 - Ovid instructs his partner to not tell him about her affairs. Instead, although he knows he cannot keep her to himself, he wants her to deceive him so that he can pretend not to notice. * 3.15 - Ovid bids farewell to love elegy. Style and themes =Love elegy= Ovid's Amores are firmly set in the genre of love elegy. The elegiac couplet was used first by the Greeks, originally for funeral epigrams, but it came to be associated with erotic poetry.William Turpin, \\"The Amores\\". Dickinson College Commentaries Love elegy as a genre was fashionable in Augustan times.Roman, L., & Roman, M. (2010). Familiar themes include: * Poem featuring the poet locked out of his mistress's door. * Comparisons between the poet's life of leisure and respectable Roman careers, such as farming, politics, or the military. It has been regularly praised for adapting and improving on these older models with humour. =Use of allusions= The poems contain many allusions to other works of literature beyond love elegy. =The poet and his immortality= Poems 1.1 and 1.15 in particular both concern the way poetry makes the poet immortal, while one of his offers to a lover in 1.3 is that their names will be joined in poetry and famous forever. =Use of humour= Ovid's love elegies stand apart from others in the genre by his use of humour. =Love and war= Amores I.1 begins with the same word as the Aeneid, \\"Arma\\" (an intentional comparison to the epic genre, which Ovid later mocks), as the poet describes his original intention: to write an epic poem in dactylic hexameter, \\"with material suiting the meter\\" (line 2), that is, war. However, Cupid \\"steals one (metrical) foot\\" (unum suripuisse pedem, I.1 ln 4), turning it into elegiac couplets, the meter of love poetry. Ovid returns to the theme of war several times throughout the Amores, especially in poem nine of Book I, an extended metaphor comparing soldiers and lovers (Militat omnis amans, \\"every lover is a soldier\\" I.9 ln 1). Influence and reception =Other Roman authors= Ovid's popularity has remained strong to the present day. After his banishment in 8 AD, Augustus ordered Ovid's works removed from libraries and destroyed, but that seems to have had little effect on his popularity. He was always \\"among the most widely read and imitated of Latin poets. Reynolds, L.D.; Wilson, N.G. Texts and Transmission: A Survey of the Latin Classics. 1984. p. 257 Examples of Roman authors who followed Ovid include Martial, Lucan, and Statius.Robathan, p. 191 =Post-classical era= The majority of Latin works have been lost, with very few texts rediscovered after the Dark Ages and preserved to the present day. However in the case of Amores, there are so many manuscript copies from the 12th and 13th centuries that many are ‚Äútextually worthless‚Äù, copying too closely from one another, and containing mistakes caused by familiarity.Propertius, T. Benediktson. Modernist Poet of Antiquity. 1989: SIU Press 1989. pp. 2-3 Theodulph of Orleans lists Ovid with Virgil among other favourite Christian writers, while Nigellus compared Ovid's exile to the banishment of St. John, and imprisonment of Saint Peter.Robathan, D. \\"Ovid in the Middle Ages\\", in Binns, J. W. (Ed.) Ovid. London, 1973: Routledge & K. Paul. p. 192 Later in the 11th century, Ovid was the favourite poet of Abbot (and later Bishop) Baudry, who wrote imitation elegies to a nun - albeit about Platonic love.Wilkinson, L.P. Ovid Recalled. 1955: Duckworth. p. 377 Others used his poems to demonstrate allegories or moral lessons, such as the 1340 Ovid Moralis√© which was translated with extensive commentary on the supposed moral meaning of the Amores.Wilkinson, p. 384 Wilkinson also credits Ovid with directly contributing around 200 lines to the classic courtly love tale Roman de la Rose.Wilkinson, p. 392 Christopher Marlowe wrote a famous verse translation in English.

The district's current Representative is Roger Williams. 21st century redistrictings For the 2004 elections, it had an elongated shape stretching from deep south Texas at the U.S.-Mexico border to Austin (informally known as \\"the fajita strip\\") as a result of mid-decade 2003 gerrymandering of Texas congressional districts. The district was redrawn again for the 2006 elections as the result of a lawsuit (see below). In July 2011, Texas Governor Rick Perry signed into law a redistricting plan (\\"C185\\"), approved by the Texas legislature in June, which gave the 25th district a completely different geography for the 2012 elections, including part of Travis County, and stretching north as far as southern Tarrant County near Fort Worth. The redistricting split Travis County into five districts, four of which were heavily Republican. As a result, the only realistic place for Representative Lloyd Doggett to run was the new 35th district (which by weight of population is more of a San Antonio district than an Austin district).

The main basis for the ruling was that the old 23rd was a protected majority-Hispanic district‚Äîin other words, if the 23rd was redrawn in a way to put Hispanics in a minority, a new majority-Hispanic district had to be created. Since the 25th was not compact enough to be an acceptable replacement, the 23rd had to be struck down. The size of the 23rd required the redrawing of nearly every district from El Paso to San Antonio. As a result, on August 4, 2006, a three-judge panel announced replacement district boundaries for 2006 election for the 23rd district, as well as for the 15th, 21st, 25th and 28th districts. On election day in November, these five districts held open primaries; if any candidate received over 50%, they were elected. Otherwise, a runoff election in December decided the seat. The redrawn 25th was more compact and restricted to Central Texas, comprising more of Travis County, most of Bastrop County, and all of Hays, Caldwell, Fayette, Gonzales, Lavaca, and Colorado Counties. Incumbent congressman Doggett faced Republican Grant Rostig (formerly the Libertarian nominee), independent candidate Brian Parrett, and Libertarian Party Barbara Cunningham, and won re- election. =2008 election= In the 2008 election Doggett faced Republican George Morovich, a structural engineer from La Grange and Libertarian Jim Stutsman, a retired Army veteran.

On March 18, 1999, CSN hired its first baseball coach‚Äîlocal legend Rodger Fairless, who coached former MLB pitchers Greg Maddux and Mike Maddux at Valley High School during the 1980s, and was more well known for coaching Green Valley High School to six consecutive Nevada state baseball championships from 1993-98. But, before Fairless would even conduct his first baseball practice at CSN, he stepped down on May 4, 1999, citing health reasons. Fairless would be replaced by another local veteran coach, Tim Chambers, on July 8, 1999. The Coyotes played their first- ever game on February 1, 2000, against Scottsdale Community College, and quickly grew into a perennial contender. They joined the Scenic West Athletic Conference in 2002, quickly asserting themselves a place in the conference, becoming rivals with Dixie State College until the Trailblazers moved up to NCAA Division II in 2006. Since joining the SWAC, CSN has won six conference championships, two Region XVIII championships and two Western District championships. Today, the Coyotes' rivals are the Western Nevada Wildcats, as they are the only two junior colleges in Nevada to have intercollegiate athletics, and also fueled by their fierce battles on the diamond. On May 31, 2003, the Coyotes made history, defeating the heavily favored San Jacinto- North Gators 4-1 to win the 2003 National Junior College World Series in only their fourth year of existence. It is CSN's only national championship in any sport to date. In 2010, catcher Bryce Harper was selected first overall by the Washington Nationals in the Major League Baseball First Year Player Draft after a season in which he batted .443/.526/.987 (AVG/OBP/SLG) with 98 runs scored, 31 home runs, 98 RBIs, 20 SBs, and a 1.510 OPS, leading the team to a third-place finish at the National Junior College World Series. He was selected as an outfielder. On June 11, 2010, just one week after the Coyotes had been eliminated from the JUCO World Series, longtime head coach Tim Chambers took the head coaching job at UNLV. There would be no vacancy for long though, as CSN hired former Bishop Gorman High School baseball coach Chris Sheff on July 9, 2010, to carry on the legacy that Chambers built. Sheff would become the second baseball coach in CSN history to never coach a game. Allegations of illegal activity in the eyes of the NJCAA and parents alike came up, and on November 3, 2010, the school decided to relieve Sheff of his duties. Six days later, on November 9, 2010, CSN hired former Green Valley High School coach Nick Garritano as its head baseball coach. Garritano, who was Fairless' successor at Green Valley, won two state championships during his 12 years at the helm, producing a 315-118-1 record. He played sports at Chaparral High School and was inducted into the UNLV Hall of Fame as a former place-kicker for the football team. On May 5, 2012, the baseball clubhouse was officially named after James B. Whiteaker in a dedication ceremony that took place prior to the final baseball game of the regular season. Today, \\"Building D\\" is now known as the James B. Whiteaker Clubhouse. =Recent highlights= 2015 Coyotes Baseball was an exciting year of competition. The Coyotes sported RHP ‚Äì Phil Bickford (2015-drafted to SF Giants), SS ‚Äì Tyler Brown (2015 ‚Äì drafted to SF Giants), and OF-Matthew Waldren, who was a 2015 NJCAA Superior Academic-All-American. Coyotes Athletic Programs pride themselves on maintaining very high individual and team academic standards. Student-athletes at the College of Southern Nevada regularly attend and accomplish 17‚Äì21 credits per semester, averaging individual GPAs as high as 3.9. =Women's volleyball= Fall 2015 was the inaugural season hosting Women's Volleyball. =Men/women's soccer= The College of Southern Nevada now houses Men's and Women's Division I Soccer; their first season was Fall of 2016. Men's soccer is Coached by Geoffrey Hawkins, Esq., Christopher Burgess, and Julian Portugal. In their first season of competition they made their way to the 2016 NJCAA DIV. I, Men's Soccer Championship in Tyler, TX. They were defeated by #2 ranked Monroe College. Women's soccer adopted Head Coach Rob Dahl of Utah to lead them to victory. Rob is a championship collegiate-level ladies soccer coach and is planning for the ladies to head for the Finals during his first year of 2017. The ladies are mixed with local Las Vegas and Utah talents.

The Coyotes' home field is located at the Russell Road Recreation Complex, a park operated by the City of Henderson. Talks are in the works to build a softball stadium on the CSN Henderson campus, adjacent to the baseball stadium, with funding being its major obstacle. The program's first coach was Ric Grenell, who previously had coached women's soccer at CSN from 2000-02 before the sport was discontinued. After a moderate first season record of 16-30, the 2005 softball team did less well, winning only six games. Shortly after the 2006 season began, another rough start prompted Grenell to resign, and Ysidro Jimenez took over as interim head coach. Jimenez would become the permanent head coach at season's end, and remained the head coach until June 2011. Under Jimenez, CSN softball enjoyed five winning seasons from 2007‚Äì11, including a record 38 wins in the 2011 season. But, after failing to win a conference or region championship, then-assistant coach and former longtime Hawaii-Hilo softball coach Callen Perreira was announced as Jimenez's replacement, and officially took over the helm on July 1, 2011. In Spring of 2017, CSN welcomed the addition of the new Lady Coyotes Softball Complex at the Henderson Campus. Softball also welcomed Head Coach Jim Overturf and Olympian Lori Harrigan-Mack.

Development Electrochemical reactions occur in electrolytic solutions--for example electroplating, etching, batteries, and so on. On the electrode surface, many atoms, molecules, and ions adsorb and affect the reactions. In the past, in order to obtain information about the structure of electrode surfaces and reactions, the sample electrode was taken out of the electrolytic solution and measured under ultra high vacuum (UHV) conditions. In this case, the structure of the surface changed and could not be observed precisely. By using this microscope, however, these problems are resolved. Operation In electrolytic solutions, a complicated electrical double layer of H2O molecules and anions is formed. In this layer, as the distribution of anions changes with the potential of the electrode, it is necessary to control the reaction on the electrode. The potentials of the working electrodes (the sample and the tip) are controlled independently against a reference electrode. In this case, the tunneling bias voltage is the difference between the two potentials. A counter electrode is used to complete the current- carrying circuits with the working electrodes. By using these four electrodes, the electrochemical reaction is controlled precisely by the external voltage, and the surface in liquid can be observed.

The business model of GameFly is similar to the DVD-by-mail subscription service Netflix and Blockbuster online. In 2009 GameFly sued the U.S. Postal Service alleging the favoring of Netflix and Blockbuster by sorting their DVDs at no charge.Postal Service must stop favoring Netflix DVDs over GameFly ones, says appeals court GameFly sends games to subscribers for a monthly fee. Over 8,000 titles are available. In May 2018, Electronic Arts announced that they acquired cloud gaming technology assets and personnel from GameFly (including its Israeli outpost). GameFly is currently owned by the same ownership group as Alliance Entertainment and is operated as a stand-alone company. History In May 2002, Sean Spector and Jung Suh partnered with founding CEO Toby Lenk to start GameFly. GameFly later received venture capital funding from Sequoia Capital. In February 2009, GameFly acquired the gaming news and community site Shacknews, along with its download and streaming video sites. It was reported in February 2011 that GameFly had acquired MobyGames. Despite filing plans in February 2010 for an initial public offering, GameFly remains a privately owned company as of 2017. GameFly shut down the streaming service on August 31, 2018.  Purchase of Direct2Drive  In 2011, Gamefly announced that they had acquired Direct2Drive, an online distribution service previously owned by IGN. Direct2Drive later merged with GameFly; subscribers that had both D2D and GameFly accounts were migrated to a single account. Shortly after the merger, GameFly introduced a new \\"GameFly Client\\", which combined the services previously offered by Direct2Drive and GameFly individually; the client came out of beta on November 8, 2012, and allows direct download and installation of PC games, as well as the rental of games without visiting the GameFly website itself. As of April 2014, GameFly has since sold Direct2Drive to AtGames.

It was formerly the Industrial Institute and College for the Education of White Girls and later the Mississippi State College for Women. Men have been admitted to MUW since 1982 and now make up about 20% of the student body.  History  Upon its establishment in 1884, Mississippi University for Women became the first public women's college in the United States. Then formally titled the Industrial Institute and College for the Education of White Girls, the institution was created by an act of the Mississippi Legislature on March 12, 1884, for the dual purposes of providing a liberal arts education for women and preparing them for employment. The first session began October 22, 1885, with an enrollment of approximately 250 students on a campus formerly occupied by the Columbus Female Institute, a private college founded in 1847. Richard Jones was selected by the State Institutions of Higher Learning board of trustees as the university's first president. The name of the institution changed to Mississippi State College for Women in 1920 to reflect an emphasis on collegiate, rather than vocational, education. In 1966, three local women from Hunt High School became the first black undergraduates at MUW. They lived off campus, as the dormitories remained segregated until 1968. At the same time, three teachers from Hunt became the first graduate students at the school. The students were known collectively as The Fabulous Six. In 1971 Mississippi State College for Women won the intercollegiate women's basketball national championship (the third ever held). In 1974 the name was changed to the Mississippi University for Women to reflect the expanded academic programs, including graduate studies. All other Mississippi state colleges were also designated universities at this time. In 1982, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the case of Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan that the nursing school's single- sex admissions policies were in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Following this decision, the Board of Trustees of State Institutions of Higher Learning ordered the university to change its policies to allow the admission of qualified males into all university programs. In 1988, the Board of Trustees reaffirmed the mission of MUW as an institution providing quality academic programs for all qualified students, with emphasis on distinctive opportunities for women. In a 1997 article in Innovative Higher Education, the journalist Dale Thorn describes MUW's successful attempt to avoid a merger with another institution and to remain a separate entity. In 2009, President Dr. Claudia Limbert announced the possibility of changing the university's name to \\"Reneau University\\". The Mississippi State legislature did not approve the change. As of 2018, U.S. News & World Report ranked The W 11th as a best value among public Southern regional universities and tied at 20th among best public regional universities in the South. The W also appeared in U.S. News‚Äô Best Colleges for Veterans in Southern regional universities at No. 40. On February 1, 2019, Nora Roberts Miller, was inaugurated as the first alumna president of Mississippi University for Women. She was named the 15th president on September 15, 2018 by the State Institutions of Higher Learning board of trustees.  Notable alumni  Notable MUW alumni include: * Tina Renee Johns Benkiser, chairman of the Republican Party of Texas, 2003‚Äì2009 * Dorothy Vredenburgh Bush, secretary of the Democratic National Committee (1944‚Äì1989) and the youngest person and first woman to be elected as an officer of either the Democratic or Republican party * Helen Carloss, first woman to argue a case before all of the United States courts of appeals * Kay Beevers Cobb, Mississippi Supreme Court Justice, retired * Chris Fryar, musician, drummer of Zac Brown Band * Susan Golden, National Academy of Sciences member and Professor of Molecular Biology at University of California, San Diego * Laverne Greene-Leech, one of three African-American students to desegregate Mississippi State College for Women (now MUW) in 1966 * Elizabeth Lee Hazen, co-discoverer of nystatin * Valerie Jaudon, artist * Lenore Prather, first female Mississippi Supreme Court Justice * Toni Seawright, first African-American Miss Mississippi (1987) and 4th runner-up to Miss America that same year * Doris Taylor, scientist known for achievements in stem cell research * Eudora Welty, Pulitzer Prize-winning author * Elizabeth H.

Post-lingual hearing impairments are far more common than prelingual deafness. Typically, hearing loss is gradual, and often detected by family and friends of the people so affected long before the patients themselves will acknowledge the disability. Causes In some cases, the loss is extremely sudden and can be traced to specific diseases, such as meningitis, or to ototoxic medications, such as Gentamicin. In both cases, the final degree of loss varies. Some experience only partial loss, while others become profoundly deaf. Hearing aids and cochlear implants may be used to regain a sense of hearing, with different people experiencing differing degrees of success. It is possible that the affected person may need to rely on speechreading and/or sign language for communication. In most cases the loss is a long term degradation in hearing loss. Discrediting earlier notions of presbycusis, Rosen demonstrated that long term hearing loss is usually the product of chronic exposure to environmental noise in industrialized countries (Rosen, 1965). The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has asserted the same sentiment and testified before the U.S. Congress that approximately 34 million Americans are exposed to noise pollution levels (mostly from roadway and aircraft noise) that expose humans to noise health effects including the risk of hearing loss (EPA, 1972). Certain genetic conditions can also lead to post-lingual deafness. In contrast to genetic causes of pre-lingual deafness, which are frequently autosomal recessive, genetic causes of post-lingual deafness tend to be autosomal dominant. Treatment In cases where the causes are environmental, the treatment is to eliminate or reduce these causes first of all, and then to fit patients with a hearing aid, especially if they are elderly. When the loss is due to heredity, total deafness is often the end result. On the one hand, persons who experience gradual deterioration of their hearing are fortunate in that they have learned to speak. Ultimately the affected person may bridge communication problems by becoming skilled in sign language, speech-reading, using a hearing aid, or accepting elective surgery to use a prosthetic devices such as a cochlear implant. Social impact Those who lose their hearing later in life, such as in late adolescence or adulthood, face their own challenges. For example, they must adjust to living with the adaptations that make it possible for them to live independently. They may have to adapt to using hearing aids or a cochlear implant, develop speech-reading skills, and/or learn sign language. The affected person may need to use a TTY, a videophone, an interpreter, or relay service to communicate over the telephone. Loneliness and depression can arise as a result of isolation (from the inability to communicate with friends and loved ones) and difficulty in accepting their disability. The challenge is made greater by the need for those around them to adapt to the person's hearing loss. References *S. Rosen and P.

He met Andr√© Breton in 1959, and joined the Surrealist group that same year. In 1959, he also performed Ex√©cution Du Testament Du Marquis De Sade, for which he made costumes. The dark, grotesque characters wore sharp, seemingly mechanical pieces mixing biomorphic, animalistic shapes that make the humans look like torture devices.

Though born in the Occitan city of Toulouse in France, he is of Spanish descent as his parents had fled from the Francoist State. Biography =The beginnings= It is worth noting that Mengo was born with greatly diminished hearing. In fact, it was estimated by doctors that 70% of his hearing ability was missing. Despite this handicap, his mother gave him a keyboard as a plaything. It is now clear that this had an impact upon his future career. During his teenage years, corrective surgery for his ears helped him to regain his hearing ability. Music, however, was not Mengo's first career plan. Upon completing the baccalaur√©at, Mengo pursued chemistry and physics at university. =Music= Music initially was a hobby to Mengo as his studies came first. During his university years, Mengo would play piano at a local bar during the evenings. Mengo had purchased an 8 Track recorder, and this would play heavily into his move into the music industry. With Mengo writing the music, and his brother-in-law producing lyrics a considerable inventory of music was created. It was good enough for Mengo to get his first record contract in 1988, shortly thereafter he released his first single, which was a hit on the French Top 50. His music quickly became popular, and by 1992 he was asked to write a song for French superstar Johnny Hallyday. In 1993, he wrote an entire album for German singer Ute Lemper. He performed the song \\"Parler d'amour\\" with Ute on this album. Despite his successes, he remains relatively unknown.

While the idea of communicating using two modes of language seems ideal in a hearing/deaf setting, in practice the two languages are rarely relayed perfectly. Often the native language of the user (usually spoken language for the hearing person and sign language for the deaf person) is the language that is strongest, while the non-native language degrades in clarity. In an educational environment this is particularly difficult for deaf children as a majority of teachers who teach the deaf are hearing. Results from surveys taken indicate that communication for students is indeed signing (about 2/3 of the population of students), and that the signing leans more toward English rather than ASL.  History/overview  Manual communication, including simultaneous communication, has existed for a while in the United States, but gained traction in the 70's. The history of using signing with children has been a tumultuous one, with many swings between discouraging the use of signed languages and focusing on oralism, to the current push of bilingualism in Deaf schools. Ultimately, the majority of schools pushed the signed language they used to focus on English, resulting in the birth of a language that combined spoken language (English) with a manual language. The historical use of SC in schools has been stormy, with professionals (both researchers and teachers alike) on either side of the debate on whether the language is useful or not.  Studies/research  =Positive approaches= According to a study done in 1984, it was found that compared with haphazard instruction involving no language approach whatsoever, Total Communication was proved to be beneficial when combined with the correct approach. One study entitled \\"Intelligibility of speech produced during simultaneous communication\\", 12 hearing impaired individuals were asked to audit the audio samples of 4 hearing sign language experts who had produced recordings of a Simultaneous Communication (SC) sample and a Speech Alone (SA) sample. The 12 hearing impaired individuals were asked to then determine which speech produced was clearer. After listening to both audio samples, hearing impaired listeners agreed that both SC and SA were intelligible, which is supported by previous research. Since the intelligibility of the speech was kept on par with English grammar, the study results indicate that SC is a positive tool to use with Deaf and Hard of Hearing children as a language model and for Deaf/Hard of Hearing adults to keep using. Another study showed the difference between a control group, families who participated in an intervention program that offered services such as classes on Total Communication, private teachers for the child and a deaf adult who came to the families house, and another group of families who used TC, but did not have as much intervention as the control group. The results showed that intervention did work, and that it positively correlated with the communication skills show by the control group's children. The children showed advanced cognitive skills, including comprehension and expression, specifically related to time. = Negative approaches = A study done in 1990 titled \\"The Effectiveness of Three Means of Communication in the College Classroom\\" by Dennis Cokely reviewed research done previously that supported the use of Total Communication (SimCom) in the classroom. However, the study pointed out several restrictive factors that several research tests had not approached. One of the tests administered only compared SimCom, the Rochester Method and speech reading with voice (lip reading), omitting the option of ASL as a means of communication. The 1990 study addressed this issue by comparing SimCom, Sign Alone and Interpretation to see which was the most effective. The results from the comparison showed that signing alone as a way for students to understand information given was the most effective and SimCom was the least effective. Overall, Sign Alone and Interpretation was most effective in all areas of the test, proving that SimCom was a struggle for teachers and students alike. When working with two separate modes of communication, the one that comes naturally for the user will be the more prominent mode. A study conducted in 1998 showed that signing and speaking at the same time results in a slower approach to instruction than if just one modality was used to express language.  Methods of Total Communication  Listed below are the signed communications that are used within SimCom. Since SimCom can use any spoken language, mainly English, combined with any signed mode, all communication listed below are available for use. * American Sign Language * Signing Exact English * Cued speech * Contact sign (Pidgin Sign) * Total Communication * Bimodal bilingualism See also *Key word signing References Category:Sign systems Category:Deafness Category:Deaf culture Category:Special education Category:Education for the deaf ","title":"Simultaneous communication"},{"id":"2076664","text":"Lillian Roth (December 13, 1910 ‚Äì May 12, 1980) was an American singer and actress. Her life story was told in the 1955 film I'll Cry Tomorrow, in which she was portrayed by Susan Hayward, who was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance. Early life Roth was born on December 13, 1910 in Boston, Massachusetts, the daughter of Katie (n√©e Silverman) and Arthur Rutstein. Her family was Jewish.Stark, Bonnie Rothbart (2009). \\"Lillian Roth, 1910-1980\\", Jewish Women: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia. Jewish Women's Archive. Retrieved September 6, 2018. She was only 6 years old when her mother took her to Educational Pictures, where she became the company's trademark, symbolized by a living statue holding a lamp of knowledge. In her autobiography, I'll Cry Tomorrow (1954), she describes being molested by the man who painted her as a statue. She attended the Professional Children's School in New York City, with classmates Ruby Keeler and Milton Berle. In 1917 Roth made her Broadway debut as the character \\"Flossie\\" in The Inner Man.\\"The Inner Man\\", original cast, Internet Broadway Database (IBDB), The Broadway League, New York, N.Y. Retrieved March 16, 2020. Her film debut occurred the following year, when she performed as an extra in the government documentary Pershing's Crusaders. She and her sister Ann also toured together during this period as \\"Lillian Roth and Co.\\", although at times they were billed as \\"The Roth Kids\\". According to Lillian's autobiography, one of the highlights of their tour was meeting U.S. President Woodrow Wilson, who attended the girls' vaudeville act and afterwards allowed them to ride with him briefly in his chauffeur-driven car. Roth entered the Clark School of Concentration in the early 1920s. She appeared in Artists and Models in 1923 and went on to make Revels with Frank Fay. During production for the show, she told management she was 19 years of age despite being only 13 at the time. Career In 1927, at the age of 17, Roth returned to Broadway to perform in the first of three Earl Carroll Vanities, which was followed by Midnight Frolics, a Florenz Ziegfeld production. Soon the young actress signed a seven- year contract with Paramount Pictures.

DeMille's Madam Satan (1930) with Reginald Denny and Kay Johnson, Sea Legs with Jack Oakie, and the Marx Brothers' second film, Animal Crackers (1930). She took over Ethel Merman's stage role in the film version of Take a Chance, singing \\"Eadie Was a Lady\\". After leaving Paramount, she was cast by Warner Bros. in a supporting role in the 1933 women's prison film Ladies They Talk About starring Barbara Stanwyck. Roth headlined the Palace Theatre in New York City and performed in the Earl Carroll Vanities in 1928, 1931, and 1932. She continued to make strides as a singer in an era when so much was being set to music. Ain't She Sweet (1933) with a short film of Roth singing during the latter half of the cartoon. During this time, her personal life increasingly was overshadowed by her alcoholism. Although her parents were not stereotypical stage parents, as a response to their influence, Roth came to rely too much on other people. In her books and interviews, she said she was too trusting of husbands who made key decisions concerning her money and contracts. Roth was out of the limelight from the late 1930s. Roth's personal and spiritual feelings led her to convert to Catholicism in 1948. Friends accused her of forsaking Judaism; however, in her autobiography Roth explains that although her parents had believed in God, her sister and she had not been brought up religiously. Roth in her book also insists that she was so inherently Jewish that she could not really forget her heritage and thought that she was \\"the richer\\" because of it. In February 1953, she appeared on a special episode of the TV series This Is Your Life hosted by Ralph Edwards. In response to her honesty in relating her story of alcoholism, she received more than 40,000 letters. Her theme song, which she began singing as a child performer, was \\"When the Red, Red Robin (Comes Bob, Bob, Bobbin' Along)\\". Roth's appearance on This Is Your LifeIn 1962, she was featured as Elliott Gould's mother in the Broadway musical I Can Get It for You Wholesale, in which Barbra Streisand made her Broadway debut. Despite the acclaim for Streisand, producer David Merrick realized that Roth's name still sold tickets, and he elevated her to above- title star billing after the show's opening, with Gould, Streisand, and Sheree North listed below. Roth remained with the show for its full run of 301 performances and recorded the cast album for Columbia Records. She was also featured as Mrs. Brice in the national touring company of Funny Girl in 1964, again getting top billing. Marriages Roth was married six times: to aviator William C. Scott (\\"Willie Richards\\"), Judge Benjamin Shalleck, Mark Harris, Eugene J. Weiner, Edward Goldman (\\"Vic\\"), and Thomas Burt McGuire. Before her marriages, she was engaged to David Lyons, who died of tuberculosis.Roth, Lillian. I'll Cry Tomorrow. Popular Library, United States: 1955. She divorced her first husband in 1932 after 13 months of marriage.Pittsburgh-Post Gazette, May 6, 1932 In 1947, she met her last husband, Thomas Burt McGuire, scion of Funk and Wagnalls Publishing Company at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting (Roth joined Alcoholics Anonymous in 1946). The two wed and McGuire managed Roth until September 1963 when she received a note from him stating that their marriage was finished. Later years Roth returned to Broadway in 1971 in the Kander and Ebb musical 70, Girls, 70, which despite its short run was also recorded by Columbia Records and has remained a popular cast album. She played a pathologist in the 1976 cult horror classic Alice, Sweet Alice (also known as Communion). Her last film was Boardwalk, with Lee Strasberg, Ruth Gordon, and Janet Leigh (1979). A successful concert at Town Hall was released as an album by AEI Records after her death. One of her latter appearances was in a well-reviewed club act at the legendary NYC nightclub, Reno Sweeney. Autobiographies Roth's autobiography, I'll Cry Tomorrow, was written with author-collaborator Gerold Frank in 1954, and a toned-down version of it was made into a hit film the following year starring Susan Hayward, who was nominated for an Academy Award. The book became a bestseller worldwide and sold more than 7 million copies in 20 languages, and the film renewed the public's interest in Roth. She recorded four songs for the Coral label (the first commercial recordings of her career), which were followed by an LP for Epic and another for Tops. She also headlined a vaudeville revival at the Palace on Broadway. A highlight of her act was an imitation of Susan Hayward imitating her (Roth) singing \\"Red, Red Robin\\". In 1958, Roth published a second book, Beyond My Worth, which was not as successful as its predecessor, but told the compelling story of what it was like to be placed on a pedestal that she could not always live up to. Roth had managed to re-invent herself as a major concert and nightclub performer. She appeared at venues in Las Vegas and New York's Copacabana and was a popular attraction in Australia. Death After suffering a stroke at her New York City apartment in February 1980, Roth died at age 69 on May 12 at De Witt Nursing Home in Manhattan.Ledbetter, Les (1980). \\"Lillian Roth, Actress and Singer, Dies...\\", The New York Times, May 13, 1980, p.

There are many causes of leukorrhea, the usual one being estrogen imbalance. The amount of discharge may increase due to vaginal infection, and it may disappear and reappear from time to time. This discharge can keep occurring for years, in which case it becomes more yellow and foul- smelling. It is usually a non-pathological symptom secondary to inflammatory conditions of the vagina or cervix. Leukorrhea can be confirmed by finding >10 WBC under a microscope when examining vaginal fluid.Workowski, Kimberly A., and Stuart Berman. \\"Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines, 2010.\\" Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 17 Dec. 2010. Web. 28 Oct. 2014. . Vaginal discharge is normal, and causes of change in discharge include infection, malignancy, and hormonal changes. It sometimes occurs before an adolescent female has her first period, and is considered a sign of puberty. Types =Physiologic leukorrhea= It is not a major issue but is to be resolved as soon as possible. It can be a natural defense mechanism that the vagina uses to maintain its chemical balance, as well as to preserve the flexibility of the vaginal tissue. The term \\"physiologic leukorrhea\\" is used to refer to leukorrhea due to estrogen stimulation. Leukorrhea may occur normally during pregnancy. This is caused by increased bloodflow to the vagina due to increased estrogen. Female infants may have leukorrhea for a short time after birth due to their in-uterine exposure to estrogen. =Inflammatory leukorrhea= It may also result from inflammation or congestion of the vaginal mucosa. In cases where it is yellowish or gives off an odor, a doctor should be consulted since it could be a sign of several disease processes, including an organic bacterial infection (aerobic vaginitis) or STD. After delivery, leukorrhea accompanied by backache and foul-smelling lochia (post-partum vaginal discharge, containing blood, mucus, and placental tissue) may suggest the failure of involution (the uterus returning to pre-pregnancy size) due to infection. A number of investigation such as wet smear, Gram stain, culture, pap smear and biopsy are suggested to diagnose the condition. =Parasitic leukorrhea= Leukorrhea is also caused by trichomonads, a group of parasitic protozoan, specifically Trichomonas vaginalis. Common symptoms of this disease are burning sensation, itching and discharge of frothy substance, thick, white or yellow mucous. Treatment Leukorrhea may be caused by sexually transmitted diseases; therefore, treating the STD will help treat the leukorrhea. Treatment may include antibiotics, such as metronidazole. Other antibiotics common for the treatment of STIs include clindamycin or tinidazole.\\"Treatments for Specific Types of Sexually Transmitted Diseases and Sexually Transmitted Infections (STDs/STIs).\\" Treatments for Specific Types of Sexually Transmitted Diseases and Sexually Transmitted Infections (STDs/STIs).

Cable tram dummy and trailer on the St Kilda Line in 1905 The Melbourne cable tramway system was a cable car public transport system, which operated between 1885 and 1940 in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. The first line, from Spencer Street to the end of Bridge Road Richmond via Flinders Street, was opened on 11 November 1885, and all planned lines were built by 1891, the last being the short Windsor-St Kilda Esplanade line, opened 17 October 1891. By then it had about of double track (103.2 route km or 64.12 route miles) and 1,200 cars and trailers, on 15 routes radiating from the centre of Melbourne to neighbouring suburbs. It was one of the largest cable car systems in the world, comparable with those of San Francisco which had 23 lines, and Chicago which had 66.0 km of double track. With the exception of the Northcote tramway, which was privately built and managed, the infrastructure of the network was built by the Melbourne Tramway Trust, which consisted of representatives of the 12 local councils served by the system. The trust bought land, laid the tracks, and built the cable winding houses. The Melbourne Tramway & Omnibus Company (MTOC) provided the trams and operated the services from 1885 to 1916 under an exclusive 30-year franchise arrangement with the Victorian Government. MTOC had been founded by Francis Boardman Clapp, an American emigrant, who had purchased the Victorian rights to the patents of the cable system developed by Andrew Hallidie. George Smith Duncan, who had built the Roslyn cable tramway in Dunedin, New Zealand, was the engineer in charge of the development of the Melbourne cable network. On the expiration of the MTOC's franchise in 1916, the cable tram network was transferred to the Victorian Government, and then passed to the government- owned Melbourne & Metropolitan Tramways Board (MMTB) on 1 November 1919. The Northcote tramway was transferred to the MMTB on 20 February 1920. Although the first electric tram service was introduced in 1889, and ran for seven years between the outer Melbourne suburbs of Box Hill and Doncaster, the electric tram network did not seriously commence until 1906, when the Victorian Railways built an \\"Electric Street Railway\\" from St Kilda railway station to Brighton, and The North Melbourne Electric Tramway & Lighting Company built an electric tramway towards Essendon from the terminus of the cable system. From 1924 the cable tram lines were progressively converted to electric traction. The last Melbourne cable tram ran on 26 October 1940, on the Northcote to Bourke Street route. Cable tram routes = Richmond Line (1885-1927) = The Richmond line opened on 11 November 1885, and ran between Hawthorn Bridge and City (Spencer Street). The line was converted to electric traction in stages. The line was at first truncated to Swanston Street on 15 May 1927, the rest of the line closing on 29 June 1927. The converted line between Swanston Street and Spencer Street opened on 14 July 1927. The section between Swanston Street and Simpson Street opened on 17 September 1927, and the rest of the line to Hawthorn Bridge opened later that year on 4 December, connecting with the Church Street line and the Burwood Road line, which were already in operation. This conversion enabled Mont Albert and East Kew trams to reach the city directly. The powerhouse was located on Bridge Road, at Hoddle Street, and has since been demolished to provide for a left-turn lane. The remains of the Richmond cable tram depot now form part of the Amora Hotel, near Hawthorn Bridge. = North Fitzroy Line (1886-1930) = The North Fitzroy line opened on 2 October 1886, and ran between North Fitzroy and City (Collins Street). The line was converted to electric traction in stages. The North Fitzroy Line was truncated to Brunswick Street on 14 September 1929. The line was eventually fully closed on 12 July 1930. The Collins Street section was converted to electric traction and opened on 8 December 1929. The line between Brunswick Street and North Fitzroy was reopened on 26 October 1930. This conversion enabled a direct route for West Preston and East Preston electric trams to reach the city, rather than using the Holden Street line. The powerhouse was located on the north-east corner of Victoria Parade and Brunswick Street. The car shed was located at Holden Street near the North Fitzroy terminus. A cable tram at the Victoria Bridge terminus = Victoria Bridge Line (1886-1929) = The Victoria Bridge line opened on 22 November 1886, and ran between Victoria Bridge and City (Collins Street). The Victoria Bridge line was closed on 13 July 1929 for conversion to electric traction between Victoria Bridge and Brunswick Street. This section reopened on 15 September 1929, providing a second route for East Kew and Mont Albert electric trams to reach the city (along with Bridge Road). The rest of the Collins Street line was converted to electric traction and reopened on 8 December 1929. The powerhouse was located on the north-east corner of Victoria Parade and Brunswick Street. The car shed was located on Victoria Street near the Victoria Bridge terminus. = Clifton Hill Line (1887-1940) = The Clifton Hill line opened on 10 August 1887, and ran between Clifton Hill and City (Bourke Street). When the Clifton Hill - Northcote line opened in 1890, it interchanged with the Clifton Hill line at its southern terminus. Passengers initially had to physically walk between the two lines for a through service. When the Melbourne & Metropolitan Tramways Board took over the line in 1925, the two lines were connected together and a through-service was established between Northcote and the city (Bourke Street). The combined Clifton Hill/Northcote line was among the last cable lines to close (along with the Nicholson Street line) on 26 October 1940. Initially, the MMTB replaced the line with buses. Within a few years, it was noticed that the bus route were unsuccessful at coping with the high demand of the routes, so conversion of the Northcote line to electric traction was scheduled to take place right after World War II ended. However, it was not until 26 September 1955 that the Northcote/Clifton Hill route finally reopened. The powerhouse was located on the south-east corner of Nicholson and Gertrude Streets. The car shed was located on Queens Parade near the Clifton Hill terminus. = Nicholson Street Line (1887-1940) = The Nicholson Street line opened on 30 August 1887, and ran between Nicholson Street and City (Bourke Street). The Nicholson Street line was among the last cable lines to close (along with the Northcote line) on 26 October 1940. Initially, the MMTB replaced the line with buses. Within a few years, it was noticed that the bus route were unsuccessful at coping with the high demand of the routes, so conversion of the Northcote line to electric traction was scheduled to take place right after World War II ended. However, it wasn't until 8 April 1956 that the Nicholson Street route finally reopened. The powerhouse building still exists, and is located on the south-east corner of Nicholson and Gertrude Streets. The car shed was located on Nicholson Street near the Nicholson Street terminus. = Brunswick Line (1887-1936) = The Brunswick Line, circa 1930s. The Brunswick line opened on 1 October 1887, and ran between Brunswick and City (Elizabeth Street). The Brunswick line was converted to electric traction in stages. The line was first truncated to Victoria Street on 29 September 1935. It was further truncated to Leonard Street, Parkville on 17 November 1935. The Brunswick Line was finally closed on 11 January 1936. The powerhouse was located on the north-west corner of Brunswick Road and Black Street. The car shed was located near the Moreland Road terminus. = Collingwood Line (1887-1939) = The Collingwood line opened on 21 December 1887, and initially ran between Collingwood and City (Lonsdale Street). When the Prahran line opened in 1888, the Collingwood line operated through-routed services to Prahran. When the Swanston Street line was truncated back to Princes Bridge on 26 December 1925 for electrification, the Collingwood and North Carlton lines were truncated back to Lonsdale Street. The line was finally closed on 15 April 1939, being converted into a bus service. The powerhouse was located on the north side of Johnston Street, near Brunswick Street. The car shed was located near the Johnston Street Bridge terminus. = Brighton Road Line (1888-1925) = The Brighton Road line opened on 11 October 1888, and originally ran between Brighton Road and City (Swanston Street). The initial city terminus was at Flinders Street, but this was extended northwards towards Queensberry Street on 20 January 1889. The trams operated along Brighton Road, High Street (now just St Kilda Road), St Kilda Road and Swanston Street from Brunning Street, Balaclava to Queensberry Street, Carlton. The line was truncated from Queensberry Street to Lonsdale Street on 11 February 1924 to allow the electric trams from the North to terminate in the city. Following this point, Brighton Road trams were through- routed to North Melbourne via Lonsdale Street. The Brighton Road tram line fully closed for electrification on 26 December 1925, but the section between City Road and Domain Road remained for Toorak and Prahran trams to use. An electrified line from Lonsdale Street to Brighton Road was completed on 29 August 1926. Both the powerhouse and car shed were located on the south-east corner of St Kilda Road and Bromby Street. = Prahran Line (1888-1926) = The Prahran line opened on 26 October 1888, and ran between Prahran and City (Swanston Street). All Prahran line trams were through-routed to Collingwood via Lonsdale Street. The line ran along Chapel Street from Carlisle Street and Toorak Road where it met the Toorak line, along Toorak Road, Park Street and Domain Road to St Kilda Road where it met the Brighton Road line. Trams then ran via St Kilda Road and Swanston Street to Lonsdale Street where trams continued onto Collingwood. The line was truncated to City Road on 26 December 1925, when the Swanston Street line was closed for electrification. The line was further truncated back to Domain Road on 12 January 1926, when the St Kilda Road line was being converted to electric traction. The rest of the line was closed on 28 August 1926. However, Toorak trams still used the line between Domain Road and Chapel Street until October 1 later that year. The powerhouse and the car shed were both located on the north-west corner of Toorak Road and Chapel Street. = North Carlton Line (1889-1939) = The North Carlton line opened on 9 February 1889, and ran between North Carlton and City (Lonsdale Street). In 1897, the North Carlton service began running through-routed services to St Kilda Beach. The line was closed on 1 August 1936, being replaced by a bus service, though the Collingwood line continued to use the section of track between Rathdowne Street and Lonsdale Street until it closed on 15 April 1939. Both the powerhouse and the car shed were located at the south-west corner of Rathdowne and Park Streets. = Toorak Line (1889-1926) = The Toorak line opened on 15 February 1889, and ran between Toorak and City (Swanston Street). The initial city terminus was at Flinders Street, but this was extended northwards towards Queensberry Street on 20 January 1889. The line was truncated from Queensberry Street to Lonsdale Street on 11 February 1924 to allow the electric trams from the North to terminate in the city. The line was truncated to City Road on 26 December 1925, when the Swanston Street line was closed for electrification. The line was further truncated back to Domain Road on 12 January 1926, when the St Kilda Road line was being converted to electric traction. The rest of the line was finally closed on 1 October 1926. Both the car shed and the powerhouse located on the north-west corner of Toorak Road and Chapel Street. = North Melbourne Line (1890-1935) = The North Melbourne Line opened on 3 March 1890, and ran between Flemington Bridge and City (Elizabeth Street). Trams initially terminated at Flinders Street, but due to congestion, the line was diverted at Lonsdale Street and through-routed to Brighton Road on 11 February 1924. The section between Flemington Bridge and Abbotsford Street was closed for electric conversion on 18 July 1925, which was first section cable line in Melbourne to close. The rest of the line closed for conversion to electric traction on 20 July 1935, though the Brunswick Line continued to use the Elizabeth Street section until 28 September 1935. The powerhouse was located on the west corner of Queensberry and Abbotsford Streets. The car shed was located was located near the Flemington Bridge terminus, but later was moved to Victoria Street, near the intersection of Howard Street after the Flemington Bridge section of the line was closed. = West Melbourne Line (1890-1935) = The West Melbourne line opened on 18 April 1890, and ran between West Melbourne and City (Elizabeth Street). The entire line was closed on 20 July 1935, being replaced by buses, though the Elizabeth Street section of the line was used by the Brunswick Line for a few months after until it too closed on 28 September 1935. The powerhouse was located at the south-west corner of Queensberry Street and Abbotsford Street. The car shed for the West Melbourne line was always shared with the North Melbourne line, first using the Flemington Bridge car shed and later using the Victoria Street car shed from 18 July 1925 onwards. = South Melbourne Line (1890-1937) = The South Melbourne opened on 17 June 1890, and ran between South Melbourne and City (Collins Street). Initially, the city terminus was located on Gisborne Street at Victoria Parade, but after the Collins Street line was closed for electrification on 14 September 1929, the South Melbourne line was truncated back to Market Street. Eventually, the line entire line closed for electrification on 13 July 1937, but the electric line instead ran to the city via Spencer Street, the City Road section being abandoned. The powerhouse was located on the south side of City Road, near Cecil Street. The car shed was located near the South Melbourne terminus on Victoria Avenue. = Port Melbourne Line (1890-1937) = The Port Melbourne line opened on 20 June 1890, and ran between Port Melbourne and City (Collins Street). Initially, the city terminus was located on Gisborne Street at Victoria Parade, but after the Collins Street line was closed for electrification on 14 September 1929, the Port Melbourne line was truncated back to Market Street. Eventually, the line entire line closed on 13 July 1937, being replaced by a bus service. The powerhouse located on the south side of City Road, near Cecil Street. The car shed was located on Beaconsfield Parade near the Port Melbourne terminus. = Windsor - St Kilda Line (1891-1925) = The Windsor - St Kilda line opened on 17 October 1891, and ran between Windsor Railway Station and St Kilda Beach. It was the final cable tram line to open, but was also the first major line to close for electrification on 29 August 1925. The powerhouse was located on the north side of Wellington Street, near Marlton Crescent. The car shed was located near the St Kilda terminus on Acland Street. = Clifton Hill - Northcote Line (1890-1940) = The Clifton Hill - Northcote line was opened by the Clifton Hill to Northcote & Preston Tramway Company on 18 February 1890, and was Melbourne's only privately built and operated cable tramway. It ran between the northern terminus of the Clifton Hill line, and Dundas Street, Northcote. Early in its existence, the line struggled financially. Passengers initially had to physically walk to the Clifton Hill line for a through service to the city. When the Melbourne & Metropolitan Tramways Board took over the line in 1925, the two lines were connected together and a through- service was established between Northcote and the city (Bourke Street). The combined Clifton Hill/Northcote line was among the last cable lines to close (along with the Nicholson Street line) on 26 October 1940. Initially, the MMTB replaced the line with buses. Within a few years, it was noticed that the bus route were unsuccessful at coping with the high demand of the routes, so conversion of the Northcote line to electric traction was scheduled to take place right after World War II ended. However, it wasn't until 26 September 1955 that the Northcote/Clifton Hill route finally reopened. The powerhouse and the car shed was located on the north-east corner of High and Martin Streets.

It entered service in 1970. The rifle was replaced by the Accuracy International PM as the L96A1 in 1985.Pegler, Sniper Rifles ‚Äì From the 19th to the 21st century (2010), pp. 62-63. The L42A1 was the last model in a long line of bolt-action rifles that used a rear-locking action designed by James Paris Lee for the British Army; this action design appeared first in the Lee‚ÄìMetford rifle of 1888.Pegler, Sniper Rifles ‚Äì From the 19th to the 21st century (2010), p. 27. During its British Army service, the L42A1 was used in active service in several conflicts, including the Dhofar Rebellion in Oman, The Troubles in Northern Ireland, the Falklands War, and the Gulf War. Design details The L42A1 was a 7.62√ó51mm NATO conversion of the Second World War era .303 British chambered Lee‚ÄìEnfield Rifle No. 4 Mk1(T) and No. 4 Mk1*(T), which had remained in service for some time after the 7.62√ó51mm NATO L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle replaced the Rifle No.4 as the standard service rifle in 1957. It differed from other post-war No. 4 based variants in that the trigger remained hinged on the trigger guard as on the No.4 Mk1 and 1*, not hung from the receiver as in the later No. 4 Mk 2, Mk 1/2 and Mk 1/3 .303 British rifles, and other 7.62√ó51mm NATO conversions. The conversion programme was carried out at Royal Small Arms Factory Enfield from 1970 to 1971. About 1,080 rifles were converted. A new hammer-forged heavy 7.62√ó51mm NATO barrel was installed, with four-groove, right hand twist rifling instead of the five- groove left-hand Enfield-type rifling used in .303 British barrels. The heavier barrel was free-floating, which meant that the required accuracy standard could be achieved without the barrel bearing against the wooden fore- end, as had been the case with the No.4 MkI(T). Therefore the woodwork was modified by shortening the fore-end to 1/2\\" in front of the middle band, and a new design for an upper handguard was fitted. The No. 32 3.5 power telescopic sight was refurbished and the bullet drop compensation on the elevation drum modified for the ballistic characteristics of the 7.62√ó51mm NATO cartridge in increments out to . The modified version was renamed the \\"Telescope, Straight Sighting, L1A1\\". A new magazine suitable for the 7.62√ó51mm NATO cartridge was attached; it is recognizable by its more square shape when compared against the .303 British version. A hardened projection of the left magazine lip serves as an ejector, although the .303 ejector screw remained in place. The butt with its screwed-on cheekpiece was retained, however the scope number on the wrist of the stock, was obliterated with \\"X\\"-outs, and new numbers applied. The markings on the left side of the receiver were obliterated and new markings reflecting the new rifle's designation and chambering were applied. The original markings are sometimes partially visible underneath. A new, larger transit case was made for the L42A1. Variants ;L39A1 :a target-shooting variant produced for military full-bore shooting teams. It was similar to the L42A1, except it was fitted with Parker-Hale target tunnel front and micrometer-adjustable rear sights in lieu of the telescopic sight, and the butt did not have a sniper cheekpiece. The rifles were supplied without sights, which had to be fitted by the units to which they were issued. Some rifles are seen retrofitted with a curved pistol grip similar to the butt used on the No.8 .22 rifle. Since magazine loading was not required, the L39A1 as issued had a .303 British magazine, the follower of which served as a loading platform for single shot use, although 7.62x51mm NATO magazines are also seen fitted, as the receivers are machined to accept these. The barrel was the same hammer-forged, heavy 7.62√ó51mm NATO version fitted to the L42A1, fitted for a Parker-Hale type front sight band. ;No.4 7.62mm CONV :As for L39A1, except the rifles were supplied from the factory with Parker-Hale 5c sights, No.8-style butt and 7.62x51mm magazine as standard. These rifles share the same serial number range as the L39A1, 1183 rifles (both types plus pre- production experimental types together). These rifles were mostly sent to the Army Rifle Association, and were available for purchase by military units. ;Enfield Enforcer :a police-specific sniper variant used by various British police forces from the early 1970s. It was similar to the L39A1, with a commercial \\"Monte Carlo\\" style butt with semi-pistol grip and integral cheekpiece. It was provided with a high-quality East German-made Pecar Berlin telescopic sight. The telescope mounts were of commercial pattern; they did not resemble the No.4 Mk1(T) type screw-on mounts used on the L42A1. Target sights similar to those used on the L39A1 could also be fitted to the Enforcer. The 7.62√ó51mm NATO magazine was fitted, and 767 were made. ;Enfield Envoy :similar to the L39A1, but was produced with a higher standard of external finish for sale on the civilian market. It had a fore-end of broader cross section of the same shape as the No.8, and was supplied with a No.8 style butt.

Chopping AMX GT show car that was built using a 1968 AMC Javelin production car. Chopping the top of a VW Beetle - the C-pillar is unfinished. In this picture the chop is almost complete. Note how much smaller the rear side windows are when compared to a stock Beetle. \\"Chopping the top\\" goes back to the early days of hot rodding and is an attempt to reduce the frontal profile of a car and increase its speed potential. To chop a roof, the pillars and windows are cut down, lowering the overall roofline. Some racers on the dry lakes chopped the tops of their cars so severely the windows were only a few inches tall. These were sometimes referred to as \\"mail slot\\" windows. This sort of bodywork is also popular on custom cars, kustoms, and leadsleds. Roof chopping also quickly became very popular with drag racers for much the same reasons as it did for lakes racers. The first roof chopper is considered to be Sam Barris (brother of auto customizer George Barris), who chopped and customized his brand new 1949 Mercury. Barris also pioneered a more advanced form, where the B-pillar is removed, turning it into a pillarless hardtop in the process. Concept cars, such as the AMX-GT, often undergo a lowering of their roofs, even if the vehicles are based on production models. Automakers use the chopping technique to make their show cars look more sleek and \\"racy\\", although it would be impractical for normal use. Channeling Channeling is a modification that can be applied to cars with body-on-frame construction. To channel a car, its body is temporarily lifted off of its ladder or perimeter frame. After cutting the floor loose and refastening it higher inside the body, the body can then be lowered back over the frame. Thus the modification causes the entire body to rest closer to the ground without alterations to the suspension. The overall effect is to give the car's body a more massive appearance. Each automobile would have its own engineering challenges as far as modifying the various components of the chassis. Local laws may prevent making the modifications too extreme, and safety would dictate some restraint. Channeling is also popular amongst hot rod, leadsled and minitruck enthusiasts, though the latter refer to it as a \\"body drop\\". Sectioning Sectioning removes a horizontal section from the body of a car, lowering the top half onto the bottom half, and welding the result back together. The purpose is to reduce the overall height of the bodywork of the car. Like a roof chop, it also has the advantage of reducing a car's frontal area and reducing wind resistance. This sort of bodywork is popular on minitrucks, race cars, kustoms, and leadsleds.

His plan was based on \\"heaven-sent\\" orders to free the slaves. He tried to recruit slaves from Orange, Spotsylvania, and Louisa counties to meet at his home with horses, guns, swords and clubs. He planned to attack and take over Fredericksburg and Richmond, Virginia.Virginia Johnson, \\"African American History in the Rappahannock Region\\", History Point.org, accessed Apr 12, 2009 Lucy, a local slave, informed her owner, and the plot was foiled. Six slaves involved were imprisoned or executed. With his wife's help, Boxley escaped from the Spotsylvania County Jail and, despite a reward, he was never caught. Boxley fled to Ohio and Indiana, where he was joined by his family. He built a cabin in 1830, the first in Adams Township. He helped runaway slaves, taught school, and supported abolitionism.James C. Foley, \\"Migrants against Slavery in Black and White\\", review of Philip J. Schwarz, Migrants Against Slavery: Virginians and the Nation], History.net The George Boxley Cabin has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\\"Boxley Cabin Area Will Be Archaeological Focus On Sept. 15\\" , Sheridan Historical Society, Aug 15, 2007, accessed Apr 13, 2009 Boxley‚Äôs years as an Indiana pioneer Boxley's cabin in Sheridan George Boxley, a native of Virginia, was born in 1780. He was a merchant storekeeper and miller who became deeply committed to abolitionism. He arrived in Indiana as a fugitive from justice and was the first settler in Adams Township, Hamilton County, Indiana. Accounts vary in details, but the facts are that Boxley, himself a slaveowner, opposed‚Äîor came to oppose‚Äîthe institution of slavery. Boxley was accused of helping slaves to escape and of fomenting a slave rebellion in Spotsylvania County, Virginia. Jailed, he made his escape aided by his wife Hannah. After fleeing Virginia, Boxley may have spent a brief time in Pennsylvania. Various accounts indicate that he lived in Ohio and the Missouri Territory at different times, and that at least once he was confronted by bounty hunters but was able to elude them. His family eventually joined him each time he relocated. Finally Boxley headed to Indiana, pausing first at Strawtown with the idea of continuing westward to settle along the Wabash River. Sources indicate that on his way west through the heavily forested land, Boxley took note of what was to become his future home and decided to stake a claim there. It was about 1828 that Boxley arrived to stay in Adams Township, his family soon joining him. Boxley recorded the of land on which he had built his cabin in 1830, the earliest in the township. Boxley was a well- read man and believed strongly in education. On his land, he soon constructed a small log school for his own children and those of other settlers starting to come into the area. Boxley is credited with establishing the first school in the township. He taught his pupils from the books in his own library, educating them in history, literature, law and politics, about which he held strong views. How long he kept the school going is unclear, but it was at least until about 1838, when a subscription school became available in the settlement of Englewood (later, Bakers Corner) roughly four miles to the east, and possibly even longer. In 1851, a township school was finally established near the southeast corner of Boxley's land. Local folklore holds that Boxley participated in the Underground Railroad by hiding runaway slaves in an excavated place beneath his cabin. Certainly his abolitionist views were widely known, but there is no concrete evidence to document his having participated in the Underground Railroad. Such activity is known to have taken place to the southeast in the Westfield area, and some sources indicate there was a route that would have passed, and perhaps included, Boxley's cabin. On the other hand, since Boxley's strong libertarian and abolitionist sympathies were public knowledge, logic suggests that the Boxley property might have been a too obvious‚Äîand thus insecure‚Äîhiding place for fugitive slaves. But this would not have prevented him from helping in any number of other ways. Marriage and family George Boxley married Hannah in Fredericksburg, Virginia, and they had 11 children together, some born after they left the South. While some were young adults when Boxley arrived in Indiana, the youngest among them were born in his years on the run. His youngest child became the first recorded death in the township: Benjamin Boxley was killed by a tree that fell on him during a severe thunderstorm. After the death of his wife in 1853, George Boxley had deteriorating health. At some point, he left his cabin to live with his son Caswell (1817‚Äì1891), a lawyer and schoolteacher. Caswell's first wife died in 1858, and possibly his father came to live with him at that time. Caswell rapidly remarried, finding a second wife, Sarah Ann Kercheval, whom he married in 1859. He also purchased his father's land then. George Boxley died in 1865 and was buried in the cemetery of the town named after him. Legacy and honors *In 1836, Boxley's two oldest sons, Thomas and Addison, founded Boxleytown about four miles (6 km) to the northeast of the Boxley cabin on the old Lafayette Trace. This was a significant road for decades. In the 1830s, a state road had been routed to the south that had formerly run across George Boxley's property. *2007 ‚Äì The restored logs of the George Boxley Cabin were reassembled on the original foundation on Pioneer Hill in Sheridan's Veterans Park.

It provides a central launching point for computer programs and performing other tasks. It has different names in different operating systems and window managers, such as Kickoff Application Launcher in KDE, Dash in GNOME and Unity, and Start screen in Windows 8. Traditionally, the Start menu provided a customizable nested list of programs for the user to launch, as well as a list of most recently opened documents, a way to find files and obtain assistance, and access to the system settings. Later enhancements via Windows Desktop Update included access to special folders such as \\"My Documents\\" and \\"Favorites\\" (browser bookmarks). Windows XP's Start menu was expanded to encompass various My Documents folders (including My Music and My Pictures), and transplanted other items like My Computer and My Network Places from the Windows desktop. Until Windows Vista, the Start menu was constantly expanded across the screen as the user navigated through its cascading sub-menus.  Microsoft Windows  In Microsoft Windows, the Start menu in some form appears in Windows 9x, Windows NT 4.0 and all subsequent versions in the Windows NT family, as well as Windows CE, Windows Mobile and Windows Phone. = First version = The Windows 95 Start menu. The Start menu was introduced in Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0, but had been worked on at Microsoft since 1992, originally being labelled as \\"System\\" to testers of the time. It was made to overcome the shortcomings of Program Manager in previous operating systems. Program Manager consisted of a simple multiple document interface (MDI) which allowed users to open separate \\"program groups\\" and then execute the shortcuts to programs contained within. It lacked the ability to nest groups within other groups. Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0 replaced Program Manager with desktop and Start menu. The latter was comparable in some respects with the Apple menu in Mac OS operating systems and did not have the mentioned limitations of Program Manager: Being a menu, it allowed nested grouping while keeping only one group open at the time. The menu also offered the ability to shut down and log off from their computer. Later developments in Internet Explorer and subsequent Windows releases make it possible to customize the Start menu and to access and expand Internet Explorer Favorites, My Documents and Administrative Tools (Windows 2000 and later) from the Start menu. Items could also be simply added to the Start menu by dragging and dropping them. Although Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 introduced a new version of Start menu, they offered the ability to switch back to this version of Start menu. This version of the Start menu is also available in Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008. However, it is absent in Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2 and other later Windows releases. = Second version = The Windows 7 Start menu. The first major overhaul to the Start menu was introduced in Windows XP and was later included in Windows Server 2003. The Start menu was expanded to two columns: the left-hand column focuses on installed programs, while the right-hand column provides access to My Documents, My Pictures, My Music and other special folders. This column also includes shortcuts for Computer and Network (Network Neighborhood in Windows 95 and 98), which were placed on the Desktop in prior versions of Windows. The contents of this column can be customized. Commonly used programs are automatically displayed in the left-hand menu. Users may opt to \\"pin\\" programs to this side of the Start menu so that they are always accessible. A sub-menu item at the bottom of this column grants access to all items of Start menu. When this menu item is selected, a scrolling list of start menu programs replaces the user/recent list. Windows Vista and its successors added minor changes to the menu. Prior to Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, the Start menu consisted of a group of menus and sub-menus that cascaded and expanded, obscuring the initially visible portions of the screen beneath them. In Windows Vista, however, cascading menus were replaced by a sliding window in the left pane of the Start menu. Whenever All Programs item is clicked, the contents of the left pane slide off the left edge of the Start menu and the All Programs menu slides in from the right edge of the left column. This menu presents a tree view of it hierarchy that expands towards the bottom, with a vertical scrollbar whenever needed. Also added in Windows Vista is a Search box that allows users to search for the Start menu shortcuts or other files and folders. The search box features incremental search: If indexing is not turned off, the search box returns results on-the-fly as users type into it. Since the found items can be immediately opened, the Start menu search box partially replaces the function of Run command from previous versions of Windows. The Run command can also be added separately to the right column in the Start menu. In Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2, the search results pane covers both columns of the Start menu. The search box is extended to support searching Control Panel items. The right column in Windows 7 links to Libraries instead of ordinary folders. Most importantly, however, items on the Start menu support Jump lists through cascade buttons on their right. Unlike prior versions, the ability to revert to the \\"Classic\\" Start menu design is no longer available. = Third version = The Start screen in Windows 8. On Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, an update to the Start menu known as the \\"Start screen\\" was introduced. It covers the entire screen and no longer features the right column. It shows much larger tiles for programs and, whenever possible, displays dynamic content supplied by the program directly on the tile itself (known as a \\"live tile\\"), behaving similarly to a widget. For instance, the live tile for an email client may display the number of unread emails. The Start screen allows users to uninstall their programs by right-clicking on them and selecting \\"Uninstall\\". Pinned apps can be placed in groups. The search box is initially hidden but can be viewed by clicking the search button on the charms bar and can also be brought up as it receives a keyboard input. True to its name, the Start screen is the first screen that a user sees upon login. The idea of a full-screen Start can be traced back to Windows Neptune, when Microsoft originally considered a \\"Start page\\" that integrated with Windows desktop through Active Desktop. This menu has its roots in Windows Mobile and Windows Phone: In Windows Mobile Standard, which runs on smartphones, the Start menu produces a separate screen of icons. Windows Phone was the original host of the design principles of the third generation Start menu. The Start screen no longer supports several previously available features. A list of recently launched program or shortcuts to special folders no longer appears on the Start screen. It no longer supports more than one level of nesting for groups in All Programs view. Drag and drop support for adding new items to the menu as well as reorganizing the contents of All Programs view is no longer available. In addition, for the first time in the history of Windows, the Start menu in a stock installation of Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, Windows 8.1 or Windows Server 2012 R2 does not provide any facility for shutting down, restarting or activating sleep mode or hibernation, forcing users to use the settings button in the charms bar to perform these actions. An April 2014 update for Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 restores the latter. = Fourth version = The latest Start menu in Windows 10. Windows 10 re-introduced the Start menu in a revised form. It uses a two column design similar to Windows 7's version, except that the right side is populated by tiles, similarly to Windows 8's Start screen. Applications can be pinned to the right half, and their respective tiles can be resized and grouped into user-specified categories. The left column displays a vertical list, containing frequently-used applications, and links to the \\"All apps\\" menu, File Explorer, Settings, and power options. Some of these links, and additional links to folders such as Downloads, Pictures, and Music, can be added through Settings' \\"Choose which folders appear on Start\\" page. The Start menu can be resized, or be placed in a full-screen display resembling the Windows 8/8.1 Start screen (although scrolling vertically instead of horizontally). The Start menu also enters this state when \\"Tablet mode\\" is enabled. As of build 10586, the left panel of the Start menu advertises \\"suggested\\" Windows Store apps; users can opt out of these suggestions. Windows RT 8.1 update KB3033055 adds a variant of the Windows 10 Start menu that is visually closer to the design used in early preview builds of Windows 10. It allows applications to be pinned to the top of the left column, with recently used apps listed below (much like 7), and as with 10, allows tiles to be pinned to the right column. = Start button = The Start menu may be launched either by pressing (the Windows key) on a keyboard or its equivalent on a tablet device, pressing CTRL+ESC on a keyboard, or by clicking on the visual Start button. With the exception of Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, the Start button can be found on the taskbar. On versions before Windows Vista, the Start Button consisted of the word \\"Start\\" and the Windows Logo (the word \\"Start\\" was localized for each different language version of the system, for instance, reading Avvio in Italian). On the Windows Vista and Windows 7 desktop, the word \\"Start\\" has been replaced by a blue Windows \\"orb\\" logo. However, the user can revert to displaying the word \\"Start\\" and the Windows Logo by setting the theme to Windows Classic. The Start button on Windows Server 2012 and Windows 8 is initially moved from the traditional taskbar to \\"charms\\", a hidden secondary taskbar located to the right of the screen (accessed by swiping in from the right on multitouch devices, or positioning the mouse in one of the right corners of the screen and sliding up or down). The Start screen is accessed either by that button or by clicking the lower left corner of the screen. Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 restore the button back to its original place without removing the new button in the charms. Right-clicking on the Start button invokes a context menu. This menu in Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 is called the Quick Link menu and grants access to several frequently used features of Windows, such as accessing desktop or File Explorer. = Location on disk = Users may add Start menu entries by creating folders and shortcuts in the associated \\"Start Menu\\" folder, located on the operating system operating media. These appear in a separated section at the top of the Start menu, or, if placed in the Programs sub-folder, in the Programs menu. The location of this folder however, depends on the operating system installed: * In Windows 9x, this folder is located either in \\"\`%windir%\\\\Start Menu\`\\" or, if there are multiple users, in \\"\`%windir%\\\\Profiles\\\\[username]\\\\Start Menu\`\\" path, where [username] is the account name of the user. * In Windows NT 4.0, the folder is located in \\"\`%systemroot%\\\\Profiles\\\\%username%\\\\Start Menu\`\\" for individual users, or \\"\`%systemroot%\\\\Profiles\\\\All Users\\\\Start Menu\`\\" for shared shortcuts. One distinguishing feature in Windows NT 4.0 is that the Start menu separated the per-user shortcuts from the shared shortcuts and by a separator line and used different icons for the program folders in per-user and shared menus. * In Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, the folder is located in \\"\`%userprofile%\\\\Start Menu\`\\" for individual users, or \\"\`%allusersprofile%\\\\Start Menu\`\\" for shared shortcuts. *In Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, Windows 8 and Windows 10, the folder is located in \\"\`%appdata%\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\Start Menu\`\\" for individual users, or \\"\`%programdata%\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\Start Menu\`\\" for the shared portion of the menu. In Windows Server 2003 and earlier, the folder name \\"Start Menu\\" has a different name on non-English versions of Windows. For example, on German versions of Windows XP it is \\"\`Startmen√º\`\\". Windows installers generally use the Windows API to find out the real names and locations of the Start menu and Desktop folders. However, since Windows Vista, all Versions of Windows use the same English named folders and only display different names in the Windows Explorer. =Tweaks= TweakUI, an unsupported utility program from Microsoft, offers additional customizations, including speeding up the response time of the Start menu, window animation, and other hacks. On Windows XP and Windows Vista, it is possible to prevent specific programs from appearing in the recent programs list (the left pane of the Start menu) by modifying the Windows registry.  Open-source operating systems  Many desktop environments for open source operating systems provide a menu similar to the start menu: * Cinnamon * FVWM95 * GNOME * IceWM * JWM * KDE Plasma * Lumina * LXDE * MATE * Qvwm * ReactOS * Unity * Xfce * Zorin OS  See also  *Desktop environment *Comparison of Start menu replacements for Windows 8 *Apple menu  References   Further reading  *Sullivan, Kent. \\"The Windows 95 User Interface: A Case Study in Usability Engineering\\". 1996 for Association for Computing Machinery, Inc.

A concrete slab is a common structural element of modern buildings, consisting of a flat, horizontal surface made of cast concrete. Steel-reinforced slabs, typically between 100 and 500 mm thick, are most often used to construct floors and ceilings, while thinner mud slabs may be used for exterior paving .Garber, G. Design and Construction of Concrete Floors. 2nd ed. Amsterdam: Butterworth- Heinemann, 2006. 47. Print.Duncan, Chester I. Soils and Foundations for Architects and Engineers. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1992. 299. Print. In many domestic and industrial buildings, a thick concrete slab supported on foundations or directly on the subsoil, is used to construct the ground floor. These slabs are generally classified as ground-bearing or suspended. A slab is ground-bearing if it rests directly on the foundation, otherwise the slab is suspended. For multi-storey buildings, there are several common slab designs : * Beam and block, also referred to as rib and block, is mostly used in residential and industrial applications. This slab type is made up of pre- stressed beams and hollow blocks and are temporarily propped until set, typically after 21 days. * A hollow core slab which is precast and installed on site with a crane * In high rise buildings and skyscrapers, thinner, pre- cast concrete slabs are slung between the steel frames to form the floors and ceilings on each level. Cast in-situ slabs are used in high rise buildings and large shopping complexes as well as houses. These in-situ slabs are cast on site using shutters and reinforced steel. On technical drawings, reinforced concrete slabs are often abbreviated to \\"r.c.c. slab\\" or simply \\"r.c.\\". Calculations and drawings are often done by structural engineers in CAD software. Thermal performance Energy efficiency has become a primary concern for the construction of new buildings, and the prevalence of concrete slabs calls for careful consideration of its thermal properties in order to minimise wasted energy. Concrete has similar thermal properties to masonry products, in that it has a relatively high thermal mass and is a good conductor of heat. In some special cases, the thermal properties of concrete have been employed, for example as a heatsink in nuclear power plants or a thermal buffer in industrial freezers. = Thermal conductivity = Thermal conductivity of a concrete slab indicates the rate of heat transfer through the solid mass by conduction, usually in regard to heat transfer to or from the ground. The coefficient of thermal conductivity, k, is proportional to density of the concrete, among other factors. The primary influences on conductivity are moisture content, type of aggregate, type of cement, constituent proportions, and temperature. These various factors complicate the theoretical evaluation of a k-value, since each component has a different conductivity when isolated, and the position and proportion of each components affects the overall conductivity. To simplify this, particles of aggregate may be considered to be suspended in the homogeneous cement. Campbell-Allen and Thorne (1963) derived a formula for the theoretical thermal conductivity of concrete. In practice this formula is rarely applied, but remains relevant for theoretical use. Subsequently, Valore (1980) developed another formula in terms of overall density. However, this study concerned hollow concrete blocks and its results are unverified for concrete slabs. The actual value of k varies significantly in practice, and is usually between 0.8 and 2.0 W m‚àí1 K‚àí1. This is relatively high when compared to other materials, for example the conductivity of wood may be as low as 0.04 W m‚àí1 K‚àí1. One way of mitigating the effects of thermal conduction is to introduce insulation . = Thermal mass = The second consideration is the high thermal mass of concrete slabs, which applies similarly to walls and floors, or wherever concrete is used within the thermal envelope. Concrete has a relatively high thermal mass, meaning that it takes a long time to respond to changes in ambient temperature. This is a disadvantage when rooms are heated intermittently and require a quick response, as it takes longer to warm the entire building, including the slab. However, the high thermal mass is an advantage in climates with large daily temperature swings, where the slab acts as a regulator, keeping the building cool by day and warm by night. Typically concrete slabs perform better than implied by their R-value. The R-value does not consider thermal mass, since it is tested under constant temperature conditions. Thus, when a concrete slab is subjected to fluctuating temperatures, it will respond more slowly to these changes and in many cases increase the efficiency of a building. In reality, there are many factors which contribute to the effect of thermal mass, including the depth and composition of the slab, as well as other properties of the building such as orientation and windows. Thermal mass is also related to thermal diffusivity, heat capacity and insulation. Concrete has low thermal diffusivity, high heat capacity, and its thermal mass is negatively affected by insulation (e.g. carpet). = Insulation = Without insulation, concrete slabs cast directly on the ground can cause a significant amount of extraneous energy transfer by conduction, resulting in either lost heat or unwanted heat. In modern construction, concrete slabs are usually cast above a layer of insulation such as expanded polystyrene, and the slab may contain underfloor heating pipes. However, there are still uses for a slab that is not insulated, for example in outbuildings which are not heated or cooled to room temperature . In these cases, casting the slab directly onto a substrate of aggregate will maintain the slab near the temperature of the substrate throughout the year, and can prevent both freezing and overheating. A common type of insulated slab is the beam and block system (mentioned above) which is modified by replacing concrete blocks with expanded polystyrene blocks. This not only allows for better insulation but decreases the weight of slab which has a positive effect on load bearing walls and foundations. Formwork set for concrete pour. Concrete poured into formwork. This slab is ground-bearing and reinforced with steel rebar. Design = Ground-bearing slabs = Ground-bearing slabs, also known as \\"on-ground\\" or \\"slab-on-grade\\", are commonly used for ground floors on domestic and some commercial applications. It is an economical and quick construction method for sites that have non-reactive soil and little slope. For ground-bearing slabs, it is important to design the slab around the type of soil, since some soils such as clay are too dynamic to support a slab consistently across its entire area. This results in cracking and deformation, potentially leading to structural failure of any members attached to the floor, such as wall studs. Levelling the site before pouring concrete is an important step, as sloping ground will cause the concrete to cure unevenly and will result in differential expansion. In some cases, a naturally sloping site may be levelled simply by removing soil from the uphill site. If a site has a more significant grade, it may be a candidate for the \\"cut and fill\\" method, where soil from the higher ground is removed, and the lower ground is built up with fill. In addition to filling the downhill side, this area of the slab may be supported on concrete piers which extend into the ground. In this case, the fill material is less important structurally as the dead weight of the slab is supported by the piers. However, the fill material is still necessary to support the curing concrete and its reinforcement. There are two common methods of filling - controlled fill and rolled fill. * Controlled fill: Fill material is compacted in several layers by a vibrating plate or roller. Sand fills areas up to around 800 mm deep, and clay may be used to fill areas up to 400 mm deep. However, clay is much more reactive than sand, so it should be used sparingly and carefully. Clay must be moist during compaction to homogenise it. * Rolled fill: Fill is repeatedly compacted by an excavator, but this method of compaction is less effective than a vibrator or roller. Thus, the regulations on maximum depth are typically stricter. Proper curing of ground-bearing concrete is necessary to obtain adequate strength. Since these slabs are inevitably poured on-site (rather than precast as some suspended slabs are), it can be difficult to control conditions to optimize the curing process. This is usually aided by a membrane, either plastic (temporary) or a liquid compound (permanent). Ground-bearing slabs are usually supplemented with some form of reinforcement, often steel rebar. However, in some cases such as concrete roads, it is acceptable to use an unreinforced slab if it is adequately engineered . = Suspended slabs = For a suspended slab, there are a number of designs to improve the strength-to-weight ratio. In all cases the top surface remains flat, and the underside is modulated: * A corrugated slab is designed when the concrete is poured into a corrugated steel tray, more commonly called decking. This steel tray improves strength of the slab, and prevents the slab from bending under its own weight. The corrugations run in one direction only. * A ribbed slab gives considerably more strength in one direction. This is achieved with concrete beams bearing load between piers or columns, and thinner, integral ribs in the perpendicular direction. An analogy in carpentry would be a subfloor of bearers and joists. Ribbed slabs have higher load ratings than corrugated or flat slabs, but are inferior to waffle slabs. *A waffle slab gives added strength in both directions using a matrix of recessed segments beneath the slab. This is the same principle used in the ground-bearing version, the waffle slab foundation. Waffle slabs are usually deeper than ribbed slabs of equivalent strength, and are heavier hence require stronger foundations. However, they provide increased mechanical strength in two dimensions, a characteristic important for vibration resistance and soil movement. The exposed underside of a waffle slab used in a multi-storey building = Unreinforced slabs = Unreinforced or \\"plain\\" slabs are becoming rare and have limited practical applications, with one exception being the mud slab . They were once common in the USA, but the economic value of reinforced ground-bearing slabs has become more appealing for many engineers. Without reinforcement, the entire load on these slabs is supported by the strength of the concrete, which becomes a vital factor. As a result, any stress induced by a load, static or dynamic, must be within the limit of the concrete's flexural strength to prevent cracking. Since unreinforced concrete is relatively very weak in tension, it is important to consider the effects of tensile stress caused by reactive soil, wind uplift, thermal expansion, and cracking. One of the most common applications for unreinforced slabs is in concrete roads.  Mud slabs  Mud slabs, also known as rat slabs, are thinner than the more common suspended or ground-bearing slabs (usually 50 to 150 mm), and usually contain no reinforcement. This makes them economical and easy to install for temporary or low-usage purposes such as subfloors, crawlspaces, pathways, paving, and levelling surfaces. In general, they may be used for any application which requires a flat, clean surface. This includes use as a base or \\"sub-slab\\" for a larger structural slab. On uneven or steep surfaces, this preparatory measure is necessary to provide a flat surface on which to install rebar and waterproofing membranes. In this application, a mud slab also prevents the plastic bar chairs from sinking into soft topsoil which can cause spalling due to incomplete coverage of the steel. Sometimes a mud slab may be a substitute for coarse aggregate. Mud slabs typically have a moderately rough surface, finished with a float. Substrate and rebar prepared for pouring a mud slab = Axes of support =  One-way slabs  A one-way slab has moment-resisting reinforcement only in its short axis, and is used when the moment in the long axis is negligible. Such designs include corrugated slabs and ribbed slabs. Non-reinforced slabs may also be considered one-way if they are supported on only two opposite sides (i.e. they are supported in one axis). A one-way reinforced slab may be stronger than a two-way non-reinforced slab, depending on the type of load. The calculation of One Way Slab Reinforcement Details Design is extremely tedious and time-consuming and after give more time is not 100% sure that design is best or not and also if some minor change comes in design if force to calculate full design step again and again Also, there are so many factor work as silent during structure design of one way slab as belove Effective Span * Load Calculation * B.M. Calculation * Effective Depth for flexure * Main steel * Distribution Steel * Check for cracking * Check for Deflection * Check for development * Check for shear  Two-way slabs  A two-way slab has moment resisting reinforcement in both directions. This may be implemented due to application requirements such as heavy loading, vibration resistance, clearance below the slab, or other factors. However, an important characteristic governing the requirement of a two-way slab is the ratio of the two horizontal lengths. If l_x : l_y <2 where l_x is the short dimension and l_y is the long dimension, then moment in both directions should be considered in design. In other words, if the axial ratio is greater than two, a two-way slab is required. A non-reinforced slab is two- way if it is supported in both horizontal axes. Construction A concrete slab may be prefabricated (precast), or constructed on site. = Prefabricated = Prefabricated concrete slabs are built in a factory and transported to the site, ready to be lowered into place between steel or concrete beams. They may be pre-stressed (in the factory), post-stressed (on site), or unstressed. It is vital that the wall supporting structure is built to the correct dimensions, or the slabs may not fit. = On-site = On-site concrete slabs are built on the building site using formwork - a type of boxing into which the wet concrete is poured. If the slab is to be reinforced, the rebars, or metal bars, are positioned within the formwork before the concrete is poured in. Plastic-tipped metal or plastic bar chairs, are used to hold the rebar away from the bottom and sides of the form-work, so that when the concrete sets it completely envelops the reinforcement. This concept is known as concrete cover. For a ground-bearing slab, the formwork may consist only of side walls pushed into the ground. For a suspended slab, the formwork is shaped like a tray, often supported by a temporary scaffold until the concrete sets. The formwork is commonly built from wooden planks and boards, plastic, or steel. On commercial building sites, plastic and steel are gaining popularity as they save labour. On low-budget or small-scale jobs, for instance when laying a concrete garden path, wooden planks are very common. After the concrete has set the wood may be removed, or left there permanently. In some cases formwork is not necessary - for instance, a ground slab surrounded by brick or block foundation walls, where the walls act as the sides of the tray and hardcore (rubble) acts as the base.

This cheese is the claim to fame for the village of Chavignol, France, which has only two hundred inhabitants. History The small cylindrical goat cheese from the area around Chavignol has been produced since the 16th century, but the earliest extant written record dates from 1829 when its name and brief details of the cheese were recorded by a tax inspector.See history of the cheese on the local tourist board website. The etymology is dubious: the word \\"Crot\\" described a small oil lamp made from burned clay, which resembles the mould used to prepare the cheese. Another explanation is that old Crottin gets harder and browner and tends to look like dung, the French word for an animal dropping being crotte. Quality control Protected by the AOC Seal, Crottin de Chavignol is produced today with traditional methods. If a cheese is labelled \\"Crottin de Chavignol\\", it has to be from the area around Chavignol, and it has to meet the stringent AOC production criteria. Flavour and age Retail shop of one of Chavignol's two cheese makers As it ripens (Chavignol bleut√©), it takes on a stronger flavour and develops a harder rind. Crottin de Chavignol is subtle and slightly nutty. In its youth (Chavignol jeune), its dough is solid and compact, and its rind is white. As it ripens (Chavignol bleut√©), it takes on a stronger flavour and develops a harder rind. With full maturity (Chavignol affin√©), the dough becomes crumbly and the mould on the rind matures into a bluish colour. The cheese is marketed and eaten at all three stages of maturity.See Chavignol's own marketing website. Recipes A classic dish is baked Crottin de Chavignol on a green salad. The dish is said to go well with a Sancerre wine from its home region.Wine recommendation on cheese-France website.

History =1991‚Äì1995: Origins= Volcom was founded in 1991 by Richard \\"Wooly\\" Woolcott and Tucker \\"T-Dawg\\" Hall, who based the ethos of the company on their own experiences with boardsports. In March 1991, the two friends went on a snowboarding trip to Tahoe, U.S., and afterward, they decided to start a clothing company for women. Chet Thomas was the first professional skateboarder to be sponsored by the brand. In 1995, Volcom was the first action sports company to create a record label, Volcom Entertainment. =1995‚Äì2011: IPO, Kering and ABG acquisitions= In April 2005, the company adopted its current name, \\"Volcom, Inc.\\" Volcom became a publicly traded entity on June 29, 2005, when Wachovia Securities, D.A. Davidson and Piper Jaffray underwrote an initial public offering on NASDAQ. They priced 4.69 million shares at US$19 a share, raising a total of US$89 million. In early 2008, Volcom made its first acquisition, taking ownership of Electric Visual Evolution LLC for US$25.3 million. In early 2016, Kering announced Eric Crane had acquired the brand from Volcom for an undisclosed amount. On May 2, 2011, French luxury, sport, and lifestyle group Kering (previously known as Pinault-Printemps-Redoute and PPR until 18 June 2013) launched a friendly takeover offer to buy Volcom Inc. for US$24.50 a share, valuing the company at US$608 million. Volcom's board unanimously backed the Kering offer, and shareholders were advised to tender their shares to the French company. Since the takeover, Kering has sought to expand and diversify the Volcom brand. The support from Kering allowed Volcom to launch its first ever closed-toe footwear line in July 2013. On April 3, 2019, Authentic Brands Group had announced it acquired Volcom from Kering. Retail Volcom's first retail store was opened on November 23, 2002, in Los Angeles. Since then, seven more Volcom stores have opened in the United States, and six more in Canada. Outside America, Volcom has numerous international retail stores including locations in Hossegor, Bordeaux, and Paris, France; two locations in Bali, Indonesia; Tokyo, Japan; Durban and Pretoria, South Africa; Bangkok, Thailand; London and Falmouth, England; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Santiago, Chile; Lima, Per√∫; S√£o Paulo, Brazil; Isla de Margarita, Venezuela; Lisbon, Portugal; Munich, Stuttgart, and Berlin, Germany;Davos, Switzerland , Calgary, Edmonton, Vancouver, Winnipeg, and Fort McMurray, Canada, Costa Rica; Amsterdam, the Netherlands and Guam.

Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985. Scholarly estimates regarding the date of the Ascension of Isaiah range anywhere between the final decades of the first century to the early decades of the third century, though scholars prefer some time in the early 2nd century. The reason for this large range in dating is due to the fact that there is virtually no information that allows for a confident dating into any specific period.Hurtado, Larry. Lord Jesus Christ: Devotion to Jesus in Earliest Christianity. Eerdmans, 2005, 595-602. Many scholars believe it to be a compilation of several texts completed by an unknown Christian scribe who claimed to be the Prophet Isaiah, while an increasing number of scholars in recent years have argued that the work is a unity by a single author that may have used utilized multiple sources.Hannah, Darrell D. \\"Isaiah's Vision in the Ascension of Isaiah and the Early Church.\\" The Journal of Theological Studies 50.1 (1999): 84-85. Dating of the text It is generally believed that the text is composed of three different sections written at different times, by different authors.M. A. Knibb - \\"Martyrdom and Ascension of Isaiah (Second Century B.C.-Fourth Century A . D . )\\" in The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha, vol. 2, 1985 The earliest section, regarding chapters 3:13-4:22, was composed at about the end of the first century AD or perhaps early second century and is believed to be a text of Jewish origins which was later on redacted by Christian scribes.C. Detlef G. M√ºller writes (New Testament Apocrypha, vol. 2) The date of the Vision of Isaiah (chapters 6-11) is rather more difficult to determine, but it is no more recent than the third century, since Saint Jerome (c. 347-420 AD) cites a fragment of the work in some of his writings, but from internal evidence it seems that the text is to be placed before the end of the second century AD. The whole work was on a later date assembled as M.A. KinibbM. A. Knibb - \\"Martyrdom and Ascension of Isaiah (Second Century B.C.-Fourth Century A. D.)\\" in The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha, vol. 2, 1985 writes: > It is not known when exactly the three sections of the Ascension were > combined. The Greek fragment (from the 5th-6th cent.), the palimpsest giving > the text of the fragments of the first Latin translation (likewise from the > 5th-6th cent.), and the Ethiopic translation (which was made some time > during the 4th-6th cent.) all presuppose the existence of the complete work. > But the character of the mistakes in the Greek fragment and the Latin > palimpsest suggests that the complete work had already been in existence for > some time when these manuscripts were copied. It thus seems likely that the > three sections of the Ascension were brought together in the third or fourth > century A.D., and this is confirmed by the fact that Jerome seems to have > known the complete book. It is possible that there were two stages in the > process, first the combination of 3:13-4:22 with the Martyrdom, and second > the combination of the enlarged Martyrdom with the Vision. Knibb thus dates the whole text as being written between AD 150 and 200 but assembled at a later time. Most scholars agree that a mid to early second century date for the principal portion of the document is probable, dateable in its present to the least the early part of the second century. Content =Structure= The book has three main sections: *The first part of the book (chapters 1-5), generally referred to as the Martyrdom of Isaiah, recounts and expands on the events of 2 Kings chapter 21. Isaiah warns the dying Hezekiah that his heir, Manasseh, will not follow the same path. When Manasseh takes over, and Isaiah's warning proves true, Isaiah and a group of fellow prophets head into the desert, and a demon named Beliar inspires a false prophet named Belkira to accuse Isaiah of treason. The king consequently condemns Isaiah to death, and although Isaiah hides in a tree, he is found, and Belkira leads the execution. **Into the middle of this (3:13-4:22) is a Christian apocalypse called the Testament of Hezekiah, describing a vision of the coming of Jesus, the subsequent corruption of the Christian church, the rule of Beliar, and the second coming. All of this is phrased in such a way that it is clearly a code for the persecution of the Church by Nero and the belief that Nero was an Antichrist. *The second part of the book (chapters 6-11) is referred to as the Vision of Isaiah and describes an angel-assisted journey, prior to the events of the first part of the book, by Isaiah through the Seven Heavens. In its surviving form it is clearly written from a Christian perspective, concentrating on Jesus' death and his resurrection, and especially the ascension of Jesus. The birth of Jesus is curiously described as being preceded by Jesus descending through each of the heavens, disguising himself as an angel appropriate to each as he goes. The extant complete manuscripts of the Ascension of Isaiah include a brief account of Jesus' nativity, birth, and crucifixion (11:2-22). However, according to Jonathan Knight, \\"the problem with chapter 11 is that these traditions are found in only one branch of the textual tradition, that represented by the Ethiopic translation (E). The Slavonic and one of the two Latin translations (S and L2) replace them with a short summary of the earthly appearance so that their authenticity--including the Marian material--is disputed.\\"Knight, Jonathan, \\"The Portrait of Mary in the Ascension of Isaiah\\", page 96 Elements of the Ascension of Isaiah are paralleled in other Jewish and Christian writings. The method of Isaiah's death (sawn in half by Manasseh) is agreed upon by both the Babylonian Talmud and Jerusalem Talmud and is probably alluded to by the writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews (11:37). The demon Beliar appears in quite a number of apocryphal works, including the Book of Jubilees, the Book of Enoch, the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs, and the Sibylline Oracles. Finally, Isaiah's journey through the Seven Heavens parallels that of Enoch in the Second Book of Enoch. The first section of the text also contains hostility toward the Samaritans, a Jewish sect that claim to be Jews left behind during the Babylonian exile disowned by the remainder. =Proto-Trinitarianism= Some scholars have noted that the Ascension reflects a proto-Trinitarian perspective,Hannah, Darrell D. \\"Isaiah's Vision in the Ascension of Isaiah and the Early Church.\\" The Journal of Theological Studies 50.1 (1999): 90-99. such as when the inhabitants of the sixth heaven sing praises to \\"the primal Father and his Beloved Christ, and the Holy Spirit\\". Larry Hurtado writes; > The most extended narrative of heavenly worship is in 9.27-42, however, > where a similar triadic view is presented. Having reached the seventh > heaven, which is bathed in incomparable light, Isaiah sees innumerable > angels and \\"all the righteous from the time of Adam onwards\\" (9.6-9). Then, > after his angel guide explains how the descent of the Beloved One will make > it possible for the righteous to receive their robes, crowns, and thrones > (9.10-26), Isaiah sees a figure \\"whose glory surpassed that of all\\" being > worshiped by Adam, Abel, and all the other righteous and angels (9.27-28). > Crucially, at this point the angel guide directs Isaiah to \\"Worship this > one,\\" whom the angel identifies as \\"the Lord of all the praise which you > have seen\\" (9.31-32), the Beloved One; Isaiah joins in the worship and sung > praise directed to this figure. Then another glorious figure approaches, > subsequently identified as \\"the angel of the Holy Spirit who has spoken in > you and also in the other righteous\\" (9.36), and Isaiah is likewise told to > join the angels in worshiping this one (9.35-36). Finally, in a carefully > prepared climax to this scene, Isaiah sees \\"the Great Glory\\" (but with his > spirit, for it appears that his eyes are blinded by the light of this glory, > 9.37), and he relates how \\"my Lord\\" and \\"the angel of the Spirit\\" both > offered worship to this third figure, along with \\"all the righteous\\" and the > angels (9.40-42). = Theological controversy = The Ascension of Isaiah suggests early Christian belief in subordinationism, similar to that of Origen and, later, Novatian. The text describes the worship of the \\"Great Glory\\" by the \\"Beloved\\" and the \\"Angel of the Holy Spirit,\\" implying hierarchy in the ranks of the trinity. Further, it is suggested that the angels escorting Isaiah in his ascension are none other than Jesus (\\"the Beloved\\") and the Angel of the Holy Spirit. By the text labeling Jesus and the Holy Spirit as angelic beings, a Christology and pneumatology are established that distinguish \\"the LORD\\" from \\"my LORD\\" and the Holy Spirit. This would be cause to label the story as heretical in the Western Orthodox tradition, along with similar theological beliefs, such as Arianism. Nonetheless, early Jewish-Christians, most likely in the Palestinian region, would have found this story influential in understanding theology, pneumatology and Christology, largely due to its referral to the Hebrew scriptures' prophets. Demons Theological demons noted in the text are: *Belial is the angel of lawlessness (Antinomianism) and is also identified as Samael and Satan. *Samael is identified in the vision that Isaiah experienced, wherein he ascended to the firmament and notes, \\"there I saw Sammael [sic] and his hosts, and there was great fighting therein. ...as above so on the earth [below] also; for the likeness of that which is in the firmament is here on the earth.\\" Samael is also often identified as Malkira (Heb.: ◊û◊ú◊ö ◊®◊¢ melek ra - lit. \\"king of evil\\", \\"king of the wicked\\"; or ◊û◊ú◊ê◊ö ◊®◊¢ malach ra - \\"messenger of evil\\", \\"angel of iniquity\\"), which are all epithets of the false prophet sent by Belial to accuse Isaiah of treason. Composition According to the theory of R. H. Charles,Knight, p. 26. the text incorporates three distinct sections, each once a separate work that is a single compilation here. Of these, one, the first, appears to have been written by a Jewish author, and the other two by Christians. According to this author, The Martyrdom consists of: E. Norelli suggests on the contrary that the whole text, even if written in different times, is the expression of a docetic Christian prophetic group related with the group attacked by Ignatius of Antioch in his letters to the Smyrnaeans and to the Trallians.Norelli 1994, pag. 271 According to this scholar chapters 6-11 (the Vision) are older than chapters 1-5 (which represent a later pessimistic introduction to the original Vision), the date of composition is the end of the 1st century AD, and the narrative of Mary's pregnancy (AI 11:2-5) is independent from the Gospel of Matthew.Norelli 1994, pag. 140 Recently, other scholars have rejected characterizing the Ascension of Isaiah as a docetic text.Hannah, Darrell D. \\"The ascension of Isaiah and docetic christology.\\" Vigiliae christianae 53.2 (1999): 165-196. Manuscript tradition The text exists as a whole in three Ge'ez manuscripts of around the 15th-18th centuries, but fragments have also survived in Greek, Coptic, Latin, and Old Church Slavonic. All three component texts appear to have been in Greek, and it is possible that the \\"Martyrdom of Isaiah\\" derives from a Hebrew or Aramaic original. Comparison of the various translations suggests that two different recensions of the Greek original must have existed; one on which the Ethiopic and one of the Latin versions were based, and the other on which the Slavonic and the other Latin version were based. Fragments of both Greek versions have survived. The work's current title is derived from the title used in the Ethiopic manuscripts ('Ergata ƒ™sƒÅy√®yƒÅs ‚Äì \\"The Ascension of Isaiah\\"). In antiquity, Epiphanius also referred to it by this title (in Greek: Œ§·Ω∏ ŒëŒΩŒ±Œ≤Œ±œÑŒπŒ∫·Ω∏ŒΩ ·º©œÉŒ±ŒêŒøœÖ), as did Jerome (in Latin: Ascensio Isai√¶).

Typhoon. The student newspaper of Kubasaki High School was established in 1964, when the present day Kubasaki High School was opened in Kishaba Terrace. During the late 1960s, the school newspaper gained national and international fame, winning 12 straight All American ratings from the National Scholastic Press Association (NSPA). In 1972, it was shortlisted for the Pacemaker Award as the top high school newspaper in America, edited that year by Joe Van Eaton. Quill and Scroll awarded the Typhoon the George H. Gallup Award for excellence in 1972 (edited by Mark Tunis). John Weldon was principal at this time. The Typhoon has been the only Department of Defense high school to win an All American rating and was under the advisership of Bill Hobbs. The student newspaper was printed locally by Okinawan printers. The Typhoon was the product of both extra-curricular students and the journalism class, taught and advised by Bill Hobbs. Torii. The student yearbook of Kubasaki was founded prior to 1956. In 1967, the Torii began production on a much larger scale, eventually becoming the largest single school Department of Defense high school yearbook with 336 pages in 1973, advised by Bill Hobbs. (This record was eclipsed in 1987 when Focus, student yearbook of Frankfurt (Germany) American High School published an All American book of 352 pages.) In 1971, edited by sophomore Frank Day, the Torii received an All American rating (the first of any DoD high school) by the NSPA. The Torii was printed stateside after the new Kubasaki was established in 1964. Principal Virginia Lee was instrumental in making the yearbook \\"more stateside\\" in its production and Walsworth Publishing CO., with a representative in the Far East advised. In 1973, when the school had almost 2000 students, grade 10 through 12, some 1200 copies were ordered from Taylor Publishing Co. Quill and Scroll honorary journalistic society was established at Kubasaki High School in the spring of 1971, with Teresa Sheehan as its first president. In 1973, under its president Harvey Humphrey, this chapter was named the Bill Hobbs Chapter in honor of its founding adviser. =Athletics= The Kubasaki Dragons compete in interscholastic competition with other DoDDS schools and local Okinawan schools. Kubasaki fields teams in baseball, boys' and girls' basketball, coed cheerleading, girls' and boys' cross country, football, boys' and girls' golf, boys' and girls' soccer, softball, boys' and girls' tennis, boys' and girls' track and field, girls' volleyball, and wrestling. High school students can also join the local Okinawa Dolphins swim team and earn a letter. Football Kubasaki has a legacy of prep football legacy from the start of the Cold War era. As KHS was the only school on the island with active varsity and JV gridiron programs at the time, teams were determined by the general location on-island the players were from. From the 1950s through the 1980s, Kubasaki's legacy teams and colors were Kadena Falcons (blue & white), Sukiran (later Zukeran) Knights (black & white), and Naha Eagles (red & white). The team names, mascots, and colors carried-over to Kubasaki's basketball and wrestling squads. As there was no football field or stadium at Kubasaki's previous campuses (and, until recently, the present Kishaba campus), each team had their respective \\"home field\\" stadium. MacDonald Stadium on Kadena Air Base was home to the Falcons; the Sukiran Knights shared Rambler Field at Sukiran Stadium in the Camp Sukiran Troop Area (now known as Marine Corps Base Camp Foster) with the Army's intramural football team, the Rangers; and the Eagles claimed Naha Field at Naha Air Base as their home turf. By the mid-1970s, a fourth \\"expansion team\\" ‚Äî Kubasaki Warriors (gold & white) ‚Äî was added due to the large post-Vietnam student population and to give those prep athletes an opportunity to play. For regional games against opponents on mainland Japan, an \\"all-star\\" team of top players from all three (and later, four) Kubasaki varsity squads were selected and sported the green and white uniforms of the Kubasaki Dragons. The legacy teams were dissolved with the opening of Kubasaki's new \\"cross-town rivals,\\" Kadena High School on Kadena Air Base in 1981. Kubasaki has the Varsity Dragons and the JV Dragons. At the beginning of the season, these teams are not formed. Instead, they make up the Green Squad and White Squad, and they have scrimmages against themselves. The Kubasaki All-Stars lost the first \\"Cherry Bowl\\" game 30-0 in Yamato Japan (1961) to the Narimasu Dragons; coincidentally, this game was held on the 20th anniversary of Pearl Harbor. They split two games with Kanto Plains champion Yokota High School in the 1970s. From 1982 to 2004, Kubasaki and Kadena High School fielded two teams each to make up the four-team Okinawa Secondary Schools Athletic Association (OSSAA) football league. In 23 seasons, the Kubasaki Samurai won or shared 15 island championships, while the Kubasaki Shogun captured three. At the end of the season, a Dragons varsity team was selected from the Samurai and Shogun and played against Kadena's varsity team. In 1992, the Dragons swept Kadena two games to none and routed Yokota 44-12 in the inaugural Ichiban Bowl. The Kubasaki Dragons won the First Class AA Far East Championship against the Seoul American Falcons 34-14 in 2005, but lost to the Kadena Panthers 2 years in a row in the OAC best two-of-three series 28-14, 14-8 the first year and 45-0, 41-6 in the second.

Thus he was the first person to give the notion of equivalent weight and to publish a table of equivalent weights of acids and bases. Later Jeremias Benjamin Richter produced a larger table of equivalent weights. Wenzel, whose first name is also spelled Karl, was born at Dresden in 1740. Disliking his father's trade of bookbinding, for which he was intended, he left home in 1755, and after taking lessons in surgery and chemistry at Amsterdam, became a ship's surgeon in the Dutch service. In 1766, tired of sea-life, he went to study chemistry at Leipzig, and afterwards devoted himself to metallurgy and assaying at his native place with much success. He died at Freiberg.

The constant appears in a number of sums and integrals, especially those involving gamma functions and zeta functions. It is named after mathematicians James Whitbread Lee Glaisher and Hermann Kinkelin. Its approximate value is: :A\\\\approx1.2824271291\\\\dots . The Glaisher‚ÄìKinkelin constant A can be given by the limit: :A=\\\\lim_{n\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty} \\\\frac{K(n+1)}{n^{n^2/2+n/2+1/12}\\\\,e^{-n^2/4}} where K(n)=\\\\prod_{k=1}^{n-1} k^k is the K-function. This formula displays a similarity between A and which is perhaps best illustrated by noting Stirling's formula: :\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}=\\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\frac{n!}{n^{n+1/2}\\\\,e^{-n}} which shows that just as is obtained from approximation of the function \\\\prod_{k=1}^{n} k, A can also be obtained from a similar approximation to the function \\\\prod_{k=1}^{n} k^k. An equivalent definition for A involving the Barnes G-function, given by G(n)=\\\\prod_{k=1}^{n-2} k!=\\\\frac{\\\\left[\\\\Gamma(n)\\\\right]^{n-1}}{K(n)} where \\\\Gamma(n) is the gamma function is: :A=\\\\lim_{n\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty} \\\\frac{(2\\\\pi)^{n/2} n^{n^2/2-1/12} e^{-3n^2/4+1/12}}{G(n+1)}. The Glaisher‚ÄìKinkelin constant also appears in evaluations of the derivatives of the Riemann zeta function, such as: :\\\\zeta^{\\\\prime}(-1)=\\\\frac{1}{12}-\\\\ln A : \\\\sum_{k=2}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{\\\\ln k}{k^2}=-\\\\zeta^{\\\\prime}(2)=\\\\frac{\\\\pi^2} 6 \\\\left[ 12 \\\\ln A - \\\\gamma-\\\\ln(2\\\\pi)\\\\right] where \\\\gamma is the Euler‚ÄìMascheroni constant. The latter formula leads directly to the following product found by Glaisher: : \\\\prod_{k=1}^\\\\infty k^{1/k^2} = \\\\left(\\\\frac{A^{12}}{2\\\\pi e^\\\\gamma} \\\\right)^{\\\\pi^2/6} An alternative product formula, defined over the prime numbers, reads : \\\\prod_{k=1}^\\\\infty p_k^{1/(p_k^2-1)} = \\\\frac{A^{12}}{2\\\\pi e^\\\\gamma}, where p_k denotes the kth prime number. The following are some integrals that involve this constant: : \\\\int_0^{1/2} \\\\ln\\\\Gamma(x) \\\\, dx = \\\\frac 3 2 \\\\ln A+\\\\frac 5 {24} \\\\ln 2+\\\\frac 1 4 \\\\ln \\\\pi : \\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\frac{x \\\\ln x}{e^{2 \\\\pi x}-1} \\\\, dx = \\\\frac 1 2 \\\\zeta^{\\\\prime}(-1) = \\\\frac 1 {24}-\\\\frac 1 2 \\\\ln A A series representation for this constant follows from a series for the Riemann zeta function given by Helmut Hasse. : \\\\ln A=\\\\frac 1 8 - \\\\frac 1 2 \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac 1 {n+1} \\\\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k \\\\binom n k (k+1)^2 \\\\ln(k+1) References * * (Provides a variety of relationships.) * * External links * The Glaisher‚ÄìKinkelin constant to 20,000 decimal places Category:Mathematical constants Category:Number theory Category:Glaisher family ","title":"Glaisher‚ÄìKinkelin constant"},{"id":"2076834","title":"Alanis (album)"},{"id":"2076836","text":"Tammy Rae Carland (born January 27, 1965), is a photographer, video artist, zine editor, current provost at California College of the Arts (CCA), and former co-owner of the independent lesbian music label Mr. Lady Records and Videos. Her work has been published, screened, and exhibited around the world in galleries and museums in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Berlin, and Sydney. Early life Carland was born in Portland, Maine in 1965. She grew up with 4 siblings and was raised by her single mother. She was the first in her family to graduate from high school. Zines, videos, and music In the late 1980s, while she was studying photography at The Evergreen State College, Carland co-founded the independent art gallery Reko Muse (a.k.a. wreck-o-muse) in Olympia, Washington with fellow photography student, Kathleen Hanna and another friend, Heidi Arbogast. They formed a band, Amy Carter, who performed during art exhibitions. Kathleen Hanna often did spoken word performances at the gallery. Local band, Nirvana, led by Kurt Cobain, periodically played benefit shows to support the gallery. After Amy Carter broke up, Carland remained friends with Hanna. She collaborated on the record art for Hanna‚Äôs band, Bikini Kill. Carland is also the namesake of the Bikini Kill song \\"For Tammy Rae\\" off the album Pussy Whipped. She also collaborated on album art for bands such as The Fakes and The Butchies. Hanna contributed to Carland‚Äôs next project, the independently produced fanzine, I (heart) Amy Carter. Other contributors included Donna Dresch of the queercore band, Team Dresch. Carland‚Äôs zine writings have been republished in A Girl's Guide to Taking Over the World edited by Karen Green and Tristan Taormino and The Riot Grrrl Collection edited by Lisa Darms. After the zine's demise, Carland turned her focus to photography and filmmaking. Excerpts from her film Lady Outlaws and Faggot Wannabes are included in the documentary film She's Real, Worse Than Queer by Lucy Thane, and Carland is also interviewed in this film. She has also been a contributor to Joanie4Jackie, a film compilation zine created by Miranda July, which featured Dear Mom and Becky 1977 in the first and second issues respectively. Her videos Live From Somewhere, Odd Girl Out, and Lady Outlaws and Faggot Wannabes have screened nationally and internationally. From 1997-2005, Carland ran, in partnership, Mr. Lady Records and Videos. Mr. Lady was an independent record label and video distribution company dedicated to promoting feminist and queer culture. Mr. Lady released recordings by The Butchies, Kaia Wilson (Carland's ex-partner and Mr. Lady co-founder), and Le Tigre. Photography Carland's photographs appear in the book The Passionate Camera: Photography and Bodies of Desire edited by Deborah Bright and Lesbian Art in America edited by Harmony Hammond. Carland has several bodies of work that have been shown in museums and galleries. She is currently represented by Jessica Silverman Gallery. Carland has described herself as a maker rather than a documentarian, with regard to her art practice. In general, her photographs are carefully staged rather than captured in the moment. She has cited Bernd and Hilla Becher, Felix Gonzales-Torres and Imogen Cunningham as influences, especially on her \\"Lesbian Beds\\" series. The series contains photographs of her friends' unmade beds, all taken from the same aerial perspective, just minutes after being vacated. In the series \\"Horror Girls\\", Carland dresses up to recreate scenes and characters from horror movies. In \\"On Becoming: Billy and Katie 1964\\" Carland creates snapshot portraits of her dressed as her parents. \\"Photoback\\" is a series in which she photographed found photos that have captions hand written on the backs. \\"Keeping House\\" is a series Carland did with Kaia Wilson, staging scene from their home life together. The series \\"Post Partum Portraits\\" was created after Carland became a mother.

This village is located on a narrow isthmus which separates the southern end of Bras d'Or Lake, known as St. Peter's Inlet, to the north from St. Peter's Bay on the Atlantic Ocean to the south. The isthmus is crossed by the St. Peters Canal which is almost exclusively used by pleasure boats in recent decades. It is home to Battery Provincial Park. This park is situated on a hillside overlooking St. Peter‚Äôs Bay adjacent to the St. Peter‚Äôs Canal National Historic Site. Its entrance is on the east side of the bridge at the canal. Battery features a small saltwater beach (unsupervised), an interpretive display, picnic area with ocean frontage, and 3 kilometres /1.8 miles of hiking trails. St. Peter's is also located on Trunk 4, one of the province's trunk or secondary highways. An expressway, Highway 104, is scheduled to be extended from its present terminus several kilometres west of St. Peter's to Sydney. When this occurs, Highway 104 will carry the Trans- Canada Highway designation on Cape Breton Island, for which Highway 105 is now designated. The Nicholas Denys Museum is located in the village, but is only open in the summer. St. Peter's used to be served by a Canadian National Railways branch line which was abandoned in the early 1980s. History =French colony (1630-1758)= Monument on the site of Denys' post at Saint- Pierre. The south entrance to the Canal is in the background. St. Peter's is one of North America's oldest European establishments. Prior to the arrival of the French, it was a Portuguese trading and fishing post named Santo Pedro in the 16th century. It was abandoned by Portugal in the early 17th century, and taken over by France in the 1630s when a small fortified settlement named Saint-Pierre (again named for Saint Peter) was built by merchants from La Rochelle, France on the isthmus. In 1650, La Rochelle merchant Nicholas Denys took possession of Saint-Pierre and encouraged the fur trade with local members of the Mi'kmaq Nation who used the isthmus as a canoe portage route between the Atlantic Ocean and Bras d'Or Lake. In addition to establishing a fur trading post, Denys later used the isthmus as a \\"haulover road\\" for portaging small sailing ships from Bras d'Or Lake to the Atlantic and vice versa.  Raid on Saint-Pierre (1653)  In 1653, along with raiding Pentagouet (Castine, Maine), LaHave, Nova Scotia, and Nipisguit (Bathurst, New Brunswick), Emmanuel Le Borgne with 100 men also raided Saint-Pierre. Denys was taken prisoner and returned to France. Nicolas Denys was here between 1650‚Äì1669 and then Cape Breton remained unsettled by Europeans until the establishment of Louisbourg and re-establishment of Fort Dauphin (Englishtown, Nova Scotia) and Saint Peters 1713-1758.  Re-established 1713  Jean- Baptiste Hertel de Rouville France lost possession of present-day peninsular (mainland) Nova Scotia to Britain in the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. France began moving some Acadian colonists to √éle Royale (present-day Cape Breton Island) to populate this remaining outpost of French Acadia. Port Toulouse‚Äînamed after Louis Alexandre, Count of Toulouse‚Äîwas created by Jean- Baptiste Hertel de Rouville near the 17th-century location of the fortified community of Saint-Pierre as a logistics base and supply centre for the Fortress of Louisbourg. To protect Port Toulouse, Rouville built another fortification on the shore called Point J√©rome. A colonial military officer of New France, Rouville is best known in North America for leading the raid on Deerfield, Province of Massachusetts Bay on 29 February 1704 and was widely reviled by the settlers of New England for his tactics of raiding poorly defended settlements. Along with Saint-Pierre, the French also established Fort St. Anne at present-day Englishtown as the other garrison on √éle Royal to support the Fortress of Louisbourg.  Siege of St. Peter's  Closeup of plaque on Denys' monument. During King George's War, just prior to the Siege of Louisbourg (1745), the village was attacked in the Siege of Port Toulouse. In August 1752 during Father Le Loutre's War, the schooners Friendship of Halifax and Dolphin of New England were seized and 21 prisoners held for ransom by Mi'kmaq at St. Peter's. During the French and Indian War, after the final Siege of Louisbourg (1758), the forts at Port Toulouse and the settlements in the area were destroyed by the British and the rest of √éle Royale became a British colony. =British colony (1758-1867)= Monument marking location of Laurence Kavanagh's home, St. Peter's, Nova Scotia After Louisbourg fell on 26 July 1758, French officer Boish√©bert withdrew, with the British in pursuit. Boishebert brought back a large number of Acadians from the region around Port Toulouse to the security of his post at Beaubears Island on the Miramichi River. (On 13 August 1758 French officer Boishebert left Miramichi, New Brunswick with 400 soldiers, including Acadians from Port Toulouse, for Fort St. George (Thomaston, Maine). His detachment reached there on 9 September but was caught in an ambush and had to withdraw. They then went on to raid Friendship, Maine, where people were killed and others taken prisoner.The history of the state of Maine: from its first discovery, A. D ..., Volume 2 By William Durkee Williamson, p. 333 This was Boish√©bert‚Äôs last Acadian expedition. From there, Boishebert and the Acadians went to Quebec and fought in the Battle of Quebec (1759).) After the war, Britain sponsored settlers and displaced veterans from the Seven Years' War to move into the area of Port Toulouse. France declared war on Great Britain on 1 February 1793 during the French Revolutionary Wars. In response, Britain built Fort Dorchester on the summit of Mount Granville, a hill overlooking the isthmus. The village of St. Peter's was founded early in the 1800s. Local residents rehabilitated Denys's old \\"haulover road\\", laying wood skids for portaging small sailing ships across the isthmus. The route through Bras d'Or Lake was considered a much shorter and safer voyage to Sydney than travelling around the exposed southern coast of Cape Breton Island. In 1825 a feasibility study into building a canal was undertaken. Construction of the St. Peters Canal began in 1854 and took 15 years of digging, blasting and drilling through a solid granite hill to build a channel with an average width of 30 m (100 ft). The canal opened in 1869 at the dawn of the industrial age on Cape Breton Island. There can be a tidal difference of up to 1.4 m (4.5 ft), thus a double-lock system was designed to regulate water levels. The lock is the only one of its kind in North America. = World wars = The walls of the canal were lined with timber planking and locks were installed at each end. Modifications to the canal and lock continued until 1917 and the canal saw moderate to heavy use by small coastal steamships and barges, particularly during the First and Second World Wars when coal from the Sydney Coal Field was transported on this sheltered inland route to avoid U-boats. A marble quarry on the western shore of Bras d'Or Lake at Marble Mountain also generated some shipping traffic. The canal was designated a National Historic Site in 1929 and the federal government took over its operation. Parks Canada is the government agency responsible for its maintenance and operation and undertook a major project to restore both entrances to the canal in 1985. During the post-war, commercial shipping has largely avoided traveling through Bras d'Or Lake and the canal is almost exclusively used by pleasure boats, particularly sailboats with the increased popularity of cruising Bras d'Or Lake in recent decades. Parks Canada operates the canal from May to October each year. Vessels transiting the canal are limited by the size of the lock, which measures , , and . The ruins of Nicholas Denys's Fort Saint-Pierre are located on the grounds of the lockmaster's house (ca. 1876), and the ruins of Fort Dorchester are located on Mount Granville, which overlooks the Atlantic approach to the canal. =Heritage designations= St. Peters contains two National Historic Sites: #St. Peters National Historic Site, covering the archaeological remains of Fort Saint-Pierre and Port-Toulouse; and #St. Peters Canal National Historic Site The 1876 Lockmaster's House beside the canal is a Recognized Federal Heritage Building, while the circa 1870 MacAskill House, the birthplace of photographer Wallace MacAskill, is a Provincially Registered Property.

A desire among some automotive enthusiasts in the United States is to push \\"styling and performance a step beyond the showroom floor - to truly craft an automobile of one's own.\\" A custom car in British according to Collins English Dictionary is built to the buyer's own specifications. Although the two are related, custom cars are distinct from hot rods. The extent of this difference has been the subject of debate among customizers and rodders for decades. Additionally, a street rod can be considered a custom. Custom cars are not to be confused with coachbuilt automobiles, historically rolling chassis fitted with luxury bodywork by specialty body builders. History The iconic \\"T-bucket\\" custom, with characteristic exposed engine, flat windshield, headers, and open pipes. Soft top (shown) is optional. Also features chrome five-spoke wheels, dropped tube axle, transverse front leaf spring, front disc brakes, open-face aircleaner, Weiand valve covers, and single 4-barrel (probably a QJ). Model A with Edelbrock head and chrome carb hats on late-model flatty A development of hot rodding, the change in name corresponded to the change in the design of the cars being modified. The first hot rods were pre-World War II cars, with running boards and simple fenders over the wheels. Early model cars (1929 to 1934) were modified by removing the running boards and either removing the fenders entirely or replacing them with light cycle fenders. Later models usually had fender skirts installed. The \\"gow job\\" morphed into the hot rod in the early to middle 1950s.Shelton, Chris. \\"Then, Now, and Forever\\" in Hot Rod, March 2017, p.16. Typical of builds from before World War II were 1935 Ford wire wheels.Shelton, Chris. \\"Then, Now, and Forever\\" in Hot Rod, March 2017, p.18. Many cars were \\"hopped up\\" with engine modifications such as adding additional carburetors, high compression heads, and dual exhausts. Engine swaps were often done, with the objective of placing the most powerful engine in the lightest possible frame and body combination. The suspension was usually altered, initially by lowering the rear end as much as possible using lowering blocks on the rear springs. Later cars were given a rake job by either adding a dropped front axle or heating front coil springs to make the front end of the car much lower than the rear. Immediately postwar, most rods would change from mechanical to hydraulic (\\"juice\\") brakes and from bulb to sealed-beam headlights.Shelton, Chris. \\"Then, Now, and Forever\\" in Hot Rod, March 2017, pp.18 and 20. The mid-1950s and early 1960s custom Deuce was typically fenderless and steeply chopped, and almost all Ford (or Mercury, with the flatty, introduced in 1939Shelton, p.20.); a Halibrand quick-change rearend was also typical, and an Edelbrock intake manifold or Harman and Collins ignition magneto would not be uncommon.Shelton, pp.17-18. Reproduction spindles, brake drums, and backing based on the 1937s remain available today. Aftermarket flatty heads were available from Barney Navarro,Shelton, p.20 caption. Vic Edelbrock, and Offenhauser. The first intake manifold Edelbrock sold was a \\"slingshot\\" design for the flatty. Front suspension hairpins were adapted from sprint cars, such as the Kurtis Krafts.Shelton, p.24 and p.26 caption. The first Jimmy supercharger on a V8 may have been by Navarro in 1950.Shelton, p.26 caption. Much later, rods and customs swapped the old solid rear axle for an independent rear, often from Jaguar. Sometimes the grille of one make of car replaced another; the 1937 Buick grille was often used on a Ford. In the 1950s and 1960s, the grille swap of choice was the 1953 DeSoto. The original hot rods were plainly painted like the Model A Fords from which they had been built up, and only slowly begun to take on colors, and eventually fancy orange-yellow flamed hoods or \\"candy-like\\" deep acrylic finishes in the various colors. With the change in automobile design to encase the wheels in fenders and to extend the hood to the full width of the car, the former practices were no longer possible. In addition, tremendous automotive advertising raised public interest in the new models in the 1950s. Thus, custom cars came into existence, swapping headlamp rings, grilles, bumpers, chrome side strips, and taillights as well as frenching and tunnelling head- and taillights. The bodies of the cars were changed by cutting through the sheet metal, removing bits to make the car lower, welding it back together, and adding lead to make the resulting form smooth (hence the term lead sled; Bondo has since largely replaced lead.) Chopping made the roof lowerRod Action, 2/78, p.64. while sectioningStreet Rodder, 2/78, p.15; Custom Rodder 1/97, p.29. made the body thinner from top to bottom. ChannelingJezek, George. \\"The All Deuce Round-Up\\", in Street Rodder, 2/78, p.58. was cutting notches in the floorpan where the body touches the frame to lower the whole body. Fins were often added from other cars, or made up from sheet steel. In the custom car culture, someone who merely changed the appearance without also substantially improving the performance was looked down upon. Juxtapoz Magazine, founded by the artist Robert Williams, has covered Kustom Kulture art. Customization style '55-7 Chevy with fuzzy dice Custom cars are distinct from cars in stock condition. Builders may adopt the visual and performance characteristics of some relevant modification styles, and combine these as desired. There are now several different custom themes, including: * Rat rod: imitates (or exaggerates) the \\"unfinished\\" and amateur-built appearance of hot rods of the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s * Restomod - restored and modernized. Safety and convenience upgrades, such as disc brakes, AC, etc., but can include fuel injection and overdrive upgrades, etc. Externally might resemble a stock car with period correct mods rather than customs. * Street machines: Typically American cars with large-displacement engines modified for speed and often appearance. * Street rod - consist largely of period specific vehicles and components, or emulate visual characteristics of cars through the'40s vintage. There is a great deal of overlap here with hot rods. Features The Reactor (show rod) by Gene Winfield shows paint fade style blending from one color to another =Paint= Moon tank, reminiscent of Chapouris' California Kid Paint was an important concern. Once bodywork was done, the cars were painted unusual colors. Transparent but wildly colored candy-apple paint, applied atop a metallic undercoat, and metalflake paint, with aluminum glitter within candy-apple paint, appeared in the 1960s. These took many coats to produce a brilliant effect ‚Äì which in hot climates had a tendency to flake off. This process and style of paint job was invented by Joe Bailon, a customizer from Northern California. Customizers also continued the habit of adding decorative paint after the main coat was finished, of flames extending rearward from the front wheels, scallops, and hand-painted pinstripes of a contrasting color. The base color, most often a single coat, would be expected to be of a simpler paint. Flame jobs later spread to the hood, encompassing the entire front end, and have progressed from traditional reds and yellows to blues and greens and body-color \\"ghost\\" flames. One particular style of flames, called \\"crab claw flames\\", which is still prevalent today, is attributed to Dean Jeffries.Hotrod magazine, 1999. Painting has become such a part of the custom car scene that now in many custom car competitions, awards for custom paint are as highly sought after as awards for the cars themselves. =Engine swaps= Engine swaps have always been commonplace. Once, the Ford flathead V8 engine was the preference, supplanted by the early hemi in the 1950s and 1960s. By the 1970s, the small- block Chevy was the most common option, and since the 1980s, the Chevy has been almost ubiquitous.See any issue of Street Rodder, for instance. The Chevrolet LS has begun replacing the 350. Flatheads and early hemis have not entirely disappeared, but ready availability, ease of maintenance, and low cost of parts make the Chevrolet V8, in particular the first and third generation small block, the most frequent engine of choice. Once customizing post-war cars caught on, some of the practices were extended to pre-war cars, which would have been called fendered rods, with more body work done on them. An alternate rule for disambiguation developed: hot rods had the engine behind the front suspension, while customs had the engine over the front suspension. The clearest example of this is Fords prior to 1949 had Henry Ford's old transverse front suspension, while 1949 models had a more modern suspension with the engine moved forward. However, an American museum has what could be the first true custom, built by Cletus Clobes in 1932, among its exhibits. With the coming of the muscle car, and further to the high-performance luxury car, customization declined. One place where it persisted was the U.S. Southwest, where lowriders were built similar in concept to the earlier customs, but of post-1950s cars. As the supply of usable antique steel bodies has decreased, companies such Westcott's,Street Rodder, 2/78, p.44. Harwood, Gibbon FiberglassStreet Rodder, 2/78, p. 43. and Speedway Motors have begun to fabricate new fiberglass copies,See, for instance, Street Rodder, 8/99, p.183. while Classic Manufacturing and Supply, for one example, has been making a variety of new steel bodies since the 1970s.Street Rodder, 7/94, pp.132-4. California's \\"junker\\" (or \\"crusher\\") law, which pays a nominal sum to take \\"gross polluters\\" off the road, has been criticized by enthusiasts (and by SEMA) for accelerating this trend.See, for instance, Dick Wells column \\"SRMA Update\\", Street Rodder, 8/99, p.234. Starting in the 1950s, it became popular among customizers to display their vehicles at drive-in restaurants, such as Johnie's Broiler in Downey, California. The practice continues in Southern California. Customizers Examples of notable customizers include George Barris, Vini Bergeman, Bill Cushenberry, the Alexander Brothers, Gil Ayala,Rod & Custom, 8/89, p.60.

Chip Foose,Bishop, Mike, \\"The 45th Grand National Roadster Show\\", in American Rodder, 6/94, p.27. and Pete Chapouris. Others, such as Von Dutch, are best known as custom painters. Several customizers have become famous beyond the automobile community, including Barris, Jeffries, and Coddington, thanks to their proximity to Hollywood; Barris designed TV's Batmobile, while Chapouris built the flamed '34 three-window coup√© in the eponymous telefilm \\"The California Kid\\". Another Barris creation, Ala Kart (a '29 Ford Model A roadster pickup), made numerous appearances in film (usually in the background of diner scenes and such), after taking two AMBR wins in a row. Some customizers have become well-enough known to be referred to by given name alone. These include Boyd (Coddington), Pete (Chapouris), and Jake (Jim Jacobs). Awards The highest award for customizers is the AMBR (America's Most Beautiful Roadster) trophy, presented annually at the Grand National Roadster Show since 1948 (also known within the customizer community as the Oakland Roadster Show until it was moved to Southern California in 2003). This competition has produced famous, and radical, customs. Another is the Ridler Award, presented at the Detroit Autorama since 1964 in honor of show promoter Don Ridler. With one of the most unusual of car show entry requirements, winners of the prestigious Ridler Award are selected as the most outstanding from among cars being shown for the first time. This prompts builders of many high-end roadsters to first enter the Autorama first and then the Grand National show in order to have the chance to win top honors at both shows. Few cars and owners can claim this achievement. Notable customs 'Big Daddy' Roth 'bloodshot eyeball' shift knob was a 1960s craze. Some customs gained attention for winning the AMBR trophy, or for their outlandish styling. Notable among these is Silhouette and Ed Roth's Mysterion. Some of these more unusual projects turned into Hot Wheels cars, among them The Red Baron. Other custom cars became notable for appearances in film (such as Ala Kart {1958},Hot Rod, 12/86, p.29 sidebar. The California Kid three-window {1973},Hot Rod, 12/86, p.29. or the yellow deuce from \\"American Graffiti\\" {1973}) or television (such as The Monkeemobile, the \\"Munsters\\" hearse, or, more recently, Boyd's full-custom Tool Time '34, or Don Thelan'sGingerelli, Dain. \\"Jake's '34\\". Written on June 23, 2005 Hot Rod Magazine online (retrieved 19 June 2015) '33 three-window, Eliminator, built for the ZZ Top video). Specialist vehicles, such as the T/A, KITT, from Knight Rider, are not usually considered customs, but movie or TV cars, because they retain a mostly stock exterior. Still others exemplified a trend. One of these is the '51 Merc built by the Barris brothers for Bob Hirohata in 1953, known forever after as the Hirohata Merc. Even without an appearance in film (\\"Runnin' Wild\\"), it is iconic of 1950s customs, and of how to do a Merc right.Rod & Custom, 8/89, pp.8 & 10. The same year, Neil Emory and Clayton Jensen of Valley Custom Shop built Polynesian for Jack Stewart, starting with a '50 Holiday 88 sedan.Custom Rodder online (retrieved 28 July 2018) Polynesian made the cover of Hot Rod in August, and saw 54 pages of construction details in Motor Trend Custom Car Annual in 1954.Rod & Custom, 8/89, p.68. Language A roadster with Kelsey- Hayes wire wheels Certain linguistic conventions are followed among rodders and customizers: * The model year is rarely given in full,For instance, Street Rodder, 8/99, passim; Rod Action, 2/78, passim; Hot Rod, October 1987, pp,8, 10, 18, 20, & 22. except when it might be confused, so a 1934 model is a '34, while a 2005 might be an '05 or not. ** A '32 is usually a Deuce and most often a roadster, unless coup√© is specified, and almost always a Ford, now commonly on A frame rails.Fortier, Rob. \\"\\"A Little Pinch Here, A Little Tuck There\\", in Street Rodder, 8/99, p.136. ** A 1955, 1956, or 1957 is usually a Chevrolet. ** A 1955, 1956, or 1957 Chevrolet is often called a Tri-Five. * A 3- or 5-window is usually a Ford, unless specified. * A flatty is a flathead V8American Rodder, 6/94, pp.45 & 93. (always Ford, unless specified); a late (or late model) flatty is probably a Merc. * A hemi (\\"hem ee\\") is always a 426, unless displacement (331, 354, or 392) is specified;Geisert, Eric. \\"Tom's Fun Run\\", in Street Rodder, 8/99, p.149cap. a 426 is a hemi, unless Wedge is specified. See baby hemi. * A 392 is an early hemi. ** A 331 or 354 is known to be an (early) hemi, but rarely referred to as such * A 270 \\"Jimmy\\" was a 270 cubic inch GMC truck engine often used to replace a smaller displacement Chevrolet six cylinder. * Units are routinely dropped, unless they are unclear, so a 426 cubic inch (in3) displacement engine is simply referred to as a 426, a 5-liter (litre) displacement engine is a 5.0 (\\"five point oh\\"), and a 600 cubic feet per minute (cfm) carburetor is a 600. Engine displacement can be described in cubic inches or liters (for example, a 5.7-liter engine is also known as a 350 {\\"three fifty\\"}); this frequently depends on which units the user is most comfortable or familiar with.Freiburger, David. \\"Hot Rod Dictionary\\", in Hot Rod, July 1993, p.45. The \\"cutoff year\\" as originally promoted by the National Street Rod Association (NSRA) is 1949. Many custom car shows will only accept 1948 and earlier models as entries, and many custom car organizations will not admit later model cars or trucks (also with some imports - this has been a gray area of what's acceptable e.g. an aircooled VW Beetle, a Big Three product manufactured overseas e.g. a Ford Capri built in the UK or a General Motors - Holden's product, not to mention captives), and/or a vintage import automobile with an American driveline transplant but this practice is subject to change. Modern day custom car shows which allow the inclusion of muscle cars have used the 1972 model year as the cutoff since it is considered the end of the muscle car era prior to the introduction of the catalytic converter. The NSRA has announced that starting in 2011 it will switch to a shifting year method where any owner with a car 30 years or older will be allowed membership. So in 2011 the owner of a 1981 model year vehicle will qualify, then in 2012 the owner of a 1982 model year vehicle will quality, and so on. Additionally, the Goodguys car show organization has moved the year limit for its \\"rod\\" shows from 1949 to 1954 in recent years. =Types= * Hi-Riser (automobile) * Hot rod * Kustom (cars) * Lead sled * Lowrider * Rat rod * Rice burner * Three window coupe =Common terms= Front suspension of a lowboy Deuce roadster, with color-matched springs on coilover shocks, tube axle, and vented disc brakes.

Mic-O-Say's ceremonies, customs, and traditions are loosely based on the folklore of the American Indian. Both councils use both the Tribe of Mic-O-Say and the Order of the Arrow. Tribe of Mic-O-Say History H. Roe Bartle (c.1925) Scout Executive of the St Joseph Area Council Mic-O-Say was founded in 1925 at Camp Brinton near Agency, Missouri under the guidance of H. Roe Bartle, who was the Scout executive of the St. Joseph Council, now Pony Express Council. Bartle combined his experiences in Wyoming with the St. Joseph Council's existing honor organization called Manhawka. Bartle was inspired to create the organization after serving as the Scout Executive for the Cheyenne Council of the Boy Scouts of America in Casper, Wyoming, in 1922. Bartle became interested in the heritage and culture of the many Indian reservations in Wyoming. He spent many hours listening to stories about the Indian tribes and soon began to incorporate Indian values and ideals into his Scouting program. Bartle was inducted into a local tribe of Arapaho based on a reservation served by the Scout council, and according to traditional Mic-O-Say legend, was given the name Lone Bear by the Chief. Bartle started as Scout Executive in St. Joseph, January 1925. The idea of Mic-O-Say was well formed from the moment he arrived. There already existed a camp society there called Manhawka, established by a previous executive. Bartle familiarized himself with the rudiments of it, and incorporated them into his central theme of an Indian- like society based on the principles of the Scout Oath. Bartle named the society \\"Micosay.\\" A hyphenated version was used shortly after and remains popular today, though the non-hyphenated version can still be used. Camp Geiger, which succeeded Camp Brinton in 1935, is considered the 'mother' Tribe of Mic-O-Say. Bartle was \\"The Chief,\\" and conducted all the early ceremonies personally, placing an eagle claw around the neck of each new member and bestowing their Tribal Name upon them. He built up the tribe during the next few years. Example of claws worn by Pony Express Council Tribesmen Example of claws worn by Heart of America Council Tribesmen In the fall of 1928, Bartle became the Scout executive of the Kansas City Area Council. Mic-O-Say had increased both Scouting and summer camp attendance in leaps and bounds, and he established another Mic-O-Say program at Camp Dan Sayre near Noel, Missouri, in 1929, the first summer there. Another honor program known as the 4Ms existed there at the time. In 1930 Camp Osceola opened near Osceola, Missouri, and remains open to this day, renamed the H. Roe Bartle Scout Reservation, or commonly known as \\"Bartle.\\" The tribe flourished and expanded rapidly at both Camps. The mother tribe in St. Joseph remained and grew. In 2014 the 20,000th tribesman was inducted into the Camp Geiger tribe. The 75th anniversary celebration of the program at the H. Roe Bartle Scout Reservation included thousands of members of the Tribe, including the current and previous Chief Scout Executives. Purpose The purpose of Mic-O-Say is to reinforce the principles of the Scout Oath and Law, and to encourage continued participation in Scouting. Mic-O-Say Membership is conferred upon Scouts who participate in long-term camping and who best exemplify progress in their leadership skills. Organization In the Heart of America Council, the Council of Chieftains, She-She-Be Council, and Tribal Council lead the tribe. Their official publications are the Customs and Traditions booklet, Cedar Smoke newsletter, and Inner Circle magazines. Tapping Ceremony - Pony Express Council In the Pony Express Council, the Council of Chieftains and the Tribal Council lead the tribe. Their official publications are the Redbook and most recently Make Talk Now which is an electronic video version of the former Make Talk magazine and available for viewing on the Mic-O-Say website.

As a result, the canal requires special \\"double\\" gates, the only ones of their kind in North America. The usual canal lock has a gate at each end, each gate consisting of two swinging doors that when closed form a shallow 'V' shape, with the point of the 'V' pointing upstream. At the St. Peter's Canal lock each gate consists of four swinging doors which form a diamond shape when closed. In actual use the pair of doors which form the upstream pointing 'V' are used. No matter which side has the higher water level, either one pair or the other will be appropriate. Vessels transiting the canal are limited by the size of the lock, which measures long, wide, draught and air draught of . A swing bridge over the canal has of clearance when closed and is operated from the bridge house on Denys Street. St. Peters Canal is the only working canal of national historic significance in Atlantic Canada and an important historic landmark for the Village of St. Peter's and for Cape Breton Island. St. Peters Canal is part of a nationwide family of over 900 national historic sites, including 9 operating canals. Hours of operation Prior to 2013, the canal operated from November 1 to mid-May, weather permitting, on a 24 hours' advance notice requirement. It operated seven days a week, from mid-May to mid-October each year, continuing with five-day-a-week operation (Monday to Friday) from mid-October to October 31. Through the early peak season (mid-June to mid-August) the canal was open for navigation from 8:00 am to 8:30 pm each day. The remainder of the peak season (mid-August to Labour Day) the hours were 8:00 am to 7:30 pm. In 2013 season Parks Canada reduced service to three days a week from May 17 to Jun 23, expanding to seven days a week operation from June 24 to September 8 and two days a week operation from September 9 to 22 (extended to October 14, 2013). The daily hours of operation were also cut back, with closure at 6:00 pm each day until August 11 when the closing time fell back to 4:00 pm. St. Peter's Canal handles about 1,000 transits a year. By its own estimate, Parks Canada believed 15 per cent of those boaters would be affected by the reduced hours of operation. In December 2015 seven-day-a-week operation was restored to the May 10 to June 26, 2016 operation period.

Steamer \\"Marion\\" Entering the First Locks on St. Peter's Canal, cir.1890 History The area had long been travelled by the Mi'kmaq people who portaged their canoes across the isthmus. A \\"haulover road\\" across the isthmus established by French fur trader Nicholas Denys in 1650 predated the canal. A feasibility study was conducted in 1825 into the possibility of building a canal. Construction began in 1854 and was completed in 1869, resulting in a channel measuring 800 m (2,600 ft) long and an average of 30 m (100 ft) wide. The canal passes through a 20 m (66 ft) high hill composed of solid granite, accounting for the 15 years for its construction. There can be a tidal difference of up to 1.4 m (4.5 ft) between Bras d'Or Lake and the Atlantic Ocean, thus a lock was designed to regulate water levels. The original works were designed to take vessels of 4 m (13 ft) draft but were deepened to 5.5 m (18 ft) between 1875 and 1881. The St. Peters Canal saw relatively heavy use by commercial shipping in the 19th century and early 20th century, during an era of industrial expansion on Cape Breton Island. Additions and renovations, widening the channel and lengthening the locks, continued until 1917. The canal eventually became too small for modern ships and has been used primarily by pleasure boats since the end of the Second World War. The canal continues to serve both pleasure craft and commercial vessels travelling to and from the Bras d‚ÄôOr Lakes, with about 1000 lockages recorded for the years 2003 and 2004. The canal was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1929 and was under the jurisdiction of the Federal Department of Railways and Canals and its successor, Transport Canada up to 1972, when administration of the canal and associated property was transferred to Parks Canada who continue to operate and maintain the site today. The Lockmaster's house built in 1876 is a ‚Äúrecognized‚Äù heritage building according to the Federal Heritage Building Review Office (FHBRO). Parks Canada undertook a major project to restore both entrances to the canal in 1985. The St. Peters Canal is operational from May to October each year. The current swing bridge, installed in its present location in 1931, is the fourth bridge to span the canal; previous ones were installed in 1869, 1876 and 1919. Swing bridge replacement The old one-lane swing bridge was constructed in 1936. The bridge was almost 80 years old and was nearing the end of its lifecycle. Routine inspections identified the bridge as needing some upgrades to meet current standards. Parks Canada considered continuing to perform repairs but a full bridge replacement was deemed to be more cost effective. The old bridge still met all safety requirements, and underwent regular bridge inspections to ensure public safety until it was replaced. In August 2014 Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) issued a Notice of Preferred Procurement (NPP) for the design phase of a new swing bridge for the St. Peters Canal. According to Parks Canada external relations officer Maria O‚ÄôHearn, this step was the first in a three-year process that saw construction of a new two-lane swing bridge begin in 2016, with the new structure replacing the former one- lane bridge a year later. On 20 November 2014 this tender was awarded to PARSONS INC. of Gloucester, Ontario. The project was estimated to cost $10 million (final cost closer to $16 million) and was overseen by Parks Canada as the bridge is part of a national historic site. The new two-lane bridge was built adjacent to the existing one-lane structure. Contracts for the construction went out during the winter of 2016-2017 with the work beginning in March 2017. The new two lane bridge opened slightly behind schedule to boat and vehicular traffic in mid-June 2017, with landscaping work to be completed during the summer that year. An official re-opening ceremony, with representatives of the Government of Canada, along with community members from St. Peter's and Potlotek First Nation, was held on November 16, 2017.

Founded by Canadian businessman Dov Charney in 1989, it was a vertically integrated company that ranked as one of the largest apparel manufacturers and marketers in North America. After losing money for six consecutive years, American Apparel filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S. on October 5, 2015 in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California. It was reported that the brand then agreed to a plan with its creditors to convert $200 million of debt into equity, $90 million in debtor financing and $70 million in new capital. The company officially exited bankruptcy after its financial restructuring plan was accepted by the Bankruptcy Court in Delaware and became privately owned by its creditors and bond holders, thus severing ties with all former stockholders as well as ex-CEO and founder Dov Charney. In January 2017, Gildan Activewear purchased American Apparel's intellectual property and other assets for $88 million in a bankruptcy auction after the company filed for bankruptcy a second time in November 2016. In January 2017, American Apparel laid off 2,400 Southern California workers and started the process of shutting down company factories and closing its 110 stores, using Chapter 7-like tactics. As of mid-2017, American Apparel runs as an online-only retailer and markets itself as \\"Ethically Made‚ÄîSweatshop Free,\\" with the majority of its products being made internationally. Most of its apparel is sourced from factories in Central America, primarily Honduras and Nicaragua. In January 2018, the company had an executive board consisting entirely of women. History American Apparel store in SoHo, New York City American Apparel was founded in 1989 by Canadian Dov Charney. In 1997, after a variety of iterations, including a period of manufacturing in South Carolina, the company moved to Los Angeles. Charney began to sub-contract sewing with Sam Lim who, at the time, had a shop with 50 workers under the Interstate 10 freeway in east LA. Months later the two became partners. In 2000 American Apparel moved into its current factory in downtown Los Angeles where it continued to grow primarily as a wholesale business, selling blank T-shirts to screenprinters, uniform companies and fashion brands. After its experience as a wholesale brand, the company moved into the retail market. The company was ranked 308th in Inc.'s 2005 list of the 500 fastest growing companies in the United States, with a 440% three-year growth and revenues in 2005 of over US$211 million. In late 2006, American Apparel went through a reverse merger and became listed on the American Stock Exchange. It is also one of the few clothing companies exporting \\"Made in the USA\\" goods and in 2007 sold about $125 million of domestically manufactured clothing outside of America. The company promotes labor policies that exclude use of clothing manufactured in sweatshops.New York Post, T-Shirts, As Far As the Eye Can See, Maxine Shen, March 24, 2004 In 2010, American Apparel's auditors, Deloitte & Touche, resigned after informing the company that its financial statements for 2009 may not be reliable. The resignation led to investigation by U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the United States attorney's office for the Southern District of New York. In April 2011, American Apparel confirmed that it had secured $14.9 million in financing from a group of Canadian investors. Under the deal announced, American Apparel sold some 15.8 million shares of common stock at 90 cents a share to a group of investors led by Michael Serruya and Delavaco Capital. The investors also received warrants to buy as much as 27.4 million additional shares. In April 2013, American Apparel issued a private offering of $206 million in senior secured notes.American Apparel Refinances With Private Bond Offering. WWD.com 4/5/2013American Apparel Prices Offering of $206 Million of Senior Secured Notes. Reuters.com 4/5/2013 The proceeds were used to repay a long-standing, high-interest credit facility from Lion Capital and Crystal Financial. In June 2014, the Board of Directors decided to oust American Apparel founder, chairman and CEO, Dov Charney, after allegations of misconduct and inappropriate behaviour towards employees. As interim chief executive during the search for a permanent CEO, the company's CFO John Luttrell was appointed. As co-chairmen the company appointed Allan Mayer and David Danziger. Charney, through his lawyers, claimed his ousting was illegal and demanded reinstatement. Soon after, Lion Capital demanded the repayment of a $10 million loan four years early. A failure to repay the loan would trigger a default on a $50 million credit line with Capital One Financial. In December 2014, American Apparel announced the official termination of CEO Dov Charney and the promotion of fashion executive Paula Schneider to that position. As of September 2015, American Apparel was trying hard to avoid bankruptcy as it scrambled to raise money to pay down US$15.4 million debt due in October, 2015. It was struggling to find funds as it prepared to report a torrid set of financial results in the coming weeks. The clothes retailer warned investors in August 2015 that it would not have enough cash to \\"sustain operations for the next twelve months\\" which raises \\"substantial doubt that we may be able to continue as a going concern\\". The firm filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on October 5, 2015. In January 2016, the brand rejected a $300 million takeover bid from Hagan Capital Group and Silver Creek. The investment firms are supporters of Dov Charney. In January 2017, American Apparel was acquired at auction for $88 million by Gildan Activewear, a Canadian sportswear company.American Apparel‚Äôs Global Relaunch Was Encouraged By Enthusiastic DMs Dena Silver, 4/25/2018 Montreal-based company Gildan Activewear Inc. bought American Apparel but not its physical stores.American Apparel is reopening exactly one store, and it's in Los Angeles Los Angeles Times, May 3, 2018 Branding and advertising American Apparel branch on Briggate in Leeds.

According to Adage, American Apparel's advertising 'telegraphs the brand' from person to person. Advertising Age magazine editor-at large Matthew Creamer said Charney's team develops consistent ads that \\"telegraph the brand\\". Their print campaigns are widely considered to be some of the best in the industry. The sexually charged advertising has been criticized, but has also been lauded for honesty and lack of airbrushing. According to CEO Dov Charney, the vision for the brand is that of a \\"heritage brand. It's like liberty, property, pursuit of happiness for every man worldwide. That's my America.\\" American Apparel CEO Dov Charney: A Tarnished Hero?

Many of the models in American Apparel's advertising are recruited by Charney and his colleagues on the street, or company stores; others are selected after sending their photos directly to the company website. The company has also used pornographic actors and glamour models in some of its ads including Lauren Phoenix, Charlotte Stokely, Sasha Grey, Euguenia Diyordiychuk and Faye Reagan. Adult entertainment trade magazine Adult Video News cited the American Apparel websiteAmerican Apparel Photo Gallery as \\"one of the finer softcore websites going\\".Adult Video News \\"I See London, I See France\\", AVNOnline Column, February 1, 2006 Some of the company's other ads, which feature nudity or sexual themes, have been banned by various advertising authorities. In 2009, an American Apparel ad which appeared in VICE Magazine was banned in the UK, because the image \\"could be seen to sexualise a model who appears to be a child\\". American Apparel complied with this ruling. American Apparel also came under fire for a 2014 ad for mini-skirts, which featured a model bending over so that her underwear was prominently exposed. In 2013, the company released an ad in which the model lay on a bed with her feet up in the air without wearing pants. The company also released an ad in which a model posed in a series of photos focused on her crotch, in which her face was not seen. The UK Advertising Standards Authority criticized the ad for being \\"voyeuristic\\" and \\"vulnerable\\". For a time, Charney used a branding strategy that spotlighted his treatment of workers, promoting American Apparel's goods as \\"sweatshop free\\". In 2014, the company released a controversial ad with a topless model, and the words \\"Made in Bangladesh\\" across her chest, in an effort to draw attention to the company's fair labor practices. In 2008, the company took out a series of political ads featuring the corporate logo that called current immigration laws an \\"apartheid system\\". In 2005, the company was named \\"Marketer of the Year\\" at the first-ever LA Fashion Awards. Women's Wear Daily published a survey in April 2007 from Outlaw Consulting, a creative research firm tracking the habits of 21- to 27-year-olds, which ranked American Apparel as the 8th most trusted brand, ahead of such clothing brands as H&M; and Levi's. In 2007, Imp Kerr created a fake American Apparel ad campaign in New York. The stunt lasted almost a year, until it was revealed that the fake ads were actually Photoshop mockups. American Apparel ran a tribute ad on the back cover of Vice magazine showing a compilation of the fake ads. In January 2008, the Intelligence Group, a trend and market research firm, listed American Apparel as their number two Top Trendsetting Brand, behind only Nike. In 2008, The Guardian named American Apparel \\"Label of the Year\\". From 2009 until 2014, photographers such as Henrik Purienne and David Shama worked on a number of ad campaigns for American Apparel that defined the identity of the brand. =Woody Allen billboard and lawsuit= In 2007, American Apparel put up two billboards, one in New York and one in Los Angeles, featuring an image of Woody Allen's character dressed as a Rabbi from the movie Annie Hall and Yiddish text, for a period of one week. According to Charney, the billboards were a satire and allegory alluding to both the scene in the movie and the similar controversy experienced by both individuals. Allen strongly objected to this use of his image and sued the company for $10 million. Allen testified at a December 2008 deposition that he considered the company's advertising to be \\"sleazy\\" and \\"infantile\\". Although the company said as early as May 2008 that the billboards were meant \\"strictly as social parody\\", there was much debate over whether American Apparel's lawyers would use Allen's personal life, namely his affair with Soon-Yi Previn as their defense at the trial. Charney claimed that these rumors were outright false and that his speech was protected by the First Amendment.A Statement from Dov Charney Daily Update, AmericanApparel.net May 2009 In May 2009, the case was settled by American Apparel's insurance carrier for $5 million, with the insurance company paying the bulk of the settlement. The settlement was for half of Allen's initial demand. Dov Charney said that if it had been up to him, he would have continued the case and taken it to trial. =Legalize LA, Legalize Gay, and Pride= Legalize LA featuring CEO Dov Charney In addition to participating in a variety of immigration protests, the company launched an advertising and advocacy campaign called \\"Legalize LA\\".The May Day Marches, Claire Hoffman, Los Angeles Times, 2006-05-02. \\"The iconoclastic chief executive of American Apparel Inc. not only gave 3,300 of his employees the day off, but he also supplied them with T-shirts emblazoned with a pro-immigration message\\". \\"By noon, Charney had left the factory and joined his workers and their families, who had arranged to march together on Broadway\\". \\"American Apparel, with about 130 stores around the world, has a history of supporting May Day marches: In past years, employees were given half the day off and bused to protests\\". The campaign featured advertisements in national papers like The New York Times as well as billboards, T-shirts, bus ads and posters. The company also maintains a Legalize LA portion of their website that features news articles relating to immigration reform, the brand and information on the history of the issue. After the passing of Prop 8 (which defines marriage in the state as one man and one woman) in California in November 2008, American Apparel launched the Legalize Gay campaign. It is similar to the Legalize LA campaign, and shirts with \\"Legalize Gay\\" and \\"Repeal Prop 8\\" printed on them in the same style as the shirts of Legalize LA are sold by the company. In June 2012 American Apparel partnered with the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation in releasing a new line of T-shirts to celebrate LGBT Pride Month. Fifteen percent of the net sales of the shirts were donated to GLAAD. Isis King modeled for this line, becoming American Apparel's first openly transgender model. In the summer of 2013, American Apparel announced their desire for more \\"transexy\\" models.

This otherwise wasted material reduces the amount of fabric the company needs to produce in addition to expanding its product line and saves approximately 30,000 pounds of cotton per week. American Apparel maintains a bicycle lending program for its employees and according to People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals it is a vegan- friendly clothing company. As of 2007 the company planned to increase its use of organic cotton within the next four years from over 20% to 80%. American Apparel also sells a line of shirts under the \\"Sustainable\\" label that are 100% USDA organic cotton. In 2008, American Apparel purchased over 30,000 pounds of organic cotton known as B.A.S.I.C cotton. American Apparel installed a 146-kilowatt solar electric system on its factory roof, designed to reduce power costs by at least 20%.RenewableEnergyaccess.com (January 27, 2006). Downtown L.A.

As an underwriter of Farm Aid, American Apparel donates the blank shirts that the organization prints and sells as merchandise.Farm Aid: Merchandise Description In 2007, right before Christmas, American Apparel donated more than 300,000 articles of clothing, with the giveaway specifically targeting the homeless population of large cities. In 2009, the company had a \\"Justice for Immigrants\\" factory sale in Los Angeles‚Äîthe proceeds of which benefitted organizations such as the Casa Libre Immigrant Children's Homeless Youth Shelter, the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law, the Coalition for Humane Immigration Reform of Los Angeles, Hermandad Mexicana Latinoamericana, and the National Day Laborers Organizing Network. American Apparel also donated more than $400,000 worth of garments to the victims of the Haitian earthquake through Fashion Delivers as well as over 5,000 pairs of socks to the shoe charity Soles4Souls. = Criticism = American Apparel was criticized in October 2013 for a 'culturally insensitive display' in one of its New York stores. The display used imagery associated with Traditional African religion and Afro-American religion. This sparked outrage among some practitioners of these various religions, that include Haitian Vodou, Louisiana Voodoo, West African Vodun, Cuban Santer√≠a, and others.

He has performed with Maceo Parker, John Scofield, Joe Lovano, Michael Brecker, Pat Metheny, Lonnie Smith, Nicholas Payton, Bill Carrothers, Steve Wilson, Seamus Blake, Larry Goldings and Peter Bernstein, and Jim Hall. Biography Bill Stewart's father was a trombonist, and his first and middle names are a tribute to jazz trombonist Bill Harris.Orr, Timothy (2008) \\"In Conversation With Bill Stewart\\" Drum Magazine Stewart grew up in Des Moines, Iowa, listening to his parents' jazz and rhythm and blues records without much exposure to live jazz in the then relatively isolated state of Iowa. The largely self-taught drummer began playing at the age of seven. While in high school, he played in a Top 40 cover band and the school orchestra, and went to a summer music camp at Stanford Jazz Workshop, where he met jazz legend Dizzy Gillespie. After high school graduation, Stewart attended the University of Northern Iowa in Cedar Falls, Iowa, playing in the jazz and marching bands as well as the orchestra. He then transferred to William Paterson University (then William Paterson College), where he played in ensembles directed by Rufus Reid, studied drums with Eliot Zigmund and Horacee Arnold and took composition lessons from Dave Samuels. The young drummer met future employer Joe Lovano while still in college (the two played duets in lieu of a drum lesson when Zigmund was away). Stewart also made his first recordings, with saxophonist Scott Kreitzer, and pianist Armen Donelian, while still in school, and with pianist Franck Amsallem (and Gary Peacock on bass) shortly thereafter, in 1990. After college, Stewart moved to New York where he quickly built his reputation, first gaining wider recognition in John Scofield's quartet with pianist Michael Eckroth and bassist Ben Street and in a trio with Larry Goldings and Peter Bernstein, which has become the longest- running group Stewart has played with, having begun in 1989 and continuing to this day, however infrequently the group may be found in performance. Stewart's musical horizons expanded when funk saxophonist Maceo Parker tapped the budding drummer upon seeing him with Larry Goldings at a regular gig at a club in Manhattan. Stewart worked with Parker from 1990 to 1991, touring and recording on three of Parker's albums. The association led to Stewart's gig with James Brown, who told Stewart that there \\"Ain't no funk in Iowa!\\" upon learning the drummer's roots. Another close associate is pianist Kevin Hays, with whom he performs, along with fellow WPC graduate, bassist Doug Weiss. The Kevin Hays trio has recorded five CDs and toured internationally. Musical associations with Lee Konitz, Michael Brecker, Pat Metheny and many other notable jazz musicians have followed. Musical style As a drummer, Bill Stewart's playing is distinguished by its melodic focus, and its polyrhythmic, or layered character. To describe someone's drumming style as \\"melodic\\" would mean there is a sense that you could \\"hum along\\" with discernible linear phrases which tell pieces of a story, akin to a vocalist, pianist, or saxophonist. Stewart's improvisations favor the development and layering of motivic ideas over the raw generation of excitement or display of technical prowess. Stewart has great touch, or dynamic precision, so that his ideas are articulated with an exactness and clarity. He has also achieved a very high degree of independence of his limbs, so that not only the ride cymbal and the snare/toms, but also the bass drum and hi-hat, are free to participate as melodic \\"first-class citizens.\\" His drumming bears the influence of various melodic drummers who preceded him, including Max Roach, Art Blakey, Joe Morello, Roy Haynes, Jack DeJohnette, Paul Motian, and Al Foster. As a composer, Bill Stewart is forward-looking, and seems not to want to repeat what others have already accomplished. In other words, his tunes have a bit of an avant-garde flavor. The melodies, harmonies, phrase lengths, and measure lengths are often altered so as not to conform too closely to traditional jazz language. Some of his tunes (such as \\"Mayberry\\") also feature a built-in \\"free blowing\\" section, surrounded by a composed \\"head\\" (in the case of \\"Mayberry\\", a parody of the theme song of the Andy Griffith Show.) The concept of \\"Mayberry\\" may have been borrowed from Stewart's long-time collaborator John Scofield, who has written many tunes of the same general shape. Technique Stewart, for the most part, plays holding his sticks in a matched grip, favored by orchestral and rock players. This is in contrast to many jazz contemporaries who still prefer the traditional grip. As a leader Stewart has a considerable output as a leader, beginning with 1989's Think Before You Think, with bassist Dave Holland, pianist Marc Copland, and saxophonist Joe Lovano, on which the drummer led a session of originals and standards, including one of his own compositions. In his next outing as a leader, Stewart assembled trumpeter Eddie Henderson, saxophonist Lovano, pianist Bill Carrothers and bassist Larry Grenadier for an entire record of Stewart compositions, Snide Remarks, which was chosen as one of the top ten jazz CDs of the year by Peter Watrous of The New York Times. The second Blue Note album to be released under Stewart's name was 1997's Telepathy, featuring Carrothers and Grenadier along with saxophonists Steve Wilson and Seamus Blake. In 2005, the Bill Stewart Trio, with Kevin Hays and Larry Goldings, released Keynote Speakers. The ensemble is a twist on the usual organ-guitar-drum trio, where a second keyboard (variously piano, Fender Rhodes, and other keyboard instruments) is added to the organ-drum foundation. In December 2006 he recorded Incandescence with the same trio. Stewart's recordings all have a certain blend of playfulness and mystery propelled by his drumming and melodic and rhythmic compositional style. Stewart has said that he thinks it very important to find an interesting combination of musicians whose abilities will complement each other and who will sound at home on the compositions slated for the given session. Gear Stewart plays various Zildjian K cymbals and is endorsed by the Avedis Zildjian Company. A collaboration with Paul Francis from Zildjian yielded the 22\\" K Custom Special Dry Complex Rides (in Thin and Medium Thin weights), which are meant to replicate the sound of an old K. Zildjian cymbal Stewart has had for a long time. They were introduced in 2004. According to Stewart, \\"The K Custom Special Dry Complex Ride has some trashy quality, but can also be articulate. The nice crash sound gets out of the way quickly while a clean stick sound or click is evident when riding. These cymbals are very pretty, yet can be very nasty.\\"\\"Bill Stewart\\", Zildjian. The cymbals were redesigned and sold as the K Custom Dry Complex II Rides since 2008 in sizes of 20, 22 and 24-inch. These custom ride cymbals feature a wider bell with a much lower profile to promote more control while offering a smooth array of rich overtones. Weight specifications are slightly heavier (medium- thin) than the first generation of Complex Rides, to make the cymbals more versatile, providing ride patterns that can be heard clearly from within an airy wash of overtones.\\"Zildjian K Custom Dry Complex II Ride Cymbal\\", Music123. Zildjian has also designed the Bill Stewart Artist Series Drumsticks.

Listed as a Grade 1 set of buildings, it has been a National Trust property since 1951. History The castellated house was the seat of Sir Maurice de la Pole in the reign of King Henry II (1154‚Äì1189),White's Devonshire Directory, 1850, re: Marldon after which family the manor was known as Compton Pole when it came into the hands of Sir Peter Compton. The original undefended manor house was built in the mid-14th century and consisted of a hall flanked by solar and service rooms at each end. These were rebuilt in the later Middle Ages. The fortress-like front was added in about 1520 by John Gilbert. The central hall was in ruins by the 18th century, but was faithfully reconstructed in the 1950s. Compton Castle's most famous inhabitant was Sir Humphrey Gilbert.(1539‚Äì1583), coloniser of Newfoundland and half-brother of Sir Walter Raleigh; legend has it that Raleigh smoked the first pipe of tobacco in Britain while visiting Sir Humphrey. The castle was home to the Gilbert family until the estate was sold in 1785 whereupon it gradually declined until a descendant bought it back in 1931; he gave it to the National Trust in 1951 on the condition that members of the family should continue to occupy the castle. They still do, and administer it for the Trust. Modern history The great hall lacked a roof and needed a great deal of restoration work which was all done prior to the National Trust acquiring the property. In the hall there is a model of Squirrel, the ship in which Sir Humphrey Gilbert sailed to Newfoundland (The crest of the Gilbert family is A squirrel sejant on a hill vert feeding on a crop of nuts properVivian, Lt.Col. J.L., (Ed.) The Visitations of the County of Devon: Comprising the Heralds' Visitations of 1531, 1564 & 1620, Exeter, 1895, p.405). To the west of the great hall is the solar, which served as a private retiring room away from the bustle of the great hall. It is approached by a 15th-century staircase. Another restored room is the kitchen, which is housed in a separate building because of the risk of fire it posed. To the right of the hearth, a stone stair led up inside a tower to what was probably a guard room. External defences in the castle included two portcullises which could be lowered when the castle came under attack. Arrows could be shot through loopholes overlooking the gateway. The curtain walls had slits through which stones and boiling oil could be dropped on any attackers trying to scale the walls. The castle was used as a location for the filming of the 1995 version of Sense and Sensibility. Its Great Kitchen is notable for the insight it gives into medieval domestic life, and its small formal gardens are enclosed by a stone curtain wall. There is another Compton Castle at Compton Pauncefoot, Somerset.

Her early films helped define the No Wave scene. According to The Irish Times, Dick is \\"one of the most important film-makers Ireland has produced\\".  Biography  Dick was born in Donegal and grew up in Ireland during the 1950s, attending University College Dublin there in the 1960s. After travels in Europe, India and Mexico, she emigrated to the United States in the 1975. She relocated to London in the mid-1980s and returned to Ireland in the mid-1990s. Dick currently lives in Galway and teaches filmmaking at Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology.  Career  Upon her arrival in the U.S., Dick became an integral figure in No Wave film culture and produced a series of seminal Super8 short films. Living in New York, which was undergoing a recession and an inexpensive place to live, many of her films were staged around well-known sites such as Coney Island, the Statue of Liberty, and the World Trade Center. The films featured punk performers such as Lydia Lunch, Pat Place (of the band Bush Tetras) and Adele Bertei (of The Contortions). Film critic and author J. Hoberman has called Dick the \\"quintessential No Wave filmmaker\\".\\"A context for Vivienne Dick,\\" October, no. 20, Spring 1982, pp. 102‚Äì106 After leaving the United States, Dick's work took on a more political tone. She was an active member of the London Filmmakers Coop during her time in the city. Her 2014 film, The Irreducible Difference of the Other, acknowledges her longstanding interest in Luce Irigaray. Her work is examined in the 2010 documentary Blank City, which discusses the No Wave movement. She is referenced by the feminist dance-punk group, Le Tigre, in their song \\"Hot Topic.\\" Dick's work formed part of two major retrospectives of American avant garde film: No Wave Cinema 1978-87 (1996) at the Whitney Museum, New York and Big as Life: An American History of Super8 Film (1999) at the Museum of Modern Art, New York and the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Vivienne's work was the subject of a retrospective at the Crawford Arts Centre, with an accompanying monograph co-published by the Crawford Arts Centre and the LUX Tate Modern, London in late 2010. It included a collection of her remarkable films and included a performance by Lydia Lunch as well as discussions with Nan Goldin, Claire Pajaczkowska, and Maeve Connolly, as well as films by other artists selected by Dick. \\"In 2017 IMMA presented 93% STARDUST, a survey exhibition of Dick‚Äôs work.\\"  Films  * DVD, Afterimages 4 : Vivienne Dick, Lux.

COLAGE is run and operated by people of all ages who have a LGBTQ parent or parents. Older Colagers mentor younger members, preparing them for challenges that a child may face having same-sex parents. Every summer COLAGE comes to Family Pride annual Family Week in Provincetown on Cape Cod.Dan Gilgoff, \\"The Rise of the Gay Family: More and more American children are growing up with same-sex parents\\", US News & World Report, 5/16/04. There, hundreds of gay families attend COLAGE meetings and workshops. COLAGE is currently a virtual organization and has a small paid staff. The national program director is Jordan Budd. History COLAGE is the first organization of its kind and was originally called Just for Us.\\"Guide to COLAGE (Children Of Lesbians And Gays Everywhere)\\", Online Archive of California, http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt209nd8js/ Just for Us began as a newsletter of the main six members of COLAGE. Later, six other chapters around the United States adopted that name. The ancestry of COLAGE can be tracked to an annual conference that is sponsored each year by Gay and Lesbian Parents Coalition International (GLPCI). In 1992, the group met for three days, outside of its annual meeting, to compose a mission statement and long-term goals.The COLAGE Creation Myth. COLAGE. http://www.colage.org/about/myth.htm Amity Buxton represented the Straight Spouse Network (SSN), which has close relations with the Family Pride Coalition (FPC), at the conference and gave presentations for the GLPCI/FPC concerning her heading of the Task Force for children through the PFLAG. Her presentation proved successful in contributing to the origins of COLAGE.Gottlieb, Andrew R. \\"Introduction.\\" Interventions with Families of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender People: From the Inside Out. Ed. Jerry J. Bigner. Binghamton: The Haworth Press, Inc, 2006. pg 3. In 1995, COLAGE opened a volunteer-run national office in San Francisco. This office operated for the primary purpose of providing \\"support, research, media, and advocacy\\" for over 500 families on a mailing list of children with GLBT parents. Beginning in 1996, COLAGE included children of transgender parents and designed specific resources not available anywhere else.Kuvalanka, Katherine A., Beth Teper, and Orson A. Morrison. \\"COLAGE: Providing Community, Education, Leadership, and Advocacy by and for Children of GLBT Parents.\\" Interventions with Families of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender People: From the Inside Out. Eds. Jerry J. Bigner and Andrew R. Gottlieb. Binghamton: The Haworth Press, Inc, 2006. pg 76. In 1997, the organization had their first director on payroll with a minuscule budget. The director, along with a determined team of youth- led volunteer committees, was able to commence a nationwide campaign that would allow them to hire another staff member in 1999. Advocacy In the United States, there are 6 million children who have at least one lesbian or gay parent and within these values anywhere from one to nine million children are currently being raised in same-sex parent households.Steven Mitchel, \\"The Progressive Project and COLAGE Amicus Brief for Perry v Schwarzenegger\\", Case 3:09cv-02292, United States District Court for the Northern District of California. Children within these households face minority problems and the ability to cope with their situation can often be overwhelming. COLAGE serves these types of children in several ways with peer support and community- building. The process for children to become comfortable with their lifestyle is often disrupted by different outside influences such as the \\"negative portrayals, misinformation, and the constant public debate about LGBT rights.\\" Another purpose of COLAGE is advocating for the lack of legal recognition of same-sex relationships to address the burden of lack of benefits or protections for LGBT families with children. COLAGE also opposes negative media concerning the psychological disorders that surround the children of LGBT parents. =Youth Leadership and Public Education= This program of COLAGE aims to \\"connect constituents with media and public speaking opportunities empowering them to produce authentic representations of their experiences.\\" YLAP (Youth Leadership and Action Program) was a COLAGE program designed to support public education and advocacy efforts for the children with LGBT parents by creating high quality arts activism materials. In 2005, the YLAP members completed In My Shoes: Stories of Youth with GLBT Parents, a documentary that profiles several adolescents with their stories, unique experiences, and their opinions about same-sex marriages.\\"Two short films exploring the impact of marriage and adoption rights in diverse LGBT families.\\", 2007 Frameline Film Festival.\\"National Association for Multicultural Education: Advocates for Educational Equity and Social Justice\\", NAME Film Festival‚Äì2010,Tracy Nectoux, \\"In the Family: Marriage Equality and LGBT Families\\", 9 July 2010, GLBT Reviews: Book and media reviews from the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Round Table of the American Library Association.

Constructed in the 1960s, the A-35 links Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu with Montreal via the A-10. The A-35 is also the primary route for traffic between Montreal and Boston, although it ends short of the U.S. border. South of its current terminus in Saint-S√©bastien, the A-35 continues as two-lane Route 133 (which becomes four-lane divided north of the border) to the border. An extension of A-35 to meet Interstate 89 at Saint-Armand will complete a nearly limited-access highway link between Montreal and Boston. It had been scheduled to open in 2017, but construction was on hold and now will be completed up to the Canada-US border by 2023. Like many Quebec Autoroutes, the A-35 also has a name: Autoroute de la Vall√©e-des-Forts (Forts Valley Highway). The name refers to a chain of forts built by the French in the Richelieu Valley during the 17th and 18th centuries to defend their colonial settlements from the Iroquois. The A-35 used to be known as Autoroute de la Nouvelle-Angleterre (New England Motorway), referring to its role as a link between Quebec and New England. History View of then unopened Autoroute 35 looking northerly from the Route 227 overpassFirst constructed in the 1960s, A-35 is currently a long, 4-lane spur route linking Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu to Autoroute 10. By 1966, connecting the A-10 in Chambly with Route 104 in Iberville were opened to traffic. Another of A-35 from Route 104 to its terminus with Route 133 were completed in 1967. Completion of the entire length of A-35 had been scheduled for that year in time for Expo 67, but the province instead focused on expediting construction of autoroutes and approach roads to the Expo site. For many years, the A-35 featured at-grade intersections with St-Raphael Road and St-Andre Road in Saint-Luc. These intersections were closed in 1999; the St- Andre Road intersection was converted into a partial cloverleaf interchange, while St-Raphael Road was dead-ended on either side of the A-35. Future A federal-provincial funding agreement is providing for the completion of the A-35 to Interstate 89 at the U.S. border. The project's objectives are to improve economic links between Quebec and New England, reduce traffic on Route 133 (which is ill-equipped for the traffic it currently carries) and improve quality of life in the region. Construction of the A-35 extension began in 2009 between Saint-Alexandre and Saint-S√©bastien. Construction of the extension is divided into four segments. The first section (first two segments) of new highway between Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu and Highway 133 to Saint-S√©bastien was opened on October 8, 2014. On June 10, 2019, Federal and provincial government officials announced that plans are in the works to extend Quebec‚Äôs Highway 35 by nearly nine kilometres in the southbound direction ‚Äî but that still leaves it 4.5 kilometres short of reaching the U.S. border. Although Provincial authorities still did not know when the section will be complete, construction of this section was expected to begin in 2020. The Legault government confirmed that Autoroute 35 in the Mont√©r√©gie region will be completed up to the Canada-US border by 2023. Phase 3 of the work aims to extend Highway 35 from Route 133 in Saint-S√©bastien to the junction of Route 133 and chemin Champlain and du Moulin in Saint-Armand. An overpass will be built over Route 202 at Pike River, a bridge will be built over the Rivi√®re-aux-Brochets, an interchange (Exit 6) will be erected at the junction of Highway 35, Champlain Road and Route 133 at Saint-Armand and a roundabout (Exit 3) will be deployed at the intersection of Route 133 and Champlain and Moulin roads in Saint-Armand.

So, while the concentration of the solutes is fundamental to the calculation of the dynamics of a solution, they theorized that an extra factor that they termed gamma is necessary to the calculation of the activity coefficients of the solution. Hence they developed the Debye‚ÄìH√ºckel equation and Debye‚ÄìH√ºckel limiting law. The activity is only proportional to the concentration and is altered by a factor known as the activity coefficient \\\\gamma. This factor takes into account the interaction energy of ions in solution.  Debye‚ÄìH√ºckel limiting law  In order to calculate the activity a_C of an ion C in a solution, one must know the concentration and the activity coefficient: : a_C = \\\\gamma \\\\frac{[C]}{[C^\\\\ominus]}, where : \\\\gamma is the activity coefficient of C, : [C^\\\\ominus] is the concentration of the chosen standard state, e.g. 1 mol/kg if molality is used, : [C] is a measure of the concentration of C. Dividing [C] with [C^\\\\ominus] gives a dimensionless quantity. The Debye‚ÄìH√ºckel limiting law enables one to determine the activity coefficient of an ion in a dilute solution of known ionic strength. The equation is :\\\\ln(\\\\gamma_i) = -\\\\frac{z_i^2 q^2 \\\\kappa}{8 \\\\pi \\\\varepsilon_r \\\\varepsilon_0 k_\\\\text{B} T} = -\\\\frac{z_i^2 q^3 N^{1/2}_\\\\text{A}}{4 \\\\pi (\\\\varepsilon_r \\\\varepsilon_0 k_\\\\text{B} T)^{3/2}} \\\\sqrt{10^3\\\\frac{I}{2}} = -A z_i^2 \\\\sqrt{I}, where : z_i is the charge number of ion species i, : q is the elementary charge, : \\\\kappa is the inverse of the Debye screening length (defined below), : \\\\varepsilon_r is the relative permittivity of the solvent, : \\\\varepsilon_0 is the permittivity of free space, : k_\\\\text{B} is the Boltzmann constant, : T is the temperature of the solution, : N_\\\\mathrm{A} is the Avogadro constant, : I is the ionic strength of the solution (defined below), : A is a constant that depends on temperature. If I is expressed in terms of molality, instead of molarity (as in the equation above and in the rest of this article), then an experimental value for A of water is 1.172\\\\text{ mol}^{-1/2}\\\\text{kg}^{1/2} at 25 ¬∞C. It is common to use a base-10 logarithm, in which case we factor \\\\ln 10, so A is 0.509\\\\text{ mol}^{-1/2}\\\\text{kg}^{1/2}. The multiplier 10^3 before I/2 in the equation is for the case when the dimensions of I are \\\\text{mole}/\\\\text{dm}^3. When the dimensions of I are \\\\text{mole}/\\\\text{m}^3, the multiplier 10^3 must be dropped from the equation. It is important to note that because the ions in the solution act together, the activity coefficient obtained from this equation is actually a mean activity coefficient. The excess osmotic pressure obtained from Debye‚ÄìH√ºckel theory is in cgs units:http://homepages.rpi.edu/~keblip/THERMO/chapters/Chapter33.pdf, page 9. : P^\\\\text{ex} = -\\\\frac{k_\\\\text{B} T \\\\kappa_\\\\text{cgs}^3}{24\\\\pi} = -\\\\frac{k_\\\\text{B} T \\\\left(\\\\frac{4\\\\pi \\\\sum_j c_j q_j}{\\\\epsilon_0 \\\\epsilon_r k_\\\\text{B} T }\\\\right)^{3/2}}{24\\\\pi}. Therefore, the total pressure is the sum of the excess osmotic pressure and the ideal pressure P^\\\\text{id} = k_\\\\text{B} T \\\\sum_i c_i. The osmotic coefficient is then given by : \\\\phi = \\\\frac{P^\\\\text{id} + P^\\\\text{ex}}{P^\\\\text{id}} = 1 + \\\\frac{P^\\\\text{ex}}{P^\\\\text{id}}. Summary of Debye and H√ºckel's first article on the theory of dilute electrolytes The English title of the article is \\"On the Theory of Electrolytes. I. Freezing Point Depression and Related Phenomena\\". It was originally published in 1923 in volume 24 of a German- language journal . An English translation of the article is included in a book of collected papers presented to Debye by \\"his pupils, friends, and the publishers on the occasion of his seventieth birthday on March 24, 1954\\". Another English translation was completed in 2019 . The article deals with the calculation of properties of electrolyte solutions that are under the influence of ion-induced electric fields, thus it deals with electrostatics. In the same year they first published this article, Debye and H√ºckel, hereinafter D&H;, also released an article that covered their initial characterization of solutions under the influence of electric fields called \\"On the Theory of Electrolytes. II. Limiting Law for Electric Conductivity\\", but that subsequent article is not (yet) covered here. In the following summary (as yet incomplete and unchecked), modern notation and terminology are used, from both chemistry and mathematics, in order to prevent confusion. Also, with a few exceptions to improve clarity, the subsections in this summary are (very) condensed versions of the same subsections of the original article. =Introduction= D&H; note that the Guldberg‚ÄìWaage formula for electrolyte species in chemical reaction equilibrium in classical form is : \\\\prod_{i=1}^s x_i^{ u_i} = K, where : \\\\textstyle \\\\prod is a notation for multiplication, : i is a dummy variable indicating the species, : s is the number of species participating in the reaction, : x_i is the mole fraction of species i, : u_i is the stoichiometric coefficient of species i, : K is the equilibrium constant. D&H; say that, due to the \\"mutual electrostatic forces between the ions\\", it is necessary to modify the Guldberg‚ÄìWaage equation by replacing K with \\\\gamma K, where \\\\gamma is an overall activity coefficient, not a \\"special\\" activity coefficient (a separate activity coefficient associated with each species)‚Äîwhich is what is used in modern chemistry . The relationship between \\\\gamma and the special activity coefficients \\\\gamma_i is : \\\\log(\\\\gamma) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^s u_i \\\\log(\\\\gamma_i). =Fundamentals= D&H; use the Helmholtz and Gibbs free entropies \\\\Phi and \\\\Xi to express the effect of electrostatic forces in an electrolyte on its thermodynamic state. Specifically, they split most of the thermodynamic potentials into classical and electrostatic terms: : \\\\Phi = S - \\\\frac{U}{T} = -\\\\frac{A}{T}, where : \\\\Phi is Helmholtz free entropy, : S is entropy, : U is internal energy, : T is temperature, : A is Helmholtz free energy. D&H; give the total differential of \\\\Phi as : d \\\\Phi = \\\\frac{P}{T} \\\\,dV + \\\\frac{U}{T^2} \\\\,dT, where : P is pressure, : V is volume. By the definition of the total differential, this means that : \\\\frac{P}{T} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Phi}{\\\\partial V}, : \\\\frac{U}{T^2} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Phi}{\\\\partial T}, which are useful further on. As stated previously, the internal energy is divided into two parts: : U = U_k + U_e where : k indicates the classical part, : e indicates the electric part. Similarly, the Helmholtz free entropy is also divided into two parts: : \\\\Phi = \\\\Phi_k + \\\\Phi_e. D&H; state, without giving the logic, that : \\\\Phi_e = \\\\int \\\\frac{U_e}{T^2} \\\\,dT. It would seem that, without some justification, : \\\\Phi_e = \\\\int \\\\frac{P_e}{T} \\\\,dV + \\\\int \\\\frac{U_e}{T^2} \\\\,dT. Without mentioning it specifically, D&H; later give what might be the required (above) justification while arguing that \\\\Phi_e = \\\\Xi_e, an assumption that the solvent is incompressible. The definition of the Gibbs free entropy \\\\Xi is : \\\\Xi = S - \\\\frac{U + PV}{T} = \\\\Phi - \\\\frac{PV}{T} = -\\\\frac{G}{T}, where G is Gibbs free energy. D&H; give the total differential of \\\\Xi as : d\\\\Xi = -\\\\frac{V}{T} \\\\,dP + \\\\frac{U + PV}{T^2} \\\\,dT. At this point D&H; note that, for water containing 1 mole per liter of potassium chloride (nominal pressure and temperature aren't given), the electric pressure P_e amounts to 20 atmospheres. Furthermore, they note that this level of pressure gives a relative volume change of 0.001. Therefore, they neglect change in volume of water due to electric pressure, writing : \\\\Xi = \\\\Xi_k + \\\\Xi_e, and put : \\\\Xi_e = \\\\Phi_e = \\\\int \\\\frac{U_e}{T^2} \\\\,dT. D&H; say that, according to Planck, the classical part of the Gibbs free entropy is : \\\\Xi_k = \\\\sum_{i=0}^s N_i (\\\\xi_i - k_\\\\text{B} ln(x_i)), where : i is a species, : s is the number of different particle types in solution, : N_i is the number of particles of species i, : \\\\xi_i is the particle specific Gibbs free entropy of species i, : k_\\\\text{B} is the Boltzmann constant, : x_i is the mole fraction of species i. Species zero is the solvent. The definition of \\\\xi_i is as follows, where lower-case letters indicate the particle specific versions of the corresponding extensive properties: : \\\\xi_i = s_i - \\\\frac{u_i + P v_i}{T}. D&H; don't say so, but the functional form for \\\\Xi_k may be derived from the functional dependence of the chemical potential of a component of an ideal mixture upon its mole fraction. D&H; note that the internal energy U of a solution is lowered by the electrical interaction of its ions, but that this effect can't be determined by using the crystallographic approximation for distances between dissimilar atoms (the cube root of the ratio of total volume to the number of particles in the volume). This is because there is more thermal motion in a liquid solution than in a crystal. The thermal motion tends to smear out the natural lattice that would otherwise be constructed by the ions. Instead, D&H; introduce the concept of an ionic atmosphere or cloud. Like the crystal lattice, each ion still attempts to surround itself with oppositely charged ions, but in a more free-form manner; at small distances away from positive ions, one is more likely to find negative ions and vice versa. =The potential energy of an arbitrary ion solution= Electroneutrality of a solution requires that : \\\\sum_{i=1}^s N_i z_i = 0, where : N_i is the total number of ions of species i in the solution, : z_i is the charge number of species i. To bring an ion of species i, initially far away, to a point P within the ion cloud requires interaction energy in the amount of z_i q \\\\varphi, where q is the elementary charge, and \\\\varphi is the value of the scalar electric potential field at P. If electric forces were the only factor in play, the minimal-energy configuration of all the ions would be achieved in a close-packed lattice configuration. However, the ions are in thermal equilibrium with each other and are relatively free to move. Thus they obey Boltzmann statistics and form a Boltzmann distribution. All species' number densities n_i are altered from their bulk (overall average) values n^0_i by the corresponding Boltzmann factor e^{-\\\\frac{z_i q \\\\varphi}{k_\\\\text{B} T}}, where k_\\\\text{B} is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.http://www.pma.caltech.edu/Courses/ph136/yr2006/text.html , section 19.3 Thus at every point in the cloud : n_i = \\\\frac{N_i}{V} e^{-\\\\frac{z_i q \\\\varphi}{k_\\\\text{B} T}} = n^0_i e^{-\\\\frac{z_i q \\\\varphi}{k_\\\\text{B} T}}. Note that in the infinite temperature limit, all ions are distributed uniformly, with no regard for their electrostatic interactions. The charge density is related to the number density: : \\\\rho = \\\\sum_i z_i q n_i = \\\\sum_i z_i q n^0_i e^{-\\\\frac{z_i q \\\\varphi}{k_\\\\text{B} T}}. When combining this result for the charge density with the Poisson equation from electrostatics, a form of the Poisson‚ÄìBoltzmann equation results: : abla^2 \\\\varphi = -\\\\frac{\\\\rho}{\\\\varepsilon_r \\\\varepsilon_0} = -\\\\sum_i \\\\frac{z_i q n^0_i}{\\\\varepsilon_r \\\\varepsilon_0} e^{-\\\\frac{z_i q \\\\varphi}{k_\\\\text{B} T}}. This equation is difficult to solve and does not follow the principle of linear superposition for the relationship between the number of charges and the strength of the potential field. It has been solved by the Swedish mathematician Thomas Hakon Gronwall and his collaborators physicical chemists V. K. La Mer and Karl Sandved in a 1928 article from Physikalische Zeitschrift dealing with extensions to Debye‚ÄìHuckel theory, which resorted to Taylor series expansion. However, for sufficiently low concentrations of ions, a first-order Taylor series expansion approximation for the exponential function may be used (e^x \\\\approx 1 + x for 0 < x \\\\ll 1) to create a linear differential equation (Hamann, Hamnett, and Vielstich. Electrochemistry. Wiley-VCH. section 2.4.2). D&H; say that this approximation holds at large distances between ions, which is the same as saying that the concentration is low. Lastly, they claim without proof that the addition of more terms in the expansion has little effect on the final solution. Thus : -\\\\sum_i \\\\frac{z_i q n^0_i}{\\\\varepsilon_r \\\\varepsilon_0} e^{-\\\\frac{z_i q \\\\varphi}{k_\\\\text{B} T}} \\\\approx -\\\\sum_i \\\\frac{z_i q n^0_i}{\\\\varepsilon_r \\\\varepsilon_0} \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{z_i q \\\\varphi}{k_\\\\text{B} T}\\\\right) = -\\\\left(\\\\sum_i \\\\frac{z_i q n^0_i}{\\\\varepsilon_r \\\\varepsilon_0} - \\\\sum_i \\\\frac{z_i^2 q^2 n^0_i \\\\varphi}{\\\\varepsilon_r \\\\varepsilon_0 k_\\\\text{B} T}\\\\right). The Poisson‚ÄìBoltzmann equation is transformed to : abla^2 \\\\varphi = \\\\sum_i \\\\frac{z_i^2 q^2 n^0_i \\\\varphi}{\\\\varepsilon_r \\\\varepsilon_0 k_\\\\text{B} T}, because the first summation is zero due to electroneutrality. Factor out the scalar potential and assign the leftovers, which are constant, to \\\\kappa^2. Also, let I be the ionic strength of the solution: : \\\\kappa^2 = \\\\sum_i \\\\frac{z_i^2 q^2 n^0_i}{\\\\varepsilon_r \\\\varepsilon_0 k_\\\\text{B} T} = \\\\frac{2 I q^2}{\\\\varepsilon_r \\\\varepsilon_0 k_\\\\text{B} T}, : I = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sum_i z_i^2 n^0_i. So, the fundamental equation is reduced to a form of the Helmholtz equation:http://guava.physics.uiuc.edu/~nigel/courses/569/Essays_2004/files/lu.pdf section 3.1) : abla^2 \\\\varphi = \\\\kappa^2 \\\\varphi. Today, \\\\kappa^{-1} is called the Debye screening length. D&H; recognize the importance of the parameter in their article and characterize it as a measure of the thickness of the ion atmosphere, which is an electrical double layer of the Gouy‚ÄìChapman type. The equation may be expressed in spherical coordinates by taking r = 0 at some arbitrary ion:http://hyperphysics.phy- astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/laplace.html : abla^2 \\\\varphi = \\\\frac{1}{r^2} \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial r} \\\\left( r^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\varphi(r)}{\\\\partial r} \\\\right) = \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2\\\\varphi(r)}{\\\\partial r^2} + \\\\frac{2}{r} \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\varphi(r)}{\\\\partial r} = \\\\kappa^2 \\\\varphi(r). The equation has the following general solution (keep in mind that \\\\kappa is a positive constant): : \\\\varphi(r) = A \\\\frac{e^{-\\\\sqrt{\\\\kappa^2} r}}{r} + A' \\\\frac{e^{\\\\sqrt{\\\\kappa^2} r}}{2 r \\\\sqrt {\\\\kappa^2}} = A \\\\frac{e^{-\\\\kappa r}}{r} + A \\\\frac{e^{\\\\kappa r}}{r} = A \\\\frac{e^{-\\\\kappa r}}{r}, where A, A', and A are undetermined constants The electric potential is zero at infinity by definition, so A must be zero. In the next step, D&H; assume that there is a certain radius a_i, beyond which no ions in the atmosphere may approach the (charge) center of the singled out ion. This radius may be due to the physical size of the ion itself, the sizes of the ions in the cloud, and any water molecules that surround the ions. Mathematically, they treat the singled out ion as a point charge to which one may not approach within the radius a_i. The potential of a point charge by itself is : \\\\varphi_\\\\text{pc}(r) = \\\\frac{1}{4 \\\\pi \\\\varepsilon_r \\\\varepsilon_0} \\\\frac{z_i q}{r}. D&H; say that the total potential inside the sphere is : \\\\varphi_\\\\text{sp}(r) = \\\\varphi_\\\\text{pc}(r) + B_i = \\\\frac{1}{4 \\\\pi \\\\varepsilon_r \\\\varepsilon_0} \\\\frac{z_i q}{r} + B_i, where B_i is a constant that represents the potential added by the ionic atmosphere. No justification for B_i being a constant is given. However, one can see that this is the case by considering that any spherical static charge distribution is subject to the mathematics of the shell theorem. The shell theorem says that no force is exerted on charged particles inside a sphere (of arbitrary charge).http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/potsph.html Since the ion atmosphere is assumed to be (time-averaged) spherically symmetric, with charge varying as a function of radius r, it may be represented as an infinite series of concentric charge shells. Therefore, inside the radius a_i, the ion atmosphere exerts no force. If the force is zero, then the potential is a constant (by definition). In a combination of the continuously distributed model which gave the Poisson‚ÄìBoltzmann equation and the model of the point charge, it is assumed that at the radius a_i, there is a continuity of \\\\varphi(r) and its first derivative. Thus : \\\\varphi(a_i) = A_i \\\\frac{e^{-\\\\kappa a_i}}{a_i} = \\\\frac{1}{4 \\\\pi \\\\varepsilon_r \\\\varepsilon_0} \\\\frac{z_i q}{a_i} + B_i = \\\\varphi_\\\\text{sp}(a_i), : \\\\varphi'(a_i) = -\\\\frac{A_i e^{-\\\\kappa a_i} (1 + \\\\kappa a_i)}{a_i^2} = -\\\\frac{1}{4 \\\\pi \\\\varepsilon_r \\\\varepsilon_0} \\\\frac{z_i q}{a_i^2} = \\\\varphi_\\\\text{sp}'(a_i), : A_i = \\\\frac{z_i q}{4 \\\\pi \\\\varepsilon_r \\\\varepsilon_0} \\\\frac{e^{\\\\kappa a_i}}{1 + \\\\kappa a_i}, : B_i = -\\\\frac{z_i q \\\\kappa}{4 \\\\pi \\\\varepsilon_r \\\\varepsilon_0} \\\\frac {1}{1 + \\\\kappa a_i}. By the definition of electric potential energy, the potential energy associated with the singled out ion in the ion atmosphere is : u_i = z_i q B_i = -\\\\frac{z_i^2 q^2 \\\\kappa}{4 \\\\pi \\\\varepsilon_r \\\\varepsilon_0} \\\\frac {1}{1 + \\\\kappa a_i}. Notice that this only requires knowledge of the charge of the singled out ion and the potential of all the other ions. To calculate the potential energy of the entire electrolyte solution, one must use the multiple-charge generalization for electric potential energy: : U_e = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sum_{i=1}^s N_i u_i = -\\\\sum_{i=1}^s \\\\frac {N_i z_i^2}{2} \\\\frac{q^2 \\\\kappa}{4 \\\\pi \\\\varepsilon_r \\\\varepsilon_0} \\\\frac {1}{1 + \\\\kappa a_i}. =The additional electric term to the thermodynamic potential= Nondimensionalization The differential equation is ready for solution (as stated above, the equation only holds for low concentrations): :\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\varphi(r) }{\\\\partial r^2} + \\\\frac{2}{r} \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\varphi(r) }{\\\\partial r} = \\\\frac{I q \\\\varphi(r)}{\\\\varepsilon_r \\\\varepsilon_0 k_\\\\text{B} T} = \\\\kappa^2 \\\\varphi(r). Using the Buckingham œÄ theorem on this problem results in the following dimensionless groups: :\\\\pi_1 = \\\\frac{q \\\\varphi(r)}{k_\\\\text{B} T} = \\\\Phi(R(r)) :\\\\pi_2 = \\\\varepsilon_r :\\\\pi_3 = \\\\frac{a k_\\\\text{B} T \\\\varepsilon_0}{q^2} :\\\\pi_4 = a^3 I :\\\\pi_5 = z_0 :\\\\pi_6 = \\\\frac{r}{a} = R(r). \\\\Phi is called the reduced scalar electric potential field. R is called the reduced radius. The existing groups may be recombined to form two other dimensionless groups for substitution into the differential equation. The first is what could be called the square of the reduced inverse screening length, (\\\\kappa a)^2. The second could be called the reduced central ion charge, Z_0 (with a capital Z). Note that, though z_0 is already dimensionless, without the substitution given below, the differential equation would still be dimensional. :\\\\frac{\\\\pi_4}{\\\\pi_2 \\\\pi_3} = \\\\frac{a^2 q^2 I}{\\\\varepsilon_r \\\\varepsilon_0 k_\\\\text{B} T} = (\\\\kappa a)^2 :\\\\frac{\\\\pi_5}{\\\\pi_2 \\\\pi_3} = \\\\frac{z_0 q^2}{4 \\\\pi a \\\\varepsilon_r \\\\varepsilon_0 k_\\\\text{B} T} = Z_0 To obtain the nondimensionalized differential equation and initial conditions, use the \\\\pi groups to eliminate \\\\varphi(r) in favor of \\\\Phi(R(r)), then eliminate R(r) in favor of r while carrying out the chain rule and substituting {R^\\\\prime}(r) = a, then eliminate r in favor of R (no chain rule needed), then eliminate I in favor of (\\\\kappa a)^2, then eliminate z_0 in favor of Z_0. The resulting equations are as follows: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Phi(R) }{\\\\partial R}\\\\bigg_{R=1} = - Z_0 :\\\\Phi(\\\\infty) = 0 :\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\Phi(R) }{\\\\partial R^2} + \\\\frac{2}{R} \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Phi(R) }{\\\\partial R} = (\\\\kappa a)^2 \\\\Phi(R). For table salt in 0.01 M solution at 25 ¬∞C, a typical value of (\\\\kappa a)^2 is 0.0005636, while a typical value of Z_0 is 7.017, highlighting the fact that, in low concentrations, (\\\\kappa a)^2 is a target for a zero order of magnitude approximation such as perturbation analysis. Unfortunately, because of the boundary condition at infinity, regular perturbation does not work. The same boundary condition prevents us from finding the exact solution to the equations. Singular perturbation may work, however. Experimental verification of the theory To verify the validity of the Debye‚ÄìH√ºckel theory, many experimental ways have been tried, measuring the activity coefficients: the problem is that we need to go towards very high dilutions. Typical examples are: measurements of vapour pressure, freezing point, osmotic pressure (indirect methods) and measurement of electric potential in cells (direct method). Going towards high dilutions good results have been found using liquid membrane cells, it has been possible to investigate aqueous media 10‚àí4 M and it has been found that for 1:1 electrolytes (as NaCl or KCl) the Debye‚ÄìH√ºckel equation is totally correct, but for 2:2 or 3:2 electrolytes it is possible to find negative deviation from the Debye‚ÄìH√ºckel limit law: this strange behavior can be observed only in the very dilute area, and in more concentrate regions the deviation becomes positive. It is possible that Debye‚ÄìH√ºckel equation is not able to foresee this behavior because of the linearization of the Poisson‚ÄìBoltzmann equation, or maybe not: studies about this have been started only during the last years of the 20th century because before it wasn't possible to investigate the 10‚àí4 M region, so it is possible that during the next years new theories will be born. Extensions of the theory A number of approaches have been proposed to extend the validity of the law to concentration ranges as commonly encountered in chemistry One such extended Debye‚ÄìH√ºckel equation is given by: :\\\\ - \\\\log_{10}(\\\\gamma) = \\\\frac{Az_+z_-\\\\sqrt{I}}{1 + Ba\\\\sqrt{I}} \\\\, where \\\\ \\\\gamma \\\\, as its common logarithm is the activity coefficient, \\\\ z\\\\, is the integer charge of the ion (1 for H+, 2 for Mg2+ etc.), \\\\ I\\\\, is the ionic strength of the aqueous solution, and \\\\ a \\\\, is the size or effective diameter of the ion in angstrom. The effective hydrated radius of the ion, a is the radius of the ion and its closely bound water molecules. Large ions and less highly charged ions bind water less tightly and have smaller hydrated radii than smaller, more highly charged ions. Typical values are 3√Ö for ions such as H+,Cl‚àí,CN‚àí, and HCOO‚àí. The effective diameter for the hydronium ion is 9√Ö. \\\\ A \\\\, and \\\\ B \\\\, are constants with values of respectively 0.5085 and 0.3281 at 25 ¬∞C in water . The extended Debye‚ÄìH√ºckel equation provides accurate results for Œº ‚â§ 0.1. For solutions of greater ionic strengths, the Pitzer equations should be used. In these solutions the activity coefficient may actually increase with ionic strength. The Debye‚ÄìH√ºckel plot with different values for ion charge Z and ion diameter a The Debye‚ÄìH√ºckel equation cannot be used in the solutions of surfactants where the presence of micelles influences on the electrochemical properties of the system (even rough judgement overestimates Œ≥ for ~50%).

NAPFA established the first set of professional standards for fee-only financial advisors and has updated them to reflect changes in industry practices. NAPFA members are distinguished from other financial professionals in several ways. * Adherence to a fee-only standard is strict: NAPFA members cannot accept compensation in any form from any source other than their clients. There are no exceptions. NAPFA believes that this minimizes potential conflict of interest between a financial planner and their clients. * The fiduciary relationship requires that members always put their clients' interests before their own and that they disclose any potential conflict of interest prior to the client making a decision. This fiduciary standard is in direct opposition to the fiduciary standard by which stockbrokers are held, a standard under which their legal responsibility is to their employer ahead of their client. * NAPFA is the only financial planning organization to require a peer review of a candidate member's work output prior to granting membership. * Peer review ensures that a NAPFA member has the ability to provide comprehensive financial planning across a wide range of potential client needs‚Äîinvestments, taxes, estate planning, college savings, insurance, long-term care insurance, retirement spending, and more. * All new members since 2012 must have the CFP¬Æ designation. * NAPFA has the highest continuing education requirement in the industry, with 60 credit hours required every two years. The combination of strict fee-only rules and a peer review have kept NAPFA's membership small compared to other professional financial planning organizations. As of December 1, 2018, NAPFA had approximately 3,500 members.NAPFA - What Is NAPFA? Fee-only NAPFA defines a \\"fee-only\\" financial advisor as one who is compensated solely by the client, with neither the advisor nor any related party receiving compensation that is contingent on the purchase or sale of a financial product. This definition is in direct contrast to most advisors, who earn commissions, discounts, and other incentives when their clients purchase financial products. Also, unlike other financial planners, NAPFA members are required to clearly disclose the fee in advance. However, NAPFA members differ on how they charge the fee. Some advisors charge an hourly rate, similar to an attorney or CPA. Rates vary by region of the country and an advisor's experience level and expertise. Some advisors charge a retainer fee schedule that is paid quarterly or annually. Other advisors charge based upon a percentage of the client's assets under management, such as a 1% fee on the assets per year. Regardless, the fee must be made clear to the client. NAPFA does not permit its members to be compensated via the industry-standard 12b-1 sales & marketing expense fees for mutual funds. From NAPFA's perspective, there are two problems with these fees: undermined objectivity and inadequate disclosure. * Objectivity: A mutual fund pays 12b-1 fees directly to the selling broker-dealer, to be shared with the selling broker. This violates NAPFA's rules‚Äîthough it is neither illegal nor unusual‚Äîand it potentially could influence an advisor's recommendation about selection of a fund. * Disclosure: NAPFA has written to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to explain that the fees are removed from the clients' assets without notice or invoice to the client, are not reported on their investment statements, and are generally invisible to the client except through reduced investment returns. In 2010, the SEC adopted rules to improve disclosure of 12b-1 fees. Comprehensive NAPFA's membership requirements include proof that a financial advisor can produce a comprehensive financial plan for a client. Proof is demonstrated through peer review of a financial plan submitted by the prospective NAPFA member. The plan can either be from an actual client with whom the advisor is working, or it can be a plan produced from a sample set of facts and situations developed by NAPFA to test a candidate's knowledge. The plan must contain numerous specific elements that are common needs of many individuals and families. These include the following: a client's goals and objectives, net worth statement, cash flow analysis, recent tax return and analysis, insurance needs (medical, home, life, disability, long-term care, auto, umbrella, other), investment analysis and recommendations, retirement needs and projections, and estate plan and related elements (will, Advance health care directive, durable power of attorney, etc.). Consumer Education In addition to developing standards for financial advisors and enforcing those standards, NAPFA engages in a variety of free consumer education programs. These are designed to teach consumers how to manage their financial affairs, as well as to identify when they might need the assistance and support of a fee-only financial advisor. Consumer Advocacy NAPFA has always advocated on behalf of consumers' interests. In fact, protecting consumers was the impetus behind the creation of the organization‚Äîthe radical idea in the early 1980s that fee-only financial planning, without high and hidden commissions, would be better for consumers. Over the years, NAPFA's influence has resulted in greater awareness and adoption of fee-only principles by leading financial advisors, other major financial industry trade associations, and government regulations. Since 2008, NAPFA has joined with two other organizations in the Financial Planning Coalition (FPC) to push for greater change for consumers, at a time when an economic downturn and investment scandals have affected the financial security of nearly all Americans. NAPFA, the Financial Planning Association, and the CFP Board of Standards formed the Financial Planning Coalition to work with Congress and federal agencies to strengthen the rules on financial advisors' fiduciary conduct, fee disclosures, and conflicts of interest. Among the FPC's successes in this area have been greater disclosure of 12b-1 marketing fees by mutual funds and the SEC study in fall 2010 of a need for a consumer-first fiduciary requirement on investment brokers.

The film features series regulars Sid James, Kenneth Williams, Joan Sims, Bernard Bresslaw, Barbara Windsor, Kenneth Connor, Peter Butterworth and Hattie Jacques. It was the 23rd and final appearance for Charles Hawtrey. June Whitfield returned after appearing in Carry On Nurse 13 years earlier. Jimmy Logan and Carol Hawkins made their first of two appearances in the series. Along with the previous film in the series (Carry On Matron), it features the highest number of the regular Carry On team. The only members missing are Jim Dale and Terry Scott, both of whom had left the series by this point (although Dale would return belatedly for Carry On Columbus in 1992) and, as a result, were never in a Carry On film together. Plot The film opens with pub landlord and frequent holidaymaker Vic Flange (Sid James) openly flirting with the sassy saucepot widow Sadie Tompkins (Barbara Windsor) as his battleaxe wife, Cora (Joan Sims), looks on with disdain. Their twitching friend Harry (Jack Douglas) arrives and lets slip that the package holiday Vic has booked to the Mediterranean island Elsbels (a pun on the slang expression \\"Hell's Bells\\") which is on the Costa Bomm, also includes Sadie, much to Cora's outrage. Cora, who avoids holidays because she hates flying, suddenly decides to accompany her boorish husband on the trip, to ensure he keeps away from Sadie. The next day, Stuart Farquhar (Kenneth Williams), the representative of Wundatours Travel Agency, and his sexy, seductive assistant, Moira Plunkett (Gail Grainger), welcome the motley passengers. Among them are the henpecked and sex-starved Stanley Blunt (Kenneth Connor) and his overbearing, conservative, frigid wife, Evelyn (June Whitfield); a drunken, bowler-hatted mummy's boy, Eustace Tuttle (Charles Hawtrey); brash Scotsman Bert Conway (Jimmy Logan); young and beautiful friends Lily and Marge (Sally Geeson and Carol Hawkins respectively), who are each hoping to find a man to fall in love with; and a party of monks, including Brother Bernard (Bernard Bresslaw) a timid young monk who has difficulty fitting into his new path of life. Unfortunately, upon their arrival they discover their hotel is only half-finished; the builders have just quit suddenly for unspecified reasons, leaving the remaining five floors unfinished. Distraught manager Pepe (Peter Butterworth) desperately tries to run the place in myriad different guises ‚Äì the manager, the doorman and the porter ‚Äì and the chef is his irate, ill-tempered wife, Floella (Hattie Jacques), who battles repeatedly with the temperamental stove while their handsome, womanising son Georgio (Ray Brooks) idles behind the bar. The hotel also hides an assortment of faults and Pepe is soon overrun with complaints: Evelyn finds Mr Tuttle in her bath, Vic discovers Sadie naked in his shower; Lily and Marge's wardrobe has no back to it, allowing them to be accidentally seen by Brother Bernard in the opposite room; sand pours out of Moira's taps; the lavatory drenches Bert. The phone system itself is faulty and the guests end up complaining to each other for much of the time. Nevertheless, Stuart is determined to ensure everyone has a good time. Dinner the first night is foul and made even more unpleasant by the smoke from the burning food in the kitchen, which forces the motley group of holiday-makers to open the windows, prompting the arrival of mosquitos. Although agreeing to play leapfrog with Tuttle, Lily and Marge have their eyes on other things. Marge takes a shine to Brother Bernard, while Lily lures the dashing Nicholas (David Kernan) away from his jealous (and implied gay) friend, Robin (John Clive), and Marge and Bernard develop an innocent romance. Meanwhile, Stanley attempts to seduce Cora whilst his nagging wife is not present, but Cora is more interested in keeping Vic away from Sadie, who grows fond of Bert. Vic tries to put Bert off Sadie by telling him that she is a black widow who murdered her two previous husbands, when in fact both were firemen who died on the job. The next day, while most of the party go off on an excursion to the nearby village, Stanley ensures his wife is left behind so that he can spend the day attempting to woo Cora. Vic samples a local drink, \\"Santa Cecelia's Elixir\\", which blesses the drinker with X-ray vision and he is able to see through women's clothing. However, the tourists are arrested for causing a riot at Madame Fifi's (Olga Lowe) local brothel after Vic, Bert and Eustace annoy the girls there; left- behind Evelyn is seduced by Georgio, which leads to her abandoning her frigid manners. In the local prison, Miss Plunkett seduces the Chief of Police, and the tourists are released. Back at the hotel, Mrs Blunt resumes her sex life with a surprised Stanley after having a brief affair with Georgio. The last night in the hotel starts as a success, with all the guests at ease with each other thanks to the punch being spiked with Santa Cecelia's Elixir. Midway through the night it begins to rain, and the hotel is shown to have been constructed on a dry river bed. As the hotel begins to collapse Pepe finally loses his patience and sanity with the guests, who party on, oblivious to the disintegrating hotel. The film then shifts forward an unspecified period of time, and shows an Elsbels reunion at Vic & Cora's pub. All the guests are happy and reminisce about the holiday they barely survived.

Name The name construction of \\"Title A Place B-e si-√ò\\" (Official A who is appropriate for place B) was commonly used in the Early Dynastic onomasticon.Steinkeller (2015) p.44 * EN (íÇó): Honorific title that was not part of the original name,Steinkeller (2015) p.44 used on kings associated with cities sacred to Inanna in the mythical historiography of Ur-Namma's dynasty.Michalowski (2003) p.205 * ME (íà®): Michalowski reads it as isib (priest), while Steinkeller concludes it is an abbreviated writing form of men (crown). * BARA2 (íÅà): According to the onomastic it is a cultic/political place. However, if the patern is \\"ME fit for Official A\\", it would mean \\"ruler\\". * SI (íãõ): Verb meaning \\"to fill\\", which has more active force than the intransitive verb TU≈† (to sit, dwell), having a highly ideological meaning.

However, the dating of the piece is from the ED IIIa, and the Bara2 (íÅà) of the inscription is different shaped, probably mentioning another Mebaragesi which wasn't a king.Marchesi Toward a Chronology of Early Dynastic Rulers in Mesopotamia pp. 139-156 This theory has been criticized by Piotr Steinkeller by \\"the fact that a votive inscription was discovered in a particular level does not necessarily mean that it dates to that level.\\" Steinkeller An archaic ‚Äúprisoner plaque‚Äù from Ki≈° pp.131-157 He is also attested in the Sumerian King List (ETCSL 2.1.1) and in the Tummal Inscription ETCSL (2.1.3), both as the father of Aga of Kish and the first builder of the temple: '' Enmebaragesi is also mentioned Gilgamesh and Aga as the father of Aga who laid siege to Uruk, and in The lord to the Living One's Mountain which is offered as Gilgamesh's sister to be the wife of Huwawa. Reign According to the Sumerian King List (ETCSL 2.1.1), Kish had the hegemony over the entire territory of northern Babylonia and the most northern section of southern Babylonia cities such as Nippur, Isin, and Eresh, and large portions of the Diyala Region.Steinkeller An archaic ‚Äúprisoner plaque‚Äù from Ki≈° pp.131-157 Succeeding Iltasadum on the throne, where he reigned 900 years, leading a successful campaign against Elam and capturing Dumuzid the Fisherman in Uruk. There is some scant evidence to suggest that like the later Ur III kings, the rulers of ED Kish sought to ingratiate themselves to the authorities in Nippur, possibly to legitimize a claim for leadership over the land of Sumer or at least part of it.Faryne \\"The Struggle for Hegemony in Early Dynastic II Sumer\\" The Canadian Society for Mesopotamian Studies pp.65-66 The use of the royal title King of Kish expressing a claim of national rulership owes its prestige to the fact that Kish once did rule the entire nation.Katz Gilgamesh and Akka p.30 n.83 Archeology evidence from Kish shows a city flourishing in ED II with its political influence extending beyond the territory, however in ED III the city declined rapidly.Katz Gilgamesh and Akka p.16 =Elamite campaign= The Sumerian King List recounts \\"En-me(n)-barage-si, the one who carried away as spoil the weapons of the land of Elam, became king.\\" A tradition of the Kishite expansion into the Susiana and Iranian plateau are reflected in an inscription of an ED II king of Kish named Enna-il, which commemorates his military operations in Elam.Frayne, RIME 1, 75-76 The Discoveries of the inscriptions of Enmebaragesi and an unidentified king of Kish at Khafajah and Tell Agrab respectively are convincing indicators of the Ki≈°ite presence in the Diyala Region.Steinkeller An archaic ‚Äúprisoner plaque‚Äù from Ki≈° pp.131-157 =Invasion of Uruk= While the Sumerian King List (only in one version) mentions that Dumuzid the Fisherman king of Uruk captured Enmebaragesi, a new translation has been made, which exchanges Enmebaragesi as the one who captured Dumuzid.THE BROCKMON COLLECTION DUPLICATE OF THE SUMERIAN KINGLIST (BT 14) by Jacob Klein (Bar-Ilan University) { + Sumerian King List translations !

After  [≈†u a≈°] en?-me-[barag-ge4?-e-si-ta] nam-ra [ak]  He (Dumuzid) was taken captive by the (single) hand of Enmebaragesi. } This allows a better perspective on the political and military struggle between Kish and Uruk, the short duration of Dumuzid rulership and why he had no hereditary successors. After the general- king Lugalbanda in Uruk, a man named from Kuara seized the throne. Enmebaragesi attacked Uruk, captured Dumuzid and subjugated the city placing Gilgamesh as his vassal-king.THE BROCKMON COLLECTION DUPLICATE OF THE SUMERIAN KINGLIST (BT 14) by Jacob Klein (Bar-Ilan University) =Defeat= The later Sumerian Renaissance (Ur III) king Shulgi addressed one of his praise poems (Shulgi Hymn O (ETCSL 2.1.1)) to Gilgamesh, that credits him with capturing and defeating Enmebaragesi of Kish instead of his son Aga as Gilgamesh and Aga recounts. While in the historical scene of the Early Dynastic period this is quite conceivable, the assumption of two different wars is difficult to uphold because Gilgamesh emerges as victorious in both; his first victory would imply defeat and submission by the kingdom of Kish.Katz Gilgamesh and Akka p.14 Since Gilgamesh addresses Aga denoting military relations between them in the past and indebtedness to him for saving his life leads to Gilgamesh being dependent on Aga previously, conflicting with the assumption that he won a previous war against Kish. Another theory is since Enmebaragesi established the hegemony of Kish, defeating Aga would be less impressive than his powerful father, who therefore served the purpose of the hymn and portrays Gilgamesh as a mighty figure. Since Enmebaragesi was inserted to replace Aga, the hymn doesn't reflect a separate but rather one literary tradition from the tale.Katz Gilgamesh and Akka p.15  Popular culture  In the 2009 comedy film Year One, a film parodying historical, biblical and mythical persons, places and events, Enmebaragesi is portrayed as one of the best hunters from the village.

It is owned and operated by Station Casinos and has 576 rooms. Palace Station has a large Asian customer base mainly because of its location near Chinatown. History In 1976, Frank Fertitta Jr., a former general manager at the Fremont, and his two partners, opened The Casino, a gambling hall attached to a Mini Price Motor Inn, in an off-Strip location where few observers expected it to succeed. In 1977, he added bingo and renamed the property as the Bingo Palace. The casino was the first to target a clientele of local residents with offerings like giveaways, cheap buffets and bingo. It thrived, and Fertitta soon bought out his partners' shares. Other locals casinos like Sam's Town and the Gold Coast followed in later years. In 1984, the Bingo Palace was expanded and remodeled with a railroad theme, and renamed to the Palace Station Hotel & Casino. The grand opening ceremony was held on April 6, featuring Governor Richard Bryan and the historic locomotive Inyo. A train-themed neon sign, measuring wide and high, was constructed for Palace Station. In 1985, Fertitta purchased the adjoining 465-room motel. A 21-story hotel tower and high-rise parking garage were added in 1990, bringing the room count to 1,041. In 1993, Fertitta bought the land for what would become Boulder Station, the beginning of an expansion that would grow Station Casinos into a billion dollar company. But Fertitta left the firm that same year, turning management over to his sons when it went public. Early in 2009, Improv Vegas opened at the Bonkerz Comedy Club which was renamed from the Sound Trax lounge. The tower rooms have recently been remodeled. On October 17, 2016, employees voted to narrowly reject the unionization of a hotel and casino property by 266 to 262. It was organized by the Bartenders Union and the Culinary Workers Union and supervised by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) under the Obama administration. It was the first and only Station Casinos property to not be unionized by a vote margin. On March 13, 2017, Station Casinos agreed to settle disputes with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) under the Trump administration by letting these employees, the Bartenders Union and the Culinary Workers Union to unionize the property. It is the third Station Casinos property to be unionized. A $192 million renovation began in fall 2016, and was completed two years later. Palace Station remained open during renovations. As part of the renovation, the Palace Station's train theme was removed in favor of a modern design. Eight faux locomotives on the front of the building were removed, and one was donated to the city's Neon Museum, along with a Palace Station neon sign measuring long. The 126-foot Palace Station sign was removed during 2018, marking the end of the train theme. Palace Station's motel portion, with approximately 447 rooms, was demolished as part of the renovation project. A new bingo room opened during 2017. A grand re-opening celebration, including a fireworks show, was held on September 1, 2018. The addition included 500 additional slot machines and a 300-space parking lot on the property's east side. The renovation also featured four new restaurants, including a revamped buffet. A movie theater, part of the renovation project, is scheduled for completion in December 2018. =Incidents= The hotel has seen its share of accidents and misadventures, including a cashier's cage robbery in 1992, a 21st-floor fire caused by lightning in 1998, an armored car robbery in the parking lot in 2009 and most notoriously, the 2007 robbery of sports memorabilia by O. J. Simpson and his associates.

The name is an amalgam of Lawndale and Crescentville, the two primary communities that make up the neighborhood. The Summerdale community is also as of more recent years considered an extended part of Lawncrest. The Philadelphia Inquirer does not consider Lawncrest to be a neighborhood. The primary ZIP Code is 19111 (Fox Chase Post Office) for the area North of Comly Street and 19120 (Olney P.O.) for the area South of Comly Street. Most of the southern end of the Community is actually built on the former property of the Wentz Farm. Portions of the East side of Crescentville are actually built over former swamp land, while the West side was built on more stable bedrock.Rising Sun Avenue (formerly 2nd Street Pike) is usually identified as the main artery through Lawncrest, though originally, Ashmead Road/Levick Street was the primary Road.  History  Swedes and Germans settled the area as early as 1638. The community can trace its roots back to the 19th century as a small German community known to some as Marburg. Parts of Crescentville were known as \\"Grubbtown\\" during the Civil War. The main artery of the community, Rising Sun Avenue, was originally a toll road known as the Kensington & Oxford Turnpike. A sole remaining marker of this toll road once stood in front of the Engine 64 Firehouse at Rising Sun and Benner, near the bus stop.  Geography  The area of Lawncrest extends from Tacony Creek Park to Tyson Avenue. Adjacent neighborhoods include: Fox Chase/Burholme to the north, Oxford Circle/Castor Gardens and Frankford to the east and southeast, and Olney, and Feltonville to the south and southwest. To the West is Cheltenham Township, Montgomery County.  Transportation  The Newtown Branch/New York Short Line of the Reading Railroad (now SEPTA/CSX) separates Lawncrest from Montgomery County. Tookany/Tacony Creek also skirts through a portion of the Community. Two SEPTA Fox Chase Line Regional Rail stations serve the community: Lawndale Station at Robbins and Newtown Aves and Cheltenham Station at Martins Mill Road and Hasbrook Ave. Crescentville Station, closed in the 1970s, was located at the bottom of Godfrey Ave, behind Bond Bread and was nothing more than a dirt/gravel platform. A second Crescentville Station, which served the Frankford Branch of the Reading RR, was located directly behind the Bond Bread building on the south side of the railroad right of way. It was closed when passenger service ended on that branch in the 1930s. Several SEPTA bus lines also serve the community. The route 18 bus runs from Cedarbrook Mall‚ÄìOlney Terminal up to Fox Chase using Rising Sun, while the routes 19, 24, 26 and 67 buses serve the Eastern portions of the neighborhood, connecting to the Olney, Frankford and Fern Rock Transportation Centers via direct service or single transfer. All routes have connecting service to the Broad Street subway and Market-Frankford elevated lines.  Churches  There are about a dozen Protestant Churches within the Community, the oldest being Trinity Oxford Church which dates back to 1698. St. William's Parish, founded in 1920, covers most of the Crescentville end of the community and part of the lower end of Lawndale, from Magee Avenue South, while the upper end of Lawndale approximately covers the area of Presentation B.V.M. Parish which was founded in 1890 and also serves a large portion of the southeast corner of Cheltenham PA, in Montgomery County.  Hill Creek Apartments  Originally known as Hill Creek Project. The public housing project was built on 23.4 acres during Franklin Roosevelts Administration was opened in March, 1938, purportedly the last such project built during his administration. Located on a hill overlooking the Tookany Creek in North East Philadelphia on the corner of Rising Sun and Adams Avenues. in the area known as Lawncrest Administered by the Philadelphia Public Housing Authority, it has 334 units of single family, two story apartments. and provides Section 8 (housing) for low income families. Culture According to Kathleen McDonough, who grew up in the area, \\"Households were typically ones in which dad worked and mom stayed home.\\" \\\\- Opinion Schools It is in the School District of Philadelphia Most teens who live in Lawncrest attend either Northeast High School (public), or Samuel Fels High School (public). Two Public elementary schools served the area - Ben Franklin Universal Creighton Charter School,the Truebright Science Academy (a charter school grades 7-12) .and in addition, Presentation BVM Parish School and Cedar Grove Christian Academy (in the former Lawndale Public School building) serve the private sector in education. St. William Parish School Closed in 2012 and is now the location of MaST II Charter School. Until 1991 Students attended Olney High School. McDonough stated that children who attended public and Catholic schools were known as a \\"public\\" or a \\"Catholic\\", respectively, and that children tended to attend schools in their own communities.

Sarsfield, an officer and commander of . He disappeared after the sinking of his ship and was presumed dead on 11 July 1943. Sarsfield was laid down on 15 January 1945 by the Bath Iron Works Co., Bath, Maine and launched on 27 May 1945; sponsored by Mrs. Eugene S. Sarsfield. The ship was commissioned at Boston Naval Shipyard on 31 July 1945, with Commander Hepburn A. Pierce in command. Service history =Initial operations, 1945-1959= After the ship's fitting-out was complete, it sailed on 24 August, for Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and shakedown training. She returned to Boston on 30 September and, after post-shakedown alterations, got underway, on 25 October, for New York City and the Navy Day celebration. Following her stay at New York, she participated in training exercises in the Chesapeake Bay-Virginia Capes area until 13 December, when she entered the Brooklyn Navy Yard for installation of some experimental equipment. On 1 February 1946, Sarsfield sailed from New York bound for Key West, Florida. She arrived in Key West on 4 February to begin two decades with the Operational Development Force located there. Attached to the Surface Antisubmarine Development Detachment, Atlantic Fleet, she participated in the testing and evaluation of new weapons and equipment and made periodic training cruises in the Caribbean and in the Gulf of Mexico. In 1950, the ship helped the new Eastern Test Range out of Cape Canaveral test two U.S. Army Bumpers, which were German V-2 rockets modified to carry an upper stage. Sarsfield was stationed a mile or two from shore for the first, 48-mile Bumper launch, and tracked it with its Mk.25 fire director, which provided radar and optical tracking. In addition to the work she did for the Operational Development Force, Sarsfield also served the Naval Mine Countermeasures Station at Panama City, Florida, from 9 to 14 February 1947; conducted operations for the Underwater Sound Laboratory at New London, Connecticut, from 3 September 1953 until 18 October 1954; and operated out of Newport, Rhode Island, between 8 July and 4 August 1955. In 1956, she embarked VIPs for ASW demonstrations out of Key West and, in 1957, underwent overhaul at the Norfolk Navy Yard. On 6 February 1958, she joined units of Escort Squadron 14 at Charleston, South Carolina, for anti-submarine exercises. Following a cruise as plane guard to the aircraft carrier in early 1958, she returned to the Operational Development Force at Key West on 15 February. In the fall of 1958, Sarsfield entered Charleston Naval Shipyard for another overhaul. She departed Charleston on 5 January 1959 and conducted five weeks of refresher training out of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, after which she returned to Key West and further experimental work. =1960-1969= This employment, testing antisubmarine detection and destruction devices, continued until January 1961, when she was deployed, with shore bombardment responsibilities, to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Later that year, in June, Caribbean unrest again required the Navy to deploy ships. Sarsfield cruised off the coast of Hispaniola. In September 1961, Sarsfield took station in the Atlantic as a recovery ship for Project Mercury, the manned space flight program. In January 1962, she again took station for Project Mercury, this time off the coast of Africa. In August, she entered Boston Naval Shipyard for almost a year of Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) overhaul. Before leaving Boston, in June 1963, she received several new weapons systems, including ASROC, DASH, long-range, distant air search radar and long-range sonar. From Boston, she sailed to Guantanamo Bay for refresher training; then, to Charleston for another six months of weapons and sonar modifications. At the completion of these latest alterations, she cruised the Caribbean and then returned to Key West and the Operational Test and Evaluation Detachment. This employment continued until 1966. On 15 July, she again commenced overhaul, including still more sonar and radar changes. The overhaul was completed on 30 January 1967; and, by 7 February, she was back in Key West. Sarsfield spent the remainder of the month engaged in refresher training out of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. In April, she joined the aircraft carrier for ASW exercises; then, returned to Key West on 1 May to operate with the Fleet Sonar School. June and July were occupied by fleet exercises and NATO exercise, \\"Lashout\\". On 21 September, Sarsfield departed Key West for the Mediterranean and, on 17 December, returned home. In early 1968, she operated off the Virginia Capes and in the Caribbean. In July 1968, she deployed to the Middle East. She called at many exotic ports on her voyage along the coasts of Africa and the Indian Ocean littoral. While on this tour of duty, Sarsfield also had the unique opportunity to participate in a spontaneous exercise with units of the Imperial Ethiopian Navy and the French Air Force. By 30 December, she was underway for the western hemisphere and, on 10 January 1969, arrived in Mayport, Florida. Sarsfield remained in the western hemisphere for all of 1969 and 1970. During the first seven months of 1969, she resumed Caribbean and Atlantic operations. On 28 July, she commenced UNITAS X, an exercise involving elements of the United States, Brazilian, Argentine, Colombian, Chilean, Ecuadorian, Peruvian, Venezuelan and Uruguayan navies. In December, upon the completion of this exercise, during which she visited ports in all the countries named, Sarsfield returned to Mayport to prepare for overhaul. =1970-1977= From January to June 1970, she was at Charleston, South Carolina, undergoing overhaul. In June, she commenced eight weeks of refresher training out of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; and, upon completing it, returned to local operations out of Mayport for the rest of the year. In January 1971, Sarsfield again deployed to the Middle East, entering the Indian Ocean in February. Tensions were rising in the region; the Bangladesh Liberation War broke out in March and led to the war between India and Pakistan in December. By 29 June, she was back at Mayport and resumed normal operations for the rest of 1971 and for the first three months of 1972. On 13 April 1972, she got underway for an entirely different deployment. Proceeding via the Panama Canal, she arrived in Subic Bay, Philippines, on 11 May. Throughout the summer, Sarsfield plied the waters of the Gulf of Tonkin, first as plane guard for the carrier , then, patrolling off Hainan Island. She also participated in shore bombardment missions. She departed the gunline on 12 September; stopped at Hong Kong for six days of liberty (15 to 21 September) and at Yokosuka, Japan, for four days (25 to 29 September); and then, got underway to return to the United States. She entered San Diego on 13 October, transited the Panama Canal on 21 October, and reentered Mayport on 25 October. Upon her return, she resumed local operations out of Mayport. This employment continued until 29 May 1973, when she weighed anchor to join the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean. She sailed with the 6th Fleet until 22 September, when she passed through the Straits of Gibraltar to join NATO units in exercises in the Bay of Biscay and in the North Sea. On 10 October, she entered the Firth of Forth and, the next day, berthed at Edinburgh, Scotland. Two days later, at the outbreak of the Arab-Israeli War, she departed Scotland to reenter the Mediterranean with the carrier and sped to the eastern end of that sea. After more than a month of uncertainty, Sarsfield put into Athens, Greece, on 14 November for a five-day tender and leave period. On 18 November, she was ordered to rejoin John F. Kennedy for the voyage back to the United States. She arrived at Mayport on 1 December and spent the rest of 1973 in a standdown and leave status. She remained in port at Mayport, Florida until May 1974 at which time she resumed Atlantic seaboard operations. On 14 June 1974, in protest of perceived racism on the part of the command, nearly all of the ship's minority sailors occupied the fantail and refused orders to handle lines while Sarsfield was attempting a difficult mooring in an off-setting wind at the Charleston Naval Station. After being surrounded by the ship's Master-at-Arms force and being individually ordered by the Executive Officer, most of the demonstrating sailors returned to their quarters. Seven of them, however, refused to leave the quarterdeck despite direct orders to do so, and eventually left the ship without authority to do so. The seven sailors were eventually apprehended and originally charged with, among other things, mutiny. They were all eventually convicted of lesser charges in a joint General Courts Martial at NAS Jacksonville, Florida. In the fall of 1974, Sarsfield departed Mayport, Florida to participate in Northern Merger with NATO units, and enjoyed port visits in Plymouth, England and Edinburgh, Scotland, as well as Lubeck, West Germany. Sarsfield deployed on a Mediterranean cruise from 27 July 1975 to 27 January 1976, and enjoyed port visits in Gibraltar, BCC, Barcelona, Valencia, Rota and Algeciras, Spain, Siracusa and Taormina, Sicily, Naples, Italy, Palma, Mallorca, as well as Athens, and after transiting the Bosporus and Dardanelles, steamed in company with in the Black Sea. The year 1976 saw gunnery practice in Chesapeake Bay, and a short shipyard period in Charleston, South Carolina. Winter of 1976-1977 was the ship's last deployment to the Mediterranean as part of the task force. Port visits included Rota, Spain; Naples, Italy; Trapani, Sicily (helping the city recover from a flood); Kalamata, Greece (American-style hamburger cookout at the local orphanage at Christmas); Sfax, Tunisia; Palma and Morocco. She anchored off the coast of Egypt with dozens of Russian ships and monitored Russian submarine operations; as well as extensive operations as part of Roosevelts group. On return to the United States, many Taiwanese sailors joined the crew to learn ship operations before Sarsfield was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 October 1977. On the same day she was transferred to the Republic of China (Taiwan).

After an eight-year career as an infielder in the minor leagues, he became the acclaimed college baseball coach at Arizona State University (ASU) in 1959. Then, 13 years later, he returned to professional baseball as a manager, coach, front-office executive and broadcaster in the major leagues. Born in Tuckerman, Arkansas, and raised in nearby Swifton, Winkles was a graduate of Illinois Wesleyan University, where he became a member of the Sigma Chi Fraternity. A right-handed-hitting and -throwing shortstop, he played minor league baseball in the Chicago White Sox organization between 1951 and 1958, hitting .270 with 890 hits in 858 games played before retiring to become Arizona State's head baseball coach at age 29. Arizona State From 1959‚Äì1971 Winkles was the AZU Sun Devil baseball program's first varsity head coach. His overall record while head coach at ASU was 524‚Äì173, a winning percentage of .751, and he led ASU to its first three national titles (1965, 1967 and 1969). He also coached several notable players while he was at the helm of the Sun Devils, including Rick Monday, Sal Bando, Reggie Jackson, Sterling Slaughter and Larry Gura. Winkles was named the 1965 and 1969 NCAA Coach of the Year and The Sporting News Coach of the Year in 1965, 1967 and 1969. Winkles was inducted into the ABCA Collegiate Baseball Hall of Fame in 1997. His No. 1 jersey was honored at Packard Stadium and the field was named in his honor. Big league career In 1972, Winkles jumped from the Arizona State campus to the major leagues as a coach for the California Angels of the American League. In 1973, Winkles became the Angels' manager, succeeding Del Rice. His 1973 club won 79, lost 83 and finished fourth in the American League West Division. But in 1974, the Angels lost 44 of their first 75 games and Winkles was fired on June 26 and replaced with Dick Williams. On July 8, two weeks after the Angels fired him, Winkles became third base coach for the Oakland Athletics and was a member of their 1974 World Series championship team as well as their 1975 AL West champions under skipper Alvin Dark. After Dark's firing, Winkles then spent 1976 through June 25, 1977, as a coach for the cross-bay San Francisco Giants. On June 26, Winkles returned to the Athletics to manage Oakland for parts of the 1977 and 1978 seasons, as he replaced (in 1977) and then was succeeded by (in 1978) the same manager: Jack McKeon. The A's were then a struggling outfit in the final throes of the Charlie Finley era. But Winkles' 1978 team roared to a 19‚Äì5 start by May 5, and was still 24‚Äì15 after sweeping a doubleheader against the White Sox on May 21 when Winkles resigned with his club in first place in the AL West. Winkles was reported to have resigned because of Finley's micro- management style. His final managerial record: 170 wins, 213 defeats (.444). A coaching stint with the White Sox immediately followed Winkles' 1978 resignation as the A's manager, and he was a member of the White Sox staff through 1981. Then, from 1982‚Äì85, Winkles led the Chisox' player development department. He joined the Montreal Expos as a coach from 1986 through 1988, and then moved into the broadcast booth as an analyst on the Expos' radio network from 1989 through 1993. In 2006, he was inducted into the College Baseball Hall of Fame.

The venue, which opened in 1988, dates back to the early 1900s as a nickelodeon. Over the years, the venue has seen many incarnations ranging from concert hall to movie theatre to theatre. Known for its acoustics, it was voted as one of the best concert venues in America by Complex. History The theatre opened in 1908 as the \\"Crystal Palace\\", seating nearly 700. In 1927, the venue became a concert hall. In 1941, Warner Bros. Circuit Management Corporation took over management of the venue converting it into a movie theatre. Along with the changes came a new name, the \\"New Palace Theatre\\". The theatre‚Äôs popularity declined in the 50s. By 1959, the theatre saw another reincarnation, this time as a repertory theatre. The theatre operated under the direction of stage veteran Anne Ramsey and her husband Logan Ramsey. This is also when the name, \\"Theatre of the Living Arts\\" came into being. In 1964, Andre Gregory took over from the Ramseys as artistic director. The theatre proved to be a critical success, presenting 10 productions per season, all to high praise. Some troupe members included: Danny DeVito, Judd Hirsch, Sally Kirkland, Ron Leibman and Morgan Freeman. In 1967, a dispute with the board of directors resulted in Gregory leaving the theatre on February 17, 1967. At this time, the theatre was taken over by a new firm and christened as the \\"Bandbox Living Arts\\", a beatnik house. The theatre saw a decline in popularity and closed in 1969 due to financial issues. In 1970, business entrepreneur Al Malmfelt purchased the theatre. It reopened a year later as a single screen cinema; specializing in hard to see films. Nearly 20 films were shown per week. The movie house showed classic films, alongside art films, foreigns, serials and controversial films. There was also a monsters at midnight film series, with the venue showing horror films. In 1976, it premiered The Rocky Horror Picture Show. The TLA was the first theatre in Philadelphia to show this \\"midnight movie\\" which became an instant success with fans and led to weekly showings, encouraging the audience to dress as their favorite characters and return week after week. In 1978, the American Theater Arts for Youth used the venue for several productions including: Babes in Toyland, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and The Wizard of Oz. It left the venue in 1982 to seek a bigger audience. By November 1980, the theatre was once again in financial trouble. The theatre folded once again in 1981. Stephen Starr purchased the building for $600,000 in March 1981. He hoped to bring his Starr nightclub to a bigger facility, however, this was prevented by the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board and local residents of the neighborhood. Instead, Starr reopened the cinema under the name The Palace, however it closed again September 1981. In 1981, former employees Claire Brown Kohler, Eric Moore and Ray Murray began working on how to reopen the theatre. Together, they formed the Repertory Cinema, Inc. (later becoming the TLA Entertainment Group). When the theatre reopened, to save costs, the new team would travel round trip to New York City to exchange reels. Due to the success of VHS and cable television, the cinema saw a decline in attendance. In 1985, the team then opened TLA Video to cater to that audience. The initial store opened next to the theatre, however, four additional locations were added throughout the Philadelphia metro area. All stores closed in 2011. In 1986 the TLA premiered Jean-Luc Godard's Hail Mary which sparked outrage among Catholics. Many protesters picketed outside the TLA for a week while they showed the film. TLA on March 17, 2020 during City of Philadelphia Coronavirus pandemic In 1987, the cinema folded again. Allan Spivak purchased the theatre in September 1987. and renovations took place to convert the venue from a cinema into an off-Broadway type of theatre. Its first show was a production of the 1986 Outer Critics Circle Awards winning (and 2014 Tony Award winning) musical Lady Day (a musical based upon the life of Billie Holiday) which opened October 21, 1987. A year later, the theatre was converted into a concert venue. In 2007, Live Nation purchased the venue. It was briefly known as \\"The Fillmore at TLA\\" (commonly The Fillmore Philadelphia) until June 2008.  Facility  In addition to its various incarnations through the twentieth century, the building housing the TLA has also undergone transformations. After the New Palace Theatre became The Theatre of the Living Arts in 1959, in 1965 it underwent renovations designed by one of its founders, Philadelphia modernist architect Frank Weise. At that time the theatre expanded to the next door property, expanding the venue. The venue was later renovated in 2006 when Live Nation purchased the theatre and it became The Fillmore. The company updated the theatre with hardwood floors and three large chandeliers. The theatre is known for its memorabilia hanging on the dark red walls inside the venue.  Culture  South Street's reputation for entertainment extends to the turn of the twentieth century. However, in 1950 there was a major decline in real-estate value due to the proposal of a crosstown expressway that would have wiped out South Street. The Theatre of the Living Arts founding helped re-establish the street's entertainment culture and ushered in a, revival of the street. The theatre was a success during this time period selling over 250,000 tickets between 1964-1969. The TLA set the stage for the bohemian counter culture that flocked to this street along with other consumer and artistic venues. The street had a major rise in galleries and cafes that surrounded the TLA. South Street has become a center for alternative countercultures. In its current iteration as a concert venue, the theatre welcomes unknown and up-and-coming bands as well as bigger bands such as Red Hot Chili Peppers.  TLA Entertainment Group  The TLA entertainment group branched off of the TLA movie theatre and was originally the group that ran the theatre. The group was founded in 1981 by Ray Murray, Claire Brown Kohler, and Eric Moore. During this time the TLA was a movie theater where they showed an eclectic mix of movies including foreign films and cult classics. The entertainment group formed off of it and became a movie distribution store where they had a variety of obscure movies available for rent by catalog, online, and in their own retail stores. The original retail store opened right next door to the theatre. = TLA film controversy = In February 1986 the TLA found itself in the middle of a controversy when the theatre decided to show Jean-Luc Godard‚Äôs Hail Mary. The film was very controversial among Catholics at the time leading it to be denounced by Pope John Paul II in April 1985. In response to the announcement of the film's premiere, the TLA group received a hundred calls a day and two thousand letters in protest. The film was eventually shown at the TLA for a week and was met with picketers and protesters causing South Street to be shut down for the time being. = Pink Flamingos = The TLA has been accredited in helping launch filmmaker and writer John Waters's career. During its movie theatre days, the TLA played his cult classic movies such as Pink Flamingos when no other mainstream movie theatre would. Due to the huge success of his films at the TLA, other theatres followed making the TLA an important aspect of Pink Flamingos' and John Waters' success.

Boteach is the author of 30 books, including Kosher Sex: A Recipe for Passion and Intimacy (1999), and Kosher Jesus (2012). His outspokenness has earned him praise and criticism; Newsweek magazine named him one of the 50 most influential rabbis in the United States three years in a row, including sixth in 2010. He resides in Englewood, New Jersey. Early life Boteach attended and graduated from Hebrew Academy. Rabbinic career In 1988, Boteach was sent at age 22 by Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson as a Chabad-Lubavitch shaliach (emissary) to Oxford, England, where he served as rabbi to Oxford's students for 11 years and during that time founded the L'Chaim Society. Under Boteach's leadership the Oxford L'Chaim Society grew to be the second-largest student organization in Oxford's history, with a membership that included over 5,000 non-Jews. A dispute erupted when Boteach was asked to remove some non-Jewish students from the society, including future senator Cory Booker, but refused. Later that year Boteach won the \\"Preacher of the Year\\" Award from the London Times. In 2008, Boteach was named ninth on Newsweeks list of the \\"Top 50 Rabbis in America\\", and in 2009 he was named seventh. In 2010, Boteach was listed on the Newsweek list at number six. Boteach has faced widespread criticism from fellow rabbis during his career, especially following the release of his book Kosher Jesus. It was denounced as \\"heresy\\" by some rabbis. Jacob Immanuel Schochet, a Canadian rabbi, stated that the book \\"poses a tremendous threat to the Jewish community.\\" In 1999, then Chief Rabbi of United Hebrew Congregations, Jonathan Sacks, banned Boteach from speaking at the New West End Synagogue in Bayswater, London. Media career In 2006, Boteach hosted the television series Shalom in the Home. The series, which ran for two seasons on the TLC network, was a reality show in which Boteach counseled families and gave advice about relationships. In 2007, he was honored by the National Fatherhood Initiative with their most prestigious award for his efforts on Shalom in the Home and promoting the importance of a caring father in the contemporary family. He writes two syndicated columns, and is a frequent op-ed contributor to The Wall Street Journal, The Jerusalem Post and other newspapers. He speaks extensively in the United States, Israel, and other countries. Boteach hosted a weekly radio show on WABC called The Shmuley Show. He has made numerous guest appearances on The Oprah Winfrey Show and other television programs, including The Dr. Phil Show (as a relationship and marriage expert), The Dr. Oz Show, and others. Boteach hosted his own show on the Oprah XM Satellite Radio Network and his writings and quotes are published on the Oprah.com website.http://www.oprah.com/search.html?q=boteach In 2014, Boteach was a featured cast member in an episode for the Sundance Channel's Dream School series. He is founder of This World: The Values Network, an international organization dedicated to advancing universal Jewish values in the media and culture, and to affirming the Jewish people as a \\"light unto the nations\\". It has been reported by that in 2016, the network received over $1 million from Sheldon Adelson.Philip Weiss, 'A foreign leader ‚Äî Netanyahu ‚Äî set Trump‚Äôs agenda in Middle East, Michael Wolff book says,' Mondoweiss 4 January 2018. Michael Jackson In the 1990s, Boteach became a friend and unofficial spiritual advisor to Michael Jackson. Some Jewish commentators were critical. \\"Consorting with Michael Jackson might get Shmuley's name in the papers, but it's doubtful it will really encourage Jews to go to synagogue on Friday night\\", wrote Benjamin Soskis in Slate. Boteach was a vocal supporter of Jackson and \\"dismissive of suggestions that Jackson's relationships with children have been anything other than wholesome. Why would anyone believe those charges? They said anyone who spends that amount of time with kids has to be sick. Well, that's not an indictment of Michael Jackson, that's an indictment of our society!\\" He further stated: \\"I was friendly with Michael for a year before anyone knew about it. I did my own investigation. He never had sex with the child he made the settlement with, and there are no others.\\" In 2001, Boteach was involved in \\"Heal the Kids\\" or \\"Time for Kids\\", a charity founded by Jackson to encourage parents to spend more time with their children. Jackson and Boteach had a falling-out in 2002. After Michael Jackson died, Boteach published The Michael Jackson Tapes, a series of taped conversations he had with Jackson. Boteach said it was Jackson's wish that the conversations be published: \\"This book is being published because it was Michael Jackson's desperate wish that it be so,\\" he wrote in the prologue to the book. A second book was published in 2010: Honoring the Child Spirit: Inspiration and Learning from Our Children, in conversation with Michael Jackson. Views and opinions Boteach wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed column on homosexuality that it is \\"akin to the prohibition against lighting fire on the Sabbath or eating bread during Passover;\\" but contends that the Bible is not vague with regard to homosexuality‚Äîit stands in contravention to the divine will. He believes that the biggest threat to marriage doesn't come from gay marriage, but heterosexual divorce. Rabbi Shmuley Boteach opposes the government's involvement in recognizing marriage, but supports state- sanctioned civil unions for all. Boteach has opened a dialogue with Christians, and specifically with Messianic Jews, who are considered to be apostates by most Jews. In 2008, he debated Douglas Jacoby and Shabir Ally, on The True Legacy of Abraham, and the next year he debated Douglas Jacoby on \\"Judaism & Christianity: Which is the Religion of Peace?\\" In 2008, he debated with Michael Brown, a leader of the Messianic Jews, on whether belief in Jesus is compatible with Judaism, and in his book Kosher Jesus he depicts Jesus as \\"a Jewish patriot murdered by Rome for his struggle on behalf of his people.\\"Shmuley Boteach, Kosher Jesus (Gefen Publishing House, 2012, ). These positions have drawn opposition from many in the orthodox establishment, particularly from within the Chabad sect to which Boteach belongs. Rabbi Yitzchak Schochet, a leading British rabbi and a rival of Boteach's,Schochet and Boteach were rival candidates for the Chief Rabbinate of Britain. Simon Rocker, \\"Seconds out: rabbis scrap over Jesus Christ\\", TheJC.com, January 26, 2012. called Boteach's attempts to reach out to Messianic Jews \\"self- delusional\\", and Rabbi Immanuel Schochet of Toronto, Yitzchak Schochet's father, banned the book to Orthodox Jewish readers. \\"It is forbidden for anyone to buy or read this book,\\" he said in an interview. Boteach is known for his flamboyance and self-promotion. In a comment he later described as only having been sarcastic, he was reported as saying \\"God gave 10 commandments at Sinai, and the 11th commandment, which they expunged but which has come down orally, is 'Thou shalt do anything for publicity and recognition.'\\" Boteach is supportive of Israel, and critical of American policy towards the country. Boteach has argued that the Obama administration \\"bullied\\" Israel, arguing that U.S. Middle Eastern policy is \\"scandalous\\" and \\"disgusting\\". He is also supportive of Israeli settlements, including the Hebron settlement, the residents of which he characterizes as marked by a particular \\"warmth, friendliness and hospitality\\" and views as being \\"liberated from hatred.\\" Boteach was criticized by Jewish organizations for an ad placed in The New York Times which read \\"Susan Rice has a blind spot: Genocide\\", and that her action has \\"injected a degree of partisanship\\" that is \\"destructive of the fabric of the relationship\\" between the US and Israel. Rice had criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for agreeing to speak to Congress about Iran's nuclear program without coordinating with the Obama administration. Boteach apologized quoting that the disagreement was over policy and he did not intend a personal attack. Speaking to CNN, Boteach said the purpose of the ad was to bring attention to his perception that the United States government has ignored genocides in the past, and continues to do so. Boteach has also argued in favor of infant circumcision, defending the practice on religious grounds. He has publicly debated the issue with Eliyahu Ungar-Sargon, a Jewish intactivist (anti-circumcision activist) and filmmaker. 2012 Congressional run Boteach ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2012 elections. He supported making family counseling tax deductible. He received the endorsement of then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in April. Boteach won the Republican primary for New Jersey's 9th congressional district seat on June 5, and lost to 8th District Representative Bill Pascrell (whose old district was redistricted) in the November election, by a margin of 73.6% to 25.4%.2012 House Races, Politico.

The station is served by Sydney Trains T3 Bankstown line services. The station was designed by New South Wales Government Railways and built from 1895 to 1915 by J. J. Scouller. It is also known as Canterbury Railway Station group. The property was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. History Canterbury railway station in the early 20th century. =Bankstown line= Canterbury is located on the Sydenham to Bankstown Railway which was opened as far as Belmore on 1 February 1895 the same date on which the station was opened. The line had its origins in Railway Commissioner Goodchap's 1882 recommendation that an additional line was needed between Newtown and Liverpool to relieve traffic on the Southern Line and to encourage agriculture and suburban settlement. Lobbying by local interest groups and land speculators achieved Parliamentary approval by 1890 and construction commenced in 1892. The most important stations on the line, Belmore, Canterbury and Marrickville, were built with impressive near-identical brick buildings, the other intermediate stations (Campsie, Dulwich Hill and Hurlstone Park) receiving more modest timber buildings (later replaced), possibly reflecting economies of the depression of the 1890s. The depression suppressed the profitability of the line and the extension to Liverpool did not proceed. However, suburban development followed in the early twentieth century, particularly during the interwar period when many War Service homes were built west of Canterbury. The line was extended to Bankstown in 1909 (and then to Regents Park in 1928, making it part of a loop line through Lidcombe), its justification by then being the servicing of suburban development. Canterbury Station was expanded in 1915 in conjunction with construction of the Metropolitan Goods line. To the north of the station, lie two tracks that are part of the Goods Line. The westbound line has a platform face that has been fenced off. A platform on the eastbound line was demolished in 1995. These were previously used for raceday specials when Canterbury Park Racecourse was operating. Several sidings were located just beyond the station for stabling raceday trains. Canterbury signal box was commissioned on 13 December 1915 as part of the resignalling and track alterations of Canterbury station in preparation for the opening of the new Metropolitan Goods Line from Lidcombe via Enfield Marshalling Yards to Rozelle, in April 1916. The signal box was constructed with a mechanical interlocking lever frame using 68 of the 72 possible lever positions, which controlled the operation of signals and points in a set sequence. The signal box controlled all train movements through Canterbury on both the Bankstown suburban line and Metropolitan Goods line. Through ancillary lever frames \\"B\\" and \\"C\\", the signal box controlled the storage sidings for the Canterbury Racecourse special trains and the shunting of the local goods sidings. Two extensions have been added to the signal box. The western annex in 1937, and the eastern annex in 1968 to provide additional space to accommodate signalling relays, circuits and equipment. In 1994 a start was made on replacing the life expired signalling system and equipment on the Bankstown line and the Metropolitan Goods line. This resulted in the closure of Canterbury signal box on the weekend of 30‚Äì31 December 1996. After its closure it was sealed in its \\"as closed condition\\" by the Heritage Section of the State Rail Authority to preserve the building and its internal signalling equipment. All points (switches) at Canterbury have now been removed and signals are controlled from Sydenham Signalling Complex. Platforms and services Canterbury is a minor station. All express services in the eastbound and westbound direction skip Canterbury. Exceptions are some morning peak eastbound services, which stop at most stations, but skip one or two.  Description  The complex comprises two Type 11 platform buildings: Platform 1, erected in 1895, and Platform 2, erected in 1915; an Overhead Booking Office and Concourse, erected in the late 1980s; and a Signal Box erected in 1915. Other structures include Platforms 1 and 2, both completed in 1895; canopies, erected in the late 1980s; an overbridge, erected and a footbridge, erected in 1915 and later modified. =Context= Canterbury Railway Station consists of one wayside (Platform 2) on the south and one island (Platform 1) on the north, with both original platform buildings remaining. The northern side of the island platform is not used for passenger services. The wayside platform is accessed from the footbridge via a ramp, while the island platform is accessed by stairs. Even though Platform 1 has a ramp, it is not wheelchair accessible due to the ramp gradient and the three steps at the top of the ramp. An overhead booking office accessed from the Canterbury Road overbridge on the east and from Broughton Street on the north was rebuilt in the late 1980s. ;Platform BuildingPlatform 1 (1895) External: Rectangular polychromatic face brick building with gabled roof and surrounding cantilevered awning clad in corrugated roof sheeting. The face brick is in stretcher bond, with dark brick walls and lighter salmon coloured bricks forming a dado, framing the upper half of the windows and doors and with a diamond pattern dentil course at the high level. The building is eight bays in length, with the bays defined by engaged brick piers which coincide with the awning brackets. Original chimneys with cement mouldings and terracotta flues remain but have been painted. The cantilever awning is on filigreed steel brackets supported on decorative cement capped brick engaged piers and bolt fixings to the station building brick walls. The soffit lining is the underside of the corrugated steel roof fixed to intermediate exposed purlins. There is a decorative timber moulding at junction with brick wall. The canopy returns around the western end of the building but not the eastern or stair access end. The awning edges are finished with a decorative timber boarded valance. The external walls rise from a projecting brick plinth (now painted) with a decorative two part cement dado moulding which frames the salmon brick dado and is continuous between door and window openings. Decorative cement window and door frames rise above the dado moulding, each with a decorative keystone. The original window and door openings have segmental arches and the windows feature a decorative moulded cement sill. The original timber windows were double hung with a double paned lower sash and a multi-paned upper sash featuring coloured glass. Much of the original coloured window glass remains as well as the original fanlights above the door openings. The doors were timber panelled. The end brick gables feature a louvre within a round brisk window frames in salmon coloured voussoir shaped bricks with four cement keystones. Internal: The building comprises a booking hall entered by a set of double doors at the bottom of the stairs; a booking office; station masters room; general waiting room; ladies waiting room and ladies toilet, a lamp room and men's toilet. The internal usage has now changed, and the toilets have modern fitouts. All of these facilities are now closed to the public. Passengers are directed to use a public toilet just outside the station on Broughton St at the bus terminus. ;Platform BuildingPlatform 2 (1915) External: Rectangular face brick building with gabled corrugated steel roof and integral shallower sloped cantilevered awning. The face brick is in stretcher bond. The building is four bays in length, with the bays defined by engaged brick piers which coincide with the awning supports. The original chimney with cement mouldings and terracotta flue remains. The cantilever awning is on standard double bowed steel brackets supported on decorative cement haunches and bolt fixings to the station building brick walls. The soffit lining is the underside of the corrugated steel roofing fixed to intermediate exposed purlins. There is a decorative timber moulding at junction with brick wall. Vertical timber boards form valances at each end of awning. The external walls rise from a projecting brick plinth three/four courses high with a decorative dado moulding run in cement which is continuous between door and window openings. Decorative cement window and door frames rise above the dado moulding. The original window openings feature a moulded cement sill with a scalloped fringe. The original timber windows were double hung with a single paned lower sash and a six paned upper sash featuring coloured glass, with glass louvres in the toilet windows. The original window glass as well as the upper glazing bars has been removed from all but one window. Original door openings featured fanlights matching the upper window sashes. All the original timber panelled doors have been removed. Internal: The building comprises a general waiting room; ladies room and ladies toilets and men's toilets. The internal usage has now changed and the toilets have modern fitouts and finishes. The waiting room and ladies room have original ripple iron ceiling, ceiling rose and plaster wall finishes. ;Overhead Booking Office (late 1980s) The original timber clad overhead booking office has been demolished and replaced by a new steel framed metal hipped roof structure. This building is used as the station office, as well as housing a small shop. ;Signal Box (1915) External: Canterbury signal box is located beside the Bankstown suburban line, in the Canterbury Station precinct. It is a two-storey timber framed structure clad in \\"checked and chamfered\\" weather boards. It has a hipped, galvanised corrugated iron roof with wide eaves on all sides. The first floor (or operating level) has wood framed, sliding windows on three sides with a blank rear wall. On the eastern end of the building there is a landing, incorporating an enclosed toilet. The landing extends past the front of the building over a public walkway to a flight of metal stairs. The ground floor incorporates the interlocking room and relay room. The interlocking room has four windows in the front wall. In the rear is the relay room, featuring four windows in the rear wall. The eastern extension is flat roofed and is constructed of precast concrete panels between exposed verticals simulating timber weatherboards. There is one door at the eastern end of this extension (2009). Internal: The interior walls and ceiling of the first floor are lined with wall boards, and the timber floor is covered in linoleum. On the ground floor, the interlocking room is unlined, and the long and narrow lined relay room houses signalling relays which control the operation of signalling circuits. ;Platforms (1895) Platform 1 has an asphalt surface with its original brick face and a concrete edge. The northern or \\"goods\\" side of this platform is constructed in the same manner. Platform 2 also has its original brick face with a concrete edge. ;Footbridge (1915) Haunched beam design consists of tapered cantilevers bearing on platform trestles and brick piers on each side support shallow beams over the railway tracks. The footbridge has been modified at a later unknown date. ;Overbridge () The overbridge consists of steel girders supporting a jack arched brick and concrete deck. The girders span the Up and Down lines supported on concrete and brick abutment walls. The parapet walls are brick. ;Canopies (late 1980) New steel framed and metal roof clad canopies have been erected over the access stairs to the island platform and at the eastern end of the wayside station building, as well as the access ramp. = Condition = The platform buildings are generally in good condition. The overhead booking office is in good condition. The Signal Box exterior is in reasonably good condition with some peeling of paint. A fire caused some internal damage to the rear wall and ceiling of the operating level and there is evidence of past white ant activity.Moonie, Jeff. 2000. The platforms are generally in good condition. and in good condition are both the over bridge and the canopies. When the signal box was closed in 1996 the Heritage Section of former State Rail Authority had the building sealed in its final operating state. This action had the effect of maintaining the signal box in its as closed condition, preserving the mechanical interlocking lever frame and associated signalling equipment in a complete condition and it is therefore of high integrity. The footbridge retains its original haunched beam structure but has a new concrete floor, new balustrades and canopy cover. The access stairs to Platform 1 are modern. The overbridge retains all of its original steel beams and jack arches as well as the brick abutments, piers and parapet walls. ;Platform BuildingPlatform 1 Externally, the station building retains most of the original detailing. Some windows have been modified by the insertion of fibreglass vandal-proof sheeting into the sashes, but a number of windows and fanlights retain the coloured glazing. Original roof vents have been removed, and the face brick chimneys painted. The male toilet modesty screen has been removed and three external doors have been replaced by flush doors. Internally, although the toilets have modern fixtures, a substantial amount of the original finishes remain. This includes plaster wall finishes, plaster ceilings and cornices, ceiling roses, the ticket window framing in the booking hall, benches and cupboards in the booking office. ;Platform BuildingPlatform 2 Externally the station building retains most of the original detailing. Some windows have been modified by the insertion of fibreglass vandal-proof sheeting into the sashes, but a number of windows retain the coloured glazing, especially on the rear side. Original roof vents have been removed, and the face brick chimneys painted. The male toilet modesty screen has been removed and the external door has been replaced by a flush door. Internally, although the toilets have modern fixtures, a substantial amount of the original finishes remain. This includes plaster wall finishes, plaster ceilings, cornices, and ceiling roses. The female toilet retains the early partitions, but with new fixtures. The original mantelpiece remains in the waiting room but the fireplace is gone. = Modifications and dates = The station has been modified since its establishment in 1895 as follows: *1895Water tanks erected on eastern end of platform *1906Platforms lengthened *1915New building on Platform 3; signal box built *1916Goods line laid through station *1926Railway electrified *1927Track realigned, the Down Bankstown track alongside a new Down side platform; the Up Bankstown track alongside the old Up island platform; the Down Goods track replacing the middle storage siding and the Up Goods track replacing the racecourse siding; No 1 to No 7 car sidings at the racecourse opened and all were electrified *1937Western annex added to signal box and constructed of timber matching the main building *1968Eastern annex was added to signal box in precast concrete components *Late 1980sNew overhead booking office *1996Signal Box closed *n.d.As the timber yard to the south has been in existence for at least three decades the goods yard and goods shed between Charles Street and the station is believed to have been demolished for sometime Transport links Transit Systems operate five routes via Canterbury station: *Departing from Broughton St Terminus: **428: Canterbury to Martin Place **L28: Canterbury to Martin Place (limited stop, peak hour only) **487: Canterbury to Bankstown Central Shopping Centre *Departing from Canterbury Rd stop: **445: Campsie to Balmain **491: Five Dock to Hurstville *Canterbury station is served by one NightRide route: **N40: East Hills station to City (Town Hall)  Heritage listing  As at 18 November 2010, Canterbury Railway Station possesses historical significance as it is a station on the Sydenham to Bankstown Line which was constructed to relieve congestion on the Main South Line as well as to encourage suburban development and the growth of agriculture in the late 19th and early 20th century. The main platform building represents the period of transition from the boom time of the 1880s to the standardisation of NSW railway building design from the 1890s onwards. Canterbury Railway Station is significant at the state level as the Platform 1 Building demonstrates the high level of aesthetic design of the pre-1900 standard railway buildings, which included the use of polychromatic brickwork, decorative dentil coursing, ornate awning brackets and carved bargeboards. This platform building is relatively intact and is representative of a small group of such ornate platform buildings including Marrickville and Belmore on the Bankstown Line. The Canterbury signal box is of historical significance as it is representative of the development of railway signalling technology in the first decades of the 20th century. As it was is intact internally it is capable of providing information about the workings of a signal box of this era. Canterbury railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Canterbury Railway Station has historical significance as it is one of the railway stations on the Sydenham to Bankstown Line built to relieve the crowding on the Main Southern Line and encourage agriculture and suburban growth in the late 1800s and early 20th century. The brick building on Platform 1 represents that period which marked the transition from the boom period of the 1880s to the standardisation of NSW Railways building design of the 1890s and onwards. The signal box is of historical significance because it represents railway signalling technology in use at the time of its construction in 1915. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The platform building on Platform 1 at Canterbury station has state aesthetic and technical significance because it exemplifies the particular design and style of brick island buildings erected by the NSW Railways prior to 1900 which possessed high qualities of aesthetic features such as polychromatic brickwork, dentilled brick cornices and cement mouldings which distinguish it from other platform building types. Canterbury signal box is technically significant as a structure purpose designed and built to house a large mechanical interlocking lever frame and its associated signalling equipment and being in \\"as working\\" condition is well able to demonstrate the features of a signal box of this era. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The place has the potential to contribute to the local community's sense of place and can provide a connection to the local community's history. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. At the time of its closure the signal box was fully operational and has been retained in that state, which allows the opportunity to observe early 1900s railway signalling technology in its original working environment. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The signal box building design is rare within the metropolitan area, though other examples exist in regional locations. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The building on Platform 1 is representative of the high architectural quality of a pre-1900 standard station building design. It's styling reflected the importance of the station at that time, the other important stations on the Bankstown line with the same design being Marrickville and Belmore. The building on Platform 2 is also representative of a standard design of railway building commonly utilised by the railways during the 1910/20s. The signal box is representative of a large elevated mechanical interlocking railway signal box.

History  The first horse racing in Canterbury was in 1852 when Cornelius Proud cleared part of his property for use as a racecourse, this was used regularly by locals. In 1871, after a few years with no race meetings being held, Frederick Clissold and Thomas Austen Davis held a race meeting on land that had been leased by Davis close to the existing racecourse.

In this approach, one determines the absolute structure of a noncentrosymmetric crystal. The processes used to decide the absolute structure use the anomalous dispersion effect. If atomic scattering factors did not have imaginary parts, the Friedel pairs would have exactly the same amplitudes (i.e., the scattering intensity F(h k l)^{2} from crystal plane (h k l) is equal to F(-h -k -l)^{2}). However, atomic scattering factors have imaginary parts due to the anomalous dispersion effect, and Friedel's law is broken by this effect. There are several ways to determine the absolute structure by X-ray crystallography. For example, a comparison of the intensities of Bijvoet pairs or of the R-factors for the two possible structures can suggest the correct absolute structure. One of the more powerful and simple approaches is using the Flack parameter, because this single parameter clearly indicates the absolute structure. The Flack parameter is calculated during the structural refinement using the equation given below: :\\\\ I(hkl) = (1-x)F(h k l)^{2} + xF(-h -k -l)^{2} where x is the Flack parameter, I is the square of the scaled observed structure factor and F is the calculated structure factor. By determining x for all data, x is usually found to be between 0 and 1. If the value is near 0, with a small standard uncertainty, the absolute structure given by the structure refinement is likely correct, and if the value is near 1, then the inverted structure is likely correct. If the value is near 0.5, the crystal may be racemic or twinned. The technique is most effective when the crystal contains both lighter and heavier atoms. Light atoms usually show only a small anomalous dispersion effect. In this case, the Flack parameter can refine to a physically unrealistic value (less than 0 or greater than 1) and has no meaning. This parameter, introduced by H. D. Flack became one of a standard set of values being checked for structures with noncentrosymmetric space groups.

He was a victim of the mass killing of Bengali intellectuals in 1971. He was awarded Independence Day Award in 1980, by the then President Ziaur Rahman's government, posthumously. Early life and education Choudhury's ancestors were originated from Noakhali. He was born on 27 November 1925 in Manikganj. His father was Khan Bahadur Abdul Halim Chowdhury, a district magistrate and Aligarh Muslim University graduate. His mother was Umme Kabir Afia Begum (d. 2000). Because of his father's official assignment, Choudhury lived in Manikganj, Pirojpur and other parts of East Bengal. The family moved to Dhaka permanently in 1936. Then he grew up in the residence Darul Afia, named after her mother, among 14 siblings. He completed his matriculation from Dhaka Collegiate School in 1941 and intermediate examination from Aligarh Muslim University. He then studied English literature for his bachelor's degree (with honours) in 1946 and master's in 1947 at the University of Dhaka. He was expelled from Salimullah Hall, his residential dorm, because of his involvement in leftist politics. He was imprisoned for two years in 1952 for his participation in the Bengali Language Movement. While in jail, in 1954, he appeared at the master's examination in Bengali literature and stood first in the first class. Later, in 1958, he obtained his third master's degree in linguistics from Harvard University. Academic career In 1947, Choudhury started his career in teaching at Brajalal College in Khulna. He moved to Jagannath College in Dhaka in 1950. He joined the University of Dhaka in 1950 and taught both in the departments of English and Bengali until 1971. He became reader in 1962 and professor in 1970 and the dean of the faculty of arts in 1971. Political activity Choudhury was associated with leftist politics and progressive cultural movements. In 1948, he attended the Communist Party Conference in Kolkata. He was elected Secretary of the \\"Pragati Lekhak O Shilpi Sangha\\" (Progressive Writers and Artists Association). In 1952, he was arrested under the Preventive Detention Act for protesting against police repression and the killing of students on the Language Movement. In 1967, he protested the Pakistan government's ban on Tagore songs on radio and television. In the early 1950s, there was a movement in Pakistan to replace the Bengali language alphabet with the Arabic alphabet. As a linguist and writer, Choudhury protested this move to undermine the native language of East Pakistan. He actively participated in the non-co- operation movement during the early part of 1971 and renounced his award Sitara-e-Imtiaz, awarded by the Government of Pakistan in 1966. Literary works During his imprisonment in 1952-54, he wrote his symbolic drama on the historic language movement, Kabar (The Grave). He continued to write after being freed from prison, some of his notable works being Roktakto Prantor (1959; a play about the Third Battle of Panipat), Chithi (1966) and Polashi Barrack O Onyanno (1969). In 1965, Choudhury redesigned the keyboard of the Bangla typewriter, named Munier Optima Keyboard in collaboration with Remington typewriters of the then East Germany. * Mir-Manas, 1965 ‚Äì literary critique of Mir Mosharraf Hossain's literature * Ektala-Dotala (first ever Bengali drama telecast on television), 1965 * Dandakaranya, 1966 * Tulanamulak Samalochana (Comparative critique), 1969 * Bangla Gadyariti (Bengali literary style), 1970 Awards * Bangla Academy Literary Award (1962) * Daud Prize (1965) * Sitara-i-Imtiaz (denounced, 1966) * Independence Day Award (posthumously, 1980) Death After the Pakistani army crackdown in 1971 in the University of Dhaka area from which Chowdhury escaped like many, he moved to his parents' house, near Hatirpool. On 14 December 1971, he, along with a large number of Bengali intellectuals, educators, doctors and engineers, were kidnapped from their houses and later tortured and executed by the Pakistan Army and its Bengali collaborators Al-Badr and Al-Shams. According to a witness, Choudhury was last seen in Physical Training College in Mohammadpur Thana, Dhaka where his fingers were mutilated. His dead body could not be identified. On 18 July 2013, Asif Munier Chowdhury Tonmoy, a son of Choudhury, made the statement before the International Crimes Tribunal-2. According to his testimony, Chowdhury Mueen-Uddin, a Muslim leader based in London, and Ashrafuz Zaman Khan, based in the United States, were directly involved in abduction, forced disappearance and killing of Choudhury. On 3 November the same year, both of them were sentenced in absentia after the court found that they were involved in the abduction and murders of 18 people ‚Äì nine Dhaka University teachers including Choudhury, six journalists and three physicians ‚Äì in December 1971. Personal life Choudhury with his wife Lily (1957) Choudhury was married to Lily Choudhury. Together they had three sons, Ahmed Munier, Ashfaque Munier (Mishuk) and Asif Munier. Ashfaq was a cinematographer. Ahmed is retired and previously worked for UN missions in Africa. Asif is a human rights activist and works in the development sector. He was a founder member of Projonmo Ekattor, a human rights group. Choudhury's notable siblings include actress Ferdousi Mazumder, National Professor Kabir Chowdhury (d. 2011), columnist Shamsher Choudhury (d. 2012) and language activist Nadera Begum (d. 2013). Legacy Since 1989, a Bangladeshi theater troupe named Theatre has been conferring theater personalities for their contribution to the performing art form with Munier Chowdhury Shammanona award. Bangla Academy confers Shaheed Munier Choudhury Memorial Award to book publishing houses for the merit of quality of printing and aesthetic values. Central Road, the street in Dhaka where Choudhury lived, was renamed to Shaheed Munier Chowdhury Road. In 1991, on the 20th anniversary of Bangladesh's independence, the government issued a commemorative stamp featuring Choudhury.

Elephant jokes were a fad in the 1960s, with many people constructing large numbers of them according to a set formula. Sometimes they involve parodies or puns. Examples of elephant jokes are: :Q: Why did the elephant paint its toenails red? :A: So it could hide in a cherry tree. :Q: How can you tell that an elephant is in the bathtub with you? :A: By the smell of peanuts on its breath. :Q: Why does an elephant have round flat feet? :A: So that it can walk across lily pads. History In 1960, L.M. Becker Co of Appleton, Wisconsin, released a set of 50 trading cards titled \\"Elephant Jokes\\". They were recorded in mid-1962 in Texas, and gradually spread across the US, reaching California in early 1963. By July 1963, elephant jokes were ubiquitous and could be found in newspaper columns, and in Time and Seventeen magazines, with millions of people working to construct more jokes according to the same formula. Both elephant jokes and Tom Swifties were in vogue in 1963, and were reported in the US national press. While Tom Swifties were marketed to literate adults and gradually fell out of fashion over subsequent decades, elephant jokes have lasted among younger audiences, circulating through generations of schoolchildren. Prolific science fiction writer Isaac Asimov was of the opinion that these jokes are \\"favorites of youngsters and of unsophisticated adults\\". However, he finds one joke uncharacteristically sophisticated enough to include in his book of favorite jokes. The joke was told in the aftermath of the murder of Lee Harvey Oswald by Jack Ruby, who had walked into Dallas police headquarters carrying a gun: :Q: What did the Dallas chief of police say when the elephant walked into the police station? :A: Nothing! He didn't notice. Structure  Elephant jokes rely upon absurdity and incongruity for their humor, and a contrast with the normal presumptions of knowledge about elephants. They rely upon absurdist reasoning such as that it would be the relatively incidental evidence regarding the smell of an elephant's breath or the presence of footprints in the butter that would allow for the detection of an elephant in one's bathtub or refrigerator. One key to the construction of an elephant joke is that the joke answers are somewhat appropriate if one merely overlooks the obvious absurdities inherent to the questions. If elephants were capable of climbing trees and if painting an elephant's toenails was an effective camouflage mechanism, then red would be the appropriate color for a cherry tree. If the common connotation that questions requesting the time are expected to be answered in terms of hours and minutes is ignored, then by the implied destruction of one's fence from being sat on by an elephant, it would be time to build a new fence. The appropriateness of the answer, when accounting for the absurd incongruences existing between the implied premise of the question and the normal assumptions said question invokes, distinguishes elephant jokes as jokes rather than nonsensical riddles. = As a riddle = Elephant jokes are often parodies of conventional children's riddles. Consider the following commonly recited child's riddle: :Q: What is red and blue all over? :A: A newspaper. Traditionally the challenge of solving this riddle relies on recognizing the ambiguity stemming from the riddle being generally shared aloud as opposed to in writing. Thus the appropriate homophone, \\"red\\" or \\"read\\", must be inferred. If \\"red\\" is assumed, then the problem arises regarding whether or not any object satisfying the condition of being \\"red all over\\" would necessarily preclude said object from also satisfying the requirement of being \\"black and white\\". However, if instead \\"read\\" is assumed, then there is no implied mutual exclusivity preventing a solution, conventionally a newspaper, from satisfying both required conditions. Compare the traditional riddle, which is solved by a well-known item that can be reasonably determined from the riddle, with the elephant joke parody: :Q: What is black and white and red all over? :A: An elephant dressed as a nun suffering from sunburn. The absurdity of an elephant wearing a nun costume makes it nearly impossible for anyone not familiar with the punchline to independently think of the parody answer. Ignoring how unlikely one is to ever encounter an elephant dressed as a nun, then the answer is somewhat appropriate. A nun costume would likely be both \\"black and white\\" and a sunburn would cause an elephant to be, somewhat, \\"red all over\\". Humor arises from the irony of ignoring the expected answer for the outlandish, yet appropriate, elephant answer. A turnabout to the \\"Blind men and an elephant\\" parable is a joke about four blind elephants who feel a human. The first reports that humans are flat, and the other three agree. = Series of elephant jokes = A series of elephant jokes can be constructed. Linking the appropriateness of each subsequent answer to the logically absurd structure of the preceding joke, the overall absurdity of a series can continuously compound. For example: :Q: How do you shoot a blue elephant? :A: With a blue elephant gun. :Q: How do you shoot a yellow elephant? :A: Have you ever seen a yellow elephant? :Q: How do you shoot a red elephant? :A: Hold his trunk shut until he turns blue, and then shoot him with the blue elephant gun. :Q: How do you shoot a purple elephant? :A: Paint him red, hold his trunk shut until he turns blue, and then shoot him with the blue elephant gun. The absurdity of the first riddle's answer subverts the audience's initial expectations. The second and third riddles reinforce the expectation for this logically absurd structure. The final riddle concludes by again absurdly subverting the audience's expected framework. The humor for independent elephant jokes relies on absurd answers that ignore expectations, yet have a certain appropriateness. Here the absurdity is compounded when the appropriateness of the final riddle's answer is dependent upon undermining the logically absurd structure built from the preceding riddles. One short example involves a displacement of a concept from one animal's features to those of an elephant, in terms of function: :Q: Why do ducks have flat feet? :A: To stamp out burning fires. :Q: Why do elephants have flat feet? :A: To stamp out burning ducks. In another example: :Q: How many elephants will fit into a Mini? :A: Four: Two in the front, two in the back. :Q: How can you fit five elephants into a Mini? :A: Don't be silly; there isn't room for five elephants in a Mini. :Q: Well, can you fit five elephants into a Volkswagen Beetle? :A: Sure: Two in front, two in the back, one in the glove box, and pack the trunks in the boot (British English for \\"trunk\\"). :Q: How many giraffes will fit into a Mini? :A: None. It's full of elephants. :Q: How do you get two whales in a Mini? :A: Along the M4 and across the Severn Bridge. :Q: How do you know there is an elephant in your refrigerator? :A: There are footprints in the butter. :Q: How do you know there are two elephants in your refrigerator? :A: You can hear giggling when you close the door. :Q: How do you know there are three elephants in your refrigerator? :A: You can't close the door. :Q: How do you know there are four elephants in your refrigerator? :A: There's an empty Mini parked outside. Elephant jokes thus not only deliberately undermine the conventions of riddles, they even act to undermine themselves. This even extends to undermining the implied premise, expected by those that are familiar with elephant jokes, that an elephant joke is automatically illogical, or even involves elephants at all. For example: :Q: What do elephants have that nothing else has? :A: Baby elephants. :Q: What is gray, has four legs, and a trunk? :A: A mouse going on vacation. :Q: What is brown, has four legs, and a trunk? :A: A mouse coming back from vacation. :Q: What has eight legs, two trunks, four eyes, and two tails? :A: Two elephants. There can even be an off-color tinge: :Q: Why is an elephant big, grey and wrinkly? :A: Because if it were small, white and smooth it would be an aspirin. :Q: Why are golf balls small and white? :A: Because if they were big and grey they would be elephants. One time Gong Show act Mike Elephant is remembered for the following joke: :Q: What's the difference between an elephant and a plum? :A: Their color. :Q: What did Tarzan say to Jane when he saw the elephants coming? :A: Here come the elephants. :Q: What did Jane say to Tarzan when she saw the elephants coming? :A: Here come the plums; she was color blind. Some may be regional: :Q: How do you get a herd of Addo elephants out of your bedroom? :A: Sit outside and scream like an orange. (In the early days of the park, surplus oranges were used to tempt Addo elephants to viewing sites for tourists.) Elephant jokes can also use their inherent absurdity to point up the inherent absurdity in some current events. One such joke from the early 1960s refers to an incident in President Kennedy's on-again-off-again support for Cuban exiles' attempts to overthrow Fidel Castro: :Q: How do you get 2,000 elephants to invade Cuba? :A: Promise them air support! : Symbolism Elephant jokes are seen by many commentators as symbolic of the culture of the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1960s. Elliott Oring notes that elephant jokes dismiss conventional questions and answers, repudiate established wisdom, and reject the authority of traditional knowledge. He draws a parallel between this and the counterculture of the 1960s, stating that \\"disestablishment was the purpose of both,\\" pointing to the sexual revolution and noting that \\"[p]erhaps it was no accident that many of the elephant jokes emphasized the intrusion of sex into the most innocuous areas.\\" In their paper, On elephantasy and elephanticide, Abrahams and Dundes consider elephant jokes to be convenient disguises for racism, and symbolised the nervousness of white people about the civil rights movement. Whilst blatantly racialist jokes became less acceptable, elephant jokes were a useful proxy. One example Abrahams and Dundes provide is the joke: :Q: What is big and grey and comes in quarts? :A: An elephant. They state that the \\"big and grey and comes in quarts\\" is in fact a reference \\"to the supposed mammoth nature of black sexuality.\\" Similarly, the joke about an elephant in the bathtub is argued to be a reference to the increased intrusion of black people into \\"the most intimate areas of white life.\\" Oring strongly disagrees with this view, writing: \\"The Civil Rights movement, of course, was an integral part of the countercultural revolution. But there is no reason to view it as the single force conditioning the joke cycle. Much more than the relations between the races was being turned on its ear. Reducing elephant jokes to a mere front for racial aggression, it seems to me, not only misses the larger sense of what the jokes are about, but the larger sense of what was going on in the society at the time.\\" and continuing: \\"Elephant joking is more than a description of the episodic career of an animal with a phallic nose. What engenders the humor in such jokes is the violation of categories of expectation, and not images of subjugation, degradation, or feminization of the elephant.\\" Charles Gruner agrees with Oring that Abrahams' and Dundes' explanation (that \\"the elephant is an ambivalent father figure\\" that is, in reality, \\"the black man (perceived as a sexual threat) that stands hidden behind the image of the elephant\\") is an \\"explanation from Freudian Monsterland [that] holds no water.\\" Gruner however disagrees with Oring about the chronological topicality of the elephant joke and its relation to social upheavals, arguing from personal experience of \\"one of the best motion picture sight gags in history\\", where Jimmy Durante in the 1962 movie Billy Rose's Jumbo is attempting to sneak an elephant unseen through a circus. Upon coming around a tent and being faced with a crowd of people and a policeman who demands \\"Where do you think you are you going with that elephant?\\" Durante backs against the elephant, arms wide, and asks, innocently, \\"What elephant?\\" Gunder proposes that the success of this sight gag spawned in comic writers the idea of \\"hiding the elephant by all sorts of ridiculous means,\\" and thus, by extension to \\"other silly, stupid comparisons\\", the whole genre of elephant jokes.

It grows up to tall. In Japan, where the tree is called kusunoki, five camphor trees are known with a trunk circumference above , with the largest individual, , reaching 24.22 m. The leaves have a glossy, waxy appearance and smell of camphor when crushed. In spring, it produces bright green foliage with masses of small white flowers. It produces clusters of black, berry-like fruit around in diameter. Its pale bark is very rough and fissured vertically. Uses Camphor grove in Hong Kong C. camphora is cultivated for camphor and timber production. The production and shipment of camphor, in a solid, waxy form, was a major industry in Taiwan prior to and during the Japanese colonial era (1895‚Äì1945). It was used medicinally and was also an important ingredient in the production of smokeless gunpowder and celluloid. Primitive stills were set up in the mountainous areas in which the tree is usually found. The wood was chipped; these chips were steamed in a retort, allowing the camphor to crystallize on the inside of a crystallization box after the vapour had passed through a cooling chamber. It was then scraped off and packed out to government-run factories for processing and sale. Camphor was one of the most lucrative of several important government monopolies under the Japanese. The wood has an insect-repellent quality. = Camphor = Camphor is a white crystalline substance, obtained from the tree C. camphora. Camphor has been used for many centuries as a culinary spice, a component of incense, and as a medicine. It is also an insect repellent and a flea-killing substance. =Chemical constituents= The species contains volatile chemical compounds in all plant parts, and the wood and leaves are steam distilled for the essential oils. Camphor laurel has six different chemical variants called chemotypes, which are camphor, linalool, 1,8-cineole, nerolidol, safrole, and borneol. In China, field workers avoid mixing chemotypes when harvesting by their odour.Hirota, N. and Hiroi, M., 1967. ‚ÄòThe later studies on the camphor tree, on the leaf oil of each practical form and its utilisation‚Äô, Perfumery and Essential Oil Record 58, 364-367.Lawrence, B. M., 1995. ‚ÄòProgress in essential oils‚Äô, Perfumer and Flavorist, 20, 29-41. The cineole fraction of camphor laurel is used in China to manufacture fake \\"eucalyptus oil\\".Ashurst, P.R., Food Flavorings, 1999 The chemical variants (or chemotypes) seem dependent upon the country of origin of the tree. e.g., C. camphora grown in Taiwan and Japan is normally very high in linalool, often between 80 and 85%. In India and Sri Lanka, the high camphor variety/chemotype remains dominant. C. camphora grown in Madagascar, though, is high in 1,8-cineole (averaging between 40 and 50%). The essential oil from the Madagascar trees is commercially known as ravintsara. Invasive species =In Australia= C. camphora in the public Botanic Gardens in Adelaide, South Australia Camphor laurel in fruit at Turramurra railway station, Australia Camphor laurel was introduced to Australia in 1822 as an ornamental tree for use in gardens and public parks. It has become a noxious weed throughout Queensland and central to northern New South Wales, where it is suited to the wet, subtropical climate. However, the tree provides hollows quickly in younger trees, whereas natives can take hundreds of years to develop hollows.Noxious weed declaration for NSW The camphor content of the leaf litter helps prevent other plants from germinating successfully, helping to ensure the camphor's success against any potentially competing vegetation, and the seeds are attractive to birds and pass intact through the digestive system, ensuring rapid distribution. Camphor laurel invades rainforests and pastures, and also competes against eucalyptus trees, certain species of which are the sole food source of koalas. =In the United States= Introduced to the contiguous United States around 1875, C. camphora has become naturalized in portions of Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Texas, and South Carolina. It has been declared a category I invasive species in Florida. Insect pests In Australia, two native Lepidoptera insects, the purple brown-eye and common red-eye, larval stages feed on camphor despite it being an introduced plant.Wells, A., Edwards, E.D., Houston, W.W.K., Lepidoptera: Hesperioidea, Papilionoidea, Volume 31, CSIRO, 2001.

Known for pioneering a change in the portrayal of women in Hindi cinema with her roles in female-led films, she is the recipient of several awards, including a National Film Award and six Filmfare Awards. She was awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India in 2014. Vidya aspired to a career in film from a young age and had her first acting role in the 1995 sitcom Hum Paanch. While pursuing a master's degree in sociology from the University of Mumbai, she made several unsuccessful attempts to start a career in film, and featured in television commercials and music videos. She made her film debut by starring in the Bengali film Bhalo Theko and received praise for her first Hindi film, the drama Parineeta. This was followed by commercial successes in Lage Raho Munna Bhai (2006) and Bhool Bhulaiyaa (2007), but her roles in the romantic comedies Heyy Babyy (2007) and Kismat Konnection (2008) had negative reviews. Vidya went on to establish herself by starring in five consecutive commercial successes, which also earned her critical and awards recognition. These were in the drama Paa (2009), the black comedy Ishqiya (2010), the thrillers No One Killed Jessica and Kahaani (2012), and the biopic The Dirty Picture (2011). The last of these won her the National Film Award for Best Actress. She followed this with a series of films that performed poorly at the box office. This changed when she starred as a radio jockey in Tumhari Sulu (2017) and a scientist in Mission Mangal (2019). The latter ranks as her highest-grossing release. Vidya also promotes humanitarian causes and supports the empowerment of women. She is a member of the Indian Central Board of Film Certification and hosts a radio show. She initially drew criticism for her fluctuating weight and dress sense, but was later credited in the media for her unconventionality. Vidya is married to the film producer Siddharth Roy Kapur. Early life and initial career struggles Vidya was born on 1 January 1979 in Bombay (present-day Mumbai), to parents of Tamilian descent. Her father, P. R. Balan, is the executive vice-president of Digicable and her mother, Saraswathy Balan, is a homemaker. According to Vidya, they speak a mix of Tamil and Malayalam at home. Her elder sister, Priya Balan, works in advertising. The actress Priyamani is her second cousin. Vidya grew up in the suburban neighbourhood of Chembur, Mumbai and attended St. Anthony Girls' High School. From a young age, she aspired to a career in film and was inspired by the work of actors Shabana Azmi and Madhuri Dixit. At the age of 16, she starred in the first season of Ekta Kapoor's sitcom Hum Paanch as Radhika, a bespectacled teenager. After the series ended, Vidya refused director Anurag Basu's offer to star in a television soap opera, as she wanted to concentrate on a film career. Her parents were supportive of the decision but encouraged her to complete her education first. She attended St. Xavier's College to pursue a bachelor's degree in sociology and later earned a master's degree from the University of Mumbai. While pursuing her master's degree, Vidya was cast as the female lead in the Malayalam film Chakram, opposite Mohanlal and was subsequently signed on for 12 other Malayalam language films. However, due to production difficulties, Chakram was shelved. The postponement of a film starring Mohanlal was an unheard occurrence in Malayalam cinema and producers blamed Vidya for bringing \\"bad luck\\" to the project; labelled her as a \\"jinx\\"; and replaced her in the films that she had been contracted for. She shifted focus to Tamil cinema. In 2001, she was cast as the female lead in N. Linguswamy's Run (2002). However, after completing the first shooting schedule, she was unceremoniously dropped and replaced by Meera Jasmine. She was signed up under false pretences for a sex comedy, a genre she was uncomfortable with, and decided to leave the project. Thereafter, she signed on for a third Tamil film, Manasellam (2003), but was replaced by Trisha as the director was dissatisfied with her work. Kalari Vikraman, another Malayalam film that she completed work for in 2003, failed to get a theatrical release. After failing to start a film career, Vidya appeared in approximately 60 television commercials and in music videos for Euphoria and Shubha Mudgal; a majority of these were directed by Pradeep Sarkar. Career =Early work (2003‚Äì2008)= Vidya's film debut came with the Bengali film Bhalo Theko (2003), a drama directed by Goutam Halder. He cast her in the central role of Aanandi, a young woman reminiscing about her past, for the combination of innocence and experience that he found in her. Vidya was ecstatic about her involvement in Bengali cinema, later calling it a dream come true and highlighting its contribution to her subsequent progress. She was awarded an Anandalok Purashkar for Best Actress for her performance. On Pradeep Sarkar's recommendation, Vidya auditioned for the lead role in his directorial venture‚Äîthe Hindi film Parineeta (2005). The film's producer Vidhu Vinod Chopra initially preferred an established actress in the part, but agreed to cast Vidya after she underwent six months of extensive tests. Based on Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay's 1914 Bengali novel of the same name, Parineeta tells the love story between Shekhar (played by Saif Ali Khan), the son of the local zamindar, and Lalita (Vidya), the dignified daughter of the family's tenant. Vidya's performance received praise from critics; Derek Elley of Variety found her to be an \\"acting revelation\\", adding that her \\"devoted but dignified Lalita is the picture's heart and soul\\". At the annual Filmfare Awards ceremony, she won Best Female Debut and received a nomination for Best Actress. Vidya at the launch of a book based on her film Lage Raho Munna Bhai in 2006 Continuing her collaboration with Chopra's company, Vidya starred opposite Sanjay Dutt in Rajkumar Hirani's comedy film Lage Raho Munna Bhai (2006). She played a radio jockey and the title character's love interest, for which she met up with radio hosts and watched them at work. While she acknowledged not having a substantial role in the film, she agreed to the project as part of a conscious effort to work in different genres to avoid being typecast in her Parineeta image. With earnings of , Lage Raho Munna Bhai emerged as one of the highest-grossing Hindi films to that point. Vidya began 2007 by accepting the supporting role of a multiple sclerosis patient in Mani Ratnam's drama Guru, starring Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai, citing her desire to work with Ratnam. Raja Sen of Rediff.com bemoaned that she was \\"somewhat wasted in a role that isn't as well-etched\\". Her next two roles, in the ensemble films Salaam-e-Ishq and Eklavya: The Royal Guard, were similarly small, but she defended these choices as having been \\"part of my learning curve\\". Both films performed poorly at the box office, but the latter was selected as India's entry for the 80th Academy Awards. Citing date issues, Vidya refused Pradeep Sarkar and Sudhir Mishra's offers to star in their films Laaga Chunari Mein Daag and Khoya Khoya Chand, respectively; she has said that both filmmakers were upset with her decision. In her next release of 2007, the comedy Heyy Babyy, she starred opposite Akshay Kumar in her first glamorous, westernised role. Her look was poorly received, with Namrata Joshi of Outlook writing, \\"Vidya is irritating, over-the-top, extremely affected and looks ghastly in figure-hugging frocks.\\" She next teamed with Kumar once again in Bhool Bhulaiyaa, a comedy horror film from Priyadarshan, which served as a remake of the Malayalam film Manichitrathazhu (1993). Played by Shobana in the original, Vidya was challenged by the role of a woman suffering from dissociative identity disorder; in preparation, she stayed in isolation for three days and once collapsed on set. Moreover, she was intimidated by the dancing that her role required and began learning kathak days before filming her scenes. Despite disliking the film and Vidya's dancing, Khalid Mohamed found her \\"bankably likeable\\", and Taran Adarsh described her as \\"splendid\\". Both Heyy Babyy and Bhool Bhulaiyaa were among the highest-grossing Hindi films of the year. The latter earned her a second Best Actress nomination at Filmfare. In 2008's Halla Bol, based on the life of activist Safdar Hashmi, Vidya played a supporting role opposite Ajay Devgn. She next took on a glamorous role once again in the romantic comedy Kismat Konnection, co- starring Shahid Kapoor. She explained her choice of this part as a deliberate attempt to move away from her comfort zone, but she found it difficult to dance alongside Kapoor. Elvis D'Silva of Rediff.com found Vidya to be \\"woefully miscast\\" and criticised her look and wardrobe, as did Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express, who dismissed her as \\"determinedly frumpy\\". Both films had poor box office returns. Addressing her failure in portraying glamorous roles, Vidya has said that such parts did not suit her personality and blamed herself for \\"a complete lack of conviction on my part\\". =Established actress (2009‚Äì2012)= Vidya's career prospects improved in 2009 when R. Balki cast her in his comedy-drama Paa. She played a single mother struggling with her son's (played by Amitabh Bachchan) progeria. She was initially skeptical about playing the part, wondering if she could be maternal towards an actor of Bachchan's stature, who is over 30 years her senior. After insisting on a look test with Bachchan, she said that his effective transformation into a young boy had convinced her to accept the part. Comparing her acting style to that of Dimple Kapadia, the critic Sukanya Verma wrote, \\"Balan is poignant yet restrained and projects an impressive figure of grace and integrity\\"; Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India commended her for lending a \\"rare dignity to the image of the Bollywood mom\\". Paa was a commercial success, and won Vidya the Filmfare Award and Screen Award for Best Actress. Vidya has said that the film's reception gave her \\"courage to stick to my conviction\\". Vidya described her next role, in Abhishek Chaubey's black comedy Ishqiya (2010), to be \\"an epitome of grey\\". In a departure from her wholesome on-screen persona, she starred as a seductive, manipulative widow from a village in Uttar Pradesh. The part required her to master the local dialect, which also involved the use of profanity. Anupama Chopra opined, \\"Vidya Balan's smoldering looks scorch the screen even as her eyes hint at tragedy. She proves that she is miles ahead of the cookie cutter Barbie dolls that clutter Bollywood and that sensuality has very little to do with showing skin.\\" Vidya's work won her the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress, a second consecutive Best Actress award at Screen, and a nomination for Best Actress at Filmfare. Vidya at an event for The Dirty Picture (2011), for which she won the National Film Award for Best Actress The year 2011 was key in Vidya's career, as she had starring roles in two commercially successful female-led films. In No One Killed Jessica, a thriller based on the murder of Jessica Lal, and co-starring Rani Mukerji, Vidya played the real-life character of Sabrina, who seeks justice for her sister's murder. Vidya was styled in men's dresses and loose-fitted clothing; several scenes were shot on location using hidden cameras, and she was pleased with the anonymity that her styling provided. Moreover, she spoke positively of her rapport with Mukerji, noting the rarity of two leading ladies within the same Hindi film. Sudhish Kamath of The Hindu took note of Vidya's ability to be \\"in sublime control over her emotions\\" and Savera Someshwar of Rediff.com added that \\"her hesitant body language, her faith, her helplessness, her rage, her sorrow and her gratitude all come across beautifully\\". Vidya earned another Filmfare nomination for Best Actress. In the same year, she made a guest appearance in the Malayalam film Urumi and a retrospective of her films was held in Australia as part of the Bollywood and Beyond festival. The New York Times reported that with her role in The Dirty Picture (2011), a drama based on the controversial Indian actress Silk Smitha, Vidya had \\"redefine[d] the Hindi film heroine\\". She was challenged by the overwhelming sexuality in the role, and spoke of the mental preparation she put into achieving a balance between the character's mix of innocence, vulnerability, and sex appeal. She gained to look the part. Khalid Mohamed observed of Vidya, \\"She's extraordinary: gutsy, consistently in character and unafraid of exposing her darker side. Here's the kind of complex performance which you haven't evidenced in years and years.\\" With worldwide earnings of , The Dirty Picture emerged as Hindi cinema's highest-grossing female-led film to that point. Vidya won another Filmfare and Screen Award, in addition to the National Film Award for Best Actress. She next starred in the thriller Kahaani (2012), directed by Sujoy Ghosh. Set in Kolkata during the Durga Puja festivities, the film starred Vidya as a pregnant woman in search of her missing husband. Made on a shoestring budget, it was shot for over 64 days in the streets of Kolkata by means of guerrilla filmmaking. Vidya drew media attention for wearing a prosthetic belly while promoting the film. Pratim D. Gupta of The Telegraph wrote that Vidya \\"gets into the physicality of a pregnant woman with unfailing mastery\\". Sanjukta Sharma of Mint summarised, \\"Balan‚Äôs existence, and indeed her flourishing, says something about the Hindi film industry finally breaking away from the ‚Äúheroine\\" mould.\\" As with The Dirty Picture, Kahaani too emerged among the biggest earning female-led Hindi films, grossing over worldwide. Vidya won a fourth consecutive Best Actress Award at Screen and a third Best Actress Award at Filmfare. =Setback and resurgence (2013‚Äì2017)= After serving as a jury member at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival, Vidya starred in the comic thriller Ghanchakkar (2013). Playing a boisterous Punjabi woman opposite Emraan Hashmi, she explained that unlike her previous few films, her part in it was secondary to the male star. Sarit Ray of Hindustan Times dismissed her \\"shrill, garish-dressing, magazine- devouring Punjabi housewife\\" character as \\"caricature-ish\\". Vidya then provided the voice of Draupadi for Mahabharat, an animation film based on the Indian epic of the same name. She began 2014 with Shaadi Ke Side Effects, a romantic comedy about a married couple, in which she was pitted opposite Farhan Akhtar. Critics liked their chemistry, but were unimpressed with the film. She was next drawn to the title role of an aspiring detective in the comedy-mystery film Bobby Jasoos, after connecting with the character's struggle to prove herself. It required her to sport 12 elaborate disguises, and she trained with a language coach to adopt a Hyderabadi accent. Rohit Khilnani of India Today was appreciative of Vidya's performance but disliked the film's script and execution. All of these films were commercially unsuccessful, which led Vidya to admit that she felt \\"devastated\\" by their reception. Vidya at the 63rd Filmfare Awards, where she won her fourth Best Actress award for Tumhari Sulu (2017) The series of poorly received films continued with the romantic drama Hamari Adhuri Kahani (2015). The writer Mahesh Bhatt, who based the film on his own mother, was keen to have Vidya play the lead role of a domestic abuse survivor. Shubha Shetty-Saha of Mid Day bemoaned that she had been \\"saddled with a boring, outdated, weepy character\\" and that \\"there was nothing much even she could do\\". The following year, she took on the supporting part of a police officer in Te3n (2016), a thriller inspired by the 2013 South Korean film Montage, co-starring Amitabh Bachchan and Nawazuddin Siddiqui. She was drawn to playing a woman who commands respect and identified with her \\"silent aggression\\". Rajeev Masand criticised the film's predictable denouement, but liked Vidya's ability to act through gestures. She then portrayed the actress Geeta Bali in multiple songs for Ekk Albela, a Marathi-language biopic of Bhagwan Dada. Journalists speculated if Kahaani 2: Durga Rani Singh (2016), a spiritual sequel to Kahaani, would help overcome her career decline. It was not as well-received as the first film, but Vidya received a Best Actress nomination at Filmfare for her portrayal of a child sexual abuse survivor. In a mixed review of the film, Raja Sen of Rediff.com wrote that \\"with tremendous commitment to the part, [Vidya] gives us a stirring performance free of vanity or obviousness\\". In Srijit Mukherji's period drama Begum Jaan (2017), a remake of the filmmaker's own Bengali film Rajkahini (2015), Vidya played the title role of a procurer from the 1940s. She worked with Mukherji to provide a backstory to her character and researched the era by reading The Other Side of Silence; filming in the barren landscape of rural Jharkhand was physically daunting for her. Anna M. M. Vetticad of Firstpost wrote that she \\"issues one-liners in a monotone, but is unable to dig deep and summon up a relatable human being\\". Vidya next played Sulu, a spirited housewife who moonlights as a talk radio host of a relationship counseling show, in the comedy-drama Tumhari Sulu. She identified with her character's lively personality and was pleased to play a rare comic part. She drew on her experience of playing a radio jockey in Lage Raho Munna Bhai and listened to late-night radio shows. Writing for The Times of India, Neil Soans commended Vidya for \\"infusing Sulu with an abundance of infectious optimism without being aggravating\\", and Shubhra Gupta complimented the way she used \\"her distinctive voice and full-bellied laughter to invest Sulu with real warmth\\". NDTV listed her performance as the best by a Hindi film actress that year, and she won her fifth Screen Award and fourth Filmfare Award for Best Actress. It also proved to be Vidya's first commercial success since 2012; she called the film's reception a \\"major confidence booster\\". =Professional expansion (2019‚Äìpresent)= Vidya promoting Mission Mangal in 2019 Vidya expanded into South Indian cinema in 2019, with roles in the two- part Telugu biopic, titled N.T.R: Kathanayakudu and N.T.R: Mahanayakudu (2019), and the Tamil drama Nerkonda Paarvai. In the former two, which form the biographical account of actor-politician N. T. Rama Rao, she played Rao's first wife. Both films failed commercially. In Nerkonda Paarvai, a remake of the courtroom drama Pink (2016), she briefly played the wife of Ajith Kumar's character. Although not keen on remakes, she agreed to the project to bring attention to its theme of sexual consent. Srinivasa Ramanujam of The Hindu thought that the portions involving Vidya were inessential to the story. It emerged as one of the highest-grossing Tamil films of the year. In the same year, Vidya teamed with Akshay Kumar for the third time in Mission Mangal, about the Mars Orbiter Mission, which marked India's first interplanetary expedition. She liked the idea of playing a seemingly ordinary homemaker who balances her family life with her work as a scientist, and she was also pleased to work with four other leading ladies. Joe Leydon of Variety found Vidya to be \\"drop-dead perfect from wire to wire\\" and Nandini Ramnath of Scroll.in found hers to be \\"the only female character who has agency in this space agency saga\\". She received another Best Actress nomination at Filmfare. With global earnings of , Mission Mangal emerged as her highest-grossing release. The short film Natkhat (2020), a drama about a mother teaching her young son about gender equality, marked Vidya's first production venture. It premiered on YouTube as part of the We Are One: A Global Film Festival. She then portrayed the mental calculator Shakuntala Devi in an eponymous biopic, which due to the COVID-19 pandemic could not release theatrically and instead streamed on Prime Video. The director Anu Menon cast Vidya as she believed that Devi's \\"gregarious and flamboyant\\" personality matched that of the actress; in preparation, Vidya listened to taped interviews of Devi's daughter and husband, and watched online videos of Devi. Mike McCahill of The Guardian praised Vidya's \\"all-shotguns-blazing performance\\" and The Hindu Kenneth Rosario took note of her \\"ability to smoothly transition between age and appearances, but even she can‚Äôt salvage a rather mawkish finale to the film\\". Vidya will next star in Amit V. Masurkar's satire Sherni, and has committed to produce and star as Indira Gandhi in a yet-untitled web series based on Sagarika Ghose's biography Indira ‚Äì India's Most Powerful Prime Minister. Personal life and off-screen work Vidya and Siddharth Roy Kapur at their wedding ceremony in December 2012 The mass media has often speculated about a romantic relationship between Vidya and her co- actors, but she has strongly denied these reports. In 2009, Vidya was involved in a controversy when she mentioned a previous relationship in which \\"caustic remarks\\" were made at her due to her weight. She said, \\"If someone who matters to you takes you down, it can break you. That someone whose approval mattered to me started to constantly find faults with me. At that point of time, it was important to walk away from that relationship.\\" Though she refused to name the person, tabloid reports suggested that she was referring to Shahid Kapoor (her co-star in Kismat Konnection). Kapoor, however, denied the allegations. During an interview in May 2012, Vidya announced that she was dating Siddharth Roy Kapur, the CEO of UTV Motion Pictures. On 14 December 2012, the couple were married in a private ceremony in Bandra, Mumbai. Vidya is trained in Carnatic music and briefly studied the dance forms of Bharatnatyam and Kathak. Regarding her religious affiliations, Vidya said, \\"I am a person with a lot of faith and I have conversations [with God] all the time but I am not so religious in the conventional, organised sense\\". She practices vegetarianism and was listed as \\"India's hottest vegetarian\\" in polls conducted by PETA in 2011 and 2012. \\"Amitabh Bachchan, Vidya Balan named PETA's hottest vegetarian celebrities ,\\" The Indian Express, 3 January 2013. Her weight fluctuations over the years have been the subject of substantial media coverage in India. In March 2011, Vidya endorsed World Wildlife Fund's Earth Hour campaign in India. She campaigned for the cause of nutrition in India for Child In Need Institute (CINI), a non-profit organisation based in Kolkata. In September 2012, Vidya visited a village in Mirzapur, Uttar Pradesh, where she participated in a campaign to promote children's education and the empowerment of women. For her attempts to empower women, Vidya was awarded the Prabha Khaitan Puraskar 2012 by the Calcutta Chamber of Commerce; she was the youngest recipient of the award. In 2012, she became the first brand ambassador of the country's sanitation programme, later renamed as the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. Since then, she has been part of a nationwide television and radio campaign aimed to increase construction and use of toilets. In 2013, Vidya served as the grand marshal of the India Day parade held in New York City. In the same year, she launched a technology-based learning platform for underprivileged children in the Thanapur village of Uttar Pradesh. Also that year, Vidya featured as the host of No More Kamzor, a television special on women empowerment. On the occasion of International Women's Day in 2015, Vidya wrote an opinion column in Hindustan Times on the issues faced by women in India. In August 2017, Vidya was made a member of the Indian Central Board of Film Certification, to certify films for theatrical exhibition. The following year, she became the goodwill ambassador of Arpan, an NGO that creates awareness on sexual abuse. In 2019, she collaborated with BIG FM 92.7 to host a radio show named \\"Dhun Badal Ke Toh Dekho\\". Media image and artistry Following the success of Parineeta and Lage Raho Munna Bhai, Vidya's film roles were subject to wide critical analysis. Vir Sanghvi noted that the films Heyy Babyy and Kismat Konnection were \\"strange films [...] in which she tried to pretend to be what she is not ‚Äî a Bollywood bimbette.\\" Vidya described that particular phase in her career as a \\"struggle to be someone else\\". Due to the criticism that her film choices evoked, Vidya decided to choose roles that she \\"believed in\\" rather than choose by convention. Members of the media have subsequently labelled her as \\"bold\\" and \\"daring\\" in her choices. Vidya at the GQ Men of the Year Awards, 2013 Her starring roles in Heyy Babyy and Kismat Konnection also led to considerable attention in the media for her \\"questionable wardrobe\\". Several publications listed her as the \\"worst dressed actress\\" and her costume designers attributed her failure to carry off western clothes due to her weight and body structure. She was later praised in the media for wearing saris at public events; designer Niharika Khan explained, \\"Vidya's beauty lies in her curves. She's comfortable in her voluptuousness, and therefore in a sari.\\" Vidya has since been identified as defying \\"an anglicised idea of sexuality\\" and embody the idea of \\"raw Indian sexuality\\". After portraying strong protagonists in Paa, Ishqiya, No One Killed Jessica, The Dirty Picture and Kahaani, Vidya was credited in the media for pioneering a movement that breaks the stereotypical portrayal of heroines in Bollywood. The major commercial success of the latter two earned her the title of a \\"female hero\\" and Kalpana Nair of Firstpost noted that with these two films Vidya spearheaded a change in the roles that were offered to actresses over 30. Critic Mayank Shekhar predicted, \\"Just a few smart male actors can completely change the face of a commercial, star-driven film industry. Looking at [...] Vidya Balan [...] it appears, that change could well originate from the leading lady instead.\\" India Today featured Vidya in their 2012 listing of the nation's most powerful women and noted that \\"she has toppled the all dominating hero, reducing him to a supporting role in a male dominated film industry\\". Vidya was featured by Forbes India in their annual Celebrity 100 list in 2012 and 2013. She occupied the top slot in Rediff.com's annual listing of the year's best performances for two consecutive years (2010‚Äì11). She also featured in the list for the years 2005, 2006, 2009, 2012, and 2016. In 2012, the magazine Verve featured her as one of India's \\"Young Power Women\\" and wrote, \\"In a reel world peopled by size zero-toned bodies and pretty-as-a- picture heroines, Vidya comes across as completely real and natural ‚Äì a woman who has followed her own instincts and dared to live her destiny by being her own person and not morphing herself to fit into any conventional slot.\\" Two years later, the magazine listed her as a power icon. In 2018, The Economic Times considered Vidya to be one of the most prominent celebrity brand ambassadors in India. In 2014, Vidya was awarded the Padma Shri, the fourth highest civilian award in India, for her contributions to the entertainment industry. The following year, she received an honorary Doctor of Arts degree from Rai University; the university also named a scholarship program for underprivileged girls after her. The chancellor of the university, Harbeen Arora said, \\"Among the league of iconic actors, Vidya is a pioneer in every way. Her films epitomise a distinct Indianness and a powerful womanhood\\". Accolades Among Vidya's film awards are a National Film Award for Best Actress for The Dirty Picture (2011); and six Filmfare Awards: Best Female Debut for Parineeta (2005); Best Actress for Paa (2009), The Dirty Picture (2011), Kahaani (2012), and Tumhari Sulu (2017); and Critics Award for Best Actress for Ishqiya (2010).

It is the capital of the Atsimo-Andrefana region, located 936 km southwest of national capital Antananarivo. The current spelling of the name was adopted in the 1970s, reflecting the orthography of the Malagasy language. Many geographic place names, assigned French spellings during the colonial period, were altered following Malagasy independence in 1960. The city has a population of 156,710 in 2013.Institut National de la Statistique, Antananarivo. As a port town it acts as a major import/export hub for commodities such as sisal, soap, hemp, cotton, rice and peanuts.  History  In the 17th century, French buccaneers landed in the bay of St. Augustine near the Tropic of Capricorn, and founded the city to maintain commercial relations. It was not until the colonial period, after 1897, when the city really grew: with the efforts of Joseph Gallieni to install French administrative services, previously isolated on the island of Nosy Ve, to form the regional capital. Tulear grew along a grid pattern of cross streets, with wide avenues and public monuments.  Population  Toliara has seen a population boom over the last two decades, due to a rural exodus that has brought over 200,000 citizens into urban centers in the region. The Vezo, nomadic fishermen, are the indigenous ethnic group. Today they are being dominated by migrants from the South (Mahafale, Masikoro, Antandroy) which make up more than half of the urban population. To these are added migrants from other urban regions, occupying positions in government and the private sector. = Religion = Toliara's cathedral is the archiepiscopal seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Toliara, one of five in the country, originally the Diocese of Tul√©ar since 1957, renamed with the city in 1989, promoted in 2003 to Metropolitan archbishopric.  Culture and sights  Ifaty beach near Toliara Regional cultural highlights include: * The Ifaty beach near Tulear is famous for its water and sands. * The Museum of Arts and Traditions of the South of Madagascar (in Cedratom) presents the life, crafts and funerary art of the people in the area. * The Regional Museum of the University of Toliara: this museum has a small ethnological collection and a huge egg of Aepyornis. * The Museum of the Sea, founded by Professor Rabesandratana, is hosted by the Oceanographic Institute and covers the local aquatic flora and fauna, including a coelacanth caught in 1995 near Anakao. * The Antsokay Arboretum: Established in 1980 at the initiative of the Swiss amateur botanist Petignat Hermann (1923-2000). This arboretum covers an area of 52 hectares, with more than 920 plant species, lemurs, radiated tortoises, snakes and chameleons. * A locally known shell market, on the waterfront, behind the French Alliance, sells shells and various handicraft products. = Education = The University of Toliara is historically the oldest center for higher education, founded in 1971 after the decentralization of the University of Madagascar center. The university campus is located in Maninday 5 km east of the city, and teaches Humanities and Social Science, Science, Philosophy, and Management (the latter located next to the Cedratom). The University of Toliara's Faculty for Teacher Training (ENS) and Institute of Agriculture and Hydrology (IST) is currently working with the NGO Big Red Earth to explore educational innovations in the areas of agriculture, civic engagement, and sustainable development. The Fisheries and Marine Sciences Institute (IHSM) welcomes students from diverse backgrounds, and offers advanced training in fisheries, aquaculture, and the marine and coastal environment. In 2000 it set up the National Oceanographic Data Centre. A regional centre for distance education (CRTE) of the Centre National de T√©l√©-Enseignement de Madagascar (CNETMAD) is located in Toliara. Toliara has a Technical School and two grammar schools (Lyc√©e Laurent Botokeky and Antaninarenina High School), private and religious schools such as Sacred Heart College, Tsianaloke Mahavatse, and the School of Notre Dame, and a French international school, Coll√®ge Etienne de Flacourt, which serves √©cole primaire (primary school) and coll√®ge (lower secondary school or junior high school).\\"Coll√®ge √âtienne-de-Flacourt.\\" AEFE. Retrieved on May 7, 2015. = Slogans = * Fiherena no maha-Toliara \\"the (river) Fiherena is the soul of Toliara\\" * Toliara tsy miroro \\"Toliara never sleeps\\"  Economy and production  The port played a key role during the \\"boom corn\\" years in the 1980s and 90s. Today, the arrival of migrants contributing to agricultural production (maize, cassava and rice) and livestock (cattle and goats) supplying the city markets with food, has contributed to the development of small informal businesses: particularly among the Mahafale and Masikoro communities. The city specializes in the import and export of various products including sisal, cotton, rice, peanuts and soap. Production of sea salt thrives, from salt marshes and landscaped places in coastal areas. The Bay of Toliara houses one of Madagascar's oil exploration sites. The sea floor is rich in minerals gemstones (about 200 km to the north lies the Ilakaka sapphire deposit has operated since 1999) and ground salt. More recently, Canadian companies begin operation of the ilmenite in the region of Tolanaro. Beyond this mining and production, the industrial sector has declined in recent decades, Tourism is a promising sector, thanks to the climate and natural assets of the hinterland (Ifaty Anakao, St Augustine). Calm shallow seas and shallow support scuba diving, and Toliara remains a main destination for tours to southern Madagascar.  Geography and climate  Toliara is located on a broad coastal plain, surrounded by dunes and mangroves, near the Tropic of Capricorn in the Mozambique Channel. A nearby barrier reef (the Great Reef) is 18 km long and 3 km wide. The beach area is extended by an underwater beach along the continental shelf that slopes gently seaward. To the north lies the Delta Fiherenana. Toliara is nicknamed the \\"City of the Sun\\" because it has a hot climate (24.3 ¬∞C average) and is semi-arid (K√∂ppen BSh), with less than 400 mm annual rainfall. The city is constantly swept by a strong prevailing wind, the Tsio Katimo (\\"South Wind\\").  Infrastructure  The colonial legacy is still visible in the architecture and the urban landscape. Major road works and development were undertaken in 2003 to promote the development of the city. The University Hospital Centre is located near the city center in the district of Tanambao. Another private health facility, St. Luke's Clinic, is located in the district of Sanfily on the road to the airport. = Transport = There is an airport. Air Madagascar operates scheduled flights to here. Education There is a French international school, Coll√®ge √âtienne-de-Flacourt.\\"Coll√®ge √âtienne-de-Flacourt.\\" AEFE.

Purism was led by Am√©d√©e Ozenfant and Charles Edouard Jeanneret (Le Corbusier). Ozenfant and Le Corbusier formulated an aesthetic doctrine born from a criticism of Cubism and called it Purism: where objects are represented as elementary forms devoid of detail. The main concepts were presented in their short essay Apr√®s le Cubisme (After Cubism) published in 1918.Purism, Tate Post World War I Le Corbusier, 1921, Nature morte (Still Life), oil on canvas, 54 x 81 cm, Mus√©e National d'Art Moderne Le Corbusier and Ozenfant were the creators of Purism. Fernand L√©ger was a principle associate. Purism was an attempt to restore regularity in a war-torn France post World War I. Unlike what they saw as 'decorative' fragmentation of objects in Cubism, Purism proposed a style of painting where elements were represented as robust simplified forms with minimal detail, while embracing technology and the machine. Purism culminated in Le Corbusier‚Äôs Pavillon de l'Esprit Nouveau (Pavilion of the New Spirit), constructed for the International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts in 1925. This included the work of Cubists Juan Gris and Jacques Lipchitz. Following this exhibition the relationship between Le Corbusier and Ozenfant declined.

Purist Manifesto The Purist Manifesto lays out the rules Ozenfant and Le Corbusier created to govern the Purist movement. * Purism does not intend to be a scientific art, which it is in no sense. * Cubism has become a decorative art of romantic ornamentism. * There is a hierarchy in the arts: decorative art is at the base, the human figure at the summit. * Painting is as good as the intrinsic qualities of its plastic elements, not their representative or narrative possibilities. * Purism wants to conceive clearly, execute loyally, exactly without deceits; it abandons troubled conceptions, summary or bristling executions. A serious art must banish all techniques not faithful to the real value of the conception. * Art consists in the conception before anything else. * Technique is only a tool, humbly at the service of the conception. * Purism fears the bizarre and the original. It seeks the pure element in order to reconstruct organized paintings that seem to be facts from nature herself. * The method must be sure enough not to hinder the conception. * Purism does not believe that returning to nature signifies the copying of nature. * It admits all deformation is justified by the search for the invariant. * All liberties are accepted in art except those that are unclear.

The Royal Canadian Naval Air Service (RCNAS) was established in 1918 during the First World War in response to the Royal Canadian Navy's recommendation that defensive air patrols be established off Canada's Atlantic coast to protect shipping from German U-boats. Britain warned Canada that an attack by a new class of U-boat that could voyage across the Atlantic was possible. Although U-boats were few in number and not yet capable of posing a major threat in open ocean where ships were difficult to locate, they could be a threat near ports, bays or channels where ships would be certain to be grouped together. Aircraft had proven themselves in similar defensive situations such as convoys, where aircraft forced submarines to remain submerged.Greenhous 1999, p. 19. The United States already had aircraft and bases to defend its own shores, but it was concluded that additional stations in Canada would be needed. The United States supplied aircraft and personnel while Canada recruited and trained its own aircrew and support personnel who were intended to replace the Americans. RCNAS aircrew were trained in the United States and the United Kingdom. The United States Naval Flying Corps flew convoy escort missions and reconnaissance patrols from two air stations which were established in Nova Scotia near convoy assembly ports: * Naval Air Station Halifax, Dartmouth, Nova Scotia * Naval Air Station Sydney, North Sydney, Nova Scotia Escorts were provided to ships leaving and entering port. No U-boats were ever located, however, although 110,000 tons of shipping were sunk in North American waters in the last two months of the war.Greenhous 1999, p. 20. The war ended before the RCNAS aircrew had completed training and the RCNAS was disbanded. The Air Board took control of both stations. The Halifax station would remain in operation, while the North Sydney station was left inactive until the Second World War.Kealy 1967, p. 9. After the disbanding of the RCNAS, the RCN would not operate naval aircraft until World War II when they manned escort carriers and . Several Canadian Naval Air Service Pilots were loaned to the Royal Navy and few from British aircraft carriers. Lieutenant Robert Hampton Gray was awarded the Victoria Cross for his action when he died just five days before the war ended. In 1975 the RCN ended their naval aviation role when the RCAF took over.

Reign  Cyaxares the Great, and Astyages Astyages succeeded his father in 585 BCE, following the Battle of Halys, which ended a five-year war between the Lydians and the Medes. He inherited a large empire, ruled in alliance with his two brothers-in-law, Croesus of Lydia and Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, whose wife, Amytis, Astyages' sister, was the queen for whom Nebuchadnezzar was said to have built the Hanging Gardens of Babylon., The Hanging Gardens of Babylon However, due to recent evidence, the garden was likely built by the Assyrian King Sennacherib. Married to Aryenis, the sister of King Croesus of Lydia, to seal the treaty between the two empires, Astyages ascended to the Median throne upon his father's death later that year. The ancient sources report almost nothing about Astyages‚Äô reign, and a final judgment on his character is not possible, since Herodotus‚Äô negative account (Astyages is represented as a cruel and despotic ruler) and Ctesias‚Äô favorable one, are both biased. According to Cyropaedia of Xenophon, after thirty-two years of relative stability, Astyages lost the support of his nobles during the war against Cyrus, whom Xenophon understands as being Astyages' grandson. This resulted in the founding of the Persian empire by Cyrus. In Herodotus  King Astyages commands Harpagos to take the infant Cyrus and slay him, tapestry by Jan Moy (1535-1550). Astyages's dream (France, 15th century) The account given by the ancient Greek historian Herodotus relates that Astyages had a dream in which his daughter, Mandane, gave birth to a son who would destroy his empire. Fearful of the dream's prophecy, Astyages married her off to Cambyses I of An≈°an, who had a reputation for being a \\"quiet and thoughtful prince\\" and whom Astyages believed to be no threat. When a second dream warned Astyages of the dangers of Mandane's offspring, Astyages sent his general Harpagus to kill the child Cyrus. Herodotus correctly names Cyrus' parents, though he fails to mention that Cambyses was a king.cf. How, W. W., & Wells, J. (1991)A commentary on Herodotus with introduction and appendixes. Oxford [Oxfordshire]: Oxford University Press. i.107 Modern scholarship generally rejects his claim that Cyrus was the grandson of Astyages.cf. How and Wells i.107 Harpagus, unwilling to spill royal blood, gave the infant to a shepherd, Mitridates, whose wife had just given birth to a stillborn child. Cyrus was raised as Mitridates' own son, and Harpagus presented the stillborn child to Astyages as the dead Cyrus. When Cyrus was found alive at age ten, Astyages spared the boy on the advice of his Magi, returning him to his parents in Anshan. Harpagus, however, did not escape punishment, as Astyages is said to have fed him his own son at a banquet. Cyrus succeeded his father in 559, and in 553, on the advice of Harpagus, who was eager for revenge for being given the \\"abominable supper,\\" Cyrus rebelled against Astyages. After three years of fighting, Astyages' troops mutinied during the battle of Pasargadae, and Cyrus conquered the Median's empire. Astyages was spared by Cyrus, and despite being taunted by Harpagus, Herodotus says he was treated well and remained in Cyrus' court until his death. Rather than giving the popular mythology that Cyrus was suckled by a dog (the dog was sacred to Persians. cf. also the legend of Sargon, or the similar legend of Romulus and Remus, suckled by a she-wolf ()) Herodotus explains that the herdsman Mitridates lived with another of Astyages' slaves, a woman named 'Spaco,' which he explains is Median for \\"dog,\\"Herodotus i.110Justin (i.4) which gives both the legend and Herodotus' rationalized version.cf. How and Well, i.110 In the Book of Daniel Chapter 14 of the deutero-canonical version of the biblical Book of Daniel, otherwise known as Bel and the Dragon, opens with the accession of Cyrus after the death of Astyages.: New American Bible, Revised Edition, based on Theodotion's version  Defeat  The Defeat of Astyages (standing left in chains) to Cyrus the Great (center), 18th century tapestry. The contemporary Chronicle of Nabonidus refers to the mutiny on the battlefield as the cause for Astyages' overthrow, but does not mention Harpagus by name. However, since Harpagus was Astyages' general at the battle of Pasargadae and his family were granted high positions in Cyrus' empire after the war, and since Harpagus went on to become Cyrus' most successful general, it is possible he had something to do with the mutiny against Astyages. Cyrus then went on to capture Astyages' capital of Ecbatana. Ancient sources agree that after Astyages was taken by Cyrus he was treated with clemency, though the accounts differ. Herodotus says that Cyrus kept Astyages at his court during the remainder of his life, while according to Ctesias, he was made a governor of a region of Parthia and was later murdered by a political opponent, Oebares. The circumstances of Astyages' death are not known. After Astyages' overthrow, Croesus marched on Cyrus to avenge Astyages. Cyrus, with Harpagus at his side, defeated Croesus and conquered Lydia in or after 547 BCE.

She also starred in the 1932 film Santa, one of the first Mexican sound films, and one of the first commercial Spanish-language sound films.  Early life  Tovar was born in Mat√≠as Romero, Oaxaca, Mexico, the daughter of Egidio Tovar, who was from Tehuac√°n, Puebla, Mexico, and Mary Tovar (n√©e Sullivan), who was Irish- Mexican, from Mat√≠as Romero, Oaxaca, Mexico. Tovar was the oldest of nine children, though many of her siblings did not survive early childhood. Tovar grew up during the time of the Mexican Revolution and her family was very poor. She was raised in a very religious Catholic environment, and went to a school where she was taught by nuns. In 1918, Tovar's family moved north to Mexico City where her father worked for the National Railroad of Mexico in an administrative position.  Career  = Early career = Tovar was discovered by documentary filmmaker Robert Flaherty in Mexico City. Tovar had performed in a dance class and was invited, along with other girls, to do a screen test as part of a competition. Tovar won first place. The prize was a 6-month probation period, followed by a 7-year contract at $150/week, to Fox Studios. The studio had realized they could make money by simultaneously shooting Spanish-language movies of English language studio productions, so had been casting for Spanish stars. She moved to Hollywood in November 1928 with her maternal grandmother, Lucy Sullivan. Tovar, under contract, was required to study intensively to enhance her skills for films. Her weekly schedule included guitar, two hours four days; Spanish dances, one hour three days; dramatics, one-half hour two days; and English, one hour every day. Her accent was considered an asset in talking motion pictures. Her English improved significantly in just seven months from the time she arrived in Hollywood in January 1929, when she could not say \\"good morning\\" in English. To improve her English, she attended talkies; she also learned new words and how to say them by reading voraciously. In 1929, Tovar appeared in the films The Veiled Woman with Bela Lugosi (now thought to be a lost film) and The Cock-Eyed World. In 1930, she was mentioned for leads in two talkies starring Douglas Fairbanks Sr. and Richard Barthelmess. Fairbanks put off the filming of what became The Exile. After his death, the film was made in 1947 by his son, Douglas, Jr., directed by Max Oph√ºls. = Spanish language remakes = Lupita's future husband, producer Paul Kohner, convinced Carl Laemmle to make Spanish language movies that could be shot simultaneously at night with their English originals. When sound films began to dominate the industry, casting director Jimmy Ryan warned her that her poor English would not work and her option would not be picked up. However, he recommended pursuing work in the foreign film department. She went to the office and sat around all day without being seen; she left early because a man kept staring at her and made her feel uncomfortable. When she returned to the office another day she met the head of the department, Kohner, who was the man who kept staring at her before. He offered her a job making $15 a day to dubbing films in Spanish, her first being The King of Jazz.Ankerich, Michael G. The Sound of Silence: Conversations with 16 Film and Stage Personalities. McFarland & Company, Inc., Jefferson, NC: 1998. p. 222. In 1930, Tovar starred opposite Antonio Moreno in La Voluntad del Muerto, the Spanish-language version of The Cat Creeps and was based on the John Willard mystery play, The Cat and the Canary. Both The Cat Creeps and La Voluntad del muerto were remakes of The Cat and the Canary (1927). Casting was done in July 1930 with the film being released later the same year. The Spanish version was directed by George Melford and, like the Spanish-language version of Dr√°cula, was filmed at night using the same sets as those used for filming the English-language version during the day. Tovar shot Dr√°cula, in 1930, when she was 20 years old. The film was produced by her soon-to-be husband, Paul Kohner. = Santa = Lupita Tovar, in film Santa In 1931, Tovar starred in the film Santa, the first to have synchronized sound and image on the same celluloid strip. The film was based on a famous book featuring an innocent girl from the country who has an affair with a soldier and then tragically becomes a prostitute. Santa was such a hit that the Mexican government issued a postage stamp featuring Tovar as Santa. \\"I tell you I could not walk on the streets when Santa came out,\\" Tovar said. \\"People tore my dress for souvenirs. It was something.\\"Ankerich, Michael G. The Sound of Silence: Conversations with 16 Film and Stage Personalities. McFarland & Company, Inc., Jefferson, NC: 1998. p. 226. In 2006, Santa was shown in a celebratory screening by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences called \\"A Salute to Lupita Tovar\\" that featured a conversation between Tovar and film historian Bob Dickson. The event was in honor of Tovar. = Other films = In 1931, Melford directed Tovar in another Universal picture, East of Borneo, which starred Rose Hobart. Tovar also worked on films at Columbia Pictures. Although she herself did not make any silent films, with her earliest films released by Fox Film Corporation in the Fox Movietone sound-on- film system, some may have been released in silent versions for theaters not yet equipped for sound.  Personal life  Lupita Tovar Tovar went by the nickname Lupita since she was a girl. During filming of Santa, which was done in Mexico, producer Paul Kohner had to return to Europe because his father was sick. It was this separation, and another the next year when Kohner was producing a film for Universal Pictures in Europe, that made Tovar realize she loved Kohner. Kohner proposed on the phone‚Äîhe had previously tried to give her a ring‚Äîand Tovar went to Czechoslovakia to meet him. They were married, by a rabbi, in Czechoslovakia on October 30, 1932, at Kohner's parents' home. In 1936, the couple had a daughter, Susan Kohner, a film and television actress, and, in 1939, a son, Paul Julius \\"Pancho\\" Kohner Jr., a director and producer. Their grandsons, Chris and Paul Weitz, are successful film directors. Tovar owned a bassinet that would be used by several well known New Yorkers, including Julie Baumgold, a writer and her husband Edward Kosner, publisher of New York; Elizabeth Sobieski, a novelist and mother of actress Leelee Sobieski, Judy Licht, a TV newswoman, and her husband Jerry Della Femina, an advertising executive. The release of the Spanish-language \\"Dracula\\" on home video in the early 1990s caused a revival of Tovar's films. \\"It's like a dream being invited to all of these festivals and showings of my films. Was that really me up there on the screen? I had almost forgotten I was an actress. It has been absolutely wonderful how people have been so nice. Usually people die and then they get the award, but to be alive and receive this honor is fantastic!\\"Ankerich, Michael G. The Sound of Silence: Conversations with 16 Film and Stage Personalities. McFarland & Company, Inc., Jefferson, NC: 1998. p. 231. Tovar died at the age of 106 on 12 November 2016 in Los Angeles of heart disease, just one day after her daughter Susan Kohner's 80th birthday.

Established as a gold mining town, it is now a quiet town with historic buildings a few kilometres east of West Wyalong, the major district service centre. At the , Wyalong had a population of 851. History The town of Wyalong was established in 1884. Gold was discovered at Wyalong in September 1893 by Joseph Neeld. The \\"Main Camp\\" was erected on the eastern side of the main diggings with impressive government buildings being erected, now classified by the Heritage Trust as being worthy of preservation. The goldfield was named Wyalong by mining warden William Henry John Slee.Barrier Miner, 11 April 1907, p. 2. At its peak in May 1894 there were more than 12,000 miners on the goldfields, digging deep vertical shafts and tunnels to access the quartz reefs which contained the gold. By the end of 1894 the number of miners had reduced to about 4,200. The Amalgamated Miners' Association of Australasia, a precursor of the Construction Forestry Mining and Energy Union, was active in the area, including organising eight-hour day processions (see Photo). The Catholic Sisters of Mercy started their first school at St. Patrick's, Wyalong, in 1896 with 196 students and 6 Sisters. In 1899 Wyalong became a municipality with council chambers being erected, a courthouse, police station, post office and school of arts. Homes and businesses were initially built around the main mining area. In 1895 West Wyalong was developed around the bullock track further west. As mining declined West Wyalong became the main service centre for agriculture in the surrounding district, although for many years there was rivalry between the towns. Both towns wanted the Temora railway line, constructed in 1903, but settled on a compromise of a station midway between the two towns, called Wyalong Central. Gold mining in the immediate area declined from 1910 and ceased by 1921. Old tailings were reworked by cyanide processing during the 1930s. In 2004 Barrick Gold is undertaking gold mining 43 km west at Lake Cowal through the process of in situ cyanide leaching, a variant of the controversial process of Gold cyanidation. Development since the 1970s has expanded Wyalong in the direction of West Wyalong with several motels built at Central Wyalong. A shared bicycle and pedestrian track was constructed in 1994 to link Wyalong with West Wyalong.

The highway travels from its southern terminus at the Florida state line, where SR 3 and SR 300 both reach their southern terminus, concurrent with US 19\\\\. Here, US 19 travels concurrent with State Road 57, south-southeast of Thomasville. SR 3 travels through portions of Thomas, Mitchell, Dougherty, Lee, Sumter, Schley, Taylor, Upson, Pike, Spalding, Henry, Clayton, Fulton, Cobb, Bartow, Gordon, Whitfield, and Catoosa counties to its northern terminus at the Tennessee state line, in East Ridge, where US 41/US 76 continue, concurrent with State Route 8. It travels through Thomasville, Albany, Griffin, Atlanta, Calhoun, and Dalton. Route description =Southern and central Georgia= Southern terminus of SR 3/SR 300 at the FL state line. SR 3 starts at the Florida state line in Thomas County, and is concurrent with US 19 and SR 300 from its inception. SR 3 heads slightly northwest and skirts east past Thomasville, before heading through Pelham to Camilla in Mitchell County. SR 3 turns slightly northeast in Camilla and heads through Baconton, Georgia to Albany in Dougherty County, where its concurrency with SR 300 ends, before turning north and heading to Leesburg in Lee County. In Leesburg, the highway turns slightly northwest once more, travels through Smithville, and enters Sumter County. Turning north again, SR 3 continues through Americus and enters Schley County, curving slightly northwest to Ellaville. Leaving Ellaville in a northerly direction again, SR 3 bisects Schley County and heads into Taylor County and through Butler into Upson County. Just after entering Upson County, the highway turns northwest yet again and travels to Thomaston. Turning back to the north, SR 3 enters Pike County, and travels through Zebulon on its way slightly northeast to Griffin in Spalding County. South of Griffin, SR 3 intersects and begins a concurrency with US 41, in addition to its continued concurrence with US 19\\\\. SR 3 also features a brief freeway section as it travels through the western portion of Griffin. =Metro Atlanta= Heading north, the route enters the western portion of Henry County, and heads through Hampton, where the Atlanta Motor Speedway has direct access from the highway, which regularly sees massive backups on weekends when NASCAR races take place there. Continuing north into Clayton County, SR 3 heads through Jonesboro, and crosses I-75 in Morrow. Heading north through Forest Park, the highway first enters Fulton County, then crosses I-285, and I-75 again, as well as I-85, in quick succession, as it makes its way through the southern Atlanta suburban communities of Hapeville and East Point, forming one side of the perimeter of Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport near Hapeville. Turning north, the highway parallels the Downtown Connector very closely, crosses I-20 in downtown Atlanta, and continues north, beginning and ending concurrencies with US 19, US 78, and US 278, as well as forming part of the western boundary of the campus of Georgia Tech. SR 3 subsequently crosses I-75 for a third and fourth time just northwest of where I-75 and I-85 split, and crosses I-285 once more east of Smyrna, just after having entered Cobb County. =Northern Georgia= Kennesaw Mountain (left) and Little Kennesaw Mountain (right) viewed from SR 3\\\\. Heading northwest through Marietta and Kennesaw, the highway leaves the Atlanta area and enters Bartow County, through Emerson, Cartersville and Adairsville, and on into Gordon County. SR 3 heads through Calhoun, crosses I-75 for a fifth time just south of Resaca, and continues to head north into Whitfield County. Heading through Dalton, the route crosses I-75 yet again, before heading northwest into Catoosa County, where it crosses I-75 for the seventh and final time, before reaching its northern terminus at the Tennessee state line, south of Chattanooga. Here, US 41, joined by US 76, enters Tennessee, concurrent with unsigned state highway SR 8\\\\. =National Highway System= The following portions of SR 3 are part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility, and defense: *From the Florida state line to the I-75 interchange west of Morrow *From about I-20, on the Adair Park‚ÄìPittsburgh neighborhood line in central Atlanta, to the Berkeley Park‚ÄìLoring Heights‚ÄìChanning Valley‚ÄìCollier Hills neighborhood quadripoint in the north- central part of the city *From the I-285 interchange, on the Smyrna‚ÄìVinings line, to the intersection with the eastern terminus of Black Acre Trail and the southern terminus of 3rd Army Road in Acworth *From the bridge over the Etowah River in Cartersville to the bridge over Two Run Creek just north of Cassville *From the SR 53 intersection in the southern part of Calhoun to the central part of the city *From the intersection with the eastern terminus of SR 3 Conn. south-southwest of Dalton to the I-75 interchange in the northwestern part of the city *From about Tunnel Hill to the I-75 interchange south-southeast of Stone Church History =1920s= SR 3 was established at least as early as 1919 starting at the Florida state line southwest of Thomasville; no numbered highway extended south-southeast from that city at the time. SR 3 traveled on essentially the same path as it currently does. The main differences were the southern terminus and the northern terminus. It traveled north from Ringgold to the Tennessee state line. By the end of 1926, US 41 had been designated on the entire length of SR 3 from Griffin to the Tennessee state line. Seven segments of the highway had a \\"completed hard surface\\": a segment in the northern part of Thomasville, from approximately Ochlocknee to north-northeast of Camilla, from the Mitchell‚ÄìDougherty county line to Albany, from south of Americus to Ellaville, from north-northeast of Zebulon to just south of the Spalding‚ÄìHenry county line, from just north of this county line to just south-southeast of the Henry‚ÄìClayton county line, and from just north-northwest of this county line to Marietta. Five segments of the highway had a \\"completed semi hard surface\\": a segment south of the Mitchell‚ÄìDougherty county line, from Leesburg to the Lee‚ÄìSumter county line, from Cartersville to the southeastern part of Calhoun, a segment in the northwestern part of Dalton, and from Ringgold to the Tennessee state line. Ten segments of the highway had a \\"sand clay or top soil\\" surface: a segment on both sides of the Grady‚ÄìThomas county line, a segment north-northwest of Thomasville, from Ellaville to north-northeast of Rupert, a segment just north-northeast of Butler, from the south end of the SR 22 concurrency to south-southeast of Thomaston, from south of the Upson‚ÄìPike county line to Zebulon, a segment in the northwestern part of Marietta, from just south of the Cobb‚ÄìBartow county line to Cartersville, from just south of the Gordon‚ÄìMurray county line to Dalton, and from northwest of Dalton to Ringgold. Six segments of the highway were indicated to be under construction: a segment north of the Lee‚ÄìSumter county line, from south-southeast of Thomaston to north-northwest of that city, a segment north-northeast of Zebulon, from just south of the Spalding‚ÄìHenry county line to just north of that line, from northwest of Marietta to just south of the Cobb‚ÄìBartow county line, and from the southeastern part of Calhoun to just south of the Gordon‚ÄìMurray county line. By the end of 1929, US 19 was designated on the then-current highway from the Florida state line to Atlanta. Also, an unnumbered road was built on the current path of SR 3 south-southeast of Thomasville. =1930s= By the middle of 1930, SR 35 was designated on the unnumbered road south-southeast of Thomasville. Four segments of SR 3 had a completed hard surface: from Thomasville to Albany, from Leesburg to Ellaville, from south-southeast of Thomaston to north-northwest of that city, and from north-northeast of Zebulon to Ringgold. Two segments had a sand clay or top soil surface: from Butler to south-southeast of Thomaston and from north-northwest of that city to north- northeast of Zebulon. Two segments were under construction: from Albany to Leesburg and from Ringgold to the Tennessee state line. By the end of the year, the Albany‚ÄìEllaville segment and the Rinngold‚ÄìTennessee segment had a completed hard surface. A segment south of Zebulon had a sand clay or top soil surface. From the Florida state line to Thomasville and a segment north- northeast of Zebulon were indicated to be under construction. By the end of 1931, three segments had a completed hard surface: from the Florida state line to Thomasville, a segment north of Ellaville, and a segment north-northeast of Zebulon. Two segments were under construction: from north of Ellaville to Butler and a segment south of Zebulon. In January 1932, the entire highway from Florida to north of Ellaville had a completed hard surface. In April that year, the entire highway from south-southeast of Thomaston to the Tennessee state line had a completed hard surface. A segment south-southeast of Thomaston was under construction. Later that year, the segment from north of Ellaville to Butler had a sand clay or top soil surface. From Butler to the south end of the SR 22 concurrency was under construction. Before the year ended, this segment had a completed hard surface. The segment of SR 3 from the south end of SR 22 concurrency to south-southeast of Thomaston, as well as the segment of SR 35 in the southern part of Thomasville, was under construction. By the middle of 1933, the segment from north of Ellaville to Butler had a completed hard surface. The segment from the south end of the SR 22 concurrency to south-southeast of Thomaston had completed grading, but had no surface course. By the end of the year, all of the then-current path of SR 3 had a completed hard surface. In 1934, the segment north of Ringgold was shifted west to travel northwest from that city. A segment north-northwest of Thomasville, as well as the Pelham‚ÄìCamilla segment, was under construction. By the end of the year, a segment of SR 35 south-southeast of Thomasville had a completed hard surface. From the Florida state line to south-southeast of the city, this segment was under construction. By April 1935, the central portion of the segment of SR 35 had completed grading, but was not surfaced. By the end of the year, nearly the segment of SR 35 had a completed hard surface. By the middle of 1936, the entire segment of SR 35 had a completed hard surface. Late in 1937, US 19 south of Thomasville was shifted eastward to travel concurrently with this segment of SR 35, with US 319 designated on its former path southwest of Thomasville. SR 3 was split into two parts between Atlanta and the northwest part of Marietta. US 41/SR 3 traveled northwest on the original path, while SR 3E traveled north-northwest on a more eastern path between the two cities. SR 3E's path from SR 120 in the east part of Marietta to US 41/SR 3 in the northwestern part of the city. The rest of SR 3E was under construction. By the end of the year, SR 3W was established, traveling northwest with US 41 on Marietta Street and Old Marietta Road, while SR 3E traveled north-northwest on Hemphill Street and Northside Drive. All of SR 3E in the northern part of Atlanta was hard surfaced. From the north part of the city to the northwest part, the highway had completed grading, but was not surfaced. Later that year, all of SR 3E from Atlanta to northwest of the Fulton‚ÄìCobb county line had a completed hard surface. =1940s and 1950s= In 1940, nearly the entire segment of SR 3E in Marietta had a completed hard surface. It was under construction from northwest of the Fulton‚ÄìCobb county line to the eastern part of Marietta. By the end of the next year, the entire length of SR 3E had a completed hard surface. By the end of 1946, SR 3W was projected to be designated from the western part of Albany to US 19/SR 3 north of the city. The SR 3W in Atlanta and Marietta was redesignated as part of the SR 3 mainline. By February 1948, SR 3E in Atlanta was moved off of Hemphill Avenue. It, along with US 41 Temp., followed US 19 on Spring Street, then traveled west on 14th Street and resumed the Northside Drive path. The segment of US 41 on SR 3W in this area was redesignated as US 41 Alt. By April 1949, US 41 Alt. was redesignated as US 41 Byp. US 41 Temp./SR 3E's southbound lanes traveled on Hemphill Avenue. The southern part of SR 3W in Albany was hard surfaced, while its northern part had completed grading, but was not surfaced. By the middle of 1950, US 41 Byp. was redesignated as part of the US 41 mainline. US 41 Temp./SR 3E was shifted off of US 19 on Spring Street and 14th Street, and traveled on Hemphill Avenue again. The entire length of SR 3W in Albany was hard surfaced. By the end of 1951, an \\"Expressway\\" (currently part of the I-75 path in the southern part of Atlanta) was built east of US 19/US 41/SR 3. In 1952, US 41 Temp. was redesignated as part of the US 41 mainline, which was shifted off of SR 3W and onto SR 3E. The next year, US 19/US 41/SR 3 was shifted eastward onto the \\"Expressway\\" in the southern part of Atlanta, traveled west on Lakewood Avenue, and then resumed the northern path. The former path became US 19 Bus./US 41 Bus. By June 1954, SR 3W was designated between Atlanta and Marietta. By June 1955, it was redesignated as SR 3. By July 1957, SR 3 in the northern part of Albany was redesignated as SR 3 Conn. due to the SR 3W in the city being redesignated as part of SR 3\\\\. Between Griffin and Lovejoy, SR 3 was shifted off of US 19/US 41 to the east. =1960s= By June 1960, I-75/SR 401 were designated on US 19/US 41/SR 3 in the southern part of Atlanta, ending at Lakewood Avenue. I-75/SR 401 was also designated on the concurrency from Northside Drive to Northside Parkway. SR 3 Conn. in Albany was redesignated as the SR 3 mainline, and its old path was redesignated as SR 3W. By June 1963, SR 333 was designated on US 19 from the Florida state line to Camilla, which truncated SR 35 Thomasville. SR 3's Thomasville‚ÄìMeigs segment was shifted westward onto US 19 Bus. Its former path, on US 19, was redesignated as part of SR 333\\\\. SR 333 was also designated on a sole path from Camilla to Albany. The path of SR 3 in Thomaston was split into SR 3W and SR 3E. It was unclear as to which highway US 19 traveled on. SR 333 was designated on US 19/US 41 from SR 16 in Griffin to an indeterminate location between Jonesboro and Hapeville. SR 333 was designated on US 19/US 41 from Griffin to Lovejoy, and on US 19/US 41/SR 3 from there to south-southwest of Forest Park. By the end of 1965, US 19 between Camilla and Albany was shifted eastward to travel concurrently with SR 333\\\\. It was unclear if the northern terminus of SR 333 was truncated to Lovejoy or not. SR 3S was designated in Marietta from SR 3 to SR 5\\\\. SR 3 Conn. in Marietta was designated from SR 5 to SR 3\\\\. US 19/US 41/SR 3 was shifted onto the former path of US 19 Bus./US 41 Bus. in the Atlanta area. The northern terminus of US 19 Bus. in the southern part of the state was truncated to just east of Ochlocknee. In 1968, a northern extension of SR 333 was projected to be designated from its US 19/US 82/SR 50S interchange in the eastern part of Albany north and northwest to US 19/SR 3W in the northwestern part of the city. =1970s to 2000s= In 1970, all of SR 333 north of Griffin was also decommissioned. In 1973, SR 3W in Albany was redesignated as SR 3, while its former path was redesignated as part of SR 133. In 1974, a freeway was built on the northern extension of SR 333 in Albany, but there was no indication as to what highways were designated on it. Three years later, US 19 through the main part of Albany was shifted northeast to travel concurrently with the SR 333 freeway. By March 1980, US 82 in Albany was also shifted onto the freeway. Between 1974 and March 1980, SR 3S in Marietta was redesignated as SR 3 Spur. Later that year, the northern terminus of SR 333 was truncated to the US 19/US 19 Bus./US 82/US 82 Bus./SR 50/SR 50 Bus./SR 62/SR 333 interchange in Albany, with SR 50 shifted onto the freeway. In 1982, all of SR 333 that remained was redesignated as SR 300. In 1983, the segment of SR 3 from the Florida state line to Thomasville was shifted eastward onto US 19/SR 300\\\\. All of SR 3 from the Meigs area to Albany was shifted eastward onto US 19/SR 300. Between 1978 and 1985, SR 3 Conn. in Marietta was decommissioned. Between March 1980 and 1985, SR 3 Spur in Marietta was decommissioned. In 1985, US 19/US 82/SR 3/SR 300 were designated on the freeway in Albany. It was named Liberty Expressway. Also, SR 3E in the Atlanta area was decommissioned. In 1986, US 19 Bus. in the southern part of the state was decommissioned. The next year, SR 3W in Thomaston was redesignated as SR 3S, and SR 3E there was redesignated as SR 3N. In 1988, SR 50 was truncated to its current eastern terminus, with its entire former path redesignated as part of SR 520\\\\. SR 3N in Thomaston was redesignated as the northbound lanes of SR 3, while SR 3W there was redesignated as the southbound lanes. In 2000, SR 3 between Thomasville and Meigs was shifted eastward onto US 19/SR 300\\\\. Its former path became SR 3 Alt. On April 2, 1980, SR 3 was designated as the 'Andersonville Trail' at the concurrence of SR 3 with US 280 in Americus. On May 4, 1992, SR 3 was designated as the 'Admiral Mack Gaston Parkway' where SR 3 connects SR 52 and SR 71 in Dalton. Major intersections Special routes =Thomasville‚ÄìMeigs alternate route= State Route 3 Alternate (SR 3 Alt.) is an alternate route of SR 3\\\\. It uses an older routing of US 19/SR 3 for between Thomasville and Meigs. At least as early as 1919, SR 3 traveled between Thomasville and Meigs, like it does today. By the end of 1926, a segment north-northwest of Thomasville had a \\"sand clay or top soil\\" surface. By the end of 1929, US 19 was designated on SR 3 in the state. By the middle of 1930, the segment of US 19/SR 3 between Thomasville and Meigs had a \\"completed hard surface\\". By June 1963, SR 333 had been designated on this stretch of US 19, with SR 3 being shifted westward onto US 19 Bus. By the end of 1965, the northern terminus of US 19 Bus. was truncated to just east of Ochlocknee. In 1986, US 19 Bus. was decommissioned. In 2000, the segment of SR 3 between Thomasville and Meigs was shifted eastward, onto US 19/SR 300\\\\. Its former path became SR 3 Alt. =Albany connector route= State Route 3 Connector (SR 3 Conn.) was a connecting route of SR 3 that existed completely in the city limits of Albany. It traversed portions of Dougherty and Lee counties. At least as early as 1919, SR 3 traveled on essentially the same path as it currently does through the Albany metropolitan area. By the end of 1926, the segment from the Mitchell‚ÄìDougherty county line to Albany had a \\"completed hard surface\\". By the end of 1929, US 19 was designated on the highway through Albany. By the end of 1946, SR 3W was projected to be designated from the western part of Albany to US 19/SR 3 north of the city. By April 1949, the southern part of SR 3W was hard surfaced, while its northern part had completed grading, but was not surfaced. By the middle of 1950, the entire length of SR 3W was hard surfaced. By July 1957, SR 3 in the northern part of Albany was redesignated as SR 3 Conn. due to SR 3W being redesignated as part of SR 3. By June 1960, SR 3 Conn. was redesignated as the SR 3 mainline, and its old path was redesignated as SR 3W. =Leesburg bypass= State Route 3 Bypass (SR 3 Byp.) is a western bypass of the town of Leesburg in Lee County, which was completed in 2009. It is concurrent with US 19 Byp. for its entire length. The entire length of SR 3 Byp. is part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility, and defense. =Clayton County connector route= The portion of Tara Boulevard in Clayton County that is not covered by US 19/US 41/SR 3 near Interstate 75 (I-75) is designated as State Route 3 Connector (SR 3 Conn.). The route is little more than a high-capacity set of ramps to and from I-75 and is unsigned. Its entire length is just west of Morrow. =Atlanta connector route= State Route 3 Connector (SR 3 Conn.) is a connector route in the city limits of Atlanta. The entire length travels along the southeastern edge of Spelman College. It starts at an intersection with US 29/SR 14/SR 154, just northeast of an overpass for Interstate 20 (I-20). US 29/SR 3 Conn. travel north-northwest. Just before an intersection with Westview Drive, they curve to the northeast and meet the northern terminus of SR 3 Conn., an intersection with US 19/US 41/SR 3\\\\. =Atlanta spur route= State Route 3 Spur (SR 3 Spur) was a short-lived spur route of SR 3 that existed in the central part of the city limits of Atlanta. Between June 1963 and the beginning of 1966, it was established on the path of U.S. Route 41 (US 41; Northside Drive) from Marietta Street, where SR 3 split off of US 41, to an interchange with Interstate 75 (I-75), where SR 3E began a concurrency with US 41. In 1969, it was redesignated as a southern extension of SR 3E. =Marietta spur route= State Route 3 Spur (SR 3 Spur) was a spur route of SR 3 that existed in Marietta. At least as early as 1919, SR 3 traveled on essentially the same path as it currently does through the city. By the end of 1926, US 41 had been designated on the entire length of SR 3 in this area. This segment of US 41/SR 3 had a \\"completed hard surface\\". By the end of 1965, SR 3S was designated in Marietta from SR 3 to SR 5. Between 1974 and March 1980, SR 3S was redesignated as SR 3 Spur. Between March 1980 and 1985, SR 3 Spur was decommissioned. =Marietta connector route (1965‚Äì1984)= State Route 3 Connector (SR 3 Conn.) was a connecting route of SR 3 in Marietta. it was designated from SR 5 to SR 3. In 1984, it was redesignated as part of SR 5. =Marietta connector route= State Route 3 Connector (SR 3 Conn.) is a connector for SR 3 that exists entirely within the city limits of Marietta. It is known as Roswell Road for its entire length. It begins at an intersection with US 41/SR 3 (Cobb Parkway) in the east-central part of the city. Here, the roadway continues as Roswell Street. At this intersection is the Big Chicken restaurant of KFC. SR 3 Conn. proceeds to the east and has an incomplete interchange with the northbound lanes of Northwest Corridor Express Lanes of Interstate 75 (I-75). The highway then curves to the northeast and reaches its eastern terminus, an interchange with SR 120 (Marietta Parkway/Roswell Road) and the eastern terminus of SR 120 Alt. (Marietta Parkway). The highway was formed in 2007 when SR 120 was rerouted out of downtown Marietta. =Whitfield County connector route= State Route 3 Connector (SR 3 Conn.) is in Whitfield County south of Dalton; it connects Interstate 75 (I-75) to US 41/SR 3 and the Dalton Bypass. All of SR 3 Conn., from I-75 to its eastern terminus, is part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility, and defense.

G. Ballard's 1973 novel of the same name. It follows a film producer (James Spader) as he becomes involved with a group of symphorophiliacs who are sexually aroused by car crashes. The film also stars Deborah Kara Unger, Elias Koteas, Holly Hunter, and Rosanna Arquette. The film generated considerable controversy upon its release and opened to mixed and highly divergent reactions from critics. While some praised the film for its daring premise and originality, others criticized its combination of graphic sexuality and violence. It premiered at the Cannes Film Festival, where it received the Special Jury Prize, a unique award that is distinct from the Jury Prize as it is not given annually, but only at the request of the official jury (for example, the previous year, both a Jury Prize and a Special Jury Prize were awarded). When then jury president Francis Ford Coppola announced the award \\"for originality, for daring and for audacity,\\" he stated that it had been a controversial choice and that certain jury members, \\"did abstain very passionately.\\" The award has not been given since. It received six Genie Awards from the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television, including awards for Cronenberg as director and screenwriter; the film was also nominated in two further categories, including Best Picture. Plot Film producer James Ballard and his wife Catherine are in an open marriage. The couple engage in various trysts but, between them, have unenthusiastic sex. Their arousal is heightened by discussing the intimate details of their extramarital sex. She recounts sex that day with a stranger in a prop plane hangar, where she caresses the plane hull with her bare breast as the film's opening scene. She was, however, left unsatisfied. When Ballard replies he did not achieve satisfaction with his office sexual encounter that day, as he was interrupted, his wife replies \\"maybe the next one\\". While driving home from work late one night, Ballard's car collides head-on with another, killing its male passenger. While trapped in the fused wreckage, the driver, Dr. Helen Remington, wife of the dead passenger, exposes a breast to Ballard when she pulls off the shoulder harness of her seat belt. While recovering, Ballard meets Remington again, as well as a man named Bob Vaughan, who takes a keen interest in the brace holding Ballard's shattered leg together and photographs it. While leaving the hospital, Remington and Ballard begin an affair, one primarily fueled by their shared experience of the car crash (not only do all of their sexual assignations take place in cars, all of Remington's off-screen sexual encounters take place in cars as well). In an attempt to make some sense of why they are so aroused by their car wreck, they go to see one of Vaughan's cult meetings/performance pieces, a re-creation of the car crash that killed James Dean with authentic cars and stunt drivers. When Department of Transport officials break up the event, Ballard flees with Remington and Vaughan. Ballard becomes one of Vaughan's followers who fetishize car crashes, obsessively watching car safety test videos and photographing traffic collisions. Ballard drives Vaughan's Lincoln convertible around the city while Vaughan picks up and has sex with street prostitutes and, later, Ballard's wife. In turn, Ballard has a dalliance with one of the other group members, Gabrielle, a beautiful woman whose legs are clad in restrictive steel braces and who has a vulva-like scar on the back of one of her thighs, which is used as a substitute for a vagina by Ballard. The film's sexual couplings in (or involving) cars are not restricted to heterosexual experiences. While watching videos of car crashes, Remington becomes extremely aroused and gropes the crotches of both Ballard and Gabrielle, suggesting an imminent m√©nage √† trois. Later, Vaughan and Ballard eventually turn towards each other and have sex while, also later, Gabrielle and Remington have sex with each other. Although Vaughan claims at first that he is interested in the \\"reshaping of the human body by modern technology,\\" in fact his project is to live out the philosophy that the car crash is a \\"benevolent psychopathology that beckons towards us\\". The film's climax begins with Vaughan's death in an intentional crash. It ends with another deliberate crash where Ballard rams his wife's car, as she unbuckles her seat belt intentionally. As he caresses her bruised body on the grass median near the crash, she replies that she is unhurt (though she has open bloody cuts). As they make out under the flipped car, Ballard whispers in her ear, \\"Maybe the next one\\", implying their fetish involves death. Cast Production The film was an international co-production between the British company Recorded Picture Company, and Canadian companies Alliance Communications Corporation, The Movie Network, and Telefilm Canada. Release =Controversies= The film was controversial, as was the book, because of its vivid depictions of graphic sexual acts instigated by violence. At the Cannes Film Festival, a screening provoked boos and angry bolts by upset viewers. In a 2020 interview, Cronenberg stated that he believed Francis Ford Coppola, the jury president at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival, was so vehemently opposed to Crash that other jury members in favor of the film bandied together to present Cronenberg with a rare Special Jury Prize. So great was Coppola's distaste for the film that, according to Cronenberg, Coppola refused to personally present the award to the director. The controversial subject matter prompted The Daily Mail and The Evening Standard to orchestrate an aggressive campaign to ban Crash in the United Kingdom. In response to this outcry, the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) inquired with a Queen's Counsel and a psychologist, none of whom found any justification to ban it, and 11 disabled people, who saw no offense with its portrayal of the physically challenged. Seeing no evidence for a ban, Crash was passed by the BBFC uncut with an 18 rating in March 1997. A theatre manager in Oslo, Norway banned the film at her location. She denied it was related to a traffic accident that left her husband paralysed. Media mogul Ted Turner, whose company oversaw U.S. distributor Fine Line Features, refused to release the film in the United States, going so far as to pull it from an October 1996 release date intended to coincide with the Canadian rollout. Cronenberg would later confirm that a Fine Line executive told in the rumors of Turner's distaste for the movie were the reason for its delay. He said Turner was morally offended and concerned about \\"copycat incidents.\\" The film eventually received a U.S. release in Spring 1997. AMC Entertainment Inc., the second-largest U.S. theatre chain at the time, said it was posting security guards outside about 30 screens showing the movie to ensure minors didn't get inside. At AMC's Century City location in Los Angeles two security guards were present, one inside the auditorium and one outside. The film was still banned by Westminster Council, meaning it could not be shown in any cinema in the West End, even though they had earlier given special permission for the film's premiere, and it was easily seen in nearby Camden.Case Study: Crash , Students' British Board of Film Classification page In the United States, the film was released in both NC-17 and R versions. In Australia, a cut version rated R18+ was given a limited release; it was later released uncut on VHS in early 1997, and then on DVD in 2003. The American NC-17 version was advertised with the tagline \\"The most controversial film in years\\". An academic study of the controversy and audience responses to it, written by Martin Barker, Jane Arthurs and Ramaswami Harindranath, was published by Wallflower Press in 2001, entitled The Crash Controversy: Censorship Campaigns and Film Reception. =Critical reception= It has a 60% \\"fresh\\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 52 reviews, with an average score of 6.62/10. The consensus reads: \\"Despite the surprisingly distant, clinical direction, Crash's explicit premise and sex is classic Cronenberg territory.\\" On Metacritic, the film's score is listed as 47 out of 100, as determined by 22 critics, signifying \\"mixed or average reviews\\". In his contemporary review, Roger Ebert gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, writing: > \\"Crash\\" is about characters entranced by a sexual fetish that, in fact, no > one has. Cronenberg has made a movie that is pornographic in form, but not > in result... [Crash is] like a porno movie made by a computer: It downloads > gigabytes of information about sex, it discovers our love affair with cars, > and it combines them in a mistaken algorithm. The result is challenging, > courageous and original‚Äîa dissection of the mechanics of pornography. I > admired it, although I cannot say I \\"liked\\" it. In 2000, a poll done by The Village Voice of film critics listed Crash as the 35th Best Film of the 1990s. A similar poll done by Cahiers du cin√©ma placed it 8th.Cahiers du Cinema: Top Ten Lists 1951‚Äì2009 . Alumnus.caltech.edu. Retrieved on December 22, 2010. In 2005 the staff of Total Film listed it at #21 on their list of the all-time greatest films. Slant Magazine selected it as one of their \\"100 Essential Films\\".100 Essential Films  Film . Slant Magazine. Retrieved on December 22, 2010. On At the Movies with Roger Ebert, director Martin Scorsese ranked Crash as the eighth best film of the decade. BBC film critic Mark Kermode has described Crash as \\"pretty much perfect\\" and praised Howard Shore's score, while admitting that it's a \\"hard film to like\\" and describing the cast's performances as \\"glacial\\". In 2002 Parveen Adams, an academic who specializes in art/film/performance and psychoanalysis, argues that the flat texture of the movie, achieved through various cinematic devices, prevent the viewer from identifying with the characters in the way one might with a more mainstream movie. Instead of vicariously enjoying the sex and injury, the viewer finds himself a disimpassioned voyeur. Adams additionally notes that the scars borne by the characters are old and bloodless‚Äîin other words, the wounds lack vitality. The wound is \\"not traumatizing\\" but, rather, \\"a condition of our psychical and social life\\".Reviews: July 2002. Depauw.edu. Retrieved on December 22, 2010. In a 1996 interview with the Vancouver Sun, Cronenberg said Italian film director Bernardo Bertolucci told him \\"the film was a religious masterpiece.\\" Of the adaptation, author J. G.

Cannes jury president Francis Ford Coppola noted that \\"certain (jury) members did abstain very passionately\\" from endorsing Cronenberg's film, but added that it was important to give Crash an award, \\"even though in mining some truth of the human condition it offended (certain viewers).\\" However, other accounts have suggested it was Coppola himself who didn't like the film, with producer Jeremy Thomas later saying, \\"It touched a nerve with him.\\" In a 2020 interview for the film's 4K restoration, Cronenberg said Coppola was the main dissent on the support for the film on the Cannes jury, adding that \\"he wouldn't hand me the award\\" and got someone else to do it. Crash was also nominated for the prestigious Grand Prix of the Belgian Syndicate of Cinema Critics. In 1996, the film won six Genie Awards from the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television, including awards for Cronenberg as director and screenwriter and John Douglas Smith for \\"Best Achievement in Sound Editing\\".

The school was opened in 1999 and resides on the Laboratory campus in Cold Spring Harbor, New York on Long Island. The school offers a graduate degree (PhD) in molecular biology in an accelerated program that strives for completion within four years. The diverse student body includes about 50 percent international students. History The school was formerly named after James Watson, co- discoverer of the structure of DNA and then president of the laboratory, shortly after its founding. On July 1, 2020, the Board of Trustees voted to return the name of the school to the \\"Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory School of Biological Sciences\\" because of Watson's views on race.

Students are typically off between eight and nine weeks, but not staff, depending on the country and district. In the United States, summer break is approximately two and a half months, with students typically finishing the school year between late-May and late-June and starting the new year between early-August and early-September. In Azerbaijan, Spain, Republic of Ireland, Italy, Greece, Georgia, Lithuania, Latvia, Lebanon, Romania and Russia, the summer break is normally three months, compared to three to six weeks (sometimes 2 months) in Australia, Brazil, the United Kingdom, Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Germany.  Criticisms and support  The research around the impact of summer vacation is mixed. ‚ÄúSummer learning loss‚Äù (or ‚Äúsummer slide‚Äù) is the perceived loss of learning students experience due to interrupted education, but the exact consequences of extended breaks is unclear. Advocates of breaks tend to focus on the need to give children time away from the childhood stresses sometimes associated with school including peer pressure, cliques, bullying, and the pressure of heavy loads of homework.  By country  = Argentina = In Argentina, the school year ends in early- or mid-December and starts late February or early March. Also the majority of students get two weeks of holidays during winter, which varies depending on the region of the country from late July or mid-July to early August. * Primary education: From mid-December to late February (2 months) * Secondary education: From early December to early March (3 months) * University education: From last day of December (31 December) to early April 1 = Australia = In Australia, summer officially lasts from 1 December to 28 February, and therefore includes traditional holidays such as Hanukkah, Christmas and New Year. The dates of Australian school holidays are determined by each state's education department. The Christmas summer holiday are the longest in duration. Typically summer holiday in Australia last approximately six weeks, usually from late December (depending on school level) to late January. This is significantly shorter than North American summer holiday, but Australian schools also break for 2 weeks in April and in June and September, giving students and teachers a total of twelve weeks of annual holidays. In many public schools, years 10, 11 and 12 will finish before December 15, allowing time to complete exam marking and results. Year 10 commonly finishes at the end of November, Year 11 at the end of October, and year 12 (Senior Year) also at mid or the end of October after 3 weeks of end-of-year exams. This can bring the normal 12 weeks of vacation to 20 weeks of vacation. The intervening periods of school operation without holidays are called \\"school terms\\", each term lasting approximately ten weeks. All Australian states have relatively similar holiday periods between each term, but there is the ability for this to change, as it did in the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games, when the first term in Victorian schools was shortened to six weeks and the other subsequently extended to 12 weeks due to severe disruptions to the public and private bus networks used by school students. Most private schools in Australia have up to four weeks of additional holidays, due to their longer teaching hours during term. = Austria = In Austria, summer vacation dates vary by region, however the break lasts nine weeks throughout the whole country. School usually ends in early July and starts in early September. = Bangladesh = In Bangladesh, summer vacation begins in mid-May and ends in mid June (4 weeks). Also, in many schools, the holiday during the month of Ramadan (Around mid-May to around mid-April) is passed off as a summer vacation. The summer there is associated with the availability of fruits such as mangoes (‡¶Ü‡¶Æ / aam) and jackfruits (‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶†‡¶æ‡¶≤ / kaathaal). So, the summer vacation is sometimes known in Bangladesh as \\"‡¶Ü‡¶Æ-‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶†‡¶æ‡¶≤‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶õ‡ßÅ‡¶ü‡¶ø\\", (pronounced as aam-kaathaaler chhuti), which roughly translates to \\"mango-jackfruit's holiday\\". Also, the summer vacation is sometimes not in line with the actual weather patterns during summer, resulting in students having to reach school in the heat. The summer vacations are not given much importance in places except schools. = Barbados = In Barbados, summer holiday dates have varied throughout the years due to the beginning of the hurricane season on June 1. Because of this, major storms affecting the island can cause schools to remain closed for days resulting in a pushback of vacation dates, for example with Hurricane Tomas in 2010. Currently, summer holiday begins in late June or early July and ends in the second week of September. = Belgium = In Belgium, summer vacation lasts in general from July 1 until September 1 (2 months). = Bolivia = In Bolivia, summer vacation runs from early December to early February (2 months). = Bosnia and Herzegovina = In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the start of summer break varies by school, but usually starts at the beginning or mid-June.

The education system in Brazil is federalised, with Federal, State and Municipal schools, all of which can establish their own calendars, alongside that, every federal entity may maintain schools on any of the educational levels, meaning that even in the same town a Municipal-maintained High School, a State-maintained High School, and a privately-owned High School have differing calendars, resulting in summer holidays not being simultaneous throughout the country or even town. The Federal Education Law (Lei de Diretrizes e Bases da Educa√ß√£o Nacional) determines that both Primary and Secondary Education shall consist of a minimum of 800 hours a year, distributed between a minimum of 200 school days, allowing schools to plan for school years that extend beyond the mandatory minimum. In terms of dates, summer holidays might last between 45 and 60 days; from late November ‚Äî early December, to late January ‚Äî early February. In addition, for the majority of Brazilian students there are two to four weeks off for winter in July; the winter holidays were held in August for 2016 only due to the 2016 Summer Olympics. = Bulgaria = In Bulgaria, the time of the break differs according to the grade of the students. The following periods are applied: 1st-3rd grade: May 31 ‚Äì September 15 4th-6th grade: June 15 ‚Äì September 15 7th-11th grade: June 30 ‚Äì September 15 12th grade: School year ends in mid- May. Note that 8th grade classes that focus on intensive language learning's summer vacation also starts on the 30th of June, rather than the 15th. = Canada = In Canada, the first day of summer vacation for public schools is the last Saturday in June. However, in some provinces students get a Professional Activity day on the final Friday of that school week, and their last day would be on the Thursday. Depending on the province, students can get 2‚Äì3 months of summer vacation. This may vary in Quebec (earlier due to provincial June 24 holiday). The last day of summer vacation is Labour Day.

However, the starting and ending times of international schools are variable. For example, most ESF-based schools start in late June and finish mid-August (7 weeks). = Iceland = In Iceland, the duration of the summer vacation can vary from one school to another. Typically students start their summer vacation during the first week of June and return to school in the fourth week of August. = India = India covers a wide spectrum of climates, resulting in a large variation in the start times and duration of summer vacation in different regions of the country. In northern India, summer vacation typically begins in mid-May and ends by early July. The exceptions are the Himalayan Jammu & Kashmir, Uttarakhand, and Himachal Pradesh, where the summer break is short, and the winter break is much longer. For example, in Jammu & Kashmir, summer vacation is only for ten days, with a long winter break from mid-December to the end of February instead. In central India, summer vacation begins in mid-April, and schools re-open in mid-June. In the south, schools finish in the last week of March and resume in early June.

Some tertiary institutions observe their summer breaks in the normal summer period when elementary and high schools observe theirs, while others do not. Some courses of study also do not observe any significant holidays, such programmes include engineering, nursing, medicine and a few others. This is usually as a result of students doing their laboratory work, workshop practice, practicals, internship etc. (as the case may be), while the other students in other programmes are on holiday. Tertiary schools observe two semesters; while some schools observe a break after the first semester, many others have their breaks combined to just the summer holidays.

The summer half-term break is determined by the break in public exams at the end of May. Some universities grant an extended \\"exam leave\\" to students which typically commences in early-April, so as to give students a good number of weeks to prepare for the summer exam season which usually starts in mid-to-late May and finishes in early or mid-June. Final year students at independent schools typically finish their time at school when their last exam in the summer exam season finishes, and as an encore; a special event is usually arranged for late-June by the school for leavers and staff as a way of providing an opportunity for final farewells to be bid. The universities they go on to typically schedule their first term to commence in early-October, giving school leavers an extended summer break between their time of leaving school and starting university. = United States = The dates vary depending on the location of the school district but generally follow the same schedules; most schools in the Northeastern United States end in June and start the Wednesday after Labor Day (the first Monday in September, with teachers reporting back on Tuesday), while the majority of schools in the Southern United States have schools end in May and start again in August. While the origins of the summer holiday break are often believed to be rooted in agriculture and the idea children were needed to assist with planting and harvesting crops, this is inaccurate. Most crops were planted in the spring and harvested in the fall. The modern school calendar has its roots in 19th-century school reform movements seeking standardization between urban and rural areas. Up until the mid-1800s, most schools were open for a winter and summer term. As individual schools merged into school districts and bureaucracies emerged to manage the newly formed school districts, school leaders and politicians identified a need to standardize calendars across regions. This standardization was related to the emerging tax structures, laws around compulsory education, as well as a general sentiment that school should be an essential component of American childhood. As the calendar was standardized across regions, school leaders took cues from a variety of factors, including attendance rates and the difficulty cooling school buildings. Many upper-class families left the city for cooler climates in the hot Northeast summer months, and as such, schools cancelled their summer sessions due to low daily attendance. As train travel became more affordable, middle-class families followed similar patterns, keeping their children home during the hottest months of the year or going away for a summer vacation. In addition to the heat and low attendance, many school leaders advocated for breaks so that students and teachers could rest their brains. Many 19th- and early 20th-century Americans educators believed that too much learning was bad for one's health and could result in injury, particularly for younger children, whose minds were still developing. The extended summer break was seen as a way for children and their teachers to rest and recover. In many places, teachers would use the summer months for their own learning and professional development, including participating in seminars and courses like those held at Chautauqua. = Uruguay = In Uruguay, summer holidays usually begin in early December, and finish in early March (3 months). = Venezuela = In Venezuela, summer holidays begin in late June or early July and end in late September or early October. = Vietnam = In Vietnam, summer holidays usually begin in late May or early June and last for two months.

He has also worked in advertising, contributing his photographs to various Japanese companies' commercial ads, such as those by Fujitsu and Nippon Oil.  Biography  Excerpts from Aida's books Romansu, Romansu Part 2, and Hi ga gensou jipangu ~ Ten no maki, showing nude adult women, were featured in the November 1983 issue of the French photography magazine Photo Reporter, including on the cover. The June 1986 issue of the French edition of Photo magazine, which had a special focus on Japan, contained a cover photo by Aida showing three young nude Japanese women. His photos were also published during the 1980s in the Italian, German, and Spanish editions of Photo and in France's Newlook magazine, among others. During the 1990s, Aida made erotic photographs of teenage models both over and under 18 years of age. Among his best known models from this period are Kaoru from Japan and many of his subjects from Sweden. These photographs are generally regarded as tasteful and high in quality. Many of them show partial or full nudity. Aida photographed Naomi Morinaga, an actress in 1984's Uchuu Keiji Shaider, for a 1994 book titled W Face. In the 2000s (decade), he photographed milder erotic pictures of very young models ‚Äî something quite acceptable in Japan, but not viewed favorably in the west. These later works are not nude photographs, but images of models in swim wear, casual clothing, and school uniforms. The models range in age from 10 to 17. There is a comfortable attitude toward lolita among Japanese men, making these photos high-selling items in both regular and e-book formats. Aida has also released several videos and DVDs of both nude and non-nude subjects (many are the same models who posed for his still photography). He is known for his work with Japanese idol Mao Kobayashi. She has appeared in several photo books and DVDs, has a website, and has made several television appearances. Aida has photographed Mao in kimono, school uniform, swim wear, and other costumes. Other popular models under 15 Aida has photographed include Saaya Irie (12), Asami Doi (13), Sari Kiri (13), Azusa Hibino (14), and Yuka Yamaguchi (14). Selected Books by Garo Aida *Sh≈çjo.

It takes the form of an arc of light, usually seen before a storm. Its cause is unknown, but speculation includes rotting vegetation, undersea releases of natural gas, and St. Elmo's fire.\\"The Legend of the Phantom Ship\\". Source: City of Bathurst. The phenomenon has been the source of many a tall tale, and has been said to appear as a flaming three-mast galley much like the style of ship featured on New Brunswick's provincial flag. Versions of the story = Portuguese captain selling Mi'kmaq = In this version of the fireship tale, a Portuguese captain arrived on the shores of Heron Island in Baie des Chaleurs in 1501. Upon his second trip to the region to capture more Mi'kmaq natives for the slave trade, he was tortured and killed by the locals who had bitter memories of his first visit. A year later his brother came looking for him and was also attacked by the locals; their ship caught fire and they jumped into the waters and swore to haunt the bay for 1,000 years. In several eye witness reports from early settlers on Heron Island, most notably the Pettigrew family, the ship is most often seen on the north side of the island, during the full moon. In a horrifying incident, Mrs. Pettigrew reported to be on her veranda at dusk one summers evening in 1878, when a ghostly figure of a sailor appeared at the corner of the farm house, and reportedly asked her to help him, see to his burns. When she turned away from the figure to run inside, it apparently brushed by her and to her horror she realized he was legless. Victims, both Mi'kmaq and Portuguese of the sinking, reportedly washed up on the shores of the island, and were buried in shallow graves at French Woods, a low-lying area at the west tip of the island.\\"Fireship of Baie des Chaleurs\\" Source: Universit√© de Moncton, Centre d'√©tudes acadiennes, Fonds Catherine-Jolicoeur, 63.011. = Pirate killing near Port Daniel = This Restigouche lady's version tells of a group of pirates who killed a woman.

In September 2008, Vestar Capital Partners acquired the North American (United States, Canada and Puerto Rico) laundry business of Unilever, which included the Snuggle, Wisk, All, Surf and Sunlight brands. The former Unilever businesses were combined with Huish Detergents, Inc. to form The Sun Products Corporation. On June 24, 2016, Henkel Consumer Goods Inc., a subsidiary of Henkel AG & Co. KGaA (‚ÄúHenkel‚Äù) signed a definitive agreement to acquire The Sun Products Corporation. The transaction was valued at $3.5 billion.  Mascot  Since 1983, the Snuggle Bear has been the mascot for the Snuggle line of fabric softener. The puppet was created by Kermit Love. The voice was originally provided by Corinne Orr. In a 2006 radio interview, Micky Dolenz stated that he was the voice of Snuggle at that time. As of late 2009, the bear was voiced by Elena M.

Around 300 BC, Gongsun Long wrote this dialectic analysis of the question \\"Can one legitimately assert 'white horse is not horse'?\\", in a work now named for him, Gongsun Longzi, in a segment called the \\"White Horse Dialog\\" (). The original text Is it a horse? The White Horse Dialog constitutes chapter 2 of the eponymous Gongsun Longzi. The purported author, also known as \\"Master Gongsun Long,\\" was counted among the School of Names ( the Logicians or the Dialecticians) in the Hundred Schools of Thought. Most of Gongsun's writings have been lost; the received Gongsun Longzi text only contains six of the supposedly 14 original chapters. Parts of the text are dislocated; thus, some commentators and translators rearrange them for clarity. The dialog is between two unnamed speakers: This dialog continues with deliberations over colored and colorless horses and whether white and horse can be separated from white horse. Other Gongsun Longzi chapters discuss \\"white horse\\"-related concepts of: jian 'hard; hardness', and bai 'white; whiteness', ming 'name; term', shi 'solid; true, actual; fact, reality', the abstract zhi 'finger; pointing; designation; universal' (like \\"whiteness\\"), and the concrete wu 'thing; object; particular' (like \\"a white horse\\"). Interpretations and proposed solutions The 'paradox' can be resolved by recognizing that the lack of articles in the Chinese language contributes to semantic ambiguity. Without grammatical articles, it is unclear whether each 'horse' () in the statement \\"A white horse is not a horse\\" () refers to 'a horse', 'the (desired) horse', 'all horses', or 'horsekind'. This can be seen clearly by expressing the paradox in English using articles: suppose that one desires yellow or black horses, then a white horse would not be the (desired) horse. The Advocate's sophistry in the White Horse Dialog is due to his confounding 'a horse' with 'the (desired) horse'. According to A. C. GrahamGraham, Angus Charles (1990); ., this \\"A white horse is not a horse\\" paradox plays upon the ambiguity of whether the 'is' in the statement means: # \\"Is a member of the class \\"; or # \\"Is identical to \\". In other words, the expression \\"white horse is not horse\\" is ambiguous between \\"white horse is not synonymous with horse\\" (true because white horse is more specific than horse), versus \\"a white horse is not a member of the set of horses\\" (obviously false). The Advocate in the dialog is asserting a lack of identity between horses and white horses, while the Objector is interpreting the Advocate's statement as a claim that the category of horses does not include white ones. Beyond the inherent semantic ambiguities of \\"A white horse is not a horse,\\" the first line of the White Horse Dialog obscurely asks ('Can it be that ...?'). This dialog could be an attempted proof that a white horse is not a horse, or a question if such a statement is possible, or both. Bryan W. Van Norden suggests that \\"the Advocate is only arguing that 'a white horse is not a horse' be true, given a certain interpretation. He might acknowledge that, in another interpretation, 'a white horse a horse. An alternative interpretation is offered in Fung Yu-lan's History of Chinese Philosophy:Fung Yu-lan (1934); A History of Chinese Philosophy; tr. Derk Bodde (1952); Princeton University Press; p. 206. However, there are recent histories of Chinese philosophy do not subscribe to Fung Yu-lan's interpretation. Other contemporary philosophers and sinologists who have analyzed the dialog include Graham,Graham, Angus Charles. (1989). Disputers of the Tao: Philosophical Argument in Ancient China, pp. 75‚Äì95; Graham, (1990). Hansen,Hansen, Chad (1976); \\"Mass Nouns and 'A White Horse Is Not a Horse'\\", Philosophy East and West, 26.2:189‚Äì209. Hansen, Chad (1983); Language and Logic in Ancient China, p. 140.

Thompson,Thompson, Kirill Ole (1995); \\"When a 'White Horse' Is Not a 'Horse'\\"; Philosophy East and West, 45.4:481‚Äì499. and Van Norden. Historic influence In the Chinese philosophical tradition, the White Horse Dialog's significance is evident from the number of Chinese classic texts directly or indirectly discussing it. The Liezi, which lists and criticizes the paradoxes of Gongsun Long as \\"perversions of reason and sense\\", explains \\"'A white horse is not a horse' because the name diverges from the shape.\\"Graham, Two Zhuangzi chapters (17 and 33) mock Gongsun Long, and another (2) combines his zhi 'attribute' and ma 'horse' notions in the same context:Zhuangzi. The Mengzi (6A4) notes that bai 'white' has different connotations whether one is using it to refer to a graying person (who is worthy of respect because of his or her age) or a white horse (which should be treated like any other animal):Legge, James (1895); Other early \\"a white horse is not a horse\\" references are found in the Hanfeizi (32), Mozi (11B), and Zhanguoce (4).

CCSU March, 2006. A banner drop is the act of putting a banner in place as a protest tactic. The banner usually targets a specific corporation, law, political campaign, etc. The banner may itself be dropped on an activists' target, or in conjunction with the beginning of a campaign. For an example of all three, the November 20, 1999 banner drop at an Old Navy store in downtown Seattle publicized the company's use of sweatshop labor and was one of many protest activities carried out during the beginning of the Seattle WTO protests. Performing a banner drop may constitute criminal vandalism and criminal trespassing depending on where the banner is placed and on the legal jurisdiction in which the activity occurred. There are several ways in which banners are constructed and placed. Most often, a banner is decorated with an activist slogan or picture using paint, dye or, in some cases, screen printing.

When a speaker is verbally addressing an audience it is often necessary to use supplementary equipment and media to clarify the point. If the audience is large or the speaker is soft-spoken, a public address system may be employed. At a basic level, visual content can be provided by drawing directly onto a blackboard or whiteboard during the presentation. At a more advanced level, flip charts, slide projectors, and overhead projectors are more suitable for displaying prepared content. The use of prepared material often results in a neater, more accessible, and better conveyed presentation. Laser pointers or even a simple stick are often used to highlight a particular point of interest within a slide or image. Many manufacturers produce devices that provide remote control over electrical presentation equipment, thus allowing the speaker to move around the stage freely and to activate systems when they are required. Occasionally still images do not provide enough information to convey the message clearly. For example, the presenter may attempt to describe a complex mechanical movement, in which case animation or video may provide the clearest method of delivery.

It uses lasers to form an electrically conductive laser-induced plasma channel (LIPC). A fraction of a second later, a powerful electric current is sent down this plasma channel and delivered to the target, thus functioning overall as a large-scale, high energy, long-distance version of the Taser electroshock gun. Alternating current is sent through a series of step-up transformers, increasing the voltage and decreasing the current. The final voltage may be between 108 and 109 volts. This current is fed into the plasma channel created by the laser beam. Laser-induced plasma channel A laser-induced plasma channel (LIPC) is formed by the following process: * A laser emits a laser beam into the air. * The laser beam rapidly heats and ionizes surrounding gases to form plasma. * The plasma forms an electrically conductive plasma channel. Because a laser-induced plasma channel relies on ionization, gas must exist between the electrolaser weapon and its target. If a laser-beam is intense enough, its electromagnetic field is strong enough to rip electrons off of air molecules, or whatever gas happens to be in between, creating plasma.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-18630622 Similar to lightning, the rapid heating also creates a sonic boom. Uses Methods of use: *To kill or incapacitate a living target through electric shock. *To seriously damage, disable, or destroy any electric or electronic devices in the target. *As electrolasers and natural lightning both use plasma channels to conduct electric current, an electrolaser can set up a light-induced plasma channel for uses such as: ** To study lightning ** During a thunderstorm, to make lightning discharge at a safe time and place, as with a lightning conductor. ** Directing atmospheric lightning to a terrestrial collection station for the purpose of electrical power generation. ** As a weapon, to make a thunderhead deliver a precise lightning strike onto a target from an aircraft; in this case, the aircraft and laser can be compared to a triggered spark gap, in that the relatively minor amount of initial input from the laser allows a large amount of energy to flow between the cloud and the ground. Because of the plasma channel, an electrolaser may cause an accident if there is a thunderstorm (or other electricity sources such as overhead powerlines) about. (See Taser for more information - principles of operation, controversies, etc.) An electrolaser is not presently practical for wireless energy transfer due to danger and low efficiency. Examples of electrolasers =Applied Energetics/Ionatron= Publicly traded company Applied Energetics (formerly Ionatron) develops directed-energy weapons for the United States military. The company has produced a device called the Joint IED Neutralizer (JIN) which was deemed unfit for field use in 2006. The JIN is intended for safely detonating improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Future designs include weapons mounted on land, air and sea vehicles and as a hand- held infantry version. Applied Energetics said that the weapons will be able to be used as a non-lethal alternative to current weaponry, but will be able to deliver a high enough voltage jolt to kill. Applied Energetics say that they are working on an electrolaser system, called LGE (Laser Guided Energy). They are also studying a laser-induced plasma channel (LIPC) as a way to stop people from going through a corridor or passageway. =Phoenix= There was an unconfirmed report that in 1985 the U.S. Navy tested an electrolaser. Its targets were missiles and aircraft. This device was known as the Phoenix project within the Strategic Defense Initiative research program. It was first proved by experiment at long range in 1985, but this report may have referred to an early test of MIRACL, which is or was a high-powered chemical laser. =HSV Technologies= HSV Technologies, Inc. (Stood for the last names of the original founders, Herr, Schlesinger and Vernon; this is NOT the same company as Holden Special Vehicles), formerly of San Diego, California, USA, then Port Orchard, WA, designed a non-lethal device which was profiled in the 2002 TIME magazine article \\"Beyond the Rubber Bullet\\". It is an electrolaser using ultraviolet laser beams of 193 nm, and promises to immobilize living targets at a distance without contact. There is plan for an engine-disabling variation for use against the electronic ignitions of cars using a 248 nm laser. The lead inventor, Eric Herr, died in 2008 and the company appears to have been dissolved, as their website now hosts an unrelated business (as of 9/2015) =Picatinny Arsenal= Scientists and engineers from Picatinny Arsenal have demonstrated that an electric discharge can go through a laser beam.

Partners In Health (PIH) is a Boston-based nonprofit health care organization founded in 1987 by Paul Farmer, Ophelia Dahl, Thomas J. White, Todd McCormack, and Jim Yong Kim. The organization's goals are \\"to bring the benefits of modern medical science to those most in need of them and to serve as an antidote to despair.\\" It provides healthcare in the poorest areas of developing countries. It builds hospitals and other medical facilities, hires and trains local staff, and delivers a range of healthcare, from in-home consultations to cancer treatments. It also removes barriers to maintaining good health, such as dirty water or a lack of food, and strengthens the rights of the poor. The approach trades charity for ‚Äúaccompaniment,‚Äù which is described as a ‚Äúdogged commitment to doing whatever it takes to give the poor a fair shake.‚Äù While many of its principles are rooted in Liberation theology, the organization is secular. It forms long-term partnerships with, and works on behalf of, local ministries of health.Farmer, Paul E., Bruce Nizeye, Sara Stulac, and Salmaan Keshavjee. 2006. \\"Structural Violence and Clinical Medicine\\". PLoS Medicine, 1686-1691. PIH currently holds a 4 out of 4 stars rating from Charity Navigator, a nonprofit evaluator. History Partners In Health began in 1987, after Paul Farmer and Ophelia Dahl helped set up a community-based health project called Zanmi Lasante (\\"Partners in Health\\" in Haitian Creole) in Cange, Haiti. The organization initially focused on treating people with HIV/AIDS in rural Haiti. PIH now embraces a holistic approach to tackling disease, poverty, and human rights in a variety of countries. In 1993, Farmer used the proceeds from his John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Award to create a new arm of Partners In Health, the Institute for Health and Social Justice. Its mission is to analyze the impact of poverty and inequality on health, and to use findings to educate academics, donors, policy makers, and the general public. PIH's Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Joia Mukherjee, directs the Institute. Current work Partners In Health collaborates closely with Harvard Medical School and the Brigham and Women's Hospital. At the invitation of local governments, it strengthens and sustains public health systems in remote, rural areas. It trains and hires local healthcare workers, many of whom actively find patients in their communities and help them get care. It helps local experts conduct academic research that leads to clinical innovation. Famous supporters include Hank and John Green, Madonna, Meryl Streep, Ryan Lewis, Win Butler, R√©gine Chassagne of Arcade Fire, and Matt Damon. Haiti Zanmi Lasante is PIH's flagship project. The small clinic that started treating patients in the village of Cange in 1985 has grown into the Zanmi Lasante (ZL) Sociomedical Complex, a 104-bed hospital with two operating rooms, adult and pediatric inpatient wards, an infectious disease center (the Thomas J. White Center), an outpatient clinic, a women's health clinic (Proje Sante Fanm), ophthalmology and general medicine clinics, a laboratory, a pharmaceutical warehouse, a Red Cross blood bank, radiographic services, and a dozen schools. The organization also works in 11 other sites across Haiti's Central Plateau and beyond. Zanmi Lasante is Haiti's largest nongovernmental healthcare provider, serving 4.5 million. It employs 5,700 Haitians, including doctors, nurses, and community health workers. =Community-based models= PIH's community-based model has proved successful in delivering effective care both for common conditions like diarrhea, pneumonia, and childbirth that are often fatal for Haiti's poor and malnourished, and for complex diseases like HIV and tuberculosis. A key to this success and to the PIH model of care pioneered in Haiti has been training and hiring thousands of accompagnateurs (community health workers). The PIH model of accompagnateur care is outlined in the 5-SPICE framework, a scholarly article detailing the tenets of a successful community health worker program. The use of accompagnateurs is one of the most effective ways of removing structural barriers to adequate treatment of HIV and other chronic diseases while increasing job growth in communities that desperately require employment to further benefit the community's social structure. Focusing on minimizing the implications of structural violence is the key to the PIH model's success and to the improvement of treatment of chronic disease in rural Haiti. =Expansion in Haiti= earthquake in Haiti, PIH sent hundreds of volunteers to the island nation and mobilized an existing staff of nearly 5,000 Haitians. As ZL has expanded, it has partnered with other nongovernmental organizations and the Haitian Ministry of Health to rebuild or refurbish existing clinics and hospitals, introduce essential drugs to the formulary, establish laboratories, train and pay community health workers, and complement Ministry of Health personnel with PIH-trained staff. Clinics that previously stood empty now register hundreds of patients each day at twelve sites‚ÄîCange, Boucan Carr√©, Hinche, Thomonde, Bellad√®re, Lascahobas, Mirebalais, and Cerca La Source in the Central Plateau plus additions in the Artibonite region: Petite Rivi√®re, Saint-Marc and Verrettes. In 2008, ZL recorded more than 2.6 million patient visits at clinical sites.HPV vaccine in Haiti Summary, Nov 2011.pdf https://files.givewell.org/files/DWDA%202009/PIH/HPV%20vaccine%20in%20Haiti%20Summary,%20Nov%202011.pdf Page 1 =Response to the Haiti earthquake= When an earthquake struck Haiti on January 12, 2010, PIH/ZL resources were in place to deliver aid. In addition to providing care to the hundreds of thousands who fled to Haiti's Central Plateau and Artibonite regions, ZL established health outposts at four camps for internally displaced people in Port-au-Prince. ZL also supported the city's General Hospital (HUEH) by facilitating the placement of volunteer surgeons, physicians and nurses, and by aiding the hospital's Haitian leadership. The earthquake leveled most of the health facilities in and around Port-au-Prince, including Haiti's only public teaching hospital and nursing school, so in March 2010, PIH/ZL responded to an urgent appeal from the Haitian Ministry of Public Health and Population (MSPP) by announcing the Stand With Haiti campaign, a 3-year, $125 million plan to help Haiti rebuild. The plan included a scaled-up version of an already planned hospital, the Mirebalais Hospital. =H√¥pital Universitaire de Mirebalais= Before January 12, 2010, PIH had been planning to build a new community hospital in Mirebalais. After the earthquake, the organization quickly scaled up plans. Less than six months after the earthquake, the Haitian Ministry of Public Health and Population (MSPP) and PIH/ZL broke ground on the world-class national referral hospital and teaching center. In October 2012, Partners in Health finished construction on the H√¥pital Universitaire de Mirebalais in Haiti. The hospital provides primary-care services to about 185,000 people in Mirebalais and two nearby communities. It is also intended to serve most of the country for secondary and tertiary care. The hospital opened its doors in March 2013. The hospital provides high-quality education for Haitian nurses, medical students, and resident physicians. It has telecommunication technologies installed in meeting and operating rooms that link US-based medical professionals to help educate and train students and residents working there. Also, Partners in Health helped to establish an emergency department in the hospital. The organization has incorporated community health workers into their treatment regimen for their patients. Community health workers make necessary house visits to patients, deliver stipends and other essentials for patients' care, and keep record of their patients' progress at the hospital. Other locations =Peru= Since 1996, PIH's sister organization in Peru, Socios En Salud (SES), has been providing medical services in Lima. Based in the northern Lima district of Carabayllo, SES is now Peru's largest non- governmental health care organization, serving an estimated population of 700,000 inhabitants, many of whom have fled from poverty and political violence in Peru's countryside. As a valued partner to Peru's Ministry of Health, SES has also influenced national policies for prevention and treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and HIV and provides important training and support to help implement those policies nationwide. SES also provides a variety of services. SES provides food baskets, transportation, lodging and other forms of support for impoverished patients. The project also provides opportunities for income generation projects, job skills training, and small business loans. One example is Mujeres Unidas (\\"Women United\\"), a cooperative workshop that participates in crafts fairs in Peru and has sold handicrafts as far away as the United States, Japan and Switzerland.  Tuberculosis Treatment  SES has treated more than 10,500 people for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in Lima. SES is conducting the world's largest TB research study, the EPI Project. Funded by a National Institutes of Health grant of US$6 million in 2007, the project seeks to understand how MDR-TB and XDR-TB spreads among people living in close quarters. English =Chiapas, Mexico= The residents of the southern Mexican state of Chiapas, including millions of indigenous Maya, have long struggled with poverty, political violence, and dismal health conditions. Chiapas has extremely high rates of maternal mortality, infant mortality, and tuberculosis compared to other states in Mexico. Partners In Health, known locally as Compa√±eros En Salud, began working in Mexico in 2011. CES aims to provide a more reliable, community-based alternative by training and employing local community health promoters, called promotores. El Equipo de Apoyo en Salud y Educaci√≥n Comunitaria (EAPSEC, The Team for the Support of Community Health and Education) was established in 1985 by a small group of Mexican health promoters. They initially worked with Guatemalan refugee communities in the Chiapas border region, and later expanded their work to other marginalized people in Chiapas. EAPSEC believes that \\"a life of dignity\\" is a human right. This includes a strong public health system that responds to the most pressing health needs of the population, and access to high quality health care. Since 1989, PIH has collaborated with EAPSEC to improve medical infrastructure in the region and to recruit and train hundreds of promotores. Over the past two decades, EAPSEC has partnered with dozens of indigenous and rural communities throughout Chiapas to develop local health capacity. Recent work has focused on a network of communities in the area of Huitiupan in the highlands and around Amatan. EAPSEC is dedicated to helping communities build self- sufficiency and counts many successful community health groups throughout Chiapas among its \\"alumni.‚Äù { Community Health Workers, Yadira Roblero and Magdalena Guti√©rrez, walk down the mountain side to complete their home visits in Laguna Del Cofre, Chiapas, Mexico on March 11, 2016.

Partners In Health's work in Russia has a narrower medical focus over a vastly wider geographical area than any of its other projects. From a base in the region of Tomsk Oblast, Siberia, PIH has been working since 1998, in collaboration with the Russian Ministry of Health, to combat one of the world's worst epidemics of drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). As of 2014, 39,000 Russians had the disease. In partnership with the Division of Social Medicine and Health Inequalities (DSMHI) at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, PIH has focused on improving clinical services for MDR-TB patients in Tomsk while undertaking training and research to catalyze change in treatment of MDR-TB across the entire Russian Federation. Partners In Health began working with local clinicians to improve treatment of MDR-TB in Tomsk in 1998. The joint effort got a major boost in 2004, when a five-year, $10.8 million grant was secured from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria for efforts to improve prevention, diagnosis and treatment of TB and MDR-TB. Key components of the clinical effort include improving diagnostics in order to detect cases earlier, developing a comprehensive strategy to promote adherence among patients, improving infection control in hospitals and clinics and decreasing transmission of TB to HIV-positive patients. Work in Tomsk also encompasses health education for the public and clinical and program management training for medical personnel in Tomsk. Partners In Health operates in two other states in Russia, Voronezh and Karelia, where technical assistance is provided to regional tuberculosis services. Community Health Workers in Lesotho receive monthly trainings. =Lesotho= Bo-Mphato Lit≈°ebeletsong tsa Bophelo/Partners In Health in Lesotho was PIH's second project in Africa and the first in a country with extremely high prevalence of HIV. Approximately one quarter of Lesotho's adult population is HIV-positive and life expectancy in the country is 55 years for women and 52 for men. In addition, the Basotho people are being ravaged by a tuberculosis epidemic. Lesotho's TB rate is among the highest in the world, and TB spreads rapidly and is particularly deadly where many people's immune systems are weakened by HIV. The PIH project in Lesotho was launched in 2006 following an invitation from the Lesotho's Ministry of Health and consultation with the Clinton HIV/AIDS Initiative (CHAI, now known as the Clinton Health Access Initiative) about where to replicate that model elsewhere in Africa.

Rwandan President Paul Kagame and PIH's Paul Farmer at the Butaro ribbon cutting ceremony in 2011. =Rwanda= Partners In Health/Inshuti Mu Buzima (IMB) has been working in Rwanda since 2005. In partnership with the Government of Rwanda and the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), IMB's work supports the Ministry of Health to comprehensively strengthen the public health system in rural, underserved areas of the country. Initially, PIH and CHAI began by implementing a pilot project in two rural districts, Kayonza and Kirehe, in Rwanda's Eastern Province. Building off of PIH's approach in Haiti, the project was designed as a comprehensive primary health care model within the public sector. The approach used HIV/AIDS prevention and care as the entry point to build capacity to address the major health problems faced by the local population. Haitian physicians, nurses, and managers traveled to Rwanda extensively in the early years of the program to provide training and program design assistance.  Inshuti Mu Buzima Supported Facilities  In January 2011, PIH supported the Ministry of Health of Rwanda in the opening of Butaro District Hospital. The hospital, located in Burera district, has 156 beds.  University of Global Health Equity  In September 2015, Partners In Health inaugurated University of Global Health Equity, a non-for-profit organization offering a two-year part-time master's degree in Global Health Delivery. Construction began in September 2016 on the first phase of a campus located in Butaro. The new campus officially opened in January 2019. =Malawi= In early 2007, Abwenzi Pa Za Umoyo (APZU; Partners In Health in Chichewa), started treating patients and training community health workers in the southwestern corner of Malawi, one of the poorest and most densely populated countries in Africa. The Clinton-Hunter Development Initiative (CHDI) targeted Malawi as a country desperately needing a rural health project to address the devastating HIV/AIDS epidemic in the region. About 14 percent of Malawi's adult population is infected with HIV and hundreds of thousands of children have been orphaned by the disease. CHDI asked Partners In Health to replicate the rural initiative programs that have proven so successful in delivering HIV treatment and comprehensive primary health care in Rwanda and Lesotho.N The Malawi Ministry of Health directed PIH and CHDI to the impoverished rural area of Neno. In 2010, APZU tested 17,606 patients for HIV. The organization clinics logged 332,619 patient visits. APZU supported 889 children, allowing them to attend school and receive food. = Ebola Response in West Africa = In late 2014, PIH heeded calls from the governments of Liberia and Sierra Leone, and other international partners, to join the fight against Ebola in West Africa. Although PIH is not an emergency response organization, they felt the moral obligation to join the response, given the unprecedented nature of the outbreak in West Africa.  Sierra Leone  PIH arrived in Sierra Leone at a time when the situation was worsening every day. Within a matter of weeks, PIH transitioned from planning to implementation, and scaled operations in Sierra Leone to address the growing needs of the population and help tackle an exponentially worsening Ebola epidemic. They began in Port Loko District at the Maforki Ebola Treatment Unit and scaled up from there to ultimately provide clinical care at 16 facilities across 4 districts, and manage a network of more than 1,000 Ebola response community health workers, providing surveillance, support and referrals in rural communities. From the outset of the emergency response, PIH took a health systems strengthening approach, focused on working together with government to support the public sector response. As Ebola was brought under control, PIH shifted quickly to supporting the Ministry of Health in rebuilding its ravaged health system. Today PIH's Sierra Leone program is focused on raising the standard of care for the poorest and most marginalized through programs in Kono and Port Loko Districts, with a focus on maternal health, HIV/TB and Ebola survivor care.  Liberia  PIH began work in Liberia in November 2014, focused on responding to Ebola in Maryland County, a 20-hour drive south from the capital of Monrovia. They supported two Ebola treatment units and three community care centers, and taught teachers and community members new techniques to slow the spread of infections. Since Ebola came under control in Liberia in March 2015, PIH has focused on helping rebuild the health system, primarily for a population of roughly 100,000 in Maryland County.  Kazakhstan  Since 2009, PIH has worked in Kazakhstan with the Ministry of Health to provide services treating MDR-TB. =Partner Projects= PIH also supports partner projects in the following countries: * Africa: Project Muso in Mali; Tiyatien Health in Liberia; Village Health Works in Burundi * Asia: Possible Health in Nepal * Central America: Equipo T√©cnico de Educaci√≥n en Salud Comunitaria in Guatemala PIH also previously worked in the Dominican Republic.

It takes its name from Louis-Simon le Poupet de la Boularderie, who was granted the area as a concession from the King of France. Geography At 40 km (25 mi) long and between 3 km (2 mi) to 10 km (6 mi) wide, Boularderie Island is Nova Scotia's second largest island after Cape Breton Island. Two outlets of Bras d'Or Lake run on each side of the island to the Atlantic Ocean: * the Great Bras d'Or channel runs along the island's northwestern shore, and * St. Andrews Channel and the Little Bras d'Or channel run along the island's southeastern shore. The extreme northeastern end of the island at Point Aconi fronts the Cabot Strait, whereas the extreme southwestern end at Kempt Head fronts the northern basin of Bras d'Or Lake. The majority of the island is heavily forested, however, there is a small number of farms along the southern and eastern shores. The northern end of the island in the community of Point Aconi has been home to several underground coal mines with the last one, the Prince Colliery, closing in November 2001. There have also been several controversial proposals to strip mine near- surface deposits which is meeting significant opposition from residents in the northern end of Boularderie Island. The Point Aconi Generating Station is located at the northern end of the island adjacent to the abandoned Prince Colliery brown field. The island is divided across two of the province's counties with the north and western side being part of Victoria County (approximately 2/3 of the island's land mass), and the remainder of the more populated northeastern end being part of Cape Breton County. Communities The following communities are located on Boularderie Island: Within Cape Breton County: * Bras d'Or (The western portion of this community straddles the Little Bras d'Or Channel onto Boularderie Island.) * Dalem Lake * Groves Point * Hillside Boularderie * Mill Creek * Mill Pond * Millville (Also known as \\"Millville Boularderie\\".) * New Dominion * Point Aconi (This community also includes the place name \\"McCreadyville\\".) * Southside Boularderie (Not to be confused with the adjacent \\"Southside of Boularderie\\" in Victoria County.

This community also includes the place name \\"Island Point\\".) * Upper Kempt Head Roads The island is encircled by local roads, however, there are only two numbered highways: * Highway 105, also signed for the Trans-Canada Highway, traverses the island diagonally from the Seal Island Bridge at Boularderie East in the west through to the Little Bras d'Or Bridge at Bras d'Or in the east. It was constructed in the early 1960s. * Highway 162, also signed as the Prince Mine Rd, runs from Highway 105 at Bras d'Or to the Point Aconi Generating Station at Point Aconi.

Apart from his work as a musician, Andrews has also produced and/or mixed material for many artists, such as Nine Inch Nails, Beck, Lostprophets, Pete Yorn, A Perfect Circle, Tenacious D, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, Candlebox, Mae, and others. Also notable is his participation in the production of \\"You Know My Name\\", the theme for the 2006 James Bond movie Casino Royale, performed by Soundgarden/ex-Audioslave frontman Chris Cornell. In March 2007, Andrews released Secrets of the Lost Satellite, his first solo album under his own name, and helped oversee its release via his own label, Dinosaur Fight Records. The initial inspiration for the album came when he was invited by Beck to contribute to songs that he and his backing band were working on for the Nacho Libre soundtrack, recording sessions which Andrews described as \\"one of the most exciting of my life\\". Beck's live musical director, session musician Justin Meldal-Johnsen, was already a friend of Andrews', and shortly afterward, they and other members of Beck's band (including Matt Mahaffey of Self) began working on material that eventually became the album. Andrews also brought in another old friend, Jordon Zadorozny of Blinker the Star, to assist with songwriting and arrangements, and Zadorozny also ended up playing various instruments on some songs, as well. Both Meldal-Johnsen and Zadorozny are listed as co-producers of Secrets of the Lost Satellite. Andrews went on tour that spring for the first time since 2003, with the opening band, San Diego's First Wave Hello, also serving as his backing band. The members of Failure and Tool have been friends since the early 1990s; the two bands toured together repeatedly, and some members collaborated occasionally. Andrews is often credited for directing the music video for Tool's \\"Hush\\", but this is incorrect. He did, however, edit the video for their later single \\"Prison Sex\\". Andrews is also mistakenly credited with involvement in the post-grunge arena-rock band Neon Steam Dreams; that Andrews is a different musician by the same name. In May 2014, the Cinquanta concert with Tool, A Perfect Circle and Failure was held as a 50th Birthday Celebration for Maynard James Keenan, who asked for the band to reunite for that concert. Keenan stated, \\"This was the perfect opportunity to tick off one of my bucket list items in the form of a Failure reunion. What better birthday present could one ever hope for?\\" Failure, however, performed their first reunion show at the El Rey Theater on February 13, 2014, before the event. He was featured on an episode of WIRED Science discussing the pros and cons of digital vs. analog recording. Andrews argued that more can be done (with greater ease) with digital while Steve Albini argued that he can accomplish just as much with analog.

It was released by Troma and features early roles by Billy Bob Thornton and Hal Sparks before they became famous. Former MTV veejay Martha Quinn also appears.  Plot  The film is about an all-female motorcycle gang named the \\"Cycle Sluts\\", who cruise into the isolated town of Zariah looking for a good time. Here, an evil scientist-turned-mortician has been killing local townspeople with the aid of his long-suffering dwarf assistant and turning them into zombies to use as labor at an abandoned mine. The mine is too radioactive after underground nuclear testing to be mined by living people. Although the scientist later admits that the real reason he has been doing it is not the money, but because he is just plain mean. The zombies escape after a curious little boy removes the lock to explore the mine, becoming the zombies' first victim. Around this point, a bus-load of blind orphans become stranded just on the outskirts of town as their ride breaks down. Luckily their bus-driver always keeps an Uzi on the bus \\"for sentimental reasons\\". With vague memories of life to guide them, the zombies eventually find their way back to town and begin devouring live flesh. Going against the wishes of their leader and despite some rough treatment from the locals earlier in the film, the Cycle Sluts ride to the rescue and begin killing the zombies using chainsaws, baseball bats, welding torches, a garrote and a staple gun. In the final scene, the Cycle Sluts use fresh meat to lure the remaining zombies to the town church, which they have packed with dynamite. They are now aided by the doctor's dwarf who has decided that there are better lines of work than being a henchman. With all the undead inside and the church sealed up, the timer goes off and the church goes up in flames, zombies and all. The Cycle Sluts are rewarded with a sack full of cash and induct the dwarf and several of the blind orphans as honorary Cycle Sluts. They then ride out of town with some of the men folk in tow (their new \\"bitches\\") and throw the sack of money to the wind.  Cast  * Jamie Rose as Dede * Catherine Carlen as Rox * Lycia Naff as T.

He was the closest colleague of Kaarlo Juho St√•hlberg and was Minister of the Interior in J.H. Vennola's first and second cabinets from 1919 to 1922 for a total of 526 days. Heikki Ritavuori is a unique figure in Finland's political history because he is not remembered for his life's work, but instead for its end. Minister Ritavuori was shot dead at the door to his home in Helsinki in February 1922.  Career  The murder of a government minister is such a rare occurrence in Finland that it has almost completely overshadowed Ritavuori's achievements as a builder of Finnish society. The Turku-born lawyer, member of parliament and government minister was one of the most notable politicians in the early years of Finland's independence. He was dedicated to justice, equality among citizens, and a unified nation. Defending these values took a great deal of courage in the unstable times following the Finnish Civil War, when radical groups sought their own ends by any means necessary. Ritavuori was frightened of neither the extreme left-wing nor the extreme right, but instead implemented the reforms he felt were necessary as K.J. St√•hlberg's most trusted man. He took particular care in defending the civil rights of red prisoners of war kept in prison camps, and advocated laws to pardon them. Ritavuori was already familiar with social questions when he became Secretary of the Foundation Board of the Parliament of Finland in 1907; he was especially interested in land-owning rights and the position of peasants. As a lawyer, he liked to handle communal cases in defense of the poor. He was elected as a member of the parliament from the Turku Province southern election circle first in 1913, and then again in 1919. The acceptance of Finland's republican form of government in June 1919 is largely because of Ritavuori's work as chairman of the Foundation Board. The dispute about the form of government between the royalists and the republicans had been holding back governmental activity for months. To stop the unhelpful \\"temporary situation\\", the republican government of Kaarlo Castr√©n proposed a law establishing the new form to the Parliament of Finland in June; it was written by the President of the High Court, K.J. St√•hlberg. For the parliament to be able to accept the proposed law, it had to be classified as urgent by the meeting order. One vote more was needed for the required five-sixths majority, and so the reform of the government was about to be delayed again. It was then that Heikki Ritavuori involved himself in the matter, and only a couple of days later he gave his own proposal for a new governmental form (which he had already submitted for consideration earlier) to the parliament. The members of the parliament were amazed, but now the proposal was classified as urgent, and based on it, the parliament accepted the new form of government on 21 June 1919. Thus, Finland became a republic. Ritavuori, having served as Minister of Internal Affairs twice, was frequently confronted by activists representing the extreme right-wing. Because of the laws to pardon red prisoners of war, he was branded the \\"red minister\\", one who threatened the legacy of white Finland. Supporting St√•hlberg as the opponent of Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim in the presidential elections in summer 1919 and opposing the independence of the protection guards in the crisis of 1921 made Ritavuori even less liked in right-wing circles.  Murder  The site of the murder Ritavuori's fate was sealed by the Eastern Karelia crisis in the winter of 1921‚Äì22, when he served as minister responsible for the border guard and handled his job in a direct manner as instructed by President of Finland K.J. St√•hlberg. Based on falsified news sent from Eastern Karelia, right-wing newspapers started a smear campaign that destroyed Ritavuori's reputation and eventually caused his death. Heikki Ritavuori was shot dead at his home in Etu-T√∂√∂l√∂, at Nervanderinkatu 11, on 14 February 1922. Ernst Tandefelt, who had fired the murder weapon, was a mentally underdeveloped black sheep of a noble family. He stated that based on newspaper reports, and particularly Hufvudstadsbladet information supporting Swedish-speaking activists, he had concluded that Ritavuori was indeed a danger to the country, and thought he had to be eliminated. In court, Tandefelt said he had acted alone, and he was sentenced to 12 years of hard labor as partially legally insane. Afterwards, Tandefelt implicated several people, including the pharmacist Oskar Jansson and the general-major Paul von Gerich, who he said were involved in planning the murder. Research done by the chancellor of justice in 1927-30 did not result in any evidence that would have caused further actions in the matter. The decision was an understandable solution in the increasingly right-wing atmosphere of the time. However, many facts pointed to the theory that the initiative-less Tandefelt was supported by, if not a full conspiracy, then at least radical political actors, mostly Finland-Swedish Civil Guard activists, who encouraged Tandefelt to kill Ritavuori by giving him the murder weapon and some money.  Other notes  Heikki Ritavuori, only 41 years old at the time of his death, was a heavy-duty government figure whom several parties saw as a potential new president. Heikki Ritavuori fennicised his name in 1906. His younger brother Eero Rydman was a member of parliament from the Progressive Party, the mayor of Helsinki for 12 years, and a presidential candidate of the People's Party of Finland in 1956. Ritavuori's grandson, professor Pekka Tarjanne, was the chairman of the Liberal People's Party, a member of the parliament, a government minister, chairman of the board of the Post and Telephone Bureau, and chairman of the board of the ITU.

Close associate and friend of Bohdan Khmelnytsky, he opposed both the pacts with Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (Treaty of Hadziacz of 1658) and with Tsardom of Russia (Treaty of Pereyaslav of 1654). Biography Bohun was born in Ukrainian-Ruthenian nobility family. He took part in the Khmelnytsky Uprising against Polish rule in Ukraine. In June 1651 he was elected colonel of troops of Brac≈Çaw and took part in the Battle of Berestechko against Polish troops led by King John II Casimir, which the Cossacks lost. Surviving the defeat he regathered his forces and in June 1652 took part in the battle of Batih. In this instance the Cossacks were successful; the Polish commander Marcin Kalinowski was killed and the future hetman Stefan Czarniecki barely escaped with his life. The Polish defeat was complete and allowed the Cossack forces to start a successful offensive and effectively gain control over large parts of Ukraine. Until 1657 Ivan Bohun also led his forces in minor skirmishes against Polish forces, notably at Bratslav and Uman. He also fought against the Crimean Tatars who had switched sides in the effect of the Treaty of Zboriv of 1649 (they were initially allied with the Cossacks but supported the Commonwealth in later year). Ivan Bohun fighting Poles in the Battle of Berestechko Initially Bohun opposed the Treaty of Pereyaslav of 1654. After the Battle of Konotop, Ivan Bohun led an armed pro-Russian uprising against his former ally Ivan Vyhovsky near Konotop and defeated his army in the autumn of 1659. After being captured by the Poles in 1663, Bohun was offered freedom in exchange for taking part in a new military campaign against the Tsardom of Russia. During the retreat after the disastrous Siege of Hlukhiv Bohun was executed by a firing squad for handing over important military information to the besieged Russian garrison. Legacy Ivan Bohun Ivan Bohun became a popular Ukrainian folk hero, immortalized by Henryk Sienkiewicz in a novel With Fire and Sword where character Jurko Bohun was loosely based on him. In the film based on the novel, directed by Jerzy Hoffman, Bohun was played by Aleksandr Domogarov. Ivan Bohun is also well described in Bohun, a modern, historical novel about Polish-Cossack wars, written by Jacek Komuda.

Undaunted, a group of ex-military strategists continue to develop the stealth in secret, knowing that once complete, a sale to the Chinese for billions of dollars is assured. A team of experts is assembled to hijack the plane, including the one man capable of flying the new stealth technology, Hank Thomas (Midkiff), a staunchly American fighter pilot who unwittingly becomes involved in the operation. Once on board, the hijack begins and the Russian-trained commandos demand that Hank land on an Arctic ice cap where the real battle of survival begins.

The band was most popular in the mid-1990s, mostly in the Swedish indie-pop scene together with other bands like Eggstone or Beagle. History This Swedish band was formed in Lund, Scania, and the original members were vocalist Jan \\"Janne\\" Kask, guitarist David Birde, bassist Christoffer Lundquist, and drummer Jens Jansson. The band signed to Per Gessle's music publishing company Jimmy Fun Music and released three albums: Soda (1994; Swedish Grammy as New Band), Painkiller (1995) and Stay Free (1996). They took part as support act during the European Crash! Boom! Bang! Tour by Roxette in 1994. Janne Kask left the band in 1997 to pursue a solo career. For a while the other band members were looking for a new lead singer, but soon gave up. \\"It didn't take long for us to realize that it would be impossible to let another person join\\", David Birde explained in an interview to The Daily Roxette. \\"It would have to be the three of us, or split up. At first we thought about changing our name, but that turned out to be difficult - Sony Music had already paid for the recording of You Are Here and they wanted us to keep the name. We had to choose between ditching the recordings and lose our record deal or go on calling ourselves Brainpool. We cowardly chose the latter.\\" The band not only decided to stay together after Kask left, but they decided to change their style and their music. \\"We realized our audience was getting younger. We were 26, we were smelly and unshaven and drunk. There were 11- and 12-year-old fans who wanted a hug, we just thought it was so wrong, that's when we realized we had to do something else,\\" says David. It was time for their music to reach the level of maturity that they were at. You Are Here was released in 1999. After this release, the band worked for 4 years on a rock opera which was finally released in 2004 with the name Junk and with the topic of anti-consumerism. The premiere was in Malm√∂ on August 19, 2004 where the band was backed up by Malm√∂ Symphony Orchestra. The album was published by the band's own publishing company Junk Musik which releases singles only on the Internet. In 2005, Brainpool released the compilation We Aimed To Please. The album only contains songs from 1992 to 1997 when Janne Kask was still in the band. There are no songs from You Are Here or Junk. In May 2007 Brainpool's Junk: A Rock Opera premiered at a small venue in Los Angeles to mixed fan reviews. It sold out 36 shows, and, in the beginning of 2009, was performed as a staged reading off-Broadway in New York City. Members * Christoffer Lundquist started in the band as a bass player and backing vocalist, but has moved to play both the bass and the guitar.

It was first described by the German naturalist Peter Simon Pallas in 1764 and given the binomial name Motacilla cantillans. Includes a transcript of the 1764 text. The specific cantillans is Latin for \\"warbling\\" from canere, \\"to sing\\". Like most Curruca species, it has distinct male and female plumages. The adult male has a grey back and head, brick-red underparts, and white malar streaks (\\"moustaches\\"). The female is mainly brown above, with a greyer head, and whitish below with a pink flush. The subalpine warbler's song is fast and rattling, and is similar to the lesser whitethroat. This bird seems to be related to the Sardinian warbler-Menetries' warbler superspecies. They all have white malar areas, the heads being dark above in adult males, and naked eye-rings. These three species are related to a superspecies consisting of R√ºppell's warbler and the Cyprus warbler, which also share the white malar area with blackish above.(Shirihai et al. 2001,Phylogeny and biogeography of the genus Sylvia, pp. 24 ‚Äì 30 in: Shirihai, Hadoram, Gabriel Gargallo and Andrea J. Helbig (2001) Sylvia warblers: Identification, taxonomy and phylogeny of the genus Sylvia Helm Identification Guides J√∏nsson & Fjelds√• 2006 ) The subalpine warbler is divided into two distinct subspecies groups, which may possibly be sufficiently diverged to qualify as two separate species (Shirihai et al. 2001). The two groups have differing male plumages, distinctive calls, and are allopatric; further study is needed. In May 2020, the IOC world bird list the split of western and eastern subalpine warbler as two distinct species. Moltoni's warbler was formerly considered conspecific. Eastern subalpine warbler differs from the western subalpine warbler by its deeper blue-grey upperparts, a blackish mask on the lores and ear-coverts, brick reddish-brown coloration confined to the throat and breast and sharply demarcated from a largely white belly, paler flanks and a wider white submoustachial stripe.Duquet, Marc and Amine Flitti (2007) √âl√©ments d'identification de la Fauvette passerinette orientale [Sylvia cantillans albistriata] Ornithos Vol. 14, no. 3, pages 164 ‚Äì 171 (in French) This is a bird of dry open country, often on hill slopes, with bushes for nesting. The nest is built in low shrub or gorse, and 3‚Äì5 eggs are laid. Like most \\"warblers\\", it is insectivorous, but will also take berries.  Habitat and ecology  This species prefers tall and dense heterogeneous maquis with sparse tree cover in dry Mediterranean areas, particularly maquis of holm oak (Quercus ilex) and those dominated by strawberry tree (Arbutus) and tree-heath (Erica). It is also frequently found in young cork oak (Quercus suber) forest and in dense but treeless bushy areas. It uses bushy formations dominated by brambles (Rubus fruticosus) along sunny ravines and valley bottoms and prefers the intermediate stages of post-wildfire succession. Breeding occurs from late March to late June and the species is monogamous. The male constructs several ‚Äòcock nests‚Äô but both sexes build the breeding nest which is a deep, robust cup of grasses, thin roots and leaves and lined with finer grasses, rootlets and hair. It is placed in low scrub, bush or a small tree, c. 30‚Äì130 cm above the ground. Clutches are three to five eggs. The diet is mostly small insects and their larvae but outside of the breeding season berries and fruits are also taken.

It is owned by iHeartMedia and serves the Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton radio market. WSAN broadcasts a talk radio format drawing exclusively from iHeartRadio podcasts. Its studios and offices are in the iHeart Broadcasting Center in Whitehall Township and the transmitter is near the Whitehall Mall.http://radio-locator.com/cgi-bin/patg?id=WSAN-AM&h;=N It operates with 5,000 watts, non-directional by day but using a directional antenna at night. WSAN serves as the Lehigh Valley affiliate for Philadelphia Phillies radio broadcasts. Most hours begin with world and national news from NBC Radio News and local news from the WAEB news staff. History =Early Years= The station first signed on the air on May 24, 1923. Two separately owned stations shared time originally on AM 1440 in Allentown, WCBA and WSAN.Broadcasting Yearbook 1935 page 54 Eventually, Lehigh Valley Broadcasting, owner of WSAN, bought out WCBA, giving WSAN the ability to broadcast around the clock. (For a time it used both call signs, \\"WSAN-WCBA\\" but eventually dropped WCBA from its station identification.) WSAN was owned by the Musselmann Family for decades, from its founding until 1992. In the 1941, with the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA) going into effect, WSAN switched to its current spot on the dial at 1470 kHz. But it was only powered at 500 watts.Broadcasting Yearbook 1943 page 132 It was granted an increase to its current 5,000 watts in the late 1940s. In 1947, it added an FM station at 99.9 MHz, WSAN-FM.Broadcasting Yearbook 1950 page 252 But in the late 1950s, it sold the station to The Easton Express newspaper, which moved its 98.3 WEEX-FM, powered at only 1,000 watts, over to 99.9, where it could increase its power to 16,000 watts. (Today, the 99.9 frequency is occupied by WODE-FM in Easton.) Assabe and Sabina, a popular Pennsylvania German dialect radio program, was broadcast on WSAN from 1944 to 1955. Through the 1930s, 40s and 50s, WSAN was an NBC Red Network affiliate, airing its schedule of dramas, comedies, news, sports, soap operas, game shows and big band broadcasts during the \\"Golden Age of Radio.\\"Broadcasting Yearbook 1945 page 144 As network programming moved from radio to television, WSAN began airing a full service middle of the road (MOR) format of music, talk and information, in the 1950s and 60s. =Progressive Rock= The station made a bold move in the 1970s. Through most of the decade, WSAN was a rare progressive rock outlet on the AM dial, even though the format was found mostly on FM stations, which could play the music in stereophonic sound. (The only other AM progressive station was KSAN in San Francisco. It was a coincidence the two stations had similar call letters.) At the time, four of the five FM stations in Allentown, Bethlehem and Easton were running automated easy listening or beautiful music formats, and the fifth was automated adult contemporary. So with no rock stations serving the Lehigh Valley radio market, WSAN filled the void. In 1978, 95.1 WEZV (now WZZO) switched from easy listening to album rock, and WSAN's days as an AM rock station were numbered. =Disco and Country Music= By the end of the 70s, WSAN switched to a pop and disco format. Then, as disco faded, WSAN flipped to country music, until about 1980. At that time, it changed to a big band/adult standards format called \\"Unforgettable.\\" WSAN played the hits of the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, with a small amount of soft rock cuts from the 1960s and 1970s. In 1983, still operating with the call letters WSAN, the station evolved into more of a popular MOR music format under the catchphrase \\"Unforgettable II.\\" It expanded to playing the soft hits of the 1950s through the 1980s. In spring 1985, rival station WXKW 104.1 dropped country music for a soft adult contemporary sound as WAEB-FM. With no FM country station in the Lehigh Valley, WSAN returned to country music and took the call letters give up by FM 104.1. It became 1470 WXKW. In 1992, Holt Broadcasting, which owned the local stations 95.1 WZZO and 1320 WKAP, purchased AM 1470. It maintained the country music format until 1993. 1470 WXKW then switched to a satellite oldies format when WKAP 1320 dropped it to return to easy listening. In 1996, Holt Broadcasting sold WZZO and 1470 WXKW to Capstar, which already owned WAEB and WAEB-FM. Holt kept 1320 AM, switched the station to a sports format and changed the call letters to WTKZ. =WKAP history= WKAP began operation on 1320 AM in 1948. The station employed a popular music format for many years. It was owned by Rahall Communications. In the 1950s, it opted to play mostly non rock music and some softer songs by rock and roll artists. This format was known as MOR, or Middle of the Road. Throughout the 1960s, it had a top-40 format, combined with relatively apolitical call-in shows. By 1970, the station evolved to more of an adult contemporary format. In 1972, WKAP decided to compete with the two Top 40 stations in the Lehigh Valley, WAEB 790 AM, which played current music, and WEEX 1230 AM, which played oldies music. WKAP's adult top 40 format emulated West Coast giant KCBQ in San Diego. Some of the original WKAP DJs were Kevin Fennessy, Walt Brown, Shotgun Steve Kelly, Mark Stewart, Kris Bailey, Billy Sheridan, and J. Robert Taylor. The station was known as WKAP Radio 13. The station was sold to Gulf Broadcasting in the late 1970s. In September 1978, a local club DJ by the name of Mike Jacobs came up with an idea of broadcasting an entire evening of live music, commercial-free, from a local night club. The facility to be used was \\"The Castle Garden Ballroom\\" located in Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom in Allentown. The park's owners were Robert Plarr and Robert Ott. After extensive renovations, Castle Garden was opened in the fall of 1978. Crowds averaged about 300-450 per night, but the ballroom capacity was 2,000, so the owners and management were looking for a spark to drive the venue to bigger and better crowds. At the time, the radio station was an independent local AM station. The PD, Chris Bailey, the station manager Jerry Duckett, and the staff were very interested in the project, as it could help them in competition with their cross-town nemesis WAEB 790AM and add a possible ratings boost. FCC warning The idea was refined, and in January 1979, \\"Studio 13\\" debuted. It was broadcast Saturdays from 9:00 PM ‚Äì 2:00 AM with DJ Mike Jacobs as the DJ/Host/MC. Bill Sheridan (now employed by [Cumulus]) was the board technician. Pepsi-Cola came on board as the primary sponsor for the show. The station would insert voice-only commercials over the instrumental breaks in the music. The show opened with the Parliament's \\"Shit, Goddamn, Get Off Your Ass & Jam,\\" followed by Bell & James' \\"Livin It Up\\". This resulted in an FCC Warning to the station that made the local news. The crowd was 600 people the first night. With the news coverage and word of mouth, Studio 13 averaged 2,000 people per night and could have done more had there not been a Fire Marshall's limit on the number of people. WKAP realized a ratings jump from 3.8 to 23.4 Saturday evenings from 9:00PM to midnight in a one- month period and maintained this throughout the summer, until the show's conclusion on Labor Day of 1979. The management of Castle Garden invested in and shot a one-hour video pilot entitled Castle Garden that it attempted unsuccessfully to syndicate. In the fall of 1979, at the Annual Billboard Disco Forum and Convention in New York City, Mike Jacobs received an honorable mention as \\"DJ of the Year\\" for the Philadelphia region and was invited to spin at the Roseland Ballroom during the convention. WKAP also fared well, being nominated for \\"Most Innovative Breakout Radio Show\\" for the year 1979, but lost out to WCAU-FM in Philadelphia. Mike Jacobs continued in radio and clubs in the area, working at Sunny 1100 WGPA and 96.1 WLEV-FM until his retirement in 1997. Some of the other WKAP on-air personalities moved on to other outlets, such as Bill Sheridan to WKRZ in Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania and 99 \\"The Hawk\\" WODE-FM in Easton, Pennsylvania, and Kris Bailey to AM 790 WAEB. By 1980, WKAP evolved into more of an adult contemporary music format. At the end of the Summer 1982, WKAP changed to an adult standards format, which was known as \\"Music of Your Life\\". The station featured easy listening vocalists from the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, as well as big band music from the 1930s and 1940s. The station played a limited amount of non-rock songs from the 1970s. The station stayed with this format through the 1980s. In 1984, Gulf Broadcasting sold WKAP to Holt Broadcasting, which at the time also owned WZZO. WKAP stayed with its standards music format, but added a bit more baby- boomer pop (songs by artists like Elvis Presley and The Beatles). In 1990, WKAP switched to a satellite-delivered oldies music format, playing mostly songs from 1964-1969 with some 1955-64 songs and a few 1970-73 songs mixed in. They continued with this format until 1992, at which time they returned to adult standards. This featured non-rock music as well as some soft rock music of the 1950s and 1960s, along with a small amount of 1940s hits and some soft hits form the 1970s. It was more of an easy listening based format than \\"Music Of Your Life\\". Their decision to abandon oldies music in 1992 was due to 99.9 FM WODE's adopting the format in late 1991. In 1992, Holt Broadcasting also bought 1470 WXKW, which remained a country music station for another year. In 1993, the station switched to a satellite oldies format when 1320 flipped back to standards. Then, in 1996, Holt Broadcasting sold all of their stations except for AM 1320, which they made a sports station. Eventually AM 1320 was sold to Nassau Broadcasting Partners and today simulcasts WEEX. Capstar, which already owned WAEB-AM and WAEB-FM, then purchased 1470 AM and WZZO. The WKAP intellectual unit then moved from AM 1320 to AM 1470. 1470 WKAP used a Westwood One easy listening format, playing a blend of standards and soft oldies/adult contemporary songs. Capstar merged with Chancellor Media in 1999, making WKAP 1470 an AM/FM station. At the beginning of 2001, Clear Channel Communications merged with AM/FM. Federal regulations limited the number of Lehigh Valley stations Clear Channel could own. They opted to sell WEEX and WODE to Nassau Broadcasting Partners, and kept WAEB, WAEB-FM, WZZO, and WKAP. In November 2001, a few days after Oldies 99.9 FM WODE switched to classic rock hits, WKAP switched back to playing oldies songs from 1955 to 1973. Many of the air staff on WKAP came from WODE when the formats of the two stations changed. The station was popular, as it was the only oldies music station in the Lehigh Valley, with music from the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s. This format aired successfully for almost five years. The WKAP call sign was used from 2006-2007 at an AM station in Reading, Pennsylvania, but was dropped for the previous call sign and format (WRAW). =WYHM= On September 11, 2006, WKAP ended its oldies format and adopted a Christian talk and teaching format. With this change, the station took the call sign WYHM, a disambiguation of \\"Hymm.\\" The station was still a commercial radio station rather than non- commercial like many Christian outlets. Though owned by Clear Channel Communications, the station was run similarly to how Salem Media runs its many Christian stations, including 560 WFIL in Philadelphia. Commercial blocks of time are sold to Christian religious leaders, to host shows and seek donations to their ministries. Some of the Christian programming included Focus On The Family, Insight for Living, Janet Parshall's America, Adventures In Odyssey, Turning Point and Back To The Bible. Mornings were hosted by \\"Doug & Kim\\". =Return to WSAN Call Letters= In March 2007, the short-lived experiment with the Christian Talk format ended. The call sign returned to WSAN and the station adopted a sports-talk format, affiliated with Fox Sports Radio. WSAN carries Phillies baseball nearly every evening from the beginning of April through the end of September. Syndicated personalities Mancow, Jim Rome and Phil Hendrie were carried on the station. In a bow to its former existence as an oldies station, in the winter of 2007 WSAN dropped one of Fox Sports Radio's weekday morning programs in favor of a three-hour oldies music show. On May 26, 2016, WSAN flipped from English-language sports to Spanish-language sports as ESPN Deportes Lehigh Valley. The station continued to air English- language broadcasts of Philadelphia Phillies and Lehigh Valley Phantoms games. On March 13, 2019, the station dropped ESPN Deportes Radio and rebranded as iHeartPodcast AM 1470. Its programming is now sourced primarily from podcast programs distributed by iHeartRadio (including HowStuffWorks podcasts such as Stuff You Should Know). WSAN continues to retain the local sports play-by-play rights it held before, including Philadelphia Phillies baseball.

The station is owned by the Trinity Broadcasting Network. KPAZ-TV's studios are located on East McDowell Road in southeast Phoenix, and its transmitter is located atop South Mountain on the city's south side. History =Spanish Language Television of Arizona= On February 10, 1965, Spanish Language Television of Arizona, Inc., filed with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to build a new station on channel 14 in Phoenix. A January 1966 article stated that the station had already secured an affiliation with the Spanish International Network and planned to begin broadcasts by Labor Day of that year. In May, after the FCC overhauled the UHF table of allocations, SLTA amended its application to specify channel 21, as well as a studio location at 16th Street and Buckeye Road in Phoenix. Plans also included the commissioning of a repeater to expand the station's coverage to include Tucson within a year of signing on. By early 1967, the station had set a June sign-on date, and several other details had changed. KPAZ would instead build its studios as part of the expansion of the Tower Plaza shopping center, and it also announced plans to air a ticker-tape of Associated Press newswire during the daytime hours. The station would sign on the air September 16, 1967‚ÄîMexican Independence Day‚Äîas Arizona's first full-power UHF station. Channel 21's formal opening included dignitaries such as Governor Jack Williams, Senator Barry Goldwater and Phoenix mayor Milton H. Graham. KPAZ began its life as a bilingual independent station, with a mix of SIN-supplied entertainment programs (primarily from Mexico) in Spanish and news and sports programs in English; Thomson hoped to start four other stations like KPAZ nationwide. The station's Spanish-language programs also included Hoy en Phoenix, the Valley's first Spanish-language television newscast, anchored by Ivo Luis Alonso, former senior Latin American editor for Voice of America. In sports, KPAZ's primary draw was weekly bullfighting telecasts from Mexico, which were important enough to the station that a bull was incorporated into its logo but also made the new station a lightning rod for controversy. A handful of irate local residents accused the station of being run by Communists. KPAZ also aired English-language entertainment shows, including Arizona State Sun Devils football highlights, and the syndicated music program Upbeat. The station also produced local and alternative programming. KRIZ DJ Tony Evans hosted a dance and music show on Fridays; a Saturday night talk show known as Basharoonie, hosted by Jim Spero, appeared in early 1969. Despite its ambitious plans and counterprogramming, KPAZ made no headway against established independent KPHO- TV (channel 5). By early 1969, pressure from advertisers had resulted in the bullfighting being phased out of KPAZ's schedule. In August, less than two years after signing on, SLTA filed for bankruptcy, a lengthy process that lasted nearly two years for channel 21. One of the largest creditors was RCA Victor, from which KPAZ had bought broadcast equipment but never made more than the down payment. In October, a judge rejected channel 21's proposal for a trustee, instead naming Julius Altschul to the post. An interim investor in channel 21, the Scottsdale-based Music and Entertainment Co., made a $225,000 offer to buy the station, which RCA contested. =Glad Tidings Church= On June 3, 1970, federal bankruptcy referee Hugh Caldwell approved channel 21's sale to the Glad Tidings Church for $400,000, contingent on FCC approval. Compared to the purchase price, RCA was owed $160,000; Ampex, another equipment manufacturer, $85,000; and Valley National Bank was owed $30,000. Caldwell also ruled that the stockholders in SLTA were not eligible to receive a cent, saying KPAZ's bankruptcy had actually begun on May 31, 1969, before the bankruptcy filing in August. Glad Tidings had bought the station after the existing stations in town refused to give the church time on their air, raising funds through the sale of bonds. Glad Tidings, even though it did not yet have the license, immediately took an active hand in operating KPAZ, raising potential concerns about undue influence. Less than a month after the approval in bankruptcy court, general manager Lou Silverstein resigned after a year at channel 21, citing indications he had received from bankruptcy trustee Altschul that Glad Tidings \\"wanted a manager who would work more closely with the church\\". He was replaced by ex-KPHO general manager Gene Spry. The changes did not take long to follow, as channel 21 began adding religious programming on the weekends. By April 1971, even though the license had still not transferred to Glad Tidings, the station was signing off nightly with an image of Jesus Christ. It would not be until June that the FCC approved the transfer of the KPAZ-TV license, at which time Glad Tidings announced it had bought new color videotape equipment. To continue to fund channel 21's operation, Glad Tidings broadcast periodic pledge drives. In October, the station staged an 11-day telethon titled Outreach '72. That same month, Gene Spry resigned as general manager and was replaced by the Rev. V. O. Brassfield, the church's assistant pastor. KPAZ also continued to originate new local programming through the bankruptcy process. Children's show Mr. Adam's Animals featured trained chimpanzees. In 1971, station manager Keith Houser created Action Auction. The live Saturday night program, allowed viewers to bid for products such as furniture, Native American jewelry and automobile supplies. However, the show was canceled after Spry resigned. Despite FCC approval, the sale to Glad Tidings met with continued opposition from KPAZ's largest creditor: RCA. The company filed at the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to appeal the KPAZ reorganization plan, warning that the original applications filed by Glad Tidings were so inadequate that they forced the church to retain a communications lawyer. On the line was all of RCA's equipment in use at channel 21. The appeals court found in favor of RCA in March 1972, ruling that, under state law, the equipment it had sold still belonged to RCA and could be repossessed at any time. However, bankruptcy referee Caldwell allowed KPAZ to reach a separate deal with RCA as to its equipment, allowing it to continue to operate. The decision reduced the effective purchase price to $155,000. Filings in the case revealed that bankruptcy trustee Altschul had not been allowed to see KPAZ's financial records. At the same time, Maricopa County won a ruling ordering KPAZ to pay it $16,000 in back property taxes for 1970 and 1971. Glad Tidings continued to invest in KPAZ. On May 5, 1974, ground was broken for a new, two-story studio facility at the corner of 36th Street and McDowell Road in Phoenix. The facility, designed by architect James R. Abney, cost $1 million and opened in June 1975. The February 1975 Nielsen ratings showed KPAZ pulled more female viewers aged 25‚Äì40 for its broadcasts of The Real McCoys than those watching the CBS Evening News. Additionally, channel 21 aired a package of Phoenix Giants minor league baseball games in the 1975 season. =Financial collapse and sale= KPAZ-TV continued to lose money, with debts approaching $2 million, and as early as December 1975, potential suitors appeared. Trinity Broadcasting of Arizona, a subsidiary of a fledgling broadcast ministry known as the Trinity Broadcasting Network, filed to buy KPAZ from debt-ridden Glad Tidings, with plans to convert the station to entirely religious programming. Immediately, Trinity began buying air time on KPAZ at a rate of $10,000 a month, giving the station a vital lifeline. However, the deal collapsed on July 26 when Glad Tidings Church informed the FCC by telegram that it was terminating the deal, just one day before the commission was to take up the proposed sale. TBN founder Paul Crouch said that the church had apparently pulled out because TBN's purchase of airtime on KPAZ had ameliorated its financial situation to the point where the church sought to renegotiate the sale. On January 19, 1977, RCA seized KPAZ's equipment for outstanding debts, forcing channel 21 to go dark. General manager Dale Allen Richman noted that the company \\"simply came in and took what was rightfully theirs\\". The next week, Euel and Cinderalla Ballentine, a couple who had bought $25,000 in Glad Tidings savings certificates promoted on the station, sued the church and 11 of its officers and directors, saying that they failed to disclose that Glad Tidings could not pay the interest on the certificates. General manager Richman defended channel 21, claiming that \\"the devil is trying to strike down the Christian ministry of this television station\\". With KPAZ off the air, Trinity, still pursuing options to buy the station, was joined by the PTL Television Network, which began negotiating to buy KPAZ from Glad Tidings. At the time, PTL owned no television stations of its own. However, in March, TBN made another push to buy the station, asking KPAZ's bondholders to swap their Glad Tidings bonds for those of Trinity Broadcasting of Arizona. The Trinity acquisition was approved by the FCC on July 21, with the station returning to the air on Labor Day as its second station, after flagship KTBN-TV in Santa Ana, California. TBN also settled the lawsuit brought by the Ballentines for $27,500. =KPAZ under TBN= In 1979, TBN proposed adding a horizontal cross piece to KPAZ's South Mountain tower, which would have been lit to create a lighted cross; this was denied by the City of Phoenix parks department, which said that the towers on the mountain were already a \\"necessary evil\\" and that religious symbols did not belong on public property. Digital television =Digital channels= KPAZ-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 21, on that date. The station's digital signal continued to broadcast on its pre-transition UHF channel 20. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 21. The station received UHF channel 20 as its digital television allocation in April 1997 and was granted a permit to begin constructing digital facilities in August 2001. Special Temporary Authority granted in October 2002 allowed the digital signal to sign on the air at a lower power level. KPAZ elected channel 20 for its post-transition facilities, allowing the station to build its final facilities right away, but construction was delayed due to a steep rise in local construction that left the Phoenix area with a shortage of workers to install the DTV antenna . In March 2007, the station began program testing and in February 2008, certified that it was operating its full-power post-transition facilities.

The station's service contour covers the Lehigh Valley area of Pennsylvania. The station is owned by Cumulus Media, through licensee Radio License Holding CBC, LLC, and broadcasts a classic rock radio format, playing rock hits from the 1960s into the early 1990s. WODE-FM's transmitter, studios and offices are on Paxinosa Road West in Easton. The station is frequently at or near the top of the ratings in the Allentown- Easton-Bethlehem radio market. WODE-FM broadcasts using HD Radio, and simulcasts the sports programming of sister station 1230 AM WEEX on its HD2 subchannel. History =WEEX-FM= The station began operations on 98.3 FM as a stand-alone FM station. It got its construction permit from the Federal Communications Commission in 1948, and signed on the air in June 1950.Broadcasting Yearbook 1952 page 244 Its call letters stood for the Easton Express, Easton's daily newspaper as well as the station's owner. WEEX-FM was originally powered at only 1,000 watts. In the late 1950s, WSAN AM 1470 in nearby Allentown decided to give up its FM station on 99.9 MHz. The Easton Express took over the 99.9 frequency, boosting WEEX-FM's power to 16,000 watts.Broadcasting Yearbook 1960 page A-216 Also in the late 1950s, the newspaper put an AM station on the air at 1230 kHz under the WEEX call sign. In the early 1960s, WEEX 1230 switched to a Top 40 radio format during that time and used the FM station to simulcast much of the programming to cover areas where the AM station's 1,000 watt signal could not be heard. =WQQQ Beautiful Music= In the late 1960s, WEEX-FM's simulcast with the AM was broken off under new Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules which forbid full-time AM/FM simulcasts. The FM station switched to beautiful music under the WQQQ call sign. The call letters were chosen because the lower-case Q closely resembled the number 9, hence the station's frequency 99.9. The station offered an instrumental-based easy listening format, playing cover versions of pop songs, as well as Broadway and Hollywood showtunes. A few times per hour a soft vocal was mixed in. =1983-1991 Contemporary Hits= In late 1982, The Easton Express acquired The Globe-Times, a newspaper in nearby Bethlehem. To satisfy the FCC's media ownership rules, both WQQQ and WEEX were sold off to Wilkes-Schwartz Broadcasting, so that the Easton Express would not own too many media outlets in the same market. On April 4, 1983, WQQQ swapped formats with its AM sister station, WEEX 1230. WEEX had evolved by 1981 from Top 40 into an adult contemporary format. WEEX's disc jockeys moved to 99.9 FM. WQQQ's easy listening format was moved to 1230 WEEX but it played more vocals than it did on FM. The former WEEX format was modified on FM into Mainstream CHR/Top 40. The station kept the WQQQ call sign but became known as \\"Q 100.\\" Initially, the station focused on current pop music, but also played a moderate amount of 60s and 70s oldies until about 1985. Throughout the 80s, WQQQ aired a Saturday evening oldies show. But by 1986, the regular rotation was mostly current and recent titles. At the time, Q100 was the only Top 40/CHR station in the Allentown/Easton/Bethlehem radio market, competing with then-dominate Album Rock station 95.1 WZZO for first place in the ratings. However, on January 26, 1987, former country music outlet WXKW switched to CHR as \\"Laser 104.1 WAEB-FM.\\" While the change didn't have an immediate impact on Q100's ratings, a burnt-out transmission line in the summer of 1988 forced the station to broadcast on low-power for a period of 2 weeks. This caused Q100's ratings to slip, allowing WAEB-FM to beat Q100 in the ratings. In 1989, Roth Broadcasting acquired WQQQ, and sister station WEEX from Wilkes-Schwartz. That September, Q100 switched to a dance-leaning CHR format as \\"Hot 99.9\\" under the WHXT call sign. The format lasted about a year before returning to Mainstream CHR. After an uphill ratings battle with its rival WAEB-FM for almost 2 years, Hot 99.9 was unable to make any significant gains due to budget and signal issues. However, in its final ratings trend as a CHR, WHXT had beaten WAEB-FM by two-tenths of a point. =1991-2001 Oldies= On August 23, 1991, WHXT dropped its CHR format for oldies. The format played the hits of the 1950s, 1960s, and a few songs from the early 1970s. The call sign became WODE-FM (standing for OlDiEs) and the station became known as \\"Oldies 99\\" under programming consultant Pete Salant. The station was sold to Patterson Broadcasting and became \\"Oldies 99.9\\" in the mid 1990s (adding the \\"point nine\\" in its handle as more radios employed digital tuners). In 1997, Capstar bought WODE-FM and WEEX as part of a multi-station deal, but spun the Easton stations off to Clear Channel Communications. Capstar had to do this because the Lehigh Valley has only five FM stations, and under FCC rules, no one company could own more than half. Capstar was already buying 95.1 WZZO and 104.1 WAEB-FM. Under Clear Channel ownership, WODE-FM continued its oldies format. =2001-2013 Classic Hits= In 2000, Clear Channel announced a merger with AM/FM Broadcasters (a company which was created as a result of a merger with Capstar and Chancellor). AM/FM already owned WZZO and WAEB-FM. Clear Channel would not be allowed to keep all three stations upon the merger, so it decided to swap WODE-FM and WEEX with Nassau Broadcasting Partners. Nassau was given cash plus WODE-FM and WEEX, while Clear Channel obtained stations in New Jersey, including WNNJ, WNNJ-FM, WSUS, WHCY, and management agreements for WDLC and WTSX. Clear Channel also kept the former Capstar/AM-FM stations. In September 2001, WODE-FM hit #1 in the Fall 2001 Arbitron ratings in the Allentown market. The station was originally called \\"99-9 The River\\" but was forced to change its name because Clear Channel owned the rights to the name \\"The River.\\" WODE-FM became known as \\"99-9 The Hawk.\\" Its slogan was \\"The Valley's Classic Hits Station.\\" The station's ratings generally led the market with the key 25-54 audience. WODE-FM, along with nine other Nassau stations in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, was purchased at bankruptcy auction by NB Broadcasting in May 2012. NB Broadcasting was controlled by Nassau's creditors ‚Äî Goldman Sachs, Pluss Enterprises, and P.E. Capital. WODE-FM was included in the deal after Goldman Sachs rejected a bid from Cumulus Media for the station. In November, NB Broadcasting filed a motion to assign its rights to the stations to Connoisseur Media. The sale to Connoisseur Media, at a price of $38.7 million, was consummated on May 29, 2013. =2013-now Classic Rock= With the sale completed in July 2013, Connoisseur Media tweaked the format, giving it more of a rock focus and changing the slogan to \\"Classic Rock of the 70s, 80s and More.\\" In late 2013, WODE-FM acquired translator W234AX 94.7 FM, licensed to serve Allentown, from Family Life Ministries.

Knuckle-walking is a form of quadrupedal walking in which the forelimbs hold the fingers in a partially flexed posture that allows body weight to press down on the ground through the knuckles. Gorillas and chimpanzees use this style of locomotion as do anteaters and platypuses. Knuckle-walking helps with actions other than locomotion on the ground. For the gorilla the fingers are used for the manipulation of food, and in chimpanzees for the manipulation of food and for climbing. In anteaters and pangolins, the fingers have large claws for opening the mounds of social insects. Platypus fingers have webbing that extend past the fingers to aid in swimming, thus knuckle-walking is used to prevent stumbling. Gorillas move around by knuckle-walking, although they sometimes walk bipedally for short distances while carrying food or in defensive situations. Mountain gorillas use knuckle-walking plus other parts of their hand‚Äîfist-walking does not use the knuckles, using the backs of their hand, and using their palms. Anthropologists once thought that the common ancestor of chimpanzees and humans engaged in knuckle-walking, and humans evolved upright walking from knuckle-walking: a view thought to be supported by reanalysis of overlooked features on hominid fossils. Since then, scientists discovered Ardipithecus ramidus, a human-like hominid descended from the common ancestor of chimpanzees and humans. Ar. ramidus engaged in upright walking, but not knuckle-walking. This leads to the conclusion that chimpanzees evolved knuckle-walking after they split from humans six million years ago, and humans evolved upright walking without knuckle-walking. This would imply that knuckle-walking evolved independently in the African great apes, which would mean a homoplasic evolution of this locomotor behaviour in gorillas and chimpanzees. However, other studies have argued the opposite by pointing out that the differences in knuckle-walking between gorillas and chimpanzees can be explained by differences in positional behaviour, kinematics, and the biomechanics of weight-bearing. Apes Chimpanzees and gorillas engage in knuckle-walking. This form of hand-walking posture allows these tree climbers to use their hands for terrestrial locomotion while retaining long fingers for gripping and climbing. It may also allow small objects to be carried in the fingers while walking on all fours. This is the most common type of movement for gorillas, although they also practice bipedalism. Their knuckle-walking involves flexing the tips of their fingers and carrying their body weight down on the dorsal surface of their middle phalanges. The outer fingers are held clear off the ground. The wrist is held in a stable, locked position during the support phase of knuckle-walking by means of strongly flexed interphalangeal joints, and extended metacarpophalangeal joints. The palm as a result is positioned perpendicular to the ground and in-line with the forearm. The wrist and elbow are extended throughout the last period in which the knuckle-walker's hand carried body weight. There are differences between knuckle-walking in chimpanzees and gorillas: juvenile chimpanzees engage in less knuckle-walking than juvenile gorillas. Another difference is that the hand bones of gorillas lack key features that were once thought to limit the extension of the wrist during knuckle-walking in chimpanzees. For example, the ridges and concavities features of the capitate and hamate bones have been interpreted to enhance stability of weight-bearing; on this basis, they have been used to identify knuckle-walking in fossils. These are found in all chimpanzees but in only two out of five gorillas. They are also less prominent when found in gorillas. They are however found in primates that do not knuckle-walk. It has been suggested that chimpanzee knuckle-walking and gorilla knuckle-walking are biomechanically and posturally distinct. Gorillas use a form of knuckle- walking which is \\"columnar\\". In this forelimb posture, the hand and wrist joints are aligned in a relatively straight, neutral posture. In contrast, chimpanzees use an extended wrist posture. These differences underlie the different characteristics of their hand bones. The difference has been attributed to the greater locomotion of chimpanzees in trees, compared to gorillas. The former frequently engage in both knuckle-walking and palm- walking branches. As a result, to preserve their balance in trees, chimpanzees, like other primates in trees, often extended their wrists. This need has produced different wrist bone anatomy and, through this, a different form of knuckle-walking. Knuckle-walking has been reported in some baboons. It has also been suggested that fossils attributed to Australopithecus anamensis and Au. afarensis had specialized wrist morphology that was retained from an earlier knuckle-walking ancestor. = Gorillas = Gorillas use the form of walking on all fours with the fingers on the hands of the front two limbs folded inward. A gorilla's forearm and wrist bones lock together to be able to sustain the weight of the animal and create a strong supporting structure. Gorillas use this form of walking because their hips are attached differently than humans so standing on two legs for a long period of time would eventually become painful. Humans would have to walk on all fours as well if they had the same type of hip placement. Gorillas sometimes do walk upright in instances where dangers are present. Nonprimates Giant anteaters and platypuses are also knuckle-walkers. Pangolins also sometimes walk on their knuckles. Another possible knuckle-walking taxon was the extinct chalicotheres, which looked something like a cross between a horse and a gorilla. The ground sloths may have also walked on their knuckles. Advantages Knuckle-walking tends to evolve when the fingers of the forelimb are specialized for tasks other than locomotion on the ground. In the gorilla the fingers are used for the manipulation of food, and in chimpanzees for the manipulation of food and for climbing. In anteaters and pangolins the fingers have large claws for opening the mounds of social insects. Platypus fingers have webbing that extend past the fingers to aid in swimming, thus knuckle-walking is used to prevent stumbling. It has been argued that knuckle-walking of chimpanzees and gorillas originally started from fist-walking as found in orangutans. African apes most likely diverged from ancestral arboreal apes (similar to orangutans) who were adapted to distribute their weight among tree branches and forest canopies. Adjustments made for terrestrial locomotion early on may have involved fist- walking, later evolving into knuckle-walking. Evolution of knuckle-walking There are competing hypotheses as to how knuckle-walking evolved as a form of locomotion, stemming from comparisons between African apes. High magnitudes of integration would indicate homoplasy of knuckle-walking in gorillas and chimpanzees, in which a trait is shared or similar between two species but is not derived from a common ancestor. However, results show that they are not characterized by such high magnitudes, which does not support independent evolution of knuckle-walking. Similarities between gorillas and chimpanzees have been suggested to support a common origin for knuckle-walking, such as manual pressure distribution when practicing this form of locomotion. On the other hand, their behavioral differences have been hypothesized to suggest convergent evolution, or homoplasy. Another hypothesis proposes that African apes came from a bipedal ancestor, as there are no differences in hemoglobin between Pan and Homo, suggesting that their divergence occurred relatively recently. Examining protein sequence changes suggests that Gorilla diverged before the clade Homo-Pan, meaning that ancestral bipedalism would require parallel evolution of knuckle-walking in separate chimpanzee and gorilla radiations. The fact that chimpanzees practice both arboreal and knuckle- walking locomotion implies that knuckle-walking evolved from an arboreal ancestor as a solution for terrestrial travel, while still maintaining competent climbing skills. It is important to note that not all features associated with knuckle-walking are identical to the beings who practice it, as it suggests possible developmental differences. For example, brachiation and suspension are almost certainly homologous between siamangs and gibbons, yet they differ substantially in the relative growth of their locomotor skeletons. Differences in carpal growth are not necessarily a consequence of their function, as it could be related to differences in body mass, growth, etc. It is important to keep this in mind when examining similarities and differences between African apes themselves, as well as knuckle-walkers and humans, when developing hypotheses on locomotive evolution. Human evolution One theory of the origins of human bipedality is that it evolved from a terrestrial knuckle-walking ancestor. This theory is opposed to the theory that such bipedalism arose from a more generalized arboreal ape ancestor. The terrestrial knuckle-walking theory argues that early hominin wrist and hand bones retain morphological evidence of early knuckle-walking. The argument is not that they were knuckle-walkers themselves but that it is an example of \\"phylogenetic 'lag'\\". \\"The retention of knuckle-walking morphology in the earliest hominids indicates that bipedalism evolved from an ancestor already adapted for terrestrial locomotion. ... Pre-bipedal locomotion is probably best characterized as a repertoire consisting of terrestrial knuckle-walking, arboreal climbing and occasional suspensory activities, not unlike that observed in chimpanzees today\\". See Vestigiality. Crucial to the knuckle-walking ancestor hypothesis is the role of the os centrale in the hominoid wrist, since the fusion of this bone with the scaphoid is among the clearest morphological synapomorphies of hominins and African apes. It has been shown that fused scaphoid-centrales display lower stress values during simulated knuckle-walking as compared to non-fused morphologies, hence supporting a biomechanical explanation for the fusion as a functional adaptation to this locomotor behavior. This suggests that this wrist morphology was probably retained from an last common ancestor that showed knuckle-walking as part of its locomotor repertoire and that was probably later exapted for other functions (e.g. to withstand the shear stress during power-grip positions). Nevertheless, it is relevant to keep in mind that extant knuckle-walkers display diverse positional behaviors, and that knuckle-walking does not preclude climbing or exclude the possible importance of arboreality in the evolution of bipedalism in the hominin lineage. It has however been suggested that knuckle-walking evolved independently and separately in Pan and gorillas and so was not present in the human ancestors. This is supported by the evidence that gorillas and chimpanzees differ in their knuckle-walking related wrist anatomy and in the biomechanics of their knuckle-walking. Kivell and Schmitt note \\"Features found in the hominin fossil record that have traditionally been associated with a broad definition of knuckle-walking are more likely reflecting the habitual Pan-like use of extended wrist postures that are particularly advantageous in an arboreal environment. This, in turn, suggests that human bipedality evolved from a more arboreal ancestor occupying a generalized locomotor and ecological niche common to all living apes\\". Arguments for the independent evolution of knuckle-walking have not gone without criticism, however. A more recent study of morphological integration in human and great ape wrists suggests that knuckle-walking did not evolve independently in gorillas and chimpanzees, which \\"places the emergence of hominins and the evolution of bipedalism in the context of a knuckle-walking background.\\" Related forms of hand-walking Primates can walk on their hands in other ways than on their knuckles. They can walk on fists such as orangutans. In this body weight is borne on the back of the proximal phalanges. Quadrupedal primate walking can be done on the palms. This occurs in many primates when walking on all fours on tree branches. It is also the method used by human infants when crawling on their knees or engaged in a \\"bear-crawl\\" (in which the legs are fully extended and weight is taken by the ankles). A few older children and some adults retain the ability to walk quadrupedally, even after acquiring bipedalism. A BBC2 and NOVA in The Family That Walks on All Fours reported on the Ulas family in which five individuals grew up walking normally upon the palms of their hands and fully extended legs due to a recessive genetic mutation that causes a non- progressive congenital cerebellar ataxia that impairs the balance needed for bipedality.Humphrey, N., Keynes, R. & Skoyles, J. R. (2005). \\"Hand-walkers : five siblings who never stood up\\". Discussion Paper. Centre for Philosophy of Natural and Social Science, London, UK. Not only did they walk on their palms of their hands but could do so holding objects in their fingers. Primates can also walk on their fingers. In olive baboons, rhesus macaques, and patas monkeys such finger walking turns to palm walking when animals start to run. This has been suggested to spread the forces better across the wrist bones to protect them.

The name small whitethroat has also been used by some authors, and desert lesser whitethroat before it was split from lesser whitethroat. Description It is distinguished from Hume's and lesser whitethroats by its smaller size (12 cm length, 8‚Äì13 g weight), smaller bill, the uniformly paler grey head lacking the well-marked dark cheeks of Hume's and lesser whitethroats, and a lighter grey-brown back; in these differences it follows Gloger's rule of pale colour in arid regions. The throat is white, and the rest of the underparts pale greyish-white. Taxonomy Three subspecies are currently recognised,IOC World Bird List though some authors only accept the first two as distinct. * Curruca minula (syn. S. m. chuancheica). Western half of the species' range. * Curruca jaxartica (included in S. m. minula by some authors). Central part of the species' range. * Curruca minula margelanica. Eastern half of the species' range. The presumed lesser whitethroat subspecies halimodendri and telengitica might actually belong to the desert whitethroat, or alternatively might represent hybrid intergrades between, respectively, C. m. jaxartica and C. m. margelanica and the lesser whitethroat.Snow, D. W., Perrins, C. M., Doherty, P., & Cramp, S. (1998). The complete birds of the western Palaearctic on CD- ROM. Oxford University Press. Range and migration Desert whitethroat inhabits arid lowland regions from eastern Iran and Turkmenistan eastwards to Xinjiang in central China, breeding in open dry thorn scrub. The breeding range does not overlap with lesser whitethroat, occurring to the southeast of that; it does overlap geographically with Hume's whitethroat but is separated altitudinally. The desert whitethroat migrates south to the Arabian Peninsula, southern Pakistan and northwestern India in the winter, where it does overlap with wintering lesser whitethroat in many areas, and more locally with wintering Hume's whitethroat. Vagrant is Sri Lanka, recorded in single time.

A particle-beam weapon is a type of directed-energy weapon, which directs energy in a particular and focused direction using particles with minuscule mass. Some particle-beam weapons have potential practical applications, e.g. as an antiballistic missile defense system for the United States and its cancelled Strategic Defense Initiative. They have been known by myriad names: phasers, disruptors, particle accelerator guns, ion cannons, proton beams, lightning rays, rayguns, etc. The concept of particle-beam weapons comes from sound scientific principles and experiments currently underway around the world. One effective process to cause damage to or destroy a target is to simply overheat it until it is no longer operational. However, after decades of R&D;, particle-beam weapons are still very much at the research stage and it remains to be seen if or when they will be deployed as practical, high-performance military weapons. Particle accelerators are a well-developed technology used in scientific research for decades. They use electromagnetic fields to accelerate and direct charged particles along a predetermined path, and electrostatic \\"lenses\\" to focus these streams for collisions. The cathode ray tube in many twentieth-century televisions and computer monitors is a very simple type of particle accelerator. More powerful versions include synchrotrons and cyclotrons used in nuclear research. A particle-beam weapon is a weaponized version of this technology. It accelerates charged particles (in most cases electrons, positrons, protons, or ionized atoms, but very advanced versions can accelerate other particles such as mercury nuclei) to near-light speed and then shoots them at a target. These particles have tremendous kinetic energy which they impart to matter in the target, inducing near-instantaneous and catastrophic superheating at the surface, and when penetrating deeper, ionization effects which can be especially detrimental to electronics in the target. However, high-power accelerators are extremely massive (sometimes in the order of kilometers, like the LHC), with highly constricted construction, operation and maintenance requirements, and thus unable to be weaponized using present or near-future technologies. Beam generation Charged particle beams diverge rapidly due to mutual repulsion, so neutral particle beams are more commonly proposed. A neutral-particle-beam weapon ionizes atoms by either stripping an electron off of each atom, or by allowing each atom to capture an extra electron. The charged particles are then accelerated, and neutralized again by adding or removing electrons afterwards. Cyclotron particle accelerators, linear particle accelerators, and Synchrotron particle accelerators can accelerate positively charged hydrogen ions until their velocity approaches the speed of light, and each individual ion has a kinetic energy range of 100 MeV to 1000 MeV or more. Then the resulting high energy protons can capture electrons from electron emitter electrodes, and be thus electrically neutralized. This creates an electrically neutral beam of high energy hydrogen atoms, that can proceed in a straight line at near the speed of light to smash into its target and damage it. The pulsed particle beam emitted by such a weapon may contain 1 gigajoule of kinetic energy or more. The speed of a beam approaching that of light (299,792,458 m/s in a vacuum) in combination with the energy created by the weapon was thought to negate any realistic means of defending a target against the beam. Target hardening through shielding or materials selection was thought to be impractical or ineffective in 1984,. especially if the beam could be maintained at full power and precisely focused on the target.. Experiments The U.S. Defense Strategic Defense Initiative put into development the technology of a neutral particle beam to be used as a weapon in outer space. Neutral beam accelerator technology was developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory. A prototype neutral hydrogen beam weapon was launched aboard a suborbital sounding rocket from White Sands Missile Range in July 1989 as part of the Beam Experiments Aboard Rocket (BEAR) project. It reached a maximum altitude of 124 miles, and successfully operated in space for 4 minutes before returning to earth intact. In 2006, the recovered experimental device was transferred from Los Alamos to the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC.

It runs roughly north-south between Bourke Street and Little Lonsdale Street in the city centre. It changes name to Hardware Street between Lonsdale and Little Lonsdale Streets. The lane is famous for its numerous restaurants and caf√©s, though also features hairdressers, fast food restaurants and retail shops. Hardware lane is a thriving example of Melbourne's famous laneway culture, with a distinctly European feeling and unique red brick paving. The lane is closed to traffic between 11am-11pm and occasionally features nighttime live jazz performances. History Hardware Lane From 1857, the lane was known as Wrights Lane. In 1927 it was renamed Hardware Lane after Hardware House. The lane is on land formerly occupied by Kirk's Horse Bazaar, a horse and livery trading centre built in 1840 by James Bowie Kirk. In 1895, Wrights Lane (as it was then known) was also home to several hotels. The Kirks Bazaar Hotel, which was first occupied in 1866, was located on the eastern corner of Little Bourke, whilst the adjacent corner featured the Governor Arthur Hotel. The Shamrock Hotel was situated at the opposite end of the lane, on the intersection with Lonsdale Street. There are no functioning hotels that remain on the modern Hardware Lane. Dynon's Building at 63-73 Hardware Lane is a set of four warehouses designed by William Pitt, the designer of some of the finest gothic revival buildings in the city, including the Princess Theatre.

The station is currently owned by Beasley Media Group. WRIF is a grandfathered FM station, Under current U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) limits for Class B stations, WRIF would be allowed to broadcast an effective radiated power (ERP) of at most 16,000 watts using an antenna 268 meters high. The station transmitter is in the Detroit suburb of Southfield near the intersection of 10 Mile Road and Northwestern Highway, and transmits its signal from the same tower as WXYZ-TV. WRIF's studios are in Ferndale. History =WXYZ-FM= 101.1 FM signed on in 1948 as WXYZ-FM. For most of the station's early years, the station was simply a simulcast of WXYZ AM 1270 (now WXYT AM). That changed in 1966, when the FCC decreed separate programming for at least half of the broadcast day on FM stations that had been simulcasts of their AM sisters. WXYZ-FM separated programming and aired first a MOR/adult standards format, then later went to a rock-based Top 40 approach called \\"Boss 101,\\" which featured mostly harder rock hits with little to no pop or soul product. Then in 1970, the station's then-owner, ABC made WXYZ-FM an affiliate of the \\"Love\\" network, a nationally syndicated underground rock format from ABC that predated today's satellite- fed radio formats (another \\"Love\\" affiliate was sister WLS-FM in Chicago). WXYZ-FM hired at least one local jock for this format - Arthur Penhallow. =101 WRIF= On February 14, 1971, the station changed its call letters to WRIF. ABC had applied for WDAI (for Detroit Auto Industry) for WXYZ- FM,http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC- IDX/70-OCR/BC-1970-09-21-Page-0064.pdf but the FCC assigned those to WLS-FM instead. The WRIF calls had been requested for WABC-FM in New York. Under the aegis of consultant Lee Abrams, WRIF was a pioneer in the album-oriented rock format,http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC- IDX/70-OCR/BC-1970-08-10-Page-0045.pdf utilizing many elements of progressive rock radio while maintaining a tight, Top-40 style play list. Other ABC stations with a similar sound included WPLJ in New York and WDVE in Pittsburgh. WRIF was not a pure rocker in its early years - you could hear such artists as KC & The Sunshine Band and the Bee Gees alongside Alice Cooper, Traffic, and the Allman Brothers. After 1975, WRIF dropped most of the pop artists to concentrate on rock, but they would play a pop or disco song if it were extremely popular. \\"Stayin' Alive,\\" for example, got many spins on WRIF in 1977-78. The 1980s are considered the decade in which there was the most change in the Detroit radio dial. Among other changes, a new rocker was installed on 98.7 FM, WLLZ \\"Detroits Wheels\\", and it proved so popular that it took out two other Detroit rock stations. WWWW went country in 1980, and WABX changed to a Contemporary Hit Radio (CHR) format called \\"Hot Rock\\" in 1983, and then went adult contemporary as WCLS. But WRIF soldiered on, even though it was sold twice in the 1980s and its rock format was on the chopping block more than once (rumors persisted in the late 1980s that the station was to switch to an urban contemporary format, especially after the debut of classic rock WCSX in 1987). In May 2006, WRIF outlasted yet another rock station but with a twist. 106.7 \\"The Drive\\" switched to country (this time as \\"106.7 The Fox\\") just as it did back in 1980 when it was known as \\"W4\\". WRIF was 1 out of the 4 radio stations (along with WMXD, WMUZ and WJZZ) in the Barden, MI area that was used on Barden Cablevision's character generated line-up throughout the 1980s and 1990s. The station served as a backdrop for the Kevin Costner film The Upside of Anger. ABC continued to own WRIF until its merger with Capital Cities Communications in 1986. At that time, the station was spun off to Silver Star Communications. The next year, WRIF was sold to Great American Broadcasting (the former Taft Television and Radio, Inc.). Great American Broadcasting declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1993, and subsequently reorganized as Citicasters Communications. In the early 1990s, the FCC began to permit one entity to own two stations on the same band in the same market for the first time. As a result, in 1994, Greater Media, who already owned Detroit's classic rocker WCSX, purchased WRIF from Citicasters. On July 19, 2016, Beasley Media Group announced it would acquire Greater Media and its 21 stations (including WRIF) for $240 million. The FCC approved the sale on October 6, and the sale closed on November 1. Standings and recognition In 2007, the station was named Active Rock station of the year in a top 25 market award by Radio & Records magazine. Other nominees included WIYY in Baltimore, WAAF in Boston, KBPI in Denver, WMMR in Philadelphia, and KISW in Seattle. WRIF won the RadioContraband Rock Radio Award for \\"Major Market Radio Station\\" of the year in 2013 and 2014. WRIF was inducted into the Rock Radio Hall of Fame in 2014. Programming =HD channel= WRIF's HD Radio multicast signals are called: *HD1 is a simulcast of the analog (traditional) signal.http://www.hdradio.com/station_guides/widget.php?id=10 HD Radio Guide for Detroit *HD2 (\\"RIFF2\\") features a modern spin on the old progressive-rock format, with a mixture of underground alternative rock and metal and local Detroit artists. This was launched in August 2005. *HD3 features highlights of the Dave and Chuck \\"The Freak\\" morning show. =Morning shows= From the mid-1970s to 1979, the morning show had been hosted by Michael Collins. In 1979, WRIF began broadcasting J.J. and the Morning Crew which consisted of Jimmy \\"J.J.\\" Johnson, Lynne Woodison, and George Baier (better known as Richard T. Bruiser or Dick the Bruiser). In their prime, they were well known with doing news, weather, playing rock, and creating parody songs with their own versions of timeless rock hits such as Question Mark and the Mysterians' \\"96 Tears\\" with \\"96 Beers\\", The J. Geils Band's \\"Freeze Frame\\" with \\"Beer Frame\\", Sammy Hagar's \\"I Can't Drive 55\\" with \\"I Can't Drive 25\\", and their own version of Gary Numan's \\"Cars\\" with \\"Bars\\". The show is also known for lampooning NBC's longest running show, Meet the Press with Meet the Bruiser. But despite WRIF's playing rock and disco songs, J.J. and the Morning Crew created \\"D.R.E.A.D.\\" which is short for \\"Detroit Rockers Engaged In The Abolition of Disco\\". J.J. and the Morning Crew left WRIF in the mid-1980s and moved their morning show to the now defunct WLLZ. (In the mid 1990s, J.J. and the Morning Crew moved to WRIF's soon to be sister station WCSX). J.J. now hosts middays at WOMC. In November 1985, Joe Nipote (an actor, children's author and Detroit native) became WRIF's new morning show host. Never having worked with a partner before, Nipote was teamed up with then-midday host Ken Calvert. Within a year, Nipote and Calvert did very well ratings wise. However, after a year, Nipote left to return to Los Angeles, and returned to stand up and acting. In 1991, WRIF hired a new morning team from Phoenix, Arizona - Drew & Zip. Zip left by 1994, and was replaced by local personality Mike Clark. Drew and Mike went on to become the #1 rated morning show in Detroit. In September 2007, Drew Lane left WRIF for an indefinite length of time to take care of his girlfriend who had been diagnosed with breast cancer. In April 2008, it was announced that Lane would not be returning to WRIF. The show was then renamed \\"Mike In The Morning\\" and was hosted by Clark and Marc Fellhauer, and features Trudi Daniels with the \\"WRIF Rock & Roll Radio News,\\" and Jamie Samuelsen on sports reports. On July 13, 2009, Lane returned to WRIF to once again team up with Mike Clark. The show's name reverted to Drew and Mike in the Morning, sometimes referred to as The Drew and Mike Show, but is mostly just shortened to Drew and Mike. Lane now does sports news for the show as well. Fellhauer, Daniels, and Mike Wolters still remain with the show. In May 2013, it was announced that Greater Media had not renewed the contract for Drew and Mike in the Morning, with the final Drew and Mike show airing on May 17. On May 28, Dave and Chuck \\"The Freak\\" of 89X took over morning drive. Since then, Trudi Daniels teamed up with WRIF alum Kenny \\"K.C.\\" Calvert to form The K.C. and Trudi Morning Show which made its debut on WCSX that summer, while Drew Lane moved to afternoons on sister station WMGC-FM in August 2013. Since his departure from terrestrial radio, Drew Lane has cobbled himself a nice living with podcasting. Merchandise =Stickers= WRIF stickers are given out at many of the station's sponsored events. Many are unique to that event. Stickers have been made for bands including: Metallica, Ozzy Osbourne and OZZFEST, M√∂tley Cr√ºe, ZZ Top, Alice Cooper, Kid Rock, Disturbed, YES, Journey, KISS, Santana, REO Speedwagon, Triumph, U2, Huey Lewis and the News, Loverboy, Aerosmith, Bruce Springsteen, the Rolling Stones, Iggy Pop, Guns N' Roses, AC/DC, Korn, Linkin Park, Velvet Revolver, The Romantics and David Bowie. WRIF has also made stickers for appearances by comedians George Carlin & Rodney Dangerfield and the rock festival Lollapalooza. Stickers have also been made for non-concert events such as the Drew and Mike radio show, Harleyfest, legendary WRIF alum Arthur Penhallow and his famous saying \\"Baby!\\", as well as the major Detroit sports teams - the Detroit Pistons, Tigers, Red Wings, and Lions. Since nearly all of them are the same basic size and design (an oval with flat top and bottom with the same size border ring), they are highly collectable. Since 1971, over 700 different stickers have been made. Due to complaints of vandalism, WRIF has switched from stickers to window clings.

It is syndicated across the country by United Stations Radio Networks and internationally via Radio Express. Twenty featured songs from a particular month ‚Äî alternating between 1970s and 1980s from week to week ‚Äî are featured and played countdown-style, from No. 20 to No. 1. The Billboard Hot 100 chart is the standard for this ranking. Dick Bartley's Classic Hits is based upon two previous oldies programs Bartley hosted, the countdown series Classic Countdown (previously known as American Gold) and the live request series Rock and Roll's Greatest Hits. In July 2017, the programs were combined, taking on its current name.\\"Dick Bartley's Classic Hits,. Accessed 07-01-2017. The program is pre-recorded (Rock & Roll's Greatest Hits, while live for most of its run, had transitioned to being pre-recorded shortly after joining United Stations). History =As American Gold= Though Bartley had hosted Rock & Roll's Greatest Hits since 1980 (a show that would be carried under various titles nationwide beginning in 1982, first with an earlier version of United Stations, then through the original Westwood One beginning in 1985), it was not until June 8, 1991, when he joined ABC Radio Networks, that he launched a countdown show. It was originally named American Gold. The concept of American Gold was loosely based upon the formats of other ABC shows, American Top 40 and American Country Countdown, except charts from a particular month or week from years' past were used. Differences between American Gold and the Classic Countdown were as follows: * One part of the show focused on the hits of a particular three-month time span (e.g., fall of 1965 or winter of 1969-1970), while the other focused on an artist or band, stylistic trend or other theme, with their featured songs focusing generally from the era the oldies format in general came from. (For instance, if the Bee Gees were the spotlight artist on an early 1990s American Gold show, it was likely their late-1960s and early-1970s hit recordings were played rather than songs from the disco/Saturday Night Fever-phase of their career (as the late 1970s was not considered part of the oldies format at the time; such songs would instead be played on Bartley's 70s/80s program Yesterday Live), whereas an artist spotlight on the brothers Gibb from late in the run would emphasize their late-1970s disco output, in addition to their earlier material.) * Like the current Classic Countdown, the show's playlist focused on the oldies format's focus of the time -- to mean, late 1950s through early 1970s with an emphasis on the 1960s during the early years, before drifting to the 1964-late 1970s era during the 2000s, with scattered 1980s titles by the end of the run. * Prior to about 2007, \\"The Quiz Man\\" call-in contest allowed listeners to win prizes by answering a trivia question or identifying a one-hit wonder song. This feature did not carry over to the Classic Countdown. * American Gold and Rock & Roll's Greatest Hits would semi-regularly record episodes at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida after The Walt Disney Company bought ABC in 1996. In 2017, the new Classic Hits program used the American Gold format, only this time focusing on music of the 1970s and 1980s (with increasing early 1990s music included by the late 2010s). Bartley announced his departure from ABC effective March 31, 2009. His last American Gold show, a 1975 Yearbook, was released to stations March 28, and relaunched the weekend of April 1 by the United Stations Radio Networks under its current name. WestwoodOne, who acquired ABC's radio assets in 2013, likely still holds rights to the \\"American Gold\\" name, which originates with ABC's former subsidiary Watermark Inc.. =As the Classic Countdown= The Classic Countdown focused on the 20 biggest hits of the current month from a particular year in the past. The year range during the mid-2010s was 1970-1987. As with American Gold's countdowns of past years, Bartley would announce headlines, pop culture trends (such as styles, popular movies and TV shows, etc.) from that particular month. Music from the 1970s and 1980s fills out the playlist. When the show debuted, the three-month time window (e.g., spring of a given year), carried over from American Gold, was still being used, with the range of feature years roughly from the late 1960s to early 1980s, with the monthly format beginning in the early 2010s. During both eras, four weeks out of the year focus on seasonal music. These include \\"Summer Classics\\" (songs with the word \\"summer\\" or having summertime themes, aired Memorial Day weekend); \\"Halloween Classics\\" (the weekend nearest Oct. 31); \\"Christmas and Holiday Favorites\\" (the weekend nearest Dec. 25); and \\"All-Time Greatest Hits\\" (focusing on the biggest charting/\\"A-list\\" hits of the oldies/classic hits format's focus of the time, aired the weekend nearest Jan. 1). The final episode, a countdown of the top hits of June 1984, was aired June 24, 2017; the new Dick Bartley's Classic Hits began airing a week later, with a dual spotlight on the hits of July 1976 and the Class of 1981. When the program ended, it was featuring songs that had not yet been recorded when the show began. =WCBS Sunday Night Countdown= In addition to this national show, a local Sunday Night Countdown aired for several years on WCBS-FM. The WCBS version of the show featured two top-20 (or so) lists, one of which often matched the syndicated top-20 list and spotlighted a year from the 1970s, matching it with a corresponding 10 years later, although 1978 and 1979 were matched with 1968 and 1969, respectively. For example, if the first two hours are from January 1976, then the second two hours was from January 1986. The WCBS version of the show ended on 28 September 2014.

He is noted for his efforts at removing from Japanese textbooks accounts of wartime atrocities committed by Japan during the Second World War. He is considered to be a conservative and a nationalist, and has been quoted as saying that he \\"stand(s) for a viewpoint of history with an emphasis on national interest,\\" and that the study of Japanese history is \\"subject to the ultimate moral imperative of whether or not it serves to inculcate a sense of pride in being Japanese.\\" He has also said that to \\"write [a history] based only on verified historical truths makes...[it] insipid and dry. I had no choice but to write from my own imagination to a great extent.\\" In the early 1990s, Fujioka founded the so-called Liberal View of History Study Group, which advocated \\"correcting history\\" by promoting a \\"positive view\\" of Japanese history, and removing all references to what he referred to as \\"dark history.\\" By 1995, he had created the Association for Advancement of Unbiased View of History (Jiyuu-Shugi-Shikan Kenkyuu-Kai) and the Committee to Write New History Textbooks. Among Japan's top ten bestsellers in 1997 were two volumes edited by Fujioka, History The Textbooks Do Not Teach and Shameful Modern History. By early 2000, Fujioka and his followers had joined with others to form the Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform (Tsukurukai, now headed by Nishio Kanji). This group authored The New History Textbook, which was one of eight junior high school history textbooks authorized by the Ministry of Education in April 2001. In December 2000, a draft textbook circulated by the Society and shown on national television elicited criticism by many Japanese historians and teachers. Fujioka's textbook revisionist movement has created considerable controversy in China, especially concerning denial of the Rape of Nanking; and in South Korea and the Philippines, especially concerning denial of Japanese responsibility for the so-called \\"comfort women\\". He is an assenter of the film The Truth about Nanjing.

Mak) is Uganda's largest and oldest institution of higher learning, first established as a technical school in 1922. It became an independent national university in 1970. Today, Makerere University is composed of nine colleges and one school offering programmes for about 36,000 undergraduates and 4,000 postgraduate. It recently was gutted by fire in September of 2020 and the cause of the fire is yet to be established U.S. News & World Report has ranked Makerere University as the eighth best university in Africa and the 569th best university worldwide. In the 2020 U.S. News & World Report ranking, Makerere is the highest-ranked university in sub-Saharan Africa outside of South Africa. The Times Higher Education World University Rankings for 2016 ranked it as the fourth best university in Africa.https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/africa Makerere University was alma mater to many post-independence African leaders, including Ugandan president Milton Obote and Tanzanian presidents Julius Nyerere and Benjamin Mkapa. The former president of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Joseph Kabila, and Kenyan president Mwai Kibaki are also Makerere alumni. In the years immediately after Uganda's independence, Makerere University was a focal point for the literary activity that was central to African nationalist culture. Many prominent writers, including Nuruddin Farah, Ali Mazrui, David Rubadiri, Okello Oculi, Ng≈©gƒ© wa Thiong'o, John Ruganda, Paul Theroux, Nobel Prize laureate V. S. Naipaul, and Peter Nazareth, were at Makerere University at one point in their writing and academic careers. Because of student unrest and faculty disenchantment, the university was closed three times between 2006 and 2016. The final time was on 1 November 2016 when President Yoweri Museveni declared it closed indefinitely. The university was reopened in January 2017. History =Founding of the technical school= The trade school that became Makerere University began operating in 1921 with the first classes in carpentry, building construction and mechanics. In 1922 it was founded as the \\"Uganda Technical College\\" with additional courses in the arts, education, agriculture and medicine. That same year it was again renamed as Makerere College. In 1928, the vocational classes were separated from the college and renamed Kampala Technical School. In 1937 the college began offering post-secondary education certificate courses. =University= In 1943, the British Protectorate government proposed the university, which led to a controversial struggle. It was described as \\"a plot to steal African soil for European settlement,\\" by the Bataka Party. In response to this campaign, there was rioting in the capital of Kampala. Department of Chemistry, CONAS 2018; Taken by: Gyagenda Marvin Paul In 1949 Makerere College was granted university status and its name became Makerere College, University of East Africa., originally published in 2006, In the same year, the Bataka Party had been banned by the British Protectorate government, because of acts of riot and arson committed after a Bataka protest gathering. Faculty of Information Technology Building, Makerere University =Unrest in the 2000s= The university was closed three times between 2006 and 2016. Beginning on 1 August 2016, the non-teaching staff went on strike demanding their back pay. The strike lasted three weeks and the government agreed to pay them by the end of October; however, the government failed to do so. This was but one more broken promise in the cycle of failed promises, strikes and more promises. That strike was followed by a strike of the lecturers over unpaid incentive pay, and that strike was joined by students in solidarity. This led to President Yoweri Museveni closing the university \\"indefinitely\\". Additional protests, including from parents whose children were left hanging in mid-semester, led to Museveni appointing a special commission to try to rectify the situation but with no promises of reopening. The commission's report is due in late February 2017. On the 20th of September, 2020, the main building of Makerere University ( the Ivory Tower) was burnt up in flames allegedly following a probe by Uganda Parliament into a 26 Billion embezzlement by university authorities.

Schiller collaborated with the following Warsaw theatres: * Teatr Wielki (Great Theater) * Teatr Rozmaito≈õci (Variety Theater in Warsaw) * Teatr Ma≈Çy (Little Theater) * Teatr Polski (Polish Theater) * Teatr Reduta (Redoubt Theater) * Teatr Ateneum (Ateneum Theatre). He also collaborated with theaters in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ and Lw√≥w (now Lviv). From 1930 to 1932, he was artistic and drama director of Warsaw's Wielki (Great), Rozmaito≈õci (Variety), and Ma≈Çy (Little) Theaters. In Lw√≥w he developed his own concept of \\"monumental theatre,\\" pertaining to the production of great Romantic works: Kordian (1930), Dziady (Forefathers' Eve, 1932) and Sen Srebrny Salomei (Salomea's Silver Dream, 1932). Schiller's connection with Lw√≥w lasted sporadically until 1939. His directorial work included 29 dramas and some dozen vaudeville and operetta productions. In 1933 he headed the directorial department at the National Theater Arts Institute. On 29 June 1908 Schiller initiated a correspondence with the English actor, theater director, scenic designer, and theoretician of drama, Edward Gordon Craig. Together with his letter Schiller sent Craig, in Florence, his essay, \\"Dwa teatry\\" (\\"Two Theaters\\"), translated into English by Madeline Meager. Craig responded immediately, accepting the essay for his international theater magazine, The Mask.Jerzy Timoszewicz, \\"Ma≈Ça kronika ≈ºycia i tw√≥rczo≈õci Leona Schillera, 1887‚Äì1924\\" (\\"A Brief Chronicle of the Life and Works of Leon Schiller\\"), in Leon Schiller, Na progu nowego teatru, 1908‚Äì1924 (On the Threshold of the New Theater, 1908‚Äì1924), edited by Jerzy Timoszewicz, Warsaw, Pa≈Ñstwowy Instytut Wydawniczy, 1978, p. 9.

It was established in 1994 as part of a group of schools and colleges that originally grew from a kindergarten established in 1951. The university is dedicated to the promotion of excellence in applied business education. The university builds students on the 4Cs: Creativity, Confidence, Competence and Character. The university is not affiliated with any particular religious organization, but it accommodates several religious associations, which allow the students to fellowship along religious beliefs and to devote adequate time to God. Location The university campus is located on Nkumba Hill in Wakiso District, approximately , by road, north-east of Entebbe International Airport, along the northern shores of Lake Victoria, the second-largest freshwater body in the world. The coordinates of the university campus are 0¬∞05'42.0\\"N, 32¬∞30'27.0\\"E (Latitude:0.095000; Longitude:32.507500). Overview The university is one of the largest private universities in East Africa. As of December 2011, the student body exceeded 7,000, with over 300 academic staff. The university offers courses leading to certificates, diplomas, baccalaureate degrees as well as postgraduate academic qualifications. At its graduation ceremony in October 2013, 1,700 students were awarded certificates, diplomas, and degrees at a function, presided over by university Chancellor, Gordon Wavamunno. The university was one of the first universities in the country to introduce the Bachelor of Science degree in petroleum studies, mineral management, and technology. The inaugural intake occurred in 2011. A master's degree in the same field is in development. History On 29 July 1951, Ssalongo Kintu a local merchant, invited two of his best friends to a meeting: Charles Kisitu Ffulu, the then Parish Chief of Nkumba, and Zefania Mpanga, a civil servant who resided in the area. Their meeting led to the establishment of a kindergarten for their infants. The school opened on 6 February 1952 with twelve pupils at Ffulu's home. Within two years, the student population had grown to over 150. The kindergarten grew into a primary (elementary) school. Over the years, the school grew into a junior secondary (middle) school and a senior secondary (high) school. In 1969, the school became a vocational school. In 1974, the name of the school was changed to the Nkumba College of Commerce and Advanced Studies. Finally in 1994, the board of trustees were approved by the Ministry of Education to transform the college into a university. This marked the beginning of Nkumba University. On 16 February 2007, Nkumba University was granted a charter by the president of Uganda upon the recommendation of the National Council for Higher Education as provided in the Universities and Other Tertiary Institutions Act 2001. Academic Affairs The academic affairs of Nkumba University are organized under six constituent schools of the university. * School of Business Administration and Information Technology * School of Education, Humanities and Sciences * School of Social Sciences * School of Law and Institute of Criminal Justice * School of Industrial, Commercial Art and Design * School of Sciences. Notable alumni * Doreen Amule - Ugandan politician. * Katumba Wamala - Ugandan military officer. Current Ugandan Minister of Works and Transport.

These prefixes are one to three letters long with the first letter usually refer to the former company. For instance, prefixes beginning with \\"S\\" were part of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad. Some of these company prefixes include the following: * Former Atlantic Coast Line Railroad lines begin with \\"A\\" * Former Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O;) lines begin with \\"B\\" * Former Conrail (New York Central/Penn Central) lines begin with \\"Q\\" * Former Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O;) lines begin with \\"C\\" * Former Clinchfield Railroad lines begin with \\"Z\\" * Former Georgia Railroad lines begin with \\"Y\\" * Former Louisville and Nashville Railroad lines begin with \\"0\\" (zero) * Former Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad lines are designated \\"PLE\\", \\"PLY\\", and \\"PLM\\" * Former Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad lines are designated \\"CFP\\" (on the former main) and \\"CFQ\\" (Dahlgren Branch) * Former Seaboard Air Line Railroad lines begin with \\"S\\" Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Lines that were formerly part of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad system are given milepost prefixes beginning with the letter A. For instance, milepost A790 is on the main line in Orlando, Florida, 1000 miles south of the beginning in Richmond, Virginia, and milepost AN587 is in Waycross, Georgia, 587 miles south of Richmond on the branch to Montgomery, Alabama (which splits near milepost 548 in Jesup). Three-letter prefixes are used for minor branches of these branches, or minor branches off the mainline - for instance ANA is the northernmost branch of AN. Before the ACL merged into the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad in 1967, none of the prefixes had the initial \\"A\\". The letters \\"I\\" and \\"Q\\" were skipped, and double-lettered prefixes (like KK, which would be AKK post-1967) were not used. A is given to the main line from Richmond, Virginia to Port of Tampa, Florida. It has been pieced together from many sections of original main lines and newer connections; the full line is still in use by CSX. *Richmond and Petersburg Railroad, Manchester, Virginia to Petersburg, Virginia (A23) *Petersburg Railroad, Petersburg to Weldon, North Carolina (A85) *Wilmington and Weldon Railroad, Weldon to Wilson, North Carolina (A139) *Wilson and Fayetteville Railroad, Wilson to North Carolina/South Carolina state line (A255) *Florence Railroad, state line to Pee Dee, South Carolina (A283) *Wilmington and Manchester Railroad, Pee Dee to Florence, South Carolina (A293) *Northeastern Railroad, Florence to Charleston, South Carolina (A388) *Predecessors of the Plant System: **Ashley River Railroad, around Charleston (A388-392) **Charleston and Savannah Railroad, Charleston to Savannah, Georgia (A491) **Atlantic and Gulf Railroad, Savannah to Jesup, Georgia (A548) **Folkston Cutoff, Jesup to Folkston, Georgia (A602) **Waycross and Florida Railroad, Folkston to Georgia/Florida state line (A606) **East Florida Railway, state line to Jacksonville, Florida (A643) **Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railway, Jacksonville to Sanford, Florida (A766) **South Florida Railroad, Sanford to Tampa, Florida (A890) AA is the northernmost spur, running from A89/AA89 at Halifax, North Carolina southeast and south to AA178 in Kinston, North Carolina.

The first novel in the series had earlier been made into a film for television in 1981. It starred Bernard Cribbins and was scripted by Leslie Thomas.  Profile  Davies is a low-ranked CID (mentioned as a detective constable at least once) officer in the London borough of Willesden. He is nicknamed \\"Dangerous\\" ironically because he is said to be harmless. His real first name is never revealed. In the novels and TV series he is called \\"The Last Detective\\" from his superior's assessment of him as \\"the last detective, since he was never dispatched on any assignment unless it was very risky or there was no one else to send\\". Despite this, Davies is by no means a poor detective, and although he can take longer than his colleagues, and is dogged by bad luck, he does usually \\"get his man\\" in the end. The first story had him drifting into the years-old unsolved case of the disappearance of Celia Norris, a local girl with a dark side. With his friend, the perpetually unemployed and well-read Mod Lewis (he spends all his time at the library to save on heating) he tracks down the culprit, collecting plenty of cuts, bumps and bruises along the way at the hands of the local thugs. At one point he is \\"binned\\" -- an empty dustbin is placed over his head, pinning his arms, and the outside is then hit with pickaxe handles. Bernard Cribbins played Davies in the first television version of this story, made in 1981. At the end he was swathed in many bandages and confined temporarily to a wheelchair. In his later appearances he has been portrayed by Peter Davison from 2003 to 2007. Much of the appeal of the books and TV series lies in the comical interactions between Davies and the other characters. His kindly manner enables him to gain the confidence of witnesses and suspects, many of whom reveal their eccentricities to him. Other humour comes from his friendship with Mod, and from his relationship with his estranged wife Doris (Julie in the TV series).

The building was designed by John Horton and consists of a centre bay, emphasised by a segmental parapet, which contains trophies by William Hollins. A Jacobean-style gateway was added in 1883. It is a grade II* listed building. The Proof House was established in 1813 by an act of Parliament at the request‚Äîand expense‚Äîof the then prosperous Birmingham Gun Trade. Its remit was to provide a testing and certification service for firearms in order to prove their quality of construction, particularly in terms of the resistance of barrels to explosion under firing conditions. Such testing prior to sale or transfer of firearms is made mandatory by the Gun Barrel Proof Act of 1868, which made it an offence to sell, offer for sale, transfer, export or pawn an unproofed firearm, with certain exceptions for military organisations. The Proof process is that of testing a firearm for integrity using a severely overcharged cartridge, or Proof load which is fired through the gun in an armoured testing chamber. This exposes it to pressures far beyond what it would experience in normal service. It is awarded a stamped Proof Mark if it survives without either being destroyed or suffering damage from the proof load. Larger guns were tested at a shooting range in Bordesley along a railway viaduct; however, the expansion of the city centre resulted in the closure of the shooting range. Proof may be rendered invalid if the firearm is damaged or modified significantly; at this point it is described as \\"out of proof\\" and must be re-proofed before it can be sold or transferred. Note that the correct term for a satisfactorily tested firearm is Proofed, and not Proven. There are penalties for non-compliance with proof laws; a fine of ¬£5,000 may be levied for selling an unproofed or out-of proof firearm, more if a number of firearms are involved in a transaction. Tampering with, or forging, a proof mark is regarded as even more serious. The Proof House still exists today, largely unchanged in both purpose and construction, although it offers a wider range of services including ammunition testing and firearm accident investigation. The building contains a museum of arms and ammunition, and can be visited by prior arrangement.

Management contracts involve not just selling a method of doing things (as with franchising or licensing) but involve actually doing them. A management contract can involve a wide range of functions, such as technical operation and of a production facility, management of personnel, accounting, marketing services and training. In Asia, many hotels operate under management contract arrangements, as they can more easily obtain economies of scale, a global reservation systems, brand recognition etc. It is not unusual for contracts to be signed for 30 years, and having a fee as high as 3.5% of total revenues and 6-10% of gross operating profit. Management contracts have been used to a wide extent in the airline industry, and when foreign government action restricts other entry methods. Management contracts are often formed where there is a lack of local skills to run a project. It is an alternative to foreign direct investment as it does not involve as high risk and can yield higher returns for the company. The first recorded management contract was initiated by Qantas and Duncan Upton in 1978. Difference between management contract and franchising  In business management, franchising is a contractual relationship between franchiser (owner of the company) and franchisee (buyer of a brand name). The franchiser allows the franchisee to use its trademark along with certain business systems and processes in exchange for a fee. Business students usually get confused between the concepts of management contracts and franchising. Although they have much in common, such as they both earn by selling intangibles and are both affiliated with another company, but where a management contract acts as a framework and provides formation and structure to the company and its members, franchisee remains an independent businessman.  Advantages and Disadvantages of Management Contracts  A businessman who owns several companies, cannot distribute his attention amongst every minute detail of his companies. He needs some expert assistance with his work so he can concentrate on more broader aspects. This assistance can be provided by the contract management companies. On hiring such companies, the owner will have more time to concentrate on the expansion of the business rather than day-to-day working of the companies. The businessman can distribute some of his basic responsibilities to these management companies such as recruitment, deployment and retention. There are several companies who cannot reach the peak of success due to lack of expertise in one field or another. Such companies should hire contract management teams. This way they would not just be hiring an experienced employee but an entire team of efficient and experienced employees in technical fields of management, accountancy, marketing etc. Management contracts gives businessman an assurance of the continuity of his business. This can be illustrated through an example. A manager or any employee may terminate his job, leaving the business a hole in its team for the smooth functioning of the operations. A contract management company can easily change few employees without stirring the constancy of the business model. Through management contracts, a businessman can venture international business opportunities without taking a huge risk of putting his own physical assets at stake. For example, the Heathrow Airport Holdings Limited of Britain retains general airport management skills. In the EEUU Heathrow serves the Indianapolis Airport under a 10 years management contract. It also provides retail management at the air mall in the Pittsburgh Airport. Government uses management contracts for the progress and development of the skill of the local managers and workers. They also accolade management contract companies to upgrade and operate public utilities. Entering into a management contracts might lead to difficulties and problems for the business owners. By entering into such agreements businesses are risking their privacy. When a businessman handover his company‚Äôs management to a third party, he may enter into confidential disputes. These contracts makes the business expose to ethical breaches, fraud and public exposer. The information of the other contracts made by the business is also available to the management contract companies. Since there responsibilities ranges from price negotiation to stock control they have full information about the vendors. Management responsibilities includes record of all employees, their personal information and payments procedures. Management contract companies have the information of the business finance also. This puts the business in a vulnerable position. Hiring an outside contractor makes it difficult for the business to foresee the number of conflicts that can occur. For example, businessman hires a contract management company for the operations of the company. The management company may in turn take on the management of the supplier‚Äôs company too. This can lead to several compromises in the discounts, price negotiations and suppliers way of working. There can be even more conflicts even the same management company handles the management of several competitors at same time. International management can be very risky for the management companies. If a country is going through a political or social turmoil, the manager‚Äôs life is put at risk to carry on the business in such a situation.  Some popular types of management contracts  = Hotel management contracts =  Overview  Hotel management contract is a written agreement between the owner and the operator of the hotel. The base of this relationship is that the operator handles the day-to-day working of the hotel and takes up all the additional responsibilities such as maintenance, front office, housekeeping, handling food and beverages and sale. The management contract company has the power to recruit and fire the employees. The owner will authorize and pay for the capital project of the hotel but the responsibility of it is assigned to the operator. The hotel management contracts can be lengthy and complicated. The negotiation of this agreement focusing the power of the owner and the rights of the operator. The initial draft is offered by the prospective operator. It usually is in favor of the operator so that operator can seek a long term contract. It doesn't want any interference from the owner but at the same time wants continuous supply of investment for the expansion and growth of the project.  Purpose of this contract  The main purpose of this agreement is that the investors of some hotels lack the skill and knowledge of operating them. They are mere businessman with good financial status. They lack experience or expertise in such field. Therefore, they need the assistance of such management companies who can get the output of their investment.  Major Elements of the Contract  * Terms and conditions of the agreement * Length and durability of the agreement * Procedure for early termination by either party of the contract * Insurance policies of the hotel and its fixed assets. * Management company ownership or investment required * Contract terms in the event of sale of the hotel * Incentive fees earned or penalties assessed related to operating performance * The exclusivity of the management company * Status of the employees = Construction Management Contracts =  Overview  Construction management contract is between the investor and the builder. This is for use on construction projects. This contract is usually appointed by the client (investor) in the early stage. The relationship between the client and the management contractor usually covers both the work of pre-construction and construction activities. The management contractor is responsible for all the administrative and operational work of the construction project. The investor usually comes in the picture to hire the management contractor and then when the building of the project is complete. The entire work in between these two events is done by the management contractor. The Managing Contractor is responsible for sub-contract claims arising from its own inadequate performance. It the elements to be included in a project, and the design of those elements, with the management expertise of a contractor organization to assist and advise in developing the design, coordinating the interface between design and construction, undertaking the construction and planning for and remaining within a target cost and target time for delivery of the project.  Advantages  Advantages of construction agreements are: * This agreement is most beneficial when little guidance or information is available in the initial stage of the project while the project is complicated and complex. * The management contractor acts as a consultant in the early stage of building. * The investor has to pay a single management team rather than several contractors and workers. * Management contracts fix the price of building the project enabling the investor to calculate its finance and profit * This enables experts to control the design, quality, cost of material used in early stages. * The scope of making the project in accordance to the preference of customers is high... *  Disadvantages  Disadvantages of construction agreements are: * High risk of conflicts between the manager and the investor. * The price is fixed in advance which may change from time due to change economy resulting in conflicts between the investor and manager.

Among the churches in the town are:Comune of Borgomanero Churches and oratories. *San Leonardo - main parish church *Collegiata di San Bartolomeo *Oratory of San Leonardo *Oratory of Santa Caterina *Santa Trinit√† *San Nicola di Baraggiola Borgomanero borders the following municipalities: Bogogno, Briga Novarese, Cressa, Cureggio, Fontaneto d'Agogna, Gargallo, Gattico-Veruno, Gozzano, Invorio, Maggiora. History Legend has it that a group of thirteen people, called the Thirteen Orcs (Tr√∂zz 'Orchi in dialect form), returning from a pilgrimage to the shrine on the nearby island of San Giulio (Lake Orta), founded the first nucleus of the city, on the banks of the Agogna. The same legend also tells the origin of Tapulon, the local traditional dish, created with the poor ingredients that the group had at its disposal: the meat of the only donkey who carried their luggage, wine and little else. The first historical name of Borgomanero is Burgus sancti Leonardi (i.e. Hamlet of Saint Leonard). This name derives from Saint Leonard's church, the most ancient monument in town, which presumably dates back to 1125‚Äì1150. From the \\"paper of Romagnano\\" of 1198, we learn that Burgus sancti Leonardi already enjoyed the status of a free village at the time. The toponym Borgomanero is attributed to Jacob Mainerio (Jacobus de Mayneriis), who was mayor of Novara between 1193 and 1194. Mainerio decided to transform Burgus sancti Leonardi into a military stronghold between the Sesia river and Ticino river, and gave his name to the new military camp (Burgus Maynerium), replacing that of Burgus sancti Leonardi. The construction of the new walled village almost certainly implied dismantling the previous hamlet dedicated to Saint Leonard, and the old church remained outside the walls, perhaps as a cemetery church. The new village was redesigned on the model of the Roman civitas, with two main streets crossing each other at the centre, and side streets creating a regular network of intersections: a pattern that still characterises the historic city centre. The village continued to grow in importance and resisted several sieges in the war between Visconti and Paleologi in the 1300s. Borgomanero lost autonomy when the Dukes of Milan granted it in fief first to the Tornielli family (1412 - 1447) and later to the Trivulzio family (1466 - 1548). In 1449, Borgomanero and its surroundings were the locations of the clash between Louis, Duke of Savoy and Francesco I Sforza, which culminated in the Battle of Borgomanero, won by the Lombard troops led by Bartolomeo Colleoni. Later Borgomanero became a fief of the House of Este for over two hundred years (1552 - 1757). Curiously, Borgomanero was not touched by the plague of the mid-seventeenth century that raged in Europe, because the only four plague victims were expelled from the city and the order was given to close the gates and to isolate the city until the epidemic had died out. This decision (remarkable for the ignorance at the time on infections) saved the town from the plague. During the early nineteenth century, Borgomanero lost its last walls and it became a commercially and economically more modern centre. Borgomanero took an active part in the Italian Risorgimento: the brothers Ercole and Antonio Maioni paid with exile raising the Italian flag in Turin in 1821; Maddalena Zoppis lost an eye during the Five Days of Milan in 1848; Costantino Pagani was one of the volunteers participating in the Expedition of the Thousand led by Giuseppe Garibaldi. Moreover, the city was occupied by the Austrian army in the aftermath of the Battle of Novara (1849). Twentieth-century figures of note include Mora and Gibin, gold medals of the Italian resistance movement, and Achille Marazza, member of the National High Liberation Committee of Italy, who in 1967 donated the villa and library to the town, now home to the foundation that bears his name.

They were first mentioned in writing by Charles Henry Tyler Townsend in 1893. The name Leptoconops carteri is a junior synonym of L. torrens. They are prevalent in the southwestern and southeastern areas of the United States. In early stages of life, L. torrens flies dwell in soil, then emerge to feed and breed as fully developed adults. L. torrens females rely on blood meals from vertebrates for nutrition, while males feed on various plant products such as nectar. L. torrens infestations in California have caused people to take measures to control their populations. The flies are relatively small at around long and are difficult to spot, making preventing L. torrens bites difficult. Construction projects and farming efforts have been temporarily suspended because of L. torrens biting activity. Description  = Larvae = L. torrens larvae have 21 body segments and are long on average. The larva has a transparent body, and mouthparts are visible through the head. These mandibles are heavily chitinized, which differs from those of other species. The antenna retracts into the head with additional chitinized parts, and no eye organs are visible. Male and female larvae are indistinguishable by size. = Adults = Adults are close in appearance to the Bodega black gnat. Adult flies are about long and are black in color. Female flies have 14 antennae segments. The females have relatively stout abdomens, and have no hairs around their eye area. Males also lack hair on the face. Distribution alt= The species can be found from California to Utah, New Mexico, Texas, Mexico, and southeast Florida as well as the Caribbean. They have also been observed in Colorado and Nevada. Their emergences have typically been observed and recorded in California. Habitat L. torrens dwells in places with alkaline clay soil; larvae dwell in the damp soil. Soil with clay composition of more than 40% is the most suitable. Requiring this clay soil limits where L. torrens can populate. When the clay soil dries, cracks are formed to allow for adults to emerge. L. torrens tends to be in areas with cracks less than in width. They are also common in partially aquatic regions around the world, such as tropical and sub-tropical regions. Lifecycle The life cycle of L. torrens is typically around two years. = Egg = A female will enter cracks in the soil and lay eggs for a few days. These eggs may be spread around due to rain that seeps into the cracks. Eggs split longitudinally for the larvae to emerge. Eggs and larvae end up at around deep within the soil. When rains fall, larvae can more easily burrow through the mud. = Larval instars = Larvae occasionally enter diapause for more than 3 years under certain conditions, such as when the soil is not sufficiently moist for their development. The size of the fly can indicate how many years it spent as a larvae. In the summer, larvae enter complete aestivation. When dormant, they are able to tolerate being submerged in accumulated rain water. Larvae typically become active once rain falls in the second winter of their larval stage. = Pupa = In early May, mature larvae burrow through cracks in the soil and pupate; this process is relatively short and estimated to be about five days. If the soil is too wet and cracks do not open, the larva will enter diapause. The pupation of L. torrens has not been widely observed. = Adult = Adults emerge from mid-May to June when soil is dry and cracks re-form. This period of emergence lasts around 4 to 6 weeks, depending on the season and year. The ratio of females to males emerging is generally 1.64. In the morning, flies crawl out to sun themselves and fly once the temperature is high enough. Emergence is especially abundant following heavy rain. Once fed on blood, females can mature and lay eggs. However, females may die from ruptured oviducts from egg pressure. Ovaries may contain 60 to 70 eggs. Food resources = Female diet = Female L. torrens feed only once, taking blood meals from vertebrates by burrowing into the feathers or fur of warm-blooded animals. There is evidence that females may also prey males if there are no warm-blooded hosts available. Before biting, flies explore the host before feeding for around 1.5 minutes. They are difficult to frighten away before biting, but are more easily shooed afterwards. Once the fly has fed, it defecates, sometimes with a drop of ingested blood. Feeding can take any time from 2 to 4 minutes. Because only the females feed on blood, L. torrens is considered a facultative hematophage. = Male diet = Males feed on nectar from plants or honeydew from other insects. If near sources of algae growth, they may also feed on algae or microbes on the algae to develop fat. L. torrens adults live for less than 12 hours without food and up to 5 days otherwise. Mating Male L. torrens have been observed in dancing swarms, where mating occurs. The males typically emerge in the season earlier then the females do and are ready to mate as soon as the females emerge from their pupal state. The females are attracted to the swarming males and fly into the dancing swarms of the males and mate with the two insects oriented end to end. Interaction with humans Females may bite humans, injecting saliva under the skin where blood then pools. Females tend to bite around the head and arms. Although small, these flies can leave swellings in diameter. The bitten area initially becomes inflamed and red before shrinking. Allergic reactions and secondary infection are also concerns involving bites. Unlike some close relatives, L. torrens are not known to transmit any diseases. =Population control= L. torrens is a pest, especially in California, and has been the source of several infestations. The tendency for larvae to enter diapause causes large swarms to emerge in certain years. Construction projects and farming efforts sometimes had to be temporarily suspended in the past because of L. torrens bites. Various forms of DDT were used to control populations in the past. Since adult flies rest on grass before taking flight, using pesticides just before emergence can help control populations. Malathion, diazinon, and fenthion are insecticides that has been effective in decreasing adult emergence. No tested insecticides have been able to control L. torrens from their larval stage in the soil. Planting sugar beets, alfalfa, and tomatoes may deter L. torrens from breeding.

The group existed from 1989 to 2005, released six full-length albums, and toured heavily both throughout Australia and internationally. History =(1989‚Äì1996) Formation and early period= The band was formed in the New South Wales outback mining town of Broken Hill in 1989 by guitarist Tim Grose featuring himself, bassist Eddie Tresize and drummer Ian DeBono. According to an extensive bio at the band's official website, Grose took on the singing role due to an inability to find a suitable vocalist. The band played popular rock and metal covers and shortly expanded to a five piece with the addition of Tim's niece Carolyn Boon on keyboards and Jason Hansen on guitar. Randall Hocking replaced Tresize and by the end of 1990 the group's line up featured Grose, Boon, Jamie Baldwin (bass), Dale Fletcher (guitar) and Darryl Riess (drums). By February 1991 however, only Tim Grose remained but a short time later guitarist Dale Corney joined him and the pair wrote and played as a duo for about a year before relocating to Sydney in 1992. A demo was recorded and Grose and Corney decided to rebuild a complete band line-up. By 1995, Dungeon's live line-up featured Grose and Corney plus Stephen Mikulic on rhythm guitar (giving the band three guitarists), George Smith on bass and Andrew Brody on drums. Several tracks were also being recorded for a demo entitled \\"Changing Moods\\", with Grose providing bass and keyboards along with guitars and lead vocals. Brody played drums on the opening track \\"One Shot at Life\\" with Jim Yannieh, who had answered an ad in the street press, laying down the drums for the songs \\"Paradise\\", \\"The Promise\\" and \\"Slave of Love\\". Neither proved technically proficient enough to play on the title track, an eight-minute instrumental, so Grose contacted BMG, with whom he had a publishing deal, for recommendations. They recommended Virgil Donati, who completed the track during a four-hour session. Brody and Smith left Dungeon in 1996 shortly after the demo appeared and were replaced by ex-Maximum Carnage members Wayne Harris and Justin Sayers. Mikulic also departed shortly afterward. In the meantime, Japanese label TDK-Core had taken an interest in Dungeon and expressed a desire to release \\"Changing Moods\\" as an album. Instead, Dungeon chose to re-work it, remixing some of the tracks with bass lines provided by Sayers, dropping a song called \\"The Promise\\" and adding nine new recordings including a cover of Blondie's \\"Call Me\\". Released under the name Demolition, the album sold well after it was released in Japan but Harris refused to take part in any promotional activity for the CD and was fired from the band. A friend of the group, Tyrone McMaster, adopted the name Ty Blakely and appeared in promotional packages accompanying the release, however this was merely to give Dungeon the appearance of a complete line-up as McMaster was not actually in the band.Fischer-Giffin, Brian The Australian Metal Guide p.67 2004 It was not to be the last time Dungeon was to resort to this tactic. In spite of Demolition's moderate success, Dungeon was dealt a blow when TDK-Core decided to stop releasing rock music. The album, which was only released in Japan, is now deleted. =(1996‚Äì2005) Major career= With Wayne Harris gone, Dungeon had no drummer but enough material for another album release. Around the same time, Sydney thrash band Addictive had disbanded. Drummer Steve Moore was put in touch with Dungeon through a mutual friend and by early 1997 the new line-up was rehearsed and beginning to appear regularly on the Sydney live metal circuit. Resurrection was then recorded in 1998, featuring a third version of \\"Paradise\\", keyboards from Gustav Hoffman and Sayers providing lead vocals on the tracks \\"Let it Go\\" and \\"Wake Up\\". The period of the recording process was a bleak time for the band and Grose quit at one point only to return after less than a week.Interview with Lord Tim, Pyromusic.net, 27 September 2005 Sayers was also keen to move on to other projects but he remained with Dungeon for almost another year. Several record labels including Century Media courted the band but Dungeon signed eventually to Sydney's Warhead Records in July 1999. Warhead specialised in releasing Australian heavy metal bands and Moore had been friends with the owner Brad Sims for many years. This possibly swayed the group's decision at the time. Justin Sayers decided to leave Dungeon at this point on friendly terms and played a small number of live shows with them until he was replaced by Brendan \\"Dakk\\" McDonald. McDonald had previously played guitar in a band called Dr Zeus, the same band that had supplied Dungeon with early drummer Andrew Brody. Resurrection was released in September 1999. While it sold well among the band's growing fanbase, Warhead Records folded early the next year and the album was never re-pressed. Despite this, it won them considerable notice and Dungeon supported Yngwie Malmsteen and Nevermore late in the year before making their first appearance at the Metal for the Brain festival. They would go on to play at the event every year until 2005. Dungeon toured solidly for another eighteen months until Dale Corney left in September 2001. Stu Marshall then joined, playing his first show with them as they headlined at Metal for the Brain. Most of the A Rise to Power album had been written and recorded by this time, although Marshall was able to contribute some lead guitar and vocal parts before it was released. In mid-2002, the group supported German power metal band Edguy on a small scale Australian tour that concluded with them signing to Melbourne metal label Metal Warriors on stage after their performance in Sydney. A Rise to Power was released shortly afterward, with Metal Warriors owner Steve Ravic helping them secure a worldwide deal with Germany's LMP. A busy live schedule rounded out the year and included support slots with Mayhem and Destruction. In May 2003, Dungeon went to Japan for festival appearances in Tokyo and Osaka. The tour was supported by a limited- release album of remixes and covers called Rising Power. The Tokyo show was filmed and released in mid-2004 as the Under the Rising Sun DVD. Shortly afterward, LMP released A Rise to Power on the international market, featuring a completely different and cartoonish cover illustration that the band would later renounce. Dungeon supported Opeth in early 2004 before entering the studio to work on both a follow-up to A Rise to Power and a new version of Resurrection. Tim had always expressed dissatisfaction with the original version and demands from fans for the now-deleted album convinced Dungeon to redo it. Sessions had barely begun however when McDonald left rather acrimoniously and while Grose was able to play the bass parts on the albums, the band was due to undertake another tour with Edguy. A long-time friend of the band, Glenn Williams‚Äîwho was at the time playing bass with a Brisbane hard rock band called Mobstar‚Äîtook over McDonald's role for the tour. Moore was also replaced by Grahame Goode from Infernal Method. While this was mooted as a temporary move, Moore confirmed his resignation from Dungeon after the tour in August 2004. Grose and Marshall then headed overseas ahead of the release of One Step Beyond, performing as a duo in Japan and Croatia with local backing musicians, and doing some other promotional work in the U.S. One Step Beyond was released in November 2004. Echoing the band's situation at the time of Demolition, Justin Sayers appeared in the accompanying booklet photos despite not having been a member of Dungeon since 1999. Goode was retained as drummer and since Infernal Method had disintegrated, founding member Petar Peric came into the group on bass. Following a handful of shows both Goode and Peric quit after their appearance at the Canberra leg of Metal for the Brain in February 2005. Goode's departure was particularly unfriendly and an air of animosity has surrounded his relationship with Dungeon ever since. Williams returned to the line-up and long time fan and experienced drummer Tim Yatras took over Goode's role in time for the band to play at Metal for the Brain in Brisbane the following weekend. Yatras was considerably younger than the rest of the group but already had an impressive resume having featured in a string of black and death metal bands from the NSW South Coast area including Malice and Battalion, with whom he had recorded a CD. He had also been the touring drummer with Sydney black metal band Nazxul the previous year. In April, Dungeon supported Nightwish and then Angra before a national tour with Megadeth. Dave Mustaine's approval of Dungeon was so high he personally selected them to support Megadeth on a European tour in June. Dungeon then played shows in Japan before returning to Australia in August after promotional work in Canada and the U.S. =(2005‚Äì2007) Break-up and aftermath= In September 2005, after a run of shows with wrestler Chris Jericho's band Fozzy, Dungeon issued a press release on their official website announcing that due to the departure of Marshall and Williams, Tim Grose decided to put an end to the band. They performed a final show at the Gaelic Club in Surry Hills, Sydney on 11 December 2005. Justin Sayers, Dakk McDonald and Stephen Mikulic made guest appearances during the band's almost two-hour set. A final album entitled The Final Chapter was announced. Recorded by Grose and Yatras, with guests Andy Dowling (bass) and Mav Stevens (guitar), this album was released in mid-2006. The band's various members have moved on to other projects. Grose and Yatras continued to work together under the name Lord with Dowling. This name was previously used by Grose in 2003 for a solo release. Lord continues to play the Dungeon back-catalogue live and follows a similar musical path. Both men also featured in the Newcastle studio-based power metal band Ilium until Grose announced his departure in early 2008. Stu Marshall formed a band called 20 Grams with Yatras briefly on drums and later with Jordan Howe, a one-time member of The Harlots, on vocals. This band is now known as Paindivision and has gone on to issue two albums as of mid-2010. Former bass player Sayers plays in a heavy rock / punk act called Platinum Brunette that released an EP in early 2007 and now features Lord Tim guitar. This band released an album in early 2009. Stephen Mikulic is a member of Lycanthia. Grahame Goode and Pete Peric reformed Infernal Method shortly after their brief time with Dungeon, however that group split up for good in April 2007; Goode later joined the thrash band Killrazer and Peric is now with Nazxul. Glenn Williams joined Brisbane melodic metallers Sedition (former bassist Andy Dowling had left to join Lord.) One-time drummer Steve Moore played in thrash band Vaticide and now plays in a Brisbane rock and metal band. Dakk McDonald runs a CD/DVD duplication business. Of the band's early guitarists, Dale Fletcher died from a brain haemmorhage in January 2005, Jason Hansen builds handmade guitars and Dale Corney sings for a Broken Hill metal band called Soulforge.

This rabbit has an extremely limited distribution area, found only in the central and southern regions of the Karoo Desert of South Africa's Northern Cape Province. It is the only member of the genus Bunolagus because of unique traits that separate it from the other lagomorphs in the genus Lepus. There is still controversy and debate between taxonomists over its classification. Many tests and karyotypic analysis has been performed on hares from the genus Lepus to compare the riverine rabbit to others that are classified as true hares. They have a diet which consists of mostly plants and vegetation, but their usual food sources are being diminished, causing a scarcity for their population. This food loss is also connected to other problems such as with forming burrows. A unique aspect of its biology is that females can only produce one offspring per year. This contributes to how it is classified as critically endangered, which is the most severe classification available. Other unique traits include being nocturnal, and producing two different types of droppings. Currently, there are conservation plans being enacted to help with its decreasing population and habitat. Identification The riverine rabbit is native to the Karoo desert in South Africa.‚ÄúEDGE :: Mammal Species Information.‚Äù EDGE of Existence, www.edgeofexistence.org/mammals/species_info.php?id=3. It has a general appearance that is similar to most rabbits, but the ears and body are longer. It typically has a black stripe running from the corner of the mouth over the cheek, and a white ring around each eye. It also has a brown woolly tail, cream or greyish-coloured fur on its belly and throat, and a broad, club-like hind foot. It has a dental formula of 2/1, 0/0, 3/2, 3/3, like other rabbits, with a total of 28 teeth. Its tail is pale brown with a tinge of black toward the tip. Its coat is soft and silky and its limb are short and heavily furred. Male riverine rabbits weigh approximately 1.5 kilogram while females weigh about 1.8 kilograms.Awaad, Rania. ‚ÄúBunolagus Monticularis (Riverine Rabbit).‚Äù Animal Diversity Web, animaldiversity.org/accounts/Bunolagus_monticularis/.  Taxonomy  The taxonomic status of the riverine rabbit is controversial among scientists. This rabbit has specific qualities that are different from other Lepus species, resulting in the taxon generic separation. However, this rabbit still has some external characteristics and cranial conformation has caused the controversy between taxonomists. Eleven different Lepus species had a karyotypic analysis performed on them and from this tests it was learned that all hares have basically a similar G-banded karyotype. This study was done to establish whether the ‚Äúkaryotypic affinities of B. monticularis lay with representatives of the genus Lepus ‚Äúor if the evidence found gives reason for this species to be in a genus distinct from that of true hares. The riverine rabbit's scientific name is Bunolagus monticularis. It is in the phylum Chordata, the class Mammalia, the order Lagomorpha, and the family Leporidae. Some common names referring to it are the bushman hare and the bushman rabbit. This rabbit also has less common names such as boshaas and vleihaas. These names arose from the habitats they lived in and are based on how these were moist and dense. Their broad hind paws which are furred underfoot were referred to as doekvoetjie . Habitat It is found in only a few places in the Karoo Desert of South Africa's Northern Cape province. None of them are protected area as of 2017. As its name suggests, the Riverine rabbit prefers to occupy river basins and very particular shrubland. It feeds on the dense shrubland and the soft soil allows for it to create vast burrows and dens for protection, brooding young, and thermoregulation. The riverine rabbit lives in very dense growth along the seasonal rivers in the central semi-arid Karoo region of South Africa. Its habitat regions are tropical and terrestrial while its terrestrial biomes are desert or dune and scrub forest. Two of the most common plants in its habitat are Salsola glabrescens (11¬∑8%) and Lycium spp. (8¬∑5%). They appear and live specifically in riverine vegetation on alluvial soils adjacent to seasonal rivers, though studies have found this habitat to be sixty-seven percent fragmented in certain areas. Currently the habitat is decreasing in size, contributing to this species being classified as endangered. The primary reason for the decline in habitats is due to cultivation and livestock farming. Major threats to this species comes from loss and degradation of habitat. Over the last hundred years, over two-thirds of their habitat has been lost. Today only five hundred mature riverine rabbits are estimated to be living in the wild. Removal of the natural vegetation along the rivers and streams prevent the rabbits from being able to construct stable breeding burrows. This is because of the loss of the soft alluvial top soils, which are necessary for the construction of these. Another cause of damage and loss to their habitats comes from overgrazing of domestic herbivores, which also causes degradation and fragmentation of the land. Without suitable habitat they have a lower rate of survival. The remaining habitat is thought to only be able to support 1,435 rabbits. This displays a main cause for its endangerment, which is that there is very little habitat left that can support it.  Predators and competitors  black eagle is one of the primary predators of the riverine rabbit The riverine rabbit is hunted by falconiformes and black eagles. However, it is capable of jumping over one meter high bushes when being pursued by a predator. To escape predation, it remains nocturnal, spending the day resting in a form, which is a shallow scrape made in the soil under a Karoo bush.Bunolagus Monticularis (Riverine Rabbit), www.biodiversityexplorer.org/mammals/lagomorpha/bunolagus_monticularis.htm.  Diet  Lycium, one of the main components of the riverine rabbit's diet The riverine rabbit is predominantly known for being a ‚Äúbrowser‚Äù. They eat riparian vegetation found along seasonal rivers in the Karoo Desert. This includes salt-loving plants such as the salsola and lycium. They sometimes eat grass depending on if it is the wet season. Aside from their conventional food intake, they also consume their day-time droppings which are soft and come directly from the anus. This is advantageous because their feces contains vitamin produced by the bacteria in the hindgut and also contains minerals such as calcium and phosphorus. Behaviour Riverine rabbits are solitary and nocturnal. They feed on their preferred foods, flowers, grasses, leaves at night. During the day they rest in forms. It produces two types of droppings. While active during the night the rabbit will produce hard droppings, and during the day droppings are soft, taken directly from the anus, and swallowed. In this way the riverine rabbit obtains vitamin B, produced by bacteria in the hind gut, and minerals such as calcium and phosphorus are recycled. They are polygamous, but they live and browse for food alone. They have intra-sexually exclusive home ranges; the males‚Äô home ranges overlap slightly with those of the various females. Between August and May, females will make a nest in a burrow lined with grass and fur, and blocked with soil and twigs. This nest is 10‚Äì15 cm in diameter, 25 cm long.Wyk, Cronje van, et al. ‚ÄúRiverine Rabbit - Characteristics, Habitat & Breeding - Critically Endangered Species.‚Äù Its Nature Offers You Int Reproduction The riverine rabbit is one of the rarest mammals in the world and very little is known about its reproductive behavior other than that it has a polygamous mating system, where males mate with more than one female. It bears its young underground for protection. The single offspring that the rabbit produces is born altricial, or bald, blind, and helpless, and weighs from 40 to 50 grams. It is the only African rabbit that bears its young underground. The helpless offspring stays with the mother until it is capable of living on its own and fending for itself. The low breeding rate of only one offspring per year is unlike most other rabbits and has led to attempts to increase numbers of this endangered species. A breeding colony has been established at the De Wildt Cheetah and Wildlife Centre near Pretoria. These rabbits will mate with a number of individuals, and are the only known rabbit species to make nests for the baby. Very rarely, two kits may be born at once.‚ÄúRiverine Rabbit.‚Äù Accommodation South Africa - SA-Venues.com, www.sa- venues.com/wildlife/wildlife_riverine_rabbit.htm.  Relationship with humans  The first time that the species was described by humans was in 1901, by a soldier in the British Army. Oldfield Thomas, a senior employee at the British Museum of Natural History identified a rabbit carcass as being of a new species. In 1978, during an observational study of the area, rabbits were identified near the region called ‚ÄúVictoria West‚Äù in South Africa. Genetically, its closest relations are to the Japanese Amami Rabbit, the Indian Hispid Hare, and Oryctolagus Cuniculus, which is a common rabbit in Europe. The riverine rabbit provides many benefits for farmers. It causes the riverine vegetation that it eats to bind to the soil and prevent it from being washed away in floods. Also, this vegetation promotes filtration of rainwater to groundwater, which is a benefit to farmers, who often use windmills to draw up water for their livestock. Indirectly, the habitat of riverine rabbit helps humans in farming. This benefit can only be sustained if the rabbit continues to feed on this vegetation.  Endangerment  = Extent = The riverine rabbit is a species that is in extreme danger of extinction. In 1981 it was first labeled as an endangered species. According to the IUCN Redlist It is now classified under the most severe category of endangerment (aside from extinction), which is critically endangered. It has a population of only about 500 mature rabbits and 1500 overall which both continue to decline. In addition, the IUCN Redlist predicts increased population reduction, in the immediate future. Their exact prediction is for one tenth of the population to be lost between 2002 and 2022. Another problem that this species faces in terms of population is how their already immensely small population is divided into several isolated groups, about 10 in total, all with less than 50 rabbits in each. = Causes = The decline in the population is largely due to the alteration of its habitat as over half of it has been rendered unable to support the rabbit since 1970. The reason for this is largely due to the use of land for agriculture, causing the unique needed environment of the riverine rabbit to be destroyed. The range of habitable area continues to decline, and it is predicted that over the next 100 years that another fifth of habitable area will be lost. The reason for this ongoing destruction of the rabbit‚Äôs habitat is the practice of raising animals for commercial reasons in the area, causing the environment to be transformed to serve this end. Another ongoing threat to the rabbit is how the isolated groups are divided up because fields in the area often have fencing which is impermeable to this species, designed to keep out jackals. An additional threat to the species is found in how the remaining land left that supports it is being damaged by climate change. Other sources for population reduction are found in how the rabbit is hunted for entertainment, food, and collection, and also in how the rabbit has often fallen into traps set on farms, for the purpose of capturing other bothersome animals. Soil erosion in the area of habitation is another factor in destroying the animal. Animals feeding on local vegetation decimates the already narrow scope of food for the rabbit. The practice of extracting materials from trees and destroying local vegetation destroys areas that the rabbits conventionally use to escape the heat, and also hide from animals which seek to eat or harm them. Finally, structures on rivers like dams isolate subpopulations from each other, discouraging faster population regeneration.  Conservation  = Current efforts = Relatively speaking to other similar species, there is little information known about key aspects of the riverine rabbit, such as behavior and diet, so one of the most meaningful conservation efforts underway is researching this species, seeking to find critical information about the species that will lead to more effective conservation measures. The current plan to protect the remaining members of the population has been criticized, with experts claiming that a large part of the remaining land that can support the rabbit is outside the current area being preserved for it. Other efforts include engaging and educating local farmers so that they act in a way which reduces harm to the species. Also, efforts have been carried out to get landowners of the area of the habitat to agree to certain measures that help the rabbit population. One of the most important and meaningful conservation efforts has been to engage in highly thorough monitoring of rabbit populations, a task made more difficult by the emergence of a new population in 2014. This endeavor has been carried out largely by the Endangered Wildlife Trust. = Recommended action = The IUCN recommends several further conservation measures, demonstrating that current actions are not adequate.They recommend capturing the animal as to safely allow it to reproduce without danger of predators or of not being able to find food. They also recommend different methods of managing the habitat and the population in the wild. Finally they recommend further efforts of informing the local populace as to how to protect the rabbit. The red list also notes that further research is needed into its ecology and into the conservation actions that would be most effective.

In 1981, after Microsoft moved from programming languages into operating systems, Digital Research improved its position in programming languages by acquiring Eubanks's company, Compiler Systems. Eubanks went to work at DRI, but he soon came to doubt the company's long-term prospects. In 1984, Eubanks joined Symantec and from 1984 to 1986 he helped develop Q & A, an integrated database and wordprocessor with natural language query. He went on to become president and CEO of Symantec, guiding it into the software utility and anti-virus business. He left in 1999 to become president and CEO of Oblix, a Silicon Valley startup that creates software for web security. Oblix was acquired by Oracle in March, 2005.

Attempts for the establishment  In 1956, the governments of Sarawak, North Borneo and the State of Brunei announced that they would abandon the Malayan dollar and adopt a common currency of their own,G.M. Watson and S. Caine, Report on the Establishment of a Central Bank in Malaya (Kuala Lumpur, 1956), 1 but that never came into being. The idea of the North Kalimantan was proposed by Brunei's People Party President, A. M. Azahari, who had forged links with Sukarno's nationalist movement, together with Ahmad Zaidi, in Java in the 1940s. The idea supported and propagated the unification of all Borneo territories under British rule to form an independent leftist North Kalimantan state. Azahari personally favoured Brunei's independence and merging with British North Borneo and Sarawak to form the federation with the Sultan of Brunei as the constitutional monarch. However, the Brunei People‚Äôs Party was in favour of joining Malaysia on the condition it was as the unified three territories of northern Borneo with their own Sultan, and hence was strong enough to resist domination by Malaya, Singapore, Malay administrators or Chinese merchants.Pocock p. 129 The North Borneo (or Kalimantan Utara) proposal was seen as a post-decolonisation alternative by local opposition against the Malaysia plan. Local opposition throughout the Borneo territories was primarily based on economic, political, historical and cultural differences between the Borneo states and Malaya, as well as the refusal to be subjected under peninsular political domination. Joining to form Malaysia was seen as a new form of colonialism under Malaya. The basic concept behind the formation of a union of British Borneo was partly based upon the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland in Southern Africa. After the defeat of the revolutionaries in the Brunei Revolt, the idea was put to rest. Had the federation been formed, the capital city would probably have been chosen from Kuching (capital of Sarawak), Jesselton (present-day Kota Kinabalu, capital of Sabah) or Bandar Brunei (present-day Bandar Seri Begawan, capital of Brunei and the historical capital of the region). The Sultanate of Brunei has traditionally opposed such a federation. When it was first proposed during the 1960s the Sultan of Brunei favoured joining Malaysia, though, in the end, disagreements concerning the nature of such a federation, and also disputes over oil royalties stopped this from happening.  Contemporary politics  There remain groups of people who favour the creation of such an independent state and desire separation from the rest of Malaysia. These groups see union of Malaysia as unfair to the people of Borneo, particularly Sabah, as the majority of the region's wealth goes to the Malaysian federal government. Only about 5% of the region's oil revenues go to the state government of Sabah and Sarawak. The federal government has taken 15% and other 80% goes to Petronas. Malaysian politics have usually been centred in Peninsular Malaysia, and critics see the federation neglecting the needs of East Malaysians. Some opposition parties in the Sarawak State Legislative Assembly have tried to promote a North Borneo federation. The matter was refused to be debated in the Assembly due to its sensitivity, by the coalition of governing parties in Sarawak, namely the Barisan Nasional led by Abdul Taib Mahmud. The Malaysian general elections in 2008 and 2013 saw the populations of both the East Malaysian states voted to keep the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition in power, which lost support in its traditional Peninsular Malaysian strongholds. This has seen an increase in development in the two states.

Founded in 1888, it became a public corporation in 1923 and remained under family control until 1990, when it was bought out by a private equity firm. On April 7, 2014, Sankaty Advisors, an arm of the private equity firm Bain Capital, bought the company from a group that included the investment firm Harbinger. It is the world's largest matzo manufacturer, one of America's largest kosher brands, and the first American exporter of matzo. History One of the locations the company held in Cincinnati in its formative years, 1926 The B. Manischewitz Company, LLC was founded by Rabbi Dov Behr Manischewitz, in 1888 in Cincinnati, Ohio. The Company went public in 1923 and remained a public corporation until it was taken private in a management buyout led by Kohlberg & Company in 1990 for $42.5 million. By 1926, the Cuvier Press Club described it as the largest firm of matzo bakers in the world, and the first American exporter of the flatbread. In the 1930s, in order to produce their products all year round, the company created Tam-Tam crackers, which are little hexagonal matzos, according to a recent book Manischewitz: The Matzo Family, written by the founder's great-granddaughter, Laura Manischewitz Alpern (though the modern Tam Tam is quite different from matzo). Their original product, the square matzo, revolutionized matzo-making, which until the family's production process, used to consist of rolling the matzo and trimming the edges by hand. It was also considered quite revolutionary to make matzos by machine. The company built a second production site on Bay Street in Jersey City, New Jersey, in 1932, to better serve the large Jewish community of the New York metropolitan area, and the Cincinnati facility was eventually closed in 1958. In 1990, a $1 million fine was levied against the company for price fixing with its two main competitors at the time, Streit's and Horowitz. In 1998, Richard A. Bernstein purchased the company from Kohlberg. In 2004 its name was changed to the R.A.B. Food Group, LLC and today it is known as The Manischewitz Company. From 2007 to 2014, Manischewitz was owned by the hedge fund Harbinger Capital. Manischewitz remains the world's top matzo manufacturer and one of America's top kosher brands. On June 14, 2011, a new facility opened at 80 Avenue K in the East Ward of Newark, New Jersey, serving as plant and corporate headquarters for The Manischewitz Company. In July 2017 the company closed the facility in favor of another New Jersey location, cutting 169 jobs.https://www.nj.com/essex/2017/07/manischewitz_reportedly_shutting_down_newark_plant.html Foods Potato latke made from Manischewitz brand mix frying in hot olive oil. Manischewitz has revolutionized the way in which matzo is produced. By mass-producing matzos they turned the output of matzo-making from a strictly local product into a national, and eventually international product. Manischewitz matzos were also the first to feature uniform texture, taste, and feel. When the company first began shipping matzos they also decided to make them square, whereas before matzos had been consistently round. Manischewitz's main innovation - making matzos with machines instead of by hand - aroused some initial controversy. Some rabbis of the era claimed that in order to be acceptable for religious use, the matzo had to have been made by a man and not a machine. Manischewitz was ultimately able to overcome these concerns, in part by demonstrating the meticulous adherence to the halakha (religious rules). Manischewitz acquired Horowitz-Margareten Matzo and manufactures Goodman matzo. In addition to matzo, Manischewitz-labeled foods include cookies, pasta, and soups. Other well-known kosher brands associated with R.A.B. include Carmel, Elite, Mother's, Rokeach, Mrs. Adler's, and Tradition; many of these were acquired by R.A.B. after successful runs as independent kosher labels. Kosher foods such as these are staples of many supermarkets in the United States. R.A.B. is not involved with Manischewitz wine, however, except in name. It has, since 1986, licensed the Manischewitz brand name to the Manischewitz Wine Company, a subsidiary of Canandaigua Wine Company (now Constellation Brands). Wine Bottle of Manischewitz The Manischewitz winery is located in Canandaigua, New York, and since 1987 it has been the property of Constellation Brands, which continues to license the Manischewitz name from R.A.B. Foods. The Winery was founded by Leo Star and run by the Star family since 1927. The Manischewitz winery is best known for its budget concord wine, which is widely available in much of North America. Made from labrusca grapes, its aroma is unusual, and is combined with a large amount of residual sugar. Because concord was popularized by the U.S. media over the years as being the kosher wine, it is often the wine that is used to celebrate Passover by non- Orthodox Jews. However, Manischewitz's sweet Concord contains corn syrup, a sweetener derived from corn, which is forbidden during Passover among Ashkenazi Jews. Manischewitz produces special Kosher for Passover bottling of its wines, which are sweetened with cane sugar as opposed to the corn syrup that is used throughout the year. The sweetness of Manischewitz wine and other kosher wines is often the fodder of jokes. However, Kosher wine does not have to be sweet. One of the reasons for the prevalence of sweet kosher wine in the U.S., and in the Americas generally, dates back to the early days of Jews in America, when they needed to locally produce kosher wine for the Kiddush ritual that is performed on the Shabbat and holidays. The combination of a limited choice of grape varieties that could grow in the areas where Jews had settled, along with the limited amount of time that was available to produce the wine and a market that was dominated by hard cider, yielded a bitter wine that had to be sweetened in order to make it palatable. Because the sweet Manischewitz variety of wine is so well known in the U.S., the existence of a thriving kosher wine industry that is anchored by vineyards in France and Israel, along with a growing U.S. industry, is often a surprise to Americans who are unaccustomed to taking kosher wine seriously. =Advertising= The company has used the slogan \\"Man-O-Manischewitz What a Wine!\\" for advertising.

Show of Hands' work prior to Beer's departure from The Albion Band consisted of two albums, Show of Hands (1987) and Tall Ships (1990). The newly prioritised Show of Hands recorded Out for the Count at The Old Court in 1991, and released it on cassette that year, sold at the band's live performances.Backlog 1987‚Äì1991 liner notes The duo briefly entered a hiatus as Show of Hands to allow to form the Anglo-Chilean band Alianza with Dave Townsend with three Chilean musicians, exploring world music. They released a self-titled album in 1992, becoming Knightley and Beer's first CD release. During the Alianza project, the duo recorded a performance from 8 June 1992 at Bridport's Bull Hotel, working with engineer Mike Trim and released it on The Road Goes on Forever in 1992 as Show of Hands Live, the duo's first CD, but by the time of its release, the band's previous three albums were out of print.Roots: The Best of Show of Hands liner notes The duo recorded their first, and only, studio album for TWAH! Records, Beat about the Bush, in January 1994, and it was released the following month. Produced by Trim, due to his successful work on Show of Hands Live, he and the duo aimed for an \\"elusive \\"radio friendly\\" folk/roots album that retained the band's live sound whilst adding a rhythm section.Roots: The Best of Show of Hands liner notes. Whilst the album did not attract much radio attention as the duo had wanted,Roots: The Best of Show of Hands liner notes it helped make the duo more popular and built upon their fan base. The duo left TWAH! Records and signed to Isis Records, the label which saw the original release of Lie of the Land. Recording The duo made maximum use of their instrument pre-amplifiers (acoustic guitar pre-amp pictured). Lie of the Land was recorded in July 1995 at Free for Good Studios, Bredon, near Tewkesbury in Gloucestershire,Liner notes a studio which belongs to Dave Pick and whose name is often initialised to FFG. This is the first time the duo recorded a studio album outside of Devon or Dorset. The album was then mixed at Sonica Studios, London, in August 1995.Liner notes. There are two traditional tracks on the album and ten Knightley compositions, including a re-recording of \\"Exile\\", one of the duo's earlier songs which had featured on their first album. The album was produced by Gerard O'Farrell, and displays a simpler, stripped-down folk sound, as opposed to the full-band set up that the duo had used on their previous album, Beat about the Bush, which the duo did not see as successful as wanted. On this album, the duo tried to capture their live sound by recording all the instruments using a DI unit. The band had originally hired O'Farrell, an engineer/producer, for their live shows, following the release of Beat About the Bush. By the time he produced Lie of the Land, nonetheless, he was now the duo's manager. Knightley said in an interview two years later that \\"normally when people take acoustic instruments into a studio they get the mikes out. Like, 'sorry everyone - that may be what you heard live but now it's going to sound like a PROPER acoustic guitar.' Gerard [O'Farrell] was saying from his point of view the D.I. is what makes us sound different and it can kick in effects at a massive rate. The thump you get from the pickup is what turns the music into acoustic rock.\\" He also later summed up the recording by noting \\"overdubs were minimal\\" and that the duo \\"made maximum use of [their] instrument pickups and pre-amps.\\"Roots: The Best of Show of Hands Release and reception The album was released in October 1995 on the independent record label Isis Records. Later, after releasing the duo's compilation album Backlog 1987‚Äì1991, it became was their first studio album to be released on the duo's own label Hands on Music, having re-issued the album. Their debut album, Beat about the Bush, was originally released on TWAH! Records before it was re-released on Hands on Music in 1999. The album cover was designed by Rob O'Connor, who also designed the cover for their previous album, Beat about the Bush. It features John Carpenter, who worked post-retirement teaching Latin at the nearby Beaminster school, with a bird sat on his arm. The album cover was later included in the window display collage featured as the album cover of the duo's compilation album Roots: The Best of Show of Hands (2007), which features four songs from the album, namely \\"The Preacher\\", \\"Captains\\", \\"The Keeper\\" and a re-recording of \\"Exile\\".Roots liner notes. The album was seen as a turning point, as it was given attention by major publications who gave it praiseful reviews. Bradley Torreano of Allmusic later noted that the album \\"finally got them noticed by the British press\\".Show of Hands  Biography, Albums, Streaming Links  AllMusic Mojo said the album created \\"a powerful, fresh sounding music with both integrity and widespread appeal\\", while Q magazine called it a \\"startlingly good\\" album and went one step further in voting it their \\"folk album of the year\\" in 1996. Oldies.com note that the album was \\"considered one of that year‚Äôs finest folk releases.\\" Knightley himself, whilst writing about the album in 2007, acknowledged the album earned them \\"some excellent critical feedback\\". Having by now built up a considerable fanbase through their mailing list, largely due to the success of Lie of the Land, the duo and O‚ÄôFarrell took the gamble of hiring London‚Äôs Royal Albert Hall for a performance on the evening of 24 March 1996. The duo's website biography says that \\"hiring the hall to the amusement of the media and the cynicism of sceptics they had the last laugh, with a sold out show. It was a huge gamble but the night of March 24 1996 proved that for this enigmatic, indy duo anything was possible.\\" The performance was released as the band's second live album, Live at the Royal Albert Hall, later on in 1996, and became the duo's best selling album. The duo also released the documentary film Acoustic Workshop on VHS in 1996, described as a \\"unique insight into the arrangements, instruments and techniques\\" of the duo's music.Acoustic Workshop liner notes. \\"The Man in Green\\" was included on the various artist compilation album The Best of British Folk (2000).Various - The Best Of British Folk (CD) at Discogs Track listing All songs written by Steve Knightley, except where noted. #\\"The Hunter\\" ‚Äì 5:03 #\\"Unlock Me\\" ‚Äì 3:43 #\\"The Well\\" ‚Äì 3:50 #\\"The Keeper\\" ‚Äì 5:03 #\\"Captains\\" ‚Äì 4:04 #\\"Weary\\" ‚Äì 2:01 #\\"Ratcliffe Highway\\" (Trad arr.

Biography She was born in Rio de Janeiro as Adalgisa Maria Feliciana Noel Cancela Ferreira, the daughter of a civil servant. In 1922 she married Ismael Nery (1900‚Äì1934), a painter and poet who introduced Adalgisa to a circle of Brazilian artists and intellectuals that included Manuel Bandeira, Jorge de Lima and Murilo Mendes. The Nerys lived in Europe from 1927 to 1929, where they met the artist Marc Chagall and the Brazilian composer Heitor Villa-Lobos. Ismael died of tuberculosis in 1934, leaving Adalgisa with two sons. Nery began to publish poetry and fiction after her first husband's death. Her first book, Poemas, published in 1937, received critical acclaim, and she wrote short stories and magazine articles. Although the poet Murilo Mendes had proposed marriage to Nery in the late 1930s, she married in 1940 Lourival Fontes (1899‚Äì1967), director general of the Department of Press and Propaganda (DIP). In the dictatorship (\\"Estado Novo\\") of Get√∫lio Vargas, the DIP was in charge of censorship. Nery assisted the DIP as a social director and public relations officer. When Fontes was named Brazilian ambassador to Mexico in 1944, Nery accompanied him and met Diego Rivera (who painted Nery's portrait), Frida Kahlo, Jos√© Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siqueiros. After Nery and Fontes separated in 1953, Nery began the political phase of her career. As a columnist for the Rio de Janeiro newspaper √öltima Hora from 1954 to 1966, she advocated socialism and Brazilian nationalism. The success of her newspaper column helped Nery to be elected as a member of the constituent assembly for Guanabara State (now the city of Rio de Janeiro) in 1960 for the Brazilian Socialist Party (PSB). Nery distinguished herself in the state legislature for her opposition to Guanabara Governor Carlos Lacerda and her high ethical standards. She was reelected to the state legislature in 1962 and 1966. After the military regime banned political parties in 1965, Nery joined the Brazilian Democratic Movement (MDB), which was the official opposition to the military regime. In 1969, the military junta then governing Brazil ended Nery's mandate and stripped her of the right to run for office or vote for 10 years. Nery spent the last years of her life in increasing depression and seclusion. She died in a retirement home in Rio de Janeiro. Various short stories and poems by Nery have been translated into English, French, German and Italian.

Page, 1899 2 March 1817--22 October 1882) was a Hungarian poet, writer, translator and journalist. He is often said to be the \\"Shakespeare of ballads\\" ‚Äì he wrote more than 102 ballads that have been translated into over 50 languages, as well as the Toldi trilogy. Biography He was born in Nagyszalonta, Bihar county, Kingdom of Hungary, Austrian Empire. He was the youngest of ten children, but because of tuberculosis running in the family, only two of them lived beyond childhood. At the time of his birth, his older sister S√°ra was already married and his parents, Gy√∂rgy Arany and S√°ra Megyeri, were 60 and 44 years old, respectively. J√°nos Arany learned to read and write early on, and was reported to read anything he could find in Hungarian and Latin. Since his parents needed support early in Arany's life, he began working at the age of 14 as an associate teacher. From 1833 he attended the Reformed College of Debrecen where he studied German and French, though he quickly became tired of scholarly life, and temporarily joined an acting troupe. Later on, he worked in Nagyszalonta, Debrecen, and Budapest as teacher, newspaper editor, and in various clerk positions. In 1840 he married (1816‚Äì1885). They had two children, Julianna, whose early death by pneumonia devastated the poet, and , who also became a poet and a collector of Hungarian folktales. In 1847, he won the competition of the Kisfaludy Society with his writing, \\"Az elveszett alkotm√°ny\\" (\\"The lost constitution\\" in English). After Toldi, one of his most famous works, was published, he and S√°ndor Pet≈ëfi became close friends (see their letters: To J√°nos Arany by Pet≈ëfi and Reply to Pet≈ëfi by Arany). Pet≈ëfi's death in the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 had a great impact on him. He was employed as a teacher in Nagyk≈ër√∂s where the local museum is named after him. Arany was elected a member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 1858. He was the secretary-general of the Academy from 1865. Also, he was elected director of the Kisfaludy Society, the greatest literary association of Hungary. The early death of his daughter, Julianna in 1865 marked the beginning of Arany's hiatus as a poet. He did not write any original pieces until the summer of 1877, when he began working on his poetic cycle entitled ≈êszik√©k which is substantially different from his previous works, concerning themes like elderliness, or the imminence of death. Arany died in Budapest on 22 October 1882. Works He translated three dramas of Shakespeare into Hungarian, A Midsummer Night's Dream, Hamlet and King John, and they are considered to be some of the greatest translations into Hungarian in history; he also helped other Hungarian translators with his comments, and translated works by Aristophanes, Mikhail Lermontov, Aleksandr Pushkin, and Moli√®re. The epic poetry of J√°nos Arany presents the legendary and historical past of his nation. The Death of King Buda (1864), the first part of a projected Hun trilogy is one of the best narrative poems in Hungarian literature. The other parts of the trilogy (Ildik√≥, and Prince Csaba) are unfinished. The proposed trilogy used Arnold Ipolyi's Magyar Mythologia as a source. Arany's works have shaped the popular impression of Hungarian history (at the expense of the actual historical record). One of his most famous poems is A Walesi B√°rdok (The Bards of Wales). Arany wrote this poem when Franz Joseph I of Austria visited Hungary for the first time after defeating the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. Originally Arany was asked to write a poem to praise the Emperor but he wrote a piece concerning the campaigns of Edward I of England to subjugate the Welsh and trample over their culture. Arany was drawing a parallel here with Austria's treatment of Hungary and the Hungarians. His poem Dante is one of those few verses in Western literature that can seize concisely the whole meaning and transcendency of human life (Peter Ustinov ‚Äì British actor). Some remarkable pieces of Arany's works have been translated to English by Watson Kirkconnell. Arany is today considered as one of the greatest Hungarian poets beside S√°ndor Pet≈ëfi, Endre Ady, Mikl√≥s Radn√≥ti and Attila J√≥zsef. Legacy The first scientific monograph on Arany was written by Frigyes Riedl. The Arany-album, a Folk metal album by Hungarian band Dalriada is based on popular works by Arany. It won the 2009 HangS√∫ly Hungarian Metal Awards out of 70 contestants. * A postage stamp was issued on 1 July 1932 to honor Arany.colnect.com/en/stamps/stamp/141645-J√°nos_Arany_1817-1882_poet- Personalities-Hungary * On 15 September 1957 another postage stamp was issued.colnect.com/en/stamps/stamp/178275-J√°nos_Arany_1817-1882_poet- J√°nos_Arany-Hungary * On 10 July 2017 a souvenir sheet of four stamps was issued.colnect.com/en/stamps/stamp/739922-200th_Anniversary_of_Birth_of_Author_Arany_J√°nos- Hungary =Poems in English translation= * Dante * The Legend of the Miraculous Hind or The Legend of the Wondrous Hunt * Years, O Years That Are Still to Come * I Lay Down the Lyre * In Autumn * Retrospect * Memorials * The Bards of Wales * On the Slope * Family Circle * The Nightingale * Reply to Pet≈ëfi * The Mother of King Matthias * The Two Pages of Szondi * Duel at Midnight * Bier-right or Ordeal by Blood * Becky Scarlet * Corn Husking * Annie with Golden Hair * The Seamstress Girls * Consecration of the Bridge * Mistress Aggie / Mistress Agnes * Imprisoned Souls References External links  * The Bards of Wales ‚Äì translated by Watson Kirkconnell * The Bards of Wales ‚Äì translated by Bernard Adams * Epics of the Hungarian Plain * The Legend of the Wondrous Hunt * * Category:1817 births Category:1882 deaths Category:People from Salonta Category:Epic poets Category:Hungarian male poets Category:Hungarian translators Category:Members of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences Category:People of the Revolutions of 1848 Category:Burials at Kerepesi Cemetery Category:University of Debrecen alumni Category:19th-century translators Category:19th-century Hungarian poets Category:19th-century Hungarian male writers ","title":"J√°nos Arany"},{"id":"2078065","text":"The Representation of the People Act 1949 was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The Act consolidated previous electoral law, but also made some changes to administration. Representation of the People amendments followed in 1969, 1977, 1978, and 1980, all being repealed through consolidation into the Representation of the People Act 1983. The principal change was to provide for the conduct of future reviews of Parliamentary boundaries by the permanent Parliamentary Boundary Commissions. The Act also abolished the terms 'Parliamentary Borough' and 'Parliamentary County', renaming them 'Borough constituency' and 'County constituency', abolished the university constituencies, and removed a requirement that the City of London form its own constituency. The Boundary Commissions were instructed to review all boundaries within 3-7 years from the Act coming into force, and thereafter to review the boundaries periodically. In addition the Act made some changes to the franchise, removing the remaining provisions allowing plural voting in parliamentary elections by people who owned business premises. (However, plural voting for local government elections continued until it was abolished, outside the City of London, by the Representation of the People Act 1969. It still exists in the City of London - see City of London Corporation elections). From this point forward, there was a single electoral register for both local government and Parliamentary elections and each voter was only allowed to vote once in any general election even if they happened to be registered in more than one address for local elections.
