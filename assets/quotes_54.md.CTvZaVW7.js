The paper, founded in 1915, is one of Stuyvesant's oldest publications. It has a long-standing connection with its older namesake, Columbia University's Columbia Daily Spectator, and it has been recognized by the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism's Columbia Scholastic Press Association on several occasions. The Spectator‚Ä≤s original reporting has been cited by The New York Times and the Associated Press.  Organization  The Spectator contains 12 departments. They consist of News, Features, Opinions, Arts & Entertainment, Humor, and Sports sections, as well as the Photography, Art, Layout, Copy, Business, and Web departments. As of Volume 110, there is also an occasional Science section. Departments are headed by editors who encompass the editorial board of the paper. The editorial board meets daily in The Spectator journalism class and is headed by the two Editors in Chief (EICs). At the start of their term, the EICs select three to four editors to be members of the Managing Board, a group that advises the EICs on matters relating to the paper. The current Editors in Chief are Talia Kahan and Erin Lee.http://www.stuyspec.com/about The Spectator is a not-for-profit and is financially independent from the school, but remains a prime news source for students, teachers, and administrators. The Spectator distributes 3,000 copies to the Stuyvesant community and surrounding neighborhoods free of charge.  Staff  There are over 250 total staff members who help to produce the bi-weekly publication, including a faculty adviser. At the beginning of the fall and spring terms, there are recruitments, but interested students may join at any time. Recruitments usually include some type of application followed by a writing portion. These applications are read by the editors and reviewed by the editorial board before choices are made. New recruits are notified by email, and are trained respectively.  Editorial board  Each department is headed by one to four editors. The editors, as a group, are known as the Editorial Board, and work on the paper daily in a class informally known as \\"Spec Class.\\" Editors edit and compile the newspaper for its biweekly distribution. Before the current editors graduate, they choose Editors in Training (EITs) to take their place. The EITs are trained for up to a year before taking on the full role as an editor.  History  The Spectator has been in continuous publication since 1915. As the ‚Äúcrown jewel‚Äù of Stuyvesant High School publications, it was launched on February 25, 1915 under Editor Joseph E. Kasper ‚Äô15. The first issue sold for two cents. In the early 1930s, the Spectator became free of charge to all students.The Campaign for Stuyvesant The paper won Columbia Scholastic Press Association Gold Medal and First Place awards throughout the 1950s and 1960s. In 1960, a Daily Mirror article charged that the principal censored several Spectator stories and revoked graduation awards for editors. The paper interviewed past President Harry Truman in 1957 and the Freedom Riders in 1962. A controversy ensued in the early 1960s when teachers disallowed the publication of an article about the firing of a teacher who had refused to participate in nuclear air-raid drills. In the 1970s, The Spectator supported anti-Vietnam demonstrations.  1998 shutdown  In April 1998, Editor-in-Chief Micah Lasher published a wraparound spoof edition of the Spectator called \\"The Defectator,\\" which poked fun at faculty members and the college advisor. Lascher's column called for the end of teacher employment practices based on seniority. On April 9, the day before spring break, the assistant principal of technology changed the locks and all the computer passwords in the paper's windowless office. Principal Jinx Cozzi Perullo shut down the Spectator after mounting tensions between faculty, administration, and students. The New York Times reported that there were months of infighting between the editors themselves and their faculty advisor. The disputes were ‚Äúinflamed by a handful of articles criticizing the conduct of individual teachers and the policies of the city teachers' union.‚Äù Some students believe that the paper was shut down to appease angry faculty members and censor further editorials on UFT politics, teacher hiring practices, and faculty conduct. The day after the April Fools' issue, leaders of the teachers‚Äô union complained about being bashed by the newspaper in a meeting with Principal Perullo. Perullo believed in students‚Äô rights to write about things that involve their lives, including teachers, but wanted the Spectator to have a written set of guidelines. The Spectator staff drew up a charter with help from Columbia University‚Äôs School of Journalism. The charter defines the procedures for selecting the editor-in-chief and the roles of the editorial board, the managing board, and the faculty advisor. Publication resumed on May 5, 1998 following a petition opposing the suspension said to be signed by half the school's students.  Charter  The outgoing EICs and editorial board select the new EICs. In addition, \\"student journalists, in concert with a faculty adviser, will make the final content decisions for The Spectator.\\"The Charter of The Spectator The charter protects the paper against interference from the administration, specifically review by all school administrators except its faculty adviser, and allows The Spectator to print important and controversial material without struggling for an administrator's consent.The New York Times article It is the basis for The Spectator's independence. The charter resulted from \\"a highly publicized dispute over The Spectator's plan to publish a series of critical articles about the teachers' union and certain teachers.\\"  Online version  In April 1999, Jack Rosenthal, president of the New York Times Foundation, met with Principal Stanley Teitel and the editors of The Spectator at Stuyvesant High School. He ‚Äúhad a vision that one day, one day, high school newspapers across the country, in both wealthy and poor districts, would be able to publish stories and pictures daily on the Internet.‚Äù A team of Spectator editors, veteran journalists, and web journalism specialists worked together to create The Spectator Online, originally published alternatively every other week between versions of the print paper. With the help of Steven Knowlton, an associate professor of journalism at Hofstra University, and Karen Freeman, a Circuits editor for The New York Times and a former associate professor of journalism at Pennsylvania State University, The Spectator Online was launched in October 1999. The team also created a how-to website, with an online manual and free software, published by the Times. A journalism class was created by the Stuyvesant administration with funding from the New York Times. The Web site has won several CSPA Gold Circle Awards for Online Media.http://cspa.columbia.edu/docs/contests-and-critiques/gold-circle- awards/recipients/2010-scholastic-circles.html#N108A6  9/11 issue  The 9/11 issue of The Spectator. On October 2, 2001, the school paper, The Spectator, under Editor-in-Chief Jeff Orlowski and Faculty Advisor Holly Ojalvo, created a special 24-page full-color 9/11 insert containing student photos, reflections and stories. On November 20, 2001, the magazine was distributed for free in 830,000 copies of The New York Times to the entire New York Greater Metropolitan Area.

Retrieved on November 7, 2009. The school has since opened SER-Ni√±os II. Admissions The school admits students via a lottery. The only preference that the school gives in the lottery is to siblings of already admitted students. Administration SER-Ni√±os as of 2009 receives state funds per student and relies on philanthropy for other expenses. While the school's teacher pay scales are equivalent to the pay scales of the Houston Independent School District, SER-Ni√±os does not have signing bonuses. Since SER-Ni√±os not a part of any school district, administrators do not go to a central authority to ask for approval of any proposed changes. A decision by the administration is made after a teacher submits a proposal and other faculty vote on the proposal. Curriculum The school's classes are completely bilingual. the language of instruction of the classes alternates each week between English and Spanish. Originally the students switched languages every day, but the faculty believed that the approach was too chaotic, so the school instead had the languages switch on a weekly basis. Allen Matusow, a history professor and academic affairs director who served on the board of directors of SER-Ni√±os as a member and as a one-time chairperson, said that the school decided to use the dual language approach because studies demonstrated that the approach was the most effective manner of teaching two languages. Classes of lower grades tend to have mixed grade level classes; for instance one class would have first and second grade students together. each student has to take three years of learning a musical instrument. All students have to learn keyboarding. Middle school students go on field trips to colleges and universities. Students in the seventh and eighth grades are required to take French. parents are required to sign agenda books and assignments on a daily basis. Parents are also required to attend parent-teacher conferences. The school calls parents and asks them to go to the school if a student submits unsigned or incomplete assignments. Charmaine Constantine, the principal of the school, said in 2009 that students who fail courses at the school tend to do so because they do not continue doing their assignments or because their parents are no longer willing to continue signing assignments and drive the students to extra Saturday classes. School uniforms Students are required to wear school uniforms. The uniform for elementary consists of white or yellow polo shirts and navy blue pants, skirt, or shorts. Middle school uniforms include shirts and blue jeans: the 6th grade has a green shirt w/the logo of the school logo on the left side, 7th grade has a red shirt with the school logo, and the 8th grade has a blue shirt with the school logo as well. Students may not wear pants with tears or any type of skinny jeans. Student body As of 2007 most students are of Mexican and Salvadoran descent and around 80 percent of the students are economically disadvantaged. Most students begin attending the school in the Pre-Kindergarten classes, and the school sees little student turnover. Many parents enroll their children in SER-Ni√±os because they want their children to develop better English language skills quickly or because they do not want their children to lose their Spanish language skills. In 2009, Christopher Strane, a teacher at SER-Ni√±os, said that when the school loses students before graduation, most of the students move to suburbs or out of Greater Houston. Student performance In 2000 the school's overall passing rate for Texas Assessment of Academic Skills (TAAS) examinations was 27 points below the Texas state average of 78%. The school's scores were below the state's averages by 26 points in mathematics, 29 points in reading, and 27 points in writing.Bowman, Darcia Harris. \\"Charters, Vouchers Earning Mixed Report Card.\\" Education Week.

Moore-Brabazon. It was used by him to win the ¬£1,000 prize offered by the Daily Mail newspaper for the first closed-circuit flight of over a mile (1.6 km) to be made in a British aircraft. Design and development The Short No.2 was ordered from Short Brothers in April 1909 with the intention of competing for the ¬£1,000 prize announced by the Daily Mail for the first closed-circuit flight made by a British aircraft.Barnes 1967, p.6 The layout of the aircraft was similar to that of the Wright Model A, which the Short Brothers were building under license. It was a biplane with a forward elevator and rear-mounted tailplane, driven by a pair of pusher propellers, chain- driven by the single centrally-mounted engine, but differed in a number of significant respects. It was designed to take off using a dolly and launching- rail, like the Wright aircraft, but the landing skids were incorporated into a considerably more substantial structure, each forming the lower member of a trussed girder structure resembling a sleigh, the upturned front end serving to support the biplane front elevators, behind which the rudder was mounted. A single fixed fin was mounted behind the wings on a pair of booms. Lateral control was not effected by wing-warping. Instead it used \\"balancing planes\\", each consisting of a pair of low aspect ratio surfaces, mounted at either end of a strut which was pivoted from the midpoint of struts connecting the wingtips.Barnes 1967, p.45 Service history A Green engine had been ordered to power the aircraft, but this had not been delivered when the airframe was completed in September, so a Vivinus engine, salvaged from one of Moore- Brabazon's Voisin biplanes, was fitted. Using this engine, a successful flight of nearly a mile was made on 27 September at Shellbeach on the Isle of Sheppey, where both the Short Brother's works and the Royal Aero Club's flying field were located. A second, shorter, flight was made on 4 October, ending in a heavy landing which caused minor damage. While this was being repaired the Green engine was delivered and fitted, but the attempt to win the Daily Mail prize was delayed by poor weather and did not take place until 30 October, when Moore-Babazon succeeded in rounding a marker post set half a mile from the takeoff point and returning to land next to the launch rail.Barnes 1967, p.46 A few days later, he responded to a challenge to disprove the saying \\"pigs can't fly\\" by making a 3 1/2-mile (5.6 km) cross-country flight with a piglet in a basket strapped to one of the interplane struts. On 7 January it was flown the 4 1/2 miles from Shellbeach to the Royal Aero Club's new flying field at Eastchurch, by which time a revised tail consisting of elongated fixed horizontal and vertical surfaces carried on four booms had been fitted to improve stability. It was now Moore-Brabazon's intention to make an attempt to win the British Empire Michelin Cup, and on 1 March he made a flight covering in 31 minutes, being forced to land when the engine crankshaft broke.Barnes 1967 p.47 Although a new engine was fitted, the aircraft was due to be exhibited at the Aero Exhibition at Olympia, and was therefore not flown again until 25 March, by which time it was obvious that nobody else was capable of bettering his flight, and the prize was formally awarded to him. By this time Moore-Brabazon had ordered a new aircraft of the Short S.27 type, and made no subsequent flights in the aircraft. Specifications Notes References *Barnes, C.H.

Lubocza village was first joined to the Nowa Huta District on January 1, 1951. It became a borough of Wzg√≥rza Krzes≈Çawickie when a new district, District XVII, was split off from Nowa Huta in 1990.  History  Lubocza was first mentioned in the privileges of Boles≈Çaw Wstydliwy on May 30, 1254 in Korczyn. This document confirms the ownership of the village by the Norbertine Sisters from Zwierzyniec. The sisters owned 37 villages, including Lubocza. From December 13, 1527 comes a copy of this document - is the diploma of Zygmunt Stary. In 1276 the village was given Magdeburg rights by the burghers of Krak√≥w. The Folwark and the Dw√≥r were built in 1780. Probably 1794 years passed this way Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko aiming with his troops into Po≈Çaniec. In 1914 approximately half of the village (47 houses, and a number of fruit trees) were torn down by the Austrian army. The wood from the walls of houses was used to build bunkers and trenches, and the population of the village was evacuated to the suburbs of Krak√≥w. In March 1915, the population returned to their homes when the Russians withdrew in the face of the advancing Prussian army. At that time in the village there were two carpenters, two shoemakers, two forges and two private grocery stores. In 1928 came (for the metropolitan councils of Prince Adam Stefan Sapieha) Norbertine sisters, to give children a free, Catholic education. For this purpose, the former house of the steward. Monastery Zwierzyniecki took upon himself the repair, maintenance equipment and sisters. It was an act of gratitude for the recovery of misappropriated by village multi-tenant Grzymk√≥w. Nurseries of that dedication was October 17, 1928. From May 3, 1930 Lubocza had its own volunteer fire department (which was merged into the fire department of Nowa Huta when the village joined that district in 1950). In 1936 the People's House was built (thanks to the strenuous efforts of the Council Gromadzki); it focused on cultural and social life, and contained, among other things, a stage and a shop. On September 5, 1939 the German army invaded the village and requisitioned Primary School No. 78 in Krak√≥w as quarters for its soldiers. On January 18, 1945 the bulk of the German forces withdrew from the village. On the next day a skirmish between the Germans and the Red Army resulted in the deaths of a number of Germans and the destruction of two tanks: one German and one Soviet. Lubocza was electrified on September 20, 1946. On January 1, 1951 Lubocza was incorporated into Krak√≥w. Transportation The district is served by the following MPK bus routes: 110 (Aleja Przyja≈ºni - Wad√≥w Tunel / Aleja Przyja≈ºni - Wƒôgrzynowice), 117 (Kombinat - ≈Åuczanowice) and 242 (Kombinat - Krzysztoforzyce).

Abu Dhabi is home to the annual Abu Dhabi Golf Championship, a European Tour event that, along with the Qatar Masters and the Dubai Desert Classic, forms part of the early-season Gulf Swing of January and February each year. Like the ADJGC, the Abu Dhabi Golf Championship is held at the Abu Dhabi Golf Club.  2009 championship  Chris Lloyd drives off in front of the Abu Dhabi Golf Club clubhouse Chris Lloyd completed a thrilling finish to the tournament by overhauling long-time leader Tom Lewis to take the boys title. In the girls match, Alexandra Peters held on to her overnight lead on the final day to take the trophy. Lloyd played a winning final round of 73 to beat Lewis, who had led by eight shots at the end of the first round and four shots going into the final day's play. Lloyd, 17, from Bristol, bore down on Lewis and took the lead on the 12th hole. With a one shot lead going into the final hole he held his nerve to win with a final score of 11 under. Tomasz Anderson took third place with a score of four over. Alexandra Peters on the way to winning the 2009 girls titlePeters clinched the girls‚Äô championship with a final score of five under, leaving her well ahead of nearest rival Jessica Wilcox who ended the tournament on level par. The 16-year-old, from Shifnal, Nottinghamshire, had gone into the final day with a four-shot lead and never looked in danger of losing it. Finishing strongly, Wilcox jumped into second place helped by a run of three birdies on the front nine, ahead of Holly Clyburn and Heidi Baek who both recorded scores of three over.  2008 championship  Stiggy Hodgson holed a 15-ft birdie putt on the second playoff hole to beat Tommy Fleetwood and win the 2008 Abu Dhabi Junior Golf Championship boys title. The two leaders finished 12 shots ahead of the field by finishing 12 under par over the three rounds. Hodgson, who plays with an unorthodox swing with its exaggerated head turn, did not drop a shot until the last hole, a poor bunker recovery and three-putt against Fleetwood's seventh birdie, cancelling out a seemingly decisive two-stroke lead to take the final into sudden death. Carly Booth, meanwhile, was untroubled by any of the competing girls as she decisively took the title.

At the age of nine, Pogue had a vivid and detailed experience, when a mental picture of a street scene was imprinted in his mind, as if a photograph had been taken. Later he was drafted into the army. As a young chaplain headed to serve in the Vietnam War, his mother gave him a Kodak Instamatic. She asked him to send her pictures because she knew he wasn't going to write. Disillusioned with the U.S. Army Chaplain Corps he was assigned to, he volunteered as a front-line medic, with the 198th Light Infantry Brigade. This took him to the front lines, providing ample opportunity for taking pictures. These snapshots of G.I.s and Vietnamese piqued his interest and became the impetus for his career in documentary photography. During the 1968 Tet offensive, he endured shelling and witnessed a member of his unit being shot to death, leading him to question the justification of the war. Taking Instamatic snap shots in Vietnam was just the beginning of his career in photography. Returning to the United States, Pogue enrolled in the University of Texas at Austin to study philosophy. He became the staff photographer for the university's underground paper, The Rag, published in Austin, Texas, during the '60s and '70s. By living frugally he was free to follow his heart and choose subjects he cared about. He kept his rent low by living in a janitor's closet at the University YWCA, and he found free meals at Les Amis, a cafe that treated him as its artist-in-residence. He survived on wedding and passport work plus his income from the Texas Observer, which paid him $5 a picture. In 1980 Pogue had his first real photography show at Brazos Books. It was there he met Russell Lee, a noted photographer from the depression era Farm Security Administration. Lee befriended Pogue and became his mentor. At their last meeting before Lee died in 1986 Lee made Pogue commit to never abandon black-and-white still photography. Pogue promised and has kept his word. Documenting social justice Pogue found the University of Texas student protests against the Vietnam War a natural subject in 1970. He also documented active-duty soldiers from Fort Hood, gathering in front of a G.I. coffeehouse, prior to demonstrating against the war in Killeen, Texas. This led to a lifetime of photography that captures striking images of intimate human conditions, with an unwavering eye. His work focuses on social justice, and spans geographies from Cuba to Iraq. A 1972 photograph documented the struggle of women and reproductive freedom. It shows a woman in the University YMCA on the phone, providing birth control and abortion information. That woman later helped persuade Sarah Weddington to take on the landmark Roe v. Wade case. During 1974, Pogue's lens captured civil rights protests on Austin's east side, where Brown Berets led hundreds of marchers to the police station to protest killings of Mexican American and African American youths by the police. In 1982 he again documented a demonstration, this time after a Mexican American youth was killed by Dallas police. His interest in social justice organizations grew and they became both the subject of his documentary photography and his politics. He used showings of his photography to speak about social injustice. His 1979 \\"The Short-Handled Hoe\\" from Hidalgo, Texas exposed the cruelty of growers forcing field workers to bend over solely to discern whether they were working. He documented the work of the United Farm Workers, and photographed its leaders, Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta. Pogue provided a 1993 photograph titled 'Farmworker Women' to support the National Center for Farmworker Health. 'Notecards - Farmworker Women, National Center for Farmworker Health' The 'Migrant Clinicians Network' is a beneficiary of Pogue's support.

His photographs appear in 'Behind the Walls: A Guide for Families and Friends of Texas Prison Inmates' by Antonio Antonio Renaud. When members of the Christian Peacemaker Team chained themselves to a house in the West Bank in 1998, attempting to prevent its demolition by Israeli forces, Pogue preserved the moment on film. In Jerusalem, his camera found members of Bat Shalom's Women in Black, while they protested the occupation of Palestine.'Eyewitness: Alan Pogue and his thirty year journey from Vietnam to Palestine' by Stuart Heady, 'The Good Life', December, 2001 During the embargo of Iraq following the 1991 first Gulf War, Pogue went to Iraq, despite a State Department ban on travel there. Near Basra he photographed an Iraqi girl, Asraa' Mizyad, whose arm was severed by fragment from a U.S. cruise missile. This image is among Pogue's most well known. He made five trips to Iraq with Veterans For Peace between 1998 and 2004. Notable Texans His lens captured many well known Texans, including, John Henry Faulk, Sissy Farenthold, Barbara Jordan, Molly Ivins, Ann Richards, Jim Hightower, and George Bush. These photographs provide an intimate look at their humanity and remind the viewer of their essential qualities. For example, his photograph of then-Governor George Bush, shows him with his cheeks puffed out in a classic expression of exasperation.

The Texas Observer provided Pogue a letter for the purpose of establishing press credentials. He was able to enter the Bank of America Center where the rally was held. While waiting for Trump to arrive, he heard something was happening outside. Pogue ventured outside and was taking photos, of Black Lives Matter protestors being arrested, when he came to the attention of the police. They arrested him for 'obstruction' and took him to jail. He was released the following day. References External links * 'Texas Center for Documentary Photography' * Interview with Alan Pogue at the Texas After Violence Project.

At its peak the facility encompassed . Plaque at Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza. Louis Goebel created Jungleland in 1926 as a support facility for Hollywood. He had been employed at Universal Studios when the studio decided to close its animal facility. Five of the Universal Studio lions formed the nucleus of Goebel's collection. The facility was originally called Goebel's Lion Farm and then Goebel's Wild Animal Farm. Soon a wide variety of exotic animals were obtained, trained, and rented to the studios for use in films. The facility later became a theme park, opened to the public in 1929. Wild animal shows entertained thousands in the 1940s and 1950s. Mabel Stark, the \\"lady lion tamer\\", was featured in these shows; she also doubled for Mae West in the lion-taming scenes in the 1933 film I'm No Angel. The zoo's residents included Leo the Lion, mascot of the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studio; Mister Ed, the talking horse from the television show of the same name; Bimbo the elephant from the Circus Boy television series; and Tamba the chimpanzee, featured in the Jungle Jim movies and television series. Many TV and movie productions used the park's trained animals, and many productions were filmed there, including Birth of a Nation, Tarzan, Doctor Dolittle, and The Adventures of Robin Hood. It was also featured prominently in an episode of the television show Route 66 (Season 2, Episode 31, \\"Hell Is Empty, All The Devils Are Here\\"). The park made headlines in 1966 when a male lion at the compound named Sammy mauled Zolt√°n Hargitay, the young son of actors Mickey Hargitay and Jayne Mansfield. A barn fire in 1940 killed 12 of the animals including tigers, camels and elephants. Jungleland closed in October 1969, because of competition from other Southern California amusement parks, and because the facility \\"didn't blend in\\" with the increasingly urban character of Thousand Oaks. The company which owned the facilities declared bankruptcy and sold all the movable property at auction: animals, buildings, trucks, furniture and supplies. Goebel retained ownership of the land, which was eventually sold to the city to create the Civic Arts Plaza and other developments.

With her fellow members of Fifth Avenue she toured with Westlife for three consecutive years before they split. She did not inform her fellow members of Fifth Avenue that she had hearing difficulties when she auditioned to be in the group. They found out when she developed a sore ear during a Westlife performance. She lost a further ten per cent of her hearing whilst flying to Spain to appear in the music video of the group's first single \\"Spanish Eyes\\", released in 2004, despite being warned beforehand that her hearing was at risk if she flew. O'Sullivan spoke of her deafness in an article in the British newspaper The Guardian, shortly before her demise. The newspaper compared her with other deaf musicians, such as Phil Collins, Ozzy Osbourne, Fatboy Slim and Pete Townshend, although noted that their deafness developed due to their careers. She continued performing for fans at weddings and in other areas throughout her career even when Fifth Avenue split. Her vocals appeared on the tracks \\"Through the Light\\" and \\"Don't Look Back\\" on John O'Callaghan's 2009 album Never Fade Away.

The corallites are cerioid and have irregular shapes, and there is usually an obvious central one. The colour is often mottled and is generally reddish-brown, brown or grey. The corallites are irregularly shaped and may be arranged singly or in short valleys with continuous walls containing several corallites. The polyps are still fleshy when retracted. Distribution It is found in the Pacific and Indian Oceans from Australia to Japan and Kiribati. Biology Homophyllia bowerbanki is a zooxanthellate species of coral. It obtains most of its nutritional needs from the symbiotic dinoflagellates that live inside its soft tissues.

The main threats faced by corals in general are related to climate change and the mechanical destruction of their coral reef habitats; increasing damage from extreme weather events, rising sea water temperatures and ocean acidification. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the conservation status of this species as being \\"vulnerable\\". All corals receive protection by being listed on CITES Appendix II.

It was first published 1919 as the Goose Creek Gasser. The paper is owned by Southern Newspapers Inc., a news-media company based in Houston, Texas. History The Baytown Sun was founded in Goose Creek, Texas, as the weekly publication, Goose Creek Gasser, in 1919. By 1928, the paper was operating under the name Daily Tribune. Due to the economic pressures caused by the Great Depression, in 1931 the Daily Tribune merged with newspapers in the nearby communities of Pelly and Baytown. The new newspaper was named the Daily Sun and was published in the Daily Tribune's hometown of Goose Creek. During the mid-1940s the towns of Baytown, Goose Creek and Pelly voted to incorporate into one city, with Baytown being the surviving name. Therefore, in 1949 to better identify with the new community it served, the paper was given its current name, Baytown Sun. Halloween killer In December 1985, the Baytown Police Department received five letters from someone identifying themselves as \\"Madman\\" and claiming to have been the killer in the Halloween murder of a local 11-year-old girl. Each letter contained a riddle which when answered, the author stated, would eventually reveal the killer's name. However, if the police answered incorrectly, another child would be killed on Christmas. In an unusual request, the letters also demanded the answers to the riddles be printed on front page of the Baytown Sun. When the Baytown police approached then Sun publisher Leon Brown with the request to publish the answers on the front page, he agreed, stating: \\"Police Chief Wayne Henscey said their publication could very well save a life. I was convinced, as were my editors, that the Sun's cooperation was a life or death situation...\\"  See also  *Galveston Bay Area *Wanda Garner Cash References External links *The Baytown Sun *Baytown Sun mobile version *Southern Newspapers Inc.

His best friend is Janis Hawk, a fellow FBI Agent who went to school with him. Demetri eventually sleeps with Janis in order to help her conceive a baby, even though he is engaged to Zoey, a lawyer who believed her flashforward was about their wedding until she realized it was possibly his funeral. Upon finding this out, Zoey dumps Demetri. Demetri survives March 15, the date he was supposed to have been killed, thanks to Mark.

He has a son with autism, Dylan, who knows all about Olivia and whom Charlie mysteriously recognizes. His research partner is Simon Campos, and Lloyd comes to believe that they are responsible for the blackout but, according to Simon's Uncle Teddy, they only amplified it, causing it to affect the whole world. He is kind-hearted and always tries to do the right thing. As of season 1, Lloyd has appeared in 17 episodes. *Dr. Bryce Varley (Zachary Knighton) ‚Äî A surgical intern reporting to Dr. Olivia Benford. He was on the verge of committing suicide due to a diagnosis of stage 4 renal cell carcinoma (kidney cancer) when the blackout occurred. After the blackout he experiences a renewed will to live, and sees his vision as a gift. His flashforward shows him alive and well in a sushi restaurant, and meeting a pretty young Japanese woman. However, in failing to initially locate her in Japan, Bryce decides to pursue a romance with Nicole Kirby instead. In Course Correction, Bryce learns that his cancer is in remission. As of season 1, Bryce has appeared in 16 episodes. *Nicole Kirby (Peyton List) ‚Äî A 19-year-old college student and Charlie Benford's babysitter. She was a childhood friend of Aaron Stark's daughter, Tracy. Nicole's flashforward shows her being held underwater by a stranger.

In Revelation Zero (Part 2), we find out that he is actually \\"Suspect Zero;\\" he was given a ring by the conspirators that kept him awake during the blackout. His uncle is the middle man in the deal, and Simon's younger sister is kidnapped by the people that want to control the blackouts. Simon's uncle had previously killed Simon's father, and after he also kills Simon's professor, Simon kills him. As of season 1, Simon has appeared in 15 episodes. *Aaron Stark (Br√≠an F. O'Byrne) ‚Äî A recovering alcoholic, he is Mark Benford's AA sponsor and close friend.

Agents of the military contractor Jericho later kidnap Tracy from his home, and in The Garden of Forking Paths, Agent Wedeck provides him assistance in getting to Afghanistan to find Tracy. As of season 1, Aaron has appeared in 17 episodes. Government *Fiona Banks (Alex Kingston) works for New Scotland Yard in London. After the global blackout, Fiona receives a call from FBI agent Al Gough, asking her to corroborate their flashforward. In their vision, Fiona and Al were in a meeting discussing the Rutherford case when a bird crashed into the window. Fiona's information assists the team in discovering that all of the flashforwards showed the same time. Due to the time difference between London and Los Angeles, Fiona's flashforward is dated as April 30, 2010. Fiona is credited for the first time as a guest star in episode seven, \\"The Gift\\", when she arrives in Los Angeles for a meeting with the team investigating the blackout. Fiona is already familiar with Al Gough through her flashforward, although paradoxically the two have not yet met. Fiona is continuing (or beginning in the case of the paradox) her investigation into Ian Rutherford. She is present when Al commits suicide in an attempt to render the flashforwards false, and is seen after his death taping up the window of the office she is supposed to meet him in on April 29. In a continuity error, Fiona was said to be working for New Scotland Yard in the first episode. By the seventh episode, Stanford Wedeck reveals her to be working for MI6. *Joyce Clemente (Barbara Williams) is a US Senator who is chairwoman at an investigation into the global blackout in Washington DC. Clemente questions several people about their theories of the blackout, including a man (Michael O'Neill) affiliated with the CIA accusing China of the incident. Wedeck and Benford take the stand and are both questioned regarding their ongoing investigation into the blackout. Clemente asks why Mark cannot recall everything from his flashforward, as most people could easily recall every second that they saw. Her questioning leads Wedeck to doubt and call Mark's flashforward into question. She also has a history with Wedeck, who is known to have worked in Washington DC. She reveals to him that she saw herself as the President of the United States in her flashforward, though is unsure whether to believe it or not, though she would like to. In the second half of the season she becomes Vice President of the United States. In a meeting with Wedeck, she reveals that Jericho has something to do with her becoming President. *Al Gough (Lee Thompson Young) was an agent working for the FBI field office of Los Angeles. He made his first appearance in the opening episode, when he is seen discussing the flashforwards with his colleagues. He revealed that he saw Inspector Fiona Banks in his flashforward, and later called her to corroborate the stories. Banks agreed and revealed having seen him in her flashforward. An evidence sheet with Al's name on it is seen in Mark Benford's flashforward. In \\"Black Swan\\", Al and Mark discuss with Stanford whether to follow up on the lead about Somalia. After Stanford vetoes the suggestion, Mark asks Al about the possibility of asking a hacker to hack into the system to spy on the investigation. By the end of the episode, Mark asks Al to contact the hacker, disturbing Al as he enters the name \\"Celia\\" into the Mosaic Collective. Al commits suicide in episode seven, \\"The Gift\\", in an attempt to reassure the rest of his team that the future is unwritten despite the flashforwards. He gets the idea after discussing putting tape over the window of the office that he and Fiona are due to meet in on April 29, so that the bird will not fly into it. Whilst Fiona suggests the bird might die somewhere else, Al remains adamant that the future can still be rewritten. An extended version of his flashforward appears in this episode, where Al is seen talking to his attorney about a woman named Celia, whom he is revealed to have lethally injured in an accident and who has been taken off life support and died about an hour before, some time before April 29, 2010. Al writes Celia a letter revealing that the future is yet to be written and that she will live to see April 29. *Miss Levy (Jessica Tuck) works for homeland security, and attends a meeting in this episode with the FBI agents behind the Mosaic Collective, notably Stanford Wedeck, Mark Benford and Demetri Noh. Levy reveals that her team have analyzed the ring that Suspect Zero was wearing and that it bears the symbol, Alpha. The team see Levy's evidence as unhelpful, considering they were hoping for facial definition. Levy subsequently reveals that Demetri Noh has been flagged by her security team for his conversation with a woman from Hong Kong who informed him of his upcoming murder. Levy is reluctant to give the information, only offering it after Demetri gets angry. *Anastasia Markham (Lynn Whitfield) is the Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security. She appears in the second episode, \\"White to Play\\", when she visits the FBI field office of Los Angeles having heard about the team set up to investigate the flashforwards. Anastasia is initially cynical of the team and how much they will be able to contribute, but soon changes her mind after seeing evidence of Suspect Zero, the man seen awake in the baseball stadium during the blackout. She recognizes how wrong she was to doubt the team after their discoveries by the end of the episode.http://abc.go.com/shows/flash- forward/episode-guide/137-sekunden/299003 *Dave Segovia - Played by Peter Coyote. Segovia is the President of the United States, who makes his first appearance of the series playing basketball with Stanford Wedeck. He later gives a conference to several journalists and agents in Washington DC, where he discusses the global blackout. When asked, he refuses to discuss his flashforward to those gathered before him, although his flashforward is revealed to the audience. In it, he is awoken in the night whilst sleeping and alerted to a potential danger. Segovia later attends a meeting with Wedeck, where he tells him he really could have used his help on the government and now has a position for him as the Director of Homeland Security. However, Wedeck later uses information against Segovia to secure funding for the Mosaic Collective. This information is a photograph of the President in a romantic position with Ren√©e Garrigos, who is revealed to be living in Georgetown. In a news bulletin, it is revealed that Segovia has nominated Joyce Clemente as his Vice President, in the wake of the death of the previous incumbent in the global blackout. According to Clemente's flashforward, she is to succeed him as the President, meaning that Segovia will be removed from office by April 29, 2010 (assuming Clemente was telling the truth about her flashforward, which was never shown to the audience). *Marcie Turoff - Played by Amy Rosoff. Marcie makes her first appearance in this episode where she appears to be a representative of the Mosaic Collective. She later reappears in episode five, Gimme Some Truth, having been assigned to work on the Mosaic Collective. She is on friendly terms with Janis Hawk and Al Gough. Marcie questions Janis about her romantic life, revealing that Janis has not yet told her colleagues that she is a lesbian. Marcie, alongside Janis and Al, discover the presence of five transmitters installed in Somalia in April 1991 - just before the apparent blackout that occurred there. In Queen Sacrifice, Marcie was arrested after she was found to be a mole within the FBI Mosaic Collective task force. *Marshall Vogel (Michael Ealy) is a CIA agent who becomes a part of the Mosaic task force. *Shelly Vreede (Barry Shabaka Henley) is an FBI agent working for the field office in Los Angeles. Vreede realizes that his flashforward foresees the same day as everybody else: he saw the date, April 29, 2010, on the news. Vreede is present in \\"Black Swan\\", when he and Demetri interview Alda. Vreede enters the information provided by Alda and allows Demetri to follow up the lead. Family members *Zoey Andata (Gabrielle Union) ‚Äî Demetri's fianc√©e and a criminal defense attorney. She was in Seattle, Washington at the time of the blackout. In her flashforward, she initially believed she was attending her wedding to Demetri, but now realizes that this is his funeral. She leaves Demetri after he admits to her that he slept with Janis to allow her flashforward to become a reality. *Charlie Benford (Lennon Wynn) is Mark and Olivia's six-year-old daughter. Her flashforward shows her listening to two men who said that her father is dead. *Dylan Simcoe (Ryan Wynott, Bryce Robinson in the pilot) is Lloyd's son, who is autistic and knows Olivia and Charlie from his vision. He writes the blackout formula seen in his father's vision. *Kate Stark (Kim Dickens) is the ex-wife of Aaron Stark, and the mother of the presumably deceased Tracy Stark. She works in a bar, the same bar that she sees in her flashforward, where she sees the same people and serves them the same drinks. Aaron asks her to sign an agreement allowing for the exhumation of their daughter Tracy's remains, following his flashforward where he saw Tracy alive and well. Kate refuses, but due to Aaron's connections with the FBI, via his friend Mark Benford, the exhumation goes ahead anyway, and a DNA test confirms that the remains belong to Tracy. Aaron goes to see Kate and tells her. Kate comforts her ex-husband as he finally comes to terms with Tracy's death. *Tracy Stark (Genevieve Cortese) is the daughter of Aaron and Kate Stark. Sometime in 2007 she was believed to have been killed in Afghanistan where she was working as a soldier; her remains were buried in the US. However, in her father's flashforward he saw her alive in a military tent. Aaron gets his ex-wife Kate's permission to exhume Tracy's remains. The DNA is proven to be Tracy's. Tracy makes her first appearance outside of Aaron's flashforward in episode seven, \\"The Gift\\", when she is shown in a flashback of how she was killed. Alongside her colleague Mike Willingham, Tracy was pursuing an enemy SUV when terrorists turned on them and fired a rocket propelled grenade (RPG). Mike escaped the truck although Tracy's door jammed and she was struck by the RPG and still in the vehicle when it exploded. Tracy is seen again waiting in Aaron's apartment, inexplicably. This episode was the first time that Genevieve Cortese is credited as a guest star for her role as Tracy. In the episode \\"Playing Cards with Coyote\\", Tracy is shown to have an artificial leg. She explains her leg was blown off in the explosion, and her father realizes that it was the leg that was found and buried, explaining her DNA result. Tracy claims she has been in hiding for two years from a private military force that wants her dead. *Felicia Wedeck (Gina Torres) is the wife of the director of the Los Angeles field office, Stanford Wedeck. She meets with Olivia Benford and discusses her flashforward. In it, she sees herself tucking a young boy into their son's bed. More so, he calls her Mommy. Later, at the memorial service for agents killed during the blackout, Felicia sees the young boy at the front of the memorial service. It is never shown if her flashforward comes true but Wedeck does state in one episode he has to get home to his \\"family\\". Blackout conspirators *Flosso (Ricky Jay) accepts a mysterious case from another \\"star armed guy\\" and opens it to reveal what appear to be six identical rings. He says \\"there was supposed to be seven\\" and kills the delivery man. He later interrogates Lloyd for information. Flosso turns up at Simon's family house as Simon's distantly-related \\"Uncle Teddy\\" that has been nurturing and following Simon's physics career since his teenage years. Flosso is most likely named after magician Al Flosso as Ricky Jay is also a magician. *Dyson Frost/D. Gibbons (Michael Massee) is the main villain of the series. He orchestrated the global blackout and its aftermath. He has had hundreds of FlashForwards, in most of which he dies on March 15, 2010 - the same day as Demetri. In a message for Demetri that Dyson recorded in 1991, he states that his and Demetri's destinies are \\"on collision course\\". He has used the alias D. Gibbons. Mark and Demetri discover that he has seen the end of the world, but the data on the event is destroyed before they can collect it. *Lucas Hellinger (Neil Jackson) was a man who first appeared when he interrogated Lloyd. When Lloyd refused to answer his questions, Flosso took over. A flashback reveals that before the blackout, he introduced Alda Hertzog to Dyson Frost (both of whom he employed). In the penultimate episode, he is revealed to be the leader of the GBO conspiracy. *Alda Hertzog (Rachel Roberts) is a person of interest being pursued by FBI agents Mark and Demetri on the day of the global blackout. After the blackout, Alda awakes, her SUV having crashed and her two fellow conspirators having both been killed. Alda mentions her flashback, claiming that the \\"horses were scared\\" and that she was \\"somewhere else.\\" Demitri takes Alda into custody and questions her. Alda claims that she wasn't behind the blackout. Her FBI case file is on the wall in Mark's flashforward. Alda returns to the series in \\"Black Swan\\", when she is interviewed by Demetri and Agent Vreede. She is cagey in her interview, denying any link to terrorism and refusing to tell the agents her real nationality. She also vehemently denies having anything to do with the blackout. However, she shows an awareness of the fact that Demetri has not had a flashforward, having overheard others in the office talk about it, and uses this to get at him during the interview. She offers them one piece of information, the name of a restaurant in Indio, California. This leads Demetri and Mark to discover a drug dealer in possession of vast amounts of drugs and a case used for nuclear components. She accuses Mark of not waiting around for the answers he is looking for, which leads him to ask for a hacker's help in hacking into the CIA for information on the Somali incident. *Nhadra Udaya (Shohreh Aghdashloo) is a woman apparently calling from Hong Kong who calls Demetri Noh after reading his entry in the Mosaic Collective. She reports that in her flashforward, she was reading the personnel file of a deceased FBI agent - Demetri. She tells him that, according to the file, he will be murdered on March 15, 2010. A photo of her appears alongside her name in Mark's flashforward. The woman remains a mystery until episode 10, when she is tracked down by Mark and Demetri in Hong Kong. She has two bodyguards and is reluctant to give up any information about what she knows, stating that this will lead to Demetri's murder in any case. After being pressured, she reveals that Mark will shoot Demetri three times, the information being known as a result of the serial code of Mark's gun, A561984. After she refuses to give any more information, Mark takes her hostage, although she is eventually apprehended by the CIA. Nhadra asks her men to lower their weapons, and as a result so does Mark, before being taken into custody by the CIA. He warns Nhadra that this isn't over, to which she responds that it never is. At the end of this episode, she is seen talking to a chess playing man implied to be D. Gibbons. *Carline (Lee Garlington) is Janis' contact, working at a pet emporium. *Lita (Annabeth Gish) is the woman who recruited Janis. Minor characters *Ingrid Alvarez (Elizabeth Rodriguez) was a bird store owner who video taped a \\"3 stars on the forearm\\" guy and his partner shoot someone in an alley behind her store. They took a small case that was later given to a \\"Mystery Man\\" at the end of the show. After a sting arranged by the FBI, she was to be put into witness protection after Janis Hawk revealed that one of the criminals had escaped. Ingrid accepted this fate, claiming that this was the explanation for her flashforward - seeing herself working as a zookeeper in the Bronx Zoo. *Keiko Arahida (Y≈´ko Takeuchi) is a Japanese woman living in Tokyo, working for a leading Japanese robotics firm. Whilst this is Keiko's first appearance in the series as a guest character, she has previously been seen through drawings belonging to Bryce Varley, who met with Keiko during his flashforward. Keiko decides to leave her job as an engineer as a result of sexual discrimination, being required to make tea during office meetings, due to her status as the only female member of the department. After leaving her job, Keiko leaves her family's home and heads for Los Angeles to Bryce. They are both on the same plane from Tokyo, but miss each other upon arrival. Keiko has a tattoo on her wrist, the Japanese symbol that Nicole Kirby has previously described as meaning \\"Believe\\". Keiko is shown to have a mother, Yuuka (Hira Ambrosino), and sister, whilst her parents have also been noted as working in a restaurant. In her flashforward, she was running to a sushi restaurant, where she eventually meets Bryce Varley, who is shocked to finally see her. The pair are intimate and overjoyed at meeting each other. Keiko was announced as a new character by producer David Goyer on November 9, 2009, introducing her as \\"the subject of episode nine.\\" http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/cult/s56/flashforward/news/a185895/producer- unveils-flashforward-newcomers.html *Rudolf Geyer (Curt Lowens) is a former Nazi who contacts the FBI claiming to have some information regarding the global blackout. Mark Benford and Janis Hawk fly to Munich, Germany, where he is being held to discuss the information with him. Geyer bargains with the agents, telling them that he will only discuss the information if they agree to release him, should the information be viable. Mark and Janis disagree, with Mark wanting to allow the man's release, believing him to be of no threat, being in his eighties, and also claiming the information must be useful as Geyer's picture was on the wall in his flashforward. Janis disagrees, saying that even though Geyer is old, he was a former Nazi and involved in one of the worst genocides in recent history. Eventually Mark agrees to the release. Geyer offers his information - after he awoke from the blackout he saw hundreds of crows dead in the prison compound. Mark is angry, feeling used by the old man. However, the information eventually leads the agents to discover that the same thing has happened to the crows before, back in 1991 Somalia - this leads Mark to question whether a similar event to the blackout may have happened before. Geyer is only released after his flashforward is verified by the man in it - Customs officer Jerome Murphy (Jeff Richards). *Didi Gibbons (Stephnie Weir) is a cupcake baker, and a person of interest of the FBI. After the global blackout, Didi turned herself in to the LA field office, asking to speak to Benford and Noh. She only knew the names of the agents having seen them in her flashforward, where she was arguing angrily with some creditors. She reportedly called every field office in the States until she found the agents. The agents eventually discover that Didi's credit card had been cloned and was being used in Pigeon, Utah. Her lead brought the agents to a doll factory in Pigeon where they met a man who was on the phone to Suspect Zero during the blackout. The name \\"D. Gibbons\\" appears on Mark's bulletin board in his flashforward, and it was added to the board in the present time. The FBI continues to refer to the man in the doll factory as \\"D. Gibbons\\", and Charlie apparently learned to refer to him by that name in her flashforward. *Sheriff Keegan (Marina Black) is the Sheriff of the town of Pigeon, Utah, who meets with agents Mark Benford and Demetri Noh following their lead on the flashforward of Didi Gibbons. Keegan informs Demetri that she, like him, didn't experience a flashforward when she blacked out. She explains how she prefers this, as everybody around her is getting too wrapped up in what they saw. Keegan is later killed in the doll factory by the real D. Gibbons after he shoots her. Demetri takes Keegan's death as proof that he will be dead before April 29, 2010, the day seen in the flashforwards. *Abdi Khalif - (played by Robert Lonzo Thompson as a child, Owiso Odera as an adult). In 1991 in Somalia, he was herding his goats when he saw the crows above him fall from dead from the sky. He followed their path and came across a small town, littered with the bodies of both crows and humans. He then looked up and saw a tower, and a mysterious gas. It is not clear if the gas is emitting from the tower, or not. Speaking to MTV News, executive producer David Goyer revealed that the Somali boy will be reappearing as an adult at some point in the series. *Gabriel McDow (James Callis) is a former patient of Frost, used for his exceptional memory capabilities as part of an \\"alpha test\\" for the blackouts. He becomes more relevant to the plot as he finds Olivia and tries to persuade her that this version of the future is completely different from the one he saw, in which she was married to Lloyd. *Edward Ned (Keir O'Donnell) is sitting on a bus when he blacks out during the global blackout. After awaking, he calmly reacts as he realizes the bus is underwater and steadily filling up. A young woman is struggling, so Ned soothes her and helps her to escape by breaking open a bus window. Two weeks later, Ned goes to the hospital for his injuries. He reveals his flashforward to Olivia and Bryce - he was walking through a club he always wanted to go into, wearing leather pants, reportedly one of his fears (alongside escalators.) He also tells how he was dark-skinned in his vision, instead of his usual paler color. Just as he is taken to theatre, Bryce realizes that Ned has Addison's Disease, a disease where adrenal glands do not produce enough adrenaline - this explains his calmness after discovering the bus he was on was sinking. Olivia refuses to base her treatment of Ned on his flashforward, as she personally is trying to convince herself that they won't come true. However, after Ned's heart rate drops as a result of his illness, Olivia relents and administers the correct treatment. Ned survives the operation, and Olivia and Bryce agree not to let their personal lives affect their work.http://abc.go.com/shows/flash- forward/episode-guide/black-swan/299003 *Jeff Slingerland (Callum Keith Rennie) was a teacher of American history at South Fairfax High School. He did not experience a flashforward during the global blackout, and as such, joins the Already Ghosts club, a club which unites everybody who did not experience a vision. Jeff is arrested after the club is infiltrated by Mark Benford, Demetri Noh and Al Gough, where he is the current \\"Raynaud\\" of that evening (the person who seems to lead the club, reported to be a different person each night.) He was interrogated for his connections to the attempted assassination of Janis Hawk and the deaths of Ian Rutherford and a number of others. *Mike Willingham (Mark Famiglietti) makes himself known to Aaron Stark and reveals himself to be colleague of Aaron's deceased daughter, Tracy. Mike reveals to Aaron the circumstances surrounding Tracy's death - they were chasing terrorists when they were shot at by a missile. Whilst Mike escaped, Tracy did not and she was killed in the explosion. Mike found Tracy's body, but later had to leave the scene after being shot at once more. Aaron thanks Mike for offering him closure regarding Tracy's death, as he saw Tracy in his flashforward. However, Aaron later sees Tracy in his apartment. *Celia Quinones (Lena Georgas) is introduced in the opening scenes of episode seven, walking in the city with her two young sons. A voiceover, read by Al Gough is spoken, revealing that Celia did not experience a flashforward during the global blackout, and is subsequently a \\"ghost\\". Celia finds a note on her car advertising the Already Ghosts society (Blue Hand Group). Later, in an extended version of Al's flashforward it is revealed that Al had, by April 29, 2010, caused Celia's death, although it remains unexplained. Al's attorney reports that Celia's twin sons will go into foster care after her death. In an attempt to save Celia's life, Al kills himself so that he will be unable to cause her death. Al narrates a letter written to her during the closing scenes of the episode. She was previously referenced in the episode \\"Black Swan\\", where Al was seen typing her name into Mosaic. She is run over and almost killed by a former member of the Blue Hand group, who wants fate to take its course as it should. Upon her survival, the attempted murderer states that he did not fail to kill her, the Universe did. *Maya (Navi Rawat) is introduced as a romantic interest of agent Janis Hawk - this is the first time that Janis's sexuality is revealed. Maya and Janis attend a tae kwon do class together, and after a session in the episode, they go on a date together. Maya reveals she works as a chef and in her flashforward she saw herself wearing a wedding band. When she asks Janis, her date jokes about having a three way with Hillary Clinton and Sarah Palin, instead of telling her the real truth. Janis also tells Maya that her colleagues do not know she is a lesbian due to implied homophobia within the FBI. The following morning, Maya is at Janis's apartment, the pair having spent the night together. She invites Maya to stay in her apartment whilst she herself goes to work. They meet again that night at a gallery, where Maya gives Janis an alarm clock as Janis is always running late. She then reveals that she entered Janis's name into the Mosaic Collective (apparently unaware that Janis is one of the forces behind the website) and now knows about Janis's foreshadowed pregnancy. Maya ponders whether the baby is theirs as a couple, joking about her sexual performance. Janis then tells her that she felt she was doing the pregnancy alone, and subsequently decides to end the relationship. *Timothy (Gil Bellows) was a window washer who fell from his lift during the blackout, but was miraculously saved from death by a hung safety line. He takes this event as a religious conversion, becoming an evangelist for a \\"new beginning\\" in life, creating \\"Sanctuary\\", a place of religious discussion and safety.

Often considered the best player in the world and rated by many in the sport as the greatest of all time, Neagu is the only female handball player in history to win four IHF World Player of the Year awards (in 2010, 2015, 2016 and 2018). She also won the EHF Player of the Year award in 2017 and 2018. She has been selected to the All-EHF Champions League All-Star Team five times (2015‚Äì18 and 2020). A prolific goalscorer, Neagu is the European Championship's all-time leader in goals scored (237). She was the 2015 World Championship top-scorer and was named MVP of the tournament. She also finished as the top scorer of the EHF Champions League in the 2014‚Äì15 and 2017‚Äì18 seasons. Neagu was given the award of CetƒÉ»õean de onoare (\\"Honorary Citizen\\") of the city of Bucharest in 2017. Early life Cristina Neagu is the daughter of Vasilica and Constantin Neagu. She was born in Bucharest, Romania, and grew up in Ghencea district, being the youngest of three siblings. Maria Covaci, local middle school coach, introduced her to handball when she was 12 years old. Professional career  Early career  Injury During the 2010‚Äì11 season, her right shoulder cartilage was damaged. On 10 October 2012, Neagu returned to play in the Romanian Women's Handball League at 605 days (approximately 1 year and 7 months) after injury and after she received long-term treatment in the United States. She got seriously injured again during a training session in January 2013. Neagu was out for six months after undergoing surgery on the left knee for ruptured cruciate ligaments. Comeback and later career After nearly two-and-a-half years of injuries, Neagu again reached the final stage of the Champions League, this time in 2014 with Montenegrin side Buduƒánost. On 21 December 2014, she was awarded best left back of the 2014 European Championship. She was also among the tournament top goalscorers, ranking second. After an outstanding 2013‚Äì14 season, she got nominated again for the IHF World Player of the Year Award, but this time she lost to Eduarda Amorim being named second best player in the world with 25.8% of the votes. Neagu won her first Champions League trophy in 2015 after an outstanding season, topping the goalscorers list alongside Andrea Peneziƒá and being voted the best left back of the competition. She was named MVP player at the 2015 World Championship in Denmark, where she scored 63 goals ‚Äì being the top goalscorer in the competition. Neagu reached the final stage of the Champions League three times (in 2010, 2014 and 2015). She has been a member of the European Championship All-Star Team three times (2010, 2014 and 2016). She received a bronze medal at the 2010 European Championship, being also the top scorer of the competition and having the most assists. A bad injury sidelined Neagu once again in the final main round match against Hungary at the 2018 European Championship when she was in a commanding position to finish as top scorer. She tore her ACL and had to undergo surgery on her right knee. Personal life Neagu is a huge football fan and a big supporter of local team Steaua Bucure»ôti, and attends their matches at the Arena Na»õionalƒÉ stadium. On 6 October 2020, she tested positive for COVID-19.

Each individual muscle fiber is innervated by only one motor neuron, but one motor neuron may innervate several muscle fibers. This distinction is physiologically significant because the size of a given motor pool determines the activity of the muscle it innervates: for example, muscles responsible for finer movements are innervated by motor pools consisting of higher numbers of individual motor neurons. Motor pools are also distinguished by the different classes of motor neurons that they contain. The size, composition, and anatomical location of each motor pool is tightly controlled by complex developmental pathways.Carp, J. S. and Wolpaw, J. R. 2010. Motor Neurons and Spinal Control of Movement. eLS DOI: 10.1002/9780470015902.a0000156.pub2 Anatomy The motor unit: a single motor neuron and the muscle fibers that it innervates. A motor pool consists of all of the motor neurons that innervate a single muscle. Distinct skeletal muscles are controlled by groups of individual motor units. Such motor units are made up of a single motor neuron and the muscle fibers that it innervates. Motor neurons are located in the ventral horn of the spinal cord and the brainstem. These neurons innervate skeletal muscle fibers through the propagation of action potentials down their axons (through ventral roots and cranial nerves), and they stimulate skeletal muscle fibers at neuromuscular junctions where they synapse with the motor end plates of muscle fibers. In humans, these axons can be as long as one meter. Motor neurons themselves fall into three main classes: alpha-motor neurons control extrafusal muscle fibers, meaning that they innervate skeletal muscles leading to movement; gamma-motor neurons innervate intrafusal muscle fibers, controlling the sensitivity of muscle spindles to stretch; beta-motor neurons are capable of synapsing on either type of muscle fiber. Alpha-motor neurons can further be divided into three separate subclasses, distinguished according to the contractile properties of the motor units that they form: fast-twitch fatigable (FF), fast-twitch fatigue-resistant (FR), and slow-twitch fatigue- resistant (S). The composition of a motor pool may consist of multiple classes and subclasses of motor neurons. Motor pools in the spinal cord are clustered in distinct columns of motor neurons extending over multiple spinal cord segments; although, there is significant overlap. Motor pools that control proximal muscles are generally located medial to the ventral horn, while those that control distal muscles are located laterally. Motor pools that control flexor muscles are located dorsally to the ventral horn while those that control extensor muscles are located ventrally. The number of motor neurons in an individual motor pool is highly variable and can generally be predicted by the level of nuanced control that a specific muscle requires. For example, some muscles have relatively low numbers of motor units in their respective motor pools while others, with highly nuanced control (such as the muscles in the human hand) have higher densities of motor units. Function Motor pools function primarily to integrate synaptic input from higher CNS centers into precise and consistent contraction patterns. Individual motor neurons within a given motor pool fire in accordance with what is known as the 'size principle'. The size principle was proposed by Elwood Henneman and his group in the 1960s as an explanation of the characteristic pattern with which individual motor neurons in a motor pool fire. The size principle stipulates that when the motor neurons of a motor pool fire, leading to the contraction of a terminal muscle fiber, the motor units containing the smallest motor neurons fire first. As excitatory signalling increases, larger motor neurons are subsequently recruited and contraction strength increases. Further, this differential recruitment of motor neurons occurs in instances of both increasing and decreasing contraction strength. As contraction strength is increased, the smallest motor units fire first and are also the last to stop firing as the contraction strength decreases.Henneman E and Mendell LM (1981) Functional organization of motoneuron pool and inputs. In: BrooksVB (ed.), Handbook of Physiology, sect. I: The Nervous System, vol. II: Motor Control, part I, pp. 423‚Äì507. Baltimore: Williams and Wilkins. The size principle has important functional benefits. Primarily, this system frees higher centers of the CNS from having to signal specific contraction patterns for distinct levels of muscle contraction. The level of synaptic input that higher centers provide to a given motor pool must determine the contraction strength, and this simplifies the process of contraction strength modulation. This system allows for very precise and consistent modulation of contraction strength from just increased or decreased levels of synaptic input: with additional motor units of increasing size, there will be a consistent and precise effect on the force of contraction. Another key benefit derived from the size principle is that smaller neurons will be fired more regularly and for a longer duration of time compared to larger neurons. These smaller motor units are more resistant to fatigue, and as such, are better suited to this role.Burke RE (1981) Motor units: anatomy, physiology, and functional organization. In: BrooksVB (ed.) Handbook of Physiology, sect. I: The Nervous System, vol. II: Motor Control, part I, pp. 345‚Äì422. Baltimore: Williams and Wilkins. Specialization and development There are several layers of differentiation and specialization to consider the complicated development of motor pools. Alpha- and gamma- motor neuron differentiation Alpha motor neurons and gamma motor neurons do not merely differ in their postsynaptic targets. The physiological differences between these two classes are significant. The axonal diameter of gamma-motor neurons is half of that of alpha-motor neurons, resulting in a higher cytoplasmic resistance and therefore a slower signal propagation velocity. Additionally, gamma-motor neurons display far simpler branching patterns than that of their alpha- counterparts. The differentiation into these two classes is regulated by complex interactions between several neurotrophic factors, and all of these interactions are not yet well understood. Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has been discovered to play an especially important role in all layers of motor pool development. In the case of alpha- and gamma- differentiation, it has been shown that gamma motor neurons express significantly higher levels of certain GDNF receptor subunits.Kanning, Kevin C., Artem Kaplan, and Christopher E. Henderson. \\"Motor Neuron Diversity in Development and Disease.\\" Annual Review of Neuroscience 33.1 (2010): 409-40. Print. Alpha-motor neuron subclass differentiation Alpha motor neurons are further differentiated into subclasses that demonstrate distinct physiological characteristics. Fast-twitch, fatigable (FF) motor neurons are the largest (and therefore the fastest in propagating signals) of the alpha- motor neurons; FR (fast-twitch, fatigue-resistant) neurons are of intermediate size, and slow-twitch, fatigue-resistant (S) neurons are the smallest subclass. In addition to signalling velocity, these differential sizes also form the physiological basis of the size principle. Due to their relatively small axonal diameter, S type neurons, which innervate smaller muscle fibers, require a smaller input potential to reach threshold. Conversely, FF type neurons, which innervate the largest muscle fibers, require a greater input potential to reach the threshold. Therefore, the axonal diameter of the three subclasses of alpha motor neurons clearly determines the patterns of the recruitment of motor units predicted by the size principle. The specific regulatory mechanisms that determine the size of these three alpha-motor neuron subclasses are not well known. Pool specificity and spatial orientation At a further level of specialization, specific combinations of motor neuron classes and subclasses are grouped spatially in clusters known as motor columns throughout the spinal cord. These motor columns are motor pools, and each has its own unique identity: each neuron within the pool (regardless of its class) expresses a unique profile of transcription factors, cell- surface proteins (such as axonal guidance receptors and adhesion molecules), and neurotransmitter receptors. These pool-specific biochemical markers provide the developmental framework for muscle-specific synapsing. Among this pool-specific combination of transcription factors, Hox factors play an especially important role. Hox transcription factors play a central role in the spatial orientation of the motor pool within the spine, and in the site- specific synapsing of the motor pool on to its down-stream muscle fibers.Song, Mi-Ryoung, and Samuel L. Pfaff. \\"Hox Genes: The Instructors Working at Motor Pools.\\" Cell 123.3 (2005): 363-65. Print. Pool size The number of motor neurons within a specific motor pool is a crucial developmental step. Again, little is known about the precise mechanisms and molecules involved in this process of specialization. However, it is known that the mechanism involves an initial generation of large numbers of motor neurons, followed by a pruning process that is mediated by cell death mechanisms and survival factors. Some researchers have speculated that the number of neurons within a given pool is determined by competitive interactions between different Hox genes. Evolution Muscles responsible for finer, more nuanced movements are innervated by motor pools consisting of higher numbers of individual motor neurons. This principle is highlighted by examining the evolution of the human tongue and hand motor pools. Human tongue Highly refined and coordinated movements of the tongue are responsible for the intricacies of human speech. The evolutionary analysis would predict an abnormally large motor pool innervating the muscle of the human tongue, relative to those of other mammals. Such a large motor pool would allow for region-specific innervation of the tongue muscle, motor neurons with task-specificity, motor neuron specializations that allow for quick movements, and various other motor nuances necessary for producing complex speech. Anatomical analysis has validated this evolutionary prediction: in the average adult human, the motor pool for the tongue contains between 7,093 and 8,817 motor neurons. This neuron density far exceeds that measured in other mammals, and even exceeds the motor pool size for many muscles in the human body: biceps brachii, for example, is innervated by a motor pool that averages 441.5 motor neurons in size.Baker, Todd Adam. A Biomechanical Model of the Human Tongue for Understanding Speech Production and Other Lingual Behaviors. Ann Arbor, MI: UMI, 2008. 41-46. Print. Human hand The evolutionary analysis also predicts large motor pools innervating the muscles of the human hand. The human innovations of tool-making, throwing motions, and clubbing motions required unprecedented manual dexterity, only made possible by extensive networks of large motor pools innervating the human hand. As Richard Young explains: > It has been proposed that the hominid lineage began when a group of > chimpanzee-like apes began to throw rocks and swing clubs at adversaries and > that this behaviour yielded reproductive advantages for millions of years, > driving natural selection for improved throwing and clubbing prowess. This > assertion leads to the prediction that the human hand should be adapted for > throwing and clubbing‚Ä¶ thereby providing an evolutionary explanation for the > two unique grips, and the extensive anatomical remodelling of the hand that > made them possible.Young, Richard W. \\"Evolution of the Human Hand: The Role > of Throwing and Clubbing.\\" Journal of Anatomy 202.1 (2003): 165-74. Print. Precise neuromuscular control allows for the sub-millisecond release times necessary for throwing. Effective clubbing requires the recruitment of several motor units to produce a secure grip through impact. These evolutionary predictions have been verified by comparative anatomical studies: the motor pools innervating the human hand are significantly larger than those innervating related primate hands. Relevance to disease ALS Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease that differentially affects specific motor pools and classes of motor neurons. ALS modelled in mice, for example, was shown to lead first to rapid FF motor neuron loss, followed by a delayed loss of FR neurons, leaving S type neurons largely intact in the late stages of the disease. Further, in late-stage ALS patients, death of motor neurons is pool-specific. Motor neuron death all throughout the spinal cord leads to a nearly complete loss of voluntary movement; however, ocular control and voluntary control of excretory functions remain mostly unaffected. These movements are governed by motor pools in the midbrain and in Onuf's nucleus in the lumbosacral spinal cord, respectively. Currently, research is being conducted on these ALS-resistant motor pools, and their pool-specific molecular identities are being examined for potential neuroprotective qualities. Parallels in SMA and ageing Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and ageing-related motor degeneration share clear parallels with ALS in the patterns and specificity of motor neuron loss. Though it is completely distinct from ALS in its pathogenesis, SMA leads to a similar rapid death of FF motor neurons, with S type neurons being generally spared. Further, motor pools controlling facial muscles (including those of the eye) and voluntary excretory muscles are spared. Motor neuron degeneration caused by ageing similarly affects FF types but not S types; ageing also seems to spare ocular motor pools.Enoka, R. \\"Mechanisms That Contribute to Differences in Motor Performance between Young and Old Adults.\\" Journal of Electromyography and Kinesiology 13.1 (2003): 1-12. Print. These similar patterns of neurodegeneration in three different diseases have led researchers to speculate that slow-twitch motor neurons, along with motor pools of the eyes and excretory muscles, have intrinsic neuroprotective properties that are not disease-specific. Research is currently being conducted to discover a possible molecular basis for neuroprotection in these cell types.

August 1998; revised March 2004. University of Kentucky Extension Service: Fad Diets It emphasizes eating food with a low glycemic index, and categorizes carbohydrates and fats as \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\". Like other fad diets, it may have elements which are generally recognized as sensible, but it promises benefits not backed by supporting evidence or sound science.  Technique  The diet has three stages, and gradually increases the proportion of carbohydrate consumed as it progresses while simultaneously decreasing the proportions of fat and protein. It includes a number of recommended foods such as lean meats and vegetables, and has a concept of \\"good\\" (mostly monounsaturated) fats. It makes no restriction on calorie intake, includes an exercise program, and is based around taking three main meals and two snacks per day. The first stage of the diet aims for rapid weight loss (13 lbs in two weeks). According to the UK's National Health Service (NHS), the severity of the first stage of the diet may result in the loss of some vitamins, minerals and fiber. The NHS reports that dietary restrictions during stage one may cause side effects including \\"bad breath, a dry mouth, tiredness, dizziness, insomnia, nausea and constipation.\\" Such symptoms would be rectified once the less extreme phases of the diet then began.  Health effects  Like other fad diets, the South Beach Diet has been marketed with bold claims that are not supported by evidence and with an unrealistic promise of easy weight loss. The book which promotes it also contains some incorrect and misleading information. Nevertheless, some aspects of the diet correspond with dietary advice which is recognized as sensible: its last two stages are sufficiently nutritious to be considered healthy. Like other high-fat diets, its short-term safety has been established, but its long-term safety has not. The diet is promoted as improving risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease, but the effectiveness for improving these risk factors is unclear because no evidence on its effects is available. A trial found no change in weight loss compared to usual care. South Beach Diet and other low carbohydrate diets lack dietary fiber. Fiber is generally considered to aid weight loss and to help prevent obesity.  Difference from other low-carb diets  Many sources place the South Beach Diet on lists of \\"low carb\\" diets such as the Atkins Diet. While the South Beach diet does prohibit foods rich in simple carbohydrates such as white bread, white potatoes and white rice, it does not require dieters to forgo carbohydrates entirely or even measure their intake. Instead, it focuses on the \\"glycemic impact\\" (short term change in blood glucose) of foods. (Nutritionists continue, however, to question the net benefit of the first phase to dieters not affected by impaired glucose metabolism.) Many vegetables are permitted even in phase 1. Complex, fiber-rich carbohydrate sources such as brown rice and 100% whole grain bread are permitted during phase 2. Agatston has tried to distance the South Beach Diet from \\"low carb\\" approaches; in the South Beach Diet book he wrote: \\"It is my purpose to teach neither low-fat nor low-carb. I want you to learn to choose the right fats and the right carbs.\\"Arthur Agatston. The South Beach Diet: The Delicious, Doctor-Designed, Foolproof Plan for Fast and Healthy Weight Loss. Rodale, Apr 5, 2003.  History  The South Beach Diet was developed in the mid-1990s by celebrity doctor Arthur Agatston with the assistance of Marie Almon, the former chief dietitian at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach, Florida. Originally called the Modified Carbohydrate Diet, the plan was renamed the South Beach Diet after the South Beach neighborhood in Miami Beach near Agatston's practice. The diet plan was initially developed for Agatston's own patients. Agatston noticed that the American Heart Association's then-recommended low-fat and high- carbohydrate diet was not lowering his patients' weight, cholesterol or blood sugar levels, but that his patients on the Atkins diet were experiencing weight loss. Unwilling to prescribe the Atkins approach to patients with cardiac issues due to the diet's allowance of saturated fat and limitation of carbohydrates containing fiber and other nutrients, Agatston referenced medical research to build an eating plan that categorized fats and carbohydrates as good or bad and emphasized lean protein and fiber. The plan grew in popularity as a method of weight loss as Agatston reported the results at conferences and patients distributed photocopies outlining the diet throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s. In 1999 a Miami TV news show put people on the diet and broadcast the results, popularizing the diet locally.Is Your TV Making You Fat?, WebMD The first book describing the diet, The South Beach Diet, was written by Agatston and was released in April 2003. By 2004 there about 8 million copies in print, a trade paperback South Beach Diet Good Fats/Good Carbs Guide had 3 million copies in print, and The South Beach Diet Cookbook went on sale with a printing of 1.75 million copies. In 2004, former US President Bill Clinton reportedly followed the diet. In 2008, Agatston published The South Beach Diet Supercharged, written with Joseph Signorile, a professor of exercise physiology; it included an interval training program.Dawn Jackson Blatner for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Book Review: The South Beach Diet Super Charged A review for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics found that \\"Readers are likely to see success using this diet and fitness book. I recommend skipping the restrictive Phase One meal plans and instead follow the more balanced Phase Two diet. The simple 20-minute-a-day exercise program is a realistic and inexpensive approach to fitness.\\" SBD Enterprises LLC, of which Agatston is a part owner, owns the \\"South Beach Diet\\" trademark. In December 2015, Nutrisystem acquired SBD for $15 million. Nutrisystem said that it planned to launch new lines of South Beach products by 2017 that it would market through retail stores and on the internet. In December 2018, South Beach announced that they would launch a keto-friendly diet in 2019.

At least 38 civilians who have been identified by name were killed, and more than a dozen were injured. In addition, houses were burned and livestock was slaughtered. It was the largest atrocity committed by the Soviet partisans in present-day Lithuania. Sources on the massacre are scarce, fragmentary, and biased hindering objective evaluation of the events. Prior to the massacre, to defend from Soviet partisan raids, the village had formed an armed self-defense force with the encouragement and backing of the German-sponsored Lithuanian Auxiliary Police. The strength and role of this self-defense force is a matter of controversy. According to Soviet and Jewish sources, the force was large and well-armed and was a significant hindrance to the partisan activity in the vicinity. According to Lithuanian and Polish sources, the force was 25‚Äì30 men armed with a few rifles. The events were investigated by authorities in Poland (2001) and Lithuania (2004). Lithuania opened a pretrial investigation against the former Jewish partisan Yitzhak Arad and sought to question other surviving Jewish veterans ‚Äì the action was met with protests and accusations of hypocrisy and antisemitism. Lithuania closed the investigation in 2008; Poland closed its investigation in 2018. The massacre remains controversial and politically charged. Some coverage of this event has been criticized for exaggerating the role of the Jewish partisans in this raid; others for trying to minimize or justify the massacre. Historical background Koniuchy, now known as Kani≈´kai, is a village located in Lithuania near the Belarus‚ÄìLithuania border. Before the Second World War, it belonged to the Second Polish Republic and, after the Soviet invasion of Poland in September 1939, it was transferred to Lithuania according to the Soviet‚ÄìLithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty. Lithuania was occupied by the Soviet Union in June 1940 and by Nazi Germany in June 1941. According to the census, carried out in August 1942 in Generalbezirk Litauen, the village had 374 people ‚Äì 41 of them declared their nationality as Lithuanians, 17 as Poles, and the rest chose ambiguous \\"of Lithuania\\". Polish and Lithuanian authors disagree whether the village and the victims should be considered Polish or Lithuanian. Sometimes the victims are also described as Belarusian. Soviet partisans became more active in the area in 1943. Koniuchy is located at the edge of the Rudniki Forest (now ), where partisan groups, both Soviet and Jewish, set up bases from which they attacked the German forces. The local Soviet partisans were commanded by and were subordinated to the Lithuanian section of the Central Headquarters of the Partisan Movement in Moscow chaired by Antanas Snieƒçkus. Starting in fall 1943, Soviet partisans were cut off from supplies from the Soviet Union. As per directives from Moscow, they were allowed to confiscate material goods from their opponents, and execute them. Unlike Polish partisans of Armia Krajowa (Home Army), these partisans did not enjoy widespread local support and could not depend on voluntary food contributions from local farmers. Therefore, Soviet partisans regularly raided nearby villages to rob the locals of food stock, cattle, and clothing. This raiding led to clashes between the farmers and the partisans. In response, German administration deployed Lithuanian Auxiliary Police Battalions in the area and provided weapons to self-defence units organized by villagers. This led to increased three-way hostilities between the Soviet partisans, Polish partisans, and Lithuanian police, with local residents caught in the middle and subject to arbitrary executions by either side if suspected of aiding the \\"wrong\\" side. Events at Koniuchy Village self-defense As raiding intensified in the summer of 1943, men of Koniuchy organized an unarmed night guard. In early fall 1943, the village was visited by four Lithuanian policemen and the men agreed to organize an armed self-defence group. According to later testimony by its leaders, the group grew from an initial 5 or 6 members to 25‚Äì30 men. There is no reliable data on the group's weapons. Soviet sources, trying to justify the massacre, claimed that the village had three machine guns and automatic rifles. One of the leaders of the village self-defence unit, Vladislavas Voronis, in his post-war trial by NKVD, trying to minimize his anti-Soviet activities, claimed that the group had only eight rifles and ten sawed-off shotguns. Rimantas Zizas evaluated both claims as unlikely and claimed that at least some weapons should have been provided by the Lithuanian policemen of the 253rd Police Battalion which had an outpost in . Similarly, there is no agreement on fortifications of the village. Memoirs by Jewish partisans claim that the village was fortified with trenches and watch towers and even had a German contingent; these claims are refuted by Polish and Lithuanian authors. There were several incidents between the partisans and the men of Koniuchy. In October 1943, a group of six armed Soviet partisans took three cartloads worth of food, clothes, and other items. The villagers stopped the partisans on a bridge over ≈†alƒçia and took back the property. There is some evidence that two partisans were killed in the incident. In January 1944, a Soviet partisan was killed in in an operation by the Lithuanian Auxiliary Police that involved a few men from Koniuchy. Soviet sources claimed that the partisan was captured, transported to Koniuchy, tortured, and later executed. Similarly, Soviet sources implicated men from Koniuchy in attacks on Soviet partisans in and . Post-war testimony by locals shows that the partisans sent two or three open letters to the residents of Koniuchy urging them to surrender their weapons and cease anti-partisan activities, and vowing reprisals if they refused. The partisan view of the village was summed up in a November 2008 interview by Sara Ginaitƒó, former Jewish partisan and a professor at York University, who stated that the village had a \\"record of hostility to the partisans\\" and that \\"the villagers were not unarmed civilians, but rather collaborators and combatants against Soviet partisans\\". The collaboration was denied by the villagers who claimed that only a few men in the village were armed with rifles for self-protection. Massacre and different accounts On 29 January 1944, around 5 a.m., the village was attacked by Soviet partisan units under the command of the Central Headquarters of the Partisan Movement in Moscow. The order to attack was given by . The raid was carried out by 100‚Äì150 partisans from various units including Jewish partisans. According to Zimanas report of 31 January, the attack was carried out by partisans from the so-called Vilnius Brigade, \\"Death to Occupiers\\" (part of Kaunas Brigade), \\"Margiris\\", and a special group of the GRU of the General Staff of the Red Army (also known as Platoon no. 14). The Vilnius Brigade included partisan groups \\"Death to Fascism\\", \\"Avengers\\", \\"To Victory\\", \\"Fight\\", \\"Thunder\\", and a unit named after Adam Mickiewicz). A log of partisan activity recorded that 30 fighters from \\"Avengers\\" and \\"To Victory\\" participated in the massacre. Rimantas Zizas identified captain Michai≈Ç Cejko from the \\"Death to Occupiers\\" unit as the commander of the attack. Cejko claimed the command in his autobiography completed in August 1944 and the command was mentioned when he was awarded the Order of the Patriotic War (2nd class) in April 1944. Cejko was a Belarusian who served in the 37th Rifle Division, was captured by the Germans, and escaped from a POW camp in Kalvarija. The commemorative monument erected in Koniuchy lists 38 names, among them 11 women and 15 children under the age of 16. The youngest murdered child was 1.5-year old girl shot while held in her mother's arms. Another dozen of villagers was injured. According to reports of the Lithuanian Security Police, 36 houses, 40 granaries, 39 barns, and one banya were burned down, 50 cows, 16 horses, about 50 pigs, and 100 sheep were slaughtered. By one account, only six houses remained standing in the village. The same security police report also claimed that two murdered villagers were Lithuanian policemen and that one partisan was killed and three were injured ‚Äì this is contradicted by Zimanas' reports that claimed no casualties on the Soviet side. The surviving villagers received a government benefit of 500 Reichsmarks. After the war, Soviet partisans barely mentioned Koniuchy in their memoirs. Even partisan personnel files maintained by Soviet security agencies often neglected to mention the person's involvement in the massacre. Jewish partisans wrote a few contradictory accounts of the Koniuchy events. In a 1969 book Kauno getas ir jo kovotojai (Kovno Ghetto and Its Fighters) Dmitri Gelpernas and Mejeris Elinas (Meir Yelin) portrayed the massacre as a fierce battle \\"for every house\\" with well armed \\"Hitlerites\\". Fierce fighting was also described by Isaac Kowalski (1969) and Rozka Korczak in her Russian memoir published in 1977. Chaim Lazar in his book Destruction and Resistance (published in 1985 in New York) wrote that the village was to be destroyed completely and described how half-naked people jumped out the windows to escape the bullets. In 1988, Paul Bagriansky published a graphic account of the events that included mutilation of eight villagers' corpses. More accounts were recorded after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, including by Abraham Zeleznikow (1993). Survivor accounts were first published by the Lithuanian daily Respublika in 1990. Immediate aftermath According to a report by the Lithuanian Auxiliary Police, 52 auxiliaries from the 253rd Battalion armed with machine guns went to Koniuchy at 7 a.m., but failed to intercept the partisans. Soviet partisans also threatened to attack the nearby villages of , , , and . On the other side of the Rudniki Forest, the partisans attacked and took provisions and the Lithuanian police attempted to ambush the partisans in the village. Other ambushes were also unsuccessful. The Lithuanian Auxiliary Police considered reprisal actions against villages supporting the Soviet partisans. Locals identified a couple of residents from and as participants in the attack on Koniuchy. According to reports of the Lithuanian Security Police, about 40 policemen from the 253rd Battalion surrounded Did≈æiosios Sƒólos, searched for weapons, and severely injured two residents. A letter from an officer of the 253rd Battalion to his superior openly suggested to deal with Did≈æiosios Sƒólos in the same manner as two Belarusian villages near Vidzy that were destroyed by the battalion during an anti-partisan operation in October 1943, but it was avoided. Soviet partisans were afraid of a reprisal action by the Germans and some units left their bases. Zimanas even suggested that the partisans might retreat to forests near the Lake Narach where units commanded by Motiejus ≈†umauskas were based. The situation normalized by early March 1944. Investigations The Polish Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) initiated a formal investigation into the incident on 3 March 2001, at the request of the Canadian Polish Congress. The institute examined a number of archival documents including police reports, encoded messages, military records and personnel files of the Soviet partisans. Requests for legal assistance were then sent to state prosecutors in Belarus, Lithuania, the Russian Federation and Israel. The IPN investigation was closed in February 2018. The official reason for the closure was that the investigators were not able to establish \\"beyond a reasonable doubt\\" that any perpetrators of the massacre were still alive, and as a result concluded that there was no one who could be charged with a crime. The Lithuanian prosecutor general subsequently opened its own investigation into the massacre in 2004. In April 2006, the Lithuanian daily Respublika published excerpts from memoirs of Yitzhak Arad, former chairman of Yad Vashem, about his role in the Koniuchy massacre. A pretrial investigation against Arad was opened in May 2006. As part of its investigation, Lithuanian prosecutors sought to question other Jewish veterans of the partisan movement, including Sara Ginaitƒó, Rachel Margolis, and Fania Branstovsky. Arad had served as a member of the International Commission for the Evaluation of the Crimes of the Nazi and Soviet Occupation Regimes in Lithuania appointed by the president of Lithuania in 2005. In response to the investigation, Yad Vashem issued a protest saying it focused on \\"victims of Nazi oppression\\" and suspended Israeli participation in the international commission. The failure of the Lithuanian judiciary to investigate local Nazi collaborators like Aleksandras Lileikis while choosing to question Jewish partisans led to charges of hypocrisy, attempt at victim blaming, and antisemitism. Following wide international and some domestic criticism, the Lithuanian investigation was closed in September 2008. Evaluations Saulius Su≈æiedƒólis summarized the evaluations of the massacre saying that Jewish groups considered the investigations an attack against the \\"heroic Soviet antifascist resistance\\" while Lithuania and Poland saw it as a Soviet atrocity complicating the oversimplified good vs. evil image of the fight against Nazi Germany. Similar views were expressed by Piotr Gontarczyk who said that the events of Koniuchy distort the black and white, heroic image of Jewish partisans, and lamented that attempts to reconstruct complicated historic events or interview figures like Arad are seen as antisemitism. According to Antony Polonsky, nationalists in both Lithuania and Poland have portrayed Koniuchy as a \\"Jewish action\\". While the exact determination of the ethnicity of the Soviet partisans is not possible, it is clear that Jews were a minority in these formations. While discussing anti-Semitic stereotypes and historical exaggerations of Jews' role in Soviet atrocities, Polonsky stated that time has come for Jews to accept that some of their compatriots also carried out atrocities, and partisans involved in Koniuchy and Naliboki massacres committed \\"very evil things\\". Hanna Maria Kwiatkowska concluded that daily Nasz Dziennik used the stories of Koniuchy and Naliboki massacres as a balancing counterweight to the Jedwabne pogrom which came to public attention in 1999. Rimantas Zizas echoed the same sentiment that Koniuchy became politicized in Poland due to Jedwabne. Similarly, Dovid Katz said that a politicized prosecution in Lithuania used Koniuchy to obfuscate the Holocaust by shifting attention to Soviet partisans from unpunished local war criminals who aided the Holocaust in Lithuania resulting in some 200,000 Jewish deaths. He decried the Lithuanian investigation as \\"antisemitic campaigns masquerading as history\\". Memorial cross erected in 2004 Commemoration In May 2004, a memorial cross commemorating the event was erected in Kani≈´kai with the names of the known victims.

Kelley Paul has worked as a political consultant for The Strategy Group for Media and as a freelance writer, and has also published a book titled True and Constant Friends in April 2015. Paul is a graduate of Rhodes College. She is actively engaged in fundraising for veterans charities, in addition to her work for a political consulting firm. Early life and education Kelley Ashby was born in Russellville, Kentucky, the daughter of Lillian (Wessell) and Hilton Ray Ashby, a military family. Kelley has described her grandmother, an Irish immigrant who traveled the United States as a teenager, as one of her greatest life influences. Kelley spent much of her early life moving around the country, describing herself as an \\"Air Force brat.\\" Her family lived for a few years in Turkey as well. She graduated from Russellville High School, where she was a member of the cheerleader squad. Following her graduation from high school, Kelley attended Rhodes College, where she focused on the fields of communication and English. In 1988, Kelley met Rand Paul at a backyard oyster roast in Atlanta. Rand Paul was completing a surgical rotation at Georgia Baptist Hospital while working on his medical degree at the Duke University School of Medicine. At first Kelley thought that Rand was a teenager, and unaware that he was actually a 26-year-old doctor. They began dating while Paul completed his rotation program, and Rand asked Kelley to move back with him to North Carolina and try to find a job in the Durham area so that they could continue being together. On October 20, 1990, the couple married, and eventually moved to Kentucky in 1993 when an ophthalmologist position opened up in the city of Bowling Green. Kelley would go on to help her husband with producing newsletters and mailings for his practice, running the payroll, keeping the books, and managing a remodel of the building where he saw patients. Later career Kelley Paul introducing her husband at his Presidential announcement in Louisville, Kentucky. Leading up to her husband's election to the United States Senate, Kelley began freelance writing, and focusing more on her own career as a private citizen. In addition, she also worked for the political consulting firm The Strategy Group for Media, with one of her clients being then-U.S. Senate candidate Ted Cruz of Texas. She also maintains a board position at Helping a Hero, a charity that builds houses for wounded war veterans. During her husband's campaign, Kelley Paul also gave political speeches on behalf of her husband, including speaking to Republican women's groups, and participating in commercial advertisements on behalf of his campaign. In the lead up to Rand Paul's decision to run for President of the United States, Kelley began writing a book focused on her long lasting friendships, as well as her own family history titled True and Constant Friends: Love and Inspiration from Our Grandmothers, Mothers, and Friends. Many political consultants have referred to Kelley Paul as Senator Paul's \\"secret weapon\\". and describing her as a \\"very confident person, very comfortable, and she complements well.\\" Kelley played a key role in the decision regarding whether her husband would seek the office of the Presidency, but stated that it was a much easier decision than deciding to run for U.S. Senate in mid-2009. In late September 2015, Kelley filed for her husband to appear on the ballot in the South Carolina primary. In January 2016, after Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton came under criticism for her husband Bill Clinton's past relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky, Kelley said in an interview that Bill Clinton was \\"fair game\\" since he had become involved with his wife's campaign and that while it may not have been just, \\"I think we all know that's the way it is in politics now\\". It was reported that she would be joining her husband in touring Iowa that month in an effort to garner more support for his campaign. In 2018 Kelley advocated for passage of the First Step Act, meeting with senators and conducting public interviews (including appearing on Fox News) to try to build support for the bill. Kelley says she was enlightened on the need for criminal justice reform by her husband Rand and father-in-law Ron Paul, whose advocacy \\"opened [her] eyes to the extent of how bad our system is broken and how people are suffering through that\\".

The location of his body was discovered in 1977, 8 years after his death. Manson family leader Charles Manson and family members Steve \\"Clem\\" Grogan and Bruce M. Davis were eventually convicted of murdering Shea. Tex Watson, Bill Vance, and Larry Bailey (alias Larry Giddings) were possible participants in the murder but were never charged. Life Donald Shea was born in Massachusetts on September 18, 1933. He moved to California to pursue a career in acting, but mostly worked at Spahn's Movie Ranch. Shea was a former stuntman whose dream was to pursue a film career in Hollywood, a dream which, according to many friends, he never gave up. He was almost 6 feet 4 inches (1.93m) tall. He worked as a bouncer, a ranch hand at Spahn Ranch, an old Hollywood movie set that had become a horse riding stables. His autopsy report identifies him as \\"foreman\\" of the ranch. Shea reportedly got along with the other ranch employees. When the Manson family moved into Spahn Ranch, Shea initially co-existed with them peacefully but, in time, Charles Manson began to look down on him because he had married a black woman by the name of Magdalena. Manson hated and mistrusted black people, and had been disgusted when Magdalena's friends showed up at the ranch. She stayed for only a few weeks before leaving Shea and returning to Las Vegas. According to Shea's autopsy report, Magdalena eventually settled in Lexington, Kentucky. Eventually Shea planned to help George Spahn remove the Family from the Spahn Ranch when their brushes with the law grew out of control.Bugliosi, Vincent. Helter Skelter, 1974, pp. 179‚Äì180 There is anecdotal evidence that Shea had a son with a woman named Judith Ellen Lawson, named either Ray or Roy, who died in infancy in 1960 in Hood County, Texas. Also, according to his autopsy report, Shea was a serviceman in the Air Force (s/n AF 11 270 704) from December 1954 until June 1956. Murder Shea was murdered on August 26, 1969. Manson had decided to have Shea killed because he believed Shea had reported them to the police, resulting in a raid on the ranch on August 16 where the family were taken into custody on suspicion of car theft. Family member Bruce Davis claimed that the decision to kill Shea came from Manson because he considered him to be a \\"snitch\\". Manson told Davis, Tex Watson, and Steve Grogan to ask for a ride to a nearby car parts yard on the ranch. According to Davis, he sat in the back seat with Grogan, who then hit Shea with a pipe wrench and Watson stabbed him. They brought Shea down a hill behind the ranch and stabbed and brutally tortured him to death. Bruce Davis recalled at his parole hearings: Another motive for the murder could have stemmed from a fight between Charles Manson and Shea at the Gresham Street home in Canoga Park, California, that Manson shared with Bill Vance and several Manson Family Members. Windy Bucklee, the wife of Spahn Ranch ranch hand Randy Starr was beaten by Charles Manson for her refusal to loan her truck to Manson and Vance for robberies. In the days prior, law enforcement questioned Bucklee for a string of robberies that her truck had been identified in. She realized that Manson and Vance had been borrowing her truck to commit these robberies and decided to quit loaning it to them. When Shea found out about Manson assaulting Bucklee, he went to the Gresham Street home and assaulted both Manson and Vance with threats to stay away from Spahn Ranch. After Manson moved into Spahn Ranch, Larry Bailey, one of the newer members of the Manson Family, was spying on Shea for Manson and was quickly caught. As a result, Shea, Bucklee, and others stripped Bailey naked and tied him to a tree facing the main road to send a message to the others. According to participants in Shea's murder, Bruce Davis and Steve \\"Clem\\" Grogan, both Bill Vance and Larry Bailey also participated in the killing.Windy Bucklee interview, Tate/LaBianca Radio by Brian Davis Cover-up and admission In a grand jury testimony, Family member Barbara Hoyt recounted hearing the screams which terrified her so much that she left deciding to escape the family, frightened that she might be next. Barbara Hoyt \\"It was about 10:00 pm when I heard a long, loud, blood curdling scream,\\" she said, \\"Then it went quiet for a minute or so and the screams came again and again, it seemed to go on forever, I have no doubt that Shorty was being murdered at that time.\\"Batbara HoytWhen Shea was dead, Grogan buried him, and the rumor was that he had been \\"dismembered into nine pieces.\\"City News Service, Neighbor Hoyt's testimony of the approximate time of Shea's murder contradicts the official stories given by participants Davis and Grogan at their parole hearings.Steve Grogan 1980 parole hearing; Bruce Davis 1994 parole hearing Windy Bucklee was recently interviewed and confirmed that Shea was not the type of person who would scream and beg, and would have gone to his death fighting.Barbara Hoyt On December 9, 1969, Shea's 1962 Mercury was found with a footlocker of his possessions and a pair of bloodstained cowboy boots belonging to him. A palm print of Davis was found on the footlocker. Remains located Shea's skeletal remains were discovered on a nondescript hillside near Santa Susana Road next to Spahn Ranch in December 1977 after Steve Grogan, one of those convicted of the murder, agreed to aid authorities in the recovery of Shea's body by drawing a map to its location. According to the autopsy report, his body suffered multiple stab and chopping wounds to the chest and blunt force trauma to the head.Autopsy of Donald Shea Sgt. Bill Gleason, LASO Homicide, Deputy Coroner John Mossberger and Deputy Sheriff Barry Jones, LASO Homicide, were on the site when Shea was exhumed in 1977. Gleason had been the officer who obtained the Spahn Ranch Raid search warrant in August 1969. Shea was 35 years old when he was murdered.Sanders, Ed. The Family. pp. 272‚Äì276.

Flowers large and showy, up to 17 cm wide, with sepals and petals being cream-colored or ivory white, except the lip or labellum, which is colored with yellow, rose and red. Sepals narrowly elliptic; petals ovate, elliptic or rhomboid; lip folded to form a tube, with very wavy front margin. Pollinia 4, with curved appendages. Cattleya rex. Habit.  Taxonomy  James O'Brien described the species for the first time in 1890 from a live flowering plant collected in the area of Moyobamba, San Mart√≠n by Mr. Bungeroth and cultivated at L'Horticulture International, Brussels, by Mr. L. Linden. That was the first known flowering plant outside the native habitat of C. rex.  Distribution and habitat  C. rex is known from a few localities in the regions of San Martin and Puno in Peru and the department of La Paz in Bolivia. It occurs in montane forests and low montane seasonally dry forests at 800‚Äì2500 m, growing on tree branches.  Ecology  In its native habitat, flowering occurs between December and March.  Conservation  Cattleya rex has been assigned an endangered conservation status in 1997 by the IUCN. Previously believed to be a Peruvian endemic, in 2013 a new locality was reported in Bolivia, thus increasing the area of extension for the species.  Cultivation  C. rex requires a temperate climate (in winter, artificial heating set at 16 ¬∞C at night and 18 ¬∞C during the day is recommended) and good ventilation (a dark and enclosed environment will attract fungi or bacterial diseases). This species does not tolerate dryness for long periods, so watering must be done regularly and should be reduced in frequency during winter. However, the growing medium (cork slabs, baskets or pots) must have good drainage, so the roots can dry properly after watering or root rot may appear. Light requirements are high but not direct sunlight. Shade is needed during summer and brightest days of other seasons (especially if leaves turn yellow). Humidity must be between 50-70%, it can be achieved with the help of misters or humidifiers.

He, with one-armed George Musey, led the Downtown Gang, one of the two gangs which controlled most of the Galveston Crime Syndicate until the early 1930s. They fought for control of the island against the rival Beach Gang led by Ollie Quinn and Dutch Voight. As the prohibition era began, his gang came to be one of the dominant forces in the Galveston Crime Syndicate. Galveston became the main port of entry for liquor supply in Texas and many parts of the Midwest. Nounes' flamboyance attracted the attention of federal authorities, leading to his conviction in 1924 and sentencing to Leavenworth Penitentiary.Haile (1998), p. 15. \\"Johnny Jack‚Äôs free-spending flamboyance earned him folk-hero status among tolerant Galvestonians but also attracted the attention of federal agents, who succeeded in sending him to Leavenworth in 1924.\\" His prison term was short but only two years after being released he was again sentenced to prison after being caught with a shipment of liquor in Seabrook.Haile (1998), p. 15. \\"Less than two years after his triumphant return, Nounes and partner Musey were caught red-handed at Seabrook with a boatload of booze.\\" Frank Nitti, a business partner of Nounes, went on to become the \\"enforcer\\" for Al Capone's crime organization in Chicago as well as the future boss of the Chicago Outfit.Cartwright (1998), pg. 210. Family and early life Johnny Jack Nounes was born John Louis Nonus in Galveston, Texas, to Emanuel and Angelica Nonus, both immigrants from Portugal. They both immigrated to New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1872 and married in Galveston soon after meeting. The Nonus family had fifteen children but six died at infancy; the remaining nine were Mary, Lyda, Annie, Mellie, Lily, Beatrice, Mabel, Johnny, and Francis. In 1900, the 1900 Galveston hurricane hit the island. During this devastating storm, Emanuel managed to break a hole in the house's ceiling in order to get all the children to safety; Johnny was ten years old. One of Johnny's earliest jobs was a butcher. At the end of the day he would save all of the meat scraps and would give to his younger brother Francis so that he could take it home to the family. The family was struggling on hard times and so they would eat whatever they could get. Around 1914 Johnny changed his last name from \\"Nonus\\" to \\"Nounes\\" because he rounded up the Downtown Gang a few years earlier and didn't want to ruin his family name as well as releasing it to rivals, and so that how his name was born, Johnny Jack Nounes. With his early crime life, he was probably most associated with gambling and prostitution while being in competition with the Beach Gang led by Dutch Voight and Ollie Quinn.url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RFRu8kYThEcC Prohibition As prohibition of alcohol started to take its toll in the early 1920s, Nounes grew the gang with soldiers and went to work rum-running. During this time a young Syrian named George Musey stepped into the picture. He became Nounes' right-hand man, running the Downtown Gang with him. Among the earliest gang members were Theodore \\"Fatty\\" Owens, Otis Skains, Mitchell \\"Mitch\\" Frankovitch, Kye Gregory, Morris \\"Kid\\" Ross, Joe Varnell, Lawrence \\"King Coal\\" Balkey, and Tom Lera. The gang was stronger than ever with Nounes and Musey leading. Their midnight travels through rum-row made them more money than ever; Nounes soon became a millionaire because of his guts and his boat. Johnny owned a boat called the Cherokee which had an airplane engine installed in it and so it could out run any federal prohibition agent that tried to catch it. That boat was loaded with many cases of liquor from the Bahamas, Cuba, and Jamaica. Prostitution and gambling was now a side business operating in his clubs downtown. Among his first notable customer was Frank Nitti, who met Nounes back in 1917 before prohibition. Nitti would come down from the Chicago Outfit to meet with Johnny Jack in order to conduct business dealing with liquor. Southern gangsters attracted a lot of northern gangster because of their direct access to the Gulf of Mexico. Frank Nitti later became a regular customer of Nounes and friend to his brother Francis. Francis lost his job at the Santa Fe Railroad at the start of the Great Depression, and so Johnny gave him a job bar tending at one of his speakeasys. Therefore, Frank would give furniture and other lavish gifts to the Nonus boys because he liked and respected them very much. Johnny Jack had the island in his pocket he had the money coming in from the booze, gambling, and prostitution. He would even hijack the Beach Gang's shipments and cheat the Cubans out of thinking soap coupons were money for buying booze. If anyone gave him any lip he would beat them with his gold-headed cane. He had all the popular gangster of the time looking at him from Chicago's Al Capone to New York's Arnold Rothstein. He was a funny flamboyant man who liked to be the center of attention. He would carry around a bundle of $100 bills and would give them to anybody in need. He would drive around in his fancy cars and buy toys for the kids around town on Christmas. He made a lot but he gave a lot. \\"Beau Brummell of Galveston\\" Therefore, New York's society was looking at this flashy prominent mobster head of the Galveston Crime Syndicate. Nounes took a trip up to New York City and threw a $40,000 party at the Hotel Pennsylvania. Many gangster and Hollywood actresses attended. Among some of them were Clara Bow and Nancy Carroll, who were both said to have bathed in tubs filled with champagne. His character and personality attracted starlets, therefore, Johnny also dated actress Theda Bara for a short time around 1919-1920, with her also having a champagne filled bath. He had his suits custom-tailored in New York while having an apartment over looking Central Park for when he went up to conduct business and throw one of his extravagant parties. Johnny had some great times, however he come to face the trials that would come ahead of him. Trials and prison Nounes was convicted in 1924 due to bootlegging. He received up to two years in Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary. When Judge J. C. Hutcheson fined him $5,000, he grinned at him and said \\"Hell, Judge, I've got that much in my right pocket!\\" Nounes called Leavenworth his home for two years. However, after being released he met with his right-hand man George Musey. They took the gang on a run and were unloading the booze at Seabrook, Texas, and were caught by agents. Nounes was then tried over the next two years and was sentenced to two years in Atlanta Federal Penitentiary in 1929. J.C. Hutcheson stated that Nounes has bothered him more than any other person in his district. Post-prohibition and later life Soon after Nounes's release, around the time prohibition was ending, Chicago Outfit boss Frank Nitti was looking for new money. He stole $24,000 from Johnny Jack and opposing mobster Dutch Voight. However, Johnny Jack and Voight found Nitti at a Houston bar one night. They then high-tailed him back to the island where they talked over a nice plate of spaghetti on Seawall Boulevard. Johnny then confronted him that it would either be his money or his brains next to that plate of spaghetti. The next day Nitti forked over the $24,000 and was riding a train back to Chicago never to be seen in Galveston again. Furthermore, Sam and Rose Maceo Maceo have taken over the Beach Gang and the Galveston crime underworld during Nounes' absence. They established the Maceo Crime Syndicate and would come to take control of the island. Therefore, Johnny would go on to own clubs selling booze like he always has with a little gambling going on the side. He would then run for mayor of West Beach, Galveston, Texas and win in 1947. He also ran for mayor in Pirates Beach, Galveston, in the early 1960s and won again. His stardom and flamboyance were a vital role in his career with politics. Health problems and death By the late 1960s Nounes had lost both of his legs due to diabetes. Nounes died on March 11, 1970, at St. Mary's Hospital, Galveston. One of his pallbearers at his funeral was mobster Dutch Voight. He is buried at Calvary Catholic Cemetery.

(Some Australian state herbaria continue to use the name Callistemon brachyandrus.) It is a shrub or small tree with narrow leaves and showy red and green flowers making it an ideal ornamental plant in temperate areas. Description Melaleuca brachyandra is a shrub growing to tall with hard bark and a rigid habit. Its leaves are arranged alternately and are long, wide, linear in shape, kidney- shaped in cross section and with the end tapering to a sharp point. The flowers are arranged in spikes on the ends of branches that continue to grow after flowering. The spikes are up to in diameter with 7 to 36 individual flowers. The petals are long and fall off as the flower ages. There are 50 to 84 stamens in each flower, with their \\"stalks\\" (the filaments) rich crimson and \\"tips\\" (the anthers) green. Flowering occurs from September to January and is followed by fruits that are woody capsules, long. Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca brachyandra was first formally described in 2006 by Lyndley Craven in Novon. It had previously been known as Callistemon brachyandrus since John Lindley described it in 1849 in Journal of the Horticultural Society of London. The specific epithet (brachyandra) is derived from the ancient Greek words brachys (Œ≤œÅŒ±œáœçœÇ), meaning \\"short\\" and anƒìr, genitive andros (·ºÄŒΩŒÆœÅ, genitive ·ºÄŒΩŒ¥œÅœåœÇ), meaning \\"male\\",Backer, C.A.

He also played professional football in the early years of the National Football League for the Cleveland Indians (1923) and Buffalo Bisons (1924). Biography Huffman Huffman was a native of Chandlersville, Ohio. He enrolled in the medical college at the Ohio State University and played college football and baseball. Though he had never played football before enrolling at Ohio State, Huffman played four years of varsity football for the Buckeyes. Freshmen were eligible to play football in 1918 due to the exigency of World War I. As a result, Huffman reportedly played for Ohio State's football team in \\"every quarter of every game save one\\" in the four years from 1918-1921. At the conclusion of his career at Ohio State, he was \\"hailed as probably the greatest tackle in Buckeye history.\\" Iolas Huffman and Archie Griffin As captain of the 1920 football team, Huffman led the Buckeyes to a Western Conference championship. In the 1920 game against Michigan, he blocked a punt by All-American Frank Steketee, which the Buckeyes recovered in Michigan's endzone for a touchdown, the key play in Ohio State's 14-7 win. Huffman was selected as a first-team All-American by syndicated sports writer Lawrence Perry in 1920 and 1921. In 1921, he was selected as a first-team All-American tackle by Football World, based on the collected opinions of 267 coaches. After Ohio State lost to California, 28-0, in the 1921 Rose Bowl, Huffman told reporters, \\"We were defeated, but at the same time we are not downhearted. I admit that we seemed to lack our usual pep but I do not believe that California is twenty-eight points better than Ohio.

He was known as \\"a deadly thrower to bases\\", and few ballplayers in the Western Conference attempted to steal bases on Huffman. He had one of the best batting averages on the Ohio State team, and in 1921 he led Ohio State in stolen bases. Huffman was offered a tryout as a catcher with Major League Baseball's Cleveland Indians in 1920, and in 1922 the St. Louis Browns offered him a contract as to play for them as a catcher. He played for the Zanesville Greys during the summer of 1922, but at the end of July he decided to give up baseball for the rest of the season because of a sore arm that had kept him on the bench for several weeks.

Constantinople, formally named Nova Roma, was founded in the city of Byzantium (), which is the origin of the historiographical name for the Eastern Empire, which self-identified simply as the \\"Roman Empire\\". Prelude to the creation of the Byzantine Empire  Economic strife  In the 3rd century, the Roman Empire suffered troubling economic difficulties that spread over a wide portion of its provinces. Drastic decreases in population throughout the western parts of the Empire, along with a general degradation of society within the cities exacerbated the crisis, leading to a shortage of labor. The latifundia, or great estates, added to the troubles by forcing many of the smaller estates out of the market, which bled more labor from the labor force in order to sustain their estates. In the East, although there was a labor shortage, the population problem was not nearly as acute, rendering it stronger and more able to withstand a serious crisis. The West, in its reaction to the economic hardships that resulted in very high prices, had gone to a barter system to survive. In contrast, the East had chosen to depend upon gold coinage for the most part, creating a very reliable means by which to sustain itself.  Administrative reforms  The Roman emperors Diocletian and Constantine I both played an important role in reforming the organization of the whole Empire. The Empire in its entirety had become difficult to control, and Diocletian resolved this by creating a tetrarchy that allowed for Augusti to rule in each of the western and eastern halves of the Empire, while two Caesars would be their seconds. In case of the loss of either Augusti, the Caesar would take their place, and a new Caesar would be selected. The only significant change made by Constantine to this system was the replacement of the selection of Caesars with a succession by bloodline. To alleviate the concerns of territorial administration, Diocletian divided the whole of the Empire into one hundred distinct provinces. Administrative control was brought under the auspices of the Emperor, and the whole of Italia was relegated to the status of a regular province, now also compelled to pay taxes. Each province was assigned to a diocese, twelve in total. Constantine organized the provinces even further by creating prefectures, each one consisting of several dioceses, and each diocese consisting of several provinces. The Praetorian prefecture of the East (Praefectura praetorio per Orientem) was made up of five dioceses- Aegyptus, Oriens, Pontus, Asiana, and Thracia. This enabled the Empire to harness the control of each prefecture by providing a distinct difference between military and civil administration.  Military threats and the division of the Empire  Focus from the West to the East had been shifting over the course of the last century due to previously mentioned economic strength of the usage of gold coinage and a stronger populace. The defensive situation under Diocletian, however, had changed considerably in the East. The Persian Sassanids had grown more menacing in their quest for previous territory, and the barbarians were becoming a more serious problem along the lower part of the Danube. Judging the threats to be of dire importance, Diocletian took up residence in Nicomedia, where he established his capital there, leaving Maximian, his co-Emperor, in charge of the West. Constantine I, 324‚Äì337 Constantine was acclaimed as emperor by the army at Eboracum (modern-day York) after his father's death in 306 AD, and he emerged victorious in a series of civil wars against Emperors Maxentius and Licinius to become sole ruler of both west and east by 324 AD. The age of Constantine marked a distinct epoch in the history of the Roman Empire.Gregory, A History of Byzantium, 49. He built a new imperial residence at Byzantium and renamed the city Constantinople after himself. This marks the beginning of Byzantine history. As emperor, Constantine enacted administrative, financial, social, and military reforms to strengthen the empire. He restructured the government, separating civil and military authorities. To combat inflation he introduced the solidus, a new gold coin that became the standard for Byzantine and European currencies for more than a thousand years. The Roman army was reorganised to consist of mobile field units and garrison soldiers capable of countering internal threats and barbarian invasions. Constantine pursued successful campaigns against the tribes on the Roman frontiers‚Äîthe Franks, the Alamanni, the Goths, and the Sarmatians‚Äîeven resettling territories abandoned by his predecessors during the Crisis of the Third Century. Constantine was the first Roman emperor to convert to Christianity. He called the First Council of Nicaea in 325 that produced the statement of Christian belief known as the Nicene Creed. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre was built on his orders at the purported site of Jesus' tomb in Jerusalem and became the holiest place in Christendom. Constantius II, 337‚Äì361 Constantius II was the second son of Constantine I and Fausta and he ascended to the throne with his brothers Constantine II and Constans upon their father's death. In 340, Constantius' brothers clashed over the western provinces of the empire. The resulting conflict left Constantine II dead and Constans as ruler of the west until he was overthrown and assassinated in 350 by the usurper Magnentius. Unwilling to accept Magnentius as co-ruler, Constantius defeated him at the battles of Mursa Major and Mons Seleucus. Magnentius committed suicide after the latter battle, leaving Constantius as sole ruler of the empire. His subsequent military campaigns against Germanic tribes were successful: he defeated the Alamanni in 354 and campaigned across the Danube against the Quadi and Sarmatians in 357. In contrast, the war in the east against the Sassanids continued with mixed results. In 351, due to the difficulty of managing the empire alone, Constantius elevated his cousin Constantius Gallus to the subordinate rank of Caesar, but had him executed three years later after receiving scathing reports of his violent and corrupt nature. Shortly thereafter, in 355, Constantius promoted his last surviving cousin, Gallus' younger half-brother, Julian, to the rank of Caesar. However, Julian claimed the rank of Augustus in 360, leading to war between the two. Ultimately, no battle was fought as Constantius became ill and died late in 361, though not before naming Julian as his successor. Julian, 361‚Äì363 In 363, Julian embarked on an ambitious campaign against the Sassanid Empire. The campaign was initially successful, securing a victory outside Ctesiphon, but later the Persians flooded the area behind him and Julian took a risky decision to withdraw up the valley of the Tigris River, and eventually during a skirmish Julian was mortally wounded, leaving his army trapped in Persian territory. Following his death, the Roman forces were obliged to cede territory in order to escape, including the fortress city of Nisibis. Julian was a man of unusually complex character: he was \\"the military commander, the theosophist, the social reformer, and the man of letters\\".Glanville Downey, \\"Julian the Apostate at Antioch\\", Church History, Vol. 8, No. 4 (December, 1939), pp. 303‚Äì315. See p. 305. He was the last non-Christian ruler of the Roman Empire, and he believed that it was necessary to restore the Empire's ancient Roman values and traditions in order to save it from dissolution. He purged the top- heavy state bureaucracy, and attempted to revive traditional Roman religious practices at the expense of Christianity. Julian also forbade the Christians from teaching classical texts and learning. His rejection of Christianity, and his promotion of Neoplatonic Hellenism in its place caused him to be remembered as Julian the Apostate by the church. Jovian, 363‚Äì364 Jovian was Emperor from 363 to 364. Upon the death of Julian during his campaign against the Sassanid Empire, Jovian was hastily declared emperor by his soldiers. He sought peace with the Persians on humiliating terms and reestablished Christianity as the state church of the Roman Empire. His reign lasted only eight months. Valens, 364‚Äì378 Valens was Emperor from 364 to 378. He was given the eastern half of the empire by his brother Valentinian I after the latter's accession to the throne. Valens was defeated and killed in the Battle of Adrianople, which marked the beginning of the collapse of the Western Roman Empire. \\"Valens was utterly undistinguished, still only a protector, and possessed no military ability: he betrayed his consciousness of inferiority by his nervous suspicion of plots and savage punishment of alleged traitors,\\" writes A.H.M. Jones. But Jones admits that \\"he was a conscientious administrator, careful of the interests of the humble. Like his brother, he was an earnest Christian.\\"Jones, Arnold Hugh Martin, The Later Roman Empire, 284‚Äì602: A Social, Economic and Administrative Survey (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University, 1986), p. 139. He diminished the oppressive burden of the taxes which had been instituted by Constantine and his sons, and was humbly deferential to his brother in the latter's edicts of reform, as the institution of Defensors (a sort of substitute for the ancient Tribunes, guardians of the lower classes).

An enhanced port of the original game for iOS and Android devices, titled Dariusburst Second Prologue, was released on February 10, 2012,http://app.famitsu.com/20120122_24136/ and October 24, 2015 in North America. An enhanced port of Another Chronicle, titled Dariusburst Chronicle Saviours, was released for PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, and Microsoft Windows (through Steam) in December 2015.http://gematsu.com/2015/08/darius- burst-chronicle-saviours-announced-ps4-ps-vita-pc Plot Dariusburst takes place a century after Darius II where the planet Darius is continually attacked by the Belser Army. The continuing battles show a possible end to the long wars on Darius, particularly with the development of the Burst System, a powerful new weapon equipped with the latest Silver Hawk fighters. Using this new weapon system are pilots Riga Pratica, test pilot of the Silver Hawk Burst series; and Ti2, a computer AI assuming the body of a young girl. Together, the pilots fight back against the Belser Army's fleets, factories, and even its previously inhabited fortresses. Gameplay The gameplay and flow maintains the consistency of previous Darius games: players fight the Belsar Army through several stages and can choose to fight in different zones along different paths, ultimately reaching a different final boss and ending. Players can upgrade the firepower of their Silver Hawk space fighter with power-ups that affect the ship's main firepower, secondary missiles and shield as well as additional power-ups that add to player's score, extends or destroys every enemy on screen. The main differences include ship selection, the Burst System and the effect of weapons on enemy fire. Players have three types of main firepower to upgrade starting with Missile, Laser and ending in Wave Shot. As the ship receives further upgrades, the weapon placement will move up from Missile to Laser and Wave. However, many enemies throughout the game use similar shots and the player can destroy enemy shots depending on what they are. When using the Missile Shot, the Silver Hawk can destroy enemy missile shots and the same effect stands with Laser shots. The Wave shot however is consistent throughout the Darius series in its ability to fire through solid foreground objects. The Burst System allows the player to unleash a powerful beam attack that can be positioned to fire in several directions. By tapping and holding the appropriate fire button, players can direct the Burst beam in any forward firing direction. The player can also fire their main shot while the Burst Beam is going, but doing so will keep the Beam in a fixed position. The Burst System is unique in that is recharged every time the Silver Hawk destroys something; whether it's an enemy ship, similar enemy shot or destructible object, the drained Burst meter will be replenished upon that object's destruction. However, the Belser Army has managed to reverse engineer the Burst System, allowing them access to this weapon for their larger battleships. Thus, similar to the Beam Duels of G-Darius and Metal Black, players can duel bosses armed with the Burst System. The player can select one of eight different Silver Hawks in both Another Chronicle and Chronicle Saviours; in the original DariusBurst, three ships are usable: The Silver Hawk Legend, Next and Origin. The Legend is a standard Silver Hawk model that is able to use the Burst System while the Next is physically redesigned and is equipped with homing missiles rather than air-to- ground bombs. The Origin on the other hand is based on original Silver Hawk models, and thus lacks the Burst System; it uses the same loadout as the Silver Hawk from the original Darius. In Dariusburst SP, the Silver Hawk Assault uses homing bombs rather than air-to-ground bombs and deploys gravity bombs instead of a beam for its Burst. Both Another Chronicle and Chronicle Saviours introduces a new Burst Beam ship, the Formula Silver Hawk Burst, which uses a Burst Beam like Legend and Next but can only hit enemies with normal fire from a short distance; the Second Silver Hawk (which is based on Darius II), Gaiden Silver Hawk (which is based on Darius Gaiden and uses its Black Hole Bomb in place of a Burst Beam), and Genesis Silver Hawk (which is based on G-Darius and has similar beam-dueling mechanics to that game) are also available.

It is spoken by Queen Gertrude in response to the insincere overacting of a character in the play within a play created by Prince Hamlet to prove his uncle's guilt in the murder of his father, the King of Denmark. The phrase is used in everyday speech to indicate doubt concerning someone's sincerity in their expressed disapproval of something. A common misquotation places methinks first, as in \\"methinks the lady doth protest too much\\". In Hamlet The line, like most of Shakespeare's works, is in iambic pentameter. It is found in Act III, Scene II of Hamlet, where it is spoken by Queen Gertrude, Hamlet's mother. Hamlet believes that his father, the king, was murdered by his uncle Claudius (who then married Gertrude). Hamlet decides to stage a play, the Murder of Gonzago, that follows a similar sequence of events, in order to test whether viewing it will trigger a guilty conscience on the part of Claudius. As Hamlet, Gertrude, Claudius and others watch the play-within-the-play, the Player Queen, representing Gertrude, declares in flowery language that she will never remarry if her husband dies. Hamlet then turns to his mother and asks her, \\"Madam, how like you this play?\\", to which she replies ironically, \\"The lady doth protest too much, methinks\\", meaning that the Player Queen's protestations of love and fidelity are too excessive to be believed. The quotation comes from the Second Quarto edition of the play. Later versions contain the simpler line, \\"The lady protests too much, methinks\\". Later usage The line's allusion to Gertrude's (lack of) fidelity to her husband has become a clich√© of sexually fickle womanhood and a shorthand expression conveying doubt in a person's sincerity, even when the subject is male. As in the play, it is commonly used to imply that someone who denies something very strongly is hiding the truth. It is often shortened to \\"[X] protest[s] too much\\", or misquoted with methinks at the beginning, as in \\"methinks the lady doth protest too much\\".

Early life Ruslan was born in Uman, Ukraine to a Jewish family on November 4, 1980. His father, Yefim, who was an active local guitarist, introduced him to music at an early age. Picking up guitar around the age of four, Ruslan transitioned to piano around the age of seven. In 1990, his family moved to Israel, where he continued to study piano at the Bat-Yam music school. At approximately 14, Ruslan discovered jazz, instantly showing interest. By the age of 16, he was the \\"wunderkind\\" keyboardist for the then-popular Israeli jazz fusion band, \\"Confusion\\". With Confusion, he toured Israel and made several appearances at the Red Sea Jazz Festival. At 18, Ruslan auditioned for the Berklee College of Music, where he received full tuition scholarship, and moved to Boston in January 2000. During his studies at Berklee, Ruslan displayed growing interest in R&B;, funk and soul music, playing with local artists and eventually becoming the resident keyboardist in a club called \\"Wally's Jazz Caf√©\\". Later life and career Circa 2004, Ruslan joined the Stanley Clarke band and moved to Los Angeles, thus marking the beginning of his professional career. Since then, Ruslan has been touring, performing and recording with major artists (in addition to Clarke), such as Black Eyed Peas, Kamasi Washington, Seal, Josh Groban, Ne-Yo, Thundercat, Chick Corea, George Duke, Marcus Miller, Al Jarreau, Victor Wooten, Eric Ben√©t, Rachelle Ferrell, Larry Carlton, Los Angeles Philharmonic and countless others. Ruslan released his self-titled debut album, featuring Clarke, Corea and George Duke as special guests, on October 24, 2011. The album was produced by Ruslan and Clarke, recorded at Clarke's production company, Roxboro Entertainment Group, mixed by Yan Perchuk at Vibrant Productions, released on Bungalo Records and distributed by Universal Music Group Distribution. Ruslan is also a board member of the Magic Music Foundation, a non-profit organization devoted to granting scholarships to music students worldwide, regardless of their choice of music teachers and/or schools.

Eliot, whom she married in 1915, while he was studying at Oxford. Haigh-Wood had always suffered from serious health problems, compounded by insecurity about her social class. It is clear that her disastrous marriage worsened her condition. Eliot would not consider divorce, but formally separated from her in 1933. She was committed to an asylum and eventually died there, apparently from a heart attack, but possibly an overdose. They were never compatible; he seems to have been seeking a pretext to stay in England, in defiance of his family, by marrying an English bride. Their tortured marriage is often cited as the inspiration for The Waste Land, which remains his most noted work. Research into their relationship has been hampered by lack of access to her diaries, whose copyright was granted to Eliot‚Äôs widow Valerie. Early life Haigh-Wood in 1921 Haigh-Wood was born in Knowsley Street, Bury, Lancashire,Gordon 2009. the first child of Rose Esther (n√©e Robinson 1860‚Äì1941) and Charles Haigh-Wood (1854‚Äì1927), an artist and member of the Royal Academy of Arts.Charles Heigh-Wood, Artnet, accessed 9 November 2009. Charles was local to the area, but his wife was born in London where the couple had been living, and they had returned to Bury for an exhibition of Charles's paintings at a gentleman's club, with Rose Esther heavily pregnant. The journey may have triggered the birth earlier than expected, and Haigh-Wood was born in Lancashire rather than London.Gordon 1998, p. 114. She was registered at birth as Vivienne Haigh, though as an adult she called herself Haigh-Wood. Her paternal grandfather was Charles Wood, a gilder and picture framer from Bolton, so her father called himself Charles Haigh-Wood to distinguish himself. The \\"Haigh\\" came from his mother, Mary Haigh, originally from Dublin. Mary Haigh had inherited seven semi- detached houses in Kingstown (now D√∫n Laoghaire), a Dublin suburb, which gave the family financial stability, allowing Haigh-Wood's father to study at the Manchester Art College and the Royal Academy Schools in London. Charles Haigh- Wood inherited his mother's property when she died, as well as the family home at 14 Albion Place, Walmersley Road, Bury, and he became a landlord, which allowed him to move his wife and Haigh-Wood to Hampstead, a fashionable part of north London. They settled into a house there at 3 Compayne Gardens around 1891.Seymour-Jones 2001. Haigh-Wood's brother, Maurice, was born there in 1896; he went on to train at Sandhurst and fought during the First World War. Although the family was clearly well-to-do, Seymour-Jones writes that Haigh- Wood was ashamed of her connection to Lancashire, perceived as working-class, and was left with a sense of inferiority that made her self-conscious and snobbish, especially when mixing with Eliot's aristocratic London friends. Health and education Little is known of her education. She played the piano, painted, took ballet lessons, was a good swimmer, and worked for a short time as a governess for a family in Cambridge. She had multiple health problems. She was diagnosed with tuberculosis of the bone in her left arm when she was a child; this was before the discovery of antibiotics and apparently little could be done about it. She was treated by Sir Frederick Treves and said she had had so many operations, she had no memory of her life before the age of seven.Seymour-Jones 2001, p. 14. She was also plagued by heavy, irregular menstruation, to her great embarrassment, and severe pre-menstrual tension, which led to mood swings, fainting spells, and migraines. She would insist on washing her own bedlinen, often twice a day, and would take her sheets home with her to clean when on holiday, once leading a hotel to claim she had stolen them, to Eliot's dismay. She apparently felt unable to ask her mother for help. Eventually her mother took her to a doctor who prescribed potassium bromide to sedate her, which probably meant he had diagnosed \\"hysteria,\\" a common label for difficult women. Virginia Woolf described Haigh-Wood on 8 November 1930 in her diary: > Oh ‚Äì Vivienne! Was there ever such a torture since life began! ‚Äì to bear her > on one's shoulders, biting, wriggling, raving, scratching, unwholesome, > powdered, insane, yet sane to the point of insanity, reading his letters, > thrusting herself on us, coming in wavering trembling ... This bag of > ferrets is what Tom [Eliot] wears round his neck.Woolf 1981, p. 331, cited > in Miller 2005, p. 378. As the medical bills rose, so did her family's resentment of her. Her brother, Maurice, blamed her for what he saw as his second-rate education, because there was no money left to send him to public school.Seymour-Jones, pp. 16‚Äì17. She became engaged to a schoolteacher, Charles Buckle, in 1914, but Buckle's mother was apparently unhappy about it. Haigh-Wood's health problems persuaded Rose Haigh-Wood that her daughter was suffering from \\"moral insanity.\\" She decided that Haigh-Wood should not marry or bear children, and withdrew the family's consent to the marriage.Seymour-Jones 2001, pp. 24‚Äì26. Relationship with T.S. Eliot First meeting Haigh-Wood met Tom Eliot in or around March 1915 at a dance in London, where he took tea with her and a friend.Miller 2005, p. 217. They met again shortly after that at a lunch party in Scofield Thayer's rooms at Magdalen College, Oxford. Eliot and Thayer, both from privileged New England backgrounds, had been at Harvard together, where Eliot had studied philosophy, and both had arrived in Oxford on scholarships. According to another friend of Eliot's, Sacheverell Sitwell, Eliot had noticed Haigh-Wood earlier, punting on the River Cherwell. Seymour-Jones writes that Oxford attracted young women visitors, or \\"river girls\\", who would come in search of eligible husbands; women were not allowed to take degrees at Oxford until 1920.A brief history of the University, University of Oxford, accessed 10 November 2009. Lyndall Gordon writes that Eliot was jolted to life by Haigh-Wood. He was a repressed, shy, 26-year-old who was bored in Oxford, writing of it that it was very pretty, \\"but I don't like to be dead.\\" She was flamboyant, a great dancer, spoke her mind, smoked in public, dressed in bold colours and looked like an actress. Impressed by her apparently wealthy background, the artist father and the brother at Sandhurst, he failed to realise that, within the rigid English class system, Haigh-Wood was no match for his New England background or for the English aristocrats with whom he had surrounded himself. A few of his friends, including Aldous Huxley, said they liked Haigh-Wood precisely because she was vulgar. For her part, she fell in love with Eliot, seeing in him what she described as \\"the call to the wild that is in men.\\"Seymour-Jones (Observer), 14 October 2001. Marriage Photograph from Haigh-Wood's American passport, 1920 Eliot was in Oxford for one year only, and was expected to return to Harvard to begin a career as an academic philosopher, an idea he railed against. He wanted to be a poet. He had completed The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock in 1911, the poem that was to make his name when it was published in Chicago in 1915, and he saw remaining in England as a way to escape his parents' plans for him. When he was in his 60s, Eliot wrote that he had been immature and timid at the time, and probably in love with Emily Hale, a Bostonian he had had a relationship with in the United States. What he wanted from Haigh-Wood, he said, was a flirtation. But a meeting with the American poet Ezra Pound had persuaded him that the pursuit of poetry was possible, and marrying Haigh-Wood meant he could stay in England and avoid Harvard.Miller 2005, pp. 220 ff. Eliot told a friend, Conrad Aiken, that he wanted to marry and lose his virginity. The couple were married after three months, on 26 June 1915, at Hampstead Register Office in London, with Lucy Ely Thayer (Scofield's sister) and Haigh-Wood's aunt, Lillia C. Symes, as witnesses. Eliot signed \\"no occupation\\" on the certificate and described his father as a brick manufacturer.Miller 2005, p. 218. Neither of them told their parents. Separation Eliot arranged for a formal separation in February 1933 and thereafter shunned Haigh-Wood entirely, hiding from her and instructing his friends not to tell her where he was. She could not accept the end of the relationship. Her efforts to find him appeared to his friends to confirm that she was mentally ill. The last time she saw him was on 18 November 1935 at a Sunday Times Book Fair in Regent Street, London, where he was giving a talk. Carrying her dog, Polly, and three of his books, she arrived in clothes she had started wearing to performances of his plays: a British Union of Fascists uniform, black beret and black cape. She wrote in her diary: > I turned a face to him of such joy that no-one in that great crowd could > have had one moment's doubt. I just said, Oh Tom, & he seized my hand, & > said how do you do, in quite a loud voice. He walked straight on to the > platform then & gave a most remarkably clever, well thought out lecture. ... > I stood the whole time, holding Polly up high in my arms. Polly was very > excited & wild. I kept my eyes on Tom's face the whole time, & I kept > nodding my head at him, & making encouraging signs. He looked a little > older, more mature & smart, much thinner & not well or robust or rumbustious > at all. No sign of a woman's care about him. No cosy evenings with dogs and > gramophones I should say.Seymour-Jones 2001, pp. 547‚Äì548. As he signed copies of the books for her, she asked him, \\"Will you come back with me?\\" and he replied, \\"I cannot talk to you now,\\" then left with someone else. Eliot's attitude toward women Carole Seymour-Jones, one of Haigh- Wood's biographers, argues that there was a strong streak of misogyny in the way Eliot regarded Haigh-Wood. He wrote to a friend that Haigh-Wood had \\"an original mind, and I consider not at all a feminine one.\\"Seymour-Jones 2001. Louis Menand argues in The New Yorker that Eliot regarded women the way he regarded Jews, seeing both as responsible for irrationality and romanticism. He was uneasy with female sexuality ‚Äì which led Seymour-Jones to suspect he was gay ‚Äì which manifested itself both in his poetry and in his attitude toward Haigh-Wood's body. Menand writes that Eliot's work is replete with oversexed women, whom he saw as modern succubi, such as Grishkin in his \\"Whispers of Immortality\\" (1919).Menand (New Yorker) 2002. Legacy Carole Seymour-Jones writes that it was out of the turmoil of the marriage that Eliot produced The Waste Land, one of the 20th century's finest poems. Eliot's sister-in-law, Theresa, said of the relationship: \\"Vivienne ruined Tom as a man, but she made him as a poet.\\"Seymour-Jones 2001, pp. 4‚Äì5. Valerie Eliot, the poet's second wife (from 1957) claimed the copyright of Haigh-Wood's writings in 1984, including her private diaries, which has complicated the research into her role in Eliot's life.Seymour-Jones 2001, pp. 1‚Äì6. Writing Haigh-Wood wrote several stories and reviews for The Criterion, the literary magazine Eliot founded, using the pseudonyms FM, Fanny Marlow, Feiron Morris, Felise Morrison, and Irene Fassett.

His final two victories came on 5 and 15 February 1917, in both cases driving down an Albatros D.I over Gr√©villers, being wounded in action during the latter. In between, on 10 February, he had been appointed a flight commander with the temporary rank of captain. On 21 March he was shot down near Roupy whilst flying a Nieuport 17 with No. 40 Squadron and was wounded. For the action of 15 February he was awarded the Military Cross which was gazetted on 26 March 1917. His citation read: :Lieutenant (Temporary Captain) Hubert William Godfrey Jones, Welsh Regiment and Royal Flying Corps. ::\\"For conspicuous gallantry in action.

On 4 April 1923 Jones was posted to No. 41 Squadron, based at RAF Northolt. On 30 June 1923 the 4th Royal Air Force Display at Hendon was held before King George V, the Queen, and the Duke and Duchess of York. Jones was one of the three member RAF Northolt team which came second in the relay race. On 12 August 1924 in the Third King's Cup Round Britain Race, Jones piloted a Siddeley Siskin III with a 395 hp Siddeley \\"Jaguar\\" engine, entered by Sir Glynn Hamilton West. The course was about starting from Martlesham Heath and finishing at Lee-on-Solent. Jones was placed 4th out of 9 competitors. He was photographed alighting from his machine at Gosport, and later crossing the finishing line in the time of 7 hours 34 minutes 12 seconds under the caption, \\"The fastest machine in the King's Cup Race.\\" On 1 July 1925 Jones was promoted from flight lieutenant to squadron leader. On 3‚Äì4 July 1925 in the Fourth King's Cup Circuit of Britain Race, Jones piloted an Armstrong- Whitworth Siskin Mk.IV, entered by Sir Glynn Hamilton West. The handicap race started and finished in Croydon and comprised two circuits of Britain. Jones finished 2nd out of 14 competitors, and was photographed \\"receiving congratulations\\" under the caption, \\"He started in the race as a Flight- Lieutenant, and finished up as a Squadron-Leader!\\" On 4 July 1926 the 7th Royal Air Force Display at Hendon was held before the King and Queen of England, King Alfonso and the Queen of Spain, the Duke of York and the Secretary of State for Air Sir Samuel Hoare. The \\"event of the day\\" was \\"an exhibition of Group evolutions of two wings of three Fighter Squadrons of nine machines‚Äî54 in all.\\" Jones led No. 19 (Fighter) Squadron from Duxford flying Gloster Grebes. Flight said, \\"It was, without doubt, one of the most wonderful displays of skilful piloting that has yet been presented at any of the Displays\\". He also led No. 19 Squadron in a low-bombing competition involving an attack on a moving tank in which \\"several direct hits were scored\\". On 9‚Äì10 July 1926 in the Fifth King's Cup Air Race, Jones piloted a Martinsyde A.D.C.1 with a 395 hp Siddeley \\"Jaguar\\" engine, entered by Lt. Col. M. O. Darby.

On 30 June 1928 the 9th Royal Air Force Display at Hendon was held before King George V and the Queen, the King of Spain and the Duke of York and an estimated crowd of 150,000. Jones led No. 19 Squadron in a dive bombing display. Jones led No. 19 Squadron's Siskins in the Air Manouevres of August 1928. No. 19 was one of 12 fighter squadrons forming part of the defence force in the manoeuvres, \\"to test the efficiency of units and to teach lessons in co-ordination of air and ground defence, flying organization, spotting arrangements, fighting tactics etc.\\" On 18 October 1928 Jones assumed the surname of Penderel, and two days later, on 20 October, was posted to No. 216 Squadron in the Middle East. On 30 March 1929 at All Saints' Cathedral, Cairo, he married Aetheldreda Mary, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Luxton Loney, of Ocean Avenue, Edgecliff. In 1931 he petitioned the High Court for nullity of marriage. Between 12 January and 7 February 1931, Penderel commanded a formation of three No. 216 Squadron Vickers Victoria troop carriers on a flight from their base at RAF Heliopolis, Cairo, to Cape Town, South Africa, where he was welcomed by the Governor-General the Earl of Clarendon and Lady Clarendon. Despite continual drenching rain between Nairobi and Pretoria, and one or two forced landings, the flight was deemed a success, and the aircraft began the return flight on 11 February. On 3 June 1931 Penderel was awarded the Air Force Cross which, on 25 June 1931, was conferred on him by King George V at Buckingham Palace. On 15 July 1931 in the Hanworth‚ÄìBlackpool Air Race, Penderel piloted a Spartan Arrow, entered by Colonel Louis Strange, finishing 1st out of 14 competitors. In early 1932 Penderel joined an expedition led by Count L√°szl√≥ Alm√°sy to locate the legendary \\"lost oasis\\" of Zerzura in the plateau of Gilf Kebir, which lies in the southwest corner of Egypt, and southeast Libya. Reconnaissance flights over the area located a two large wadis green with vegetation, but before they could find a way to reach them overland the expedition ran out of supplies and had to return to Cairo. In March 1933 Alm√°sy mounted another expedition in which Penderel took part, by which time Patrick Clayton of the Desert Survey had discovered the entrance to Wadi Abd el Malik, and explored the Kufra Oasis. They mapped the southern and eastern sides of the Gilf Kebir and on western side discovered Wadi Talh. They then visited Jebel Uweinat, south of the Gilf Kebir, where Alm√°sy discovered prehistoric rock paintings. On 8 January 1934, Penderel gave a lecture on his expeditions to the Royal Geographical Society, who admitted him as a Fellow. On 1 January 1933 Penderel was promoted to wing commander, and on 5 October was posted to the Headquarters of the Fighting Area at RAF Uxbridge for personnel staff duties. On 30 June 1934, at the Fifteenth Royal Air Force Display at Hendon, Penderel represented the RAF Fighting Area HQ as one of ten competitors in the \\"Headquarters Race\\". He piloted a Hawker Fury, fitted with a Kestrel IIS engine. Flight describes the scene, \\"The scratch man, Wing Commander Penderel, Fighting Area, had already overtaken several others when he came round over the enclosures on the first lap, and from then on he could be seen overhauling other machines steadily.\\" Due to the efficacy of the handicapping, Penderel finished outside the first three places. On 1 December 1937 Penderel was appointed to command the School of Naval Co-operation based at Ford, West Sussex. On 1 January 1938 he was promoted to group captain. World War II service From 26 September 1939 until 11 May 1940 Penderel served as the first commander of No. 201 Group RAF, which was formed from the General Reconnaissance Group, RAF Middle East. On 14 May 1943 Penderel flew Hawker Hurricane Mk IIB HV895 on a test flight from RAF Middle Wallop to RAF Martlesham Heath. He took off again from Martlesham, heading for the nearby bombing range at Orford Ness, but the bomb his aircraft was carrying exploded prematurely and he crashed into Sudbourne Marshes and was killed instantly. He is buried at Llangiwg Churchyard, near Pontardawe, Glamorganshire, Wales.

Mitchum stars along with Julie London. Baseball pitcher Satchel Paige plays a soldier in the film, and Lea has a cameo as a barber. Plot In Mexico, expatriate American pistolero Martin Brady is employed by the Castro brothers, Marcos (V√≠ctor Manuel Mendoza), a general, and Don Cipriano (Pedro Armend√°riz), the new governor. On a business trip to the United States to arrange the purchase of a wagonload of rifles and ammunition, he is delayed when he breaks his leg in an accident in the Texas border town of Puerto. Treated by Dr Stovall (Charles McGraw), he stays with German immigrant Ben Sterner (John Banner), who is the seller of the rifles, and Ben's nephew Ludwig (Chico) (Max Slaten). Brady's help is sought by the local U.S. Army commander, Major Colton (Gary Merrill), to persuade Cipriano Castro to cooperate with Colton's Buffalo Soldiers in an expedition against hostile Apaches in Mexico. In the meantime the rifles Brady purchased for Castro have been stolen. Captain Rucker of the Texas Rangers knows Brady fled to Mexico as an adolescent after avenging the murder of his father, not knowing the man he killed was an outlaw. Rucker tries to enlist Brady as a Ranger. Brady is attracted to Colton's unhappy wife Ellen (Julie London). Brady shoots a man (Chuck Roberson) who murdered Ludwig and drew on him. He then returns to Mexico to inform Cipriano Castro of the missing rifles. Major Colton and Ellen arrive to meet with Cipriano, arranged by Travis Hight (Jack Oakie), the representative of a railroad threatened by the Apaches. Ellen and Brady have a brief affair. Cipriano tells Brady that, by law, he must pay a debt for the rifles and orders him to assassinate his brother Marcos, who seeks to make himself governor. Brady refuses and finds himself an outlaw in Mexico as well. Weeks later on the run, he finds cavalry sergeant Tobe Sutton (Satchel Paige) and returns with him to Major Colton's camp. Colton has been seriously wounded in a skirmish with the Apaches but is determined to rendezvous with Captain Rucker and General Castro's troops. En route they recover the stolen rifles from a small band of Apaches, but Colton dies. The rifles are returned to General Marcos, who reveals that Cipriano is also dead and he is now governor. Calling Brady an assassin, he demands the Americans surrender him and leave Mexico immediately. Rucker offers to help Brady prove that the shooting in Puerto was a case of self-defense, if he will return to Texas. Brady decides to risk it and heads towards the Rio Grande to be with Ellen. Near the river he is ambushed by a gunfighter frequently seen with Marcos. Brady kills him but his Andalusian stallion, a constant companion throughout the story, is killed.

The only money that Lea received from the picture was for his role as the barber. The motion picture was filmed in the state of Durango. Parrish and Lea first asked Henry Fonda, then Gregory Peck to take the starring role. But, Mitchum really wanted to do the film, and after Fonda and Peck said no, Mitchum took over production. During filming in Durango, Mitchum and his stunt double Chuck Roberson decided to have a few drinks at a local cantina. They witnessed two Mexicans get into a violent confrontation in which one drew a pistol and fired a shot into the other's face. After running outside momentarily, the wounded man came back into the bar and dropped dead. The incident shook up Mitchum so badly it convinced him to keep his drinking to the hotel and its vicinity. Reception The film was not well received at the box office and by some critics, but other critics considered it beautifully filmed, by cinematographers Floyd Crosby and Alex Phillips. A rave review in the New York Times appeared on Nov. 5, 1959, critic Howard Thompson referring to Mitchum as \\"ideally cast\\" and writing: \\"This is a superior, intelligent film on nearly every count ... beautifully paced by Robert Parrish's direction and magnificently evocative of the locale where it was made, this Chester Erskine production is consistently rewarding.\\" Upon its release, TIME said about it: \\"But the result is just a crying Shane. All that is truly dramatic is the wonderful country itself\\" and about Mitchum's performance: \\"...he sounds like an Aztec exchange student after six terms at C.C.N.Y.\\". \\"The rest of the plot is as snarled as a ball of tumbleweed.\\" and; \\"...a western that is more woolly than wild\\". Subscription required. Upon its 1961 release in Cuba, it set off an ideological fury due to \\"two Mexican bandits who were named the Castro brothers\\". As Roger Fristoe notes, recent critics regard the film more highly than critics writing more than fifty years ago. Dennis Schwartz wrote in 2009 that the film is \\"A wonderfully rich western that ambitiously covers many familiar themes and does a good job in developing the main character and his knotty personality.\\" A relatively recent review by a critic who awarded the film an \\"A-\\" rating.

He is the same person as the trouv√®re Jehan de Trie, to whom two surviving chansons courtoises have been attributed. One of these, Bone dame me prie de chanter, is also sometimes attributed to Theobald I of Navarre or Gace Brul√©. The other, Li lons consirs et la grans volent√©s, is undisputed.

According to the Chronique Tournaisienne, John died fighting for the king of France at the Battle of the Golden Spurs on 11 July 1302. John had married first Ermengarde, then Yolande, daughter of John I of Dreux. The latter bore him two children: Renaud, who succeeded him prior to May 1304, and Mahaut, who in 1298 married Henry de Vergy (died 1333).

It is located about Latitude 09¬∞ 44\\"N, Longitude 118¬∞ 43\\"E, on the western side of Puerto Princesa, westward of Princesa Strait, and the western side of Palawan Island. The Port lies 558 meters from a coral reef on the southern portion of Bancao-Bancao Point. Its sea distance from Manila is . The Port of Puerto Princesa is a major port of entry at the island-province of Palawan. Puerto Princesa City is located at the middle of the big stretch of island, and as such, serves as the hub of transport (of goods and passengers) activities for both the northern and southern municipalities of the Province. History A 1904 nautical chart of Puerto Princesa's harbor After Spanish colonizers founded the settlement of Puerto Princesa on 4 March 1872 and in May 1872, its port became the center of Spanish Naval Operations in the area because the Bay met all the Navy‚Äôs requirements, as it was deep enough for all types of vessels, well-sheltered from any adverse weather condition and out of the typhoon belt. Royal Decrees later provided incentives to settlers, and by 1883 the settlement had flourished into a town with many infrastructures, among them its well-built port. PMO Puerto Princesa was organized on June 1, 1977 by the Systems Implementation Group (SIG) of the Philippine Ports Authority. This group laid the groundwork for the PMO and held office at a rented structure standing on submerged stilts. It coordinated the smooth turnover of properties and port responsibilities from the then Department of Public Works and Highways and the Bureau of Customs, respectively. The SIG recruited 15 personnel to form the organizational backbone of operations, security, finance, administration and engineering. From the original 15 personnel, the PMO has now 50 regular employees, 9 casuals, 20 outsourced personnel and 38 agency security guards. The PMO embarked on expanding operations to Coron, El Nido, Culion, Cuyo, Brooke's Point and the cluster ports of Liminangcong, Taytay (poblacion), Roxas, Narra, San Vicente and Araceli. It is located in a cove in Southeastern Palawan, and the port is open to cargoes (foreign/domestic; general/containerized) and passengers. Bottled cargoes, construction materials, general consumer goods to other finished products are just some of the various cargoes coming in the port. Outgoing cargoes include marine and agricultural products, live animals, furniture, coconut products and other raw materials. Location and facility alt=The port is located in the southeastern part of the island province, providing entrance to the province's north and south locations. The Port is connected to the City Proper with two-lane concreted road from Rizal Avenue and another two-lane concreted road from Malvar Street. Slight traffic is experienced during the arrival and departure of vessels. Yet both approaches have steep slopes giving difficult accessibility to people. The port is notably out of the prevailing typhoon belt, and is sheltered enough from any such conditions. Seabed is muddy and free from rocks. Tidal currents are not strong and the range is 1.30 meters between MHHW and MLLW. The bay area is aided by two rotating lighthouses ‚Äì one in the northern tip of the bay entrance and the other is in the middle of the northern shore of the bay. The port is also undergoing security, navigational, equipment improvements and various repairs.

From January 1, 2009, I Wear Your Shirt allowed a company to buy a day in which Jason Sadler, the founder, wore a shirt adorned with the company's logo. Sadler wore different shirts for every day of the year. He advertised for the companies by taking pictures and by uploading videos about the companies to Ustream and YouTube. The company closed in 2013. History Founder Jason Sadler (in the back), AJ Leon (bottom row left), and Evan White (bottom row right) I Wear Your Shirt was founded by Jason Sadler of Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida in 2008. He began wearing shirts for companies on January 1, 2009. Sadler decided to start I Wear Your Shirt after trying to come up with \\"a way to make some extra money without actually 'working'\\". In 2005, Sadler was inspired by The Million Dollar Homepage to create \\"something ... that would hopefully be as successful and, maybe down the road, just as profitable\\". He noticed that for promotional purposes, many companies gave away T-shirts for free. Knowing that T-shirts caught people's attention, he decided to become a \\"human billboard\\" and \\"create an advertising medium through free social media tools\\". After coming up with this idea, Sadler spread I Wear Your Shirt's services through his group of family and friends and through Facebook. Marketing and profits For every day of the year, Sadler donned the shirt of a different company for a set price. On January 1, the price was $1. In 2009, the price was increased by $1 for every day after January 1, and by December 31, I Wear Your Shirt's last customer for the year would have to pay $365. At the end of 365 days, Sadler's income would be $66,795. He received an additional $18,000 in 2009 from the sale of monthly $1,500 sponsorships. After factoring in the money gained from contests and other enterprises, Sadler's total income in 2009 was $83,000. Sadler also advertised the company owning the rights to his shirt by posting videos of himself wearing the company's shirt on Ustream, YouTube, Facebook and Twitter, in which he discussed the companies he was promoting. In 2009, he had over 1,300 friends on Facebook and about 21,000 followers on Twitter. For 2010, Sadler increased by twofold the cost of the shirts. He employed Evan White from Los Angeles, California, to wear the same shirts on the West Coast of the United States. By January 1, 2011, there were five people across the country wearing the same shirt: Jason in Jacksonville, DeAndre Upshaw in Dallas, Texas, Angela Seales in New York City, Neal Brooks in Springfield, Missouri, and Amber Plaster in Las Vegas. According to Sadler, the company had some 1,500 clients, including Nissan and Starbucks, and increased the daily price, so that it no longer matched the day of the year.

Some occur outside their native ranges as introduced species.Bassia. Flora of North America. Description The species of genus Bassia are annuals or perennial subshrubs. Their leaves are variable. The flowers are normally inconspicuous, in spike-like inflorescences without bracteoles. The fruits are achenes. The seed contains an annular, horseshoe-shaped or folded embryo that surrounds the perisperm. The fruiting perianth remains either unappendaged or develops 5 wings. The wings are spiny in Bassia hyssopifolia. According to its most recent description, the genus is defined by its three types of C4 \\"kochioid\\" leaf anatomy. Many other characters cannot be used to differentiate species from one another, because they are variable among individuals within the species.Kadereit, G. and H. Freitag. (2011). Molecular phylogeny of Camphorosmeae (Camphorosmoideae, Chenopodiaceae): Implications for biogeography, evolution of C4-photosynthesis and taxonomy. Taxon 60(1), 51-78. Habitat The genus mainly occurs in steppe and desert ecosystems. Some species can be found in ruderal sites and salt marshes up to subalpine altitudes. Phylogenetical research suggests that the genus evolved in the Miocene. Uses Some palatable species of Bassia with high protein content are valuable components of rangelands, sometimes seeded for the melioration of overgrazed rangelands. Systematics The genus name Bassia was first published in 1766 by Carlo Allioni, with the type species Bassia muricata L. (under the name B. aegyptiaca). The genus belongs to the subfamily Camphorosmoideae of the Amaranthaceae. As of 2011, after its most recent reorganization, it contains about 20 species.

In simpler terms, splay is the concentration difference between a substance's maximum renal reabsorption vs. appearance in the urine. Splay is usually used in reference to glucose; other substances, such as phosphate, have virtually no splay at all. Splay appears to occur because kidney nephrons do not have the same tubular maximum for glucose (TmG) therefore some nephrons may excrete before others and also because \\"the maximum reabsorption rate (or Tm) cannot be achieved until the amount/min of glucose being presented to the renal tubules is great enough to fully saturate the receptor sites\\". John Field of the American Physiological Society said \\"Since the splay may occur when the residual nephrons are said to be free of anatomic abnormalities, the possibility exists that changes in the kinetics of glucose reabsorption may have been induced\\".Field, John, Handbook of Physiology: Renal physiology, page 598, American Physiological Society One study found that glucose reabsorption exhibited low splay and another also found that the titration curves for glycine showed a large amount of splay whereas those for lysine showed none and the kinetics of carrier-mediated glucose transport possibly explains the level of splay in renal titration curves. As splay can be clinically important, patients with proximal tubule disease, mainly caused by hereditary nature and often in children, have a lower threshold but a normal Tm. Therefore, splay is suggested, probably because \\"some individual cotransporters have a low glucose affinity but maximal transport rate (renal glycosuria). Studies also show that if sulfate is reabsorbed by a Tm-limited process, it will have low splay and, in animals, the limits of citrate concentration normal in the body, citrate titration curves show a large amount of splay therefore a Tm for citrate reabsorption may actually happen. Also, tubular transport is Tm-limited and the reabsorption mechanism being saturated at a plasma concentration more than 20 times than usual shows a low level of splay. Renal abnormalities of glucose excretion, causing glycosuria, may happen as either a result of reduced Tm for glucose or because of an abnormally wide range of nephron heterogeneity so splay of the glucose excretion curve is increased. Two causes are also listed for splay: \\"heteroginicity in glomerular size, proximal tubular length and number of carrier proteins for glucose reabsorption\\" and variability of TmG nephrons. Splay also occurs between 180 and 350 mg/dL %.

He told only his godson, who was at Rodel as page to Rory MacLeod. As Rory MacLeod looked out at the storm, he exclaimed to his page that \\"on such a night he would not refuse shelter even to his greatest enemy, even Donald MacIain 'ic Sheumais\\". The page immediately took Rory at his word and informed him that Donald was indeed requesting shelter. Donald and his men were given hospitality by the MacLeods. The tension at dinner was severe and violence was only avoided by Rory's firmness. Early in the night the page told the Macdonalds that the wind was fair for Skye and they wisely departed; before dawn, MacLeod clansmen set fire to their quarters without the knowledge of their chief. As the Macdonalds sailed away, their piper played the tune \\"The MacLeods are disgraced\\". After another MacLeod defeat at the Battle of Coire Na Creiche, the Privy Council of Scotland intervened to end the feud. The peace was celebrated with three weeks of feasting and festivities at Dunvegan Castle. Apart from a brief flare-up in 1603, that was the end of violence between the two clans.

She was most notable within linguistics and SLA for developing the Minimal Trees Hypothesis with Martha Young-Scholten,Vainikka & Young-Scholten (1994; 1996; 1998). an \\"important theory,\\" where 'tree' is a metaphor of syntax for the branching structure showing how words of a phrase or sentence co-relate.Vainikka & Young-Scholten (2003). The hypothesis concerns what aspects of a language learner's first language (L1) is carried over into the grammar of their second language (L2), in addition to mechanisms of universal grammar that allow new acquisition to take place. Whereas many researchers lean towards a 'Full Transfer' view in which all the L1 grammar transfersUnsworth, Parodi, Sorace & Young-Scholten (2005). \\\\- i.e. the initial state of the L2 is the final state of the first - Young-Scholten and Vainikka argued that only lexical categories (e.g. the noun phrase) are drawn from the L1, and that functional categories (e.g. the inflectional phrase that represents tense) do not; rather, the learner 'grows' new ones because they start their L2 acquisition with only a 'minimal' syntactic tree. Several competing accounts for the role of transfer and universal grammar persist in SLA; the Minimal Trees Hypothesis remains particularly controversial, and has been strongly critiqued in syntactic research on both empirical and conceptual grounds: some researchers argue that linguistic behaviour does not follow the model,e.g. White (1991), for French. and others claim that it is theoretically misconceived.White (2003: 68-78), for review; Schwartz & Sprouse (1994); Schwartz (1998). For example, the idea that a component of language could be absent from the initial stage, so that the system selectively extracts only one part of the L1, is unacceptable to those who favour 'Full Transfer' rather than 'Partial Transfer'.Schwartz & Sprouse (1996).

After Emperor Ming passed the throne to his eldest son, emperor li(Èáê) to be king of the North, Loc Tuc was appointed to be king of the South in the name of Kinh Duong Vuong (Ê∂áÈôΩ Áéã). According to Dai Viet Su Ky Toan Thu , Kinh Duong Vuong was king and ruled from about 2879 BC onwards. K·ª∑ H·ªìng B√†ng th·ªã. informatik leipzig.de. B·∫£n sao l∆∞u. nguoikesu, 2017.

The territory of the country under King Kinh Duong Vuong was large, north to Yangtze river (including Dong Dinh lake area ), south to Ho Ton country ( Chiem Thanh ), east to Dong Hai (part of the Pacific Ocean ) and to the west is Ba Thuc ( Sichuan ,China today). Lƒ©nh Nam ch√≠ch qu√°i recorded the legend that the king expelled the god of Xuong Cuong vigorously, killing the people. He married the daughter of the King of Dong Dinh Lake, named Than Long, gave birth to a son named Sung Lam, and succeeded the throne as King Lac Long Quan . Comments In the book Kh√¢m ƒê·ªãnh Vi·ªát, it writes: While collecting historical records by early historians, King Tu Duc of the nguyen dynasty identified these stories as \\"stories about ghost buffalo, snake god, myth without standard\\" and determined to exclude Kinh Duong and Lac Long from their own history as this did not correspond with the confucian ideals of the country. Associate professor Liam christopher kelley of south east asian studies commented, Worship Worshiping Kinh Duong Vuong in Vietnam is not as popular as worshiping Shen nong , the god who is Hung Vuong 's ancestor and a very worshiped god in Vietnam's agricultural beliefs ; It was established annually by feudal dynasties to worship Dan Xa Tac . Thuong Lang communal house in Minh Hoa commune, Hung Ha district, Thai Binh province is the oldest relic worshiping Kinh Duong Vuong; Legend has it since the Dinh dynasty . The Kinh Duong Vuong Mausoleum and Temple(locally called LƒÉng v√† ƒê·ªÅn th·ªù) in Bac Ninh have long been classified by the Vietnamese feudal dynasties as shrines to worship the emperors, each time the National Ceremony will bring to the army to worship and worship people solemnly. In 2013 , Bac Ninh province announced a plan to preserve, embellish and promote the population of national historical and cultural relics of Lang and Kinh Duong Vuong Temple with a total investment of more than 491 billion VND.

Explanations for a related vietnamese traditional children's song According to Professor Le Quang Chau, nicknamed Hong Nguyen Tu, while sitting on the bank of Duong River, at the foot of Kinh Duong Vuong's ancestor's grave, he said: \\"Children in our country have a game, starting from the song \\" Chi Chi , fire blows, horses die, three kings, five emperors, can search, catch the heart, (Chi chi ch√†nh ch√†nh, c√°i ƒëanh th·ªïi l·ª≠a, con ng·ª±a ch·∫øt tr∆∞∆°ng, ba v∆∞∆°ng ng≈© ƒë·∫ø, ch·∫•p ch·∫ø ƒëi t√¨m, √∫ tim b·∫Øt ƒë∆∞·ª£c, √π √† √π ·∫≠p) \\".

The three kings are three brothers and sisters of the De Thuc lineage: King Minh, King Lai and King Long Canh. The eldest king named Minh named our country at that time as Xich Dem, the color of the chain was red, the color of fire to indicate that this is the lineage of the Emperor, the devil is one of 28 stars, symbolizing the south (not the devil is the devil fuck). \\"Acceptance to find\\" since the Three Kings have accepted to find an institution to be able to build sustainable assets. \\"I can catch it\\", captured the union of hundreds of families, creating the Van Lang state. \\"√ô √† √π ·∫≠p\\" is an exclamation of a sign of joy.B√≠ ·∫©n ng√¥i m·ªô th·ªßy t·ªï n∆∞·ªõc Vi·ªát b√™n s√¥ng ƒêu·ªëng Zing.vn 20:43 22/10/2013 - Theo Lao ƒê·ªông This is a game played by children for thousands of years, it is how Vietnamese people remember ancient stories.

In Ho Chi Minh City Kinh Duong Vuong Street starts from Phu Lam roundabout in District 6, passes through the main gate of the Western Bus Station and ends at An Lac roundabout in Binh Tan district. In Bac Ninh, Kinh Duong Vuong street connecting Ngo Gia Tu street runs through Kinh Bac Cultural Center and ends at Du Ma Street.

In Da Nang, Kinh Duong Vuong road is about 2.1km long in Hoa Minh ward, Lien Chieu district . Other theories Many Han Nom and historical researchers recently suspected Kinh Duong Vuong being a legendary figure originating in the novel of Lieu Nghi . Tran Trong Duong, a historical researcher in an article in 2013 pointed out that:Tr·∫ßn Tr·ªçng D∆∞∆°ng, Kinh D∆∞∆°ng V∆∞∆°ng - √îng l√† ai?. Tia s√°ng, 06/09/2013, http://tiasang.com.vn/-van-hoa/kinh-duong-vuong-ong-la-ai-6723 This view is said to be consistent with many historians of the Nguyen dynasty (for example, Ngo Thi Si in Dai Viet's history of Tien Bien, Ngo Thi Si in Dai Viet's history of Tien Bien wrote: \\"Now considering the Extraordinary Chronology, which year is the year when Giap Tu started? What year is the name of the warlord? In the period of the Five Kings and before, it was never called King. In the story, the daughter of King Dong Dinh married to Kinh Xuyen Vuong's second child, thinking Kinh Xuyen is Kinh Duong. There are many generations of kings and historians who chose to use them, and consider that to be the truth. The stories are taken from Lingnan, Viet Dien and Linh, as well as Northern history taken in Kinh Nam Hoa and Hong Liet . \\" or in Kh√¢m ƒê·ªãnh Vi·ªát's history of epilogue The book of Kh√¢m ƒê·ªãnh Vi·ªát, from the ancient time of the ancient period, was written: ‚ÄúYes, I look up the old history, the titles Kinh D∆∞∆°ng V∆∞∆°ng, L·∫°c Long Qu√¢n in 'The period of the Hong Bang family, which dates from the ancient times of ancient times, belongs to the childhood of pretending based on nothing and making yes, afraid that it is not reliable enough, to accompany the Tang Dynasty novelist Lieu Nghi, taking it as evidence ‚Äù16. Appropriately speaking the words of the historians, King Tu Duc identified these as \\"stories about ghost buffalo, snake god, myths without standards\\" and resolutely excluded Kinh Duong and Lac Long from their own history. how to bring down the annotation under the reign of Hung Vuong, in order to \\"fit with the sense of traditional suspicion\\" ).

But according to Ngo Si Lien written in the Lac Long Quan section on page 2, The descendants of Than Nong Thi Emperor Minh took lady vu and gave birth to Kinh Duong Vuong , that is the ancestor of Bach Viet. Vuong married a daughter Than Long born Lac Long Quan , meaning that Dong Dinh Quan named Than Long, not his daughter's name Than Long.

Biography Franz Heinrich (Haim) Ollendorf was born in Berlin. In 1924, he joined the Siemens research department in Berlin, working under Reinhold R√ºdenberg. From 1928 he taught in the engineering faculty of the Berlin Technische Hochschule. Despite protest from his supervisor and university rector Ernst Orlich, the Nazis forced Ollendorff to resign in 1933. Soon after the dismissal, Ollendorff joined the teaching staff of the Jewish public school in Berlin, moving to Jerusalem when the school and staff transferred there in 1934. Ollendorff returned to Germany in the following year to organize the transfer of Jewish children to Mandatory Palestine within the framework of the newly established Youth Aliyah. In 1937 he was finally expelled by the Gestapo. In 1939, he joined the staff of the Haifa Technion and became a professor in the faculty of electrical engineering. He specialized in biomedical electronics and physics. He was a member of the Israel Academy of Sciences and was awarded the Israel Prize for his research in magnetic fields (1954). He was elected a fellow of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers in 1963 and served as the Institute's vice president. His interest in the education of teenagers made him a keen supporter of the Technion's vocational high school. Ollendorff wrote books and papers on electronics, physics, mathematics, acoustics, medical electronics, technical education, and other specialized fields. His publications include Die Grundlagen der Hochfrequenztechnik (1926); Erdstroeme (1928); Die Welt der Vektoren (1950); and Innere Elektronik (1955).

The 6210 could have bluetooth functionality added to it, with the use of the Nokia Connectivity Pack, which included a replacement battery which incorporated a Bluetooth adaptor and antenna (interfacing with the phone via normally unused electrical contacts in the battery compartment), and a connectivity card with a PCMCIA adaptor to bring bluetooth to a portable computer (at the time, December 2000, bluetooth was not widespread). The connectivity batteries were available separately. A software upgrade was needed for existing 6210 owners. For this reason, an upgraded 6210 was the earliest cellular phone with bluetooth connectivity.

Construction required the structure to span a river delta, a notable engineering feat in Russia's Far East. The first bridge crossing the Loren was constructed in the 1990s, but the difficult Arctic conditions quickly led to the bridge falling into disrepair. The old bridge was deemed unfit for use and is in the process of dismantlement in favor of the new Loren Bridge. Building of the new bridge started in 2007 in Vladivostok, where the structure was designed and materials were assembled in order to ship them to the bridge site. In 2008, the FESCO shipping company delivered construction materials and cement for building of the new crossing by boat from the port of Vladivostok to Lorino. The Steam-ship \\"Amur\\" was dispatched for the task on June 12th, 2008. Initial estimates had the bridge being open to the public on October 30th, 2009. The bridge opened on November 2nd, 2009, when the commission led by the Chief of the Department of Building, Reconstruction and Repair of Highways and Management of Highways, Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, Evgeny Bessonov officially approved the structure for use by the public. The Loren Bridge is the first of a series of projects being undertaken under the guidance of Mikhail Zelensky in order to improve Chukotka's infrastructure.

He was initially elected in a special election on January 30, 2001. He was unopposed in the 2006 election. Representative McLaughlin grew up and lives in Guntersville. He graduated from Guntersville High School as a Valedictorian in 1978. He then graduated with a B.A. from Birmingham‚ÄìSouthern College in 1982 and then taught high school history, government and biology for four years in Birmingham before going to law school at Harvard in 1990. Representative McLaughlin served as a law clerk for U.S. District Judge Seybourn Lynne and also at the law firm of Maynard Cooper and Gale. Some of his most notable achievements as a legislator were the Landlord Tenant Act, several bills protecting the Tennessee River and recapturing TVA in lieu of tax dollars for the Tennessee Valley Region. He later returned home to open up his own law office of McLaughlin, Edmondson & Hicks, LLC in 1995. His first term as a member of the Alabama House of Representatives began from a special election in 2001. He continued to hold office until the 2010 General Election. During the 2010 General Election of Alabama, despite running unopposed by Democrats, he lost to his Republican opponent, Wes Long. In 2011, then-Governor Robert Bentley appointed McLaughlin to serve as an Alabama delegate to the Uniform Law Commission. In that same year, he was elected to serve as a member of the Alabama Law Institute. In 2012, he was selected to be an editor of the 'Alabama Lawyer' magazine. During this time, he served as counsel for the City of Arab, AL and was appointed as Municipal Judge of the town of Grant, AL. Dubbed as \\"the last honest politician in Alabama\\" by many, others attempted to proposition him repeatedly prior to and during his time in office. On one occasion, he was given an explicit \\"quid pro quo\\" minutes before the votes were cast.^ He has maintained his practice for 14 years serving as a trial counsel, advisor to small businesses, and preparing wills and probating estates. He and his wife Stacy have three children; Frank, William and Mary Crawford. They are involved with St. Williams Church, Lake City Civitans and the Lake Guntersville Chamber of Commerce. He most recently gave a public interview posted on YouTube telling his story of political corruption throughout the Alabama Legislature. It sums up, in 10 minutes, how horrible the Alabama system of government is currently and how it can improve.

Rudimentary botanical science began with empirically-based plant lore passed from generation to generation in the oral traditions of paleolithic hunter-gatherers. The first written records of plants were made in the Neolithic Revolution about 10,000 years ago as writing was developed in the settled agricultural communities where plants and animals were first domesticated. The first writings that show human curiosity about plants themselves, rather than the uses that could be made of them, appears in the teachings of Aristotle's student Theophrastus at the Lyceum in ancient Athens in about 350 BC; this is considered the starting point for modern botany. In Europe, this early botanical science was soon overshadowed by a medieval preoccupation with the medicinal properties of plants that lasted more than 1000 years. During this time, the medicinal works of classical antiquity were reproduced in manuscripts and books called herbals. In China and the Arab world, the Greco-Roman work on medicinal plants was preserved and extended. In Europe the Renaissance of the 14th-17th centuries heralded a scientific revival during which botany gradually emerged from natural history as an independent science, distinct from medicine and agriculture. Herbals were replaced by floras: books that described the native plants of local regions. The invention of the microscope stimulated the study of plant anatomy, and the first carefully designed experiments in plant physiology were performed. With the expansion of trade and exploration beyond Europe, the many new plants being discovered were subjected to an increasingly rigorous process of naming, description, and classification. Progressively more sophisticated scientific technology has aided the development of contemporary botanical offshoots in the plant sciences, ranging from the applied fields of economic botany (notably agriculture, horticulture and forestry), to the detailed examination of the structure and function of plants and their interaction with the environment over many scales from the large-scale global significance of vegetation and plant communities (biogeography and ecology) through to the small scale of subjects like cell theory, molecular biology and plant biochemistry. Introduction Botany (Greek - grass, fodder; Medieval Latin ' ‚Äì herb, plant) and zoology are, historically, the core disciplines of biology whose history is closely associated with the natural sciences chemistry, physics and geology. A distinction can be made between botanical science in a pure sense, as the study of plants themselves, and botany as applied science, which studies the human use of plants. Early natural history divided pure botany into three main streams morphology-classification, anatomy and physiology ‚Äì that is, external form, internal structure, and functional operation. The most obvious topics in applied botany are horticulture, forestry and agriculture although there are many others like weed science, plant pathology, floristry, pharmacognosy, economic botany and ethnobotany which lie outside modern courses in botany. Since the origin of botanical science there has been a progressive increase in the scope of the subject as technology has opened up new techniques and areas of study. Modern molecular systematics, for example, entails the principles and techniques of taxonomy, molecular biology, computer science and more. Within botany there are a number of sub-disciplines that focus on particular plant groups, each with their own range of related studies (anatomy, morphology etc.). Included here are: phycology (algae), pteridology (ferns), bryology (mosses and liverworts) and palaeobotany (fossil plants) and their histories are treated elsewhere (see side bar). To this list can be added mycology, the study of fungi, which were once treated as plants, but are now ranked as a unique kingdom. Ancient knowledge Nomadic hunter-gatherer societies passed on, by oral tradition, what they knew (their empirical observations) about the different kinds of plants that they used for food, shelter, poisons, medicines, for ceremonies and rituals etc. The uses of plants by these pre-literate societies influenced the way the plants were named and classified--their uses were embedded in folk-taxonomies, the way they were grouped according to use in everyday communication. The nomadic life-style was drastically changed when settled communities were established in about twelve centres around the world during the Neolithic Revolution which extended from about 10,000 to 2500 years ago depending on the region. With these communities came the development of the technology and skills needed for the domestication of plants and animals and the emergence of the written word provided evidence for the passing of systematic knowledge and culture from one generation to the next. Plant lore and plant selection A Sumerian harvester's sickle dated to 3000 BC During the Neolithic Revolution plant knowledge increased most obviously through the use of plants for food and medicine. All of today's staple foods were domesticated in prehistoric times as a gradual process of selection of higher-yielding varieties took place, possibly unknowingly, over hundreds to thousands of years. Legumes were cultivated on all continents but cereals made up most of the regular diet: rice in East Asia, wheat and barley in the Middle east, and maize in Central and South America. By Greco-Roman times popular food plants of today, including grapes, apples, figs, and olives, were being listed as named varieties in early manuscripts. Botanical authority William Stearn has observed that \\"cultivated plants are mankind's most vital and precious heritage from remote antiquity\\". It is also from the Neolithic, in about 3000 BC, that we glimpse the first known illustrations of plants and read descriptions of impressive gardens in Egypt. However protobotany, the first pre-scientific written record of plants, did not begin with food; it was born out of the medicinal literature of Egypt, China, Mesopotamia and India. Botanical historian Alan Morton notes that agriculture was the occupation of the poor and uneducated, while medicine was the realm of socially influential shamans, priests, apothecaries, magicians and physicians, who were more likely to record their knowledge for posterity. Early botany ;Ancient India An early example of ancient Indian plant classification is found in the Rigveda, a collection of Vedic Sanskrit hymns from about 3700‚Äì3100 BP. Plants are divided into ' (trees), ' (herbs useful to humans) and ' (creepers), with further subdivisions. The sacred Hindu text Atharvaveda divides plants into eight classes: ' (spreading branches), ' (leaves with long clusters), ' (bushy plants), ' (which expands); ' (those with monopodial growth), ' (creeping plants), ' (with many stalks), and ' (plants with knotty joints). The Taittiriya Samhita classifies the plant kingdom into ', ' and ' (trees), ' (shrubs with spreading branches), ' (herbs), ' (spreading plant), ' (climber), ' (bushy plant), ' (creeper), and ' (spreading on the ground). Other examples of early Indian taxonomy include Manusmriti, the Law book of Hindus, which classifies plants into eight major categories. Elaborate taxonomies also occur in the Charaka SamhitƒÅ, Sushruta Samhita and Vaisesika. ;Ancient China In ancient China lists of different plants and herb concoctions for pharmaceutical purposes date back to at least the time of the Warring States (481 BC-221 BC). Many Chinese writers over the centuries contributed to the written knowledge of herbal pharmaceutics. The Han Dynasty (202 BC-220 AD) includes the notable work of the Huangdi Neijing and the famous pharmacologist Zhang Zhongjing. There were also the 11th century scientists and statesmen Su Song and Shen Kuo who compiled learned treatises on natural history, emphasising herbal medicine. Theophrastus and the origin of botanical science \\"School of Athens\\" Fresco in Apostolic Palace, Rome, Vatican City, by Raphael 1509‚Äì1510 Ancient Athens, of the 6th century BC, was the busy trade centre at the confluence of Egyptian, Mesopotamian and Minoan cultures at the height of Greek colonisation of the Mediterranean. The philosophical thought of this period ranged freely through many subjects. Empedocles (490-430 BC) foreshadowed Darwinian evolutionary theory in a crude formulation of the mutability of species and natural selection. The physician Hippocrates (460-370 BC) avoided the prevailing superstition of his day and approached healing by close observation and the test of experience. At this time a genuine non-anthropocentric curiosity about plants emerged. The major works written about plants extended beyond the description of their medicinal uses to the topics of plant geography, morphology, physiology, nutrition, growth and reproduction. Foremost among the scholars studying botany was Theophrastus of Eressus (Greek: ; c. 371-287 BC) who has been frequently referred to as the \\"Father of Botany\\". He was a student and close friend of Aristotle (384-322 BC) and succeeded him as head of the Lyceum (an educational establishment like a modern university) in Athens with its tradition of peripatetic philosophy. Aristotle's special treatise on plants ‚Äî ‚Äî is now lost, although there are many botanical observations scattered throughout his other writings (these have been assembled by Christian Wimmer in ', 1836) but they give little insight into his botanical thinking.Vines in The Lyceum prided itself in a tradition of systematic observation of causal connections, critical experiment and rational theorizing. Theophrastus challenged the superstitious medicine employed by the physicians of his day, called rhizotomi, and also the control over medicine exerted by priestly authority and tradition. Together with Aristotle he had tutored Alexander the Great whose military conquests were carried out with all the scientific resources of the day, the Lyceum garden probably containing many botanical trophies collected during his campaigns as well as other explorations in distant lands. It was in this garden where he gained much of his plant knowledge. Statue of Theophrastus 371‚Äì287 BC \\"Father of Botany\\" Palermo Botanic Gardens Theophrastus's major botanical works were the Enquiry into Plants (Historia Plantarum) and Causes of Plants (Causae Plantarum) which were his lecture notes for the Lyceum. The opening sentence of the Enquiry reads like a botanical manifesto: \\"We must consider the distinctive characters and the general nature of plants from the point of view of their morphology, their behaviour under external conditions, their mode of generation and the whole course of their life\\". The Enquiry is 9 books of \\"applied\\" botany dealing with the forms and classification of plants and economic botany, examining the techniques of agriculture (relationship of crops to soil, climate, water and habitat) and horticulture. He described some 500 plants in detail, often including descriptions of habitat and geographic distribution, and he recognised some plant groups that can be recognised as modern-day plant families. Some names he used, like Crataegus, Daucus and Asparagus have persisted until today. His second book Causes of Plants covers plant growth and reproduction (akin to modern physiology). Like Aristotle he grouped plants into \\"trees\\", \\"undershrubs\\", \\"shrubs\\" and \\"herbs\\" but he also made several other important botanical distinctions and observations. He noted that plants could be annuals, perennials and biennials, they were also either monocotyledons or dicotyledons and he also noticed the difference between determinate and indeterminate growth and details of floral structure including the degree of fusion of the petals, position of the ovary and more. These lecture notes of Theophrastus comprise the first clear exposition of the rudiments of plant anatomy, physiology, morphology and ecology ‚Äî presented in a way that would not be matched for another eighteen centuries. Meanwhile, the study of medicinal plants was not being neglected and a full synthesis of ancient Greek pharmacology was compiled in Materia Medica c. 60 AD by Pedanius Dioscorides (c. 40-90 AD) who was a Greek physician with the Roman army. This work proved to be the definitive text on medicinal herbs, both oriental and occidental, for fifteen hundred years until the dawn of the European Renaissance being slavishly copied again and again throughout this period. Though rich in medicinal information with descriptions of about 600 medicinal herbs, the botanical content of the work was extremely limited. Ancient Rome The Romans contributed little to the foundations of botanical science laid by the ancient Greeks, but made a sound contribution to our knowledge of applied botany as agriculture. In works titled ' four Roman writers contributed to a compendium Scriptores Rei Rusticae, published from the Renaissance on, which set out the principles and practice of agriculture. These authors were Cato (234‚Äì149 BC), Varro (116‚Äì27 BC) and, in particular, Columella (4‚Äì70 AD) and Palladius (4th century AD). Roman encyclopaedist Pliny the Elder (23‚Äì79 AD) deals with plants in Books 12 to 26 of his 37-volume highly influential work ' in which he frequently quotes Theophrastus but with a lack of botanical insight although he does, nevertheless, draw a distinction between true botany on the one hand, and farming and medicine on the other. It is estimated that at the time of the Roman Empire between 1300 and 1400 plants had been recorded in the West.  Medieval knowledge  Medicinal plants of the early Middle Ages Arabic copy of Avicenna's Canon of Medicine dated 1593 In Western Europe, after Theophrastus, botany passed through a bleak period of 1800 years when little progress was made and, indeed, many of the early insights were lost. As Europe entered the Middle Ages (5th to 15th centuries), China, India and the Arab world enjoyed a golden age. Chinese philosophy had followed a similar path to that of the ancient Greeks. The Chinese dictionary-encyclopaedia Erh Ya probably dates from about 300 BC and describes about 334 plants classed as trees or shrubs, each with a common name and illustration. Between 100 and 1700 AD many new works on pharmaceutical botany were produced including encyclopaedic accounts and treatises compiled for the Chinese imperial court. These were free of superstition and myth with carefully researched descriptions and nomenclature; they included cultivation information and notes on economic and medicinal uses ‚Äî and even elaborate monographs on ornamental plants. But there was no experimental method and no analysis of the plant sexual system, nutrition, or anatomy. The 400-year period from the 9th to 13th centuries AD was the Islamic Renaissance, a time when Islamic culture and science thrived. Greco-Roman texts were preserved, copied and extended although new texts always emphasised the medicinal aspects of plants. Kurdish biologist ƒÄbu ·∏§anƒ´fah ƒÄ·∏•mad ibn Daw≈´d Dƒ´nawarƒ´ (828‚Äì896 AD) is known as the founder of Arabic botany; his Kit√¢b al-nab√¢t ('Book of Plants') describes 637 species, discussing plant development from germination to senescence and including details of flowers and fruits. The Mutazilite philosopher and physician Ibn Sina (Avicenna) (c. 980‚Äì1037 AD) was another influential figure, his The Canon of Medicine being a landmark in the history of medicine treasured until the Enlightenment. In India simple artificial plant classification systems of the Rigveda, Atharvaveda and Taittiriya Samhita became more botanical with the work of Parashara (c. 400 ‚Äì c. 500 AD), the author of V·πõksayurveda (the science of life of trees). He made close observations of cells and leaves and divided plants into Dvimatrka (Dicotyledons) and Ekamatrka (Monocotyledons). The dicotyledons were further classified into groupings (ganas) akin to modern floral families: Samiganiya (Fabaceae), Puplikagalniya (Rutaceae), Svastikaganiya (Cruciferae), Tripuspaganiya (Cucurbitaceae), Mallikaganiya (Apocynaceae), and Kurcapuspaganiya (Asteraceae). Important medieval Indian works of plant physiology include the Prthviniraparyam of Udayana, Nyayavindutika of Dharmottara, Saddarsana-samuccaya of Gunaratna, and Upaskara of Sankaramisra.  The Silk Road  Following the fall of Constantinople (1453), the newly expanded Ottoman Empire welcomed European embassies in its capital, which in turn became the sources of plants from those regions to the east which traded with the empire. In the following century twenty times as many plants entered Europe along the Silk Road as had been transported in the previous two thousand years, mainly as bulbs. Others were acquired primarily for their alleged medicinal value. Initially Italy benefited from this new knowledge, especially Venice, which traded extensively with the East. From there these new plants rapidly spread to the rest of Western Europe. By the middle of the sixteenth century there was already a flourishing export trade of various bulbs from Turkey to Europe. The Age of Herbals De Materia Medica, Byzantium, 15th century. In the European Middle Ages of the 15th and 16th centuries the lives of European citizens were based around agriculture but when printing arrived, with movable type and woodcut illustrations, it was not treatises on agriculture that were published, but lists of medicinal plants with descriptions of their properties or \\"virtues\\". These first plant books, known as herbals showed that botany was still a part of medicine, as it had been for most of ancient history. Authors of herbals were often curators of university gardens, and most herbals were derivative compilations of classic texts, especially De Materia Medica. However, the need for accurate and detailed plant descriptions meant that some herbals were more botanical than medicinal. German Otto Brunfels's (1464‚Äì1534) Herbarum Vivae Icones (1530) contained descriptions of about 47 species new to science combined with accurate illustrations. His fellow countryman Hieronymus Bock's (1498‚Äì1554) Kreutterbuch of 1539 described plants he found in nearby woods and fields and these were illustrated in the 1546 edition. However, it was Valerius Cordus (1515‚Äì1544) who pioneered the formal botanical description that detailed both flowers and fruits, some anatomy including the number of chambers in the ovary, and the type of ovule placentation. He also made observations on pollen and distinguished between inflorescence types. His five-volume Historia Plantarum was published about 18 years after his early death aged 29 in 1561‚Äì1563. In Holland Rembert Dodoens (1517‚Äì1585), in Stirpium Historiae (1583), included descriptions of many new species from the Netherlands in a scientific arrangement and in England William Turner (1515‚Äì1568) in his Libellus De Re Herbaria Novus (1538) published names, descriptions and localities of many native British plants. Herbals contributed to botany by setting in train the science of plant description, classification, and botanical illustration. Up to the 17th century botany and medicine were one and the same but those books emphasising medicinal aspects eventually omitted the plant lore to become modern pharmacopoeias; those that omitted the medicine became more botanical and evolved into the modern compilations of plant descriptions we call Floras. These were often backed by specimens deposited in a herbarium which was a collection of dried plants that verified the plant descriptions given in the Floras. The transition from herbal to Flora marked the final separation of botany from medicine.Arber in  The Renaissance and Age of Enlightenment (1550‚Äì1800)  A 1647 portrait of a scholar holding a book of plant diagrams. The revival of learning during the European Renaissance renewed interest in plants. The church, feudal aristocracy and an increasingly influential merchant class that supported science and the arts, now jostled in a world of increasing trade. Sea voyages of exploration returned botanical treasures to the large public, private, and newly established botanic gardens, and introduced an eager population to novel crops, drugs and spices from Asia, the East Indies and the New World. The number of scientific publications increased. In England, for example, scientific communication and causes were facilitated by learned societies like Royal Society (founded in 1660) and the Linnaean Society (founded in 1788): there was also the support and activities of botanical institutions like the Jardin du Roi in Paris, Chelsea Physic Garden, Royal Botanic Gardens Kew, and the Oxford and Cambridge Botanic Gardens, as well as the influence of renowned private gardens and wealthy entrepreneurial nurserymen. By the early 17th century the number of plants described in Europe had risen to about 6000. The 18th century Enlightenment values of reason and science coupled with new voyages to distant lands instigating another phase of encyclopaedic plant identification, nomenclature, description and illustration, \\"flower painting\\" possibly at its best in this period of history. Plant trophies from distant lands decorated the gardens of Europe's powerful and wealthy in a period of enthusiasm for natural history, especially botany (a preoccupation sometimes referred to as \\"botanophilia\\") that is never likely to recur. Often such exotic new plant imports (primarily from Turkey), when they first appeared in print in English, lacked common names in the language. During the 18th century botany was one of the few sciences considered appropriate for genteel educated women. Around 1760, with the popularization of the Linnaean system, botany became much more widespread among educated women who painted plants, attended classes on plant classification, and collected herbarium specimens although emphasis was on the healing properties of plants rather than plant reproduction which had overtones of sexuality. Women began publishing on botanical topics and children's books on botany appeared by authors like Charlotte Turner Smith. Cultural authorities argued that education through botany created culturally and scientifically aware citizens, part of the thrust for 'improvement' that characterised the Enlightenment. However, in the early 19th century with the recognition of botany as an official science, women were again excluded from the discipline. Botanical gardens and herbaria Botanical Garden of Padova (Garden of the Simples) ‚Äî the oldest academic botanic garden that is still in its original location Preparing a herbarium specimen Public and private gardens have always been strongly associated with the historical unfolding of botanical science. Early botanical gardens were physic gardens, repositories for the medicinal plants described in the herbals. As they were generally associated with universities or other academic institutions the plants were also used for study. The directors of these gardens were eminent physicians with an educational role as \\"scientific gardeners\\" and it was staff of these institutions that produced many of the published herbals. The botanical gardens of the modern tradition were established in northern Italy, the first being at Pisa (1544), founded by Luca Ghini (1490‚Äì1556). Although part of a medical faculty, the first chair of ', essentially a chair in botany, was established in Padua in 1533. Then in 1534, Ghini became Reader in ' at Bologna University, where Ulisse Aldrovandi established a similar garden in 1568 (see below). Collections of pressed and dried specimens were called a ' (garden of dry plants) and the first accumulation of plants in this way (including the use of a plant press) is attributed to Ghini. Buildings called herbaria housed these specimens mounted on card with descriptive labels. Stored in cupboards in systematic order they could be preserved in perpetuity and easily transferred or exchanged with other institutions, a taxonomic procedure that is still used today. By the 18th century the physic gardens had been transformed into \\"order beds\\" that demonstrated the classification systems that were being devised by botanists of the day ‚Äî but they also had to accommodate the influx of curious, beautiful and new plants pouring in from voyages of exploration that were associated with European colonial expansion. From Herbal to Flora Plant classification systems of the 17th and 18th centuries now related plants to one another and not to man, marking a return to the non-anthropocentric botanical science promoted by Theophrastus over 1500 years before. In England, various herbals in either Latin or English were mainly compilations and translations of continental European works, of limited relevance to the British Isles. This included the rather unreliable work of Gerard (1597). The first systematic attempt to collect information on British plants was that of Thomas Johnson (1629), who was later to issue his own revision of Gerard's work (1633‚Äì1636). However Johnson was not the first apothecary or physician to organise botanical expeditions to systematise their local flora. In Italy Ulisse Aldrovandi (1522 ‚Äì 1605) organised an expedition to the Sibylline mountains in Umbria in 1557, and compiled a local Flora. He then began to disseminate his findings amongst other European scholars, forming an early network of knowledge sharing \\"molti amici in molti luoghi\\" (many friends in many places), including Charles de l'√âcluse (Clusius) (1526 ‚Äì 1609) at Montpellier and Jean de Brancion at Malines. Between them they started developing Latin names for plants, in addition to their common names. The exchange of information and specimens between scholars was often associated with the founding of botanical gardens (above), and to this end Aldrovandi founded one of the earliest at his university in Bologna, the Orto Botanico di Bologna in 1568. In France, Clusius journeyed throughout most of Western Europe, making discoveries in the vegetable kingdom along the way. He compiled Flora of Spain (1576), and Austria and Hungary (1583). He was the first to propose dividing plants into classes. Meanwhile, in Switzerland, from 1554, Conrad Gessner (1516 ‚Äì 1565) made regular explorations of the Swiss Alps from his native Zurich and discovered many new plants. He proposed that there were groups or genera of plants. He said that each genus was composed of many species and that these were defined by similar flowers and fruits. This principle of organization laid the groundwork for future botanists. He wrote his important Historia Plantarum shortly before his death. At Malines, in Flanders he established and maintained the botanical gardens of Jean de Brancion from 1568 to 1573, and first encountered tulips. This approach coupled with the new Linnaean system of binomial nomenclature resulted in plant encyclopaedias without medicinal information called Floras that meticulously described and illustrated the plants growing in particular regions. The 17th century also marked the beginning of experimental botany and application of a rigorous scientific method, while improvements in the microscope launched the new discipline of plant anatomy whose foundations, laid by the careful observations of Englishman Nehemiah GrewArber in and Italian Marcello Malpighi, would last for 150 years. Botanical exploration More new lands were opening up to European colonial powers, the botanical riches being returned to European botanists for description. This was a romantic era of botanical explorers, intrepid plant hunters and gardener-botanists. Significant botanical collections came from: the West Indies (Hans Sloane (1660‚Äì1753)); China (James Cunningham); the spice islands of the East Indies (Moluccas, George Rumphius (1627‚Äì1702)); China and Mozambique (Jo√£o de Loureiro (1717‚Äì1791)); West Africa (Michel Adanson (1727‚Äì1806)) who devised his own classification scheme and forwarded a crude theory of the mutability of species; Canada, Hebrides, Iceland, New Zealand by Captain James Cook's chief botanist Joseph Banks (1743‚Äì1820). Classification and morphology Portrait of Carl Linnaeus by Alexander Roslin, 1775 By the middle of the 18th century the botanical booty resulting from the era of exploration was accumulating in gardens and herbaria ‚Äì and it needed to be systematically catalogued. This was the task of the taxonomists, the plant classifiers. Plant classifications have changed over time from \\"artificial\\" systems based on general habit and form, to pre-evolutionary \\"natural\\" systems expressing similarity using one to many characters, leading to post-evolutionary \\"natural\\" systems that use characters to infer evolutionary relationships. Italian physician Andrea Caesalpino (1519‚Äì1603) studied medicine and taught botany at the University of Pisa for about 40 years eventually becoming Director of the Botanic Garden of Pisa from 1554 to 1558. His sixteen-volume De Plantis (1583) described 1500 plants and his herbarium of 260 pages and 768 mounted specimens still remains. Caesalpino proposed classes based largely on the detailed structure of the flowers and fruit; he also applied the concept of the genus. He was the first to try and derive principles of natural classification reflecting the overall similarities between plants and he produced a classification scheme well in advance of its day. Gaspard Bauhin (1560‚Äì1624) produced two influential publications ' (1620) and ' (1623). These brought order to the 6000 species now described and in the latter he used binomials and synonyms that may well have influenced Linnaeus's thinking. He also insisted that taxonomy should be based on natural affinities. Cover page of Species Plantarum of Carl Linnaeus published in 1753 To sharpen the precision of description and classification Joachim Jung (1587‚Äì1657) compiled a much-needed botanical terminology which has stood the test of time. English botanist John Ray (1623‚Äì1705) built on Jung's work to establish the most elaborate and insightful classification system of the day. His observations started with the local plants of Cambridge where he lived, with the ' (1860) which later expanded to his ', essentially the first British Flora. Although his ' (1682, 1688, 1704) provided a step towards a world Flora as he included more and more plants from his travels, first on the continent and then beyond. He extended Caesalpino's natural system with a more precise definition of the higher classification levels, deriving many modern families in the process, and asserted that all parts of plants were important in classification. He recognised that variation arises from both internal (genotypic) and external environmental (phenotypic) causes and that only the former was of taxonomic significance. He was also among the first experimental physiologists. The ' can be regarded as the first botanical synthesis and textbook for modern botany. According to botanical historian Alan Morton, Ray \\"influenced both the theory and the practice of botany more decisively than any other single person in the latter half of the seventeenth century\\". Ray's family system was later extended by Pierre Magnol (1638‚Äì1715) and Joseph de Tournefort (1656‚Äì1708), a student of Magnol, achieved notoriety for his botanical expeditions, his emphasis on floral characters in classification, and for reviving the idea of the genus as the basic unit of classification. Above all it was Swedish Carl Linnaeus (1707‚Äì1778) who eased the task of plant cataloguing. He adopted a sexual system of classification using stamens and pistils as important characters. Among his most important publications were Systema Naturae (1735), Genera Plantarum (1737), and Philosophia Botanica (1751) but it was in his Species Plantarum (1753) that he gave every species a binomial thus setting the path for the future accepted method of designating the names of all organisms. Linnaean thought and books dominated the world of taxonomy for nearly a century. His sexual system was later elaborated by Bernard de Jussieu (1699‚Äì1777) whose nephew Antoine- Laurent de Jussieu (1748‚Äì1836) extended it yet again to include about 100 orders (present-day families). Frenchman Michel Adanson (1727‚Äì1806) in his ' (1763, 1764), apart from extending the current system of family names, emphasized that a natural classification must be based on a consideration of all characters, even though these may later be given different emphasis according to their diagnostic value for the particular plant group. Adanson's method has, in essence, been followed to this day. 18th century plant taxonomy bequeathed to the 19th century a precise binomial nomenclature and botanical terminology, a system of classification based on natural affinities, and a clear idea of the ranks of family, genus and species ‚Äî although the taxa to be placed within these ranks remains, as always, the subject of taxonomic research. Anatomy Robert Hooke's microscope which he described in the 1665 ': he coined the biological use of the term cell In the first half of the 18th century botany was beginning to move beyond descriptive science into experimental science. Although the microscope was invented in 1590 it was only in the late 17th century that lens grinding provided the resolution needed to make major discoveries. Antony van Leeuwenhoek is a notable example of an early lens grinder who achieved remarkable resolution with his single-lens microscopes. Important general biological observations were made by Robert Hooke (1635‚Äì1703) but the foundations of plant anatomy were laid by Italian Marcello Malpighi (1628‚Äì1694) of the University of Bologna in his ' (1675) and Royal Society Englishman Nehemiah Grew (1628‚Äì1711) in his The Anatomy of Plants Begun (1671) and Anatomy of Plants (1682). These botanists explored what is now called developmental anatomy and morphology by carefully observing, describing and drawing the developmental transition from seed to mature plant, recording stem and wood formation. This work included the discovery and naming of parenchyma and stomata. Physiology In plant physiology research interest was focused on the movement of sap and the absorption of substances through the roots. Jan Helmont (1577‚Äì1644) by experimental observation and calculation, noted that the increase in weight of a growing plant cannot be derived purely from the soil, and concluded it must relate to water uptake. Englishman Stephen HalesDarwin in (1677‚Äì1761) established by quantitative experiment that there is uptake of water by plants and a loss of water by transpiration and that this is influenced by environmental conditions: he distinguished \\"root pressure\\", \\"leaf suction\\" and \\"imbibition\\" and also noted that the major direction of sap flow in woody tissue is upward. His results were published in Vegetable Staticks (1727) He also noted that \\"air makes a very considerable part of the substance of vegetables\\". English chemist Joseph Priestley (1733‚Äì1804) is noted for his discovery of oxygen (as now called) and its production by plants. Later Jan Ingenhousz (1730‚Äì1799) observed that only in sunlight do the green parts of plants absorb air and release oxygen, this being more rapid in bright sunlight while, at night, the air (CO2) is released from all parts. His results were published in Experiments upon vegetables (1779) and with this the foundations for 20th century studies of carbon fixation were laid. From his observations he sketched the cycle of carbon in nature even though the composition of carbon dioxide was yet to be resolved. Studies in plant nutrition had also progressed. In 1804 Nicolas-Th√©odore de Saussure's (1767‚Äì1845) ' was an exemplary study of scientific exactitude that demonstrated the similarity of respiration in both plants and animals, that the fixation of carbon dioxide includes water, and that just minute amounts of salts and nutrients (which he analyzed in chemical detail from plant ash) have a powerful influence on plant growth. Plant sexuality Diagram showing the sexual parts of a mature flower It was Rudolf Camerarius (1665‚Äì1721) who was the first to establish plant sexuality conclusively by experiment. He declared in a letter to a colleague dated 1694 and titled ' that \\"no ovules of plants could ever develop into seeds from the female style and ovary without first being prepared by the pollen from the stamens, the male sexual organs of the plant\\". Much was learned about plant sexuality by unravelling the reproductive mechanisms of mosses, liverworts and algae. In his ' of 1851 Wilhelm Hofmeister (1824‚Äì1877) starting with the ferns and bryophytes demonstrated that the process of sexual reproduction in plants entails an \\"alternation of generations\\" between sporophytes and gametophytes. This initiated the new field of comparative morphology which, largely through the combined work of William Farlow (1844‚Äì1919), Nathanael Pringsheim (1823‚Äì1894), Frederick Bower, Eduard Strasburger and others, established that an \\"alternation of generations\\" occurs throughout the plant kingdom. Some time later the German academic and natural historian Joseph K√∂lreuter (1733‚Äì1806) extended this work by noting the function of nectar in attracting pollinators and the role of wind and insects in pollination. He also produced deliberate hybrids, observed the microscopic structure of pollen grains and how the transfer of matter from the pollen to the ovary inducing the formation of the embryo. Angiosperm (flowering plant) life cycle showing alternation of generationsOne hundred years after Camerarius, in 1793, Christian Sprengel (1750‚Äì1816) broadened the understanding of flowers by describing the role of nectar guides in pollination, the adaptive floral mechanisms used for pollination, and the prevalence of cross-pollination, even though male and female parts are usually together on the same flower. Nineteenth-century foundations of modern botany In about the mid-19th century scientific communication changed. Until this time ideas were largely exchanged by reading the works of authoritative individuals who dominated in their field: these were often wealthy and influential \\"gentlemen scientists\\". Now research was reported by the publication of \\"papers\\" that emanated from research \\"schools\\" that promoted the questioning of conventional wisdom. This process had started in the late 18th century when specialist journals began to appear. Even so, botany was greatly stimulated by the appearance of the first \\"modern\\" textbook, Matthias Schleiden's (1804‚Äì1881) ', published in English in 1849 as Principles of Scientific Botany. By 1850 an invigorated organic chemistry had revealed the structure of many plant constituents. Although the great era of plant classification had now passed the work of description continued. Augustin de Candolle (1778‚Äì1841) succeeded Antoine-Laurent de Jussieu in managing the botanical project ' (1824‚Äì1841) which involved 35 authors: it contained all the dicotyledons known in his day, some 58000 species in 161 families, and he doubled the number of recognized plant families, the work being completed by his son Alphonse (1806‚Äì1893) in the years from 1841 to 1873. Plant geography and ecology Alexander von Humboldt 1769‚Äì1859 painted by Joseph Stieler in 1843 The opening of the 19th century was marked by an increase in interest in the connection between climate and plant distribution. Carl Willdenow (1765‚Äì1812) examined the connection between seed dispersal and distribution, the nature of plant associations and the impact of geological history. He noticed the similarities between the floras of N America and N Asia, the Cape and Australia, and he explored the ideas of \\"centre of diversity\\" and \\"centre of origin\\". German Alexander von Humboldt (1769‚Äì1859) and Frenchman Aime Bonpland (1773‚Äì1858) published a massive and highly influential 30 volume work on their travels; Robert Brown (1773‚Äì1852) noted the similarities between the floras of S Africa, Australia and India, while Joakim Schouw (1789‚Äì1852) explored more deeply than anyone else the influence on plant distribution of temperature, soil factors, especially soil water, and light, work that was continued by Alphonse de Candolle (1806‚Äì1893). Joseph Hooker (1817‚Äì1911) pushed the boundaries of floristic studies with his work on Antarctica, India and the Middle East with special attention to endemism. August Grisebach (1814‚Äì1879) in ' (1872) examined physiognomy in relation to climate and in America geographic studies were pioneered by Asa Gray (1810‚Äì1888). Physiological plant geography, or ecology, emerged from floristic biogeography in the late 19th century as environmental influences on plants received greater recognition. Early work in this area was synthesised by Danish professor Eugenius Warming (1841‚Äì1924) in his book ' (Ecology of Plants, generally taken to mark the beginning of modern ecology) including new ideas on plant communities, their adaptations and environmental influences. This was followed by another grand synthesis, the ' of Andreas Schimper (1856‚Äì1901) in 1898 (published in English in 1903 as Plant-geography upon a physiological basis translated by W. R. Fischer, Oxford: Clarendon press, 839 pp.) Anatomy Plant cells with visible chloroplasts During the 19th century German scientists led the way towards a unitary theory of the structure and life-cycle of plants. Following improvements in the microscope at the end of the 18th century, Charles Mirbel (1776‚Äì1854) in 1802 published his ' and Johann Moldenhawer (1766‚Äì1827) published ' (1812) in which he describes techniques for separating cells from the middle lamella. He identified vascular and parenchymatous tissues, described vascular bundles, observed the cells in the cambium, and interpreted tree rings. He found that stomata were composed of pairs of cells, rather than a single cell with a hole. Anatomical studies on the stele were consolidated by Carl Sanio (1832‚Äì1891) who described the secondary tissues and meristem including cambium and its action. Hugo von Mohl (1805‚Äì1872) summarized work in anatomy leading up to 1850 in ' (1851) but this work was later eclipsed by the encyclopaedic comparative anatomy of Heinrich Anton de Bary in 1877. An overview of knowledge of the stele in root and stem was completed by Van Tieghem (1839‚Äì1914) and of the meristem by Karl N√§geli (1817‚Äì1891). Studies had also begun on the origins of the carpel and flower that continue to the present day. Water relations The riddle of water and nutrient transport through the plant remained. Physiologist Von Mohl explored solute transport and the theory of water uptake by the roots using the concepts of cohesion, transpirational pull, capillarity and root pressure. German dominance in the field of physiology was underlined by the publication of the definitive textbook on plant physiology synthesising the work of this period, Sach's e of 1882. There were, however, some advances elsewhere such as the early exploration of geotropism (the effect of gravity on growth) by Englishman Thomas Knight, and the discovery and naming of osmosis by Frenchman Henri Dutrochet (1776‚Äì1847). Cytology The cell nucleus was discovered by Robert Brown in 1831. Demonstration of the cellular composition of all organisms, with each cell possessing all the characteristics of life, is attributed to the combined efforts of botanist Matthias Schleiden and zoologist Theodor Schwann (1810‚Äì1882) in the early 19th century although Moldenhawer had already shown that plants were wholly cellular with each cell having its own wall and Julius von Sachs had shown the continuity protoplasm between cell walls. From 1870 to 1880 it became clear that cell nuclei are never formed anew but always derived from the substance of another nucleus. In 1882 Flemming observed the longitudinal splitting of chromosomes in the dividing nucleus and concluded that each daughter nucleus received half of each of the chromosomes of the mother nucleus: then by the early 20th century it was found that the number of chromosomes in a given species is constant. With genetic continuity confirmed and the finding by Eduard Strasburger that the nuclei of reproductive cells (in pollen and embryo) have a reducing division (halving of chromosomes, now known as meiosis) the field of heredity was opened up. By 1926 Thomas Morgan was able to outline a theory of the gene and its structure and function. The form and function of plastids received similar attention, the association with starch being noted at an early date. With observation of the cellular structure of all organisms and the process of cell division and continuity of genetic material, the analysis of the structure of protoplasm and the cell wall as well as that of plastids and vacuoles ‚Äì what is now known as cytology, or cell theory became firmly established. Later, the cytological basis of the gene-chromosome theory of heredity extended from about 1900‚Äì1944 and was initiated by the rediscovery of Gregor Mendel's (1822‚Äì1884) laws of plant heredity first published in 1866 in Experiments on Plant Hybridization and based on cultivated pea, Pisum sativum: this heralded the opening up of plant genetics. The cytological basis for gene-chromosome theory was explored through the role of polyploidy and hybridization in speciation and it was becoming better understood that interbreeding populations were the unit of adaptive change in biology. Developmental morphology and evolution Until the 1860s it was believed that species had remained unchanged through time: each biological form was the result of an independent act of creation and therefore absolutely distinct and immutable. But the hard reality of geological formations and strange fossils needed scientific explanation. Charles Darwin's Origin of Species (1859) replaced the assumption of constancy with the theory of descent with modification. Phylogeny became a new principle as \\"natural\\" classifications became classifications reflecting, not just similarities, but evolutionary relationships. Wilhelm Hofmeister established that there was a similar pattern of organization in all plants expressed through the alternation of generations and extensive homology of structures. Polymath German intellect Johann Goethe (1749‚Äì1832) had interests and influence that extended into botany. In ' (1790) he provided a theory of plant morphology (he coined the word \\"morphology\\") and he included within his concept of \\"metamorphosis\\" modification during evolution, thus linking comparative morphology with phylogeny. Though the botanical basis of his work has been challenged there is no doubt that he prompted discussion and research on the origin and function of floral parts. His theory probably stimulated the opposing views of German botanists Alexander Braun (1805‚Äì1877) and Matthias Schleiden who applied the experimental method to the principles of growth and form that were later extended by Augustin de Candolle (1778‚Äì1841). Carbon fixation (photosynthesis) Photosynthesis splits water to liberate O2 and fixes CO2 into sugar At the start of the 19th century the idea that plants could synthesize almost all their tissues from atmospheric gases had not yet emerged. The energy component of photosynthesis, the capture and storage of the Sun's radiant energy in carbon bonds (a process on which all life depends) was first elucidated in 1847 by Mayer, but the details of how this was done would take many more years. Chlorophyll was named in 1818 and its chemistry gradually determined, to be finally resolved in the early 20th century. The mechanism of photosynthesis remained a mystery until the mid-19th century when Sachs, in 1862, noted that starch was formed in green cells only in the presence of light and in 1882 he confirmed carbohydrates as the starting point for all other organic compounds in plants. The connection between the pigment chlorophyll and starch production was finally made in 1864 but tracing the precise biochemical pathway of starch formation did not begin until about 1915. Nitrogen fixation Significant discoveries relating to nitrogen assimilation and metabolism, including ammonification, nitrification and nitrogen fixation (the uptake of atmospheric nitrogen by symbiotic soil microorganisms) had to wait for advances in chemistry and bacteriology in the late 19th century and this was followed in the early 20th century by the elucidation of protein and amino-acid synthesis and their role in plant metabolism. With this knowledge it was then possible to outline the global nitrogen cycle. Twentieth century Thin layer chromatography is used to separate components of chlorophyll 20th century science grew out of the solid foundations laid by the breadth of vision and detailed experimental observations of the 19th century. A vastly increased research force was now rapidly extending the horizons of botanical knowledge at all levels of plant organization from molecules to global plant ecology. There was now an awareness of the unity of biological structure and function at the cellular and biochemical levels of organisation. Botanical advance was closely associated with advances in physics and chemistry with the greatest advances in the 20th century mainly relating to the penetration of molecular organization. However, at the level of plant communities it would take until mid century to consolidate work on ecology and population genetics. By 1910 experiments using labelled isotopes were being used to elucidate plant biochemical pathways, to open the line of research leading to gene technology. On a more practical level research funding was now becoming available from agriculture and industry. Molecules In 1903 Chlorophylls a and b were separated by thin layer chromatography then, through the 1920s and 1930s, biochemists, notably Hans Krebs (1900‚Äì1981) and Carl (1896‚Äì1984) and Gerty Cori (1896‚Äì1957) began tracing out the central metabolic pathways of life. Between the 1930s and 1950s it was determined that ATP, located in mitochondria, was the source of cellular chemical energy and the constituent reactions of photosynthesis were progressively revealed. Then, in 1944 DNA was extracted for the first time. Along with these revelations there was the discovery of plant hormones or \\"growth substances\\", notably auxins, (1934) gibberellins (1934) and cytokinins (1964) and the effects of photoperiodism, the control of plant processes, especially flowering, by the relative lengths of day and night. Following the establishment of Mendel's laws, the gene- chromosome theory of heredity was confirmed by the work of August Weismann who identified chromosomes as the hereditary material. Also, in observing the halving of the chromosome number in germ cells he anticipated work to follow on the details of meiosis, the complex process of redistribution of hereditary material that occurs in the germ cells. In the 1920s and 1930s population genetics combined the theory of evolution with Mendelian genetics to produce the modern synthesis. By the mid-1960s the molecular basis of metabolism and reproduction was firmly established through the new discipline of molecular biology. Genetic engineering, the insertion of genes into a host cell for cloning, began in the 1970s with the invention of recombinant DNA techniques and its commercial applications applied to agricultural crops followed in the 1990s. There was now the potential to identify organisms by molecular \\"fingerprinting\\" and to estimate the times in the past when critical evolutionary changes had occurred through the use of \\"molecular clocks\\". Computers, electron microscopes and evolution Electron microscope constructed by Ernst Ruska in 1933 Increased experimental precision combined with vastly improved scientific instrumentation was opening up exciting new fields. In 1936 Alexander Oparin (1894‚Äì1980) demonstrated a possible mechanism for the synthesis of organic matter from inorganic molecules. In the 1960s it was determined that the Earth's earliest life-forms treated as plants, the cyanobacteria known as stromatolites, dated back some 3.5 billion years. Mid- century transmission and scanning electron microscopy presented another level of resolution to the structure of matter, taking anatomy into the new world of \\"ultrastructure\\". New and revised \\"phylogenetic\\" classification systems of the plant kingdom were produced by several botanists, including August Eichler. A massive 23 volume ' was published by Adolf Engler & Karl Prantl over the period 1887 to 1915. Taxonomy based on gross morphology was now being supplemented by using characters revealed by pollen morphology, embryology, anatomy, cytology, serology, macromolecules and more. The introduction of computers facilitated the rapid analysis of large data sets used for numerical taxonomy (also called taximetrics or phenetics). The emphasis on truly natural phylogenies spawned the disciplines of cladistics and phylogenetic systematics. The grand taxonomic synthesis An Integrated System of Classification of Flowering Plants (1981) of American Arthur Cronquist (1919‚Äì1992) was superseded when, in 1998, the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group published a phylogeny of flowering plants based on the analysis of DNA sequences using the techniques of the new molecular systematics which was resolving questions concerning the earliest evolutionary branches of the angiosperms (flowering plants). The exact relationship of fungi to plants had for some time been uncertain. Several lines of evidence pointed to fungi being different from plants, animals and bacteria ‚Äì indeed, more closely related to animals than plants. In the 1980s-90s molecular analysis revealed an evolutionary divergence of fungi from other organisms about 1 billion years ago ‚Äì sufficient reason to erect a unique kingdom separate from plants. Biogeography and ecology Map of terrestrial biomes classified by vegetation type The publication of Alfred Wegener's (1880‚Äì1930) theory of continental drift 1912 gave additional impetus to comparative physiology and the study of biogeography while ecology in the 1930s contributed the important ideas of plant community, succession, community change, and energy flows. From 1940 to 1950 ecology matured to become an independent discipline as Eugene Odum (1913‚Äì2002) formulated many of the concepts of ecosystem ecology, emphasising relationships between groups of organisms (especially material and energy relationships) as key factors in the field. Building on the extensive earlier work of Alphonse de Candolle, Nikolai Vavilov (1887‚Äì1943) from 1914 to 1940 produced accounts of the geography, centres of origin, and evolutionary history of economic plants. Twenty-first century In reviewing the sweep of botanical history it is evident that, through the power of the scientific method, most of the basic questions concerning the structure and function of plants have, in principle, been resolved. Now the distinction between pure and applied botany becomes blurred as our historically accumulated botanical wisdom at all levels of plant organisation is needed (but especially at the molecular and global levels) to improve human custodianship of planet earth. The most urgent unanswered botanical questions now relate to the role of plants as primary producers in the global cycling of life's basic ingredients: energy, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, and ways that our plant stewardship can help address the global environmental issues of resource management, conservation, human food security, biologically invasive organisms, carbon sequestration, climate change, and sustainability.

We make sure you are ready to take the next step, not only academically but with great communication skills and resume writing skills to Neil that interview and get the job.  History  NIU College was founded in 1976 by Ted Dalton in Newport Beach, California. In 2002, the school was relocated to Wyoming under new management to operate under a permissive state higher education law, where it operated in accordance with the laws of the state of Wyoming and under the rules and regulations of the Wyoming Department of Education. In April 2009 a meeting of the NIU Board of Governors was held in the NIU Headquarters building in Laramie, Wyoming and decisions were made to move the facilities to Hayward, California. To accomplish this move, it was further decided that Newport International University would end its operations in Wyoming and would voluntarily return its license to the Wyoming Depart of Education. In October 2009, new legislation was passed requiring all private postsecondary schools, new or current, to be properly registered/renewed and approved by the state of California. Under new management in 2011, Newport International University began the process for approval by the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education (BPPE). In 2014, Newport International University received BPPE approval to operate and educate in the state of California in the fields of business and psychology. NIU was incorporated in Wyoming in 2002 and formerly operated there under a permissive state higher education law. After the state enacted a new law in 2006 requiring higher education institutions to be accredited or seek accreditation in order to remain in the state, NIU filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the new state law. The Wyoming Supreme Court upheld the law in a June 2008 ruling, and in April 2009 NIU relinquished its Wyoming registration and announced plans to merge with Newport University in California.Important Information Concerning the Legal Status of Newport International University, Newport International University website, accessed April 22, 2010 Charles Huckabee, Unaccredited Institution to Leave Wyoming, The Chronicle of Higher Education, May 12, 2009Wyoming Supreme Court opinion No. S-07-0234, June 25, 2008  University maturation  In 2003, Dr. Ted Dalton split Newport International University into two sectors. The first would become Newport University, the sector of the university designated for local students. The second would become Newport International University and the international sector of the university. The schools were split up and acquired as separate entities. All Newport International University logos, trademarks, licenses, publications, and website became the sole property of Newport International University.  University campus  The campus is located at 6700 Fallbrook Avenue, West Hills, CA 91307, near one of the busiest intersections in the San Fernando Valley. The facility is close to shops and restaurants, has ample parking available and is located in a traffic-heavy thoroughfare. The campus is a short distance to the main highway (highways 101, 118, and 405) and public transportation is easily accessible. Aside from the U.S. campus, relationships have been created with schools in multiple countries, as facilitators, for Newport International University to use their campuses for students. All school campuses must meet the standards set by Newport International University and keep in line with the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education's necessary requirements.  Student life  While based in Wyoming, NIU operated educational programs in about 14 countries around the world.  Partnerships  Newport International University has also created a partnership with English Language Center (ELC), a center for English as a second language, to help potential students. With this partnership, Newport International University students who wish to come to the U.S. are able to receive their I-20 (F-1 Visa) through ELC and take courses at the university alongside taking their English classes. In addition to ELC, Newport International University has partnered with Net Language, an online center for English as a second language, to help students who wish to learn English online at the comfort of their home. Students can take both English and Spanish courses without ever leaving their neighborhood. Net Language provides these resources to people of all ages and group, including schools, governments, and corporations.

The Seppeltsfield winery is well known for its signature wine, the 100-year-old Para Tawny.Wine Atlas of Australia, books.google.com, accessed 8 November 2009.  History  Joseph Ernest Seppelt, a merchant who sold such commodities as tobacco, snuff and liqueurs, emigrated with his family from Prussia (now Poland) to Australia in 1849 to break free from political and economic unrest.Seppeltsfield: History , seppeltsfield.com.au, accessed 7 November 2009. He was intent on growing and selling tobacco. In 1850, he and his family settled in Klemzig. After discovering that the land was not suited for such purpose, he and his family decided to settle in the Barossa Valley in 1851.Wine Pros: Barossa Valley ‚Äì Origins , winepros.com.au, 18 September 2000, accessed 7 November 2009. In 1851, Seppelt purchased of land for about ¬£1 an acre which he called Seppeltsfield. He soon discovered that, as was the case in Klemzig, the land in the Barossa Valley was not suited for growing economically useful tobacco.Seppeltsfield ‚Äì History and Culture, theage.com.au, accessed 7 November 2009.Seppelts, Chateau Tanunda, chateautanunda.com, accessed 8 November 2009. However, the Seppelts did have success growing wheat on their land and, due to the gold rushes of the 1850s, were able to sell it for high prices due to high demand at the time. With his knowledge of liqueurs gained from his days as a merchant, Seppelt saw there was potential for wine production on his land. Soon thereafter, the Seppelts planted vines that flourished leading to a contribution to the Wines and Spirits category at the Melbourne Intercolonial Exhibition in 1866.Catalogue of Contributions to the Intercolonial Exhibition Melbourne 1866, accessed 1 January 2016. By 1867, Joseph had begun construction of a full-scale winery, and by 1878, the port store cellar was completed. In 2006, the cellar held about 9 million litres of fortified wine. Joseph Seppelt did not live to see the completion of his winery, as he died in early 1868. His eldest son, Oscar Benno Pedro, then 21, inherited a 55% majority of the winery. Benno's younger siblings, Victor and Ottilie, inherited 30% and 15% of the winery respectively. Benno later bought out his younger siblings and gained complete control of the winery. Benno's oversight helped earn the winery a reputation for quality wines. At the turn of the century, the Seppelt Winery was Australia's largest winery, producing 2 million litres annually. The winery's reputation lead to statements like: \\"Seppeltsfield is undoubtedly the iconic winery of the Barossa\\". 100-year-old Para Tawny In 1878, to celebrate the completion of the cellar, Benno selected a puncheon (500 litre barrel) of his finest wine and declared that the barrel would be allowed to mature for 100 years. Thus was the idea of the \\"Seppelt Para 100 year old Tawny Port\\" born. Every year since 1878, the winery has set aside more of its finest wine for 100 years of barrel maturation. In 1978, the first bottles (750ml) of the 100-year-old wine were released. The Seppelt Para 100-year-old Tawny Port, then the Seppelt Para 100-year-old Tawny, and now the Seppeltsfield Para 100-year-old Tawny, has become the signature wine for the Seppelt, and subsequently Seppeltsfield, brand. Seppeltsfield is the only winery to have notable amounts of wine set aside in consecutive vintages for over 100 years,Seppeltsfield: 100 Year Old Para Tawny Port, seppeltsfield.com.au, accessed 7 November 2009. and nowhere else in the world does a winery _annually_ release a commercially available wine a century old. In 2009, the wine was priced at $1,000 per half bottle (375ml). Originally released in 750ml bottles and 375ml half bottles, the wine is now available \\"in 375ml and 100ml formats\\". \\"The 1913 was released in mid February 2013, and is available for purchase in both 100ml and 375ml formats, for $330 and $990 respectively\\". Tonic wines Seppelts produced several wines promoted for their supposed health-giving properties. \\"Invalid port\\" and \\"Hospital brandy\\" were choice quality wines sold in small quantities and frequently prescribed by doctors in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Specialties were \\"Quinine champagne\\" and \\"Sedna\\". The latter was a port wine containing extract of beef, kola nut and coca leaf, produced by Deans, Logan & Co. of Belfast, Ireland, and marketed by Seppelts from around 1908. It may later have been produced under licence by Seppelts. Later formulations had kola nut powder as the only advertised additive, the meat extract and coca having been dropped in 1923. Winery ownership Benno and his wife had a total of 16 children. In 1902, Benno set up \\"B Seppelt & Sons Ltd\\", and on his retirement in 1916, their eldest surviving son, Oscar (Oscar Benno Seppelt,) became Managing Director. After Benno's death in 1931, many of their children took interests in the company.Seppelt family history, www.seppeltsfield.com.au The company (and winery) remained in the Seppelt family until 1984 when it became the subject of a share market struggle for its control, and subsequent takeover by SA Brewing Holdings in 1985. Meanwhile, Tooth & Co., part of the Adelaide Steamship Group, purchased a number of wineries.Summary of Movements in Facility: Adelaide Steamship Company , Chapter 9, Appendix B, State Bank Audit report, SA Govt Auditor General, 1993 AdSteam sold its wineries to SA Brewing Holdings in 1990, who then renamed all of its wine holdings \\"The Penfolds Wines Group\\", and then in 1994, Southcorp Wines. In 2005 ownership changed hands again when the Foster's Group purchased Southcorp Wines.Seppeltsfield: Historical Timeline, seppeltsfield.com.au, accessed 7 November 2009.

At its peak the site was able to attract 2 million users a month. Development SeeSaw used part of the technology that was originally built for Project Kangaroo, the now defunct project owned by BBC Worldwide, Channel 4 and ITV plc. Project Kangaroo was blocked by the Competition Commission in February 2009. In September 2009 Project Kangaroo's technology and assets were bought by Arqiva for approximately ¬£8m. The SeeSaw brand was announced on 3 November 2009. ioko developed the software and the user experience for the site, having already developed the software for Project Kangaroo.

International licensing On 2 August 2010, Pierre-Jean Sebert, said SeeSaw was in late-stage negotiations with media companies in two countries to license its technology. \\"It started as an opportunity, but we have now equipped ourselves in a strategy to deal with international expansion, on a business-to-business basis through partnerships,\\" Mr Sebert said. While Sebert revealed that one of the deals was in Europe and the other was in a country \\"very far away\\", it was understood that one of the deals could have involved taking the SeeSaw brand name as well. Content On 2 December 2009, SeeSaw announced a content deal with BBC Worldwide, so shows such as Cranford, Lark Rise to Candleford, That Mitchell and Webb Look and classic Doctor Who would be available for viewers at launch. On 29 January 2010, SeeSaw announced several deals. SeeSaw would carry programmes from Channel 4, including shows such as Peep Show, The Inbetweeners, Skins and Grand Designs and also from Five, including programmes such as The Gadget Show, Neighbours and Home and Away. SeeSaw reached a separate agreement with UK independent distributor Digital Rights Group, which resulted in ITV dramas, such as Doc Martin and Kingdom being made available. SeeSaw also agreed separate deals with independent production firm Shed Media (through its distribution arm Outright Distribution) and Talkback Thames for a variety of programming including Footballers' Wives, Bad Girls, Waterloo Road and The Apprentice. In addition, the firm agreed the \\"first of many\\" planned US content deals with RHI Entertainment for 50 made-for-TV movies. SeeSaw launched to the public on 17 February 2010 with over 3,000 hours of free content, supported by 60-second pre and mid-roll advertising. June 2010 saw the addition of a pay-per-programme feature, with a 48-hour viewing window. On 20 May 2010, SeeSaw launched its paid-for service offering 1,000 hours of premium content. The platform had already agreed a deal with MTV Networks for Comedy Central shows such as South Park and MTV properties such as The Hills, My Super Sweet 16 and Laguna Beach. A range of BBC Worldwide shows were also available to rent, including The Royle Family, Gavin & Stacey, Spooks and Louis Theroux documentaries. The firm said that \\"several\\" other agreements were in the pipeline with \\"major Hollywood studios\\" to offer around 2,000 hours of premium content in the coming months. On 18 August 2010, SeeSaw agreed a content deal with NBC Universal Television Distribution to make shows such as House, 30 Rock and Law & Order: Special Victims Unit available on its video on-demand website. The multi-year deal enabled SeeSaw users to rent individual episodes or full series of a range of US series, including The Office, Heroes and Battlestar Galactica. As of October 2011, only archive shows from BBC Worldwide remained following SeeSaw's financial trouble. Key appointments Maya Bhose from NBC Universal was appointed as head of brand marketing. Fallon were announced as the creative advertising agency and Vizeum as the media agency, with a ¬£5m budget allocated to promoting the site. On 3 March 2010, SeeSaw hired Neovia Financial to implement and manage a payment system for its premium content service. Nick Thompson, the long-time Managing Director of broadcast & media at Arqiva left in April 2011 as part of a management reorganisation at Arqiva. His successor, Charles Constable, was not made responsible for SeeSaw as Arqiva sought an investment partner. Pierre- Jean Sebert, formerly MD of British Eurosport, was appointed as Managing Director of SeeSaw on 31 July 2009 but left the company in 2011 as part of financial restructuring at Arqiva. As part of the Criterion Media Group's investment in SeeSaw, Michael Jackson became chairman designate on 14 July 2011, however he walked away from the company in September 2011 as Criterion failed to raise funding. On 13 September 2011, platform controller John Keeling, commercial director Matt Rennie and product director Richard Dines resigned from SeeSaw. Takeover On 19 January 2011, Arqiva announced plans to find an investment partner for SeeSaw, with options for a sale of the online TV service believed to be under consideration. Arqiva completed a strategic review of SeeSaw in October 2010 and was seeking an investment partner to help with the \\"aim of accelerating the development of the service\\". However, on 27 May 2011, an announcement on the SeeSaw blog confirmed that \\"next month will be the end of the road for SeeSaw\\", with Arqiva directly announcing that SeeSaw would close on 20 June 2011, after failing to find an investment partner or buyer. However the site remained open, with Arqiva in talks to sell SeeSaw to US investment firm Criterion Capital Partners, although only a limited selection of free content from BBC Worldwide, Channel 4 and Channel 5 remained available. On 14 July 2011, it was announced that a consortium of investors, including Criterion Capital Partners, had purchased a 75% stake in SeeSaw for more than ¬£10m. Arqiva retained a 25% stake, while Criterion Media Group, a division of Criterion Capital Partners, took majority ownership of SeeSaw. Criterion Capital Partners said the deal pulled together a number of investors: entertainment executives, new media entrepreneurs, institutional funds, and private equity partners. As part of the deal, Criterion was required to raise a multimillion-pound round of funding to drive the rejuvenation of SeeSaw and set up its 28 staff in new headquarters by 31 August. Part of Criterion's plan to bring profitability was to renegotiate nearly 20 programme content deals. However SeeSaw failed to renegotiate its content deals with Channel 4 and Channel 5, losing two of its key partners. In September 2011 Criterion was understood to have run into problems with the lead backer in the investment consortium, Weston Capital. The delay meant that Arqiva was no longer contractually bound to run the venture, including providing ongoing funding. However the company and its remaining 15 members of staff were able to move out of Arqiva into a new office. On 28 October 2011 SeeSaw was closed down after investors failed to provide the committed funding.

He was known for his Modernist architecture. He was first employed as an assistant to George Grey Wornum on the RIBA building on Portland Place, London W1. Then in 1933 he began working for the revered Russian-born Modernist Serge Chermayeff (who co-designed Britain‚Äôs most iconic 1930s building, the De La Warr Pavilion, acting as the principal assistant for Shrub‚Äôs Wood in Chalfont St Giles, Buckinghamshire. Geoffrey Bazeley started his architectural practice in Penzance in 1936 and after the war opened branches in St Austell and Plymouth. He went into partnership with Peter Barbary. The firm had a very good reputation and won an award for Housing in the Isles of Scilly in 1950.

These graves have been traditionally marked with the Red Hand of Ulster. Many Belfast Republicans are buried in their family graves and as such do not fall under the association's care. However, in addition to maintaining particular plots and monuments, the association has endeavoured to direct local commemoration committees to maintain some family graves which, for some reason may have fallen into disrepair.National Graves Association Booklet, 30 July 2007, see: http://www.anphoblacht.com/news/detail/20088 The association has a committee of eleven members.

Elisabeth of Greater Poland (; ) ( 1152 ‚Äì 2 April 1209) was a Polish princess of the House of Piast and, by her two marriages, Duchess of Bohemia and Margravine of Lusatia. She was a daughter of Mieszko III the Old, Duke of Greater Poland and from 1173 High Duke of Poland, by his first wife, Elisabeth, daughter of King B√©la II of Hungary.K.

The Hungarian origin of Mieszko III's first wife is undisputed among chroniclers and historians; however, her exact parentage remains controversial. See her wikipedia article for further reading. Elisabeth's birthdate is unknown. Medieval sources do not even indicate whether the Hungarian princess was her mother. Elizabeth is believed to have been her daughter only because both had the same name.K. Jasi≈Ñski, Rodow√≥d pierwszych Piast√≥w, second edition, Pozna≈Ñ, 2004, p. 240.

Life Duchess of Bohemia Around 1173 Elisabeth was married to Sobƒõslav II, Duke of Bohemia. This union was a part of the multiple dynastic arrangements made by Duke Mieszko III. As a result of this agreement, in 1176 Polish troops helped Duke Sobƒõslav II in his fight against the House of Babenberg, rulers of Austria. In 1178 Prince Frederick (Sobƒõslav II's cousin) besieged Prague; Elisabeth, who at that time was there, was then captured by Frederick, but soon was set free. On 27 January 1179 Sobƒõslav II was completely defeated in battle on the outskirts of Prague. He took refuge in Sk√°la castle, and after a long siege, Frederick won at the end of 1179 and became in the new ruler of Bohemia.F.

Margravine of Lusatia Elisabeth never returned to Poland. Soon after her husband died (end January or early February 1180), she married with Conrad, fifth son of Dedi V, Margrave of Lusatia. They had three children: one son, Conrad, and two daughters, Matilda and Agnes.According to some sources, she died childless. K. Pieradzka, El≈ºbieta, [in:] Polski S≈Çownik Biograficzny, vol. VI, 1948, p. 259. On 16 August 1190, Margrave Dedi V died, and his domains were divided between his two surviving sons: the eldest, Dietrich, inherited the counties of Sommerschenburg and Groitzsch (as eldest heir of his mother) and the second, Conrad, received the Margraviate of Lusatia (the main paternal domain) and the county of Eilenburg. In consequence, Elisabeth became in Margravine consort of Lusatia and Countess consort of Eilenburg. About her role in the Lusatian court there are no messages. Death and aftermath At the beginning of 1209, Conrad II defeated the army of Elisabeth's half-brother, W≈Çadys≈Çaw III Spindleshanks, in the Battle of Lubusz. It is assumed that this experience may have contributed to the death of Elisabeth in April 1209.B. Zientara, Henryk Brodaty i jego czasy, Warszawa 1997, p. 183. A year later, on 6 May 1210, Conrad II died. Elisabeth is buried at Dobrilugk Abbey. Her only son, Conrad, died in boyhood; Agnes, the youngest daughter, married Henry V, Count Palatine of the Rhine, but they had no children. Elisabeth's many descendants issued from her eldest daughter Matilda and her husband Albert II, Margrave of Brandenburg.

(2003). Serotonylation of small GTPases is a signal transduction pathway that triggers platelet alpha-granule release. Cell. 115(7):851-62. It occurs through the modification of proteins by the attachment of serotonin on their glutamine residues. This happens through the enzyme transglutaminase and the creation of glutamyl-amide bonds. This process occurs following serotonin transportation into the cell rather on plasma membranes as with the brief interactions that serotonin has when it activates 5-HT receptors. Functions Serotonylation is the process by which serotonin effects the exocytosis of alpha-granules from platelets (also known as thrombocytes). This involves the serotonylation of small GTPases such as Rab4 and RhoA. It has been suggested that \\"further understanding of the specific hormonal role of 5-HT in hemostasis and thrombosis is important to possibly prevent and treat deleterious hemorrhagic and cardiovascular disorders.\\" Serotonylation has recently identified as playing a critical role in pulmonary hypertension.Guilluy C, Eddahibi S, Agard C, Guignabert C, Izikki M, Tu L, Savale L, Humbert M, Fadel E, Adnot S, Loirand G, Pacaud P. (2009). RhoA and Rho kinase activation in human pulmonary hypertension: role of 5-HT signaling. Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 179(12):1151-8. Serotonylation also through small GTPases is involved in the process by which serotonin controls the release of insulin from beta cells in the pancreas and so the regulation of blood glucose levels.Paulmann N, Grohmann M, Voigt JP, Bert B, Vowinckel J, Bader M, Skelin M, Jevsek M, Fink H, Rupnik M, Walther DJ. (2009). Intracellular serotonin modulates insulin secretion from pancreatic beta-cells by protein serotonylation. PLoS Biol. 7(10):e1000229. This role helps explain why defects in transglutaminase can lead to glucose intolerance. Though small GTPases are involved, the existence of a large amount of protein-bound serotonin suggests the presence of yet unidentified other serotonylation interactions. Serotonylation of proteins other than small GTPases underlies the regulation of vascular smooth muscle \\"tone\\" in blood vessels including the aorta.Watts SW, Priestley JR, Thompson JM. (2009). Serotonylation of vascular proteins important to contraction. PLoS One. 4(5):e5682. This may occur through serotonylation modifying proteins integral to the contractility and the cytoskeleton such as alpha-actin, beta-actin, gamma-actin, myosin heavy chain and filamin A History According to some serotonin was \\"named for its source (sero-) and ability to modify smooth muscle tone (tonin)\\" an effect that may be dependent (some controversy exists) upon serotonylation. The term serotonylation was created in 2003 by Diego J. Walther and colleagues of the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics in a paper in the journal Cell.

They were prominent Roman Catholics and Walter Blount was created a baronet in 1624 (see Blount baronets). As Royalist supporters and therefore on the losing side during the English Civil War they suffered financial difficulties in the 17th century but their fortunes recovered following the English Restoration of 1660. In 1730 Sir Edward Blount commissioned Francis Smith of Warwick to design a new mansion house for the estate at Mawley. It is built on a rectangular plan of nine by seven bays with a nine bay three storey entrance front to the north east. The advanced three central bays carry Doric pilasters and pediment. The garden front to the south west is similar in design and decoration with a central entrance approached by a double flight of steps with wrought iron balustrades. The house is particularly noted for its Baroque interiors, plasterwork by Francesco Vassalli and the Adam style dining room.Shropshire John Newman and Nikolaus Pevsner (2006) p398 Lady Elizabeth Blount had married the 9th baronet and she brought up their family here. Afterwards she attracted much attention as an exponent of the flat earth theory, conducting convincing, but flaws experiments to prove the claim. The Blounts were in residence until the mid-20th century. In 1962 the house was sold to Anthony Galliers Pratt, who carried out a total restoration and whose son, Rupert, remains in residence.

Life His parents were Paul Jodrell, Solicitor General to Frederick Prince of Wales, and his wife Elizabeth, daughter of Richard Warner, of North Elmham, in Norfolk. They had three sons: Richard Paul Jodrell, Sir Paul Jodrell and Henry Jodrell. Jodrell was born 13 November 1745; and, having lost his father in 1751, lived in possession of his paternal estates for nearly 80 years. He was educated at Eton College and at Hertford College, Oxford; and his attachment to his classical studies was evinced by his compositions in the Musae Etonenses, and by subsequent more laborious publications. To the supplementary Notes of Potter's Aeschylus, printed in 1778, he was a contributor; in 1781 he published, in two volumes 8vo., Illustrations of Euripides, on the Ion and Bacchae; and in 1790 another volume, On the Akestis, the modern drama, also, as well as the ancient, shared Jotlrell's attention. A Widow and no Widow, a dramatic piece of three acts by biro, was acted at the Haymarket in 1779, and printed in 1780, 8vo. It appears, from The Monthly Review (vol. Ixv. p. 233.), that living characters were depicted among the dramatis persona: \\"the artist is a coarse painter, but commonly hits offa striking likeness\\". At the same theatre, in 1783, was performed with success his Seeing is Believing, in one act, printed in 1786. His tragedy, called \\"The Persian Heroine\\", having been rejected by the managers of the two great theatres (the particulars of which transactions are given in the Literary Anecdotes, vol. ix. p. 2.), was printed in 1786, 8vo. and 4 to. In the following year he published \\"Select Dramatic Pieces; some of which have been acted on provincial theatres, others have been written for private performance and country amusement\\"; and consisting of, Who's Afraid? a farce; the Boarding School Miss, a comedy; One and All, a farce; The Disguise, a comedy (It was the first stage-play in Bengali produced in Kolkata was by a Russian adventurer-cum-Indologist, Lebedev, in 1795Raha, Kironmoy, Calcutta Theatre 1835-1944, in Calcutta, the Living City, Vol I, edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, p187, Oxford University Press, ); The Musico, a farce; and The Bulse, a dramatic piece. He also published in 4to. 1785, The Knight and Friars, an historic tale, from Heywood's Tuvelvcelov\\", - \\"the work of three mornings in the Christmas holidays.\\" In 1784 Jodrell became a member of the club founded at the Essex Head, for the purpose of cheering the declining days of Dr. Johnson; and, it is believed, that he and the late Chamberlain Clark, who died a few days before him, were \\"positively the last\\" survivors of that celebrated literary fraternity. Jodrell was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1772, and of the Society of Antiquaries in 1784. He was created D.C.L. at Oxford, 4 July. 1793. At the general election 1790, Jodrell was returned as one of the barons in Parliament for Seaford; but by the decision of a committee, which was not given until the second session, he was declared not duly elected on 19 March 1792. However, when Sargent was made Clerk of the Ordnance in January 1794, he was re-elected for the same place; but after the clerkship's dissolution in 1796 he did not again sit in the House. With advancing years, Jodrell suffered mental deterioration, and by the mid-1820s he was fully incapacitated. It became necessary to throw legal protection over his person and property, which was effected, after the proper investigation, before a commission de lunatico inquirendo. He died in Portland Place, London on 26 January 1831. Family Vertue Jodrell, portrait c.1775 by Joshua Reynolds (Detroit Institute of Arts) Jodrell married 19 May. 1772, his second cousin, Vertue, eldest daughter and co-heiress of Edward Hase, of Salle, in Norfolk, who was the second son of John Hase, of Great Melton, in Norfolk, by Mary, daughter of Edward Lombe, of Weston, and aunt to Jodrell's mother. By this lady, who died 23 May. 1806, he had five sons and two daughters: 1. Paul, and 2. Paul, who both died in infancy; 3. Sir Richard Paul Jodrell, of Magdalen Hall, Oxford, M. A. 1806, who succeeded to his baronetcy in 1817, on the death of his great uncle Sir John Lombe, who took that name instead of Hase in 1762, and was created a Baronet in 1784; he married, in 1814, Amelia Caroline King, daughter of the Earl of Kingston, and has several children; 4. Edward Jodrell, of Trinity College, Oxford, M.A. 1811; he married, in 1812, Mary, fourth daughter of W. Lowndes Stone, of Brightwell, in Oxfordshire, Esq., and has issue; 5. the Rev.

The spectrum of the star is displaying emission lines of hydrogen overlaid on the star's normal spectra. This may be caused by the impact of infalling gas on the star's outer envelope, combined with the signature of a strong outflowing wind near the star. Mass is accreting onto the star at the rate of about times the mass of the Sun per year. RU Lupi has an estimated mass of 0.6‚Äì0.7 times the mass of the Sun and 1.6 times the Sun's radius. It is radiating more than double the luminosity of the Sun, at an effective temperature of about 3,950 K. RU Lupi is surrounded by a circumstellar disk of dust that has a combined mass of up to 0.032 times the mass of the Sun. The particles in the disk vary in size, but range up to a centimeter in cross-section. The star exhibits periodic radial velocity variations that are attributed to stellar spots on the surface of the star, based on the correlation between the radial velocity and the bisector inverse slope (a quantity that parametrises the shape of the spectral lines). The time period of the variations makes it unlikely that they are caused by stellar pulsations as these would be expected to occur on much shorter timescales (hours rather than days), and the correlation with the bisector inverse slope makes it unlikely that an orbiting companion is responsible as reflex motion would not cause the line profile variations.

It has branches in South Australia, Victoria- Tasmania, New South Wales, Western Australia and the Australian Capital Territory. Its membership includes people that have successfully promoted electoral reform.Why We Chose Proportional Representation, (The Australian Senate, John Ur) The Society regularly reviews and makes submissions on electoral reform within Australia with a focus on multi-member single transferable vote - proportional representation voting systems. It has made submissions to international organizations including the United Nations and the New Zealand Parliament. History A wall plaque at the Townhouse Hotel in Melrose, Scotland, dedicated to Catherine Helen Spence The Society's began before the commencement of Australia as a Federation with Catherine Helen Spence as one of its founding members. See details of the growth and success of quota-preferential proportional representation in Australia, particularly at the national level. Catherine Helen Spence's 1861 booklet, A Plea for Pure Democracy, helped the early formation of a proportional representation group called the 'Effective Voting League of South Australia'. Miss Catherine Spence was the first female candidate at a public election in the then British Empire when she stood unsuccessfully at the 1897 election (under the multiple vote ) for the 1897 Australasian Federal Convention. A statue in Light Square in Adelaide, unveiled on 10 March 1986 by Her Majesty the Queen, commemorates Spence. The PRSA later launched its reprint of her booklet there. She is remembered by her autobiography, and was depicted on the Australian $5 banknote issued for the Centenary of Federation, in 2001. The PRSA's SA Branch (the Electoral Reform Society of South Australia) influenced the replacement of the first party list system used, briefly, for Australian parliamentary elections, introduced by the Dunstan Labor Government in 1973, by direct election using the present quota-preferential form of proportional representation that the SA Electoral Act 1985 prescribes for elections for SA's Legislative Council. The SA Constitution Act 1934 requires a referendum before either House can be abolished, but does not specify or entrench the electoral system. Advocacy The Society advocates the use of Hare-Clark proportional voting, a form of the Single Transferable Vote method (STV) that is currently in use for elections in Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory. It has published a quarterly newsletter entitled Quota Notes. The Society has also published educational documents and aids such as * Rules for Counting Single Transferable Votes * The Gerrymander Wheel, a simple calculator to demonstrate the perceived futility of drawing geographical boundaries in a single-member electorate system.Computerized demonstration of the Society's gerrymander wheel Issues The Society has raised issues in relation to the conduct of public elections in Australia, which include: * Robson Rotation, the need to randomly order candidates' listings in the printing of ballot papers so as to minimize the effect of donkey voting * The rules for the calculation of the surplus transfer value in the distribution of preferences in proportional representation counts. * Opposition to the voting device imposed on certain Australian proportional representation elections * Filling casual vacancies by countback, which is a form of direct election, rather than by the party appointment system used to fill Senate and Legislative Council casual vacancies. * Electronic voting, and the introduction and use of computer technology in the conduct of elections Submissions to Government The Proportional Representation Society has made submissions to governments which have influenced the development and formation of Australia's electoral systems, as can be seen at its News pages. Public discussion and forums The Society holds and participates in public meetings and forums on electoral reform in various parts of Australia. There is a 2009 presentation by Malcolm Mackerras, an electoral analyst and political journalist.

Museum Bredius is a museum named after Abraham Bredius on the Lange Vijverberg in The Hague. It is remarkable for its collection of etchings and paintings, but is most attractive to visitors for its accurate restoration of the 18th-century Herenhuis interior with period furnishings. History The house was built together with its neighbor (numbers 14 & 15) by the architect Pieter de Swart in 1755, and was home to a series of important Heren up to the 1930s, when it was purchased by Frits Lugt, to house his massive collection of drawings and prints that later (along with the initial donation by Cornelis Hofstede de Groot (1863‚Äì1930), formed the basis for the Rijksbureau voor Kunsthistorische Documentatie (RKD), and is now mostly housed in the Koninklijke Bibliotheek, National Library of the Netherlands, or (KB). In 1955 the house was purchased by the city of the Hague for the Bredius collection, which until then was housed in the former home of its donor, Abraham Bredius (Amsterdam, 1855 - Monaco, 1946). That house on the Prinsengracht 6 had housed the collection until 1985, when it closed its doors due to a dip in the number of visitors, combined with a subsidy stop. Friends of the museum created the Bredius Genootschap that took the collection on tour, which met with great success. When the genootschap finally had enough funding to reopen in a permanent location, the old house could not be used. The decision to move to the present location was made possible with the gift of a generous sponsor to remodel it in the original Louis XV style. It has been home to the Bredius Museum since 1990. Abraham Bredius Abraham Bredius was the son of a gunpowder manufacturer who left him a large fortune to spend in the arts. He was a very learned man and writer of many articles and books on art history, who became known internationally as a Rembrandt expert. He became director of the Mauritshuis in The Hague and in that capacity devoted himself to scientific research.Bredius biography in English on museum website When he moved to Monaco for health reasons in 1922, he believed that the climate was bad for his paintings, and he left them in his old home as a museum, with the promise that they would go to the city on his death. In Monaco he wrote his books on Jan Steen and Rembrandt. He was embroiled in many controversial academical battles over various aspects of art history, such as attributions of paintings by Jan Steen and Rembrandt, or the proper way to present and build a museum collection. He was unable to work together with Cornelis Hofstede de Groot, which is why the Museum Bredius is now totally separate from the RKD, which ironically has its roots in the same building today. Paintings Tobias and Sarah in Prayer with the Angel Raphael and the Demon, painting restored in 1996 by rejoining Bredius's angel half with the marriage bed half formerly owned by the Jewish refugee Jacques Goudstikker. It was the subject of a dispute about nazi plunder. The collection is represented by over 150 artists, with illustrious names such as Albert Cuyp, Anthony van Dyck, Melchior de Hondecoeter, Adriaen van Ostade, Quiringh van Brekelenkam, and Rembrandt. Bredius only kept pieces which were of academic interest in the art history field, such as the only known landscape example by the seascape painter Cornelis Claesz van Wieringen, or a mutilated piece that was originally a biblical scene by Jan Steen of the marriage of Tobias and Sarah, that had been cut down into two genre pieces in the 19th century and sold separately. He donated more than 46 paintings he attributed himself to the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam. He tended to only keep the masterpieces, which were the first known work by many artists when they were accepted as a master into a local Guild of St. Luke. Other objects The museum contains a large collection of silver, including 70 examples by Amsterdam silversmiths from the 17th to 19th centuries. There is also a porcelain collection with Chinese blue and German pieces to offset the historical themes in Delftware.

He represented Bonavista Bay in the Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly from 1886 to 1906 as a Conservative and from 1913 to 1916 as a member of the Fishermen's Protective Union.  Biography  He was born in Port Medway, Nova Scotia, the son of Alred Morine and Mary Dolliver, and was educated in Port Medway and Liverpool. Morine was editor for newspapers in Nova Scotia and then for the Evening Mercury in St. John's. He ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the Newfoundland assembly in 1885. James L. Noonan was named to the Executive Council in 1885, which required him to run for reelection: Noonan was defeated by Morine in an 1886 by-election. In 1892, Morine entered the study of law at Dalhousie University, was called to the Newfoundland and Nova Scotia bars in 1894 and set up practice in St. John's. Morine ran unsuccessfully for a Nova Scotia seat in the Canadian House of Commons in 1892. He married Alice Mason in 1894. In 1894, Morine convinced the Tory opposition to file petitions against a number of elected Liberals under the Corrupt Practices Act; this resulted in 15 Liberals, including the Premier William Whiteway, and one Independent member being unseated and the temporary return of the Tories to power. Morine was named colonial secretary in the Executive Council. The unseated members were barred from running in future elections; however, this restriction was later removed when the Liberals returned to power following a series of by-elections to fill the vacated seats. During the brief Conservative time in power, the colony suffered a financial crisis after two banks failed unexpectedly. When the Conservatives returned to power again in 1897, Morine was named to the Executive Council as Minister of Finance. He negotiated a long-term contract with Robert Gillespie Reid for the expansion of the railway in Newfoundland; the contract was unpopular with both Newfoundlanders and the British government because it was believed to be too generous to the Reid family. At the time, Morine was also acting as solicitor for the Reids. The Liberals were returned to power in 1900, with the railway contract being a major issue in the election. Morine was now leader of the Conservative opposition. In 1906, he resigned his seat in the Newfoundland assembly, moved to Toronto, was called to the Ontario bar and set up practice in Toronto. Morine ran unsuccessfully in the riding of Shelburne and Queen's in the 1908 federal election. He returned to Newfoundland in 1912 and was elected to the assembly in a by-election held the following year. He resigned his seat in 1916 and returned to Toronto. Morine was named Minister of Justice in the Newfoundland Executive Council in 1919; he was defeated by William Coaker when he ran for reelection. He served in the Legislative Council of Newfoundland from 1924 to 1928. He was knighted in 1928. Morine died in Toronto at the age of 87.

Biography Early life and career Laney was born in 1913 in Weston. He graduated from the University of Otago with a BA in 1937. He was also a New Zealand Universities rugby and cricket blue and later Otago rugby captain. Laney then became a teacher of agriculture at Waitaki Boys' High School. Political career Laney's political career began in 1951 when he was elected as a member of the Oamaru Borough Council in a by-election. He was then Mayor of Oamaru for 19 years from 1956 to 1975. From 1945 until 1956 he was an executive member of the Oamaru branch of the National Party but he resigned to join the Labour Party in order to contest the mayoralty. His resignation did not endear him to the local National Party faithful. This was compounded by the fact that the incumbent mayor he defeated, Michael Francis Edward Cooney, was a prominent member of the local National Party. Laney contested the electorate in the , and defeated the incumbent, National's Allan Dick by a 390 votes majority. At the next election in , he was in turn defeated by National's Jonathan Elworthy. Three years later at the election, he stood for Labour in (Oamaru having been abolished) where he again finished runner-up to Elworthy. Laney was described as a man of integrity not prepared to compromise his principles and opposed the influence liquor industry lobbyists had over politicians during his time as an MP. Later life and death In 1990 he was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal. Laney died on 7 August 1998 in Christchurch.

Thorkelson, Derek J., 1996, Subduction of diverging plates and the principles of slab window formation, Tectonophysics, v. 255, p. 47-63 Formation of a slab window produces an area where the crust of the over-riding plate is lacking a rigid lithospheric mantle component and thus is exposed to hot asthenospheric mantle (for a diagram of this, see the link below). This produces anomalous thermal, chemical and physical effects in the mantle that can dramatically change the over-riding plate by interrupting the established tectonic and magmatic regimes. In general, the data used to identify possible slab windows comes from seismic tomography and heat flow studies.van Wijk, J.W., Govers, R., Furlong, K.P., 2001, Three-dimensional thermal modeling of the California upper mantle: a slab window vs. stalled slab, Earth and Planetary Letters, v. 186, p. 175-186  Effects  As a slab window develops, the mantle in that region becomes increasingly hot and dry. The decrease in hydration causes arc volcanism to diminish or stop entirely, as magma production in subduction zones generally results from hydration of the mantle wedge due to de-watering of the subducting slab. Slab-window magmatism may then replace this melting, and can be produced by multiple processes, including increased temperatures, mantle circulation producing interaction of supra- and sub-slab mantle, partial melting of subducted slab edges and extension in the upper plate. Mantle flowing upward through the slab window in order to compensate for the decreased lithospheric volume can also produce decompression melting. Slab window melts are distinguished from calc-alkaline subduction-related magmas by their different chemical compositions. The increase in temperature caused by the presence of a slab window can also produce anomalous high temperature metamorphism in the region between the trench and the volcanic arc.Groome, Wesley G., Thorkelson, Derek J., 2009, The three-dimensional thermo-mechanical signature of ridge subduction and slab window migration: Tectonophysics v. 464, p. 70-83  Geometry  The geometry of a slab window depends primarily on the angle the ridge intersects the subduction zone and the dip angle of the down-going plate. Other influential factors include the rates of divergence and subduction as well as heterogeneities found within specific systems. There are two end-member scenarios in terms of the geometry of a slab window: the first is when the subducted ridge is perpendicular to the trench, producing a V-shaped window, and the second is when the ridge is parallel to the trench, causing a rectangular window to form. Guillaume, Benjamin et al. 2010, mantle flow and dynamic topography associated with slab window openings: Insights from laboratory models: Tectonophysics v. 496, p. 83-98  Examples  The North American Cordillera is a well-studied plate margin that provides a good example of the effects a slab window can have on an over-riding continental plate. Beginning in the Cenozoic, the fragmentation of the Farallon Plate as it subducted caused slab windows to open that then generated anomalous features in the North American Plate. These effects include distinct fore-arc volcanism and extension in the plate which may be a contributing factor to the formation of the Basin and Range Province.Thorkelson, Derek J., Taylor, Richard P., 1989, Cordilleran slab windows: Geology, v. 17, p. 833-836Zandt, G., Humphreys, E., 2008, Toroidal mantle flow through the western U.S. slab window: Geology v. 36, p. 295-298, The northward younging of Pemberton Belt volcanism in southwestern British Columbia, Canada was probably related to a northward moving slab window edge under North America 29 to 6.8 million years ago. In addition to the fossil slab windows of the Cenozoic seen in North America, there are other regions along the Pacific Rim (e.g. in California, Mexico, Costa Rica, Patagonia and the Antarctic Peninsula) that exhibit active ridge subduction producing slab windows.

In radionuclide ventriculography, the radionuclide has the property of circulating through the cardiac chambers, availing for studies of the pumping function of the heart. In contrast, in myocardial perfusion imaging, the radionuclide is taken up by the myocardial cells, making its presence correlating with myocardial perfusion or viability of the cells. Radionuclide ventriculography is done to evaluate coronary artery disease (CAD), valvular heart disease, congenital heart diseases, cardiomyopathy, and other cardiac disorders. It exposes patients to less radiation than do comparable chest x-ray studies. However, the radioactive material is retained in the patient for several days after the test, during which sophisticated radiation alarms may be triggered, such as in airports.Merck manuals > Radionuclide Imaging Last full review/revision May 2009 by Michael J. Shea, MD. Content last modified May 2009 Radionuclide ventriculography has largely been replaced by echocardiography, which is less expensive, and does not require radiation exposure. Radionuclide ventriculography gives a much more precise measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) than a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). Transthoracic echocardiogram is highly operator dependant, therefore radionuclide ventriculography is a more reproducible measurement of LVEF. Its primary use today is in monitoring cardiac function in patients receiving certain chemotherapeutic agents (anthracyclines: doxorubicin or daunorubicin) which are cardiotoxic. The chemotherapy dose is often determined by the patient's cardiac function. In this setting, a much more accurate measurement of ejection fraction, than a transthoracic echocardiogram can provide, is necessary.

The Federal style, cobblestone house consists of a 2-story main block with a -story frame wing. It was built about 1839 and is constructed of irregular, rough, moderate sized cobbles. The house is among the approximately 170 surviving cobblestone buildings in Wayne County.See also: It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Historical Significance The Charles Bullis House (1839‚Äì42) is a well-preserved, architecturally significant representative example of nineteenth century cobblestone residential architecture. Cobblestone construction in the pre-Civil War period is almost exclusively found in the Western and Central New York region. One of the 170 surviving cobblestone buildings in Wayne County, its design incorporates both Federal and Greek Revival style features, as was common in vernacular buildings of the 1830s. The location of the house reflects the typical pattern of nineteenth century settlement of Wayne County. The farm site is situated adjacent to the Barge Canal (originally, the Erie Canal) on a major historic north-south road linking the village of Macedon and Macedon Center with the Lake Ontario shore, and one-half mile from the principal and historic east-west travel route (Rt. 31) traversing the southern portion of Wayne County. The house remained virtually intact and under the ownership of the Bullis Family until 1984. Charles H. Bullis, his wife Ellen, and children, Abraham, Emma, and Keley, left Manchester Vermont in November 1838 to journey west to settle in Ohio. They traveled across New York State by canal boat on the Erie Canal and stopped at Macedon to visit Charles's sister. They decided to settle there, and, on April 1, 1839, Charles purchased a 59-acre farm adjacent to the Erie Canal from Charles and Lydia Smith for $2,631.64. Little is known about Charles Bullis. Like many farmers from New England, Bullis presumably left the rocky soils of Vermont to seek richer farm lands. In Macedon, Wayne County, he found a milder climate, fertile soils enriched by the nearby Mud Creek, which were favorable for growing wheat and corn and raising livestock, as well as the convenience of conveying produce to markets by canal. In addition, the property was only one-half mile from the main east- west road which ran between Pittsford and Palmyra, and situated on a major north-south road to the Lake Ontario shore. When the Bullis family first settled on the farm, it is believed that they lived in a small, one-story frame building that had been moved from a former Erie Canal work camp settlement located on the property near the canal to the site of the present frame ell on the west side of the main portion of the house. During the 1983 restoration, the east wall of the existing frame ell was removed, ~exposing the west wall of the cobblestone house. The outline of a one-story frame building was evident as large stones and rough mortar filled the space within the outline, indicating an inside wall; above the outline showed the finished cobblestone which was originally the outside wall of the main house. Construction of the main cobblestone house began in 1839 and was completed in 1842. It is believed that the family gathered small fieldstones on the farm for the construction. The solidification of the mortar was a much slower process than the hard, fast-drying Portland cement of today. Work on the enlargement of the Erie Canal was also in progress, and the mason working on the Bullis House may have also been a canal worker. The existing one-and-half story ell replaced the original frame structure about 1845, based upon material evidence excavated by archeologists from the Rochester Museum and Science Center in 1979. Stone foundations of another structure attached to the ell were revealed and dated about 1855. . In 1863 Charles Bullis deeded the property to his son, Dr. Abraham Bullis, who lived and practiced medicine in the neighboring town of Farmington. Charles's wife Ellen and his daughter Emma retained life use of the house, unt1l 1879 and 1905 respectively. In 1866 upon the death of both Charles and Abraham, the property was passed on to Abraham's son Abraham R. Bullis (1854-1928), who was a civil engineer. His children, Charles and Nettie, retained ownership of the property until their deaths in 1974 and 1979 respectively. Six of the 59 acres (approximately ten acres were taken for the canal and railroad rights of way) were bequeathed to the Landmark Society, while the remaining acreage was left to the town of Macedon (now Bullis Park). In 1984, the property was sold as a single family home. The Charles Bullis House is significant as a distinctive example of early nineteenth century cobblestone architecture. This construction technique is primarily found in Central and Western New York and appears to be the result of both geologic and historic factors. Cobble-sized stones, deposited by the Ice Age glacier about 40,000 years ago, are abundant along the southern Ontario Lake plain. According to a study by Robert Roudabush, approximately 60% of more than 660 cobblestone buildings in New York State are located in an area between the Genesee River and Syracuse, which has an abundance of drumlins and other major stone deposits. Another geologic factor important to the cobblestone architecture phenomenon is the presence of limestone outcroppings found in this region. The lime processed from the rock was used in making hydraulic cement for the construction of the Erie Canal and was a primary ingredient for making mortar used in cobblestone construction. The men who built cobblestone structures are believed to have been skilled masons who worked on the Erie Canal, from its initial construction (1817-1825) through its periods of enlargement (1832-1862). In fact, the period of cobblestone architecture coincides with the period of Erie Canal construction and reconstruction: the earliest structures built about 1825 and the last erected about 1860. The Charles Bullis House exemplifies the early period of cobblestone architecture (approximately 1825-1845), characterized by rows of rough, rounded field stones of irregular shape and moderate size, and separated by horizontal mortar joints in the shape of a projecting V-shape. While most cobblestone structures had quoins and lintels of limestone or sandstone, the Charles Bullis House is one of only eight cobblestone buildings in Wayne County with brick quoins and lintels. . While cobblestone buildings were constructed for a variety of uses including churches, schools, stores, barns, smokehouses, and others, most cobblestone buildings were farmhouses, erected after farmers had cleared their lands of forests (and fieldstones) for cash crops. The farmers became prosperous from the markets made available by the canal and many took advantage of the abundance of cobblestones and skilled masons to build these distinctive homes. . Although built in 1839, during the period when the Greek Revival style was predominant, the Charles Bullis House, like many cobblestone farmhouses erected before 1840, retains the plan and massing of the Federal style and is refined with both Federal and Greek Revival style details. The house's characteristic Federal elements include the rectangular plan, low pitched roof, symmetrically spaced windows, semi-elliptical louvered fans in the gables, inside rectangular chimneys located at the gable ends, quoins, and window lintels with splayed ends. Although the cornice is narrow, following the Federal style, the moldings are Greek Revival in scale. The doorway is well-proportioned, with sidelights and narrow pilasters, but contains a simply glazed architrave instead of a more elegant Federal style fanlight. Inside the architrave trim moldings throughout most of the house and the two simple fireplace mantels reflect the Greek Revival influence. The simple, but elegant, stair banister and the molded trim and block corner moldings found in the southeast room on the first floor are also typical Federal details.

Like other archdeacons, they are administrators in the diocese at large (having oversight of parishes in roughly one-third of the diocese). The present incumbent is the Venerable Andy Wooding Jones. History The first Archdeacon of Rochester is recorded , at approximately the same sort of time as archdeacons were being appointed across the country. At this point, this archdeacon was the sole archdeacon in the diocese, functioning as an assistant to the bishop. The archidiaconal and diocesan boundaries remained similar for almost 750 years until 1 January 1846 when the three archdeaconries of Colchester, Essex and St Albans from the Diocese of London were added to the diocese while all of west Kent but the Deanery of Rochester was given to the Diocese of Canterbury ‚Äì at this point, the diocese covered all of Essex. The archdeaconry of Rochester, having been reduced severely, was first suppressed at the next vacancy (Walter King's death in 1859) then held by the Archdeacon of St Albans. The archdeaconry was then given to Canon Cheetham, a residentiary canon of Rochester Cathedral and the bishop's examining chaplain, who held it until after the Kentish territory was returned. Those three archdeaconries created the new Diocese of St Albans in 1877, but the diocese received part of Surrey (which part was constituted into the Southwark archdeaconry the next year) a few months later: in 1879 the Kingston archdeaconry was split off from Southwark; those two archdeaconries were erected into the Diocese of Southwark in 1905 while west Kent was returned to the Rochester diocese ‚Äì immediately prior to that date the Diocese of Rochester covered a large portion of Surrey (now southern Greater London) immediately south of the Thames. Once again, Rochester was the sole archdeaconry of the diocese until it was split to create the Archdeaconry of Tonbridge in 1906; it was further split in 1955 to create the Archdeaconry of Bromley, so that there are today three archdeaconries in the present diocese, covering West Kent plus the two London boroughs of Bromley and Bexley ‚Äì an area broadly similar to that covered until 1846.

Directed by Joe Tornatore, the film was co-produced by Frank D. Russo together with Katherine Hawks, who wrote the script and also stars in a leading role, alongside of Daniel Goddard and Eric Etebari. Plot During a night at the opera, Estelle Henderson is embarrassed by her drunken fiance, John, but also attracted by a dark and mysterious young man in the audience. After the performance, John attacks Estelle's father, Dr. George Henderson, but is stopped by the young man, who introduces himself as Alex Stone. Alex and Estelle go out for dinner and fall in love. As it turns out, Alex is part of a vampire coven. Questioned by his fellow vampires, he reveals that he his tired of the emptiness of being a savage beast living in eternal darkness. Seeking help from Estelle's father, a famous medical research scientist, Alex confides in Estelle, explaining that he is a vampire but would prefer a mortal life with her. When approached, Dr. Henderson is incredulous at first but then is very interested in working with a vampire as this could further his research into immortality. However, Henderson's research is funded by Victor Price, head of the Illuminati, a multi-national crime syndicate, who hope to attain immortality through that research. Meanwhile, they are harvesting people for spare body parts. Through an informer, Price learns of Alex's case and allows Henderson's research to continue if Alex would in turn make him a vampire. Though Dr. Henderson unlocks the secret behind Alex's vampirism, Alex refuses to provide Price with immortality. He informs the Hendersons of Price's association with the Illuminati but then agrees to Estelle's enigmatic suggestion to \\"take advantage\\" of the Illuminati's power. Meanwhile, Alex's fellow vampires are lacking Alex's power to make the group disappear, have to contend with Marshall Pope, a vampire hunter working for Interpol who has been brought after the police discovered the existence of vampire attacks. With his help, the police manage to kill the other vampires, who are lacking Alex's power, though Pope is also killed. The police have also arrested one of Price's henchmen, Rex, in a failed drug trafficking operation. In a bargain, Rex reveals Price's role in the operation, prompting the police to put Price under surveillance. At the same time, Price and his associates receive the promised treatment and return to their mansion, taking Estelle with them. One of Price's henchman, Steven Mills, tries to stake Alex but is overpowered. Henderson and Alex rush to the mansion, where Price is showing all his power and wealth to Estelle in order to seduce her. Alex confronts Price and, as the police storm in, uses his powers of disappearance to vanish together with the Illuminati-turned-vampires. As the bystanders are looking on in bewilderment, the film shows Alex leaving the Illuminati to spend their eternal lifer in outer space, as he returns to earth. Over a year later, a news reporter notes the Hendersons' acquittal in the Illuminati trial, the unexplained disappearance of the Illuminati and their money, a rapid drop in crime and the absence of further sightings of vampires. The final scenes reveal that Estelle has pilfered the Illuminati accounts and donated the money to a charitable cause and now lives with non-vampiric Alex in a large house.

After 1919 he was an official of the Bolshevik Party until the victory of Joseph Stalin, when he was imprisoned. Rafes was a member of the 1917 Russian Constituent Assembly and also of the Central Council of Ukraine, the Petrograd Soviet, headed Jewish Bund in Kiev. In Kiev Rafes became a member of the Regional Committee in Protection of Revolution in Ukraine and served as the General Controller of the General Secretariat of Ukraine.General Secretariat of the Central Rada He was succeeded at this post by another Bundist, Aleksandr Zolotarev. When tensions within the Bund heightened, due to the pro- Bolshevik leaning of a part of the leadership, Moisei Rafes was the leader of the centrist wing of the Bund, while Mikhail Liber and Benjamin Kheifetz led the rightists. However, Rafes led the scissionist Kombund group in Kiev in February 1919, later joined by similar groups in Yekaterinoslav, Kharkov and Poltava, but the Kombund lasted only till May 1919, when it merged into the Komfarband. These moves were apparently motivated by the large-scale pogroms committed by all the armies present in Ukraine at the time, except the Red Army. After the refusal of the Soviet authorities to authorize the formation of a distinct Jewish Communist Party, Rafes, like other former Bundists Esther Frumkin, Alexander Chemerinsky and Rakhmiel Veinshtain, finally joined the upper echelons of the Yevsektsiya, the Jewish section of the Soviet Communist party (CPSU). Moisei Rafes was at the head of the artistic section of Sovkino and a member of the Sovkino board in the late 1920s and through 1930.

The area of the district is . Its administrative center is the rural locality (a selo) of Novolakskoye. As of the 2010 Census, the total population of the district was 28,556, with the population of Novolakskoye accounting for 20.8% of that number. History The area of the modern district was historically a part of Akkia, the homeland of the Akki Chechens (one of the nine Chechen tukkhums). During the Soviet times, it was incorporated as Aukh District of the Chechen-Ingush ASSR and included the territories of modern Novolaksky District along with parts of Kazbekovsky and Khasavyurtovsky Districts. In 1944, when the Chechens were deported to Siberia and Kazakhstan, Aukhovsky District was split, and Avars, Laks, Russians, and Kumyks were moved in to replace the deported Chechen population. Novolaksky District was resettled mainly by Laks (hence the name \\"Novolaksky\\"; literally \\"New Lak District\\"), but some Russians and Avars were settled there too. The mainly Chechen toponyms were replaced with Russian, Avar, and Lak ones. When the Chechens began returning in 1957, conflicts erupted, as they found others literally living in their houses. However, thankfully, the two sides came to an understanding. Neither Laks nor Chechens had much hatred for the other side, and both blamed Moscow for the conflict rather. Chechens understood that Laks had been forced against their will to move there, and did not want to be homeless; Laks understood that Akkia was the Chechens' historical home and they had nowhere else to go. The conflict is still being solved currently by the government of Dagestan with the help of local governments. Laks are being resettled, village by village, to the marsh north of Makhachkala, and Chechen names and the Chechen ownership have been restored to many villages. The process, however, is not complete, and there is still room for pitfalls in the negotiation process. Furthermore, there is still the problem of the Avar-settled former Chechen villages.

Located in the Portland metropolitan area along Interstate 205 on the eastside, after Bess Kaiser Hospital in north Portland closed, it was Kaiser's only hospital in the Portland area until Westside Medical Center opened in 2013. The hospital includes Clackamas County's only heart surgery facility. History Kaiser Permanente opened the Sunnyside hospital on Portland‚Äôs eastside in 1975. Politician Mary Wendy Roberts was treated at the hospital and underwent surgery in 1978 for internal bleeding. In 1983, the hospital contained 125 beds, which grew to 150 beds in 1985. The south wing at the facility opened in 1984 as doctors' offices after initially being planned as standard patient rooms with hospital beds. At completion of the structure, it was determined there was then over capacity in hospital beds, and the space was converted to offices. These offices were remodeled for $4 million in 2002 to 2003, re-opening as a 20-bed unit in 2003. The hospital treated Olympic figure skater Tonya Harding in March 1994 for injuries from an assault in a park. In 2000, the stroke unit was named as one of the top 100 in the nation by the HCIA-Sachs Institute. Parking garages were opened on the campus in 2003 and 2005. Kaiser Sunnyside completed construction of a four-story building at a cost of $88 million in 2007. An expanded oncology department with 20 beds opened in that wing in January 2009. In April 2009, the hospital opened a 40-bed cardiac unit used for open heart surgery. This unit includes three surgery suites and was in planning since 2003. Both the cardiac unit and expanded cancer care were part of a $150 million expansion that added with 170 beds and additional medical office space to the campus.

Coupling of embedded particles to the coarse-grained solvent is achieved through molecular dynamics. Method of simulation The solvent is modelled as a set of N point particles of mass m with continuous coordinates \\\\vec{r}_{i} and velocities \\\\vec{v}_{i}. The simulation consists of streaming and collision steps. During the streaming step, the coordinates of the particles are updated according to \\\\vec{r}_{i}(t+\\\\delta t_{\\\\mathrm{MPC}}) = \\\\vec{r}_{i}(t) + \\\\vec{v}_{i}(t) \\\\delta t_{\\\\mathrm{MPC}} where \\\\delta t_{\\\\mathrm{MPC}} is a chosen simulation time step which is typically much larger than a molecular dynamics time step. After the streaming step, interactions between the solvent particles are modelled in the collision step. The particles are sorted into collision cells with a lateral size a. Particle velocities within each cell are updated according to the collision rule :\\\\vec{v}_{i} \\\\rightarrow \\\\vec{v}_{\\\\mathrm{CMS}} + \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{R}} ( \\\\vec{v}_{i} - \\\\vec{v}_{\\\\mathrm{CMS}} ) where \\\\vec{v}_{\\\\mathrm{CMS}} is the centre of mass velocity of the particles in the collision cell and \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{R}} is a rotation matrix. In two dimensions, \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{R}} performs a rotation by an angle +\\\\alpha or -\\\\alpha with probability 1/2. In three dimensions, the rotation is performed by an angle \\\\alpha around a random rotation axis. The same rotation is applied for all particles within a given collision cell, but the direction (axis) of rotation is statistically independent both between all cells and for a given cell in time. If the structure of the collision grid defined by the positions of the collision cells is fixed, Galilean invariance is violated. It is restored with the introduction of a random shift of the collision grid. Explicit expressions for the diffusion coefficient and viscosity derived based on Green-Kubo relations are in excellent agreement with simulations. Simulation parameters The set of parameters for the simulation of the solvent are: * solvent particle mass m * average number of solvent particles per collision box n_{s} * lateral collision box size a * stochastic rotation angle \\\\alpha * kT (energy) * time step \\\\delta t_{\\\\mathrm{MPC}} The simulation parameters define the solvent properties, such as * mean free path \\\\lambda = \\\\delta t_{\\\\mathrm{MPC}} \\\\sqrt{kT/m} * diffusion coefficient D = \\\\frac{kT\\\\delta t_{\\\\mathrm MPC}}{2m} \\\\Bigg[ \\\\frac{d n_{s}} {(1-\\\\cos(\\\\alpha))(n_{s}-1+\\\\exp^{-n_{s}})}-1 \\\\Bigg] * shear viscosity u * thermal diffusivity D_{T} where d is the dimensionality of the system.

Plot Ghost hunter Carter Simms is offered $5,000 to stay a weekend in the Masterson house to investigate paranormal activity. The owner of the house also hires Colin Green as the videographer and Yvette Sandoval as a journalist. Together they set up equipment and begin searching for evidence of ghosts or paranormal activity. The group is then joined by Mary Young Mortensen, a young member of the Mastersons' church. She claims she was also sent by owner of the house to assist in the investigation. She also states that she is there to protect the reputations of the Mastersons because they were great members of their church. The group stays in the Masterson house for three days. Several mysterious things happen: The room temperature in the master bedroom lowers dramatically in a short period; a chair moves on its own; a gunshot and mysterious voices are recorded and some ghostly figures are recorded on video. By the beginning of day three, Colin gets a call from the owner of the house and it turns out Mary Young Mortensen was never supposed to be at the house; so Carter forces Mary to leave. Later that night, nothing much is happening, but the group reviews a video tape and sees a figure in the guest house. As they are going to investigate the guest house, we flash to a scene where Mary is on a radio talk show concerned about the people out to discredit the good name of the Mastersons. She convinces herself she needs to stop them and returns to the house. Mary then begins killing all members of the group, writes a note, and commits suicide much like the mother did in the opening scenes of the movie. It turns out Mary was the small child left by the mother in the opening scene. She was rescued before she drowned and apparently adopted by the first officer to arrive on the scene. As Mary is preparing for her suicide, she tells the sordid story of the Mastersons, involving the imprisonment, rape and torture of her mother who eventually became pregnant with her. The birth of Mary caused Mrs. Masterson to kill her family and Mary's mother. As the movie ends, it switches to a scene where Carter is seen looking at and into an infrared camera. She is now a ghost in the house, unable to leave along with the other ghosts.

She made her provincial debut for Eastern Province at the age of 12. In 1960, playing in South Africa's first Test match, she claimed the first wicket of the match, making her the first South African woman to take a Test wicket. Early life and career Jackson grew up in Sydenham and, being the only girl on the street, played cricket in the street with the local boys. She was unaware of women's cricket until she saw a game in progress one afternoon in 1956. Later that year, she made her first appearance in provincial cricket. Her debut for Eastern province, coming at the age of 12, almost certainly makes her the youngest senior provincial player in South African history. Jackson was well known in South Africa for her fast bowling, and was even advised by teammates that it was not necessary to bowl so quickly. Recalling this, Jackson recounts: \\"Shame, I still remembers how I split one of the girl's fingers open with one of my deliveries.\\" In 1960, eight days of trials were held to select a Test side to play the touring England team. Jackson, Eastern Province's only representative at the trials, caused an upset when she claimed the wickets of Joy Irwin and Eleanor Lambert, Natal's record-breaking openers for only 20 runs. Only the final day of the trial, she took the wickets of three of the previous day's high-scorers for 23 runs. Test career Playing in South Africa's first Test match, Jackson opened the bowling alongside Lorna Ward. When she trapped Kathleen Smith lbw she became the first woman to take a Test wicket in South Africa. Jackson had put on 11 runs in South Africa's first- innings, and didn't bat as they declared the second-innings. She only bowled 11 overs in the match; five in the first-innings and six in the second, finishing with match figures of 1/29 as the match was drawn. Due to the expense involved, Jackson couldn't participate in the second and third Tests; \\"We had to pay all our own travelling expenses and all our kit. I remember paying ¬£18 for my Springbok blazer. The hotels were paid for fortunately,\\" Jackson remembers. Just before the fourth Test, the England side played Eastern Province in a single-innings tour match. Jackson took 4/30 in the English innings, and then top-scored in the Eastern Province innings, scoring 39 before hitting her wicket. Jackson was able to travel with the English team to Cape Town to play in the fourth Test. Jackson went wicket-less in the first-innings of the fourth Test, conceding 17 runs in her 7 overs. She followed this up with her highest Test score of 24, partnering Yvonne van Mentz for 74 runs. In the second-innings, she took 1/13 in 6 overs, and finished her Test career with a bowling average of 29.50.

It neighbours Cranford St John. History The name of the two villages of Cranford derives from two Old English words meaning ford frequented by cranes or herons. The villages of Cranford St Andrew and Cranford St John are not named separately in the Domeday Survey of 1086 but the two names are mentioned separately in 1254. \\"St Andrew\\" and \\"St John\\" refer to the dedications of the parish churches. The earliest part of the Church of St Andrew dates from about 1200. There is also later 12th century and maybe 13th work. The hall was built in the early Georgian period and there have been later alterations. It was converted into flats in 1950. Iron ore was obtained in the Cranford St Andrew district for many years to the east and west of the village. On the east side quarrying began to the east of Cranford Hall in 1873 continuing to 1882 or a little later. There are quarries still visible on the west side of the road. There was also a quarry on the east side of the road which was extended later. The ore was taken to a siding close to Cranford Railway Station (now closed) by horse and three-wheeled cart. From there it was taken away by train to be smelted. Quarrying began again to the east of the road in 1908 until 1919 and again from 1934 to 1955. Quarrying began to the west of the road, further north than before between 1940 and 1958. From 1908 until 1919 the ore was taken to the siding by steam operated metre gauge tramway. The later quarries used a steam operated standard gauge tramway. From 1946 to 56 there was also a gannister quarry near to the northernmost iron ore quarry. The gannister was taken to the main tramway by steam operated narrow gauge tramway. In the earlier periods quarrying was by hand with the aid of explosives. From 1918 a steam quarrying machine was introduced. From 1934 steam and diesel machines were used and electric machines were added to these from 1940. These quarries have not been landscaped and the quarry faces are still visible. On the west side of the village quarrying occurred between 1880 and 1889. The ore was taken to a railway siding west of the station by a tramway. It is not clear if horses or steam locomotives were used. In 1919 an adit was driven into the old quarry face and iron ore was mined using the pillar and stall method from then until 1926. In the latter stages the pillars holding the roof up were made narrower and after the mine was abandoned some of the tunnel roofs collapsed, causing sink holes or depressions in the ground. In some places they collapsed completely leaving gulleys with precipitous sides. Some of the holes and gulleys were later filled in. The mine was served by a cable operated tramway but ponies were used inside the mine and a larger horse at the tipping dock at the railway.Tonks Work already cited pages 36‚Äì45 There were also iron ore quarries and mines at Cranford St John.

As its name implies, a PD consists of two primer molecules that have attached (hybridized) to each other because of strings of complementary bases in the primers. As a result, the DNA polymerase amplifies the PD, leading to competition for PCR reagents, thus potentially inhibiting amplification of the DNA sequence targeted for PCR amplification. In quantitative PCR, PDs may interfere with accurate quantification. Mechanism of formation Primer dimer is formed and amplified in a three- step process A primer dimer is formed and amplified in three steps. In the first step, two primers anneal at their respective 3' ends (step I in the figure). If this construct is stable enough, the DNA polymerase will bind and extend the primers according to the complementary sequence (step II in the figure). An important factor contributing to the stability of the construct in step I is a high GC-content at the 3' ends and length of the overlap. The third step occurs in the next cycle, when a single strand of the product of step II is used as a template to which fresh primers anneal leading to synthesis of more PD product. Detection Primer dimers may be visible after gel electrophoresis of the PCR product. PDs in ethidium bromide-stained gels are typically seen as a 30-50 base-pair (bp) band or smear of moderate to high intensity and distinguishable from the band of the target sequence, which is typically longer than 50 bp. In quantitative PCR, PDs may be detected by melting curve analysis with intercalating dyes, such as SYBR Green I, a nonspecific dye for detection of double-stranded DNA. Because they usually consist of short sequences, the PDs denature at lower temperature than the target sequence and hence can be distinguished by their melting-curve characteristics. Preventing primer-dimer formation One approach to prevent PDs consists of physical-chemical optimization of the PCR system, i.e. changing the concentrations of primers, magnesium chloride, nucleotides, ionic strength and temperature of the reaction. This method is somewhat limited by the physical-chemical characteristics that also determine the efficiency of amplification of the target sequence in the PCR. Therefore, reducing PDs formation may also result in reduced PCR efficiency. To overcome this limitation, other methods aim to reduce the formation of PDs only, including primer design, and use of different PCR enzyme systems or reagents. Primer- design software Primer-design software uses algorithms that check for the potential of DNA secondary structure formation and annealing of primers to itself or within primer pairs. Physical parameters that are taken into account by the software are potential self-complementarity and GC content of the primers; similar melting temperatures of the primers; and absence of secondary structures, such as stem-loops, in the DNA target sequence. The primer design page of Leiden University Medical Center Hot-start PCR Because primers are designed to have low complementarity to each other, they may anneal (step I in the figure) only at low temperature, e.g. room temperature, such as during the preparation of the reaction mixture. Although DNA polymerases used in PCR are most active around 70 ¬∞C, they have some polymerizing activity also at lower temperatures, which can cause DNA synthesis from primers after annealing to each other. Several methods have been developed to prevent PDs formation until the reaction reaches working temperature (60-70 ¬∞C), and these include initial inhibition of the DNA polymerase, or physical separation of reaction components reaction until the reaction mixture reaches the higher temperatures. These methods are referred to as hot-start PCR. Wax: in this method the enzyme is spatially separated from the reaction mixture by wax that melts when the reaction reaches high temperature. Slow release of magnesium: DNA polymerase requires magnesium ions for activity, so the magnesium is chemically separated from the reaction by binding to a chemical compound, and is released into the solution only at high temperature US Patent application number 2007/0254327 Non-covalent binding of inhibitor: in this method a peptide, antibodyUS Patent number 5338671 or aptamerUS Patent number 6183967 are non-covalently bound to the enzyme at low temperature and inhibit its activity. After an incubation of 1‚Äì5 minutes at 95 ¬∞C, the inhibitor is released and the reaction starts. Cold-sensitive Taq polymerase: is a modified DNA polymerase with almost no activity at low temperature.US Patent number 6214557 Chemical modification: in this method a small molecule is covalently bound to the side chain of an amino acid in the active site of the DNA polymerase. The small molecule is released from the enzyme by incubation of the reaction mixture for 10‚Äì15 minutes at 95 ¬∞C. Once the small molecule is released, the enzyme is activated.US Patent number 5677152 Structural modifications of primers Another approach to prevent or reduce PD formation is by modifying the primers so that annealing with themselves or each other does not cause extension. HANDS (Homo-Tag Assisted Non-Dimer System): a nucleotide tail, complementary to the 3' end of the primer is added to the 5' end of the primer. Because of the close proximity of the 5' tail it anneals to the 3' end of the primer. The result is a stem-loop primer that excludes annealing involving shorter overlaps, but permits annealing of the primer to its fully complementary sequence in the target. Chimeric primers: some DNA bases in the primer are replaced with RNA bases, creating a chimeric sequence. The melting temperature of a chimeric sequence with another chimeric sequence is lower than that of chimeric sequence with DNA. This difference enables setting the annealing temperature such that the primer will anneal to its target sequence, but not to other chimeric primers. Blocked-cleavable primers: a method known as RNase H-dependent PCR (rhPCR), utilizes a thermostable RNase HII to remove a blocking group from the PCR primers at high temperature. This RNase HII enzyme displays almost no activity at low temperature, making the removal of the block only occur at high temperature. The enzyme also possess inherent primer:template mismatch discrimination, resulting in additional selection against primer-dimers. Preventing signal acquisition from primer dimers While the methods above are designed to reduce PD formation, another approach aims to minimize signal generated from PDs in quantitative PCR. This approach is useful as long as there are few PDs formed and their inhibitory effect on product accumulation is minor. Four steps PCR: used when working with nonspecific dyes, such as SYBR Green I. It is based on the different length, and hence, different melting temperature of the PDs and the target sequence. In this method the signal is acquired below the melting temperature of the target sequence, but above the melting temperature of the PDs.Four steps PCR Sequence-specific probes: TaqMan and molecular beacon probes generate signal only in the presence of their target (complementary) sequence, and this enhanced specificity precludes signal acquisition (but not possible inhibitory effects on product accumulation) from PDs.

Life She was the youngest child of Mieszko III the Old, Duke of Greater Poland and since 1173 High Duke of Poland, by his second wife Eudoxia, daughter of Grand Prince Iziaslav II of Kiev. Duchess On 26 April 1177 Anastasia married Bogislaw I, Duke of Pomerania. This marriage reinforced the alliance between Mieszko III and his western neighbors, who started soon before with the marriage of Anastasia's older sister Salomea with Ratibor, the eldest of Bogislaw I's two sons born from his first marriage with Walburgis (who died before 18 April 1172). During her marriage, Anastasia bore her husband two other sons, Bogislaw in 1178 and Casimir around 1180. The High Duke gained a faithful ally with this son-in-law, who was the only who supported him when he was exiled from Poland due to the rebellion of his eldest son (and Anastasia's half-brother) Odon. In 1181 Anastasia's father was able to reconquer Gniezno and Kalisz with the help of Duke Bogislaw I. They even took Pozna≈Ñ from Odon, who finally reconciled with his father one year later. Regency The deaths of Princes Ratibor (14‚Äì15 January 1183) and Wartislaw (18 February 1184), left Anastasia's sons as the only heirs of Duke Bogislaw I. On 18 March 1187 the Duke died while hunting near Sassnitz; at that time, his two surviving sons Bogislaw II and Casimir II were minors. For this, they succeeded in the Duchy as co-rulers under the regency of their mother, who was assisted in the government firstly by Wartislaw, castellan of Stettin (during 1187‚Äì1189) and later by Jaromar I, Prince of R√ºgen (during 1189‚Äì1198). However, the real authority over the Duchy of Pomerania was held by Anastasia until 1208, when her sons were declared adults and began their personal government. Later life Anastasia survived her sons: Casimir II was dead by the end of 1219 and Bogislaw II died on 24 January 1220. Four years later, on 7 July 1224, she issued a document under which she approved the foundation of a Norbertine monastery in Trzebiat√≥w, which was richly endowed by the Dowager Duchess, giving to them a part of her widow's seat (received after his marriage): twenty castles and seven villages. After the construction of the monastery was finished, Anastasia moved there, but she never took the religious vows. The last time Anastasia appeared in public was on 31 May 1240 her grandson Wartislaw III confirmed the foundation of the monastery. She died soon after that date and was buried in the Norbertine monastery in Trzebiat√≥w. References *O≈º√≥g K., Anastazja, [in:] Piast dynasty.

The Cotton Tree is a Ceiba pentandra, also known commonly as a kapok tree, a historic symbol of Freetown, the capital city of Sierra Leone. According to legend, the \\"Cotton Tree\\" gained importance in 1792 when a group of former African American slaves, who had gained their freedom by fighting for the British during the American War of Independence, settled the site of modern Freetown. These Black Loyalist settlers, called \\"Nova Scotians\\" because they came from Nova Scotia after leaving the United States and before they decided to go back to Africa or, \\"Navatians\\" in Sierra Leone, founded Freetown on March 11th 1792. History People first landed on the shoreline and walked up to a giant tree just above the bay and held a Thanksgiving service there, gathering around the tree in a large group and praying and singing hymns to thank God for their deliverance to a free land. Its exact age is unknown, but it is known to have existed in 1787. The tree is the oldest cotton tree in Freetown, Sierra Leone. It stands near the Supreme Court building, music club building, and the National Museum. The tree has a lot of unique history. Under this tree is where the Nova Scotian settlers first prayed upon landing on the soil of Liberty and freedom, in other words to start their new lives as free people. They regard it as the symbol of their present situations during that period. Before these newly freed Africans arrived, Sierra Leone had already been inhabited. These newly arrived Africans gave the capital the name it bears today FREETOWN. Even today, Sierra Leoneans still pray and make offerings to their ancestors for peace and prosperity beneath the Cotton Tree.

Properties  With a stellar classification of G6/8 III, Upsilon¬π Hydrae is an evolved G-type giant star. It has an estimated 3.3 times the mass of the Sun and has expanded to 14.7 times the Sun's radius. The star is about 270 million years old with a projected rotational velocity of just 2.11 km/s. It is radiating 162 times the Sun's luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 5,185 K.  Substellar companion  The Okayama Planet Search team published a paper in 2005 reporting investigations on radial velocity variations observed for a set of class G giants and announcing the detection of a brown dwarf companion in orbit around Upsilon¬π Hydrae. The orbital period for this companion is roughly 4.1 years, and it has a high eccentricity of 0.57. Since the inclination of the orbit to the line-of-sight is unknown, only a lower bound on the mass can be determined. It has at least 49 times the mass of Jupiter.

It is visible to the naked eye as a faint, orange-hued star with a combined apparent visual magnitude of 4.82. The system is moving further from the Earth with a heliocentric radial velocity of +25.6 km/s. The magnitude 4.91 primary, component A, is an aging giant star with a stellar classification of K0 III. It is a red clump giant, which indicates it is on the horizontal branch and is generating energy through helium fusion at its core. The star is 1.9 billion years old with 2.17 times the mass of the Sun. It has swelled to 11 times the Sun's radius and is radiating 57.5 times the Sun's luminosity from its enlarged photosphere at an effective temperature of 4,965 K. The star is suspected to host a low-mass companion. The stellar companions to this star, designated components B and C, lie at an angular separation of from the primary, and form a binary pair with a separation of 9.20‚Ä≥ as of 2015. The brighter member of the pair, component B, is a seventh magnitude F-type main- sequence star with a class of F4 V, while its companion is an eleventh magnitude K-type main-sequence star with a class of K2 V. Substellar companion The Okayama Planet Search team published a paper in late 2008 reporting investigations into radial velocity variations observed for a set of evolved stars, showing hints of a substellar companion orbiting the primary member of the wide binary system 27 Hydrae. Its orbital period is estimated at 9.3 years, but no planet has been confirmed yet.

Records were set around the country for temperature in England, including the highest accepted temperature, at the time, of ,http://booty.org.uk/booty.weather/climate/1900_1949.htm only broken 79 years later in the 1990 heatwave, which reached . The highest ever accepted temperature is currently recorded on 25 July 2019 in Cambridge, Cambridgeshire. Weather in Northern Europe was also affected around about this time. Description The heatwave began around early July and ended two and a half months later, in mid September. By 17 July temperatures were and by 20 July there had been no rain for 20 days, meaning a drought had officially begun. In the height of the heatwave, at the end of July, temperatures were in Kings Lynn, breaking all previous records in that area. The heat wave and drought continued into August, with temperatures up to on 1 August continuing throughout the month in London. Even into September, the heat wave was still continuing, with temperatures up to in early September. The heat wave and drought only ended on 11 September when average temperatures dropped by 20 degrees Fahrenheit (6.6C) and the high pressure dominating the country receded, allowing rain over all parts of the country. Heatwave impacts The impacts of the heatwave extended over all parts and sectors of the country. The impacts began to be felt around mid July, around three weeks after the heat wave began. Because of the extreme heat, working patterns changed in Lancashire, with work beginning at dawn, around 4:30am and finishing around midday, to avoid the hottest part of the day in the quarrying industry there. Fatalities became common and newspapers such as The Times ran Deaths by heat columns as temperatures continued to rise. The heat also caused indirect deaths, by melting the asphalt on roads, causing numerous accidents. By the beginning of August, even the health of country people was being adversely effected with stifling, humid nights, meaning food spoiled very quickly and sewage spilled out. Also in August, striking became common, most notably in the Victoria and Albert Docks, where the entire workforce of 5000 people walked out, because of the intolerable heat, meaning the whole area came to a standstill. Drought impacts The extensive drought affected all parts of the country. Again, the effects were felt around mid July, when early harvests were taken in and fires began to break out, along railway tracks in Ascot and gorse around Newbury. By the end of July, the heat and lack of rain had begun to affect agriculture. There was a shortage of grass for cattle as pastures turned brown from drought. This forced farmers to raise the price of milk, to compensate for the lack of production. On 28 July trees and some rare plants had begun to wither and die with the lack of water in the soil, even in shaded areas all around the country. By August, wells, water pumps and water supplies had begun to run completely dry. This led to the stopping of activity in farming and pasture in Essex and the closing of wool mills in Bradford, each an important industry in its area. An unusual impact of the hot and dry 1911 summer was seen in the County Championship of 1911, where Warwickshire's narrow win was the only time between 1890 and 1935 where the Championship was not won by one of the \\"Big Six\\" of Yorkshire, Surrey, Kent, Lancashire, Nottinghamshire and Middlesex. The unusually hot and dry weather created extremely fast pitches that suited Warwickshire's pace bowlers Foster and Field and camouflaged their deficiencies in batting and spin bowling on wet pitchesJohn Wisden Cricketers' Almanac, Forty-Ninth Edition (1912); part II; p. 4  Sunshine  Sunshine in July 1911 broke all time records for the UK and across the south coast of England, with Eastbourne, Sussex topping 383.9 hourshttp://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/extremes/#sunshine_hours and many other south coast spots not far behind. Much of the south coast outshone many Mediterranean locations, and Eastbourne was very close to the levels of sunshine expected in Las Vegas and in the Nevada desert in the US for July. Since the average July sunshine in Eastbourne is about 255 hours, the town received about 50% more sunshine than usual.

Childs and Ralph Pruitt later departed, and were replaced by Cleveland Horne and Ernest Newsome. Career Their first single on Ric-Tic, \\"The Whole World Is a Stage,\\" was their only big hit single, peaking at number 6 on the US Billboard R&B; chart in 1967. The next release, \\"You Gave Me Something (And Everything's Alright),\\" reached number 12 that same year. Motown eventually purchased Ric-Tic, and they had another Top 20 R&B; hit with \\"I Love You Madly,\\" which came out in 1968 and was also issued on Soul. Before the Motown takeover, The Fantastic Four were the Ric-Tic label's biggest-selling act, outselling Edwin Starr in the USA. Their songs were regularly played on Detroit/Windsor's 50,000 watt powerhouse station, CKLW (The Big 8). They continued to record for Motown, releasing several singles under its Soul subsidiary label, until 1970, when they went into semi-retirement. Several years later Armen Boladian persuaded them to sign with his Westbound label. There they enjoyed renewed appeal during the disco era, with some singles that were moderately successful, among them \\"Alvin Stone (The Birth & Death of a Gangster)\\" and \\"I Got to Have Your Love.\\" Motown guitarist Dennis Coffey produced \\"B.Y.O.F. (Bring Your Own Funk)\\" in 1979, although they didn't have too much success with it. The song did become their only entry in the UK Singles Chart, peaking at #62 in February 1979. The Fantastic Four remained active and released \\"Working on a Building of Love\\" in 1990 for the UK's Motorcity label. The Fantastic Four long-time member Cleveland Horne suffered a heart attack and died on April 13, 2000. The group's original lead singer, \\"Sweet James\\" Epps (born March 30, 1947 in Detroit, Michigan) also died of a heart attack on September 11, 2000. His death effectively spelled the end of The Fantastic Four. The group's only Motown album, Best of The Fantastic Four, was released on CD by Motown in the early 1990s. It was a compilation of the group's Ric-Tic hit singles, prior to Motown's takeover of that label, and now is a highly sought-after collectors' item. In November 2013, Motown Records and Universal Music re-released the CD Best of The Fantastic Four, featuring the original tracks, which were remastered for the release. In 2015, Ace Records released The Lost Motown Album, on its Kent Soul label, including the LP that Motown had prepared for release (entitled How Sweet He Is) and other previously unheard songs. Original member Ralph Pruitt (born May 4, 1940 in Detroit, Michigan) died on June 3, 2014 of natural causes. He was 74.

The Government of Germany complies with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking, but has not implemented European Union recommendations to reduce sexual slavery. The government made substantial progress in addressing forced labor. Available statistics indicate the majority of convicted labor and sex trafficking offenders were not required to serve time in prison, raising concerns that punishments were inadequate to deter traffickers.\\"Germany\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 1\\" in 2017.  Victims  Ninety percent of identified victims of trafficking for commercial sexual exploitation came from Europe, including 28 percent from Germany, 20 percent from Romania, and 18 percent from Bulgaria. Non-European victims originated in Nigeria, other parts of Africa, Asia, Europe and the Americas. Almost one-quarter of identified trafficking victims were children. The majority of identified sex trafficking victims have been exploited in bars, brothels, and apartments ‚Äì approximately one third of identified sex trafficking victims reported that they had agreed initially to engage in prostitution. Victims of forced labor have been identified in hotels, domestic service, construction sites, and restaurants. Police estimate that gangs brought around 1,000 Chinese people to Germany over the past decade and forced them to work in restaurants under exploitative conditions. Members of ethnic minorities, such as Roma, as well as foreign unaccompanied minors who arrived in Germany, were particularly vulnerable to human trafficking.  Prosecution  Most convicted traffickers are not required to serve time in prison; however, the Government of Germany has made some progress regarding the conviction of sex and labor trafficking offenders. Germany prohibits all forms of trafficking; trafficking for commercial sexual exploitation is criminalized in Section 232 of its Penal Code, and forced labor is criminalized under Section 233. Prescribed punishments in these statutes range from six months‚Äô to 10 years‚Äô imprisonment. It is common practice for judges in Germany to suspend prison sentences of two years or less for all crimes, including trafficking. Authorities prosecuted 173 persons for sex trafficking in 2008, the last year for which statistics were available. Of those, 138 were convicted, including seven juveniles, up from 123 convictions for sex trafficking in 2007. Of the 131 adults convicted, 92 ‚Äì or 70 percent ‚Äì received either a fine or a suspended sentence. Prison sentences for the remainder ranged from two to 10 years imprisonment. Authorities prosecuted 25 persons for labor trafficking in 2008; 16 were convicted, including seven juveniles, up from eight labor trafficking convictions in 2007. Of the nine adult labor trafficking offenders, one received a sentence of between three and five years imprisonment and the remaining eight received suspended sentences or fines. Police boosted efforts against labor trafficking in 2008‚Äîmore than 1,300 police officers and customs officials took part in raids in several cities. There were no reports of trafficking-related complicity of government officials during the reporting period. The government, in partnership with NGOs, provided a range of specialized anti-trafficking training to judges, prosecutors, and police. The federal criminal police counter-trafficking office coordinated international trafficking cases and promoted partnership with other countries by offering training programs for foreign law enforcement. Protection The German government provided economical means with a value of ‚Ç¨500,000 for victim protection during the reporting period. The Federal Family Ministry used the funds to capitalize an umbrella organization representing 39 NGOs and counseling centers that provided or facilitated shelter, medical and psychological care, legal assistance, and other services for victims. The majority of these NGOs focused on adult, female victims; however, a number of NGOs, in cooperation with local governmental youth welfare services, also attended to child victims. Some of these NGOs also made their services available to male victims. The government continued to distribute formal guidelines on victim identification techniques to police, counseling centers, prosecutors and judges. According to the federal police, authorities pro- actively identified 38 percent of all victims registered by the government in 2008. Authorities registered 676 sex trafficking victims and 96 forced labor victims in 2008, down from 689 sex trafficking victims and 101 forced labor victims identified in 2007. Formal victim referral mechanisms existed in 12 out of 16 German states. The government publicly encourages victims to cooperate in anti-trafficking investigations; however, police and NGOs reported that victims were often reluctant to assist law enforcement officials due to fear of retribution from traffickers. The government provided legal alternatives to foreign victims‚Äô deportation to countries where they may face hardship or retribution. Trafficking victims were provided a 30-day reflection period to decide whether to cooperate with investigators. Victims who agreed to act as witnesses were only provided temporary residence permits for the duration of trial proceedings, and in very rare circumstances long-term residence permits, such as when the victim faced severe threats in the country of origin. The government reportedly did not penalize victims for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked. The governmental German Institute for Human Rights in July 2009 began a $800,000 project to assist trafficking victims in claiming their financial rights in German courts, as some victims had made claims for financial compensation. Prevention The government made some progress in trafficking prevention activities during the reporting period. The government sustained funding for NGOs that produced public awareness campaigns in Germany and abroad through websites, postcards, telephone hotlines, pamphlets, and speaking engagements. The government did not take measures to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts or focus public awareness on potential clients in some of Germany‚Äôs best known red light districts, such as the one in Hamburg. A Berlin NGO, funded largely by the Berlin Senate, operated a trafficking awareness website directed at clients of the sex trade. The German Federal Police published an annual report containing statistics about its anti-trafficking activities. The Labor Ministry commissioned a study in 2009 to assess the extent of and government response to labor trafficking. The Federal Family Ministry, which has the responsibility for implementing the national anti-trafficking action plan, chaired a federal-state interagency working group on female sex trafficking. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs contributed approximately $297,000 toward anti-trafficking projects in Ukraine, Moldova, and the Mekong region. The government sustained a partnership with ECPAT to promote awareness of the child sex tourism problem; there were no reports of new prosecutions for child sex tourism by German citizens abroad during the reporting period. The government provided trafficking awareness training to commanders of German military units prior to their deployment abroad on international peacekeeping missions; the training focused on how the commanders could sensitize subordinates to human trafficking.

The jail was located on the grounds of the current Oconee County Courthouse. It was named to the National Register of Historic Places on November 14, 1982 along with the Oconee County Cage. At the time of its listing, the jail was one of the few remaining nineteenth or twentieth century jails in upper northwestern South Carolina. It was demolished around 1985. Subsequently, it was delisted on December 12, 1989. Early 20th-century county penal system In the early twentieth century, county jails were primarily for holding individuals who were awaiting trial that could not afford bail. Male convicted prisoners were either sentenced to hard labor on the county chain gang or sent to the state penitentiary. In 1916, about 94% were in county chain gangs and about 6% were at the state penitentiary. In this period of racial segregation, white prisoners were separated from African-American prisoners. Instead of being housed in the county jail, chain gangs were housed in cages, cars, or tents near the work site. The cages and cars could be used to also transport the convicts. History Oconee County was formed in 1868 and Walhalla was made its county seat. In the next year, a contract was given to build a wooden jail. In 1901, the South Carolina General Assembly loaned Oconee County USD $12,000 to construct a new jail and for repairs and remodeling of the county courthouse. A new location for the jail was chosen behind Main Street between Church and Tugaloo Streets. It was completed by at least 1906. It was used by the county sheriff and as a jail until 1978. A report from a 1915 visit by the Board of Charities and Correction indicated that the average number of prisoners was 3.7. The white male prisoners were kept in a large room. African-American prisoners were kept in four cells. There was one room for female prisoners, but it was rarely occupied. Oconee County was one of the few in South Carolina that served three meals each day. The prisoners did practically no labor. Architecture The jail was a two-story, stuccoed brick building with an asymmetrical plan. The building has been described as neomedieval or Gothic Revival style. The jail was very similar to one built in Anderson County that was designed by Frank P. Milburn. The front section contains the sheriff's office and residence. It has a hip roof and three ells. The facade, which faces southwest, has a gabled ell on the left with a stepped parapet. This forward ell had a pair of one over one light windows at each level, and there was a multi-light attic window below the parapet. There was a one-story porch that extended across the front and around the left ell. This had a metal roof supported by grouped wooden columns. There was a wing toward the right terminating in a polygonal bay with a crenellated parapet. There was a tall, stuccoed brick chimney at the junction of the main block and the bay. The bay had a one over one light window on each facet. On the right elevation, there was a one-story porch with an auxiliary entrance. Above this porch, there were three one over one lights. On the left elevation, there were three bays with a tall, stuccoed brick chimney between the second and third bay. There was a one-story porch along the left elevation that abutted another projecting, gabled ell. The end of this ell had two one over one lights on each story and a multi-light window below a stepped parapet. The interior of the building had an L-shaped hallway that led to the right and left elevations. There were four main rooms that had wooden floors, plaster walls and ceilings, and wooden window and door surrounds ornamented with routings. The detention wing, added in 1939-1939 to replace the original detention wing, was a poured concrete building with a stucco finish. This had a flat roof with unadorned parapet. Metal-barred windows lit the corridors. There was a steel door that connected the main building with the detention wing. The first floor of the detention facility has single and double cells on either side of a hallway. The second level had a large caged, bunk room with a shower and dining area. Pictures of the jail are available.

It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index. History Carl Spaeter RHI Magnesita Headquarters, Vienna RHI Magnesita Technology Center, Leoben In 1908 Mining engineer Josef H√∂rhager discovered a magnesite deposit at Millst√§tter Alpe in Austria. A German American, Emil Winter, acquired the mining rights and founded the \\"Austro-American Magnesite Company\\" (later Radex Austria). In 1974 the company was bought by National Refractories Co. and in 1987 Radex- Heraklith Industriebeteiligungs AG ('RHI AG') emerged from the National Refractories Co. as a result of a management buyout. Then in 1991 RHI AG acquired Veitscher Magnesitwerke Actien-Gesellschaft, a rival business founded by Carl Spaeter in Germany in 1889. Next, in 1995, RHI AG acquired a majority stake in its previous competitor Didier-Werke AG (founded by Friedrich Ferdinand Didier in 1834 when he acquired a brick and lime firing plant near Szczecin in Poland, and established the factory \\"Chamottefabrik F. Didier\\" in Podjuchy, thus becoming one of the first manufacturers of refractory bricks in Germany). RHI AG acquired Global Industrial Technologies (GIT) in 2000. GIT had a subsidiary, APG (formerly A.P. Green Refractories Company), which has been named as defendant in hundreds of thousands of asbestos-related injury litigation cases. GIT entered bankruptcy under Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code in February 2002. RHI AG sold its North American subsidiaries, including GIT, later in the year. In 2004 the company was required to pay a civil penalty of $650,000 for failing to undertake asbestos remediation at a plant in Marelan, Quebec, Canada which it had been ordered to sell to Resco Products, Inc. in 1999. The company completed the takeover of Stopinc AG (Switzerland) in 2012 and bought a majority acquisition of Orient Refractories in India in 2013. In October 2017 RHI AG merged with Magnesita, a Brazilian competitor, and then abandoned its listing on the Vienna Stock Exchange and instead secured a listing on the London Stock Exchange as RHI Magnesita. Additionally, the RHI Magnesita shares can still be traded via the global market segment of the Vienna Stock Exchange. Operations The company produces roughly 3 million tons of refractory products each year at 35 main production and 10 main raw material sites around the world.

At the 2006 census, its population was 5,733, in 1,790 families. Located in the vicinity of the arterial road of Tehran-Esfahan, it is now classified by the relevant council as a town. Meymeh was once the site of the governor's residence in the Qajar dynasty-era province of Joshekan (now a part of Isfahan Province).  Geography  Meymeh is located on a high plain in the western foothills of the Kargas mountains, which separate Meymeh from Natanz to the east. To the west lies a wasteland, at the other end of which is Khvansar County. Clustered around Meymeh are the town of Vazvan and the villages of Ziadabad, Azan, Vandadeh, and Khosrowabad. To the northeast are Robat-e Aqa Kamal and Chaqadeh. To the northwest, the outlying village of Muteh stands isolated on a rural road leading to Golpayegan.  History  Meymeh's significance has largely derived from its position on the route between Isfahan and Tehran. The earliest evidence of the trade routes passing through Meymeh is the presence of two Seljuk-era rebats in the area. One is in Meymeh itself, near a later Mongol-era mosque. The other, now known as Rebat-e Tork, lies further north on the road to Delijan. Originally built as a military outpost, Rebat-e Tork was later converted into a caravanserai. Textual sources from this time make no mention of Meymeh, but they do appear to mention the nearby town of Vazvan. The 10th-century writer Ibn Khordadbeh described \\"RebƒÅ·π≠-e Vazz\\" as the station after Borkhvar on the road from Isfahan to Ray (then the main city in the Tehran area). The name \\"Vazz\\" is an apparent reference to Vazvan, indicating that it was originally the main town in the area. Meymeh itself is first mentioned by Yaqut al-Hamawi, several centuries later, who describes Meymeh as a wilayat of Isfahan. However, Hamdallah Mustawfi, the main authority on Iranian geography in the following 14th century, makes no mention of Meymeh. By the Safavid era, the main trade route from Isfahan to Tehran had shifted away from Meymeh, now passing through the towns of Natanz, Qohrud, and Kashan in the Kargas mountains. This remained the preferred route through the time of the Qajar dynasty. Meymeh's modern importance came after the automobile gained popularity in Iran, replacing the camel caravans of earlier times. The arrival of the automobile caused the preferred route to shift from the mountains to the plains of Meymeh and Delijan.  Meymeh in the 1930s  The ethnographic writings of Ann Lambton, in 1936-37, provide a snapshot of life in Meymeh and Jowsheqan during the 1930s, when traditional small-town life was just beginning to be affected by the sweeping reforms of Reza Shah Pahlavi. Most people in Meymeh were peasants who owned their own land. The town's agricultural area was divided into 2,016 habbas, with the average holding being 2-5 habbas, although there was one large landowner who owned a large portion of the habbas, along with several thousand sheep and goats. Meymeh also had a carpenter, a blacksmith, a potter, a builder, a brickmaker, a couple of shopkeepers, and two sellers of clothing. There were two public baths and two mosques. Also at this time, Meymeh was the seat of the deputy governor of the district of Meymeh and Jowsheqan. The deputy governor's main responsibility was to preside over the solhiya court that met in Meymeh and was mostly concerned with financial disputes. Traditional education by the mullahs had already been abolished and replaced with secular, state-run schools. Meymeh and Jowsheqan each had a school, and the two of them together were overseen by a ra æis-e ma øƒÅref, or \\"head of [the department of] education\\". Each town also had a kadkhoda, or \\"head of the village\\", appointed by the governor of Kashan based on the recommendations of the locals. The kadkhoda's responsibilities were mainly concerned with agriculture, especially cleaning the qanats. By this time, however, use of the qanats in Meymeh had declined -- of its ten qanats in Meymeh, only two (the Bir and the Mordabad) were still in use. The kadkhoda had three subordinates, or pakars, and there was also a mirab in charge of water distribution. Despite the decline of the qanats, Meymeh remained a prosperous town. There was little to no emigration to the growing metropolis of Tehran, especially in contrast to neighboring districts. Meymeh enjoyed a fairly constant water supply and good farmland. It also had vineyards. Surplus crops were stored in an old fort in the town. An important tradition connecting Meymeh with Kashan was the festival of Esbandi, which Lambton observed during her time here, although celebration of Esbandi declined dramatically in the following decades and was moribund by the end of the 1960s.  Administrative history  During the late Qajar period, Meymeh was part of the district of Jowsheqan. Under the Pahlavi dynasty, in 1921-22, Meymeh was put in Jowsheqan boluk of Kashan shahrestan. By 1950, the boluk had been made a dehestan, and by 1954 it was raised to a bakhsh, now named Meymeh. Then, in 1957, the bakhsh of Meymeh was transferred from Kashan to Isfahan County, which upset the residents of Jowsheqan who had traditionally identified with Kashan more. Thus, the bakhsh was split in two, with Meymeh going into Isfahan and Jowsheqan into Kashan. In 1990, the county of Borkhvar and Meymeh was formed by merging those two districts. The capital of the new county was the new city of Shahin Shahr. Under this new arrangement, Meymeh remained a bakhsh with two rural districts, Zarkan and Vandada. Despite all these changes, the borders of the town of Meymeh itself have remained essentially unchanged since at least the original Pahlavi setup.  Economy  The economy of Meymeh is primarily rural and agricultural. Irrigation comes from a seasonal river as well as from qanats, although the use of qanats had declined by the 1930s. Major crops at this time included cereals, beans, cotton, fruits, and vegetables. Cultivation of opium was forbidden in 1937. Surplus crops were stored in an old fort. A unique feature of the Meymeh region is the presence of bumkands, which are manmade caverns used to shelter livestock during the harshest part of winter. Meymeh has historically been known for its dried fruit, sold in Isfahan and Kashan. They are either sold plain or in jowzeqand form, where the dried fruit skin is stuffed with sugar. Modern Meymeh also derives economic significance from its position on the Tehran-Isfahan highway. Much of modern Meymeh's service economy is dedicated to stores and restaurants along the main highway.

The underground city The underground city of Ouyi (Noushabad), located 5km north of Kashan, Isfahan province, is considered a notable piece of ancient architecture. As Noushabad city is located in the central desert region of Iran, it experiences harsh weather. During the day, Noushabad has a very hot temperature and during the nights it gets notably cold. The reason why this city is called Noushabad (meaning the 'city of cold tasty water') is because in ancient times, one of the Sassanian kings who were passing through this area stopped here to drink water from a well and he found this water extremely clear and cold. Therefore he ordered the building of a city around this well and named it Anoushabad, which eventually turned into Noushabad. One reason for this underground city being built is thought to be to offer an escape from the high daytime temperature of the region. However the main reason that the underground city of Noushabad was carved stemmed from the fact that in the past, this region was insecure, suffering from raids, and by forming an underground chain of passages beneath the entire city, the inhabitants could shelter there during such attacks. Through these passages they could reach any spot in the city without being seen. The depth of this underground city varies from 4 to 18 meters. To reach the underground city there were several different openings. Some of these openings were located inside the houses of people and others were located in important gathering places, such as the main fort just outside the city. People could live in the underground passages for several days without the need of to go outside. There are three levels in this underground city, planned in such a way that going to the different levels required moving from down to up. This made it easier for the people sheltering in the underground city to prevent enemies from getting to the upper levels. Another interesting feature of their architecture was the curvy passages that made it possible for the inhabitants to ambush enemies. Furthermore there were several other tricks that were used to resist against the enemies, for instance digging deep holes in the middle of the rooms and covering them with rotating stones that would fall down if anyone stepped on them. http://www.civiltect.com Gallery Image:Ancient Jameh Mosque of 'Noosh Abad' (Masjed Jameh), Work of art or art works ŸÖÿ≥ÿ¨ÿØ ÿ¨ÿßŸÖÿπ ÿπÿ™€åŸÇ ŸÜŸàÿ¥ ÿ¢ÿ®ÿßÿØ - panoramio.jpg Image:Menar.jpg References Category:Populated places in Aran va Bidgol County Category:Cities in Isfahan Province Category:Underground cities ","title":"Nushabad"},{"id":"25008891","text":"Rozveh (, also Romanized as Rozweh; also known as Rozba and R≈´zƒ´yeh) is a city in the Central District of Chadegan County, in western Isfahan Province, Iran.

The series won a silver Parents' Choice Award for its positive storylines and characters. The series premiered on 26 January 2009 on Nickelodeon and aired episodes through 29 October 2015. 40 episodes were produced. Plot Taking place in a world where all people are pigs, Olivia revolves around the title character and her family. The plots are mostly everyday situations in which Olivia finds herself and her unique way of dealing with them. In almost every episode from season 1, Olivia also dispenses her \\"Rules of Life\\". In each episode, Olivia dreams of having a job from the episode's experiences, such as being an artist after visiting the art gallery or being her mom's assistant after helping plan her friend's birthday party. Episodes Characters * Olivia Watson (voiced by Emily Gray), is a young pig and the main character of the show. She is imaginative and fantasizes about different roles, such as a pop star or superhero. She displays good behavior and shows kids how to share, use their imaginations, be physically active, and be self-confident. She is in 1st grade.Official page at Nick Jr. Olivia's family * Ian Watson (voiced by Michael Van Citters) is Olivia's younger brother. He looks up to Olivia and enjoys being included in her activities, but often becomes the typical annoying \\"little bother\\". He likes, among other things, dinosaurs, robots and baseball. In Season 2, he becomes less annoying, is more intelligent, on better terms with his sister, has a small planet on his T-shirt and a deeper voice.Meet the Characters of Olivia at Nick Jr. * William Watson (voiced by Robert Toonitititusa) is Olivia and Ian's baby brother and typically sleeps, eats, and cries. * Mom, Olivia's mother (voiced by Joyce Beverley), who runs her own party-planning business from home. * Dad, Olivia's father (voiced by Danny Katiana) is an architect and occasionally absent-minded.

It is rarely seen. * Cedric, a one- time frog that Ian found and named after his Grandpa. Friends * Julian (voiced by Jeremy Herzig) is Olivia's male best friend. He's smart with a self-deprecating sense of humor, but shy and lets Olivia take the lead. While often reluctant to go along with Olivia's ideas, he finally always does. * Francine (voiced by Brianna McCracken (Season 1) and Josie Baker (Season 2)) is Olivia's friend. In the first season, she can be snobby, villainous, tries to make Olivia feel jealous at times, and often serves as the antagonist. She acts more \\"girly\\" than Olivia and will not touch anything gross. Her birthday is eight months after Olivia's. In Season 2, Francine gets better and friendly to Olivia and her classmates. * Gwendolyn is Francine's yellowish orange tabby. She is very talented and likes Edwin. In one episode, Francine reveals that she sometimes dresses her in Barbie Fashions to have a tea party and makes Gwendolyn fish sticks. * Herman is Francine's dog. He makes his only appearance in \\"Olivia Trains Her Cat\\". He can ride a skateboard and also knows tricks like Gwendolyn. School * Mrs. Hoggenmueller (voiced by Susan Balboni), Olivia's teacher, is a dedicated educator, if a bit eccentric.

Olivia 2 was never seen in the episodes after it, presuming that her family moved out after a short time. * Sophie, a girl who wears a yellow T-shirt and thin light purple jumper. In Season 1, she had no name, but in \\"Olivia's Tip- Top Tapper\\", the girl's name was revealed as Sophie. She and Sam cannot speak. * Caitlin, who wears a blue shirt with white polka-dots. He is rarely spoken like Sam and Sophie. Shorts The shorts are small, generally wordless segments in each episode (two per). They include the following: William Eats (And Burps) * William is hungry so Mom puts him in his highchair and goes to get him some applesauce. While she is gone, everyone else gives him tidbits of food. At the end, Mom says she thought he was hungry, but it appears William does not want his applesauce. She is surprised when he burps. Olivia in the Bathroom * While Dad is shaving, Olivia keeps taking her stool, getting up on it and doing something in front of the sink and mirror such as brushing her ears. At the end of the short she gets on her stool and kisses Dad. Olivia and Her Toy * Olivia tries to get her favorite doll to stand up straight, but it won't so she tapes it to the wall and the two have a tea party. Olivia Scares Ian * Olivia tries to scare her little 'bother' but she can't time it right. Later Ian scares her. Olivia Builds a Tower * Olivia is building a tower of random items. Ian, Perry, and William try to knock it down, but Mom and Dad forbid it. At the end Olivia purposely knocks it down. Olivia Cheers Up William * There are two versions of this short. In one (used during the first season), William is upset and Olivia tries to cheer him up. At the end (when Olivia is in her cow costume), she hurts her leg by stepping on a block and cheers him up. The other (used during the second) is similar, except with Olivia laying Edwin beside William instead of hurting her foot. Olivia's Bookbag * Olivia is stuffing her bookbag for school with Perry and Ian taking her things then returning them each time she leaves the room. In the end, her bookbag becomes too heavy for her to carry and when she puts it on she falls over backwards. William Goes for a Ride * Olivia puts on her train hat takes her family on a ride in her wagon. First it's just William, who is then joined by Perry, then Edwin, and finally Ian. The wagon gets heavier as each kid and pet climbs on board. At the end all the kids and pets are pulled in the wagon by Dad. Ian Wants to Play * Olivia and Julian are jumping rope and Ian wants to play, also. Throughout the entire short Ian is trying to get their attention but he is unsuccessful. Finally at the end he gets their attention and Olivia and Ian jump rope. Olivia's Hidden Talent * When Olivia sees a bowl of oranges she discovers she has a hidden talent for juggling. When she throws four oranges in the air they disappear. When she looks up, she realizes Ian who is standing on the stairs above her has caught them. Olivia Slides * Olivia and her toys slide many different ways in the park. Perry Plays Fetch * Olivia throws three different balls to Perry. The first two, a baseball and a soccer ball, he retrieves. The last, a beachball, he returns walking on. Olivia then throws a smaller baseball and he walks on the beachball to fetch the baseball.

After a couple of sandwiches Ian covers Olivia's favorite toy in peanut butter and at the end the toy falls to the floor and Perry licks it as Olivia chases Ian. Olivia's Picture * Olivia paints a picture of a pig with a blue background. The short ends showing the fridge filled with many copies of the same picture and Olivia replies \\"I think I'm done with my blue period,\\" a reference to Pablo Picasso's blue period. Edwin's Surprise * Olivia is trying to draw a picture, but Edwin keeps laying on top of the picture resulting in Olivia moving him again and again. At the end the viewers see that the picture is of Edwin. Olivia's Metamorphosis * Olivia is about to go outside but Mom warns her it is about to get very cold. When Olivia opens the front door she imagines emperor penguins and snow. William flies away but Dad catches him. Olivia goes to her room and dresses for winter, but when she goes to the door again, it is hot outside. Olivia dresses like it is summer and Mom asks her why she keeps changing clothes. Olivia says it is the weather that's changing. Olivia's Sculpture * At the beach, Olivia finds a pile of sand and decides to make a sand sculpture of herself by shaping it and adding shells.

Molydopterin is subsequently complexed with molybdenum to form molybdenum cofactor (MoCo). MPT synthase catalyses the following chemical reaction: :precursor Z + 2 [molybdopterin-synthase sulfur-carrier protein]-Gly-NH-CH2-C(O)SH + H2O \\\\rightleftharpoons molybdopterin + 2 molybdopterin-synthase sulfur-carrier protein Molybdopterin synthase is heterodimeric and coded for by the MOCS2 gene. Genetic deficiencies of enzymes such as MPT synthase, which are involved in MoCo biosynthesis, lead to MoCo deficiency, a rare disease that results in severe neurological abnormalities.  Structure  Human MPT Synthase crystal structure. Small subunits are shown in cyan and green, with their C-terminus colored orange. Large subunits are shown in yellow and magenta. The high resolution crystal structure of MPT synthase shows the enzyme has a heterotetrametric structure composed of two small subunits (MoaD in prokaryotes) and two large subunits (MoaE in prokaryotes) with the small subunits at opposite ends of a central large subunit dimer. The C-terminus of each small subunit is inserted into a large subunit to form the active site. In the enzyme's activated form the C-terminus is present as a thiocarboxylate, which acts as the sulfur donor to precursor Z in MoCo biosynthesis. As a result, the active site of the enzyme must be in close proximity to the C-terminus of the small subunit (i.e. MoaD in prokaryotes). The high resolution crystal structure of the enzyme also reveals the presence of a binding pocket for the terminal phosphate of molybdopterin and suggests a possible binding site for the pterin moiety present both in precursor Z and molybdopterin. The structural similarity between ubiquitin and the small subunit of MPT synthase hints at the evolutionary relationship of the MoCo biosynthesis pathway and the ubiquitin dependent protein degradation pathway. Specifically, the small subunit MoaD in prokaryotes is a sequence homolog of Urm1, indicating that MPT synthase probably shares a common ancestor with ubiquitin.  Mechanism  Prokaryote MPT Synthase Reaction Mechanism The biosynthesis of MoCo is an old and evolutionary conserved pathway present in eukaryotes, eubacteria, and archea, which can be divided into three major steps. The first step involves the conversion of a guanosine nucleotide into precursor Z. In the following step, MPT synthase catalyzes the incorporation of the dithiolene moiety to precursor Z, which converts it to molybdopterin. More specifically, this interconversion involves the opening of the cyclic phosphate ring of precursor Z, and the addition of two side chain sulfhydryl groups. E-coli MPT synthase is activated by the formation of a thiocarboxylate group at the second glycine of its C-terminal Gly-Gly motif, which serves as the sulfur donor for the formation of the diothiolene group in MPT. That is, the mechanism on MPT synthase depends on the interconversion between the activated form of MoaD with the thiocarboxylate group and the MoaE protein In the final step of MoCo biosynthesis, molybendum is incorporated to MPT by the two-domain protein gephyrin. MPT synthase sulfurylase recharges MPT synthase with a sulfur atom after each catalytic cycle.  Biological function  MPT synthase is involved in the biosynthesis of MoCo, which is essential for the activity of enzymes like xanthine dehydrogenase, aldehyde oxidase, and sulfite oxidase in humans. MoCo containing enzymes typically catalyze the net transfer of an oxygen atom to and from their substrates in a two electron redox reaction.  Disease relevance  MoCo deficiency in humans results in the combined deficiency of the MoCo-containing enzymes: sulfite oxidase, xanthine oxidase, and aldehyde oxidase. Symptoms of MoCo deficiency are linked to the accumulation of toxic metabolites caused by the reduced activity of these molybdoenzymes, especially sulfite oxidase. Genetic defects in MoCo biosynthesis lead to MoCo deficiency. These genetic defects affect the formation of precursor Z (known as group A MoCo deficiency) or the conversion of precursor Z to MoCo by MPT synthase (known as group B MoCo deficiency). MOCS1 is defective for group A (the majority of patients), and encodes two enzymes involved in the formation of precursor Z. MOCS2 is defective for group B and encodes the small and large subunits of MPT synthase . Groups A and B of deficiency show an identical phenotype, characterized by neonatal seizures, attenuated brain growth, dislocated ocular lenses, feeding difficulties, among other neurological symptoms. This rare but severe deficiency is an autosomal recessive trait, which usually results in early childhood death as there is currently no available treatment.

Sieber lies at a height of 340 m above sea level and has about 600 inhabitants (1 October 2006). The settlement is spread out over a length of several kilometres in a narrow valley, running from east to west, through which the river of the same name flows. A tributary of the Sieber, the Goldenke, joins it in the village. Sieber has a Protestant church, St. Benedict, in which concerts also take place.  History  Sieber was a home to the mining industry, but also to ancillary industries such as grinding shops. Furthermore, forestry had been an important employer for several centuries. Until the mid-1980s plans were pursued to impound and use the water of the Sieber with one or more dams. Some plans envisaged the flooding of the entire village, with the population being rehoused in the Ilme valley. The relocated spa was promised the \\"best opportunities to get off the ground\\". Other plans foresaw a high dam immediately above the village. The latest plans by the Harzwasserwerke, the so-called \\"multi-stage solution\\" consisted of two smaller barriers in the upper reaches of the Sieber valley and in the Kulmke to transfer water into the S√∂se, and the construction of a \\"Lower Sieber Dam\\" between Sieber and Herzberg. In the end strong opposition from the population of the entire South Harz region ensured that these plans were stopped. Today, the Sieber is the largest unregulated river in the Harz. Flock of sheep in the Sieber valley  Walking and recreation  Today the idyllic valley is a particular magnet for walkers, hikers, Nordic walkers and cyclists. Walkers especially can enjoy the Panorama Way along the southern side of the valley on a sunny day (the first two photographs are taken from this path). An easier path runs west of the valley into neighbouring Paradies. Longer and more difficult hiking trails lead to Hansk√ºhnenburg, the Gro√üer Knollen and Sankt Andreasberg. There is a large adventure playground for children. Sieber also has a heated swimming pool and an pleasant spa park. In summer, in the surrounding meadows one can often see a few herds of sheep.

It was first proposed in 2006, and explained in more detail in a peer-reviewed paper presented at a 2007 system sciences conference.Gomez, Elizabeth, Plotnick, Linda , Rohn, Eli, Morgan, John, and Turoff, Murray (2007). Towards a Unified Public Safety Scale, Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS), Waikoloa, Hawaii. The idea was further refined later that year. The need for such a scale was ratified in two later independent publications.Turoff Murray and Hiltz Roxanne (2008). Assessing the health information needs of the emergency preparedness and management community. Inf. Serv. Use 28, 3‚Äì4 (Aug. 2008), 269‚Äì280.Turoff, M., White, C., Plotnick, L., and Hiltz, S. R., Dynamic Emergency Response Management for Large Scale Decision Making in Extreme Events, Proceedings of ISCRAM 2008, Washington D.C. May. It is the first scale that quantifies any emergency based on a mathematical model. The scale can be tailored for use at any geographic level ‚Äì city, county, state or continent. It can be used to monitor the development of an ongoing emergency event, as well as forecast the probability and nature of a potential developing emergency and in the planning and execution of a National Response Plan.  Existing emergency-related scales  Scales relating to natural phenomena that may result in an emergency are numerous. This section provides a review of several notable emergency related scales. They concentrate mainly on weather and environmental scales that provide a common understanding and lexicon with which to understand the level of intensity and impact of a crisis. Some scales are used before and/or during a crisis to predict the potential intensity and impact of an event and provide an understanding that is useful for preventative and recovery measures. Other scales are used for post-event classification. Most of these scales are descriptive rather than quantitative, which makes them subjective and ambiguous. : 1805 Beaufort scale : 1931 Modified Mercalli intensity scale : 1935 Richter magnitude scale (superseded by the Moment magnitude scale) : 1969 Saffir‚ÄìSimpson scale : 1971 Fujita scale (superseded by Enhanced Fujita scale in 2007) : 1982 Volcanic explosivity index : 1990 International Nuclear Event ScaleIAEA fact sheet : 1999 Air quality index  Variables common to all emergencies  According to the Rohn emergency scale, all emergencies can be described by three independent dimensions: (a) scope; (b) topographical change (or lack thereof); and (c) speed of change. The intersection of the three dimensions provides a detailed scale for defining any emergency, as depicted on the Emergency Scale Website.  Scope  The scope of an emergency in the Rohn scale is represented as a continuous variable with a lower limit of zero and a theoretical calculable upper limit. The Rohn Emergency Scale use two parameters that form the scope: percent of affected humans out of the entire population, and damages, or loss, as a percentage of a given gross national product (GNP). Where applied to a specific locality, this parameter may be represented by a gross state product, gross regional product, or any similar measure of economic activity appropriate to the entity under emergency.  Topography  A topographical change means a measurable and noticeable change in land characteristics, in terms of elevation, slope, orientation, and land coverage. These could be either natural (e.g., trees) or artificial (e.g., houses). Non-topographical emergencies are situations where the emergency is non-physical in nature. The collapse of the New York stock market in 1929 is such an example, and the global liquidity crisis of August 2007 is another example. The model treats topographical change as a continuum ranging between 0 and 1 that gives the estimated visual fractional change in the environment.  Speed of change  An emergency is typified by a departure from normal state of affairs. The scale uses the change of the number of victims over time and economical losses over time to calculate a rate of change that is of utmost importance to society (e.g., life and a proxy for quality of life).  Emergency scale mathematical model  The scale is a normalized function whose variables are scope (S), topography (T), and rate of change (D), expressed as :E = Emergency = f(S,T,D). These parameters are defined as follows:  Scope  :\\\\hbox{Scope}=\\\\tfrac{\\\\hbox{RawScope}}{\\\\hbox{MaxScope}} :where :\\\\hbox{RawScope}=\\\\left(\\\\tfrac{\\\\hbox{Victims}}{\\\\hbox{Population}} + \\\\tfrac{\\\\hbox{Monetary Losses}}{\\\\hbox{GNP}}\\\\right)^W :where :W=\\\\left( \\\\tfrac{\\\\ln(\\\\hbox{Victims})}{\\\\ln(\\\\hbox{Monetary Losses})} \\\\right)^\\\\beta :Œ≤ is a coefficient which the model creator calculated to be 1.26 ¬± 0.03, :and :\\\\hbox{MaxScope}=\\\\left(\\\\tfrac{0.7*\\\\hbox{Population}}{\\\\hbox{Population}} + \\\\tfrac{0.5*\\\\hbox{GNP}}{\\\\hbox{GNP}}\\\\right)^V, :where :V= \\\\tfrac{\\\\ln(\\\\hbox{Victims})}{\\\\ln(\\\\hbox{Monetary Losses})} The model loosely assumes that a society whose majority of the population (70% in this model) is affected and half of its GNP is drained as a result of a calamity reaches a breaking point of disintegration. Sociologists and economists may come up with a better estimate.  Topographical change  :\\\\tfrac{\\\\hbox{Volume before the event}}{\\\\hbox{Volume after the event}} or zero for non-topographical events.  Rate of change  :\\\\tfrac {d(\\\\hbox{Victims})}{d(\\\\hbox{Time})} and \\\\tfrac {d(\\\\hbox{Losses})}{d(\\\\hbox{Time})} comprise the rate of change that is of utmost importance to society and therefore incorporated in the model.  Simplified scale for public communications  In some instances, it may be preferable to have an integral scale to more simply and dramatically convey the extent of an emergency, with a range, say, from 1 to 10, and 10 representing the direst emergency. This can be obtained from the function above in any number of ways. One of them is the ceiling function. Another one is a single number representing the volume under the 3D emergency scale.

The award was established in 2003 to 2004 to recognise the exceptional contributions the recipient has made to improving care and outcomes for patients, providing excellent care in the face of adversity or other challenges, or for an outstanding act of kindness, understanding, compassion or courage, above and beyond the normal role as a nurse anywhere in Australia. A judging panel of nationally recognised nursing experts assesses the top individual nominees and selects a nurse from each of Australia's states and territories. Each state or territory finalist is flown to a state capital (the place of ceremony is changed each year), where the winner is announced at a formal ceremony. In recent years, other categories of awards have been added. These are for an Outstanding Graduate and another is for Team Innovation. Although the award is not associated with the Australian government-run Australian of the Year awards, it has been sponsored by various organisations and companies each year, including the Australian Department of Health and Ageing, The College of Nursing (Australia), Elsevier Medical Publications, the Australian Nursing Federation, Nursing Review, Laerdal, ME Bank and other businesses. From their inception in 2004 the awards were hosted by Healthstaff Recruitment, and since 2007 by HESTA.

It serves as a base for the exploration of the Gamma Quadrant via the Bajoran wormhole and is a hub of trade and travel for the sector's denizens. It is run by a joint crew of Starfleet and Bajoran officers and it is the home port of a number of Starfleet runabouts, as well as the starship USS Defiant. The station is featured in the opening for all 176 episodes of Deep Space Nine, as well as part one of the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode \\"Birthright\\" and the first Star Trek: Voyager episode \\"Caretaker\\". Many story arcs introduced on Next Generation are extended by events that occur on the station. The station builds on the legacy of the Cardassian-Federation interactions introduced by that show and the first episode, \\"Emissary\\", includes a visit from the Enterprise-D. Deep Space Nine provides the location for the crew to interact with the characters and elements established by the Star Trek universe, and introduces additional elements. The station exists in a time and place also occupied by The Next Generation and Voyager and the seventh through tenth films, the 2370s in Earth's Galaxy. This is itself part of the bigger Star Trek universe, which was initiated by the original Star Trek TV show of the late 1960s created by Gene Roddenberry. Description Deep Space Nine, over a kilometer in diameter, is composed of a broad outer docking ring; an inner habitat ring containing residential apartments; and a central core containing the promenade, the fusion reactors, and the operations center, known as \\"Ops\\". Three sets of docking pylons sweep up and down equidistantly around the docking ring, defining an almost spherical shape. It is of identical design to another Cardassian station, Empok Nor. Originally situated in orbit of Bajor, the station was moved in the series' pilot episode to a position at the mouth of the newly discovered wormhole, where it would remain throughout the remainder of the series. This made the station three hours away from Bajor by shuttle, as described in three episodes,\\"Looking for par'Mach in all the Wrong Places\\", Star Trek: Deep Space Nine; Season 5.\\"The Begotten\\" although it was mentioned as being five hours away in another episode,\\"The Alternate\\" Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. Season 2, Episode 12. (presumably as Bajor was in far orbit of its sun relative to DS9's position). However, it would appear that the journey could be completed in a much shorter length of time if necessary by engaging warp drive within the Bajoran star system. Facilities The promenade is the main public thoroughfare in which visitors and residents congregate. Common locations on the promenade depicted or mentioned in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine include Quark's Bar (the crew's most frequently seen off-hours location, which also includes holosuites), the infirmary, the replimat (a self-service replicator eatery), a Bajoran temple, Elim Garak's clothing shop, chief of security Odo's office, a Klingon restaurant, a mineral assay office, a candy kiosk, and, for a brief time during the first season, Keiko O'Brien's classroom. There are normally about 300 permanent residents of the station, though the station can accommodate up to seven thousand. Station history In the Star Trek universe, Deep Space Nine was originally a Cardassian mining and refinery station named Terok Nor in orbit around Bajor, and it was built by Bajoran slave labor under Cardassian rule in 2346.Episode \\"Wrongs Darker Than Death or Night\\" The station was commanded by Gul Dukat, the last Cardassian prefect of Bajor. It was abandoned toward the end of the Cardassian occupation of Bajor in 2369; the Cardassians stripped items of value on their way out. The station had some major problems, including a trap left by the Bajoran resistance that nearly killed everyone on the station when it was accidentally activated by the new tenants. In 2369, the Bajorans assumed control of the station. The Bajoran provisional government requested the assistance of the United Federation of Planets, who renamed it Deep Space Nine (DS9) and placed Commander Benjamin Sisko in command. Despite the Federation presence, the station remains subject to Bajoran law. Shortly after Sisko assumed command, his crew discovered the Bajoran wormhole. The station was moved to the mouth of the wormhole to secure Bajor's claim to it, after which the station assumed great commercial, scientific and strategic importance. After the encounter with the Dominion in 2370, in which the Galaxy-class USS Odyssey was destroyed by just three Dominion vessels and owing to other threats, it became obvious that the station's existing occupation-era weapons would be woefully inadequate defending the station. The station's weapons and defensive systems were later heavily upgraded. The upgrades included the installation of multiple rotary torpedo launchers on the docking pylons and weapons sail towers, stowable phaser banks that retract when not in use and improved shields that extend 300 meters around the station. The total torpedo inventory was increased to 5,000.Episode \\"The Jem'Hadar\\"Episode \\"The Way of the Warrior\\" These upgrades were first used against the Klingons in their offensive against Cardassia in early 2372. At the beginning of the Dominion War in late 2373, the station was temporarily lost to the Dominion.Episode \\"Call to Arms\\" In early 2374, Federation and Klingon forces retook it after the Battle of Bajor.Episode \\"Sacrifice of Angels\\" Aside from a failed Bajoran military coup, the Dominion's occupation, and a brief leave of absence from late 2374 to early 2375, Sisko, promoted to captain in 2371, remained in command of Deep Space Nine. In late 2375, at the end of the Dominion War, Colonel Kira Nerys assumed command.Episode \\"What You Leave Behind\\" Relaunch novels In the continuing story novels, DS9 was forced to jettison its power core due to the actions of Dominion rebels. As one of his first actions as chief of operations of the station, Nog had Empok Nor towed to the station's location, and used its power core as a replacement. The remainder of Empok Nor was broken down for scrap and spare parts. Later, DS9 would host Bajor's formal acceptance into the Federation. With the station now under Federation law, Quark almost closed down his bar, but remained open after Rom arranged to have it designated as the Ferengi embassy to Bajor, placing it under the jurisdiction of Ferenginar.Star Trek: Deep Space Nine relaunch In the year 2383, DS9‚Äîwhile under the command of Captain Ro Laren‚Äîwas destroyed by a series of bombs planted by the Typhon Pact, when an attempt to distract Starfleet from their efforts to discreetly use the wormhole backfires, although the station is evacuated in time so that only a thousand people are lost of those on the station at the time, none of whom are major characters. In honor of the station, and the Bajoran people, Starfleet Command and the Federation Council agreed to build a new station in the Bajoran system and name it Deep Space Nine.Star Trek: Typhon Pact ‚Äì Plagues of Night and Star Trek: Typhon Pact ‚Äì Raise the Dawn Crew and inhabitants Command crew *Benjamin Sisko, commanding officer *Kira Nerys, first officer; Bajoran attach√© * Constable Odo, chief security officer *Worf, strategic operations officerStarfleet First Officer (2372‚Äì2375) *Julian Bashir, chief medical officer *Jadzia Dax, science officer (2369‚Äì2374) *Ezri Dax, station counselor (2375) *Miles O'Brien, Chief Operations Officer (engineer) (2369‚Äì2375) Other crew *Martok, Klingon attach√© (2373‚Äì2375) *Nog, engineer (2373‚Äì2375) Notable civilian residents * Quark, owner of Quark's bar on the station's promenade * Jake Sisko, writer and journalist; son of Benjamin Sisko * Elim Garak, resident tailor; former Obsidian Order operative * Keiko O'Brien, wife to Miles O'Brien; school teacher and botanist * Morn, one of Quark's recurring customers throughout the series Mirror Universe \\"Terok Nor\\" is also a space station in the Mirror Universe, built under the authority of the Klingon-Cardassian Alliance in orbit of Bajor (because the wormhole is unknown there). In 2370, the station is the command post for the Alliance authority throughout the Bajoran sector, under the command of Intendant Kira Nerys. The station also serves as a processing center for uridium ore mined from Bajor; the processing facilities are manned by Terran slaves.Episode \\"Crossover\\" In 2372, the Terran Rebellion wrests control of the station away from the Alliance. The Alliance, determined to recapture the station, sends a fleet under Regent Worf to fight the rebels. The rebels are able to build their own Defiant, based on schematics for the Defiant in the primary universe, and they use it to defeat the Alliance fleet. Terok Nor remains a base of operations for the Terran Rebellion for at least the next three years.Episode \\"Shattered Mirror\\" Production design The station model was principally designed by Herman Zimmerman and Rick Sternbach.

Their odour, which is complex and remains the object of study, is a mixture of ammonia, fatty acids (in particular, isovaleric acid), and lactic acid. Odorous socks are a strong attractant for some animals, including dogs and mosquitos. They have proven useful in controlling the behaviour of these animals. Although the odour of smelly socks is often associated with feet, it arises independently of contact with human feet in various foodstuffs such as dairy products, cheeses, sausages and fish sauce, and is naturally present in several plants. The smell has also been noted in building and automotive air treatment systems, where it is described as \\"jock socks odour\\" or \\"dirty socks syndrome\\". Several technologies have been developed to incorporate materials into sock textiles which reduce or eliminate the strong smell. Analysis Compounds which cause socks to smell intensively include: # butyric acid, which smells like rancid butter # dimethyl disulphide, which smells like onions # dimethyl trisulphide # 2-heptanone, which smells like bananas # 2-nonanone, which smells like fat, fruit or flowers # 2-octanone, which smells like apples Air contamination The intense smell commonly results from bacterial action upon sweat which accumulates due to confining footwear. It has also presented itself as a problem among users of prosthetics. Smelly socks may be a source of air contamination in aircraft and dwellings. Their distinctive odour is commonly used as a reference. A 1996 Popular Mechanics article describes \\"jock socks odour\\" complaints as one of the magazine's most frequent queries with regard to automotive air conditioning systems, attributing it to fungal growth within the auto. The term \\"Dirty Sock Syndrome\\" is used to describe unpleasant odours that arise in building heating and cooling systems. High-efficiency heat pumps in the southeastern US have been noted as frequent offenders. Medical aspects The odour is a diagnostic feature of a serious medical condition, Isovaleric acidemia. A widespread consumer perception of the odour in the medication metformin, frequently used to treat Type 2 diabetes, may have contributed to patient refusals of the treatment. A test of olfactory abilities deemed useful in Japan employs detection of \\"sweaty socks\\", along with two other odours, as a useful metric of these abilities. When fresh, alkyl nitrites or \\"poppers\\", smell fruity, but when stale their aroma seems like smelly socks.Substance Use and Misuse: Nature, Context, and Clinical Interventions. G. Hussein Rassool. Wiley-Blackwell, 1998. . p.48 Solutions There are various products designed to handle the problem of smelly socks, by containing the smell or eliminating it. In a police station in Brighton, England, the police installed a stinkproof locker specifically to keep prisoners' smelly socks in while they are in custody. Several technologies have been developed to address the problem by modifying the composition of sock materials. In February 1997, The Daily Mirror reported that a new fabric had been invented by British scientists to eliminate smelly socks.The Mirror, February 1997, Smelly socks get the boot. Disinfectant treatments such as silver nanoparticles may be applied to socks to prevent them from smelling. The United States Air Force Academy issued a 2009 request to vendors that included socks incorporating antimicrobial silver yarn technology. This technology has encountered some opposition; a study conducted by researchers at Arizona State University examined the possibility that the silver particles could be released when the socks were washed, posing environmental concerns. In 2000, the University of California announced a joint venture with private companies to develop socks that would reduce the problem by incorporating halamine compounds, a relatively stable form of chlorine. In 2005 Dow Corning proposed the incorporation of alkoxysilanes as a preventive measure. Researchers reported, in 2011, on a technique to permanently block the development of pathogenic germs, which can cause odour in socks and other clothing. A team led by Jason Lockli of the University of Georgia reported in the American Chemical Society's Applied Materials and Interfaces that the anti-microbial treatment of \\"smelly socks\\" could \\"offer low cost protection for healthcare facilities, such as hospitals.\\" Animal attraction In a study of the odours most likely to attract mosquitos, smelly socks were found to be the most effective, topping the list along with Limburger cheese. Their strong odour will also attract other dangerous wild animals such as bear. Because this smell is so effective at attracting mosquitos, its use has been explored for mosquito control in places where malaria is prevalent. An imitation foot odour has been synthesised at the University of Wageningen. The synthetic odour is then used to bait traps which attract the mosquitos and so divert them from biting people. The synthetic mixture of ammonia, fatty acids, and lactic acid is effective but not as good as real sweaty socks. The composition of the authentic smell is still being analysed to determine the remaining active ingredients. A project in Kenya funded by Grand Challenges Canada and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation involves harvesting smelly sock odour with cotton pads that are then used to bait traps. The East African jumping spider or vampire spider preys upon mosquitos which have fed upon blood. It is attracted to the same smell for this reason and this has been demonstrated using an olfactometer which was loaded alternately with clean and smelly socks. Dogs are strongly attracted to the scent of socks that have been worn by humans. They may self-medicate themselves during attacks of separation anxiety by focusing on these items. The attraction is used in dog training, where the odorous socks may serve as a distractant or as a lure during crate training. Animal repelling Smelly socks have been used to repel deer. Benefits include they are cheap and accessible, require little effort to put out each morning, and are quite effective at keeping deer out of your flower garden. Artistic use The smell of dirty socks was the most unpleasant of the smells provided in the movie Polyester which featured Odorama in the form of scratch and sniff cards. At Fort Siloso in Singapore, the liquid scent of smelly socks is part of the exhibition which provides tourists with a sensory impression of its historical use during WW2. Botany Smelly Socks Grevillea The plant White Plume Grevillea has long white flowers whose stink resembles that of smelly socks, causing the plant to be known as \\"Smelly Socks Grevillea\\" or \\"Old Socks\\". Another plant with a similar smell and name is Clary Sage. The herb valerian has a musty smell of this sort too. Mushrooms of the genus Amanita often have a strong odour which may also seem like that of smelly socks. Fetishism Some people experience erotic arousal from smelly socks and so others may sell their used socks to those with this fetish. It is one of the most widespread forms of olfactophilia. In a 1994 study, 45% of those with a foot fetish were found to be aroused by smelly socks. Those aroused by smelly socks often are aroused only by a certain type of sock, or those worn by a particular person, or type of person, e.g. athletes. Folk medicine Smelly socks are favoured for use as a component in the making of powerful charms or spells, especially in voodoo or magic of African origin. They may be worn around the neck as a cure for a cold. In addition, used socks may be used in spells cast on particular people, namely love spells, (the socks of the two parties may be bound together during the spell) binding spells, (the socks of the offender are knotted to inflict a binding on that person) or curses (the socks are burned or otherwise destroyed to inflict harm on their wearer). Games The phrase \\"smelly socks\\" is inherently funny and so is commonly used in a game in which the subject must respond to any question with the phrase without laughing. Other physical games may use actual socks as a prop. Marketing Smelly socks were used as the basis for a marketing campaign for British Knights sneakers. Viewers were invited to send in their socks which would then be assessed for smell by a panel of judges which included a dog. Popular culture A recurring theme in the television series Married... with Children revolved around the stinky socks of the character Al Bundy.

After 6 years of playing in the metal underground, the band signed with Brazilian label \\"Kill Again Records\\" and released their debut album, \\"Chemical Assault\\". Then they went on tour through Brazil and later in France, Paraguay, Argentina, Chile, Peru, Uruguay, Venezuela, Japan, Belgium, Mexico and Italy. In August 2012, during an interview, Violator confirmed a new upcoming studio album for late 2012, and started playing live a new song called \\"Echoes of silence\\". History The band was formed in 2002 by four guys who had the common goal of making music that would add a new modern layer to the already established Thrash Metal scene. After a live rehearsal demo (Killer Instinct - 2002), a compilation album (Fast Food Thrash Metal) and plenty of gigs through Distrito Federal (Brazil) and surrounding areas, Violator got the opportunity to travel to Asuncion and play in Paraguay. After that, the band was invited to play as the opening act for German Thrash Metal pioneers, Destruction and American deathers, Malevolent Creation. In the first months of 2004, the band signed with Kill Again Records label and released an EP called Violent Mosh. The release resulted in over 40 concerts in the next two years. Violator traveled through 10 Brazilian states in the Moshing With Violence Tour. One of these concerts was recorded as a DVD for the first edition of Da Tribo Rock Magazine. Violent Mosh was also the first release by the band to be released outside Brazil. The EP was released on cassette in Bolivia by Grim Art Prods. The cassette was limited to 666 copies. In late 2005, the guitarist Juan Leda, had to leave the band to continue his studies in Argentina, his homeland. The farewell show was with Finnish thrashcore band For√ßa Macabra. As of early 2006 Violator was functioning as a power trio. After six months of recording and editing at Orbis studio in Bras√≠lia, the band came out with the first full- length album, Chemical Assault. The album release was also the return of the two guitar line-up, after M√°rcio Cambito joined the band. The band continued playing concerts in Brazil and in South America. In 2009 they had the opportunity to play at the True Thrash Fest at Osaka, Japan with Hirax, Fastkill, Abigail, Rose Rose, Riverge, Kings of Evil, Code Red, and Impaler. In 2010, Violator released their album, Annihilation Process, continuing on the typical Old School Thrash Metal style that the group has played since it was formed. That EP was the debut in studio of Marcio Cambito. The group toured Europe in the Plunging Into Annihilation Euro Tour 2010 with the American thrashers, Fueled By Fire. The band also released several splits in 2010, Thrashing The Tyrants with Bandanos, Raging Thrash with Hirax, and True Thrash Fest, a DVD that was recorded during their presentation at the True Thrash Fest 2009, and that also includes songs of the other groups that performed on that year's fest edition. In early 2011, Violator recorded their first official video, of the song Futurephobia, that is part of the album Annihilation Process.

Cangiante is characterized by a change in color necessitated by an original color's darkness or lightness limitation. For example, when painting shadows on a yellow object, the artist may use a red color simply because the yellow paint cannot be made dark enough. There are other methods of rendering shadows or highlights (for example, mixing the original hue with black or brown), but these can render the shadow color dull and impure. During the Renaissance, the variety and availability of paint colors were severely limited. An early example of cangiante by Giotto from the Arena Chapel. Note the shift in color on the robes.

Martin (born 1941) is an American politician who was a Democratic member of the Rhode Island House of Representatives. He represented the 75th District Newport from January 2009 to January 2015. He primarily served on the House Committees on Judiciary and Veteran‚Äôs Affairs. During his earlier terms of office he has served on the House Committees on Small Business, Separation of Powers, Municipal Government, and Government Oversight. In August 2010, Martin was appointed to a three-year term as the Rhode Island Legislative Commissioner on the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission. Early life and education Martin graduated from Providence College with a Bachelor of Arts in 1964 and from Bryant College with an MBA in 1977. Career  Politician  During the 2011 legislative session, Martin was successful in obtaining a pardon for John Gordon, an Irish immigrant who was hanged in 1845 for the murder of Amasa Sprague, a Rhode Island mill owner. The pardon was granted and signed by Governor Lincoln Chafee based on a House Judiciary Committee hearing in which conclusive evidence was presented that John Gordon had been given an unfair hearing by a prejudiced court. In addition to this pardon, Martin was able to get legislation passed to assist the Rhode Island Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force to expedite its investigation of traders of child pornography and other cybercrimes. In June 2011, Martin was awarded the 2011 Legislative of the Year Award by the National Association of Social Workers, Rhode Island Chapter. Martin was chosen for \\"his consistent work in the legislature for matters of importance to the association and especially for his legislative and personal efforts in the areas of homelessness and mental health issues\\". A former student at the Boston College School of Social Work, he served for many years on the board of directors at the Newport County Community Mental Health Center. In the 2012 legislation session, Martin introduced a bill which would honor military veterans by allowing them to request that their status as an honorably discharged veteran be imprinted on either their operator's license or their state issued identification card. The bill was passed by the House and Senate. It was signed by Chafee and became effective on September 1, 2012. By the end of 2014, 9041 veterans had taken advantage of this opportunity.  Author  In April 2013, Martin was awarded a plaque as the Legislator of the Year at the 78th Annual Disabled American Veterans Department Convention in Warwick, Rhode Island. Martin submitted a resolution honoring 2nd Lt. Robert Thorpe, a World War II veteran who was killed on May 27, 1944. This led to Thorpe being posthumously awarded the Rhode Island Star, the highest military honor conveyed by Rhode Island. As a result, Martin was invited to speak at the 2013 Reunion of the 39th Fighter Squadron in October 2013 at San Antonio, Texas. Martin ended his six years of service in the Rhode Island House of Representatives in January 2015. Following his retirement from the House of Representatives Martin worked with author Ken Dooley on producing a book, Relentless Pursuit - The Untold Story of the U.S. 5th Air Force's 39th Fighter Squadron. The book is based on the World War II experiences of 2nd Lt. Robert Thorpe and the other members of the 39th Fighter Squadron.  Musician  Starting in his early 50s, Peter Martin started playing blues harmonicas. He has 'sat in' with other performers and groups during his travels in Chicago, San Francisco, New Orleans, Providence and Newport, RI gaining him the nick name of \\"Harmonica Pete\\". He has played with various Rhode Island based Irish music groups. He is currently a member of the Young Geezers, a music group which makes regular performances at the Rhode Island Veterans Home in Bristol, RI and other 'volunteer' venues. Peter is also a pianist. He currently plays jazz and blues tunes on a regular basis for the enjoyment of visitors at a local hospital. He also has been hired to perform weekly at the Newport Marriott Hotel.

Distribution The plant is native to southern California and Baja California, where it is known only from vernally wet areas, such as vernal pools, ditches, and other areas that are wet or flooded during the rainy season and dry the rest of the year. Many of these habitat areas have alkali soils arranged in uneven mounds and depressions that collect water and drain slowly before drying up.USFWS. Proposed Revised Critical Habitat for Navarretia fossalis (Spreading Navarretia). June 10, 2009. The plant became a federally listed threatened species in the United States in 1998, when there were approximately 30 occurrences of the species remaining in Southern California and about nine left across the border in Baja California. By 2009, an additional 17 occurrences had been documented. The plant often occurs with Psilocarphus brevissimus.Center for Plant Conservation Description Navarretia fossalis is a hairy annual herb producing a spreading stem up to about 15 centimeters high. The hairless leaves are up to 5 centimeters long and are divided into narrow linear lobes that turn spiny sharp when dry. The inflorescence is a flat-topped head 1 or 2 centimeters wide filled with lobed bracts and clusters of flowers. The white or purple-tinged flowers are under a centimeter long and have corollas divided into minute narrow lobes under a millimeter long. The fruit capsule yields a clump of tiny seeds that remain stuck together until they become wet, turning into a sticky, separating mass.

The plant has 1200 EDF employees and 350 permanent workers. The four reactors produce about 25 TWh per year which is about 5% of the total electricity consumption in France (2015: 476 TWh). Since its commissioning, the Blayais nuclear power plant has produced more than 800 TWh, nearly twice the equivalent of the French electricity production in one year. In its 2016 annual report, the Nuclear Safety Authority (ASN) finds that \\"the nuclear safety and environmental protection performance of the Blayais NPP on the whole matches ASN's general assessment of EDF and that it's radiation protection performance stands out positively\\", but asked for \\"more effective management of the nuclear waste produced during reactor outages\\". Selected incidents 1999 flooding On the evening of 27 December 1999, a combination of the incoming tide and high winds overwhelmed the sea walls at the plant and causing parts of the plant to be flooded.Generic Results and Conclusions of Re-evaluating the Flooding in French and German Nuclear Power Plants J.

T√ºrschmann, Eurosafe Forum 2001, published 2001, accessed 2011-03-21 The event resulted in the loss of the plant's off-site power supply and knocked out several safety- related backup systems, resulting in a 'level 2' event on the International Nuclear Event Scale.COMMUNIQUE N¬∞7 - INCIDENT SUR LE SITE DU BLAYAIS ASN, published 1999-12-30, accessed 2011-03-22 At the time, units 1, 2 and 4 were at full power, while unit 3 was shut down for refuelling. The operation of units 1 and 2 were affected by flood damage to a number of water pumps and distribution panels, all four units lost their 225 kV power supplies, while units 2 and 4 also lost their 400 kV power supplies. Diesel backup generators were employed to maintain power to plants 2 and 4 until the 400 kV supply was restored. Over the following days an estimated of water was pumped out of the flooded buildings. On 5 January, the regional newspaper Sud-Ouest ran the following headline without being contradicted:Very close to a major accident, explaining that a catastrophe had been narrowly avoided.Sud-Ouest, 5 janvier 2000 - Centrale de Blaye : Tr√®s pr√®s de l'accident majeur The flooding resulted in fundamental changes to the evaluation of flood risk at nuclear power plants, and in the precautions taken.Lessons Learned from 1999 Blayais Flood: Overview of the EDF Flood Risk Management Plan, Eric de Fraguier, EDF, published 2010-03-11, accessed 2011-03-22 In Germany the flooding prompted the Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety to order an evaluation of the German nuclear power plants.

It is long and a right hand tributary of the Oder. The Sieber rises at 760 metres on the Bruchberg massif and flows through Herzberg before discharging at Hattorf into the Oder which, in turn, flows into the Rhume. Its tributaries include the Gro√üe Kulmke, Gro√üe Lonau and Goldenke. In February 1910, as part of his hydrological research into the Rhumequelle, Karl Th√ºrnau dyed the Sieber tributary of the Eichelbach (Herzberg) with six kilogrammes of fluorescein. Three days later, weakly dyed water appeared in the main source of the Rhumequelle. This was confirmed in 1980 by dye tracing carried out by the Geological Survey of Lower Saxony (Nieders√§chsischen Landesamtes f√ºr Bodenforschung). This also indicated links between the Rhumequelle and the Sieber near H√∂rden and the Oder near Scharzfeld. The construction of a dam was planned but never realised. As a result the Sieber valley is the only unregulated river valley in the western Harz.

(also spelled Iznaga by some sources), was a Cuban American heiress who married George, Viscount Mandeville, in 1876. She became the Duchess of Manchester when her husband succeeded to the dukedom in 1890. Family background Portrait by John Singer Sargent, 1907 Consuelo Yznaga was born in 1853, in New York City, the second of four children of diplomat Antonio Modesto Yznaga del Valle (1823‚Äì1892) and Ellen Maria Clement (1833‚Äì1908). Her father was from an old Cuban family that owned a large plantation (Torre Iznaga) and sugar mills in the vicinity of Trinidad, Cuba; they had connections to several Spanish aristocratic families. Her mother, Ellen Maria Clement, was the daughter of Samuel Clement, a steamboat captain, and Maria Augusta Little. She grew up at Ravenswood Plantation in Concordia Parish, Louisiana, which she inherited when her parents died. Her parents acquired properties in New York and in Newport, Rhode Island, while retaining the plantations in Cuba and Louisiana. Her sister, Naticia Yznaga, married Sir John Lister-Kaye, 3rd Baronet (1853‚Äì1924) in 1881. Her brother, Fernando Yznaga (1850‚Äì1901), was married to Mary Virginia \\"Jennie\\" Smith, sister of Alva Smith Vanderbilt Belmont, Consuelo's childhood best friend., Retrieved 17 July 2015. Life and activities In her teenage years, she became known on New York's social scene as one of the group called the Buccaneers. During her marriage, she engaged herself in charitable organizations. Poverty was a cause that concerned her, and she was also interested in education and health. The Duchess of Manchester was a renowned beauty, as were her sisters ‚Äì Emilie Yznaga and Natividad (Natica) Yznaga. The latter was the wife of Sir John Pepys Lister-Kaye, 3rd Baronet. The Duchess was a celebrated society figure, belonging to the intimate circle of Edward VII of the United Kingdom, formerly the Prince of Wales. Shortly before her death, she entertained King Edward and Nicholas II, the Czar of Russia, while the Czar was on a visit in England. Upon her brother's death in 1901, he left her $2,000,000. Marriage and issue In the autumn of 1875, she met George Montagu, Viscount Mandeville (1853‚Äì1892), at her father's country home in Morristown, New Jersey. On 22 May 1876, at Grace Church in Manhattan, New York City, she married Viscount Mandeville. After their marriage, they settled on the Duke of Manchester's estate centered on Tandragee Castle in County Armagh in Ulster, Ireland. They had a son and twin daughters: * William Montagu, 9th Duke of Manchester (1877‚Äì1947), who married, firstly, Helena Zimmerman, in 1900, and had issue. They divorced in 1931, and later that same year, he married Kathleen Dawes (d. 1966), on 17 December 1931. * Lady Jacqueline Mary Alva Montagu, known as \\"May\\" (1879‚Äì1895), who, although not diagnosed before she died, is commonly believed to have died of consumption. * Lady Alice Eleanor Louise Montagu, known as \\"Nell\\" (1879‚Äì1900), who died of consumption. Death and legacy The Duchess died of neuritis on 20 November 1909. At her bedside upon her death were her sisters, Lady Lister-Kaye and Emily Yznaga. Her estate, valued at $2,493,131 (an approximate value of $69 million in 2017 rates), was left to her various family members. On her death in 1909, the Duchess bequeathed a bracelet to her friend Queen Alexandra.

The T1000 was built as 162 single cars from 1964 to 1978. From 1979 to 1985, 33 new T1300 trains were built, followed by the conversion of 16 T1000s. Six two-car T2000 units were delivered in 1994. Since 2005, the first 83 three-car MX3000 units have been replacing the older stock, and the last T1000 was retired in 2007. From 2010, only MX3000-trains are in use. The T1000/T1300 and T2000 were built by Str√∏mmens V√¶rksted, with motors from Norsk Elektrisk & Brown Boveri (NEBB) and AEG, respectively, and the MX3000 were built by Siemens. All trains receive 750 V DC from a third rail shoe, while the T1300 and T2000 also have pantographs. This allows the latter to also operate on the suburban lines of the Oslo Tramway, which the western part of the current metro was part of until 1995. All trains feature automatic train protection and step-free access from the platforms. Trains can operate up to six cars in length. The T1000/T1300 and MX3000 are capable of , while the T2000 can operate at . The T2000 introduced articulated cars, while the MX3000 introduced regenerative brakes and air conditioning. The T1000/T1300 and MX3000 can be run in multiple with each other, but not with the T2000. The MX3000 replaced the red color scheme with a white livery. History In 1954, the Oslo City Council decided to build a four-line metro to the new suburbs to the east of the city center. The plans called for the system to open in 1966, with the conversion of the √òstensj√∏ Line and the Lambertseter Line of the Oslo Tramway, and the new Furuset Line and Grorud Line. The system would feature higher and longer platforms, allowing step-free access to six-car trains, automatic train protection and third-rail power supply. This would make the metro incompatible with the existing tramways in Oslo.Aspenberg, 1994: 29 The first units in the T1000 series were two single-car prototypes designated T. They were test-run on the existing tramways from 1959 to 1960, and were then put into service on the Kols√•s Line. Prone to technical faults, they were taken out of regular service in 1982.Aspenberg, 1994: 62‚Äì63 Valler Serial production of the T1000 started in 1964 by Str√∏mmens V√¶rksted, NEBB and AEG. Until 1978, 162 cars were delivered to Oslo Sporveier. These were manufactured in four series, designated T1 through T4, with minor changes to specifications. During the late 1970s, the western suburban lines which were part of the tramway needed new rolling stock. Oslo Sporveier was at the time considering connecting the metro with these lines, and between 1978 and 1981, 33 new T1300 cars were built. The only difference from the T1000 was that they had a pantograph that allowed them to operate on the tramways. They also retained the necessary technical appliances to run on the metro. The new T1300 were designated T5 and T6. From 1985 to 1989, 16 T4s were rebuilt to T1300 and designated T7 and T8. Oslo Sporveier was highly satisfied with the SL79 articulated trams that had been delivered during the 1980s. In 1985, work started on the development of a modified version for the western suburban lines. The stock on the Holmenkollen and Kols√•s Lines were the first that needed to be replaced. At the same time, the company wanted to make the trains compatible with the metro so they could operate on both systems. The new stock was considered to be a trial; if it met performance expectations, future orders could be made to replace the T1000 stock, after the latter reached the end of its economical life in about 2000. The required specification for the new train was published in October 1988. In the late 1980s, it was decided to upgrade the R√∏a and Sognsvann Lines to metro standard. This would allow them to use T1000 stock. Twelve T2000 were ordered in 1991, and would be sufficient to operate the services on the Holmenkollen and Kols√•s Lines, that would retain an overhead wire. The development costs for the T2000 were in part subsidized by the government, as the high-tech product from Str√∏mmens Verksted (by then part of the ABB Group) and AEG was seen as a future export product. The trains were delivered in 1994 and taken into use in 1995. The same year, the metro started operating all services through the city center, connecting the western and eastern networks.Aspenberg, 1995: 46 Holmenkollen In 1996, the work to establish a financing package for new investments in public transport in Akershus and Oslo started. Oslo Package 2 was passed in 2001 and allowed municipal and state grants to be supplemented by increased fare and toll road revenue to finance, among other things, new trains for the metro. The initial order by Oslo Sporveier in 2003 from Siemens was for 33 units (99 cars), plus options for further orders. In 2005, the city council voted to replace all existing T1000 and T1300 stock with the MX3000, increasing the quantity by another 30 units. Two test units were delivered in October 2005, with the first serial deliveries in April 2007. With the delivery of the new white and gray trains, Oslo Sporveier received criticism that they had been disloyal to the old red color of the metro, and that they did not follow up on their former design concept from the 1960s through the 1980s. Following the 2006 decision to convert the Kols√•s Line to metro standard, Akershus County Municipality announced they would order five units. In November 2006, the city government proposed that the maintenance of the new trains be privatized. This resulted in protests from the employees, who campaigned by refusing to work overtime. As a result, after a few weeks, the company lacked 57 trains to provide adequate service. The issue was solved when the socialist opposition parties along with the Liberal Party agreed to postpone the matter until after all the new trains were delivered in 2009. As part of the agreement, a new limited company, Oslo Vognselskap, wholly owned by Kollektivtransportproduksjon, would take ownership of all metro trains and trams used by the operating companies. Responsibility for the debt accumulated for buying the trains is to be managed by Oslo Vognselskap, while operation and management of the maintenance contracts was transferred to Oslo T-banedrift. In 2008, the city council in Oslo decided to upgrade the Holmenkollen Line to metro standard, to allow six- car MX3000 trains to be the main mode of transport to Holmenkollen Ski Jump during the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2011. This will allow 9,000 people per hour to be transported to the sports venue. The first T1000 was scrapped on 14 March 2007, and the last T1000 train was run on 19 July 2009. Oslo Tramway Museum has preserved six T1000 cars, no. 1002 (T1-2), 1018 (T1-2), 1076 (T1-1), 1092 (T2), 1129 (T3) and 1141 (T4). In 2008, the T2000 were taken out of service while the Holmenkollen Line was being renovated. In 2010, Ruten decided that they would not put back into service, largely because of high maintenance costs and low availability of spare parts because of the technically complex design and small series. The last T1300 was retired on 22 May 2010, after which only MX3000 units are used on the metro. Specifications R√∏a The Oslo Metro uses 750 volt direct current fed to the train via a third rail, along a standard gauge track. The system is not compatible to the Oslo Tramway, but the T1300 and T2000 have been built to run on both the suburban lines of the tramway and the metro. The platforms are long, and the height of the train floors are above the track, allowing step- free access to the platforms. The trains' speed are controlled by an automatic train protection (ATP) system. The speed codes are transferred from the ATP points in the infrastructure, using 75 hertz pulses in the tracks. The trains pick up the signals via antennas. The speed codes are , , and . They are communicated to the engineer via signals in the driver's cab; in addition, the system will automatically reduce the speed, should the limit be exceeded. The driver can put the trains in an automatic mode, where the train itself adjusts its speed to the limit. The driver is always responsible for starting and halting the train at stations. T1000 Holmenkollen The T1000 were built by Str√∏mmens V√¶rksted and is long, wide and high. Each car is equipped with two bogies. The axle distance is , the bogie distance is and the wheel diameter is . The cars are equipped with four motors each from NEBB, giving a maximum speed of . The weight is and the electrical equipment was delivered by AEG.  The T1300 differ in that they have a pantograph and were built for conductors. The seating also varies: T1000 has a total capacity of 180 passengers, of which 63 can sit. T5 has the same total capacity, but 70 people can sit. T6 has a capacity for 154 people, of which 64 can be seated. T7 and T8 have a capacity for 177 passengers, of which 60 can be seated. All models are capable of operating six cars in multiple, although they are commonly used in shorter configurations. T2000 The T2000 was built by Str√∏mmens V√¶rksted and AEG as twin-car units. Each car's aluminum body is long, high and wide. The empty weight of a car is . Capacity is for 60 seated and 125 standing passengers. There is a driver's cabin at one end of each car. Passengers sit in two compartments; the forward has conventional 2+2 seating, while the back section has 1+2+1 seating with two aisles. Both cars have power on all axles, giving a Bo'Bo' wheel arrangement. Four motors, each with , power the car, giving a top speed of and an acceleration of 1.3 m/s2 (4.3 ft/s2). The trains are equipped with both pantograph and third-rail shoe. The trains cannot be connected for multiple running with the T1000 trains. MX3000 MX3000 interior The MX3000 is a three-car electric multiple unit built exclusively for the Oslo Metro by Siemens in Vienna, Austria. The units are designed by Porsche Design Studio, and have a body in aluminum. A three- car train is long; the end cars are long each, while the center car is long. The cars are wide and tall. An empty three-car unit weighs , while it with full payload weighs . Each three-car unit has 138 seats, and a total capacity of 493 riders. There are three doors on each side of each car, measuring wide and high. In service, the units either run single (with three cars) or two units in multiple (with six cars). Each car is equipped with four three-phase asynchronous motors, giving each three-car unit a power output of . The MX3000 introduced a number of technical innovations to the metro. Regenerative brakes allow the dynamic brakes to feed the braking energy back to the power system via the third rail. The passengers also have air conditioning. The driver's cabs are more ergonomic than in the older models, and the mirrors to monitor the platforms have been replaced with cameras and screens. The trains' livery is white with gray detailing, instead of the former models' red with blue detailing. For use in areas without a third rail, such as at depots, the trains are equipped with a 110 V battery. This will remove the need for shunting at the depots and cut costs.

Pimental (June 19, 1965 ‚Äì August 8, 1985) was an American soldier of the United States Army who was killed by the Red Army Faction in West Germany. Biography Pimental was born on June 19, 1965, in Fall River, Massachusetts, and raised in New York City. He joined the United States Army and was assigned to the 563rd Ordnance Company, which was located at Camp Pieri in Wiesbaden, West Germany. Death On the night of August 7, 1985, Pimental and other American soldiers visited the Western Saloon nightclub in Wiesbaden, where he was invited by a woman to walk her home, leaving the bar with her. The woman was Birgit Hogefeld, a member of the Red Army Faction, a militant far-left organization that carried out attacks against American military targets in West Germany. Pimental was killed by a shot to the head in the nearby woods, and his U.S. military identification card was stolen. Pimental's identification card was used the next morning by a male Red Army Faction member to gain access to the Rhein-Main Air Base and place a car bomb. A Volkswagen Passat loaded with about 240 kg of explosives was detonated at the base, resulting in the death of two American servicemen, the wounding of eleven, and substantial material damage. A \\"Command George Jackson\\" claimed responsibility in a letter signed by the Red Army Faction and the French Action directe armed group, reaching the Frankfurter Rundschau desk and two news agencies the same day. Pimental's stolen identification card was sent to Reuters in Frankfurt on August 13. Aftermath The murder of Edward Pimental caused heated discussions in the far-left circles in West Germany because it was the first time a person without major political or economic status was killed deliberately, contradicting the legacy of the 1968 movement. The Red Army Faction attempted to justify the murder by proclaiming Pimental as a \\"contract warmonger\\" for being a voluntary member of the United States military, but they later referred to it as a \\"mistake\\". In 1994 and 1996, Hogefeld and Eva Haule were convicted of participation in the murder of Pimental and sentenced to life imprisonment by the Frankfurt Higher Regional Court. Haule was released on parole in 2007, while Hogefeld was eventually freed in 2011, being the last member of the Red Army Faction to leave prison.

It hosts events in 45 towns and cities each year. The company's events have been criticised for encouraging binge drinking and wreaking havoc on communities. Drunken participants have gained notoriety for urinating on war memorials as well as beating homeless and elderly people. Several student unions have banned the company from advertising on campus. Background The idea for Carnage UK was originally taken from a University of Birmingham event named 'Carnage', run by the university's raising-and-giving society Carnival Rag. The original Birmingham Carnage has since been rebranded as 'Karma', with all proceeds going to charity. Carnage UK arranges events for an estimated 350,000 undergraduate students in 45 towns and cities each year. For ¬£10, students receive a t-shirt and free entry to around 10 local pubs, bars and nightclubs, with many of the venues offering drinks promotions during the events. The company is part of the Varsity Leisure Group. According to the company's website, they are \\"always looking for fun & bubbly student promotional staff\\".

The photograph was later published in a number of newspapers. The student pleaded guilty to outraging public decency. The judge in the case said that he felt the student's actions were directly caused by his heavy consumption of alcohol and that Carnage UK should also have been present in court. Responding to this criticism, a press officer for Carnage UK told PR Week that much of the press coverage over the incident had been unfair. He pointed out that more than 2000 students attended the event and that the student who urinated was responsible for his own actions. University of Exeter After an event in Exeter in October 2009, it was reported that the police were to consider charging the company for the extra officers that needed to be deployed whilst their events were running.

The concept is synonymous, and, according to Hofmann, Treimer and Schmidt, etymologically related, to the Classical Latin word fides, which in Late Ancient and Medieval Latin took on the Christian meaning of \\"faith, (religious) belief\\" today extant in Romance languages (and then also loaned into Albanian, as feja), but which originally had an ethical/juridical scope. The Albanian adjective besnik, derived from besa, means \\"faithful\\", \\"trustworthy\\", i.e. one who keeps his word. Besnik for men and Besa for women continue to be very popular names among Albanians.  Cultural concept and institution  Besa is a word in the Albanian language meaning pledge of honor. The concept is based upon faithfulness toward one's word in the form of loyalty or as an allegiance guarantee. Besa contains mores toward obligations to the family and a friend, the demand to have internal commitment, loyalty and solidarity when conducting oneself with others and secrecy in relation to outsiders. The besa is also the main element within the concept of the ancestor‚Äôs will or pledge (amanet) where a demand for faithfulness to a cause is expected in situations that relate to unity, national liberation and independence that transcend a person and generations. The concept of besa is included in the Kanun, the customary law of the Albanian people. The besa was an important institution within the tribal society of the Albanian Malisors (highlanders). Albanian tribes swore oaths to jointly fight against the government and in this aspect the besa served to uphold tribal autonomy. The besa was used toward regulating tribal affairs between and within the Albanian tribes. The Ottoman government used the besa as a way to co-opt Albanian tribes in supporting state polices or to seal agreements. During the Ottoman period, the besa would be cited in government reports regarding Albanian unrest, especially in relation to the tribes. The besa formed a central place within Albanian society in relation to generating military and political power. Besas held Albanians together, united them and would wane when the will to enforce them dissipated. In times of revolt against the Ottomans by Albanians, the besa functioned as a link among different groups and tribes. History In the Statutes of Scutari, according to Ardian Klosi and Ardian Vehbiu, the verb bessare (trans. to make an oath) is the first documentation of this concept. Afterwards in the missal translated by Gjon Buzuku it is used as per faith () \\"o gruo, e madhe √§shte besa jote\\" (; Gospel of Matthew 15:28). In the early 19th century, Markos Botsaris, in his Greek-Albanian dictionary, translated the Albanian \\"besa\\" (written \\"ŒºœÄŒ≠œÉŒ±\\") as the Greek \\"Œ∏œÅŒ∑œÉŒ∫ŒµŒØŒ±\\", meaning \\"religion\\", or, by extension, \\"faith\\". In 1896, the Ottoman government provincial almanac for Kosovo titled Kosova Salnamesi had a two-page entry on besa and compared it to the French concept of parole d'honneur (word of honor).  Late Ottoman period  During the Great Eastern Crisis, Albanians gathered in Prizren, Kosovo (1878) and made a besa to form a political alliance (League of Prizren) aimed at upholding Ottoman territorial integrity to prevent the partition of Albanian lands by neighbouring Balkan countries. In 1881 Albanians swore a besa and rebelled against the Ottoman government. Abdul Hamid II opposed blood feuds of the Albanian tribes and issued (1892‚Äì1893) a proclamation to the people of the I»ôkodra (Shkod√´r) area urging them to make a besa and reject the practice, in the hope that the very institution (besa) that upheld the vendetta could be used against it. In 1907, the empire sent a military inspection commission to Kosovo and one of its fact finding objectives was concerned with the prevention of a \\"general besa\\" against the Ottoman government. During the Young Turk Revolution of July 1908, Kosovo Albanians that gathered at Firzovik (Ferizaj) agreed to a besa toward pressuring sultan Abdul Hamid II to restore constitutional government. In November 1908 during the Congress of Manastir on the Albanian alphabet question, delegates selected a committee of 11 that swore a besa promising that nothing would be revealed before a final decision and in keeping with that oath agreed to two alphabets as the step forward. During the Albanian revolt of 1910, Kosovo Albanian chieftains gathered at Firzovik and swore a besa to fight the centralist polices of the Ottoman Young Turk government. In the Albanian revolt of 1912, Albanians pledged a besa against the Young Turk government which they had assisted into gaining power in 1908. Haxhi Zeka, a landowner from Ipek (Pej√´) organized a meeting of 450 Kosovo Albanian notables in 1899 and they agreed to form Besa-Bes√´ (League of Peja) to fight the Ottoman government and swore a besa to suspend all blood feuding.  World War II  During World War II under German occupation, Albanians rescued and hid over 2000 Jews from Nazi persecution, motivated in part by the cultural institution of besa that emphasises aiding and protecting people in moments of need.  Modern period  In Montenegro, an event \\"Beslidhja e Mal√´sis√´\\" (Pledge of Mal√´sia) took place in Tuzi (28 June 1970) in the presence of Catholic and Muslim clergy. Families and other extended kin in the Malesia region made a besa and agreed to cease blood feuding and accept state judicial outcomes for victims and perpetrators.

The play revolved around a betrothed girl kidnapped by a jealous villager that kills her father and whose mother vows revenge co-opting the culprit's father who gives his besa to help not knowing it is his son, later killing him and himself ending with family reconciliation. At the time the play's discussion of besa signified to more astute Ottoman audiences the political implications of the concept and possible subversive connotations in future usage while it assisted Albanians in rallying militarily and politically around a national program. By the early twentieth century, the themes of the play highlighting a besa for self-sacrifice of the homeland carried a subversive message for Albanians to aim at unifying the nation and defend the homeland, something Ottoman authorities viewed as fostering nationalist sentiments. Frash√´ri wrote a political treatise Albania: What she has been, What she is, What she shall be (1899) on the Albanian question and proposed that Albanians make a besa to demand the empire and Europe recognize Albanian national rights, especially by applying pressure upon the Ottomans to achieve those aims. Besa is a key theme in the novel Kush e solli Doruntin√´n (usually abbreviated in English to \\"Doruntine\\") (1980), by Albanian novelist Ismail Kadare. In the 1980s until 1994, a bimonthly newspaper named Besa was published by the Arvanite community of Greece. para. 20. In the 2010s, the cultural institution of besa featured in an international exhibition named Besa: A Code of Honor by photographer Norman H. Gershman and in an award-winning documentary film Besa: The Promise on the survival of Jews in Albania during the Holocaust.

The western side lacks water. The island is uninhabited and is used as a winter feeding ground for sheep. Average annual precipitation is approximately six inches. The rocks on the island are mostly early Paleozoic in age. Precambrian strata are present at the north tip and along a portion of the northeast shore. The quartzite ledge on the southern part of the island is Devonian in age. The remaining northern third of the island dates back to the Cambrian Period, consisting of a small outcrop of Tintic Quartzite, but mainly middle Cambrian limestone, shale, and dolomite. The rest of the island is composed of Upper Cambrian to Upper Mississippian strata, mostly limestone, dolomite, quartzite, and shale. The southern half of the island was folded into a southward anticline.

Starring Chandler in the title role, the film also features Ronald Howard, Joanne Dru, Julie London and Donald Crisp. Set in the town of Kennesaw, Georgia in the months immediately following the American Civil War, the story depicts the efforts of a resolute Union Army officer who had participated in the town's destruction during Sherman's March determined to make amends. Plot Union officers Major Drango and Captain Banning ride into a Georgia town ravaged by the Civil War and still bitter about the lives and property lost. Drango is the new military governor, but townspeople including Judge Allen and his son Clay make it clear that these Yankees are not welcome. A local man seen as disloyal to the Confederacy is lynched. The man's daughter, Kate Calder, blames Drango for letting it happen. Drango attempts to bring the men responsible to justice, but wealthy Shelby Ransom harbors the fugitives, including Clay, her lover. Union colonel Bracken finds fault with Drango for not being tough enough, so he confiscates the town's food supply and rations it. Clay's men stage a raid. A doctor and newspaper editor offer Drango their support in restoring order. The newspaper office is set ablaze and the editor's young son is accidentally killed. Kate now sides with Drango, and an angered Shelby tries to order Clay from her home, but he slaps her and makes her lure Capt. Banning to an ambush. Now even the judge is appalled by Clay's unlawful acts. He warns his son this must stop. Clay refuses to listen and shoots Drango, wounding him. He is about to kill Drango when a bullet from his father ends Clay's life, restoring law and order to the town.

A Journey from Abercrombie to Zwicker, David McKie, Windmill Books, 2014, p. 84 of Richard Lower, a schoolmaster, and his wife in Chiddingly. Richard and Mary (n√©e Oxley) gave Lower a good education. It appears he showed an early interest in heraldry as a painted coat of arms in the local church is attributed to him.Chiddingly Church, Sussex, accessed November 2009 He worked first at his sister's school in East Hoathly, before further extending the family's interests in local education with a school at Alfriston under his control. Within three years however he left to establish another school in Lewes in Sussex in 1835. The Sussex Martyrs are still remembered today He married Mercy Holman in 1835 when his school had moved to St. Anne's House in Lewes High Street. He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1844.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory His establishment of the Sussex Archaeological Society with J. H. Hurdis in 1846 established Lower as a well regarded notable antiquarian. His publication of The Sussex Martyrs, their Examinations and Cruel Burnings in the time of Queen Mary... in 1851 together with an etching by James Henry Hurdis of Richard Woodman and nine other martyrs is credited with establishing the \\"cult of the Sussex Martyrs\\".Christopher Whittick, 'Hurdis, James Henry (1800‚Äì1857)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 accessed 6 Nov 2009 However it is noted that his Sussex Martyrs was really a re-publication of John Foxe's account in his Book of Martyrs. Although Lower is credited with publicising the Sussex Martyrs, he does not appear to have started the Bonfire Societies. His biography credits him with writing a note complaining of the excesses of the \\"Bonfire Boys\\", and he had himself been an active member of the Lewes New Temperance Society. Lower said that he had published the Sussex Martyrs because their deaths had been largely forgotten and high churchmen were referring to the Reformation and the deaths of these people as a mistake. Following the publications \\"anti-popish\\" demonstrations took place each year around 5 Nov. In 1868 a figure dressed as the \\"Bishop of Lewes\\" warned protestants of the Roman Catholic threat and the following year an effigy of the pope was to be blown up with gunpowder. Title page, A Compendious History of Sussex, Mark Antony Lower, 1870 Lower published numerous articles for the Sussex Archaeological Society and he was employed for a number of years as a secretary. He published Patronymica Britannica: A Dictionary of the Family Names of the United Kingdom in 1860 and The Worthies of Sussex in 1865. Mercy Lower died in 1867. The widower married Sarah Scrase three years later after moving to Seaford. His important Sussex local history book, A Compendious History of Sussex was completed just a year before he left Lewes for London.

This ability is attributed to van der Waals force,Researchers discover how geckos know when to hold tight although a more recent study suggests that water molecules of roughly monolayer thickness (present on virtually all natural surfaces) also play a role. Developments In 2007, researchers from the University of Akron and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute announced they had developed a form of flexible, reusable gecko tape using carbon nanotubes to create microscopic synthetic setae and spatulae capable of supporting a shear stress of 32 N/cm2, which is four times the strength of a gecko's foot. In 2008 researchers from the University of Dayton reported a gecko glue capable of supporting 100N/cm2, ten times the strength generated by a gecko's foot.

Because the two components share their outer layers, as the components of W Ursae Majoris do, they have the same stellar classification, and are classified as yellow G-type main sequence dwarfs. The components take 0.2783 days (roughly 6.7 hours) to revolve around a common barycentre. Orbital period variations suggest the presence of one more additional perturbing objects of likely low-mass stellar nature. Unseen companion(s) Orbital period variations suggest the presence of one more perturbing unseen object around the eclipsing binary. Several publications have tried to set constrains to putative orbital period and minimum mass for unseen component. The most recent article proposes an orbital period of 29.8 years for a stellar object with roughly three fourths the Sun's mass and high orbital eccentricity (e=0.66). Inclination is assumed being 33.6 degrees.s Nevertheless, hints of an additional body in the system still subsist and the authors infer a period of 77.46 years and eccentricity of 0.54 for unseen fourth component. Minimum mass is unclear, tentatively assumed being as small as 0.19 solar masses, as inferred by Pribulla et al. in 2000. In any case orbital solutions are still blurry and further calculations are needed to provide a more robust model. With the release of Gaia DR2, the presence of any stellar companions was ruled out.The recorded excess noise for the stars is 0.398 ¬± 0.008 mas, which corresponds to an angular size of 0.0106 ¬± 0.0002 AU at the stars' distance. This rules out any bodies capable of perturbing the stars by more than 0.0106 AU from their current velocities over the 2-year observation period.

In 1997, some Anglicans in the Torres Strait region of the former diocese were received into the Traditional Anglican Communion (a Continuing Anglican body) and formed themselves into the Church of Torres Strait. In 2010 they petitioned the Vatican for reception as a personal ordinariate in the Catholic Church. In April 2014, this petition (slightly modified, as the original petition was for a separate jurisdiction) was granted by Pope Francis. According to the agreement, the Church of Torres Strait was to become a territory under the jurisdiction of the Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of the Southern Cross, but day-to-day authority would remain devolved to a regional vicar. However, with the exception of the parish on Dauan Island (which joined the ordinariate), the Church of Torres Strait subsequently joined the Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church instead.

They are mostly evergreen, though in subtropical gardens Beaumontia grandiflora loses many leaves in winter. Leaves are large, smooth and opposite with sticky white sap. The large white fragrant flowers are borne in corymbs terminal and in the leaf axils. The calyx is 5-lobed and the corolla is dark funnel-or bell-shaped with 5 lobes. Stamens are attached near the base of the corolla tube and have slender filaments with arrow-shaped anthers. They are very showy when in full bloom and are regarded as among the most outstanding vines of the world. The fruits comprises a pair of thick woody follicles. Cultivation The Beaumontia species are cultivated as ornamental plants, with Beaumontia grandiflora widely grown by the nursery trade. They prefer good soil, adequate water and hot moist conditions. They are found planted and trained as vines in subtropical climate gardens, such as in Southern California.Graf, Alfred Byrd (1986) Tropica: color cyclopedia of exotic plants and trees for warm-region horticulture‚Äîin cool climate the summer garden or sheltered indoors; 3rd ed.

It consolidated statutory English criminal law related to accomplices, including many classes of encouragers (inciters). Mainly its offences were, according to the draftsman of the Act,Greaves. The Criminal Law Consolidation and Amendment Acts (1861) pp. 3-4 replacement enactments with little or no variation in phraseology. It is one of a group of Acts sometimes referred to as the Criminal Law Consolidation Acts 1861. It was passed with the object of simplifying the law. It collected the relevant parts of Peel's Acts (and the equivalent Irish Acts) and others.James Edward Davis. The Criminal Law Consolidation Statutes of the 24 & 25 of Victoria, Chapters 94 to 100: Edited with Notes, Critical and Explanatory. Butterworths. 1861. Page vii. Provisions still in force The Act provides that an accessory to an indictable offence shall be treated in the same way as if he had committed the offence: Section 8 of the Act, as amended, reads: Section 10 states that the Act does not apply to Scotland. The active section thus applies to England, Northern Ireland and Wales. The rest of the Act was repealed by the Criminal Law Act 1967 to make easier the abolition of the distinction between felonies and misdemeanours; (see below). Case law In AG's Reference (No 1 of 1975) (1975) QB 773, Lord Chief Justice Widgery stated that the words in section 8 should be given their ordinary meaning. * The natural meaning of \\"to aid\\" is to \\"give help, support or assistance to\\" and it will generally although not necessarily take place at the scene of the crime. It is not necessary to prove that there was any agreement between the principal and the alleged accessory, nor is there a need to prove a causative link between the aid and the commission of the offence by the principal. * The natural meaning of \\"to abet\\" is \\"to incite, instigate or encourage\\" and this can only be committed by an accessory who is present when the crime is committed. This does imply either an express or implied agreement between the parties although there is no need to prove any causative link between what the abettor did and the commission of the offence. * \\"To counsel\\" is \\"to encourage\\" and most usually covers advice, information, encouragement or the supply of equipment before the commission of a crime. It implies agreement with the principal. In R v Clarkson (1971) 3 AER 344, the defendant merely watched while fellow soldiers raped a woman in their barracks in Germany. Counselling or advising must have an effect on the mind of the principal to constitute the necessary encouragement in fact, so Clarkson was found not guilty. No causative link between the counselling and the commission of the full offence is required so long as the offence committed was within the scope of the counselling. In R v Calhaem (1985) 2 AER 266, the defendant paid a private detective to murder a woman and was charged with counselling or procuring the murder. It was held that the offence committed must be within the scope of the counselling, i.e., the principal does not deliberately depart from the plan. The detective merely intended to frighten the woman but hit her with a hammer. If, however, the accessory is sufficiently vague as to committing of crime the accessory will not face liability. * \\"To procure\\" means \\"to produce by endeavour, by setting out to see that it happens and taking the appropriate steps to produce that happening\\". The principal can be entirely \\"innocent\\" of the procurer's acts so long as there is proof of a causal link between the procuring and the commission of the offence by the principal offender, e.g., as in AG‚Äôs Reference (No 1) (1975) 2 AER 684, spiking a drink procures a drunk-driving offence. Summary offences The Act does not apply to summary offences, but section 44(1) of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 is to the like effect: Repeals Sections 1 to 7 and 9 of this Act were repealed for England and Wales by section 10(2) of, and Part III of Schedule 3 to, the Criminal Law Act 1967. They were repealed for Northern Ireland by section 15(2) of, and Part II of Schedule 2 to, the Criminal Law Act (Northern Ireland) 1967. Section 11 was repealed by the Statute Law Revision Act 1892. See also *R v Betts and Ridley (1930) 22 Cr App R 148, a landmark case which established that an accessory need not be present when the crime is committed to be regarded as such *Aiding and abetting, a very similar law in the United States *, a case in which the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom held that a person could be an accessory to their own murder.

Leg. p. 122 The part of Hestiaeotis inhabited by them was frequently called Perrhaebia, but it never formed a separate Thessalian province. The Perrhaebi are said at one time to have extended south of the Peneius as far as the Lake Boebeis, but to have been driven out of this district by the mythical race of the Lapithae. It is probable that at an early period the Perrhaebi occupied the whole of Hestiaeotis, but were subsequently driven out of the plain and confined to the mountains by the Thessalian conquerors from Thesprotia. Strabo also writes that in earlier times Histiaeotis was called Doris, \\"but when the Perrhaebians took possession of it, who had already subdued Histiaea in Euboea and had forced its inhabitants to migrate to the mainland, they called the country Histiaeotis after these Histiaeans, because of the large number of these people who settled there\\"; but this is an uncertified statement, probably founded alone upon similarity of name. Homer mentions another ancient tribe in this part of Thessaly called the Aethices, who are placed by Strabo upon the Thessalian side of Pindus near the sources of the Peneius. They are described as a barbarous tribe, living by plunder and robbery. Strabo adds that Histiaeotis and Dolopia comprise Upper Thessaly, which is in a straight line with Upper Macedonia, as is Lower Thessaly with Lower Macedonia. The towns of Hestiaeotis were: Aeginium, Azorus, Cyretiae, Doliche, Elone, Ericinium, Eritium, Gomphi, Ithome, Limnaea, Malloea, Meliboea, Metropolis, Mylae, Oechalia, Oloosson, Oxyneia, Pelinnaeum, Phacium, Phaestus, Phaloria, Pharcadon, Pheca or Phecadum, Pialia, Pythium, Silana, and Tricca; and subsequently, Atrax, Charax, Condylon, Eudieru, Gonnus or Gonni, Lapathus, Leimone, Orthe, Phalanna. Notable sanctuaries of the region were of Asclepius at Tricca, of Aphrodite Kastnia at Metropolis and of Zeus at Pelinna.

Hedegaard was a right-handed batsman who bowled right-arm fast- medium. He was born at Nyk√∏bing Mors, Viborg County. He is more commonly known as Morten Hedegaard. Career Hedegaard made his debut for Denmark against the Netherlands in 1991. Later that year he played for Denmark Under-19s, playing two matches against Bermuda Under-19s and Ireland Under-19s. In that same year, he toured England with Denmark, playing a single match against Durham (then still a minor county). In 1992, he made two appearances against Wales, while the following season he played two matches against the Netherlands. Further appearances came in 1994 and 1995, before he appeared in the 1996 European Cricket Championship, held in Denmark, with Hedegaard making four appearances in it. In 1997, he played in his first ICC Trophy, appearing in its sixth edition in Malaysia, with him making nine appearances during the tournament. He scored 122 runs at an average of 20.33, with a high score of 52 not out against Argentina. With the ball, he took 9 wickets at a bowling average of 13.44, including a five wicket haul against Malaysia, when he took figures of 5/19 from ten overs. He toured Namibia in 1998, making five appearances on the tour, before appearing later that year in the European Cricket Championship in the Netherlands, making five appearances in that tournament. This was also the same year he took over as Denmark captain from S√∏ren Henriksen. In March 1999, he toured Zimbabwe with Denmark, making appearances against provincial teams such as Mashonaland, Mashonaland Country Districts and Manicaland. Hedegaard made his List A debut for Denmark later in 1999 against the Kent Cricket Board in English domestic crickets NatWest Trophy, with him captaining Denmark in what was their first appearance in List A cricket. In 2000, he appeared in the ICC Emerging Nations Tournament in Zimbabwe, where he made a further five List A appearances against Zimbabwe A, the Netherlands, Scotland, Ireland and Kenya. Hedegaard struggled with the bat in the tournament, scoring just 23 runs at an average of 5.75, while with the ball he took 5 wickets at an average of 28.60. He captained Denmark in the 2001 ICC Trophy in Canada, making eight appearances, in what was to be his last appearance in the ICC Trophy. He scored 122 at an average of 17.42 during the tournament, with a high score of 55 coming against Bermuda. Though he missed a List A match in the 2002 Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy, he did return to captain Denmark in the 2002 European Championship in Northern Ireland, making five appearances. He relinquished the captaincy following the tournament, with Soren Vestergaard succeeding him. He returned to the Danish squad five years later during their tour to Kenya, playing matches against a Coast Cricket Association XI, a Kenya Select XI and Kenya A. In November 2007, he was selected in Denmark's squad for the World Cricket League Division Two in Namibia, where he made six List A appearances. He scored 61 runs at an average of 12.20 in the tournament. He later played in the 2008 European Championship Division One, making four appearances, before being selected in Denmark's fifteen man squad for the 2009 World Cup Qualifier in South Africa. Hedegaard made five List A appearances during the tournament, the last of which came against Uganda. He scored 40 runs at an average of 10.00 during the tournament, while with the ball he took 3 wickets at an expensive average of 59.00. Denmark finished the tournament in twelfth and last place, therefore failing to qualify for the 2011 World Cup. This tournament also marked his final List A appearances. Having played a total of seventeen matches in that format for his country, Hedegaard took 11 wickets at an average of 40.63, with best figures of 3/42. With the bat, he scored 129 runs at an average of 9.21, with a high score of 24 not out. This tournament also marked his final appearance for Denmark in any format. His brother, Lars, has also played for Denmark.

It was established in 1998 and is part of the San Guillermo Biosphere Reserve. Elevations in the biosphere range from to . Vegetation in the National Park and biosphere consists of barren desert, grasslands, and a few wetlands, all located in the high, arid Andes. The animals include vicu√±a, guanaco, culpeo fox, Andean mountain cat, cougar, and Andean condor. The park The San Guillermo National Park is located in the northern part of San Juan Province, Argentina near the town of Rodeo. The park was established on January 13, 1999. It has an area of 166,000 hectares in the high Andes, and includes puna grassland and mountain summits. It was originally set up as a provincial reserve in 1972 and became the San Guillermo Biosphere Reserve in 1980. Its main objective is to preserve the natural habitat of vicu√±as, and at the same time protect the other plants and animals of this mountain area. Ecology The biosphere has an area of . The core area is the National Park and consists of arid mountain ranges with no permanent water courses. The soils are mostly rocky and coarse, but some areas with favorable conditions, mostly above , support steppe grassland. The flora consists of scattered dwarf shrubs, interspersed with coarse grasses and herbaceous plants, and much bare ground. The shrubs include Adesmia, Patrastrephia, Fabiana, Azorella and Ephedra. Grasses present include Stipa, Calamagrostis and Festuca and flowering plants include Astragalus, Tropaeolum, Phacelia and Glandularia. The main reason for setting up the biosphere reserve was to protect vicu√±as. Also present in the reserve are the guanaco, the culpeo fox, the Andean mountain cat, the cougar, the southern viscacha, the short-tailed chinchilla, the Darwin's rhea, various ducks and geese, and the Andean condor. Research A research project involves fitting cougars, the top predator in the park, with GPS radio collars and tracking their movements. Simultaneously vicu√±as, one of their main prey animals, are being fitted with collars to monitor their behaviour. It has been found that in areas of the park with plenty of cover, such as canyons and wetlands, the vicu√±as are much more alert to danger and consequently spend less time feeding than they do on open plains. This alters the composition of the plant species present with a resulting increase in invertebrates and in biodiversity. There are plans to fit some condors with collars to find out to what extent they benefit from an increase in the frequency of vicu√±a kills.

It originally aired on November 9, 2009. Plot Future Ted explains the gang's apprehension as Barney and Robin entered the later months of their relationship. Barney gives Ted all of his porn. Marshall can tell Barney is serious about Robin since he has developed \\"relationship gut\\" ‚Äì weight put on when in a stable relationship from eating so much food. While trying to dispose of the porn after Marshall and Lily leave, Ted ends up watching a movie called \\"Archisexture\\", but the movie is suddenly overlapped by a message from Barney. The message assumes Barney is either dead or in a committed relationship, which he tells Ted to save him from. After showing the tape to Lily and Marshall, Ted starts to agree with the past Barney. Barney and Robin now have a declining attitude towards each other and their relationship, with Barney becoming morbidly obese and lethargic, and while Robin becomes haggard and snaps at him unreasonably (although Future Ted admits he is exaggerating and that they only let themselves go a little). Lily and Marshall just think the couple is going through a rough patch, and convince Ted not to interfere. At MacLaren's, Marshall watches Barney eat an entire plate of ribs and asks him directly if he is happy. Not giving a proper answer, Barney describes his relationship in a depressing manner, convincing Marshall that he is unhappy. He and Ted ask Lily to help break up Barney and Robin, given her experience in plotting breakups. Since Lily has reformed her ways, Ted plans a repeat of what broke up his relationship with Robin, involving champagne and a wedding ring. Much to their surprise, the plan results in the couple mutually surrendering to the idea of matrimony, and after they announce it in the bar, Lily agrees to break them up properly. Lily has a plan to remind the couple of their four biggest arguments: dirty dishes, Barney's ex-girlfriends, Stormtroopers, and a Canadian-American war. She contacts Robin's friend, Alan Thicke, to meet the couple at their usual diner, along with one of Barney's insane one-night stands, Meg (April Bowlby), a passing actor dressed as a Stormtrooper, and a busboy carrying dirty dishes. The gang stakes out the location in a rented station wagon. Marshall is annoyed at Ted for being too cheap to rent a proper stake-out van, Thicke and Meg arrive and apparently know each other, and Lily was unable to find a Stormtrooper and instead finds a man dressed as the robot from Lost in Space, as she thinks Stormtroopers are also robots. As they argue over the station wagon and a pizza delivery, Barney and Robin look right in their direction. Ted and Marshall think their cover is blown, but Lily executes the plan anyway. As the plan unfolds, they notice that neither Barney nor Robin are angry or arguing, and they kiss each other before leaving the diner. In MacLaren's the gang share a beer with Thicke and the pizza delivery boy, and Robin stops by and explains that she and Barney have broken up. What the gang thought was Robin and Barney looking at them was really the couple aghast at their own reflections. The realization makes them examine their relationship and they agree that \\"two awesomes cancel each other out\\", making them less than they want to be, so they break up. Barney laments that they will not be able to go back to being friends, but Robin tells him not think of it as a break-up but as getting back together as friends. They quickly avoid all of Lily's traps and kiss each other goodbye. Although Robin says it might take Barney a while to recover from the breakup, he appears as his old self, catching enticing glances from most of the women in the bar and declaring \\"Daddy's home\\". Before he leaves, Thicke reveals that he and Robin starred in a short-lived Canadian variety show. Barney runs off to find the footage. Critical response Reviewer Scott Tobias from The A.V. Club though skeptical of fat suits for what he describes as the Norbit Rule but felt it was worth it thanks to the \\"I'm my own wingman tonight\\" quip, and thought everything Alan Thicke related was funny. He is disappointed to see the show retreat back to where it was before but accepts Barney and Robin are not same characters unless independent. He gives the episode a rating of A‚àí describing it as a near-classic. Brian Zoromski of IGN gave the episode 7.8 out of 10. Joel Keller of TV Squad notes this episode makes particularly effective use of Future Ted (Bob Saget) and the exaggerations and distortions he lends to the story, from fat Barney and haggard Robin, to the video flying magically into the player. Eric Hochberger of TV Critic really enjoyed the ArchiSEXture idea.

It was established on December 10, 1991, to protect the natural features, representative of the Semiarid Chaco and the Argentine Low Monte ecoregions. Climate In San Luis, the ecotone between the mountains and the Chaco is located west of the 400 mm isohyet and covers about 800,000 ha. The climate of the area is semi- arid and is characterized by sharp temperature variations, both seasonal and daily. The average annual maximum temperature is 24.4 ¬∞C, while the minimum is 10.7 ¬∞C. The annual average temperature is 13.7 ¬∞C. The maximum monthly average temperature is 31 ¬∞C and for the month of January; the minimum is 3.1 ¬∞C for the month of July. The average value of relative humidity varies between 48% in August‚ÄìSeptember to 64% in April‚ÄìJune; the annual average is 55%. Precipitation is scarce and unevenly distributed throughout the year. There are two seasons: dry during winter and wet from late spring to early autumn. Geology Sierra de las Quijadas is located in the San Luis Basin, whose surface is composed of sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous outcrops of various ages. The basin is bounded by the Sierra de San Luis to the east, while to the west the basin is presumed to be subsurficially connected to the Triassic basins of the Mendoza and San Juan provinces. To the north, the basin extends to Marayes de San Juan. It is an anticlinal structure, of roughly elliptical shape whose major axis is oriented meridionally. A large fracture extends in the north-south direction, subparallel to the current course of the Desaguadero River. Along this fracture, the Quijadas range has been lifted. Geologic origin The geologic origin of the Quijadas is composed of three stages: infill, uplift and erosion. 120 mya, the present location of the Quijadas was occupied by a sedimentary basin, flanked by two highlands. One of them is the Sierras de San Luis. Another is a range that had existed along the current course of the Desaguadero River. The basins began to be filled with fluvial and aeolian sediments, eroded from the highlands. The process lasted some 20 Ma, which resulted in the basin being completely filled 100 mya. The following 75 Ma are missing from the geologic record and are assumed to be a period of calm. During the Tertiary, the layers that had been deposited 120‚Äì100 mya were raised and folded by the tectonic processes associated with the formation of Sierras Pampeanas. The uplift began 25 mya, and the Quijadas still rise, as the South American Plate continues its westward migration. Concurrently with the uplift, erosion became a major factor, which created the modern valleys and ravines, such as the Potrero de la Aguada valley. Geologic formations Within the park's boundaries, five geologic formations of Lower Cretaceous age, as well as one of Tertiary, have been identified. The Cretaceous layers relate to the 20 Ma basin infilling stage, which accumulated more than 1000 m of sediments. Subsequent uplift, folding and erosion allowed these formations to be currently exposed at the surface. El Jume Formation is the oldest of the sequence, having been formed 120 mya. It outcrops in the Potrero de la Aguada valley. Some 300 m thick, its depositional environments varied from fluvial to aeolian to lacustrine. Lithologically, the formation is composed of alternating layers of red sandstone and claystone. El Toscal and La Cruz formations are widely distributed within the Quijadas. Deposited 110 mya, the formations contribute to the bulk of the area's relief, formin reddish, whitish and gray cliffs and gorges. The rocks originate in the high-energy fluvial environments, associated with rivers that once flowed from the ancient Sierra del Desaguadero mountains. La Cruz formation contains a layer of basaltic lava, which erupted 109.4‚Äì107.4 mya. The formations are made up of layers of conglomerate, sandstone, claystone and gypsum and are partly covered by modern fill. Lagarcito Formation, deposited around 100 mya, is found at the eastern slopes of the mountains, gradually diving into the surrounding plain. The formation is dominated by claystones, with some sandstones, that were deposited into a system of interconnected lakes. The San Roque is the most recent formation, deposited 25 mya. Together with the Lagarcito Formation, it forms a series of low rising hills throughout the park. It consists of layers of conglomerate, sandstone, claystone and gypsum, partly covered with modern fill. Undifferentiated Quaternary deposits consist of rocks as well as sediments. The latter are mainly fluvial sands and aeolian silts, typical of the Pampeano loess. The age of these layers does not exceed 1 Ma. The youngest deposits (Pleistocene‚ÄìHolocene) are found in the flood plains and in the Lagunas de Guanacache wetlands. They are alluvial and lacustrine in origin, with some salt flats as well. Paleontology Cast of a P. guinazui specimen discovered in the park at the Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales in Caballito, Buenos Aires, Argentina. During the 1960s‚Äì1970s, remains of Pterodaustro guinazui were discovered for the first time in the Lagarcito Formation by Jos√© Bonaparte. Since then, the fossil site, named Loma del Pterodaustro during the 1990s, has been extensively quarried, providing abundant fossil plant and animal remains, mainly pterosaurs; due to the fine preservation of delicate structures, the site has been classified as a Konservat-Lagerst√§tte. Hydrography The park has a very pronounced drainage network, generated by stormwater runoff affecting the area, so the surface rocks are very susceptible to erosion. However, all streams are ephemeral, carrying water only during the wet season. The Potrero de la Aguada valley is a special case, as it concentrates rainwater in an enclosed structure and discharges it via a single outlet, Arroyo de la Aguada, which empties into the Desaguadero River. The Lagunas de Guanacache is historically one of the largest wetlands in the Cuyo; it's located on the border of the provinces of Mendoza, San Juan and San Luis, approximately 80 km northeast of the city of Mendoza. The system was part of a larger wetland complex, fed by the Mendoza and San Juan rivers, which included lakes La Balsita, Grande, Del Toro, Silverio, Del Rosario, El Porvenir, among others. These marsh waters discharged into the Desaguadero River, contributing to its perennial flow. The complex can be divided into three sectors. Topography The variation of elevation is mainly between 500 and 900 mamsl. The Desaguadero River valley is below 500 m, while some peaks are above 900 m: Cerro El Portillo and Cerro El Lindo are below 1090 m, Cerro Los Viejos is 920 m Cerros de la Aguada and Cerros de la Vidriera approach 850 m. The whole area is divided into 6 physiographic units: the Desaguadero River flood plain, the Arroyo de la Aguada circular valley, steppe, foothills, and slopes and summits. The shaping of the landscape in the region is mainly due to the erosion caused by water from occasional rains and erosion by wind. Biodiversity Sierra de las Quijadas is the only protected area in the Chaco ‚Äì Monte ecotone, preserving flora and fauna of the San Luis Province. Flora Within the park, 416 species have been identified, including 17 that are introduced, of which the French tamarisk is the most prominent, forming dense stands along the stream banks. Two species, Senecio hualtaranensis and Atriplex quixadensis are endemic to the park. Fauna The location of the national park in the Chaco ‚Äì Monte ecotones entails the presence of representative species of both biomes. Chaco species such as the gray brocket, Chacoan mara, blue-crowned parakeet and Argentine boa coexist with characteristic species of the Monte, such as the pink fairy armadillo, sandy gallito and Darwin's tree iguana, among others. About 270 vertebrate species are found in the park, including 4 introduced.

When the Spaniards arrived in the sixteenth century, the Comechingones inhabited the region.  Description  Although located near the city of Cordoba and tourist towns like Villa Carlos Paz, Alta Gracia, Tanti, Mina Clavero, etc., the territory of the park has remained scenically pristine due to its inaccessibility. Extensive ranching, however, has been practiced since colonial times, resulting in intense erosion to the vegetation cover due to cattle trampling on the sandy, steep-sloped soil.

During the winter (May to early August), snowfall is rather common. Another characteristic phenomenon is the frequent lightning strikes at the higher elevations. There are hiking trails and bike paths of different lengths and degrees of difficulty, most of them signaled. There are several areas of rough camping (no services) with access to drinking water.

Quebrada del Condorito lies within the high altitude of the top floor of the Sierras Grandes, which contrasts with the great Pampas' lower plains that surround them. This gives the region characteristics of a biological island, which, depending on climatic variations, is enriched by intermittent flows of Andean and Patagonian wildlife colonization. As a result, the area has a great diversity of endemic species and subspecies, both plants and animals. The park is an important site for Andean condors watching (the species had undergone a marked population decline during the twentieth century), for which the easternmost distribution is found in this region. Recently developed policies for condor protection, active caring and reintroduction into wildlife have led to a steep recovery of populations where they had been almost extinguished a few years ago.

It is one of the few glaciers left in the tropical areas of South America. Description The glacier is around in size, and around long with a terrestrial snout ending. The glacier is currently retreating quickly. It has lost 22% of its size and 15.5% of its ice mass in the last 30‚Äì35 years. The glacier occupies an Andean peak around 5,250 metres (17,200 feet) above sea level, and so has steep, cliff like edges, with heavily crevassed areas characteristic of a cirque glacier. The area and the glacier is usually covered in soft snow and is a popular area with tourists, snowboarders and ice climbers. Maintenance Engineer Benjamin Morales Arnao, local glaciologist, has tested a method to reverse the thaw; cover the ice with a layer of sawdust 15 cm thick. The experiment was carried out on Mount Chaupijanca and Pastoruri. The first glacier managed to keep four meters of ice and the second kept five meters. \\"This material acts as an insulator. It contains cellulose and thus we managed to decrease the melting glacier. Although this method has worked well, we'll be testing other alternatives\\", said Morales. \\"Those experiments curb glacial retreat on a small scale, but cannot bring ice blocks like Pastoruri back from the brink,\\" said Selwyn Valverde with the Huascaran National Park, home to Pastoruri and more than 700 other shrinking Peruvian glaciers. \\"It's irreversible at this point,\\" he said, adding that Pastoruri is no longer technically a glacier because it does not build up ice in the winter to release in the summer. \\"It's just loss, loss, loss now.

The worship of San Baltasar is considered a para-liturgical cult, known as the Brotherhood of San Baltazar, since the Catholic Church has not canonized nor recognized Baltasar as a saint. San Baltasar appears as a crowned black man wearing a red robe or cloak and carrying a scepter or a staff. San Baltasar's feast day is 6 January, when devotees dance and play music in his honor, most commonly candombe. In Concepcion, Tucuman, Argentina, there are activities such as religious worship and musical entertainment offerings. This place called the South Island of San Baltasar, is an architectural ensemble consisting of the church with the image of the saint. He is the unofficial patron saint of Fernando de la Mora, a town in Paraguay.

Established on 20 October 2004, it houses a representative sample of the steppe and Patagonian coast biodiversity in good state of conservation, as well as several paleontological sites of high value. It runs along of the southern Argentine Sea coastline.  History  About 10,000‚Äì13,000 years ago, hunter-gatherer groups took advantage of the area's varied coastal environment, full of food resources. The Tehuelche people, descendants of the first settlers, expanded land use, developing a greater exchange with other, farther away groups. The arrival of the first European settlers triggered major changes in the original populations: the gradual increase of product exchange dependency and loss of territory caused migrations towards the west of the province and the incorporation of the original settlers into rural tasks. In early 1876, during the presidency of Nicol√°s Avellaneda and because of increasing tension regarding neighboring Chile's expansion attempts over Argentine Patagonia, Buenos Aires started issuing authorizations for the exploitation of guano in the zone south of the Santa Cruz River, where 17 years earlier the Argentine commander Luis Piedrabuena had established an outpost. In April the governor of Punta Arenas, Diego Dubl√© Almeyda, sent the gunboat Magallanes with orders of sinking any Argentine vessels in the area. The French boat Jeanne-Amelie, authorized by Avellaneda's administration, was boarded and its crew imprisoned by the Chilean forces, an incident that worsened the bilateral relationship. Two years later Chile once again seized a vessel in Monte Le√≥n: this time it was the United States' ship Devonshire, and the action put both countries at the verge of war. Francisco P. Moreno, naturalist and creator of the Argentine National Park System, and the paleontologist Carlos Ameghino explored the area in the late 19th century. The Italian missionary Alberto Mar√≠a De Agostini also visited it in the early 20th century. The Estancia Monte Le√≥n belonged to the Southern Patagonia Sheep Farming Company Limited, which exploited it as a sheep farm. It was sold in 1920 to the Braun family, who continued this business until 2006. The extraction of guano was profitable until 1930. In 1996 it was proposed to include Monte Le√≥n in the National Park System of Argentina. Francisco Erize, former director of the Argentine National Parks Administration, recommended the project to Douglas Tompkins, a billionaire businessman and environmentalist, director of The Conservation Land Trust, a conservationist NGO. In 2000, through the NGO Conservaci√≥n Patag√≥nica, directed by Tompkins wife, Kristine Tompkins, the farm land was acquired and transferred by land trust to Fundaci√≥n Vida Silvestre Argentina, demanding it to be donated to the National Parks National Administration, a process finished in 2002. Finally, on 20 October 2004 the law creating the new national park was sanctioned by Congress, making Monte Le√≥n the first continental marine park of Argentina.  Description  Monte Le√≥n consists of high sandstone cliffs, rock formations, islands, wide beaches interrupted by narrow bays, and sandbars that are uncovered in low tide. The park's coastal sector represents about 1% of the Argentine mainland shoreline.

Temperatures during the winter months can fall below while they can exceed during summer. The park averages of rainfall per year, which is concentrated in fall and winter. Average annual wind speeds range between although the park can experience gusts up to .  Biodiversity  The park is home to large colonies of Magellanic penguins. The Patagonian steppe, while barren at first glance, is inhabited by a considerable variety of plants. In 1880, Carlos Spegazzini, the founder of botany in Argentina, identified several hitherto unknown grass species when researching the area as part of a scientific expedition financed by Italy. Aboriginal people used calafate resin as a sort of chewing gum, a custom that chroniclers linked to the good health and cleanliness of their dentures. The wild thyme is widely used in the local cuisine. Several other plant species found in the park also have medicinal uses. As is usual for desert climates, harsh winters are often followed by spectacular blooms of colorful flowers. Monte Le√≥n is also home to about twenty species of coastal and marine birds: several varieties of penguins (including the Magellanic penguin, of which the park holds Argentina's fourth- largest colony, with about 60,000 individuals), three species of cormorants (the red-legged cormorant, the rock shag and the imperial shag), and large, flightless birds known as √±and√∫s (rheas). Very large populations of fish roam the cold sea waters. The park is also home to several large mammals, including sea lions (forming populous colonies), southern right whales, pumas and roaming herds of guanacos.

The tracks were originally written and recorded at Seal's home studio in Los Angeles in 1999. Songwriters Guy Gershoni and Dave Palmer were brought in at two-week intervals for eight months of intensive collaboration efforts. The outcome of these writing sessions were experimental, edgy, underground club tracks reflective of Seal's early career and roots. Such a divergence from the Seal brand today, that there was discussion about releasing the tracks under a pseudo-name, as not to disrupt or confuse Seal's established fan base. Henry Jackman was contracted to produce and help create a mainstream sounding album, before it was presented to the label. These are the versions that are sampled online. Contrary to various reports, Warner Bros. Records turned down the album due to their dissatisfaction with the final record. Seal decided to record and release Seal IV in its place. He then put Togetherland into a \\"vault\\", where the album has remained since. Over the years, fans have been able to listen to 30-second clips as well as streamed, full versions of some of the album's songs, to which many of those songs received high praise.
