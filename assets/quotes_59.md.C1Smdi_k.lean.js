Beerbohm wrote this satire on Oscar Wilde in late 1893 or early 1894 for publication in the first number of The Yellow Book, but it was held over to make way for Beerbohm's essay A Defence of Cosmetics, which appeared in that journal in April 1894. The essay was possibly withheld because of the impending Wilde scandal. A Peep into the Past was never published in The Yellow Book. In 1894 Wilde was at the height of his fame. In A Peep into the Past Beerbohm portrays Wilde as a staid old gentleman with a somewhat suspicious procession of page-boys passing backwards and forwards through his neighbourhood in Chelsea: \\"Once a welcome guest in many of our Bohemian haunts, he lives a life of quiet retirement in his little house in Tite Street with his wife and two sons, his prop and mainstay, solacing himself with many a reminiscence of the friends of his youth\\"... \\"The old gentleman\\" (Wilde was 39) continues to write; indeed, he \\"has not yet abandoned his old intention of dramatising Salome...\\" Beerbohm, Max A Peep into the Past Privately Printed (New York) (1923) A cutting commentary on Wilde's club life, Beerbohm writes, \\"He never nowadays even looks at the morning papers, so wholly has he cut himself off from the society, though he still goes on taking the Athenaeum, in the hopes that it may even now do the same to him.\\" In 1894 The Athenaeum was London's premier club for eminent men of letters and science. Its membership was made up of the greatest British writers in the nineteenth century. Wilde's name is a conspicuous absence.'Wilde and the Club' New York University Libraries Printed privately in 1923 in a limited edition of 300 copies on Japan Vellum, A Peep into the Past was published in a glassine wrapper with a card slipcase and box.

The first runway was built in 1934. In 1942, during World War II, the runway was extended and a passenger terminal was built by the United States Army Air Forces Air Transport Command under the Airport Development Program. It provided technical support for the Natal-Dakar air route, which provided a transoceanic link between Brazil and French West Africa for cargo, transiting aircraft and personnel. The airport was transferred to the jurisdiction of the United States Navy on 5 September 1944. After the end of the war, the administration of the airport was transferred back to the Brazilian Government. In 1975 another extension of the runway was made, allowing the operations of aircraft up to the class of a Boeing 737. In March 1999, the present passenger terminal was opened for service. Following the disappearance of Air France Flight 447 on June 1, 2009, the airport became a base for search and rescue operations.

It is located in the southern end of Mill Creek Hundred. History Prior to the arrival of European settlers, the area around Stanton was frequented by Native American peoples. A paleo-Indian archaeology site, referred to as the Clyde Farm site, is located southwest of the area. Stanton is located near the Piedmont Fall Line along the banks of Red Clay Creek. First settled around 1679, it was the first settlement in Mill Creek Hundred. Many small watermills dotted the area and a farm road from Chester County, Pennsylvania terminated on the banks of Red Clay Creek. The village was originally known as \\"Cuckoldstown\\", perhaps for an inn that allegedly served as a meeting place for illicit rendezvous. The village was renamed after Stephen Stanton, a prominent landowner in the village. In August 1777, George Washington erected fortifications in the area, expecting to confront British troops recently landed at Head of Elk, Maryland. Washington and his staff held a war council in the Hale-Byrnes House. The expected battle did not develop, though, as General Howe moved his army north towards Chester County, Pennsylvania.The Hale-Byrnes House, where George Washington met with his officers prior to The Battle of Brandywine St. James Church was established in 1720 and the first public school in the area opened near the church in 1808. The Kiamensi Woolen Mills operated on the banks of the Red Clay Creek at several locations in the area. The mill provided blankets and other material for the Union Army during the American Civil War and operated until the early 1900s. The Hale-Byrnes House and St. James Episcopal Church are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

It is sometimes called \\"The Ballad of Seth Davy\\". The song laments the death in 1902 of a performer, Seth Davy, who sang and performed with a set of \\"dancing dolls\\" outside a public house in Liverpool. The dolls were attached to the end of a plank, and when the plank was struck and vibrated, this caused the dolls to \\"dance\\". Seth Davy was in fact a Jamaican who performed outside the Bevington Bush Hotel around the turn of the century. It was located just north of Liverpool City Centre. The original song contains lyrics and idiom specific to Liverpool. In an Irish version, the first-line mention of Bevington Bush appears as Beggars Bush, referring to a location in Dublin. Other versions refer erroneously to Bebington, which is a township in Wirral, on the other side of the River Mersey. Recordings The Irish folk singer Danny Doyle covered the song in 1968 and it remained at No. 1 in the Irish charts for ten weeks. The same year, The Irish Rovers recording of the song climbed the Billboard charts in the US where it remained for eight weeks, and #34 in Canada.

He was found guilty in 2002 of criminal negligence causing death and sentenced to a conditional sentence of two years less a day. A removal order was issued for him to return to India. Judicial History Khosa appealed the order to the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) of the Immigration and Refugee Board. The majority of the IAD denied Khosa \\"special relief\\" on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. On appeal, the Federal Court reviewed the assessment of the IAD and found it to be reasonable. That decision was then appealed to the Federal Court of Appeal which then found that the decision had not been reasonable when they denied relief and set the decision aside. Opinion of the court Binnie J. wrote for the majority, who found that s. 18.1 of the Federal Courts Act set out the threshold grounds which permit but do not require the court to grant relief when conducting judicial review. Binnie J. held that \\"whether or not the court should exercise its discretion in favour of the application will depend on the court's appreciation of the respective roles of the courts and the administration as well as the \\"circumstances in each case\\".2009 SCC 12 at para 31. Applying the reasonableness standard from Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick, Binnie J. held that courts should be deferential to the IAD decisions and should not substitute its own findings. In the result, he found that the IAD decision was reasonable and restored its order. Dissenting opinion Fish J. dissented, agreeing with the Court of Appeal that the decision was unreasonable on account of the IAD's emphasis on the specific fact that Khosa denied having engaged in street-racing,Ibid at para 147. and would have granted a re-hearing in the IAD, concluding, \\"I agree that decisions of the IAD are entitled to deference. In my respectful view, however, deference ends where unreasonableness begins.\\"Ibid at para 160. See also * Suresh v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2002 SCC 1 * Ahani v.

Life and career Westarp was born in Ludom (present-day Ludomy, Poland) in the Prussian Province of Posen, the son of a senior forestry official. He attended the Gymnasium secondary school in Potsdam and studied jurisprudence at the universities of T√ºbingen, Breslau, Leipzig, and Berlin, passed the Staatsexamen in 1886 and did his military service in Breslau and Potsdam, where he was elevated to a reserve officer of the 1st Foot Guard regiment. In 1887 he began his career in civil service at the administrative district (Landkreis) office in Freienwalde, Brandenburg whose head was Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg, the later Chancellor of Germany. After his second Staatsexamen in 1891 Westarp continued his career as an assessor in Gostyn and Bomst in Posen, and in Stettin. He joined the service of the Prussian State Ministry in 1902 and became Chief of Police in the Sch√∂neberg and Wilmersdorf suburbs of Berlin, before in 1908 he was appointed a senior judge at the Prussian administrative court. Westarp had joined the German Agrarian League in the 1890s, his political advancement began in 1908 as a member of the German Reichstag parliament as a member of the German Conservative Party, from 1913 to 1918 as head of the parliamentary group. During World War I, he agitated against the 1917 Reichstag Peace Resolution, advocated the unrestricted submarine warfare and rejected the reform of the Prussian three-class franchise initiated by Chancellor Bethmann-Hollweg. Kuno von Westarp (centre), July 1928 After the German Revolution of 1918‚Äì19, Westarp became one of the founding members of the German National People's Party (DNVP). From 1919 he worked as an editor of the conservative Kreuzzeitung newspaper whose shareholder he became in 1925. While his career in civil service ended with his retirement in 1920, he was again elected into the Reichstag parliament of the Weimar Republic. Initially an exponent of the far-right, anti-democratic forces within his party, he was involved in the preparations of the failed Kapp Putsch, however, he adopted more centrist positions in the mid-1920s, rising to become head of the DNVP parliamentary group and party chairman in 1926. In 1925 the DNVP had temporarily abandoned its anti-republican attitude by joining the German cabinet in a liberal- conservative coalition government under Chancellor Hans Luther. However, in the 1928 federal election, the party suffered a disastrous defeat and had to accept the formation of Social Democratic government under Chancellor Hermann M√ºller. Westarp resigned as chairman; when in 1930 his support for the government of Heinrich Br√ºning did not meet with the approval of his party, and because of the anti-republican tendencies of his successor Alfred Hugenberg which became manifest during the 1929 referendum, he finally left the DNVP in 1930. In the same year he and Gottfried Treviranus were among the founders of the moderate Conservative People's Party (KVP), with which he sat in the Reichstag until 1932. Westarp did not stand for another seat in the 1932 federal election whose outcome was a triumph of the rising Nazi Party. Upon the 1933 Machtergreifung he retired into private life. Suspected by the Nazi authorities to be involved in the 20 July plot, preliminary investigations against him furnished no proof. At the end of World War II, he was temporarily arrested by Soviet occupation forces in Berlin but soon released and died shortly afterwards.

Early life Fitzpatrick was born in Maine and raised in California to a French mother and American-Irish father. He attended The Dunn School, a co-ed boarding school in Los Olivos, California and began his entrepreneurial career there, giving haircuts, selling vintage clothing and keeping two Coca-Cola vending machines on campus. He attended Bennington College in Vermont, where he majored in Sculpture and Lighting Design. Characters in both Bret Easton Ellis Rules of Attraction and The Secret History by Donna Tartt are based on Fitzpatrick. Career In the early '90s, Fitzpatrick launched a lighting company called Double Happiness that provided lighting equipment and other related services to Los Angeles-area rock clubs, venues, raves and private events. At the same time, he was pursuing a Masters Degree in Theater Design at California Institute of the Arts. He learned Lighting Design for Modern Dance there, and made conceptual art films and designed lights for everything from operas in Paris to touring African dance troupes. Fitzpatrick also worked as a lighting designer for well-known Los Angeles promoters Brent Bolthouse and Mike Messex. While pursuing his master's degree, Fitzpatrick began making hand-screened, politically themed T-shirts in his Hollywood backyard. From those, he launched first fashion brand, Pleasure Swell, in 1993.https://articles.latimes.com/1998/feb/26/news/ls-22981 His punk rock meets-surfer aesthetic defined the brand. The line also re-imagined the concept of Americana kitsch, turning men's Adidas polo shirts into women's dresses and making fashion-forward versions of classic 1950s and 1960s pieces. Pleasure Swell sold at Fred Segal, Urban Outfitters, dELiA*s and at hundreds of boutiques around the world. He opened his first store, Swell, with money he made by borrowing $90 from his bookkeeper and playing craps for 24 hours straight in Las Vegas,HighBeam and with contributions from several investors. He opened a second store, Ether, in 1994. Hush Puppies In 1995 Fitzpatrick converted half of his retail space into a shop that sold Hush Puppies shoes exclusively. A 25-foot inflatable basset hound - the company's logo - sat atop the building. Pee-Wee Herman (Paul Reuben) bought a few pairs from the shop and word of mouth quickly spread.http://www.businessweek.com/archives/1995/b344195.arc.htm He began flying to the company's headquarters in Rockford, Michigan, working with them to expand their range of designs. When they refused to make women's sizes, Fitzpatrick got them to agree to produce bigger sizes of the narrower child's shoe and in turn sold those to his female clientele. He also developed and sold his own exclusive designs, like glow-in-the-dark Hush Puppies, some made out of Kevlar, and a blue suede pair that tapped into his Americana kitsch vibe. Suddenly Hush Puppies became ubiquitous.HighBeam Joel's celebrity clientele included Sarah Jessica Parker, Ellen DeGeneres, Jeanne Tripplehorn, Anjelica Huston and three of the five 1995 Academy Award nominees for Best Actress: Susan Sarandon, Sharon Stone and Elisabeth Shue. The New York Times compared the brand to Gucci and Tod's.https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/14/style/voting-with-their-famous- feet.html The Council of Fashion Designers of America named Hush Puppies the Top Accessory of 1995. Malcolm Gladwell wrote an article in The New Yorker based on Joel's foresight and success, and secured his first book contract for the best-selling The Tipping Point, on that article. In 1996, Fitzpatrick was nominated for the California Designer of the Year award along with BCBG founder Max Azria, Mossimo founder Mossimo Giannulli and designer Janet Howard.http://www.thefreelibrary.com/DESIGNER+OF+THE+YEAR%27S+FAKE+FUR,+GENUINE+SHOCK.(L.A.+LIFE)-a083970301 Fashion Fitzpatrick opened another Ether shop in 1999 on Prince Street in New York, noted as the first to feature L.E.D. lighting in a retail space,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/10/style/pulse-an-end-to-burnout.html and a Swell store on Lafayette Street. He continued to design clothing and showed two collections at New York Fashion Week in Bryant Park.HighBeam The first was a group show, Girls Rule, which also featured the designs of Tatiana von Furstenburg, Planet Claire and Oliver Dow. The second was sponsored by Hush Puppies and featured dresses made from vintage 1950s men's sweaters with matching suede shoes. In 2000, Fitzpatrick launched an interior/architectural design studio and also began working on Chemistryset, a line of home accessories with a 30-person sales force and five showrooms. In 2006, his show \\"Recreation in Ether\\" was shown at the Forbes headquarters in Manhattan. Fitzpatrick is now focusing on architectural and lighting design in private homes as well as commercial properties. He has designed conceptual lighting for a series of art shows curated by Vladimir Restoin-Roitfeld (son of French Vogue editor-in-chief Carine Roitfeld), including building a temporary gallery at the Fifth Avenue flagship Armani space in Manhattan for artist Richard Hambleton,http://www.refinery29.com/parties/the_roitfelds_armani_hit_the_w_1.php and the former Essex Street meat market in the Lower East Side for Nicolas Pol's first American exhibition.https://www.vanityfair.com/online/style/2009/11/vladimir-restoin- roitfeld-curates-artwork-a-party-crowd.html He is also a licensed real estate salesperson and is currently designing a line of home accessories and custom chandeliers and lighting installations for public and private spaces. Fitzpatrick's name is on a residential townhouse on West 4th Street in the West Village where a dramatic light installation can be seen nightly. The townhouse is currently listed for sale.

St. Petersburg, \\"Nestor History, 2009 - 252 p. . Medical study of birth trauma dates to the 16th century, and the morphological consequences of mishandled delivery are described in Renaissance-era medical literature. Birth injury occupies a unique area of concern and study in the medical canon. In ICD-10 \\"birth trauma\\" occupied 49 individual codes (P10-–†15). However, there are often clear distinctions to be made between brain damage caused by birth trauma and that induced by intrauterine asphyxia. It is also crucial to distinguish between \\"birth trauma\\" and \\"birth injury\\". Birth injuries encompass any systemic damages incurred during delivery (hypoxic, toxic, biochemical, infection factors, etc.), but \\"birth trauma\\" focuses largely on mechanical damage. Caput succedaneum, bruises, bleeding along the displacements of cranial bones, and subcapsular hematomas of the liver are among reported birth injuries. Birth trauma, on the other hand, encompasses the enduring side effects of physical birth injuries, including the ensuing compensatory and adaptive mechanisms and the development of pathological processes (pathogenesis) after the damage. Signs and symptoms Complications from birth trauma can include damage to the head, spinal cord, soft tissues, and organs. Trauma to the head of the infant can manifest as Caput Succedaneum, skull fractures, extracranial and intracranial hemorrhages, and cranial nerve injuries. Caput Succeedaneum is seen as edema in the scalp due to squeezing of the veins from increase pressure while passing through the birth canal.

Mansfelds were archbishops, generals, supporters as well as opponents of Martin Luther, and Habsburg administrators. History Mansfeld in 1650 Mansfeld Castle Upon the revolt instigated by the Wettin margrave Dedi I in 1069, Emperor Henry IV appointed the loyal House of Mansfeld counts (Grafen) in the Saxon Hassegau at Eisleben. The family progenitor, Count Hoyer I of Mansfeld, also known as Hoyer the Great, was a field marshal in the service of Emperor Henry V. He was killed at the Battle of Welfesholz on 11 February 1115, fighting the rebellious Saxon forces under Count Lothair of Supplinburg. The Mansfelds held extended fiefs both in the Archbishopric of Magdeburg and the Bishopric of Halberstadt. The male line became extinct for the first time upon the death of Count Burchard of Mansfeld in 1229; his daughter Sophia married a scion of the Lords of Querfurt, who assumed the comital title. In the 15th century, the primary house divided into cadet branches: Hinterort, Mittelort, and Vorderort, while their County of Mansfeld in 1512 joined the Upper Saxon Circle as an immediate Imperial estate. Things worsened with the Protestant Reformation: While Count Hoyer VI of Mansfeld- Vorderort (1477-1540) remained a loyal supporter of the Catholic faith, the Mittelort and Hinterort branches sided with Martin Luther. When the county was devastated during the German Peasants' War, Count Albert VII of Mansfeld- Hinterort (1480-1560) not only fought with the Imperial troops in the 1525 Battle of Frankenhausen, but also signed the Protestant Augsburg Confession in 1530 and joined the Schmalkaldic League, wherefore he was banned by Emperor Charles V after the 1547 Battle of M√ºhlberg. To settle the enormous debts of the Counts of Mansfeld, their mighty neighbour Elector Augustus of Saxony urged Emperor Maximilian II to appoint a committee. On 15 March 1574, and again on 5 July 1574, in Leipzig and Halle, respectively, the surviving counts Hans Hoyer, Hans Georg, Hans Albrecht and Bruno concluded an agreement for the repayment of debts incurred by Counts Peter Ernst I von Mansfeld-Vorderort, Hans Ernst and Bruno von Mansfeld. The family's assets were confiscated in 1579, whereafter Imperial immediacy was lost and mediatized between the Electorate of Saxony and the Archbishopric of Magdeburg. The Mittelort and Hinterort branches died out in 1602 and 1666. The male Mansfeld-Vorderort line finally became extinct in 1780 with the death of Josef Wenzel Nepomuk, Prince of Fondi in Italy, and their fiefs fell back to the Electorate of Saxony and the Prussian Duchy of Magdeburg. Josef Wenzel's half-sister and heiress Maria Isabella was only able to retain the Bohemian possessions. In 1771 she had married Prince Franz de Paula Gundaker von Colloredo (1731‚Äì1807), last Vice Chancellor of the Holy Roman Empire from 1789, thereby establishing the House of Colloredo-Mansfeld, which claimed headship over the family after the German mediatization.

Tinctures The tincture azure (blue) in the field of the shield is symbol of nobility, justice, perseverance, zeal and loyalty; the metal Or (gold) is symbol of glory, splendor, grandness, wealth, sovereignty; the metal argent (silver) is symbol of peace, friendship, labour, prosperity, purity, religiosity. Three fountains The three heraldic fountains argent (silver) reminds in the escutcheon the three mineral water fountains existent in the city, one of them with sulphurous waters, gift of nature that constitutes the main municipal wealth, reason of its autonomy to the progressist evolution, origin of the toponym that the city boasts (\\"√Åguas\\" means \\"Waters\\" in Portuguese).

The news outlet was started in 2003 by Amir Korangy, and focuses on both commercial and residential real estate. The online and print publication was self-proclaimed \\"the must-read news source for real estate news,\\" in a profile in the Los Angeles Times in 2009, and \\"the hot sheet for NYC real estate professionals,\\" by the New York Post. History Amir Korangy of Korangy Publishing founded The Real Deal in April 2003.[1] The magazine was his third venture into publishing, the first being the Gringo Gazette, a weekly newspaper in Baja, Mexico targeted at expatriates,[1] and the second being the Washington Free Press, a weekly tabloid in Washington, D.C. Korangy was named one of the 100 most powerful figures in New York City real estate by the New York Observer in 2009. The magazine's editor-in-chief since its first year is Stuart W. Elliott, who previously worked for The New York Times. The Real Deal launched a South Florida website in February 2008, and a Los Angeles website in 2016. In 2012, The Real Deal made its first foray into filmmaking, with the documentary \\"Building Stories\\", as part of the PBS series \\"Treasures of New York.\\" The film focuses on the prolific architect Costas Kondylis, who has helped shape the New York skyline with 86 towers, but is relatively unknown to the general public. Examining Kondylis' work, which has received mixed reviews, the film looks at the balance between art and commerce in getting a building built in the city, and how the city gets shaped. In 2015, The Real Deal published its first book, \\"The Closing: Interviews with New York City's Titans of Real Estate.\\" Events, publications and awards The Real Deal has hosted annual real estate forums in New York for more than a decade, with some events drawing more than 4,000 people.

The company also publishes an annual Data Book reference guide for real estate professionals, which includes current and historical looks at the city's real estate market, divided into coverage of residential and commercial real estate, plus a section on development projects. In early 2017, the company launched TRData, a research section that offers comprehensive biographical information on real estate professionals and companies in New York City, as well as information on properties, including new developments. The site also includes a database of completed real estate deals in the city, market reports and industry rankings. TRData also sells custom research reports.

It continued to be published until February 1936. The first directors of the magazine were prominent Ukrainian statesmen, Hryhoriy Hrynko, who was replaced, due to his transfer to Moscow sometime in mid 1923, by O. Shumsky. Shumsky was fired from the position as well as the position of People's Commissar of Education in 1926 for nationalistic deviation. For a short period of time the position of director was given to Mykhailo Yalovy and Mykola Khvylovy, who were eventually displaced for nationalistic deviations. In 1927 the magazine was headed by Volodymyr Zatonsky. The magazine published the work of major Ukrainian writers and journalists such as Ivan Kulyk, Pavlo Tychyna, Pavlo Khrystiuk, Mykola Skrypnyk, V. Yurynets, and many others. During the 1920s the magazine published works representative of all kinds of political orientations and fields of literature, art, journalism, history, economy, etc. The magazine reflected on its pages both the weak and strong in the processes of Ukrainian cultural Renaissance of the time. The closing down of the magazine Chervony Shliakh was one of the last acts for the liquidation of a pluralistic cultural understanding. It was succeeded by the Literary Journal, which became a voice for socialist realism.

The Battle of Chlumec was the culmination of a 12th-century war of succession in the Duchy of Bohemia. It occurred on 18 February 1126 in the vicinity of the village of Chlumec () near Chaba≈ôovice on the southern slopes of the Eastern Ore Mountains. The Bohemian forces led by Duke Sobƒõslav I defeated an Imperial contingent of troops under King Lothair III of Germany and his Moravian ally Duke Otto II the Black. Background Since Duke Bretislaus I of Bohemia had implemented the inheritance principle of agnatic seniority in the 11th century, the order of succession in Bohemia, many rivalling scions of the ramified P≈ôemyslid dynasty waged war against each other. The claimants to the Prague throne sought for formal recognition by the Holy Roman Emperor, actually, the accession required the active support by the Bohemian nobility. The P≈ôemyslid duke Vladislaus I of Bohemia, ruling since 1109, likewise had to struggle to consolidate his authority, defying the claims raised by his brother Bo≈ôivoj II who had reached his enfeoffment by Emperor Henry IV in 1101. When Vladislaus died in 1125 his succession was disputed among his surviving brother Sobƒõslav I and his Moravian cousin Otto II, duke in Olomouc and Brno. Otto could appeal to the agnatic seniority principle, he also reached the support of Vladislaus' widow Richeza of Berg and King Lothair III. Battle In November 1125 King Lothair met with Bavarian nobles in Regensburg. They settled for a campaign into Bohemia in favour of Otto the Black who, according to the chronicler Otto of Freising, had offered a considerable sum of money. The Bohemian nobles received an ultimatum either to expel Sobƒõslav or to face a punitive expedition. Duke Sobƒõslav I, represented by negotiators in Regensburg, prepared for war. He made the Bohemian aristocracy rally to his support, strongly referring to the legacy of Saint Adalbert of Prague and Duke Wenceslas. In the winter of 1125‚Äì26 he had defensive works and encampments erected along the Kulmer Steig route, the presumed gateway of Lothair's troops. As the thaw set in, Lothair on February 18 crossed the Bohemian border at the Nakl√©≈ôov Pass with his army and met Sobeslav's troops either near Chlumec or in the vicinity of the Lotar≈Øv vrch (\\"Lothair Mountain\\") near J√≠lov√©. The exact location of the battle is not known. A vanguard of about 200 heavy armoured knights commanded by Otto the Black was immediately attacked by Bohemian forces in a narrow valley, while the main army under King Lothair found itself entrapped with no option to withdraw back to the mountain pass. The battle ended in a crushing defeat of the Imperial troops. Otto fell in action, and Lothair was captured with many of his liensmen like Margrave Albert the Bear and Landgrave Louis I of Thuringia. Sobƒõslav won a convincing victory, and released his captives on the condition of his investiture. Aftermath Sobƒõslav enfeoffment by King Lothair ended the state of war. Though formally the victor paid homage to the defeated, the duke strengthened his position and was able to affront all threats to his rule in Bohemia until his death in 1140. To commemorate his victory, he had a rotunda built on top of the ≈ò√≠p Mountain and consecrated by the Olomuc bishop Jind≈ôich Zd√≠k, one of the oldest Czech national monuments.

Background Honduras had a history of several coups d'etat and military governments during the second half of the twentieth century. A civilian government was elected in 1981, but human rights violations continued. The military unit Battalion 3-16, which received training and support from the United States Central Intelligence Agency both in Honduras and at U.S. military bases and in Chile during the presidency of the dictator Augusto Pinochet,Equipo Nizkor, LA APARICION DE OSAMENTAS EN UNA ANTIGUA BASE MILITAR DE LA CIA EN HONDURAS REABRE LA PARTICIPACION ARGENTINO- NORTEAMERICANA EN ESE PAIS., Margen carried out political assassinations and torture of suspected political opponents of the government. Amnesty International estimated that at least 184 people were \\"disappeared\\" from 1980 to 1992 in Honduras, most likely by the Honduran military. Creation The organization was created in May 1981 by Ram√≥n Custodio Lopez, a medical doctor and surgeon and founding member of the Medical College of Honduras. He remained the leader of CODEH until 1999. Aims CODEH's human rights aims were initially narrowly focused, but during the 1990s extended to economic and social human rights. Structure and leadership Andr√©s Pav√≥n Murillo has been president of the organization since 1999. In the spring of 2009 Manuel Zelaya invited the organization's leader Andr√©s Pav√≥n to a meeting. The two talked about Zelaya's constitutional modification plans as well as re- election, according to Pav√≥n. Pav√≥n \\"became pro-Zelaya\\" after the meeting. Government responses During the 1980s, the organization \\"withstood harassment and intimidation by Honduran security forces\\". Following testimony that CODEH regional director in northern Honduras, Miguel √Ångel Pav√≥n Salazar, gave against the Honduran government in October 1987 before the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACHR), he was shot dead on 14 January 1988. The Council of the Inter-Parliamentary Union found that \\"initial findings\\" linked the killing with √Ångel Pavon's IACHR testimony and stated that former Battalion 3-16 member Fausto Reyes Caballero had declared the names of Battalion 3-16 members responsible for √Ångel Pavon's assassination. The present president the organization, Andr√©s Pav√≥n Murillo, has had three legal cases against him and one attempt was made to kill him because of his human rights activities. CODEH reports In mid-2006, CODEH reported that seven former members of Battalion 3-16 (Billy Joya, Alvaro Romero, Erick S√°nchez, Onofre Oyuela Oyuela, Napole√≥n Nassar Herrera, Vicente Rafael Canales Nu√±ez, Salom√≥n Escoto Salinas and Ren√© Maradianga Pancham√©) occupied important positions in the administration of President Manuel Zelaya. On 11 November 2009, Andr√©s Pav√≥n stated that the Honduran military planned to disguise soldiers as a fake armed wing of the National Resistance Front against the coup d'etat in Honduras that would massacre members of the Democratic Civic Union on 29 November 2009, the day of the planned Honduran general election, with the goal of discrediting the National Resistance Front and creating a cycle of lethal violence between pro- and anti-coup civilian groups. Pav√≥n said that military officers \\"loyal to the Honduran people\\" had informed him about the plan and stated that the plan is to be carried out by supporters of the de facto government.

Promiscuous traffic should not be confused with the promiscuous mode, which is a network card configuration. In particular, in multicast socket networking, an example of promiscuous traffic is when a socket configured to listen on a specific multicast address group A with a specific port P, noted A:P, receives traffic from A:P but also from another multicast source. For instance, a socket is configured to receive traffic from the multicast group address 234.234.7.70, port 36000 (noted 234.234.7.70:36000), but receives traffic from both 234.234.7.70:36000 and 234.234.7.71:36000.

Though rarely considered a serious suggestion, the phrase theoretically encourages corrupt electoral activity, but is used mostly to suggest the occurrence of such corruption. The phrase had its origins in the United States in the mid-19th century, and had an early appearance in Britain when a newspaper reprinted correspondence from an American solicitor. The phrase, however, did not find widespread use until the early 1900s when it was used in relation to the activities of organized crime figures in Chicago. Meaning Vote early This portion of the phrase suggests a person should arrive to vote early in the day. Most democratic electoral processes involve polling booths, which are open for a mandated period of time. Voting early would suggest a particular enthusiasm for voting not necessarily shared by other electors. At the time the phrase was coined, this portion of the phrase is generally accepted to be a reference to voting early on polling day or early in the electoral process and not a reference to the formal process of early voting (which at the time of the phrase's coining did not exist). Before the introduction of the secret ballot in the latter half of the 19th century, open voting was the prevalent voting process. Under this system, returning officers frequently tallied votes as they were cast. Typically, it was neither illegal nor frowned on to report these results while the vote was in progress, and in any event few returning officers had either the ability or the inclination to suppress such reports. In such an environment, a candidate could provide a significant disincentive to vote against him by recording a seemingly insurmountable lead as early in the poll as possible, since at least some supporters of his opponents would presumably have not wanted to attract the ire of a powerful politician in support of a lost cause. During and even after the Nazi seizure of power in Germany, secret voting was technically possible, however, the Nazis subverted the process by packing the polling stations prior to opening with their own fanatical supporters. At the time, it was not illegal in Germany for a voter to decline their right to the use of the voting booths provided, so the Nazis would intimidate non-Nazi electorate by voting openly while expressing contempt for secret voting. This, combined with other techniques, was first practiced on a limited basis in the partly-free election of March 1933 and then on a universal basis in all of the sham elections and referenda the Nazis held thereafter. The tactics proved effective in dissuading most ordinary Germans from opposing Adolf Hitler's regime via the electoral process. Following World War II, as part of the denazification process, the reformed government in West Germany quickly passed laws making it illegal for an elector to vote openly without using a voting booth. In East Germany the elections for the Volkskammer had ballots with only one name, and these were deposited in public view; the possibility existed to cross out the name, but no privacy was afforded and serious consequences could result. Even today, it is often believed that early reports of the success of one party will motivate more of their supporters to come out or dissuade their opponents, although they could also convince less motivated supporters of a leading candidate that their votes are not required. In any event, to prevent just such an occurrence (whether real or perceived) most liberal democracies enforce restrictions while the polls are still open not only on the reporting of results, but also on exit polls and other data that might be construed as an indication of an ongoing election's eventual result. Vote often The \\"Vote often\\" portion of this phrase is the more controversial clause of this quote. While the phrase could be interpreted to mean that a citizen should vote in every election he or she is eligible to (such as party primaries, non-presidential election years and in local elections) so as to show a truly noble interest in one's civic duty, it appears that the phrase originally was meant to encourage citizens to vote as many times as they could even in the same election. While this practice was once legal in certain countries under certain limited circumstances (for example, some British voters were formerly allowed to vote both in their own geographical constituency and a special university constituency), it is now strictly prohibited in all liberal democracies. Most modern democratic electoral processes are operated on a one person, one vote basis. As such, voting often (on one day) would suggest that the person is illegally voting as more than one person ‚Äì a person with multiple voter registrations. The extra registrations might be for deceased persons, incapacitated living persons, persons known to have left the jurisdiction, fictional entities, and/or persons known to abstain from voting themselves, or persons registered (illegally) and voting in multiple locations. As such, the phrase suggests the person in question is involved in ballot stuffing or some other form of electoral fraud involving an individual casting multiple votes. Combined with the first part of the phrase, to vote early (either through the original meaning of early in the morning or through the formal process of early voting) gives the fraudulent voter the ability to cast multiple votes in a short period of time (if casting multiple in early votes), or time to travel to other precincts in order to cast ballots there, with only a minimal risk of getting caught. History Historian James Morgan, in a 1926 publication, identified John Van Buren as the originator of the phrase, an identification supported by Laurence Urdang and Janet Braunstein. Bartlett's Familiar Quotations notes its usage in 1858, by William Porcher Miles. The British newspaper The Times of 27 August 1859 printed a letter about the use of the ballot for voting in the United States, written by Richard Henry Dana, Jr. to his friend Lord Radstock. In the letter, Dana reports:\\"The Ballot In The United States\\" (letter), The Times, 27 August 1859, p. 9. The phrase is also noted as the \\"much vaunted maxim\\" of the Tammany Hall political machine of the 1860s: they used \\"repeaters\\", who were given five dollars and free liquor to go and vote for recently deceased voters. This process was depicted in the Martin Scorsese film Gangs of New York (2002), where drunkards are forcibly shaved (to alter their appearance) and turned back toward polling stations to vote again. In 1933 in D√°il √âireann (the Irish lower house), Thomas Kelly of Fianna F√°il said, > If a poor man is sick in hospital and not able to get out, surely it is a > good turn to see that his vote is registered. If he has gone away and his > neighbours know his opinions, I do not see any harm in personation. ... vote > early and often. In his book Capone, John Kobler attributes the phrase to the gangster Al Capone. In the United States, Republicans accused their opponents of inviting such corruption with their support of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, the \\"Motor Voter Law\\".

Other sources, however, suggest that 705 people were killed (Westfall, 2001) and many first hand accounts note the number is far greater than the official figure, perhaps closer to 1,000. The dumping ground was immediately closed following the incident by then President-Joseph Estrada but was reopened weeks later by then-Quezon City Mayor Ismael Mathay Jr. to avert an epidemic in the city due to uncollected garbage caused by the closure. The landslide prompted the passage of Republic Act No. 9003 or the Ecological Solid Waste Management Act of 2000, which mandates the closure of open dumpsites in the Philippines by 2004 and controlled dumpsites by 2006.

Nokia 3310 (modern 2017 version), an advanced feature phone. A feature phone is a mobile phone that retains the form factor of earlier-generation phones, with button-based input and a small display. Feature phones are sometimes called dumbphones in contrast with touch-input smartphones.https://abrahamswallet.com/2018/10/29/the-financial-benefits-of- dumb-phones/ They tend to use an embedded operating system with a small and simple graphical user interface, unlike large and complex mobile operating systems like Android or iOS. Feature phones typically provide voice calling and text messaging functionality as well as basic multimedia and Internet capabilities and other services offered by the user's wireless service provider. Feature phones often contain hardware including a backlit LCD screen, a hardware notification LED, a micro USB port, a physical keyboard, a microphone, an SD card slot, a rear-facing camera to record video and capture pictures, and GPS. Some feature phones include a rudimentary app store that includes basic software such as mobile games, calendar and calculator programs. Definition Prior to the popularity of smartphones, the term 'feature phone' was often used on high-end phones with assorted functions for retail customers, developed at the advent of 3G networks, which allowed sufficient bandwidth for these capabilities. Feature phones were typically mid-range devices, between basic phones on the low end with few or no features beyond basic dialing and messaging, and business-oriented smartphones on the high end. The best-selling feature phones include those by Nokia, the Razr by Motorola, the multimedia-enabled Sony Ericsson W580i, and the LG Black Label Series that targeted retail customers. Differences and similarities between other devices An opened Sony Ericsson W910i, a feature phone from 2007 Feature phones run on proprietary firmware, usually MediaTek MAUI with third- party software support through platforms such as Java ME or BREW. The proprietary operating systems were not designed in mind to develop nor handle the intensive applications found on iOS and Android, both of which specifically cater to third-party application development which became increasingly important. Depending on extent of functionality, feature phones may have many of the capabilities of a smartphone, within certain cases. For example, today's feature phones typically serve as a portable media player, and can have digital cameras, GPS navigation, Wi-Fi and mobile broadband internet access, and mobile gaming through discrete apps. Contemporary usage In developed economies, feature phones are primarily specific to niche markets, or have become merely a preference‚Äîowing to certain feature combinations not available in other devices, such as affordability, durability, simplicity, and extended battery life per one charge (viz standby and talk times). In emerging markets, a feature phone remains the primary means of communication for many. A well-designed feature phone can be used in industrial environments and the outdoors, at workplaces that proscribe dedicated cameras, and as an emergency telephone. Several models are equipped with hardware functions ‚Äî such as FM radio and flashlight ‚Äî that prevent the device from becoming useless in the event of a major disaster, or entirely obsolete, if and when 2G network infrastructure is shut down. Other feature phones are specifically designed for the elderly, and yet others for religious purposes. Rationale For manufacturers Feature phones are often kept in phone manufacturers' lineups for several reasons: * They are lower priced than smartphones, because: ** Most patents on basic mobile device technology have expired. Some expired patents make it possible to add more functions in their basic form that before were usually the purview of mid-range or high-end devices. Many standards-essential patents are required to have fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory licensing (RAND/FRAND), which typically means that license payments for each device using a standards-essential technology must be low enough that it will not disincentivize adoption of a standard or cause legal conflict; ** Less complexity translates to simpler and cheaper assembly; ** Relative modularity: a feature phone can be designed around one or two primary functions: flashlight, radio, MicroSD card slot for additional storage, music player, camera, Internet browser, and wireless hotspot for more advanced devices. Many basic phones now include some of that functionality, rendering them as either basic feature phones or smart feature phones‚Äîwhereas advanced feature phones include all of these and more. To consumers From the point of view of markets and consumers, there are several situations for which feature phones are beneficial: * Power requirements are typically relatively low, which translates to extended talk and standby times. * Anticipated loss, damage, or reasonably rough use: Feature phones are often more durable, less complex, and more affordable, and for these reasons are preferred as travel devices, children's devices, and for field use scenarios. The devices' low cost means that loss of such an item is manageable, and usually serves as a disincentive for theft in mature markets. * Liberal and mature markets are well-suited for specific functions: In countries where payphones have been discontinued, some operators offer prepaid cellular plans with a SIM card and a basic mobile phone in one package for about the same amount a mid-tier calling card would have cost (‚Ç¨15 for the whole package in some areas). Travelers may often prefer this option, given expensive roaming fees. History Industry trends The first cellular phone, the Motorola DynaTAC released in 1984, is considered a basic mobile phone due to its inability to do anything more than making voice calls and simple text messages. Despite the introduction of smartphones in the mid-1990s, ignited with the August 1994 release of the IBM Simon, Nokia Communicator from 1996 on, and the BlackBerry line of handheld personal digital assistants from Research in Motion, feature phones enjoyed unchallenged popularity into the mid 2000s. In North America, smartphones, such as Palm and BlackBerry, were still considered a niche category for enterprise use. Outside North America, Nokia's Symbian devices had captured the smartphone market, in which price was the only barrier to entry, and Nokia offered smartphones across all feasible price segments. In the mid-2000s, phone makers such as Nokia and Motorola enjoyed record sales of feature phones. In developed economies, fashion and brand drove sales, as markets had matured and people moved to their second and third phones. In the U.S., technological innovation with regard to expanded functionality was a secondary consideration, as phone designs there centered on miniaturisation. However, consumer-oriented smartphones such as the iPhone and those running Android fundamentally changed the market, with Steve Jobs proclaiming in 2007 that \\"the phone was not just a communication tool but a way of life\\". Existing feature phone operating systems at the time, such as Symbian, were not designed to handle additional tasks beyond communication and basic functions, and due to the complex bureaucracy and other factors, they never developed a thriving software ecosystem. By contrast, iPhone OS (renamed iOS in 2010) and Android were designed as a robust OS, embracing third-party software, and having capabilities such as multitasking and graphics capabilities in order to meet future consumer demands. These platforms also eclipsed the popularity of smartphone platforms historically aimed towards enterprise markets, such as BlackBerry. There has been an industry shift from feature phones (including low-end smartphones), which rely mainly on volume sales, to high-end flagship smartphones which also enjoy higher margins, thus manufacturers find high-end smartphones much more lucrative than feature phones. The shift away from feature phones has forced wireless carriers to increase subsidies of handsets, and the high selling-prices of flagship smartphones have had a negative effect on the wireless carriers, who have seen their EBITDA margins drop as they sold more smartphones and fewer feature phones. To help make up for this, carriers typically use high-end devices to upsell customers onto higher-priced service plans with increased data allotments. Trends have shown that consumers are willing to pay more for smartphones that include newer features and technology, and that smartphones were considered to be more relevant in present-day popular culture than feature phones. Market share During the mid-2000s, best-selling feature phones such as the fashionable flip-phone Motorola Razr, multimedia Sony Ericsson W580i, and the LG Black Label Series not only occupied the mid-range pricing in a wireless provider's lineup, they made up the bulk of retail sales as smartphones from BlackBerry and Palm were still considered a niche category for business use. Even as late as 2009, smartphone penetration in North America was low. In 2011, feature phones accounted for 60 percent of the mobile telephones in the United States and 70 percent of mobile phones sold worldwide. According to Gartner in Q2 2013, 225 million smartphones were sold which represented a 46.5 percent gain over the same period in 2012, while 201 million feature phones were sold which was a decrease of 21 percent year over year, the first time that smartphones have outsold feature phones. Smartphones accounted for 51.8 percent of mobile phone sales in the second quarter of 2013, resulting in smartphone sales surpassing feature phone sales for the first time. A survey of 4,001 Canadians by Media Technology Monitor in fall 2012 suggested about 83 percent of the anglophone population owned a cellphone, up from 80 percent in 2011 and 74 percent in 2010. About two thirds of the mobile phone owners polled said they had a smartphone and the other third had feature phones or non-smartphones. According to MTM, non-smartphone users are more likely to be female, older, have a lower income, live in a small community and have less education. The survey found that smartphone owners tend to be male, younger, live in a high- income household with children in the home, and residents of a community of one million or more people. Students also ranked high among smartphone owners. Japan Mobile phones in Japan diverged from those used elsewhere, with carriers and devices often implementing advanced features (such as NTT docomo's i-mode platform for mobile internet in 1999, mobile payments, mobile television, and near field communications) that were not yet widely used, or even adopted, outside of Japan. This divergence has been cited as an example of Gal√°pagos syndrome; as a result, these feature phones are retroactively referred to as a , blending with . While smartphones have gained popularity (and implement features introduced on them), many gala-phones are still commonly used, citing preferences for the devices and their durability over smartphones. Mobile games oriented towards smartphones have seen significant growth and revenue in Japan, even though there were three times fewer smartphone users in the country than in the United States as of 2017. Platforms Several distinct operating systems have been developed which can run on a feature phone. These operating systems are designed to be lightweight to increase the feature phone battery life, work well with a small screen which does not have touch features, and also work well with a small hardware keyboard such as T9 keyboard commonly found on feature phones. Nokia has developed the Series 30, Series 30+, Series 40 and FeatureOS software platform and application user interfaces which run the Nokia Asha platform. MediaTek has developed an embedded operating system named MAUI Runtime Environment which is based on Nucleus RTOS.https://lazure2.wordpress.com/tag/maui-runtime- environment/ NTT Docomo has developed MOAP software platform and OPP (Operator Pack) (Japanese). Qualcomm has developed a lightweight runtime environment Brew MP, an operating system for ARM phones REX OS, KCP (Japanese), and KCP+ (Japanese). Tizen Association (formerly LiMo Foundation) has developed a Linux-based LiMo Platform for smartphones. Smarterphone has developed Smarterphone OS, a full operating system designed for feature phones. The first release was in 2008.

Design and development Interplane Skyboy - front view showing the unusual main landing gear Interplane Skyboy - showing doors and interior accommodation The Skyboy was designed in 1992 specifically for the German market as a trainer. It was adapted for the US FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles category for use as a two-seat trainer under the FAR 103 trainer exemption. It later became available as a US light-sport aircraft. The aircraft is available in Canada as an Advanced Ultralight Aeroplane. The Skyboy wing is built from aluminum extrusions for the spars and wing ribs and covered with doped aircraft fabric. The wing's leading edge is Mylar covered in fabric, to increase stiffness. The wing is supported by \\"V\\" struts and utilizes jury struts. The fuselage is built upon an aluminum main tube that runs from the tail right to the rudder pedals. The wings and horizontal tail surfaces can be folded for trailering or storage. The cabin is constructed from two fibreglass shells, joined together. The rear of the cabin is covered in aircraft fabric. The optional cabin doors open upwards. Controls are conventional three-axis. The control stick is a centrally mounted \\"Y\\" stick, between the two seats that can be used from either seat. The Skyboy has a distinctive main landing gear, consisting of a trailing idler link, with suspension consisting of a coil spring mounted over a shock absorber. The company describes the main landing gear: \\"one of the best landing gears in the market (makes bad landings look good)\\". The available engines include the Rotax 582, Rotax 912, Rotax 912S and the Jabiru 2200. The Rotax 503 was available at the beginning of production, but did not provide adequate performance. The Skyboy has never been available as a kit aircraft, but only as a factory-complete, ready-to-fly product. Labour wage levels in the Czech Republic have meant that its price has been generally similar to buying unassembled kits for North American buyers. In 2008 the completed Skyboy base model sold for about US$60,000. Operational history Aside from its flight training and recreational aircraft roles, the Skyboy has been employed in South Africa for surveillance duties, in Australia for professional aerial photography and in Mexico for tourist sightseeing flights. Variants ;Skyboy UL :To stay below the exemption's empty weight limit the aircraft was marketed without cabin doors, wheel pants and hydraulic brakes, using mechanical brakes instead and with a gross weight. The initial engine was the Rotax 503 and later the Rotax 582. ;Skyboy S :Higher gross weight version for Europe and Canada, with the Rotax 582 or larger engines. ;Skyboy ZK : gross weight version, with the Rotax 582 engine.
