It aired on CBS in the United States on April 17, 2012. The episode is written by Christopher J. Waild and Reed Steiner and directed by Mark Horowitz, and was seen by 18.08 million viewers. Plot The NCIS team deal with an arsonist, which has links to the mysterious Watcher Fleet. While investigating, they team up with arson investigator Jason King, who DiNozzo feels uncomfortable around. They find that the arson was to cover up the theft of a top secret Navy file codenamed \\"Aquamarine\\". When a second fire occurs on board a cargo ship, the team goes to investigate as well. Jason saves DiNozzo's life after accidentally setting off a trap. Closer investigation reveals that the ship contained faulty wiring that could cause the entire ship to explode under the right conditions. DiNozzo finally reveals his past with Jason. He saved Jason's life from an arson fire, but was forced to abandon his sister, and Jason has resented him ever since. When they finally track down the arsonist, he reveals that he was hired to steal the file, but is killed by a car bomb. The team recovers the stolen files, and finds out that Aquamarine was a list of Navy ships that had been installed with the faulty wiring. The Watcher Fleet so far had only been able to retrofit a third of the affected ships. While Gibbs has NCIS warn the Navy about a possible terrorist attack, DiNozzo sets the record straight with Jason, telling him that he had to make a choice, and that rescuing him was his inspiration to become a police officer in the first place. Meanwhile, the U.S.S. Brewer falls victim to an arson attack. Production Gaius Charles guest starred as Tony's \\"kid in Baltimore\\", Jason King.\\"Rekindled\\" is written by Christopher J. Waild & Reed Steiner and directed by Mark Horowitz. The writers wanted to do \\"a fire episode\\", which never before had been done on NCIS. \\"'Hey, how about a fire episode?' With those words, we started the ball rolling on what would end up as Episode #207 of NCIS. And yet, with all the pyrotechnics, firebombs, and various other \\"fire elements\\" on our show, we‚Äôd never done a traditional arson story\\". The budget available usually only handle one \\"high-temp conflagration\\", the writers said. The episode centers around Tony and his \\"kid in Baltimore\\", Jason King (portrayed by Gaius Charles). The \\"kid\\" has been mentioned in numerous episodes before, including \\"A Man Walks Into a Bar...\\" and \\"Nature of the Beast\\". In this episode, the writers told the story between Tony and the \\"kid\\", a story going back over 20 years, but never explained before. \\"[...] the fire \\"stuff\\" worked fantastically, which allowed us to tell the FULL story behind the kid Tony \\"almost lost in Baltimore.\\" A story often hinted at ‚Äì but never fully explained\\". \\"Rekindled\\" also marked the start of the ending arch in season 9, with the return of \\"The Phantom Eight\\", last seen in \\"Housekeeping\\", and introduced in the season premiere \\"Nature of the Beast\\". Reception \\"Rekindled\\" was seen by 18.08 million live viewers following its broadcast on April 17, 2012, with an 11.2/18 share among all households, and 3.1/9 share among adults aged 18 to 49. A rating point represents one percent of the total number of television sets in American households, and a share means the percentage of television sets in use tuned to the program. In total viewers, \\"Rekindled\\" easily won NCIS and CBS the night. Compared to last week's episode \\"The Missionary Position\\", \\"Rekindled\\" was up a bit in viewers and even in adults 18-49. Steve Marsi from TV Fanatic gave the episode 5 (out of 5) and stated \\"now that was a first-rate episode of NCIS. \\"Rekindled\\" was a fitting title for an installment in which Tony crossed paths with a boy who changed his life forever and vice versa, and we were reintroduced to the mysterious Phantom Eight. This is how you do an \\"origin\\" episode and develop characters. Rather than simply having a guest star randomly tell us something about DiNozzo, he relived the past while working with Jason King in the present\\".

He has wrestled for Chaotic Wrestling, the Millennium Wrestling Federation, New England Championship Wrestling, NWA New England, Ultimate Ring Wars and Paulie Gilmore's New World Wrestling. Although based in the Northeast, competing most often in the New England region, Ferraro has wrestled in other parts the US as well as in Canada and Europe. Ferraro has held championship titles in numerous promotions in his career. He is a former NWA New England Heavyweight Champion, NWA New England Colonial Heavyweight Champion, NWA New England Tag Team Champion (with Ali Mohammed), and winner of the 2004 Tony Rumble Memorial Rumble. He also feuded with \\"Big\\" Rick Fuller over the Chaotic Wrestling Heavyweight Championship during 2001, winning the belt twice. Nine years later, he was inducted into the promotion's hall of fame. He has been similarly honored by the New England Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame. In addition to these championships Ferraro has won a number of brass knuckles and similar hardcore-themed titles, most notably, the AWA and NWA New England Brass Knuckles Championships; he is also only one of two men, along with Don Fargo, to hold brass knuckles titles recognized by both the American Wrestling Association and National Wrestling Alliance. He has been featured in New Wave Wrestling, Pro Wrestling Illustrated, WOW Magazine, and Wrestle America; one magazine ranked Ferraro #39 of the top 50 brawlers in pro wrestling history. He has won numerous tag team titles as one-half of The Millenium Killaz with Ali Mohammed. He was also part of The Alliance of Violence with The Vachon Brothers in CWA Montreal, where he and Pierre Vachon became the promotion's first-ever tag team champions in 2006, and Demon Ortiz in Chaotic Wrestling several years later. A legitimate strongman, Ferraro has performed feats of strength for numerous television and radio shows in New England, and at public events throughout the world. Often referred to as \\"Hammer Head\\" or \\"The Human Anvil\\", his specialty is breaking heavy objects such as concrete cinderblocks over his head. An assistant is generally used to drop bowling balls or operate a jackhammer or sledge.\\"The PWI 500.\\" Pro Wrestling Illustrated. Fort Washington, Pennsylvania: London Publishing Company. (November 2003): pg. 74. He has also encouraged 300 pound wrestlers to stand on his chest while lying on a bed of nails.\\"The PWI 500.\\" Pro Wrestling Illustrated. Fort Washington, Pennsylvania: London Publishing Company. (December 2001): pg. 74. In 2010, he was featured on Stan Lee's Superhumans. Less than a year later one of his demonstrations in Milan, Italy, aired on Lo show dei record, set the Guinness World Record for the most concrete blocks (45) broken on the head with a bowling ball. Early life John Ferraro was born in Revere, Massachusetts. He was a fan of pro wrestling growing up and followed the World Wide Wrestling Federation during the late 1970s and early 80s. Superstar Billy Graham, The Samoans, and managers Freddie Blassie and The Grand Wizard were among his favorites. He started weightlifting during his teenage years and eventually became a collegiate Bench Press and olympic-style weightlifting champion. As a powerlifter he benched 565 lbs.and lift 350 lbs. in the behind the neck press. He also had a background in martial arts, namely judo, and was also a power breaking champion. Ferraro was later employed as director of sales and marketing at Patriot Plastics in Woburn, Massachusetts, and remained with the company throughout his pro wrestling career. Ferraro eventually became interested in a pro wrestling career. He considered attending Killer Kowalski's wrestling school in Malden, Massachusetts but decided against it due to the high tuition fees. He was instead trained by Jeff \\"Bruiser\\" Costa, Rip Morrison, Dan Petiglio, and Paul Zine among others. Zine specifically helped develop his in-ring persona and getting him bookings in his early career. He also received additional training from Tony Rumble, Ox Baker, and The Iron Sheik and adopted versions of their finishers as homages to the latter two. Professional wrestling career =Early career in the New England independents (1996‚Äì1999)= Ferraro made his professional debut in November 1996 and wrestled for the first six months of his career as \\"The Golden Gorilla\\". He started his career in Jeff Costa's World Independent Wrestling promotion in New Hampshire twice winning the promotion's heavyweight title from Sonny Goodspeed and Bart Hart respectively. On December 13, 1998, he took part in Power League Wrestling's \\"Power-House Brawl\\", a benefit show for United States Marine Corps \\"Toys for Tots\\" program, at Johnson & Wales University in Providence, Rhode Island. Ferraro was the 17th entrant in the 23-man event and eliminated three wrestlers before he, the last participant, was eliminated by Derik Destiny. Four months later, he defeated Universal Soldier for the PLW Heavyweight Championship at St. Anthony's Parish Center in Pawtucket. Ferraro was subsequently stripped of the title after awarding it to his manager Scott Knight. That same year, he received an award for \\"Best Newcomer\\" (1998). Over the next two years, he won titles in numerous promotions on the New England independent circuit. In 1999, he became the first wrestler to simultaneously hold the heavyweight titles of the top three independent promotions in Rhode Island at the time (Unified Championship Wrestling, Independent Wrestling Alliance, and Power League Wrestling). He also won multiple tag team titles with Ali Mohammed as The Millenium Killaz. In August 1999, the team won the UCW Tag Team Championship from Kyle Storm and Widowmaker in a Bed of Nails hardcore match. A year later, they also won the tag team titles in International Independent Wrestling and Primal Conflict Wrestling. Ferraro was also involved with Northeast Championship Wrestling in West Warwick, Rhode Island. Starting in 2000, he and Anthony \\"Troubleman\\" Rufo began training a select few of the NCW roster. =NWA New England (1999‚Äì2000)= It was during this period that Ferraro got his first big break wrestling for Tony Rumble and the NWA New England promotion in Boston, Massachusetts. He appeared on its inaugural event held at the Good Times Emporium in Somerville, Massachusetts where he teamed with Joel Davis and Trooper Gilmore in a 6-man tag team match against The NY Posse (Ron Zombie, Curtis Slamdawg, and Jay Kobain). He began competing regularly for the promotion the following year scoring victories over \\"Brutal\\" Bob Evans and Alex Arion in the fall of 1999. On July 20, 2000, he and Ali Mohammed won the NWA New England Tag Team Championship from (Luis Ortiz, Slyk Wagner Brown, and Jason Rumble). They dropped the belts to Luis Ortiz and Jason Rumble a month later in Somerville; earlier in the show, Martino defeated Trooper Gilmore, Nemesis, Jaime Paine and Zach Mason in a five-way match to win the NWA New England Brass Knuckles Championship. Prior to losing the tag team belts, he was the first wrestler to hold both the NWA New England Tag Team and Brass Knuckles titles at the same time. At one point, he was managed The Pink Assassin and was walked to the ring with a dog collar. Also that summer, a cage match between Ferraro and John Kronus ended in a no-contest. The two met again in September three months later for a UCW show at Johnson and Wales College. Their hardcore match went to a 20-min. draw before referees stopped the match. The infamous \\"Blood Bath Street Fight\\" became the \\"Most Requested Match of the Year\\" on Joe Bruins' Hardcore Wrestling show aired on Cox Cable in Rhode Island. The Millennium Killaz also defended the PCW Tag Team Championship against one-time ECW World Tag Team Champions The Pitbulls (Pitbull #1 and Pitbull #2), a bout which ended in a double-disqualification. At the end of the month, Martino faced his tag team partner in a three-way thumbtack match with Jamie Paine for the NWA New England Brass Knuckles title on September 28, 2000. That same year he was one of several wrestlers featured in the 2000 pro wrestling documentary \\"Ringmasters: Pro Wrestling in New England\\", a special presentation by New England Sports Network which later aired on Spike TV. =Chaotic Wrestling (2000‚Äì2001)= Ferraro began wrestling for Chaotic Wrestling in late 2000. On October 20, 2000, he defeated Jay Jaillette for the Chaotic Wrestling Heavyweight Championship in Worcester, Massachusetts. In his seven-month championship reign, Ferraro successfully defended the title against some of the top wrestlers in the Northeast. On January 12, 2001, he defeated John Kronus in a \\"Revere Street Fight\\" involving a bed of nails. He also faced El Mascarado (February 9), \\"Mr. USA\\" Tony Atlas (February 23), and Ronnie D. Lishus (April 6), the latter match being officiated by special guest referee Ricky \\"The Dragon\\" Steamboat. Another notable opponent was his tag team partner, Ali Mohammed, who he defeated in a Razor Chain match. Ferraro finally lost the belt to Rick Fuller at the Wonderland Greyhound Park in Revere on May 18. A few weeks later, he entered the 2001 King of Chaos tournament and made it to the finals where Ferraro lost to Ali Mohammed in a four-way match with Jamie Paine and Nemesis. This was the first-ever \\"hardcore\\" match held in New England to use a no-rope barbed wire ring, light tubes, fire, a bed of nails, thumbtacks, and foreign objects. On June 23, he also teamed with Short Sleeve Sampson in a losing effort against The One Night Stand at the Knights of Columbus Hall in Methuen, Massachusetts. Ferraro regained the heavyweight title from Fuller in a Lights Out match on the July 13th edition of Friday Night Chaos. In August, the then reigning Chaotic Wrestling champion was interviewed by Boston Magazine in which he discussed the difficulties of being an independent wrestler. His second reign lasted for a little over two months before he was dethroned by The One Night Stand's Ronnie D. Lishus in Lawrence, Massachusetts on September 7, 2001; he had defeated Aaron Stevens in a match lasting 47 seconds earlier that same night. Two weeks later, Ferraro defeated Jimmy Cash in a Tables match. His last match was against Scarecrow on December 14, 2001, which ended in a disqualification. Suffering a serious neck injury in his bout with Ronnie D. Lishus, he took three months off to recuperate and lost 30 pounds by the time he returned to action early the next year.\\"The PWI 500.\\" Pro Wrestling Illustrated. Fort Washington, Pennsylvania: London Publishing Company. (December 2002): pg. 74. =Independent circuit (2002‚Äì2003)= Prior to the end of his first run with Chaotic Wrestling, Ferraro returned to Rhode Island where he and Ali Mohammed regained the PCW Tag Team Championship from The Mutilators on October 4, 2002. On January 18, 2003, in Ultimate Championship Wrestling, he also defeated Travis Funk in a Strap match to win the UCW Heavyweight Championship. A year later, The Millenium Killaz won the UCW Tag Team Championship as well. Ferraro also wrestled for Jaime Pain and Nemesis' Crimson Mask Wrestling, PWF Northeast, and Rocky Raymond's Empire Professional Wrestling, the latter running events at Whalom Park and Thompson Speedway. Although primarily based in the Northeast and New England region, Ferraro eventually wrestled in other parts the country, such as for Bill Behrens in Georgia and Bert Prentice in Tennessee, as well as in Canada and Europe. =Millennium Wrestling Federation (2003‚Äì2004)= In late 2003, Ferraro joined the Millennium Wrestling Federation. He was originally brought in by MWF Commissioner Dr. Von Johnson to take out Ralph Lano but later turned against him. At MWF's \\"Soul Survivor\\", he and Slyk Wagner Brown attacked Todd Hanson following his victory over D-Lo Brown, also cutting his hair and throwing it at Hanson's family members seated at ringside. Embarrassing Hanson in front of his hometown, their actions began a heated year-long feud between the two wrestlers. Later on in the show, in which Ferraro was scheduled to have a championship match, MWF Commissioner Dr. Von Johnson \\"screwed\\" him by ordering a gauntlet match instead. Ferraro defeated three other wrestlers to get to Todd Hanson and battled to a double-countout. He was later recruited by Ox Baker to join his stable, Ox Baker's Army. While managed by Baker, he used a variation of Baker's infamous heart punch, using a headbutt rather than a punch, called the \\"Baker Breaker\\". Soul Survivor 04' saw Ferraro team with Kamala the Ugandan Giant and The Executioner in a 6-man tag team match against Todd Hanson, Beau Douglas, and \\"Cowboy\\" Bob Orton. When Hanson pinned the Executioner, Ferraro was blamed for the loss\\"The PWI 500.\\" Pro Wrestling Illustrated. Fort Washington, Pennsylvania: London Publishing Company. (November 2005): pg. 74. since he was the team captain. He started trading blows with Kamala and his former stablemates turned against him. Eventually, Todd Hanson and his team returned to the ring on Ferraro's behalf. The show ended with Ferraro shaking hands with his long-time rival. =Return to NWA NE (2004‚Äì2005)= Ferraro returned to NWA New England in the summer of 2004. On June 4, he won a 12-man taped fist battle royal to regain the NWA New England Brass Knuckles Championship. He briefly lost the title to Osirus on August 4 but regained it six days later in a \\"Buxton Barroom Brawl\\" in Buxton, Maine. The bout was voted the best match of the year for New Wrestling Horizons by the Freaks of Wrestling website. Ferraro followed this up with successful title defenses against Johnny Curtis, Craig Stratton, Brian Black, and Jason Rumble. In addition to the NWA New England-New Wrestling Horizons interpromotional shows, Ferraro also wrestled solely for NWH shows where he feuded with Larry Huntley. On September 28, Ferraro also pinned Jason Rumble in a match to decide the number one contender for the NWH Heavyweight Championship. He later teamed with Danny Dangerous to win the NWH Tag Team titles from The Elite (Larry Huntley and Sonny Roselli). In October, Ferraro represented NWA New England at the 2-day NWA 56th Anniversary Show in Winnipeg, Manitoba; he and Larry Huntley lost to The Trailer Park Boyz (Matt Korn and Dave Drako) on the first night (October 15) while Ferraro defeated Dave Drako the second night (October 16). He also defended the title in New Wrestling Horizons and NWA Green Mountain that same month. On November 4, 2004, Ferraro won the 2nd annual Tony Rumble Memorial \\"Rumble\\" Battle Royal, co-promoted by NWA New England and Paulie Gilmore's New World Wrestling, and was awarded the NWA New England Colonial Heavyweight Championship; also during the show he successfully defended the NWA Brass Knuckles title in a Broken Glass Death match against Dave Donavan winning via submission. Two weeks later, Ferraro defeated Beau Douglas at NWA New England's 2004 Tony Rumble Memorial Show. He spent the rest of the year making Brass Knuckle title defenses in NWA Green Mountain, NWA USA Pro Wrestling, and NWA Wildside. On February 4, 2005, Ferraro beat The Outpatient and Apocalypse in a Triple Threat match to win the NWA New England Heavyweight Championship. As a result of this victory, he became the only wrestler in NWA New England history to simultaneously hold the promotion's heavyweight, colonial, and bass knuckles championships. One day after his victory, Ferraro defended the NWA New England Brass Knuckles title at New World Wrestling's \\"Extreme Revenge\\" against Pierre Vachon in a barbed-wire chain death match. On March 3, Ferraro won a hardcore battle royal in the All Star Wrestling Federation by pinning Jose Perez via a fireball. Two weeks later in NWA New England, he and the 7'2\\" 550 lbs. Bull Moose Calhoun fought to a no-contest in a Dog Collar match. On June 10, 2005, he defended the Brass Knuckles title against Pierre Vachon in a Fans Bring the Weapons match. He re-wrestled Vachon, this time in a three-way broken bottle death match with Dave Donavan, and won the ASWF Hardcore Championship. =Return to MWF (2005)= After leaving Ox Baker's Army, Ferraro began training with The Iron Sheik who eventually became his manager. Like Ox Baker, he started using his own version of The Iron Sheik's Camel clutch finisher called the \\"Iron Clutch\\". It was during this time that Ferraro started the so- called \\"Headbutt Challenge\\" offering $5,000 to anyone who could knock him out in a headbutting contest. No one was successful in collecting the money. This was initially done to promote himself as having \\"the hardest head in all pro wrestling\\", however, this was later incorporated into his legitimate strongman performances. On August 5, 2005, he wrestled both Vachon Brothers in a single night, defeating Damian in the first match and Pierre Vachon in an Anything Goes match later on. On September 24, 2005, he won a \\"King of the Jungle\\" Death match against Kamala at \\"Road to the Gold\\" to win the AWA Brass Knuckles Championship. He defended the belt against The Outpatient in a Falls Count Anywhere match on October 22. Another title defense at MWF's \\"Soul Survivor III\\", against The Missing Link, ended in a no-contest. He has called this the most favorite match of his career. Ferraro continued feuding with Ox Baker's Army for the remainder of the year defeating The Outpatient in a Cape Cod Collision match on November 11 and Makua in Falls Count Anywhere match on December 4, 2005. =CWA Montreal (2006)= At the start of 2006, Ferraro traveled to Canada to join CWA Montreal, one of two Canadian affiliates for AWA Superstars. On January 16, 2006, he retained the AWA Brass Knuckles Championship in a Bloodbath match against Pierre \\"The Beast\\" Vachon, however, he soon allied with The Vachon Brothers (Pierre and Damien Vachon) to form The Alliance of Violence. He and Pierre Vachon entered a Tag Team Turmoil championship tournament; they defeated Karnage and Abdul Hannish in the opening round (March 5), The Hellraisers (Pain and Mizery) in the semi-finals (March 19), and Necro Butcher and SeXXXy Eddy in the finals (April 8) to become the first-ever CWA Montreal Tag Team Championship. Ferraro briefly returned to New England where he was awarded the NWW Undisputed Brass Knuckles title on May 6, 2006. He also entered a championship tournament for the NWW U.S. Heavyweight Championship. He defeated Dave Showtime in the opening round (May 6) but was eliminated in the semi-finals (May 7) by Eric Shred via disqualification. He also teamed with Ron Zombie to defeat Justin Credible and The Sandman in a Beds of Nails Death match for Powerhouse Wrestling a week later. On July 22, a tag team match against Karnage and Abdul Hannish ended in a no-contest when Ferraro turned against his partner Brick Crawford. Feuding with the heavyweight champion, he defeated Crawford for the CWA Montreal Heavyweight title on August 19, 2006. =Return to the independent circuit (2006)= Back in New England, Ferraro continued wrestling for local promotions. On September 23, 2006, he wrestled Greg \\"The Hammer\\" Valentine in a Dog Collar match for Powerhouse Wrestling. He also defended the NWW Brass Knuckles Championship against Moondog Maximus, losing to Maximus in a non- title match on October 7, before dropping the belt to Headshrinker Samu at an October 28 Ultimate Ring Wars show. Two months later, Ferraro wrestled Doink the Clown for USWF Championship Wrestling at the Irish American Club in Malden, Massachusetts. =Ultimate Ring Wars (2006-2007)= During 2006 and 2007 Ferraro worked with and performed many strongman feats with URW in the New England area . He was a welcomed addition to URW with all of his experience and his showmanship. Wrestling several times in hardcore matches with Pierre the Beast Vachon, Ferraro always captivated the crowds with his in ring style and strength. =Big Time Wrestling (2006‚Äì2007)= At the end of 2006, Ferraro joined the then recently revived Big Time Wrestling under Terry Allen. On December 1, he defeated Mister T.A. at The Castle of Knights in Chicopee, Massachusetts for the BTW United States Heavyweight Championship. Ferraro was the first wrestler to hold the belt in nearly three decades. During the next few months under manager Johnny Fabulous, he defended the title against Purty Kurty Adonis, Doink the Clown, Big Bear Matoush, and Malice. He also lost to Mr. T.A. in two separate Dog Collar matches, but retained the U.S. title in both encounters. The latter match, which took place on September 1, 2007, was for Terry Allen's BTW Dog Collar title. =Powerhouse Wrestling (2007‚Äì2009)= Ferraro and Johnny Fabulous also appeared for Powerhouse Wrestling during this time. In the spring of 2007, he wrestled \\"Superfly\\" Jimmy Snuka and Jake \\"The Snake\\" Roberts, losing both matches. That summer, Ferraro enjoyed a brief reunion with The Vachon Brothers in Ultimate Ring Wars Wrestling when he turned on his partner Crazy Chainsaw Bastard during a May 19 tag team match against The Vachons. He and Pierre Vachon faced each other in a special 4-man battle royal, with Paulie Gilmore and Kahuko, two months later in New World Wrestling. Ferraro eventually defeated CCB in a Casket match on September 15, 2007. Days later in Powerhouse Wrestling, a match between Ferraro and Abdullah the Butcher, involving broken bottles, a screw driver, a bed of nails, and Abdullah's infamous fork, ended in a no-contest. During this period, Ferraro joined the Men of Business with Big Business, Jimmy \\"Jact\\" Cash, Rocky Badabino, and Paul E. Normus. On January 19, 2008, he and Big Business lost to Don and Savio Vega in a Street Fight match. That fall, he defeated Spike Dudley in a Chain match. On September 26, 2009, he wrestled both New Jack and Powerhouse Wrestling Heavyweight Champion \\"The Punisher\\" Don Vega in two Steel Cage matches in Worcester, Massachusetts. =Return to BTW (2009)= On March 27, 2009, Ferraro wrestled \\"Sweet\\" Scott Ashworth in the opening bout for BTW's \\"Danbury Mania\\" held at the Danbury Arena in Danbury, Connecticut; in the semi-main event, a 12-man Royal Rumble-style \\"Danbury Dungeon of Doom Match\\", he and Team Fuller (Rick Fuller, Jack Maverick, Benny Jux, Roberto Rush, and Mister T.A.) were defeated by Team Incredible (Justin Credible, Spike Dudley, Eddy DelFonzo, Tony DelFonzo, Malice, and Scott Ashworth).Bradley, Jeff. \\"BTW 3/27/09 Report.\\" Declarationofindependents.net. Ed. Sean McCaffrey. N.p., Mar. 2009. Web. Jan. 27, 2012. . Ferraro also had a brief stint in Maine's NWA On Fire. He made his first appearance on the February 21st 2009 edition of \\"NWA On Fire TV\\" as a guest on \\"Tommy's Corner\\" with host Tom Savoldi. He wrestled two matches for NWA On Fire TV, against \\"Boston Bad Boy\\" Jason Rumble and \\"Jivin\\" Jimmy Capone respectively, and remained undefeated during his time in the promotion. On July 12, Ferraro was inducted into the 2009 New England Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame by his one-time tag team partner Anthony Rufo. Ferraro formed a successful tag team with former rival \\"Mr. T.A.\\" Terry Allen in late 2009. Together they defeated Bam Bam Delfonso and Scott Ashworth (October 14), Balls Mahoney and Scott Ashworth in a hardcore match (November 14), and were joined by A.J. Mitrano in a 6-man tag team match against \\"Superfly\\" Jimmy Snuka, Spike Dudley, and Lone Star (November 20). The following night, the two were defeated by Snuka and Doink the Clown in Palmer, Massachusetts. On January 23, 2010, Ferraro teamed with Jimmy Cash and Kurt Von Schmidt in a six-man tag match and were defeated by Hacksaw Jim Duggan, Nikolai Volkoff, and Jay Jaillette in Worcester, Massachusetts. A year later, he and Tommy Mack also won the promotion's tag team titles from The Untouchables. =Return to CW (2010)= At Chaotic Wrestling's \\"Cold Fury 9: The Never-ending Chase\\" Ferraro was inducted into the Chaotic Wrestling Hall of Fame. The following month at \\"Cold Fury: Fallout\\" he had an in-ring confrontation with fellow CW Hall of Famer Demon Ortiz which ended with Ferraro knocking Ortiz to the mat with a headbutt to the sternum. On April 30, he and Ortiz met in the opening rounds of Chaotic Wrestling's Tournament of Champions which saw Ferraro defeat Ortiz in a No Holds Barred match. He then defeated Elia Markopoulos in the second round (May 21) before being eliminated by Handsome Johnny in the semi- finals (June 18) at \\"Breaking Point\\". A week earlier he had also lost to \\"The Golden Greek\\" Alex Arion via disqualification. On July 16, he was scheduled to wrestle his old rival Rick Fuller at the Polish American Veterans Club in Lowell, Massachusetts, however, this match never took place due to the interference of Max Bauer. At the end of the month, he defeated Elia Markopoulos in a rematch at the Elks Lodge in Woburn. Ferraro eventually joined Demon Ortiz to form a new version of The Alliance of Violence later that year. On October 1, Ortiz confronted him during a match against Vortex. This was Ortiz' first appearance in the promotion since being injured by Ferraro back in April. As the two stared each other down, in preparation for a fight, Ortiz inexplicably attacked Ferraro's opponent causing a disqualification and left the ring together. The next night in Lawrence, he and Ortiz interfered in a tag team match between four young trainees from the Chaotic Training Center (Vortex & ‚ÄúWestern Dragon‚Äù Wesley Thomas vs. Alec the Alien & Dudley DL Dawson) causing a no-contest when they attacked all four participants and the referee. At CW's \\"Lowell Street Fight\\", they wrestled Julian Starr and Chase Del Monte. On November 12, Ferraro was in Ortiz' corner in his match against Rick Fuller. They challenged Julian Starr and Matt Logan for the Chaotic Wrestling Tag Team Championship in Hudson, Massachusetts the next day, but were unable to win the belts. On December 3, 2010, The Alliance of Violence and Chase Del Monte & Rick Fuller battled to a double-countout at CW's \\"Fan Appreciation Night\\" in Lowell, Massachusetts. At the end of the year he was interviewed by The Eagle-Tribune while performing at a benefit show Salem police and firefighters at Drew Estate Cigars. He was also a guest on the Canadian internet radio show Rope2Rope Radio where he discussed the independent scene in the Northeast, promoting Chaotic Wrestling and a few other New England promotions, as well as his own wrestling career. =Independent Wrestling Entertainment (2010)= Ferraro spent the winter of 2010 in Maine working for Independent Wrestling Entertainment where he formed Primer Inc. with Johnny Primer. On September 24, Ferraro and Primer defeated Jim Capone and The Ninja for the IWE Tag Team Championship. A month later, they suffered a disqualification loss to Larry and Kyle Huntley (with Miss Jenna) in Brewer, Maine, but retained the tag titles. On November 5, 2010, Ferraro joined Donny Rotten, Iron Eagle, and \\"Redneck\\" Randy Walker in an 8-man Survivor Series match against The Huntleys and Public Works (\\"Roadblock\\" Mark Mahoney and John Bryar). Ferraro eliminated John Bryar and Kyle Huntley via pinfall before he himself was pinned by Larry Huntley. Although Huntly ended up being the lone survivor, Ferraro hit his opponent in the face with a fireball after the match. The following night in Brewer, while gloating about burning Larry Huntly during an in-ring promo, IWE Executive Director Quentin Michaels came out and ordered Primer Inc. to defend the tag titles in a No Rules Texas Tornado match against Kyle Huntley and a partner of his choice (which was revealed to be John Bryar). Two weeks later, Ferraro (with Ox Baker) defeated Adam Hastey via disqualification for All Out Mayhem in South Portland, Maine. He was also scheduled to take part in the 2nd annual Al Biondi Memorial Tournament on December 11, 2010. =Second return to CW (2011‚Äìpresent)= On January 21, 2011, Ferraro defeated Psycho at \\"Rival's Choice\\" in Lowell, Massachusetts. A month later at \\"Cold Fury X\\", he was the first entrant in the Royal Rumble-style \\"Classic Chaotic Countdown\\" and the first to be eliminated. This was done via outside interference from color commentator Rick Fuller, who Ferraro had been taunting, by pulling down the top rope and allowing Elia Markopoulos, Kid USA and Donnie Rotten to throw him out of the ring. He and Ortiz also took on Chaotic Wrestling Tag Team Champions The Logan Brothers (Bryan and Matt Logan) at Cold Fury: Fallout on March 4. but lost the match. Ferraro took a few months off for a knee injury before returning to action in the fall. On October 4, 2011, Ferraro was a guest on the AngryMarks.com podcast Ring the Bell hosted by \\"Killa Kev\\" Fields, Mike Poulin, and Seth Drakin. He promoted an upcoming interpromotional show for Independent Wrestling Entertainment and NWA on Fire during the show, where he was to face former tag team partner Johnny Primer, as well discussed his recent appearances on Italian television and Stan Lee's Superhumans on the History Channel. After a five-year absence, Ferraro was also ranked #500 of the top 500 singles wrestlers in the 2011 PWI 500. In early 2012, Ferraro also wrestled shows for Powerhouse Wrestling and UFO Wrestling. On April 20, 2012, Ferraro (with B.A. Tatum) defeated \\"The Sure Thing\\" Mark Shurman at the Elks Lodge in Woburn, Massachusetts. The next night in Gray, Maine, he defeated Larry Zbyszko to win the All Out Mayhem Heavyweight Championship after interference from John Cena Sr. Strongman career Outside of professional wrestling, Ferraro is a real-life performing strongman. His demonstrations have included bending steel bars and breaking iron bars over his head, and headbutting and snapping a Louisville slugger in half with his skull. His specialty, however, is using his head to break various hard or heavy objects. He has had cinder blocks jack-hammered off his head, concrete blocks set on fire and broken over the side of his head using a sledge hammer, and having 16lb bowling balls dropped on his head from heights up to 15 feet. Ferraro has also used his forehead to drive spikes through 2x4s wrapped in sheet metal. Ferraro first discovered this ability as a teenager when, while chasing younger brother around the house during an argument, crashed head first into a large oak door. Ferraro first gained notice in the New England area appearing on numerous cable-access sports and pro wrestling television programs in the region. He was also invited on WROR's \\"Loren and Wally show\\" in Burlington, Massachusetts where he performed \\"Feats of Strength\\" for guests and listeners. This led to further work in commercials which aired in Massachusetts and Central New England and later CMT's Country Fried Home Videos. He was also part of the 1999 strongmen documentary \\"Beyond Pain\\" by James W Kent. His strongman demonstrations have been covered by The Boston Globe (New Hampshire edition), The Daily Item, Revere Journal, Silver City Bulletin, and The Sun Chronicle. Among his most notable performances include: *1999: Performing in a strongman demo at the Attleboro Armory in Attleboro, Massachusetts (attn. 500+) *1999: Performing an extreme strongman demonstration at The Hot Dog Safari (Suffolk Downs) in Revere, Massachusetts. (attn. 5,000) *2000: Performing an extreme strongman exhibition at WAAF's Locobazooka concert in Green Hill Park. (attn. 4,000) *2004: Performing his \\"Iron Head\\" demo at the NWA 56th Anniversary Show in Winnipeg, Manitoba. *2005: Performing his \\"Iron Head\\" demo at an NWA Tri-State live event in Glenville, Virginia. (attn. 1000+) Ferraro was featured on the August 19th 2010 edition of The History Channel's Stan Lee's Superhumans. The episode examined his hard skull as well as attempted to explain how he performed his pro wrestling and strongman stunts. Ferraro was studied by Harvard Medical School which determined through an MRI that his skull measured 16mm thick, over 2.3 times more than the average human skull, making it one of the thickest skulls ever x-rayed. The show's host, legendary Marvel comic book writer Stan Lee, nicknamed Ferraro the \\"Human Anvil\\" which he has since adopted for his strongman performances. In addition, the episode's title (\\"Hammerhead\\") was named after him. On April 14, 2011, Ferraro set a Guinness World Record for having 45 concrete slabs (15 stacks of 3 with an estimated combined weight of 1125 lbs.) broken over his head using 16 lbs. bowling balls that were dropped from a height of over ten feet. The bowling balls were dropped onto to head continuously for over three minutes. This performance took place in Milan, Italy and later aired on Canale 5's Guinness World Records TV series Lo show dei record. He also won the Chinese Martian Arts Association Iron Skills title in Long Island, New York. That same year, he added a new attraction to his strongman performance, the \\"$5,000 Headbutt Challenge\\" in which members of the public would be given the chance to trade headbutts with the strongman. If they were successful in knocking him out, Ferraro would pay the winner $5,000. This was borrowed from a similar concept used in his pro wrestling career. As of May 2011, Ferraro has knocked out 11 would-be challengers from around the world. In an interview later that year he revealed he has been in negotiations to perform in Europe (France, Germany, and Poland) and Southeast Asia (Malaysia) and was also considering putting together an act for America's Got Talent and The X-Factor.

He was a member of the legislative assembly of Saskatchewan for Estevan area ridings. He represented Estevan from 1931 to 1932 and from 1934 to 1938 (when his riding was named Bromhead) and he represented Souris-Estevan from 1938 to 1944 in the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan as a Liberal.  Early life  He was born in Melita, Manitoba, the son of John McLeod (1860-1938) and Sarah Hannah Harding (1866-1952). His parents soon moved to the future town of Estevan in mid-1892, opening up a shop (McLeod's Meat Market) in town soon after, and homesteaded north of town by 1901. Norman was educated in Estevan public and high schools, followed by Regina Normal School for teacher training (1909 and 1916). He left to study at the University of Manitoba writing his summer thesis \\"Souris Valley Bridge\\" in 1912.Thesis held in Elizabeth Dafoe Library at University of Manitoba, \\"Dept. of Civil Engineering--Dissertations\\" per search . He received his degree of Bachelor of Science in 1914.

Within 2 years they moved to Estevan to take over the running of John McLeod's businesses when he became ill. Norman served on the town council for Estevan and on the local school board.  Politics  He first ran for the Saskatchewan Legislature for the riding of Estevan in a by-election held on December 23, 1930 after Eleazer William Garner resigned his seat. When the legislature opened in early January 1931 the seat was still vacant pending a recount before Judge E. R. Wylie. In a very close count, he had been initially declared elected by the returning officer but in the recount was defeated by David McKnight for the seat in the provincial assembly The election was contested, with claims from both parties (Liberal and Conservative) of improprieties. Claims of tampered ballots were reported on by H.E. Sampson, and that report verbally accepted by the Conservative Premier lead to both sides deciding to drop their legal claims so that the legislature could decide who should sit. At the last moment Mr. McKnight changed his mind on the arranged agreement leading to his legal counsel resigning. McLeod was declared elected on February 9, 1931 by a vote of the provincial assembly. The legislature had left open the option of a constituent appealing their decision and a Mr. Lamb soon did so. Norman McLeod's election was subsequently overturned by a decision of Sir Frederick Haultain and that decision was upheld by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal on November 7, 1932. The decision was based upon the fact that the number of votes cast by unqualified persons (17) was greater than the number of votes in McLeod's majority (5). The appeal court allowed that the unqualified voters may have voted for McKnight and left open a further action by the legislature to appoint Mr. McLeod. However planned redistricting would eliminate the Estevan riding in the next election and it was thought the election was less than 12 months away. The seat remained vacant until the general election held in 1934, when McLeod was elected in the new Bromhead riding. He later represented the combined riding of Souris-Estevan after winning in the 1938 provincial general election when fellow Liberal MLA Jesse Pichard Tripp did not run again. (Tripp became a Federal MP in 1940). McLeod was defeated by Charles David Cuming when he ran for re-election to the assembly in 1944.  Later life and death  After his defeat he continued to be active with provincial and federal political groups. He was a president of the rotary club (1936-1937) and a member of the local masonic lodge. He died at home on Friday September 23, 1949 after spending a week in hospital for a heart ailment. He was survived by his wife, daughter, mother, brother and 2 sisters. In 1932 Mr McLeod donated the McLeod Trophy to the Estevan Collegiate Institute for a 4-game high school basketball series played against Weyburn. The still named 'McLeod series' of games have been played for most of the 80 years that followed.

Started in 1934, the program was originally set up in Scotland by the four Scottish art schools, Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow under the name Needlework Development in Scotland Scheme. The project was a collaborative initiated between industry and art education, that was to encourage British embroidery design. The project was sponsored anonymously by thread producers J & P Coats. By 1945 the scheme had amassed over 900 embroideries but the outbreak of the Second World War saw the project disbanded. The Scheme was restated after the war, in 1944, and extended throughout the 1950s to include schools in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. British artists, including the painter and illustrator Mary Kessell were speciality commissioned to create experimental designs for the scheme which could then be reinterpreted in embroidery. The program ended in 1961, having achieved its original aims, and the collection of over 3,500 embroideries, was given to various museums and organisation, including the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.

In 2009 less than 35% of recruits could pass basic weapon qualification due to low literacy levels. Recruits were unable to properly read instructions in order to maintain or operate complex western supplied rifles and additional components such as optics. As a result, recruits had to undertake at least 64 hours of lessons in basic reading, writing and arithmetic in order to pass Grade 1 and move to their units. Recruits were also given the option of a further 128 hours to advance to grade 2 to bring their total to 192 hours. To achieve Grade 3 they had to undertake a further 120 hours which gave them 312 hours of literacy training in total.

Description It grows high. The branches are strong and erect, with reddish bark that is easily removed in strips. The leaves are larger than in the other species of Cistus, up to long, lanceolate, dark green, while the underside is whitish due to trichomes. The flowering occurs in late spring (May‚ÄìJune), later than most rockroses. It bears white flowers with a yellow spot in each petal, of 4.5‚Äì5 cm diameterFlora Iberica 3: 331 It is widely cultivated in gardens, and has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=430 Distribution and habitat  Cistus laurifolius has a disjunct natural distribution, in the Western Mediterranean area (Morocco, Portugal, Spain, southern France, Corsica and Tuscany), the Aegean and Anatolia. With the general warming of the atmosphere and the consequent withdrawal of the ice, flora surviving from Tertiary times could not re-establish their range in southern Europe; the new post-glacial climate was drier than that of the Tertiary. The original tropical European flora evolved into the present Mediterranean sclerophyll flora. The distribution of some surviving species, such as Cistus laurifolius, moved to wetter areas such as the mountains. Due to this, C. laurifolius is named in Spanish in its distribution area as \\"mountain rockrose\\", although in the coastal west and northwest Iberian Peninsula, it is found at sea level. Cistus shrubland, including C. laurifolius, survives fire and has seeds that germinate after fire. Phylogeny Cistus laurifolius belongs to the white and whitish pink flowered clade of Cistus species.

The story was first published in 1844 and was included two years later in the collection Mosses from an Old Manse published by Wiley & Putnam. Summary \\"The Artist of the Beautiful\\" follows Owen Warland as he works on an unknown project. The story begins with Peter Hovenden, a retired watchmaker and Owen's former master, walking by with his daughter Annie. Peter scoffs at Owen for working on something other than a watch, and tells his daughter that the more practical work of the blacksmith Robert Danforth is more admirable. Working with such strength, Peter believes, \\"takes the nonsense out of a man.\\" Owen has overheard this conversation and wonders if Annie agrees with her father. Robert presents Owen with a tiny anvil he had requested and the two briefly discuss the differences between practical work and more ambitious work. Resuming his project, Owen finds himself affected by Robert's practical-mindedness and unintentionally ruins his work. In despair, Owen put the project aside and begins to focus on his watchmaking, becoming well-respected in town. In the midst of this success, Peter returns to the shop and sees that Owen has resumed work on his secret invention. He threatens to destroy it, which he believes will be helping him. Owen shouts at him and curses the \\"coarse world\\" that does not appreciate his work. Months later, Annie visits and asks him to repair a thimble of hers. Owen, for a moment, thinks she is the one person who might understand his work, but changes his mind when she accidentally breaks his small machine. Owen breaks from society for a time and finds his nourishment in nature and in chasing butterflies. Peter returns to invite him to a celebration for the engagement of his daughter to Robert Danforth. Owen secretly loves Annie and is despondent for a time but, once his spirits revive, he returns to his project with vigor. Years pass before he visits Robert and Annie at their home. He offers his invention to Annie as a late wedding gift and instructs her to open an extravagantly decorated box. Inside is a small butterfly which lands on her finger. She is unsure if it is real or a machine. Her child reaches for the butterfly but he has inherited his father's strength and his grandfather's skepticism and the butterfly is crushed in his small hands. Owen is not upset because he had already achieved his goal as the artist of the beautiful; the butterfly itself was only the physical manifestation of that symbol. Publication history \\"The Artist of the Beautiful\\" was first published in The United States Magazine and Democratic Review in its June 1844 issue before being included in the collection Mosses from an Old Manse in 1846.Wright, Sarah Bird. Critical Companion to Nathaniel Hawthorne: A Literary Reference to His Life and Work. New York: Facts on File, 2007: 28. . Margaret Fuller, in the June 22, 1846, edition of the New York Daily Tribune, stated that the story \\"presents in a form that is, indeed, beautiful, the opposite view as to what are the substantial realities of life\\".Barger, Andrew, ed. (2013). Mesaerion: The Best Science Fiction Short Stories 1800‚Äì1849. Bottletree Books LLC, 2003: 71. . Analysis \\"The Artist of the Beautiful\\" is considered to be the first robotic insect short story. Hawthorne biographer Brenda Wineapple compares the story with \\"Alice Doane's Appeal\\" in that both feature a creator or artist character whose creation is unappreciated by others.Wineapple, Brenda. Hawthorne: A Life. Random House: New York, 2003: 71. . Critics generally include the story, along with \\"The Birth-Mark\\" and \\"Drowne's Wooden Image\\", as Hawthorne's most significant explorations of the nature of Art and its creation.Bromell. Nicholas K. By the Sweat of the Brow: Literature and Labor in Antebellum America. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1993: 101. . In fact, the story combines the creation of Art with science, making it an early form of science fiction.Franklin, H. Bruce. Future Perfect: American Science Fiction of the Nineteenth Century: An Anthology. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1995: 17. . Hawthorne also ambiguously plays with the concept of the Cult of Domesticity in the story. Owen Warland is removed from traditional domestic happiness, for example, but it is unclear if Hawthorne himself even acknowledges this form of fulfillment. Annie mentions that she admires her child more than she admires the butterfly, but the narrative voice admits that such admiration is \\"with good reason\\", allowing the reader to question Hawthorne's admiration of his own character's invention.Dunne, Michael. Hawthorne‚Äôs Narrative Strategies. Jackson: University Press of Mississippi, 1995: 169. .

The monk was forced to flee when he became king but returned and became influential during Mahasena's reign. Reign Accounts cited that upon the death of Gothabhaya, there were faction among the dignitaries of state who were dissatisfied. Several ministers refused to participate in the funeral rites. In response to the perceived insult, Jettha Tissa forced them to join the procession leading to his father's cremation and had them killed at the end of the ceremony. During his reign, Jettha Tissa added more stories to the Lovamahapaya constructed by King Dutugamunu, turning it into a seven story building. and renovated the stupa in Muthiyangana Raja Maha Viharaya.

In 1924 a sports flying event was held at the airfield. In July 1925, Lufthansa operated flights from the new airport to Frankfurt/Main and Kassel. The station building was opened in 1927. Hangars and other buildings began to appear from 1929. In 1933 a beacon was built just off the airfield to facilitate nighttime navigation. After the establishment of the National Socialist government in 1933, and Fliegerhorst Giessen was militarised, and became home to a Combat Wing (Kampfgeschwader 55 (KG-55) \\"Greif\\"). The airfield was enlarged and more hangars were built in 1938. Other buildings were marked as commercial warehouses on building plans, masking their use as munitions storage. United States Army units moved into the Gie√üen area in April 1945, and designated the airfield as \\"Advanced Landing Ground Y-84\\". It was used briefly as a casualty evacuation and combat resupply airfield by the IX Air Service Command, Ninth Air Force. After the German Capitulation on 8 May, it was re-designated as \\"Army Air Forces Station Giessen\\". Army Air Forces units moved out in July, and the facility was taken over by United States Army units, which converted the facility into the Giessen Army Depot, one of the largest depot facilities in Germany, with its own railway system and warehouses. The only known Army Aviation use was the Giessen Army Heliport (Giessen AHP) operated by a detachment of the 503d Combat Aviation Battalion. During the 1950s Elvis Presley was assigned to Giessen. The facility was closed as a garrison by the United States in 2008, but remained a distribution center for the Army and Air Force Exchange Services (AAFES).

Early life and education Liljeblad was born in Oulu, Finland. His parents were surveyor Gustav Wilhelm Liljeblad and Margareta Elisabeth Leivisk√§. He completed the study programme in the Mission School of the Finnish Missionary Society and was ordained a missionary in 1900. First term in Ovamboland Liljeblad arrived in Ovamboland, then German South-West Africa, together with Rev. Jooseppi Mustakallio, the Director of the Finnish Missionary Society, who came to South-West Africa for an inspection trip. This was the first visit of its kind in the oldest mission field of the FMS. They left Finland on 31 January 1900 and arrived in Ovamboland on 22 June the same year.Peltola 1958, p. 130.Lehtonen 1999, p. 34. During his first term in Ovamboland, Liljeblad founded the Onayena mission station in Eastern OndongaPeltola 1958, s. 140. and 1903 the Nakeke mission station in Ongandjera, together with Heikki Saari. Liljeblad arrived in Ongandjera in 1903. King Shaanika was glad to have teachers in his kingdom, but Liljeblad did not get along with the king and was forced to leave the kingdom already in 1904.Peltola 1958, p. 145‚Äì147. During his first term, Liljeblad also taught school in Ondangwa and Ontananga.  Furlough in Finland  During his furlough in Finland, he studied theology, completing his studies in 1910, and in 1911 he was ordained a minister. Second term in Ovamboland At the beginning of his second term, Liljeblad first visited the Cape, in order to acquaint himself with the educational system there. He visited institutions run by various missionary societies. Liljeblad had been stressing the necessity of training teachers in Ovamboland for years, and now, in spite of opposition from the head of the mission field, Rev. Martti Rautanen, he was able to found a teachers‚Äô training seminary in Oniipa, and subsequently worked as its principal. The seminary began to function in 1913, when it had six applicants. There was a classroom for it, but the students had to build a dormitory for themselves. In 1916, 7 unmarried men and 6 married men studied at the seminary. The terms ran from June to September, and from February to April. In this way, the men were able to participate in the work on their own fields outside the terms, and also they could avoid having to sit in the classroom during November and December, which were the hottest months. Liljeblad wrote that the students were very excited about their studies. Even during the rainy season they wanted to come to the seminary once or twice a week, so they would not forget what they had learned. In 1916, the first students, four men, graduated. One student had died and one had had to abandon his studies. However, the number of students grew so that beginning in 1918, the seminary had two sections. In 1921, 30 new students were admitted. At the end of 1918, Liljebald offered his resignation to the Board of the FMS, stating he was dissatisfied with the numbers of applicants to the seminary, and with the fact that the need for teachers in Ovamboland could not be met.Peltola 1958, p. 158.Lehtonen 1999, p. 46‚Äì51. In 1918 Liljeblad was called to perform a special task in Oukwanyama. Up to that time German missionaries had been conducting missionary work there, but in 1916 the last of them had had to leave this mission field. An English border guard, Major Fairlie had built a modest church building in a place called Omafo. In 1918, a strange pastor appeared there, wanting to baptize local people. He demanded one pound per person, and when he turned out to be Catholic, Fairlie sent him away and asked Liljeblad to come and pay a visit to Oukwanyama. Liljeblad came to Omafo, consecrated the church and baptized 55 pagans. In addition, he baptized children of those who already were Christians, married several couples and confirmed youngsters in the Lutheran faith.Peltola 1958, s. 196. Just before he left for Finland, Liljeblad participated in a new administrational body, the board of the mission field in 1919. The other members were Rautanen, treasurer Kalle Pet√§j√§ and secretary Reinhold Rautanen.Peltola 1958, s. 158. Pastoral work in Finland Having returned to Finland, Liljebald worked as a pastor in Kirvu in 1920‚Äì1922 and in Simpele in 1922‚Äì1924. His last position was that of vicar of Ruskeala, near Sortavala, in 1924‚Äì1937. Collecting folklore in Ovamboland During 1930‚Äì1932 Liljeblad travelled once more to Ovamboland, having received a grant from the Finnish Academy of Science and Letters. The Ovambo folklore materials he collected a during this journey are kept by the Division of Manuscripts of the National Library of Finland in Helsinki. These materials consist of ca. 150 handwritten notebooks, mostly in Oshiwambo. Liljeblad translated these texts into Finnish until his death, managing to translated about one half of these texts. The rest were translated during the following three decades by Mrs. Anna Glad (n√©e Woutilainen), the second wife and widow of the missionary Aksel Glad. Mrs. Glad had worked in Ovamboland in 1901‚Äì1919 and 1926‚Äì1936, and had acted there as the first inspector of schools.Lehtonen 1999, p. 51‚Äì52. The translations have been typed up, and they contain 2016 folio sized pages, which in word processor format will yield about 1 000 pages. Some of the notebooks contain Finnish text in Liljeblad's own hand, and it is not known if correspondent Oshiwambo texts were ever recorded. It is presumed that these Finnish texts have also been typed up. Several scientific works published in Europe are based on these materials. One dissertation (by M√§rta Salokoski) is completely based on this material, and another one (by Minna Saarelma-Maunumaa) is partly based on it. Liljeblad is also said to have published religious booklets, and he also wrote hymns for the Oshindonga hymn book. Liljeblad also collected ethnographic and scientific collections, which were later donated by his last surviving daughter to Oulu University. The university is preparing to put these collections on permanent display. Personal life In 1904, Liljeblad married teacher Alma Helena Kestil√§. Kestil√§ had arrived in Ovamboland in 1902.Lehtonen 1999, p. 36. It seems that Liljeblad was a quick-tempered person, and he was often at odds with the head of the mission field, Rev. Martti Rautanen. Together with e.g. Anna Glad he represented a younger generation of missionaries, which considered it important to provide not only spiritual but also secular instruction to the Ovambos. It was said that during World War I his sympathies lie with the English and not with the Germans, as was the case with many other Finnish missionaries, including Rautanen.

It works primarily through the commercial private sector, in addition to the public and non-governmental organization sectors which are the more traditional routes for development assistance in malaria control. Its goal is to drive down the price of the most effective malaria medicines so that millions of people can afford to buy them. The program has been called \\"one of the most important recent advances in fighting malaria\\" and \\"a triumph of international cooperation.\\" The AMFm is hosted and managed by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria in Geneva, Switzerland. The premise of the AMFm is that a factory-gate global subsidy, with measures to support its implementation, will save lives and reduce malaria-related mortality by increasing access to ACTs, and delay the onset of widespread resistance to the artemisinin in ACTs. It includes three elements: (i) price reductions through negotiations with ACT manufacturers, (ii) a buyer subsidy through a 'co-payment' at the top of the global supply chain and (iii) supporting interventions at the country level to promote the appropriate use of ACTs. AMFm Phase 1 was formally launched in April 2009 and began operations in July 2010. AMFm Phase 1 is being implemented through nine pilot programs in eight countries: Cambodia, Ghana, Kenya, Madagascar, Niger, Nigeria, Tanzania (mainland and Zanzibar) and Uganda. There are early signs AMFm Phase 1 is effectively increasing availability and decreasing prices of ACTs; however the Global Fund Board will only take a decision on the future of AMFm at the end of 2012 on the basis of an independent evaluation. As part of the Copenhagen Consensus 2012, a panel of leading economists concluded that the AMFm was \\"one of the best returns on health that could be made globally\\" and ranked it two of 16 priority solutions to advance global welfare. In November 2012 the Global Fund Board decided to modify the existing AMFm business line by integrating lessons learned from Phase 1 into Global Fund core grant management and financial processes. The AMFm was subsequently renamed the Private Sector Co-payment Mechanism. Background Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes. Plasmodium falciparum is the species of the malaria parasite that causes the vast majority of severe disease and death. In 2010, there were about 216 million cases of malaria globally, and about 655,000 deaths ‚Äì mostly among children in Africa. Yet, malaria is preventable and treatable. The most effective treatment for malaria are ACTs which combine artemisinin with another antimalarial medication. ACTs are recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) as first-line treatment for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria and, in 2004, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the largest global funding source for malaria control, began reprogramming all approved grants to procure ACTs in areas with high levels of drug resistance. However, ACTs account for only one in five antimalarial treatments taken and, until the advent of the Affordable Medicines Facility-malaria (AMFm), were provided almost entirely by the public sector. Over 60 percent of patients in malaria endemic areas access anti- malarial treatment through the private sector but, before the AMFm, the private sector only accounted for about 5 percent of all ACTs provided. ACTs are more expensive than the less-effective first-line malaria treatments, such as chloroquine (CQ), sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP) and amodiaquine (AQ), which usually cost less than US$1. Therefore, unsubsidized, quality-assured ACTs are not affordable by many of the people who need them in malaria-endemic countries. This leads to avoidable complications or death, since people either do not receive treatment or use cheaper, less effective antimalarials. Further, if patients use artemisinin monotherapies, this increases the risk of widespread resistance to artemisinin. The challenges noted above have been compounded by a mismatch between country realities and the channels through which ACTs financed by development aid were routed. Whereas the commercial private sector plays a significant, sometimes dominant, role in many countries, donor-funded ACTs have been traditionally channeled mostly through the public sector and not-for-profit private sector. These factors, combined with an insufficiency of ACTs relative to the burden of malaria, resulted in poor access to ACTs at country level and persistent use of inappropriate alternatives. Origins In 2004, the United States Institute of Medicine called for a global co-payment toward purchases of ACTs by first-line buyers directly from drug manufacturers. This call stemmed from the recommendations of the IOM committee chaired by Nobel Laureate economist Professor Kenneth Arrow, which were published in Saving Lives, Buying Time: Economics of Malaria Drugs in an Age of Resistance. The IOM committee advocated for \\"a sustained global subsidy of artemisinin co-formulated with other antimalarial drugs in order to reduce malaria mortality (\\"saving lives\\") and delay resistance (\\"buying time\\")\\" until new categories of antimalarials could be developed. The proposed buyer co-payment for quality-assured ACTs would be available to both the public and private sectors. Arrow explained, \\"When I discovered that 70% of chloroquine was distributed commercially, I immediately came to the conclusion that ACTs would have to be distributed through the private sector if we wanted nearly universal coverage.\\" Subsequent analyses published in peer-reviewed journals reconfirmed the potential impact of the IOM committee proposal. Better access to ACTs is an essential part of the comprehensive package of interventions required to fight malaria that includes prevention (insecticide-treated nets, indoor residual spraying, other vector control techniques and in development of malaria vaccines) and treatments for severe malaria. Establishment The Roll Back Malaria (RBM) Partnership, in collaboration with the World Bank and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, initiated work in 2006 to implement the IOM proposal; the key technical design principles of the AMFm were developed and endorsed in 2007. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria was invited to host the AMFm and, in 2008, the Global Fund Board approved the implementation plan and policy framework for a limited Phase 1 of the AMFm: the launch of the AMFm would be phased, beginning with a limited number of countries (approximately 290 million ACT treatments to be supplied over two years); Phase 1 of the AMFm will be assessed via an independent technical evaluation; the findings of this evaluation would be reviewed by the Global Fund Board in 2010 to decide whether to proceed to global roll out of the AMFm. Following this approval, preparations began for the launch of the AMFm in 2009. Elements AMFm Phase 1 has three elements: (i) price reductions through negotiations with ACT manufacturers, (ii) a buyer subsidy through a 'co-payment' at the manufacturer level of the global supply chain and (iii) supporting interventions to promote appropriate use of ACTs. Implementation AMFm Phase 1 was formally launched in April 2009 and began operations in July 2010. Eleven countries were invited to participate in the pilot and eight countries (nine pilots) were ultimately approved by January 2010: Cambodia, Ghana, Kenya, Madagascar, Niger, Nigeria, Tanzania (mainland and Zanzibar) and Uganda. Given the delays associated with the startup of AMFm Phase 1, the Global Fund Board extended the implementation period of AMFm Phase 1 by six months to end 2012.

History Even before the construction of the airfield in 1936, Langendiebach was used for military purposes. During the Roman period (100-260 AD) the fort Lingen cohort and the small fort Langendiebach was built to secure the Upper Germanic Limes border. A total of 500 soldiers were stationed from Dalmatia. Parts of these constructions can still to be found. The construction of the airfield, in the meadows of Langendiebach, goes back to an accident. In the summer of 1936 the Air Force had to hold maneuvers. In an air exercise, machines were involved from the Ju-TYPE 52nd. One of these Junkers Ju 52 machines was forced to perform an emergency landing and landed it on the meadows of Langendiebach. Ground was broken for the construction of the Langendiebach Airfield, or Fliegerhorst Langendiebach as it was then known, in the summer of 1936. Although it was originally intended that there should be three phases of construction, only the first phase of construction was completed, due to the outbreak of World War II. On 19 March 1939 the official opening of the airfield was marked by a large celebration, involving a parade from the center of Erlensee to the front gate, and a festival with an air show which saw 25,000 civilian attendees. In 1940, Langendiebach became the site of a glider school (Flughafen-Bereichs-Kommando 3/XII), the graduates of which went on to participate in, among other operations, the invasion of the Soviet Union (\\"Operation Barbarossa\\"). In addition to gliders, there were various experimental aviation units at Langendiebach, including a high-altitude fighter squadron. From the middle of 1944 until the Americans succeeded in crossing the Rhine, two successive groups of Junkers Ju 88 Nightfighters, the I/NJG 4 then III/NJG4, were stationed at Langendiebach. Once the Americans had crossed the Rhine River, these elements of the Nachtjagdgeschwader 4 (NJG 4) were withdrawn to North Eastern Germany. The three most destructive bombing attacks on the Airfield Langendiebach occurred on 9 September 1944, 10 November 1944 and 24 December 1944. The bombing raid carried out on 10 November involved 229 B-24 Liberators, which dropped a total of 431.5 tons of bombs. This bombing was conducted in the light of recent intelligence, which revealed that the Langendiebach runway had recently been extended by some 300 meters to accommodate three Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighters of Kampfgeschwader 55 (KG 55) \\"Greif\\", however the unit never received any of the jet fighters. In order to divert allied attacks away from Langendiebach, the Germans emplaced decoy airfields, consisting of wooden mock-ups of aircraft and of airfield facilities, in the vicinity of Mittelbuchen, Kilianst√§dten, and Ro√üdorf. These succeeded in leading low-flying aircraft astray on many occasions, but could not prevent the comprehensive destruction inflicted upon Langendiebach by war‚Äôs end. The buildings and facilities of the air base were assessed as 20% destroyed, and the severely pockmarked runway as totally unserviceable. Furthermore, the woods were bombed from B√§rensee to R√ºckingen, in order to eliminate the camouflaged aircraft in parking spots concealed by woods. Present-day B40, which could be used as an auxiliary runway, was also bombed. Fliegerhorst Langendiebach's facilities and airfield were totally unserviceable when the Americans occupied the area in April 1945, and the airfield was converted by IX Engineering Command, Ninth Air Force into an Army Air Forces advanced Landing Ground, designated Y-91. Air Force units used the airfield as a casualty evacuation and combat resupply airfield by the IX Air Service Command. After the German Capitulation on 8 May, it was re-designated as \\"Army Air Forces Station Hanau/Langendiebach\\". Army Air Forces units moved out in August, and the facility was taken over by United States Army. Hanau became a major United States Army aviation facility during the Cold War, also known as Fliegerhorst Army Airfield. In 1952, several construction projects were undertaken to give the airfield back its character as a military facility. It was during this period that the large ammunition bunkers west of the airfield were built. From 1957 to 1960, Hangars 1302, 1303 and 1304, and the control tower were converted and refitted to accommodate helicopter aviation. Due to the troop reductions pursuant to the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty and the Treaty of Vienna, many battalions have been removed from the Langendiebach facility since 1991, still it stands as one of the most important US Army Aviation Airfields in Europe until the end of the 1990s. In 1990, the following elements were stationed at Hanau AAF: * 2-227 Avn: 18 AH-64A, 13 OH-58C, 3 UH-60A * 3-227 Avn: 18 AH-64A, 13 OH-58C, 3 UH-60A * Bco 8/158th AVN REGT (AVIM): 6 UH-1H Huey * I-227 Avn: 2 UH-1H * TF Viper: 15 UH-60A, 3 EH-60C, 6 OH-58A, 6 OH-58D, 6 UH-1H * 3rd Battalion 20th Field Artillery (Formerly 2/75th Field Artillery): 24 M109A3 SP Howitzers * 1st Battalion 32 Field Artillery: 6 Lance Missile SP Launchers, 8 SP Loader/Transporters = Closure = The airfield was gradually drawn down following Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, and was closed entirely no later than 2007. All US Army assets in the Hanau Military Community were officially returned to the local government in 2008, and the MilCom was deactivated. = Fire Incident = On the afternoon of 30 June 2015 a fire broke out in the former Officer's Club / Bell Tower Building.

It has postal code of 10710. Pasar Baru is also the name of a 19th-century market which was established in the neighborhood and gave its name to the administrative village. Established in 1820, Pasar Baru is one of the oldest shopping district in Jakarta. Pasar Baru is located in the heart of Jakarta's busiest district. The area centered in a street called Jalan Pasar Baru that runs in a north-south axis. The southern edge of the street is marked with a gate and a bridge that span over a canal that connects to Jalan Raya Pos, a section of Java's Great Post Road that runs through Jakarta. Right across the Pasar Baru southern gate is Jakarta Art Building. The Pasar Baru street is lined with numbers of shops, restaurants and also several shopping centers. Most of shops here sell textiles, shoes, clothes and other fashion products, such as; sportswear, watch and jewelries. While shopping center on the north sides specialized on selling cosmetics, cameras and photography products. Culturally the area demonstrates a fusion of Indonesian, Dutch colonial, Chinese and Indian cultures. Pasar Baru is popularly known as Jakarta's Little India, due to the fact that large numbers of Indian Indonesians settled here (but mostly of Sikh and Sindhi ancestry in contrast to Medan's Kampung Madras, whereby Tamils are the majority regardless of religion), and established their textile business in this market. Government As an administrative village (kelurahan), Pasar Baru is the southernmost administrative village of Sawah Besar Subdistrict. It is among the most historic neighborhood of Batavia, the southern half was the former Weltevreden whereas the northern half was the commercial center of Pasar Baru market. The boundary of kelurahan Pasar Baru is Jalan Lautze to the north, the East Flood canal to the east, Jalan Taman Pejambon I - Abdul Rahman Saleh - Senen Raya IV to the south, and the Ciliwung - railway line to the west. Pasar Baru market This section focuses on Pasar Baru as a market, not as the administrative village. =History= Founding of Pasar Baru Entrance to the predominantly Chinese Pasar Baru in late 19th- century. The wider new bridge has not been constructed at the time. Pasar Baru dates back to the early 1820s. It was established as Pasar-Baroe or Passar- Baroe (Malay \\"new market\\") to distinguish it with the older markets of Pasar Senen and Pasar Tanah Abang, which were established in 1735. Pasar Baru was located just to the north of the Euro-centric Weltevreden neighborhood. Despite its close proximity with Weltevreden, the streets of Pasar Baru was dominated with the Chinese community. Another considerable minority centered in Pasar Baru is what the Dutch called andere vreemde oosterlingen (\\"other foreign Orientals\\"): Bombay people of the British Indians, mostly from Calcutta and Mumbai. The Bombay people focused their profession on silk trading and other oriental fabrics. They generally speaks more English than Dutch. Golden period Crowds of people in Pasar Baru. During the 1950s, Pasar Baru became Jakarta's busiest shopping center for middle- and upper- class consumer. A 1956 guidebook of Jakarta quoted Pasar baru as \\"the best known shopping-centre of the capital. Almost everything is to be had there: the latest fashions in clothing from Europe, America and Asia, the latest improvements on kitchen-utensils, products on Indonesian art, craft and textiles, the best fruits, home-grown as well as imported ones, tea- and lunch-rooms, jewelers, tailors, shoemakers, furniture dealers etc. etc.\\" Because of the increasing crowd and traffic in Pasar Baru, on August 1, 1957, the government banned parking along the street of Pasar Baru to ease traffic flow. Despite the ban, in practice it was difficult to keep cars from parking in Pasar Baru. During this golden period, the stores of Pasar Baru were predominantly Chinese, e.g. Warenhuis Sam Hoo. Indian presence was also large, and mostly focused on textile stores known locally as Toko Bombay. Examples of Toko Bombay were Kissoomall, Bagamall, Chotirmall, and Gehimall. Several Indonesia's largest department store chain trace it roots back to Pasar Baru, e.g. Matahari department store, Indonesia's largest department store chain which started when the founder Hari Darmawan bought a 1920s building at Jalan Pasar Baru 52-58 called Toko de Zon (\\"sun shop\\") and rename it Matahari (Indonesian \\"sun\\"). Decline Pasar Baru in the 1970s. Pasar Baru began to lose out to modern shopping malls of the 1970s and 1980s, such as Gajah Mada Plaza, Aldiron Plaza and Ratu Plaza; as well as large air-conditioned malls in the 1990s. Despite of this, Pasar Baru continues to survive with a more mid-market target. A roof was installed over Pasar Baru street to protect shoppers from the rain. =Attractions= Pasar Baru includes three different areas of Jalan Pintu Air Raya, Metro Atom Plaza and Harco Plaza Pasar Baru, allowing visitors to find almost everything under the sun, such as clothes, footwear, musical instruments, beauty products, watches, cameras and more. In addition to being a shopping paradise, Pasar Baru also offers legendary noodle shops and street food as well as religious spots. *As the area known as Little India, there are Indian apparel outlets and tailors, restaurants, grocery shops. Sai Study Group on Jalan Pasar Baru Selatan, which is the institution hosts lessons about Bhagavan Sri Sathya Sai Baba, one of India's most revered spiritual teachers. *Sin Tek Bio temple, which is located on Jalan Pasar Baru Dalam, was first established in 1698. According to the temple‚Äôs guidebook, Sin Tek Bio was founded by Chinese farmers who lived around Ciliwung River and Pasar Baru. =Transportation= Pasar Baru is served by TransJakarta Corridor 3.

The case involved the State of New York, Cornell University, constitutional lawyer Louis Marshall, and others in the first decade of the 20th century. Background In 1898, the New York State Legislature, responding to an initiative by Colonel William F. Fox, Superintendent of New York's state-owned forests and supported by Governor Frank S. Black, approved by statute the establishment of the New York State College of Forestry at Cornell. The university was granted $165,000 \\"to purchase of land in the Adirondack forests for experiments in forestry.\\" Dean Bernhard E. Fernow, formerly Chief of the United States Department of Agriculture's Division of Forestry, recruited to head the new college, moved quickly to establish a demonstration forest on the site, near Axton, New York, the site of an old lumber town originally called Axe-town, in Franklin County. Fernow's plan called for clearcutting the tract over a 15-year period, followed by the replanting of conifers. With an annual state appropriation for the college of only $10,000, Cornell entered into a contract with the Brookyn Cooperage Company for the project to be viable. Under terms of the contract, Cornell \\"reserved for its own use only 1,500 acres and agreed to sell to the company for its business purposes one- fifteenth of the timber on the rest of the land every year for fifteen years.\\" (In the 1890s, the more valuable red spruce trees had been logged, leaving primarily northern hardwoods.) Fernow had a -long railroad spur built from Axton to Tupper Lake in order to deliver logs to the company's facility. Brooklyn Cooperage turned the hardwood logs into barrels and the cordwood into methanol and charcoal, through a process called destructive distillation. The contract proved to be profitable and beneficial for the company only. To his credit, Fernow established the first tree nursery in New York State at Axton. But Cornell gained insufficient funds from the relationship to fully replant the clear-cut areas. Most of the non-native conifer species that were planted, such as Scots pine and Norway spruce, did not do well for years, with a denuded area resulting. Rise of opposition The demonstration forest, near Saranac Lake, in the Adirondacks drew heated opposition from neighboring land owners. Smoke from the burning of brush and logging slash, along with Fernow's disposition toward landowners from nearby Saranac Lake further alienated the public.Gove, B. 2005. Logging railroads of the Adirondacks. Syracuse University Press. pp. 176-181. Fernow's actions drew criticism also from Adirondack guides such as Ellsworth Petty (father of Clarence Petty), who protested the plan and, in a letter writing campaign, successfully lobbied the State to assign a special \\"Committee of the Adirondacks\\" to tour the Axton site. In its findings, the commission concluded that \\"the college has exceeded the original intention of the State when the tract was granted the university for conducting silvicultural experiments.\\"Christopher, Angus. 2002. The Extraordinary Adirondack Journey of Clarence Petty, p 31. Syracuse University Press Lawsuit, decision and appeal The New York State College of Forestry at Cornell was closed in 1903. \\"The Brooklyn Cooperage Company, however, attempted to hold [Cornell] university to its fifteen-year contract for the delivery of a certain amount of lumber. Consequently suit was brought by the people against the company, with the university impleaded, to have the contract annulled.\\"New York Times, \\"Cornell Forestry Case: Appellate Division Decision Against Brooklyn Cooperage Company,\\" July 13, 1906, p.4. During the trial, a forester on Chief Pinchot's staff, Charles S. Chapman, testified on behalf of the plaintiff. He stated that between the two silvicultural methods that might have been adopted‚Äîthe \\"selection system\\" of choosing individual trees for felling or the \\"clear cutting\\" and replanting system‚Äî\\"Fernow had erred in changing to the clear cutting and replanting method.\\"Rodgers, Andrew Denny III. 1951. Bernhard Eduard Fernow: A Story of North American Forestry. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, p. 371. In its judgment, \\"the lower court [found] for the people\\", against Brooklyn Cooperage. Not satisfied with the judgment against it, Brooklyn Cooperage appealed the case to the New York State Supreme Court. \\"Edward M. Shepard appeared for the cooperage company and Edward B. Whitney for the people.\\" On July 12, 1906, the defendant lost again. With \\"Judge Kruse [writing] the opinion ... concurred in by all his colleagues\\", the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York \\"upheld the judgment of the lower court ... but granted leave to the cooperage company to plead again upon payment of the costs...\\" Upon learning of the higher court's decision, Louis Marshall wrote, \\"I hold before me the decision in the case of the People against the Brooklyn Cooperage Company ... the consequence of that [contract] was that this 'tremendous' tract of thirty thousand acres was to be cut down 'flat' from one end of it to the other, in order that the scientific foresters might start a new forest which might mature a hundred years from [when the] contract was entered into. This is scientific forestry?\\"Quoted in Reznikoff, Charles, ed. 1957. Louis Marshall, Champion of Liberty: Selected Papers and Addresses. Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, p. 1020. Implications The lawsuit and its aftermath defined forestry in the United States for a generation.

The weekly protest is held in the presence of surviving comfort women on every Wednesday at noon in front of the Embassy of Japan in Seoul.http://www.womenandwar.net/contents/custom/wednesday_demonstration/main.asp?page_str_menu=151  Background  The weekly protest is led by The Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan, commonly referred to as the Korean Council. The demonstrations take place at noon every Wednesday, the busiest time of the day. The first demonstration was held on January 8, 1992, for the visit of then Prime Minister of Japan Kiichi Miyazawa, and the 1,000th on December 14, 2011. The only Wednesday protest the Korean Council and former comfort women have missed since 1992 was during the Kobe earthquake in Japan in 1995. The Wednesday demonstration was listed in March 2002 in the Guinness Book of Records as the world's oldest rally on a single theme. Such long years of weekly protests are still on going as they believe the Japanese government has not given any sincere official apology to these victims. In 2007, current Prime minister of Japan, Shinzo Abe, mentioned how there was no \\"forceful\\" action of the Japanese government in gathering the women, which is still his stance regarding this issue until the present. In December 2015, there was a deal signed by the government of President Park Geun-hye, incumbent Moon Jae- in's predecessor, and Prime minister Shinzo Abe regarding the comfort women issue, but the protest still went on as the deal was regarded as a lacking deal without the consent of the victims and forced by the Park's government's favor. Such stance has been supported by the new foreign minister of South Korea, Kang Kyung-wha who pinpointed how the two countries are at odds regarding the deal struck in 2015. However, the deal was officially cancelled by the government of President Moon Jae-in in November 2018. August 14, 2019 marked the 1,400th Wednesday Demonstration, the day before the 74th National Liberation Day wherein thousands of people gathered in support of the movement. Korean law prohibits demonstrations around foreign embassies. It is believed that the local government has intentionally left it alone.https://megalodon.jp/2013-0810-1808-36/sankei.jp.msn.com/world/news/130810/kor13081003320000-n1.htm This statement regarding prohibition around foreign embassies have an issue. Article 11 Clause 4 of the Assembly and Demonstration Act of South Korea restricts the protests within 100 meters from the foreign ambassies.First-ever protest encircles the US embassy in Seoul Nonetheless, there are three exceptions. One is the case that the protest is not regarding the diplomatic institution nor residence of diplomats. Another is when the demonstration is expected not to become a large scale. The third is that the demonstration is held on holidays. And the demonstration shall not be obscure the safety of the diplomatic institution nor its members for all three occasions. \\"ÏßëÌöå Î∞è ÏãúÏúÑ, ÏôÑÏ†Ñ ÏûêÏú†Îäî ÏïÑÎãàÎã§?\\" The Wednesday protest falls in the second case. It always keeps its location on the other side of Japanese embassy without occupying the motorway or opposite side, which is deemed to be small size or medium even at largest. In addition, the Japanese embassy moved to a building next to it used to be, further away from the demonstration spot, in 2015. Thus, the location of the protest at present since 2015 is more accurately across the street from former Japanese embassy.  Objectives  According to the Korean Council, the \\"Wednesday Demonstrations have turned into a place for solidarity between citizens and the victims, a living site for history education, a platform for peace and women's human rights, bringing people together in solidarity beyond gender, age, borders, and ideologies.\\" The Korean Council states that they will keep protesting until Korea has considered the rights and dignity fully restored to the victims. Their objective in protesting is \\"the restoration of dignity and human rights of comfort women.\\" The Korean Council's overall objectives in fully resolving the war crimes are: # Acknowledge the war crime. # Reveal the truth in its entirety about the crimes of military sexual slavery. # Make an official apology by the Japanese Government. # Make legal reparations. # Punish those responsible for the war crime. # Accurately record the crime in history textbooks. # Erect a memorial for the victims of military sexual slavery and establish a historical museum. Recently, the Korean government claims to have a fair negotiation with the Japanese government which implements the voice of the victims of sexual slavery which is seen as an improvement from the former agreement. The 2015 settlement that was reached by President Park Geun-hye's ministry was thrown out by current president Moon Jae-in. On November 21, 2018, however, the Japanese-funded comfort women foundation which was launched in July 2016 to finance the controversial negotiated settlement was shut down by President Moon Jae-in ministry after the 2015 agreement was scrapped. On August 14, 2018, the first official memorial day of comfort women was marked in South Korea.https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20180814/p2g/00m/0in/093000c  Pyeonghwaui Sonyeosang The golden bronze statue, \\"Pyeonghwaui Sonyeosang\\" often referred to as (\\"Statue of Peace\\") (), located in Seoul, South Korea, was inaugurated for the 1,000th rally on December 14, 2011. The statue of the Korean girl sitting on a chair facing the former Japanese Embassy represents all of the Korean girls forced into sexual slavery by the Imperial Japanese Army. The bird on her shoulder is symbolic of freedom and peace. The original statue in Seoul has inspired at least a dozen subsequent statues commemorating comfort women including statues in Busan and San Francisco. Nearly all of the statues have been protested or condemned by members of the Japanese government officials and delegates. Repeatedly, Japan has asked for the removal of the \\"comfort women\\" statues in Seoul and Busan.  In media  Activist Meehyang Yoon's book on comfort women and the Wednesday demonstrations, 20 Years of Wednesdays: The Unshakable Hope of the Halmoni - Former Japanese Military Comfort Women (), was published in 2010 in Korean, and translated into Japanese the following year. A follow-up, 25 Years of Wednesdays (), was published in 2016.

Initial stages of particle deposition (top), blocking (middle), ripening (bottom) Particle deposition is the spontaneous attachment of particles to surfaces. The particles in question are normally colloidal particles, while the surfaces involved may be planar, curved, or may represent particles much larger in size than the depositing ones (e.g., sand grains). Deposition processes may be triggered by appropriate hydrodynamic flow conditions and favorable particle- surface interactions. Depositing particles may just form a monolayer which further inhibits additional particle deposition, and thereby one refers to surface blocking. Initially attached particles may also serve as seeds for further particle deposition, which leads to the formation of thicker particle deposits, and this process is termed as surface ripening or fouling. While deposition processes are normally irreversible, initially deposited particles may also detach. The latter process is known as particle release and is often triggered by the addition of appropriate chemicals or a modification in flow conditions. Microorganisms may deposit to surfaces in a similar fashion as colloidal particles. When macromolecules, such as proteins, polymers or polyelectrolytes attach to surfaces, one rather calls this process adsorption. While adsorption of macromolecules largely resembles particle deposition, macromolecules may substantially deform during adsorption. The present article mainly deals with particle deposition from liquids, but similar process occurs when aerosols or dust deposit from the gas phase. Initial stages A particle may diffuse to a surface in quiescent conditions, but this process is inefficient as a thick depletion layer develops, which leads to a progressive slowing down of the deposition. When particle deposition is efficient, it proceeds almost exclusively in a system under flow. In such conditions, the hydrodynamic flow will transport the particles close to the surface. Once a particle is situated close to the surface, it will attach spontaneously, when the particle-surface interactions are attractive. In this situation, one refers to favorable deposition conditions. When the interaction is repulsive at larger distances, but attractive at shorter distances, deposition will still occur but it will be slowed down. One refers to unfavorable deposition conditions here. The initial stages of the deposition process can be described with the rate equationW. B. Russel, D. A. Saville, W. R. Schowalter,Colloidal Dispersions,Cambridge University Press, 1989. : {d \\\\Gamma \\\\over dt } = k c where Œì is the number density of deposited particles, t is the time, c the particle number concentration, and k the deposition rate coefficient. The rate coefficient depends on the flow velocity, flow geometry, and the interaction potential of the depositing particle with the substrate. In many situations, this potential can be approximated by a superposition of attractive van der Waals forces and repulsive electrical double layer forces and can be described by DLVO theory. When the charge of the particles is of the same sign as the substrate, deposition will be favorable at high salt levels, while it will be unfavorable at lower salt levels. When the charge of the particles is of the opposite sign as the substrate, deposition is favorable for all salt levels, and one observes a small enhancement of the deposition rate with decreasing salt level due to attractive electrostatic double layer forces. Initial stages of the deposition process are relatively similar to the early stages of particle heteroaggregation, whereby one of the particles is much larger than the other. Blocking When depositing particles repel each other, the deposition will stop by the time when enough particles have deposited. At one point, such a surface layer will repel any particles that may still make attempts to deposit. The surface is said to be saturated or blocked by the deposited particles. The blocking process can be described by the following equationM. Elimelech, J. Gregory, X. Jia, R. Williams, Particle Deposition and Aggregation: Measurement, Modelling and Simulation, Butterworth-Heinemann, 1998. : {d \\\\Gamma \\\\over dt } = k c B(\\\\Gamma) where B(Œì) is the surface blocking function. When there are no deposited particles, Œì = 0 and B(0) = 1. With increasing number density of deposited particles, the blocking function decreases. The surface saturates at Œì=Œì0 and B(Œì0) = 0. The simplest blocking function isZ. Adamczyk, Adv. Colloid Interface Sci. 2003, 100, 267-347. : B(\\\\Gamma) = 1-\\\\Gamma/\\\\Gamma_0 and it is referred to as the Langmuir blocking function, as it is related to the Langmuir isotherm. Jamming in the random sequential adsorption (RSA) of circular disks. The blocking process has been studied in detail in terms of the random sequential adsorption (RSA) model.J. W. Evans, Rev. Mod. Phys. 65 (1993) 1281-1329. The simplest RSA model related to deposition of spherical particles considers irreversible adsorption of circular disks. One disk after another is placed randomly at a surface. Once a disk is placed, it sticks at the same spot, and cannot be removed. When an attempt to deposit a disk would result in an overlap with an already deposited disk, this attempt is rejected. Within this model, the surface is initially filled rapidly, but the more one approaches saturation the slower the surface is being filled. Within the RSA model, saturation is referred to as jamming. For circular disks, jamming occurs at a coverage of 0.547. When the depositing particles are polydisperse, much higher surface coverage can be reached, since the small particles will be able to deposit into the holes in between the larger deposited particles. On the other hand, rod like particles may lead to much smaller coverage, since a few misaligned rods may block a large portion of the surface. Since the repulsion between particles in aqueous suspensions originates from electric double layer forces, the presence of salt has an important effect on surface blocking. For small particles and low salt, the diffuse layer will extend far beyond the particle, and thus create an exclusion zone around it. Therefore, the surface will be blocked at a much lower coverage than what would be expected based on the RSA model.M. R. Bohmer, E. A. van der Zeeuw, G. J. M. Koper, J. Colloid Interface Sci. 197 (1998) 242-250. At higher salt and for larger particles, this effect is less important, and the deposition can be well described by the RSA model. Ripening When the depositing particles attract each other, they will deposit and aggregate at the same time. This situation will result in a porous layer made of particle aggregates at the surface, and is referred to as ripening. The porosity of this layer will depend whether the particle aggregation process is fast or slow. Slow aggregation will lead to a more compact layer, while fast aggregation to a more porous one. The structure of the layer will resemble the structure of the aggregates formed in the later stages of the aggregation process. Experimental techniques Particle deposition can be followed by various experimental techniques. Direct observation of deposited particles is possible with an optical microscope, scanning electron microscope, or the atomic force microscope. Optical microscopy has the advantage that the deposition of particles can be followed in real time by video techniques and the sequence of images can be analyzed quantitatively.Y. Luthi, J. Ricka, J. Colloid Interface Sci. 206 (1998) 302-313. On the other hand, the resolution of optical microscopy requires that the particle size investigated exceeds at least 100 nm. An alternative is to use surface sensitive techniques to follow particle deposition, such as reflectivity, ellipsometry, surface plasmon resonance, or quartz crystal microbalance. These techniques can provide information on the amount of particles deposited as a function of time with good accuracy, but they do not permit to obtain information concerning the lateral arrangement of the particles. Another approach to study particle deposition is to investigate their transport in a chromatographic column. The column is packed with large particles or with a porous medium to be investigated. Subsequently, the column is flushed with the solvent to be investigated, and the suspension of the small particles is injected at the column inlet. The particles are detected at the outlet with a standard chromatographic detector. When particles deposit in the porous medium, they will not arrive at the outlet, and from the observed difference the deposition rate coefficient can be inferred. Relevance Particle deposition occurs in numerous natural and industrial systems. Few examples are given below. * Coatings and surface functionalization. Paints and adhesives often are concentrated suspensions of colloidal particles, and in order to adhere well to the surface the particles must deposit to the surface in question. Deposits of a monolayer of colloidal particles can be used to pattern the surface on a Œºm or nm scale, a process referred to as colloidal lithography.R. Michel, I. Reviakine, D. S. Sutherland, G. Fokas, G. Csucs, G. Danuser, N. D. Spencer, M. Textor, Langmuir 18 (2002) 8580-8586. * Filters and filtration membranes. When particle deposit to filters or filtration membranes, they lead to pore clogging a membrane fouling.X. Zhu, M. Elimelech, Environ. Sci. Technol. 31 (1997) 3654-3662. When designing well functioning membranes, particle deposition must be avoided, and proper functionalization of the membranes is essential. * Deposition of microorganisms. Microorganisms may deposit similarly to colloidal particles. This deposition is a desired phenomenon in subsurface waters, as the aquifer filters out eventually injected microorganisms during the recharge of aquifers.S. F. Simoni, H. Harms, T. N. P. Bosma, A. J. B. Zehnder, Environ. Sci. Technol. 32 (1998) 2100-2105 On the other hand, such deposition is highly undesired at the surface of human teeth as it represent the origin of dental plaques. Deposition of microorganisms is also relevant in the formation of biofilms.

The reactor is designed to generate 880 MW of electrical power. The plant was considered part of the weapons-grade Plutonium Management and Disposition Agreement signed between the United States and Russia, with the reactor being part of the final step for a plutonium-burner core. (a core designed to burn and, in the process, destroy, and recover energy from, plutonium) http://scienceandglobalsecurity.org/archive/sgs22kutt.pdf The plant reached its full power production in August, 2016. According to Russian business journal Kommersant, the BN-800 project cost 140.6 billion rubles (roughly 2.17 billion dollars). Design The plant is a pool-type LMFBR, in which the reactor, coolant pumps, intermediate heat exchangers and associated piping are all located in a common liquid sodium pool. The design of this plant was started in 1983 and was completely revised in 1987 after the Chernobyl Disaster and to a somewhat lesser degree in 1993, according to the new safety guidelines. After the second revision, the electric output power was increased by 10% to 880 MW due to the increased efficiency of the planned power generator steam turbines. The reactor core is, in size and mechanical properties, very similar to the BN-600 reactor core, but the fuel composition is very different. While BN-600 uses medium-enriched uranium dioxide, this plant burns mixed uranium-plutonium fuel, helping to reduce the weapon-grade plutonium stockpile and provide information about the functioning of the closed uranium-plutonium fuel cycle. It was highlighted that the closed cycle will not require plutonium separation or other chemical processing. The unit employs a three-circuit coolant arrangement; sodium coolant circulates in both the primary and secondary circuits. Water and steam flow in the third circuit. This heat is transferred from the reactor core via several independent circulation loops. Each comprises a primary sodium pump, two intermediate heat exchangers, a secondary sodium pump with an expansion tank located upstream, and an emergency pressure discharge tank. These feed a steam generator, which in turn supplies a condensing turbine that turns the generator. Many infrastructure facilities were designed to accommodate both the BN-800 and a proposed follow on BN-1200 reactor. History The construction of BN-800 started in 1983 as Unit 4 at the Beloyarsk nuclear power plant but was put on hold after the 1986 Chernobyl accident. It resumed in 2006 and BN-800 achieved minimum controlled power in 2014, but issues led to further fuel development work. On 31 July 2015, the unit achieved minimum controlled power again, at 0.13% of rated power. Commercial operations was expected to start before the end of 2016, with a power rating of 789 MWe. The reactor was connected to the electricity grid in February 2016 and achieved full power for the first time in August 2016. Commercial power production started on November 1, 2016. With both the United States and Russia reaching an agreement in 2001 to render a joint 34 tons of weapons grade plutonium, into reactor grade plutonium alongside reaching the spent fuel standard, that is mixed with the other more highly radioactive products within spent fuel.Pavel Podvig: Can the US-Russia plutonium disposition agreement be saved? Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, 28. April 2016. US president Barack Obama canceled construction of the agreement-supporting US MOX fuel fabrication facility in 2016, citing cost overruns and for financial reasons proposing instead that for the US share of plutonium, it be diluted with non-radioactive material and disposed in the underground WIPP facility. However, the dilution could be reversed, and the material reconverted into weapons-grade plutonium. On October 3, 2016, Russian president Vladimir Putin ordered the agreement to be suspended because the US did not meet their obligations.–£–∫–∞–∑ –ü—Ä–µ–∑–∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ç–∞ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–π –§–µ–¥–µ—Ä–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –æ—Ç 03.10.2016 ‚Ññ 511 (in Russian).

The film is based on the comic strip K√∂tu Kedi ≈ûerafettin by B√ºlent √úst√ºn. A game based on the film, titled The Bad Cat, was released on mobile devices shortly after the film's release. Plot Shero, a crass and short-tempered cat owned by a man named Tank, has sent his associates, Rifki the seagull and Riza the rat, to obtain liquor for a barbecue that night. Another cat, Black, informs Shero of an attractive Siamese cat named Princess in a nearby apartment. When her cartoonist owner leaves for work, Shero and Black sneak into the apartment to seduce Princess, but she accidentally kills herself in a panic. The cartoonist returns home to find Princess dead, and furiously attacks Shero and Black. Black is killed, and Shero engages the cartoonist in a fight that results in the cartoonist's death when they both tumble out the window. On his way back home, Shero meets a young cat named Taco, who claims to be Shero's illegitimate son. Shero rejects Taco and goes to steal some fish from Hazel, Tank's landlady. Hazel retaliates by threatening Tank with eviction unless he can cover months of unpaid rent by the next day. An angered Tank ejects Shero from his home and blocks every potential entrance. While smoking and sulking, Shero witnesses a beautiful Angora cat named Misscat being harassed by a pair of dogs and rescues her by beating her assailants. Shero attempts to seduce Misscat, but is turned down and told to meet her again on the same rooftop that night. Meanwhile, the brainless cadaver of the cartoonist is revived by an ambulance defibrillator. The cartoonist hijacks the ambulance and begins a vengeful search for Shero. As Shero obtains a bouquet for Misscat, the cartoonist finds the two dogs and forces them to lead him to Shero; Taco, who was rummaging for food, witnesses this transaction and follows them. Shero and Misscat rendezvous and prepare to make love when they are captured and tied up by the dogs and the cartoonist. Before the cartoonist can electrocute Shero, Taco appears and frees Shero, who fights the cartoonist and throws him off the building and into a dumpster, along with the dogs. Taco is once again brushed off by Shero, and he reveals that his mother, a past mate of Shero's named Mimosa, is dead. Shero and Taco bond after a brief exchange of fists, and Taco helps Shero attempt to obtain liquor from the local grocer. However, the cartoonist, having hijacked a passing garbage truck, absconds with Taco during the mission, forcing Shero into a chase. Shero rescues Taco as the garbage truck plunges into the sea, and Shero once more kills the cartoonist in an underwater fight. As Shero and Taco make their return home, Hazel chases off Misscat and installs barbed wire to further prevent Shero's entry. The cartoonist's body is lifted out of the sea by a rescue team, and he is once again revived when his body comes into contact with power wires. After Rifki and Riza's latest attempt to retrieve liquor ends in failure, Riza proposes to Shero that they can all get what they want by robbing a bank. The cartoonist is apprehended by the police, but he hijacks the police car when the bank's robbery is reported. As Shero and the group make their getaway, Taco takes a bullet for Shero from the cartoonist. Shero, believing Taco to be dead, discards the stolen money into a crowd of people in his grief, and he leaves with Taco's body in the confusion. Tank comes across Shero and Taco and takes them back home in the absence of available veterinarians. Tank and Shero successfully treat Taco's bullet wound and revive him, and Rifki and Riza return with a single pack of money from the robbery, which is used to clear all of Shero and Tank's debts. The last of the money is used to hold Shero's barbecue. The celebration is cut short by the arrival of the cartoonist, who has taken Misscat hostage.

The hospital which opened in 1888 and closed in 1994 initially treated Smallpox but soon broadened its treatment to other infectious diseases and in its latter years expanded to provide more general nursing, notably spinal injuries and chest medicine. At the time of closure, the hospital was operated by the Central Sheffield University Hospitals NHS Trust. History Lodge Moor hospital was erected as a result of the Sheffield smallpox epidemic of 1887-1888. Despite the increasing number of vaccinations, the disease remained virulent and the one way of keeping it in check was to isolate those with the disease from the healthy members of society. With this in mind Sheffield Corporation sought permission of the Local Government Board to borrow ¬£12,000 to build an isolation hospital. The Board granted the request and the Council appointed the building contractors W. Bissett & Sons to build the hospital on an area of rough moorland called Lodge Moor on the western outskirts of the city. The hospital was built at the high altitude of 290 metres (950 feet) above sea level as it was thought that this would give the necessary fresh air to patients. The smallpox epidemic stressed the importance of building the hospital quickly and a working party of 300 men were set to work around the clock, within two months twelve wards had been erected to house 156 patients. Each of these wards were made from wood and were viewed as just temporary structures, they could accommodate ten patients and had a composting toilet, storeroom and a bedroom for a nurse. In 1892 the first stone wards were built although it would be 1935 before the temporary wooden huts would be demolished. By the turn of the century the diminishing number of smallpox patients due to widespread vaccination made it possible for Lodge Moor to admit patients suffering from other contagious diseases such as scarlet fever, diphtheria and typhoid fever. Further expansion to the hospital completed in 1905 saw the addition of the six South wards, the main lodge, waiting room and the square tower which is a conspicuous landmark in the surrounding area. The 1918 flu pandemic and the ensuing vastly increased number of admissions, severely overstretched the hospital‚Äôs capacity and it was only the assistance of voluntary nurses which allowed the regular staff to cope. By the early 1920s the hospital could accommodate 434 patients. 1925 saw a severe outbreak of smallpox and Lodge Moor was stretched to overcapacity, so much so that the nearby Redmires Army Camp was utilised as an Auxiliary Hospital for isolation cases, using staff and equipment borrowed from Lodge Moor. Redmires Camp Hospital remained in use until around 1935. 1928 saw further expansion to Lodge Moor with the central 5 and 6 wards and a separation ward built at a cost of ¬£53,000, 1935 the North 5 and 6 wards were built and the final demolition of the temporary wooden huts which had served since 1888. By 1950 the hospital could accommodate 508 infectious disease patients, in 1953 three wards were converted to a Paraplegic Unit and in 1954 the hospital took on the role of treating the spinal injuries (from road crashes and pit and factory accidents) for the whole of the Sheffield Regional Hospital Board area.\\"Reminiscing Around Rivelin\\", Roy Davey, , Page 17, Gives history of hospital. In May 1956 the patients from Crimicar Lane Hospital and Commonside Sanatorium were transferred to Lodge Moor when those units were closed by the Sheffield Regional Hospital Board. =1955 jet crash= On 9 December 1955 the hospital was hit by a Republic F-84F Thunderstreak aircraft of the United States Air Force. The aircraft had taken off from RAF Sculthorpe in Norfolk on an instrument training flight and had experienced a flameout, a problem which dogged the aircraft throughout its career. Despite several attempts to restart the engine, the pilot, Roy G. Evans bailed out over the Derbyshire village of Hathersage leaving the aircraft to carry on in flight and hit Lodge Moor Hospital. The aircraft hit the North 1 and 2 wards, tearing the roof off a single story cubicle ward, demolishing a corridor, ploughing 200 feet through a sanitary block, and then bursting into flames on a lawn facing the mortuary. The crash killed one patient, Mrs. Elsie Murdoch of Sheffield and injured seven others. =Modern times= Operation of the hospital was transferred from the Sheffield Health Authority (dissolved on 1 April 1992) to the newly- created Central Sheffield University Hospitals NHS Trust on 1 November 1991, who continued to operate the hospital until its closure. Shortly after its formation, the Trust decided to merge the operations of Lodge Moor Hospital, located on the outskirts of the city, into its existing sites closer to the city centre. Subsequently, the hospital was closed in September 1994; infectious diseases were moved to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital, while the chest and spinal injuries units were moved to the Northern General Hospital. The main hospital building including the tower has now been integrated into private residential accommodation built by the developers David Wilson Homes.

History The airfield was built in 1918, and had its first building in 1924, the same year it was officially opened. From 1926 it was regularly serviced by airliners, primarily Lufthansa. The first successful airplane tow of a glider was done at Waldau airfield on 12 March 1927 by World War I flying ace and aerobatic champion Gerhard Fieseler in the tow plane and Gottlob Espenlaub in the glider. Gerhard Fieseler set up his aircraft production plants at Kassel from 1930 as Fieseler Flugzeugbau. One of them (Werk III, or Plant III) was at Waldau airfield, another one ony one mile from the airfield. That same year the airline connection ended, when Waldau had to close as a city airfield because Kassel could no longer afford to pay Lufthansa for its services or the maintenance of the airfield. Ownership of the airfield was then transferred to the Lower Hessian Association for Aviation. Still, the airfield remained open, and it attracted a 100,000 crowd during the visit of a Zeppelin airship in September 1930. Aircraft Fieseler produced at Waldau amongst others:. * Fieseler Fi 2 a German aerobatic biplane built in the 1930s. * Fieseler Fi 5 a single-engined two-seat sportplane of the 1930s, and later used as a Luftwaffe trainer. * Fieseler Fi 98, a prototype ground-attack aircraft (before World War II). * Fieseler Fi 167 a biplane torpedo and reconnaissance bomber designed for the new aircraft carriers being planned. (before World War II). * Fieseler Fi 156 Storch, a STOL observation/liaison aircraft (from 1936 until 1943). * Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter (licence production). * Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighter (licence production, from 1943 onwards). * Fieseler Fi 103, better known as the V-1 flying bomb \\"Buzz bomb\\", an early pulse-jet-powered predecessor of the cruise missile (1944-1945). At times the plants used 10,000 working men and women, many of them slave labor from the Netherlands and France. As a result, the Fieseler plants regularly were attacked by American Eighth Air Force and British RAF Bomber Command aircraft, and although some damage was done to the plants, most destruction occurred in the city itself. The damaged airfield was seized by American Army units on 4 April 1945. The damaged airfield was repaired by IX Engineering Command, Ninth Air Force and re-designated as \\"Advanced Landing Ground Y-96\\". American Army Air Force units used the airfield as a casualty evacuation and combat resupply airfield by the IX Air Service Command, as well as a combat airfield by the 48th Fighter Group with P-47 Thunderbolts operating for two weeks until the German capitulation on 8 May. After the end of combat, the facility was re-designed as \\"AAF Station Kassel/Waldau\\" and later Waldau Tactical Air Depot (TAD) under Air Service Command, operated by 10th Air Depot Group. In November 1945, Air Force units moved out and control of the facility was turned over to the United States Army. The airfield remained closed to civilian traffic until 29 April 1955, when it was returned to the city of Kassel for civilian use as an airport, the US Army retaining control of the base station and renaming the facility \\"Waldau Kaserne\\". The Army used the station for vehicle maintenance by 547th Ordnance Co which supported transportation units. In 1970, the Army inactivated the facility. By the early 1960s, however, urban encroachment in the area made it clear the civil airport could not remain open much longer. It was located in the eastern side of the city with no room for expansion and residential areas were becoming hard to avoid. When the city of Kassel opened a new airport to the north of the city in July 1970, Waldau was closed and converted to an industrial area. The airfield remained in existence until the 1980s, when it was torn up and the area redeveloped. References * Y-96 Kassel/Waldau * Kassel Waldau AFA * Johnson, David C.

Amend in 1880. He founded the Catholic News in 1886, later continued by his brother Henry Ridder. In 1890 he became trustee and manager, and in 1907 president of the New Yorker Staats-Zeitung, then the largest and most influential daily paper printed in the German language in the United States. During the visit of Prince Henry of Prussia in February 1903, Ridder arranged a dinner in Henry's honor. In 1908 he was treasurer of the Democratic National Committee, where he insisted on campaign finance transparency. He was an official of several important financial institutions. In 1917, after his death, the U.S. declared war on Germany. In 1918 George Sylvester Viereck told federal officials that in 1915 Ridder planned a to purchase a newspaper on behalf of propaganda for the German government. Ridder's son said he was very sick at the time and did no such planning. There was no such purchase. He died insolvent, having lost his means with the failure of the International Typesetting Machine Company at the start of World War I. Friends and supporters of Ridder assumed the debts of his publishing enterprise, and the Staats-Zeitung continued under the joint management of his sons, Bernard H. Ridder and Victor F.

The technique is used for both hypothesis testing and model building. In both these uses, models are tested to find the most parsimonious (i.e., least complex) model that best accounts for the variance in the observed frequencies. (A Pearson's chi-square test could be used instead of log-linear analysis, but that technique only allows for two of the variables to be compared at a time.) Fitting criterion Log-linear analysis uses a likelihood ratio statistic \\\\Chi^2 that has an approximate chi-square distribution when the sample size is large: :\\\\Chi^2 = 2\\\\sum O_{ij} \\\\ln \\\\frac{O_{ij}}{E_{ij}}, where :\\\\ln = natural logarithm; :O_{ij} = observed frequency in cellij (i = row and j = column); :E_{ij} = expected frequency in cellij. :\\\\Chi^2 = the deviance for the model. Assumptions There are three assumptions in log-linear analysis: 1\\\\. The observations are independent and random; 2\\\\. Observed frequencies are normally distributed about expected frequencies over repeated samples. This is a good approximation if both (a) the expected frequencies are greater than or equal to 5 for 80% or more of the categories and (b) all expected frequencies are greater than 1. Violations to this assumption result in a large reduction in power. Suggested solutions to this violation are: delete a variable, combine levels of one variable (e.g., put males and females together), or collect more data. 3\\\\. The logarithm of the expected value of the response variable is a linear combination of the explanatory variables. This assumption is so fundamental that it is rarely mentioned, but like most linearity assumptions, it is rarely exact and often simply made to obtain a tractable model. Additionally, data should always be categorical. Continuous data can first be converted to categorical data, with some loss of information. With both continuous and categorical data, it would be best to use logistic regression. (Any data that is analysed with log-linear analysis can also be analysed with logistic regression. The technique chosen depends on the research questions.)  Variables  In log-linear analysis there is no clear distinction between what variables are the independent or dependent variables. The variables are treated the same. However, often the theoretical background of the variables will lead the variables to be interpreted as either the independent or dependent variables.  Models  The goal of log-linear analysis is to determine which model components are necessary to retain in order to best account for the data. Model components are the number of main effects and interactions in the model. For example, if we examine the relationship between three variables‚Äîvariable A, variable B, and variable C‚Äîthere are seven model components in the saturated model. The three main effects (A, B, C), the three two-way interactions (AB, AC, BC), and the one three-way interaction (ABC) gives the seven model components. The log-linear models can be thought of to be on a continuum with the two extremes being the simplest model and the saturated model. The simplest model is the model where all the expected frequencies are equal. This is true when the variables are not related. The saturated model is the model that includes all the model components. This model will always explain the data the best, but it is the least parsimonious as everything is included. In this model, observed frequencies equal expected frequencies, therefore in the likelihood ratio chi- square statistic, the ratio \\\\frac{O_{ij}}{E_{ij}}=1 and \\\\ln(1)=0. This results in the likelihood ratio chi-square statistic being equal to 0, which is the best model fit. Other possible models are the conditional equiprobability model and the mutual dependence model. Each log-linear model can be represented as a log-linear equation. For example, with the three variables (A, B, C) the saturated model has the following log-linear equation: :\\\\ln(F_{ijk})=\\\\lambda + \\\\lambda^A + \\\\lambda^B +\\\\lambda^C + \\\\lambda^{AB} + \\\\lambda^{AC}+ \\\\lambda^{BC} + \\\\lambda^{ABC}, \\\\, where :F_{ijk} = expected frequency in cellijk; :\\\\lambda = the relative weight of each variable. = Hierarchical model = Log-linear analysis models can be hierarchical or nonhierarchical. Hierarchical models are the most common. These models contain all the lower order interactions and main effects of the interaction to be examined. = Graphical model = A log-linear model is graphical if, whenever the model contains all two-factor terms generated by a higher-order interaction, the model also contains the higher-order interaction. As a direct-consequence, graphical models are hierarchical. Moreover, being completely determined by its two-factor terms, a graphical model can be represented by an undirected graph, where the vertices represent the variables and the edges represent the two-factor terms included in the model. = Decomposable model = A log-linear model is decomposable if it is graphical and if the corresponding graph is chordal. = Model fit = The model fits well when the residuals (i.e., observed-expected) are close to 0, that is the closer the observed frequencies are to the expected frequencies the better the model fit. If the likelihood ratio chi-square statistic is non-significant, then the model fits well (i.e., calculated expected frequencies are close to observed frequencies). If the likelihood ratio chi-square statistic is significant, then the model does not fit well (i.e., calculated expected frequencies are not close to observed frequencies). Backward elimination is used to determine which of the model components are necessary to retain in order to best account for the data. Log-linear analysis starts with the saturated model and the highest order interactions are removed until the model no longer accurately fits the data. Specifically, at each stage, after the removal of the highest ordered interaction, the likelihood ratio chi-square statistic is computed to measure how well the model is fitting the data. The highest ordered interactions are no longer removed when the likelihood ratio chi-square statistic becomes significant.  Comparing models  When two models are nested, models can also be compared using a chi-square difference test. The chi-square difference test is computed by subtracting the likelihood ratio chi-square statistics for the two models being compared. This value is then compared to the chi-square critical value at their difference in degrees of freedom. If the chi-square difference is smaller than the chi-square critical value, the new model fits the data significantly better and is the preferred model. Else, if the chi-square difference is larger than the critical value, the less parsimonious model is preferred.  Follow-up tests  Once the model of best fit is determined, the highest-order interaction is examined by conducting chi-square analyses at different levels of one of the variables. To conduct chi-square analyses, one needs to break the model down into a 2 √ó 2 or 2 √ó 1 contingency table. For example, if one is examining the relationship among four variables, and the model of best fit contained one of the three-way interactions, one would examine its simple two-way interactions at different levels of the third variable.  Effect sizes  To compare effect sizes of the interactions between the variables, odds ratios are used. Odds ratios are preferred over chi-square statistics for two main reasons: 1\\\\. Odds ratios are independent of the sample size; 2\\\\. Odds ratios are not affected by unequal marginal distributions.

Rifka Weehuizen(2008): http://www.merit.unu.edu/training/theses/Thesis_Weehuizen_final.pdfUK Government Office for Science(2008): Mental Capital and Well Being: Making the Most of Ourselves in the 21st Century Final ReportGary Becker(1965) ‚ÄúA Theory of Allocation of Time‚Äù Economic Journal, 75(299) 493-517 This term is first introduced by the economist Lok Sang Ho in his book Principles of Public Policy Practice, (Kluwer Academic Publishers, 2001).Ho, Lok Sang, Public Policy and the Public Interest, Routledge, 2012 Summary \\"Mental capital is related to the concept of psychological capital... In the psychology literature, psychological capital is usually taken to comprise hope, self- efficacy, optimism, and resiliency. These four cornerstones of psychological capital are all attitudinal. Mental capital is not only positive attitudes but also includes certain key skills that allow one to produce such mental goods as self-esteem and sense of achievement, as well as self-reflective skills.\\"(Ho, 2012, p. 44) Mental capital is also related to the concept of immaterial economic capital, as used in the German Historical tradition of economics ('Geistiges Kapital'). It refers to both individual, social and collective capacities, as well as both actual and historically accumulated immaterial capital. Early German economists who used this concept were e.g. Adam M√ºller and Friedrich List. Mental capital is related to habit formation. When habit is formed, to the extent that it serves the interest of the individual over the long term, it is mental capital. To the extent that a habit hurts the interest of the individual over the long term, it is negative mental capital. Negative mental capital will take a long time to be transformed because habits are notoriously difficult to break. Related publication Since then much work has been done by psychologists. In 2008, two significant studies on the subject were published, one by the UK Department for Innovation, Business, and Skills through the British Government Office for Science, entitled Mental Capital and Well Being, the other by a doctorate student at the Universitaire Pers Maastricht. The UK Report defines mental capital as encompassing \\"a person‚Äôs cognitive and emotional resources. It includes their cognitive ability, how flexible and efficient they are at learning, and their 'emotional intelligence', such as their social skills and resilience in the face of stress. It refers to emotional capital (Gendron, 2004, 2011, 2014) and the set of 'emotional competence' . It therefore conditions how well an individual is able to contribute effectively to society, and also to experience a high personal quality of life.\\" Lok Sang Ho sees mental capital as an input into the production of such \\"mental goods\\" as sense of security, self-esteem, inner peace, confidence, sense of autonomy, etc. Production of mental goods, like the production of physical \\"end goods\\" that enter a person's utility function, is seen to be part of household activity that may include market goods and the time of the person as an input. The latter theory of household production owes to the work of economics Nobel Laureate Gary Becker, particularly his 1965 Economic Journal article. Notes  References  Gendron B. (2004).

She served as an agent and advisor to James III \\"The Old Pretender\\" after the death of his father in 1701. Eleanor married in 1707 Eug√®ne Marie de B√©thisy, Marquis de M√©zi√®res, with whom she had seven children; their descendants include members of royal families throughout Europe.Ettinger 1968, pp. 19, 56, 68‚Äì78, 305.Hill 1977, pp. 68‚Äì70. Family Eleanor Oglethorpe‚Äôs mother, also Eleanor Oglethorpe (n√©e Wall), was an employee of the royal household during the reigns of Charles II and James II; she followed the latter to France, where he was exiled after the Glorious Revolution. Eleanor‚Äôs father, Theophilus Oglethorpe, also offered his service to James, but as a Protestant he was eventually sidelined. Theophilus and the elder Eleanor returned to Westbrook, their estate outside London, where they remained secretly and actively in the service of the Jacobite cause. Eleanor‚Äôs brother was James Edward Oglethorpe, who was raised at the family‚Äôs Westbrook estate. He later became a reformer in Parliament, the founder of the Georgia Colony, an officer in the army of Frederick the Great, and a prominent figure among London intellectuals in the Age of Johnson. James spent considerable time in Paris with sister Eleanor after his service with Frederick. Jacobite activities Eleanor and her sisters Molly and Fanny, all of whom married into French nobility, were strong supporters of the Jacobite cause. Eleanor‚Äôs Paris townhouse was a hub of Jacobite activity and a shelter for co-conspirators. When Henry St John, Lord Bolingbroke joined the cause, Eleanor and her husband associated with him in Paris. When Bolingbroke betrayed the cause, it was Eleanor who discovered his secret communication with authorities in London hidden in a house she owned used as the British ambassador‚Äôs residence.Hill 1977, pp. 56‚Äì58.Monod, Paul Kleber. ‚ÄúDangerous Merchandise: Smuggling, Jacobitism, and Commercial Culture in Southeast England, 1690‚Äì1760‚Äù.

At Westbrook, Eleanor‚Äôs mother and her older sister Anne were involved in coordinating Jacobite plots to overthrow George I, who succeeded Queen Anne. Evidence suggests that they ran a smuggling operation from their estate to raise funds for the cause. A secret tunnel from the town of Godalming to the house at Westbrook allowed for clandestine meetings. James III‚Äôs son, the Young Pretender, may have stayed there during a clandestine trip to England.Hill 1977, pp. 111‚Äì12. As a result of their Jacobite intrigues, myths developed around the Oglethorpes. In one instance, James III was rumored to be born an Oglethorpe boy, switched at birth when the actual Stuart heir died in 1689. In another, Eleanor‚Äôs sisters Anne and Fanny were variously called Queen Oglethorpe or Her Oglethorpean Majesty, in the belief one or the other was mistress to James III.Lang 1904, 214‚Äì37. French Mississippi Company Eleanor Oglethorpe was an early backer of the French Mississippi Company, and recruited colonists to settle the lower Mississippi region. The enterprise was expected to accelerate settlement and trade in France‚Äôs Louisiana colony. Stock in the company was oversold, creating an investment bubble that burst in 1720. Eleanor and her husband sold her stock before the collapse, greatly increasing their wealth.Hill 1977, pp. 59‚Äì61. References Bibliography *Ettinger, Amos Aschbach.

Background Entering the 1979 MLB Season, the union as well as the umpires were unhappy with the arbiters' working conditions. The highest salary an umpire could make was just under $40,000 per year for over 170 games (compared to $60,000 for a NBA official working fewer than 100 games at the time), little to no in-season vacation time, and very little protection against management. \\"The umpires have kept this game honest for 100 years,\\" Ron Luciano explained to a reporter, in 1978. \\"We're the only segment of the game that has never been touched by scandal. We gotta be too dumb to cheat. We must have integrity, because we sure don't have a normal family life. We certainly aren't properly paid. We have no health care, no job security, no tenure. Our pension plan is a joke. We take more abuse than any living group of humans, and can't give back any. If we're fired without notice, our only recourse is to appeal to the league president. And he's the guy that fires you. That's gotta be unconstitutional!\\"Boswell, T. (September 3, 1978). Long-Suffering Umpires Want A Turn at Bat. Washington Post, retrieved June 13, 2016. Strike Action Though the umpires were under contract through the 1981 season, most remained dissatisfied with its terms. As Luciano explained, \\"Baseball's big shots have been ignoring us for 18 months since we signed that contract. It was agreed that we could still discuss and negotiate matters that were not specifically covered in that contract. But they won't even talk to us. It's like we don't exist. They can dress us up in blue suits, but they don't want to be seen in public with us. Baseball is making us mad, and you know how umpires get when they're mad.\\" In lieu of a formal \\"strike\\" the umpires simply refused to sign their 1979 contracts at the salaries offered, per instruction of union head Richie Phillips. Only two umpires, Paul Pryor of the National League, a 16-year veteran, and Ted Hendry of the American League, a rookie ump, signed their contracts before the union action occurred. Hendry was advised by Phillips to work, and they would both join the union in strike actions later.The Southeast Missourian, \\"Pryor ready to see strike end\\" 2 Apr 1979 The leagues made arrangements to use retired and amateur umpires to work the final week of Spring Training, including bringing up eight minor league umpires, including Dave Pallone, Steve Fields, Fred Brocklander and Lanny Harris to the National League and Derryl Cousins, Dallas Parks, Fred Spenn, and John Shulock in the American League. Attempts to force the umpires to go back to work failed as the courts refused to force the umpires to return to work.Schenectady Gazette, \\"Court can't force umpires to return to work\\" 27 Mar 1979 The season began on April 4, 1979; Pryor worked home plate for the traditional Opening Day game in Cincinnati between the Reds and the San Francisco Giants, while Hendry began his American League assignment the next day, accompanied by amateur and retired umpires. At both locations the striking umps picketed outside the stadiums, dressed in their official umpire uniforms. After Opening Day, Pryor had decided to return to the picket lines, but was asked to return by Phillips, who informed Pryor he had to give 10 days' notice to avoid paying hefty fines. Hendry did the same and both left MLB ten days later.Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, \\"Umps order Pryor back to work\\" 9 Apr 1979 https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ss1RAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=W20DAAAAIBAJ&pg;=5375,1298231&dq;=umpire+strike+1979&hl;=en The players and managers complained about the replacement umps missing calls, even admitting them in some cases,The Day, \\"Brewers beat Red Sox\\" 18 Apr 1979 https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qCIoAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=tXIFAAAAIBAJ&pg;=3490,3088848&dq;=umpire+strike+1979&hl;=en and the complaints seemed to grow each day.

The agreement was formally signed on May 18; as a result, replacement umpires worked the famous game on May 17 between the Philadelphia Phillies and the Chicago Cubs that was won by the Phillies, 23-22. Replacement Umps Another of the settlement's conditions was that the eight umpires that were hired as \\"replacements\\" during the strike would be retained, provided they maintained satisfactory performance (though Phillips claimed they were given additional credit not available to the veterans and the NL replacements were granted an extra week of vacation, charges denied by both the NL and MLB).Reading Eagle, \\"Feeney Denies Allegation\\" 12 Sep 1980 https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=n94hAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=LqIFAAAAIBAJ&pg;=4037,781211&dq;=umpire+strike+1979&hl;=en This resulted in animosity between the veteran umpires and the rookies that the strikers regarded as \\"scabs\\"; since they crossed picket lines, they were not allowed to join the MLUA.

Two replacement umpires remained in MLB after the 1999 labor dispute, which led to the decertification of the Major League Umpires Association in a move led by American League umpire John Hirschbeck, who led the new leadership group, the World Umpires Association, which the National Labor Relations Board approved on February 24, 2000. Both remaining replacement umpires were granted membership into the Hirschbeck-led organisation. * 2002 - John Shulock (AL) * 2012 - Derryl Cousins (AL) Shulock retired in 2002, and Cousins, the last remaining replacement umpire still in MLB and the last umpire to have worn the AL's red blazer, retired in 2012. Aftermath The strike made players, managers, and fans more aware of the umpires' working conditions and their fight for improvements gave the arbiters more respect and games ran more smoothly after the regular umpires returned. The labor problems did not disappear, however, as the umps staged another walkout during the 1984 American League Championship Series that resulted in replacement umps working the entire series (with retired AL umpire Bill Deegan calling balls and strikes for all three games wearing the balloon protector‚Äîthe last time an AL umpire did so in LCS play), and the 1984 National League Championship Series, which was worked by replacements until Game 5, when an agreement was reached. Other labor actions between the umpires and owners occurred in 1991, 1995, and culminated in the 1999 Major League Umpires Association mass resignation.

Selection of initial points An example of cadastral survey starting at the initial point Initial point marker for Utah, located at the southeast corner of Temple Square in Salt Lake City. A principal meridian and base line are usually established based on a preselected initial point, often some distinct geographical feature. As an example, the first established initial point in California was the Mount Diablo meridian. It was chosen because the summit of Mount Diablo could be seen for many miles around and could be referenced for surveys. In other cases, a meridian and a base line were chosen separately based on other geographical features. For example, the Fifth principal meridian in the new Louisiana Purchase was established in 1815, with its southern end based on the confluence of the Arkansas and Mississippi Rivers, and extended northward from that point. The eastern end of the base line was chosen as the confluence of the St. Francis and Mississippi Rivers and extended westward. The initial point would be established where the meridian and the base line crossed, which turned out to be in the middle of a swamp in eastern Arkansas. This point is now located in the Louisiana Purchase State Park. Some initial points were chosen based on existing markers. The initial point for the Gila and Salt River meridian was established based on an existing marker that had been set up in 1851 to mark a point on the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border before the Gadsden Purchase.

History =Inter War years= Flughafen Detmold was built in 1934 on the northeastern edge of the city and was intended for recreational (glider) flying. It was laid out as a 500 √ó 500 meters all-way grass airfield with a single hangar. Before it was opened it was already decided to expand the airfield to 700 √ó 700 meters. Later it was decided to expand the airfield even further (1000 √ó 1000 m) to allow it to be used as an emergency airfield by the Luftwaffe. Civilians only got to use the airfield briefly though, as three months later the Luftwaffe took over the airfield on 15 February 1935 and they began converting it with a number of large hangars and a barracks compound west of the airfield. A flying school and school facilities were built. Aircraft used in flight instruction were: B√ºcker B√º 131, Focke-Wulf Fw 44, Heinkel He 72 biplanes and Klemm Kl 35 monoplanes for primary training. Advanced trainers flown at the airfield were Arado Ar 66, Gotha Go 145, Heinkel He 46, Focke-Wulf Fw 58, Junkers W 33 and W 34s. Such a flying school typically had around 90 training aircraft, plus a few types for type instruction for front-line service. Types that frequented the airfield were Junkers Ju 52/3m transports, Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Bf 110 fighters and Heinkel He 111 bombers. =Second World War= With the outbreak of the Second World War, front line units that used Detmold were III./JG 3 (Jagdgeschwader 3) (28 March ‚Äì 10 April 1940) and 2./JG 27 (Jagdgeschwader 27) flying Bf 109Es (November 1940 ‚Äì 10 January 1941). The airfield and its maintenance unit were involved in the production of the wooden Focke-Wulf Ta 154 twin-engine Moskito nightfighters. This occurred in part because the nearby furniture industry was used to produce parts for the aircraft, but development of the aircraft was terminated in late 1944. The airfield was never attacked by bombers, but allied fighters did attack it on several occasions. In early 1945, the airfield was prepared for demolition, but due to malfunctions only a part of the maintenance hangar and the aircraft at the airfield were destroyed. In April 1945, United States Army units moved through the area and seized the facilities. IX Engineering Command, Ninth Air Force repaired the airfield, which was re-designated \\"Advanced Landing Ground R-14\\". American Army Air Force units used the airfield as a casualty evacuation and combat resupply airfield by the IX Air Service Command. The runways were hardened with PSP, and heavy cargo planes flew into the airfield, often throughout the night. =Cold War= The Americans transferred AAF Station Detmold to the British in June 1945 as part of the formation of the British Occupation Zone of Germany. It became the garrison of 20th Armoured Brigade of the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR) around April 1958, who used the airfield (known as Hobart Barracks) for army observation flights. Aircraft flying from Detmold included Auster AOP.6 (No. 652 Squadron RAF), de Havilland Canada DHC-1 Chipmunk T.10, Westland Scout AH.1s, Westland Gazelle AH.1 and Westland Lynx AH.1/AH.7 (No. 654 Squadron AAC, No. 659 Squadron AAC, No. 669 Squadron AAC) helicopters. Both the Air Division Communication Squadron RAF and the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (RAF) Communication Squadron RAF was disbanded here In 1964, German civil aviation returned to the airfield when the LSV Detmold glider club was allowed to use the airfield. Current use The British turned the airfield over to German authorities in 1995 after the end of the Cold War, and the airfield reopened in 1999 when glider activity, helicopters, civilian and recreational use were permitted after some changes had been made to the local infrastructure to facilitate the local population.

It was opened on 1 November 1852 and is now served by S-Bahn and regional trains operated by Deutsche Bahn. Since 29 May 1961, it has been the only station in Hesse with a loading terminal for motorail trains. In addition, it has two bus stops, a taxi stand and a park and ride car park. The station is classified by Deutsche Bahn as a category 4 station. Location  The station is located on the western edge of Neu-Isenburg at the end of Bahnhofstra√üe, about two kilometres from the city centre. It is on the Main- Neckar Railway, connecting Frankfurt and Heidelberg. History Initially when the Main-Neckar Railway was opened, on 1 August 1846, there was no Neu Isenburg station. To gain an economic benefit from the railway, the citizens of Neu-Isenburg made numerous submissions to the Ministry of Finance of the Grand Duchy of Hesse in Darmstadt, which was then responsible for transport in the state. These submissions were initially rejected. It was only at the beginning of 1852 that the request was granted and, on 1 November 1852, Isenburg station was opened. Initially, only a few used the new station. The accounts of 1852/1853 noted that receipts amounting to 107 guilders and 15 Kreuzers had been taken for the transport of passengers, animals and baggage. Originally, the only station building was a signalman‚Äôs house, which was replaced by a station building during the laying of the second track in the autumn of 1861. A year later the station was connected by telegraph. =Extension = Two shunting sidings were built in late 1873 and a rail siding was opened to the brickworks of Philipp Holzmann & Cie. in the same year, which boosted the economy of the town. All the sets of points at the site had to be operated by hand at first. The first signal box was built in 1876, which could set points and signals using wires. In 1893, the signal box was replaced by a centralised interlockingMathias Tank, Bahnhof Neu-Isenburg ‚Äì Eine Bahnstation macht Karriere, p. 79 called Isb. In 1894 the station received its first electric lights. In 1900, the northern shunting siding on the line to Darmstadt, which had in the meantime been used as a freight yard, was reinstated for shunting. Traffic at the station had already increased to 100,000 passengers and 45,000 tons of freight per year. Branch to freight yard Neu-Isenburg freight yard In 1904, a second signal box was opened with the name If. =Branch line to Isenburg-Stadt= In order to improve the railway connection to the centre of Neu-Isenburg, a branch line, which was about 2.2 km long, was commissioned to the southern part of the town on 20 March 1902. The line was single track and ran to a freight yard with six tracks. The southernmost of these tracks had two manually operated turntables, which connected to industrial sidings. This branch line only carried freight because the Frankfurt Forest Railway (Frankfurter Waldbahn,) already provided a connection from Neu-Isenburg to Frankfurt for passengers (now line 14 of the Frankfurt trams). At the end of 2006 this (never electrified) branch line was closed and the tracks were later partly removed. =Interwar period = During the occupation of the Ruhr in 1923, Neu Isenburg station was commandeered by French troops and could not be entered by Germans. As many in Isenburg depended on a railway connection, an emergency station was established by a local railway on a siding only 400 metres away from the station in the district of Frankfurt, which was not occupied. It consisted merely of a wooden hut for the sale of tickets and a plank crossing of the track, which ensured a reasonably safe entry and exit. The provisional station only closed with the withdrawal of French troops in September 1924. During the Second World War the town of Neu-Isenburg and its station were repeated exposed to heavy air raids, but‚Äîin contrast to other stations in the area‚Äîthe entrance building was unharmed and only parts of its tracks were damaged; these were quickly repaired after the war. There was a major accident in the last days of 1945 when the dispatcher on duty left the signal box to go to a shelter in anticipation of an air raid. Previously he had set the signal to permit a train from Frankfurt to run on to track 3, without remembering that the track was still occupied by a passenger train. The collision of the trains led to the death of nearly forty people. =Deutsche Bundesbahn = In the early 1960s, Deutsche Bundesbahn decided to join the Frankfurt Rhine-Main region to the international motorail network. It chose Neu-Isenburg station as the terminal for these operations. The first car train stopped here in on 29 May 1961. In 1968, the car loading facility gained a second track. On 14 April 1969, the Isb and If signal boxes were replaced by a new combined signal box called If, which took over the functions of the Bf and Bn signal boxes in Dreieich-Buchschlag. It is a relay interlocking of class Sp Dr S 60 (a Siemens pushbutton interlocking introduced in 1960). The interlocking is still operating today. Shunting ended at Neu Isenburg station in 1983. Since 1997, the station has been an S-Bahn stop. Public transport services S-Bahn platform with tracks 2 and 3 =Rail= The station is served by the Rhine- Main S-Bahn and DB Regio services. S-Bahn lines S 3 and S 4 each stop at the station every half hour on weekdays, which together provide services every 15-minute. On Sundays, both lines operate every hour, together providing a service every half hour. The Regionalbahn RB 61 service (Dreieich Railway) runs from Monday to Friday three times in the morning from Dieburg to Frankfurt and three times in the afternoon from Frankfurt to Dieburg on the line.Deutsche Bahn timetable Loading dock with waggons =Motorail= The station has a loading dock for motorail trains of DB AutoZug. During the summer season approximately 10,000 vehicles are loaded at the Auto Train terminal. Passengers drive themselves over a paved ramp on to a two-story car transport waggon. In the first 25 years of the motorail terminal in Neu- Isenburg handled 200,000 vehicles. Upon the arrival of the train, the loaded wagons are attached to the train and passengers board sleeping and couchette cars. Trains run from Neu-Isenburg to Narbonne in France, Alessandria and Verona in Italy and Villach in Austria. A glass-enclosed waiting room is available on the south side of the station for users of the service. East side bus stop West side bus stop and Park+Ride parking area =Bus = There are two bus stops, served by the transport companies of the Rhein-Main- Verkehrsverbund (Rhine-Main Transport Association, RMV). The Bahnhof Westseite (west side) bus stop connects Neu Isenburg station with Terminal 1 of Frankfurt Airport, the Obertshausen station (line 651) and R√∂dermark-Urberach (line OF-95). The Bahnhof Ostseite (east side) bus stop is served by buses to Darmstadt-Arheilgen (line 662) and M√∂rfelden via Langen (line 663). Line OF-51 operates every hour from Zeppelinheim station to the east side (terminating there) or continuing via the west side to Gravenbruch. =Others = There is a taxi rank on the east side of the station and a park and ride car park has been built on the west side. There is a restaurant, a kiosk and a travel centre and a motorail ticket office the station building. Track plan  Track plan of the station Track field The Main-Neckar Railway runs as four tracks between Frankfurt-Louisa and Dreieich-Buchschlag. One track (line 3655) separates from the long-distance tracks of the Main-Neckar Railway north of Neu Isenburg station, which becomes platform track 1 through the station. South of the station, the eastern track reconnects to the four main line tracks after the separation of the Dreieich Railway (line 3653). The western two tracks (line 3688) form station tracks 3 and 2, which are used by the S-Bahn. The next two tracks are part of line 3601, which is used by long- distance passenger and freight trains and do not abut platforms at the station. The single track line 3655, used by the Regionalbahn service between Dieburg and Frankfurt, forms platform track 1 through the station. East of track 1, are the tracks of the motorail terminal.

In the late 1970s, Odoi emigrated to Kenya where he joined up with the doyen of Kenyan cartoonists, Terry Hirst, and became a contributor to Hirst's illustrated humour magazine Joe. As Hirst recalls, \\"Frank had seen a copy of Joe magazine in Ghana, and just turned up in Nairobi to join us. [So] we put him up for a while, and he worked for Joe enthusiastically.\\" Odoi later inherited Terry‚Äôs position at the Daily Nation newspaper as editorial cartoonist but he also continued working on other publications in collaboration with other Kenyan cartoonists such as Paul Kelemba, Gado, and Kham. Amongst the publications they collaborated on were Sukumawiki (where Frank signed his work as \\"Frank Odoi, Sinker of Noah's Ark!\\"), Men Only, Pichadithi and African Illustrated. Frank also worked on educational books and comics Odoi, Frank. Boyi Learns a Lesson. East African Educational Publishers, 2008.________ . Bomba the Cub East African Educational Publishers, 2008. and even spent three years as an illustrator at the International Centre For Insect Physiology and Ecology (ICIPE), a job he described as challenging: \\"Can you imagine an Artist working in the middle of all those Scientists!!! That was challenging, but I did it for three years! After all, someone has to do it.\\" Frank‚Äôs work has also appeared in various international publications such as the Ugandan Monitor, New Vision of Uganda, Daily Graphic of Ghana, Noticias (Mozambique), Dejembe Dapanda (Denmark), Helsingin Sanomat (Finland) and the BBC‚Äôs Focus on Africa magazine. He has also held exhibitions in East Africa, West Africa and Europe.Sample of Frank Odoi's artwork But perhaps the work Frank is most famous for is the Akokhan series. This comic series is about the centuries-long rivalry between Akokhan and his evil nemesis, Tonkazan. A fan of Western comic-book superheroes as a child, Frank wanted a superhero whose powers came from \\"unexplainable\\" sources unlike Western superheroes who \\"derived their powers from scientific... and thus easily explainable sources.\\" So he created Akokhan, an African superhero based on African folklore whose power sources are unexplainable. \\"Call it magic, but when you breath life into fantasy, it stops being magic‚Ä¶ bringing fantasy and African roots-religion together gave me Akokhan.\\" The first book collection of Akokhan was published in Finnish in Finland in 2007 and an English version was launched in Nairobi by Kenway Publications.Odoi, Frank. Akokhan: More Than A Comic Story. Kenway Publications, 2007. Another of Frank's famous works is the Golgoti series which also appeared in newspapers in Ghana and East Africa. This series is about a white explorer who comes to Africa, but this time the story is narrated from the black man‚Äôs perspective. Book versions of the Golgoti comic series have been published in Finland and England. Frank Odoi was a member of World Comics Finland and chairperson of the East African association of Cartoonists (Katuni). He received the cartoonist of the year award in Kenya in 1985, 1986, and 2004 and the cartoonist of the year award in Ghana in 2005. He was a director of Four Dimension Innovative, a media company based in Nairobi, where he helped develop and launch the XYZ Show, a daring satirical puppet show similar to the British 1980's show Spitting Image and France's Les Guignols. Frank died on 21 April 2012 when a matatu (public-transport mini-buses that ply the Kenyan roads) he was riding in veered off the road and crashed into a ditch, killing the cartoonist and another passenger.

They are also known as LRV2000. Nine were constructed in the late 1990s (with new bodywork and new Volvo engines) from the chassis of Yugoslav-built, former S√©rie 9700 railcars. Four railcars intended for the Metro de Mirandela were given a bright green livery, the other five carried a red livery. With the closure of most of the Tua line in 2008 and the entirety of the Corgo and T√¢mega lines in 2009, as of 2012 only two of the nine railcars built remain in use, although they are currently out of service for maintenance after the closure of the Metro de Mirandela. Given that funding for the Metro de Mirandela project had been given by the European Union the railcars were named Lisboa, Paris, Estrasburgo (Strasbourg) and Bruxelas (Brussels). The railcar Bruxelas was subsequently destroyed in an accident in January 2007. The other five railcars have been sold to Inca Rail in Peru and regauged to 914 mm (former 3 ft gauge).

Life Born Samuel Cowan in London on 31 July 1877, Mayo first worked in his father's second-hand shop while also collecting bets and singing in pubs and clubs with his brothers Ted and Maurice Cowan. Mayo married Zillah Flash (performing name: Stella Stanley) in Brighton on 13 August 1904. His early involvement in gambling stayed with him: heavy gambling caused him to be three times declared bankrupt. Career Mayo developed a unique comic style as a music hall singer. Dressed in long overcoat or dressing gown, he sang deadpan at the piano with quirky, lugubrious humour. He became billed as \\"The Immobile One\\". Mayo mostly wrote his own songs, and provided other entertainers, such as Ernie Mayne, with material. He held the record for appearing at the greatest number of music halls in a single evening: nine performances at nine London venues on the evening of 21 January 1905. Death He died of a heart attack whilst playing snooker at Ascot Club, in Charing Cross, on 31 March 1938. He was playing a game against George Swift. This was a week after attending the funeral of his son, Frank Mayo, who died of tuberculosis. He was buried at Willesden Jewish Cemetery on 3 April, and was survived by his brothers, Maurice and Ted (Cowan), his son Harry Mayo, and his son-in-law Micheal Flame. The funeral was attended by Will Fyffe and a few other notable figures in music hall. Trivia The noted writer Katherine Mansfield quoted Mayo's lyrics in a letter dated 1 November 1920.

To tie into these appearances, the character is seen in several MCU tie-in comics. The character also appears in other media, including non-MCU comics published by Marvel Comics. Marvel Cinematic Universe =Feature films= In Thor, astrophysicist Erik Selvig works with Jane Foster, the daughter of a former colleague of his, on her wormhole research. They become involved in an encounter between Thor and S.H.I.E.L.D., leading to his employment by the latter to study the Tesseract‚Äîhe accepts the job due to influence by Loki. In The Avengers, Loki uses the Tesseract to travel to Earth, and places Selvig under the control of the Mind Stone. Selvig is eventually freed of this control and able to help stop Loki's invasion of Earth, but is left traumatized by his experience. Selvig is able to help Thor again in Thor: The Dark World, and by Avengers: Age of Ultron appears to have recovered, working at Royal Holloway. After the defeat of Ultron, Selvig begins working for the Avengers. When Thanos snapped his fingers, and half the universe's population were disintegrated, Selvig was among those who were killed, and were subsequently resurrected by Bruce Banner five years later. In Spider-Man Far From Home, Selvig is shown to be starring in the documentary NOVA: Einstein Rosen Bridges with Dr. Erik Selvig. =Tie-in comics= Selvig appears in the MCU tie-in comics The Avengers Prelude: Fury's Big Week and Thor: The Dark World Prelude in the same capacity as he does in the films.

His character Erik Selvig appears in the post-credits scene at the end of Thor, which was directed by The Avengers director Joss Whedon. This set up Selvig's role in that film. After also appearing in Thor: The Dark World and Avengers: Age of Ultron, Skarsg√•rd noted in February 2015 that he had one more Marvel film in his deal, that he would not be appearing in Thor: Ragnarok, and that he possibly could appear in another Avengers film.

The U.S. Forest Service complex is located along the Smith River on U.S. Route 199 in Del Norte County, California, within Smith River National Recreation Area. Most of the buildings were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps between 1933 and 1939. Seven buildings and a rock wall remain of the CCC-built structures. The district office, the assistant district ranger's residence, a warehouse, two garages and a fuel house were built in the Forest Service rustic style that prevailed at the time. The style is reflected in distinctive detailing, including a recurring pine tree cut-out logo that appears on gables and shutters. Description The ranger station is located on a terrace between the Middle Fork of the Smith River and US 199. The main office is a 1-1/2 story frame structure completed in 1938, facing U.S. 199. The main roof is end-gabled, with a large cross-gabled front porch. The building measures about by . In plan it originally was two rooms downstairs, with an attic storage room. Pine tree cut-outs are painted green against the white gables, and the stationary shutters feature similar cut-outs. The porch lights are designed to resemble fire lookout cabins. Over time there have been modest additions and changes to the interior. The assistant ranger's residence was also completed in 1938, measuring about by . The one-story house is end- gabled. The front porch is supported by curved wood brackets. It has been little altered. Two garages were built in either 1933 or 1938, and feature pine tree cutouts on their gables. A warehouse, built about 1936, is actually three adjoining structures. The fuel house was built about 1934. The district ranger's residence is a Colonial Revival structure that is more in accordance with eastern design practice than was usual in California, even including a full basement. Rock walls in the vicinity were built by the CCC, as was another wall near the highway. There were once four more CCC buildings: a barn, a messhall/bunkhouse, a woodshed and another residence. Several newer buildings are included in the historic district but are regarded as non- contributing. History The Gasquet Ranger Station was built beginning in 1933 to replace the Smith Fork Ranger Station, located to the west of the present station. The station at the time was part of Siskiyou National Forest. The district ranger, Adolph Nilsson, directed CCC forces at the Gasquet CCC camp to build the new station to plans provided by the Forest Service regional office. The station's presence at the time in the Northwest Region meant that northwestern design motifs such as the cutout pine trees were employed, making the station unusual for California ranger stations. The exception was the ranger's residence, which was built to a plan that appeared in the July 1930 Ladies Home Journal, apparently at the instigation of Mrs. Nilsson. The Gasquet Ranger Station Historic District was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 26, 1998. It is the primary Forest Service visitor contact point in Smith River National Recreation Area.

It is a residential area of large homes with a few small homes in between. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998 as a part of Ottumwa MPS. At the time of its nomination it contained 84 resources, which included 56 contributing buildings, two contributing structures, 25 non-contributing buildings, and one non- contributing site. with History Court Street was developed as a major artery from the Des Moines River to Sixth Street, which was Ottumwa's original city limits, where it made a slight turn to the north and headed up a bluff and into the countryside above the river valley. It is possible that it is the road established by the Iowa Territorial Legislature in 1844 that extended from the southern Davis County border to the northern Wapello County border and connected the two county seats. Later it was signed as U.S. Highway 63. The oldest houses in the district were built between 1865 and 1875. The first electric streetcar began operating on Court Street in 1889. The street was paved with bricks in 1890 and 1891. Both projects led to increased development of the area between 1890 and 1915. From this period until 1942 a centralized steam heat system was available in the city and the main pipes were located under Court Street. Because of this, the street was never covered with snow or ice during the winter and people could always climb to the top of the bluff when other streets were impassable. During the World War II years many of the large homes were divided into multi-family dwellings. That process started to be reversed in the late 20th century when historic preservation took root in Ottumwa. Architecture Most of the houses are large in size, but a few smaller houses are scattered throughout the district. While some of the houses have been altered over the years, most of them retain a high level of integrity. Very few of the original buildings in the district have been torn down, and therefore, there is little in the way of new construction. A variety of the most fashionable Victorian styles were built in the district. The most popular include Italianate, Neoclassical, and Queen Anne. Architects who have designs in the district include George Kern, Edward Clark, and Fisher & Lowrie.

Elvanfoot is located at the confluence of the River Clyde and Elvan Water.Gazetteer for Scotland The Clyde is crossed by a pedestrian suspension bridge that has been closed since 2007 for want of repair. The apparently-abandoned church is on the Buildings at Risk Register for Scotland, as are the stables of Newton House, once home to the Scottish judge Alexander Irving, Lord Newton. Etymology The name 'Elvan' apparently includes the element *al-, which occurs in river names in Roman Britain and continental Europe. A number of meanings have been suggested, including 'bright, shining, white', 'sparkling, speckled' and 'holy' amongst others. Almost all attestations of the root occur with the Proto-Indo-European suffix -*awe- and \\"root-determinative -*n- or participial -*ant-\\", giving the proto- form *al-au-n-. Andrew Breeze has suggested that the name is derived from Cumbric *hal·∫π:n 'salt', cognate with Welsh halen, which is found in a number of Welsh river names. As Elvan Water passes through a mining area, Breeze suggests that there may be high levels of salt in the river. The loss of initial /h/ could be explained as a result of the name's transmission via Gaelic. Transport Elvanfoot is at the junction of the A702 and B7040 roads and south from junction 14 of the M74 motorway. Until 1965 it was served by Elvanfoot railway station on the West Coast Main Line. The village is also served by Stagecoach West Scotland service 102 from Edinburgh to Dumfries which operates 1 bus each day in each direction, There used to be 2 buses per day but were cut due to Council funding being reduced.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. Description The Naomikong Point Laurel Complex site is located on a small point on the south shore of Lake Superior in what is now a low meadow, but was a pine forest at the time the site was used. Some of what was once occupied area is now under the water slightly offshore. The site contained refuse and storage pits, as well as evidence of post molds thought to be from fish drying racks. This, along with other evidence, strongly suggests the people living here relied heavily on fishing. Radiocarbon dating indicated the site was populated at some point between about 100AD and 900AD. The site was likely used seasonally. Archeological History The Naomikong Point Site was brought to the attention of archaeologists by Charles Sprague Taylor, a lumberman and historian from Newberry, Michigan. It was surveyed by James Fitting in the 1960s, including underwater exploration just off shore in 1964. Additional work was done by Donald E. Janzen in 1967. Over 100,000 potsherds was recovered from the site, which came from at least 288 different vessels.

The latin root for the genera name Pseudopulex roughly translates to \\"false fleas\\".  Taxonomy  P. tanlan fossils and line drawing There are currently four identified species in this genus discovered through fossil remains: Pseudopulex jurassicus, Pseudopulex magnus, Pseudopulex wangi and Pseudopulex tanlan, with most current research focused on P. jurassicus and P. magnus. Fossils of Pseudopulex jurassicus date back to the mid-Mesozoic of China, more specifically the middle Jurassic-aged Jiulongshan Formation, making them around 165 million years old, while Pseudopulex magnus were discovered to be from the Early Cretaceous Yixian Formation, around 125 million years ago. Some possible hosts of P. jurassicus were Pedopenna daohugouensis and/or Epidexipteryx hui (feathered dinosaurs) and Sinosauropteryx prima or Microraptor gui may have been a good snack for P. magnus, simply because they were known to be present at the same time and place as these parasites. These organisms are defined as having many similar features to other studied ectoparasites. These organisms also share traits in common with present-day fleas, most obviously in their wingless bodies and stylets that are very long and sharp (used for piercing through flesh). They also contain features that distinguish them from similar parasites, such as lice, because of their longer and more thin, clawed appendages as well as their extended mouthparts specific for bloodsucking. There are traits that are completely different to modern fleas as well, which is said to be representative of this species possibly having an early evolution that resulted in a dead-end lineage. There currently isn't much information regarding the evolution of fleas, but this genera is most similar to crown fleas. Pseudopulex tanlan is considered to be somewhat of a transition organism between P. jurassicus or P. magnus and existing fleas as it has a smaller body plan, more compact antennae, and other features associated with fleas seen today. Maybe their most critical difference from current fleas, such as crown fleas, is the lack of hind legs, prohibiting them from jumping or running, which is a common mode of transportation for most fleas today. Presently, there has been a total of six other flea-like fossils that have been discovered along with this genus, which contributes to a better and more full understanding of the evolution of fleas.  Description  Restoration of P. jurassicus The most common trait of these prehistoric fleas are their flat bodies, similar to common ectoparasites like ticks or bedbugs. Even between the species of Pseudopulex, however, there are distinct differences in morphology, with P. jurassicus being slightly longer and containing a shorter stylet while P. magnus are thicker and have very long mouthparts. P. tanlan was discovered to have an average sized body but smaller than other Pseudopulex species at about 10 mm long, with a relatively small head and thoracic cavity. The body was also seen to contain setae that are very short and stiff. Comparing to P. magnus and P. jurrasicus, this species has relative small male genitalia and short tibia on females. P. jurassicus was a lot larger, with a length of 17 mm and mouthpart length of 3.4 mm, which is twice the size of its head. This species had very small eyes, antennae, and a short torso with long, thick bristles covering the body. Their legs were also quite long and contained a pair if large claws on the ends of each leg. On the other hand, P. magnus was even larger, measured at 22.8mm long and 5.2mm long mouthparts. Their head was relatively small and body compressed and stout (compared to P. jurassicus). This species also contained antennae, dense setae, and claws on the ends of legs, but they also had a very uniquely large abdomen. Line drawings were able to be created using fossils to provide a clearer understanding of morphology. P. wangi females were about 14.8mm long with a small head with relatively short mouthparts, comparatively, and short antennae. This species also contained larger eyes and body setae. Males, however, were much smaller and had longer bodies, with genitalia being quite large, indicating P. wangi contains much sexual dimorphism within the species.  Paleobiology  While these parasites show similar characteristics to modern fleas, they also show major differences in body morphology and size due to the large difference in host, such as more flattened bodies and longer claws. They also possessed serrated stylets, likely for feeding on blood through thick layers of skin. Moreover, these organisms are likely to be about fifty times larger than the dog flea. It is reported that the puncture of this parasite is compared to a hypodermic needle injection for these large dinosaurs. Understanding these prehistoric fleas, although they may be different in many aspects, contribute to the breakdown of things like Mesozoic biodiversity and ancient food chains, as well as gaining new information regarding current flea-like insect evolution. Specifically, how these ectoparasites switched from only mammal hosts to also infecting bird species gives a snapshot of parasite evolution. The Pseudopulex phylum displays the tremendous diversity present even millions of years ago, along with host- interactions that further aid in the study of ectoparasite evolution in today's world, giving novel insight into evolution, ecology, and host-parasite interactions that can be applied to modern-day ectoparasites.

Family, early life and education  Herbert Olivecrona was born July 11, 1891 in Visby, Sweden, the son of Axel Olivecrona, a district court judge, and Countess Ebba Cristina M√∂rner af Morlanda. His brother Karl Olivecrona was a noted Swedish legal scholar, and his son Gustaf Olivecrona a Swedish writer and journalist. In his youth, he was playing elite bandy. He was part of the IFK Uppsala bandy team which in 1912 played a draw in the final against Djurg√•rdens IF and shared the Swedish championship that year. Originally attending school in Uppsala, he began studying medicine at the University of Uppsala in 1909, then transferring to Karolinska Institutet, where he was an assistant in Pathology. He graduated in 1918.  Medical career  In 1919, Olivecrona received a fellowship from the American-Scandinavian Foundation. This allowed him to engage in experimental work at the Johns Hopkins Institute in Baltimore, Maryland, where he worked with surgery pioneer Harvey Cushing (1869-1939). Olivecrona was offered a residency, and to be Cushing's foreign assistant on the condition that he work for a year at Pierre Marie's clinic in Paris. Due to financial reasons, Olivecrona declined and returned to Sweden, where, as the only neurosurgeon in the city interested in brain tumors, he established the first neurosurgery program at Serafimer Hospital in the 1920s. After further consultation with Cushing, Olivecrona improved his skills, and in 1930 was promoted to the position of assistant surgeon in chief, allowing him to establish a 50-bed neurosurgery department. In 1935, he became the first professor of neurosurgery at the Karolinska Institute, quite likely the first chair of neurosurgery in all of Europe. Olivecrona was a pioneer in the creation of specific surgical techniques for certain types of brain lesions such as acoustic neuromas, arteriovenous malformations, and berry aneurysms, becoming one of the key neurosurgical instructors in Europe. One of his students, Lars Leksell (1907-1986), went on to make major advances in the development of echoencephalography, and is credited with the invention of radiosurgery. Among his most famous patients was the Hungarian writer Frigyes Karinthy, whose brain tumor he operated on in 1936. Karinthy put it into a novel titled \\"A Journey Round my Skull.\\" In 1955, Olivecrona was elected as a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. He retired from the Karolinska in 1960 and went into private practice, during which time he also accepted an invitation to travel to Cairo and establish a neurosurgical unit in Egypt. He later co-wrote a neurosurgical handbook, Handbuch der Neurochirugie. Olivecrona died in January 1980. Legacy The Herbert Olivecrona Award, also known as the \\"Nobel Prize of Neurosurgery\\", is awarded annually by the Karolinska Institute to a neurosurgeon or neuroscientist who has made an outstanding contribution to the neurosurgical field.

These films were shot across the United States with casts of children who each paid a fee for the opportunity to star in the two-reel shorts.  Itinerant Films  During the first half of the twentieth century, filmmakers traveled across the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia and New Zealand, making a business of shooting films starring local talent for a fee. These home talent films, or town boosters, featured community landmarks, businesses, and local residents. Not all of these films had a narrative structure; some simply shot the town and its populace. Others would mimic popular films, or create some sort of limited narrative in order to focus on the local community. Once shot and completed, these films would be shown locally before a major theatrical feature was screened. The Kidnappers Foil The Kidnappers Foil was one of Melton Barker's films. The same script would be shot repeatedly in different towns with a different cast across the United States from the 1930s though the 1950s. Melton Barker Juvenile Productions would contact local theaters and newspapers to sponsor the film, after which a casting call for children would go out and parents would be encouraged to fill out the paperwork provided and after paying a small fee, the children would participate in a short audition before a representative of the production company. This company would consist of a skeleton crew consisting of Melton Barker, a camera man, a sound man, and an assistant. The plot of the films hardly changed with each production. In each a young girl, Betty Davis, is kidnapped and held for ransom following her birthday. Her father offers a reward of $1,000 for her return. A group of young boys led by Butch, imagine what they could do with the reward and set out in search for Betty. Soon another group of even younger children attempt to join the search, but are refused and set out upon their own. A group of local girls soon join with Butch and his gang. After several days with no results the gang once again imagines what they will do with the money. Soon after they catch the kidnappers napping, and rescue Betty. All of the children are invited to Betty's house to celebrate, where they perform several song and dance numbers. The Kidnappers Foil was produced in different cities across the country over one hundred and thirty times. Once completed these films would be screened locally, prior to a Hollywood feature film yet receiving more advertising space. These films tended to get positive reviews regardless of the quality.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Blackpool, the archdeaconry of Lancaster, and the diocese of Blackburn. History St Stephen's originated as a mission church to All Hallows Church, Bispham, and was opened in 1912. It became known as \\"The Church on the Cliffs\\". In 1919 St Stephen's became a parish in its own right. The mission church was too small to accommodate its growing congregation, and money was raised to build a new, larger church on a site to the north of the mission church. Its foundation stone was laid by the Rt Revd William Temple, then the Bishop of Manchester (later the Archbishop of Canterbury), on 1 July 1925. The architect was Henry Paley of the Lancaster firm of architects Austin and Paley. In 1927 the church was consecrated by the Rt Revd Percy Herbert, the first Bishop of Blackburn, although only the east end and the first two bays had been completed. The church cost ¬£20,000 (equivalent to ¬£ in ), and provided seating for 400 people. The church built up a strong relationship with actors and entertainers appearing in the local theatres, and in 1929 the Actors' Chapel was created in the church. In 1949 a columbarium (a chapel for the storage of cinerary urns) was added to the church, to a design by Edwin Carpenter. Further additions were made in 2001‚Äì02 by Stephen Eccles, consisting of a porch, a narthex, and a baptistry. The former mission church survives, and is used as the parish hall. Architecture The church is constructed in bright red brick with stone dressings. The windows contain tracery in Decorated style. The plan of the church includes north and south chapels, the columbarium to the north, the baptistry to the northeast, and the narthex to the west. The interior of the church is lined with red sandstone. The furnishings in the choir, dating from 1927, are decorated with finely carved figures of angel musicians and saints. The integral pulpit is in red sandstone and is carved with saints under canopies and foliage. The Actors' Chapel forms part of the north aisle. Its reredos is painted with figures representing singers, dancers, entertainers and Saint Genesius, the patron saint of actors. On the walls of the chapel are alabaster tablets inscribed with the names of entertainers, including No√´l Coward, Sybil Thorndyke, Arthur Askey, George Formby, Ivor Novello, and Edith Evans. The stained glass includes a window by Baron Arild Rosencrantz, dated 1935, with depictions of Parsifal, representing opera, Everyman, representing drama, and Galahad. This was created in memory of John Huddlestone, an impresario, and John Tiller, the creator of the Tiller Girls. Elsewhere is stained glass by Shrigley and Hunt dating from the 1930s, and by Harry Stammers from the 1960s. Also in the church is a statue of Madonna donated by Tessie O'Shea. The three-manual pipe organ was built by Henry Willis between 1881 and 1895. It was formerly in St Philip's Church, Blackburn, and was moved to St Stephen's in about 1975 when St Philip's was demolished.

Along the way, LA 106 passes through the towns of Pine Prairie and St. Landry and intersects U.S. Highway 167 (US 167). Near the east end of its route, LA 106 passes through an interchange with Interstate 49 (I-49) between Opelousas and Alexandria in the southwest corner of Avoyelles Parish. Route description From the west, LA 106 begins at an intersection with LA 10 east of Oakdale at a point known as Beaver. It proceeds in a general eastern direction along Beaver Road for , making a long curve to the south and back to the east for much of the distance. It then skirts the northern border of Pine Prairie briefly and intersects LA 13 (Veterans Memorial Boulevard), which heads to Mamou on the south. LA 106 turns north and travels in a concurrency with LA 13 for less than a mile. At a four- way intersection, LA 13 continues north to Turkey Creek where it connects with US 167 to Alexandria; LA 3187 (Crooked Creek Parkway) begins to the west; and LA 106 turns to the east. After heading in a general northeast direction along St. Landry Highway for , LA 106 reaches a point known as Bayou Chicot. Here it intersects US 167 which, apart from its aforementioned northerly destinations, heads south to Ville Platte, the seat of Evangeline Parish. Continuing northeast for , LA 106 intersects LA 3042 (Chicot Park Road) which leads to the Chicot State Park and Arboretum and parallels US 167 south to Ville Platte. After another , LA 106 intersects LA 115 which parallels Bayou Cocodrie north to Lone Pine. Soon afterward, LA 106 crosses a bridge over the bayou and enters St. Landry. LA 106 then crosses the Acadiana Railway (AKDN) tracks and takes a sharp turn to the north out of town. It shortly resumes its northeastern course for before crossing from Evangeline Parish into Avoyelles Parish. In Avoyelles Parish, LA 106 turns east and passes through a diamond interchange with I-49 at Exit 46. I-49 heads to Alexandria on the north and Opelousas on the south. LA 106 ends shortly thereafter at an intersection with LA 29 south of Bunkie in an area known as Milburn. LA 106 is an undivided, two-lane highway for its entire length, except for a brief portion that widens to a divided four-lane highway passing through the interchange with I-49. History In the original Louisiana Highway system in use between 1921 and 1955, the modern LA 106 made up parts of several routes, including State Route 482 from the western terminus at Beaver to Bayou Chicot; and State Route 23 to the eastern terminus at Milburn. LA 106 was created with the 1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering, and its route has remained unchanged to the present day.

Along the way, LA 107 services Cottonport, Mansura, and Marksville, intersecting routes such as LA 29, LA 114, and LA 1. LA 107 has significant concurrencies with both LA 1 and LA 115 in the vicinity of Marksville. Route description =Morrow to Marksville= From the south, LA 107 begins at an intersection with US 71 about midway between Bunkie and Lebeau. It proceeds east, immediately crossing the Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR) tracks, and makes a zigzag through the tiny community of Morrow. Leaving Morrow, LA 107 continues eastward along Dry Bayou for about to a point known as Big Cane. Here it intersects LA 361 and turns north to follow that highway briefly before resuming its eastward course. After , LA 107 turns north and crosses from St. Landry Parish into Avoyelles Parish. In Avoyelles Parish, LA 107 continues north to a point known as Dupont where it curves to the east and intersects LA 1179. Shortly afterward, it curves back to the north at LA 1180 and heads into Plaucheville. At the town's main junction, LA 107 intersects LA 1181 and turns to the west along Bayou Choupique. LA 107 passes through a point known as Hickory where it once again intersects LA 1179 then curves to the north toward Cottonport. LA 107 enters Cottonport on Choupique Lane where it makes a zigzag to the west and back to the north. It then makes a second zigzag west onto Lemoine Street and north onto Cottonport Avenue. Here it intersects LA 362 which heads south toward Evergreen. LA 107 continues north to Bayou Rouge where it intersects LA 29 (Front Street) which also heads to Evergreen. LA 107 turns northeast onto Front Street and begins a brief concurrency with LA 29 along the bayou until the two separate at Long Bridge Road. Here LA 29 heads northeast toward Moreauville while LA 107 continues north toward Mansura. Just north of the Cottonport city limit at Bayou Du Lac, LA 107 intersects LA 1185 which parallels LA 29 to the northeast. LA 107 enters Mansura on Valley Street and intersects LA 114, which heads west to Hessmer. LA 107 turns east at this intersection, running concurrent with LA 104 for one block along Baton Rouge Avenue to Leglise Street. Here LA 114 turns south toward Moreauville while LA 107 resumes a northerly course through Mansura, intersecting LA 1 near the town limit. LA 1 heads south through Simmesport and New Roads on the way to Baton Rouge, the state capital. After crossing LA 1, LA 107 runs parallel with it for to Cocoville before the two join in a northward concurrency toward Marksville. =Marksville to Pineville= In Marksville, LA 1 and LA 107 intersect LA 452 (South Preston Street), which heads north to the Red River, and LA 1189 (Acton Road), a short connector to LA 115 south. In the center of town, LA 1 and LA 107 intersect Main Street. At this four-way intersection, LA 1 continues north toward Alexandria; LA 115 heads south through Hessmer to Bunkie; and LA 107 turns northeast onto Main Street beginning a concurrency with LA 115 out of Marksville. On the north side of town, LA 107 and LA 115 intersect two minor routes, LA 1190 (Spring Bayou Road) and LA 1192. Continuing northwest, LA 107 and LA 115 intersect two minor routes that run west to connect with LA 1: LA 1191 and another section of LA 1192. LA 107 and LA 115 have a very brief concurrency with LA 1192, which splits to the northeast and loops through Fort De Russy back to the first intersection in Marksville. LA 107 and LA 115 encounter two further minor routes before reaching the Red River: LA 1193 and LA 453 which run through an area known as Hickory Hill. LA 107 and LA 115 continue northwest across the Red River, slightly bypassing the small community of Moncla to the north. On the other side of the bridge, LA 107 and LA 115 intersect LA 1196 and LA 454, which parallel the Red River, in an area known as Effie. Just north of Effie, LA 115 splits to the north and runs toward Deville and Buckeye. Meanwhile, LA 107 curves to the west through Center Point and out of Avoyelles Parish. After crossing into Rapides Parish, LA 107 intersects LA 454 again in Cedar Grove. From this junction, LA 107 (also known in these parts as Old Marksville Highway) takes a northwest course through Kolin to Shady Oaks. Here LA 107 intersects LA 3128 which services a paper mill just to the south and connects to LA 28 on the north. After about , LA 107 enters Pineville and reaches its northern terminus at LA 1250, the service roads of the Pineville Expressway (US 167/LA 28). Ramps from the service roads provide access to the expressway, which continues southwest into Alexandria and northeast out of Pineville, where US 167 and LA 28 separate and head toward Winnfield and Jonesville, respectively. LA 1250 heads southwest a short distance, connecting LA 107 and the Pineville Expressway with the Pineville Business District. LA 107 is an undivided, two-lane highway for most of its length. It widens to accommodate a center lane from LA 1 in Cocoville to LA 452 in Marksville, then widens to four lanes for the short distance to LA 115. LA 107 resumes its two-lane capacity from there to Pinegrove Drive (former LA 3263) in Pineville. Here it widens again to four lanes and remains in that capacity for the remainder of its route. History In the original Louisiana Highway system in use between 1921 and 1955, the modern LA 107 made up parts of several routes, including State Route 92 from the southern terminus at Morrow to Cottonport; State Route C-1472 from Cottonport to Mansura; State Route C-1471 from Mansura to Marksville; State Route 5 from Marksville to the second junction with the modern LA 1192 south of Moncla; State Route 57 from there to Effie; and State Route 57-D from Effie to the northern terminus in Pineville. LA 107 was created with the 1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering, and its route has seen several minor changes, most significantly in Marksville and at the northern terminus in Pineville. In Marksville, the original route of LA 107 (then as now co-signed with LA 1) curved northeast onto South Preston Street then turned northwest onto East Mark Street, rejoining the current alignment at South Main Street. Improvements to LA 1 during the early 1970s created a more direct alignment through Marksville, and LA 107 was re-routed to follow the portion between South Preston Street and South Main Street, eliminating a zigzag. (LA 452 was extended south along South Preston Street to cover most of the old alignment.) These improvements also included the current alignment of LA 1 between Mansura and Cocoville. In this case, however, LA 107 remains on the original route which formerly carried both highways. In Pineville, before the construction of the Pineville Expressway, LA 107 originally followed Melrose Street across the present expressway right-of-way then turned northwest onto Reagan Street to a terminus at US 165 Business (Main Street). In March 1963, the Pineville Expressway, temporarily designated as LA 3026, was opened northward as far as Shamrock Street. LA 107 now followed Melrose Street past Reagan Street and turned northwest onto Shamrock Street to reach US 165 Business (Main Street). In May 1966, the second stage of the Pineville Expressway was opened from Shamrock Street north to Donohue Ferry Road (LA 3100 Spur), largely becoming the new route of LA 28. With Melrose Street now discontinuous, LA 107 turned southwest along the expressway service roads from its present terminus to Wadley Street. It then turned northwest onto Wadley Street, southwest onto the continuation of Melrose Street, and northwest onto Shamrock Street to reach US 165 Business (Main Street). In 2001, this alignment became a separate route, the newly designated LA 1250, and LA 107 was truncated to its present terminus. Other improvements caused further minor alterations in the route, including the smoothing of both a zigzag south of Dupont and a curve at Shady Oaks, and a change of connector road in Morrow. In March 2000, the current bridge over the Red River at Moncla - the third constructed at this location - was opened on the southwest side of the previous bridge, which was then demolished, necessitating a slight realignment of LA 107 (and concurrent LA 115) on the approaches. In all of the above cases, remnants of the original route still exist as local roads.

The highway runs in roughly a \\"U\\" shape along section line roads, dipping southward from Vinton then east parallel to I-10 and back to the north toward Sulphur. The majority of the route is signed west-east except for the eastern leg running north to Sulphur, which is signed north-south. The latter section is also the most travelled, providing access to the oil and petrochemical industry south of Sulphur and a connection to LA 27. Route description From the west, LA 108 begins at an interchange with I-10 at Exit 8 in Vinton between the Texas- Louisiana state line and Sulphur. It proceeds east for to Gum Island Road then curves southward for another to Johnny Breaux Road. Here it curves back to the east, traveling and crossing a bridge over Bayou Choupique before reaching an intersection with LA 27 and LA 1133. LA 27 runs south into Cameron Parish while LA 1133 zigzags around the east side of Carlyss. LA 108 turns north, running concurrent with LA 27 for through Carlyss to an intersection with LA 1256, which heads due north to I-10 in Sulphur. From this intersection, LA 27 and LA 108 turn to the east, and LA 27 soon turns back to the north, also connecting with I-10 in Sulphur.

LA 108 enters into an interchange with I-10 and continues north for through the Maplewood area of Sulphur to a terminus at US 90 (East Napoleon Street). LA 108 is an undivided, two-lane highway from its western terminus in Vinton to LA 1256 north of Carlyss. It then widens to a divided, four-lane highway from there to I-10 in Sulphur, after which the median is replaced by a center turn lane for the remainder of its route to US 90. History In the original Louisiana Highway system in use between 1921 and 1955, the modern LA 108 made up parts of several routes, including State Route 381 from the western terminus in Vinton to the eastern curve at Johnny Breaux Road; State Route 382 to the modern junction with LA 27 and LA 1133 south of Carlyss; State Route 104 to the modern LA 1256 north of Carlyss; State Route C-1352 to the modern LA 1133 northeast of Carlyss; and State Route 382 again from there to the eastern terminus in Sulphur (with the section north of Bayou D'Inde Road later renumbered as State Route C-2102). LA 108 was created with the 1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering, and its route has remained unchanged to the present day except for a small truncation on the western end. The original western terminus of LA 108 was located at the intersection of US 90 and Center Street in Vinton. LA 108 proceeded east on Center Street then turned south onto Gum Cove Road where it met the present western terminus at what is now the I-10 interchange. I-10 was opened parallel to US 90 through Vinton in September 1965, and the portion of LA 108 between the two highways was deleted from the state highway system around 1982, removing LA 108 from downtown Vinton.

It runs in an east‚Äìwest direction from LA 1 east of Echo to a second junction with LA 1 and LA 451 east of Moreauville. LA 114 essentially cuts off a long bend in LA 1, bypassing the city of Marksville to the south. The route travels instead through the smaller communities of Hessmer, Mansura, and Moreauville. Through traffic southeast of Mansura is directed from LA 114 onto LA 1186, connecting to LA 1 northwest of Moreauville, which leads to Simmesport and eventually into the Baton Rouge metropolitan area. LA 114 was designated in the 1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering, replacing a portion of former State Route 72 and the entirety of State Route 299. In 1965, the route was extended from its original eastern terminus in Mansura over the former alignment of LA 1, which was moved to a straighter path along the Kansas City Southern Railway line. However, this portion of the route, which is now classified as a local road, is intended to be deleted from the state highway system as part of the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (La DOTD) Road Transfer Program.

This junction is located east of Echo, a small community in neighboring Rapides Parish and southwest of Fifth Ward. LA 114 crosses the Kansas City Southern Railway (KCS) at grade then follows the rail line southeast through a rural area known as Belle d'Eau. Here, the highway crosses Choctaw Bayou just outside the Grand Cote National Wildlife Refuge. After curving due east, LA 114 intersects LA 1188, which connects to LA 115 south of Hessmer. LA 114 continues into the village of Hessmer on West School Street and intersects LA 115 (Main Street), which connects to the nearby cities of Marksville and Bunkie. LA 114 turns south, running briefly concurrent with LA 115, before resuming an eastward course along East Main Street. Exiting Hessmer, LA 114 proceeds a short distance into the larger town of Mansura, where it becomes known as Baton Rouge Avenue. In Mansura, LA 114 intersects LA 107 (Valley Street), and the two highways continue east in a concurrency for one block along Baton Rouge Avenue to L'Eglise Street. Here, LA 115 turns north toward Marksville while LA 114 turns to the southeast, intersecting LA 1186 at the southern limit of Mansura. Signage directs through traffic bound for Simmesport and Baton Rouge to follow LA 1186 eastward, as it provides a direct connection to southbound LA 1 that largely bypasses Moreauville. later, LA 114 crosses Bayou Des Glaises at Long Bridge and immediately intersects the northern terminus of LA 29, another connection to Bunkie. After cutting across a small bend in the waterway, LA 114 closely follows Bayou Des Glaises as it winds its way into the village of Moreauville. Now known as Bayou Des Glaise Street, LA 114 proceeds to an intersection with Main Street and turns due east. The roadway along Bayou Des Glaises continues straight ahead as LA 451 toward LA 1\\\\. After following Main Street through town, LA 114 continues a short distance until reaching its eastern terminus at a second intersection with both LA 1 and LA 451, essentially cutting across a massive bend in Bayou Des Glaises. From this junction, located just west of Hamburg, LA 1 provides connections to Marksville and Alexandria to the north, as well as the aforementioned southbound destinations. =Route classification and data= LA 114 is an undivided two-lane highway for its entire length. The route is classified by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (La DOTD) as a rural major collector west of Mansura, an urban collector through town, and a rural local road east of town. Daily traffic volume in 2013 generally averaged between 1,870 and 3,500 vehicles over the course of the route. The posted speed limit is in rural areas, reduced to through populated sections. The eastern portion of LA 114, running from LA 29 at Long Bridge and LA 1 near Hamburg, is part of the Louisiana Colonial Trails in the state- designated system of tourist routes known as the Louisiana Scenic Byways. History In the original Louisiana Highway system in use prior to 1955, the modern LA 114 was divided among several routes, including State Route 72 from the western terminus near Echo to Mansura; State Route 299 from Mansura to Long Bridge; and State Route 30 from Long Bridge to the eastern terminus near Hamburg. Routes 30 and 72 were two of the original 98 state highways designated in 1921. They were the main routes connecting central Avoyelles Parish with the major population centers of Baton Rouge and Alexandria, respectively. In 1928, Route 299 was created by an act of the state legislature, establishing a connection between Routes 30 and 72. These highway portions were joined together under the single designation of LA 114 when the Louisiana Department of Highways renumbered the state highway system in 1955. As the above description indicates, LA 114 originally extended east only as far as LA 107 in Mansura. At the time, LA 1 entered Mansura from the north co- signed with LA 107 and proceeded along what is now LA 114 through Moreauville to Hamburg. In 1965, LA 1 was moved onto a new, straighter alignment along the south side of the Kansas City Southern railroad tracks from Simmesport to LA 1186 east of Mansura, bypassing the Moreauville town center. LA 114 was then extended to cover the old route, establishing its present terminus at LA 1 near Hamburg. LA 1 utilized LA 1186 as a temporary connector and was co-signed with LA 114 for a short distance in Mansura until the new alignment was extended north to Marksville in 1972. The route of LA 114 has otherwise remained the same since the 1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering. Future La DOTD is currently engaged in a program that aims to transfer about of state- owned roadways to local governments over the next several years. Under this plan of \\"right-sizing\\" the state highway system, the entirety of LA 114 east of Mansura is proposed for deletion as it no longer meets a significant interurban travel function.

It runs in an east‚Äìwest direction from U.S. Highway 165 (US 165) in Pineville to LA 28 at a point east of Pineville. The route connects the city of Pineville, as well as the rural area in the northeast corner of the parish, with Esler Regional Airport. Pineville is located opposite the Red River from Alexandria, central Louisiana's largest city. Formerly the area's main airport, Esler is now primarily used as a training ground by the Louisiana National Guard. Route description From the west, LA 116 begins at an intersection with US 165 (Monroe Highway) just within the northern city limit of Pineville. US 165 connects to Monroe on the north and heads through Pineville to Alexandria on the south. LA 116 proceeds northeast on Esler Field Road and passes by Camp Beauregard, a U.S. Army and Louisiana National Guard training area. East of Camp Beauregard, LA 116 travels through a forested rural area for about before entering an area of scattered residential development known as Green Gables. east of Libuse Cutoff Road, LA 116 meets the west entrance of Esler Regional Airport, a small airfield primarily used by the Louisiana National Guard. Here, the highway makes a curve to the southeast and reaches the south entrance of the airport. LA 116 then curves to the south and travels for through an unpopulated and thickly forested area before ending at an intersection with LA 28\\\\. The eastern terminus is located east of the Pineville Expressway, where LA 28 begins a concurrency with US 167 into downtown Alexandria. To the northeast, LA 28 connects with US 84 to Jonesville and points near the Mississippi state line. The route is classified by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (La DOTD) as an urban minor arterial from the western terminus to Flagon Bayou near Green Gables and a rural major collector from there to the eastern terminus. The average daily traffic volume in 2013 is reported as 8,300 from US 167 to a point just west of Esler Regional Airport, decreasing to 3,100 for the remainder of the route. LA 116 has a posted speed limit of within the Pineville city limits and in rural Rapides Parish. It is an undivided, two- lane highway for its entire route. History =Pre-1955 route numbering= In the original Louisiana Highway system in use between 1921 and 1955, the modern LA 116 was designated as State Route 309. Route 309 was created in 1928 by an act of the state legislature. The western terminus at Camp Beauregard was originally a junction with both US 165 and State Route 14, which were co- signed north of Alexandria. The location was at that time outside the Pineville city limits in an area known as Kingsville. Route 309 extended in a straight line to what was then the artillery range of Camp Beauregard, distant. In the early 1940s, this became the site of Esler Army Airfield, now known as Esler Regional Airport. The portion of the current LA 116 extending south from the airport to LA 28 (formerly State Route 123) did not exist during the pre-1955 era. However, an eastern extension of the route was designated in 1930 as State Route 623, which did connect to Route 123 at nearby Holloway. Route 623 was eventually eliminated, and state maintenance once again ended on Route 309 at Esler Army Airfield until the 1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering. =Post-1955 route history= LA 116 was created in 1955 as a direct renumbering of State Route 309. Lengthy route concurrencies were eliminated in the renumbering, and the western terminus was now a junction with US 165 only. In 1971, LA 116 was extended southward along a newly- constructed roadway from Esler Army Airfield to an intersection with LA 28 east of Pineville. During the 1970s, Esler became the principal commercial airport in the Alexandria area, and the extension provided better access to traffic originating east of the city. Since then, the route has remained the same, although the western terminus at Kingsville is now within the Pineville city limits.

Its title is drawn from the nursery rhyme Humpty Dumpty. In 1947, Warren won the Pulitzer Prize for All the King's Men. It was adapted for a film in 1949 and 2006; the 1949 version won the Academy Award for Best Picture; the 2006 version was a massive failure. It is rated as the 36th greatest novel of the 20th century by Modern Library, and it was chosen as one of Time magazine's 100 best novels since 1923. Plot All the King's Men portrays the dramatic and theatrical political rise and governorship of Willie Stark, a cynical, socially liberal socialist in the American South during the 1930s. The novel is narrated by Jack Burden, a political reporter who comes to work as Governor Stark's right-hand man. The trajectory of Stark's career is interwoven with Jack Burden's life story and philosophical reflections: \\"the story of Willie Stark and the story of Jack Burden are, in one sense, one story.\\"Page 157, p. 236 in the Harcourt version. The novel evolved from a verse play that Warren began writing in 1936 entitled Proud Flesh. One of the characters in Proud Flesh was named Willie Talos, in reference to the brutal character Talus in Edmund Spenser's late 16th century epic poem The Faerie Queene.See All the King's Men, published 1946 Harcourt, Brace and Co., and 1953, by Random House, publisher of the Modern Library. A 2002 version of All the King's Men, re- edited by Noel Polk, keeps the name \\"Willie Talos\\" for the Boss as originally written in Warren's manuscript, and is known as the \\"restored edition\\" for using this name as well as printing several passages removed from the original edit. Warren claimed that All the King's Men was \\"never intended to be a book about politics\\".See page vi of the Modern Library edition =Themes and imagery= One central motif of the novel is that all actions have consequences, and that it is impossible for an individual to stand aloof and be a mere observer of life, as Jack tries to do (first as a graduate student doing historical research and later as a wisecracking newspaperman). In the atmosphere of the 1930s, the whole population seemed to abandon responsibility by living vicariously through messianic political figures like Willie Stark. Thus, Stark fulfills the wishes of many of the characters, or seems to do so. For instance, his faithful bodyguard Sugar-Boy, who stutters, loves Stark because \\"the b-boss could t-talk so good\\"; Jack Burden cannot bring himself to sleep with Anne Stanton, whom he loves, but Stark does so; and so on. It is in this sense that the characters are \\"all the king's men\\", a line taken from the poem Humpty Dumpty (Penn biographer Joseph Blotner also notes, \\"Like Humpty Dumpty, each of the major characters has experienced a fall of some kind\\"). The title is derived from the motto of Huey P. Long, whose life was similar to that of Willie Stark, \\"Every Man a King\\". But this vicarious achievement will eventually fail; ultimately Jack realizes that one must \\"go out of history into history and the awful responsibility of Time\\". The \\"Great Twitch\\" is a particular brand of nihilism that Jack embraces during this journey westward: \\"all the words we speak meant nothing and there was only the pulse in the blood and the twitch of the nerve, like a dead frog's leg in the experiment when the electric current goes through.\\"Page 310. On his way back from California, Jack gives a ride to an old man who has an involuntary facial twitch. This image becomes for him the encapsulating metaphor for the idea that \\"all life is but the dark heave of blood and the twitch of the nerve.\\"Page 311. Subsequent events (including the tragic deaths of Governor Stark, Jack's lifelong friend Adam Stanton, and Judge Irwin, Jack's father) convince Jack that the revelation of the \\"Great Twitch\\" is an insufficient paradigm to explain what he has seen of history. \\"[H]e saw that though doomed, [his friends] had nothing to do with any doom under the godhead of the Great Twitch. They were doomed, but they lived in the agony of will.\\" Characters =Willie Stark= The central character of Willie Stark (often simply referred to as \\"the Boss\\") undergoes a radical transformation from an idealistic lawyer and weak gubernatorial candidate into a charismatic and extraordinarily powerful governor. In achieving this office Stark comes to embrace various forms of corruption and builds an enormous political machine based on patronage and intimidation. His approach to politics earns him many enemies in the state legislature, but does not detract from his popular appeal among many of his constituents, who respond with enthusiasm to his fiery populist manner. Stark's character is often thought to be inspired by the life of Huey P. Long, former governor of Louisiana and that state's U.S. senator in the mid-1930s. Huey Long was at the zenith of his career when he was assassinated in 1935; just a year earlier, Robert Penn Warren had begun teaching at Louisiana State University. Stark, like Long, is shot to death in the state capitol building by a physician. The title of the book possibly came from Long's motto, \\"Every Man a King\\" or his nickname, Kingfish. In his introduction to the Modern Library edition, Warren denied that the book should be read as either praise for Huey Long or praise for his assassination. However, Warren did not deny that Long served as an influence or inspiration for Stark: =Jack Burden= Jack Burden is the novel's narrator, a former student of history, newspaper columnist, and personal aide to Governor Willie Stark. His narrative is propelled in part by a fascination with the mystery of Stark's larger-than-life character, and equally by his struggle to discover some underlying principle to make sense of all that has happened. In narrating the story, Jack commingles his own personal story with the political story of Governor Stark. =Anne Stanton= Anne is Jack Burden's childhood sweetheart and the daughter of Willie Stark's political predecessor, Governor Stanton. Many of the novel's passages recounting Jack's life story revolve around memories of his relationship with Anne. Like many of Jack's friends, Anne disapproves of Willie Stark. However, in the wake of a devastating revelation regarding one of her father's moral lapses, she has an affair with Stark. =Adam Stanton= Adam is a highly successful doctor, Anne Stanton's brother, and Jack Burden's childhood friend. Jack comes to view Adam Stanton as the polar opposite of Governor Stark, calling Adam \\"the man of idea\\" and Stark \\"the man of fact\\".Page 436. Elsewhere, he describes Adam's central motivation as a deep need to \\"do good\\".Page 238. Governor Stark invites Adam to be director of his pet project, a new hospital and medical center. The position initially strikes Adam as repugnant because of his revulsion to Stark's politics, but Jack and Anne ultimately persuade him to accept the invitation, essentially by removing his moral high ground. Adam's sense of violation as a result of his entanglement with Governor Stark proves violently tragic when he is informed by Lieutenant Governor Tiny Duffy that Stark has been sleeping with his sister. Adam tells Anne, \\"he wouldn't be paid pimp to his sister's whore\\". His pride demolished, Adam finds the Governor at the Capitol building and shoots him. =Judge Irwin= Judge Irwin is an elderly gentleman whom Jack has known since childhood, a man who is essentially a father-figure to him. Willie Stark assigns Jack the task of digging through Irwin's past to find something with which Irwin can be blackmailed. Jack investigates thoroughly and finds what he is looking for: an incident many years ago when Judge Irwin took a bribe to dismiss a lawsuit against a fuel company, resulting in the personal destruction of a man named Mortimer Littlepaugh. Jack presents the incriminating evidence to Irwin, and before he has a chance to use it against him, Irwin commits suicide. Only at this point does Jack learn from his mother that Irwin was his father. =Cass Mastern= One of Jack Burden's first major historical research projects revolves around the life of a 19th-century collateral ancestor, Cass Mastern, a man of high moral standards and a student at Transylvania College in Kentucky. Cass's story, as revealed through his journals and letters, is essentially about a single betrayal of a friend that seems to ripple endlessly outward with negative consequences for many people. In studying this fragment of Civil War‚Äìera history, Jack begins to suspect (but cannot yet bring himself to accept) the idea that every event has unforeseen and unknowable implications, and that all actions and all persons are connected to other actions and other persons. Jack suggests that one reason he is unable to complete his dissertation on Cass's life is that perhaps \\"he was afraid to understand for what might be understood there was a reproach to him.\\" Film and stage adaptations Besides the early verse play version Proud Flesh, Robert Penn Warren has written several stage adaptations of All the King's Men, one of them in close collaboration with famous German theatre director Erwin Piscator in 1947. The story was adapted for radio by NBC University Theatre and broadcast in January 1949. Wayne Morris played Jack Burden, with Paul Frees as Willie Stark.Bob Stepno. Newspaper Heroes on the Air ‚Äì \\"Politics: Radio Drama Explored Press & Politics Issues\\". Retrieved 21 December 2012. All the King's Men, a movie made based on Warren's novel, was released several months later in 1949. The film won three Oscars that year: Best Picture, Best Actor (Broderick Crawford), and Best Supporting Actress (Mercedes McCambridge). The movie was also nominated for four more categories. In 2001, the United States Library of Congress deemed the film \\"culturally significant\\", and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry. It is noted, however, for deviating significantly from the novel's storyline. NBC network's Kraft Television Theatre broadcast a television version of All the King's Men in May 1958. This adaptation was directed by Sidney Lumet and starred Neville Brand as Willie Stark. A Soviet TV adaptation titled Vsya Korolevskaya Rat was produced in 1971 by Byelorussian TV. It starred Georgiy Zhzhonov (Willie Stark), Mikhail Kozakov (Jack Burden), Alla Demidova (Anne), Oleg Yefremov (Adam), Rostislav Plyatt (Irwin), Lev Durov (Sugar Boy). Initially Pavel Luspekayev starred as Willie Stark, but he was gravely ill at that time and died of aortic dissection only after 30% of filming was completed, thus the movie director asked Georgiy Zhzhonov to substitute the vacated role. Another film version was produced in 2006 by writer/director Steven Zaillian, who wanted to more faithfully follow Warren's version of the story than the original film did. However, it was a critical and commercial disappointment. American composer Carlisle Floyd adapted the novel as a full-length grand opera entitled Willie Stark, commissioned and premiered by the Houston Grand Opera in 1981. Adrian Hall adapted and directed a stage version of the novel at Trinity Repertory Company in Providence, Rhode Island in April 1987. This adaptation has been staged at Trinity and other theater companies in the years since. Critical reception Contemporary response to the novel was largely positive. Writing in the New Republic, George Mayberry wrote that the novel was \\"in the tradition of many classics\\", comparing the novel favorably with Moby-Dick, The Sun Also Rises, and The Great Gatsby. \\"The single quality that encompasses these varied books\\", he wrote, \\"is the use of the full resources of the American language to record with imagination and intelligence a significant aspect of our life.\\" He ended the review saying, \\"All together it is the finest American novel in more years than one would like to have to remember.\\"Mayberry, George. (2 September 1946). \\"On the Nature of Things\\". The New Republic, pp. 265‚Äì266. The New York Times Book Review's Orville Prescott praised the book's energy, writing that \\"[i]t isn't a great novel or a completely finished work of art. It is as bumpy and uneven as a corduroy road, somewhat irresolute and confused in its approach to vital problems and not always convincing. Nevertheless, Robert Penn Warren's All the King's Men is magnificently vital reading, a book so charged with dramatic tension it almost crackles with blue sparks, a book so drenched with fierce emotion, narrative pace and poetic imagery that its stature as a 'readin' book', as some of its characters would call it, dwarfs that of most current publications.\\"Prescott, Orville.

It is associated with the pan-European Renaissance that is usually regarded as beginning in Italy in the late fourteenth century and reaching northern Europe as a Northern Renaissance in the fifteenth century. It involved an attempt to revive the principles of the classical era, including humanism, a spirit of scholarly enquiry, scepticism, and concepts of balance and proportion. Since the twentieth century, the uniqueness and unity of the Renaissance has been challenged by historians, but significant changes in Scotland can be seen to have taken place in education, intellectual life, literature, art, architecture, music, science and politics. The court was central to the patronage and dissemination of Renaissance works and ideas. It was also central to the staging of lavish display that portrayed the political and religious role of the monarchy. The Renaissance led to the adoption of ideas of imperial monarchy, encouraging the Scottish crown to join the new monarchies by asserting imperial jurisdiction and distinction. The growing emphasis on education in the Middle Ages became part of a humanist and then Protestant programme to extend and reform learning. It resulted in the expansion of the school system and the foundation of six university colleges by the end of the sixteenth century. Relatively large numbers of Scottish scholars studied on the continent or in England and some, such as Hector Boece, John Mair, Andrew Melville and George Buchanan, returned to Scotland to play a major part in developing Scottish intellectual life. Vernacular works in Scots began to emerge in the fifteenth century, while Latin remained a major literary language. With the patronage of James V and James VI, writers included William Stewart, John Bellenden, David Lyndsay, William Fowler and Alexander Montgomerie. In the sixteenth century, Scottish kings ‚Äì particularly James V ‚Äì built palaces in Renaissance style, beginning at Linlithgow. The trend soon spread to members of the aristocracy. Painting was strongly influenced by Flemish painting, with works commissioned from the continent and Flemings serving as court artists. While church art suffered iconoclasm and a loss of patronage as a result of the Reformation, house decoration and portraiture became significant for the wealthy, with George Jamesone emerging as the first major named artist in the early seventeenth century. Music also incorporated wider European influences although the Reformation caused a move from complex polyphonic church music to the simpler singing of metrical psalms. Combined with the Union of Crowns in 1603, the Reformation also removed the church and the court as sources of patronage, changing the direction of artistic creation and limiting its scope. In the early seventeenth century the major elements of the Renaissance began to give way to Mannerism and the Baroque. Definitions and debates Renaissance is a concept formulated by cultural historian Jacob Burckhardt in the mid- nineteenth century to describe the intellectual and artistic movement that began in Italy in the fourteenth century and saw an attempt to revive the principles of the Greek and Roman classical worlds. It encompassed a rational and sceptical attitude, a return to ideas of original sources and proportion and balance in art. The major ideas of the Renaissance are generally considered to have reached Northern Europe much later, in the late fifteenth century. Scotland has been seen as part of a wider Northern Renaissance that is generally considered to have stretched into the early seventeenth century, when it was replaced by the grander styles of the Baroque. However, the association of Baroque styles with Catholicism in predominantly Protestant Scotland tended to result in this trend being overlooked and the period from about 1620 to the end of the seventeenth century is sometimes characterised as a late Renaissance.A. Thomas, \\"The Renaissance\\", in T. M. Devine and J. Wormald, The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), , pp. 185‚Äì7. In the twentieth century, historians disputed the validity of the concept of a Renaissance as unique, as a reaction against the \\"dark age\\" of the Medieval, as a clear break with the past and as a unified movement.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , p. 56. Instead, they emphasised the many intellectual trends and movements that went before it, such as the twelfth-century Renaissance on which it built. It was also once common for historians to suggest that Scotland had little or no participation in the Renaissance. More recently, the significant changes in intellectual and cultural life in the period have been seen as forming a watershed in Scottish cultural history. This has been perceived as opening the path for the Reformation, and later for the modernisation of thought and social life in the Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution, to which Scotland would make a significant contribution. Court and kingship alt=A red stone courtyard with a doorway in the middle background and an ornate fountain in the mid- ground. The court was central to the patronage and dissemination of Renaissance works and ideas. It was also central to the staging of lavish display that portrayed the political and religious role of the monarchy. This display was often tied up with ideas of chivalry, which was evolving in this period from a practical military ethos into a more ornamental and honorific cult. It saw its origins in the classical era, with Hector of Troy, Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar often depicted as proto-knights. Tournaments provided one focus of display, the most famous being those of the Wild Knight in 1507 and the Black Lady in 1508 under James IV. They were also pursued enthusiastically by James V who, proud of his membership of international orders of knighthood, displayed their insignia on the Gateway at Linlithgow Palace. During her brief personal rule, Mary, Queen of Scots brought with her many of the elaborate court activities that she had grown up with at the French court. She introduced balls, masques and celebrations designed to illustrate the resurgence of the monarchy and to facilitate national unity. The most elaborate event was the baptism of the future James VI at Stirling Castle in 1566, organised by her French servant Bastian Pagez. This combined complex imagery, incorporating classical themes of the goddess Astraea and the revival of the classical golden age, with the chivalry of the Round Table. The ceremony was followed by a banquet, hunts, feasting, poetry, dance and theatre, cumulating in a staged siege and fireworks.A. Thomas, \\"The Renaissance\\", in T. M. Devine and J. Wormald, The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), , pp. 192‚Äì3. The court returned to being a centre of culture and learning under James VI. He cultivated the image of a philosopher king, evoking the models of David, Solomon and Constantine that were seen in his \\"joyous entry\\" into Edinburgh in 1579. The grandest event of his reign was the baptism of his son and heir Prince Henry in 1595. For this, the Chapel Royal at Stirling Castle was rebuilt to mirror the proportions of the Temple of Solomon. There were three days of feasting, a staged tournament and a masque featuring a ship of state crewed by classical deities and muses. Masterminded by William Fowler, it was pointedly designed to build the image of the king and support his claim to the English and Irish thrones.A. Thomas, \\"The Renaissance\\", in T. M. Devine and J. Wormald, The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), , p. 200. Groat of James V, showing him wearing an imperial closed crownalt=Images of a silver coin: one side showing a crowned king and the other the heraldic lion rampant of Scotland on a shield, both surrounded by writing. New ideas also affected views of government, described as new or Renaissance monarchy, which emphasised the status and significance of the monarch. The Roman Law principle that \\"a king is emperor in his own kingdom\\", can be seen in Scotland from the mid-fifteenth century. In 1469 Parliament passed an act declaring that James III possessed \\"full jurisdiction and empire within his realm\\". From the 1480s, the king's image on his silver groats showed him wearing a closed, arched, imperial crown, in place of the open circlet of medieval kings, probably the first coin image of its kind outside Italy. It soon began to appear in heraldry, on royal seals, manuscripts, sculptures and as crown steeples on churches with royal connections, as at St. Giles Cathedral, Edinburgh. The first Scottish monarch to wear such a crown was James V, whose diadem was reworked to include arches in 1532. They were included when it was reconstructed in 1540, subsisting in the Crown of Scotland. The idea of imperial monarchy emphasised the dignity of the crown and included its role as a unifying national force, defending national borders and interests, royal supremacy over the law and a distinctive national church within the Catholic communion.A. Thomas, \\"The Renaissance\\", in T. M. Devine and J. Wormald, The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), , p. 188. New Monarchy can also be seen in the reliance of the crown on \\"new men\\" rather than the great magnates, the use of the clergy as a form of civil service, the development of standing armed forces and a navy.J. D. Mackie, B. Lenman and G. Parker, A History of Scotland (London: Penguin, 1991), . The aggrandisement of the monarchy reached its apogee in James VI's development of the concept of imperial rule into a divine right. However, the royal image of James in Scotland may have competed with that of his wife Anna of Denmark who maintained a separate parallel court with a distinct identity, and in the first years of the 1590s she and her courtiers wore Danish fashions.Field, J., 'Dressing a Queen: The Wardrobe of Anna of Denmark at the Scottish Court of King James VI, 1590‚Äì1603', The Court Historian, 24:2 (2019), pp. 152-167, at pp. 155-7. Education =Schools= alt=A black and white reproduction of a painting of a man with a bishop's mitre and crook praying, with a window in the background In the early Middle Ages, formal education was limited to monastic life, but from the twelfth century new sources of education had begun to develop, with song and grammar schools. These were usually attached to cathedrals or a collegiate church and were most common in the developing burghs. By the end of the Middle Ages grammar schools could be found in all the main burghs and some small towns. There were also petty schools, more common in rural areas and providing an elementary education.M. Lynch, Scotland: A New History (New York, NY: Random House, 2011), , pp. 104‚Äì7. They were almost exclusively aimed at boys, but by the end of the fifteenth century, Edinburgh also had schools for girls. These were sometimes described as \\"sewing schools\\", and probably taught by laywomen or nuns. There was also the development of private tuition in the families of lords and wealthy burghers. The growing emphasis on education in the late Middle Ages, cumulated with the passing of the Education Act 1496, which decreed that all sons of barons and freeholders of substance should attend grammar schools and which endorsed the humanist concern to learn \\"perfyct Latyne\\". All this resulted in an increase in literacy, although it was largely concentrated among a male and wealthy elite,P. J. Bawcutt and J. H. Williams, A Companion to Medieval Scottish Poetry (Woodbridge: Brewer, 2006), , pp. 29‚Äì30. with perhaps 60 per cent of the nobility being literate by the end of the fifteenth century.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 68‚Äì72. The humanist concern with widening education was shared by the Protestant reformers, with a desire for a godly people replacing the aim of having educated citizens. In 1560, the First Book of Discipline set out a plan for a school in every parish but proved financially impossible.R. A. Houston, Scottish Literacy and the Scottish Identity: Illiteracy and Society in Scotland and Northern England, 1600‚Äì1800 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002), , p. 5. In the burghs, the old schools were maintained, with the song schools and a number of new foundations becoming reformed grammar schools or ordinary parish schools. Schools were supported by a combination of kirk funds, contributions from local heritors or burgh councils and from parents that could pay. They were inspected by kirk sessions, who checked for the quality of teaching and doctrinal purity. There was also a large number of unregulated \\"adventure schools\\", which sometimes fulfilled a local need and sometimes took pupils away from the official schools. Outside the established burgh schools, a master often combined his position with other employment, particularly minor posts within the kirk, such as clerk.M. Todd, The Culture of Protestantism in Early Modern Scotland (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2002), , pp. 59‚Äì62. At best the curriculum included catechism, Latin, French, Classical literature and sports.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 183‚Äì3. It took until the late seventeenth century to produce a largely complete network of parish schools in the Lowlands, and in the Highlands basic education was still lacking in many areas by the time the Education Act was passed in 1696, forming the basis of the system's administration until 1873.R. Anderson, \\"The history of Scottish Education pre-1980\\", in T. G. K. Bryce and W. M. Humes, eds, Scottish Education: Post-Devolution (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd edn., 2003), , pp. 219‚Äì28. =Universities= The Renaissance of the 12th century resulted in the emergence of some major intellectual figures from Scotland. Probably the most significant was John Duns Scotus (‚Äì1308), a major influence on late medieval religious thought.B. Webster, Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity (New York, NY: St. Martin's Press, 1997), , pp. 119. After the outbreak of the Wars of Independence in 1296, English universities were largely closed to Scots and continental universities became more significant.B. Webster, Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity (New York, NY: St. Martin's Press, 1997), , pp. 124‚Äì5. Just over a thousand Scots have been identified as attending continental universities between the 12th century and 1410. Some Scottish scholars became teachers in continental universities, such as Walter Wardlaw (died 1387) and Laurence de Lindores (1372?‚Äì1437). This situation was transformed by the founding of the University of St Andrews in 1413, the University of Glasgow in 1450 and the University of Aberdeen in 1495. Initially, these institutions were designed for the training of clerics but would increasingly be used by laymen who began to challenge the clerical monopoly of administrative posts in government and law. In this period Scottish universities did not teach Greek, focused on metaphysics and put a largely unquestioning faith in the works of Aristotle. Those wanting to study for second degrees still needed to go elsewhere. Scottish scholars continued to study on the Continent and at English universities which reopened to Scots in the late fifteenth century. alt=A coloured painting showing a man in a cap and black gown over red clothes with writing materials on a table in front of him As early as 1495 some Scots were in contact with the leading figure in the Northern humanist movement, the Netherlands-born Desiderius Erasmus (1466‚Äì1536). They were also in contact with the French humanist and scholar Jacques Lef√®vre d'√âtaples ( ‚Äì1536). Erasmus was tutor to James VI's illegitimate son, and Archbishop of St. Andrews, Alexander Stewart (c. 1493‚Äì1513).James Edward McGoldrick, Luther's Scottish Connection (Associated University Presse, 1989), , p. 28. These international contacts helped integrate Scotland into a wider European scholarly world and would be one of the most important ways in which the new ideas of humanism were brought into Scottish intellectual life. By 1497 the humanist and historian Hector Boece, born in Dundee and who had studied at Paris, returned to become the first principal at the new university of Aberdeen. The continued movement to other universities produced a school of Scottish nominalists at Paris in the early sixteenth century, the most important of whom was John Mair, generally described as a scholastic, but whose Latin History of Greater Britain (1521) was sympathetic to the humanist social agenda.R. Mason, \\"Renaissance and Reformation: the sixteenth century\\", in J. Wormald, Scotland: A History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), , p. 100. Another major figure was Archibald Whitelaw, who taught at St. Andrews and Cologne, becoming a tutor to the young James III and royal secretary from 1462‚Äì93. Robert Reid, Abbot of Kinloss and later Bishop of Orkney, was responsible in the 1520s and 1530s for bringing the Italian humanist Giovanni Ferrario to teach at Kinloss Abbey, where he established an impressive library and wrote works of Scottish history and biography. Reid was also instrumental in organising the public lectures which were established in Edinburgh in the 1540s on law, Greek, Latin and philosophy, under the patronage of Mary of Guise. They developed into the \\"Tounis College\\", which would become the University of Edinburgh in 1582.A. Thomas, \\"The Renaissance\\", in T. M. Devine and J. Wormald, The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), , pp. 196‚Äì7. After the Reformation, Scotland's universities underwent a series of reforms associated with Andrew Melville, who returned from Geneva to become principal of the University of Glasgow in 1574. Influenced by the anti- Aristotelian Petrus Ramus, he placed an emphasis on simplified logic, elevating languages and sciences to the status enjoyed by philosophy and allowing accepted ideas in all areas to be challenged. He introduced new specialist teaching staff, replacing the system of \\"regenting\\", where one tutor took the students through the entire arts curriculum.J. Kirk, \\"'Melvillian reform' and the Scottish universities\\", in A. A. MacDonald and M. Lynch, eds, The Renaissance in Scotland: Studies in Literature, Religion, History, and Culture Offered to John Durkhan (Leiden: Brill, 1994), , p. 280. Metaphysics was abandoned and Greek became compulsory in the first year, followed by Aramaic, Syriac and Hebrew, launching a new fashion for ancient and biblical languages. Glasgow had probably been declining as a university before his arrival, but students now began to attend in large numbers. Melville assisted in the reconstruction of Marischal College, Aberdeen, and in order to do for St Andrews what he had done for Glasgow, he was appointed Principal of St Mary's College, St Andrews in 1580. The result was a revitalisation of all Scottish universities, which were now producing a quality of education the equal of that offered anywhere in Europe.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 183‚Äì4. Major intellectual figures in the Reformation included George Buchanan. He taught in universities in France and Portugal, translated texts from Greek into Latin, and was tutor to the young Mary, Queen of Scots for whom he wrote Latin courtly poetry and masques. After her deposition in 1567, his works De Jure Regni apud Scotos (1579) and Rerum Scoticarum Historia (1582) were among the major texts outlining the case for resistance to tyrants. Buchanan was one of the young James VI's tutors and although he helped in producing a highly educated Protestant prince, who would produce works on subjects including government, poetry and witchcraft, he failed to convince the king of his ideas about limited monarchy. James would debate with both Buchanan and Melville over the status of the crown and kirk.A. Thomas, \\"The Renaissance\\", in T. M. Devine and J. Wormald, The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), , pp. 200‚Äì2. Literature Front page of alt=A black print on a yellowed background showing Adam and Eve with a tree between them on which is a shield with the initial WC and the name Walter Chapman printed below. In the late fifteenth century, Scots prose also began to develop as a genre and to demonstrate classical and humanist influences.A. Thomas, \\"The Renaissance\\", in T. M. Devine and J. Wormald, The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), , p. 196. Although there are earlier fragments of original Scots prose, such as the Auchinleck Chronicle,Thomas Thomson ed., Auchinleck Chronicle (Edinburgh, 1819). the first complete surviving work includes John Ireland's The Meroure of Wyssdome (1490).J. Martin, Kingship and Love in Scottish poetry, 1424‚Äì1540 (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2008), , p. 111. There were also prose translations of French books of chivalry that survive from the 1450s, including The Book of the Law of Armys and the Order of Knychthode and the treatise Secreta Secetorum, an Arabic work believed to be Aristotle's advice to Alexander the Great.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 60‚Äì7. The establishment of a printing press under royal patent from James IV in 1507 made it easier to disseminate Scottish literature.P. J. Bawcutt and J. H. Williams, A Companion to Medieval Scottish Poetry (Woodbridge: Brewer, 2006), , pp. 26‚Äì9. The landmark work in the reign of James IV was Gavin Douglas's version of Virgil's Aeneid, the Eneados. It was the first complete translation of a major classical text in an Anglic language, finished in 1513, but overshadowed by the disaster at Flodden. Much Middle Scots literature was produced by makars, poets with links to the royal court. These included James I (who wrote The Kingis Quair). Many of the makars had a university education and so were also connected with the Kirk. However, William Dunbar's Lament for the Makaris (c.1505) provides evidence of a wider tradition of secular writing outside of Court and Kirk now largely lost.A. Grant, Independence and Nationhood, Scotland 1306‚Äì1469 (Baltimore: Edward Arnold, 1984), , pp. 102‚Äì3. Before the advent of printing in Scotland, writers such as Dunbar, Douglas, together with Robert Henryson and Walter Kennedy, have been seen as leading a golden age in Scottish poetry. They continued medieval themes, but were increasingly influenced by new continental trends and the language and forms of the Renaissance. As a patron, James V supported poets William Stewart and John Bellenden. Stewart produced a verse version of the Latin History of Scotland compiled in 1527 by Boece and Bellenden produced a prose translation of Livy's History of Rome in 1533. Sir David Lindsay of the Mount the Lord Lyon, the head of the Lyon Court and diplomat, was a prolific poet. He produced an interlude at Linlithgow Palace thought to be a version of his play The Thrie Estaitis in 1540, the first surviving full Scottish play, which satirised the corruption of church and state,I. Brown, T. Owen Clancy, M. Pittock, S. Manning, eds, The Edinburgh History of Scottish Literature: From Columba to the Union, until 1707 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), , pp. 256‚Äì7. making use of elements such as medieval morality plays, with a humanist agenda. In the 1580s and 1590s James VI promoted the literature of the country of his birth. His treatise, Some Rules and Cautions to be Observed and Eschewed in Scottish Prosody, published in 1584 when he was aged 18, was both a poetic manual and a description of the poetic tradition in his mother tongue, Scots, to which he applied Renaissance principles.R. D. S. Jack, \\"Poetry under King James VI\\", in C. Cairns, ed., The History of Scottish Literature (Aberdeen: Aberdeen University Press, 1988), vol. 1, , pp. 126‚Äì7. He became patron and member of a loose circle of Scottish Jacobean court poets and musicians, the Castalian Band, which included William Fowler and Alexander Montgomerie.R. D. S. Jack, Alexander Montgomerie (Edinburgh: Scottish Academic Press, 1985), , pp. 1‚Äì2. By the late 1590s, his championing of his native Scottish tradition was to some extent diffused by the prospect of inheriting the English throne,R. D. S. Jack, \\"Poetry under King James VI\\", in C. Cairns, ed., The History of Scottish Literature (Aberdeen: Aberdeen University Press, 1988), vol. 1, , p. 137. and some courtier poets who followed the king to London after 1603, such as William Alexander, began to anglicise their written language.M. Spiller, \\"Poetry after the Union 1603‚Äì1660\\" in C. Cairns, ed., The History of Scottish Literature (Aberdeen: Aberdeen University Press, 1988), vol. 1, , pp. 141‚Äì52. James's characteristic role as active literary participant and patron in the Scottish court made him a defining figure for English Renaissance poetry and drama, which would reach a pinnacle of achievement in his reign,N. Rhodes, \\"Wrapped in the Strong Arm of the Union: Shakespeare and King James\\" in W. Maley and A. Murphy, eds, Shakespeare and Scotland (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2004), , pp. 38‚Äì9. but his patronage for the high style in his own Scottish tradition largely became sidelined.R. D. S. Jack, \\"Poetry under King James VI\\", in C. Cairns, ed., The History of Scottish Literature (Aberdeen: Aberdeen University Press, 1988), vol. 1, , pp. 137‚Äì8. Architecture The influence of the Renaissance on Scottish architecture has been seen as occurring in two distinct phases. The selective use of Romanesque forms in church architecture in the early fifteenth century was followed towards the end of the century by a phase of more directly influenced Renaissance palace building. The re-adoption of low-massive church building with round arches and pillars, in contrast to the Gothic perpendicular style that was particularly dominant in England in the late medieval era, may have been influenced by close contacts with Rome and the Netherlands, and may have been a conscious reaction to English forms in favour of continental ones. It can be seen in the nave of Dunkeld Cathedral, begun in 1406, the facade of St Mary's, Haddington from the 1460s and in the chapel of Bishop Elphinstone's Kings College, Aberdeen (1500‚Äì9).M. Glendinning, R. MacInnes and A. MacKechnie, A History of Scottish Architecture: From the Renaissance to the Present Day (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1996), , pp. 3‚Äì4. About forty collegiate churches were established in Scotland in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. Many, like Trinity College, Edinburgh, showed a combination of Gothic and Renaissance styles.A. Thomas, \\"The Renaissance\\", in T. M. Devine and J. Wormald, The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), , p. 190. alt=The side of a stone building with windows and figures on pedestals. The extensive building and rebuilding of royal palaces probably began under James III, accelerated under James IV, reaching its peak under James V. These works have been seen as directly reflecting the influence of Renaissance styles. Linlithgow was first constructed under James I, under the direction of master of work John de Waltoun. From 1429, it was referred to as a palace, apparently the first use of this term in the country. This was extended under James III and began to correspond to a fashionable quadrangular, corner-towered Italian seignorial palace of a palatium ad moden castri (a castle-style palace), combining classical symmetry with neo-chivalric imagery. There is evidence of Italian masons working for James IV, in whose reign Linlithgow was completed and other palaces were rebuilt with Italianate proportions.M. Glendinning, R. MacInnes and A. MacKechnie, A History of Scottish Architecture: From the Renaissance to the Present Day (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1996), , p. 9. James V encountered the French version of Renaissance building while visiting for his marriage to Madeleine of Valois in 1536 and his second marriage to Mary of Guise may have resulted in longer-term connections and influences.A. Thomas, \\"The Renaissance\\", in T. M. Devine and J. Wormald, The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), , p. 195. Work from his reign largely disregarded the insular style prevalent in England under Henry VIII and adopted forms that were recognisably European, beginning with the extensive work at Linlithgow.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , p. 5. This was followed by rebuildings at Holyrood, Falkland, Stirling and Edinburgh, described as \\"some of the finest examples of Renaissance architecture in Britain\\".R. Mason, \\"Renaissance and Reformation: the sixteenth century\\", in J. Wormald, Scotland: A History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), , p. 102. Rather than slavishly copying continental forms, most Scottish architecture incorporated elements of these styles into traditional local patterns,A. Thomas, \\"The Renaissance\\", in T. M. Devine and J. Wormald, The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), , p. 189. adapting them to Scottish idioms and materials (particularly stone and harl).D. M. Palliser, The Cambridge Urban History of Britain: 600‚Äì1540, Volume 1 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), , pp. 391‚Äì2. Work undertaken for James VI demonstrated continued Renaissance influences, with the Chapel Royal at Stirling having a classical entrance built in 1594 and the North Wing of Linlithgow, built in 1618, using classical pediments. Similar themes can be seen in the private houses of aristocrats, as in Mar's Wark, Stirling (c. 1570) and Crichton Castle, built for the Earl of Bothwell in the 1580s.A. Thomas, \\"The Renaissance\\", in T. M. Devine and J. Wormald, The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), , pp. 201‚Äì2. alt=A stone church with a tower in a church yard with grave markers, which is partially covered with snow. New military architecture and the trace Italienne style was brought by Italian architects and military engineers during the war of the Rough Wooing and the regency of Mary of Guise including Migliorino Ubaldini who worked at Edinburgh Castle, Camillo Marini who designed forts on the borders, and Lorenzo Pomarelli who worked for Mary of Guise.Amadio Ronchini, 'Lorenzo Pomarelli' in Atti e memorie delle RR. Deputazioni di storia patria per le provincie Modenesi e Parmensi (Modena, 1868), pp. 264-5, 271: Marcus Merriman, The Rough Wooings (East Linton, 2000), pp. 324-330: David Potter, Renaissance France at war: armies, culture and society, c.1480-1560 (Woodbridge, 2008), pp.181-2 The unique style of great private houses in Scotland, later known as Scots baronial, has been located in origin to the period of the 1560s. It kept many of the features of the high walled Medieval castles that had been largely made obsolete by gunpowder weapons and may have been influenced by the French masons brought to Scotland to work on royal palaces. It drew on the tower houses and peel towers,J. Summerson, Architecture in Britain, 1530 to 1830 (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 9th edn., 1993), , pp. 502‚Äì11. which had been built in hundreds by local lords since the fourteenth century, particularly in the borders. These abandoned defensible curtain walls for a fortified refuge, designed to outlast a raid, rather than a sustained siege.S. Toy, Castles: Their Construction and History (New York: Dover Publications, 1985), , p. 224.S. Reid, Castles and Tower Houses of the Scottish Clans, 1450‚Äì1650 (Botley: Osprey, 2006), , p. 33. They were usually of three stories, typically crowned with a parapet, projecting on corbels, continuing into circular bartizans at each corner.J. Summerson, Architecture in Britain, 1530 to 1830 (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 9th edn., 1993), , p. 502. New houses retained many of these external features, but with a larger ground plan, classically a \\"Z-plan\\" of a rectangular block with towers, as at Colliston Castle (1583) and Claypotts Castle (1569‚Äì88). Particularly influential was the work of William Wallace, the king's master mason from 1617 until his death in 1631. He worked on the rebuilding of the collapsed North Range of Linlithgow from 1618, Winton House for George Seton, 3rd Earl of Winton and began work on Heriot's Hospital, Edinburgh. He adopted a distinctive style that applied elements of Scottish fortification and Flemish influences to a Renaissance plan like that used at Ch√¢teau d'Ancy-le-Franc. This style can be seen in lords houses built at Caerlaverlock (1620), Moray House, Edinburgh (1628) and Drumlanrig Castle (1675‚Äì89), and was highly influential until the baronial style gave way to the grander English forms associated with Inigo Jones in the later seventeenth century. From about 1560, the Reformation revolutionised church architecture in Scotland. Calvinists rejected ornamentation in places of worship, with no need for elaborate buildings divided up by ritual, resulting in the widespread destruction of Medieval church furnishings, ornaments and decoration. There was a need to adapt and build new churches suitable for reformed services, with greater emphasis on preaching and the pulpit. Many of the earliest buildings were simple gabled rectangles, a style that continued to be built into the seventeenth century, as at Dunnottar Castle in the 1580s, Greenock (1591) and Durness (1619). The church of Greyfriars, Edinburgh, built between 1602 and 1620, used this layout with a largely Gothic form while that at Dirleton (1612) had a more sophisticated classical style. A variation of the rectangular church that developed in post-Reformation Scotland was the \\"T\\"-shaped plan, often used when adapting existing churches as it allowed the maximum number of parishioners to be near the pulpit. Examples can be seen at Kemback in Fife (1582) and Prestonpans after 1595. The \\"T\\" plan continued to be used into the seventeenth century as at Weem (1600), Anstruther Easter, Fife (1634‚Äì44) and New Cumnock (1657). In the seventeenth century a Greek cross plan was used for churches such as Cawdor (1619) and Fenwick (1643). In most of these cases one arm of the cross was closed off as a laird's aisle, with the result that they were in effect \\"T\\"-plan churches.A. Spicer, \\"Architecture\\", in A. Pettegree, ed., The Reformation World (London: Routledge, 2000), , p. 517. Art Little is known about native Scottish artists in the Middle Ages. As in England, the monarchy may have had model portraits of royalty used for copies and reproductions, but the versions of native royal portraits that survive from the late Middle Ages are generally crude by continental standards.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 57‚Äì9. Much more impressive are the works or artists imported from the continent, particularly the Netherlands, generally considered the centre of painting in the Northern Renaissance. The products of these connections included a fine portrait of William Elphinstone;B. Webster, Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity (New York, NY: St. Martin's Press, 1997), , pp. 127‚Äì9. the images of St Catherine and St John brought to Dunkeld; Hugo van Der Goes's altarpiece for the Trinity College Church in Edinburgh, commissioned by James III; and the work after which the Flemish Master of James IV of Scotland is named. There are also a relatively large number of elaborate devotional books from the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, usually produced in the Low Countries and France for Scottish patrons. These included the prayer book commissioned by Robert Blackadder, Bishop of Glasgow, between 1484 and 1492 and the Flemish illustrated book of hours, known as the Hours of James IV of Scotland, given by James IV to Margaret Tudor and described as \\"perhaps the finest medieval manuscript to have been commissioned for Scottish use\\".D. H. Caldwell, ed., Angels, Nobles and Unicorns: Art and Patronage in Medieval Scotland (Edinburgh: National Museum of Scotland, 1982), , p. 84. The seventeenth-century painted ceiling at alt=Four wooden beams with three sets of coloured paintings between them, made up of fruit, flowers and other patterns. Surviving stone and wood carvings, wall paintings and Scottish Royal tapestries suggest the richness of sixteenth century royal art. At Stirling Castle, stone carvings on the royal palace from the reign of James V are taken from German patterns,C. McKean, The Scottish Chateau (Stroud: Sutton, 2nd edn., 2004), , p. 90. and like the surviving carved oak portrait roundels from the King's Presence Chamber, known as the Stirling Heads, they include contemporary, biblical and classical figures.J. Dunbar, The Stirling Heads (RCAHMS/HMSO, 1975), , p. 21. Some decorative wood carvings were made by French craftsmen, who like Andrew Mansioun, settled in Scotland.Michael Pearce, 'A French Furniture Maker and the 'Courtly Style' in Sixteenth-Century Scotland', Regional Furniture vol. XXXII (2018), pp. 127-36. Scotland's ecclesiastical art paid a heavy toll as a result of Reformation iconoclasm, with the almost total loss of medieval stained glass, religious sculpture and paintings. The parallel loss of patronage created a crisis for native craftsmen and artists, who turned to secular patrons. One result of this was the flourishing of Scottish Renaissance painted ceilings and walls, with large numbers of private houses of burgesses, lairds and lords gaining often highly detailed and coloured patterns and scenes. Over a hundred examples are known to have existed, and surviving paintings include the ceiling at Prestongrange, undertaken in 1581 for Mark Kerr, Commendator of Newbattle, and the long gallery at Pinkie House, painted for Alexander Seaton, Earl of Dunfermline, in 1621. These were undertaken by unnamed Scottish artists using continental pattern books that often led to the incorporation of humanist moral and philosophical symbolism, with elements that call on heraldry, piety, classical myths and allegory. In 1502 Henry VII sent his Flemish portrait painter Maynard Wewyck to the court of James IV and Margaret Tudor.M. Belozerskaya, Rethinking the Renaissance, Burgundian Arts Across Europe (Cambridge 2002), , p. 159: J. W. Clark, \\"Notes on the tomb of Margaret Beaufort\\", Proceedings Cambridge Antiquarian Society, 45 (1883), pp. 267‚Äì8. Later in the sixteenth- century anonymous artists made portraits of important individuals, including the Earl of Bothwell and his first wife Jean Gordon (1566), and George, 7th Lord Seton (c. 1575).R. Tittler, \\"Portrait, politics and society\\", in R. Tittler and N. Jones, eds, A Companion to Tudor Britain (Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons, 2008), , pp. 455‚Äì6. The tradition of royal portrait painting in Scotland was probably disrupted by minorities and regencies between 1513 and 1579.R. Tittler, \\"Portrait, politics and society\\", in R. Tittler and N. Jones, eds, A Companion to Tudor Britain (Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons, 2008), , pp. 455‚Äì6. James VI employed two Flemish artists, Arnold Bronckorst (floruit, in Scotland, 1580‚Äì1583) and Adrian Vanson (fl. 1581‚Äì1602), who have left us a visual record of the king and major figures at the court. Anna of Denmark brought a jeweller Jacob Kroger (d. 1594) from L√ºneburg, a centre of the goldsmith's craft.Mary Anne Everett Green, Calendar State Papers Domestic, Addenda 1580-1625 (London, 1872), pp. 364-5. The first significant native artist was George Jamesone of Aberdeen (1589/90‚Äì644), who became one of the most successful portrait painters of the reign of Charles I and trained the Baroque artist John Michael Wright (1617‚Äì94).A. Thomas, \\"The Renaissance\\", in T. M. Devine and J. Wormald, The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), , pp. 198‚Äì9. Music The interior of the Chapel Royal, Stirling Castle, a major focus for liturgical music The captivity of James I in England from 1406 to 1423, where he earned a reputation as a poet and composer, may have led him to take English and continental styles and musicians back to the Scottish court on his release.K. Elliott and F. Rimmer, A History of Scottish Music (London: British Broadcasting Corporation, 1973), , pp. 8‚Äì12. In the late fifteenth century a series of Scottish musicians trained in the Netherlands, then the centre of musical production in Western Europe, before returning home. They included John Broune, Thomas Inglis and John Fety, the last of whom became master of the song school in Aberdeen and then Edinburgh, introducing the new five- fingered organ playing technique.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 58 and 118. In 1501 James IV refounded the Chapel Royal within Stirling Castle, with a new and enlarged choir and it became the focus of Scottish liturgical music. Burgundian and English influences were probably reinforced when Henry VII's daughter Margaret Tudor married James IV in 1503.M. Gosman, A. A. MacDonald, A. J. Vanderjagt and A. Vanderjagt, Princes and Princely Culture, 1450‚Äì1650 (Leiden: Brill, 2003), , p. 163. The outstanding Scottish composer of the first half of the sixteenth century was Robert Carver (c. 1488‚Äì1558), a canon of Scone Abbey. Five masses and two votive antiphons have survived in his choirbook. One of the masses provides the only example of the use of the continental fashion of the cantus firmus to have survived in Britain. The antiphon \\"Oh Bone Jesu\\" was scored for 19 voices, perhaps to commemorate the 19th year of the reign of James V. His complex polyphonic music could only have been performed by a large and highly trained choir such as the one employed in the Chapel Royal. James V was also a patron to figures including David Peebles (c. 1510‚Äì79?), whose best known work \\"Si quis diligit me\\" (text from John 14:23), is a motet for four voices. These were probably only two of many accomplished composers of their times, their work surviving largely in fragments.J. E. A. Dawson, Scotland Re-Formed, 1488‚Äì1587 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), , p. 118. In this era Scotland followed the trend of Renaissance courts for instrumental accompaniment and playing. Accounts indicate that there were lutanists at the court from the reign of James III and in the houses of the great lords and clergymen. Instruments also appear in art of the period, with a ceiling at Crathes Castle showing muses with lute, bass viol, fiddle, harp, cittern, flute and clavicord, similar to a mixed consort found in England in this period.M. Spring, The Lute In Britain: A History Of The Instrument And Its Music (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006), , pp. 451‚Äì2. Music also became one of the accomplishments of the Renaissance courtier and even royalty.K. Hinds, Everyday Life in the Renaissance (London: Marshall Cavendish, 2009), , p. 39. James IV entertained his bride Margaret Tudor during their marriage celebrations by playing \\"the clarychords and lute\\" and Margaret herself had been taught the lute as a child. James V, as well as being a major patron of sacred music, was a talented lute player and introduced French chansons and consorts of viols to his court, although almost nothing of this secular chamber music survives.J. Patrick, Renaissance and Reformation (London: Marshall Cavendish, 2007), , p. 1264. The playing of instruments, including the alt=A colour painting of a woman in a red sixteenth century dress playing a lute and looking at a book of music on a covered table, a decorated object can be seen in a window niche in the background. The Reformation would severely affect church music. The song schools of the abbeys, cathedrals and collegiate churches were closed down, choirs disbanded, music books and manuscripts destroyed and organs removed from churches. The Lutheranism that influenced the early Scottish Reformation attempted to accommodate Catholic musical traditions into worship, drawing on Latin hymns and vernacular songs. The most important product of this tradition in Scotland was The Gude and Godlie Ballatis, which were spiritual satires on popular ballads composed by the brothers James, John and Robert Wedderburn. Never adopted by the kirk, they nevertheless remained popular and were reprinted from the 1540s to the 1620s. Later the Calvinism that came to dominate the Scottish Reformation was much more hostile to Catholic musical tradition and popular music, placing an emphasis on what was biblical, which meant the Psalms. The Scottish psalter of 1564 was commissioned by the Assembly of the Church. It drew on the work of French musician Cl√©ment Marot, Calvin's contributions to the Strasbourg psalter of 1529 and English writers, particularly the 1561 edition of the psalter produced by William Whittingham for the English congregation in Geneva. The intention was to produce individual tunes for each psalm, but of 150 psalms, 105 had proper tunes and in the seventeenth century, common tunes, which could be used for psalms with the same metre, became more common. The need for simplicity for whole congregations that would now all sing these psalms, unlike the trained choirs who had sung the many parts of polyphonic hymns, necessitated simplicity and most church compositions were confined to homophonic settings.A. Thomas, \\"The Renaissance\\", in T. M. Devine and J. Wormald, The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), , p. 198. There is some evidence that polyphony survived and was incorporated into editions of the psalter from 1625, but usually with the congregation singing the melody and trained singers the contra-tenor, treble and bass parts.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 187‚Äì90. The return of James V's daughter Mary from France in 1561 to begin her personal reign, and her position as a Catholic, gave a new lease of life to the choir of the Scottish Chapel Royal, but the destruction of Scottish church organs meant that instrumentation to accompany the mass had to employ bands of musicians with trumpets, drums, fifes, bagpipes and tabors. Like her father, she played the lute, virginals and (unlike her father) was a fine singer.A. Frazer, Mary Queen of Scots (London: Book Club Associates, 1969), pp. 206‚Äì7. She brought French musical influences with her, employing lutenists and viol players in her household.M. Spring, The Lute in Britain: A History of the Instrument and Its Music (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006), , p. 452. James VI was a major patron of the arts in general. He made statutory provision to reform and promote the teaching of music,R. D. S. Jack (2000), \\"Scottish Literature: 1603 and all that \\", Association of Scottish Literary Studies, retrieved 18 October 2011. attempting to revive burgh song schools from 1579. He rebuilt the Chapel Royal at Stirling in 1594 and the choir was used for state occasions like the baptism of his son Henry.P. Le Huray, Music and the Reformation in England, 1549‚Äì1660 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1978), , pp. 83‚Äì5. He followed the tradition of employing lutenists for his private entertainment, as did other members of his family.T. Carter and J. Butt, The Cambridge History of Seventeenth-Century Music (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), , pp. 280, 300, 433 and 541. When he went south to take the throne of England in 1603 as James I, he removed one of the major sources of patronage in Scotland. Beginning to fall into disrepair, the Scottish Chapel Royal was now used only for occasional state visits, leaving the court in Westminster as the only major source of royal musical patronage. Decline and influence Francis Hutcheson (1694‚Äì1746), a major figure in the Scottish Enlightenment, product of the Scottish university system and humanist tradition that had their origins in the Renaissance.alt=A colour painting of a man with white hair that may be a wig, in a dark gown with white sleeves and collar, he holds a book in his hand. The Renaissance in Scotland has been seen as reaching its peak in the first half of the sixteenth century, between the reigns of James IV and the deposition of Mary, Queen of Scots. The loss of the church as a source of patronage in the 1560s and the court in 1603, changed and limited the further development of Renaissance ideas. In the same period civic humanism began to give way to private devotion and retreat from the world influenced by Stoicism. In art and architecture, Renaissance proportion began to give way to Mannerism and the more exaggerated style of the Baroque from about 1620.A. Thomas, \\"The Renaissance\\", in T. M. Devine and J. Wormald, The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), , pp. 193‚Äì4. The legacy of the Renaissance can be seen in the transformation of the ruling elite in Scottish society from a warrior caste to one with more refined morals and values.K. M. Brown, Noble Society in Scotland: Wealth, Family and Culture from the Reformation to the Revolutions (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2004), , p. 226. Humanism created an acceptance of the importance of learning, which contributed to the legacy of the Scottish school and university systems.J.

Specifically, the 1496 Education Act has been seen as establishing a precedent for a public system of education, which was taken up by the reformers in 1560 and informed later legislation and expansion.M. M. Clark, Education in Scotland: Policy and Practice from Pre-School to Secondary (London: Psychology Press, 1997), , p. 111. The establishment of the Scottish universities, and especially the humanist reforms associated with Melville, allowed Scotland to participate in the \\"educational revolution\\" of the early modern era and would be vital to the development of the Enlightenment in Scotland.R. A. Houston and I. D. Whyte, \\"Introduction: Scottish Society in Perspective\\", in R. A. Houston and I. D.

These circumstances have been seen by David McCrone as making education \\"vital to the sense of Scottishness\\".N. Davidson, The Origins Of Scottish Nationhood (London: Pluto Press, 2000), , p. 53. The Renaissance left a legacy across intellectual fields including poetry, historical writing and architecture, which continued into the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.J. Rabasa, M. Sato, E. Tortarolo and D. Woolf, eds, The Oxford History of Historical Writing: Volume 3: 1400‚Äì1800 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), , p. 499. A growing number of Scottish scholars emerged who had an increasing confidence in their own literature.D. Allan, Virtue, Learning and the Scottish Enlightenment: Ideas of Scholarship in Early Modern History (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1993), , p. 32. Part of the explanation for the sudden flowering of the Scottish Enlightenment, is that the country already had a history of achievements in philosophy, poetry, music, mathematics and architecture and was in close touch with intellectual trends in the rest of Europe.P. H. Scott, The Age of Liberation (Edinburgh: The Saltire Society, 2008), , p. 17. From this period Scotland would make major contributions in the fields of medicine, law, philosophy, geology and history. Among these ideas the limitation of royal sovereignty over the people remained present in Scottish intellectual life and resurfaced to contribute to the major debates of the eighteenth century.D.

History The Columbian Park Zoo was founded in 1908 and originally contained foxes, skunks, pelicans, deer, lynx, prairie dogs, and a wolf. Improvements to the zoo were made in 1928, when the main animal house was constructed and the zoo purchased an elephant with funds raised by local school students. During the 1930s, the zoo began to breed animals to share with other small zoos, and in 1943 added lions, monkeys, elk, zebras, bears, and alligators. Friends of CPZ History In 2004, Lafayette Parks & Recreation developed a master plan for the zoo. This plan called for more naturalized exhibits, a discovery center, and the return of the Columbia Park Carousel. The zoo reopened on June 30, 2007 with the improvements outlined in the master plan. Exhibits The zoo houses more than 190 animals from 90 different species. Education The Columbian Park Zoo offers education programs for children from pre-school through college.

(est. 1997) is a preservation microfilm and microfilm digitization business located in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. History The company began in 1996 when the microfilm division of Cedar Rapids-based Crest Information Technologies was sold to Christopher Gill. The microfilm division was responsible at the time for preserving newspapers and for microfilming business documents. The business document filming portion of the business was soon dropped in favor of the newspaper microfilming division. Crest in 1999 sold the remaining portion of the company to Lason. In 1999, Heritage Microfilm began digitizing newspaper microfilm and launched NewspaperArchive. Soon after, it began creating smaller \\"branded\\" newspaper archive websites in collaboration with publishing partners. The firm works with ANSI/AIIM standards for preservation microfilming. It has a humidity and temperature- controlled storage facility. It is a Kodak ImageGuard facility. One of its specializations is damaged microfilm recovery. It has an Extek 3441 microfilm duplicator, which duplicates at low speeds to prevent damage to Redox or Vinegar-Syndrome microfilm. It uses Kodak silver halide microfilm for master film and primary duplications. It discontinued the use of vesicular film for duplications, due to the poor quality film available from distributors. It claims to use Kodak BrownToner, a polysulfide film treatment, on every reel of silver-halide microfilm that they produce. NewspaperArchive right NewspaperArchive is a commercial online database of digitized newspapers, and claims to be the world's largest newspaper archive. The site was launched in 1999 by Heritage Microfilm. , NewspaperArchive said it provided full-text search for 909 million articles on 85 million pages over 240 years that represented 2,875 publication titles in more than 748 cities. As of 2015, the product includes newspapers from Azerbaijan, Canada, China, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Jamaica, Japan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, South Africa, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, the United Kingdom, the United States, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Uzbekistan. Searches can be conducted by keyword, date, and location. Results are free, but access to the newspaper articles available to download in PDF format requires a subscription. The company says that it follows the Automated Content Access Protocol in which its clients have a say in what is available online. The digitized newspapers that are currently available and OCR'd represent a fraction of the 150 million pages of historical documents that Heritage Microfilm maintains in its microform archive. According to NewspaperArchive, it has 180,000 reels of microfilm. A reviewer in 2004 observed that at the time the archive had some errors with year dates, and in June 2014, The Iowa Attorney General‚Äôs Office opened an investigation after complaints about deceptive and misleading practices that include charging subscribers for involuntary donations to a charity. NewspaperArchive claims as of 30 June 2018 that it has online newspapers dating from 1607 worldwide and its index includes 9,829 newspapers. Criticism In a 2005 Association of College and Research Libraries paper, Bernard F. Reilly, Jr. expressed concern about the extent of Heritage Microfilm's involvement with stewardship of historical resources otherwise assumed to be held in the public trust. Reilly wrote, \\"until 2002, the Library of Congress and the Center for Research Libraries regularly microfilmed the principal daily newspaper of Jamaica, The Gleaner. ... In 2002 the Gleaner Publishing Company executed an agreement with Heritage Microfilm, Inc. giving to the for-profit firm exclusive rights to reformat and distribute The Gleaner, in both microform and digital format. Because Heritage now holds exclusive digital rights the agreement effectively shifts control of back files...to the commercial sector, where it is marketed primarily for genealogists and family history researchers.\\" See also * Microdot * Microform * Microphotograph * Microprinting * Newspapers.com References Category:Online archives of the United States Category:Newspaper publishing Category:Companies based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa Category:Companies established in 1997 Category:Information technology companies of the United States Category:Photography companies of the United States ","title":"Heritage Microfilm, Inc."},{"id":"35698270","text":"Powers was an unincorporated community in Wood County, West Virginia.

The trail is part of the East Coast Greenway, a project planning to connect almost 3,000 miles of trail from Calais, Maine to Key West, Florida. The path has been planned by Bike to the Sea, a non-profit cycling advocacy group, with help from the surrounding cities.  History  The trail at the Malden/Revere border in June 2015 The Everett and Malden sections of the trail were opened with a granular recycled asphalt surface in summer 2012 and paved with an asphalt surface in August 2013. Iron Horse Preservation completed the surfacing of the Saugus section of the trail with gravel. The Revere portion of the trail opened to the public with a recycled asphalt surface in Summer 2015. The state committed $1.5 million in February 2018 to complete design of the Lynn section. A $13.7 million construction contract was awarded in February 2020 with the goal of finishing the Lynn portion of the trail, and extending the southern terminus of the trail south through Everett to the Mystic river. In September 2020 the governor of Massachusetts announced a grant of $150,000 to the city of Swampscott to build a linear park incorporating the Northern Strand along with several other existing trails.  Ownership and future status  The trail primarily runs along the Saugus Branch Railroad, a former branch line of the Boston and Maine Railroad. The trail's right of way is leased from the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority for 99 years by the respective cities the trail passes through, except in Lynn; if Lynn approves the trail in their borders, they will likely sign a similar lease. Like many nearby rail-trails, these leases include a reversion clause should the right of way be deemed more useful for other transportation uses.  Amenities  The trail features a growing number of amenities by the wayside. The first community garden opened in Malden, between Faulkner and Bryant streets, with more gardens planned. Benches overlook marshes in Saugus and Revere.

She also wrote the Theo Bloomer mystery series, under the pseudonym Joan Hadley. Series The Claire Malloy series is set in Farberville, Arkansas, and centers around Claire Malloy, who owns a small bookstore across from the campus of Farberville College. It has been suggested that Farberville is a stand-in for Fayetteville, Arkansas, with many landmarks, including the University of Arkansas-Fayetteville, Dickson Street, and even well-known local citizens, thinly veiled in the prose. The Arly Hanks series is set in Maggody, Arkansas, population 755. The main character is Arly Hanks, Maggody's irreverent young female police chief. The first book of the Arly Hanks series, Malice in Maggody, was the basis for the 1993 CBS television pilot Arly Hanks. In the Theo Bloomer series the eponymous protagonist, \\"a dignified offshoot of old Connecticut money and prestige\\", is a retired bachelor-botanist who formerly worked as a florist. In each book, family obligations take him to an exotic vacation destination, where he becomes embroiled in a mystery: in the first book, he travels to Israel to retrieve his niece, who is staying at a kibbutz hotel, and in the next he accompanies her party to a \\"luxurious villa\\" in Montego Bay, Jamaica, as a chaperone.

Revell Grange is a Grade II listed English country house situated on Bingley Lane in the suburb of Stannington overlooking the Rivelin valley within the City of Sheffield, England. The house played an important role as a focal point of early Catholicism within the city and still houses a private chapel to this day. History The original house is thought to date from 1495 but was considerably altered in the middle part of the 18th century with a new frontage and refacing added to the earlier core. The Revell family moved to the house in 1742, they had previously lived at Nethergate Hall, one mile to the east in the centre of what is now Stannington village. The family remained at the Grange until the mid-1950s but due to the failure of the direct male line, continued there under the names of Broomhead, Wright and then Sutton. The Revells were Roman Catholics and built a chapel at the Grange when they first occupied it for their own use and the small surrounding congregation. The chapel was used for Mass until February 1828 when it was closed by the Right Reverend Thomas Smith because of a shortage of priests and a dwindling congregation.\\"The Lord‚Äòs House - A History Of Sheffield‚Äòs Roman Catholic Buildings 1570 - 1990\\", Denis Evinson, , Page 22, Gives some history.\\"A Detailed History of St Vincent‚Äòs Church, Sheffield\\", No ISBN, Gives history.

In 1858 a new chapel was built on the site of the old one and was opened by John Briggs Bishop of Beverley and was dedicated to St Mary of the Assumption. Revell Grange continued to be occupied by the Sutton family until 1954 when the last descendant, Captain Revell Sutton died. Today the Grange continues as a private house.

Education Pickett graduated with a B.A. degree in photography from Moorhead State University in Minnesota with minors in Art History and Women's Studies. After graduation in 1983, Pickett moved in with her photographer uncle Roy Blakey in New York for a short time while starting an internship under the direction of American photographer Fred W.

In 1987, after Pickett was diagnosed with Burkett's lymphoma, a rare cancer characterized by the rapid growth of tumors in the body, she left New York and returned to Minnesota to begin chemotherapy. During the two years of Pickett's treatment, she concentrated on her photographic work: Kids Coping with Life-Threatening Illness. Where once she had thought she was too young to die, Pickett's paradigm shifted as she photographed and became friends with children in the hospital who were dying of cancer. Pickett says, \\"When I was on chemotherapy I was so upbeat and positive that this started coming out in my pictures. I was a positive example to people.

Pickett says that she is \\"someone who honors and celebrates the unique mix of masculine and feminine in everybody\\". Pickett's third book published in 2004, Saving Body & Soul: The Mission of Mary Jo Copeland uses her photography paired with essays and writings by Margaret Nelson to illuminate the story of Mary Jo Copeland, a housewife and mother of twelve who has overcome remarkable odds in her quest to serve the poor and homeless.  Photo Projects  * Kids Coping With Life-Threatening Illnesses * Tibetan Resettlement Project * American Indian Movement * Organic Farm Life * Sharing & Caring Hands: The Mission of Mary Jo Copeland * Tin Pan Alley  Films  In 2013, Pickett's first feature-length documentary film The Fabulous Ice Age premiered as an official selection of the 2013 Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul International Film Festival, where it was runner up for ‚ÄòMN Made‚Äô audience favorite and was selected for inclusion in Festival Best of Fest. The Fabulous Ice Age is a documentary about the history of theatrical figure skating highlighting entertainers such as Sonja Henie and Gloria Nord, featuring Pickett's uncle Roy Blakey - a former ice-skater, turned photographer. Blakey has the largest collection of theatrical ice-skating memorabilia in the world, housed at The IceStage Archive in Minneapolis.The New York Times featured The Fabulous Ice Age in January 2014 on the front page of its arts section and the film is now being distributed by Netflix and is listed on IMDb. In 2016, the Walker Art Center screened portions of Pickett's second full-length documentary First Daughter and the Black Snake chronicling the opposition of Winona LaDuke, an Anishinaabe activist, to plans to route a pipeline through land granted to her tribe in 1855. The pipeline threatens the tribe's sacred wild rice lakes and the preservation of their traditional way of life. First Daughter and the Black Snake premiered at the Native Women in Film Festival, in Los Angeles, California in February 2017. It subsequently screened at the Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul International Film Festival in April 2017.  Quotes About Keri Pickett  \\"She's a really truly concerned photographer and I think she does it out of her heart rather than the necessity to make money. And that makes a big difference.\\", says American photographer Fred W. McDarrah of Village Voice Newspaper of Pickett. Mary Ellen Mark, American photojournalist says \\"Keri Pickett's deeply moving photographs are a passionate statement of her devotion... It is rare these days to see images portrayed with such honesty.\\" Michael Fallon, writer for the Minneapolis City Pages says \\"Pickett's photographs in general are almost a kind of performance art--a ritual act of conjuring up the greater truth that lies in wait like a serpent beneath the surface. Her artistic success comes perhaps from her connection to the interior lives of her subjects, or the absolute strength of her will. In the end, Pickett puts much more of herself into her photos than a viewer is likely to realize.\\"  Awards & Fellowships  * McKnight Foundation (Photography Fellowships 1989, 1992, 1997) * National Endowment of the Arts, Visual Arts (1990) * The Jerome Foundation (1990) * Outstanding Young Alumni Award, Moorhead State University (1993) * Lambda Literary Award for \\"Best Fine Art Book,\\" for Pickett's book, \\"Faeries: Visions, Voices & Pretty Dresses (2000) * Minnesota State Arts Board Initiative Grant for Film (2009) * Minnesota State Arts Board Initiative Grant for Photography (2012)  Book Contributions  * \\"Day in the Life of the American Woman\\" () * \\"Aperture at 50\\", Aperture Books () * \\"Native Universe, Collection of the New Museum of the American Indian\\", Smithsonian [cover] () * \\"Minnesota 24/7\\", DK Publishing () * \\"At Grandmother's Table, Women Write about Food, Life, the enduring bond between Grandmothers and Granddaughters\\", Fairview Press () * \\"Minnesota In Our Time, A Photographic Portrait, 12 Photographers Document Minnesota\\", Minnesota Historical Society Press () * \\"Hugs and Kisses\\", Abbeville Press () * \\"Our Grandmother's, Loving Portraits by 74 Granddaughters\\" (), edited by Linda Sunshine, Welcome Enterprises Inc () * \\"The Mission, Inside the Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter-Day Saints\\", Warner Books ().

The mixtape was released online on February 5, 2012, coinciding with Super Bowl Sunday, at 10:17a.m.‚Äîa reference to Gucci Mane's label, 1017 Bricksquad. It was Gucci Mane's first major recording project following his release from jail at the end of 2011, after spending a total of six months incarcerated that year. Trap Back was conceived as a \\"comeback mixtape\\" to revive the rapper's reputation and career, which had stalled for years due to ongoing legal troubles and other personal setbacks. Hosted by DJ Holiday, Trap Back features 19 tracks of trap music by nine producers: Mike Will Made It, Zaytoven, Southside, Sonny Digital, Lex Luger, Polow da Don, Fatboi, and K.E. on the Track. Lyrically, Gucci Mane raps on the mixtape about topics familiar to his past work, such as drugs, sex, and life in the trap. There are guest appearances from Future, 2Chainz, Waka Flocka Flame, Jadakiss, Yo Gotti, Rocko, and Chilly Chill. According to reviewers, the mixtape's musical moods and lyrical tones fluctuate from the menacing and sinister to the playful and humorous. The recording sessions marked Gucci Mane's first sustained collaboration with Mike Will Made It, who was at the time an up-and-coming producer in the Atlanta hip hop scene. While the two had previously worked together on individual tracks, Gucci Mane's lead producer had usually been Zaytoven; Mike Will had never before been as deeply involved with the rapper's musical direction or recording process until these sessions. In addition to producing five songs, Mike Will stayed in-studio for the duration of the sessions to provide the rapper with both encouragement and, at times, blunt critiques. Though Gucci Mane was unaccustomed to recording with a producer who had such a demanding, unvarnished approach, he came to appreciate the creative results of their collaboration. Trap Back, and especially the song \\"Plain Jane\\", were popular successes for Gucci Mane. On the mixtape website DatPiff, Trap Back has been designated \\"2√óPlatinum\\" with over 500,000 downloads. Critics generally praised the mixtape for Gucci Mane's clever lyricism and its innovative production, particularly Mike Will Made It's contributions. Most reviews cited the mixtape as a marked improvement compared to Gucci Mane's recent preceding material. In retrospect, critics and Gucci Mane himself have described the mixtape as the launch of a mid-career resurgence in both the quality of his music and his popularity. Background =2009‚Äì2011: major-label releases and personal troubles = Gucci Mane performing in 2010. Around this time, the rapper seemed poised for a commercial breakthrough, but was plagued by legal issues and problems with drug use. By 2009, Radric Davis‚Äîbetter known by his stage name, Gucci Mane‚Äîhad established himself as a major figure in underground hip hop. At that moment in the rapper's career, industry insiders and observers generally believed he was poised for a major commercial breakthrough. As several critics wrote in hindsight following the 2012 release of Trap Back, Gucci Mane had seemed likely to cross-over from a hardcore hip-hop audience into mainstream pop success. According to Andrew Nosnitsky, Gucci Mane had \\"the type of feverish, mixtape-driven buzz that had previously predicted mainstream takeovers from 50 Cent and Lil Wayne.\\" Gucci Mane achieved a modicum of success with The State vs. Radric Davis(2009), his first record for major label Asylum Records after a series of releases on independent record labels. But the follow-up The Appeal: Georgia's Most Wanted(2010) underperformed sales expectations. His next album, The Return of Mr. Zone 6(2011), was delivered on a much lower recording budget and minimal promotion but sold about as well as The Appeal. Gucci Mane had numerous legal issues in these years, as well as problems with his drug use and mental health. In his memoir, he said his \\"usual routine\\" in this time period was a repeated pattern of rebounding \\"straight from jail to the studio.\\" He was drinking lean and other recreational drugs, often in prolonged binges, during which he was prone to extreme seclusion and self-imposed social isolation. His drug use occasionally manifested, in his own words, \\"bizarre behavior\\" that included \\"violent outbursts\\" but also where [he] would zone out and gaze into space.\\" He was briefly committed to Anchor Hospital, a psychiatric facility in Atlanta; this incident, along with a new face tattoo of an ice cream cone that he got days after leaving the hospital, prompted the press to portray Gucci Mane as an erratic and \\"crazy\\" personality. =2011: incarceration, recording, and release from jail= Gucci Mane served his third major stint in jail in 2011. On April 8, 2011, Gucci Mane was arrested during a visit with his probation officer on charges of misdemeanor battery and violation of probation. According to a report from the DeKalb County Police Department, the charges stemmed from a January 2011 incident when a woman recognized Gucci Mane and got into his car. Once she was in the car, the police report states, Gucci Mane offered her $150 to go to a hotel room with him. After she refused, he shoved her repeatedly until he was able to push her out of his moving car. The woman had already threatened to take legal action‚Äîand eventually reached a settlement of $58,000‚Äîbut did not file a complaint with police until April. Gucci Mane disputed aspects of the police report in his 2017 biography. Gucci Mane was locked up for three weeks in solitary confinement at Georgia Diagnostic and Classification State Prison (facility entrance pictured). Following the arrest, Gucci Mane spent three months in jail. He posted a $5000 bail but was held in Fulton County Jail for violating probation. He was sent to Georgia Diagnostic and Classification State Prison (GDCP) where, during his processing as an incoming inmate, his head was shaved to conform to prison rules. He spent three weeks in solitary confinement, which he later described as \\"three of the worst weeks I ever spent locked up.\\" He was transferred back to Fulton County Jail and spent the remainder of his jail time there. Gucci Mane recorded and released several projects between his release from jail in July and his return to jail in September. Although the three months at GDCP had been one of his shortest stints behind bars, there were significant developments in the Atlanta hip hop scene during his brief absence‚Äînotably, the rise to prominence of the producer Mike Will Made It and the rappers 2 Chainz and Future. Gucci Mane was already a longtime associate of Mike Will: the two had collaborated on several songs since first meeting in 2006, when Mike Will was a junior in high school, and Gucci Mane himself had even coined the phrase \\"Mike Will Made It\\" on the track \\"Star Status\\". With Mike Will's encouragement, Gucci Mane collaborated with Future on a song called \\"Nasty\\", followed by a track with both Future and 2 Chainz called \\"Lost It\\", and finally an entire collaborative mixtape with Future called Free Bricks, which was released less than a month after Gucci Mane's release. Gucci Mane also recorded a collaborative album with Waka Flocka Flame, Ferrari Boyz, and a collaborative mixtape with Oakland-based rapper V-Nasty, BAYTL. In September, Gucci Mane pleaded guilty to two counts of battery, two counts of reckless conduct, and one count of disorderly conduct. He was sentenced to six months in jail and ordered to attend anger management classes. He later said though I felt I'd done nothing wrong, my lawyer advised me against trying to fight it. After the year I'd just had I knew he was right. I was the boy who cried wolf by that point. Telling my side of the story would have just pissed off the judge.\\" After three months in DeKalb County Jail, he was released in December for good behavior. Upon his release, Gucci Mane told XXL is the last time I think I'll ever be in jail\\" and said the first thing he did after his release was change his clothes and head into the studio. Recording Upon his release from jail, Gucci Mane felt determined to revitalize his career with a \\"comeback mixtape\\". DJ Holiday, the host of Trap Back, said Gucci Mane contacted him out of the blue early in the morning to ask him to work on a new mixtape: Trap Back was recorded in Atlanta's PatchWerk Recording Studios. In addition to Mike Will, Trap Back features beats from Zaytoven, Southside, Sonny Digital, Lex Luger, Polow da Don, Drumma Boy, Fatboi, and K.E. on the Track. =Role of Mike Will Made It= Zaytoven had long been Gucci Mane's most closely associated collaborator, but Mike Will was the central producer on Trap Back. With production credits on five songs‚Äî\\"Walking Lick\\", \\"Plain Jane\\", \\"Get It Back\\", \\"Okay With Me\\", and \\"North Pole\\"‚ÄîMike Will contributed the most beats to the project. But beyond his individual credits, he took a more hands-on approach to recording than other producers Gucci Mane had worked with. Mike Will remained in-studio throughout the entire recording sessions for Trap Back, even when Gucci Mane was working on other producers' beats. Mike Will helped to keep Gucci Mane's morale high, even in the face of personal tragedy. Less than a week after Gucci Mane's release from jail, his close friend and 1017 Records labelmate Slim Dunkin was shot and killed. Because Slim Dunkin had been on his way to meet Gucci Mane when he was killed, Gucci blamed himself for the incident and almost fell into a \\"downward spiral\\" of despair and hopelessness. However, he stayed motivated and focused on music with Mike Will's encouragement, who he said \\"wanted to see me come back and win just as bad as I wanted it.\\" Mike Will Gucci Mane said Mike Will was a \\"perfectionist\\" who expressed his opinions directly when he thought Gucci could do better in his lyrics or vocals. Gucci Mane had written raps in prison, but Mike Will deemed them not good enough, prompting Gucci to start over with freestyling. Gucci Mane was unaccustomed to recording more than one take on a track, but Mike Will made Gucci rerecord vocals until he felt the performance was strong enough. For example, Mike Will said he liked the way Gucci Mane freestyled over \\"Plain Jane\\" in rehearsal, but was surprised when Gucci Mane completely changed his flow during recording. Mike Will asked Gucci Mane to redo the vocals the same way he had practiced‚Äîwhich Gucci Mane did, but only on the last verse. Mike Will then rearranged the order of Gucci Mane's vocals on the track, putting the last verse first. Mike Will said these critiques and edits mark the \\"difference between being a beat maker and a producer\\", because producers are able \\"to put the whole record together and make sure it comes out right.\\" Gucci Mane said he appreciated Mike Will's critiques, and both have said they had a high level of mutual creative trust during the mixtape's recording sessions.  Contents  = Intro from \\"Big Meech\\" = Trap Back opens with a phone call from Demetrius \\"Big Meech\\" Flenory, who was imprisoned at the time of recording. Trap Back opens with a phone call recorded from prison: a message to Gucci Mane from the Black Mafia Family boss Demetrius \\"Big Meech\\" Flenory, known for his affiliation with rapper Jeezy. Since 2008, Meech has been serving a 30-year sentence without the possibility of parole for organized trafficking of cocaine. Meech's appearance on Trap Back was considered surprising, given that Gucci Mane had famously beefed with Jeezy. In an interview with Atlanta hip-hop station Hot 107.9, Gucci Mane said that despite his disputes with Jeezy there had never been any conflict between himself and Meech. = Music = Trap Back is one of numerous Gucci Mane releases with the word \\"trap\\" in the title, a slang term for a house used to sell drugs. As its title suggests, Trap Back is a mixtape of trap music, a style of Southern hip hop that Gucci Mane had been associated with since its inception. Like earlier trap music, the production on Trap Back is propelled by electronic 808 percussion. But according to Anthony Walker of Dummy, the mixtape also marked a sonic transition from trap music of the preceding two years‚Äîwhen Lex Luger's style dominated the genre‚Äîwith new prominence given to sub-bass percussion and synthesizers: \\"Plain Jane\\", a track that uses a low-pass filter to make the beat sound submerged underwater, serves as an example of the mixtape's production aesthetic and Mike Will's typical style. \\"Get It Back\\" uses a sample of \\"Tetris - Type A\\" by Hirokazu Tanaka, the chiptune theme song to the 1989 version of Tetris for the Game Boy. Comparing \\"Get It Back\\" to Gucci Mane's 2009 single \\"Lemonade\\", Julianne Escobedo Shepherd noted the slowed-down version of the Tetris melody sounded like \\"cheeky flossing, the ATL version of screaming, 'in your face.'\\" Gucci Mane said \\"Blessing\\" was his favorite track on the mixtape. = Lyrics = Gucci Mane characterized the mixtape as \\"a journey through East Atlanta\\". His lyrical concerns on Trap Back include topics common to his work in general, such as drug use, drug sales, women, and money. While critics noted the topics of Gucci Mane's raps were often familiar, they praised his creative lyricism, inventive word play, and innovative flow. \\"Back in 95\\", the first full-length song, finds Gucci Mane reflecting on a lifetime as a \\"hustler\\". Calling the song \\"a rare look into Gucci's past,\\" AllHipHop's Mos Jones observed critics complain of the lack of variety in his subject matter, it is clear that [the drug trade] is all Gucci has known his entire life.\\" Gucci Mane raps about his work ethic and success on the braggadocious track \\"Quiet\\", saying \\"my money talks for me 'cause I be bein' quiet\\". On \\"Walking Lick\\", Gucci Mane portrays himself as a walking drug deal. The song \\"In Love With a White Girl\\", nominally about an interracial relationship, is also about Gucci Mane's affinity for \\"white girl\\" as in cocaine. In \\"Sometimes\\", Gucci Mane delivers an introspective verse reflecting on the recent death of his friend Slim Dunkin. On \\"North Pole\\", Gucci Mane declares himself \\"Santa Claus of the city\\" of Atlanta‚Äîa motif that recurred on his later releases East Atlanta Santa (2014) and The Return of East Atlanta Santa (2016). Guest appearances on Trap Back include Waka Flocka Flame on \\"Walking Lick\\"; Rocko on \\"Plain Jane\\" and \\"Chicken Room\\"; 2Chainz on \\"Get It Back\\" and \\"Okay With Me\\"; Future on \\"Brick Fair\\" and \\"Sometimes\\"; Chilly Chill on \\"Ghetto\\"; Yo Gotti on \\"Blessing\\" and \\"In Love With a White Girl\\"; and Jadakiss on \\"Blessing\\". \\\\---- File:2 Chainz 2013 (no watermark).jpg2Chainz File:Chilly Chill LENCH MOB Throwing The W's.jpgChilly Chill File:Future (rapper) 2014 (cropped).JPGFuture File:Jadakiss 2011.jpgJadakiss File:Wacka Flocka Flame.jpgWaka Flocka Flame File:Yo Gotti 2013.jpgYo Gotti  Release  Trap Back was released on February 5, 2012 at 10:17a.m., a reference to Gucci Mane's label 1017 Records. The release coincided with that year's Super Bowl Sunday and took place a few hours before the kickoff of Super Bowl XLVI. According to a Gucci Mane discography compiled by XXL, Trap Back was the rapper's thirtieth mixtape. Later the same day, Gucci Mane released another mixtape, Gucci Classics 2, a title he had announced shortly after his release from jail and slated for a December or January release. Gucci Mane held a Trap Back release party at the Velvet Room in Atlanta the same day as its release. According to Wilson McBee at Prefix, Trap Back was the most anticipated mixtape of the current cycle\\". Trap Back reached \\"2√óPlatinum\\" status on the mixtape website DatPiff with more than 500,000 downloads. No official singles were released from Trap Back, but Gucci Mane released music videos for the songs \\"Okay With Me\\", \\"North Pole\\", \\"Face Card\\", \\"Quiet\\", \\"Chicken Room\\", and \\"In Love With a White Girl\\". The most successful song from Trap Back was \\"Plain Jane\\", which Gucci Mane described as an \\"immediate fan favorite\\". Even though it was never released as an official single or promoted to radio stations, Gucci Mane said the song \\"killed the streets\\" and \\"was fucking people up\\", and he continues to perform the song at virtually every concert. A remix of \\"Plain Jane\\" with a new verse from T.I. appeared on Gucci Mane's next mixtape, the May 25 release I'm Up, and a video for this version of the song came out in September.  Reception  Trap Back received generally positive reviews from critics, which pleased Gucci Mane and made him feel that the effort he had put into the mixtape had been worthwhile. Critics generally agreed that Gucci Mane's lyrics and vocal delivery represented a significant improvement compared to his recent projects. Many reviewers had high praise for the production, with several critics highlighting Mike Will Made It's contributions. In a preliminary review, Tom Breihan at Stereogum said on first impression Trap Back \\"the sharpest thing he's done in quite some time,\\" called Gucci mane's raps \\"remarkably coherent\\", and said \\"the beat to 'Plain Jane' will rearrange your whole shit.\\" When Stereogum named Trap Back as its \\"Mixtape of the Week\\", Breihan wrote that it was a \\"ridiculously entertaining hour of rap music\\", noting Davis's inventive flow and the high quality of the production. Dubbing Trap Back a \\"great\\" mixtape, Jayson Greene of Pitchfork wrote \\"like all his best music, it is colorful and interesting and flagrantly dumb and sneakily clever, all at once.\\" According to Greene, the reasons for the mixtape's greatness were Gucci Mane's \\"insanely memorable\\" verses and Mike Will Made It's production, which he called \\"menacing and playful all at once, [meaning] it's a perfect match for Gucci's style.\\" Andrew Nosnitsky wrote for MTV.com that Trap Back evinced a major effort on Gucci Mane's part to avoid complacency and stagnation, comparable to Jay-Z's resurgent performance on Watch the Throne(2011). Although Nosnitsky said \\"Trap Back isn't quite the return to form that its title suggests,\\" he said it was on par with the rapper's recent work and served as a strong indicator that the rapper would show continued improvement in his next releases. A few months later, writing for London-based magazine The Wire, Nosnitsky described Trap Back‚Äîalong with Davis's next mixtape, I'm Up‚Äîas \\"uniformly excellent\\". Robert Baker of XXL said Trap Back found Gucci Mane \\"back in his element\\" with a \\"disproportionate amount of lyricism\\" on display. Baker felt the lyrics had weak spots and rehashed well-worn topics, but wrote that when he's saying the same thing in only slightly new ways, Gucc does it with flair.\\" Mos Jones of AllHipHop said the mixtape was likely Gucci Mane's best work since 2008; he called it an \\"exercise in excellent trap production\\" and said that although Gucci Mane \\"may not be the most lyrical rapper to ever pick up a microphone,\\" he \\"put enough emotion and flair into his words\\" to make them \\"float inside of your consciousness for days.\\" Writing for the UK-based Fact magazine, Jack Law said Trap Back \\"mostly succeeds because it's fun\\", describing the mixtape's overall sound as \\"an inventive, weirdly playful twist on the trap template\\" and Gucci Mane's lyrics as \\"completely conventional (he's got a lot of money, he's fucked a lot of honeyz, etc.) but so eccentrically and extravagantly depicted that they end up seeming exotic and cartoonish.\\" In a mostly negative review, Phillip Mlynar at HipHopDX said \\"the project reinforces the limits of Gucci's trap rap spiel and leaves the suspicion that his popularity has already peaked.\\" Although Mlynar found some of the lyrics amusing and enjoyed the upbeat lyrics and production of \\"Get It Back\\", he said most of the production \\"errs on the wannabe menacing side\\" and the mixtape as a whole \\"far from heralds the rejuvenation of Gucci\\". In the 2012 Rewind issue of The Wire, Trap Back was listed as one of the year's ten best hip-hop releases. Spin named Trap Back one of the 40 best hip-hop releases of the year. Three critics placed Trap Back on their ballots for The Village Voices year-end poll, Pazz & Jop.  Aftermath  In retrospect, critics have identified Trap Back as the starting point of a mid-career resurgence for Gucci Mane (pictured onstage in 2017). With the success of Trap Back and its followup I'm Up, and shortly after filming his part for the Harmony Korine-directed film Spring Breakers(2012), Gucci Mane felt ready to approach Warner Bros. Records executive Todd Moscowitz to request a budget for a new album. Moscowitz told Gucci Mane he was unable to provide a budget for an album, but he did give Gucci Mane permission to start selling his recent mixtapes on the iTunes Store for additional revenue and came up with the title of Gucci Mane's third and final mixtape of 2012, Trap God. After Trap Back, Gucci Mane released a total of seven more mixtapes before returning to jail in April 2013, including Trap Back 2. Gucci Mane said that his next album, the independently released Trap House III(2013), was the \\"culmination\\" of the comeback he had begun with Trap Back. The trap production on the mixtape influenced other producers and received retrospective acclaim. Chicago-based electronic musician DJ Rashad sampled the title track from Trap Back for a juke/footwork beat, which can be found on Teklife Volume 1 ‚Äì Welcome to the Chi (2012). The Philadelphia-based producer Maaly Raw, known for his work with Lil Uzi Vert, cited Trap Back and Trap God as formative influences. When Complex listed the best hip-hop producers of each year between 1979 and 2017, the magazine named Mike Will Made It the best producer of 2012, citing his work on the \\"underrated\\" Trap Back and I'm Up mixtapes among his notable accomplishments that year. Mike Will Made It himself called Trap Back a \\"classic\\", ranking it among his personal favorite musical projects‚Äîa list that included projects he had personally worked on as well as hip-hop albums like Dr. Dre's The Chronic(1992), Jay-Z's The Blueprint(2001), and Kanye West's The College Dropout(2004). In a primer on trap music, Thomas Seraydarian of the website Crossfader said Trap Back was \\"undeniably the most pristine distillation of Gucci Mane's energy and joie de vivre, a mixtape that posits him as an artist rather than a novelty.\\" Reviewing Gucci Mane's Mr. Davis in 2017, Evan Rytlewski said the rapper was \\"making his most engaging music since his Trap Back/Trap God resurgence\\" and moving into a third \\"legacy-defining hot streak\\".

Note the green horse's head on top of his head. In Tibetan and Japanese Buddhism, Hayagrƒ´va (\\"having the neck of a horse\\") is an important deity who originated as a yaksha attendant of Avalokite≈õvara or Guanyin Bodhisattva in India. Appearing in the Vedas as two separate deities, he was assimilated into the ritual worship of early Buddhism and eventually was identified as a Wisdom King in Vajrayana Buddhism.

Everything about him is wrathful - a scowling face with three glaring eyes, a roaring mouth with protruding fangs, a pose of warrior‚Äôs aggressiveness, a broad belly bulging with inner energy, a sword raised threateningly in his right hand (poised to cut through delusion), his left hand raised in a threatening gesture and snake ornaments. This terrifying aspect expresses compassion‚Äôs fierce determination to help us overcome inner egotism and outer obstructions. In other representations, Hayagriva has six hands, four or eight legs and three large eyes. in these versions, on the top of Hayagriva‚Äôs head are three small green horse heads. The legs stand on two corpses, symbolizing the mundane attachments that should be destroyed.Kinley Dorjee, Iconography in Buddhism, Thimphu, Bhutan: Blue Poppy, 2018, 45.

Unfortunately, values have low predictive power for actual behavior. Researchers at the Chinese University of Hong Kong decided to develop a questionnaire to measure beliefs, i.e., what is believed to be true about the world, to add to the power of values, i.e., what the person believes is valuable, in predicting behavior. They administered the original Social Axioms Survey (SAS) in five countries and used exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis to evaluate the individual-level data. Five factors were found: Social cynicism, Social complexity, Reward for application, Religiosity and Fate control. However, analyzing the data on a country-wide level yielded only two factors: Societal cynicism and a combination of the other four factors labeled Dynamic externality. The SAS has proven useful in many research contexts, and eight years later the original researchers developed an updated version, the SAS II, using a more complex methodology to increase the reliability of the various factors. The SAS II is currently being used in research as the more comprehensive and reliable measure of beliefs about the world. Definition of social axioms and their usefulness The study of values has a long history in psychological research, for instance Rokeach's value scale, which has been used widely.Rokeach, M. (1973). The nature of human values. Glencoe, IL: Free Press. Cited in Kwok Leung & Michael Harris Bond. (2008).\\"Psycho-Logic and Eco-Logic: Insights from Social Axioms Dimensions.\\"In Fons J. R. van de Vijver, Dianne A. van Hemert & Ype H. Poortinga (Eds.) Multilevel Analysis of Individuals and Cultures, pp. \`99-222. New York: Lawrence Erlbaum. That focus has also been transferred to the study of culture in psychology. The anthropologists Kluckhohn and Strodtbeck conducted a large-scale study of values in five Southwestern US cultures in the 1950s.Kluckhohn, F. R. & Strodtbeck, F.L. (1961). Variations in value orientations. Evanston, IL: Row, Peterson, New York. However, it was Geert Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory that really initiated the wave of cross-cultural research on values. His four (later increased to six) dimensions of cultural values have become a major tool in many kinds of cross-cultural research.Leung, Kwok; Bond, Michael Harris; Carrasquel, Sharon Reimel de; Munoz, Carlos; Hern√°ndez, Marisela; Murakami, Fumio; Yamaguchi, Susumu; Bierbrauer, G≈±nter; & Singelis, Theodore M. (2002). \\"Social Axioms: The Search for Universal Dimensions of General Beliefs about How the World Functions.\\" Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 33(3), 286-302. Values, however, have important limitations for predicting behavior. A value states that, \\"X is good/desirable/important,\\" but it does not indicate if a person thinks that X is obtainable. A belief, on the other hand, is a statement about how things work in reality. A social axiom, according to Leung and Bond's (2002) definition, describes how the world and society are believed to work. In other words, \\"...a typical social axiom has the structure ‚Äì A is related to B. A and B can be any entities, and the relationship can be causal or correlational.\\" The strength of a belief can vary from person to person. Furthermore, a social axiom is different from a normative belief. Normative beliefs tell us what we ought to do, e.g., be polite to everyone. Social axioms are a guide as to what it is \\"possible\\" to do.Leung, Kwok & Bond, Michael Harris. (2008). \\"Psycho-Logic and Eco-Logic: Insights from Social Axioms Dimensions.\\" In Fons J. R. van de Vijver, Dianne A. van Hemert & Ype H. Poortinga (Eds.) Multilevel Analysis of Individuals and Cultures, pp. \`99-222. New York: Lawrence Erlbaum. Leung and Bond (2008) provide a formal definition of social axioms: > \\"Social axioms are generalized beliefs about people, social groups, social > institutions, the physical environment, or the spiritual world as well as > about categories of events and phenomena in the social world. These > generalized beliefs are encoded in the form of an assertion about the > relationship between two entities or concepts.\\" Social axioms act as a practical guide to human conduct in everyday life. They function in at least four ways. \\"They facilitate the attainment of important goals (instrumental), help people protect their self-worth (ego-defensive), serve as a manifestation of people's values (value-expressive), and help people understand the world (knowledge).\\" Leung and Bond (2002) also argue that because people in all cultures face similar challenges in everyday life, these axioms should be universal, even if people in each culture do not believe in them with the same strength. Development The Social Axioms Survey (SAS) was developed with the cooperation of researchers in Hong Kong and Venezuela, using materials from local residents along with sources in the psychology literature to develop and screen items for the Survey. The survey was then refined using data from Japan, the USA and Germany. =Generating survey items= Three methods were used to generate a list of possible items for the Survey: *Examining the extensive literature already existing on beliefs in the English-language psychology literature *Content analysis of popular literature in Hong Kong and Venezuela, including newspapers, textbooks, language surveys, proverbs, popular songs, etc. *Interviews with adults in Hong Kong and Venezuela, both \\"on the street\\" and in-depth. Three sets of interview questions were used: \\"...(a) the beliefs and principles that guide their interactions with others, and their beliefs about everyday matters, (b) beliefs with regard to the self, other people, social relations, social groups, the environment, and the supernatural, and (c) beliefs with regard to issues on health, love, marriage, society, politics, religion, entertainment/recreation, work, family, sports and life in general\\". =Screening the items and assembling the Survey= Of the more than four thousand items collected, only about a third came from the professional literature, and the other two-thirds from non-academic sources. These items were classified, similar items were eliminated, and the remaining items were rewritten to be clear. The rewritten items were then classified into 33 subcategories, and the subcategories supplemented with newly generated items to give equal coverage. The first working version contained 182 items. Scoring used a 5-point Likert-type scale, which ranged from \\"strongly believe\\" to a neutral midpoint \\"no opinion\\", to \\"strongly disbelieve\\", A standard English version was used to generate Chinese and Spanish versions. =First administration= The Survey was administered in both Venezuela and Hong Kong, using both university students (100 and 128 respectively), and citizens approached on the street (122 and 230). The adults completing the survey covered a range of ages, both genders and, in Venezuela, both urban and working participants. =Analyzing the results= The data were analyzed separately for Hong Kong and Venezuela using cluster analysis as well as exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis to see if there were patterns of relationship among the beliefs within each culture. The analysis pointed to a five factor solution ‚Äì five clusters of beliefs that seem to be interrelated. The five factors overlapped substantially between the Hong Kong and Venezuelan samples, indicating that they were valid for both cultures. For a second analysis, the scores from both cultures were combined, and principal components analysis was used. Five factors were again obtained. The survey was shortened by eliminating items that had low factor loadings or were inconsistent with the meaning of their factors, resulting in a final survey of 60 questions. =Expanding the study= Another study was conducted to explore the SAS in three more cultures with differing value orientations on Hofstede's cultural dimensions scale. The questionnaire was given to college students in Germany, Japan and the United States. Confirmatory factor analysis checked by Procrustes rotation was used to analyze the data, and again five factors were found, although some differences between cultures were found, especially for Spirituality (subsequently renamed Religiosity) and Fate control. Description of the factors The bulk of social axiom research has revolved around the five factors identified in the original set of studies: *Social cynicism: \\"...a negative assessment of human nature, a biased view against some groups of people, a mistrust of social institutions, and a belief that people disregard ethical means in achieving their ends.\\" Sample items: \\"Powerful people tend to exploit others; \\"Kind-hearted people usually suffer losses;\\" \\"It is rare to see a happy ending in real life.\\" *Social complexity: \\"...there are multiple ways of achieving a given outcome and ...a given person's behavior is inconsistent from situation to situation.\\" Sample items: \\"Human behavior changes with the social context;\\" \\"One has to deal with matters according to the specific circumstances;\\" \\"To deal with things in a flexible way leads to success.\\" *Reward for application: \\"...effort, knowledge, careful planning, and the investment of these and other resources will lead to positive results.\\" Sample items: Hard-working people will achieve more in the end;\\" \\"Adversity can be overcome by effort;\\" \\"Every problem has a solution.\\" *Religiosity (originally called Spirituality): \\"...assert[s] the existence of a supernatural being and the beneficial social functions of religious institutions and practices.\\" Sample items: \\"There is a supreme being controlling the universe.\\" \\"Belief in a religion helps one understand the meaning of life;\\" \\"Religious faith contributes to good mental health.\\" *Fate control: \\"...a belief that life events are determined by grand external forces, but reassuringly, there are some ways for people to influence the impact of these forces.\\" Sample items: \\"Fate determines one's successes and failures\\"; \\"Good luck follows if one survives a disaster\\"; \\"Most disasters can be predicted.\\" Subsequently, researchers have proposed the addition of a sixth social axiom, belief in a zero-sum game. Multilevel analysis Cross- cultural studies have analyzed data at two levels. Analysis can use the scores from individuals as data for statistical analysis, as the original SAS studies did, or it can use the averages of whole countries as data points, as Hofstede's values study did. These two methods can give very different results, since the patterns of scores within a country may be different from the average of the whole country sample.Bond, Michael Harris; Leung, Kwok; Au, Al; Tong, Kwot-Kit; Carrasquel, Sharon Reimel de; Murakami, Fumio; Yamaguchi, Susumu; Bierbrauer, G≈±nter; Singelis, Theodore M.; Broer, Markus, et al. (2004). Culture-Level Dimensions of Social Axioms and Their Correlates across 41 Cultures. Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 35(5), 548-570. To determine the factor structure of the SAS at the culture level Bond, Leung et. al. (2004) collected and analyzed SAS scores from 41 cultures. The data were analyzed at both the individual and country level. While the individual data yielded the expected five-factor structure, the country-level analysis yielded only a two-factor solution. Almost all items in one factor are contained in the original factor Social cynicism, so the factor was named Societal cynicism. The other factor contains items from the other four original factors. It was named Dynamic externality, combining both the \\"external\\" aspects of religiosity and fate control, and the \\"dynamic\\" aspects of Reward for application. Only one item from Social complexity appeared. Development of the Social Axioms Survey II Eight years after their original construction of the SAS, the researchers developed a revised version (the SAS II) to improve its reliability. The earlier reliabilities of Social complexity and Fate control were lower than they liked, and they hoped to generally improve its performance between cultures.Leung, Kwok; Lam, Ben C. P.; Bond, Michael Harris; Conway, Lucian Gideon III; Gornick, Laura Janelle; Amponsah, Benjamin; Boehnke, Klaus; Dragolov, Georgi; et. al. (2012). Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 43(5), 833-857.> In developing the SAS II a different strategy was used. The original SAS was deductive ‚Äì it examined the data and then constructed the axiom categories. The weakness of this method is that some categories may not have been adequately represented in the original group of items. Over the course of eight years, research had shown that the SAS was valid, and could be used in a theory-driven approach to build the SAS II. Another difficulty with the original SAS was that the scale was developed using many Western-influenced items. Those items might not have the same meaning in other cultures, and axioms derived from those items might not be adequately valid. Van de Vijver and Leung (1997) proposed the \\"culturally decentered\\" approach, in which items are created by researchers from many cultural groups, and the final questionnaire is analyzed so that items that are answered differently by different groups are changed or eliminated.Van de Vijver, F. & Leung, K. (1997). Methods and data analysis for cross-cultural research. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage. The culturally-decentered approach was used for the development of the SAS II. The SAS II yielded more reliable measures of Social complexity and Fate Control, and showed that Fate control could be sub-divided into two separate components, Fate determination and Fate alterability. Representative research using survey Level of knowledge of a culture's social axioms predicts adjustment levels of immigrants. Kurman and Ronen-Eilon (2004) demonstrated that an immigrant's level of knowledge of the host culture's social axioms is a better predictor of adjustment than whether the immigrant shares the host culture's values or social axioms themselves. This is in agreement with Berry's model of acculturation, which maintains that the best strategy for immigrant success is integration ‚Äì learning how to operate in the host culture without assimilating one's own values and beliefs completely.Kurman, Jenny & Ronen-Eilon, Carmel (2004). \\"Lack of Knowledge of a Culture's Social Axioms and Adaptation difficulties among Immigrants.\\" Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 35(2), 192-208.Berry, J.W.

Social axioms supplement the predictive power of values. Bond et. al. showed that using social axioms added to the power of values to predict vocational choice, style of conflict resolution and style of coping.Bond, Michael Harris; Leung, Kwok; Au, Al; Tong, Kwok-kit; & Chemonges-Nielson, Zoe (2004). \\"Combining Social Axioms with Values in Predicting Social Behaviors.\\" European Journal of Personality, 18: 177-191.> See also *Cross-cultural psychology Notes Further reading * Leung, Kwok; & Bond, Michael Harris (Eds.)

Like all species in the genus Daphniphyllum, D. macropodum is dioecious, that is male and female flowers are borne on different plants. The timber is used in China in construction and furniture making. It is grown as an ornamental plant, chiefly for its foliage. Description Daphniphyllum macropodum is a small tree or shrub, usually tall, but occasionally up to tall. It has long leaves, long by wide, with purplish red stalks (petioles) and conspicuous veins. The leaves are arranged in a tight spiral, almost like whorls at the branch tips. Very young branches are red, turning brown with age; older trunks are greyish brown. The clusters of flowers (inflorescences) emerge from leaf axils on the previous year's growth. Each cluster has a pink bract at its base which initially encloses it; they have been described as being like \\"miniature tissue-wrapped bunches of grapes\\". The tiny flowers, which have a disagreeable smell, lack sepals or petals. Each plant is either male or female (i.e. has flowers with either functional stamens or functional ovaries). Male flowers have 6‚Äì12 pink stamens, about long. Female flowers have a single green ovary, 2‚Äì3 mm (0.1 in) long; they sometimes also have staminodes ‚Äì nonfunctional stamens. When female flowers are fertilized, purplish brown fruits (drupes) develop, about long. Daphniphyllum macropodum 120502-2.jpgMale flowers (in cultivation at the Birmingham Botanical Gardens) Daphniphyllum macropodum (flower female).jpgFemale flowers in Japan Taxonomy Daphniphyllum macropodum was first described by Friedrich Miquel in 1867. In 1966, Tseng Chieng Huang reduced it to D. himalayense subsp. macropodum.Search for \\"Daphniphyllum\\", Other sources, such as the Flora of China and the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families (WCSP), do not accept this placement. Further synonyms include D. humile Maxim. ex Franch. & Sav., which has also been treated as D. macropodum subsp. (or var.) humile, names not accepted by the WCSP. Fossil record Among the middle Miocene Sarmatian palynoflora from the Lavanttal Basin Austria, researchers have firmly recognized Daphniphyllum fossil pollen. The sediment containing the Daphniphyllum fossil pollen had accumulated in a lowland wetland environment with various vegetation units of mixed evergreen/deciduous broadleaved/conifer forests surrounding the wetland basin. Key relatives of the fossil taxa found with Daphniphyllum are presently confined to humid warm temperate environments, suggesting a subtropical climate during the middle Miocene in Austria.Combined LM and SEM study of the middle Miocene (Sarmatian) palynoflora from the Lavanttal Basin, Austria: part III.

Cultivation D. macropodum, like other species in the genus, can be grown as an ornamental evergreen shrub or small tree, when its main attractions are its large leaves and pink-flushed new growth. A sheltered situation in moist but well-drained soil is recommended. The newly emerged shoots are easily damaged by frost. Although growing to become a small tree in its natural habitat, in gardens it is more often found as a well-branched shrub. Propagation is by heel cuttings or fresh seed.  Uses  The leaves are dried and smoked by the Ainu in Japan and Siberia.

Vacancy The vacancy was caused by the death of the sitting member, Sir George White, on 11 May 1912 at the age of 72. He had been the MP there since 1900. Electoral history The constituency was a safe Liberal seat, which they had won at every election since its creation in 1885. The result at the last general election was clear cut; George White Candidates *The Liberal Party selected 41-year-old Edward Hemmerde to defend the seat. He was a barrister who had been appointed Recorder of Liverpool in 1909. He had sat as Liberal MP for East Denbighshire from 1906 to December 1910, when he left to contest the Conservative seat of Portsmouth but was defeated. *The Conservatives re-selected 54-year-old Neville Jodrell, who had been their candidate in both 1910 general elections. Campaign Hemmerde was a fanatical advocate of a Single tax system, based on a Land Value tax, and he made this issue the centre of his campaign. He argued that a Land Value tax meant \\"raising wages and solving the rural housing problem\\". He endorsed the programme of the National Agricultural Labourers and Rural Workers Union, which called for Trade Boards to set agricultural wages. A Land Value tax was not Liberal Party policy, but Liberal Chancellor of the Exchequer David Lloyd George, sent Hemmerde a message of support in which he agreed to \\"a thorough reorganization of the land system\\".By-Elections in British Politics, 1832-1914 Result The Liberals held the seat, with only a small swing away from them: Edward Hemmerde Aftermath The result brought the issue of Land Value taxation to the fore of Liberal government thinking. Lloyd George sat down with Hemmerde and the Single Taxers to devise new land policies to present to the electors at the next general election. A general election was due to take place by the end of 1915. By the autumn of 1914, the following candidates had been adopted to contest that election. However, due to the outbreak of World War I, the election did not take place. Boundary changes resulted in the constituency being abolished and merged into King's Lynn. Hemmerde was promised government endorsement, but was denied the coalition coupon and decided not to contest the 1918 general election.

The emerald is estimated to be worth between $3.2 and $5 million (USD). It was part of the treasure on board the ship Nuestra Se√±ora de Atocha, also referred to as the Atocha. The Atocha was the largest Spanish treasure galleon in a fleet of twenty-eight ships bound for Spain which sank along with seven others in a hurricane on September 6, 1622. It sank with the Atocha Star emerald, the highest graded emerald of all Atocha Emeralds.  History  Mel and Deo Fisher searched for the Atocha for 16 years and in 1985 found the mother lode worth more than $400 million US (approximately 1/2 of the treasure listed on the manifest). They discovered \\"Emerald City\\" about from the \\"main pile\\" of the Atocha. Emerald City yielded 13,500 carats of emeralds that were originally mined at Muzo, Colombia. The \\"Atocha Star\\" emerald was graded as 1AA with an uncut weight of 25.87 carats. It was chosen by Mel Fisher as a gift to Deo Fisher, his wife. The emerald was selected based on its size, brilliant color, and quality. Generally, artifacts of this kind are not altered because of their historical significance; however, as a gift for Deo Fisher, in 1992 the emerald was cut down to 12.72 carats, making it one of the largest and the only named cut emerald from the Atocha. The Atocha Star is currently mounted between the claws of an solid gold statue of an eagle, known as The Golden Eagle or The Maltese Eagle.  Theft  On May 30, 2016, the Golden Eagle on which the Atocha Star Emerald is mounted, was stolen from its owner Ron Shore, in Vancouver, British Columbia. The heist occurred in the 4700 block of 57th street while it was being loaded into a vehicle. The statue had been on display for four days at the Art Vancouver exhibit and has still not been located.

It runs in a southwest to northeast direction from U.S. Highway 165 (US 165) in Tullos to a second junction with US 165 northeast of Olla. The entire route parallels US 165, one of the state's major north‚Äìsouth highways, between Alexandria and Monroe. LA 125 passes through the small communities of Tullos, Urania, and Olla, whose centers are bypassed by US 165\\\\. In Tullos, the route intersects US 84, an east‚Äìwest highway connecting to the nearby parish seats of Winnfield and Jena. Though the route serves an overall north‚Äìsouth function, signage for LA 125 does not carry directional banners. LA 125 was the original route of US 165 through LaSalle Parish. Some junctions along the route include signage identifying it as the \\"historic route\\" of the highway. Route description From the southwest, LA 125 begins at an intersection with US 165 just inside Tullos, a small town in northwestern LaSalle Parish. US 165 connects to Alexandria on the south and Monroe on the north. LA 125 briefly proceeds northwest along South Main Street. At Fullerton Road, the highway turns northeast and continues along South Main Street to the town's main junction, an intersection with US 84\\\\. US 84 connects to Jena, the parish seat, as well as Winnfield, the parish seat of neighboring Winn Parish. LA 125 continues northeast along Main Street, exiting Tullos and intersecting LA 125 Spur, which connects to the parallel US 165\\\\. Soon afterward, LA 125 curves to the north briefly before resuming its northeastern course across a bridge over Chickasaw Creek. The highway then approaches and begins to run parallel to the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) tracks into the town of Urania. Here, LA 125 intersects LA 3259 (East Hardtner Drive), the town's connection to US 165\\\\. LA 125 turns northwest, briefly continuing the route of LA 3259 across the UPRR tracks before curving northeast onto Tannehill Drive. The highway continues for through a residential area, at which point it crosses the town limits at Pentecostal Church Road. Shortly afterward, LA 125 passes by a large lumber mill. later, LA 125 intersects LA 124, and the two highways begin a concurrency into the town of Olla. Here, the roadway rejoins the railroad tracks and becomes known as Front Street. Reaching the town center, LA 125 intersects LA 127 (Central Avenue), another connection to Jena. While LA 125 proceeds northeast along the railroad, LA 124 crosses the tracks via Central Avenue, ending the concurrency with LA 125\\\\. After several blocks, Olla's historic commercial buildings disappear, and the surroundings become rural once again. past the town limit, LA 125 passes through a point known as Standard, where it makes a sharp curve to the opposite side of the UPRR tracks. The route continues northeast for a final , where it crosses into Caldwell Parish and immediately rejoins US 165. The route is classified as a rural major collector by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (La DOTD). The posted speed limit is generally between points, reduced to or through town. Average daily traffic volume in 2013 is reported as 850 vehicles for the majority of the route, running from US 84 in Tullos to Standard. The southern and northern ends of the route have lower counts of 550 and 570 vehicles, respectively. LA 125 is an undivided, two-lane highway for its entire length. History In the original Louisiana Highway system in use between 1921 and 1955, the modern LA 125 was originally part of State Route 14, which followed the Lone Star Route from Alexandria to the Arkansas state line northeast of Bastrop. In 1926, this became part of the original route of US 165, which duplicated Route 14 north of Alexandria. Between the late 1940s and mid-1950s, US 165 was relocated in northwestern LaSalle Parish to bypass the communities along the Missouri Pacific (now the Union Pacific) railroad line. This straightened the route and eliminated several grade crossings. The current alignment bypassing Urania and Olla opened around 1949 with the former alignment becoming State Route C-2113. The present LA 125 Spur connected the old and new alignments until the completion of the Tullos bypass after the 1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering. LA 125 was created in the 1955 renumbering following the portion of former State Route C-2113 running through Urania and Olla to the Caldwell Parish line. At this time, the route began at the present intersection of US 165 and LA 3259 in Urania. LA 125 followed LA 3259 into the center of town then turned northeast and proceeded along its present route to US 165 at the parish line. By 1958, the relocation of US 165 had been extended southwest to bypass Tullos with the LA 125 designation extended over the old route through town. Since then, the route of LA 125 has remained the same. The two roads connecting US 165 with LA 125 at Urania and a point northeast of Tullos remained in the state highway system and were later designated as spur routes of LA 125\\\\. Due to their close proximity, the Urania spur has since been renumbered as LA 3259. Future La DOTD is currently engaged in a program that aims to transfer about of state-owned roadways to local governments over the next several years. Under this plan of \\"right-sizing\\" the state highway system, the route of LA 125 is proposed to be shortened on either end, retaining the middle section between US 84 in Tullos and LA 127 in Olla. LA 125 Spur is also proposed for deletion as it does not meet a significant interurban travel function. Major intersections Spur routes =Tullos (current)= Louisiana Highway 125 Spur (LA 125 Spur) runs in an east‚Äìwest direction, connecting LA 125 with US 165 northeast of Tullos. The route was created shortly after the 1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering when US 165 was moved onto its present route bypassing Tullos. Before the bypass was opened, US 165 curved onto what is now LA 125 via the present spur route and followed LA 125 through town. At this time, LA 125 ended in Urania, connecting to US 165 via the present LA 3259, which was formerly also designated as LA 125 Spur. =Urania (former)= Louisiana Highway 125 Spur (LA 125 Spur) ran in a northwest to southeast direction along the present LA 3259 (East Hardtner Drive), connecting LA 125 with US 165 in Urania. Like the current LA 125 Spur, the route was created shortly after the 1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering when US 165 was moved onto its present route bypassing the nearby town of Tullos. Before the bypass was opened, LA 125 began at the present intersection of US 165 and LA 3259\\\\. It followed LA 3259 into town where it joined the current route and proceeded northeast toward Olla. After the re-routing of US 165, LA 125 was extended over its former route through Tullos. The connection between US 165 and Urania became a spur route of LA 125 until 1991, when it was renumbered to LA 3259 due to its close proximity to the other LA 125 Spur near Tullos.

History =Pre-1955 route numbering= In the original Louisiana Highway system in use between 1921 and 1955, the modern LA 130 was designated as State Route 239. Route 239 was created in 1928 by an act of the state legislature. It originally followed a longer route that began on the Caldwell‚ÄìFranklin parish line at the Boeuf River. From there, it proceeded east along the present route of LA 4 to a point just beyond Mason where it continued northeast onto what is now a local road to the present route of LA 135\\\\. It then followed LA 135 northward through Liddieville to the western terminus of the present LA 130, a point formerly known as Ogden. This western portion of the route overlapped six state route designations and was dropped prior to the 1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering. Only the portion between Ogden and Winnsboro remained under the designation of Route 239. =Post-1955 route history= LA 130 was created in 1955 as a direct renumbering of State Route 239. Its route has remained the same to the present day. The eastern terminus at LA 15 in Winnsboro was then, as it remains today, also a junction with LA 4 and LA 17. US 425 was added to the list in 2005 after its extension from Bastrop southward to Natchez, Mississippi, overlapping LA 15 through Winnsboro.

It runs in a southwest to northeast direction from LA 15 in St. Genevieve to U.S. Highway 84 (US 84) and U.S. Highway 425 (US 425) in Vidalia. The route parallels the west bank of the Mississippi River, which forms the border between Louisiana and Mississippi. It connects Vidalia, the parish seat, with LA 15 southwest of town. Vidalia lies directly opposite the river from Natchez, Mississippi, the two being connected via the Natchez‚ÄìVidalia Bridge on US 84/US 425\\\\. Originally a longer route that followed an overall north‚Äìsouth direction, LA 131 was truncated in favor of an extension of LA 15\\\\. Though it now runs in a more diagonal fashion and carries no directional banners, the route still performs a north‚Äìsouth travel function and is treated in the state highway system as such. Route description From the south, LA 131 begins at an intersection with LA 15 in St. Genevieve. LA 15 parallels the Mississippi River north through points such as Deer Park and, upon reaching the junction with LA 131, turns to the northwest toward Ferriday. LA 131 proceeds straight ahead, curving eastward with the river through a rural area toward Vidalia, the parish seat of Concordia Parish. After , LA 131 crosses the town limit and intersects LA 3180 (J. Logan Sewell Drive), which connects with US 84 and US 425 on the west side of town. LA 131 enters Vidalia on Martin Luther King Avenue and curves to the northeast, passing through a largely residential area. After , the route ends at an intersection with US 84-425 (Carter Street), the main highway through Vidalia. The northern terminus of LA 131 is located from the foot of the Mississippi River Bridge, which crosses the state line into Natchez, Mississippi. US 84 and US 425 run concurrently between Natchez and Ferriday, to the northwest. =Route classification and data= The route is classified by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (La DOTD) as a rural major collector from the southern terminus to a point near LA 3180 and as an urban collector from there to the northern terminus. The average daily traffic volume in 2013 is reported as 3,400 for the majority of the route, with a slightly lower figure of 3,200 in Vidalia between Gillespie Street and the northern terminus. The route has a posted speed limit within Vidalia of from LA 3180 to Gillespie Street, reduced to from there to the northern terminus. LA 131 is an undivided two-lane highway for its entire length. LA 131 is a small part of the ten- state Great River Road, which is designated as a National Scenic Byway. History In the original Louisiana Highway system in use between 1921 and 1955, the modern LA 131 made up the northern portion of State Route 49. Route 49 was designated in 1921 by an act of the state legislature, roughly following the present LA 15 corridor southward along the Mississippi River from Vidalia to a point south of Shaw. It was projected to continue across the Lower Old River to Route 30 (the current LA 418) near Torras, but this section of the roadway was never constructed during the pre-1955 era. LA 131 was created with the 1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering, following the former Route 49 from Vidalia southward as far as Shaw. Minor alterations in the route are indicated in the late 1950s, including a straightening of the route at Willetts (or Morville) and a smoother transition at Deer Park where the roadway descends from the river levee. In the early 1960s, LA 15 was extended south from Clayton to Ferriday over US 65 (now US 425) and from there to LA 131 at St. Genevieve over a new alignment. LA 15 then replaced the LA 131 designation between St. Genevieve and Shaw. Shortly afterward, a further extension of LA 15 was constructed southward into Pointe Coupee Parish to connect with LA 1 at Lettsworth, essentially completing the route that had been planned for the former State Route 49 in 1921. Since the early 1960s, the only change in the route of LA 131 has been a slight alteration in Vidalia that shifted the northern terminus at US 84/US 425 away from the foot of the Mississippi River Bridge.

Its southern terminus (LA 134) leads to Monroe in neighboring Ouachita Parish, as well as the village of Oak Ridge in southern Morehouse Parish. The northern terminus is located at the east end of the concurrency of US 165 and US 425\\\\. The two highways split toward Monroe and the Arkansas state line, respectively, after heading west into Bastrop, the parish seat. Route description LA 138 near the junction with LA 3051 From the south, LA 138 begins at an intersection with LA 134 (Coulee Swamp Road) in southern Morehouse Parish. LA 134 connects to the city of Monroe on the southwest and the village of Oak Ridge on the east. LA 138 proceeds northward along Doss Highway through rural farmland and crosses the Union Pacific Railroad tracks at a point known as Windsor. later, LA 138 intersects LA 554 (Perryville Road), which heads west to US 165 between Monroe and Bastrop. Here, the highway curves to the northeast and heads into Collinston. LA 138 runs through Collinston on Main Street, first curving due east, then making a zigzag at Keller Drive. Two blocks later, LA 138 reaches the UPRR tracks and turns to the north, passing by the city hall and museum. It then makes a second crossing over the UPRR and intersects LA 593 at the north end of town. While LA 593 heads northwest toward Bastrop, the parish seat, LA 138 curves to the northeast and soon begins to parallel the UPRR tracks. Heading through rural farmland once again, LA 138 intersects LA 3079 (Charles Dickerson Lane), a short connector to LA 593\\\\. later, LA 138 intersects LA 3051 (Grabault Road), another connection to Bastrop. Continuing northeast, LA 138 passes by a local school, followed by a succession of industrial plants just outside Mer Rouge. LA 138 enters Mer Rouge on South 14th Street, still running alongside the UPRR tracks. The route proceeds for before ending at an intersection with Davenport Avenue, the village's main street, which is part of US 165, US 425, and LA 2\\\\. From this intersection, the three highways proceed west concurrently into Bastrop and split toward Bonita (US 165 north), Oak Ridge (US 425 south), and Oak Grove (LA 2 east). The route is classified as a rural major collector by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (La DOTD). The posted speed limit is generally between points, reduced to through Collinston and through Mer Rouge. Average daily traffic volume in 2013 ranges between 770 and 940 vehicles from the southern terminus through Collinston. The segment between Collinston and Mer Rouge has a high count of 4,300 vehicles, falling off to 1,480 through Mer Rouge to the northern terminus. LA 138 is an undivided two-lane highway for its entire length. History =Pre-1955 route numbering= In the original Louisiana Highway system in use between 1921 and 1955, the modern LA 138 was originally part of two separate state highways, State Route 47 and State Route C-1557. Southern section State Route 47 followed the route from the southern terminus to the current junction with LA 593 in Collinston, where it turned northwest into Bastrop. Route 47 was designated by an act of the state legislature in 1921, but it was originally projected to follow a direct path from Oak Ridge to Collinston along the former Missouri Pacific Railroad line. Once the road was actually constructed around 1935, its location had been changed to head west from Oak Ridge along the current route of LA 134 for , then north along LA 138 into Collinston. The route then remained the same until the 1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering. Northern section In the original Louisiana Highway system, the northern section of LA 138 from Collinston to Mer Rouge was designated as State Route C-1557. This route was a pre-existing highway that was added to the system around 1940, and it remained the same until the 1955 renumbering. =Post-1955 route history= LA 138 was created in the 1955 renumbering following the portion of former State Route 47 from a point west of Oak Ridge through Collinston, as well as the entirety of former State Route C-1557. The route of LA 138 has remained the same to the present day. However, the northern terminus was originally a junction with US 165 and LA 2 only. In 2005, US 425 was extended south over existing highways from Bastrop to Natchez, Mississippi. US 425 now runs concurrent with US 165 and LA 2 eastward into Mer Rouge, intersecting LA 138 immediately before turning south over the route of LA 133 toward Oak Ridge.

It runs in an east‚Äìwest direction from U.S. Highway 425 (US 425) in Log Cabin to a junction with U.S. Highway 165 (US 165) and LA 599 in Bonita. The route provides the most direct connection between Bastrop, the parish seat, and northbound US 165, which heads north from Bonita toward the Arkansas state line. US 165 takes a more indirect routing, heading eastward out of Bastrop before turning north at Mer Rouge. Providing both a north‚Äìsouth and an east‚Äìwest function, the signage for LA 140 does not carry directional banners. The route is known locally as Old Bonita Road. Route description From the west, LA 140 begins at an intersection with US 425 in a rural area known as Log Cabin, northeast of Bastrop. It proceeds northeast along Old Bonita Road, and the area gradually becomes sparsely populated over the next several miles. After making a brief curve to the north, LA 140 intersects LA 591 (Old Berlin Highway) at a point known as Twin Oaks. LA 591 heads north along Bayou Bartholomew toward the Arkansas state line. Soon after resuming its northeastern course, the surroundings abruptly change from thick forest to open farmland. LA 140 curves due east briefly and intersects LA 599 (Sisson Highway), which makes a long semi-circle before meeting LA 140 again at its final destination of Bonita. LA 140 then curves back to the northeast and later, it intersects LA 833 (Jones Cutoff Road). LA 140 turns due east while LA 833 heads northeast to US 165 at Jones, bypassing Bonita. LA 140 then curves southeast into the small village of Bonita. At Railroad Street, the highway makes a sharp turn to the south to cross the Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR) tracks at grade. LA 140 ends shortly afterward at US 165 (Bonita Avenue) opposite a second intersection with LA 599 (Rosenwald Road). US 165 heads northeast toward the Arkansas state line and the city of Wilmot, Arkansas. LA 140 is classified as a rural major collector by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (La DOTD). Average daily traffic volume in 2013 is reported as 3,800 vehicles between the western terminus and Twin Oaks, decreasing to 810 to the junction with LA 833, and again to 260 from there to the eastern terminus. LA 140 is an undivided two-lane highway for its entire length with a posted speed limit of . History =Pre-1955 route numbering= In the original Louisiana Highway system in use between 1921 and 1955, the modern LA 140 was part of three consecutively numbered routes: State Route C-1484, State Route C-1485, and State Route C-1486. All three were designated during the early 1930s by the state highway department. Route C-1484 followed the current route of LA 140 from the western terminus at Log Cabin to the present junction with LA 591, where it turned northward and headed to the Arkansas state line. Route C-1485 picked up the route to the present junction with LA 833, where it continued ahead to the northeast toward Jones. The remainder of the modern LA 140 from LA 833 to US 165 at Bonita was originally designated as State Route C-1486. Like the previous two routes, it was created in the early 1930s by the state highway department. (State highways in the pre-1955 system ceased to be designated by acts of the state legislature after 1930 and began to carry a \\"C-\\" prefix.) All three routes remained the same up to the 1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering. =Post-1955 route history= LA 140 was created in the 1955 renumbering from the above described parts of former State Routes C-1484 and C-1485 as well as the entirety of former State Route C-1486. The route has remained the same to the present day. However, the western terminus at Log Cabin was originally a junction with LA 139. US 425 was established in 1989 following the existing route of LA 139 from the Arkansas state line south to Bastrop. The designation of LA 139 was then replaced by US 425, which became the new western terminus of LA 140. In addition, LA 140 has been slightly realigned at its western terminus to intersect US 425 at a right-angle. This was done in conjunction with a project completed in April 2012 that widened US 425 to four lanes north of Bastrop.

It exists in two disconnected sections totaling along Point Clair Road within the city of St. Gabriel. The route travels through a sparsely populated area along the east bank levee of the Mississippi River opposite the town of White Castle. It is located on either side of a sharp bend in the river known as Point Clair, which is bypassed by LA 75\\\\. The southern portion of LA 141 serves the Gillis W. Long Center operated by the Louisiana Army National Guard. Historically the facility served as the Carville National Leprosarium and today contains the National Hansen's Disease Museum.

Route description Route marker indicating the upcoming end of LA 141 From the south, LA 141 begins at an intersection with LA 75 in an area within St. Gabriel known as Carville. From this intersection, LA 75 turns north from Point Clair Road onto Martin Luther King Parkway while LA 141 continues straight ahead in a southwest direction along the Mississippi River levee. After passing in front of the Gillis W. Long Center, state maintenance ends, and a private gravel road continues around the bend in the river known as Point Clair. later, state maintenance picks up again at the end of the gravel road. LA 141 proceeds northeast along the river to a second intersection with LA 75, which cuts across the Point Clair bend. =Route classification and data= The route is classified by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (La DOTD) as a rural local road, except for the portion that connected LA 75 with the White Castle Ferry, which is designated as a rural minor collector. Its average daily traffic volume in 2013 has been reported as follows: 1,590 from the overall southern terminus to the entrance of the Gillis W. Long Center; and 1,210 to the overall northern terminus. LA 141 is an undivided two-lane highway for its entire length and has a posted speed limit of between the former ferry landing and the end of state maintenance. The southern portion of LA 141 is a small part of the ten- state Great River Road, which is designated as a National Scenic Byway. History =Pre-1955 route numbering= In the original Louisiana Highway system in use between 1921 and 1955, the modern LA 141 corridor was designated as State Route 410. Route 410 was created in 1928 by an act of the state legislature. It originally existed as a loop off of Route 63, traversing the sharp bend in the Mississippi River occupied by the former leper colony. Route 63, like the modern LA 75, cut across the bend between Carville and St. Gabriel. The route remained largely the same prior to the 1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering, experiencing only minor alterations due to reconstruction of the river levee. =Post-1955 route history= LA 141 was created in 1955 as a direct renumbering of State Route 410. At this time, the route was still continuous, looping off of what was then LA 30. In the mid-1960s, LA 30 was moved onto a new alignment set back from the river between Baton Rouge and St. Gabriel. LA 75 was extended over the former alignment, replacing LA 30 as both the northern and southern terminus of LA 141. In recent years, the community of St. Gabriel was incorporated, and the entire route of LA 141 is now within the city limits. The middle section of the route containing a gravel surface was removed from the state highway system by the 1990s and today runs through private property. Future La DOTD is currently engaged in a program that aims to transfer about of state-owned roadways to local governments over the next several years. Under this plan of \\"right-sizing\\" the state highway system, the northern segment of LA 141 is proposed for deletion as it does not meet a significant interurban travel function.

At the start of the 19th century, the Foreign Secretary would have had one or two private secretaries, who were often personal appointments of the office-holder. As the complexity of British foreign policy grew significantly, and consequently the size of the private office expanded to provide policy and administrative support; the chief civil servant in the private office became the Principal Private Secretary. Today, he or she is the head of a small department, and the post is a senior and prestigious one, now typically held for a two-year term by an experienced officer from the Diplomatic Service. The post is Director grade equivalent in the Civil Service (SCS2), and also equivalent to a Rear Admiral in the Royal Navy and Major General in the British Army. Holders of the post often go on to hold some of the most senior ambassador posts overseas, and also often honoured with a knighthood. This list below shows holders' names as they were at the time of holding the post; details of their later careers and honours can be found in individual articles. In addition, the list includes holders of the posts of Private Secretary to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and then Principal Private Secretary to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (1822-1968).

It is part of the permanent collection at the Indianapolis Museum of Art, and is currently on view in the Paine Early American Painting Gallery. Description Painted along Grand Manan Island, a favorite vacation spot of the artist in New Brunswick, Canada, Bricher painted the sunrise coming above the Atlantic Ocean in a tiny inlet on the coast. Four sailing ships are clearly visible against the pink sky. On the left of the canvas, a sharp, rocky cliff face is seen, breaking up the composition. Bricher clearly depicts each wave rolling onto the beach in minute detail. The Sun is positioned a little left of center of the canvas, but is the major focal point, drawing the eye in. Just like other Hudson River School painters, Bricher hides his brushstrokes, as if to make the canvas disappear. Historical Information Alfred Thompson Bricher was part of the American Luminist movement, coming out of the Hudson River School. Much like the Impressionists, they were interested in the play of light in landscapes, with Bricher himself being particularly interested in how light played against the ocean. Bricher, in particular, became famous for his seascapes and depicting the North Atlantic seaboard. Bricher is considered the last important luminist painter. Morning at Grand Manan came at the height of his career, and displayed Bricher's acquisition of European aesthetics into his own paintings. =Acquisition= Bricher sold Morning at Grand Manan to the Vose Gallery in Boston in 1898. The Indianapolis Museum of Art purchased the painting in 1970 using the Martha Delzell Memorial Fund.

It is a large, clump-forming evergreen bamboo, closely resembling Fargesia nitida in the same genus, but with yellow canes. Description Considered one of the most beautiful bamboos in cultivation, Fargesia murielae is native to the mountains of central China, introduced by Ernest Henry Wilson in 1913 and named after his daughter. Its common name \\"umbrella bamboo\\" describes the graceful weeping habit of this plant. It grows at elevations of . It usually grows up to , with a diameter of about 0.5 inch, and is hardy to . Its USDA plant hardiness zone is 5 through 9 which is not desirable in climates with high heat and humidity such as southeastern states. The leaves are longer than they are wide, have pointed ends, and are arranged singly along the leaf stem. It quickly forms a dense clump of closely spaced canes that are hard to see under a mass of foliage. The new shoots are light blue with tan culm sheaths, aging to a yellowish-green. Its growth and appearance is facilitated in an environment that receives afternoon shade and sunlight throughout the day. Like all other fargesias, it does not have running rhizomes and needs no containment to prevent spread. It will maintain its green-pigmented foliage throughout the winter, though it will most likely shed a few leaves in late fall. Habitat Fargesia murielae has been known to grow in regions of various climates that range from dry mountainsides to jungles, but in general prefers moderately fertile soil which is moist but well-drained and well aerated. It also favors a slightly acidic environment where it is best fit. This species is most common in southeast Asia, China, and Japan. Bamboo in the Orient is harvested for food, paper and timber. In Europe and the United States, it is grown as an ornamental. Growth types There are two basic types of bamboo; clumping (non-invasive) and running. Individual bamboo canes are called culms or stems. The clump type, in which category Fargesia murielae falls, grows in large clumps and is relatively slow in spreading. The root system of a single clump can be rather extensive and quite competitive with surrounding plants. Running types of bamboo, however, are very invasive and very competitive with other plants. They can take over large areas, some varieties spreading more than 100 feet from the mother plant in an incredibly short amount of time. Unlike the running types, the clump types are not very invasive allowing them for a place in the home landscape. Because they are non-invasive, fargesias can be used as specimens, screening, or the low dwarf types as ground-cover. They are specially attractive when planted next to a pond or a stream. Flowering One of the most interesting features of Fargesia murielae is its monocarpic life cycle. This refers to a cycle of life in which it flowers once in its life and then dies. People are used to seeing other plants germinate, grow, and die in a single season, but the idea of a plant dying after 80 to 100 years following its flowering seemed inevitably strange. The flowering cycle of Fargesia murielae, though not the longest on record, is among the most widely known and well documented. Even more astonishing than its long flowering cycle is the synchronous flowering behavior. This term refers to the tendency of most or all of the individuals of a given species to come into flower at more or less the same time. This unusual behavior has led some authors to assume that the flowering event in these bamboos is controlled not by climatic factors but by some sort of internal clock. History in the West 1892: The French missionary P. Farges collects a herbarium specimen of an unknown flowering bamboo in Sichuan Province, China. In 1893, the French taxonomist A. Franchet assigns it to a new genus, Fargesia, with the specific name spathacea. 17 May 1907: On his first expedition to China for the Arnold Arboretum, E. H. Wilson collects plants and three sterile herbarium specimens of an unknown bamboo at Fang Xian, Hubei. [1910]: Wilson makes note of a single plant from his collection growing in the \\"greenhouses and frames\\" area of the Arnold Arboretum. 10 June 1910: On his second Arboretum expedition to China, Wilson revisits Fang Xian. 12 December 1913: One plant of Wilson's is received by Kew Gardens from the Arnold Arboretum. The plant is divided into six pieces that are planted out in the bamboo area. 1916: Wilson labels this Arundinaria sp. in volume II of Plantae Wilsonianae, but lists the wrong collection date. 1920: This collection is given the name Arundinaria murielae by J. S. Gamble. 1935: T. Nakai of Japan reclassifies Arundinaria murielae as Sinarundinaria murielae. 23 December 1959: U.S. National Arboretum botanist F. Meyer arranges for the importation of plants of Sinarundinaria murielae from the Royal Moerheim Nurseries, Dedemsvaart, Holland. The plants are probably divisions of Wilson's collection. One of them is received by the Arnold Arboretum on 8 November 1960. 1975: Plants of Sinarundinaria murielae in Denmark, possibly divisions of Wilson's collection, come into flower. 1979: Based on the flowering specimens of the Danish plants, T. Soderstrom proposes the name Thamnocalamus spathaceus, for the umbrella bamboo. Based on the same specimens, other botanists argue that the species should be classified as either Fargesia murielae (Gamble) or F. spathacea (Franchet). 1988: At Kew Gardens, the original plants of Wilson's collection come into flower for the first time. 1993: In the UK Fargesia murielae is granted the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. 1995: C. Stapleton makes the case for preserving the name Fargesia murielae, but proposes correcting the spelling of the specific to murielae. May 1998: Arnold Arboretum plants of Fargesia murielae, received from the U.S. National Arboretum in 1960, come into flower for the first time.

Scope  There is not an agreed- upon definition for product cost management or an agreed scope for what it encompasses. Some people argue that PCM is a synonym for target costing.Target Costing: The next Frontier in Strategic Cost Management, Ansari, S., Bell, J, and CAM-I, CAM-I Publishing, 1997 However, others argue that PCM is different, because target costing is a pricing method, whereas, PCM is focused on the maximum profit or minimum cost of a product, regardless of the price at which the product is sold to the end customer.Cost-Efficient Design, Ehrlenspiel, K., Kiewert, A., Lindemann, U., Hundal, Mahendra, H. ed., Springer 2007 Some analysts seem to equate PCM to design-to-cost. Some practitioners of PCM are mostly concerned with the cost of the product up until the point that the customer takes delivery (e.g. manufacturing costs + logistics costs) or the total cost of acquisition. They seek to launch products that meet profit targets at launch rather than reducing the costs of a product after production. Other people believe that PCM extends to a total cost of ownership or lifecycle costing (Manufacturing + Logistics + operational costs + disposal). Depending on the practitioner, PCM may include any combination of organizational or /cultural change, processes, team roles, and tools. Many believe that PCM must encompass all four aspects to be successful and have shown how the four parts work together. Processes and activities Depending on the scope the practitioner assigns to PCM, it may include one or more of the following processes. * Change management and building a cost/profit- conscious culture. * Building cost management into the Product Lifecycle Management processes * DFM ‚Äì Design for Manufacturing * DFA ‚Äì Design for assembly * DTC ‚Äì Design to Cost * DFP ‚Äì Design for Procurement * VA/VE ‚Äì Value Analysis / Value engineering * DFSS ‚Äì Design for Six Sigma * Cost targeting * Should Cost / Price * Make Buy * Capital asset justification * Commodity Pricing * Spend analysis Tools Initially, PCM was done with pencil and paper. However, with the advent of computers, companies started to create internal software for predicting, controlling, minimizing, recording, and sharing product costs. With the invention of spreadsheets, PCM tools got a major boost in ease of use and adoption. In the late 1970s, specialized third- party software was developed that could do some of the activities included in PCM. Today, there are several tools that directly or indirectly promote themselves as ‚ÄúProduct Cost Management‚Äù software solutions. Some of these tools also state that they can help users with problems of target costing, as well. However, despite the creation of third-party tools, spreadsheets, specifically Microsoft Excel may still be, overwhelmingly, the most popular tool for PCM practitioners.  Is PCM a software category?  In the mid-2000s, there was some discussion of whether PCM (sometimes referred to as Enterprise Cost Management) would become a separate software category or be part of one or more of the existing enterprise software categories of enterprise resource planning (ERP), product lifecycle management (PLM), or supply chain management (SCM). The vendors who make specialized PCM software have not yet gained the revenue necessary for the major industry analysts to proclaim PCM as its own category. However, there has been at least one analyst report focusing on product cost analytics. It is unknown whether PCM will become part of a bigger enterprise software category. At least one of the major ERP vendors and two of the major PLM vendors have products that they bill as Product Cost Management or analytics solutions.  Purposes  The strategic purpose of PCM has been to maximize the profit of products through making a product the most cost efficient. Tactically, this has been accomplished by using the various PCM techniques and tools discussed above in a predictive way. That is, the tools are used to estimate a cost that is used as an absolute value for what a cost should be, or to relatively evaluate the cost of one design or manufacturing process or supplier versus another. In 2012, some experts in the PCM field have advocated that the purpose of PCM is not only to predict the most accurate cost, but also as a tool for leverage in negotiation.

Nevertheless, Boyi and Shuqi indirectly swore loyalty to the dynasty after they fled their land of birth. Boyi or Bo Yi () and his brother Shuqi or Shu Qi () were two brothers who lived in China at the time of the transition between the Shang dynasty and the Zhou dynasty (either side of about 1046 BCE). They are still remembered in Chinese literary culture for their personal and moral virtue, loyalty, and pacifist idealism.Wu, K. C., 249 Sometimes they are referred to together just as \\"Boyi\\", after the elder brother.For example, see Mencius, Gong Sun Chou I (Â≠üÂ≠ê„ÄäÂÖ¨Â≠´‰∏ë‰∏ä„Äã) They were natives of the state of Guzhu (in modern Hebei province, around the area of Tangshan), a vassal state of the Shang dynasty. Boyi and Shuqi represent some paradoxes in ethics: Boyi refused to take over rule of his father's kingdom because he felt his father really preferred his younger brother and going against his father's wishes would not be in accord with filial piety to go against his father. Shuqi refused the rule because it would be unfilial to allow his older brother to be bypassed. So the two fled together. Then, after the overthrow of the Shang dynasty to which they had then pledged loyalty (and which theoretically owned the land and its produce by divine right), the two brothers faced the dilemma of disloyally eating the food of the new (in their opinion, usurping) dynasty or remaining loyal in spirit to the former dynasty, and so the two were left only with starvation. Background Depiction of King Wen of Zhou, originally a vassal of the Shang dynasty to whose territory Boyi and Shuqi fled after hearing reports of his able governance Boyi and Shuqi lived during the reign of the last Shang ruler Di Xin, who at this point had become given over to drinking, women, sex, and a disdain for morals. His country was misruled, with high taxes, mass hunger, and arbitrary acts of violence and cruelty. Sima Qian provides lurid details of prolonged orgies of drunken sex and acts of violence and torture, during which he refused to heed the advice of his ministers. At the same time the leader of the Zhou clan, posthumously known as King Wen of Zhou, was preparing to replace the Shang dynasty with the rule of his own clan (the subsequent Zhou dynasty), though at the time they were a vassal state to Shang. In contrast to Shang, the leadership of Zhou was famous for its provision of food and protection for its subjects, in part due to their advances in agricultural techniques. Biography Map of the location of the Battle of Muye, where the rising Zhou dynasty defeated the incumbent Shang dynasty Fiddlehead ferns, said to be Boyi and Shuqi's diet in exile, shown newly picked and washed. They are generally considered to be toxic before cooking. Fiddlehead ferns, prepared dish. Boyi and Shuqi, together with a third brother Y√† P√≠ng (‰∫ûÊÜë/‰∫öÂá≠), were the sons of Ya Wei (‰∫ûÂæÆ/‰∫öÂæÆ), the Ruling Lord of the Guzhu State, also sometimes referred to in English language sources as Lonely Bamboo (kingdom). Traditionally, the succession to the rulership would have gone to the elder son, namely Boyi; but, when Shuqi was preferred to succeed him as ruler, rather than engaging in conflict or disharmonious relationships, together they fled to the Zhou territory; which, at the time was actively encouraging immigration, particularly of skilled and talented persons. The moral sensitivities of Boyi and Shuqi were such that they would not abide by the violence and horror then rampant in the directly ruled part of Shang territory due to the misrule of emperor Di Xin. At first, the two brothers were welcomed by the Zhou, who held a vassal kingdom to the West of the main Shang territory. However, the ruler of the Zhou, Wen, died and his son Ji Fa, later known as king Wu, upon succeeding him as ruler, immediately proceeded to marshal his forces and lead them to conquer Shang: the brothers attempted to change the course of history by pulling on the chariot reins of the ruler, Ji Fa (Wu), remonstrating with him for his lack of filial piety, both because rather than sufficiently mourning his recently deceased father he was going off to war and also that he was betraying his sacred allegiance to his sovereign lord, Di Xin, the ruler of the Shang. Wu's outraged guards would have killed the brothers, except for the intervention of general Jiang Taigong, who recognized the sincerity of their moral convictions. But, when instead of heeding their protests, the army continued on its way to eventual victory over the Shang, in the extremely violent slaughter known as the Battle of Muye. Boyi and Shuqi made their protest widely known through their refusal to eat the produce of Zhou, (the traditional and very culturally significant \\"Five Grains\\"), saying, \\"King Wu, as a minister who assassinated his king, is an disloyal and unrighteous man. We cannot work as ministers for an emperor lacking in loyalty, righteousness, and virtue. We are ashamed to accepted an emolument from him.\\"Yeh Chia-ying, translation Josey Shun and Bhikshuni Heng Yin, \\"Lectures on Tao Yuanming's Poems\\", a series of lectures at Gold Buddha Monastery, Canada (lecture tapes were transcribed by Tu Xiaoli, An Yi, and Yang Aidi) <\\"Vajra Bhodi Sea\\" No.366, November 2000>.

C., 283-282 and (note 15) 319 and lived on fiddlehead ferns,Ëñá, Wu, K. C., 319, note 16, which he identifies as Osmunda regalis var. japonica (=Osmunda japonica) until they were reminded that these plants too now belonged to Zhou, at which point they starved themselves to death. According to a version, which appears in the Heavenly Questions, the brothers were eventually warned not to eat the ferns by a maiden (or other unidentified woman), after which a white deer miraculously appeared, suckling them, nurturing them with her milk, and thus preventing immediate starvation; however, all known versions of the story end with the demise of Boyi and Shuqi, by starvation.Hawkes, 150 Posthumous elevation During the Song dynasty, in 1102, Boyi and Shuqi were both posthumously awarded the rank of marquis. Legacy Boyi and Shuqi have had a long legacy both in philosophy and literature and in art and poetry. =Philosophy and literature= Boyi and Shuqi's life and their choices in life became a mainstay of Chinese philosophy and literature. Why did they make the choices that they did, giving up chances for fortune, power, and riches? In the end, would they have regretted their choices, or done the same? If Heaven rewards good and punishes evil, why did Boyi and Shuqi starve, while various wicked evil doers seem to thrive? Confucius Confucius, the famous philosopher, was asked: \\"Didn't Boyi and Shuqi feel wronged for starving to death in the western mountains?\\" Confucius answered, \\"They pursued the perfection of humaneness, and they achieved it. Why should they feel wronged?\\"Yeh Chia-ying, translation Josey Shun and Bhikshuni Heng Yin, \\"Lectures on Tao Yuanming's Poems\\", a series of lectures at Gold Buddha Monastery, Canada (lecture tapes were transcribed by Tu Xiaoli, An Yi, and Yang Aidi) <\\"Vajra Bhodi Sea\\" No.368, January 2001> Sima Qian Sima Qian, the famous historian, included various biographical sketches in his Records of the Grand Historian, including the \\"A Biographical Sketch of Boyi\\". In this, he incorporates discussion of morality and Heaven from the perspective of Lao Zi. Sima addresses the question of whether there are consequences for choosing good or evil, by comparing Boyi with the robber Zhi (Áõú), who was said to have lived to a ripe old age feeding on human flesh, among other heinous deeds.Yeh Chia-ying, translation Josey Shun and Bhikshuni Heng Yin, \\"Lectures on Tao Yuanming's Poems\\", a series of lectures at Gold Buddha Monastery, Canada (lecture tapes were transcribed by Tu Xiaoli, An Yi, and Yang Aidi) <\\"Vajra Bhodi Sea\\" No.367, December 2000> =Art and poetry= Boyi and Shuqi have been used as artistic references in painting, poetry, and literature, including a surviving painting by Li Tang and references in poems by Du Fu, and others.

He fought in the Parliamentary army in the English Civil War. Life Cooper was the second son of Sir John Cooper, 1st Baronet of Rockbourne, Hampshire and was baptised on 15 December 1626. Throughout his life he was overshadowed by his brother Anthony Ashley Cooper. He was a student at Exeter College, Oxford in 1642. He joined the parliamentary army and was a captain by 1644 and major by 1646. He was commissioner for militia for Tower Hamlets from 1648 to 1649 and a J.P. for Middlesex from 1648 to July 1660. By 1649 he was also J.P. for Dorset.. From 1649 to February 1660 he was trustee for maintenance of ministers. In 1650 he was a member of the high court of justice. He was commissioner for assessment for Middlesex in 1650 and 1652 and became J.P. for Wiltshire instead of Dorset in 1653.History of Parliament Online - Cooper, George In 1654, Cooper was elected Member of Parliament for Poole in the First Protectorate Parliament.Other sources assign his brother to the seat Also in 1654, he was a member of the high court of justice and commissioner for scandalous ministers for Wiltshire.

He was commissioner for assessment for Middlesex and Wiltshire in January 1660, commissioner of Admiralty from February to July 1660 and commissioner for militia for Middlesex and Wiltshire in March 1660. In April 1660 he became freeman of Poole and was elected MP for Poole in the Convention Parliament. His main interest concerned the crown lands in Clarendon Park, which he had bought for ¬£3,000 and hoped to retain with support from the Presbyterian peers. However his petition was unsuccessful and the park was granted to the George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle in 1665. He continued living nearby at Farley. In 1666 Cooper obtained the post of treasurer of prizes at Dover 1666. He was commissioner of revenue arrears in 1671.

It returned one Member of Parliament to the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, elected by the first past the post voting system. Vacancy and electoral history The local Liberal MP Henry Wilson resigned from parliament at the age of 79. He had been MP here since the seat was created in 1885. At the last General Election, he was returned unopposed. The last contested election was the previous election; Candidates The Liberal candidate selected was 34-year-old Sydney Arnold. He had contested neighbouring Holderness for the Liberals at the last election. He had been educated at Manchester Grammar School and had been a Member of Manchester Stock Exchange since 1904. The Unionists re-selected 38-year-old Geoffrey Ellis from Shipley, West Yorkshire. Ellis was educated at Peterhouse, Cambridge. Since 1910 he worked for Beckett & Co., Bankers, of Leeds. Although he did not contest the December 1910 general election, he contested the previous General Election in January 1910. The Labour Party selected 40-year-old William Lunn. He was educated at Rothwell Board School. He was a check-weighman who had started work in the pit at 12 years of age.Who's Who Campaign Polling Day was set for 20 June 1912, just 15 days after the resignation of the previous MP. The constituency contained a mixture of mining, agriculture and textile industries. Arnold was a committed supporter of a Land value tax which he featured in his campaign. David Lloyd George the Liberal Chancellor of the Exchequer sent Arnold a public message in which he said Britain needed to \\"recast our present absurd land system.\\" Lunn was importantly backed by the Yorkshire Miners' Association which not only assured him of organised support but went some way to ensuring that much of the third of the electorate involved in mining, would support him at the ballot box.By-Elections in British Politics, 1832-1914 Result Sydney Arnold The percentage change in vote share is calculated from the last contested election in January 1910. Aftermath A general election was due to take place by the end of 1915. By the autumn of 1914, the following candidates had been adopted to contest that election. Due to the outbreak of war, the election never took place. Arnold was elected for the re-drawn seat of Penistone in 1918. Ellis was elected for the seat of Wakefield in 1922. Lunn went on to be elected for Rothwell in 1918. *Smith was the endorsed candidate of the Coalition Government.

Usually, this rule is applied repeatedly over the network. It is done by updating the weights and bias levels of a network when a network is simulated in a specific data environment. A learning rule may accept existing conditions (weights and biases) of the network and will compare the expected result and actual result of the network to give new and improved values for weights and bias. Depending on the complexity of actual model being simulated, the learning rule of the network can be as simple as an XOR gate or mean squared error, or as complex as the result of a system of differential equations. The learning rule is one of the factors which decides how fast or how accurately the artificial network can be developed. Depending upon the process to develop the network there are three main models of machine learning: # Unsupervised learning # Supervised learning # Reinforcement learning  Background  A lot of the learning methods in machine learning work similar to each other, and are based on each other which makes it difficult to classify them in clear categories. But they can be broadly understood in 4 categories of learning methods, though these categories don't have clear boundaries and they tend to belong to multiple categories of learning methods \\\\- #Hebbian - Neocognitron, Brain-state-in-a-box #Gradient Descent - ADALINE, Hopfield Network, Recurrent Neural Network #Competitive - Learning Vector Quantisation, Self-Organising Feature Map, Adaptive Resonance Theory #Stochastic - Boltzmann Machine, Cauchy Machine It is to be noted that though these learning rules might appear to be based on similar ideas, they do have subtle differences, as they are a generalisation or application over the previous rule, and hence it makes sense to study them separately based on their origins and intents. = Hebbian Learning = Developed by Donal Hebb in 1949 to describe biological neuron firing. It defines Hebbian Learning with respect to Biological Neurons, which was in the min-1950s also applied to computer simulations of neural networks in Artificial Neural Networks. \\\\Delta w_i = \\\\eta x_i yx It has been shown that Hebb's rule in its basic form is unstable. Oja's Rule, BCM Theory are other learning rules built on top of or alongside of the Hebb's Rule in the study of biological neurons.  Perceptron Learning Rule (PLR)  The perceptron learning rule originates from the Hebbian assumption, and was used by Frank Rosenblatt in his perceptron in 1958. The net is passed to the activation (transfer) function and the function's output is used for adjusting the weights. The learning signal is the difference between the desired response and the actual response of a neuron. The step function is often used as an activation function, and the outputs are generally restricted to -1, 0, or 1. The weights are updated with w_\\\\text{new} = w_\\\\text{old} + \\\\eta (t-o) x_i where \\"t\\" is the target value and \\"o\\" is the output of the perceptron, and \\\\eta is called the learning rate. The algorithm converges to the correct classification if: * the training data is linearly separable* * \\\\eta Ùè±ºis sufficiently small (though smaller \\\\eta generally means a longer learning time and more epochs) *It should also be noted that a single layer perceptron with this learning rule is incapable of working on linearly non-separable inputs, and hence the XOR problem cannot be solved using this rule alone = Backpropagation = Seppo Linnainmaa in 1970 is said to have developed the Backpropagation Algorithm but the origins of the algorithm go back to the 1960s with many contributors. It is a generalisation of the least mean squares algorithm in the linear perceptron and the Delta Learning Rule. It implements gradient descent search through the space possible network weights, iteratively reducing the error, between the target values and the network outputs.  Widrow-Hoff Learning (Delta Learning Rule)  Similar to the perceptron learning rule but with different origin. It was developed for use in the ADALAINE network, which differs from the Perceptron mainly in terms of the training. The weights are adjusted according to the weighted sum of the inputs (the net), whereas in perceptron the sign of the weighted sum was useful for determining the output as the threshold was set to 0, -1, or +1. This makes it ADALINE different from the normal perceptron. Delta rule (DR) is similar to the Perceptron Learning Rule (PLR), with some differences: # Error (Œ¥) in DR is not restricted to having values of 0, 1, or -1 (as in PLR), but may have any value # DR can be derived for any differentiable output/activation function f, whereas in PLR only works for threshold output function Sometimes only when the Widrow-Hoff is applied to binary targets specifically, it is referred to as Delta Rule, but the terms seem to be used often interchangeably. The delta rule is considered to a special case of the back-propagation algorithm. Delta rule also closely resembles the Rescorla-Wagner model under which Pavlovian conditioning occurs. = Competitive Learning = Competitive learning is considered a variant of Hebbian learning, but it is special enough to be discussed separately. Competitive learning works by increasing the specialization of each node in the network. It is well suited to finding clusters within data. Models and algorithms based on the principle of competitive learning include vector quantization and self-organizing maps (Kohonen maps).

The executions took place at a number of locations in Syria, Lebanon and Libya. The number of people executedmostly Palestiniansis estimated at 600.  Background  The Abu Nidal Organization was established by Sabri Khalil al-Bannah (Abu Nidal), a Palestinian Arab nationalist and a former Ba'ath party member. Al-Bannah established his faction within the PLO, just prior the Black September in Jordan, and following internal disagreements within the PLO. During Fatah's Third Congress in Damascus in 1971, he emerged as the leader of a leftist alliance against Arafat. Abu Nidal's first independent operation took place on September 5, 1973, when five gunmen using the name Al-Iqab (\\"The Punishment\\") seized the Saudi embassy in Paris, taking 11 hostages and threatening to blow up the building if Abu Dawud was not released from jail in Jordan, where he had been arrested in February 1973 for an attempt on King Hussein's life.Melman 1986, p. 69. Following the incident, Mahmud Abbas of the PLO took flight to Iraq to meet Abu Nidal. In the meeting Abbas became so angry, that he stormed out of the meeting, followed by the other PLO delegates, and from that point on, the PLO regarded Abu Nidal as a mercenary.Seale 1992, p. 92. Two months later, just after the October 1973 Yom Kippur War, during discussions about convening a peace conference in Geneva, the Abu Nidal Organization (ANO) hijacked a KLM airliner, using the name of the Arab Nationalist Youth Organization. The operation was intended to send a signal to Fatah not to send representatives to any peace conference. In response, Arafat officially expelled Abu Nidal from Fatah in March 1974, and the rift between the two groups, and the two men, was complete.Melman 1986, p. 70. Abu Nidal's organization was engaged in a series of international terrorist incidents aimed at Israel and Western countries. Setting himself up as a freelance contractor, Abu Nidal is believed by the United States Department of State to have ordered attacks in 20 countries, killing or injuring over 900 people.\\"Abu Nidal Organization\\" , Country Reports on Terrorism, 2004. United States Department of State, 2005. The ANO group's most notorious attacks were on the El Al ticket counters at Rome and Vienna airports in December 1985, when Arab gunmen high on amphetamines opened fire on passengers in simultaneous shootings, killing 18 and wounding 120. Patrick Seale, Abu Nidal's biographer, wrote of the attacks that their \\"random cruelty marked them as typical Abu Nidal operations.\\"Seale 1992, pp. 243‚Äì244.  Executions within the organization  The ANO's official newspaper Filastin al-Thawra regularly carried stories announcing the execution of traitors within the movement.Abu Khalil, 2000. Each new recruit of the ANO was given several days to write his entire life story by handincluding names and addresses of family members, friends, and loversand was then required to sign a paper agreeing to his execution if anything was found to be untrue. Every so often, the recruit would be asked to rewrite the whole story. Any discrepancies were taken as evidence that he was a spy and he would be made to write it out again, often after days of being beaten and nights spent forced to sleep standing up.Seale 1992, pp. 6-7. =1987 events= By 1987, Abu Nidal had turned the full force of his paranoia and terror tactics inwards on the ANO itself. Members were routinely tortured by the \\"Committee for Revolutionary Justice\\" until they confessed to betrayal and disloyalty. Men would be hanged naked for hours and whipped until they lost consciousness, then revived with salt or chili powder rubbed into their wounds. A naked prisoner would be forced into a car tire with his legs and backside in the air, then whipped, wounded, and salted. Plastic melted under a flame would be dripped onto prisoners' skin. According to recruits who were able to escape, prisoners' genitals would be placed in skillets of boiling-hot oil and fried while the men were held down. Between interrogations, prisoners would be confined alone in tiny cells, bound hand and foot. If the cells were full, a prisoner might be buried alive, with a steel pipe in his mouth to allow him to breathe. Water would be poured into it occasionally. When word came that Abu Nidal wanted the prisoner executed, a bullet would be fired down the tube instead, then the pipe removed and the hole filled in.Clarridge 1997, cited in Ledeen 2002. *Also see Seale 1992, pp. 286-287. Perpetrators In one year from 1987‚Äì1988, around 600 were killed, between a third and a half of the membership of the ANO. Abu Nidal even had the elderly wife of a veteran member, Al-Hajj Abu Musa, thrown in jail and killed on a charge of lesbianism. The killings were mostly the work of four men: Mustafa Ibrahim Sanduqa of the Justice Committee; Isam Maraqa, Abu Nidal's deputy, who was married to his wife's niece; Sulaiman Samrin, also known as Dr. Ghassan al-Ali, the ANO's first secretary; and Mustafa Awad, also known as Alaa, the head of the Intelligence Directorate. Most of the decisions to kill, said Abu Dawud, a long-time member of the ANO, were taken by Abu Nidal \\"in the middle of the night, after he [had] knocked back a whole bottle of whiskey\\".Seale 1992, pp. 287-289.

Tilman (born 1971) is an American financier, author, and a leading authority on strategy, risk intelligence, and finance. He currently serves as President and CEO of Tilman & Company, a global strategic advisory firm. Tilman was formerly an executive at BlackRock, Capitol Peak, and Bear Stearns and adjunct professor of finance at Columbia University. Tilman is credited with predicting the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008 by showing the unsustainable nature of global imbalances in his book Financial Darwinism. His latest book Agility: How to Navigate the Unknown and Seize Opportunity in a World of Disruption (2019), co-authored with former NORAD Commander General Charles H. Jacoby Jr., presents a comprehensive theory of agility and a practical roadmap to fostering agility at any organization. The book‚Äôs urgent call for action‚Äîthat leaders must learn how to consistently navigate radical disruption and uncertainty‚Äîforeshadowed the COVID pandemic, global economic recession, and social turmoil of 2020. Tilman is the author of two prior books on risk management and finance and other notable publications. In collaboration with Nobel Laureate Edmund Phelps, he co-authored a 2010 Harvard Business Review proposal to create the First National Bank of Innovation in order to enhance U.S. economic dynamism. In a 2012 European Financial Review article, he redefined risk intelligence and designated it \\"new essential competence\\" for companies and investors who aspire to create lasting value for stakeholders and society. He is the creator of the Corporate Risk Scorecard, a holistic view of a company's business model and risk profile similar to a food Nutrition Label (Barrons) and co-author of the pioneering \\"Brain as a Business Model\\" framework (European Financial Review, 2014). Tilman was one of the main architects of a public/private partnership involving the White House Rural Council , U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the Farm Credit System that brought billions of private capital to innovative companies and projects. Tilman was profiled as a \\"Business Visionary\\" by Forbes among \\"influential authors, decision makers, and thought leaders in the field of business\\" and named Young Global Leader of the World Economic Forum for \\"professional accomplishments, commitment to society and potential to contribute to shaping the future of the world.\\" Education and early career Tilman received B.A. and M.A. in mathematics from Columbia University and executive education at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University and the Jackson Institute for Global Affairs at Yale University. Before founding Capitol Peak and Tilman & Company, Tilman was Chief Institutional Strategist and Senior Managing Director at Bear Stearns. He started his career at BlackRock.

In this important and compelling book, Tilman and Jacoby provide a comprehensive theory of agility and a practical guide to developing and leading agile organizations.\\" ‚Äì Klaus Schwab, Founder & Executive Chairman, World Economic Forum In a world of accelerating disruption and staggering uncertainty, agile organizations that can assess and respond to change in real time gain an aggressive edge over competitors in the market. Agility has become a tenet of business success in the disruptive age‚Äîbut most leaders still don't know what it truly means and are in need of specific guidance on what it takes to build organizations that are consistently agile. Agility is a choice followed by action and hard work. It requires specific experience, understanding, and commitment. It demands engagement across the organization as well as a concerted investment in people and processes. Adopting the agility mindset allows organizations to thrive since it provides a new way of studying environments, making decisions, evaluating threats and opportunities, building cultures and relationships, defining True North (strategic and moral), and decisively executing. First, leaders must fully understand and embrace what agility means. Then they and their subordinates must be trained. It is through that shared understanding, training, and practice that the agility mindset is created. Agility, written by Tilman and General Charles H. Jacoby Jr., presents a call to action for leaders across public and private sectors that agility is urgently needed and that it is achievable for any organization. When organizations make the choice to become agile, adopt the agility mindset, and acquire the requisite knowledge and capabilities‚Äîall while remaining vigilant‚Äîagility becomes their enduring state of being. Agility is far superior, and far more effective than mere speed and adaptability. Organizations that adopt this mindset thrive amidst uncertainty and disruption, and are able to turn today's challenging environment into an advantage‚Äîone that supports their vision. =Financial Darwinism= \\"Financial Darwinism explains the tectonic shifts now underway in the investment world far better than any book I have seen to date,\\" writes David M. Rubenstein, co-Founder of The Carlyle Group. \\"Those who are interested in really understanding how financial markets have dramatically changed in the past few years ‚Äì and how they are likely to change again in the next few years ‚Äì would do well to read and absorb this important work by Leo Tilman.\\" Tilman's Financial Darwinism is based on the premise that today's complex economic and financial landscape requires executives, financial professionals, regulators, policy makers, and investors to adopt a radically new way of thinking and making decisions. Global systemic financial crises, periodic astonishing losses, and ruin of once-venerable institutions serve as convincing evidence on what happens otherwise, necessitating a road map to the new financial order and an essential guide to adapting and succeeding in it. Financial Darwinism analyzes the dominant global forces behind the tectonic financial shift that has taken place in finance of the past quarter century and then comprehensively explores the challenges facing financial institutions as well as the universe of their potential responses. Conceptually, it consists of two highly interrelated parts. The first one is the evolutionary thesis called Dynamic Finance. This thesis explains the origins and drivers of the profound changes in the global financial system. Tilman proposes that the basic key to understanding the behavior of modern financial institutions and capital markets lies in the recognition of the fact that the process of economic value creation in finance has undergone a fundamental transformation. More specifically, due to significant margin pressures on basic financial businesses, active risk taking has begun to play an increasingly dominant role how financial institutions create (and destroy) shareholder value. In order to demonstrate this, the book introduces the concept of risk-based economic performance that helps depart from the outdated accounting-earnings-inspired mental paradigm. Throughout, the dynamism of risk-taking and business decisions is emphasized as a distinguishing characteristic of the dynamic new world vis-√†-vis the old financial regime. Managing modern financial institutions is a task of enormous uncertainty, scope and complexity. Thus, the second part of this book uses this evolutionary perspective to introduce an actionable decision-making framework designed to help financial executives respond the ongoing challenges. Together, the decision-making framework, the evolutionary thesis, and the risk-based economic performance equation filter out the complexity of the financial world and give financial executives a set of tools and choices on how to create or enhance economic value. They help define financial institutions' strategic vision that properly integrates customer-related and risk-taking decisions, thus unifying business strategy, corporate finance, investment analysis, and risk management. Lastly, they help determine an \\"optimal\\" way to implement the strategic vision using the entire arsenal of advanced financial tools. In the process, risk management naturally becomes the very language of strategic decisions. Financial Darwinism which, in essence, is a prelude to risk intelligence, help financial institutions and investors deliver sustainable economic performance amidst complex, uncertain, and constantly evolving business and market environments.

The episode was written by series creator Theresa Rebeck and directed by Michael Morris. It premiered on the NBC network on May 14, 2012. In \\"Bombshell\\", Derek (Jack Davenport) has to choose Rebecca Duvall's (Uma Thurman) replacement in time for the show's opening night. The decision changes both Ivy (Megan Hilty) and Karen's (Katharine McPhee) lives forever. Tom (Christian Borle) and Julia (Debra Messing) hurry to save the show, while Ellis show his true colors to Eileen (Anjelica Huston). Lyle West (Nick Jonas) returns with bad news and \\"Bombshell\\" continues its previews in Boston. Plot Derek (Jack Davenport) makes Karen (Katharine McPhee) the new Marilyn. This means that not only does Karen have to perfect things she's never done before, but costumes have to be refitted to Karen's size. Karen is still green, and everyone but Derek has doubts, which is only worsened when each number has multiple problems. Eileen (Anjelica Huston) tells Derek that Karen cannot do Marilyn, and tries to get Derek to fire her, but Derek refuses and insists Eileen respect his artistic vision. Ivy (Megan Hilty) asks Derek why he chose Karen and not her, and Derek replies it was because he could imagine Karen as Marilyn, and that Karen has something Ivy doesn't. Ellis (Jamie Cepero), in his continuing quest to be producer, tells Eileen that he put the peanuts in Rebecca's smoothie as a favor to the company, and demands Eileen treat him as a producer; Eileen fires him on the spot and kicks him out of the theater. Ellis vows to return. Although promotion materials indicated that Lyle West (Nick Jonas) would return with bad news, he simply returns to give Eileen her painting and see the show. Tom (Christian Borle) and Julia (Debra Messing) struggle to come up with a proper ending; Julia finally draws on inspiration from her relationship struggles with Frank (Brian d'Arcy James) to end the show on a high note while still realistically depicting Monroe's death. Dev (Raza Jaffrey) asks Ivy if she found the engagement ring he left in her room when they slept together, and she lies and says she hasn't. Later, Ivy returns the ring to Karen instead, and when Karen asks what she was doing with the ring in the first place, Ivy responds that Dev is very 'Joe DiMaggio'. Karen confronts Dev about cheating on her with Ivy, and Karen dumps Dev. Karen eventually cracks, pulling off her wig, and Derek finds her curled up in a ball. He tells her to exploit her pain to be a better actress, and she pulls herself together right as Eileen, Tom, and Julia are about to put Ivy in as Marilyn; they concede the point to Derek, breaking Ivy's heart. Karen as Marilyn proves to be an enormous success, getting rapturous applause for her show-stopping finale- before she's even finished singing. The season ends on a cliffhanger, with Ivy planning on committing suicide by overdosing on a whole bottle of sleeping pills.

Crundwell (n√©e Humphrey; born January 10, 1953) is the formerly appointed comptroller and treasurer of Dixon, Illinois from 1983 to 2012, and the admitted operator of what is believed to be the largest municipal fraud in U.S. history. She was fired in April 2012 after the discovery that she had embezzled $53.7 million from the city of Dixon for over twenty-two years to support her championship American Quarter Horse breeding operation. Crundwell pleaded guilty to her crimes and was sentenced to 19 and a half years in prison. Crundwell's Quarter Horse breeding operation, RC Quarter Horses, was one of the best-known in the country; her horses won 52 world championships and she was named the leading owner by the American Quarter Horse Association for eight consecutive years prior to her arrest.  Early life and career  Born Rita Humphrey, the daughter of Ray and Caroline Humphrey, Crundwell grew up on her family's farm near Dixon a smart and popular student. In 1970, a year before graduating from Dixon High School, she began working at the Dixon City Hall as a work-study student. She began showing American Quarter Horses in 1978. She married engineering technician Jerry L. Crundwell in 1974, while working as a secretary for Dixon's mayor, but divorced Crundwell in 1986. In 1983, Crundwell was appointed the treasurer and comptroller for Dixon, working in this capacity for almost three decades. Crundwell acquired a sterling reputation; in 2011, one of the city commissioners praised her stewardship of city finances, saying \\"she looks after every tax dollar as if it were her own.\\" Embezzlement On December 8, 1990, Crundwell opened a secret bank account named the Reserve Sewer Capital Development Account (RSCDA), making it appear to be a city account. She was the only signatory. Crundwell would have money deposited into another account called the Capital Development Fund, create false state invoices, and then write checks from the fund payable to \\"Treasurer,\\" which she would deposit into the RSCDA account. According to federal investigators, this relatively uncomplicated scheme continued for 22 years. On average, Crundwell stole nearly $2.5 million per year from the city. In 1991, she stole $181,000, while in 2008 alone she managed to embezzle $5.8 million from a city with an annual budget of $8‚Äì9 million.Grimm, Andy; Jenco, Melissa (2012-04-08). \\"Small town rocked by $30 million theft case\\". Chicago Tribune Crundwell used the money not only to finance her Quarter Horse operation, but also to support a lifestyle well beyond her $80,000 city salary, purchasing several cars, a second house and a million-dollar motorhome.Guerrero, Lisa. She Lived Like a Queen By Scamming An Entire City. Inside Edition, 2013-02-13. Crundwell covered up her embezzlement by claiming that the city's frequent budget shortfalls were due to the state being late in paying its share of tax revenue.Plea agreement She forced city departments to make drastic service cuts in order to keep the budget within reason. As a result, employees went two years or more without raises and the police department could not afford new radios. The most visible effect, however, was on street maintenance; the city was forced to lay off three of its nine street repair workers and cut the rate of maintenance. In the decade prior to Crundwell's arrest, only 65 blocks of road were repaired or replaced.Appeals court ruling in Crundwell case For most of Crundwell's tenure, residents assumed either that she inherited her wealth and/or that her horse breeding business was profitable in its own right. However, by the onset of the Great Recession, some grew suspicious that Crundwell was stealing money. But the city's outside auditors, Clifton Gunderson (now CliftonLarsonAllen after merging with LarsonAllen in 2012) and local accountant Samuel Card presumed that Crundwell was honest and signed off on her annual financial statements without concern. For small U.S. cities similar to Dixon, lack of sufficient outside audits was a recurring problem, as third-party auditors could give at best limited attention. For most of her tenure as comptroller, Crundwell had nearly complete control over the city's accounts, while few city employees had access to the city's financial statements.  Capture and arrest  In the fall of 2011, while Crundwell was on an extended vacation, city clerk and acting comptroller Kathe Swanson discovered the RSCDA account with 179 deposits and associated checking activity. Not recognizing the account as a legitimate city account, Swanson alerted Dixon mayor James Burke, who in turn contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). For the next six months, Burke and Swanson (whose payroll was controlled by Crundwell) remained silent while the FBI built their case. Crundwell arrived for work on April 17, 2012 to find FBI agents waiting for her. She was arrested later that day and was indicted by a federal grand jury for embezzling $30 million from the city during the previous six years. Crundwell was charged with one count of wire fraud and released on $4,500 bail the next day. On May 2, 2012, a superseding indictment charged Crundwell with embezzling $53 million over the prior 22 years. On November 14, 2012, Crundwell pleaded guilty before Judge Philip Reinhard to a single count of wire fraud. As part of the deal, she also admitted to money laundering by using the embezzled money to finance her horse operation. Crundwell was required to forfeit more than $53.7 million in cash, assets and possessions, equivalent to the amount she stole, which is being used to make full restitution to the city. She reportedly told FBI agents that some of the money was spent on her horses and their upkeep. Prosecutors sought the forfeiture of her horse farm and 300 horses, in addition to her three homes and a luxury motor vehicle. Prosecutors later discovered that Crundwell's crimes had begun as early as 1988, when she siphoned off $25,000 from the Dixon Sister City program over two years. Had she not pleaded guilty, she would have faced additional charges of bank fraud, wire fraud and money laundering that could have sent her to prison for the rest of her life. The following month, Dixon's new finance director said that the city had seen an almost $3 million rebound since Crundwell's arrest, but that the operating budget was still off by $16.6 million. It was also reported that Dixon lost $30 million in operating funds over the prior decade. The city sued its outside auditors, as well as the city's banker, Fifth Third Bank, for ignoring numerous red flags in Crundwell's actions. In September 2013, the auditors and Fifth Third agreed to pay the city $40 million in a legal settlement, while the auction of Crundwell's assets brought in over $9 million.Barichello, Derek. Dixon to recoup $40 million. Sauk Valley Media, 2013-09-25. At sentencing on February 14, 2013, prosecutors sought the maximum sentence of twenty years in federal prison. Their case was bolstered by testimony from Burke and city staffers that Crundwell used dramatic analogies to force spending cuts in order to cover up her theft, which left Dixon unable to provide the most basic services. The defense asked for thirteen years, saying that Crundwell had cooperated with authorities in recovering the money. Ultimately, Reinhard sentenced Crundwell to nineteen years and seven months in prison, close to what prosecutors had sought. Reinhard noted that she put her passion for raising horses ahead of the needs of the city residents who had entrusted her with their funds, and that a significant prison term was required to restore public confidence. Reinhard was so disgusted with Crundwell's behavior that he revoked her bail and remanded her to custody rather than allow her to self-report to prison. Crundwell appealed the sentence, but the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals upheld it in November 2013. The fraud scheme of Rita Crundwell has been the subject of academic and professional publications. Apostolou, Apostolou, and Thibadoux describe the mechanics of the fraud scheme and review the control deficiencies that allowed the fraud scheme to exist and to remain undetected. The authors also review the shortcomings of the external auditors that allowed the city‚Äôs financial statements to be materially misstated. On September 20, 2012, Crundwell was also indicted on sixty state counts of theft, alleging that she stole $11.2 million from April 2010 until the day of her arrest. Burke and Lee County State's Attorney Henry Dixon said the state charges, which carried a minimum of six years per count, were a backup in case Crundwell was acquitted on the federal charges. The state charges were dropped in April 2013. Dixon's successor as state's attorney, Anna Sacco-Miller, said that it did not make sense to spend taxpayer money on prosecuting Crundwell, as there were virtually no assets left for the state to seize (though Dixon had initially said he had no plans to seize assets from her). Sacco-Miller also said that because Illinois sentencing guidelines require state and federal sentences to run concurrently, Crundwell would likely serve out any sentence imposed at the state level while she was still in federal prison.Jeffreys, Samantha.

This area was privately owned and used by the leaseholders of local business premises as a car park for their use and that of their customers. It was not a public car park. Persistent abuse of the area by members of the public parking in it without permission or authority had caused obstruction and inconvenience and this led the leaseholders to engage the respondent, Thomas Anker's employers, Armtrac Security Services, in an effort to resolve the problem. On being engaged, Armtrac erected a number of prominent notices warning those that parked in the area without authority or permission that it was private property and their vehicles were liable to being wheel clamped and might, also, be removed. The notices made clear that a release fee must be paid before a clamp was removed and that additional fees had to be paid if the vehicle was towed away. The prominence of the notices and the simplicity of the message they sought to convey was never at issue during the ensuing case. Shortly after Mr Arthur parked his car, for which he had neither permission nor authority, Mr Anker came across it and on inspecting it and finding that no parking permit issued by the leaseholders was displayed he fitted a wheel clamp to it. Some forty-five minutes later Mr Arthur returned to his car and found that the clamp had been fitted to it. He refused to pay the release fee and Mr Anker refused to remove the clamp without the payment of the fee. A prolonged and heated disagreement between the parties then followed that lasted into the early evening. During this Mrs Annette Arthur, who had arrived at the scene in another vehicle, assaulted Mr Anker, attempts were made to fit a wheel clamp to the vehicle she had been driving and Mr Arthur attempted, unsuccessfully to drive away in his car with the clamp still in place. Ultimately, the various parties departed and Mr Arthur's vehicle was left in the car park for the night with a second wheel clamp fitted to it. At some point during that night Mr Arthur returned and removed both wheel clamps. By the time that Mr Anker returned in the morning there was no sign of Mr Arthur's vehicle or of the wheel clamps, chains or padlocks. At length, civil proceedings were initiated by the Arthur's and a counter suit issued by Mr Anker. This came before Truro County Court in April 1993 and was heard by Judge Anthony Thompson QC. The Arthur's sought to obtain aggravated and exemplary damages for malicious falsehood and tortious interference with their car. Mr Anker pleaded, by way of defence, that Mr Arthur had trespassed in the car park and that he was entitled therefore to fit the clamp the notices warning of such had been seen by Mr Arthur who had effectively consented to the action. Mr Anker also claimed damages in respect of the assault by Mrs Arthur. Judge Thompson found that Mr Arthur had been a trespasser from the outset and had importantly seen and understood the consequences of the warning signs. He also dismissed the argument, advanced by the Arthurs, that Mr Anker had committed the offences of theft and blackmail as set out in Black v Carmichael. The judge accepted the argument that Mr Anker's actions were founded in the ancient right of \\"self help\\" and that as the use of a car park space was a valuable commodity being prevented from using it as the result of the presence of a trespasser therefore incurred a loss. On this basis he found that the demand for ¬£40 was reasonable. He further found that as Mr Arthur was fully aware of the warning contained in the prominent notices at the time he parked and that, as a consequence, he had consented to the clamping thereby rendering Mr Anker's actions lawful when they would otherwise have been tortious. Mr and Mrs Arthur's case was rejected and Mr Anker was awarded damages in respect of the missing clamps and for the assault. The Arthur's appealed and the matter was transferred to the Court of Appeal  Judgment  After considerable legal argument the judges dismissed the appeal. They held that Mr Arthur was fully aware of the fact that he was trespassing and that by doing so he exposed himself to the risk of his vehicle being clamped. By entering onto the land and being aware of the risk he had consented to the clamping (Volenti non fit injuria - \\"to a willing person, injury is not done\\") and there had been no tortious interference with his vehicle on Mr Anker's part, by his fitting Mr Arthur's vehicle with a wheel clamp, as a consequence. It was also held that a flat rate charge for the release of the clamp was appropriate - \\"a commercial figure covering the clamping firm's expenses plus an appropriate profit element\\" and that distress damage feasant (the distraining upon or withholding of goods involved in a trespass as a means of securing the payment of damages) did not apply in this case, as the judge at the original hearing had also decided. it was held that a mere trespass was insufficient and that some element of damage must be suffered. Such damage need not be physical but could be found in obstruction or denial of use but there no evidence of that in this case. In any event, based on the facts of this case, were distress damage feasant to be levied then the landowner or his agent could only seek the value of damages caused and nothing further. Costs were awarded against the appellants. Subsequent events On 1 October 2012, the clamping of vehicles on private land became a criminal offence as a consequence of the passing into law of the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012. However, the case remains relevant insofar as its interpretation extends to parking enforcement on private land. =Cases referred to= Smith v Baker & Sons [1891] AC 325 - (Volenti) Cummings v Grainger [1977] QB 397 - (Consent) Ashdown v Samuel Williams & Sons Ltd [1957] QB 409 - (Consent - verbal warning) Lloyd v Director of Public Prosecutions [1992] 1 All ER 982 - (Consent - clamping) Reynell v Champernoon [1631] Cro Car 228 - (Distress damage feasant) Williams v Ladner [1798] 8 Dum & E 72 - (Distress damage feasant) Ambergate, Nottingham and Boston and Eastern Junction Railway Co v Midland Railway Co [1853] 2 E & B 793 - (Distress damage feasant) Boden v Roscoe [1894] 1 QB 604 - (Damage to land) Sorrell v Paget [1950] 1 KB 252 - (Damage to land) R v Howson [1966] 55 DLR 2d 582 - (Technical trespass insufficient for award of damages) Controlled Parking Systems Ltd v Sedgwick [1980] 4 WWR 425 - (Necessity for actual damage) (Canadian case) Jamieson's Tow & Salvage Ltd v Murray [1984] 2 NZLR 144 - (Necessity for actual damage) (New Zealand case) Black v Carmichael [1992] SCCR 709 - (Finding that clamping amounted to theft and extortion) (Scottish case) Silverstein v HM Advocate [1949] JC 160 (Legitimacy of demand) (Scottish case) Bunch v Kennington [1841] 1 QB 679 (Property privileged from seizure without warning) Notes Bibliography *Clamping, Tony Weir, The Cambridge Law Journal, Vol. 55, No. 3 Nov., 1996, pp. 423‚Äì425 *Essential Tort Law, Richard Owen, Cavendish Publishing, Third Edition, 2000, p. 159 *Business Law, S.B.

He was a Dominican missionary in Moldavia and was bishop of Skopje (1645 - 1649), custodian canon of Esztergom and Bishop of Csan√°d. His sermons had great success both in Greek and Italian. Biography Giacinto Macripodari was a Greek born on the Aegean island of Chios, which was part of the Ottoman empire at the time, in 1610. His family were Catholic and during his youth he traveled overseas to further his education. From 1632 to 1636 he studied in a theological school in Paris. After he completed his studies Macripodari traveled back to his native Chios where he became vicar and taught at the Dominican monastery. Several years later the learned Macripodari moved to the Christian quarter of the Ottoman empire's capital, Constantinople, where he soon became vicar of the Dominican monastery. His sermons had great attainment both in the Greek and Italian languages. In 1645 Macripodari became the confessor of the German envoy to Constantinople Alexander von Greiffenklau, this association and support ultimately helped further his career. Macripodari was consequently appointed custodian canon of Esztergom in 1645. He traveled to Vienna where Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor nominated him as the titular bishop of Skopje, a post he held from July 29, 1645 to 1649. Subsequently, Macripodari sought to obtain a regular episcopal seat. He migrated to Moldavia in 1646, where he stayed in Jassy, its capital city. In 1658 he was appointed by Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor as Bishop of Csan√°d. He continued to serve until the 2 May 1668. Makripodari then moved to Nagyszombat where he was the assistant bishop of the Archbishop of Esztergom. Makripodari died in 1672.

History An estimate of the distribution of Lebanon's main religious groups, 1991, based on a map by GlobalSecurity.org Lebanon religious groups distribution An estimate of the area distribution of Lebanon's main religious groups =Origins= The cultural and linguistic heritage of the Lebanese people is a blend of both indigenous Phoenician elements, Arab culture and the foreign cultures that have come to rule the land and its people over the course of thousands of years. In a 2013 interview the lead investigator, Pierre Zalloua, pointed out that genetic variation preceded religious variation and divisions:\\"Lebanon already had well- differentiated communities with their own genetic peculiarities, but not significant differences, and religions came as layers of paint on top. There is no distinct pattern that shows that one community carries significantly more Phoenician than another.\\" Genealogical DNA testing has shown that 27,7% of Lebanese Muslims (non-Druze) belong to the Y-DNA haplogroup J1. Although there is common ancestral roots, these studies show some difference was found between Muslims and non-Muslims in Lebanon, of whom only 17.1% have this haplotype. As haplogroup J1 finds its putative origins in the Arabian peninsula, this likely means that the lineage was introduced by Arabs beginning at the time of the 7th century Muslim conquest of the Levant and has persisted among the Muslim population ever since. On the other hand, only 4.7% of all Lebanese Muslims belong to haplogroup R1b, compared to 9.6% of Lebanese Christians. Modern Muslims in Lebanon thus do not seem to have a significant genetic influence from the Crusaders, who probably introduced this common Western European marker to the extant Christian populations of the Levant when they were active in the region from 1096 until around the turn of the 14th century. Haplogroup J2 is also a significant marker in throughout Lebanon (27%). This marker found in many inhabitants of Lebanon, regardless of religion, signals pre-Arab descendants, including the Phoenicians. These genetic studies show us there is no significant differences between the Muslims and non-Muslims of Lebanon.Zalloua, Pierre A., Y-Chromosomal Diversity in Lebanon Is Structured by Recent Historical Events, The American Journal of Human Genetics 82, 873‚Äì882, April 2008 Relations =With Saudi Arabia= The Sunnis of Lebanon have close ties with Saudi Arabia, which supports them financially.

Stark was born to a Jewish family in Brooklyn, New York. He graduated from Ohio University in 1951 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English and a Bachelor of Science degree in education. He graduated from the University of Minnesota in 1959 with a master's degree in Educational Psychology.Ohio University Alumni Association web page, \\"2011 alumni awardees,\\" http://www.ohioalumni.org/2011-alumni-awardees Stark received his Ph.D. in Educational Administration and Counseling in June, 1963 from Case Western Reserve University. He was Dean of Students at Moorhead State University 1962‚Äì63. He was assistant professor and coordinator of human relations programs at the University of Minnesota, 1963‚Äì1970. American Civil Liberties Union involvement Stark left the University of Minnesota in 1973 to head the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota, then known as the Minnesota Civil Liberties Union (MCLU). Stark was elected president of the MCLU in 1966. Until then, the board of the MCLU had taken an accommodationist position on religion in the schools, but Stark persuaded them in 1967 to take a separationist position. Stark claimed to have been \\"greatly inspired\\" by the leading church- state separationist in Minnesota, Samuel Scheiner of the Jewish-Christian Community Relations Council of Minnesota. From then on, he was \\"the undisputed leader\\" of the church-state separation movement in the state. In 1980, Stark filed suit against the school district of Bloomington, Minnesota, challenging its practice of having a religious invocation at high school graduation. The suit was dismissed because Stark lacked standing in Bloomington. The debacle highlighted the MCLU's frequent inability to find live plaintiffs for its lawsuits. (Ibid). Stark has often been a critic of organized religion. \\"I think the Roman Catholic church is the major institution pushing for restrictions on other peoples' civil liberties,\\" he told an interviewer in 1980, \\"and the Mormon church is second.\\" \\"One of Stark's trademarks,\\" a journalist noted in 1988, \\"has been holding MCLU press conferences on Sunday ... to seek maximum coverage.\\" During his time heading the MCLU, Stark was \\"denounced from pulpits as an agent of the devil and from police headquarters as a stooge for pornographers.\\" The losing side of the 1967 board election and policy change, among them longtime editor and activist Bernard Casserly, alleged that Stark's \\"vociferousness and his inability to separate civil liberties from [radical] political sentiment\\" caused a severe split in the organization and changed its focus from one \\"committed to civil liberties to one steeped in radical politics, one that endorsed political candidates, came out against the Vietnam War, and supported the impeachment of Richard Nixon.\\" They claim that Stark \\"orchestrated the 1967 board election so that the MCLU was, in effect, purged of those members opposed to political activism.\\" The organization also lost members over well-publicized national battles of the ACLU, especially its defense of a Nazi march in Skokie, Illinois, in 1977, and a Ku Klux Klan rally in Tupelo, Mississippi. Stark claimed in retrospect that those controversies were good for the organization. \\"[Skokie] was a great issue,\\" he said in 1980. \\"It cleansed the ACLU.\\" In 1985, a rival slate of activists ran for the MCLU board to challenge Stark's leadership, accusing him of \\"being domineering and manipulative in his treatment of the 36-member MCLU board,\\" which they contended had led to \\"serious organizational problems,\\" but the slate was defeated. Some board members denied that Stark was a dictator. \\"Matt is regularly voted down by the board on substantive issues,\\" said Lynn Castner, president of MCLU from 1974 to 1980. In mid-1987, Stark went to half- time status at the MCLU but resumed his former role as board president and continued to oversee the staff. He only renewed the contracts of one of the four executive directors who served under him during this time. Stark resigned from the MCLU board in 1995. In March 1996, a pro-Stark faction of the board voted in six new board seats, and elected members to fill them for terms as long as six years. However, the national ACLU rejected these bylaw changes as \\"undemocratic.\\" Awards and recognition The University of Minnesota established the Dr. Matthew Stark Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Faculty and Student Award to recognize contributions to civil rights and liberties. It annually presents an award to both a faculty member and a student. The Hennepin County Bar Association awarded Stark its Advancement of Justice award in 1987. In 2008, Stark presided as grand marshal of the Twin Cities Gay Pride Festival and Parade and received the Pride award from Twin Cities Pride. He won the medal of merit from the Ohio University Alumni Association in 2011. Personal life Stark married Terri Stark in 1985. They have no children. Stark wintered in Florida, where he continued to be active in the ACLU chapter in Lee County and in the local Gay Social Network and serves on the ACLU national advisory council.

Hans Crocker a business associate of Kilbourn was the first editor. It became a daily in the mid-1840s, about the time the city of Milwaukee was formally incorporated. It was started, typically of frontier papers, as a vehicle to promote the real- estate and community development efforts of the founder. The Advertiser paper initially concerned itself with the land development and new town growing at the mouth of the Milwaukee River. Soon it became linked to politics, and the paper became the mouthpiece of Kilbourn, promoter of Milwaukee's West Side, who was locked in political combat with Solomon Juneau, promoter of Milwaukee's East Side. This feud resulted in another paper, Wisconsin's fourth, the Milwaukee Sentinel being established by Juneau in 1837. In 1841 it was purchased by J.A. Noonan and changed to the Courier. In 1845 the Courier was purchased by Messrs. Brown & Sullivan. In 1847, these gentlemen sold out to Messrs.

The championship was introduced on February 12, 1979, at a Mid-South Coliseum live event. It was active until May 1981 when the title belt was abandoned after Crusher Lisowski left the promotion. It debuted as a part of a storyline to introduce Don Fargo to the Memphis wrestling territory; this allowed Fargo to challenge various wrestlers in hardcore-themed matches. Like most professional wrestling \\"brass knuckle\\" championships, both wrestlers would heavily tape their fists to give the impression that each participant were wearing brass knuckles; the title was generally defended in no-disqualification matches and it was legal to punch an opponent. Fargo and Lisowski were the only champions during its original run, with Gino Martino as the first and last champion of the revived AWA Superstars version. History The AWA Brass Knuckles Championship was first defended on February 12, 1979, at the Mid-South Coliseum, in a match between Don Fargo and Robert Gibson. Fargo was billed by the promotion as the \\"World Brass Knuckles Champion\\", however, the title mostly defended in the Continental Wrestling Association. Together with manager Al Greene, Fargo would use the title to engage in wild brawls with other stars of the Memphis territory. During his 1979-80 run with the CWA and his brother Jackie Fargo were allies of Jerry \\"The King\\" Lawler; Fargo also formed tag teams Chris Colt, The Destroyer, and Dennis Condrey. One of his most notable matches as AWA Brass Knuckles Champion was against Jimmy Valiant on September 29, 1980, who defeated Fargo via disqualification. The title was abandoned after Fargo left the Memphis territory at the end of the month. On October 20, 1980, Crusher Lisowski won the vacant title after defeating \\"Crusher\\" Jerry Blackwell in St. Paul, Minnesota. Lisowski defended the title in the American Wrestling Association for five months until leaving the promotion in the summer of 1981, after having suffered a career-ending injury at the hands of Jerry Blackwell, and the title became abandoned once again.

The original store was established in 1908 on the same site and was razed in 1927 to make room for the present building, constructed in Rustic architectural style. Two blocks from the west entrance to Yellowstone National Park, Eagle's Store is the oldest operating business in West Yellowstone, and is still run by the same family who founded it.  History  Eyeing the growing popularity of tourism to Yellowstone National Park, the Union Pacific Railroad constructed its Oregon Short Line segment to the West Gate of Yellowstone Park between 1905 and 1907. In 1907 Samuel Peter Eagle, a Yellowstone Park employee, requested a permit from the United States Forest Service to lease commercial space next to the railroad's right of way. In June 1908 the Forest Service surveyed a six-block townsite on the western boundary of Yellowstone Park and issued business permits on one-acre (0.4 ha) plots. The first three business operators were Eagle and his partner, Alex Stuart, who built a general store; L. A. Murray, who opened the Yellowstone Hotel in 1909; and Charles Arnet, who opened the Yellowstone Store. While these and other ventures primarily serviced railway passengers in the early 20th century, the introduction of the automobile in 1916 brought many more visitors to Yellowstone Park and business flourished, turning West Yellowstone into a permanent town. In 1908 Stuart left the partnership to open his own business; he bought the lease to Arnet's store in 1910. Eagle's Store continued to be operated by Eagle and his descendants. When it first opened, Eagle's Store stocked \\"candies, tobaccos, Kodaks, postals, cigars, fishing rods and rented dusters\\". A white marble soda fountain manufactured by the Liquid Carbonic Company of Minnesota was added in 1910 at a cost of $1391.80., The local post office was located in Eagle's Store from 1909 to 1935, with Sam Eagle as the postmaster. Following the construction of its new building in 1930, the store began to offer a wider selection of merchandise and services. As of 2012, it sells sportswear, western wear, hiking and backpacking gear, fishing tackle, Native American arts and crafts, and souvenirs. The newer building retained the mahogany bar and soda fountain installed in 1910 and added a front bar and stools.  Design  The original Eagle's Store, built by Eagle and Stuart, was a by structure with a false front. Eagle enlarged the store in 1913 and then had it razed in 1927 to build the three-story structure that stands today. The current structure, begun in 1927 and completed in 1930, was designed by Bozeman architect Fred F. Willson, who also designed the Coca-Cola bottling plant that is part of the Bozeman Brewery Historic District. Willson donated his services to the project in order to promote the Western Rustic architectural style. The design was similar to that of Old Faithful Inn in Yellowstone Park, which utilizes National Park Service rustic style, of which exposed logs are a key element. Willson set fir logs measuring to long into a base of rhyolite and concrete. Buttresses were made of basalt.  Family business  All 10 of the children of Sam Eagle (1881‚Äì1950) and his wife, Ida Christine Carlson (1883‚Äì1962), worked in the store as children, as have many other descendants and relatives. Now in its fourth generation of ownership. Many family members are avid skiers, including Heather McPhie, a great- granddaughter of Sam and Ida, who competed in the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. The family has set up its own charitable foundation, which benefits people with disabilities, education, and youth programs.

In a career which lasted from 1974 until September 1977, he ran 21 times and won 5 races. He recorded his most important victory when winning the Classic St. Leger Stakes by ten lengths, one of the biggest margins in the race's 200-year history. The following season he became a difficult and temperamental performer, but was one of the leading middle distance horses in Europe, winning two Group races and finishing second in Britain's most prestigious all-aged race, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. He was retired to stud after an unsuccessful five-year-old season. Background Bruni was a grey horse bred in County Kildare, Ireland by the Barretstown Castle Stud. As yearling he was sent to the Newmarket sales where he was bought for 7,800 guineas by the bloodstock agent J. T. Doyle on behalf of Charles St George. Unlike many grey thoroughbreds, Bruni was a very light colour from the start of his racing career. He was sired by the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud winner Sea Hawk, from whom he inherited his colour, out of Bombazine, a mare who had finished fourth in The Oaks. St George sent the colt into training with Captain Ryan Price at Downs House, Findon, West Sussex. Racing career =1974: two-year-old season= Bruni was very backward (immature) as a two-year-old. He made his only appearance of 1974 in a maiden race at Warwick Racecourse in which he finished unplaced. =1975: three-year- old season= In April 1975, Bruni finished second in a maiden race oven one mile at Sandown Park and then won a similar event at Salisbury in early May. Bruni entered contention for the Epsom Derby when he was moved up in distance to one and a half miles and finished second, beaten a short-head, to No Alimony in the Predominate Stakes at Goodwood. Bruni was already proving a quite difficult horse to train, and had to be exercised separately from Price's other horses. Bruni's progress persuaded Lester Piggott to choose him as his ride in the Derby but he started an outsider at odds of 16/1 in a field of eighteen runners. Bruni lost his position when forced wide on the turn into the straight and finished fourteenth behind Grundy. He returned from the race slightly lame and soon afterwards contracted a viral infection which kept him off the racecourse for almost three months. He reappeared in the Friends of the Variety Club Stakes over ten furlongs at Sandown on 30 August and won by seven lengths in course record time. Two weeks after his win at Sandown, Bruni was moved up in class and distance for the Classic St. Leger Stakes over fourteen and a half furlongs at Doncaster. Ridden by Tony Murray and starting at odds of 9/1, Bruni took the lead early in the straight and drew steadily clear of his opponents to win by ten lengths from King Pellinore and Libra's Rib. The win provoked celebrations in Findon, while bookmakers in the nearby town of Worthing reportedly had \\"one of their blackest days\\". At St George's insistence, Bruni ran again that autumn as he was sent to Paris to contest the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. He led briefly in the straight but faded in the closing stages to finish seventh to Star Appeal. =1976: four-year-old season= There was a disagreement between Bruni's owner and trainer about his 1976 campaign: Price favoured the \\"Cup\\" races over extended distances, but St George insisted on running him in the major middle distance events. He began his season in the Yorkshire Cup at York Racecourse in May and won easily while carrying the \\"top weight\\" of 127 pounds, beating Mr Bigmore and Sea Anchor by two lengths. After his poor performance in the previous year's Derby, Bruni bypassed the Coronation Cup at Epsom and was sent to Royal Ascot for the Hardwicke Stakes. In this race, Bruni showed the first public signs of temperamental problems as he appeared reluctant to race and fell back twelve lengths behind the leaders. He made up the lost ground and took the lead in the straight but was unable to hold off the renewed challenge of Orange Bay and was beaten a head. Bruni produced a similar performance when starting 6/1 second favourite for the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes over the same course and distance a month later. He was again left many lengths behind at the start and his problems were compounded when Piggot's foot slipped from the stirrup. By the final quarter-mile however he was back in contention and finished second, one length behind the French filly Pawneese, and a short head in front of Orange Bay. At Ascot in September, Bruni returned in the Cumberland Lodge Stakes. Yet again, he was reluctant to race in the early stages and fell twelve lengths behind the rest of the runners. By the straight, however, he had made up the lost ground and took the lead before drawing clear to win by five lengths. As a result of this performance he was made second favourite for the Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp. He made progress to dispute the lead and looked a likely winner a furlong from the finish but was outpaced in the closing stages and finished fifth to Ivanjica. Following his run in the Arc, Bruni was sent to race in California. =1977: five-year- old season= Bruni was unplaced in all of his three starts while in the United States, with his best effort being a fifth-place finish in the 1977 San Luis Rey Handicap at Santa Anita. Bruni's connections felt the horse \\"was not suited to the tight American circuits\\" and made the decision to return Bruni to Price's yard in April 1977 in preparation for the Ascot Gold Cup. As a five-year-old, Bruni was aimed at the major English staying races, but failed to recover his best form. On his debut he won the Henry II Stakes at Sandown by a head, but was disqualified and placed second for bumping the runner-up, Grey Baron. Bruni contested the two and a half-mile Gold Cup at Royal Ascot, but made no impression in the straight and finished fourth to Sagaro, Buckskin and Citoyen. In July he was dropped in distance for a second attempt at the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes and finished seventh of the eleven runners behind The Minstrel and Orange Bay. Shortly afterwards, he returned to extended distances and was beaten by Grey Baron in the Goodwood Cup. Bruni's final start was in the Doncaster Cup at the St Leger meeting. He appeared to be struggling from the start and pulled up lame in the straight. Stud career In 1978, Bruni was initially retired to the Ashleigh Stud in Dublin. In 1980 he was relocated to the Hamilton Stud in Newmarket, where he stood until he was sold \\"to go abroad\\" for an undisclosed sum in December 1981. Bruni made no impact as a sire of winners. The best of his offspring was probably Brunico, who defeated Shardari in the 1986 Ormonde Stakes. His last recorded foals were born in 1982.

The novel is written by Anglo-Afghan author, filmmaker, and adventurer Tahir Shah. It was released on July 5, 2012 by Secretum Mundi Publishing. The full title of the book is Timbuctoo: Being a singular and most animated account of an illiterate American sailor, taken as a slave in the great Zahara and, after trials and tribulations aplenty, reaching London where he narrated his tale. The story takes place between 1810‚Äîwhen Adams was shipwrecked‚Äîand the Spring on 1816, when he set sail for his home in Hudson, New York. Background In the early 1990s, while \\"in the bowels of the London Library\\", the author, Tahir Shah, says he noticed an old book propping up a water pipe. Surprised that such an old and apparently valuable volume should be being used for this purpose, Shah pulled it down, and read it. The book was The Narrative of Robert Adams, the tale of an illiterate American sailor who had been shipwrecked on the west coast of Africa at Capo Blanco in 1810. At a time when all the major European powers were eagerly dispatching their best explorers to capture and then sack Timbuktu (among them the likes of Mungo Park and Hugh Clapperton), the only people not searching for the African El Dorado, was the fledgling United States of America. And so it was all the more surprising when an illiterate American sailor was discovered half naked and starving on the streets of London in the winter of 1815, claiming rather nonchalantly, that he had been to Timbuktu. He had been taken there as a white slave, having been captured by Toureg warriors. Timbuctoo is the fictional account of Robert Adams' journey to Timbuktu (now in the West African nation of Mali), loosely based on Adams' own narrative, and his arrival in Regency London. As Shah writes in a foreword: \\"The book you hold is my own fictional version of what is surely one of the greatest stories of survival ever told. I can only offer gratitude to the reader for turning a blind eye to any historical inaccuracies, and for tolerating a novelist's liberties. I am no historian, and have massaged facts and fictions into place, re-conjuring history.\\" Shunning conventional publishing models, Shah decided to publish the book himself, under the name Secretum Mundi Publishing. He says he did this in part to achieve the book he had \\"always dreamt for\\", and in part to draw attention to the frailties of the existing publishing system. Timbuctoo is produced in a limited edition of 5000 copies with six large fold out maps. Five of these are reprinted from Richard Horwood's Georgian atlas of London, the last, a facsimile of the map published in the original Narrative of Robert Adams. Many of the characters that appear were contemporary to the time. They include the Prince Regent (later George IV), Lord Alvanley, Sir Joseph Banks and Lord Byron.

It is a large book, weighing 2 kilos (almost 4.5 lbs). It has marbled endpapers, a silk bookmark, a pouch at the rear with additional inserts, and six large fold-out maps, some of which were designed by Richard Horwood. The paper is wood-free, and the cover is embossed with raised gold type. Treasure hunt Inspired by Timbuctoo's legend as the city of gold, Shah has hidden four golden treasures around the world. The clues to locate them are concealed within the limited edition book, and on the Timbuctoo website. Consisting of four gilded bronze heads from West Africa, the treasures have been buried in Europe, the Americas, Oceania, and Africa. Using the clues encoded in the book, and others on the web site, code-breakers will have a chance at winning one of the gilded heads. By using the GPS facility on their smart phones and iPads, treasure seekers can pinpoint the exact location of each treasure. Shah created an Indiana Jones-style video to promote the hiding of the first head. Further reading * Volume 46, Number 6.

In June 2011, he was arrested in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, while overseeing a rice growing agricultural venture that he had invested in, and was jailed for 18 months on suspicion of money laundering, though he was never formally charged. Ostreicher maintained his innocence and stated that the allegations by the Bolivian government were \\"the scam of the century\\". His family and friends initiated a public effort to plea for his release, and actor-activist Sean Penn visited Ostreicher in Bolivia and pledged to work for his release. On December 18, 2012, Ostreicher was released from prison on $14,000 bail and placed under house arrest. Bolivian officials were later arrested for what authorities state was an extortion ring. On December 16, 2013, Ostreicher arrived in the United States after 30 months in Bolivia. It was unclear how he managed to flee the country. Background =Personal life= Ostreicher was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1959 to David and Violet Ostreicher, both Orthodox Jews. He has 2 children and 5 grandchildren. =Bolivian investment and arrest= A group of investors, including Ostreicher and Geneva lawyer Andre Zolty, invested at least $25 million in a rice farming project in Bolivia in 2008. Zolty stated that the idea originally came from Claudia Liliana Rodriguez who he had worked with in Geneva. The investors became concerned with irregularities and suspected that Rodriguez was cheating them. Ostreicher was dispatched to Bolivia to handle the situation, and pursued criminal charges against Rodriguez. The investors also state that Rodriguez became involved in a romantic and financial relationship with a drug trafficker by the name of Maximiliano Dorado. Dorado was arrested in 2010, and was imprisoned in Brazil. On June 4, 2011, after an initial investigation, Ostreicher was arrested for suspicion of money laundering and criminal organization. The prosecutors also claimed that one of the investors, Andre Zolty, was under investigation in Switzerland, however, the Swiss authorities have denied this. Rodriguez has also been arrested. Ostreicher was imprisoned at Palmasola prison. Ostreicher was brought before a judge who after several hearings ordered for him to be released on September 23, 2011. However the judge reversed his decision a week later. A month later the judge was promoted and a new judge was assigned to the case. Following several postponements, the second judge recused himself from the case; no other judge had yet to be assigned. A marriage certificate showing Ostreicher was married in Bolivia was entered into evidence during the September 23 hearing. Ostreicher denied that he was married to a Bolivian. Ostreicher was visited by actor Sean Penn on October 31, 2012. Bolivian law allows for imprisonment without charge for 18 months during the investigative phase. Since Ostreicher was arrested in early June 2011, the 18-month mark occurred in early December 2012. Ostreicher appeared in a hearing on Tuesday, December 11, and the judge ordered that the case be sent back to the lower court. Actor Penn was present at the hearing. On December 18, Ostreicher was released from prison on $14,000 bail and was placed under house arrest. Government extortion ring Fifteen people, including prosecutors, government officials, and the judge who originally had Ostreicher imprisoned, were arrested in what authorities say was an extortion ring. They include: * Gustavo Dagner Cespedes Rosales - arrested on 11/27/2012. Minister of Government's Representative in Santa Cruz. * Fernando Rivera Tardio - arrested on 11/28/2012. Judicial Counsel for the Minister of Government. One of the ring leaders of \\"The Red\\".

Man holding a sign at a rally in NYC =White House petition= On May 3, 2012, supporters of Ostreicher initiated an online petition on the White House We the People website requesting the Obama Administration to assist in the effort to free Jacob. As of December 2, 2019, 35,958 people signed the petition. A total of 25,000 signatures were needed by June 2, 2012, in order to submit the petition to the White House; this requirement was met. =Congressional hearings= Representative Chris Smith (R-NJ) held a hearing in the Congress on June 6, 2012, to investigate the role that the United States Department of State has played in helping free Jacob from Bolivia. Hearings were also held on August 1, 2012, and May 20, 2013. Return to United States On December 16, 2013, Ostreicher arrived in the US after 30 months in Bolivia. He was reported to be in an undisclosed location with Sean Penn and receiving medical attention. It was unclear how he had fled the country. In May 2014 Ostreicher revealed that after his release, Penn had personally nursed him back to mental and physical health at the latter's home.

He played in the Cuban National Series from 2004 through 2011, and then defected from Cuba to play for the Atlanta Braves of Major League Baseball (MLB). He also played for the LG Twins of the KBO League. Career =Cuban baseball= Garc√≠a debuted in the Cuban National Series in 2004 with Ciego de √Åvila. In the Cuban National Series, Garcia began as a shortstop, and then shifted to play other infield and outfield positions. During the 2008‚Äì09 season, he had a .355 batting average, .426 on-base percentage (OBP), and .613 slugging percentage (SLG) in 282 at-bats. That season, he recorded 21 home runs and 67 runs batted in. Garc√≠a played for the Cuban national baseball team in the 2009 World Port Tournament, leading all players in batting average at .500. In 2010‚Äì11, his final season in the Cuban National Series, Garcia batted .334 with a .397 OBP and .623 SLG in 308 at-bats. Garc√≠a then defected from Cuba via Nicaragua and Mexico in August 2010, making it to the United States in January 2011. He played the 2011‚Äì12 winter in the Venezuelan Winter League, where he hit .270 with a .313 OBP and .461 SLG in 152 at-bats during the regular season for the Navegantes del Magallanes. He then batted .376 with a .431 OBP and .548 SLG in 93 at-bats during the 2012 Caribbean Series with the Tigres de Aragua. Garc√≠a was named to the Caribbean Series All-Star Team as a center fielder. =New York Yankees= In August 2011, Major League Baseball (MLB) declared Garc√≠a ineligible to sign for six months due to fraudulent residency paperwork. He established residency in Venezuela and MLB declared him a free agent in February 2012. Garc√≠a signed with the Yankees on May 2, 2012 for $400,000. In 2012, Garc√≠a debuted for the Tampa Yankees of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League before being promoted to the Trenton Thunder of the Class AA Eastern League. In all for the season, he hit .263/.311/.424 with five home runs, 29 runs batted in (RBIs), and two stolen bases in 57 games. He played all three outfield positions, with most of the time split between CF and RF. The next year, Garc√≠a played for the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders of the Class AAA International League, with 6 games with the Rookie-level GCL Yankees as well. Between the teams, he finished the year with a .258 average, .308 OBP, .364 SLG, four home runs, 12 RBIs, and four steals in 56 games. Through the season, he again split the time mostly between CF and RF with a handful of games in LF. Garc√≠a spent the whole of 2014 with the RailRiders. For the year, in 86 games, he hit .319 with a .353 OBP, .474 SLG, nine home runs, 45 RBIs, and 11 steals. Like his previous seasons in the organization, Garc√≠a mostly played in the outfield, but spent 19 games at third base while also being the designated hitter in 8 games. The Yankees released Garc√≠a on April 1, 2015. =Atlanta Braves= He signed with the Atlanta Braves four days later, and was assigned to the Gwinnett Braves of the International League. On May 18, Garc√≠a was called up to the major leagues. He made his major league debut the next day, but was soon optioned back to Gwinnett. The Braves recalled Garc√≠a on July 25 after the Braves traded Juan Uribe and Kelly Johnson. Garcia hit his first career home run on July 26 off of Michael Wacha of the St. Louis Cardinals. On August 3, he hit a walk-off, 2-run home run against the San Francisco Giants, a game which the Braves won 9-8. Garc√≠a finished the season with a .277 batting average and ten home runs, becoming the second player in Braves' franchise history to hit ten or more home runs in less than 200 at- bats. Garc√≠a began the 2016 season as the Braves starting third baseman. In late April, the team began shifting him between left field and third base in order to keep his bat in the lineup while minimizing opportunities for Garc√≠a to make defensive miscues. The Braves optioned Garc√≠a to Gwinnett on May 6 to get him more playing time in left field. Three weeks later, he returned to the majors to play third base. Garc√≠a started at third for the rest of the season and hit .273 with 14 home runs. Garc√≠a hit for a .237 batting average, a .626 on-base plus slugging percentage, and four home runs until he was placed on the 10-day disabled list on May 16, 2017.

Four days later, Garc√≠a injured himself while batting and later underwent surgery on the ligament of his left ring finger. Garc√≠a returned to the major leagues in September, after rosters had expanded. =LG Twins= In January 2018, Garc√≠a was released from his contract with the Braves and signed with the LG Twins, a KBO League team to a one-year, $800,000 contract.

In 1377, the village was lost in a flood. Around 1500, Hieronymus Lauweryn van Watervliet commissioned the poldering of the land, and rebuilt the village.

She entered the Guinness Book of Records in 1983, which reported that she had given birth to 58 children. According to her husband Gerardo Secundo Albina, the couple were married in 1946 in Argentina, and had five sets of triplets ‚Äì all boys ‚Äì before emigrating to Chile. By the late 1980s \\"only\\" 40 of the children ‚Äì 24 boys and 16 girls ‚Äì were said to be still alive, and the Associated Press reported that 18 of them were still living with the couple in their cramped two-room shack on the outskirts of Santiago. The others were scattered around the world, from Japan to Sweden to the United States. Biography Leontina was said to have been abandoned as an infant along with her two brothers. They were raised in a church-run orphanage, but were separated when the brothers were adopted while she stayed behind in the orphanage. At the age of 12, she ran away and married Gerardo, a 30-year-old mule driver. She said that because she had been abandoned as an infant, she had pledged never to give up any children. Despite being aged between 59 and 62 at the time of the Times interview, she was open to the prospect of more children, though she recognised that it would be a struggle: \\"If God sends them to me, yes. But I'd like God to also consider me, now that I'm approaching old age.\\" She had tried birth control with an intrauterine device but it was not a success: \\"I got pregnant anyway and nearly died ... I think it was a punishment from God for doing something I shouldn't.\\" When Leontina's story became public she became something of a celebrity in Chile. She appeared on the popular television show S√°bados Gigante de Don Francisco, whose host Mario Kreutzberger (aka Don Francisco) presented her with an award for her fertility and maternal devotion. The country's major daily newspapers all wrote feature articles about her under headlines such as \\"The Incredible Story of Lady Leontina, Wife of the 'Infallible' Cowhand Gerardo Albina\\" (as La Tercera put it). Although her papers at the Chilean Civil Registry showed that she had given birth to 20 children since 1955, she was unable to prove that she had had the remaining children: \\"I don't have any records on the children who were born before 1955. Everything was lost in a fire in Argentina.\\" Because it was unable to verify the exact number of her children (estimates ranging from 55 to 64), in 1991 Guinness decided to delist Leontina's record. She died of diabetes on August 7, 1998. Chilean authorities had become suspicious of her claims as she had recorded the birth of another child in 1995 at the age of 69: only three women have ever been recorded as giving birth past the age of 66. A subsequent police investigation found that she had actually given birth to only 14 children: the remainder had been taken in from the streets or given to her by poor women including her cousins. According to police inspector Cristina Rojo, Leontina had perpetrated the fraud to claim food assistance from the Chilean government, and had systematically registered the children in rural civic offices that lacked computerised records to avoid detection.

Panzer Kaserne (German notation: Panzerkaserne) is a U.S. military installation in B√∂blingen, Germany, part of US Army Garrison Stuttgart.http://www.stuttgart.army.mil/command/Organizational%20Chart.html The post is administered by United States Army Installation Management Command-Europe (IMCOM-Europe), a legacy from its use as an Army installation since just after World War II. Panzer also hosts the headquarters of United States Marine Corps Forces, Europe & Africa (MARFOREURAF) and various Special Operations units of the Army and Navy supporting EUCOM and AFRICOM. History Panzer Kaserne and nearby Patch Barracks were constructed in 1938 for the German Army, Panzer Regiment 7 , 8 as well as Panzer Brigade 4 was stationed in Panzer Barracks from April 1938 (and both bases were joined by a specially designed trail due to the weight of tank traffic.) Additionally, the training area's were designed to train and test the new tank crews who were assigned to the 8th Panzer Regiment. There is also a small nearby training area- unusual for a Kaserne in an urban or suburban area.http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/panzer-kaserne-b.htm The 8th Panzer Regiment was the first unit assigned to the then Ludendorff Kaserne.http://www.stuttgartcitizen.com/uncovering-a-myszery-at-the-panzer- lta/ Local legend suggests that Adolf Hitler may have even delivered a speech from within the former Nazi Officer's Club building. Additional myths suggest that Panzer and nearby base of Patch, were used for testing of new and experimental Nazi technology, specifically tank modifications and improvements. Added to that, there is a myth that experimental tanks were disposed of by burial to prevent capture by advancing US troops. No one can verify for certain when the U.S. Forces accepted the transfer of the barracks, but it is believed it occurred in early July 1945. During the Cold War various units were assigned to Panzer - most notably units of the 1st ID (Forward) - a forward detached element of the 3rd Brigade 1st Infantry Division until 1990. Most currently assigned units are devoted to the support of U.S. European Command (EUCOM) at Patch Barracks and United States Africa Command (AFRICOM) at Kelley Barracks located in Stuttgart. =Units Currently Assigned = *1st Battalion, 10th Special Forces Group (Airborne) *Naval Special Warfare Unit Two *Naval Special Warfare Unit Ten *Special Operations Command, Europe *554th Military Police Company, 709th Military Police Battalion, 18 Military Police Brigade, 21st Theater Sustainment Command, US Armyhttp://www.army.mil/article/119907/ *United States Marine Corps Forces, Europe and Africa *POND Guard Force (composed of local nationals) *Federal Base Police Source:http://www.patriotfiles.com/index.php?name=Sections&req;=viewarticle&artid;=7982&page;=1 On Base Services Interior of the Panzer Kaserne Chapel during a town hall meeting for dependents and community leaders. =Education= Panzer is host to a DODEA Elementary, middle, and high school for dependent children and is served by nearby Stuttgart High School (formerly Patch American High School).

The NFL, MLB, NBA and NHL have millions of fans across the nation, and are an important part of American culture. Professional sports did not enter into the American West until the mid-twentieth century. However, the expansion of professional sports into the West has helped to increase the popularity of each of the professional leagues and has changed the landscape of professional sports in America. History Prior to World War II, top- level professional sports in the United States did not exist in the American West. Most teams were located in the Midwest or Northeast, and no top-level professional teams existed west of Kansas CityAbbot, Carl and Nicolaides, Becky M. \\"Professional Sports and Sunbelt Cities\\". OAH Magazine of History. October 2003, pages 27-28 The Pacific Coast League, a baseball league founded in 1903, was never recognized as a true major league, but its quality of play was considered very high. While many PCL players went on to play in the major leagues, teams often could offer competitive salaries to avoid being outbid for their players' services. After World War II, the PCL suffered a sharp drop in attendance, primarily due to the availability of major league games on television. The hammer blow to the PCL's major league dreams came in 1958, when the Brooklyn Dodgers moved to Los Angeles and the New York Giants moved to San Francisco. As a result, three of the PCL's flagship teams (the Los Angeles Angels, the Hollywood Stars and the San Francisco Seals) were immediately forced to relocate to smaller markets. Additionally, the PCL lost customers to the major league teams which now occupied the same territory. The league never recovered from these blows and reverted to Triple-A classification in 1958. The Western Hockey League (WHL; not to be confused with the modern junior hockey league of the same name) operated from 1952 to 1974. There was speculation that the WHL could grow into a major league capable of rivaling even the long-entrenched National Hockey League. Professional football had a limited presence on the West Coast. There were two barnstorming teams that used West Coast names and players in 1926 (the Los Angeles Buccaneers and Los Angeles Wildcats), but both teams were based in Illinois. West Coast football received a major boost in 1933, when the National Football League, after six years of hiring very few black players, imposed a formal color barrier, locking the best black football players out of the NFL and forcing them to find work elsewhere. For many, \\"elsewhere\\" turned out to be the West Coast: by the late 1930s, the integrated Los Angeles Bulldogs had risen to parity with the NFL, and by 1940, enough talent was there to launch the Pacific Coast Professional Football League. The PCPFL thrived through World War II until a sequence of events, triggered by the launch of the All-America Football Conference, led the NFL to establish a team in Los Angeles and lift its color barrier. The PCPFL spent its last years as a minor league, eventually folding in 1948.  Expansion to the West  After World War II, there were a number of factors leading to the expansion of professional sports in the West. The primary reason for expansion was the population boom of metropolitan areas in the West. Population centers grew at a much faster rate in the West than in other parts of the country. Leaders of growing metropolitan areas also felt that attracting professional sport teams was an important way to legitimize their communities as modern cities. In order to attract teams, cities used public funding to build new stadiums. Sports boosters argued that new stadiums not only provided cultural centers for the community, but helped to attract tourists and bring in new investment dollars to the city. Cities also offered teams favorable subsidies that provided further incentives for leagues to expand West.Rader, Benjamin G. American Sports: From the Age of Folk Games to the Age of Televised Sports. Sixth edition. Pearson Education, Inc. Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, 2009. Team owners jumped at the chance to relocate their teams to the West. Owners who had sustained financial losses over the years saw relocation as a viable option to increase short-term profits.Johnson, Arthur T. \\"Municipal Administration and the Sports Franchise Relocation Issue\\". Public Administration Review, November/December 1983. Pages 519-528. Western cities offered new stadiums, access to new markets, and subsidies that many cities in the East could not offer. Western cities also often offered broadcasting agreements and assumptions of past debts. Team owners used the desire of Western cities to host professional teams to their advantage. Owners were able to use the terms offered by Western cities to leverage negotiations with the cities in which they were originally located. Owners threatened relocation if cities did not build them new stadiums or offer increased subsidies. Expansion into the West was not possible without advances in transportation technology. Train travel was the primary means of transporting teams from city to city prior to World War II. Teams played multiple games during the course of the week, and it was not practical for teams to be located in the West due to the slow nature of train travel. In the decades following the War, air travel gained more widespread use. The advancement of air travel allowed teams to travel great distances in a much shorter time than by train. By reducing the time needed for cross-country trips, airplanes made it possible for teams in the West to compete with teams located in the Eastern half of the country. Early teams =Los Angeles Rams= The Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League were the first professional sports team to be located west of Kansas City. In 1946, Cleveland Rams owner Dan Reeves relocated the team from Cleveland to Los Angeles, following the team's victory in the 1945 NFL Championship Game. The Rams played their games in Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Not only were the Rams the first NFL team in the West, they were also the first NFL team to have African-American players on their squad since 1932 by signing Kenny Washington and Woody Strode in 1946. The Rams have been in the Los Angeles metropolitan area for most of the time since then, with the exception of a 21-season stretch (1995‚Äì2015) in which the team played in St. Louis, Missouri. =San Francisco 49ers= The San Francisco 49ers, currently in the NFL, began their life in the same season as the Rams arrived in Los Angeles, but in a different league‚Äîthey were one of the eight charter teams of the rival All-America Football Conference (AAFC). In the four seasons of the AAFC's existence, the Niners had the second-best cumulative record, behind the winner of all of the league's championships, the Cleveland Browns. When the AAFC folded after the 1949 season, the Niners were one of three AAFC teams accepted into the NFL. Of these three teams, the Niners and Browns still play in the league. The AAFC had a second team on the West Coast, the Los Angeles Dons, but that team was less successful and was not accepted into the NFL. =Los Angeles Dodgers and San Francisco Giants= The Los Angeles Dodgers and San Francisco Giants were the first MLB teams to play in the West, when they were relocated in 1958 from Brooklyn and New York, respectively. Both teams were motivated to move because of new stadiums being offered in California. The New York Giants played at the Polo Grounds since the team's inception, and owner Horace Stoneham longed for a new stadium due to the lack of attendance at home games in the seasons leading up to the move. Stoneham was not pleased with the way talks with New York City officials were going, so he began to look elsewhere. On August 19, 1957, Stoneham announced the Giants' relocation to San Francisco. The Giants played their first two seasons at Seals Stadium before moving to Candlestick Park in 1960.Nelson, Kevin. \\"Los Angeles Dodgers vs. San Francisco Giants, April 1958.\\" California History, Vol. 82, No. 4, 2005. Pages 44-61. Brooklyn Dodgers owner Walter O'Malley had a similar situation to that of Stoneham. O'Malley's team played in Ebbets Field, which seated only 35,000 fans, had parking spots for only 700 cars, and was located in a decaying neighborhood. New York officials once again failed to meet O'Malley's demands for a new stadium with more parking and that could be more easily reached. The city of Los Angeles offered O'Malley a new stadium in Chavez Ravine. The area provided easy access to multiple freeways as well as an uncontested media market in one of the nation's largest metropolitan areas. O'Malley talked with Stoneham about the move, and both agreed that the rivalry between the two clubs should remain intact. On October 8, 1957, O'Malley announced the Dodgers move to Los Angeles. On April 15, 1958 the two teams faced in the first regular season game since their relocation. The Giants won the game 8-0. =Los Angeles Lakers= The Los Angeles Lakers became the first NBA franchise to play in the West after they relocated from Minneapolis in 1960. The Lakers had some success on the court in Minneapolis, but attendance at home games had decreased significantly in the mid-to-late 1950s. Encouraged by the financial success of the Los Angeles Dodgers since their move from Brooklyn in 1958, Lakers owner Bob Short decided to relocate the team before the 1960‚Äì1961 season. The Lakers have gone on to be one of the most successful franchises in the NBA history by winning 16 NBA Championships. =Los Angeles Kings and Oakland Seals= Prior to the 1967‚Äì1968 season, the NHL expanded from its original six teams to twelve. Among the six new franchises were the Los Angeles Kings and Oakland Seals. The expansion into California was aided by entrepreneur and Los Angeles Lakers owner Jack Kent Cooke. Cooke, originally from Canada, wanted to bring his favorite sport to Los Angeles and was awarded a new franchise on February 9, 1966. As part of his plan to bring hockey to the West Coast, Cooke built The Great Western Forum, a new stadium which became home to both the Kings and Lakers. The Oakland Seals' time in California was short-lived. After entering the league in 1967, the team consistently had one of the worst records in the league. In 1976, the Seals relocated and became the Cleveland Barons.

It can refer to a wide variety of dipping sauces in Thai cuisine, with many of them a combination of salty, sweet, spicy and sour. Nam chim tend to be more watery in consistency than nam phrik (Thai chili pastes). Although Sriracha sauce is commonly known as sot Sriracha in Thailand (sot is the Thai pronunciation of the English word sauce), it is sometimes called nam chim Sriracha or nam phrik Sriracha. A more-or-less generic and basic nam chim is used for grilled or steamed seafood. This sauce contains garlic, fish sauce, sugar, lime juice, and bird's eye chilies. Variations on this basic recipe find their use as a dipping sauce with and as an integral part of many dishes. Many of the ingredients in a nam chim are finely chopped or pounded in a mortar and pestle or, non-traditionally, ground in a blender. Variants Popular dipping sauces in Thailand are: * Nam chim kai (), sweet chili sauce is a very common all-round chili dipping sauce with the consistency of a thick syrup. It is medium spicy and very sweet, normally referred to as \\"sweet Thai chili sauce\\" in English. It is often used as a dipping sauce for grilled chicken (kai yang). It can be used as a generic chili sauce for other dishes. It forms the base of a few other types of nam chim, such as nam chim thot man pla (\\"dipping sauce for deep-fried fish cakes\\"). * Nam chim chaeo (), using ground dry- roasted glutinous rice, this sauce is most often eaten with mu yang/mu ping (grilled pork) or kai yang (grilled chicken). * Nam chim sate () is the Thai version of peanut sauce; it is eaten with Thai satay. * Achat () is the Thai version of the Malay/Indonesian acar timun (cucumber pickles). The Thai variety consists of fresh chopped cucumber, spring onion and chili, mixed with vinegar. It is usually served with nam chim sate as a dip for satay. * Nam chim suki () is eaten with Thai suki (the Thai version of the Chinese hot pot) and [Mu Kratha]. The main ingredients are chili sauce, chili, garlic and sesame seeds. * Nam chim taochiao (), containing yellow soybean paste (taochiao), is eaten with khao man kai * Nam chim thale () ‚Äî a basic dipping sauce made with garlic, fish sauce, lime juice, sugar and chilis ‚Äî is usually eaten with grilled or steamed seafood. * Nam chim thot man (), served as a dip with thot man pla (fried fish cakes), is similar to nam chim kai but with chopped cucumber, crushed peanut and coriander (cilantro) leaves.

It was written and directed by series creator Neil Jordan and originally aired on April 3, 2011, as the second half of a 2-hour premiere. The episode deals with the aftermath and investigation into the murder of Cardinal Orsini, and the beginning of Cardinal della Rovere's plot to depose Alexander VI. Plot Immediately following the murder of Cardinal Orsini, Micheletto (Sean Harris) informs Cesare (Fran√ßois Arnaud) that there is also a plot against his family. They arrive at Cesare's home to save his mother and sister, Vannozza (Joanne Whalley) and Lucrezia (Holliday Grainger). Juan (David Oakes) arrives at the palace of Cardinal Orsini and directs his soldiers to arrest Orsini's household staff. Later, Cesare meets with his father, the Pope (Jeremy Irons) and Cardinal della Rovere (Colm Feore), who tells them Orsini was killed by poison. Soon after, Juan brings Micheletto into the room, having arrested him outside the gates. The Pope recognizes him as one of the servants pouring wine during the dinner, and Juan orders he be tortured for information. Before Juan can begin his interrogation, Cesare tells him that he will do it instead. Cesare tells Micheletto that he will release him, and to spy on Cardinal della Rovere. After briefly torturing Micheletto, Cesare discusses Orsini's murder with the Pope. Alexander tells Cesare that he is being made a Cardinal, and Cesare begs him to reconsider, and give him control of the Papal armies, but is denied again in favour of Juan. In addition, Alexander tells Cesare that he intends to find a husband for Lucrezia, in order to make an ally of an enemy. Meanwhile, Micheletto arrives at della Rovere's home, where he gains his trust by showing the Cardinal his wounded back. In the Vatican, the Pope hears the confession of Giulia Farnese (Lotte Verbeek), a noble woman in Rome. She confesses that she ended her pregnancy, a sin which \\"only the Pope can forgive\\". The Pope allows her to reside in Cardinal Orsini's now empty palace while she performs her penance. With the aid of Micheletto, Cardinal della Rovere assembles a large group of Cardinals and tells them of his plot to depose the Pope on accusation of corruption and simony. Unbeknownst to the Cardinals, Micheletto is eavesdropping on their conversation. Later, Micheletto brings Johannes Burchard (Simon McBurney) to della Rovere, who seeks his advice on deposing the Pope. The Deacon Cardinal tells della Rovere that the only way to depose and Pope is to prove public lechery. Meanwhile, the Pope makes use of a tunnel constructed by Cardinal Orsini, between his palace and the Vatican, has sex with Giulia Farnese, and commissions a painting of her. Lucrezia meets Giulia while she is being painted, and they quickly become friends. When Lucrezia tells her mother of her encounter with Giulia, and that the Pope had commissioned a painting of her, Vannozza meets with him the following day to accuse him of taking Farnese as his concubine. Micheletto meets with Cesare to report on what he overheard in della Rovere's home. Cesare informs the Pope of della Rovere's plot to depose him, but Alexander is prepared to overcome it. Micheletto speaks with a young maid working in Orsini's palace, who claims she witnessed the Pope entering Giulia's bedchamber. The Pope visits with Burchard to discuss expanding the College of Cardinals by 13, and puts him to work on finding a precedent for an expansion of that size. In another meeting of della Rovere's Cardinals, he tells them that they must prove the Pope's notorious and public lechery, and brings in the young maid to tell them what she witnessed. Micheletto reports the maid's story to Cesare, who tells him to kill her. Micheletto finds the young woman and has sex with her in an aggressive and callous manner before dispatching her. During Consistory, the Pope tells the College of Cardinals of his intentions to expand the College, which includes making Cesare a Cardinal. This is met by accusations of lechery by Cardinal della Rovere, who storms out of Consistory. He retires to his home, where he finds the young maid murdered on his bed.

It covers and has about of 1,100 animals. The only entrance is on Avenida Liberator. History The old zoo was established in 1903 as part of the project landscape architect Carlos Thays, who was also commissioned the design of the then West Park (now known as Parque General San Martin). Construction began the following year, during the government of Emilio Civit. The initial location of the project was to address the current school-home Eva Per√≥n. There he built a building that would be used as a cage for lions. Ponds and roads were also built later. The first animals arrived on May 18, 1903 donated by the city of Buenos Aires. The group included a zebu, 6 dogs, 6 guinea pigs, and many rabbits. New animals (also donated by the city of Buenos Aires) came in 1905 while construction work continued. This time, joined a lion, a bear, two monkeys, a chimpanzee, two parrots, and a blue jay. In 1939 he commissioned architect Daniel Ramos Correa relocation of the zoo. He devised an ambitious project to place it on the northeast slope of Cerro de la Gloria. Taking inspiration from various zoos around the world, the architect designed semi open enclosures that simulate natural habitats and enough space for animals, without bars or cages, just with different levels and building stone walls of the curvature of the hill. This never became fully effective, as during the construction itself included certain dangerous animals cages. The zoo was officially opened in 1941, covering and including of paths and roads. Mendoza Zoological Park received a great deal of attention from animal lovers, activists and ordinary people around the world when the zoo's only polar bear 'Arturo' ‚Äì known as the world's saddest polar bear ‚Äì dies on July, 2016, despite many attempts to free and relocate the bear to Canada.

Judge Mar√≠a Alejandra Mauricio granted Cecilia the status of 'legal person'. Since this was the first time an animal was granted this status, it caught the attention of biologist, philosopher, politicians and judges worldwide. Cecelia was send to a shelter for great apes.

The current minister is Evarist Bartolo. The ministry is headquartered at Palazzo Parisio, a historic building situated on Merchants Street in Valletta.http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2014-09-14/arts-and- culture/marie-benoits-diary-luncheon-at-the-ministry-of-foreign- affairs-6569197568/ History Malta attained full independence from the United Kingdom in 1964 and has maintained independent, official diplomatic relations with other nations since then. The ministry moved to its current location, within the Palazzo Parisio, in 1973, although the building itself was built in the 1700s and was once occupied by Napoleon Bonaparte during his Egyptian Campaign. The Palazzo Parisio has housed certain government operations starting in 1886 with Malta's General Post Office and, after World War I, the nation's Audit Office. Diplomacy The ministry oversees Malta's affairs with foreign entities, including bilateral relations with individual nations and its representation in international organizations, including the European Union, the United Nations and the Council of Europe. The ministry also holds responsibility for matters related to foreign trade, expatriates, citizenship and travel visas. The Holy See's apostolic nuncio is always listed first in Malta's Order of Precedence of foreign ambassadors and other heads of mission, regardless of the incumbent nuncio's time in office. The nuncio is then followed by a traditional precedence based on the foreign representatives' length of appointment. Several foreign missions to Malta, including those to large nations like Brazil and Japan, are accredited to it through embassies in Rome, Italy. There are no Maltese diplomatic missions physically located in South America. =Libya= In 2011 and 2012, the ministry was involved in international efforts to address the Libyan civil war, in part because of Malta's geographic proximity to Libya and the history of refugees and illegal immigrants leaving Libya for Malta. Refugee camps and the handling of matters of immigration and visitor status are the responsibility of the ministry. Foreign Minister Borg has called for Libya's Transitional National Council to accede to the Geneva Convention, something the African nation had not previously done under Muammar Gaddafi's regime.

R20 is a coalition of sub-national governments, private companies, international organizations, NGOs, and academic & financial institutions. Its mission is to accelerate sub- national infrastructure investments in the green economy to meaningfully contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The NGO operates at the sub-national level as R20 believes sub-national governments constitute a powerful force for change and are best positioned to take action & implement green projects. R20's efforts are designed to support sub-national governments around the world to develop and finance low-carbon and climate resilient infrastructure projects in the field of renewable energy, energy efficient lighting and waste optimisation. Mission and Methodology R20 founder Arnold Schwarzenegger speaks at the R20 AUSTRIAN WORLD SUMMIT 2017 in Vienna Founded on the principle that tackling climate change requires ‚ÄúLess talk, more action‚Äù, R20 works with a strong sense of immediacy to ensure that sub- national governments‚Äô ability to mitigate and adapt to climate change is unlocked. While sub-national governments (provinces, regions, cities, etc.) are at the center of R20's work, the NGO recognizes that fast-tracking the transition to inclusive, resilient and low-carbon societies requires greater mobilization and collaboration between a wide range of stakeholders. This is why R20's approach aims to ‚Äúconnect the dots‚Äù and foster understanding and interconnection between policy-makers, clean technology providers and public- private investors throughout the whole project development value chain. = An integrated approach to accelerate green infrastructure development and financing. = Through collaboration and with support from many partners, including the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, R20 has created a unique value chain approach that facilitates the identification, structuring, development (or bankability) and financing of green infrastructure projects. Sub-national governments from around the world can benefit from this unique one stop shop to improve the sustainability of their regions. #Project Identification: R20 works with sub-national governments and other networks of regions to identify potential green infrastructure projects and secure political support for their development. #Project Structuring: Together with Foundations and academic institutions, R20 conducts workshops and training programs to facilitate the structuring and design of projects identified. #Project Bankability: R20 works with its corporate partners to help project developers perform feasibility studies and ensure bankability of projects. #Project Financing: R20 works with Foundations and Impact Fund Managers to provide and attract investment capital to fund project implementation. #Project MRV: R20 works with MRV standards and implementer to Measure, Report and Verify projects contributions to GHG emission reduction and impact towards the SDGs. Governance Board Since June 2017, R20 consists of R20 - Regions of Climate Action (Association) and the R20 Foundation, which work as two complementary entities. The Association carries out day-to-day operational duties, and the Foundation manages important investment decisions. = R20 - Regions of Climate Action (Association) = The R20 Association is legally structured as a Swiss association. On behalf of the General Assembly of Members, the Governing Board carries out all acts that further the purpose of the organization and is responsible for managing the organization's business. The Founding Chair of the Association is Arnold Schwarzenegger. The current President is Magnus Berntsson ‚Äì President of the Regional Council of V√§stra G√∂taland and President of the AER (Assembly of European Regions) and The Strategic Advisor to the Founding Chair is Terry Tamminen, CEO of the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation and the former Secretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency. The R20 Executive Director is Dr. Christophe Nuttall, former Director of the Hub for Innovative Partnerships at the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). = R20 Foundation = The R20 Foundation is the entity responsible for almost all aspects of funding of the R20 Association and its operations. It was created at the request of a number of investors interested to invest in the R20 ecosystem of blended finance. With a Board of Directors composed of green finance leaders, the R20 Foundation meets the demands of development banks, sovereign funds, private bans, private equities, family offices and pension funds. The current Board is composed of Armand Jost, Founder and CEO of SB3i (Chairman), Dr. Patrick Scheurle, CEO of BlueOrchard Finance Ltd., Craig Cogut, Chairman and President of Pegasus Capital Advisors, Dr. Andreas Mattner, Chairman of the Executive Committee, ¬´Lebendige Stadt¬ª Foundation, Terry Tamminen, CEO of the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, Chrisophe Dossarps, CEO of the Sustainable Infrastructure Foundation and Dr. Frannie L√©autier, Founder and Managing partner of Ezembat Group. R20 is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland and benefits from a unique concentration of International Organizations, Financial institutions, NGOs and Academia that the NGO can work with to further its mission. To facilitate and bring together local authorities, technology providers and investors, R20 works with regional offices installed around the world: Austria (Vienna), France (Paris), USA (Santa Monica), Algeria (Oran), and Brazil (Rio de Janeiro). As of November 2016, R20 has 49 direct members (both national & sub-national authorities) and 134 businesses and project facilitators (academic institutions, national agencies, NGOs, private companies, UN programs and Intergovernmental organizations), and 41 investors and financial institutions.  History  During his tenure as Governor of the State of California from 2003 to 2011, Arnold Schwarzenegger was responsible for signing into law groundbreaking legislation that translated the Kyoto Protocol into Californian law. This and other initiatives is what led President Obama to ask Governor Schwarzenegger to obtain similar commitments from thirty other US States. A. Schwarzenegger's success in implementing action at the sub-national level, and his ability to demonstrate the potential to scale this impact by replication at the sub- national level is ultimately what gave birth to the R20 Regions of Climate Action. In December 2009, after evaluating the failure of the COP15 to agree on the practical means to limit carbon emissions, Gov. Schwarzenegger, with the support from the UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon, decided to create a new coalition of Regions committed to action. He met with a number of heads of regions, including Governor Uduaghan from Delta State, Nigeria, President Charet from the Province of Quebec, Canada, President Huchon and Vice President Mich√®le Sabban from Region Ile de France, and 17 other representatives from other Regions, who all decided to create R20 Regions of Climate Action. In September 2010, Governor Schwarzenegger organized the Third Global Governors Climate Summit in Sacramento and launched the R20 Charter, which was signed by representatives of Regions, national governments, NGOs, foundations, private companies and finance institutions. In September 2011, the First constitutive General Assembly of R20 marked the official creation of the NGO. Linda Adam, The California Environmental Protection Agency State Secretary, was officially elected President of the R20 Board and Terry Tamminen was nominated as R20 Special Advisor to Governor Schwarzenegger, the Honorary Founding Chair of R20. In January 2012, Dr. Christophe Nuttall, Director of the UNDP Hub for Innovative Partnership, officially joined R20 as Executive Director. From 2013 to 2017, Mich√®le Sabban took on the R20 presidency. In June 2017, Magnus Berntsson, President of the Regional Council of V√§stra G√∂taland and President of AER, was elected as the new R20 president.

He also played Minor counties cricket for Bedfordshire and Shropshire. He was born at Henlow, Bedfordshire and educated at Bedford Modern School.\\"The Eagle\\", Bedford Modern School, Commemorative Edition 1974 Watts was a left-handed lower middle order batsman and a right-arm leg-break and googly bowler who played at a time when leg-spin was very much out of favour in English county cricket. He was also a fine fieldsman, taking 174 catches in his 183 first-class matches. He is the elder brother of Jim Watts, who played alongside him for Northamptonshire as a left-handed middle order batsman and right-arm medium-pace bowler and who was also later a successful captain of the team. Cricket career Having played Minor Counties cricket for Bedfordshire since 1955 and for Northamptonshire's second eleven since 1956, Peter Watts made his first-class debut in 1958 in a couple of matches and then played in almost half the county's games in 1959, though his bowling opportunities were limited by Northamptonshire's reliance on the two Australian spin bowlers, George Tribe, who retired at the end of the 1959 season, and Jack Manning. In fact, in his first match of the season, against Warwickshire, he was the fourth spin bowler called on after Tribe, Manning and slow left-arm spinner Michael Allen, but took five wickets for just 30 runs, all five wickets coming in a spell of 53 balls at a cost of just 10 runs. He improved on these bowling figures in the match against Cambridge University with six second innings wickets for 73 runs and he also made his maiden 50 in this game. Watts played in about a half of Northamptonshire's first-class matches in 1959, 1960 and 1961, taking between 30 and 40 wickets in each season and contributing useful lower order runs without ever cementing his place in the side. In 1962, however, he played regularly and his tally of wickets advanced to 59. These figures included the most successful bowling figures of his first-class career: in the game against Hampshire at Dean Park, Bournemouth, he took six for 63 in the first innings and seven for 77 in the second, achieving both his best match and innings figures in the same game. Watts had a poor season in 1963 and was omitted from the side in the second half of the season. He returned to regular cricket in 1964, however, and with 788 runs and 64 wickets had his best all-round season; he also took 36 catches. Against Derbyshire he made an unbeaten 88, batting at No 8. In the next game, against Worcestershire, he was promoted to bat at No 3 and made 91, and this was to be his highest first-class score. In that match against Worcestershire, however, other spin bowlers Malcolm Scott and David Steele bowled 35 overs each in Worcestershire's first innings, while Watts bowled only three. The following season, 1965, that was increasingly the pattern: Watts was played largely for his useful batting and his number of overs bowled and his total of wickets both more than halved. In some compensation, he scored 852 runs at an average of 25.81, with six half-centuries, though the highest was just 64. In 1966, however, Mushtaq Mohammad was available for County Championship cricket for Northamptonshire as a high-class batsman and leg-break and googly bowler; Watts played until early June, but then was dropped to the second eleven and left the county at the end of the season. He was registered in 1967 by Nottinghamshire and played regularly in that season, but both his batting and his bowling were less successful, and he left the county after a single season, and did not play first-class or limited-overs cricket again. In 1969, Watts played a few Minor Counties matches for Shropshire and he returned to his home county of Bedfordshire for a single final game in 1971.

It was originally released in November 1982, and was her first and only release by the record label, Polydor. The album was recorded over a period of four months at The Studio Toppersfield, in Essex, England with the sessions starting in late 1981, and ending in early 1982. The album is generally regarded as the culmination of the smoother, more adult-oriented sound of Quatro's later work. The album is notably Quatro's only studio album not to contain any cover versions of songs by other artists. However, she did have a hand in composing each track, with the exception of the sixth track \\"Two Miles Out of Georgia\\", which was solely written by Chris Andrews. The album was her last recording of original material for four years, until she released Annie Get Your Gun ‚Äì 1986 London Cast, and it was her last studio album of the 1980s and her last studio album for eight years, until she released Oh Suzi Q., in 1990. It was released at the height of the popularity of the new wave music movement. \\"Heart of Stone\\" received some airplay on Album-oriented rock radio, and was released as a lead single from the album and became a moderate success, peaking at number 60 on the UK charts.http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/suzi%20quatro/ And the title track was also released as a single, but unlike the aforementioned single it failed to chart. The album was received negatively by the majority of music critics, with most of the criticism being directed towards its musical direction being too commercial from her hard rock roots. The album went largely unnoticed by the public, being a commercial disappointment, and even missed the album charts worldwide (her first studio album to do so). The album was re-released in 2008, and was the first of several remastered reissues by Cherry Red Records on Compact Disc. It contained the single version of \\"Heart of Stone\\" as a bonus track. Cherry Red have since released other Quatro remasters, as well as releasing her latest studio album, In the Spotlight. Critical reception In a retrospective review for AllMusic, critic Jim Allen wrote of the album \\"a few tracks are melodic, acoustic-based, Juice Newton-sounding tunes; a few explore new wave/electro-dance production touches; and for the faithful, there are a couple of rockers in the classic Quatro mode.\\" And they added that \\"[the album is] Clearly a portrait of an artist in motion.\\" Track listing Personnel Credits are adapted from the album's liner notes. *Suzi Quatro \\\\- lead vocals, bass guitar, backing vocals *Len Tuckey \\\\- acoustic guitar, electric guitar, guitar synthesizer, backing vocals, producer *Dave Neal \\\\- drums, percussion *Chris Andrews \\\\- keyboards, backing vocals, producer *Jimmy Martin \\\\- steel guitar on \\"Two Miles Out of Georgia\\" *Wendy Roberts \\\\- backing vocals on \\"Heart of Stone\\" References External links * Category:1982 albums Category:Suzi Quatro albums Category:Polydor Records albums Category:Cherry Red Records albums Category:New wave albums by American artists ","title":"Main Attraction (album)"},{"id":"35701137","text":"The 2010‚Äì11 season was Alloa Athletic's eighth consecutive season in the Scottish Second Division, having been relegated from the Scottish First Division at the end of season 2002‚Äì03.

His combination of objects with texture, water paints, photographs, UV-cured inks and even computer software all contribute to Taj's signature style. Early life and education Parvez Taj was born and raised in Amherst, Nova Scotia. His father, a doctor, was from Rajasthan, Indian while his mother, a lawyer, was from London, England. For five years of his education, he attended boarding school at Ridley College, St. Catharines, Ontario. He then attended the University of Western Ontario in London, Ontario, where he earned a Bachelor's degree in economics and finance in 1999.2010 Homecoming Attendees (accessed 6 February 2012) During his summer vacations, Taj began serving as an intern in New York's corporate fashion houses for Calvin Klein and Hugo Boss where he learned the flow of sales cycles, seasonal trends and product lines. After graduating, Taj moved to New York City where he privately worked on his artworks while publicly producing fashion shows, events and photo shoots for Colin Cowie and Antony Todd. As head of production for these notable designers, Taj learned to take a design from concept to reality and to manage time/budget constraints. Taj then traveled to India for a year to shoot a documentary for a nonprofit organization.Spacify.com  Parvez Taj  Parvez Michael  Modern Wall Art (accessed 6 February 2012) The documentary was used to educate donors on the use of funding and was shown at the World Social Forum 2002 in Porto Alegre, Brazil. In his free time, Taj honed his craft in video and wall art which laid the groundwork for his later career as an artist. Continuing his education the following year, Taj earned his MBA degree from Pepperdine University in Malibu, California where he majored in entrepreneurship. There he learned the fundamentals of running a business and how to bring a product to market. During this time, he further defined his style creating and selling his art to private investors while setting up his company as an LLC. For his summer internship, Taj traveled to Hong Kong and Indonesia where he exclusively focused on his arts, selling several pieces to local collectors. In his final year at Pepperdine, Taj won first place in the Pepperdine Business Plan competition. He used these proceeds to launch his business and career as an artist/designer after graduation. Career Parvez began his artistic career in 1999 after attending an art show in London, Ontario, Canada. The artist, Phil Rubinoff, was blending photography with a technology that had never before existed and Taj, a passionate photographer, thought this would be a fun medium to explore. This hobby quickly became his favorite pastime and within four years became his full-time career. Taj's distinct technique has evolved from mixing just photography to layering photographs with paints, and from printing on canvas to printing on such diverse mediums such as aluminum, reclaimed white barn siding and other exotic substrates. Since 1999, he has produced over 1,000 works. In addition, he has been working with video as an art medium for over 10 years producing 36 shorts, one documentary and currently, content using 3D video production technology. In 2003, Taj founded Parvez Michel, Inc. in Beverly Hills, CA. In addition to paintings, Taj has produced furniture light fixtures, acrylic boxes and ping-pong tables.Parvez Taj Product (accessed 6 February 2012) Taj Parvez's artwork can be seen in retail outlets such as Gilt Groupe,Parvez Taj - Artwork - Gilt Home Wayfair,Parvez Taj Wall Art  Accent Furniture Direct (accessed 6 February 2012) Spacify and Design Public.Design Public - Parvez Taj (accessed 6 February 2012) Additionally, his pieces have been featured in W Magazine, Residential Architect, InteriorDesign, Luxury Activist, Materialicious, and Inhabit.com.

It forms a range with the Duluth South Breakwater Outer Light to guide ships into the canal from Lake Superior. The current structure was built from 1900 to 1901. History The original configuration of the breakwaters was graced by a tower on the south side of the lake entrance in 1874, shortly after the canal was constructed. Requests for funds to construct a corresponding light on the inner end of the breakwater were made beginning in 1880, but an appropriation was not made until 1889. Construction proceeded quickly on an open wooden pyramidal tower surmounted by a watch room and iron lantern, the latter housing a fourth-order Fresnel lens which rotated to provide a six- second flash; the light was first displayed in September 1 of that year. On the 17th, the India struck the end of the breakwater, but the damage to the light was minor and quickly repaired. The first rear light circa 1893 The reconstruction of the canal as part of the 1896 harbor upgrade forced rearrangement and replacement of the lights. The south breakwater was rebuilt with concrete piers from 1898 to 1900 and, upon completion, temporary lights were erected while new permanent lights were built. A new rear tower was constructed, standing at the edge of the pier near the lake shore. This structure, a square three-stage skeletal pyramid with a central cylindrical enclosed staircase, was originally painted white with a black lantern and watchroom; at some point, however, the color scheme was reversed to the current black tower and white lantern. The original lens was reused, but was replaced with a modern acrylic flasher in 1995 when it was found in need of repair. The lens was given to the Lake Superior Maritime Visitor Center, where it was restored and put on display. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Duluth South Breakwater Inner (Duluth Range Rear) Lighthouse in 1983 for its local significance in the themes of commerce, engineering, and transportation. It was nominated for being one of the federal navigation aids essential to the development of the Great Lakes as the nation's most important transportation system in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The light remains in service, but in 2008 the tower was sold at auction to a pair of Duluth residents after an offer to donate it to educational or non-profit organizations found no takers.

Phonetics Chart of yotsugana pronunciation. The green zone including most of Tohoku region means that the four yotsugana sounds have completely merged, as zi = di = zu = du. A notable linguistic feature of the T≈çhoku dialect is its neutralization of the high vowels \\"i\\" and \\"u\\" (Standard and ), so that the words sushi, susu ('soot'), and shishi ('lion') are rendered homophonous, where they would have been distinct in other dialects. In light of this, T≈çhoku dialect is sometimes referred to as Z≈´z≈´-ben. The vowels tend to be neutralized to in Northern Tohoku dialect and in Southern Tohoku dialect. In addition, all unvoiced stops become voiced intervocalically, rendering the pronunciation of the word kato ('trained rabbit') as . However, unlike the high-vowel neutralization, this does not result in new homophones, as all voiced stops are prenasalized, meaning that the word kado ('corner') is pronounced . This is particularly noticeable with , which is nasalized fully to with the stop of the hard \\"g\\" almost entirely lost, so that ichigo 'strawberry' is pronounced . Standard Japanese can do this with too (see Japanese phonology), but not with the other stops.

A history of the Japanese language. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. . p. 36 Grammar In grammar, a volitional and presumptive suffix -be or -ppe is widely used in the region. It is a transformation of -beki, a conjugated form of an archaic suffix -beshi. Since the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami, a slogan Ganbappe! (\\"Let's buckle down!\\") has often been used in the disaster area. A directional particle sa is also widely used in the region.

In particular, the ECI looks to explain the knowledge accumulated in a population and that is expressed in the economic activities present in a city, country, or region. To achieve this goal, the ECI defines the knowledge available in a location, as the average knowledge of the activities present in it, and the knowledge of an activity as the average knowledge of the places where that economic activity is conducted. The product equivalent of the Economic Complexity Index is the Product Complexity Index or PCI. Economic complexity index for Iran (1964‚Äì2014)  Background  The ECI was developed by Cesar A. Hidalgo, from the MIT Media Lab and Ricardo Hausmann, from Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government. ECI data is available in The Observatory of Economic Complexity. The original formulation of the Economic Complexity Index was published in PNAS in 2009.  Formulation  In its strict mathematical definition, the ECI is defined in terms of an eigenvector of a matrix connecting countries to countries, which is a projection of the matrix connecting countries to the products they export. Since the ECI considers information on the diversity of countries and the ubiquity of products, it is able to produce a measure of economic complexity containing information about both the diversity of a country's export and their sophistication. For example, Japan or Germany, with high ECIs, export many goods that are of low ubiquity and that are produced by highly diversified countries, indicating that these are diverse and sophisticated economies. Countries with low ECI, like Angola or Zambia, export only a few products, which are of relatively high ubiquity and which are exported by countries that are not necessarily very diversified, indicating that these are countries that have little diversity and that the products that they export are not very sophisticated.  Utility  Hidalgo and Hausmann propose the concept of ECI not only as a descriptive measure, but also as a predictive tool for economic growth and income inequality. According to the statistics models presented in their Atlas of Economic Complexity (2011), the ECI is a more accurate predictor of GDP per capita growth than traditional measures of governance, competitiveness (World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index) and human capital (as measured in terms of educational attainment). ECI also shows a strong negative correlation with income inequality, suggesting that more knowledge intense productive structures are more inclusive in terms of income distribution, and providing a statistically more powerful explanation of cross-national variations in income inequality than Kuznets Curve.

Jacksonville. By Charlie Patton, Feb 20, 2012 specializing in microsurgical neuroanatomy. He developed and introduced a number of microsurgical techniques that improved the safety and effectiveness of neurosurgery, including the use of the surgical microscope in neurosurgery.\\"3D brain maps guide doctors ‚Äî via iPhone\\".Fox News He also designed many of the commonly used of microneurosurgical instruments, which bear his name. Such tools in use worldwide include the Rhoton Micro Dissectors designed for delicate work in the treatment of brain aneurysms and tumor resection. A pioneer in the field of neuroanatomy, Rhoton was a leader in vastly expanding knowledge of the anatomy of the human brain. His microscopic studies using the surgical microscope mapped the brain's intricate blood vessel network and revealed previously unknown connections between vital centers of the brain. At the University of Florida, he built the world's largest collection of three-dimensional images of the brain and published the world's best selling neurosurgical textbook, Cranial Anatomy and Surgical Approaches, both of which serve as guides for neurosurgeons across the globe. He is internationally recognized as the \\"father of microscopic neurosurgery\\" for his neuroanatomical studies which provided the anatomic basis for the development of modern neurosurgical techniques and revolutionized surgical approaches to many neurological disorders including those for acoustic neuromas and skull base tumors. Early life and education Rhoton was born on November 18, 1932, in Parvin, Kentucky. He grew up in a log cabin without plumbing or electricity in rural eastern Kentucky. His family moved to Akron, Ohio during the Second World War where his father was a rubber chemist. He graduated from the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis in 1959 and then completed two years of training at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York City, one year in general surgery and the other in neurological surgery. He returned to Washington University and completed his neurosurgery residency at Barnes Hospital under Dr. Henry Schwartz in 1964. He remained at Washington University for a one-year National Institutes of Health research fellowship in neuroanatomy during which time he began to use the surgical microscope in his research work and realized its potential to revolutionize surgery and also take brain anatomy to a greater level of detail. Medical and academic career Rhoton began as a staff neurosurgeon at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, in 1966. He joined the University of Florida in 1972 as a Professor of Surgery and the Chairman of the Department of Neurological Surgery. He became the R.D. Keene Family Professor of Neurosurgery in 1981. In 2014 Rhoton was the director of the Neuro- Microanatomy Lab at the McKnight Brain Institute. Rhoton died in Gainesville, Florida, on February 21, 2016, at the age of 83. Professional activities Rhoton served as the President of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons, the Congress of Neurological Surgeons, the Society of Neurological Surgeons, the North American Skull Base Society, the International Interdisciplinary Congress on Craniofacial and Skull Base Surgery, the Florida Neurosurgical Society, and the International Society for Neurosurgical Technology and Instrument Invention. He served as the honored guest or was elected to honorary membership in more than 20 neurosurgical societies throughout Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, and North and South America.

Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. .Lowrie, A. 2013. Carnivorous Plants of Australia Magnum Opus - Volume Three. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. . Content The first volume deals exclusively with tuberous sundews (genus Drosera). The second is devoted to pygmy sundews, but also includes three tuberous species described since the publication of the first volume, as well as two other sundews that do not fit elsewhere (D. glanduligera and D. hamiltonii). The final volume includes the remaining sundews of Australia, together with native species of Aldrovanda, Byblis, Cephalotus, Nepenthes, and Utricularia. Each species is given a four-page treatment, with one page for a botanical description, one for a line drawing of the author's creation, one for a distribution map, and one for assorted colour photographs. Reviews =Volume 1= Martin Cheek reviewed the first volume for the March 1988 issue of the Carnivorous Plant Newsletter (CPN). He compared it to Neville Graeme Marchant and Alex George's 1982 treatment of tuberous sundews in Flora Australia (F.A.):Cheek, M. 1988. Carnivorous Plants of Australia: Volume One. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 17(1): 27. > Each plant is very clearly described in a page of text followed by a few > interesting paragraphs on its most outstanding features and how to tell it > apart from its closest relatives. There follows a full plate of the most > superb drawings, far better, more beautiful and comprehensive than the F.A., > a distribution map (needless to say, ten times better than F.A.) and > outstanding colour plates showing, separately, habit and habitat and a > close-up of the flowers. Cheek identified a number of \\"[m]inor errors\\" in the text, including the species keys and glossary, but wrote that \\"we must not be over critical\\". He concluded: \\"This book is essential reading as the major reference work on Australian tuberous sundews: buy it.\\" =Volume 2= The second volume was reviewed by Donald Schnell in the March‚ÄìJune 1990 issue of the CPN:Schnell, D. 1990. Special book review. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 19(1‚Äì2): 49‚Äì50. > The descriptions are all excellent, as are the line drawings and range maps. > The photos are true to color, sharply printed, and for the most part show > what they are intended to. Schnell suggested that some of the book's smaller images would benefit from enlargement, finding certain morphological details difficult to discern. He added that \\"some might question\\" the inclusion of many undescribed taxa and several newly described species of tuberous sundews, the latter appearing somewhat out-of-place in a book otherwise devoted to pygmy sundews. Martin Cheek provided a more in-depth review of volume 2 for the September‚ÄìDecember 1990 issue of the CPN.Cheek, M. 1990. Carnivorous Plants of Australia: Volume Two. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 19(3‚Äì4): 82‚Äì84. He wrote that the book puts all other works on pygmy sundews \\"into the shade\\", with comprehensive treatment of every species known at the time. Minor criticisms included the \\"woolliness\\" of certain glossary definitions (which \\"has unfortunate consequences in the descriptions that follow\\"), issues with the main key, a lack of ranges for many measurements, truncated peduncles in some line drawings, and no mention of bract morphology in the species descriptions. More serious criticism was levelled at the inclusion of numerous informally named taxa and at Lowrie's reliance on original descriptions (without examination of type material) in making certain taxonomic determinations, particularly with respect to the confused D. omissa. Cheek also added: \\"For the grower of pygmy Drosera, a major disappointment is that the numerous cultivar names that so many pygmy sundew species, of direct wild origin, have been traded under for 10 years or more [...] are not accounted for, nor mentioned anywhere in the text.\\" Summarising, Cheek wrote: > Even in view of the reservations expressed above, the keys, descriptions, > maps and illustrations are vastly superior to those of previous authors. The > works of Erickson and Marchant & George must now be considered completely > out-of-date. =Volume 3= Barry Rice gave a positive appraisal of the third volume in the September 1999 issue of the CPN, writing: \\"If you are interested at all in Australian carnivorous plants you should buy this book!\\".Meyers-Rice, B. 1999. Book review. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 28(3): 98. He continued: > The descriptive text sections are good and the botanical drawings are well > executed and clear, although many of the plates have much blank space that > could have been used for additional sketches. (For example, Lowrie > unfortunately did not include gemmae sketches for the new pygmy sundews.) > The photography is excellent‚Äîas in his first two volumes Lowrie skillfully > uses depth-of-field and background choices to highlight the plants. The > addition of microphotographs is welcome. Rice wrote that the range maps \\"are fine, although not particularly detailed\\" and considered the alphabetical arrangement of species, which differed from the first two volumes, \\"inconvenient\\" at times. Rice pointed out the omission of many Utricularia species (\\"only nineteen species are described, even though more than fifty species occur in Australia\\") and felt that the four-pages-per- species format was inadequate for treating some of the more \\"complicated taxa\\", like D. binata, U. dichotoma, and especially D. peltata (of which \\"only the Western Australia type was ever mentioned\\"‚Äîin the first volume).

Carnival Carnival 'Royalty' in Port-au-Prince Port-au- Prince's annual carnival is one of the largest Mardi Gras carnivals in the Caribbean and North America. The celebrations are funded by the government, businesses and wealthy Haitian families. Haiti's version of carnival season always starts in January, known as Pre-Kanaval, and the main carnival begins in February each year. Carnival celebrations end on Mardi Gras, which is French for Fat Tuesday, also known as Shrove Tuesday. Mardi Gras is the Tuesday before the Roman Catholic holiday known as Ash Wednesday. Ash Wednesday marks the beginning of the Lenten season, a somber period of fasting and penance that precedes Easter for Catholics. The first Mardi Gras celebrations in Europe were a carnivalesque opportunity for people to indulge themselves, celebrate, and even subvert authority in a permissible way, as part of the party. Mardi Gras enabled people to enjoy the pleasures of life before the beginning of the Catholic Lent season, a period of 40 days and nights of fasting and penance leading up to Easter. The Catholic festival was imported to Haiti and elsewhere in the Americas during European settlement. In Haiti, carnival is also heavily influenced by local customs, such as Vodou religious rituals, and Haitian music. thumb The carnival is celebrated with music, bands and parades. Parades have floats, sometimes with children participating in the celebrations. The floats typically have sound systems set up on trucks to play music to the crowds. Food stands selling barbecued treats and rum are a popular part of celebrations. There are also comedy plays put on by the carnival participants, often satirizing political topics. Revelers wear masks and costumes, as they do at other carnival celebrations in the Caribbean, North America, and Central and South America. The parades makes their way through the streets of Port-au-Prince and end with celebrations at the large plaza, Champ de Mars, located across from the Palais national (National Palace), the former residence of Haiti's president. Music is central to Haiti's carnival. Musicians perform zouk, rap krey√≤l rap, konpa (Compas), and mizik rasin. The carnival is the largest annual event where bands can gain more public exposure and it provides the opportunity to perform at large concerts. Popular kompa bands participate in the carnival, such as T-Vice, Djakout No. 1, Sweet Micky also known as Michel Martelly, Krey√≤l La, D.P. Express, Mizik Mizik, Ram, T-Micky, Team Lobey, Carimi, and Scorpio Fever who perform for dancers in the streets of Champ de Mars. In Haiti there are also competitions between some bands, like T-Vice, Djakout No. 1, Krey√≤l La, Team Lobey, and Krezi Mizik. Every year, tourists travel to Haiti's carnival to enjoy it. History Carnival masks made of papier-m√¢ch√© being prepared in Jacmel, 2002. The large official public celebration of carnival in Haiti started in 1804 in the capital of Haiti, Port-au-Prince. Carnival celebrations were traditionally considered \\"sinful\\" to Protestant Haitians, who were advised by their ministers not to participate. The celebrations were criticized for condoning sexually-suggestive dancing, profanity-filled plays, music lyrics mocking authority, and Vodou and kompa music rhythms. In 1998, during first and second day of the Carnival, Manno Charlemagne, the newly elected Fanmi Lavalas mayor of Port-au-Prince, sent armed men to the Oloffson to dismantle the float on which RAM was scheduled to perform in the annual Carnival 1998, which was known to be the best Carnival organized since 1985. The mayor had taken offense to the lyrics of one of the band's songs, which he interpreted as an accusation of corruption. In a compromise, the band was allowed to perform on a flatbed truck. However, the brakes on the truck were sabotaged and during the procession, the truck swerved into the crowd, killing eight and forcing the members of the band to flee for their lives. Celebrations were greatly curtailed by the 2010 Haiti earthquake, although they still took place on a much-reduced scale, with only one quarter of the usual budget. There was disagreement among Haitians about whether or not it was appropriate to have the carnival at all in early 2011. The 2011 carnival featured many costumed performers satirizing darker themes than usual, such as the post-earthquake cholera epidemic and the need for humanitarian relief. In 2012, the carnival was held on a larger scale and was a success. In 2015, celebrations were cancelled nationwide after the second day due to an accident during the defile that claimed the lives of 18 people and injured 78 more. Creole carnival expressions Haitian Creole, largely based on the French vocabulary, with influences from African, Spanish, Portuguese and Carib languages, has a variety of expressions associated with its carnival celebrations. Its celebrations give revelers an opportunity to throw away their inhibitions, and the expressions encourage this: * lage k√≤ w: 'let go of yourself' * mete men n' anl√®: 'put your hands in the air' * balanse: 'sway' * bobinen: 'spin' * souke: 'shake' * sote: 'jump up' * gouye: 'grind your hips' * vole: 'jump up' Musicians from the Haitian diaspora in New York City and elsewhere often return to Haiti to perform at the carnival. There are also one-on-one fights between young men during the festivities. These are called gagann. Combatants are surrounded by a semi-circle of supporters. Rara Haiti has a unique traditional carnival, Rara, that is separate from the main pre-Lent carnival celebrations. Rara processions take place during the day and sometimes at night during Lent, then culminate in a week-long celebration that takes place at the end of Lent, during the Catholic 'Holy Week', which includes the Easter holiday. Rara has its roots in Haiti's an dey√≤ areas, the rural areas around Port-au-Prince. It is based on peasant Easter celebration customs. Rara celebrations include parades with musicians playing drums, tin trumpets, bamboo horns called vaksens, and other instruments. Parades also include dancers and costumed characters such as Queens (called renns), Presidents, Colonels, and other representatives of a complex rara band hierarchy, similar to the krewe organization of New Orleans Mardi Gras bands. Rara is called \\"Vodou taken on the road\\" by Haitians. Processions of female dancers follow male Vodou religious leaders, accompanied by drummers and vaksen bands, stopping at crossroads, cemeteries, and the homes of community leaders. Rara rituals are public acknowledgements of the power of local \\"big men\\" in the communities. Money is given to the leaders of rara organizations and communities during processions. The incorporation of military costumes and dance steps in rara processions is also an acknowledgement of the community hierarchy, and the folk belief that Vodou rituals, including rara, supported the success of the Haitian Revolution, and the continued well-being of Haiti. Rara band members believe that they have made a contract with spirits, and must perform for 18 years if not the sprits grow upset with them ad they will suffer a really slow painful death. Carnaval des Fleurs Michel Martelly organized another carnival 29‚Äì31 July 2012 called Carnaval des Fleurs (Flower Carnival). This event included popular local konpa bands. This event supposedly originated in earlier times, but no such Carnival celebration had been held since (at least) the transition to democracy in 1986. Koudyay Koudyay is a type of spontaneous celebration in Haiti, similar to a carnival celebration. During Haiti's years under the dictatorship of Papa Doc Duvalier, the government sponsored koudyaye festivities as a means to distract the people of Haiti from economic and political problems, and to give a limited, sanctioned way for people to release frustrations and avert rioting. Kompa carnival bands Carnival is an important commercial event for Haitian musicians. Musicians have an opportunity to expand their audience by performing for crowds during the 3 days prior to Ash Wednesday. While Carnival bands can integrate many styles of music, compas is a common form used. In Haitian Creole, it is spelled konpa, though it is commonly spelling \\"kompa\\".

They are often mistaken for wolf spiders (Lycosidae) due to their physical resemblance. Pisaurina mira is distinguished by its unique eye arrangement of two rows. P. mira is found all along the eastern seaboard of the United States and west to Texas, Nebraska, and Wisconsin, as well as in Canada. They typically inhabit fields, meadows, and woods, as well as tall grass, shrubs, and bushes. Because of their carnivorous diet, P. mira is known to have an impact on the herbivore population in crops. They are categorized as \\"sit-and-wait ambush predators\\" that wait for prey to come within reach and snatch them using their chelicerae (clawlike pincers). P. mira is most well known for their sexually cannibalistic behavior and their extensive use of silk web in mating. Prior to copulation, the male binds the female's legs with his silk to avoid being consumed by the female. This silk use for survival has been found to increase P. mira males' reproductive fitness, as they typically engage in mating with multiple females when unmanipulated. P. mira males' unique \\"bondage\\" system using silk during mating is certainly a noteworthy behavior and requires further research. Like other members of the Pisauridae, Pisaurina mira carries its eggs along with it in a sac that is secured both by a thread of silk linking it to the spider's spinnerets and by being held by the spider's chelicerae. When the eggs are nearly ready to hatch the mother will build a nursery web within which the egg sac is then hung. After they hatch, and until they undergo their first molt, the infant spiders will inhabit the rather large volume enclosed by this nursery web. The mother spider will station herself nearby in order to defend the nursery. The responsibility of parental care is solely given to the female, as males who survive the sexually cannibalistic female during mating depart to mate with more females. Although the venom of P. mira is enough to kill its prey, which are usually small insects, it is insufficient for any lethal damage to bigger animals or humans. Anterior view demonstrating the typical eye pattern  Description  Pisaurina mira, commonly referred to as the nursery web spiders, share the same build as seen in most spiders: cephalothorax (combined head and thorax region) and an unsegmented abdomen region. The cephalothorax is responsible for outer protection with a hard layer called the carapace, and the abdomen contains key organ systems such as the heart, silk glands, and reproductive systems. Nursery web spiders are often mistaken for wolf spiders due to very similar appearances. While both male and female nursery web spiders both share the yellowish-brown color, the size of male nursery web spiders fall in a greater range of 9 to 15 mm, whereas the females are typically between 12 and 15 mm in length. However, the male spiders generally have longer legs and a larger leg length to body ratio than females. Some spiders may have a brownish band down the middle of the back, as well as a white border around the abdomen. Pisaurina mira is distinguished from the rest of the Pisauridae family with its unique eye pattern. P. mira has eight eyes that are arranged in two rows: four eyes in the front are in a straight line, and four eyes in the back form a U-shape.  Habitat  Nursery web spiders are wandering hunters. They are usually found on vegetation or at water margins throughout North America. Pisaurina mira is usually seen in the woods and meadows, but it is most populated in the transitional areas between woods and fields. They inhabit tall grass, shrubs, and bushes, which gives them an advantage considering their hunting strategy, which is waiting for prey to come within their reach and using their pincers (\\"sit-and-wait ambush predator\\") They stand as one of the most common spiders in the eastern United States. = Geographic range = Nursery web spiders are found in Western and Southern Europe, as well as some regions in Canada, such as Ontario, Quebec, and Nova Scotia. In the United States, they are found in Florida, west to Texas, and north to Kansas and Minnesota.  Diet  Pisaurina mira are active hunters. Instead of setting up a spider web to passively wait for prey, the most significant silk use in P. mira is centered around the mating behavior. In order to obtain food, the nursery web spiders wander around, hunting for insects such as gnats and mosquitoes. They use their chelicerae to grab the prey. While P. mira's venom is not lethal, it injects digestive juices into their prey and liquifies the prey's internal organs. The vast majority of nutritional intake for the nursery web spiders come from this soup of liquified organs. = Heat tolerance = Compared to the wolf spider (Tigrosa helluo), a species that is often considered similar to the nursery web spiders, P. mira exhibits lower heat tolerance (critical thermal maxima parameter (CTM50) = 34¬∫C). In other words, with increasing temperature, the nursery web spiders become weaker predators, resulting in noticeably decreased prey mortality rate. At warmer temperatures, there is an increase in metabolism and energy demand. Due to the heat sensitivity of the nursery web spiders, the increased stress stemming from higher temperature result in the relinquishment of remarkable predator abilities. With damselfly prey  Reproduction  Mating for P. mira typically occurs in mid-June to mid-July. The female first transfers her eggs into a cocoon under her abdomen. She embraces this cocoon until the eggs are ready to hatch. While awaiting this process, the female also builds a \\"nursery web\\" by gathering leaves together, a safe place where the spiderlings will grow. Nursery web spiders are known to be univoltine, which means it only has one brood of offspring per year. The care of the offspring is typically solely the female's responsibility; from carrying eggs to maintaining the sac until hatching, the female does most of the work, and the male's role is very limited. The spiderlings molt multiple times, and at each stage, a larger skin develops to accommodate for the growing spider. The weaning phase begins after the spiderlings' first molt, with the departure of spiderlings from the nursery. With eggsac  Behavior  = Mating = During mating, the nursery web spiders are noted for their use of silk. Female P. mira is known to be sexually cannibalistic. In order to avoid being consumed by the female during mating, male P. mira wraps the legs of the female in silk prior to and during copulation. More specifically, the male uses his silk to immobilize the female's legs I and Ii while he holds her legs III and IV. Prior to mating, the male follows the female, periodically releasing his dragline (a line of spider silk). Slowly approaching the female from behind, the male traces the female's path until he reaches the female's hind legs. For the actual mating stage, both the male and the female release draglines. The female hangs freely from her dragline, while the male uses his dragline to reach the female. The male nursery web spider then rotates the female about three to five times, wrapping his silk around her legs and immobilizing them. Throughout this stage, the legs of the female are fixed in a flexed position, bounded by either the veil of silk from the male, or the legs of the male. Because the male legs play a significant role in immobilizing the female during mating and copulation, longer leg length in males are associated with greater chances of copulation and lower risk of being cannibalized in males. Because the female grows increasingly active throughout repeated copulations, researchers suggest that this is an example of a self-defense mechanism adopted by the male nursery spiders. However, as this behavior of female wrapping by the male remains rare among spiders, further investigation is necessary. = Number of mates = When the male P. mira is able to successfully avoid sexual cannibalism, it mates with multiple females to increase the numbers of offspring. The lack of responsibility for parental care distributed to P. mira is a key component behind this behavior. Unmanipulated male P. mira is known to successfully mate with up to 5 different females. Research has found that a single mating does not deplete the sperm storage in the pedipalps of the male nursery web spider. Thus, this consecutive mating may occur in relatively short time frames, ranging from a single night to a 72-hour window. Because the use of silk web to immobilize during copulation can ensure a greater chance at multiple mating, we can assume it to be a positive trait that is selected for among the males. = Nuptial gift = The silk generated by the male P. mira is rather versatile; when courting a female nursery web spider, the male spider offers her a \\"nuptial gift,\\" usually a prey wrapped up in the male's silk. This act of gift-giving serves as the first stage of mating, preceding copulation. The female spider then has a choice to either accept the gift and follow through with mating, or chase the male away. After copulation, the male typically takes the nuptial gift back with him. = Copulation = As seen above, copulation in nursery web spiders is facilitated by the unique silk wrapping behavior observed in males. In males, sperm is stored in organs called pedipalps. As male P. mira transfer approximately the same amount of sperm from pedipalps per insertion, increased insertion number was found to result in increased sperm transfer. Research has found that an increased number of sperm in P. mira also leads to an increase in the number of offspring, but the causal relationship still remains unclear. It is, however, still presumed that the silk wrapping is a trait evolved in males for an advantage in sexual selection and a maximization of reproductive fitness. = Sexual cannibalism = In nursery web spiders, females are known to frequently engage in sexual cannibalism. While sexual cannibalism is assumed to grant a greater chance at reproductive success with better fit and larger offspring, a common goal for spiders of both sexes, research has suggested that P. mira males can obtain greater fitness by avoiding sexual cannibalism and ensuring survival themselves. More specifically, the use of silk bridal veils was found to often grant higher fertilization success, as it interfered with the female's tactile and chemical receptors. Upon being trapped in the silk veil, the female P. mira shows increased movement in order to free themselves, and the attempts at sexual cannibalism may continue regardless of the veil.  Interaction with humans  Pisaurina mira, as one of the most common spiders found in eastern United States, is well integrated in human lives. While the venom of P. mira is lethal to its prey, it is not effective against larger targets and is thus very unlikely to be poisonous for humans. = Agricultural impact = Because the vast majority of nursery web spiders' diet consists of insects found on fields and other cultivation sites for crops, they inevitably have an effect on the population of bugs and pests who feed on those crops and share the same habitats. The seasonal fluctuation of prey population affects the seasonal fluctuation of the P. mira population as well. For example, the highest population level of tarnished plant bugs, a prevalent pest for crops in the United States, was marked in October and June. Accordingly, the highest population level for P. mira was in June as well. Thus, the interconnectedness of the population of these two species largely influence the crop yield. However, because P. mira's diet as a carnivore is rather diverse, a decline in the population of one prey does not hold much significance, as P. mira is able to hunt for other available insects.  Contribution to the ecosystem  P. mira contributes to the increase of carbon storage by reducing grasshopper herbivory. The presence of P. mira alters the dietary habits of grasshoppers, which consequently increases the carbon storage by allowing the plants to take over a larger area for photosynthesis as they can conserve the resources that were once reserved for self-protection. They are also known to consume tarnished plant bugs, a pest that holds economic significance on many crops in the United States, mostly for small fruits and vegetables.

The credits to the Differences As Light EP include thanks to Harding's two biggest influences, Hazel O'Connor and Billy Mackenzie, a lyric from each of whom is included in the three-part track, Reality Cheque.  History  Ian Hodson and Huw Lloyd-Jones had played and occasionally gigged in various bands prior to the formation of Also Eden. The initial Also Eden line-up in 2005 consisted of Lloyd-Jones and Hodson, plus Simon Rogers on guitar, Ralvin Thomas on bass, and Mark \\"DB\\" Hall on drums. In 2006, the band released their debut album, About Time. The five-track album was recorded and distributed independently by the band. Mark Hall's subsequent departure from the band saw Steve Byrne fill in for some live dates; Byrne does not feature on any recorded material with the band. In 2008, the band released their second album, It's Kind of You to Ask. This album featured a new rhythm section: Steve Dunn on Bass and Tim Coleman on drums. Tim Coleman was later to be replaced by Dave Roelofs. In late 2009, the band announced the departure of vocalist and founding member Huw Lloyd-Jones. Rich Harding, an acquaintance of guitarist Simon Rogers, joined as the band's new front man. Writing for what would become the band's next studio release, the 2010 EP Differences As Light, had already begun. The band chose to release the material as an EP, rather than expand it into a full album, both due to the amount of time since their last release, and to formally introduce Rich Harding as a band member. Less than three months after the release of Differences As Light, Rich Harding was involved in a nearly-fatal motorcycle accident, resulting in injuries including an aortic rupture, multiple broken ribs, vertebral and pelvic fractures, and both legs broken, the left almost beyond repair, calling the future of the band into question. Amputation of the leg and a voice- compromising tracheotomy were considered, but ultimately averted using an Ilizarov apparatus and Distraction osteogenesis. In Christmas 2010, a free download was made available through the band's website, featuring an original song called ‚ÄòDistortion Field‚Äô and the seasonal ‚ÄòBleak Mid Winter‚Äô. This was recorded while Harding was largely bed-ridden and recovering from his injuries. The former track is played in the live set, and will make a re- appearance on the next full album release. Throughout 2011, during Harding's ongoing recovery, the band wrote and recorded material for their third studio album. The album, entitled Think of the Children!, was released in October 2011, and features the band's current drummer, Lee Nicholas. The album was released via F2 Records. In keeping with the title, the original artwork used was by Rianne Kolenbrander and Karla-Louise Davidson, Harding's former and current step-daughter, with art direction by Harding and Marcel Kolenbrander (Rianne's father), who was also responsible for all original photography used. The band actively toured during 2011‚Äì12, with Harding having to sit on a stool during parts of the earlier gigs. After the removal of the Ilizarov Apparatus many more gigs have followed. Harding and Rogers have also played an increasing number of duo gigs under the anagrammatic moniker, Neo Deals, Harding also playing a first ever solo set at Bearded Theory Festival 2014. Recording, mastering, mixing and production on all releases to 2011 was performed at Steep Studios by Ian Hodson, assisted by Simon Rogers and the varying Also Eden band line-up. In late 2012 the band took on freelance producer/composer, Andy Davies, who has worked for twenty years on a variety of TV and film music, including Sky One's Stella. His first public contribution was to produce the now traditional free Christmas download, Endless Silence, track two of the studio album, [REDACTED], released in November 2013 on F2 Records. Steve Dunn's final appearance with the band was at DanFest in Leicester, in November 2012. He has been replaced by Graham Lane, whose first gig, at Gamla Christiania in Oslo, featured a guest appearance from Steve Rothery of Marillion, who joined the band to play Pink Floyd's Comfortably Numb. In April 2013, Ian Hodson departed the Also Eden lineup. Despite the rest of the band trying to persuade him to stay, Hodson reluctantly felt he had to go due to family and other work commitments. He was replaced on keys' by Howard \\"H\\" Sinclair, who contributed greatly to the completion of [REDACTED], before departing in July 2014 to resume his singer- songwriter career. He has been replaced by Andy Rigler, who also plays with Mr. So & So.

Rebellatrix Rebellatrix divaricerca (\\"rebel coelacanth (with a) forked tail\\", after the unique tail fin) is a large prehistoric coelacanth from the Lower Triassic Sulphur Mountain formation and Wapiti Lake Provincial Park of British Columbia. It is the only known species of the family Rebellatricidae. R. divaricerca's most distinguishing feature was its tuna-like forked tail (unusual for an actinistian fish), which suggested a fast-swimming and active lifestyle, unlike coelacanths related to the living species. The holotype specimen is a nearly complete fossil, with the exception of some fins and a large amount of the skull, as well as an incomplete tail fin. Three other specimens reveal the rest of the tail. The rebel coelacanth may have reached in length. In addition to its uniquely forked (and symmetrical) tail fin, the posterior dorsal fin is behind the anal fin rather than opposite it. Rebellatrix is believed to have been a fast-swimming predator, since its tail is clearly built for speed, and modern coelacanths only use the tail fin when attacking prey, and would have been one of the first non-sharks to fill this niche.

On May 2, 2012, at Ready's home in Gilbert, Arizona, he shot and killed his girlfriend, her daughter and granddaughter, the daughter's fianc√© and himself. Early years Ready graduated from Mulberry High School in Mulberry, Florida, in 1992. While Ready was in high school at age 18, he was arrested and charged with aggravated assault and criminal mischief for swinging a baseball bat at a car driven by a teenager whom he had an altercation with at a party. He was given a sentence of one year's probation and community service. Military service Ready served in the U.S. Marine Corps, achieving the rank of lance corporal. He attended MCRD Parris Island and went to the School of Infantry in North Carolina. Ready was assigned to MCB Camp Pendleton with Reconnaissance Company and 1st LAR Bravo company. He was expelled from Reconnaissance Company and eventually became a Scout for a LAV-25 with a M249 light machine gun being his main weapon. During a field exercise at Twentynine Palms Base, he arrived without his M249 and was duly punished in the field by his platoon sergeant. Because of his weight and a knee injury sustained from a PT football game, he did not serve aboard the USS Anchorage when Bravo Company left with the 15th MEU in November 1995. =Court martial= Ready was twice court-martialed during his service. The first resulted in a demotion and three months' imprisonment, the second resulted in six months' imprisonment and a Bad Conduct Discharge from the Corps in 1996. Convictions in the courts-martial included theft, assault, failure to follow orders, and unauthorized absence. The revelation of this history caused him to be removed as the master of ceremonies for a Mesa, Arizona, Veterans' Day parade in 2006. Vigilante activities Ready was a founder of the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps and the U.S. Border Guard, two armed vigilante groups that patrolled the Arizona‚ÄìMexico border searching for illegal immigrants. Ready was caught forcibly detaining immigrants twice in 2011. At the time of his death he was under investigation by the FBI, who were looking into a potential domestic terrorism situation involving immigrants found shot to death in the desert. Personal life Ready and his wife Arline Lindgren divorced in 2003. Ready was baptized into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in 2003 and ordained as an elder by then-Arizona State Senator Russell Pearce. In December 2010, a fellow church member described him as \\"no longer active\\" and Ready described himself as a \\"recovering Mormon\\". Prior to moving in with Mederos, he worked at an AutoZone auto parts store, from which he was fired. Gilbert police had responded to a domestic-violence call at the Mederos home once before in February 2012, and a Scottsdale woman had filed an order of protection against Ready in 2009. Politics Ready was politically active in anti-immigration causes. He served as president of the Mesa Community College Republican Party Club and as a precinct committeeman for the Maricopa County Republicans. Ready unsuccessfully campaigned for a seat in the Arizona House of Representatives in 2004 and for a seat on the city council for Mesa, Arizona, in 2006. He put forth as his motto that \\"The Purity of the Aryan Race is the most precious resource Nature has to offer All of Humankind.\\" Ready founded a private organization in June 2010 called the U.S. Border Guard, which aimed to curtail illegal immigration by conducting armed patrols along the Arizona‚ÄìMexico border. He attended and spoke at Tea Party movement events. The Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center described Ready as a neo-Nazi. Several Republicans attempted to have him expelled from his position in the party in Maricopa County due to his controversial views. Before starting a campaign for the position of Pinal County sheriff, he left the National Socialist Movement, but had Movement member Harry Hughes serving as his campaign chairman. He ran for sheriff as a Democrat, citing the party's past support for Jim Crow and Democratic politicians who had supported racial segregation, such as West Virginia U.S. Senator Robert Byrd (in the 1940s) and Alabama Governor George Wallace (later independent presidential candidate), as well as stating his opinion that there was no difference between the Republican and Democratic parties, and that in a non-partisan position such as sheriff, political affiliation did not matter. After Ready's murder-suicide, Pearce released a statement saying that he had previously rejected Ready due to his association with \\"despicable groups in society\\", and had objected to Ready's position in the Republican Party.  Gilbert shooting  On May 2, 2012, Ready entered his home in Gilbert, Arizona, and fatally shot his girlfriend Lisa, her daughter Amber, Amber's boyfriend, Jim Hiott, and Amber's infant daughter Lilly. He then fatally shot himself. A 9-1-1 call made from the house referred to an argument before the call was interrupted by gunfire. A teenager in the house at the time was in her bedroom and heard an argument, but survived the incident without being shot. Victims: * Lisa Mederos, age 47, Ready's girlfriend. She is believed to have made the first 9-1-1 call and was found dead inside the home. * Amber Mederos, 23, Lisa's daughter with Hugo Mederos. She was found dead inside the home. * Lilly Mederos, 15 months, Amber's daughter. She was initially found alive inside the home, but was pronounced dead at the hospital. * Jim Hiott, 24, Amber's fianc√©e, an Army veteran who served in Afghanistan.

Alongside the local police, the incident and premises were investigated by the Joint Terrorism Task Force, the FBI and the ATF, who found firearms, including 2 AR assault-style rifles and approximately two dozen military ordnance/40 mm grenades inside the garage, as well as Nazi flags, and police and Nazi uniforms.

His ancestral name was Ying (Â¨¥), and Duke Xian was his posthumous title. His title was recorded as Duke Ning of Qin (Áß¶ÂØßÂÖ¨) in the Records of the Grand Historian by Han Dynasty historian Sima Qian, but inscriptions on excavated bronzes from the era have proven that \\"Ning\\" (ÂØß) was a miscopy of the correct character \\"Xian\\" (ÊÜ≤). Accession to the throne Duke Xian succeeded his grandfather Duke Wen of Qin, who ruled for 50 years and died in 716 BC. Duke Xian was made the crown prince after his father predeceased Duke Wen in 718 BC. His father was given the posthumous title Duke Jing of Qin (Áß¶Á´´ÂÖ¨) although he never ascended the throne. Reign In 714 BC, the second year of Duke Xian's reign, the Qin capital was moved to Pingyang (Âπ≥ÈôΩ, in present-day Baoji, Shaanxi). The next year Qin defeated the Rong state of Bo (‰∫≥), whose king escaped to the Rong homeland. In autumn 708 BC Qin attacked the minor state of Rui, but was defeated. Qin returned in winter with the army of King Huan of Zhou, defeated Rui, and captured Wan, Count of Rui. Chapter IV. Succession In 704 BC Qin annexed Bo. Duke Xian died in the same year, aged 21. He had three young sons: the eldest, later known as Duke Wu of Qin, was the crown prince. The second son, later known as Duke De of Qin, was born to the same mother, Lu Ji (È≤ÅÂß¨). However, the ministers Fuji and Sanfu deposed the crown prince and installed the youngest son, by Duke Xian's other wife Wang Ji (ÁéãÂß¨), on the throne. The boy was only five years old and would become known as Chuzi.

Financial law forms a substantial portion of commercial law, and notably a substantial proportion of the global economy, and legal billables are dependent on sound and clear legal policy pertaining to financial transactions.The Law SocietyEconomic value of the legal sector services (March 2016) Therefore financial law as the law for financial industries involves public and private law matters. Understanding the legal implications of transactions and structures such as an indemnity, or overdraft is crucial to appreciating their effect in financial transactions. This is the core of Financial law. Thus, Financial law draws a narrower distinction than commercial or corporate law by focusing primarily on financial transactions, the financial market, and its participants; for example, the sale of goods may be part of commercial law but is not financial law. Financial law may be understood as being formed of three overarching methods, or pillars of law formation and categorised into five transaction silos which form the various financial positions prevalent in finance. For the regulation of the financial markets, see Financial regulation which is distinguished from financial law in that regulation sets out the guidelines, framework and participatory rules of the financial markets, their stability and protection of consumers; whereas financial law describes the law pertaining to all aspects of finance, including the law which controls party behaviour in which financial regulation forms an aspect of that law.ibid, See the extensive discussion outlined by Goode and Payne in Corporate Finance Law (Second Ed, Hart Publishing, 2015) which highlights the broader role of law, particularly market practice and case law, on the financial markets. Financial law is understood as consisting of three pillars of law formation, these serve as the operating mechanisms on which the law interacts with the financial system and financial transactions generally. These three components, being market practices, case law, and regulation; work collectively to set a framework upon which financial markets operate. Whilst regulation experienced a resurgence following the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008, the role of case law and market practices cannot be understated. Further, whilst regulation is often formulated through legislative practices; market norms and case law serve as primary architects to the current financial system and provide the pillars upon which the markets depend. It is crucial for strong markets to be capable of utilising both self-regulation and conventions as well as commercially mined case law. This must be in addition to regulation. An improper balance of the three pillars is likely to result in instability and rigidity within the market contributing to illiquidity.Benjamin Financial Law(2007 OUP) 6 For example, the soft law of the Potts QC Opinion in 1997 reshaped the derivatives market and helped expand the prevalence of derivatives. These three pillars are underpinned by several legal concepts upon which financial law depends, notably, legal personality, set-off, and payment which allows legal scholars to categorise financial instruments and financial market structures into five legal silos; those being (1) simple positions, (2) funded positions, (3) asset-backed positions, (4) net positions, and (5) combined positions. These are used by academic Joanna Benjamin to highlight the distinctions between various groupings of transaction structures based on common underpinnings of treatment under the law. The five position types are used as a framework to understand the legal treatment and corresponding constraints of instruments used in finance (such as, for example, a guarantee or Asset-backed security.) Three pillars of financial law formation Three different (and indeed inconsistent) regulatory projects exist which form the law within financial law. These are based on three different views of the proper nature of financial market relationships. =Market practices= The market practices of participants constitutes a core aspect of the source of law of the financial markets, primarily within England & Wales.Goodwin v Robarts (1875) LR 10 Exch 337, 346 The actions and norms of parties in creating standard practices creates a fundamental aspect of how those parties self-regulate. These market practices create internal norms which parties abide by, correspondingly influencing legal rules which result when the market norms are either broken or are disputed through formal, court, judgments.GOOD ON COMMERCIAL LAW (5TH ED 2016, EWAN MCKENDRICK CH 1 The principle role is to form soft-law; as a source of rules of conduct which in principle have no legally binding force but have practical effects.(SNYDER ‚ÄòEFFECTIVENESS OF EC LAW') This has created standard form of contracts for various financial trade associations such as Loan Market Association, which seeks to set guidance, codes of practice, and legal opinions. It is these norms, particularly those provided by Financial Market Law Committees, and City of London Law Societies which the financial market operates and therefore the courts are often quick to uphold their validity. Oftentimes \\"soft law\\" defines the nature and incidents of the relationships that participants of particular types of transactions expect.McCormick Legal Risk in Financial Markets (Oxford University Press 2006), 145 The implementation and value of soft law within the system, is particularly notable in its relationship with globalisation, consumer rights, and regulation. The FCA plays a central role in regulating the financial markets but soft law, voluntary or practice created legal schemes play a vital role. Soft law can fill market uncertainties what are produced by common law schemes. Obvious risk that that participants become lulled into believing statements of soft law is the law. However, the perception that an opinion constitutes ipso facto a clear and widely held opinion is wrongBenjamin (18.56) For example, the consumer relationship in the case of Office of Fair Trading v Abbey National [2009] UKSC 6 where the bank was fined by the FSA for failing to handle complaints set out in soft law principle practices on broadly worded business principles which state that the bank must pay due regard to the interests of its customers and treat them fairly.ibid Oftentimes the self-regulation of soft law can be problematic for consumer protection policies. Another example of the expansiveness of soft law in the financial market is the explosion of Credit Derivatives in London, which has flourished on the back of the characteristically robust opinion of Potts for Allen & Overy regarding the ISDA Master Agreement in 1990 which helped the industry separate itself from current market restrictions. A the time, it was unclear whether Credit Derivatives were to be categorised as insurance contracts under English legislation of the Insurance Companies Act 1982. ISDA was firm in rejecting a statutory definition of insurance, stating that This was crucial as Insurance companies were restricted from participating in other financial market activities and a licence needed to be granted to participate in the financial market. As a result of the Potts Opinion, credit derivatives were categorised as outside of insurance contracts, which allowed them to expand without the limitations set in place by insurance legislation. Soft law has practical effects in that it is liable in many cases to be turned into \\"hard law\\", but with verified and experienced practice evidence.Goodwin v Robarts (1875) LR 10 Exch 337 In the case Vanheath Turner (1622) the court remarked that custom of merchants is part of the common law of the United Kingdom. This highlights a long history of incorporating and accounting for the lex mercatoria into the English law in order to facilitate financial markets. Law merchant had been so absorbed by the 18th century that the Bills of Exchange Act 1882 could provide common law rules and merchant law in tandem. We might consider Tidal Energy Ltd v Bank of Scotland, where Lord dyson held that \\"a many who employee a banker is bound by the usages of bankers\\"Hare v Hently [1861] EngR 575, (1861) 10 CB NS 65, (1861) 142 ER 374 meaning that if a sort code and account number was correct, it did not matter if the name did not match. There are risks on over-reliance on soft law sources, however.McCormick Legal Risk in the Financial Market (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006) English law makes it difficult to create a type of security and reliance on rules may result in established views which reinforce errors. This could result in unacceptable security even if legally valid. =Case law= The second category which financial law draws most of its pragmatism with regard to the standards of the markets originates in litigation. Often, courts seek to reverse engineer matters to make commercially beneficial outcomes and so case law operates in a similar manner to market practice in producing efficient results.Cf Petrofina (UK) Ltd v Magnaload Ltd [1984] AC 127 There are two exceptions, attempting to limit the expectations to reasonable commercial men and uphold the freedom of contract. Autonomy is at the heart of commercial law and there is the strong case for autonomy in complex financial instruments.Belmont Park Investments pty ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services 2011 UKSC 38 per Lord Collins. Re Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA (No 8) highlights the striking effect a commercially beneficial practice can have on financial law. Lord Hoffman upheld the validity of a security charge over a chose in action the bank held which it owed to a client. Despite the formidable conceptual problems in allowing a bank to place a charge over a debt the bank itself owed to another party, the courts have been driven to facilitate market practices as best as possible. Thus, they are careful to declare practices as conceptually impossible. In BCCI, the court held that a charge was no more than labels to self-consistent rules of law, an opinion shared Lord Goff in Clough Mill v Martin where he wrote Unfortunately, case coverage is unsystematic. Wholesale and international finance is patchy as a result of a preference to settle disputes through arbitration rather than through the courts.Macmillan Inc v Bishopsgate Investment Trust plc (no 3) [1995] 1 WLR 978 This has the potential to be detrimental to advancing the law regulating finance. Market participants generally prefer to settle disputes than litigate, this places a greater level of importance onto the \\"soft law\\" of market practices.Benjamin Financial Law, 1.06, p5 However, in face of disaster, litigation is essential, especially surrounding major insolvencies, market collapse, wars, and frauds. The collapse of Lehman Brothers provides a good example, with 50 judgments from the English Court of Appeal and 5 from the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom. Despite these problems, there is a new breed of litigious lenders, primarily hedge funds, which has helped propel the pragmatic nature of financial case law past the 2008 crisis.M Hughes, Legal Principles in Banking and Structured Finance, 2nd Ed, (Haywards Heath, Tottel, 2006) =Regulation and legislation= The third category of law formation within the financial markets are those deriving from national and international regulatory and legislative regimes, which operate to regulate the practice of financial services. Three regulatory lenses ought to be highlighted namely arm's length, fiduciary, and consumerist approaches to financial relationships. In the EU these might be exampled by MiFiD II, payment services directive, Securities settlement regulations and others which have resulted from the financial crisis or regulate financial trade.Lamfalussy Report, 22 Regulatory control by the Financial Conduct Authority and Office of Fair trading set out clear rules replacing extra-statutory codes of conduct and has seen recent resurgence following the 2008 financial crisis. The regulatory policies have not all been rectified in regard to how they the new rules will be coherent with current market practices. We may consider In Re Lehman Brothers [2012] EWHC(Extended liens case) where Briggs J struggled to determine the legislative intent of the Financial Collateral Directive. Financial collateral regulations In addition to national and cross- national regulations on finance, additional rules are put into place in order to stabilise the financial markets by reinforcing the utility of collateral. In Europe, two regimes of collateral carve-outs exist; the Financial Collateral Directive, and the Financial Collateral Arrangement (No 2) Regulations 2003. The EU's development of the Financial Collateral Directive is curious if we view it through the lens of only a regulatory matter. It is clear that the law here developed through market practice and private law statutory reform. The EU has played a substantial role in this field to induce and encourage the ease of transfer & realisation of assets and liquidity within markets. The provisions are well adapted to short term transactions such as repos or derivatives. Further harmonisation rules pertaining to commercial conflict of laws matters were clarified. The additional Geneva Securities Convention set by UNIDROIT provides a basic framework for minimum harmonised provisions governing rights conferred by the credit of securities to an account with an intermediary. However, this international project has as of late been ineffective with only Bangladesh signing. Legal concepts prevalent in financial law Several legal concepts underpin the law of finance. Of these, perhaps the most central concept is that of legal personality, the idea that the law can create non-natural persons is one of the most important common myths and among the most ingenious inventions for financial practice because it facilitates the ability to limit risk by creating legal persons which are separate. Other legal concepts, such as set- off and payment are crucial to preventing systemic risk by lessening the level of gross exposure of credit risk a financial participant might be exposed to on any given transaction. This is often mitigated through the use of collateral. If financial law is centrally concerned with the law pertaining to financial instruments or transactions, then it can be said that the legal effect of those transactions is to allocate risk. =Limited liability and legal personality= A limited liability company is an artificial creation of legislature which operates to limit the level of credit risk and exposure a financial market participant will participate within. Lord Sumption summarised the position by stating For financial markets, the allocation of financial risk through separate legal personality allows for parties to participate in financial contracts and transfer credit risk between parties. The ambition of measuring the likelihood of future loss, that is of identifying risk, is a central part of the role legal liability plays in economics. Risk is a crucial part of financial market sectors: =Financial collateral= Financial markets have developed particular methods for taking security in relation to transactions, this is because collateral operates as a central method for parties to mitigate the credit risk of transacting with others. Derivatives frequently utilise collateral to secure transactions. Large notional exposures can be reduced to smaller, single net amounts. Often, these are designed to mitigate the credit risk one party is exposed to. Two forms of financial collateralization have been developed from the Lex Mercatoria; # Title transfer; or # By granting a security interest A security interest may be granted with a right of use, conferring disposal powers. There is an increasing reliance on collateral in financial markets, and in particular, this is driven by regulatory margin requirements set out for derivatives transactions and financial institution borrowing from the European Central Bank. The higher the collateral requirements, the greater demand for quality exists. For lending, it is generally regarded that there are three criteria for determining high-quality collateral. Those being assets which are or can be: *Liquid; and *Easily priced; and *Of Low credit risk There are several benefits to having financial collateral provisions. Namely, financial reduces credit risk, meaning the cost of credit and the cost of transacting will be lowered. The reduced insolvency risk of the counter-party, combined with more credit being available to the collateral taker will mean the collateral taker can take additional risk without having to rely on a counter-party.Lousie Gullifer What should we do about Financial Collateral? (2012) Current Legal Problems Vol 65.1, 377,410 Systemic risk will be reduced by increased liquidity, This produces \\"knock-on effects\\" by increasing the number of transactions a collateral taker can safely enter, freeing up capital for other uses. However, there is a need for balance; the removal of limitations on insolvency rules and security registration requirements, as observed in the FCARs, is dangerous as it degrades powers and protections which have been conferred deliberately by the law. Financial collateral regulations The primary objective of the Financial Collateral Directive was to reduce systemic risk, harmonise transactions and reduce legal uncertainty. It achieved this by exempting qualified \\"Financial collateral arrangements\\" from the performance of formal legal requirements; notably registration and notification. Second, the collateral taker is provided effective right of use and said arrangements are exempted from being re-characterised as different security arrangements. Perhaps most significantly, traditional insolvency rules which may invalidate a financial collateral arrangement; such as freezing assets upon entering into insolvency, are suspended. This allows a collateral taker to act without the limitation which may arise from a collateral provider entering bankruptcy. The FCARsFinancial Collateral Arrangement No 2 Regulations 2003 and 2010 Financial Markets and Insolvency Amendment Regulation focus on outlining when a financial collateral arrangement will be exempted from national insolvency and registration rules. In England, the requirements that a financial collateral arrangements only applies between non-natural persons with one being a financial institution, central bank, or public body; the FCAR has been \\"gold-platted\\"USA v Nolan [2016] UKSC 63 by allowing any non-natural person to benefit. Thus, to qualify as a \\"financial collateral arrangement\\" under the FCARs, a transaction must be in writing and regard \\"relevant financial obligations\\".FCARs Regulation 3 The criteria for a \\"relevant financial obligations\\" is set out in Part I Paragraph 3 The purpose of the provision is to increase the efficiency of markets and lower the transaction costs. The disapplied formal and perfection requirements accelerates the effectiveness of security through FCAR Reg 4(1),(2),(3) and 4(4). Two things might be said of this. Firstly, academicsRiz Mokal, Liquidity, Systemic Risk, and the Bankruptcy Treatment of Financial Contracts 10 Brooklyn Journal of Corporate, Financial, and Commercial Law (2015) have highlighted the risk of dappling statute of frauds and other requirements. It runs real risk of repealing substantial protections which were developed, at least in English common law, because of real risks of exploitation.Louise Gullifer, Jennifer Payne Corporate Finance: Principles and Policy (2015) Hart Publishing, 310 Other forms of protection which has been repealed includes the ability to allow parties to implement Appropriation if expressly agreed is permitted.FCAR Regulation 17 Extensive litigation has resulted from the determination of the FCAR regulations, specifically the meaning of \\"possession or control\\" as set out in paragraph 3.The definition in para 3 is rather unhelpful: Possession: of financial collateral in the form of cash or financial instruments includes the case where financial collateral has been credited to an account in the name of the CT provided that any rights the collateral provider may have in relation to the FC are limited to the right to substitute FC of the same or greater value or withdraw excess FC. Recital 10 states that possession or control is for the safety of third parties, however, the type of mischief this is seeking to remove is unclear.cf Youngna Choi Ostensible Financial Stability Caused by Wealth Inequality (March 23, 2018). Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3147465 or https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3147465 In C-156/15 Swedbank, the CJEU enforced the requirement that practical control was that of legal negative control. What is clear is that (1) possession is more than merely custodial and dispossession is mandatory. Some legal control is also crucial, meaning practical or administrative control is insufficient. =Possession= Requirement that collateral must be in possession is unclear. Is it one, two things? Does possession apply to intangibles? We do know that you cant. Is the requirement of control the same as the test for fixed charges. The scope of the regime is not clear. There are several unanswered questions. Only the collateral providers can have is right of substitution and right to withdraw surplus. Possession applies to intigble if it is credited to an account. Gullifer suggests that this is a redundant definition. The directive drafted with English and Irish laws not being centrally in mind. It was about disposition. To some extent, ownership discourages transactions for the risk of ostensible wealth. It was held that the phrase was to be construed in a manner consistent with meaning and purpose.In the matter of Lehman Brothers International (Europe) (In administration) [2012] EWHC 2997 (CH), [76] Briggs J This is not merely a matter of English law,In the matter of Lehman Brothers International (Europe) (In administration) [2012] EWHC 2997 (CH) [105]Gray v GTP Group Limited [2010] EWHC 1772 Ch, Los J Lord Briggs' judgment in Client Money [2009] EWHC 3228 held that to interpret the meaning of the directive a court ought to 1. Interpret the directive. We can look at different language texts and cases if any. 2. Interpret domestic legislation in light of the directive (as interpreted through stage 1) This is not restricted by conventional rules. Meaning that the court can and will depart from literal meaning and may imply words as necessary however, one cannot go against domestic legislation, nor require the court to make decisions it is not prepared to make. Repercussions must be and are considered by the court. =Control= By contrast, Control has been shown to not be that of practical (Administrative) control. It is clear that FCARs require a standard of negative legal control. Practical control, is the Collateral Taker's exclusive ability to dispose and it is suggested this will additionally be required if the parties are to avoid fraud. It is established by the rights and prohibitions in the security agreement but there is limited case-law on the matterLimited to Gray v GTP Group Limited [2010] EWHC 1772 Ch, Los J and Cukurova Finance International Ltd v Alfa Telecom Turkey Ltd [2009] UKPC 19 ScholarsLouise Gullifer ^ identify two forms of control: * positive * negative (Collateral Provider has no rights in relation to dealing with or disposal of collateral) Positive and Negative control differ where one either has the right to dispose without reference to the collateral provider, or where collateral provider is able to do so without collateral taker. What is undeniable however, is that dispossession is central to both possession and control. Rights of the Collateral taker must be beyond merely custodial; he must be able to refuse to hand collateral back. There are a handful of risks to these arrangements - as previously outlined - the ill definition of what constitutes the activation of the FCAR arrangements creates a danger. However, within the context of appropriation, a provider only has a personal right against a taker for the surplus. There is no proprietary right. Should a taker (like Lehman) become insolvent, a provider may well be at a loss for the excess. It encourages the party to reclaim excess value whenever possible/reasonably practical. This is not always possible due to the variation of the markets. Further, the risk of appropriation is that these can be used for ulterior purposes. Which as created the Cukurova problem;Cukurova Finance International Ltd v Alfa Telecom Turkey Ltd [2009] UKPC 19 there parties had constructed a scheme to capture shares with a clause preventing the collateral taker from selling large securities at once and spooking the market, but valuation is not linear which made it difficult, if not impossible to determine what a commercially reasonable price for securities would be in an illiquid market. =Set off= Other concepts, crucial to financial markets include Contingent obligations, the fact that bank debts operate as money; and Set-off designed to mitigate the net exposure of transactions. Set-off as a legal concept is crucial part of reducing credit risk and reducing the knock- on effects of insolvency.Goode and Gullifer on Legal Problems of Credit and Security (Sweet & Maxwell, 7th ed 2017)P Wood Title Finance, Derivatives, Securitisation, Set off and Netting, (London: Sweet & Maxwell, 1995), 189 Collectively, these concepts operate to underpin financial transactions by further dividing risk. Various combinations of these legal methods are used to produce various allocations of risk.Benjamin, Financial Law (2007 Oxford University Press), 13 For example, the ISDA 2002 master agreement utilises contingent obligations, set-off, and legal personality to reduce the liabilities of non-defaulting parties in the event of default.ISDA Master Agreement Clause 2(a)(iii) The effect of Clause 2(a)(iii) of the ISDA agreement is to suspend the payment obligations of parties until the event of default has been cured. Such a cure may not ever occur. There is substantial academic cautionLomas v JFB Firth Rixson Inc [2012] EWCA Civ 419 that such a suspension acts to circumvent insolvency pari passu objectives. However, there is equal evidence that the clause provides substantial market stability as a result of the standardisation and universality that the ISDA Master Agreement has within the derivatives market. It further provides the involved parties to suspend the swap (and any other transactions within the master agreement), providing them the time to understand the overall effect the event of default has had on the agreement and the market. In other words, it provides a breather. =Payment= Payment operates as another core legal concept which underpins financial law. It is crucial because it determines the point at which a party discharges their obligation to another party. In finance, particularly relating to set-off, guarantees, or other simple and funded positions; the definition of payment is crucial to determining the legal exposure of parties. Several of the cases derive predominately from English and U.S. law, pertaining to the Lex mercatoria, and was developed when finical law historically focused on maritime trade. In English and U.S. law, payment is consensual, requiring acceptance from both payee and payer.Gloster J in Canmer International v UK Mutual Steamship \\"The Rays\\" Roy Goode suggests that Payment is a; . Payment as a legal concept is underpinned by the law of contract. In most common law jurisdictions, a valid contract requires sufficient consideration.Foakes v Beer [1884] UKHL 1Chappell & Co Ltd v Nestl√© Co Ltd [1960] AC 87 Payment plays a crucial role in financial law because it determines when parties are able to discharge duties. In Lomas v JFB Firth Rixson Inc [2012] EWCA Civ 419, the issue concerned when a debtor was able to discharge the duty to pay under the ISDA Master Agreement (1992). The requirement for payment arises in English law from a duty in performance of a money obligation. Whilst normally described and fulfilled in monetary terms, payment need only satisfy the creditor and does not necessarily involve the delivery of money,Charter Reinsurance Co v Fagan but it cannot constitute payment unless money is involved, even if performance is fulfilled by some other act. Obligation to pay or tender the debt is balanced by the obligation on the part of the seller not to refuse the whole or part of the debt. This is underpinned by limitations on part-payment.Lord Steyn ‚ÄòContract Law: Fulfilling the Reasonable Expectations of Honest Men' (1997) 113 Law Quarterly Review 433, 437Williams v Roffey Bros & Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd [1990] 2 WLR 1153; [1989] EWCA Civ 5Williams v Williams [1957] 1 WLR 14MWB Business Exchange Centers Ltd v Rock Advertising Ltd [2016] EWCA Civ 553 (Kitchin LJ); This traditionally operates in order to proffering money to fulfil obligations within a contract.Alan Brudner ‚ÄòReconstructing Contracts' (1993) 43:1 University of Toronto Law Journal, 1 In taking it, it is an affirmation of said contract and the debtor is discharged of his obligation to the creditor.Chen-Wishart A Bird in the Hand: Consideration and One-Sided Contract modifications' in Contract Formation and Parties (AS Burrows, ed and E Peel, ed Oxford University Press 2010) 109 This is crucial. In contracts where A (‚Äòthe debtor') owes money to B (‚Äòthe creditor'), payment operates as the terminus for A's obligation to B. It was crucially held in Societe des Hotel Le Touquet Paris-Plage v Cummings(1922) 1 KB 451 that the bilateral contractual process did not require \\"accord and satisfaction\\" to achieve discharge of a debt by payment. The operation of payment therefore requires mutual acceptancecompliance}} from \\"both creditor and debtor\\". Two conceptual points of mutual consent Mutual consent must thus occur at two points, ex ante and ex post of the contract between parties and at what we might call \\"point Z\\" for situations where an obligation to pay does not result from contractual duties. (such as a debt owed to a non-adjusting creditor, cf Bebchuk and Fried). At both points, mutual consent required from both parties. First, ex ante consent occurs at the time where parties agree on the obligation. If a party has specified a method for discharging an obligation through a specific means, then the parties must have contemplated the sufficiency of the tender to discharge the debt and therefore consensually agreed to payment of a specified way.Mindy Chen-Wishart In defence of consideration(2013) Oxford Commonwealth Law Journal, Vol 13.1 This will likely provide specification on when tender may be rejected. Chen-Wishart's discussion of the importance of consideration within the bargain theory of contracts enunciates the emphasis the English law has placed on benefit and deliberateness when contracting.Jefferson Cumberbatch ‚ÄòOn Bargains, Gifts and Extortion: An Essay on the Function of Consideration in the Law of Contract' (1990) 19:3 Anglo-American Law Review 239Charles Fried Contract as Promise: A theory of contractual obligation (Harvard University Press 1981) 38P.S. Atiyah ‚ÄòConsideration in Contract: A fundamental Restatement (1971); ‚ÄòConsideration: A Restatement' in Essays on Contract (Oxford: Claredon Press 1986) 179 Contracting parties must have contemplated, negotiated, and reached mutual agreement in regard to how the obligation would be discharged. This does not, however, prevent or impede the occurrence of \\"point Z\\". Parties may duly agree on payment in principle prior to the execution of the contract and subsequently still fail to effect payment.The Brimnes Tenax Steamship Co v Owners of the Motor Vessel Brimnes [1974] EWCA Civ 15Mardorf Peach & Co v Attica Sea Carriers Corp of Liberia (The Laconia) [1977] AC 850The Chikuma [1981] 1 All ER 652 Functionally agreement results in questioning whether or not payment has been made by the debtor. The debtor must commit a certain level of formality to proffering the obligation. This formality may take the form of complying with a contract. Failure to comply, is not payment. Second, ex post, regardless of whether parties have mutually agreed and specified a method, or a money of payment, the parties (notably the creditor) must consent to the debtor's tender in order to crystallise payment and sever the demand for payment. Discharge of a debt is automatic. In other words, a payment of a contractual obligation requires mutual consent of payment at both the stage of formation and at the conclusion/distribution to be recognised as ‚Äòpayment', but upon acceptance of payment the debt is discharged. In Colley v Overseas Exporters[1921] 3 KB 302 it was shown that even where tender complies with the contract, it is not payment until the creditor (or Payer) accepts. This is regardless of whether the creditor's rejection frustrates the contract and is a breach of their duty. The law does not allow the debtor to coerce the creditor into accepting a tender.Mann on the Legal Aspect of Money (OUP, 7th ed 2012 by Charles Proctor) Chapter 1 This is the case, even when the debtor has forwarded valid tender.Cf Hobhouse J in TSB Bank of Scotland plc v Welwyn Hatfield District Council [1993] Bank LR 267 It is the subsequent acceptance or non-acceptance of the tender from the creditor which crystallises payment and effects discharge. Mere receipt will not suffice. However, mutual consent is of a lower standard than that in contractual formation. In TSB Bank of Scotland plc v Welwyn Hatfield District Council [1993] Bank LR 267, Hobhouse J held that acceptance of payment need not be communicated and his judgment provides a clear, two-stage test for determining whether payment has been made. If A; *places the money unconditionally at the disposal of his creditor; and *the conduct of the creditor, viewed objectively, amounts to acceptance, then payment has passed. Thus, in Libyan Arab Bank v Bankers Trust Co[1989] QB 728 the court held that when the collecting bank decided unconditionally to credit the creditor's account, the payment is completed. Presentation and subsequent rejection of payment provides an absolute defence for to an action brought by the creditor, but without the action (and opportunity to pay into the court) and with exceptions,Sale of Goods Act 1979 c.54 Section 38 which states; \\"Unpaid seller defined. (1)The seller of goods is an unpaid seller within the meaning of this Act‚Äî (a)when the whole of the price has not been paid or tendered; (b)when a bill of exchange or other negotiable instrument has been received as conditional payment, and the condition on which it was received has not been fulfilled by reason of the dishonour of the instrument or otherwise. (2)In this Part of this Act ‚Äúseller‚Äù includes any person who is in the position of a seller, as, for instance, an agent of the seller to whom the bill of lading has been indorsed, or a consignor or agent who has himself paid (or is directly responsible for) the price.\\" the debtor's proffering of payment does not discharge the money obligation nor does it constitute as payment. In the case of The Laconia, the English House of Lords set out clear conditions on timing of payment in relation to the debtor proffering payment. The charterers had procured a vessel for 3 months, 15 days with a payment due on April 12, a Sunday. The charterers delivered payment on Monday. The vessel owners rejected the payment, which was sent back the following day. Primarily, The Laconia regards the requirement for a tender to be congruent with the conditions in order to amount to a tendering of payment. However, the case might also be used to highlight the necessity for the creditor to accept such tendering. Had the vessel owners merely taken receipt of the payment and not instructed their bank to return the money, then it seems likely that payment was accepted. The consensual nature of payment thus derives from the requirement that both debtor must offer, and creditor must accept, the medium of payment; and secondly from the fact that creditor rejection of procurement, even if his agent is in receipt of the payment, results in a failure to effect payment. Goode discusses two forms where receipt does not take effect as acceptance that fall into the second aforementioned stage of mutual consent; #Conditional acceptance. Where a cheque is accepted it is conditional on such a cheque being met. Here, letters of Credit come to mind in that their conditional nature is dependent on the bank effecting payment. In The Chikuma and The Brimnes the court examined whether payment was fulfilled on the side of the payer. From that perspective, it was necessary for the court to analyse whether the payer had fulfilled the conditions in order to effect discharge. #Receipt by creditor's agent. The Laconia falls within this category. This is primarily because it is not always clear whether the agent lacked the authority to accept the payment.Cleveland v Muslim Commercial Bank [1981] 2 Lloyd's Rep 646 The fact that rejection of tender is sufficient to prevent ‚Äòpayment' derives from the fact that payment is the conferral of property to fulfil the obligation. Property and obligation aspects of the transaction cannot be separated without the transaction ceasing to be \\"payment\\".See Algoa Milling Co Ltd v Arkell and Douglas 1918 AD 145 at 158 Financial law transactional categories As well as being fragmented, financial law is often muddled. Historical segregation of the industry into sectors has meant each has been regulated and conducted by different institutions.Benjamin, Financial Law (Oxford University Press), 9 The approach to financial law is unique depending on the structure of the financial instrument. The historical development of various financial instruments explains the legal protections which differ between, say, guarantees and indemnities. Due to the limited cross-sectoral legal awareness, innovations in finance have been associated with varying levels of risk. Several different legal \\"wrappers\\" provide different structured products, each with differing levels of risk allocation, for example, funded positions consist of bank loans, capital market securities, and managed funds. The primary purpose of financial law is to allocate risk from one person to another and change the nature of risk being run by the protection buyer into the 'credit risk' of the risk taker. Five categories of market structures are divided according to how the contract deals with the credit risk of the risk taker. =Simple financial positions= Guarantees, insurance, standby letters of credit and performance bonds. The terms Simple can often be misleading, as often the transactions which fall within this category are often complicated. They are termed simple not because of the lack of sophistication but because the transactions do not address the credit exposure of the protection buyer. Rather, as with a guarantee, the protection buyer simply takes the risk of protection seller. Derivatives often fall within this regulatory category because they transfer risk from one party to another. Derivatives law The second portion of simple transactions are derivatives, specifically unfunded derivatives of which, four basic types exist. At law, the primary risk of a derivative is the risk of a transaction being re-characterised as another legal structure. Thus, the courts have been cautious to make clear definitions of what amounts to a derivative at law. Fundamentally, a derivative is a contract for difference, it utilises netting to set obligations between parties. Rarely does delivery of the asset occur.S85 Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 In English law, the judgment of Lomas v JFB Firth Rixon [2012] EWCA Civ, quotes the leading test Firth on Derivatives, characterising a derivative as a As legal instruments, derivatives are bilateral contracts which rights and obligations of the parties are derived from, or defined by, reference to a specified asset type, entity, or benchmark and the performance of which is agreed to take place on a date significantly later than the date in which the contract is concluded. Types Various types of derivatives exist with even greater variance of reference assets. English law in particular has been clear to distinguish between two types of basic derivatives: Forwards and Options.Tullett Prebon Group [2008] EWHCSunrise Brokers v Rogers [2014] EWCH 2633 (QB) at [7] Often parties will place limits on the interest rate differentials when engaging in trades. At law, these are known as ‚ÄúCaps & Collars‚Äù, these reduce the cost of the transaction. Regulation has been a key component in making the market more transparent, this has been particularly useful in protecting small and medium sized businesses.Dexia Crediop S.p.A. v Commune di Prato [2017] EWCA Civ 428 ‚Äò'per Paul Walker J Swaps and Credit derivatives also differ in legal function. A credit derivative describes various contracts designed to assume or distribute credit risk on loans or other financial instruments. Payment obligations of a seller is triggered by specified credit events affective defined assets or entities. In a swap, it was held in Hazell v Hammersmith and Fulham London Borough Council[1992] 2 AC 1, [739]-[740] by Woolf LJ that equity swaps were developed under ISDA's guidance and might be defined as These are differentiated from credit derivatives, which reference the credit risk of specified credit event; usually a bankruptcy, failure to make payment, or a breach of a condition such as a debt-to-equity ratio. Payment as a core concept in finance is crucial to the operation of derivatives.P Ali & de Vires Robbe Synthetic, Insurance, and Hedge Fund Securitisation (2004 OUP), 11 Credit derivatives which are \\"self-referenced\\", i.e. referencing the parties own credit worthiness have been considered by the courts as capable of involving fraud.Money Markets International Stockbrokers Ltd v London Stock Exchange Ltd [2001] Ch D 223 =Legal issues= A swap derivative with negative interest rates highlights particularly issues at law. It is unclear how a party pays a negative number. Does it reverse the obligations? According to the ISDA Master Agreement variation in 2006, a swap has a \\"zero floor\\" which means that if interest rates reverse, the obligations do not reverse. Without the 2006 variation, the negative interest rate is a deduction off what is owed. An additional area of relevant derivatives law is shown in the cases of DharmalaBankers Trust International PLC v PT Dharmala Sakti Sejahtera [1996] CLC 518 and Peekay,Peekay Intermark Ltd and Another v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd CA [2006] EWCA Civ 386 both of which involved arguments of mis-selling derivative transactions.Alistar Hudson The Uses and Abuses of Derivatives (1998) Cambridge Symposium on Economic Crime This is closely related with the argument that parties, particularly government bodies lack the power to enter into derivative contracts.Hazell v Hammersmith and Fulham London Borough Council [1992] 2 AC 1 In Dharmala, the claimant argued unsuccessfully that the bank misrepresented the transaction. It was held that they did misrepresent but for the misrepresentation to effect a claim, it was necessary to induce someone to enter into the contract, which was unable to be proven. In Peekay, the Court of Appeal rejected the suit for misrepresentation when the defendant mis-sold a synthetic credit derivative to Peekay which had its reference assets in Russian investments. The Peekay director ought to have read the documents rather than relying on the defendant's oral representation. This is a pro-market approach with marked Judaical disinclination to not strike down transactions, substantial problems exist with enforcing a contract against a party which argues it lacks the power to enter into an agreement, it has been likened to pulling oneself up by the bootstraps as the party cannot warrant that it has the power if it truly doesn't.Credit Suisse International v Stichting Vestia Group [2014] EWHCUBS AG v KOMMUNALE WASSERWERKE LEIPZIG GMBH [2014] EWHC 3615 Documentation of derivatives often utilises standard forms to increase liquidity, this is particularly the case in exchange traded, or \\"over the counter\\" derivatives which are predominately documented using the ISDA Master Agreement. These agreements operate to create a singular transaction which lasts the duration of the trading relationship. Confirmation of trades can be codified by oral contracts made over the phone. This is only possible because interpretation of the standard form documentation is done in a manner so that the terms of art used within the documents have their own autonomous meaning separate from the law of the forum. Flexibility within the contract, and a court appreciation for the commercial objectives of the master agreements is a crucial aspect of the long-term operation of the financial markets which they support.Lomas v JFB Firth Rixon [2012] EWCA CivStandard Chartered Bank v Ceylon Petroleum [2011] EWHC 1785 [27] - [36] The ISDA Master Agreement is dependent on market practices, which attach to interpretations of intention within a context of long term relationships. The aim is to differentiate relational contracts from one-off contracts. The concept of a single agreement is not new. The is an artificial line to sum-off and default netting practicesBNP Paribas v Wockhardt EU Operations (Swiss) AG [2009] EWHC 3116 (Comm) Payment of a derivative contract, particularly those of standardised forms, use netting. This minimises credit risk. Recharacterisation In being similar to one another in terms of economic market effects, simple positions are particularly susceptible to being re-characterised. When this happens, substantial legal consequences can result, as each legal instrument has different consequences. Whilst a guarantee and an indemnity have, in substance, the same economic result; the law characterises each differently because it affords an indemnifier less protection than a guarantor. Similarly, a derivative or guarantee must not be recharacterised as an insurance contract, as such contracts are strictly regulated by government regulation. A re-characterisation into an insurance contract would be fatal to the contract, as only licensed parties can issue such terms. The characterisation of financial transactions by the court takes the form of two stages; examining the legal substance, not the form of the agreement. Thus, stating that a contract is a derivative, does not make it a derivative. As held by Lord Millet in Agnew v Commissioners of Inland Revenue (Re Brumark Investments Ltd,[2001] UKPC 28 characterisation interprets the document and then categorises it within one of the existing legal doctrines. Intention is not relevant, however, there are sensitivities to this matter, primarily concerning the insurance markets. Three key types of recharacterisation can occur to simple positions #Guarantees or Indemnities: In Yeoman Credit Ltd v Latter(1961) WLR 828 per Harman LJ the court held perhaps the most important distinction. The distinction between the two is that a guarantee is a secondary obligation to pay whilst an indemnity is a primary obligation.Birkmyr V Darnell. 1704 91 ER 27 1 Salk, 27 & 28Stadium Finance Co v Helm #Guarantees or Performance bonds: Performance bonds are similar to a promissory note, this turns again upon the primacy of the obligations. The courts have been extremely hesitant to implement a performance bond onto parties which are not banks. #Guarantees or Insurance: Both are protecting creditors from loss, however a guarantee is narrower. Romer LJ set out three variables to differentiate the two:Seaton v Heath [1899] 1 QB 782 (1) the motives of the parties differ, insurance is a business contract and cover is provided in consideration for a premium. Guarantees are provided without payment. (2) The manner of dealings differ; an insurer usually deals with the insured and not the reference entity. (3) The means of knowledge which is disclosed. The insured ‚Äò'must disclose material facts, why a guarantor is left to himself to determine facts. A guarantee thus is traditionally drafted to stand behind the debtor rather than be payable on the occurrence of an event. In England, prior to the Gambling Act 2005, the courts often interpreted contracts as gambling and avoided them. Any contract which exists under the purview of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 is not avoided by the Gambling Act 1845 provisions. This is, in part, due to the Potts Opinion which argued the legal distinctiveness of derivatives from gambling and insurance contracts. This was argued by stating that the payment obligation was not conditional on loss and rights were not dependent on an insurable interest. =Funded positions= Lending is perhaps the most central aspect of the financial system. As discussed by Benjamin, the law attempts to allocate risk in ways which is acceptable to the parties involved. Bank loans and capital market transactions fall within this category. It may be defined as situations where the risk-taker is the provider of capital to another party. If the risk materialise, the exposure is not merely an obligation to pay, but rather the exposure of the risk-taker is the risk of losing its previously committed capital. That is to say, a funded position is the risk of repayment. When a bank makes a loan, it pays money and runs the risk of a lack of repayment. Difference between funded positions and other positions One might ask what the difference between an asset-backed security and funded positions. The answer is that funded positions are positions which are acquired without backing of other assets. The true difference is that of funded positions and simple positions. Simple positions, such as guarantees, insurance, standby credits and derivatives. Funded positions differ from simple positions in that simple positions expose risk as a form of a promise. The risk taker agrees to pay the beneficiary upon certain events. This relies upon exposure to credit risk. Funded positions have the risk exposure has the form of a payment, which is to be restored. The risk exists in that it may not be repaid. It is funding a party with the risk being a lack of repayment. This includes the bank and non-bank lending including syndicated loans. Two overarching forms of funded positions exist between debt and equity, and there are several ways to raise capital. This might be broken down into Bank loans (debt financing) and equity issuing (capital markets). Alternatively, a company may retain profits internally. This may be summarised as: * Equity Shares * Debt financing * Retained profits Few companies can use equity and retained profits entirely. It would not be good business to do so either; debt is a crucial aspect for corporate finance. This relates to the gearing advantages of taking on debt and maximising the value of debt-to-equity to allow equity to gain maximum returns.Benjamin, Financial Law (2007 OUP) Chapter 8, 149 Debt is repayable in accordance with the terms; whereas equity instruments, typically includes rights of shareholders, rights to receive reports, accounts, pre-emptions (where the company proposes issuing new shares), and the right to vote on strategic decisions affecting the company. Debt financing Bank lending may be categorised according to a large number of variables including the type of borrower, the purpose and the form of the loan facility. Where a bank makes a loan it will typically require a business plan and require security where it has credit concerns. A commitment letter may be produced during the negotiations for a loan. In general these are not legally binding. A loan facility is an agreement where a bank agrees to lend. It is distinct from the loan itself. Using a loan facility it writes to the bank and the bank makes the loan. LMA syndicated single currency term facility distinguishes between 1. commitment to lend to each lender, 2. average of each; and 3. the loan made under the agreement and the draw down. Three important forms of these are: * Overdraft facilitiesCunliffe Brooks v Blackburn and District Benefit BS (1884) * term loan facilitiesLORDSVALE FINANCE V BANK OF ZAMBIA [1996] 3 ALL ER 156 * revolving facilitiesGrupo Hotelero Urvasco SA v Carey Value Added [2013] EWHC 1039 (Comm) These may be further categorised into two overarching forms of bank lending, organised based on the term/repayment criteria of the loan. These are: * on-demand lending (overdraft and other short term) and;SHEPPARD & COOPER LTD V TSB BANK PLC (NO 2) P1996] BCC 965; [1996] 2 ALL ER 654 * committed lending (revolving facility or a term loan)CARLYLE v RBS [2015] UKSC 13 Economist and finance lawyers categories these and further categorise syndication separately but within committed lending. This has been a traditional driver for lending within the debt financing market. =On-demand lending= Where express terms state that it is repayable one demand, it will be so repayable even if both bank and borrower envisaged that it would be last for some time.Lloyds Bank v Lampert (1999) This must be an express term. In England & Wales, because of S6 Limitation Act 1980, time for repayment does not start running until the demand is made. This means that the debt, for example an overdraft, is not repayable without demand but will become repayable if requested; even if the parties thought it would not be repayable for some time.Titford Property Co v Cannon Street Acceptances (1975) distinguished for Lloyds Bank plc v Lampert (1999) In Sheppard & Cooper Ltd v TSB Bank Plc (No 2) [1996] BCC 965; [1996] 2 ALL ER 654, the plaintiff granted a fixed and floating charge over its assets. He then covenanted to pay or discharge indebtedness on- demand. At any time after indebtedness should become immediately payable, the debtor was authorised to appoint administrative receivers. Soon after a demand was made by the defendant. The plaintiff said that the best that could be done was repayment of half. The defendant appointed administrative receivers to recover the debt as outlined by the charge. The plaintiff sued and claimed claim the time was insufficient. The court held that; \\"It is physically impossible in most cases for a person to keep the money required to discharge the debt about his person. Must have had reasonable opportunity of implementing reasonable mechanics of payment he may need to employ to discharge the debt.\\" But a \\"reasonable time\\" overarching doctrine was found to be too commercially difficult. The courts have held short timelines as being more than sufficient to satisfy the request of on-demand. Walton J only accepted 45 minutes as being a reasonable period of time and in Cripps it was 60 minutes. Therefore the timing of repayment depends on circumstances but is, in commercial matters, extremely quick. If the sum demanded is of an amount which the debtor has, the time must be reasonable to enable the debtor to contact his bank and make necessary arrangements. However, if the party, as in Sheppard admits his inability to pay, Kelly CB believed that seizure was justified immediately stating \\"If personal service is made and the defendants may have seized immediately afterwards.\\"Sheppard & Cooper Ltd v TSB Bank Plc (No 2) [1996] BCC 965 Parties will want to avoid insolvency consequences. A bank will normally freeze a customers account when a winding up petition occurs to avoid dispositions within insolvency.in the Insolvency Act 1986 s127 limitations on dissipation of assets after winding-up. This was seen within Re Grays Inn's Construction Ltd (1980) A payment into an overdrawn account is probably a disposition of the company's property in favour of the bank. This is crucial differentiation as the money of an overdrawn account is going directly to a creditor. Payment into an account in credit is not a disposition of the company's property in favour of the bank, however.Re Barn Crown 1995 The bank makes a payment out of the company's account in accordance with a valid payment instruction - there is no disposition in favour of the bank.HOLLICOURT (CONTRACTS) LTD V BANK OF IRELAND (2001) As a result, banks traditionally freeze accounts and force insolvent parties to open new accounts. Overdraft An overdraft constitutes a loan, traditionally repayable on demand.RE HONE (1951) Ch 852 All per Harman J. It is a running account facility (categorising alongside revolving loans) where its on-demand nature of repayment meant immediately.LLOYDS BANK v LAMPERT [1999] 1 All ER (Comm) 161 A bank is only obliged to provide overdraft if the bank has expressly or impliedly agreed to do soCunliffe Brooks v Blackburn and District Benefit BS (1884) Legally, where a client overdraws his account, the client is not in breach of contract with the bank; if it did constitute a breach, then the fees charged by the bank would be penalties and corresponding not allowed.Parking Eye [2015] UKSC If requesting payment when there is no money in the bank account, the customer is merely requesting an overdraft.Lloyds bank plc v Independent Insurance Co Ltd [1998] EWCA Civ 1853 This should be noted that this is separate and distinct from credit cards; as credit cards invariably say a client must not go over the credit limit. With overdraft requests, the bank has the option not to comply with the request, although this is rare, as the banks reputation is built upon a willingness and ability to pay on behalf of clients.Barclays Bank v WJ Simms (1980) Often however, the bank complies and then charges a fee to ‚Äòcreate a loan'. OFT v Abbey National held that \\"if a bank does pay, customer has taken to have agreed to accept the bank's standards,\\" which means that they have asked and the bank has provided a loan. Banks may charge interest on an overdraft and may compound that interestKitchen HSBC Bank plc (2000) The point of an overdraft at law is that it is repayable on demand, however, payment instructions within the agreed overdraft limit must be honoured until notice has been given that the facility (the overdraft) is withdrawn.Rouse v Bradford Banking Co (1894) =Committed lending= A committed facility is where the bank is committed to lend throughout a certain period. * Term loan; all at once or in successive tranches. Can be repayable at once (bullet); or according to a payment scheme(amortising) * Revolving facility; borrow repay and reborrow. * swingline facility; Which is a committed facility providing for short term advances Most committed lending facilities will be documented, either by: * A facility letter or * A loan agreement These may be more or less complex, depending on the size of the loan. Oral assurance can give rise to an obligation to lend prior to any documentation being signed. ‚ÄòA statement made by a bank employee over the telephone that approval' had been given.CARLYLE v RBS [2015] UKSC 13. Most facility letters and loan agreements will contain contractual provisions designed to protect the lender against the credit risk of the borrower. This requires several aspects. Normally it will require conditions precedent, restrictions on the borrower's activities, information covenants, set-off provisions, stipulations for events of default. Lenders will also traditionally take real or personal security. These are designed to protect the lender against: # Non Payment of both interest and capital; and # Insolvency These two objectives are achieved by providing for events that make non-payment or insolvency unappealing or transfer the risk associated with said events to third party. This highlights the difference between risk as assessed and actual risk. Material adverse change clauses A common provision relates to material adverse change clauses. The borrow represents/warrants that there has been no material adverse change in its financial condition since the date of the loan agreement. This is a clause which is not often invoked or litigated and therefore the interpretation is uncertain and proof of breach is difficult. Consequences of wrongful invocation by the lender are severe. Interpretation depends on the terms of the particular clause and is up to lender to prove breach. Cannot be triggered on basis of things lender knew when making the agreement. Normally done by comparing borrower's accounts or other financial information then and now. Other compelling evidence may be enough. Will be material if it significantly affects the borrower's ability to repay the loan in question. We may examine one of the leading authorities on material adverse change clauses in committed lending, Grupo Hotelero Urvasco SA v Carey Value Added [2013] EWHC 1039 (Comm), per Blair J Therefore, a change will be material if it significantly affects the borrower's ability to repay the loan in question. Normally this is done by comparing borrower's accounts or other financial information then and now. =Net positions= A net position represents a financial position in which a debtor may \\"off-set\\" his obligation to the creditor with a mutual obligation which has arisen and is owed from the creditor to the debtor. In financial law, this may often take the form of a simple or funded position such as a securities lending transaction where mutual obligations set-off one another. Three crucial types of netting exists: *Novation Netting *Settlement Netting *Transaction Netting Each party can use its own claim against the other to discharge. Each party bears credit risk which may be offset. For example, a guarantor who is a depositor with a banking institution can set-off obligations he may owe to the bank under the guarantee against the bank's obligation to repay his deposited assets. =Asset-backed positions= Propriety securities like mortgages, charges, liens, pledges and retention of title clauses are financial positions which are collateralised using proprietary assets to mitigate the risk exposure of the collateral-taker. The core purpose it to Manage credit risk by identifying certain assets and ear- marking claims to those assets. =Combined positions= Combined positions use multiple facets of the other four positions, assembling them in various combinations to produce large, often complex, transactional structures. Examples of this category are primarily CDO's and other structured products. For example, a Synthetic collateralised debt obligations will draw upon derivatives, syndicated lending, and asset-backed positions to distinguish the risk of the reference asset from other risks. The law pertaining to CDOs is particularly noteworthy, primarily for its use of legal concepts such as legal personality, and risk transfer to develop new products. The prevalence and importance of combined positions within the financial markets, has meant that the legal underpinnings of the transactional structures are highly relevant to their enforcement and effectiveness.

He previously held positions at West Elm, J. C. Penney, May Company, Anthropologie, and Urban Outfitters.  Career  Brett began his career in merchandising with retailers J. C. Penney and May Company. He was the merchandise manager of the Anthropologie Home brand during 2003‚Äì2007. Danielle Sacks of Fast Company attributed a doubling of its sales to his introduction of a wide variety of international artisanal items to its offerings. Following Anthropologie, Brett became the chief merchandising officer for Urban Outfitters. Brett became president of West Elm in 2010. At the time, the brand had yet to turn a profit and was closing stores. He re-focused West Elm from machine-made goods to handmade textiles and merchandise, often made by local craftspeople around the world. During the period up to January 31, 2016 (which roughly corresponds with his time as its president), the West Elm brand reported double-digit revenue growth in 24 consecutive quarters. In 2012, Brett launched West Elm Market, a kitchen and home-goods store with a coffee shop serving La Colombe coffee, where at least 75% of the products are American made. Brett began the West Elm Local program in 2013, designed to give stores distinct regional identities by sourcing goods from local artisans. He also committed West Elm through the Clinton Global Initiative to pay $35 million through 2015 to artisans in 15 countries. Brett entered into an agreement with Fair Trade USA for third-party validation that its goods were being produced responsibly. In 2015, Brett expanded West Elm into contract furniture for offices through a new line of office furnishings called West Elm Workspace with a \\"residential aesthetic\\". Brett said in 2015 that by 2017, 20% of West Elm's goods would have a Fair Trade USA certification, increasing to 40% by 2019. In 2016, Brett said that West Elm was entering into the boutique hotel business, with locations in Detroit and Savannah, Georgia. opening in late 2018, followed by locations in Indianapolis, Minneapolis, and Charlotte, North Carolina. Brett, who is a gay-rights advocate, said he had \\"misgivings\\" about opening a hotel in North Carolina after the state passed its Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act, which eliminates anti-discrimination protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and genderqueer (LGBTQ) people in public accommodations and mandates that persons in government buildings are only allowed to use restrooms and changing facilities that correspond to the sex identified on their birth certificate. However, he said he ultimately decided that \\"the best way to effect change is to be there and be part of that change\\". Brett was named to the board of directors at Cole Haan LLC in January, 2016.  Non-profit activities  Brett is on the advisory board of Nest, an organization that promotes business development for artisans and home workers operating in the informal economy outside of factory environments. He is also involved in the Human Rights Campaign, an advocacy group promoting civil rights for LGBTQ persons. Brett was the largest individual fund raiser for the 2015 AIDS Walk New York.  Personal life  Brett is married to Ed Gray (who formerly operated a home furnishing store in Philadelphia) and lives in Brooklyn, New York City. In 2013, The New York Times published a photo essay tour of Brett and Gray's loft in a converted industrial building in Dumbo, Brooklyn.  Honors  He received Interior Design Magazine's \\"Greater Good\\" award in 2016, in recognition of his efforts to support small-scale artisanal craft production, financial and literacy education, \\"fair trade\\" practices, and sustainable business development.

It covers the years 1095‚Äì1131 and must have been mostly compiled around 1130.Or \\"towards the year 1130\\", as in John France, \\"The Use of the Anonymous Gesta Francorum in the Early Twelfth-Century Sources for the First Crusade,\\" in Alan V. Murray, ed., From Clermont to Jerusalem: The Crusades and Crusader Societies, 1095‚Äì1500 (Turnhout: Brepols, 1998), 29‚Äì42. It is sometimes called the \\"Monte Cassino Chronicle\\" for simplicity.Nirmal Dass (ed.), The Deeds of the Franks and Other Jerusalem- Bound Pilgrims: The Earliest Chronicle of the First Crusades (Rowman & Littlefield, 2011), p. 119. The Historia belli sacri is based in large part on the equally anonymous Gesta Francorum et aliorum Hierosolimitanorum and also incorporating fragments from the Historia Francorum qui ceperunt Iherusalem, the Gesta Tancredi and other unknown texts.John France, \\"Note sur le manuscrit 6041 A du fonds latin de la Biblioth√®que nationale: un nouveau fragment d'un manuscrit de l'Historia Belli Sacri\\", Biblioth√®que de l'√©cole des chartes 126:2 (1968), 413‚Äì16. Although heavily reliant on the Gesta Francorum, it is an important source for the Italo-Norman crusaders.John France, Victory in the East: A Military History of the First Crusade (Cambridge: 1994), 379; see also pp. 163, 166, 244‚Äì45. Like the history of Robert the Monk and Guibert of Nogent's Dei gesta per Francos, both of which were used as sources by its anonymous author, the Historia belli sacri is \\"a serious and careful effort to rework the Gesta story and add to it significant information which is not found in any other source.\\"France (1998), 37. It was, after all, \\"written in an age when there were still survivors of the First Crusade.\\"France (1998), 38‚Äì39. Manuscripts For a long time the only known manuscript of the Historia belli sacri was to be found in the library of Montecassino. It was first edited by Jean Mabillon for his Museum Italicum (Paris, 1687). This edition was re-published in the Recueil des historiens des croisades under the rubric Tudebodus imitatus et continuatus, since it was regarded by the editors as an \\"imitation\\" and \\"continuation\\" of Petrus Tudebodus' Historia de Hierosolymitano itinere. A second fragment of the Historia belli sacri was discovered in Latin manuscript 6041 A of the Biblioth√®que nationale de France. This fourteenth-century Italian manuscript once belonged to Fran√ßois Roger de Gaigni√®res. The catalogue of the Biblioth√®que's Latin section, published in 1774, lists the third document of MS 6041 A as \\" a history of Jerusalem by Pons of Baladun and Raymond, canon of Le Puy\\" (Pontii de Baladuno et Raimundi, canonici Podiensis, Historia Hierosolymitana). The actual third document in the MS is not only a copy of the Historia Francorum qui ceperunt Iherusalem, usually attributed to Pons of Baladun and Raymond of Aguilers, but rather a compilation, by an unknown editor, of portions of three distinct works: the Historia Francorum (for the period up to the siege of Antioch), the Historia belli sacri (for the period from there to the conquest of Ramla) and the Gesta Francorum (for the period from Ramleh to the battle of Ascalon). Contents The Historia belli's section begins with this account of the crusaders' arrival at Antioch: > On the next day, they came as far as Antioch, at midday, on the fourth day > of the week, which is the twelfth kalends of November [21 October], and > miraculously we besieged the gates of the city. Crastina autem die, > pervenerunt usque ad Antiochiam, ad medietatem diei, in quarta feria, quod > est duodecimo kalendas Novembris, et obsedimus mirabiliter portas civitatis. Of the contemporary histories of the First Crusade, the Historia belli sacri provides the most information on the negotiations between the Crusaders and the Fatimid Caliphate. The Historia is also the only source to go into detail concerning Bohemond of Taranto's exceptionally long journey through the Balkans to Constantinople, which took six months with a comparatively small army, and after which he lodged in the suburb of Sancti Argenti for some time. It also records how at the beginning of the siege of Antioch, the local governor, Yaghi-Siyan, expelled the Christians from the city, and how a certain Hilary, a Muslim convert to Christianity, betrayed the Crusaders by divulging their weaknesses to the relieving army of Radwan of Aleppo, only to be killed when the army was driven off. Several of the Historia‚Ä≤s accounts are more fanciful. It places all the leaders of the Crusade at the Council of Clermont, although they were certainly not all there. It also has them begging Pope Urban II to lead them personally. It says that at the siege of Antioch a miraculous image of Christ that could not be pierced by Turkish arrows appeared in the cathedral. More credibly, it says that after the siege, the Christian women of the city went to release the imprisoned Patriarch of Antioch, John VII, only to find that he could not stand, his legs having been weakened by so long a confinement. The chronicle ends with the death of Prince Bohemond II of Antioch.

It published record breaking results on the Transaction Processing Performance Council's TPC-H benchmark for database sizes of 100 GB, 300 GB, 1 TB and 3 TB on non-clustered hardware. Vectorwise originated from the X100 research project carried out within the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI, the Dutch National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science) between 2003 and 2008. It was spun off as a start-up company in 2008, and acquired by Ingres Corporation in 2011. It was released as a commercial product in June, 2010, initially for 64-bit Linux platform, and later also for Windows. Starting from 3.5 release in April 2014, the product name was shortened to \\"Vector\\". In June 2014, Actian Vortex was announced - clustered MPP version of Vector, working in Hadoop with storage in HDFS. Actian Vortex was later renamed to Actian Vector in Hadoop. Technology The basic architecture and design principles of the X100 engine of the VectorWise database were well described in two Phd theses of VectorWise founders Marcin ≈ªukowski: \\"Balancing Vectorized Query Execution with Bandwidth-Optimized Storage\\" and Sandor H√©man: \\"Updating Compressed Column Stores\\", under supervision of another founder, professor Peter Boncz. The X100 engine has been integrated with Ingres SQL front-end, making the database operatable using the Ingres SQL syntax, and Ingres set of client and DBA tools. The query execution architecture makes use of \\"Vectorized Query Execution\\" processing in chunks of cache-fitting vectors of data. This allows to involve the principles of vector processing and single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) to perform the same operation on multiple data simultaneously and exploit data level parallelism on modern hardware. It also reduces overheads found in traditional \\"row-at-a-time processing\\" found in most RDBMSes. The database storage is in a compressed column-oriented format, with scan-optimised buffer manager. In Actian Vortex in HDFS the same proprietary format is used. Loading big amounts of data is supported through direct appends to stable storage, while small transactional updates are supported through patent-pending Positional Delta Trees (PDTs) specialized B-tree-like structures of indexed differences on top of stable storage, which are seamlessly patched during scans, and which are transparently propagated to stable storage in a background process. The method of storing differences in patch-like structures and rewriting the stable storage in bulk made it possible to work in a filesystem like HDFS, in which files are append-only. History =Milestones= A comparative Transaction Processing Performance Council TPC-H performance test of MonetDB carried out by its original creator at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in 2003 showed room for improvement in its performance as an analytical database. As a result, CWI researchers proposed a new architecture using pipelined query processing (\\"vectorised processing\\") to improve the performance of analytical queries. This led to the creation of the \\"X100\\" project, with the intention of designing a new kernel for MonetDB, to be called \\"MonetDB/X100\\". The X100 project team won the 2007 DaMoN Best Paper Award for the paper \\"Vectorized Data Processing on the Cell Broadband Engine\\" as well as the 2008 DaMoN Best Paper Award for the paper \\"DSM vs. NSM: CPU Performance Tradeoffs in Block- Oriented Query Processing\\". In August 2009 the originators for the X100 project then won the \\"Ten Year Best Paper Award\\" at the 35th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases(VLDB) for their 1999 paper \\"Database architecture Optimized for the new bottleneck: Memory access\\". It was recognised by the VLDB that the project team had made great progress in implementing the ideas contained in the paper over the previous 10 years. The central premise of the paper is that traditional relational database systems were designed in the late 1970s and early 1980s during a time when database performance was dictated by the time required to read from and write data to hard disk. At that time available CPU was relatively slow and main memory was relatively small, so that very little data could be loaded into memory at a time. Over time hardware improved, with CPU speed and memory size doubling roughly every two years in accordance with Moore‚Äôs law, but that the design of traditional relational database systems had not adapted. The CWI research team described improvements in database code and data structures to make best use of modern hardware. In 2008 the X100 project was spun off from MonetDB as a separate project in its own right, and renamed \\"VectorWise\\". Co-founders included Peter A. Boncz and Marcin ≈ªukowski. In June 2010, the VectorWise technology was officially announced by Ingres Corporation, with the release of Ingres VectorWise 1.0. In March 2011, VectorWise 1.5 was released, publishing a record breaking result on TPC-H 100 GB benchmark. New features included parallel query execution (single query executed on multiple CPU cores), improved bulk loading and enhanced SQL support. In June 2011, VectorWise 1.6 was released, publishing record breaking results on TPC-H 100 GB, 300 GB and 1 TB non-clustered benchmark. In December 2011, VectorWise 2.0 was released with new SQL support for analytical functions such as rank and percentile and enhanced date, time and timestamp datatypes, and support for disk spilling in hash joins and aggregation. In June 2012, VectorWise 2.5 was released. In this release storage format was reorganized to allow storing the database in multiple location, the background update propagation mechanism from PDTs to stable storage was enhanced to allow rewriting only the changed blocks instead of full rewrites, and a new patented Predictive Buffer Manager (PBM) was introduced. In March 2013, VectorWise 3.0 was released. New features included more efficient storage engine, support for more data types and analytical SQL functions, enhanced DDL features, and improved monitoring and profiling accessibility. In March 2014, Actian Vector 3.5 was released, with a new rebranded and shortened name. New features included support for partitioned tables, improved disk spilling, online backup capabilities and improved SQL support - e.g. \`MERGE/UPSERT\` DML operations and \`FIRST_VALUE\` and \`LAST_VALUE\` window aggregation functions. In March 2015 Actian Vector 4 was released =Cluster Solution= In June 2014 at Hadoop Summit 2014 in San Jose Actian announced Actian Vortex clustered MPP version of Vector, with same level of SQL support working in Hadoop with storage directly in HDFS. Actian Vortex has since been released, later renamed to Actian Vector in Hadoop, and non-clustered Actian Vector releases are also updated to match. Actian Vector in Hadoop 4 was released in December 2015. =Expanding to the Cloud= In April 2019, Actian Avalanche was released as the cloud option for the high- performance Actian Vector.

History Thuruthur is a small hill also known as Mount Sinai by the early Jews who came to Crangannore from the Middle East for the spice trade. From early Jewish historic documents and from the name \\"Mount Sinai\\", it is believed that a synagogue existed there as a place of worship for the merchants. It is believed traditionally that St. Thomas visited this place called Mount Sinai for prayers, after landing in Musiris (Kodungalloor). St. Thomas preached the gospel of Jesus in this area and spread the good news to the surrounding areas. After the assassination of Thomas by a Hindu fanatic, the Christian communities established by St. Thomas flourished all over Kerala and different parts of India. On the site of the present church there was a small shrine which was made with palm leaves by an early believer called Raphael Kunnathur (Kunnumpuram Raphael). This occurred in the time of Ambazhakkad Forane, of Syrian Christians. Later during the times of Latinisation, it was added as a sub-station to Thuruthipuram Parish, and hence become a Latin church. One night, it is reported, people of the area (early Christians) heard the bells of the church chiming and as they came to the church they saw a powerful divine aura around the head of the statue of St. Thomas. The property, previously owned by the Kunnumpuram family, was registered to the Church only in 1990s, during the administrative period of Rev Fr Michael Thaleketty. The renovated church as seen today was constructed under the leadership of Rev Fr Jaiju Elenjikkal. Healing well There is a widespread tradition in this locality that when St. Thomas came to this hill, Mount Sinai, he found a miraculous spring which in later years became a well, which never dries even in the scorching summer of South India. There are many stories of healing effected by water from this well. People of different faiths also come in the hope of receiving a blessing by contact with the well water.

From 1921 to 1942, Graham collected and sent to the Smithsonian Institution nearly 400,000 zoological specimens, including more than 230 new species and 9 new genera, of which 29 were named after him (see below). From 1932 to 1942 he was curator of the Museum of Art, Archeology and Ethnology at the West China Union University, which still stands as part of Sichuan University, in Chengtu. There, he taught comparative religions at the Theological College, and archeology and anthropology at the University. He wrote extensively and spent his retirement years, from 1950 to 1961, in Englewood, Colorado compiling his writings and research into three books that were published by the Smithsonian Institution. McKhann refers to Graham as \\"One of a handful of Western missionaries whose scientific work was respected by other scientists‚Äîand of even fewer scientists whose religious work was respected by other missionaries.\\" Early life and education Graham was born in Green Forest, Arkansas on March 21, 1884 to William Edward Graham (20 February 1841 - 28 March 1904) and Elizabeth Belinda (Atchley) Graham (14 August 1844 - 28 August 1888). His family moved to Walla Walla, Washington when he was a small child, and he grew up there. When he was 4 years old, his mother died of TB, and his older sister Elmina Elizabeth Graham (13 August 1876 - 4 July 1962), who had just turned 12, raised him. Elmina was a strong believer in education and supported David through his educationPersonal communication from Harriet-Jane Graham Hoogendyk (she herself received a B.A. from Whitman College, 1908, an M.A. from University of Washington, 1921, and became an Associate Professor and Dean of Kansas State Teachers College). Graham entered Whitman College in 1904 and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1908. He then entered Rochester Theological Seminary where he studied under and was influenced by Walter Rauschenbusch. He completed his studies for the Bachelor of Divinity in 1911. Graham was ordained at the First Baptist Church in Fairport, New York, joined the American Baptist Foreign Mission Society, and sailed for China in September 1911 with his wife Alicia Morey Graham (whom he had married in 1910). He spent the next 37 years in China with periodic returns to the U.S. on furlough to further his education. On his return from 1918 to 1919, he entered the School of Divinity at the University of Chicago and completed a Master of Arts. His thesis reflected his growing interest in the Chinese and their religions and was influenced by Eustace Haydon who was head of the Department of Comparative Religions. It was also during this trip that he began correspondence with, and then visited, the United States National Museum. There he received training and made arrangements to collect natural history specimens for them. Graham returned to the U.S. again from 1926 to 1927 to complete a Ph.D. at the University of Chicago. This time his dissertation reflected his ongoing research and studies in China and was subsequently published by the Smithsonian Institution. Graham returned to the U.S. again at the end of 1930. He spent 1931 studying archeology with Fay- Cooper Cole at the University of Chicago and in the same year received an honorary Doctor of Science from Whitman College. He then went on to Harvard University where he studied anthropology and archaeology theory under Alfred Tozzer and Earnest Hooton as well as linguistics under R.B. Dixon. On his return to China in September, 1932, Graham moved from Suifu to Chengtu and joined the faculty of the West China Union University. There he taught anthropology and archaeology and served as curator of the Museum of Archaeology, Art, and Ethnology. He also taught comparative religions at the Theological Seminary. China, 1911-1948 The years that Graham was in China, 1911-1948, were marked by instability and turbulence. They began with the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty in 1911 (see Xinhai Revolution) while Graham was in transit from the United States and ended with the formation of the People's Republic of China in 1949 following the Chinese Communist Revolution, which concluded less than a year after Graham retired and returned to the United States. The Graham's houseboat on the Yangtze in 1920. Trackers pulling a houseboat through rapids on the Yangtze in 1913. Szechwan Province in West China was remote from the central government (normally in Nanking), and required a two-month trip up the Yangtze River to reach Suifu. The Western Provinces were ruled by warlords and were rife with bandits in the countryside. There were revolts in the West when Yuan Shikai declared himself emperor in 1915, and Yunnan Province invaded Szechwan. Suifu (where Graham was stationed) is on the Yangtze river near the border of Yunnan and was occupied by Yunnan troops. Throughout most of this period of time, there were conflicts with the Japanese. The Japanese declared war on Germany early in World War I and had a large contingent in Versailles to participate in treaty negotiations. The resulting Treaty of Versailles in 1919 awarded Germany's holdings in the Pacific, North of the equator, including Shandong, China, to Japan. This led to outrage among the Chinese and to the May Fourth Movement protesting imperialism and instigating violence against westerners. The 1920s was an ongoing period of instability and warlordism. Both Sun Yat-sen and Yuan Shikai died. Chiang Kai-shek consolidated power through the Northern Expedition against warlords in 1926 to 1928, but never really controlled all of China. The Nanking Incident in 1927 again demonstrated Chinese hostility toward imperialist powers. The Chinese Communist Revolution was underway in the late 1920s, and the Japanese invaded Manchuria in 1931. Both of these hostilities continued, and Japan declared all out war on China in 1937. The Chinese Nationalist government was relocated to Chungking in Szechwan Province, and many students and faculty evacuated from Eastern Universities were relocated to Chengdu, where Graham was from 1932 to 1948. Chengdu itself was bombed by the Japanese as early as 1938. Meanwhile, the Soviet Union was engaged in military action in Xinjiang. Around 1942, Japan had taken over IndoChina and Burma, completely cutting off western China, except for flights over the Himalayas. As World War II was coming to a close, the Soviet Union invaded Manchuria. In the aftermath of the War, Chiang Kai-shek was severely weakened, the Chinese economy was ruined, inflation was rampant, and the Communist Revolution was gaining strength. The era of the Republic of China ended on the mainland, and the era of the People's Republic of China began in 1949. During the years that Graham was in China, there were numerous incidents in which foreigners, and sometimes missionaries or Christians in particular, were the targets of violence. The May Fourth Movement and the Nanking Incident were prominent examples (the Boxer Rebellion antedated his time in China). The Communist's animosity toward Christianity also resulted in killings (see for example, Murder of John and Betty Stam). Graham himself was held captive by Communist troops in 1933, but managed to talk his way out. There was also widespread violence in the countryside by bandits and brigands. Graham typically had to hire military guards on his field trips and nevertheless had many narrow escapes. Ministry and mission Graham came from humble and difficult beginnings, but also from a long line of devout Christians with many Baptist ministers among his forebears. He was active in the Baptist Church as a young person and, while he was an undergraduate at Whitman College, decided to become a missionary. He then attended Rochester Theological Seminary where he was influenced by Walter Rauschenbusch. His mission in life was that of a Christian Humanist. He was determined not just to spread the word of God, but to help others wherever possible. While missionary work was the reason Graham went to China, it is the least well documented of the many facets of his contributions. There are some letters published in the Fairport County Mail, and there are some references from authors who had access to his unpublished memoirs. 1911-1918 Graham spent a year in the western districts of Shaoshing learning the language and customs of China. He was then assigned to Suifu, a two-month journey up the Yangtze River, where he was stationed until 1918. During this time ... Because of his heroic actions in the field of fire, treating wounded soldiers and negotiating for peace, he was awarded both the Red Cross Medal by the Chinese Red Cross and a Decoration of the First Order for Bravery by the Governor of Yunnan Province. Second term in Suifu 1919-1926 Third term in Suifu alone 1927-1931 First term in Chengtu 1932-1939 Second term in Chengtu 1940-1948 (year in Washington state) In his retirement years (1950‚Äì1961) in Englewood, Colorado, Graham was a member of the First Baptist Church of Denver and was a leader in the Social Action Committee. Among other things, he was one of the first to encourage exchanges between the black and white Churches of Denver. Later on, Graham worked with William Reginald Morse to pool donations together for the medical anthropology at the Peabody. Chinese Name Graham was given the Chinese name ËëõÁ∂≠Êº¢ (simplified Chinese: ËëõÁª¥Ê±â, Wade-Giles: Ge Weihan), which is a translation of Graham. However, there are a number of different ways Graham could have been translated. The specific choice of a Chinese name is influenced by the additional meanings of the symbols. In this case, Á∂≠ with Êº¢ has the meaning: Protector of the Han, or Protector of the Chinese People. While there doesn't appear to be any record of the origin of this choice, it seems to fit with his first term in Suifu and his humanitarian efforts during the civil war between Yunnan and Szechwan, for which he received the Red Cross Medal from the Chinese Red Cross and later (in 1920) received a decoration of the first order from the governor of Yunnan for bravery. Natural history collections Graham first made formal arrangements with the National Museum of Natural History (NMNH) at the Smithsonian on his furlough to the U.S. during 1918 and 1919. While in China, from then until 1948, he spent his vacations and summers traveling and collecting zoological specimens for the Smithsonian. Anthropology, ethnology and archeology D.C. Graham investigating a prehistoric site near Tao Fu, in the Si-Kang region. D.C. Graham's image on the History Wall at Sichuan University, Chengdu, China. (Break this down and include comparative religion?) Species named after D.C. Graham D.C. Graham began collecting zoological specimens for the United States National Museum (the Smithsonian Institution) after 1919 and continued collecting in Szechuan Province and Tibet on his vacations and summers until he left China in 1948. Around the time of his death in 1961, several sources stated that Graham had collected nearly 400,000 specimens from which were identified over 230 new species and 9 new genera. Of those, 29 were named after him. While the number of specimens he collected remains fixed, the other numbers have changed over time. The specimens Graham collected are still being studied, and new species have been named at least as recently as 2009. The Smithsonian's digitized collection catalog, while by no means complete, is the best overall source. Specimens Graham collected are tagged \\"D.C. Graham.\\" Entering that (in quotes) for the Smithsonian's search term currently (as of 14 December 2011) turns up 540 taxonomic type specimens of which 348 are holotypes. Careful searches turn up 60 species and a genus (Grahamomyia bicellula Alexander, 1935) named after Graham. But even this is not up to date. Ahrens, in a review of the genus Serica, found 4 new species among Graham's specimens and named one of them after Graham (Serica (Serica) grahami). In a subsequent analysis, Ahrens named 4 more species of Serica based on Graham's specimens. These latter 4 have yet to show up in the Smithsonian collection catalog (access date 14 December 2011). D.C. Graham collected primarily in Szechwan Province, around Suifu, Chengtu, and on trips to the Szechuan highlands, the West China borderlands, and into Tibet. There was a Rev. John Graham who collected at least from 1900 to 1920 primarily from Yunnan Province, with specimens cited as being from Yunnanfu and Wutingchow District. There are a number of species (particularly fish, some snakes and Rana grahami) that were named after John Graham. To say that a species is named after D.C. Graham, the type specimen should have been collected by him, from the areas he collected, during the dates he collected, and be in the Smithsonian. Otherwise, there should be an explicit statement in the publication in which it was named. There are also instances in which specimens are reclassified, resulting in changes in names. The following are ordered alphabetically by taxonomic classification. For example, Animalia Arthropoda comes before Animalia Chordata. Links to Wikispecies and to the Smithsonian should show full classification and references as well as historical synonyms resulting from reclassifications.

History  The first May Day protests originated in several countries throughout Europe including Stockholm, Madrid, London, Brussels, and Geneva in 1890. While the demand for an 8-hour workday was the primary concern that protesters were protesting for, other demands included improved working conditions, universal suffrage, peace among nations, and international solidarity. While it originally started as a labor movement in protest for improved wages and working conditions, protesters - who are primarily from working-class backgrounds - now demonstrate for celebratory purposes and tradition while many others do it to create change. Over the decades, the May Day protests and demonstrations have expanded globally and internationally to other countries including Canada, Indonesia, and Taiwan. The protests are also a part of the Occupy Movement, a movement dedicated to protesting against capitalism and the corruption of corporations and to finding solidarity within labor unions and other activist groups. North America = Canada = Protesters in Canada demonstrated to bring awareness about the impact that federal government budget cuts had on employment and job loss. The protest in Montreal also turned violent as more than 100 people were arrested during the protest. =United States= Voice of America report on New York City May Day protests. Protests were held from coast to coast in major cities including New York City, San Francisco, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Atlanta. Protests were often organized by Occupy movement. Turnout was lower than that of other countries because the protests were held on a work day. * New York City ‚Äì There were rallies protesting Wall Street, banks, and major institutions. A march to Bank of America was led by Occupy Wall Street. There were also protests of New York University's expansion into Greenwich Village. At least 50 people were arrested. Occupy Wall Street had called for a general strike, which did not materialize. * San Francisco ‚Äì Protesters disrupted ferry service. * Oakland, California ‚Äì Protests were dispersed by police with the use of tear gas. * Seattle - Protesters in Seattle, who primarily consisted of teens and young adults in their early 20s, demonstrated to call the end to capitalism. The protests in Seattle got violent as windows and glass panels were shattered and smoke bombs were set off. Asia =Indonesia= Thousands of protesters marched through the capital demanding higher wages and better working conditions. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono responded by announcing a higher tax-free income ceiling and additional subsidized housing. = Philippines = Protesters gathered in Manila to demand higher wages and policies to prevent workers from termination. =Taiwan= Protesters in Taiwan marched through the streets of downtown Taiwan to demand for a number of things including higher wages, lower school tuition, and better conditions for foreign workers.

The first two performers act out the scene while the other two act as residents of the different locations. The others must then try to guess where they are. Only played on the Jane Seymour episode. *Messages From Random Acquaintances - The performers provide rapid-fire messages to the guest as if they were friends and acquaintances of the guest and alternate when Fred buzzes. This game is usually done during the credits. *Musical Tribute - With the help of keyboardist Cat Gray (who works with Wayne and Jonathan on Let's Make a Deal), the performers sing a song about the guest's life in a style suggested by Fred. Similar to \\"Song for a Lady\\" from Improv-a-Ganza. *Putting Words into Your Mouth - The guest takes the stage with one or two of the comedians, another of the comedians will talk for the guest while the scene continues.

Similar to \\"Kick It!\\" from Improv-a- Ganza. *Shorter and Shorter - The performers have sixty seconds to perform a scene, then they have to do the same scene again in a thirty-second version, and then fifteen seconds, and so on. *Sideways Scene - Three of the performers use information from the guest to act out a scene lying down on a special mat behind the set with a camera positioned above them. Fred would randomly buzz in with styles for them to act it out in. This sketch is usually done when the celebrity's story involves sports. This game was later played in the 2013 revival of Whose Line? *Styles - The performers act out a scene using information given by the guest. When Fred presses a button to sound a buzzer, he has the performers restart the scene in a different style.

Marker, who was originally a farmer, worked within the confectionery industry in Chicago, Illinois, for many years. However, Marker invented a new machine used to process cornmeal. The machine caught the attention of Marker's business partner, W. T. Hawkins. Together, Marker and Hawkins moved to Canada and founded the W. T.

Marker and Hawkin originally started their new company in Tweed, Ontario, to take advantage of the areas railroads to ship their Cheezies. A fire destroyed their original Tweed factory in 1956, and they relocated to their company's current location in Belleville, Ontario. They concentrated exclusively on Cheezies after dropping other snack foods from their portfolio. Marker designed the machine used to create Cheezies, which shaped the snacks, cooked them in vegetable shortening, and coated the snacks with aged cheddar. No two Cheezies pieces are exactly alike. Marker's original machine is still used to manufacture Cheezies at the company's plant, as of 2012. Marker remained Vice President of the W. T. Hawkin Company until his death in 2012. He last visited the Cheezies factory for a surprise inspection in March 2012. Outside of the snack food industry, Marker established the Belleville Aerodrome in Ontario in 1961.

To interpret this theme, Carpeaux elected to use four life-size female figures supporting a globe and representing different races as continents. The Indianapolis bronze is a preparatory work for Africa, presented as a bust rather than a full-length figure. A terracotta copy of The Negress is located in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Description The Negress portrays a woman who is the personification of the continent of Africa. Carpeaux wanted to use her to emphasize the horrors of slavery, creating the piece 3 years after the Civil War of the United States had ended and twenty years after slavery was banned in all French and Danish colonies.Robert William Fogel and Stanley L.

Miraglia-Gulotti is considered an '. Biography Miraglia-Gulotti was born to a Roman Catholic family in Ucria, Sicily, in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. Miraglia-Gulotti was a professor at the seminary of Patti at 19, was ordained a priest at 22, then a student at the University of Palermo. Miraglia-Gulotti was censured in Sicily for his preaching. Miraglia-Gulotti, a priest from Ucria, Sicily, had been called to Rome early in 1895 by his friend, Monsignor Isidoro Carini, Perfect of the Vatican Library, to assist him in a new periodical, the ', Carini was an advocate of reconciliation between the Holy See and the Kingdom of Italy. Carini died suddenly, on , rumored by poison, and the periodical was abandoned. In the spring of the same year, 1895, Miraglia-Gulotti was sent to Piacenza, in Northern Italy, to preach the May sermons in honor of Mary; there he was embroiled in a series of either scandals or conspiracies. \\"It would be interesting to relate [...] the dramatic details of the conspiracies. But I leave them to the curious students of press and police reports. They are remarkably unpleasant reading. For my present purpose it is sufficient to speak of Miraglia now as a free man,\\" wrote Paulina Irby, in National Review and noted that she omitted, among other events, \\"his terrible denunciations of the Jesuits\\" and the opening of his , Chiesa Italiana Internationale, which began in a former stable of an old palazzo with church furnishing principally provided by Mazzini's niece, \\"and with much else that is expressive of loyal and national feeling, and which is not to be seen in any other place of worship with which I am acquainted in Italy.\\" His congregation had just that church, and \\"is spoken of contemptuously as the congregation of Signor Abbate's stable\\", she wrote, as the Abbate family own the palazzo. On , Miraglia, who resided in Piacenza but was a priest of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Patti, Sicily, was excommunicated for, what was called, his \\"incredible, audacious, and obstinant scandals which long troubled the Roman Catholic Diocese of Piacenza-Bobbio\\". That year, Nevin introduced in The Churchman the \\"modern Savonarola\\", Nevin wrote \\"he has placed himself under wise guidance, and will not be apt to do anything rashly or ignorantly\\" but failed to include any specifics. The following week, The Churchman only hinted at the secular side of that movement by publishing a story from Milan's Corriere della Sera which wrote: \\"The struggle is now not only religlious, but civic. The partisans of the bishop will hear of no truce with the partisans of Miraglia, and whenever they can, remove them from the employments that they hold.\\" Within a year, on , he attended the Union of Utrecht's 4th International Old Catholic Congress in Vienna. According to The Guardian, Miraglia's \\"adherants declared themselves to be the Chiesa Autonoma Italo-Internazionale\\" on October 21, 1897, after Miraglia returned from the International Old Catholic Congress in Vienna. He founded a weekly newspaper, titled Girolamo Savonarola, which he used as his organ. By 1900, two reformation groups in Italy elected bishops for their churches: one group in Arrone elected Campello as its bishop and the other group in Piacenza elected Miraglia as its bishop. Campello made at least four visits to England where he was received at gatherings in Lambeth Palace, by the Archbishop of Canterbury, and in Fulham Palace, by the Bishop of London. He was licensed in 1883 by Bishop Abram Newkirk Littlejohn, of the Episcopal Diocese of Long Island, to work as a priest \\"wherever there may be lawful opportunity\\" for Campello's reformation efforts in Italy, and by that time, Nevin already knew Campello for many years. Campello was elected bishop by a synod of his church in 1893 and asked Herzog for consecration, who in turn brought Campello's case to the International Old Catholic Bishops' Conference (IBC). The refused to consecrate Campello in 1901, according to Oeyen, \\"because of his limited number of baptisms and marriages and his close relationships with Anglicans, Methodists, and Waldenses\\". The Church of Utrecht thought Campello was too Protestant. Miraglia, by then a leader of reform in northern Italy, wrote to Joseph Ren√© Vilatte regarding the movement and consecration. On , while the Holy See examined Vilatte's case, Vilatte consecrated Miraglia in Piacenza; Brandeth wrote that Vilatte \\"started what he [Vilatte] called an 'Italian National Episcopal Church' at Milan, and for this purpose consecrated [...] Miraglia Gulotti as 'Bishop of Piacenza',\\" Miraglia was a popular speaker known for his relations with Ferdinando Bracciforti, who represented Milanese liberal Protestantism. According to Peter-Ben Smit, in Old Catholic and Philippine Independent Ecclesiologies in History, \\"the orders of ' in general, and specifically those of [...] Miraglia, and of all those consecrated by them, are not recognized, and all connections with these persons is formally denied\\" by the . On , the Congregation of Universal Inquisition declared that major excommunication was incurred by both Miraglia and Vilatte. The next day, , the Alexandria Gazette reported that his anti- Catholicism offended the sensibilities of an American Methodist Episcopal Church in Rome that the \\"majority of the Protestant congregation interrupted\\" his discourse \\"with angry protests against his abuse of the pulpit and the police were finally called to prevent an open riot.\\" In 1901, Tony Andr√© Florence, in a report about the liberal movement in Italy presented to the International Council of Unitarian and Other Liberal Religious Thinkers and Workers in London, wrote that Miraglia's \\"desire to be at the head of a personal movement, after separating him from the Old Catholics whose ideas were akin to his, threw him suddenly into a false path.\\" His consecration by Vilatte \\"lost him the sympathy of many, and his profession of faith completed their disappointment.\\" Florence wrote that Miraglia's \\"reformatory movement, therefore, is now in suspense,\\" after he was obliged to refuge abroad. Alt URL While the reported, in The Times, that although the \\"discreditable incident\\" of Miraglia \\"having arrogated to himself the dignity\\" of bishop-elect and his consecration happened, the work of the \\"real bishop-elect\\", Campello, was going on independently, with headquarters at Rome. It is unclear if the two juxtaposed groups were concurrent factions of one movement. After the Italian Court of Cassation had upheld a sentence of three years in prison for various earlier judgments, Miraglia fled to Switzerland and then London. He was lecturing in England . His church in Piacenza was disbanded in 1901. In 1904, the refused to recognize Miraglia's consecration as valid when he presented himself to the sixth International Old Catholic Congress in Olten, Switzerland. Here, the name Tichy is spelled Tichi and the name Vilatte is spelled Villatte. Already a convicted fugitive who evaded Italian justice, Miraglia was then involved with religious associations in France. For example, a parish church in Piedigriggio, Corsica, was confiscated by the government from the Roman Catholic Diocese of Ajaccio and devolved to a religious association formed on . The parish's priest disappeared after he signed a declaration of adherence to the sect. From May, 1907, Jacques Forcioli, a Miraglia ordained priest working for that religious association, conducted schismatic services. In November, a lawsuit was filed by a replacement priest appointed to serve the parish by the Bishop of Ajaccio, against the mayor and Forcioli, demanding the restitution of the church. The court rendered a judgment which condemned the mayor, declared that religious association illegal, and ordered restoration of the property to the 's priest. Miraglia intended to ordain a priest for Christmas there; but he fled and evaded a French deportation order against him on Christmas Eve. A few days later Forcioli was arrested for stealing items from the church; the mayor and members of the sect were arrested for complicity. Fearing assassination, the mayor refused to implement the restitution on . Finally, the Court of Appeal in Bastia dismissed Forcioli and restored exclusive possession of the Piedigriggio church property back to the 's priest. On , La Croix emphasized that the scope of the Bastia decision was of special importance, not only because it was the first judgment on the subject, but also because of the principles of law it invoked. Vilatte and Miraglia united in a joint effort, and except for the brief interval, , when Vilatte unsuccessfully attempted to organize a religious association in France, their work had chiefly been in the Midwestern United States. According to Thomas E. Watson, in Watson's Jeffersonian Magazine, after being \\"arrested like a common criminal\\" Miraglia was deported from the United States, on , \\"as though he were [...] an enemy to society.\\" Two days before his deportation, the New York Times reported that Miraglia, \\"self-appointed head\\" of the Catholic Independent Church of Rome, was detained on Ellis Island \\"on the charge that he is an undesirable citizen\\" after being apprehended in Springfield, Massachusetts. He admitted that \\"while in Piacenza and Parma he served several terms and was heavily fined for libel, and while a professor at the Patti University he forged the signatures of [f]aculty to fake diplomas, which he sold to deficient students.\\" In 1915, Miraglia assisted Vilatte in Frederick Ebenezer Lloyd's consecration. On , The Evening World reported that he was \\"charged with obtaining alms under false pretenses,\\" after the Bureau of Charities went to his mission and \\"found only an empty shack,\\" and arrested along with two of his alleged accomplices by detectives. While in court, a Deputy United States Marshal arrested him \\"on the charge of writing vicious letters\\" to a woman. On July 25, 1918, Miraglia died at Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County of myocarditis.

However, when Duke Xian died in 704 BC at the age of 21, the ministers Fuji (ÂºóÂøå) and Sanfu (‰∏âÁà∂) deposed Duke Wu and installed his younger half-brother Chuzi on the throne. Six years later, in 698 BC Sanfu and Fuji assassinated Chuzi and put Duke Wu, the original crown prince, on the throne.

The film follows a man named Nick Di Santo, who discovers that not only is his long-lost father alive, but that he may be able to explain the source of his clairvoyant abilities. Plot The film tells the story of Nick Di Santo (Kleintack), who is tormented by his ability to touch someone and see exactly how they will die. On his 23rd birthday, Nick is summoned by his mother Lillian (Down) to the asylum where she has been institutionalized since his childhood. Hoping that her request to see him is a sign of improvement, Nick is stunned by her revelation that the father he thought was long dead is really alive, and that he may know the origin of Nick's terrible gift. Nick sets out to find his father Seth with his best friend Ryan (Anthony Rey Perez) and girlfriend Eve (Alex McKenna). Every road they take on the journey leads them back to the same abandoned mansion‚Äîa house that only existed in Nick's childhood imagination, or so he thought. Finally succumbing to the will of the house, Nick becomes embroiled in a battle with a dark figure (Bell).

The New York Times and The Hollywood Reporter both panned the film, with the latter stating that \\"The generic title is not even the most unimaginative element of this overstuffed, cliche-ridden horror film.\\" Nerdist News also criticized the film, as they felt that it contained too many elements that \\"merely clutters up a film that might find more power in being simple.\\" As is common with Salva's films, some critics, such as John Squires of Bloody Disgusting, refused to review the film based on the director's criminal convictions for child molestation and child pornography.

Its early flowering nature gives it the name of the Hope for Spring Flower. Magnolia biondiiis a member of the family Magnoliaceae, which consists of more than 210 species. It is widely found in Northern China. It produces small white flowers every few years. Leave buds and petals of the plant are used to alleviate nasal obstruction and coughing in some parts of China. Distribution Magnolia biondii is widely distributed in China. It is commonly found in Gansu, Henan, Hubei, Shaanxi, Sichuan provinces. It is usually found in forests in the mountains. The plant was discovered and introduced to the Western hemisphere more than 70 years ago. Habitat and ecology Magnolia biondii is a deciduous tree that grows mainly in temperate forests in the mountains.It has a broadly conical to spreading habit. Morphology of leaf Magnolia biondii can grow up to 40 feet, or 12 meters. Its bark has a pale grey, smooth appearance. It produces simple leaf type with ovate shape. In general, leaf size varies and can be up to eight inches, or 20 centimeters, long and four inches, or ten centimeters, across. In addition, they are taper-pointed at the tip and wedge-shaped at the base with a short petiole of up to ¬æ inches, or 2 centimeters. Furthermore, leaves are arranged in an alternative pattern. Leaves have pinnate venation. Moreover, stamens and carpels are spirally arranged. Flowers and fruit Flowers of Magnolia biondii are small and white and have strong fragrance associated to them. They can grow up to 3 ¬º inches, or eight centimeters across. Flowers parts are in sets of threes. In general, flowers have six petals and three sepals. More specifically, the petals are pink at the base and white at the top. Furthermore, flowers have cone-shaped receptacle that bears spirally arranged carpels from which styles emerge. Stamens are cream-white in color. In addition, flowers take several years to appear. Because of the small size and long growth period, Magnolia biondii is seldom used for ornamental purposes. Magnolia biondii produce aggregate fruits that consist of numerous separate carpels of one gynoecium. The fruits form in cylindrical cluster and protrude on a stalk. Each cluster can grow up to 5 ¬Ω inches, or 14 centimeters long. Individual fruitlets are red at first, then turn brown upon maturity. Usage =Food= Dried flower buds and petals of Magnolia biondii are considered food in some parts of China. Fresh flower buds can be prepared by mixing with vinegar and ginger. Petals can be fried with flour batter coating. =Medicinal= The dried flower buds of Magnolia biondii are used medicinally in China and Japan. They are used to relieve coughing and nasal obstruction. Pharmacologically, five lignans including pinoresinol dimethyl ether, magnolin, epi-magnolin A, fargesin, and demethoxyaschantin have been attributed to the medicinal effect of Magnolia biondii. Similar species Magnolia biondii is closely related to the Japanese Willow-Leaf Magnolia, Magnolia salicifolia, which has aromatic foliage and shoots. Resemblance is also observed in Magnolia dendata. Magnolia biondii is generally distinguished by its smaller size, narrower leaves, and smaller flowers.

She originally traded as a West Indiaman, sailing between London and Saint Kitts. Then between 1795 and 1797 she performed a voyage for the British East India Company (EIC). The French captured her as she was homeward bound, but her owners repurchased her in 1803. In 1804 the French captured her again, but the Royal Navy recaptured her and returned her to her owners. In 1809 she transported convicts to New South Wales for the British government. After delivering the convicts she sailed to New Zealand where Maori warriors attacked her, killing, and eating, almost her entire crew and passengers. They then burnt her. Career Boyd first appears in the supplemental pages of Lloyd's Register for 1783. Her master was James Young, her owner, \\"Capt. & Co.\\", and her trade London ‚Äî St Kitts.Lloyd's Register (1783), Supplemental pages seq no. B458. Lloyd's List reported on 19 September 1794 that Boyd, Young master, which had sailed from St Kitts had joined the Jamaica convoy after having separated from the Leeward Islands convoy in a violent gale on the Newfoundland Banks.Lloyd's List, n¬∞ 2648. =EIC voyage (1795‚Äì97)= In 1795, Lloyd's Register reported that Boyds master was G.

Indies.Lloyd's Register (1795), seq. no. B280. She underwent a good repair in 1795, and before the EIC chartered Boyd as an \\"extra\\" ship they had her inspected and measured. The EIC records describe her as a three-decker vessel with ten gun ports on each side. Her captain for the voyage was Robert Young. On 25 March 1795, he received a letter of marque.Letter of Marque, p. 53, - accessed 14 May 2011. Captain Young left Portsmouth on 8 July 1795, bound for St Helena and Bengal. On 5 September she reached Rio de Janeiro, and on 10 November St Helena. By 24 December she was at the Cape, and she arrived at Calcutta on 31 March 1796. Homeward bound Calcutta she passed Kedgeree on 22 June, reached the Cape on 29 September, and St Helena on 28 October. On 8 January 1797 as she approached England the French captured her, and reportedly took her into Nantes.Lloyd's List, ‚Ññ2896. The EIC valued her cargo at ¬£17,060.Report from the Select Committee of the House of Commons appointed to enquire into the present state of the affairs of the East India Company, together with the minutes of evidence, an appendix of documents, and a general index, (1830), Vol. 2, p.977. =French ownership= Between 1797 and some point during the period of the Peace of Amiens, Boyd was in French hands. Her name and career during this period is currently obscure. =British merchantman= Boyd, 20 years old, Thames-built, and of 392 tons (bm), reappears in Lloyd's Register in 1803. Her master is Dickson, her owner Boddington, and her trade is London‚ÄîGrenada.Lloyd's Register (1803), seq. no. B364. At this remove one can only conjecture that Boddington purchased her during the Peace of Amiens. In 1804 she received a new master, \\"Litson\\". He was sailing her to Grenada when she lost a rudder. She was part of a convoy under the escort of . The convoy went on to Barbados, leaving Boyd at , some 600 miles east of Barbados.Lloyd's List n¬∞ 4466. Shortly thereafter, a French vessel captured Boyd. However, on 19 May recaptured the \\"English ship Boyd\\", which was carrying \\"plantation stores\\". Galatea took her into Antigua.Lloyd's List, n¬∞ 4475. On 12 November, still under Litson's command, Boyd arrived at The Downs from Liverpool. While west of Dungeness three privateers had chased her.Lloyd's List, n¬∞ 4505. In 1805 Laughton (or Loughlon) replaced Litson as master. Also, Boddington now armed her. Her trade remained London ‚Äî Dominica.Lloyd's Register (1805), seq. no. B383. In 1809 Thompson replaced Laughton as master. =Convict transport= Under the command of Captain John Thompson, Boyd sailed from Cork, Ireland on 10 March 1809. She stopped at the Cape before she arrived at Port Jackson on 14 August 1809. She transported 139 male convicts, of whom five died on the voyage. Fate Boyd sailed in October 1809 from Port Jackson to Whangaroa, New Zealand to pick up kauri spars. She was under the command of John Thompson and carried about 70 people. She anchored at Whangaroa where MƒÅori warriors attacked her in December 1809. They killed and cannibalised 67 crew and passengers, during what became known as the Boyd massacre. Four passengers, a woman, a boy, and two children, survived. , Simon Pattison, master, was nearby and came and rescued them.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 24, pp.107-8.

Though no longer in existence, many groups have made claims to its lineage through the consecrations of Paolo Miraglia-Gulotti and Frederick Ebenezer Lloyd. The State of Illinois Charter for the ACC obtained by Abp. Vilatte, dated 13 July 1915, is now registered to Abp. Robert Clement, and his ACC ministry is continuing in California. Origin Joseph Ren√© Vilatte founded his independent Christian denomination, American Catholic Church (ACC), soon after he was consecrated. According to The New York Times, Edward Randall Knowles was Vilatte's first ordination. The 1892 article called the two, Vilatte and Knowles, the hierarchy of the . That had a schism when Knowles desired to be consecrated a bishop. Vilatte wrote to The New York Times, that he had \\"been pestered with applications from clergymen of other churches for episcopal consecration.\\" I \\"would render myself ridiculous,\\" wrote Vilatte, \\"were I to proceed to consecrate Bishops in a hurry.\\" Vilatte rejected Knowles' request and Knowles resigned. Vilatte explained that three canonical conditions were not met: *Vilatte was alone, \\"and the law of the Church is that there should be at least three Bishops to consecrate another\\" *Knowles was married, \\"whereas in all the Eastern churches a Bishop must be a monk\\" *Knowles was too young, he \\"has not attained the canonical age\\" Vilatte complained against attempts to force him \\"to act against\\" his \\"better judgment\\" and declared: \\"I am, and intend to remain, faithful to the laws of our orthodox Church.\\" Vilatte was mocked, in The Sacred Heart Review, as being the \\"sole proprietor and General Manager of the new Old Catholic Church in America\\" confronted by a schism. While the \\"great 'neatness and despatch of Knowles' ordination was ridiculed and his judgment, for \\"resigning from his church because he can't be a bishop all at once\\", was questioned. \\"Knowles may ask, [what] is the use of having a [...] church of your own if you are going to let the rules stand in your way?\\". Knowles was a Baptist convert to the , he graduated from Princeton University, studied Christian Science for a time, interviewed Joseph Leycester Lyne, corresponded with Antonio Francisco Xavier Alvarez, Pedro Manoel Lisboa Pinto, Eduard Herzog and others. He was prepared to sail to Europe to consult with Hyacinthe Loyson, Herzog, and the Old Catholic Church of the Netherlands (OKKN) about the feasibility or desirability of starting missions in America. He abandoned his trip and waited for Vilatte. They met in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Knowles was ordained in West Sutton, Massachusetts. On , The New York Times published that Knowles had received a letter from Loyson. \\"The letter shows that the Old Catholic Episcopate in Europe have sided with [...] Knowles as against [...] Vilatte, and have entirely repudiated him.\\" The name \\"American Catholic Church\\" was also used, from 1894, by a group of Polish parishes, at first associated with Vilatte, which were organized at Immaculate Heart of Mary Church in Cleveland, Ohio. On , The New York Times reported that Knowles was a guest at Holland House, London and was \\"a priest of the Old Catholic or Syrian Church\\" who will in Egypt \\"study the Coptic and Greek systems\\". It further reported that, \\"There is a feeling among the Old Catholics and others who sympathize with them that the present administration of the Church is not vigorous or progressive enough. Hardly any advance has been made since the consecration of Archbishop Vilatte [...] Negotiations were carried on with disaffected Polish Catholics [...] but they failed [...] through a lack of discretion and tact.\\" It went on to report that the \\"facts will be laid before the Patriarch by Knowles\\" and that reforms will be suggested. \\"In point of fact\\", Orzell wrote, \\"most Polish dissidents proved more willing to make use of Vilatte's episcopal services at blessings and confirmations than to accept his leadership and embrace his curious blend of Eastern and Western Christian theology.\\" Margrander wrote that Poles did not accept Vilatte's doctrinal reforms so he withdrew his approval of their movement; he also wrote that Vilatte was convinced that their motive was a \\"deliberate defiance of the canonical authority\\" of their bishops, rather than reform, so he \\"advised them either to accept fully and freely the Old Catholic principles, or to return to the Roman Church.\\" Statistics about Vilatte's Old Catholic Church (OCC) sect showed its tiny size. Henry Carroll's The Religious Forces of the United States Enumerated, Classified, and Described, summarized United States Census data from 1890 to 1910. It showed the had at most three minister, five edifices and 700 members; Moreover, the 1910 United States Census data showed that prior to 1910, the disintegrated and ceased to exist; Carroll wrote that \\"a number of denominations, all quite small, have disappeared, including [...] the Old Catholic Church, and other insignificant bodies.\\" Carroll's summaries did not list a sect named \\"American Catholic Church\\". Bishops of the American Catholic Church: Stephen Kaminski, Joseph Ren√© Vilatte, Paolo Miraglia *a council of churches open to all persons having their residence in this country, whatever may be their nationality; *united in the fidelity to the true faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, who is the sole Head of the Universal Church and our High Priest; *imbued with the American Spirit of democracy and liberty; *a branch or section of the true (Christian) Catholic Church of God, with its own Synod and Conference of Bishops. Partially self-reported statistics about Vilatte's denominations were included in the United States Census Bureau's Religious Bodies, 1916 edition. They show two denominations associated with Vilatte were grouped under the name \\"Old Catholic Churches\\". The report also compiled statistics about similar types of denominations, though not ecclesiastically connected, which the report identified as the Polish National Catholic Church (PNCC) and the Lithuanian National Catholic Church (LNCC). Of the two denominations under Vilatte's leadership, the first was the Old Roman Catholic Church (ORCC) with an episcopal see in Chicago, Illinois. Miraglia was associated with this organization and had special charge of Italian services. It was in close fellowship with the but a distinct organization. No report was made of this denomination in 1906, although some churches had been registered previous to that time. It claimed 12 organizations, with a membership of 4,700 with 11 church edifices. There were four organizations reporting parsonages. Of the 12 organizations, two, with 850 members, reported the use of English only in church services, and 10, with 3,850 members, the use of foreign languages only. The principal language reported was Polish, reported by three organizations, with 1,700 members; Lithuanian by one organization, with 325 members; Russian, used by one church, with 1,000 members; and, Portuguese, reported by three organizations, with 550 members. The number of ministers identified with the church was 14. Of the two denominations under Vilatte's leadership, the second was the with an episcopal see in Chicago. It was incorporated in 1915 in Illinois. Old corporate names officially used by the corporation were \\"American Catholic Church\\", \\"Mercian Rite Catholic Church\\", and \\"The Orthodox Catholic Church of America\\". The current corporate name, in 2013, is \\"The American Catholic Church\\". Lloyd was associated with this organization. The denomination was formed for the special purpose of bringing Roman Catholics into the Old Catholic movement. It was in close fellowship with the but a distinct organization. This denomination was reported for the first time in 1916. It claimed three organizations, with a membership of 475 with one church edifice. There was one organization reporting a parsonage. English was reported as the only language used in church services in this denomination. The number of ministers identified with the church was seven. After Vilatte retired as head of the in 1920, Lloyd was chosen by a synod of that church to replace him; that synod gave Vilatte the honorary title of Exarch. According to the Year Book of the Churches, 1923 edition, Vilatte continued as head of the . Also A third denomination grouped under the name \\"Old Catholic Churches\\" was the Catholic Church of North America (CCoNA). was not under Vilatte's leadership but under Bishop William Henry Francis Brothers' with an episcopal see in Waukegan, Illinois. This church was also reported for the first time in 1916. It claimed six organizations; 9,025 members with five church edifices. There were two organizations reporting parsonages. Of the six organizations one, with 725 members, reported the use of English only in church services; one, with 600 members, reported Slavic and English; and four, with 7,700 members, the use of foreign languages only. The principal language reported was Italian, reported by three organizations, with 7,400 members; Polish by one organization, with 300 members. The number of ministers identified with the church was 12. The was organized by Bishop Stanislaus B. Mickiewicz with an episcopal see in Lawrence, Massachusetts. It was in some type of connection, though not ecclesiastically, with the . This church was reported for the first time in 1916. It claimed seven organizations; 7,343 members with six church edifices. There was one organization reporting a parsonage. The only language reported in the conduct of church services in this denomination was Lithuanian. The number of ministers identified with the church was three. The was organized by Bishop Franciszek Hodur with an episcopal see in Scranton, Pennsylvania. This church was reported for the first time in 1906. In 1916, it claimed 34 organizations; 28,245 members with 37 church edifices. There were 21 organizations reporting a parsonage. Of the 34 organizations, two, with 586 members, reported the use of English only in church services, and 32, with 27,659 members, the use of Polish only. The number of ministers identified with the church was 45. A movement similar to that started by Hodur and his associates was the one started by Bishop in Chicago. One or two churches in Chicago, together with churches in Indiana and Wisconsin, and several in the East, organized another independent diocese, known as the Polish Independent Catholic Church, of which Kozlowski was eventually made bishop. Subsequently these two organizations united to form the , which by 1916 included all the Polish Independent Catholic Church parishes in the United States, except one in Buffalo. By 1929, about four years after Vilatte's death, only one denomination derived from Vilatte was included in Religious Bodies, 1926 edition. The report explained that, by then, \\"none of these American bodies or leaders are connected with or recognized by the Old Catholic Churches of any part of continental Europe, nor are their Orders or Apostolic Successions derived directly, if at all, from European Old Catholic Churches\\" and added a \\"caution against misinterpretation\\" of the term \\"Old Catholic Churches\\". It identified three subsets of denominations in the Old Catholic Churches group in the US: # and \\"its numerous derivatives\\" #Old Catholic Church in America #North American Old Roman Catholic Church and the \\"numerous separated personal leaders derived from its establishment\\" According to the report, these entities are no longer either connected with Old Catholic Churches of continental Europe, which \\"repudiated all responsibility for or connection with\\" bishops who derived their consecrations from the consecration of Mathew, or with the Syriac Orthodox Church of Antioch. \\"Of the many bishops that have been consecrated in this group, [...] most have assumed other names and titles and founded separate churches for themselves by civil incorporation. For most of these no statistics are published, for the reason that the Census Bureau collects its statistics directly from congregations rather than from the officers of corporations.\\" So, \\"direct comparisons between the bodies as reported at the two censuses are impossible, [...] because of numerous organic changes,\\" according to the United States Census Bureau. Which also stated \\"a reorganization since the census of 1916 makes it impossible to identify the whole group with any of the bodies formerly presented,\\" in the 1916 data, under the name \\"Old Catholic Churches\\"; the reorganized claimed 11 organizations, with a membership of 1,367 with two church edifices. There was one organization reporting a parsonage. The number of ministers identified with the church was not reported. Religious Bodies, 1926 edition, named one denomination \\"which now has a thriving organization of congregations\\" derived from Vilatte, that \\"aspires to ultimate association with Eastern Orthodox Churches as a racial or national unit\\" and \\"does not desire any association with Old Catholic Churches\\"‚Äîthe African Orthodox Church (AOC). It had its episcopal see in New York City but incorporated in Florida. This denomination was reported for the first time in 1926. It claimed 13 organizations, with a membership of 1,508 without a church edifice. There was no organization reporting a parsonage. The number of ministers identified with the church was 30. Another denomination, named the African Orthodox Church of New York (AOCoNY) also had its episcopal see in New York City and incorporated in New York. The was in a fellowship \\"strictly one of spiritual communion\\" with the and a distinct organization with \\"absolute independence.\\" This denomination was also reported for the first time in 1926. It claimed three organizations, with a membership of 717 with one church edifice. There was one organization reporting a parsonage. The number of ministers identified with the church was not reported. A notice from the Syrian Patriarchate of Antioch and All the East concerning schismatic bodies and ', dated , states that \\"after direct expulsion from official Christian communities\\" some schismatic bodies exist, including \\"all the sects claiming succession through Vilatte,\\" that claim \\"without truth to derive their origin and apostolic succession from some ancient Apostolic Church of the East\\" and The notice named both the and the specifically as examples of such schismatic bodies. According to James R. Lewis, in The Encyclopedia of Cults, Sects, and New Religions, the \\"was taken over by bishops with theosophical leanings\\" after Vilatte's death. = Intercollegiate University = Lloyd and John Churchill Sibley together operated a parallel business entity, called the Intercollegiate University (IU), in which Lloyd was president and Sibley was chancellor. According to the 1924 Year Book of the Churches, \\"in order to establish a legal bond with the American Catholic Church\\", the College of Church Musicians (CoCM) was reorganized and incorporated as in Illinois. Previously, Year Book of the Churches listed a \\"Theological Department\\" associated with the once, only in the 1919 edition, and no school was associated with the that year. The next year, the 1920 edition listed an \\"American Catholic Seminary\\" associated with the and no school associated with the . was \\"the university and seminary of the American Catholic Communion\\". was incorporated in Kansas in 1892. According to The Spectator, after Sibley died, \\"the Intercollegian accomplished a remarkable feat by publishing an obituary notice of him without mentioning his name.\\" The Intercollegian was an periodical. Council of Oversight In Chicago, Joseph Rene Vilatte was established on Fullerton Ave. There with the leaders of the Polish and the Italian constituencies, he made the American Catholic Church evolve into a Council of Oversight. The concept of such a council appeared in his booklet Apostolic Reunion in America, published in 1909. The following protocol was signed: We, Joseph Rene Archbishop Vilatte, Stephen Bishop Kaminski, and Paul Bishop Miraglia, by the grace of God and the suffrage of the faithful, assembled in the Cathedral of Buffalo, on this the feast of the Circumcision of Christ in the year 1910, do hereby declare that we are *a council of churches open to all persons having their residence in this country, whatever may be their nationality; * united in the fidelity to the true faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, who is the sole Head of the Universal Church and our High Priest; * imbued with the American Spirit of democracy and liberty; *a branch or section of the true (Christian) Catholic Church of God, with its own Synod and Conference of Bishops. Hungarian American Constituency  when Vilatte consecrated Victor von Kubinyi in South Bend, Indiana. Kubinyi immigrated to the USA . He functioned as a priest in Newark, New Jersey. Dissidents in a schism from St. Stephen Church for Hungarians in South Bend, a parish of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Fort Wayne, arranged for Kubinyi to come from Newark to South Bend and elected him pastor of their separatist congregation, Sacred Heart Independent Hungarian Catholic Church. Tensions flared in June at a cemetery during a funeral officiated by Kubinyi, the South Bend Tribune printed that, \\"it is said, an attempt was made to prevent the [...] burial because the mother attends the new independent church\\" but she owned the lot and \\"interment took place despite the protests of cemetery attaches who refuse to lend their aid to the ceremonies.\\" Kubinyi then dedicated a parish cemetery in July. In August, the congregation joined the Polish National Catholic Church (PNCC); according to the South Bend Tribune, Kubinyi said the congregation was only independent financially and was dependent on Bishop Franciszek Hodur's \\"direction in all matters of religion, morals and discipline.\\" In September, Hodur dedicated the church. The parish was financially sound and without debt. In December, when factional differences were being resolved, Kubinyi deserted the parish and left South Bend. He said: In February, 1913, Hodur assigned a Polish priest who fluently spoke Hungarian, Father Basil Sychta, as Kubinyi's replacement. Kubinyi returned from Chicago to South Bend in April and announced that Vilatte will consecrate him as a bishop for a proposed new sect for Hungarians. Kubinyi said in his announcement: The South Bend Tribune reported that it was \\"not improbable that the independent congregation of the Sacred Heart\\" would transfer to Kubinyi's jurisdiction. On April 16, Hungarian National Church in America (HNCiA) was incorporated by Kubinyi in Indiana. Kubinyi alleged, in an affidavit, that the 1913 election of officers in the parish was false and fraudulent. He stated that according to records Sychta was the priest but according to the church constitution Kubinyi was the perpetual priest. He stated that he resigned \\"but that his resignation, tendered in duress was never accepted.\\" He also listed a different group of officers in his affidavit than those listed in County records. When Vilatte arrived in South Bend for the consecration, no place for the holding of the ceremonies had been selected. Although police were present because \\"Kubinyi feared that trouble might ensue at the services from members of the old church and therefore requested police protection,\\" they were not needed at his consecration. The Fort Wayne Weekly Sentinel reported that Vilatte consecrated Kubinyi as bishop and founder of the . It noted that no arrangements were made for a location where Kubinyi's faction of adherents would hold services. After his consecration, Kubinyi filed three lawsuits in May for damages against the chairman of the church, Syctha and the officers of the church. He lost the case. He also filed a lawsuit for malicious prosecution against the chairman of the church in city court which stated the chairman had charged Kubinyi with stealing church records, which Kubinyi had sent to Varlaky and later recovered, and although the chairman's charge was withdrawn. A few weeks later, he declared that if a conciliation with the parish was reached then he would not attempt to organize a new congregation. Kubinyi and his adherents were accepted into the . In December, 1913, Kubinyi renounced his Roman Catholic faith as well as his title as bishop and was ordained as a rector, a cleric in charge of a parish, by Bishop John Hazen White, of Michigan City. Soon thereafter he founded Holy Trinity First Hungarian Episcopal Church in South Bend. On November 15, 1918, he was deposed by White. Although a Central Press Association supplied article described him as \\"a scholar and a linguist\\", in 1927, Kubinyi was an amateur painter who lived meagerly in \\"his tiny studio in New York City\\" and worked as a secretary. He began painting while employed as a farmworker. According to the Central Press Association, Kubinyi's artwork hung in William Henry Holmes' \\"exhibition rooms for five weeks.\\" By the 1930s he was known as the \\"Hungarian Bluebeard\\" in New York, an \\"ex-priest, ex-bishop, now fugitive from justice, under criminal indictment for forgery and embezzlement\\" found on wanted posters. Kubinyi was arrested for extradition to New York from California in 1938 where he was working as a teacher of Latin and Psychology in Lake Elsinore, California, using the alias \\"Dr. Felix Renatus\\". Incorporation of the Council On July 2, 1915, a document addressed to Lewis G. Stevenson, Secretary of State of Illinois, was submitted to the notary public Joseph S. Pyplatz, who thereon set his seal the same day. Here is the text: \\"We the undersigned, J. Rene Vilatte, Frederick Ebenezer Lloyd and Louis R. Zawistowski, citizens of the United States propose to form a corporation under an act of the General Assembly of the State of Illinois, entitled An Act Concerning Corporations, approved April 18, 1872.\\" The objects for which the corporation is formed are: * to promote, foster, disseminate and maintain the religious principles and the profession of faith of the American Catholic Church, deriving its jurisdiction from the Holy See of Antioch; * to establish and maintain a Primal See and religious organization throughout the Americas, with jurisdiction over all dioceses, parishes and members thereof belonging to and subscribing to the Faith and using the formalities of the Latin (Western) Rite of the American Catholic Church; * to grant and vest authority and power in the Metropolitan Archbishop to acquire, purchase, have, receive, hold and convey property, real, personal, and mixed of every kind and character and from whatever source or means acquired, derived, given, received, donated or conveyed for the uses and purposes and the maintenance of the diocese and parishes within the jurisdiction of said Archdiocese and for the religious and charitable institutions under the jurisdiction and supervision of the Archbishop and his coadjutors and advisors; * to establish churches, hospitals, infirmaries, schools, convents, and monasteries as well as all other religious, educations and charitable institutions for the preservation, treatment and cure of the afflicted, the teaching and practice of religious discipline, education and manual training of parishioners, adherents to the faith and converts‚Ä¶ Disposition of the ACC and current status By 1914, the dynamic energy of Vilatte was diminishing. In a synod held in Chicago on April 10, 1920, he offered to retire and named Frederick Ebenezer Lloyd as his successor as Primate and Metropolitan of the American Catholic Church. The clergy attending granted Vilatte the honorary title of Exarch. He lived in retirement at 4427 North Mulligan Avenue, Chicago. In a letter dated March 17, 1920, Joseph Rene Vilatte reminded Bishop Lloyd that the ACC was a branch of the Christian (Old) Catholic Church (CCC); that he was consecrated as bishop of the CCC and as such should live and die, and would continue to watch over him and others deriving orders from him, holding them to the Profession of Faith (Duval Declaration) they swore to as a sine qua non condition of their consecration. In 1972, Father (later Bishop) Robert Clement \\"obtained control of the perpetual charter of the American Catholic Church which was incorporated in the State of Illinois by Abp. Joseph Rene Vilatte on 13 July 1915. ... Primate Clement continues to serve the people of God in the dual ministries of Archbishop of the American Catholic Church and Primate of the Eucharistic Catholic Church in the USA.\\" Bishop Clement resides in Southern California where he continues his ministry.

He is known for his role in the organization of Operation Halyard, a successful operation that evacuated over 500 downed Allied airmen from Serbia.  Early life  Vujnovich was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to two Serbian immigrants. After completing high school he attended the University of Belgrade in Yugoslavia. While there he met his wife Mirjana Lazich. In 1941 he witnessed the bombing of Belgrade by Nazi Germany prompting him and Mirjana to flee to Budapest, Hungary. From there they continued fleeing to Turkey then to Jerusalem then finally to Cairo. When they arrived there it was not long before the Nazi Afrika Korps led by Erwin Rommel began to push into Egypt. While in Cairo, he landed a job with Pan American Airways who then relocated him and his wife to Ghana to a United States controlled air base there.  Wartime and Operation Halyard  While in Ghana, the US entered the war and militarized the commercial airline company. At that point he was commissioned into the US Army and subsequently transferred to another US controlled air base in Nigeria where he was made base commander. The Army recognized his Serbian background and experience in Yugoslavia and recruited him to help the US assist resistance efforts in the Balkans. They sent him to training in Virginia and then he was stationed in Bari, Italy. In the summer of 1944, US bombers went on a bombing run to take out Nazi oil fields in Romania but many were shot down over Yugoslavia. Vujnovich then came up with Operation Halyard, a plan to get them out by building a secret airfield. He trained Serbian speaking agents to conduct this operation. He taught them how to blend in by showing them small things such as tying their shoes the Serbian way among other things. The agents parachuted in and led the operation to a success. Over 500 airmen were rescued with huge help of Gen. Drazha Mihailovich and his chetniks forces from Yugoslavian Royal Forces.  Post-War  After the war was over he and Mirjana settled in New York City where they had a daughter together. Shortly after moving there he began a new career selling aircraft parts. He did this until he retired in the 1980s but continued doing consulting work in the field well into his 90s. In 2003 his wife, Mirjana Lazich, died. In 2010, Vujnovich received the Bronze Star for his role in the operation. In 2012 he himself died at the age of 96.

While full genome sequencing of mammals is rapidly progressing, the ability to assemble and align orthologous whole chromosomal regions from more than a few species is not yet possible. The intense focus on the building of comparative maps for domestic (dogs and cats), laboratory (mice and rats) and agricultural (cattle) animals has traditionally been used to understand the underlying basis of disease-related and healthy phenotypes. These maps also provide an unprecedented opportunity to use multispecies analysis as a tool to infer karyotype evolution. Comparative chromosome painting and related techniques are very powerful approaches in comparative genome studies. Homologies can be identified with high accuracy using molecularly defined DNA probes for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on chromosomes of different species. Chromosome painting data are now available for members of nearly all mammalian orders. It was found that in most orders, there are species with rates of chromosome evolution that can be considered as 'default' rates. It needs to be noted that the number of rearrangements that have become fixed in evolutionary history seems relatively low, due to 180 million years of the mammalian radiation. Thus a record of the history of karyotype changes that have occurred during evolution have been attained through comparative chromosome maps. Mammalian phylogenomics An evolutionary tree of mammals. Modern mammals (class Mammalia) are divided into Monotremes, Marsupials, and Placentals. The subclass Prototheria (Monotremes) comprises the five species of egg-laying mammals: platypus and four echidna species. The infraclasses Metatheria (Marsupials) and Eutheria (Placentals) together form the subclass Theria. In the 2000s understanding of the relationships among eutherian mammals has experienced a virtual revolution. Molecular phylogenomics, new fossil finds and innovative morphological interpretations now group the more than 4600 extant species of eutherians into four major super-ordinal clades: Euarchontoglires (including Primates, Dermoptera, Scandentia, Rodentia, and Lagomorpha), Laurasiatheria (Cetartiodactyla, Perissodactyla, Carnivora, Chiroptera, Pholidota, and Eulipotyphla), Xenarthra, and Afrotheria (Proboscidea, Sirenia, Hyracoidea, Afrosoricida, Tubulidentata, and Macroscelidea). This tree is very useful in unifying the parts of a puzzle in comparative mammalian cytogenetics. =Karyotypes: a global view of the genome= Each gene maps to the same chromosome in every cell. Linkage is determined by the presence of two or more loci on the same chromosome. The entire chromosomal set of a species is known as a karyotype. A seemingly logical consequence of descent from common ancestors is that more closely related species should have more chromosomes in common. However, it is now widely thought that species may have phenetically similar karyotypes due to genomic conservation. Therefore, in comparative cytogenetics, phylogenetic relationships should be determined on the basis of the polarity of chromosomal differences (derived traits). Historical development of comparative cytogenetics Mammalian comparative cytogenetics, an indispensable part of phylogenomics, has evolved in a series of steps from pure description to the more heuristic science of the genomic era. Technical advances have marked the various developmental steps of cytogenetics. =Classical phase of cytogenetics= Examples of mammalian chromosomes.a. Metaphase spread of the Indian muntjac (Muntiacus muntjak vaginalis, 2n = 6, 7), the species with the lowest chromosome number. b. Metaphase spread of the Viscacha rat (Tympanoctomys barrerae, 2n = 102), the species with the highest chromosomal number. c. Metaphase spread of the Siberian roe deer (Capreolus pygargus, 2n = 70 + 1-14 B's), the species with additional, or B- chromosomes. d. Metaphase spread of the Transcaucasian Mole Vole female (Ellobius lutescens, 2n = 17, X0 in both sexes). The first step of the Human Genome Project took place when Tjio and Levan, in 1956, reported the accurate diploid number of human chromosomes as 2n = 46. During this phase, data on the karyotypes of hundreds of mammalian species (including information on diploid numbers, relative length and morphology of chromosomes, presence of B chromosomes) were described. Diploid numbers (2n) were found to vary from 2n = 6‚Äì7 in the Indian muntjac to over 100 in some rodents. =Chromosome banding= The second step derived from the invention of C-, G-, R- and other banding techniques and was marked by the Paris Conference (1971), which led to a standard nomenclature to recognize and classify each human chromosome. =G- and R- banding= The most widely used banding methods are G-banding (Giemsa-banding) and R-banding (reverse-banding). These techniques produce a characteristic pattern of contrasting dark and light transverse bands on the chromosomes. Banding makes it possible to identify homologous chromosomes and construct chromosomal nomenclatures for many species. Banding of homologous chromosomes allows chromosome segments and rearrangements to be identified. The banded karyotypes of 850 mammalian species were summarized in the Atlas of Mammalian Chromosomes. =C-banding and heterochromatin= Examples of the distribution of C-heterochromatin in mammalian chromosomes.a. C-banded chromosomes of the Eurasian shrew (Sorex araneus, 2n = 21), example of the smallest amount of heterochromatic bands in mammalian genome. b. C-banded chromosomes of the ground squirrel (Spermophilus erythrogenys, 2n = 36) with very large centomeric C-bands. c. C-banded chromosomes of the marbled polecat (Vormela peregusna, 2n = 38) with the largest additional heterochromatic arms on some autosomes. d. C-banded chromosomes of the Amur hedgehog (Erinaceus amurensis, 2n = 48) with the very large telomeric C-bands on autosomes. e. C-banded chromosomes of the Eversmann's hamster (Allocricetulus eversmanni, 2n = 26) with pericentomeric C-bands on the X and Y chromosomes. f. C-banded chromosomes of the southern vole (Microtus rossiaemeridionalis, 2n = 54) with very large C-bands on both sex chromosomes. Karyotype variability in mammals is mainly due to the varying amount of heterochromatin in each mammal. Once the amount of heterochromatin is subtracted from total genome content, all mammals have very similar genome sizes. Mammalian species differ considerably in heterochromatin content and location. Heterochromatin is most often detected using C-banding. Early studies using C-banding showed that differences in the fundamental number (i.e., the number of chromosome arms) could be entirely due to the addition of heterochromatic chromosome arms. Heterochromatin consists of different types of repetitive DNA, not all seen with C-banding that can vary greatly between karyotypes of even closely related species. The differences of the amount of heterochromatin among congeneric rodent species may reach 33% of nuclear DNA in Dipodomys species, 36% in Peromyscus species, 42% in Ammospermophilus and 60% in Thomomys species where C-value (haploid DNA content) ranges between 2.1 and 5.6 pg. The red viscacha rat (Tympanoctomys barrerae) has a record C-value among mammals‚Äî9.2 pg. Although tetrapoidy was first proposed to be a reason for its high genome size and diploid chromosome number, Svartman et al. showed that the high genome size was due to the enormous amplification of heterochromatin. Although one single copy gene was found to be duplicated in its genome, data on absence of large genome segment duplications (single paints of most Octodon degu probes) and repetitive DNA hybridization evidence rules against tetraploidy. The study of heterochromatin composition, repeated DNA amount and its distribution on chromosomes of octodontids is absolutely necessary to define exactly what heterochromatin fraction is responsible for the large genomes of the red viscacha rat. In comparative cytogenetics, chromosome homology between species was proposed on the basis of similarities in banding patterns. Closely related species often had very similar banding pattern and after 40 years of comparing bands it seems safe to generalize that karyotype divergence in most taxonomic groups follows their phylogenetic relationship, despite notable exceptions. The conservation of large chromosomal segments makes comparison between species worthwhile. Chromosome banding has been a reliable indicator of chromosome homology overall, i.e. that the chromosome identified on the basis of banding actually carries the same genes. This relationship may fail for phylogenetically distant species or species that have experienced extremely rapid chromosome evolution. Banding is still morphological and is not always a foolproof indicator of DNA content. =Comparative molecular cytogenetics= A comparative chromosome map of birds' and mammals' inferred human homologies (right numbers) on chromosome idiograms The third step occurred when molecular techniques were incorporated into cytogenetics. These techniques use DNA probes of diverse sizes to compare chromosomes at the DNA level. Homology can be confidently compared even between phylogenetically distant species or highly rearranged species (e.g., gibbons). Using cladistic analysis rearrangements that have diversified the mammalian karyotype are more precisely mapped and placed in a phylogenomic perspective. \\"Comparative chromosomics\\" defines the field of cytogenetics dealing with molecular approaches, although \\"chromosomics\\" was originally introduced to define the research of chromatin dynamics and morphological changes in interphase chromosome structures. Chromosome painting or Zoo-FISH was the first technique to have a wide-ranging impact. With this method the homology of chromosome regions between different species are identified by hybridizing DNA probes of an individual, whole chromosomes of one species to metaphase chromosomes of another species. Comparative chromosome painting allows a rapid and efficient comparison of many species and the distribution of homologous regions makes it possible to track the translocation of chromosomal evolution. When many species covering different mammalian orders are compared, this analysis can provide information on trends and rates of chromosomal evolution in different branches. However, homology is only detected qualitatively, and resolution is limited by the size of visualized regions. Thus, the method does not detect all minuscule homologous regions from multiple rearrangements (as between mouse and human). The method also fails to report internal inversions within large segments. Another limitation is that painting across great phylogenetic distance often results in a decreased efficiency. Nevertheless, the use of painting probes derived from different species combined with comparative sequencing projects help to increase the resolution of the method. In addition to sorting, microdissection of chromosomes and chromosome regions was also used to obtain probes for chromosome painting. Best results were obtained when a series of microdissection probes covering the total human genome were localized on anthropoid primate chromosomes via multicolor banding (MCB). However a limitation of MCB is that it can only be used within a group of closely related species (\\"phylogenetic\\" resolution is too low). Spectral karyotyping (SKY) and MFISH‚Äîthe ratio labeling and simultaneous hybridization of a complete chromosomal set have similar drawbacks and little application outside of clinical studies. Comparative genomics data including chromosome painting confirmed the substantial conservation of mammalian chromosomes. Total human chromosomes or their arms can efficiently paint extended chromosome regions in many placentals down to Afrotheria and Xenarthra. Gene localization data on human chromosomes can be extrapolated to the homologous chromosome regions of other species with high reliability. Usefully, humans express conserved syntenic chromosome organization similar to the ancestral condition of all placental mammals. Post-genomic time and comparative chromosomics After the Human Genome Project researchers focused on evolutionary comparisons of the genome structures of different species. The whole genome of any species can be sequenced completely and repeatedly to obtain a comprehensive single-nucleotide map. This method makes it possible to compare genomes for any two species regardless of their taxonomic distance. Sequencing efforts provided a variety of products useful in molecular cytogenetics. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with DNA clones (BAC and YAC clones, cosmids) allowed the construction of chromosome maps at a resolution of several megabases that could detect relatively small chromosome rearrangements. A resolution of several kilobases can be achieved on interphase chromatin. A limitation is that hybridization efficiencies decrease with increasing phylogenetic distance. Radiation hybrid (RH) genome mapping is another efficient approach. This method includes the irradiation of cells to disrupt the genome into the desired number of fragments that are subsequently fused with Chinese hamster cells. The resulting somatic cell hybrids contain individual fragments of the relevant genome. Then, 90‚Äì100 (sometimes, more) clones covering the total genome are selected, and the sequences of interest are localized on the cloned fragments via the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or direct DNA‚ÄìDNA hybridization. To compare the genomes and chromosomes of two species, RHs should be obtained for both species. =Sex chromosome evolution= In contrast to many other taxa, therian mammals and birds are characterized by highly conserved systems of genetic sex determination that lead to special chromosomes, i.e. the sex chromosomes. Although the XX/XY sex chromosome system is the most common among eutherian species, it is not universal. In some species X-autosomal translocations result in the appearance of \\"additional Y\\" chromosomes (for example, XX/XY1Y2Y3 systems in black muntjac). In other species Y-autosomal translocations lead to appearance of additional X chromosomes (for example, in some New World primates such as howler monkeys). Regarding this aspect, rodents again represent a peculiar derived group, comprising the record number of species with non-classical sex chromosomes such as the wood lemming, the collared lemming, the creep vole, the spinous country rat, the Akodon and the bandicoot rat.

The location is a multi-component mound and village complex with platform mounds and extensive midden deposits. The site habitations are divided into three periods. It was first inhabited about 800 CE by peoples of the Coastal Coles Creek culture. By 1100 CE the culture of the site had transitioned into the Mississippianized Plaquemine culture that lasted until 1450 CE. A little later was a Late Mississippian/protohistoric period that lasted from 1500 until about 1700 or 1800. Site description Connection of Sims Site to other Mississippian peoples The large site is located along both banks of a small stream known as Bayou Saut d'Ours and at one time had five to six earthen mounds, but only two mounds and the remains of a third mound are visible today. Mound A is topped by a historic period cemetery. It was one of the largest if not the largest site in the vicinity during the time of its occupation and likely served as a local civic and ceremonial center as well as being a center of trade. The inhabitants traded their local marine resources, including such locally produced items as shells and shell beads, to peoples located further up the Lower Mississippi River valley. The local use of Plaquemine culture pottery grog tempering for pottery and the gradual adoption of shell tempered pottery associated with other areas has allowed archaeologists to track trade interactions with the people of the Sims Site and peoples from these other areas. During the second occupation period trade expanded, and the local ceramics show connections to Lower Mississippi Valley peoples and Plaquemine peoples located near modern-day Barataria Bay and to peoples of the Pensacola culture, located on the upper Gulf Coast near what is modern-day Biloxi, Mississippi. This period, between 1100 and 1450 CE, was during the initial phases of occupation and expansion of the Bottle Creek Site, the major center of the Pensacola culture. This period also sees the most significant Plaquemine connections at the site. The next phase sees increasing contact with Mississipianized Plaquemine peoples from as far up the Mississippi River as the Baton Rouge area, as well as continued interaction with the Mississippian Pensacola peoples.

Incident At the time of the incident Daniel Chong was a 23-year-old student at the University of California, San Diego, a senior majoring in engineering, who is originally from Cerritos in Los Angeles County. On April 20, 2012, he was at a friend's apartment in the University City neighborhood of San Diego, where he and his friends were celebrating the 4/20 holiday, a day that refers to cannabis usage.\\"California Man‚Äôs ‚ÄòDrug Holiday‚Äô Becomes Four-Day Nightmare in Holding Cell\\", New York Times, May 2, 2012 The apartment was raided early on the morning of April 21 by the DEA, which seized marijuana, hallucinogenic mushrooms, and 18,000 ecstasy pills, along with guns and ammunition. Chong and eight other people were transported to the DEA field office in the Kearny Mesa neighborhood of San Diego, where they were interrogated. Seven of the nine detainees were then taken to county jail, one was released, and Chong was accidentally left in a holding cell at the DEA office, according to the DEA.

At one point the lights went off for several days. While locked up, he was starving and hallucinating. He claimed that, while incarcerated, he had to drink his own urine for hydration, and ingested some methamphetamine that he found under a blanket inside the cell in order to keep himself awake. At one point he bit the lens in his eyeglasses to break it, carved the phrase \\"sorry mom\\" in his arm with the shards, and swallowed the glass. By the time he was discovered on April 25, he was hallucinating and completely incoherent. Upon his discovery on April 25, Chong was taken to Sharp Memorial Hospital in Serra Mesa where he remained for five days, including three in the intensive care unit.\\"UCSD student's 5-day ordeal in DEA jail sparks outrage, anger\\", Los Angeles Times, May 3, 2012 He was treated for various problems including dehydration, near-failure of his kidneys, and a perforated lung from eating broken glass.

Sherman issued a statement saying \\"I am deeply troubled by the incident that occurred here last week. I extend my deepest apologies to the young man and want to express that this event is not indicative of the high standards that I hold my employees to.

In August 2013, Chong settled his claim against the DEA for $4.1 million. Inspector General's report On July 8, 2014, the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) of the U.S. Justice Department issued a report on this case. The OIG said they intervened in the investigation because it appeared the local DEA office was investigating the matter on its own, contrary to protocol, and because at least two of the local agents who were investigating the case had been involved with Chong and thus had a conflict of interest. Among other findings, the OIG report (issued as an executive summary) said that Chong was seen or heard while trapped in the holding cell by four DEA agents, who did nothing because they assumed someone else was taking care of it. The report also charged that supervisors responded improperly and in a way that compromised any potential criminal prosecutions of agents at fault. DEA Internal review, punishment and aftermath The DEA concluded its internal investigation of the incident in March 2015 and punished all six agents involved with letters of reprimand and additional suspensions of 5 and 7 days, respectively, without pay, for two of them.Dana Ford, DEA reprimands agents after student forgotten in cell for 5 days, CNN (May 5, 2015).Timothy M.

Congress has also vowed rectification of said process by giving the DEA \\"administrator more authority over civil service disciplinary rules;\\" DEA officials have blamed this lack of authority for their Agency's history of inadequately disciplining and punishing its employees. These concerns and promises voiced, however, only target improvements to the DEA's disciplinary process to punish employees for incidences, like that experienced by Chong, after the fact and not to any potential systemic problems that allow them to happen in the first place. These latter issues, DEA spokesperson Rusty Payne assures, have been fixed, and such an assurance appears to have placated most lawmakers and administrators for now.https://www.stltoday.com/news/national/student-left-in- dea-cell-to-get-million-from- us/article_c7263c80-a7a4-5cce-8fa0-c2f88a147b76.html The DEA said it has introduced national detention standards including daily inspections and cameras in cells.

He is best known as one of the commanders during the Spanish defeat at the Battle of Tudela.  Military career  When his father died in 1792, O'Neylle was an infantry battalion commander of the 3rd Regimento de la Princesa. His first actions were in Roussillon and Catalonia in May 1808 where he distinguished himself and was put on the staff of Jos√© Rebolledo de Palafox y Melzi. O'Neylle marched with his troops from Valencia to Aragon where he was instrumental in lifting the French siege and driving away the forces of Fran√ßois Joseph Lefebvre who was forced to retire to Navarre. Palafox entrusted O'Neylle together with the Marqu√©s de Laz√°n to press the retreat of Lefebvre. This bold attack forced the occupying French forces to abandon Tudela and O'Neylle was personally responsible for destroying a French column in the area around Nardu√©s. On November 23, 1808, the Spanish army of Andaluc√≠a regrouped and prepared to give battle under the command of Francisco Javier Casta√±os, 1st Duke of Bail√©n with Palafox as the second in command. This engagement was to become known as the disastrous Battle of Tudela. The French forces, under the command of Jean Lannes routed the Spanish army which was forced to retreat to Zaragoza. Despite the Spanish defeat at Tudela, O'Neylle was raised to this rank of lieutenant colonel by Palafox for his actions. He acted as Palafox's second in command in the successful Spanish defense at the First Siege of Zaragoza. On December 21, 1808, O'Neylle was involved in the Battle of Arrabal where the Spanish forces from Murcia and Valencia successfully repelled repeated attacks from the division under the command of Honor√© Th√©odore Maxime Gazan de la Peyri√®re, forcing them to retire. He was further involved in pursuing the retreating French forces on the 25th of the same month. The French had built a pontoon bridge from Almozara to the opposite bank of the Ebro in order to facilitate communication between Gazan's camp and that of the remaining French forces. O'Neylle attacked the entrenched French position at the head of 4,000 men and was able to successfully drive them off. Unfortunately for him however, he was not able to hold the pontoon bridge rendering the whole operation fruitless. Death and legacy In late January 1809, O'Neylle became gravely ill with Typhoid fever but was apparently able to recover. According to the biography written by Brigadier Gen. M. Salas, the subsequent news of the Spanish capitulation to French forces in that same year caused him to die from a \\"broken heart\\". Some sources maintain that he died from typhoid Fever. Juan O'Neylle died on February 24, 1809. He was buried in the Catedral-Bas√≠lica de Nuestra Se√±ora del Pilar de Zaragoza.

Life He was the son of Richard Lovell Edgeworth and his third wife Elizabeth, making him one of a very large Anglo-Irish family, including the novelist Maria Edgeworth. His father moved to Ireland to take care of an estate near Edgeworthstown. William Edgeworth's practical interests initially followed those of his father, such as surveying; he moved into cartography. Edgeworth was involved in the construction of the Church of Ireland parish church at Collon in County Louth,Dictionary of Irish Architects, Edgeworth, Richard Lovell. where he worked with Daniel Augustus Beaufort (father of Richard Lovell Edgeworth's fourth wife). Others were William Fletcher (killed there in the building work), and Samuel Jones, brought up by William Edgeworth.Dictionary of Irish Architects, Edgeworth, William. Church of Ireland parish church at Collon, founded 1811, on which the Edgeworth family worked. Edgeworth's surveying work in Ireland included soundings in the River Inny and the mapping of bogs. Irish Bogs Commission was active in the period 1809 to 1814, and under an Act from 1774 there was funding for county maps from grand juries; Edgeworth reported on issues of bog drainage and reclamation. His 1813 map of County Longford was noted, and was followed by a map of County Roscommon with Richard Griffith. He worked also with William Hampton and John Brinkley. Unlike some other surveyors in Ireland at the time, he encountered little opposition to his work; he took a tactful and communicative line with local people. William Strutt, a connection of his father's through Lunar Society who became a close friend,Jenny Uglow, The Lunar Men (2003), p. 377. gave William Edgeworth introductions to Peter Ewart and George Augustus Lee. He paid a visit to Lee's mills in Manchester. Later Edgeworth was employed by Alexander Nimmo. This took him to County Galway and County Waterford. He worked on the Glengariff road. Henry Habberly Price engaged him to do a survey of the River Tees, in north-east England, in 1825‚Äì7, on behalf of the Tees Navigation Company; this work was later used by the Stockton & Darlington Railway, and for conservancy by William Bald.Durham County Record Office Catalogue. He carried out an early railway survey of 1828 in Ulster (Armagh to Newry), done in fact two years before that. Edgeworth was elected a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1829, and was a member of the Royal Irish Academy and the Royal Astronomical Society. He corresponded with William Rowan Hamilton. Edgeworth died, unmarried, at Edgeworthstown, 21 April 1829.

The network was constructed between 2004 and 2008 and opened in 2010. It links the two central stations, Praha hlavn√≠ and Praha Masarykovo, to Libe≈à, Vysoƒçany and Hole≈°ovice stations and the start of their respective mainline corridors towards ƒåesk√° T≈ôebov√°, Hradec Kr√°lov√© and √öst√≠ nad Labem. The construction has increased the capacity of the trunk lines serving Praha hlavn√≠ n√°dra≈æ√≠, allowing more trains to terminate there. Prior to its completion, many international trains terminated at Hole≈°ovice station, due to lack of access to the centre from the northern and eastern routes. Trains are now also able to travel at speeds of up to on the tunnel sections. The construction is also part of a larger plan to improve the sections of pan- European corridors on Czech territory. After leaving both central stations, the electrified tracks lead through a 1.3 km-long tunnel under V√≠tkov hill in ≈Ωi≈ækov, then over a series of bridges skirting the ≈Ωi≈ækov-Libe≈à border leading to a large junction at Balabenka. From here, trains continue east to Vysoƒçany and Libe≈à, and turn north to Hole≈°ovice station, making use of the previously existing tracks which lead to Hole≈°ovice from Libe≈à. The construction of Nov√© Spojen√≠ also led to numerous improvements in road infrastructure, including a heated overbridge at Krejc√°rek, which replaced a level crossing. Construction The construction was led by Skanska and also Metrostav and Subterra. The complex comprised of new track, of which is electrified at 3 kV DC, of fibre-optic cable for the signalling system, and of noise barriers. A total of 267 separate structures were built for the project. The overhead wires built on the line were specifically designed to be as unobtrusive as possible to views of the city centre. Preliminary construction works before the project began were completed in 2002, costing approximately 260 million Czech koruna (about 7.3 million USD) and included the construction of a large bridge over Seifertova street in ≈Ωi≈ækov at the northern end of hlavn√≠ n√°dra≈æ√≠. Following this bridge, the new track leads under an electrified double-tracked tunnel under V√≠tkov hill, which replaced a non-electrified one-track tunnel. This section is in length and was constructed using the New Austrian Tunnelling Method as well as conventional methods. The last service to travel on the old tunnel prior to its demolition was a steam service from Prague (hlavn√≠) to ƒåesk√© Velenice at the Czech-Austrian border on 11 December 2005. In 2010, a cycle path was opened on the route of the old tunnel. The long double-tracked concrete bridge section at Sluncov√°, after the new tunnel built under V√≠tkov, was awarded the prize of \\"bridge construction of the year\\" (mostn√≠ d√≠lo roku) in 2008. The construction of this section cost 262.3 million CZK. The entire project won the transport category of the Czech stavba roku (construction of the year) award in 2009.

Built in 1919, it featured a remarkable geometric interior created in 1920 by the renowned architects Walter Burley Griffin and his wife, Marion Griffin (1871‚Äì1961), and it was a popular entertainment venue throughout the early 20th century. The building was destroyed by fire in 1969.  History Confusingly, over a period of 15 years, there have been four different buildings with the name Palais in this location and next door, the site of the current Palais Theatre, all built by the Phillips brothers (who had also built Luna Park in 1912). The first Palais de Danse was a timber, arched roofed structure built in 1913 on the site currently occupied by the Palais Theatre. It was converted to also show pictures in 1915, becoming the first Palais Theatre. :Adjacent on the Lower Esplanade was the Daylight Pictures Co. building, which in 1914 was converted to a live venue, the Comedy Theatre. In 1919, a large steel framed arched structure was built over the Palais, which was then relocated next door to become the Palais de Danse (again), while the new larger arched building became the Palais Pictures. The Palais Pictures building was destroyed by fire in 1926, and rebuilt in 1927, the present Palais Theatre. The Palais de Danse could hold as many as 2,870 patrons, and was a popular venue throughout its life, and is remembered for its magical atmosphere. On hot nights, the louvered wall panels hinged up, to capture sea breezes wafting off the bay. The second Palais de Danse was destroyed by fire in 1969.  Architecture  The 1919 Palais de Danse exterior (designer unknown) was dominated by a large arched form following that of the roof, anchored by large square piers each side, decorated with delicate classical details, and topped by fanciful stepped turrets. The interior design created c1920 was designed by the renowned American-Australian architect Walter Burley Griffin (1876‚Äì1937) and his wife, Marion Griffin (1871‚Äì1961). The dance floor was surrounded by seating areas behind abstracted fluted Doric columns, which supported a remarkable frieze of complex, prismatic, up-lit panels. The ceiling, at first just the exposed metal trusses of the roof, was soon concealed by low pitched angled ribbing, from which hung three rows of large geometrically decorated prismatic lamps.

El Junior) is a former Mexican drug lord and high-ranking lieutenant of the Gulf Cartel. He is the nephew of Antonio and Osiel C√°rdenas Guill√©n, two men who at one time led the criminal organization. Born and raised in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, C√°rdenas Vela began his criminal career in the year 2000, where he served as the regional boss of the Gulf Cartel in San Fernando, Tamaulipas. During his time in power, he reportedly bribed and threatened local leaders and policemen in order allow the Gulf Cartel to introduce and move narcotics around the municipality freely. Nine years later, C√°rdenas Vela was promoted by his superiors to the R√≠o Bravo, Tamaulipas corridor, directly south across the U.S-Mexico border. In R√≠o Bravo, he reportedly supervised cocaine and marijuana shipments heading to the United States and oversaw human smuggling rings. The death of his uncle Antonio in November 2010 created an internal division in the Gulf Cartel, but C√°rdenas Vela managed to become the regional boss of the cartel in Matamoros in March 2011. Amid the turmoil, C√°rdenas Vela began to have problems with the drug lord Jorge Eduardo Costilla S√°nchez and his henchmen. Fearing for his own life, C√°rdenas Vela fled to the state of Texas and managed the operatives of the cartel behind the scenes. But his career came to an end on 20 October 2011 when federal agents arrested him in Port Isabel, Texas. In the Gulf Cartel, C√°rdenas Vela made more than $5 million and ensured that that money \\"went into the pockets of Mexican law enforcement officers as bribes,\\" and had about \\"500 armed men at his beck and call.\\" Criminal career =Rise to power= Beginning in the year 2000, C√°rdenas Vela spent several years as the drug boss of San Fernando, Tamaulipas, a city just 30 miles south of Matamoros and with an important drug corridor. As leader, the first thing he reportedly did was visit the city's mayor, police forces, newspapers, and media outlets to pay them off or made sure they understood that he was in charge. When it was time to move cocaine shipments, C√°rdenas Vela notified the police and warned them not to get out of their headquarters until he called them back. Introducing cocaine through San Fernando, however, was a difficult task for the Gulf Cartel; due to the military checkpoint in the municipality, the cartel had to find its way in moving narcotics. If they could not get it through the checkpoints or surround the base by using dirt roads, aircraft would be used to bring cocaine in 500 kilograms per load. The planes would then arrive at strips the cartel made, and over ten men would unload the drugs and take them for storage in San Fernando, under the supervision of C√°rdenas Vela. Once all the drugs were unloaded and in San Fernando, the drug bosses of the border cities would send their henchmen to pick up the loads in large armed convoys. The armed men reportedly made checkpoints throughout the highway to prevent any rival drug gangs to interrupt their operatives and to make sure the military did not get near. According to C√°rdenas Vela, sometimes it took all day and night to count all of the drug loads. When the Gulf Cartel was sure that the highways were safe, they would move the drugs north to the border. By the year 2009, he became the gatekeeper of R√≠o Bravo, Tamaulipas, a city that lies directly across the Mexico-United States border from Donna, Texas a major smuggling route to the United States. C√°rdenas Vela led the cartel in R√≠o Bravo very similarly to how he managed the cartel operatives in San Fernando. However, given its geographical location, R√≠o Bravo was much more violent than San Fernando. In R√≠o Bravo, C√°rdenas Vela's men smuggled marijuana across the Rio Grande and trafficked cocaine through the international bridges. But to ensure that the cocaine was not intercepted, the cartel reportedly bribed U.S. Border Patrol agents in the bridges at Donna and Progreso, Texas. C√°rdenas Vela also controlled the human smuggling rings in the area and had them go across the Rio Grande, although separately from the marijuana traffickers. Half of the river was used to smuggle illegal aliens across the border, and the other half was used for marijuana traffickers. These two activities were never mixed, particularly because the U.S. Border Patrol agents catch immigrants much easier. After the death of his uncle, Antonio C√°rdenas Guill√©n (a.k.a. Tony Tormenta) on 5 November 2010, infightings within the Gulf Cartel triggered, and C√°rdenas Vela faced problems with Jorge Eduardo Costilla S√°nchez (a.k.a. El Coss) and other Gulf cartel members, who at one time worked along his uncle Osiel C√°rdenas Guill√©n. In March 2011, C√°rdenas Vela became the top drug baron in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, but fled to the Texas to seek refuge from Costilla S√°nchez. According to the U.S. authorities, he was also looking for safe haven in the United States because the rival cartel of Los Zetas was tracking his whereabouts and wanted him dead. La Jornada reported on 26 October 2011 that C√°rdenas Vela made several enemies within his own organization, as some cartel members grew jealous of the power he attained and of the fact that he sometimes hid in Texas while they \\"faced full-time heat in Mexico.\\" Once on U.S. soil, C√°rdenas Vela communicated with his subordinates through daily emails, and continued to control the drug transportation and distribution cells that trafficked cocaine and marijuana across the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border. He had made more than $5 million throughout his eleven-year career as leader of the Gulf Cartel. =Arrest= On 20 October 2011, while heading to his luxury house in South Padre Island, Texas with his bodyguards and an \\"attractive lady,\\" C√°rdenas Vela was pulled over in Port Isabel, Texas by the police at around 6:39 p.m. on Texas State Highway 100, who were reportedly working with federal agents that had been tipped to his whereabouts. Nonetheless, The Brownsville Herald stated that the police chief of Port Isabel claimed that C√°rdenas Vela was pulled over due to a \\"routine traffic stop\\" because he \\"was speeding.\\" Reportedly, the officer was unaware that C√°rdenas Vela was a top drug baron in the Gulf Cartel. C√°rdenas Vela was the passenger driver in a Ford F-150 silver truck with temporary license plates, and was wearing pink shorts and loafers. When he was stopped, C√°rdenas Vela presented a Mexican passport and a visa name with a false name. Once confronted with his true identity, he admitted to have traveled with another man's passport, and that for years he had trafficked cocaine and marijuana to the United States. The Mexican passport he was carrying (which was under the name of a supposed Pedro Garc√≠a Gonz√°lez), along with his visa, were authentic documents. According to CNN, C√°rdenas Vela explicitly said that he was involved in \\"the transportation and importation of marijuana and cocaine into the United States for several years,\\" and admitted to have sold five kilograms of marijuana in 2009 to people he knew were smuggling across the U.S. for further distribution. Moreover, he admitted to have crossed illegally into the United States from Mexico before being caught by the authorities. Upon his arrest in Port Isabel, his cellphones and ledgers were confiscated by the authorities. A phone toll analysis proved his connectivity with several active and ongoing drug investigations and a ledger was also analyzed that indicated the personnel structure of the armed and unarmed individuals in the Gulf Cartel, as well as the purchase of firearms, protective equipment, automobiles and gasoline for these vehicles. No firearms, drugs, or high bulks of cash were found in his vehicle when he was taken into custody. Initial reports after his arrest stated that C√°rdenas Vela had three houses in the Texan cities of Rio Hondo, Port Isabel, and Brownsville‚Äîall within 30 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border. He confessed to have dozens of vehicles, a condominium in South Padre Island, and a collections of exotic animals in his house in Rio Hondo. But none of these properties he owned in the Rio Grande Valley were under his name. On 13 December 2011, The Monitor reported that the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was keeping track of C√°rdenas Vela's location in South Texas before he was arrested, and deduced the drug lord's possible location at a ranch in Rio Hondo. When he left the ranch and headed towards South Padre Island on 20 October 2011, he was tracked down by the authorities; the ICE agency later confirmed that they had Port Isabel's police stop C√°rdenas Vela on his way to the beach. C√°rdenas Vela's arrest triggered a series of road blocks and gunfights in Valle Hermoso and Matamoros, Tamaulipas, the city in which he operated. By 27 October 2011, El Universal reported a total of 14 killings as a result of his arrest and of the Gulf Cartel infighting. Context of arrest Stratfor and the San Antonio Express-News released a report on 3 November 2011 putting more context on the arrest of C√°rdenas Vela in South Texas. They mentioned that the drug lord must have been living tough times in his position because his uncle Osiel C√°rdenas Guill√©n is believed to have cooperated with the U.S. authorities as a protected witness. C√°rdenas Vela was believed to be part of Los Rojos, a faction of the Gulf cartel that is loyal to the C√°rdenas family and headed by Juan Mej√≠a Gonz√°lez, alias El R1. According to Stratfor, Los Rojos were under a power struggle with Los Metros, once headed by Samuel Flores Borrego (a.k.a. El Metro 3) and now headed by Jorge Eduardo Costilla S√°nchez. Below is a quote of the report: The Monitor reported on 27 October 2011 that a rescue attempt for C√°rdenas Vela was very unlikely. Despite being a powerful leader in the Gulf Cartel, his rude actions \\"burned many bridges in the organization.\\" A source outside law enforcement but with direct knowledge of the situation stated that C√°rdenas Vela was \\"very hardheaded and impulsive,\\" which made him have many enemies in the organization. \\"(Some of the) comandantes are glad he is gone,\\" the source said. In addition, George W. Grayson, author and professor at The College of William & Mary, that even though C√°rdenas Vela was the plaza boss of Matamoros, the core network of the Gulf Cartel will remain untouched, since he was not part of the inner circle of the current syndicate boss, Jorge Eduardo Costilla S√°nchez. On the other hand, Sylvia Longmire, a drug war analyst, said that C√°rdenas Vela's blood relationship with Osiel C√°rdenas Guill√©n and Antonio C√°rdenas Guill√©n, two former leaders in the Gulf Cartel, makes the arrest a significant event. While cartel members have been living in the United States for years, their desire to not attract attention on U.S. soil means that their behavior is different than how they operate in Mexico. According to The Monitor, several drug lords have been living in the U.S. for years, but generally do not engage in any sort of violent behavior. The last thing they want to do is attract the attention of American law enforcement officers. Court case =Indictment= On 18 November 2011, a federal Grand Jury in the city of Brownsville, Texas indicted C√°rdenas Vela for managing a drug trafficking ring, laundering money, and using false Visa documents. After the arrest, he made his first court appearance the following day, and was ordered held without bond for the charges that were pending. In an effort to conceal the drug distribution, C√°rdenas Vela's organization utilized vehicles which had hidden compartments to conceal all kinds of drugs. In addition, the cartel members often encoded their oral and written descriptions, along with aliases and call signs, to avoid detection. His criminal organization then distributed narcotics across the United States, including but not limited to Houston, Brownsville and McAllen, Texas. The indictment alleges that C√°rdenas Vela paid law enforcement officers in Mexico for protection. He also reportedly helped oversee a network of \\"guardias\\" (guards) by keeping surveillance over the Mexican Armed Forces, law enforcement officials, and rival drug cartels. Moreover, the indictment states that firearms are often used during drug trafficking activities; \\"bullet proof vehicles, automatic weapons, grenades, homemade cannons and body armor\\" were reportedly purchased by C√°rdenas Vela and other members of the Gulf Cartel to further their drug distribution. These weapons were allegedly used by him and other cartel members to fight off Los Zetas, a rival drug cartel that fights for territorial control. The indictment concluded by stating the following: According to the U.S. authorities, C√°rdenas Vela agreed to cooperate with the federal agents, just as his uncle did, for a soother life sentence. First appearance in court C√°rdenas Vela entered the courtroom handcuffed and with his attorneys C.J. Quintanilla and Roberto J. Yzaguirre on 21 October 2011 wearing \\"a messy blue shirt and khaki pants.\\" In soft-spoken Spanish, he told Judge Hanen that he was born and raised in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, and only has a middle school education. The Assistant U.S. Attorney Jody Young read a three-page document out loud from the plea agreement the drug lord had signed as factual, detailing the decade-long career C√°rdenas Vela had in the Gulf Cartel. The documented stated that he had managed the distribution of cocaine and marijuana as the plaza boss in the Mexican cities of San Fernando, R√≠o Bravo, and Matamoros. It was then stated that C√°rdenas Vela had ousted Jos√© Luis Z√∫√±iga, also known as Comandante Wicho, to become the cartel boss of Matamoros, Tamaulipas. According to The Houston Chronicle, the court session was only available to those who were able to walk into the courthouse in Brownsville, Texas or who had subscribed to an online federal document service. =Guilty plea= On 12 March 2012, C√°rdenas Vela pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to possess and distribute cocaine and marijuana in exchange for the government dropping money laundering and immigration charges. With this plea, prosecutors agreed to recommend that his punishment come at the lower end of the scale. But they also said that they are preparing a forfeiture order to seize the assets C√°rdenas Vela, including but not limited to all-terrain vehicles, wave-runners, and a loaded Dodge Charger. Moreover, Jerry Robinette, a special agent-in-charge for ICE, said C√°rdenas Vela's plea was a \\"successful result\\" of the local and federal authorities coordinating \\"to attack the command and control structure of the Gulf Cartel and to minimize its ability to use [the Rio Grande Valley] community as a safe haven.\\" The two bodyguards that were with C√°rdenas Vela during his arrest ‚Äì Francisco Javier Escalante Jim√©nez and Germ√°n Alejandro Hu√≠zar Marroqu√≠n ‚Äì were sentenced in February 2012 for lying to federal agents about the identity of C√°rdenas Vela during his arrest. In Spanish, Escalante Jim√©nez apologized to his family, while Hu√≠zar Marroqu√≠n addressed the court and asked for the \\"lowest sentence possible.\\" The third man that was in the vehicle when C√°rdenas Vela was pulled over by the police on 20 October 2011 declared his true identity to the agents and remains uncharged. In addition, sources outside of law enforcement stated that Huizar Marroqu√≠n was a member of the Tamaulipas State Police. That same month, Judge Hanen put down the sentence the body guards had served. The federal court judge Andrew S. Hanen said C√°rdenas Vela's sentencing is projected for 18 June 2012. =Sentence= On 17 November 2014, C√°rdenas Vela was sentenced to 20 years in prison and was ordered to pay a US$100,000 fine by U.S. District Court Judge Andrew Hanen. The sentence had previously included a forfeit of US$5 million in cash and a property in Brownsville, Texas. The drug lord admitted to smuggling large shipments of cocaine and marijuana from Mexico to the U.S. while working for the Gulf Cartel. Court records showed that C√°rdenas Vela was facing life in prison. However, given his plea deal, his sentence was reduced in exchange for his cooperation with law enforcement. Part of the deal was that he had to describe the inner workings of the Gulf Cartel for federal agents. Family and personal life C√°rdenas Vela is the nephew of Osiel and Antonio C√°rdenas Guill√©n, two former leaders of the Gulf Cartel. He was known in the Gulf Cartel by his aliases: \\"El Junior,\\" \\"El Comandante 900,\\" and \\"El Rolex.\\" References External links * Gulf Cartel Plaza Boss Pleads Guilty in US Court ‚Äì InSight Crime *Dispatch: Implications of a Mexican Drug Lord's Capture ‚Äì Stratfor through YouTube *Gulf Cartel \\"Plaza Boss\\" indicted for drug smuggling, money laundering and document fraud ‚Äì U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Gulf Cartel members Category:People from Matamoros, Tamaulipas Category:Living people Category:People of the Mexican Drug War Category:Mexican mob bosses Category:Mexican prisoners and detainees Category:Mexican people imprisoned abroad Category:Mexican money launderers ","title":"Rafael C√°rdenas Vela"},{"id":"35704750","text":"Apate terebrans, common names shot-hole borer or trunk borer or girdler, is a species of horned powder-post beetles belonging to the family Bostrichidae.

WLBK is the flagship station for Northern Illinois University Huskies football, men's basketball, and women's basketball. History =Early days= In 1946, DeKalb Radio Studios, Inc., applied to the FCC for a construction permit for a new broadcast radio station to operate with 500 watts of power on a frequency of 1360 kilohertz. The new station was assigned call sign \\"WLBK\\". After construction and testing were completed, the station signed on December 5, 1947. WLBK was originally co-owned by Roland Wallem and T.A. \\"Ted\\" Lanes. Wallem served as the new station's business manager and Lanes was both commercial manager and program director. Charles Green was WLBK's original chief engineer. By 1950, Robert C. Brown was both station manager and program director with Donald Whitman as sales manager and Clayton DeWitt as chief engineer. =1950s= In 1951, George Spitz became president of DeKalb Radio Studios, Inc. Robert C. Brown continued as general manager and added both sports director and farm director duties. Zenophon Beake was the chief engineer, Don Ulery the news director, and Lois Montgomery as women's director. In 1952, Ted Beauchamp took over the program director duties with Robert Senne as chief engineer, Don Ulery as sports director, and Lois Montgomery Still, women's director. In 1953, George C. Biggar took over as president of DeKalb Radio Studios, Inc. Biggar also took the general manager and farm director roles. Richard Meier moved up to commercial manager, Robert C. Brown remained as program director and added promotions manager duties, with Robert Zirk as chief engineer and Herb Carroll as both news director and sports director. This lineup would remain stable through the 1950s with the additions of Russell Pigott of news director and W. Dean Clayton as chief engineer. =1960s= Seeking to expand its coverage area and to be able to deliver programming outside its legally mandated daylight-only operation, WLBK applied to the FCC to create an FM sister station to be known as \\"WLBK-FM\\". The new station received its broadcast license on December 17, 1961, and simulcast the AM station's programming during the day while originating its own programming at night. As the FM band grew more popular, WLBK-FM began originating more of its own programming. By 1970 only 30% of its content was a WLBK simulcast and by 1976 the total was down to 15%. The FM station was spun off with fully independent programming and a new call sign (\\"WDEK-FM\\") in 1977. , the former WLBK-FM is licensed as WCLR. Concurrent with the launch of the FM station, WLBK received authorization from the FCC to double its own power output from 500 to 1,000 watts. The 1960s saw other changes for the station. In 1963, Richard M. Hubbell became WLBK's commercial manager and Roger L. Belke took over the chief engineer role. The biggest change came on August 30, 1965, when Jerome F. Cerny acquired DeKalb Radio Studios, Inc. He also took on the titles of president and general manager. Ralph Sherman became the new station manager while Russell Pigott remained as news director and Robert C. Brown kept his job as program director. This lineup of key players remained steady through the rest of the 1960s. =1970s-1980s= The station maintained its long-time beautiful music/middle of the road format through the 1970s and 1980s. As a full service station, WLBK also broadcast local news, up to a dozen hours of farm reports each week, plus national news from United Press International. The 1970s also saw Bill Cerny take the reins as station manager while Jerome F. Cerny remained company president and Robert C. Brown shifted to farm director duties. In 1980, Jerome F. Cerny added chief engineer to his list of duties and resumed his role as the station's general manager. Bill Cerny became both program director and music director while Dick Kliesch was named news director. With Jerome F. Cerny's retirement to Sarasota, Florida, Paul B. Christensen became WLBK's chief engineer in 1981. In 1984, Dianne Leifheit assumed the role of general manager with Jay Burt as news director and Jeff Glass as chief engineer. In April 1985, WCFL Chicago weekend talent Mark Powell was hired as program director and midday host.
