Persons Unknown is a case from the Technology and Construction Court in London. The decision in the case was published on 10 January 2012, and involved a woman who had experienced blackmail and harassment after sexually explicit pictures of her taken on a mobile phone camera were uploaded to BitTorrent file-sharing websites. Background While she was at university in June 2008, the woman, who was referred to in the court documents as AMP, discovered that her mobile phone had been lost or stolen. Previously, around August 2007, the camera on the phone had been used to take photographs \\"of an explicit sexual nature which were taken for the personal use of her boyfriend at the time.\\" Shortly afterwards, she was contacted on Facebook by a person identifying himself as \\"Nils Henrik-Derimot\\", who threatened to expose her identity, post the images widely online and tell her friends about the images if she did not add him as a friend on Facebook. The woman deleted the messages and blocked the sender. Additionally, \\"At about the same time her father's business public relations team were contacted and allegedly threatened and blackmailed about some images but it was not specified that the images were of her\\". On 2 November 2008, the images were uploaded to a Swedish website hosting BitTorrent files. This resulted in the link to the BitTorrent files appearing at the top of the list of search engine searches for her name. AMP's solicitors used the Digital Millennium Copyright Act to remove some of the links from U.S. based search engine results. 2011 case in the Technology and Construction Court After hearing the case on 8 and 19 December 2011, The Hon. Mr. Justice Ramsey granted the woman involved anonymity, and ruled that the Persons Unknown who were seeding (i.e. uploading) the files in question would be breaking the law, and that the IP Address of a seeder could be traced by a court order. The judge cited Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees the \\"Right to respect for private and family life\\", and the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 as the basis of his decision. Reactions AMP v. Persons Unknown was described by The Independent as \\"a landmark\\". The case was believed to be the first time that a court had granted an injunction prohibiting the downloading of specific files shared via BitTorrent technology. Andrew Murray, Professor of Law at the London School of Economics who acted as an expert witness, wrote that the case \\"provides a new approach to the regulation of online content for individuals\\" and could show that \\"content on BitTorrent may just be regulatable after all\\". Conservative MP Louise Mensch said of AMP \\"She has courageously struck a blow for women and privacy\\".

Design and development The Akademische Fliegergruppe of the Technical University of Darmstadt (Akaflieg Darmstadt) was first formed in 1921. It was, and is, a group of aeronautical students who design and construct aircraft as part of their studies and with the help and encouragement of their University. The 1955 D-34 was their first post-World War II design and formed the basis for a series of experimental sailplanes which explored new materials, airfoils and construction methods. The D-34 was a small single seat sailplane, all variants having a wingspan of only . The first three variants shared a common, single piece, wing of straight tapered plan with a root to tip chord ratio of 2.03 and an area of . There were small, cigar shaped tip fairings, termed salmons. The profile was the thick (21% thickness-to-chord ratio) NACA 644621, intended to produce laminar flow over the front 40% of the wing. It was formed around a three box spar of pine and plywood, its cells filled with plastic foam. The spar was less deep than the wing and the surface profile was shaped in ply over a small number of full chord ribs plus a carefully shaped plastic foam block filling. The wing was attached to the top of the fuselage, with cockpit immediately ahead under a removable, smooth, single piece canopy which was faired into the leading edge and extended almost to the nose. To avoid wing surface irregularities the D-34 had airbrakes mounted on the lower fuselage under the wing leading edge, opening like rear hinged car doors. A deep, faired skid served as undercarriage; there was no tail skid. The plywood skinned, oval section fuselage tapered uniformly to the rear. The D-34 had a T-tail with a straight tapered, round tipped, tabbed horizontal surface. The original fin was upright and of narrow chord, carrying a rudder much wider than the tailplane, with a straight, raked trailing edge. The D-34a first flew in 1955. Flight testing showed that the novel wing construction worked well, but that both the ailerons and vertical rear surfaces needed more area. This was addressed by extending the trailing edges of the ailerons beyond those of the wings and extending the rudder rearwards, giving it a more rounded appearance. At the same time a rudder tab was fitted, the fin chord increased and a dorsal fillet added. Various cockpit modifications were also made, including a new, longer version which reached forward over an extended forward fuselage to the small metal nose cone. The fuselage mounted airbrakes were not a success. In 1957 another group of students produced the modified D-34b Aphrodite, with G. Jacoby chiefly responsible for the redesign. It is not certain if this was a new airframe or a rebuild of the D-34a, but it used the same wing design apart from the inclusion of flaps, capable of 60° deflections and longer, lower chord ailerons which extended over the rest of the trailing edge outboard of the flaps. The flaps replaced the unsatisfactory airbrakes of the D-34a but the enlarged ailerons did not produce effective lateral control. The D-34b kept the longer forward fuselage of the modified D-34a, though with a less extended canopy, but had the original D-34 fin and rudder. The upper fuselage behind the cockpit was raised and more strongly faired over the wing, smoothing the upper fuselage line over the trailing edge. It had a retractable monowheel undercarriage and small tailskid in place of the bulky main skid of the D-34a. These changes raised the empty weight from the of the D-34a to . By the time the performance was tested in 1960 the D-34b was showing signs of age but still returned a best glide ratio of 28.3:1, very respectable for a span glider. The D-34c B'phrodite was designed by M. Rade and flew in 1958. The main change was to the fuselage, with the original stressed-ply covered, wood framed structure replaced by a fabric covered steel frame. The monowheel was non-retractable and the wingtip salmons removed. The empty weight was decreased by . The last variant was the D-34 of 1960. Designed, amongst others, by Gerhard Waibel, it kept the D-34b fuselage and tail but married it to a wing of new construction methods, different profile and larger area whilst keeping the same span as the earlier models. To achieve the latter both root and tip chords were increased by about 12%. The wings had 1° of dihedral and 2° of forward sweep. The salmons were replaced by rounded tips and the ailerons were longer and wider than those of the D-34b; just inboard of them inboard spoilers replaced the flaps. Structurally the wing was very different; there was no main spar. The front 60%, from a light, balsa filled nose to a plywood auxiliary spar, was a glass reinforced plastic (GRP) shell with a stiffening paper honeycomb filling. Ailerons and airbrakes were attached to the auxiliary spar. Behind it, the wing had ribs covered with a GRP/plastic foam sandwich. Careful construction kept the local \\"waviness\\" to less than . Though it had a lower aspect ratio (17.5) than the D-34b (20) because of the increased wing area, the D-34d had an improved best glide ratio of 35.1:1. Like the earlier variants, it was not intended as a production or competition aircraft, but as vehicle for the development of students' experience with the new materials of the time.

Academic career Prof. De Boodt was born in St-Truiden, Belgium. In 1948, he graduated from the University of Ghent as an engineer for the chemistry and agricultural industries. He studied as a Fulbright fellow from 1950 till 1951 at Iowa State University in the United States where he obtained a Master of Science in soil physics. He received his doctoral degree at the University of Ghent in 1957 under the supervision of Prof. Dr. L. De Leenheer.Pedon, Staff News, University of Ghent , February 1993, pp. 4-6 In January 1965, he was appointed professor and director of the Laboratory of Soil Physics of the Faculty of Agricultural Sciences at the University of Ghent, where he was in charge of lectures in soil physics and soil pollution. He participated very actively in the development of chemical polymers known as soil conditioners by which soil structurization and stabilization could be promoted almost instantaneously. His first applications were very useful to improve the agricultural production of soils in the temperate regions and in the wet tropics to fight against water erosion. The last applications were mainly dealing with water efficiency in the irrigation systems in semi-arid and arid zones. De Boodt introduced the concept of \\"activating neutral surfaces in soil conditioning\\" It served mainly in desert reclamation and this in an economical justified way. From now on it became possible to treat seedling lines or plant pits of fruit trees and bushes which conserved the water in the root zone and prohibits evaporation at the soil surface. The method which was tried out in Egypt, gained a widespread interest in the other countries of North Africa, the Near East and in China. One of the characteristic features of De Boodt was his love for the effort to bring the message of soil conservation and increased soil production through better soil physical treatment to the people of all nations. The European Market Commission often calls on him to set up important projects of which the desert reclamation in particular should be like the one tried out in Egypt. He often went on missions in Latin America, especially in Peru, Ecuador and Panama, with as topic the erosion repair of new developments for the desert and in Saudi Arabia and the United Emirates for water us efficiency studies. Throughout all these activities De Boodt became convinced that the most lasting effect of scientific collaboration consists in the transfer of knowledge and know-how. Under his guidance more than 100 people were trained and more than 80 obtained an MSc or PhD in soil science. In addition, he was visiting professor in 20 different universities around the world. At the University of Ghent he often has been the president of scientific advisory boards on a national and international level such as the National Science Foundation, the Commission for Agriculture and the Council for the Scientific Research to the Ministry of Agriculture. Prof. De Boodt was the Dean of the Faculty for Agriculture from 1980 till 1984.Decanen faculteit Bio- ingenieurswetenschappen After more than forty years of academic career, Prof. De Boodt retired in October 1991 as Director of the Laboratory of Soil Physics, Soil Conditioning and Horticultural Soil Science. For years he stayed active at the ICE till he died on January 23, 2012 at the age of 85. Organisations In 1980, he was the Belgian National Delegate to the UNESCO Man and Biosphere programme. He was president of the Belgian branch of the American Society for Advancement of Science from 1982 onwards; starting from 1985 president of the Scientific Council of the World Foundation for the Quality of Life and from 1986 onwards president of the International Soil Science Society.

The cyanobacterial clock proteins comprise three proteins: KaiA, KaiB and KaiC. The kaiABC complex may act as a promoter- nonspecific transcription regulator that represses transcription, possibly by acting on the state of chromosome compaction. In the complex, KaiA enhances the phosphorylation status of kaiC. In contrast, the presence of kaiB in the complex decreases the phosphorylation status of kaiC, suggesting that kaiB acts by antagonising the interaction between kaiA and kaiC. The activity of KaiA activates kaiBC expression, while KaiC represses it. The overall fold of the KaiA monomer is that of a four-helix bundle, which forms a dimer in the known structure. KaiA functions as a homodimer. Each monomer is composed of three functional domains: the N-terminal amplitude-amplifier domain, the central period-adjuster domain and the C-terminal clock-oscillator domain. The N-terminal domain of KaiA, from cyanobacteria, acts as a pseudo-receiver domain, but lacks the conserved aspartyl residue required for phosphotransfer in response regulators. The C-terminal domain is responsible for dimer formation, binding to KaiC, enhancing KaiC phosphorylation and generating the circadian oscillations. The KaiA protein from Anabaena sp. (strain PCC 7120) lacks the N-terminal CheY-like domain. KaiB adopts an alpha-beta meander motif and is found to be a dimer or a tetramer. KaiC belongs to a larger family of proteins; it performs autophosphorylation and acts as its own transcriptional repressor. It binds ATP. Also in the KaiC family is RadA/Sms, a highly conserved eubacterial protein that shares sequence similarity with both RecA strand transferase and lon protease. The RadA/Sms family are probable ATP- dependent proteases involved in both DNA repair and degradation of proteins, peptides, glycopeptides. They are classified in as non-peptidase homologues and unassigned peptidases in MEROPS peptidase family S16 (lon protease family, clan SJ). RadA/Sms is involved in recombination and recombinational repair, most likely involving the stabilisation or processing of branched DNA molecules or blocked replication forks because of its genetic redundancy with RecG and RuvABC. History of discovery Due to the lack of a nucleus in these organisms, there was doubt as to whether or not cyanobacteria would be able to express circadian rhythms. Kondo et al. were the first to definitively demonstrate that cyanobacteria do in fact have circadian rhythms. In a 1993 experiment, they used a luciferase reporter inserted into the genetically tractable Synechococcus sp., which was grown in a 12:12 light-dark cycle to ensure “entrainment”. There were two sets of bacteria so that one was in light while the other was in darkness during this entrainment period. Once the bacteria entered the stationary phase, they were transferred into test tubes kept in constant light, except for 5-minute recording periods every 30 minutes, in which the tubes were kept in darkness to measure their levels of bioluminescence. They found that the level of bioluminescence cycled at a near 24-hour period, and that the two groups oscillated with opposite phases. This led them to conclude that the Synechococcus sp. genome was regulated by a circadian clock. (1) =Function in vitro= The circadian oscillators in eukaryotes that have been studied function using a negative feedback loop in which proteins inhibit their own transcription in a cycle that takes approximately 24 hours. This is known as a transcription-translation-derived oscillator (TTO).(2) Without a nucleus, prokaryotic cells must have a different mechanism of keeping circadian time. In 1998, Ishiura et al. determined that the KaiABC protein complex was responsible for the circadian negative feedback loop in Synechococcus by mapping 19 clock mutants to the genes for these three proteins.(3) An experiment by Nakajima et al., in 2005, was able to demonstrate the circadian oscillation of the Synechococcus KaiABC complex in vitro. They did this by adding KaiA, KaiB, KaiC, and ATP into a test tube in the approximate ratio recorded in vivo. They then measured the levels of KaiC phosphorylation and found that it demonstrated circadian rhythmicity for three cycles without damping. This cycle was also temperature compensating. They also tested incubating mutant KaiC protein with KaiA, KaiB, and ATP. They found that the period of KaiC phosphorylation matched the intrinsic period of the cyanobacterium with the corresponding mutant genome. These results led them to conclude that KaiC phosphorylation is the basis for circadian rhythm generation in Synechococcus. (2) =Cyanobacterial clocks as model systems= Cyanobacteria are the simplest organisms that have been observed demonstrating circadian rhythms.(2)(3) The primitiveness and simplicity make the KaiC phosphorylation model invaluable to circadian rhythm research. While it is much simpler than models for eukaryotic circadian rhythm generators, the principles are largely the same. In both systems the circadian period is dependent on the interactions between proteins within the cell, and when the genes for those proteins are mutated, the expressed period changes. (1)(2) This model of circadian rhythm generation also has implications for the study of circadian “evolutionary biology”. Given the simplicity of cyanobacteria and of this circadian system, it may be safe to assume that eukaryotic circadian oscillators are derived from a system similar to that present in cyanobacterium.

On December 5, 1916, the driver of a small two-horse mail wagon was ambushed as he was riding to the town of Jarbidge, Nevada. The driver was killed and $4,000 was stolen, however, three suspects were arrested shortly afterward, including a horse thief named Ben Kuhl. Kuhl would eventually become the first murderer in American history to be convicted and sent to prison by the use of palm print evidence. The stolen $4,000 was never recovered and is said to be buried somewhere in Jarbidge Canyon. According to author Ken Weinman, the Jarbidge Stage Robbery is one of the \\"best authenticated buried treasure stories in Nevadas long history.\\"https://www.scribd.com/doc/48988148/America- s-Last-State-Robbery-in-1916-in-Jarbidge-Nevada Background In 1916, Jarbidge, Nevada, was one of the state's most isolated communities, located within Jarbidge Canyon, along the Jarbidge River, about 100 miles north of Elko, Nevada, and sixty-five miles south of Rogerson, Idaho. There was a Native American village nearby, called Owyhee, but it was just as remote as Jarbidge. The town was founded as a tent city in 1909, due to a gold rush, which brought about 1,500 people to the area. The winters there are very severe though and by the spring of 1910 the population had reduced to just a few hundred. Ken Weinman wrote: \\"The miners had staked their claims on the snowdrifts covering the ground to a depth of as much as 18 feet, but when the snow melted in late spring, it exposed the exaggeration of the newspaper reports, and about 80 percent of the prospectors became disgusted and pulled up stakes and headed elsewhere.\\" In many western states and territories, the turn of the century was no great change. Technological advancements were often slow in reaching isolated communities. Jarbidge was no exception. There was only one treacherous dirt road that led to the town and only one means of communication with the outside world, the United States Mail stage. Furthermore, in winter, twenty to thirty foot snow drifts could cut off the community for several weeks at a time. Automobiles had not yet made it to Jarbidge, so riding horses and driving wagons were still the main modes of transportation. Because Rogerson, Idaho was the closest railroad town to Jarbidge, the wagon driver, Fred Searcy, made round trips to and from, not only delivering mail, but also company payrolls for the local miners. Robbery December 5, 1916 was payday for the miners. When Searcy failed to arrive in town at the expected time, a small group of men began to assemble at the post office, assuming that heavy snow was the cause of the delay. But, as the day went on, Searcy did not appear. Postmaster Scott Fleming asked a man named Frank Leonard to ride up to the top of Crippen Grade, a 2,000 foot decline in the road that led down to the canyon floor and the town. Leonard returned a few hours later, saying he could not find Searcy or the wagon. Fleming and the others were very concerned at that point. Over four feet of snow had fallen that day, which made the idea of sliding down the grade into the Jarbidge River seem like a real possibility. Fleming quickly formed a search party, but before leaving he telephoned a woman named Rose Dexter, who lived about a half mile north of Jarbidge, along the grade. According to Ken Weinman, Rose Dexter said that the stage had passed by her house earlier that day and that she waved to the driver. She also said that the driver was \\"huddled up on his seat with his collar pulled up over his face to form some protection from the blinding snow.\\" The search party quickly found the mail wagon, less than a quarter of a mile from the town's main business district. The stage was pulled over on the side of the road and hidden behind a patch of willow trees. Fred Searcy was found \\"slumped in his seat and almost covered with snow.\\" An unopened mail pouch was also uncovered, but the second pouch, containing $4,000 (approximately equivalent to $97,560 of 2019) was missing. Weinman says that at first the search party thought that Searcy had frozen to death in the extreme cold, but closer examination revealed that he had been shot in the head at a very close range. Powder burns in his hair and on his scalp were observed. Because the snow storm that was raging showed no sign of letting up, the search party returned to town with the intention of continuing the investigation of the area on the following morning. So, on the next day, the search party attempted to re-enact the crime using evidence found at the crime scene. According to Weinman, it was determined that the assailant must have hidden in the sagebrush along the road and jumped aboard the little wagon to kill Searcy and take control. However, the Nevada State Archivist, Guy Rocha, claims that Ben Kuhl later confessed to the murder and said that he killed Searcy over a dispute about how to split the money, alleging that Searcy was in on the crime. After the re-enactment, another patrol around the area was made and the searchers found both human and dog footprints in the snow. The tracks led down to the river and at its bank a blood stained shirt was found lying on the ground. While the search party was looking around, a stray dog that had been following the group began scratching at the dirt. A few seconds later, the dog unburied the second mail pouch. The bottom was cut open and $4,000 in bills and gold coins was missing. The clue was an important find, but the fact that the dog seemed to know right where it was buried raised suspicions that the animal tracks the group was following were made by the very same animal. The search party compared the dog's feet to the footprints in the snow and it was a perfect match. Then they wondered about who the dog would follow through the storm and they decided that Ben Kuhl was the one the dog was most attached to. Aftermath A mug shot of Ben Kuhl at Nevada State Prison in 1917. Kuhl and two of his associates, Ed Beck and William McGraw, were arrested at their cabin without any trouble and a .44 caliber ivory-handled revolver was found in their possession. According to Ken Weinman, Kuhl proclaimed his innocence, saying that he spent the night in the Jarbidge saloon. Witnesses confirmed that they saw Kuhl in the saloon, but because they could not say at what time their testimony was meaningless. Kuhl could have left the bar, committed the crime, and then returned in a relatively short amount of time. After his arrest, a background check revealed that Kuhl had a long criminal record. In 1903, he served four months in jail at Marysville, California for petty larceny and, at some other time, he was sent to the Oregon State Penitentiary for stealing horses. Furthermore, Kuhl had recently been released from jail on a $400 bond and had already been arrested in Jarbidge previously, for trespassing on private property. The trial was held in the Elko County Courthouse, District Judge Errol J. L. Taber presided over the case and District Attorney Edward P. Carville was the prosecutor. The evidence gathered by the search party was all circumstantial, but two forensic scientists from California linked a bloody palm print on an envelope to Kuhl. For this, Judge Taber sentenced Kuhl to death and gave him a choice as to how it should be done. Kuhl chose execution by firing squad, but the Nevada Board of Pardons later voted to commute his sentence to life in prison. Beck received a life sentence as well and McGraw turned state's evidence. All three were transferred to the Nevada State Prison together in October 1917. Kuhl spent almost twenty-eight years in prison before his release on May 16, 1945. At the time of his release, Kuhl had served more prison time in Nevada than anyone else in the state's history. Weinman says that the $4,000 was never recovered and that Kuhl never admitted to the crime or the existence of buried money, even though the police offered him time off his sentence if he revealed its location. Beck was paroled on November 24, 1923. Today the town of Jarbidge remains a small and isolated place with a population of less than 100. Many of the old buildings that stood during the time of the robbery are still intact, including the jail house in which Kuhl was held. In 1998, a plaque was placed in front of the jail, it reads: > Jarbidge Jail. Built after the town was removed from the U.S. Forest by a > 1911 Presidential proclamation it replaced the constables home or Forest > Service cabin to restrain rowdy miners and hold suspects for arrival of a > sheriff deputy.

He was born in 1877 in Ikuru Town, and had his primary school education at St. Paul’s School, Opobo/Nkoro, from 1887 to 1895, and secondary school education at the Wesley Boys’ High School, in Lagos. At that time, Christianity was already sweeping through the entire Western Region of now Nigeria and the Niger Delta, through the evangelistic activities of the Church Missionary Society with Bishop Ajayi Crowther as the pioneer Missionary. So, trained in Lagos, John Ikuru embraced Christianity and became exposed to Christian ethics and philosophy.Tasie, G. O. M. Christian Missionary Enterprise in the Niger Delta, 1864-1918, p. 244 Leiden: Brill, 1978. In 1900 his father, King Ikuru Efuya, died, and it became obvious that John Ikuru would be the next Okama (Ruler) of Ikuru Town, Andoni. That came true in 1904 when he was invited to return and rule his people. Also in 1904, the British conducted a Punitive Expedition against the still- heathern Obolo people and Yok- Obolo at Alabie (Agwut-Obolo) because of their aggression against other groups in the area heathenism. The British destroyed their House of Skulls and the Shrine of Yok-Obolo in 1904, and split Andoni into six parts, each attached to one of the six Native Courts in the Niger Delta. Ikuru Town was attached to Opobo Town Native Court and Alabie (Agwut Obolo) to Bonny Native Court. M. D. W. Jeffrey said that the purpose of doing this was to destroy Andoni as a political entity. When John Ikuru returned from Lagos to Ikuru Town in 1904. Evidently, he had a herculean task in his hands. He came back with a ‘Bible’ in one hand, and “chalk” in the other. His father was a rich trader and had laid a solid foundation for him. Soon, he was able to build a palace in Ikuru Town from where he started his evangelistic work. He produced a small group of followers whom he sent out to the other villages to Christianize them and initiate some rudimentary education in such places: To Okoroete, he sent Ralph O. Ikuru To Ngo, he sent Sylvanus Ikuru To Ebukuma, he sent James Accra To Oronija, he sent Samuel Ikuru To Akaradi, he sent George Ekprikpo; and To Ataba, he sent Julius Urombo5 These young men revolutionized not only ecclesiasticism in these places, but also education. John Ikuru was made a Warrant Chief by the Colonial Administration and attached to the Opobo Native Court. In 1913 he was able to prevail on the Colonial Administration to open a Court in Obolo (Andoni) as the people were now Christians. Existing Records claimed that at that point it was the only such Native Court in the Federation. Very soon he and Chief Ereforokuma were able to take legal action against the Opobo for violating the Obolo-Opobo Treaty of 1869, when they started migrating to other Obolo land not given to them in 1869. Unfortunately, because of leadership problems between him and Chief Ereforokima, the Colonial Administration closed down the Court in 1922 and transferred the case to the 6 Calabar branch of the Supreme Court. In 1925–26, the Supreme Court passed judgment, granting the Obolo (Andoni) their requests. First, the “Andoni Mainland” remained exclusive to the Obolo (Andoni) people. Also the tribute payable to Yok-Obolo by King Jaja had its name changed to “Customary gifts,” and Opobo Town was given three islands instead of one which was given to Jaja in 1869,Opobo and Nkoro was given one island exclusive to them. The Colonial Administration, particularly M. D. W. Jeffrey’s, had observed that through the Oru, they the Obolo (Andoni) could administer themselves and therefore approved the granting of a Native Court. It was established in 1930, at Agafor, with Ralph O. Ikuru as the Scribe. From then, the Obolo (Andoni), not only unified their segments, scattered all over the Niger Delta, but started ruling themselves. In all these, John Ikuru was instrumental and pushed Obolo (Andoni) forward as a member of the Oru.Ejituwu, Nkparom C. A History of Obolo (Andoni) in the Niger Delta. Oron: Manson Pub. Co, 1991. By 1930, John Ikuru had opened the main Church building, St. Simon’s Anglican Church, in Ikuru Town, whose foundation stone was laid by Bishop A. M. Gelsthorpe on February 22, 1937; it became the ecclesiastical headquarters of Obolo (Andoni). Ikuru was a Knight of the Order of St. Christopher (KSC) awarded posthumously. Economically, King (Sir) John Ikuru was a wealthy palm oil merchant, with trading posts in Ekpirikpe, Azumini, Uruafoug, Ndiya and Ekpenukpa in Ibibio land in present day Akwa-Ibom State of Nigeria. He came to be regarded as the symbol of light and enlightenment in Obolo (Andoni) history. This is not only in terms of the spread of the gospel in the area, but also in terms of the spread of education in the area. As the only person in the area with secondary school education at that time – he was very close to the British Colonial Administrators in Opobo Division of Calabar Province, where Andoni was. Apart from M. D. W. Jeffrey, John Ikuru was virtually the “Voice of Obolo” and the source of the coming to Obolo (Andoni) of the Native Court in 1930. John Ikuru died in 1947, after having trained a large number of clerics and secondary school leavers. Also, he was married with many children.

Analytical Description The composer describes the composition as a ‘quintuple concerto’ for the five nationalities of its original begetters: German for the guitarist Reinbert Evers; Lithuanian for his wife, the pianist Igina Mauzaite (although the concerto never included a piano part); Brazilian for the ‘cellist Matias de Oliveira Pinto; the Spanish ancestry of the composer’s wife, the soprano Andión Fernández; and the composer’s own Chinese parentage. Composed in Berlin between 2 March and 2 July 2008 and revised in 2011-2012, the concerto is about half an hour in duration, and divides into a slow and a quick movement, in each of which the five musical races combine in diverse ways: The opening \\"Passacaglia à la sarabande\\" alternates three statements of a “V-I-L-N-I-U-S” motto (A-A-E-G-A- G-Eb) with three presentations of the Sarabande from J. S. Bach’s Fifth Suite for unaccompanied ‘cello (BWV 1011), each incorporating some figurative or abstract representation of a national element: sheng-type chords, quotations of zither music, and poetic fragments from mediaeval China; the rhythms and harmonies of Brazilian indigenous and popular music; the dissonant polyphony, nonsense syllables, and wide vocal glissandi of the Lithuanian sutartines; and in the optional soprano solo at the movement’s core, some Spanish lines from the Miguel de Cervantes novel Don Quixote. The concluding \\"Fuga concertante\\" exactly doubles the proportions of the finale of J. S. Bach’s Fourth Brandenburg Concerto (BWV 1049), as well as literally doubling its contrapuntal premise into a double fugue on two Lithuanian folk songs. As in the Bach, the fugal ritornelli are interspersed with elaborate cadenzas for the instrumental soloists, in one place in the form of the actual tracing on the guitar and ‘cello fingerboards of the Chinese brushstrokes for the ideographs for ‘broken string’. Where the movement divides at the Golden ratio, the string players stand and slash the air with their bows, to announce a structural demarcation usually left concealed by composers. During the fifth ritornello, the soprano’s first movement solo recurs in fragmentary guise as a wordless vocalise, so that in this movement the Spanish as well as Chinese presence survives only in allusive form. On the other hand, the Afro-Brazilian elements come into their own as a candomblé ceremony in miniature, the ethnomusicologically documented drumming, cowbell, and clapping effects all mimicked by the string orchestra and solo guitar without any actual percussion. The concerto ends with the dense Baroque counterpoint of solo guitar and ‘cello unwinding into silence like a rundown motor, by means of well-coordinated coups de grâce administered to the soloists’ tuning pegs by three players from the orchestra. Premiere As a result of the Audience Prize awarded the composer's opera Das Waisenkind for the 2009-10 season, the work was premiered by the Erfurt Philharmonic under Walter E. Gugerbauer in Theater Erfurt on 19–20 January 2012. The soloists were Reinbert Evers (guitar), Matias de Oliveira Pinto (violoncello), and Andión Fernández (soprano). Reception Critical reception was divided, one review stating baldly, \\"Musik ist es nicht\\", but another was more enthusiastic: > Jeffrey Ching – born in 1965 in the [former] Spanish-American colony of the > Philippines, the son of Chinese Buddhist parents – presents himself in his > musical work as a wanderer between cultures.

Wellington, New Zealand Levin, born in 1818 in London, England, came to the new settlement of Wellington in 1841 and set himself up in business selling drapery hosiery and haberdashery on Lambton Quay in partnership with Abraham Hort junior who would become his brother-in- law. Levin & Co The business soon moved to importing food and liquor and exporting whale oil and whale bone and gradually established itself as a shipping and land agency. Sheepfarming grew as whaling declined and wool exports replaced the whaling products. In 1862 he went into partnership with Charles Johnson Pharazyn. By 1868 Levin was depressed by the stagnation of the business of the colony and decided to arrange his affairs so he might return to England. He ended his partnership with Pharazyn and the business activities were taken over by his eldest son W H Levin in partnership with Charles Pharazyn and Walter Woods Johnston. At the end of 1869 he and his wife left for England. Redfern Alexander & Co He became a partner in the firm of his former London agents for 12 years, retired in 1882 in his mid-60s and died in 1903, his wife Jessie the following year.

The novel tells the story of the rise and fall of a fictional world surfing champion Dennis Keith. The character of Dennis Keith was inspired by the life of the Australian surfer Michael Peterson. The Life was published in 2011 and is the thirteenth book by Knox and his fourth novel. The book is to published in France under the title Shangrila by the Editions Asphalte, in May 2012. Plot summary The Life traces the life story of Dennis Keith, now obese, mentally unwell and living in a retirement village with his mother. A young would-be biographer arrives one day and begins to tease out his past. The story is told in different strands, one being reflections by Dennis (often in a variety of styles – first person, then third person) and also present-day conversations with the biographer. Dennis is a poor gold coast kid who is mysteriously found and adopted by his mother \\"Mo\\" Keith. Dennis and his stepbrother Rod become obsessed with surfing at an earlier age. They prove to be talented and daring surfers and soon develop a reputation. They start entering competitions and eventually enter the nascent pro circuit, all the while descending into heavy drug use. Dennis stumbles into an intermittent relationship with the singer Lisa Exmire. Lisa is found murdered and eventually charges are laid. Dennis's drug use escalates and he drops out of the pro circuit. The novel concludes by revealing the truth about Dennis's family, the murder and the biographer. Themes * the commercialisation of surfing as it becomes a professional sport * the development of the gold coast and change in small towns * drug use * mental illness * the nature of celebrity Characters * Dennis Keith * \\"Mo\\" Keith – Dennis's mother * Rodney Keith – Dennis's brother * Megan – (the “Bi-Fricken-Ographer”) * Lisa Exmire – singer, Dennis's girlfriend. * FJ – friend, surfer * Tink – friend, surfer Biographical elements Several reviewers have noted the similarities of Dennis Keith to Michael Peterson. These similarities include: * grew up in Coolangatta /Gold Coast/ Kirra Point * poor upbringing, mother who once peeled prawns for a living * renowned for the “cutback” manoeuvre. * aviator sunglasses * successful the 1970s * took a famously chaotic trip to the USA in the early 1970s with the Australian surf team, * appeared in a famous surfing movie, surfing at Kirra * long periods of heavy drug use and mental illness It has also been suggested that some of the other characters in the book closely resemble other professional surfers including \\"FJ\\" being very similar to \\"PT\\" (Peter Townend) and \\"Tink\\" bearing a resemblance to Wayne \\"Rabbit\\" Bartholomew. Critical reception The Guardian wrote \\"If Winton is an aria, Knox is early Rolling Stones\\", \\"The Life confirms what The Literary Review has known all along – 'Knox is, quite simply, a fabulous writer.'\\" Christos Tsiolkas, author of the best selling novel The Slap wrote \\"The Life, is alternately evocative and lacerating, tender and unflinching, a gloriously honest, brutal and moving story of a man who was at the top of his game and then pissed it all away\\".

Background Polye had first entered Parliament in the 2002 general election, as a member of the National Alliance Party, whose leader Sir Michael Somare became Prime Minister. In August 2011, the NAP-led Somare government was brought down in a parliamentary motion of no confidence (whilst Somare was recovering from surgery in hospital), leading to a split in the party, between members who remained loyal to Somare, and others - including Polye - who joined Peter O'Neill's new government. In October, it was reported simultaneously that the party was expelling the latter, and that Polye had assumed leadership of the party. What had happened was a split, with two opposing factions both claiming to constitute the party. In January 2012, Polye purported to de-register the NAP, despite the existence of a rival faction. The members of his faction reconstituted themselves as the Triumph Heritage Empowerment Rural Party, ahead of the June 2012 general election. The new party was officially launched at the Granville Motel in Port Moresby on 23 January.\\"National Alliance party sack 12 parliamentarians, leader calls on party executives to resign\\", Pacific Islands News Association, 14 October 2011\\"POLYE FORMALLY SPLITS SOMARE’S NATIONAL ALLIANCE PARTY\\", Pacific Islands Report via Pacific Islands Development Program, 17 January 2012\\"PNG’S DEFUNCT RULING PARTY REFORMS AS ‘T.H.E. PARTY’\\", Pacific Islands Report, 24 January 2012\\"New PNG political party to focus on strengthening family unit\\", Radio New Zealand International, 24 January 2012 When three National Alliance MPs (Timothy Bonga, Sasa Zibe and Bob Dadea) chose to join O'Neill's People's National Congress Party rather than Polye's new party, Polye reportedly said \\"that the battle lines for the formation of new government after the coming elections were being drawn between his new party and O'Neill's party\\", suggesting the two parties would become the major political forces of the country, eclipsing what was left of the National Alliance. Values and policies During his inaugural speech which launched the party, Polye said it would be \\"focusing on trying to restore Christian values, the churches to give counselling on the value of the family unit as family is the foundation of a stable society\\". It would also, he said, address the issues of \\"climate change, environment and wildlife conservation\\". The party would seek to promote a \\"diversified economy\\", and, in terms of foreign policy, would \\"modernise strategic partnerships\\". He added: > \\"I want a policy to improve the salary, working and living conditions for > all professional public servants, a rural and urban housing scheme, > strengthening the village court system through improving salaries and living > conditions, strengthening existing delivery systems by DSIP, promoting > gender equity, free education for all ages and to support technical skills.\\" In addition to the acronym it produces, Polye explained the name of the party as follows: * Triumph: \\"Everyone shall use their intelligence given by God to creatively triumph over all shortcomings, problems and obstacles\\"; * Heritage: Papua New Guinea was a multi-cultural country, but family values were its common heritage and a source of strength; * Empowerment: \\"Everyone shall pursue people empowerment policies and programmes that enable our people by giving them the mental as well as the physical capacity and strengths to make independent personal choices and decision for themselves and their families\\". Founding members Upon its launch, the party reportedly included 22 MPs, including nine Cabinet ministers. Among its founding members were Jeffery Nape (parliamentary Speaker), Benjamin Poponawa, Alphonse Moroi, Mark Maipakai (Minister for Intergovernment Relations & District Development), Tom Olga (Governor of the Western Highlands Province), James Gau, Benjamin Mul, Andrew Mald (Minister for Community Development, Religion, & Family Affairs), Philip Kikala, Mathew Poiya, Pitom Bombom, Sali Subam (Minister for Sports), Sai Beseo (Minister for Correctional Services), David Arore (Minister for Higher Education, Research, Science, & Technology), Miki Kaeok, Yawa Silupa, Buka Malai, Michael Sapau (Governor of Manus Province), Ano Pala (Minister for Foreign Affairs & Immigration), Peter Humphreys and Leo Dion. Subsequent developments In March 2014, Don Polye was dismissed from Prime Minister Peter O'Neill's government, for not abiding by Cabinet solidarity. In May, with their party leader now sitting on the Opposition benches, Cabinet ministers Douglas Tomuriesa (Forestry), Delilah Gore (Higher Education) and Benjamin Poponawa (Labour and Industrial Relations) all resigned from the party, staying with the government.\\"Resignations en masse from PNG political party\\", Radio New Zealand International, 21 May 2014 In September, the party was expelled from the government coalition.\\"PNG political party officially out of coalition\\", Radio New Zealand International, 10 September 2014 References External links * Official site Category:Conservative parties in Papua New Guinea *Main Category:Christian democratic parties in Oceania Category:Christian political parties in Papua New Guinea ","title":"Triumph Heritage Empowerment Party"},{"id":"34479966","text":"Meat Grinder (; ) is a 2009 Thai splatter film written and directed by Tiwa Moeithaisong, starring Mai Charoenpura in the lead role. The film revolves around a poverty stricken woman who starts a restaurant where she slaughters people and serves up human flesh, cut from her victims. The film was released with cuts in Thailand on 19 March 2009, with a duration of 84 minutes. The Thai version by far deviates the most from the uncensored version. This is not only due to the amount of censorship but many scenes were completely re-cut. Added to that are several strange warnings, harmless and irrelevant alternative footage, additional scene in the shorter version, changes in running-speed and even a blur effect due to censorship.Meat Grinder: Comparisons between Thai DVD and UK DVD Classified as containing \\"strong gory violence and horror\\", an uncut 18 rated version was released in the United Kingdom with a duration of 102 minutes on 23 August 2010, which met with criticism.MEAT GRINDER (18) - British Board of Film ClassificationMeat Grinder: Uncut for UKFilms that outraged viewers in 2010: The Telegraph The film was also banned twice in South Korea for extremely high themes and violence, strong sex, language, horror and imitation risk.Meat Grinder: Human Noodle (After self-assessment) : Limited screening price - Korea Media Rating BoardMeat Grinder: human flesh noodle: Limited screening price - Korea Media Rating Board The film met with negative responses.The Meat Grinder (2009) - IMDbThe Meat Grinder (2009): Rotten Tomatoes Synopsis But (Mai Charoenpura) is a disturbed woman who hears voices in her head and is tormented by visions. Having been taught some pretty dubious and unconventional food preparation and cooking skills by her mother, she decides to open up a noodle stall, using the body of a man left over from a riot as the main ingredient. Soon enough, the customers are turning up in droves for her delicious meals, and life is starting to look good after a nice young man takes an interest in her. However, her past comes back to haunt her, and as her mental state breaks down, yet more people end up on the chopping block or hanging up on meat hooks in her basement. The film also tackles the themes of mental illness and the mistreatment of women, with But's behavior being depicted as being part of an ongoing cycle of violence that she suffered as a child, and which she is now passing on to her own daughter.

NetGalley was developed as an alternative to the production of paper galleys, and has since evolved into a key marketing and publicity platform for publishers and authors. Publishers that offer e-galleys include Hachette, Harlequin Enterprises, Penguin Random House, Simon & Schuster, and many others in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the UK, and the US. The site offers electronic galleys to \\"professional readers\\" such as bloggers, book reviewers, booksellers, educators, journalists, and librarians. History The NetGalley website was created in 2008 as a joint venture between Firebrand Technologies and Rosetta Solutions. Initially launched shortly before the 2008 BookExpo America, the site was founded by Rosetta Solutions, and Firebrand Technologies took over in December 2008. NetGalley has since widened its roster of publishers and range of reviewers, and has begun offering services to publishers in France, Germany, and the UK. In 2012, the site began offering expedited approvals to librarians who added their American Library Association member number. NetGalley also began a partnership with the Library Journal for reviews of original ebooks in the romance genre; Library Journal stated it was \\"a move designed to address 'the skyrocketing popularity of ebooks in U.S. public libraries'\\". In October 2012, the NetGalley website relaunched, addressing numerous performance and scaling issues related to an old architecture, improving existing features, and introducing new ones. Features The site layout allows users to search the books available for review by publisher, genre, or date of upload onto NetGalley.

In a career that lasted from April 1828 to 1831 he ran twenty-five times and won fifteen races, with several of his wins being walkovers in which all of his opponents were withdrawn. In the summer of 1828 he ran a dead heat with The Colonel in the Derby, before winning the race in a deciding run-off. He went on to have a long and successful racing career, winning a further eleven races before his retirement, and developing a notable rivalry with his contemporary Zinganee. Cadland was disappointing as a sire of winners in England and was exported to France, where he was much more successful. He died in 1837. Background Cadland was a brown horse standing 15.3 hands high bred by his owner the Duke of Rutland. His dam was the Duke's highly successful racemare Sorcery, who won The Oaks in 1811 and several other important races. As a broodmare, however, she had been a disappointment and had been barren for two years before being sent to a cheap and undistinguished stallion named Andrew in 1824. Andrew, a well-bred but not particularly successful racehorse, had attracted little attention as a sire, and was covering at a fee of one guinea when Sorcery was one of only three or four Thoroughbred mares sent to him in the year of Cadland's conception. Racing career =1828: three-year-old season= The colt who would become Cadland was unraced at two and was still unnamed at the start of 1828, being known as \\"The Sorcery Colt\\" after his dam. His racing career was scheduled to begin at the Craven meeting at Newmarket in April 1828 with a run in a match race but his opponent, a colt named Segar was withdrawn, allowing his owners to collect the £100 forfeit. At the next Newmarket meeting he ran as \\"Cadland\\" for the first time to win a two-runner Produce Stakes on 21 April, running away from his only opponent. He then reappeared the following day for the 2000 Guineas. Racing on soft, muddy ground, he started at odds of 5/1 and won by a head from Lepanto, with the favourite Navarino finishing well beaten. At the same meeting he recorded his first official walkover when the other eight runners in a Sweepstakes were withdrawn by their owners. Cadland beats The Colonel in the deciding heat of the 1828 Derby as depicted in an aquatint by James Pollard. At Epsom on 15 May, Cadland started the 4/1 second favourite for the Derby in a field of fifteen runners. The Colonel, one of the leading two-year-olds of the previous season when he had easily beaten Lepanto, was made favourite at 7/2. The Colonel was trained in Yorkshire by John Scott and ridden by his brother Bill, while Cadland was ridden by his usual jockey James \\"Jem\\" Robinson. After two false starts, the race got under way with Robinson immediately sending Cadland into the lead. He set a strong pace and by the turn into the straight at Tattenham Corner, The Colonel, Zinganee, Alcaston and Omen were the only other horses left in contention. In the straight the race became a match between the first and second favourites who ran side by side throughout the final quarter mile. A furlong from the finish The Colonel gained a slight advantage, but Cadland rallied and the two colts crossed the line together. After a short delay the judge declared a dead-heat. According to the rules of the day, such a result required the horses to run again over the same course unless both of the owners agreed to divide the prize money. The Colonel's owner, Mr Petrie, declared that he had no intention of dividing and so the deciding heat took place after the next race. A description of the day in The Sporting Oracle claims the mood was one of \\"concentrated and absolutely astounding excitement\\". For the rematch, The Colonel started a slight favourite, with the view being taken that his stamina and \\"stouter\\" pedigree would be decisive. Some observers, however, noticed that Bill Scott was \\"nervous almost to the point of agitation\\" at the prospect of taking on Robinson, who was known for his excellence in closely run races. Robinson himself, by contrast, appeared calm and collected, pausing for a pinch of snuff before mounting for the rematch. Once again Cadland made the early running before The Colonel moved up to challenge him in the straight. On this occasion, however, the Northern horse was unable to get to the lead and Cadland maintained a narrow advantage throughout the closing stages to win by a margin reported as either a neck or half a length. The Sporting Magazine commented that \\"Such a Derby was never before seen and possibly never will again\\", while the racing historian John Orton claimed that \\"Two finer races were never before seen\\". In autumn Cadland was not sent north for the St Leger (which The Colonel won) but raced instead at Newmarket, as he would do for most of his career. On the Monday of the First October meeting he led from the start in the Grand Duke Michael Stakes and won easily by two lengths. Two days later he won the Newmarket St Leger \\"in a canter\\", finishing fifty yards clear of the runner-up. Commenting on these successes the Sporting Magazine observed that Cadland, for all his ability, was not a \\"free pleasing\\" runner, often seeming reluctant and idle in his races. At the Houghton meeting his owners claimed the forfeit money when Bessy Bedlam, his opponent for a match race, was withdrawn. He ended the season undefeated, with five competitive wins, one walkover, two match forfeits, and almost £6,000 in prize money. =1829: four-year-old season= Cadland made his first appearance of the 1829 season in the £200 Claret Stakes on 24 April at Newmarket. He started 4/7 favourite but his unbeaten run came to an end as he finished last of the three runners behind Zinganee, in an upset described by the New Sporting Magazine as \\"a thunder-bolt\\". In a very strong field (described by one commentator as \\"without parallel\\") for the Ascot Gold Cup on 18 June Cadland finished third to Zinganee and Mameluke, with The Colonel and Green Mantle (Epsom Oaks) among those behind him. The spectators for this race included King George IV who was at that time The Colonel's owner. At Newmarket in autumn, Cadland was unbeaten in three races. On 1 October, carrying 147 pounds he won a King's Plate, beating his only rival, a colt named Mariner. At the next Newmarket meeting two weeks later he won the Oatlands Stakes, a handicap race, beating six opponents under a weight of 122 pounds. On 30 October, Cadland met Zinganee again, at level weights in the Audley End Stakes. He completed his hat-trick, winning by a head from Zinganee with the other two runners finishing well beaten. =1830: five-year- old season= Cadland by John Frederick Herring, Sr. Cadland ran six times at Newmarket in the early part of 1830. His first race saw him matched against Zinganee yet again in the Craven Stakes on 12 April. He started 3/1 second favourite with Zinganee on 6/1. On this occasion neither horse ran to his best form, with Cadland unplaced behind the filly Seraph. At the next Newmarket meeting Cadland walked over for a £50 race over three miles. On the following day Cadland ran in a one-mile match race in which he failed to concede seven pounds to the six-year-old Maresfield. Later that afternoon he collected £100 without having to race as he walked over for a King's Plate. On 10 May Cadland carried top weight of 128 pounds in a Handicap in which he finished third to Navarin, a four-year-old carrying 98 pounds. Cadland's spring campaign ended with another walkover in the Jockey Club Plate three days later. In autumn, Cadland was beaten by his only rival, the four-year-old Gayhurst in a £50 race on 5 October. His next race was for The Whip, a four-mile challenge match for an antique trophy consisting of a riding whip said to have been owned by King Charles II and later modified to incorporate hairs from the mane and tail of Eclipse. At level weights, Cadland claimed the trophy by beating Zinganee in their sixth and final encounter, but the race was extremely grueling for both horses: Zinganee never ran again and some commentators believed Cadland never produced his best form in his subsequent races. At the Houghton meeting, Cadland walked over for a £25 race on 1 November. Four days later at the same meeting he finished third in the Audley End Stakes, carrying top weight of 130 pounds. =1831: six-year-old season= On 4 April Cadland carried top weight in the Oatlands Stakes and finished second to the filly Varna, to whom he was conceding seventeen pounds. At the next meeting he won a £100 Sweepstakes, conceding twenty-four pounds to the filly Galopade. On the following day he dead-heated with Varna over three miles at weight-for-age and then beat the filly in a run-off. In the course of this meeting Cadland became the property of Mr E. Peel and ran for his new owner in his race against Varna. On 3 August, Cadland raced away from Newmarket for the first time in more than two years when he finished third in the Oxford Cup behind Mazeppa. He appeared at Burton-on-Trent on 23 August, where he walked over in the local Cup. At Lichfield on 13 September he was beaten by a gelding named Jocko in the first heat of a Royal Plate and was withdrawn from the second. Although he was entered for further races, Cadland never ran again and was retired to stud. Assessment and honours A pub in the village of Chilwell in Nottinghamshire is named after Cadland. Another English pub, The Running Horses at Mickleham, Surrey is named in honour of both Cadland and The Colonel, with one horse depicted on each side of the pub's sign. The Cadland House Stables, which include some of the oldest stable buildings in Newmarket, were once owned by the Duke of Rutland and were named after his Derby winner. Stud career Cadland began his career as a stallion at the Bonehill stud farm near Tamworth in Staffordshire. His initial fee was 10 guineas for Thoroughbred mares and 4 guineas for others. Cadland had little success with his English runners and in 1833 he was sold and exported to France. He became an \\"important and influential\\" sire in his new country, siring the Prix du Jockey Club winner Romulus and the Prix du Cadran winner Nautilus. Cadland died in France in January 1837. Pedigree *Cadland was inbred 2 x 3 to Sorcerer, meaning that this stallion appears in both the second and third generations of his pedigree.

The song opened the album of the same name. The song was recorded twice. The first version of the song (without the orchestra) was later to appear on Sketches for Odessa and has a duration to 6:40. The song was a very long song about the survivor of a shipwreck, and was originally intended to form the basis of the whole album. Musically it was dominated by strings and acoustic guitar.http://www.brothersgibb.org/history-part-4.html It was originally proposed to be the first single of the album. In 2010, the song appeared on the 4CD compilation Mythology on the disc devoted to Robin's work with the group. Inspiration and recording Its title was inspired by a travel brochure Robin had seen. The geography of \\"Odessa\\" must not be taken too literally, although a man sailing in the Atlantic Ocean and the Baltic Sea is as far from the port of Odessa (then part of the USSR) as he seems to feel in the lyrics. One possible inspiration is the true story of the Ellan Vannin, a packet ship which sank in the Irish Sea on its way between the Isle of Man and Liverpool on 3 December 1909. The romantic date of February 14th (St Valentine's Day) replaced this and stayed, while the year changed to 1886 and then 1899 for the final release. This was a major work and it took a few sessions to get a take they liked. The lyrics are written in the stream-of- consciousness style, telling the story of the survivor of a fictitious British ship called Veronica, floating on an iceberg in the Baltic Sea. The instrumental track is led by an acoustic guitar played by Maurice and cello by Paul Buckmaster. The song was called \\"Odessa (on the White Sea)\\" in this early version, and Barry identifies the ship in a spoken intro as a Dutch ship called Anne Strauss and the date as 14 February 1866. The first version is heard on Sketches with Maurice or Robin on mellotron and an orchestral section that is less full than the finished take. This reel would follow the preceding one, since it ends with what is called a retake of \\"Odessa on the White Sea\\", probably the final take of the song, to which the orchestra was added later. The song's demo begins with a longer spoken intro by Barry saying, February 14th 1866, the Dutch ship Anne Strauss was lost at sea and was wiped off the British royal register of shipping. There were no survivors. In the finished version the date has changed to 14 February 1899 and the ship is named Veronica. The lyrics are almost identical, although the reference to the English nursery rhyme Baa Baa Black Sheep is missing at the demo. \\"I worked and worked on that 'Odessa' track\\", Robin said, \\"and I got a ring from Robert Stigwood to say it was the greatest pop classic he had ever experienced. He said it was stupendous, and I used to get calls from him at three and four and five and six in the morning telling me the same thing. I thought it was going to be the new single\\". Stigwood praises Robin for this song as well as \\"Lamplight\\": \\"The fact is that [Robin] has incredible and wonderful imagination. This is shown in the lyrics of his composition 'Odessa', which is, I think, one of the finest pop songs ever written\\". Musical structure The song is built around a simple verse-chorus form, but with added opening and closing sections, all performed in a stately tempo. After Robin sings about the ship in an orchestral opening, and some introductory lines are sung by the group, the song settles into the first verse and Robin singing solo to sparse accompaniment of rhythm guitar and quiet piano. The voices build to a big, slow chorus of all three voices led by Robin in an operatic style. For the second verse, the electric bass was added and proceeds at a faster pace through the same melody, into an even more intense chorus, augmented by a cello part by Buckmaster and some high notes by Robin. The extended closing section has a rhythmic instrumental and wordless vocal, building in power and then dropping off and back to the opening orchestra and vocal part until the song is finished.

The band are known for their powerful guitar riffs, great vocal melodies and groovy drums. Their main influences are AC/DC, Alice in Chains and Metallica.  History  = Beginning = The seed of what became Lost Gravity was sown two years earlier, in 2005, when Breno relocated to Hamburg for a few months to write some songs. Some of these songs became the core of Lost Gravity current setlist like Anywhere But Home and No Way Out. Other songs which were written later, Selfish and Venom in a Vial, were inspired by his time in Germany. In 2006, back in Brazil, Breno joined a Bruce Dickinson tribute band which toured all over the State of Sao Paulo. Motivated by that tour, in 2007 Lost Gravity was born in London. = Full band = The first line-up had Chris Finnerty on the drums, an amazing drummer who once auditioned for a project of Irish songs that Breno was involved. Chris never joined that project and months later randomly bumped into Breno on the London Underground, who told him about the idea of forming Lost Gravity and showed him the songs. Chris liked them and was in for the ride. Al Davies (vocals) and Jon Campbell (bass) completed the first Lost Gravity line-up. At a time when most bands in London were playing indie music, Lost Gravity was bringing grunge music back to the local scene. In its first year of existence, Lost Gravity played a few shows in the London area and went through many line-up changes. = Recordings = In January 2008, Lost Gravity recorded their first EP, Anywhere But Home, featuring four tracks: Anywhere But Home, See It Through My Eyes, Venom in A Vial and No Way Out. The line-up at the time was Breno Val (guitar), Mariek Knowles (vocals), Jon Campbell (bass) and Chris Finnerty (drums). When they toured to promote the EP, Bull and Gate promoters described them as \\"the power and energy of Alice in Chains, Megadeth and Soundgarden\\". The title track, Anywhere But Home, was played all over the world in many online radio stations. Radio Basile from Florida described them as \\"outstanding alternative rock stuff! Wonderful songs, great energy, very talented indeed! Absolutely spectacular\\". During 2008 the band played extensively all over London in known venues like The Bull and Gate, The Arts Theatre Club and Fiddlers Elbow. The following year, 2009, Lost Gravity had an almost complete line-up change, only founding member Breno Val remaining. Singer Heath Billin and bassist Steve Reddihough (former member of The Machines, currently with Treason) joined the band after replying to an online ad posted by Breno. The band, stronger than ever, played once again all over London and for the first time outside the city in places like Reading, Guildford and Milton Keynes. Promoter Andozka from Milton Keynes described them as \\"They put their all into everything! They were bloody AWESOME!\\". At the end of 2009 the band recorded their second EP, Selfish, featuring Breno Val on guitars and bass, Heath Billin on vocals and Cesar Dellore on the drums (Breno's long time friend from Sao Paulo). The front cover of the EP has a famous painting by German artist Otto Dix, Mädchen vor dem Spiegel, painted in 1921, which was destroyed during World War II bombings. The EP was released in two different formats: digital download and physical cd. The online version included four tracks: Selfish, Friendly Fire, All The Same and Heal. The physical CD came with a bonus track, No Way Out, previously released on Anywhere But Home EP. Australian website Evolution Guitar video reviewed the EP in February 2010. Mic Buvac said \\"give these guys a good listen because they’ve got quite a sensibility and feeling to their sounds, but they are very very gutty, balls-to-the-wall rock.\\" In 2010 bassist Richard Waldie and drummer Victor Stoyanov joined the band. That year the band once again played many gigs all over London to promote their second EP. For their first time they played in high-profile venues like The Water Rats and The 12 Bar in London. In March 2010, Breno Val was the special guest of Total Rock's radio show Anarchy on the Airwaves, presented by Mad Maz. = Power trio = After the departure of Heath, in 2011 Breno took over the vocals, bassist Sherlock Michaels (former member of Storm The Gates) and Colombian drummer Phil Ochoa joined the band. On 3 March 2011, for the first time Lost Gravity performs as a trio in an awesome show at The White Lion (Streatham- UK). Glenn Milligan from Metallville webzine describes the band as \\"a London based trio that seem to match up metal and commercialism all at once. They are damn good at this style\\". Lost Gravity played many gigs in and around London throughout 2011. One of the most important was on 2 May 2011 to raise funds for the victims of the Japanese tsunami. On that occasion Breno dressed up with a Japanese robe while Sherlock wore a Japanese schoolgirl outfit, all in the name of charity. Andy White, singer from Bleed to This joined them on stage for an encore and together they played Metallica's Enter Sandman. During 2011 the band also made all their music available for free download or pay as you like to adapt their model to the mp3 age where most fans choose to download the music rather than buy the albums. Their third EP simply named Lost Gravity III was released via Priston Records in June 2012 featuring 3 brand new songs and one acoustic version of Selfish that it was recorded live. In Autumn 2012 bassist Iggy Nulli and drummer Giuliano Kolling joined the band. The first gig with the new line-up took place at The White Lion, Streatham (London) on 9 November 2012. During the year of 2013 the band played gigs all over London and for the first time ever the band managed to have a stable line-up for over 12 months. On 7 January 2014, through their Facebook page, the band announced the departure of bassist Iggy Nulli. No reasons were given. After Iggy's departure the band entered the studio and recorded their first full-length album self-titled Lost Gravity. It was recorded in 12 days at Freefall Studios London. Breno recorded guitars, bass and vocals. Giuliano recorded the drums and backing vocals. The album was released on 13 October 2014. = Power duo = After the departure of bassist Connor Meighan, the band became a power duo with Breno on guitar/vocals and Giuliano on the drums. For the live shows they've started using the bass on a backing track. In September 2017, the band enters the studio to record their second album. How to Make a Giant, featuring 8 new tracks is released on 12 March 2018. In october 2019 Giuliano Kolling leaves the band after playing his last show with Lost Gravity at the famous St. Moritz Club in Soho, London. In April 2020 the band introduces their new drummer Giles Kitchingham through their social media pages. Giles is also known for his work with English band Spit Like This. Coincidentally, Lost Gravity and Spit Like This shared the same stage back in 2008 at The Bull and Gate in Kentish Town, London.

From the time of the Maharajas, the Raash Chakra in Cooch Behar is made by a Muslim family of ghughumari area every year. This year, 2019, the CHAKRA has been built b=y Altab Mian. The fair is held just 100m from the Madanmohan Temple. A symbol of secular mood in the district. This Raash-Chakra (a 30–40 ft tall and 15–20 ft width semi-cylindrical like structure made out of paper and bamboo/posts) symbolises brotherhood irrespective of the religious diversity. It quite resembles the Dharma Chakra of the Buddhists and thus it unifies the Sanatana Hindus, Buddhists and Muslims in a single chord of harmony. This Raash-Chakra is beautifully decorated with paper floral designs and different pictures of Sri Krishna are pasted all over. It rotates on a pivotal mast. Devotees rotate this Raash-Chakra to attain bliss and happiness. Raash Mela Festival The Raash Mela is perhaps the grandest of all festivals which are celebrated all throughout the year in Cooch Behar. The fair that is held centered round this festival is conducted with such grandeur to hold enough significance. It attracts large crowds of people not only from all over the district of Cooch Behar, but also from neighboring districts including adjacent state of Assam and Tripura. According to local history in 1812 AD Maharaja Harenda Narayan entered his palace on the auspicious day of Raash Purnima. The celebration began from that year. Later, in 1889 Maharaja Nripendra Narayan expanded the festival with a grand fair. After the end of Koch Dynasty, the functions of the Maharaja are performed at Raash Mela by the District Magistrate, Cooch Behar who is also the President of Debottar Trust Board. The District Magistrate, Cooch Behar offers Pujo to Madanmohan and rotates the Rashchakra, which marks the beginning of the Raash Mela Festival and fair. In 2019, the District Magistrate, Cooch Behar Shri Pawan Kadyan, IAS performed these duties as per tradition like all his predecessors. The fair is held beside Madan Mohan Temple near Bairagi Dighi area. During the fair the entire area of Sagadighi, Bairagidighi, Rifle Club Road, Maharaja Biswasingha Road, Madanmohan Mandir etc. are congested with devotees and visitors. The fair is an ideal place of unification of local folk art and crafts. People thronge at the stalls of such items. The handicrafts items made of bamboo, wood, stone, metal are high on demand. So many cultural programes are organised during the 15 days long fair too. This Raash Mela has developed a tradition of its own. It holds a separate identity to the people of Cooch Behar for their uniqueness and indigenous clarity.

This species grows to a total length of . Description The fan-bellied leatherjacket grows to a total length of about . It is a laterally-compressed fish recognisable by the upturned, pointed snout, the filamentary extension on the fan-shaped caudal fin, and the large dewlap on the underside of the fish. The foremost dorsal fin consists of a long erectile spine with a shorter one behind it. The hindermost dorsal fin has 28 to 34 soft rays and the anal fin has 27 to 34 soft rays. The colour is variable depending on its environment, being dark when swimming over beds of mussels and cream or tan when above a sandy seabed. In each case there are irregular darker blotches and streaks. Distribution and habitat The fan- bellied leatherjacket is native to the Indo-Pacific. Its range extends from Malaysia and southern Japan, through Indonesia and Samoa to western, northern and eastern Australia. It is a demersal species and is found in estuaries and on algae-clad rocky coasts as well as over muddy and silty seabeds, on seagrass meadows and on reefs, both on and offshore, to depths of about . Biology The fan-bellied leatherjacket is diurnal and omnivorous, appearing to detect its food by sight. Besides feeding on algae and seagrass, it preys on small invertebrates such as amphipods, caridean shrimps, copepods, tanaids, bryozoans, hydroids, polychaete worms and tunicates. It does not appear to digest seagrass and algae well, but nevertheless, many carbon compounds are assimilated from these foodstuffs during the digestion process. About 40% of the diet is animal matter, and this species is very dependent on encrusting organisms and the epiphytic algae and invertebrates present in a seagrass meadow.

Published by Taylor and Francis. History =Coventry and District Tramways Company= Initial steam powered tramway services were provided by the Coventry and District Tramways Company between Coventry and Bedworth from 1884 to 1893. A proposed extension to Nuneaton was withdrawn owing to opposition. The steam trams seem never to have been very successful, frequently de-railing and experiencing difficulty in ascending the Bishop Street gradient. The service headway was one hour. Steam traction ceased in 1893, after which there was no tramway service until 1895.A History of Coventry Tramways, F.K.

This company was a subsidiary of the New General Traction Company. The contractors for the electrification were the General Traction Company of Westminster, and the work was carried out under the supervision of Graff Baker and Winslow. Much of the equipment was supplied by the Westinghouse Company, and the Peckham cantilever trucks for the tramcars were also American. Coventry was the first tramway in Britain to have side poles with span wires to carry the overhead electrification. The first electric tram ran to Foleshill Depot (grid reference ) on 5 December 1895 and the service was extended to Bedworth one week later. A new depot was opened at Priestley's Bridge (grid reference ) during 1899. On 6 March 1900 a tramway postal service was inaugurated, which continued until the end of tramway operation 40 years later. In latter days the postal car left Bedworth at 8.50pm, showing 'Postal Car' in red letters on the route indicator. The letter-box was fixed to the outside of the rear dash. In 1896 the company made a profit of £3,360 (equivalent to £ in ). By 1911 the profit had reached £12,599, (equivalent to £ in ). the highest in the company history. On Sunday 15 December 1907, car 9 overturned on turning the corner into Lower Ford Street after descending Far Gosford Street. This company was taken over by the Coventry Corporation in 1912 at a cost of £202,132 (equivalent of £ in ). For the history of the Corporation's bus operations in the city, see Coventry Corporation Transport.

In 1899 a new power house was built at Priestley's Bridge. This took in the engines from the Foleshill Depot, and two new direct coupled 250 r.p.m sets with Browett, Lindley & Co engines and 100 kW, 6 pole generators. These remained until January 1930 after which power was obtained from the Coventry Corporation Electricity Supply department and converted by two 500 kW Bruce Peebles rotary converters, installed in 1914, and a 1,000 kW Brush motor–generator installed in 1930. =Coventry Corporation Tramways= The Corporation purchased the entire undertaking on 1 January 1912 for £220,638 9s 0d, met by a 30-year loan. This included 10.5 miles of single track, 2.6 miles of double track, 41 tramcars, with another in construction, the depot at Foleshill Road and the depot, boiler house and power station at Priestley's Bridge on Stoney Stanton Road.Coventry Transport 1884-1940 by A.S.Denton & F.P.Groves published 1985 by the Birmingham Transport Historical Group. In 1912 the Corporation ordered ten new vehicles from Brush Electrical Machines of Loughborough. These were delivered in phases between 1913 and 1914. A further vehicle was delivered in 1916. The fleet was expanded further after the First World War with new vehicles arriving in 1921, 1925, 1929 and 1931, which took the total fleet size to 73. Services developed such that by 1926 there were three full-length cross-city tram routes with seven short workings. A new tram loop was opened in 1926 from Greyfriars Green along Queens Road to Albany Road, joining the existing Earlsdon route. Four years later, the last extension was opened from Bull's Head Lane along Binley Road to Uxbridge Avenue, for the new General Electric Company plc telephone works. By 1938 the tram services were confined to the Bell Green and Bedworth tram routes.

After 1933, maroon replaced chocolate, and \\"City of Coventry\\" was painted on the rocker panels which was finally replaced by \\"Coventry Transport\\". Car 52 appeared in 1939 in a livery which was entirely cream except the window frames, which were maroon. Closure German photograph of the destruction caused in the Coventry Blitz The first air raid to affect tram services occurred on 12 October 1940, when several bombs, including one at the top of Bishop Street, caused the Bedworth service to be cut back from Broadgate to Eagle Street. Two days later a bomb just beyond Foleshill Depot caused the Bedworth service to be curtailed at that point. On 24 October, the service was restored between Broadgate and Foleshill Depot. The Bell Green route operated in two sections on either side of the Price of Wales cinema, Paradise, as the result of the raid on 12 October 1940. There were sufficient cars isolated on the outer end of the route to operate the service on the Bell Green side of the crater. The through service was restored on 14 October but on 23 October the route began to operate in three sections as a result of further damage. By 28 October repairs had been made to allow the service to operate in two sections with a break at Peel Street. This break was repaired and through service was about to be restored when the heavy raid of 14 November 1940 brought all services to an end. The damage caused by heavy bombing during the Coventry Blitz was too great to be repaired, and the remaining system was abandoned in February 1941. Reintroduction A new light rail system for Coventry known as Coventry Very Light Rail is planned with the first line planned to be operational by 2024.

History Healing the Wounds was founded by Kevin Richards in 2009. Richards had previously served with the Royal Regiment of Wales as a combat medic and completed tours of duty in numerous countries including Northern Ireland and Operation Desert Storm. His involvement with the Royal Welsh Veterans Association and his own background in army medicine led him to recognise the lack of support for PTSD sufferers in Wales and made him determined to do something to help. Campaigns =Golden Grove Mansion Appeal= Since Healing the Wounds' foundation, the charity campaigned to raise funds to purchase and maintain a convalescent home based at Golden Grove Mansion in Llandeilo, Carmarthenshire. However, by January 2011 the condition of Golden Grove had deteriorated to such an extent that it would not have been financially viable to renovate and maintain the mansion as a retreat for PTSD sufferers. Nevertheless, Healing the Wounds remains devoted to the development of a convalescent home within Wales and the £120,000 raised through the campaign shall be spent on treatment for those suffering from PTSD. Fundraising activities =Nation Radio campaign= Between 14 November and 2 December 2011, Healing the Wounds was chosen as a nominated charity for a fundraising campaign by South Wales radio station, Nation Radio.

Duke University Press. Article Stable URL: http://www.jstor.org/stable/285867. pp. 87-90 Barrès claimed that authoritarian democracy involved spiritual connection between a leader of a nation and the nation's people, and that true freedom did not arise from individual rights nor parliamentary restraints, but through \\"heroic leadership\\" and \\"national power\\". In the fascist and quasi- fascist regimes that governed Italy, Romania, and Spain from the 1920s to the 1970s, authoritarian democracy was promoted as an alternative to liberal democracy, multi-party based democracy was dismantled and replaced by corporatist representation of state-sanctioned corporate groups that would unite people into interest groups to address the state that would act in the interest of the general will of the nation and thus exercise an orderly form of popular rule. Italian Fascists argued that this authoritarian democracy is capable of representing the different interests of society that advise the state and the state acts in the interest of the nation. In contrast, fascists denounced liberal democracy for not being a true democracy but in fact being un-democratic because from the fascist perspective, elections and parliaments are unable to represent the interests of the nation because it lumps together individuals who have little in common into geographical districts to vote for an array of parties to represent them that results in little unanimity in terms of interests, projects, or intentions, and that liberal democracy's multi-party elections merely serve as a means to legitimize elite rule without addressing the interests of the general will of the nation. Hitler denounced parliamentary and pluralistic electoral democracy but he repeatedly invoked democracy to describe Nazism, and called for a \\"Germanic democracy\\", once saying \\"National Socialism is the true realization of democracy\\" and another time saying \\"We wild Germans are better democrats than other nations\\".Roland N. Stromberg. Democracy: a short, analytical history. Armonk, New York, US: M.E. Sharpe, 1996. pp. 93-94. Nazi Germany's propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels described Nazism as an \\"authoritarian democracy\\" on 31 May 1933 in a speech before the press. Nazi political theorist Walter Gerhart affirmed the concept of authoritarian democracy as being able to link authority with the people's will that would be the anti-thesis of liberal democracy that he claimed lacked authority and divided people in an atomistic society. Jacob Talmon identifies as Nazism as promoting a \\"totalitarian democracy\\", while W. Martini identifies it as a \\"hyper-democracy\\". What W. Martini claims is that the Nazi regime appealed directly to the masses without institutional and social checks and balances of liberal democracy.

On the night of 16 March 1870, she shipped anchor in Southampton just before midnight being due in Jersey some 12 hours later. The ship was operating under an agreement between the Steam Packet Company and the British government for the carriage of Her Majesty’s mail to the Channel Isles. The agreement stated that vessels undertaking this duty were to make ‘the best of their way’ on the run and stop only for ‘the saving of life’. Late arrival was penalised by a charge £50 an hour. Until the night of 16 – 17 March 1870, the PS Normandy had never defaulted on its contractual obligations. On the bridge of the Mary at the time of the collision, were Mr Griggs, the first mate and the captain of the vessel, Captain Stranach, together with the helmsman. Incident summary Normandy was captained by Captain Henry Beckford Harvey and carried 28 crewmen, including chief mate J. Ockleford, an experienced officer with more than 16 years in the employ of the Company, the stewardess, Mary Charlotte Wilson and 31 passengers, of which 12 were women. The principal cause of the collision was that the Mary was covered by the edge of a dense bank of fog and was hidden from the view of the officers on the bridge of the Normandy which was, until the moment of the collision, under a clear sky. Mary was moving at less than 2 knots and was sounding her fog-horns, her crew conscious of the precariousness of the situation. Just after 0339, the officers on both ships became aware of each other’s presence. It was, however, too late to change course and, despite the rapid and almost simultaneous orders issued by Mr Ockleford on the Normandy and Captain Stranach on the Mary, the Normandy passed in front of the Mary which connected with her side just astern of her starboard paddle wheel causing extensive damage and carrying off the starboard lifeboat. As the momentum of the two ships was lost, the Normandy immediately began to take on water. After the collision, Captain Harvey ordered the two remaining portside lifeboats to be launchedNautical magazine, Volume 39, Nautical topics of the day, Brown, Son and Ferguson, 1870 p.215-217 and ensured that all the women were placed on board first. There was no more room for those who remained onboard the Normandy. One of the rescued passengers was later to comment, ‘The Captain behaved with the greatest coolness and judgement under such trying circumstances. All the gentlemen stood back and made no attempt to get into the boats until the ladies were in them. During the whole occurrence extraordinary order and quietness prevailed, and the greatest fortitude was shown. I last saw Captain Harvey on the bridge, giving orders for the management of the boats and engines.’ One lifeboat was launched from the Mary but did not reach the Normandy as Mr Andrews, the second mate of the Mary who was in command of the lifeboat sent to search for those left on the Normandy, did not continue for fear that the Mary herself was in danger of sinking. Although the ruling of the official enquiry was that the Normandy was at fault, the actions and the heroism of Captain Harvey, who died after having ensured that the passengers would be first to abandon the ship, was strenuously defended and praised by Victor Hugo, who also recommended that London and South Western Railway equip its ships with watertight bulkheads, sufficient life jackets, and floating lights.Letter to the editor of the Star, 5 avril 1870, in Actes et Paroles vol.4 p.262-263 Court ruling The Greenwich Police Court judged on 11 April 1870 that Normandy was found to have infringed Articles 14 and 15 of the Regulations for Preventing Disasters at Sea and \\"noted with dissatisfaction\\" the conduct of the second mate of Mary for returning to Mary with a lifeboat without reaching Normandy.

Autokabalesis can be an act of suicide or due to a psychiatric disorder. Studies Autokabalesis was studied in 1979 by Sims & O'Brien K. A 1992 study found that many suicidal acts of autokabalesis were committed by young males who were unemployed and single. A 1988 study of 28 persons hospitalized as a result of autokabalesis showed most fallers had serious psychiatric disorders. Examination of data from between 1990 and 1998 of suicide by autokabalesis within New York city showed the highest number of deaths were among those aged 65 and over (Abrams et al 2005). Prevalence Between 1987 and 1990, 39 people were treated at the University Hospital Bochum in Bochum, Germany with injuries sustained by autokabalesis. A 1998 study (Joyce & Fleminger) reported that according to the British Office of Population Censuses and Surveys from 1990 to 1994, 4% of all deaths by suicide were accountable by autokabalesis or from jumping in front of moving objects. Reports of cases of suicide by autokabalesis are complicated by doubt as to whether death was caused as a result of murder (homicide). Evidence for suicidal intent, according to psychological opinion is thought to be, previous suicide attempts, depression, a history of mental disorder, or current psychiatric admission, and the leaving of possessions at a cliff top.

He won the British Home Countries Championship in 2009, and two Commonwealth Games medals in 2010 (Silver in Team and Bronze in Doubles).Commonwealth Games Results (Retrieved 24 January 2012). In the summer of 2011, he transferred to German club TTF Liebherr Ochsenhausen in the top division, the Bundesliga, having played for second division club FC Tegernheim the previous season. From 2009 to 2010 Pitchford played for Aarhus BTK in the best Danish league. In July 2014, his contract with Ochsenhausen was extended by three years. In the autumn of 2011, he beat World number nine Vladimir Samsonov and World junior number three Wu Jiaji in international competitions, paving his route to becoming number one in the English rankings in November 2011. He finished the year with a career- high World ranking of 171 to become the third highest-ranked British player on the ITTF World Ranking list, and was subsequently part of the Team GB squad for the London Olympics in 2012. Pitchford has won national singles titles at U14, Cadet, U21 and Senior levels, and doubles titles at U14, Cadet, Junior and Senior levels. He is the reigning men's singles national champion (March 2015). In 2014 he was part of the England men's team which clinched promotion to the top level of world table tennis at the World Team Championships in Japan. Pitchford represented England at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, winning a silver medal in the team competition as Singapore took gold in a repeat of the 2010 result. He also won a silver medal alongside Tin-Tin Ho in the mixed doubles, and won the bronze medal in the men's singles.

Life Saull was born at Byfield, Northamptonshire on 21 April 1783, the son of William Saul and Elizabeth Devonshire. He married Elizabeth Weedon in 1808. He was a wine merchant of the firm of Saull & Saddington. He was in business at 19 Aldersgate Street, London, and then moved a few doors to 15 Aldersgate Street which also was his residence, around 1830. Collector Saull accumulated at 15 Aldersgate Street a large geological collection, together with some antiquities, mostly from London. It was described by John Timbs in 1855: W. D. Saull's Iguanodon sacrum. In the scientific rivalry between Gideon Mantell and Richard Owen, Mantell borrowed the fossil from Saull and did more work developing it from its matrix, publishing detailed results to correct Owen's 1842 Report. Owen later wrote that the Dinosauria were largely based in their characters on this one specimen, now BMNH 37685 in the Natural History Museum.Dean, p. 235; Google Books.William Antony S.

Saull began to swap fossils with Gideon Mantell, a fellow collector, in 1830.Dennis R. Dean, Gideon Mantell and the Discovery of Dinosaurs (1999), p. 132; Google Books. In 1831 he purchased the geological collection of James Sowerby, previously on display in Lambeth;Philosophical Magazine, September 1831, p. 287; archive.org. in 1833 he made it known that the weekly viewing time for his collection was open to working people, and in 1835 he rebuilt his museum. Among Saull's exhibits was the sacrum of Iguanodon, mentioned by Richard Owen in one of his Reports on British Reptile Fossils.Richard Bowdler Sharpe, The History of the Collections Contained in the Natural History Departments of the British Museum (1906, reprinted 2000), p. 322; Google Books. This specimen originated in the Isle of Wight, and is now in the Natural History Museum; the significance of the fused vertebrae with it came to Owen after his 1841 BAAS talk in Plymouth. It was a key step in postulating the Dinosauria.James O. Farlow, M. K. Brett-Surman, The Complete Dinosaur (1999), pp. 183–4; Google Books. In fact Owen reviewed numerous specimens in 1842, of which those held by George Bax Holmes and Saull were the prominent examples in private hands; the sacrum has been called a \\"major factor\\" in erecting Dinosauria, and has been regarded as the first true dinosaur specimen.R. T. J. Moody, Martill. M. D., E. Buffetaut, D. Naish, D. M. Martill, Dinosaurs and Other Extinct Saurians: A Historical Perspective (2010), p. 22; Google Books. Activist Saull's interests in radical causes were broad. He spoke at the \\"Optimist Chapel\\" of Pierre Henri Joseph Baume, around 1830.I. J. Prothero, Artisans and Politics in Early Nineteenth-century London: John Gast and his times (1981), p. 261; Google Books. He was a backer of the unconventional ministries of Rev.

Josiah Fitch of Stepney;Iain McCalman, Radical Underworld: prophets, revolutionaries, and pornographers in London, 1795–1840 (1998), p. 190; Google Books. and he also supported, with Julian Hibbert, Richard Carlile's lease of the Surrey Rotunda; he lectured himself at the Rotunda in 1832.Christina Parolin, Radical Spaces: Venues of popular politics in London, 1790–c. 1845 (2010), p. 200 and note 105; Google Books. He was nominated in 1832 to the National Political Union, a reformist group;David R. Green, Pauper Capital: London and the Poor Law, 1790–1870 (2010), p. 92; Google Books. George Jacob Holyoake relates that when Hibbert died, he had charged Baume with getting his head to Saull and his museum, for phrenological purposes.George Jacob Holyoake, History of Co- operation vol. 2 (1916), p. 550; [archive.org https://archive.org/stream/historyofcoopera02holyuoft#page/550/mode/2up] Saull was close to the group around Robert Owen, serving on the council of the Owenite Equitable Labour Exchange, also in 1832;George Jacob Holyoake, History of Co-operation vol. 1 (1916), Ch. VIII p. 105; online. and he spoke in 1833 at an Owenite meeting in Charlotte Street, in favour of liberalisation of divorce.The Crisis, 11 May 1833; Google Books. He addressed Owenites at Bristol in 1833 and put forth the theory of man's evolution from monkeys or apes, an idea he derived from Sir Humphry Davy.Richard A. Rempel (editor), Uncertain Paths to Freedom: Russia and China, 1919–22, Bertrand Russell Collected Papers vol. 15 (2000), p. 482; Google Books. This \\"simian hypothesis\\" was inconsistent with the editorial line of The Crisis where it was published in October 1833, which came down against the antiquity of man and human speciation.Max Beer, A History of British Socialism Volume 1 (2001), p. 330 note 2; Google Books. At the end of 1833 Saull was one of a group who employed William James Linton to fit out a room in City Road as a \\"Hall of Science\\", in which Rowland Detrosier was to lecture.William James Linton, James Watson (1879); online. The following year the Hall was active, controlled by James Watson, and Saull associated there with Watson, John Gast, and other \\"Finsbury group\\" radicals.Prothero, p. 308; Google Books. When in the 1830s the government successfully prosecuted Henry Hetherington, who had evaded the stamp duty on newspapers, Saull acted as treasurer of a \\"Victim Fund\\" for those pursued for selling unstamped papers;D. J. Rowe (editor), London Radicalism 1830–1843: A selection of the papers of Francis Place (1970), pp. 134–146; British History Online. the fund was an 1831 initiative of Hibbert and Saull with John Cleave and William Lovett, backed by the National Union of the Working Classes.Joel H. Wiener, The War of the Unstamped: the movement to repeal the British newspaper tax, 1830–1836 (1969), p. 203. Saull joined a London Anti-Corn Law Association in 1836.Archibald Prentice, History of the Anti-Corn-Law League vol. 1 (1853), pp. 49–50;archive.org. In 1844, to support the faltering Owenite movement, he took a mortgage on the Rosehill (or Rose Hill) property that was part of one of its utopian schemes.Edward Royle, Robert Owen and the Commencement of the Millennium: a study of the Harmony community (1998), p. 236; Google Books. This was part of a scheme of retrenchment implemented by William Pare, after the Harmony Hall estate in Hampshire had over-extended its finances, taking in Rosehill and another farm; Owen himself settled at Rosehill.Ronald George Garnett, Co-operation and the Owenite Socialist Communities in Britain, 1825–45 (1972), p. 196–7; Google Books. He also supported the John Street Institution, a London centre for Chartism, by contributing to building costs.Joseph Mazzini Wheeler, A Biographical Dictionary of Freethinkers of all Ages and Nations (1889), p. 291; archive.org. Member of learned societies Saull was elected Fellow of the Geological Society in 1831, and Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1841; he was also a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society., and a member of other societies, including the Société Géologique de France, and the London Phrenological Society. He was on the Council of the Ethnological Society of London in 1850.Regulations of the Ethnological Society of London (1850); JSTOR https://www.jstor.org/stable/3014129?seq=3. Death and legacy Saull's name on the lower section of the Reformers memorial, Kensal Green Cemetery Saull died on 26 April 1855, and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery, near the graves of his radical friends Henry Hetherington and Allen Davenport. He had purchased a plot there in 1849, announced in The Reasoner for 12 September that year, shortly after Hetherington's death;archive.org. the ground was unconsecrated. He is also listed on the Reformers Memorial near the entrance to Kensal Green Cemetery. Saull's collections passed to the Metropolitan Institution, located in Cleveland Street, London, and managed by the trustees of his estate. They were never unpacked there, however. In the end the British Museum purchased around 200 objects, in 1863.Sharpe, p. 217; Google Books. The bulk of the collection was taken, questionably, by John Calvert.Charles Davies Sherborn, Where is the – collection? (1940), p. 29; Google Books. Cleveland Hall in Cleveland Street was built with a legacy from William Devonshire Saull, and in 1861 replaced the John Street Institution as the London center of freethought. The hall was controlled by its shareholders, and these changed over time, so it was not always used for freethought purposes. Eventually it was acquired by Hugh Price Hughes for his West London Methodist Mission. Works and views Saull wrote a tract in the form of a letter to a local vicar (1828), arguing from comparative mythology.Tracts, 1820–30 p. cxcix; Google Books. His interest in palaeontology was connected to his opposition to religious theories of creation; it has been said that \\"in Saull's case Deism was a mask for materialism\\".Prothero, p. 263; Google Books. In writing to The Mechanics' Magazine edited by Sholto Percy in 1833, conveying the opening of his collection to visitors, he ended with the thought: > Education is the most important of sciences; and in practice we must > necessarily divest our minds from every prejudice which has hitherto > trammelled and prostrated the minds of youth.The Mechanics' Magazine, > Museum, Register, Journal, and Gazette, Volume 19 (1833), pp. 117–8; Google > Books. Saull read papers to the Geological Society in 1849, and to the Society of Antiquaries in 1841, 1842, and 1844. His essays on coupled astronomical and geological phenomena (published in 1836 and 1853) contain his own very original opinions. Gideon Mantell defined Saull's topic in the 1853 version Essay on the Connexion between Astronomical and Geological Phenomena as \\"hypothetical causes of conditions and changes of temperature in former periods of the earth's history\\".Gabriel Mantell and Thomas Rupert Jones (editor), The Wonders of Geology: Or, A Familiar Exposition of Geological Phenomena (1858), p. 773 note; archive.org. Saull also republished, adding a preface, An Essay on the Astronomical and Physical Causes of Geological Changes, by Sir Richard Phillips, attacking the Newtonian theory of gravitation. It was answered by Sampson Arnold Mackey in a Lecture on Astronomy (1832). His scientific views were discussed at some length by William Floyd Karkeek, writing on The Geological History of the Horse in The Veterinarian in 1841. His stratigraphy was based on granite as fundamental, from which coral might generate spontaneously. He believed in evolution based on changing physical conditions on earth, over a very long timescale.The Veterinarian, February 1841, p. 69; Google Books. Subsequently, Saull took an interest in archaeology. His Notitia Britanniae appeared in 1845, a year in which he examined the London strata to about 20 feet deep, in an excavation in Cheapside, comparing pre-Roman dwellings to some he had seen in Yorkshire.Notitia Britanniae; or, An enquiry concerning the localities, habits, condition, and progressive civilization of the aborigines of Britain: to which is appended a brief retrospect of the result of their intercourse with the Romans (London: J. Russell Smith, 1845).George Laurence Gomme, The Making of London (1912), p. 38; archive.org. He gave a paper at the Ethnological Society (15 March 1848) about the Roman fort on Wimbledon Common, in terms of a five-stage conjectural history of ancient Britons.Walter Tregellas, \\"Caesar's Camp, Wimbledon, p. 262 in The Archaeological Journal vol. 23 (1844); archive.org.

Overview The Renaissance architecture-styled structure was built in sections starting in 1920. As per customs at the time, madrassahs were named after the person who led the construction of the building. History has it that Abul Kasim, a noted personality in Tashkent, was behind the erection of the building. What made Abulkasym Madrassah, formerly the center against the Russian invasion, historically important, was the signing of a peace treaty that took place at the building. Tashkent was captured shortly after by Russian General Chernyaev. Following the October Revolution in 1919, the building was shut down. Later, the premises were used by a Tashkent toy factory. Over time, the building fell into disrepair. It was renovated only in the early 1980s, and inaugurated in 1987.

From 1958 till the end of 1964, when he left for a pastorate in Lakefield, Minnesota, Rev. Behling conducted weekly Sunday services. =Parish hall and church sanctuary= In December 1958, with the help of a church extension loan, the congregation acquired 2 hectares (5 acres) of land at the corner of Jacklin and Jenkins roads, across from Belmont Secondary School and the current Westshore Town Centre in Langford. Having hired an architectural firm for the design, the congregation held a ground-breaking ceremony on September 6, 1959, and construction began on a parish hall. The hall was sufficiently complete by December 24 of that same year that the congregation, now called Redeemer Lutheran Church, could hold a Christmas Eve service in the building. The completed parish hall was dedicated on March 15, 1960. By 1963, the parish hall was deemed to be no longer adequate. The congregation decided that, adjacent to the parish hall, they would need to build the church proper. Ground was broken on November 24, 1963, and the building was dedicated on May 10, 1964. With a declining congregation membership, the church met some of its needs for operating funds by gradually selling off portions of the original 2 hectares for residential building lots; by 2010, the church-owned property was reduced to 0.6 hectares (1.5 acres). =Church demolition and temporary location= Redeemer Lutheran has agreed to sell its remaining property at Jacklin and Jenkins roads to the Hayworth Living Group to construct a six- storey, 158-unit assisted living retirement home. That company has agreed to deed back a strata lot to an eventual two-storey church facility which they will build for the church within the envelope of the new $26-million building. On January 15, 2012, Redeemer Lutheran held a deconsecration service in the 1964 building, in the expectation that it would be demolished during the spring of that year. As of January 2013, however, demolition had not begun. During the anticipated 18-month construction period before the new building receives its occupancy permit, the church congregation was meeting on the fourth floor of the Alexander Mackie Lodge at 753 Station Avenue in Langford. The church has placed its altar in storage, but will reinstall it in the new building when construction is eventually completed.

Although CASA is mostly known for its rugby union team, the club hosts the practise of other sports and activities such as basketball, field hockey, swimming, pilates and yoga. The rugby union team currently plays in the Primera C, the 4th division of the Unión de Rugby de Buenos Aires league system, although CASA has focused on children and youth categories, where near 250 players are registered to the club. The institution was founded as a football club on December 12, 1926, under the name \\"Lancaster Club\\". The meeting was held in the San Antonio de Padua railway station. The team debuted vs Club Nacional de Merlo (today Club Independiente) being hardly defeated 7-0. In 1928, the club changed to its current name. Rugby was added as sport in 1981.  History in rugby  = Predecessors = Padua R.C. in 1958. That team was a predecessor of the rugby section of CASA, started in 1981 Rugby in the city of San Antonio de Padua started when a group of students of the Instituto San Antonio moved to Morón to continue their education. In the local institution, a priest related to club Los Matreros (the only team in the region) invited them to join and practise the sport. As the students' enthusiasm increased, four of them tried to play rugby near the S.A. de Padua Church, being taught by Roberto Schamun, senior player of Buenos Aires Cricket & Rugby Club and Hurling Club. They named the team \\"Padua Rugby Club\\". The recently formed club was introduced to the Argentine Rugby Union by the San Isidro Club (SIC). Nevertheless, Padua RC would be dissolved soon after. In 1974, two players of Porteño A.C. of General Rodríguez, formed a rugby team in Padua and then met former players of Padua R.C., forming the rugby team of \\"Ateneo S.A. de Padua\\", linked to the Franciscal Order. They registered with UAR as members, with Miguel A. Bruno and Eduardo Jar as coaches. The shirt was squared (like a draughts board) in red and green. Ateneo participated in UAR tournaments as guest team, in \\"preclasificación\\" division. = CASA rugby team = In 1981, the Ateneo RC dissolved due to internal problems. Some players went to Gimnasia y Esgrima de Ituzaingó (GEI) and others to Mariano Moreno. Most players and their coaches decided to join Club Atlético San Antonio de Padua. As part of the club, the rugby team adopted the institution's colors, black, gold and purple. The Municipality of Merlo gave CASA de Padua a vacant land on Antezana street, where the club built a rugby venue. That same year the club debuted playing in Preclasificación, the lowest division of the UAR (then took over by the URBA). One year after, the whole rugby team of GEI joined CASA. In 1983, they took part of UAR championships as guests, two years later the team promoted to the next division, while rugby at the club increased its categories to different age levels. In 1989, CASA de Padua promoted to Ascenso division and two years later promoted to the second division. The first international tour came in 1993, when CASA toured on Namibia and South Africa playing some friendly matches with those national teams. CASA reached the first division (Grupo I) in 1995 and went on a tour again, visiting United States and Bahamas to play there. The club would trip to South Africa two more times, in 2001 and 2009.Historia del Club SA de Padua In 2011, CASA was near to be relegated to Grupo III, but the team finally remained in second division after beating La Salle 21-17.\\"CASA de Padua derrotó a La Salle y sigue en el Grupo II\\", Rugbytime.com, 2011-10-01.

He was Chief Rabbi of Kraków, Poland after serving as Chief Rabbi of Mattersdorf. He was the second son of Rabbi Moshe Sofer (Chassam Sofer) of Pressburg. As president of the Orthodox Jewish party Machzikei HaDas, Sofer was a member of the Polenklub at the Reichsrat under the Austria- Hungary monarch Franz Joseph I. He was elected as Deputy of the Kolomyia's elektion district of Galicia. He became the foremost leader of the Orthodox Jews of Galicia in religious as well as in worldly matters. As a Halakhist and Talmudist he authored commentary and responsa in a work known today as Michtav Sofer. Early life Rabbi Shimon Sofer was born 13 Tevet 5581 (December 18, (1820) in the city of Pressburg, Kingdom of Hungary (now Bratislava, Slovakia), where his father, Rabbi Moses Schreiber (1762-1839), was serving as chief rabbi. His mother, Sarah-Sorele Schreiber (1790–1832), was the daughter of Rabbi Akiva Eger, the rabbi of Poznań, and the sister of Rabbi Abraham Moses Kalischer (1788–1812), the rabbi of Piła. She had ten other children beside him, and he lost her when he was eleven years old. He was named Shimon after his ancestor, the author of Yalkut Shimoni. Shimon was recognized as a child prodigy at a very early age. His father would seat him on his lap whilst delivering his weekly Chumash shiur at the Pressburg Yeshiva, where he expounded on Rashi and Ramban commentaries. At the age of 9, he was fluent in the works of the Shlah HaKadosh and the Baal HaAkeida. He displayed great interest in Jewish Poetry, a talent which is noticeable in his later Torah works. His favorite piyyut was Ya Ribon of Rabbi Israel ben Moses Najara, a Shabbat song which his father would not sing. His father would affectionately call him Shimon Chassida (the pious), and at the age of 13, at his Bar Mitzva, ordained him with the Ashkenazi title “Chaver”. Shimon matured quickly and at the age of 17 he married Miriam Sternberg, a daughter of philanthropist Rabbi Dov Ber Sternberg (Reb Ber Sighet) of Carei (also known as Nagykároly). After his marriage, he moved back to Pressburg, and upon instruction from his father, started learning Kaballa with Pressburg Dayan Rabbi Natan Binyamin Lieber (1805–1880) (Yiddish: נטע וואלף סג\\"ל) author of Sheeris Natan Binyamin. Shimon was a mere 19 years old when his father died. His brother Avraham Shmuel Binyamin, 6 years his elder, was appointed as Chief Rabbi of Pressburg. Avraham Shmuel Binyamin and Shimon continued to edit and publish their father's Torah commentary and Halakhic rulings, a project placed upon them by their father during his lifetime. During this time they completed the first volume of Chassam Sofer Responsa on Yoreh De'ah (שו\\"ת חת\\"ס חיו\\"ד). Rabbinical Positions Circa 1841 (5602), he moved to Nagykaroly, to be with his father-in-law. Circa 1843 (5603) he became rabbi of Mattersdorf, a position his father filled some 40 years earlier. There he founded a yeshiva and became involved in communal and national matters. He remained steadfast in his father's way of refusing to accept any reform or change to traditional orthodox Judaism. Circa 1849 (5610) he was offered a Chief Rabbinical position in Yarmat, which for an unknown reason, he turned down. Circa 1851 (5612), the Jewish community in Nikolsberg invited Sofer to accept the Chief Rabbinical position of their city. Rabbi Shimon again turned down this offer reasoning that he could not possibly stand in the position of previous \\"Torah giants\\" (such as the Mahara”l, Tosfos Yom Tov, Rabbi Shmuel Shmelke Horowitz and Rabbi Mordechai Benet who had served there as Chief Rabbi). Circa 1855 (5616), the Jewish Community of Pápa offered him to serve as Chief Rabbi of their city, an offer he refused. He reasoned that this community had removed their bima from the center of their Synagogue and moved the Chazzan's position to the face the congregation from a high stage. This, in his opinion was an unacceptable change to tradition and against halakha. Although the community promised to relocate the bima and amud in accordance to tradition, Rabbi Shimon still refused. In a letter written to his brother-in-law and sister Rabbi Shlomo & Gitel Spitzer, he explained that he and his wife planned on moving to Jerusalem in the Land of Israel and a five-year contract with this community would restrict him on this plan. Circa 1857 (5618), the Jewish Community of Krakow offered Sofer the position of Chief Rabbi, an offer that Sofer took seriously but deliberated for some time. Circa 1859 (5620) Rabbi Sofer accepted this position and moved to Krakow. Amongst those who convinced him to accept this post was Rabbi Chaim Halberstam, Rebbe of Sanz. His position of Chief Rabbi of Mattersdorf was filled by his nephew Rabbi Shmuel Ehrenfeld (1835–1883) author of Chassan Sofer. In Krakow Krakow was the home to a thriving Orthodox Jewish Community. Jewish presence there has been recorded as early as the 12th century. Since the 16th century many \\"Torah giants\\" served there as Chief Rabbi, such as the Rem”a, Ba”ch, Tosfos Yom Tov and the Maginei Shlomo. During Rabbi Sofer's rabbinate, Jews in Krakow numbered between 15,000-20,000 adults over the age of 15. In one of his letters written in 1879, Sofer states that there were over 80 minyanim in Krakow alone. At this time, the Haskalah movement had made an impression on the general Jewish Population of the Austria-Hungarian empire with many Jews assimilating or rejecting the traditional orthodox approach to Judaism. The Jews enjoyed freedom and rights under the rule of the Emperor Franz Joseph I who sympathized with them. Franz Joseph had even made a visit to Jerusalem in 1869 where he was welcomed warmly by the Orthodox Jewish community and leaders. He had donated the dome on the Tiferes Yisrael Synagogue in Jerusalem. The Hasidim and the Austrian-Hungarian rabbis of the Sofer Dynasty made a joint effort to strengthen traditional Orthodox Judaism and opposed the Reform both socially and politically. A major challenge for the traditional Orthodox Jews was opposing the Shomer Israel Society, a strong and influential reform group. Shomer Israel supported assimilation of Jews with the general population and sought legislation forcing Yeshiva’s to study philosophy and secular studies, something which the Orthodox staunchly opposed. In 1880, Rabbi Shimon Sofer founded a Hebrew-Yiddish weekly newspaper named מחזיקי הדת (Machzikei Hadas or Maḥaziḳe ha-Dat; Zeitung fur das Wahre Orthodoxische Judentum), published in Lemberg, to counter the Izraelit tabloid issued by Shomer Israel. In 1878 (5638), Rabbi Sofer and the Rebbe of Belz, Rabbi Yehoshua Rokeach, founded a political party naming it Machzikei Hadas. This party was supported by all the traditional orthodox communities of Galicia. Galician Jewry numbered some 800,000 persons at this time. The organization received recognition from the Austrian Kultusministerium (Ministry of Culture). It could be considered the first attempt of the Orthodox Jews in Europe to unite for political action in order to foster its beliefs in the sphere of Jewish social life. In 1878, Machzikei Hadas aligned itself with the Polish Club Polenklub and presented Rabbi Sofer as its candidate for the electorate of the Galician districts of Kolomyia, Sniatyn and Buchach which had large Jewish electorates. In 1879, Jewish Encyclopedia bibliography: S. Schreiber, Ḥut ha-Meshullash, p. 66b; Friedberg, . Sofer was elected and earned a seat at the Reichsrat (Austrian Parliament). Though Sofer was a talented orator and pretty fluent in the German language, the official language at the Reichsrat was Polish. It has been recorded that probably due to this Sofer did not speak at any assembly rather used his political influence off stage. Joseph Margoshes (1866–1955), a writer for the New York Yiddish daily Morgen Journal, describes Sofer in his memoir A World Apart: Although presiding over the Machzikei Hadas brought Sofer and the Orthodox Community honor and satisfaction, he endured much disrespect and personal insults from the Shomer Israel Society and newspapers such as the Izraelit and HaIvri whose editorials carried personal insults to him and his colleagues. Rabbi Sofer and Franz Joseph I thumb200pxFranz Joseph I Emperor of Austria; Apostolic King of Hungary; King of Bohemia; King of Croatia; King of Galicia and Lodomeria; Grand Duke of Cracow In 1880 (כ\\"ה אלול תר\\"ם), The Emperor of the Austria-Hungarian Empire Franz Joseph I made a 3-day visit to Krakow. Amongst the general population who greeted the Emperor at the train station, was the Orthodox Jewish community headed by Rabbi Shimon Sofer and his son-in-law, Rabbi Akiva Kornitzer. In a letter written the next morning (יום ה' ה' דסליחות תר\\"ם) to his son and daughter-in-law, Rabbi Shlomo and Hinda Sofer, he writes with great awe of his encounter with the emperor: The Jewish delegation awaited the emperor in a line under chuppa canopies with the leaders holding Torah scrolls adored with gold and silver accessories. His Excellency Franz Joseph sat in a carriage together with Prince Albrecht. Upon passing the Jewish delegation, he acknowledged the Torah scrolls by rising and bowing down at their sight. The Emperor continued to his lodging prepared by Potocki (probably; Alfred Józef Potocki). Rabbi Sofer and twelve delegates of the Jewish community formally welcomed the Emperor at the lodging. Rabbi Sofer requested the emperor's permission to don his hat in order to bless the Emperor, which was granted cordially. Rabbi Sofer made the traditional blessing (שנתן מכבודו) to which the Emperor answered \\"Amen\\". Sofer described the welcoming as \\"splendid\\", writing that he was invited to the \\"ball\\" that evening but was not planning on attending. The Machzikei HaDas newspaper of 19 September 1880 carried a front page report heralding the Emperor's visit to Krakow and Lvov, comparing him to an “Angel sent by God”. Articles bestowed Franz Joseph with titles such as “our father, our king, the almighty, righteous and merciful”. The report describes the joy and happiness of the Jewish community and the respect they and Rabbi Sofer received from the Emperor, an unprecedented event in Diaspora Jewish history. On 10 May 1881, Rabbi Sofer sent a parchment scroll to the Emperor Franz Joseph on the occasion of the wedding of his son Rudolf. The scroll, containing blessings and good wishes, was decorated with pure gold. It was written on behalf of the Orthodox Jewish community in Galicia and signed by Rabbi Sofer (signed; Simon Schreiber). It was received with gratitude.Igrot Michtav Sofer 2006 One line of the Lamentation Eulogy which was authored after Rabbi Shimon's death by his son Rabbi Yisrael David Simcha (Bunim) Sofer and printed in Machzikei Hadas newspaper reads: שמח מלכו עמו ובאות נתכבד (Happy was the King with him, and with an award was dignified). In a footnote he explains this passage: Death of his brother Avraham Shmuel Binyamin Rabbi Shimon was not informed of the death of his brother Avraham Shmuel Binyamin on December 31, 1871 and did not take part in his burial. Rabbi Azriel Hildesheimer, who took part and recorded a memoir of the burial, mentions that the Krakow community withheld three telegrams sent by the Pressburg community and family from reaching him. Hildersheimer writes that the Krakow community feared that the Pressburg community would appoint him as their Chief Rabbi. In a condolence letter written to his brother's family two weeks after the passing, Rabbi Shimon apologizes for not responding to the telegrams sent. He wrote that his family and community withheld the news from him and that the death of his brother came to his knowledge by chance. He discovered the news upon seeing his son- in-law reading the laws of Avelut. Death of Rabbi Shimon On Purim 1883 (5643), Rabbi Sofer celebrated with his congregation as usual, festivities continued into the late hours of the night. On the eve of 17 Adar II, 1883 (5643), he started to feel unwell. The next morning doctors examined him and prescribed medicine. He prayed with Tallit and Tefillin until 10:00am. Therefater he sent for his son-in-law, Rabbi Akiva Kornitzer, and said to him, These were his last words before he died. His son-in-law, Rabbi Akiva Kornitzer succeeded him as Chief Rabbi of Krakow.

The Materials Adherence Experiment (MAE) was a material science experiment conducted between July 4, 1997 and August 12, 1997 during NASA's Mars Pathfinder mission. This was a joint experiment between NASA and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology that consisted of a small module mounted to Pathfinder's rover Sojourner that examined the effects of Martian surface dust on solar cells. Purpose Using solar power on the Martian surface is challenging because the Martian atmosphere has a significant amount of dust suspended in it. In addition to blocking sunlight from reaching Mars's surface, dust particles gradually settle out of the air and onto objects. As Pathfinder was NASA's first Mars surface mission to be solar-powered, the effect of Martian dust settling on solar cells was not well understood before the mission. It was predicted at the time that dust particles in the Martian atmosphere would settle on the solar cells powering Pathfinder, blocking sunlight from striking them and slowly causing Pathfinder to lose power. Since knowing how the settling of dust out of Mars's atmosphere would affect solar cell performance would be critical to subsequent solar-powered missions on Mars, the MAE was included aboard the Sojourner rover to measure the degradation in performance of a solar cell as dust settled. Design The MAE, which was located on the front left corner of the solar array, consisted of a small gallium-arsenide solar cell mounted underneath a removable glass cover plate. As the mission progressed, atmospheric dust would settle on the glass cover plate, blocking increasingly more sunlight from striking the solar cell, causing it to produce less power. Throughout the mission, the glass cover plate was occasionally rotated away from the solar cell, removing the light-blocking effects of the dust. Sensors measuring the difference in power output of the solar cell before and after the cover plate was removed indicated how quickly the solar cell was losing its ability to produce power, and by extension, how quickly dust was collecting on the cover plate. The rotating actuator used to move the glass cover plate away from the solar cell marked the first use of a multi- cycle shape memory alloy in a space application. Sideview of the Sojourner Rover Due to the high level of UV radiation on the surface of Mars, it was important that the glass that covered the solar cell would not darken. For this purpose Suprasil was chosen. Results The MAE recorded a 2% obscuration due to dust on its first day of operation, probably caused by dust kicked up locally by Pathfinder's airbag being retracted. Measurements taken by the MAE at local noon for the first 24 days of Pathfinder's operation on Mars showed that atmospheric dust obscured the test solar cell at a rate of 0.28% per day. This degradation rate was about the same regardless of whether Sojourner was moving or stationary. Measurements taken at local 2pm showed a slightly higher obscuration rate over the first 20 days of the mission, at 0.33% per day. These findings were consistent with the decline in power output of the solar cells on Sojourner and the Pathfinder lander, which indicated a dust accumulation rate of 0.29% per day, and fairly close to the value predicted before Pathfinder landed (0.22% per day).

He served as deputy leader to the group's founder, Mohammed Yusuf, until Yusuf was executed in 2009. Some even think Sheikawi isn't a real citizen of Nigeria, but of Chad Republic. Nigerian authorities believed that Shekau was killed in 2009 during clashes between security forces and Boko Haram until July 2010, when Shekau appeared in a video claiming leadership of the group. He has subsequently been regularly reported dead and is thought to use body doubles. In March 2015, Shekau pledged allegiance to ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Shekau is a Salafi. He has been described as possessing a photographic memory. Biography =Early years= Shekau was born in Shekau town, in Tarmuwa local government, Yobe state; his exact date of birth is unknown but is said to be between 1965 and 1975. Shekau is an ethnic Kanuri, and also speaks Hausa, Fulani, Arabic, and English.BBC: \\"Nigeria's Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau in profile\\" 9 May 2014 In 1990 he moved to the Mafoni area in Maiduguri and studied under a traditional cleric before entering the Borno College of Legal and Islamic Studies (now called Mohammed Goni College of Legal and Islamic Studies). Shekau left the college for ideological reasons and without earning a degree.https://d2071andvip0wj.cloudfront.net/curbing-violence-in- nigeria-II-the-boko-haram-insurgency.pdf He later met Mohammed Yusuf, the founder of Jamaat Ahlus Sunnah li Dawah wal Jihad, and became one of his deputies. Shekau was appointed the leader of the group in July 2009, after the death of Yusuf in the 2009 Boko Haram uprising. Shekau survived being shot in the leg during the 2009 attempt on his life by Nigerian security forces. He is married to one of Muhammad Yusuf's four widows. His nickname is “Darul Tawheed”, which translates as \\"specialist in tawheed\\", the Islamic concept of oneness of Allah. =Leader of 'Boko Haram'= Shekau's leadership has not gone unchallenged. He received a letter from al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb giving him advice but he did not heed it. As a result of his erratic leadership, in 2012 a faction of the group broke off to form Jamaat Ansar al- Muslimin fi Bilād as-Sudan (Ansaru). This faction included his military commander Abu Muhammad al-Bauchawi, and religious advisor Sheikh Abu Osama al- Ansari Muhammad Awal al-Gombawi. Despite this, many soldiers and commanders stayed with Shekau, including military commanders Abu Sa'ad al-Bamawi and Muhammad Salafi. With his group mostly intact, Shekau engaged in conflict with Ansaru, killing their leader Abu Osama al-Ansari. As a result of this, and other arrests of Ansaru leaders by the Nigerian government, Ansaru did not pose a further threat to Shekau's leadership of the jihadi movement in Nigeria, and the group became defunct by 2015. Shekau's fellow jihadist fighters were undisciplined and abused the populations they encountered, resulting in the establishment of civilian militias such as the Civilian Joint Task Force to fight them. Shekau is also thought to have killed his own religious advisors, including Sheikh Abd al-Malek al-Ansari al-Kadunawi and Abu al-Abbas al-Bankiwani.http://www.aymennjawad.org/21467/the-islamic-state- west-africa-province-vs-abu In June 2012, the United States Department of State designated Shekau as a terrorist and effectively froze his assets in the United States. Since June 2013, the Department has had a standing reward of US$7 million for information leading to Shekau's capture through its Rewards for Justice program. In addition, the Nigerian army has offered a ₦50 million reward (approximately US$300,000) for Shekau. In videos Shekau posted online, he boasted often about his invincibility; mocked various armies; and stated that he \\"cannot be stopped\\" and \\"cannot die except by the will of Allah\\". He has also boasted of being in possession of armoured tanks and other combat vehicles. His online videos frequently depict anti-American rhetoric, and he has made multiple threats to attack the U.S. In one prominent incident, he took credit for the kidnapping of over 200 school girls in April 2014. Shekau also announced that the kidnapped girls have been converted to Islam.Boko Haram and the Future of Nigeria, by Dr. Jacques Neheriah Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs He has claimed to be waging a jihad against Christianity. With the rise of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria during 2014 and 2015, Shekau faced pressure from his commanders and soldiers to pledge his allegiance to IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. A history of the group says that Shekau \\"was compelled to give allegiance, and that was through a coming together of the military commanders, and after he became convinced that the matter was about to go out of his hand, and that his throne would be shaken and emptied of him if he did not give allegiance\\". In August 2016, ISIL appointed Abu Musab al- Barnawi as the leader of the group in place of Shekau. Shekau refused to recognise Barnawi's authority and split off part of the group under its original name of Jamaat Ahlus Sunnah li Dawah wal Jihad, while Barnawi lead the Islamic State's West African province. While Shekau continues to lead his group, he has only 1,500 soldiers, whereas Barnawi has 3,500. Shekau has been widely denounced as following the ideology of the Khawarij by the Islamic State and West Africa province in Nigeria. Following the split, many clashes occurred between Shekau and Barnawi's soldiers throughout the month of August and the following months. On 12 September 2016, 30 of Shekau's soldiers were killed and 40 captured by IS-West Africa. In October 2016, Shekau's soldiers attacked the Karino area south of Lake Chad with 350 men seizing the village of Tunubuma. Then Barnawi's soldiers counter-attacked, killing more than 75, including the leader Muhammad Bakr. Reports of death Shekau was reported killed in 2009 but reappeared as the group leader less than a year later. The Nigerian army in mid-August 2013 stated that he was fatally wounded when soldiers raided a base of Boko Haram in Sambisa forest and had died between 25 July and 3 August. However, a video in September 2013 was released in which a man purported to be Shekau claimed he had not been killed. The Nigerian army also stated to have killed him during the 2014 Battle of Kodunga that lasted from September 12 to 14th. The Cameroonian military posted a photo and also claimed that their forces killed Shekau in September 2014. In response to these reports, security analyst Ryan Cummings commented, \\"Is this his fourth or fifth death? He dies more often than an iPhone battery.\\" In early October 2014, a video was obtained by AFP news agency that showed Shekau alive, in which he mocked the Nigerian military's allegations that he had been killed. Chadian President, Idriss Déby claimed in mid-August 2015 that Shekau had been replaced by Mahamat Daoud without exactly specifying his fate. An audio message attributed to Shekau was released a few days later, in which he purportedly stated that he had neither been killed nor ousted as chief of the group. Shekau was reported to have been \\"fatally wounded\\" during an airstrike in Taye village on 19 August 2016 by Nigerian Air Force which also killed some senior leaders of Boko Haram. On 25 September, a video of a man purported to be Shekau was released on YouTube, in which he claimed that he was alive and in good health. On 27 June 2017, Shekau released a video in which he claimed responsibility for the abduction of Nigerian policewomen and criticized the Nigerian government for claiming that Boko Haram had been defeated. This video would seem to be further evidence of Shekau's continued survival. In February 2020, Shekau released a video threatening the minister of information and digital economy, Isa Ali Pantami, and making reference to what was done to islamic scholar Ja'afar Mahmud Adam in Maiduguri when he preached against Boko Haram.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Windermere, the archdeaconry of Westmorland and Furness, and the diocese of Carlisle. Its benefice is united with those of St Mary, Allithwaite, St Mary and St Michael, Cartmel, St Peter, Field Broughton, St Paul, Grange-over-Sands, Grange Fell Church, Grange-Over-Sands, St Paul, Lindale, St Mary Staveley-in-Cartmel, St Anne Haverthwaite and St Peter Finsthwaite to form the benefice of Cartmel Peninsula. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. History St John's was designed by the Lancaster architects Austin and Paley, and paid for by Victor Cavendish. It replaces an older church built in 1777 on a site nearby. The foundation stone was laid in 1897 by Lady Evelyn Cavendish, and the church was consecrated in 1900. Its original estimated cost was £8,000, but it finally cost £12,000 (). Architecture =Exterior= The church is constructed in pale sandstone, dressed to be almost smooth, with ashlar dressings and bands. It is roofed in sandstone flags, other than the apse, which has a lead roof. The architectural style is Romanesque. Its plan consists of a four-bay nave with a clerestory, north and south three-bay aisles, a west tower, a south porch, and a chancel with a chapel to the north, an organ chamber to the south, and a semicircular apse to the east with a vestry beneath. The church stands on a sloping site, with the tower at the top, and the rest of the church stepped down the slope. The tower is in three stages, with buttresses, a corbelled coped parapet, and a saddleback roof with gables on the east and west sides. On the west side of the tower are paired lancet windows in the bottom stage, a round-headed lancet window with zigzag moulding in the middle stage, and paired louvred bell openings in the top stage. On the south side of the tower is a porch with two open quatrefoils in its gable. Above this is a lancet window and a single bell opening. The north side has a gabled stair turret, a lancet window, and a single bell opening. On the east side is a pair of bell openings. There are clock faces on all sides. The windows in the body of the church are round- headed lancets, single or in pairs. Each bay of the clerestory contains a two- light window. =Interior= The three-bay arcade is carried on quatrefoil piers. All the furnishings were designed by the architects, and are \\"very good in a quiet way\\". Also in the nave are creed and commandment boards dating from the 18th century, and the royal arms of George III. In the chancel is a trefoil-headed sedilia. All the stained glass is by Shrigley and Hunt, dating from about 1901 to 1927, the newest window depicting Saint Cuthbert preaching. The organ has two manuals; its builder is not known. There is a ring of eight bells, all cast by John Taylor & Co; four date from 1900, two from 1949, and two from 2008.

Gospel for Asia Gospel for Asia is one of the largest missionary organizations in the world, adhering to K.P. Yohannan's belief in the efficiency and efficacy of “national missionaries”, or missionaries that are native to the nation or culture being served. The organization’s primary mission fields are those people that live in the “10/40 Window”, referring to longitudinal coordinates consisting of areas in west Africa, India and east Asia. 255x255px K. P. Yohannan credits his early work in his native India as inspiration for his focus on the poor and underserved in this region. He states: “In my head I knew all the answers, and Bible became the tool of the trade for me that I would use to teach and preach and I was doing very well. People liked my sermons, but finally I said to myself, ‘I’m not the same person I was when the Lord called me to serve Him. I’m not the same person that I was that walked on the streets of North India weeping over the lost and perishing millions and stayed up all night praying and weeping over a world map. The Lord was gracious enough to talk to us very lovingly, and I realized that he wanted me to go back to America and speak to the ‘Body of Christ’ about the possibility of seeing countries like India, Burma and Bhutan, turn to Christ if only they would become unselfish in praying and helping these brothers by becoming senders.” From its inception, Gospel for Asia has held to K.P. Yohannan's conviction of the use of national missionaries. The ministry discourages direct missions from outside countries or people-groups, but rather trains and equips missionaries from within distinct cultures. In order to accomplish this, Gospel for Asia claims to have over 56 Bible schools in 10 countries, training over 9000 ministers. In all, Gospel for Asia claims to have trained over 16,000 national missionaries.Houston, Rickey. “Loving Your Neighbor: A Guide to Developing and Sustaining Community Service Projects.” Liberty University Baptist Theological Seminary Doctor of Ministry Thesis, March 2013.

Controversies =Court rulings in India= The operations of Gospel for Asia and Believers Church were scrutinized after Believers Church purchased a rubber estate in Kerala, India. Opponents claimed the church had diverted foreign funds to amass land for itself and for uses other than declared purposes. Further, it was alleged that the rubber estate, which Believers Church purchased from Harrison's Malayalam Ltd., was on leasehold from the government and not saleable. Hence, Believers Church was accused of illegally holding government land. At a later time, Harrison's Malayalam was accused of forging their land title, leading to continued debate about the legality of the sale. Former Ernakulam District Collector Dr M G Rajamanickam, who was appointed as the Special Officer of the government to confiscate the illegal and excess estate lands under the custody of various companies, had issued an order in May, 2015, confiscating the 2,268 acre of land from Believers’ Church.\\" However, this ruling was appealed and now there is further complication because the local government wants to build an airport on this estate. News outlets are reporting that the local government wants to buy the property. However, it is also reported that \\"The government does not need permission from K P Yohannan to set up airport in the Cheruvally estate, BJP national executive member V Muraleedharan said.\\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/Yohannan-has- no-stake-in-Cheruvally-estate/articleshow/55842542.cms K. P. Yohannan says that the claims were politically motivated and that the workings of Gospel for Asia and Believers Church are transparent. Further, the rubber estate is an investment to help fund social services among underdeveloped communities and not a personal land grab as opponents have claimed. The controversies regarding the purchase of estate have been cleared by the Kerala High Court. The findings pointed out by Dr. M G Rajamanickam in his report have been completely rejected by the court. The court came down heavily on the government and the officer for playing \\"robin hood\\" with the owners of the estate. A long standing controversy for Believers Church comes to an end with a clean verdict from the high court of Kerala. =US Federal lawsuits= There were two RICO anti-fraud lawsuits active against Gospel for Asia, naming K. P. Yohannan as one of the defendants among other Gospel for Asia leaders. One of these lawsuits went to arbitration and the other reached a settlement after three years in which both parties agreed “all donations designated for use in the field were ultimately sent to the field.” Gospel for Asia denies any wrongdoing.

Its purpose was to extend the existing tramway through the towns of the Potteries. It acquired the North Staffordshire Tramways Company Limited and arranged to take over the Longton Corporation Tramways. Construction was awarded to Dick, Kerr & Co. and the overhead work was awarded to R. W Blackwell and Company.

The program allows Manitoba to nominate qualified applicants for Canadian permanent resident status. The program is primarily divided into 3 streams with each stream subdivided into categories for different types of candidates: the Skilled Worker Stream, the International Education Stream, and the Business Investor Stream. The program accounts for more than three-quarters of all new immigrants arriving in Manitoba, and is seen as the main driver for the increased population growth.Nominee program, births keep Manitoba's growth rate high The program has enabled a resurrection of immigration from Ukraine to Manitoba, which had almost stopped in the early 1990s. An estimated 250 people a year have emigrated from Ukraine in the last 12 years.Ukrainian community, scarred by Holodomor, helped shape Winnipeg's cultural mosaic  Qualification parameters  The program is primarily divided into 3 streams with each stream subdivided into categories for different types of candidates: #Skilled Worker Stream #* Skilled Workers in Manitoba #* Skilled Workers Overseas #International Education Stream #* Career Employment Pathway #* Graduate Internship Pathway #* International Student Entrepreneur Pilot #Business Investor Stream #* Entrepreneur Pathway #* Farm Investor Pathway Each of the categories of the program has its own set of eligibility criteria: # Skilled Workers in Manitoba: Targets foreign nationals who have work experience in Manitoba or a job offer from a Manitoba employer, and who demonstrate they have the necessary qualifications to succeed in Manitoba's workforce. # Skilled Workers Overseas: Targets foreign nationals who have work experience in one of Manitoba's in-demand occupations and can demonstrate that they have the work experience needed to succeed in the Manitoba's workforce. # International Education Stream: Targets foreign nationals who have recently completed higher education at an institution in Manitoba. # Business Investor Stream: Targets foreign nationals with entrepreneurial experience who wish to undertake an entrepreneurial investment in Manitoba. In addition, there are federal standards for immigration that can make a person inadmissible for reasons such as posing a security threat, having a history of criminal behaviour, or having a medical condition that poses a threat to public safety.  Procedure  Application procedure for the Manitoba Provincial Nominee Program varies depending on the stream and program to which a person is applying. Generally, all streams follow a three-step application process: Step One - Expression of Interest: Interested candidates must express interest in applying to their program of choice. This varies from program to program. Certain programs allow candidates to submit an Expression of Interest (EOI) online, while other programs require candidates to attend an information session or conduct an exploratory visit before submitting their EOI. Step Two - Provincial Application: If an EOI is approved, the candidate receives a Letter of Advice to Apply (LAA) from the province. This LAA authorizes the candidate to submit an official application to Manitoba for provincial nomination. Step Three - Federal Application: All Canadian permanent residency applications must be approved by the federal government, so after receiving a provincial nomination, an applicant must submit another application at the federal level for permanent residency. If an applicant's federal application is approved, they are granted Canadian permanent resident status for themselves and any accompanying family members included on their application. = Expression of Interest (EOI) Draws = Manitoba regularly conducts Expression of Interest draws to issue Letter of Advice to Apply to eligible candidates.

Launched by GMG Radio as a sister station to Smooth Radio, it first aired on 27 December 2011, replacing a temporary station GMG had launched for the Christmas period. The station was broadcast through DAB on the Digital One multiplex and was also available online, where it could be accessed using Radioplayer. The station operated largely on an automated basis, but there was also some presenter input. Although Smooth 70s was not the first UK radio station to be dedicated solely to music from the decade, it was the first to be broadcast nationally. Audience data released by Radio Joint Audience Research Limited (RAJAR) in October 2012 indicated 749,000 listeners were tuning into the station on a regular basis. Global Radio–which bought GMG in June 2012–announced on 3 October 2013 that Smooth 70s would cease broadcasting from the early hours of 6 October. History The concept of a decade-themed radio station was first introduced by Absolute Radio, and in June 2011 GMG Radio decided to launch several stations through the online music streaming service we7 which would play particular types of music associated with the output of its stations. Three stations were launched under the Smooth Radio brand; Smooth 60s, Smooth 70s and Smooth Soul. On 1 November 2011, GMG Radio launched a dedicated station playing nothing but Christmas music, under the brand \\"Smooth Christmas\\". The station, on the Digital One multiplex, had no news or advertisements but did promote Smooth Radio and broadcast until 27 December 2011. Smooth Christmas was subsequently replaced on a trial basis by Smooth 70s, playing tracks from the 1970s. The station was received positively by listeners, and in January 2012 GMG Radio confirmed a deal with US syndication firm Premiere Networks to air 1970s editions of the original American Top 40 show presented by Casey Kasem at weekends. Other early features included Disco Lunch and Late Night Love Songs, which continued to be among its weekday programming. Smooth 70s was the first 1970s-themed radio station to air nationally in the United Kingdom, and as of August 2012 was still the only such station broadcasting nationally, but it was not the first dedicated to music from the decade. Absolute Radio had launched a similar station, Absolute Radio 70s, on 29 November 2011, but this was only available on DAB in London. However, Absolute 70s styled itself as the UK's only 1970s-themed radio station. From its launch, Smooth 70s predominantly operated on an automated basis, playing back-to-back music tracks, although some live programming was later added. Smooth 70s began with no news bulletins, but these were added in June 2012, together with travel updates, after feedback from listeners indicated a demand for these. Other features added to the line- up included Smooth Radio 70s at 7 with David Jensen, 2 TV Themes at 2 O'Clock and Weekend Themes. In August 2012 the station compiled a Top 70 of the 70s chart after inviting its listeners to vote for their favourite hit from the decade. The chart, presented on Bank Holiday Monday, 27 August, by several presenters from the main Smooth Radio station, featured ABBA's Dancing Queen as its number one. In September 2012 the radio industry news website Radio Today reported that Simon Bates – host of Simon Bates at Breakfast on Smooth Radio – had started to present a separate breakfast show for Smooth 70s. Smooth Radio did not publicise the show, but confirmed Bates was providing \\"a little content\\" when asked about the programme. The content was \\"voice tracked\\" from his main breakfast show. The station recorded its first official listening figures in October 2012, when Radio Joint Audience Research Limited (RAJAR) published the official audience figures for the third quarter of 2012. The statistics showed that 749,000 listeners were tuning into Smooth 70s on a regular basis. The final listening figures gathered for the station before it closed, and released in February 2014, showed a weekly audience of 804,000. Smooth Christmas returned to the Digital One multiplex as a stablemate of Smooth Radio and Smooth 70s in the lead up to Christmas 2012. Smooth 70s celebrated the 40th anniversary of the release of Pink Floyd's 1973 album The Dark Side of the Moon by playing it in full on the evening of 22 March 2013. GMG Radio was bought by Global Radio in June 2012. On 3 October 2013, Global announced that Smooth 70s would close. The announcement came within a week of Smooth's operations being relocated from Manchester to Global's headquarters in Leicester Square, London. Smooth 70s ceased broadcasting in the early hours of Sunday 6 October. Its place on national DAB was taken by Capital Xtra. In August 2019, nearly six years after the closure of Smooth 70s, Global resumed transmission of a 1970s music station over Digital One, with the launch of Heart 70s as a broadcast radio service (it had been operating as an online stream through Global Player since 2017.)

He built the Fortune Playhouse, and probably the Globe Theatre, two significant establishments in the history of the stage in London. He had a part in building King James's Banqueting House in Whitehall Palace and he may have been responsible for the settings for the king's royal masques. Early life Street was the fourth of eight children of John Street, a joiner of St Stephen Coleman Street parish in the City of London, and his wife Margaret Bullasse, who married in 1546.W. Ingram, The Business of Playing: The Beginnings of the Adult Professional Theater in Elizabethan London (Cornell University Press, Ithaca and London 1992), p. 96 (Google). St Stephen Coleman Street Compound Register 1538-1598 (London Metropolitan Archives, ref. P69/STE1/A/001/MS04448), fol. 12 r. and fol. 24 r. He was ten when his father died in 1563St Stephen Coleman Street Compound Register 1538-1598, fol. 46 v. and was the only one of his brothers and sisters to survive into adulthood. At the age of sixteen, on Lady Day in 1570 (25 March 1570), Street was indentured for an eight-year term of apprenticeship to carpenter William Brittaine. After a year, Street's talent was noticed by Robert Maskall, an important figure in the carpenters' guild, the Worshipful Company of Carpenters, and Maskall bought Brittaine's contract for the remainder of Street's apprenticeship. Maskall introduced Street as a freeman (full member) of the guild on completion of his indentured term in March 1577. No record of Street's marriage has been found, but this is assumed to have taken place in 1581. Street's mother had remarried in 1569 and in 1581 his stepfather William Marrytt, a prosperous brewer, made a gift of a house and shop to his stepson. It is probable that this was to mark Street's wedding, to one Elizabeth. Their first child, John, was born in March 1584. In due course, in August 1608, John in his turn completed his apprenticeship, becoming a freeman of the Carpenters' guild. Preview at Google. Career In August 1581, Street bought the lease to the house of his old employer Robert Maskall, a \\"company house\\" belonging to the Carpenters' guild, an indication that his business had prospered and, indeed, that he was held in good standing within his profession. In due course he was able to pay for extra land: two gardens again leased from the guild. In August 1584, he was elected liveryman of the guild with the requirement, somewhat reluctantly accepted, to represent the Company on formal occasions, and in 1598 he became its Second Warden. He could have then expected to follow his former employer, Maskall, and become guild Master but in the years following 1599 he was censured for \\"taking his ease\\" and idly neglecting guild business, and he rose no further. (Professionally he was far from idle, with pressing construction projects, such as an over-running contract to build the Fortune Theatre, taking up his time.) In 1608 the Carpenters succeeded in having him imprisoned for absence from guild meetings, but a court of City Aldermen countermanded them and he was released on the same day. Theatres =The Theatre, Shoreditch= Street's first experience of theatre construction was possibly at The Theatre in Shoreditch, in 1576. James Burbage, the promoter, was a fellow-parishioner of the Street family at St Stephen's Church and the men were well known to each other. Although no record naming the man responsible for The Theatre's construction survives, Street was in the last year of his apprenticeship and could have been employed on the project. (James's brother, Robert Burbage, had completed his carpenter's apprenticeship three years earlier and presumably was also involved in the work.) =Blackfriars= In 1596, James Burbage acquired part of the old Blackfriars priory, where a company of child actors, The Children of the Chapel, was already established in another of the old buildings. As Burbage was commissioning alterations to his purchase, to add galleries and extra seating for his intended audience, Street acquired a house and waterfront woodyard near Bridewell, just over the River Fleet from Burbage's purchase and directly connected by a narrow bridge. (Details of the complicated leasing arrangements for Street's new property survive, as the head lessee died just after accepting a deposit for arranging the transaction and a court case was necessary to resolve the issue.) Although no documentary record specifying Street's involvement with the Blackfriars project has been found, it is assumed that he acquired the woodyard so that he could be close to the site of his new contract. A waterfront yard was necessary as Street stayed in Berkshire, near to where his timber was grown, to prefabricate the components for his timber-framed buildings in London, and then transported the pieces by barge down the Thames to where they were needed. Burbage discharged him before the friary project was completed, as influential local residents had petitioned to prevent the Burbages' plan. Much later, after Street had established himself as a builder of London's playhouses, he returned to Blackfriars to complete the conversion work he had started for the Burbages; as members of the King's Men, under the patronage of King James himself, the Burbages were now able to outface any local opposition and in 1608 they re- engaged Street to finish the work he had started. =The Globe= When the Blackfriars scheme was put aside, because of insurmountable opposition from some influential neighbours, it was Street to whom James's sons, Cuthbert the business manager and actor Richard, turned for a new solution. (James himself had died early in 1597.) The matter was pressing, because the Burbages were about to lose their existing playhouse, The Theatre, when their lease expired, an event that would probably mean the dissolution of their successful company, the Lord Chamberlain's Men. The eight sharers in the Chamberlain's Men, after securing a long lease on land in Southwark, on the other side of the Thames, arranged for Street to remove the oak timbers of The Theatre for re-use in their new premises; they were forced to reduce the costs of the venture as far as they could, following their thwarted expenditure at Blackfriars. On 28 December 1598, Street, with twelve of his men and \\"diverse other persons\\", started to dismantle the old Theatre. Street assured bystanders that he was only starting a refurbishment project, intending to rebuild the structure \\"in another form\\", but in due course the half-ton oak beams were on their way by wagon to Street's Bridewell yard.Shapiro (2005: 5) There they were stored until the pile and masonry foundations at Southwark, prepared under Street's direction by one William Shepherd to \\"force the building out of the marsh\\", as Ben Jonson put it, were complete.Shapiro (2005: 123–6) Three weeks after the raid Street found himself the chief defendant in a court case, brought by The Theatre's landlord Giles Allen, complaining of the \\"carrying away of…all the wood and timber thereof\\",Bowsher; Miller (2009: 90) but no determination was made, as claim and counterclaim between the Burbages and Allen occupied lawyers for years to come. As well as storing the reclaimed material from The Theatre, Street's preparations would have included prefabricating extra framing for his structure, near to where the timber was grown and seasoned, upriver in Berkshire—The Globe was going to be larger than the building it replaced., quoted in Bowsher and Miller (2009: 90) In a later building project, that of The Fortune theatre in the following year, Street fabricated and loosely fitted together the timber framing at Windsor and Maidenhead, and it is assumed that he followed this procedure for The Globe as well. Once the foundations were complete, erection took a further ten weeks, finishing in the Summer of 1599, leaving only the lath and plaster infill to complete.Shapiro (2005: 129) The cost was £700. The \\"Glory of the Bank\\", as Ben Jonson described the new theatre,An Execration upon Vulcan, Jonson's commemoration of the Globe's destruction by fire in 1613 was very near to The Rose, the playhouse of their rival company The Admiral's Men, and The Swan. =The Fortune= In January 1600 Philip Henslowe, the proprietor of The Rose theatre now so surpassed by its new neighbour The Globe, in turn commissioned Street to build a new theatre in competition at a site in Finsbury, north of the City, to be called The Fortune. The contract and accounts for the work survive and it is evident that Henslowe approved of Street's work on The Globe, as in many places the contract merely specified that in the new building Street should do as had been done at The Globe; the major difference was that The Fortune was to be a square building, as opposed to the polygonal Globe. While labourers and bricklayers prepared the foundations Street returned to Berkshire to select and prepare his timber—the contract specified, in a possible further allusion to The Globe's construction, that only new timber was to be used. By early May 1600 the foundations in London, and the carpentry in Berkshire, were nearly complete and the building was finished, a little later than Street had anticipated, in August 1600. Street was paid £400, less than he had received for the Globe, but Henslowe is on record as having travelled to Berkshire to pay directly for materials Street was working on there, and local wages. =The Hope= Richard Henslowe retained property in Southwark after opening The Fortune in Finsbury, and in June 1606 he contracted Street to demolish his Bear Garden, a bear-baiting arena, and re- build it as the Hope Theatre but Street died before the main part of the work started and the eventual rebuilding was carried out by Gilbert Katherens. Other work At one of the court cases to settle the 1596 Bridewell leasehold dispute, Street described himself as a member of the Queen's household, but the other party accused him of making this claim only to overawe his opponents and so divert attention from his \\"dishonest practices\\". An inconclusive Palace record of 1593 does show one \\"Peter Street\\" as living and working at court, but in what capacity is not recorded. There is, however, no doubt that later in his working life, as he rose to prominence, he did work for the royal household. He was on good terms with William Portington, the king's carpenter, and he certainly provided specialist knowledge and machinery when the first permanent Banqueting House, built in 1606 to provide a theatrical setting for royal occasions, was put up. Apart from offering the benefit of his experience in theatre design, Street's particular contribution was the wooden columns, hollowed out to prevent splitting and painted to resemble marble, in the style of those at The Globe. Mary Edmond speculates that Street's experience in theatre construction was also put to use in building the stage and seating for the royal masques at James's court. He was carpenter to the Bridewell Palace, but this was not a royal appointment as the former palace of King Henry was, at that time, in use as the Bridewell Hospital, an orphanage. After his death Street's son John was appointed to the post. In literature and other media The poet Seamus Heaney commemorated Street's work in his 1965 poem Peter Street at Bankside. Street's character – as played by Matt King – also appeared in the second episode of Series 3 of the new Doctor Who, entitled The Shakespeare Code, as first broadcast in April 2007.

The battle resulted in the defeat and death of the Chalukya king Pulakeshin II and the commencement of Pallava occupation of Vatapi which lasted until 654.  Causes  In about 617–18, Pulakeshin II invaded the Pallava kingdom defeating the king Mahendravarman I and proceeded as far south as the Cauvery River on the northern frontier of the Chola country.Dikshit, p 94 The Pallavas long wished to avenge the humiliation suffered at the hands of Pulakeshin II and over the next few years, strengthened their forces in preparation for a counter-attack. In 630, Mahendravarman I was succeeded by his son Narasimhavarman I under whom the Pallava kingdom emerged as a powerful state. This prompted Pulakeshin II to lead a second expedition into the Pallava country.Dikshit, p 96 According to K. A. Nilakanta Sastri, Pulakeshin II first defeated the Banas, who were feudatories of the Pallavas, before advancing into the Pallava country. Narasimhavarman I met the Chalukyas and defeated them in three separate encounters in Pariyala, Suramana and Manimangala, all close to the Pallava capital Kanchi, forcing them to retreat.Heras, p 35 The Pallavas, then, took the offensive and pursued the fleeing Chalukya forces deep into their territory.Dikshit, p 98-99  Events  In 642, a formidable Pallava force under Paranjothi was sent by Narasimhavarman I to capture Vatapi, the capital of the Chalukyas.Heras, p 38 Pulakeshin II met the Pallavas on the outskirts of his capital and is presumed to have lost his life in the ensuing battle. The Pallavas achieved a decisive victory over Pulakeshin II. The victorious Pallavas then took the capital and ruled it for 12 years (642-654).

It is pseudohomothallic and non-pathogenic to humans.\\"Podospora anserina: a model filamentous fungus\\" This species is coprophilous, colonising the dung of herbivorous animals.  Taxonomy  Podospora anserina was originally named Malinvernia anserina Rabenhorst (1857) and Podospora anserina was subsequently published in Niessl von Mayendorf, G. 1883: Ueber die Theilung der Gattung Sordaria. Hedwigia 22: 153–156, which is used today to reference the common laboratory strain therefrom, namely, 'Niessl'. It is also known as Pleurage anserina (Ces.) Kuntze.Memoirs of the Torrey Botanical Club (1902) Genetics of P. anserina were characterized in Rizet and Engelmann (1949) and reviewed by Esser (1974). P. anserina is estimated to have diverged from N. crassa 75 million years ago based on 18s rRNA and protein orthologous share 60-70% homology.The genome sequence of the model ascomycete fungus Podospora anserina NCBI Taxonomy ID: 5145, MycoBank # 100818 Gene cluster orthologs between Aspergillus nidulans and Podospora anserina have 63% identical primary amino acid sequence (even those these species are from distinct classes) and the average amino acid of compared proteomes is 10% less, giving rise to hypotheses of distinct species yet shared genes  Research  Podospora as a model organism to study genetics, aging (senescence, cell degeneration), ascomycete development, heterokaryon incompatibility (mating in fungi),The transcriptional response to nonself in the fungus Podospora anserina. prions, and mitochondrial and peroxisomal physiology.Gene deletion and allelic replacement in the Wlamentous fungus Podospora anserina Podospora is easily culturable (for example, on/in complex (full) potato dextrose or cornmeal agar/broth or even synthetic medium), and, using modern molecular tools, is easy to manipulate. Its optimal growth temperature is 25-27 °C. = Strains = Morphology varies depending on the specific strain. * ΔPaKu70 is used to increase homologous recombination in protoplasts during transformations in order to create desirable gene deletions or allelic mutations. A ΔPaKu70 strain can be achieved by transforming protoplasts with linear DNA that flanks the PaKu70 gene along with an antibiotic cassette and then selecting for strains and verifying by PCR. * Mn19 is a long-lived strain used to study senescence. It is derived from strain A+-84-11 after grown on manganese (Mn). This particular strain has been reported to have lived over 2 years in a race tube covering over 400 cm of vegetative growth.Genetic and molecular analysis of a long-lived strain of Podospora anserina. * ΔiΔviv is an immortal strain that shows no sign of senescence. It produces yellow pigmentation. Lack of viv increased life span in days by a factor of 2.3 compared to the wild type and lack of i by 1.6, however, strain ΔiΔviv showed no senescence during the whole study and was vegetative for over a year. These genes are synergistic and are physically closely linked.Genes Inhibiting Senescence in the Ascomycete Podospora anserina * AL2 is a long-lived strain. Insertion of linear mitochondrial plasmid containing al-2 show increased life span. However, natural isolates that have homology to al-2 do not show increased life span.The mitochondrial plasmid pAL2-1 reduces calorie restriction mediated life span extension in the filamentous fungus Podospora anserina 2004 * Δgrisea is a long-lived strain and copper uptake mutant. This strain has lower affinity to copper and thus lower intracellular copper levels, leading to use of the cyanide-resistant alternative oxidase, PaAOX, pathway (instead of copper-dependent mitochondrial COX complex). This strain also exhibits more stable mtDNA. Copper use is similar to Δex1 strain.Copper-Modulated Gene Expression and Senescence in the Filamentous Fungus Podospora anserina * Δex1 is an 'immortal strain' that has been grown for over 12 years and still shows no signs of senescence. This strain respires via a cyanide-resistant, SHAM- sensitive pathway. This deletion disrupts the COX complexCopper-Modulated Gene Expression and Senescence in the Filamentous Fungus Podospora anserina * wild- type s strain is a wild type strain used in many studies. Described in Esser, 1974. = Aging = Podospora anserina has a definite life span and shows senescence phenotypically (by slower growth, less aerial hyphae, and increased pigment production in distal hyphae). However, isolates show either increased life span or immortality. To study the process of aging many genetic manipulations to produce immortal strains or increase life-span have been done. In general, the mitochondrion and mitochondrial chromosome is investigated (note that animals, closely related to fungi, contain similar organelles like mitochondria). This is because during respiration reactive oxygen species are produced that limit the life span and over time defective mitochondrial DNA can accumulate.The mitochondrial plasmid pAL2-1 reduces calorie restriction mediated life span extension in the filamentous fungus Podospora anserina 2004GENETIC DISSECTION OF COMPLEX BIOLOGICAL TRAITS; THE LIFESPAN EXTENDING EFFECT OF CALORIE RESTRICTION IN THE FILAMENTOUS FUNGUS PODOSPORA ANSERINA With this knowledge, much focus turned to nutrition availability, respiration (ATP synthesis) and oxidases, like cytochrome c oxidase. Carotenoids, pigments also found in plants and provide health benefits to humans,The role of carotenoids in human health are known to be in fungi like Podospora's divergent ancestor Neurospora crassa. In N. crassa (and other fungi) cartenoids al genes, namely focused provide UV radiation protection. Overexpressed of al-2 Podospora anserina increased life span by 31%.Carotenoids and carotenogenic genes in Podospora anserina: engineering of the carotenoid composition extends the life span of the mycelium Calorie restriction studies show that decreased nutrition, like sugar, increase life span (likely due to slower metabolism and thus decreased reactive oxygen species production or induced survival genes). Also, intracellular copper levels were found to be correlated with growth. This was studied in Grisea- deleted and ex1-deleted strains, as well as in a wild type s strain. Podospora without Grisea, a cooper transcription factor, had decreased intracellular copper levels which lead to use of an alternative respiratory pathway that consequently produced less oxidative stress.Copper-Modulated Gene Expression and Senescence in the Filamentous Fungus Podospora anserina = Heterokaryon incompatibility = The following genes, both allelic and nonallelic, are found to be involved in vegetative incompatibility (only those cloned and characterized are listed): het-c, het-c, het-s, idi-2, idi-1, idi-3, mod-A, mode-D, mod-E, psp-A. Podospora anserina contains at least 9 het loci.David Moore.

GENETIC REGULATION OF THE FORMATION OF LACCASE  Genetics  Original genetic studies by gel electrophoresis led to the finding of the genome size, ca. 35 megabases, with 7 chromosomes and 1 mitochondrial chromosome. In the 1980s the mitochondrial chromosome was sequenced. Then in 2003 a pilot study was initiated to sequence regions bordering chromosome V's centromere using BAC clones and direct sequencing.Characterization of the genomic organization of the region bordering the centromere of chromosome V of Podospora anserina by direct sequencing. In 2008, a 10x whole genome draft sequence was published.The genome sequence of the model ascomycete fungus Podospora anserina The genome size is now estimated to be 35-36 megabases.The genome sequence of the model ascomycete fungus Podospora anserina Genetic manipulation in fungi is difficult due to low homologous recombination efficiency and ectopic integrations (insertion of gene at undesirable location)Relationship of vector insert size to homologous integration during transformation of Neurospora crassa with the cloned am (GDH) gene and thus a hindrance in genetic studies (allele replacement and knockouts).Gene deletion and allelic replacement in the Wlamentous fungus Podospora anserina Although in 2005, a method for gene deletion (knock-outs) was developed based on a model for Aspergillus nidulans that involved cosmid plasmid transformation, a better system for Podospora was developed in 2008 by using a strain that lacked nonhomologous end joining proteins (Ku (protein), known in Podospora as PaKu70). This method claimed to have 100% of transformants undergo desired homologous recombination leading to allelic replacement (after the transformation, the PaKu70 deletion can be restored by crossing over with a wild-type strain to yield progeny with only the targeted gene deletion or allelic exchange (e.g. point mutation)).Gene deletion and allelic replacement in the Wlamentous fungus Podospora anserina  Secondary metabolites  It is well known that many organisms across all domains produce secondary metabolites. Fungi are known to be prolific in this regard. Product mining was well underway in the 1990s for the genus Podospora. Specifically for Podospora anserina, two new natural products classified as pentaketides, specifically derivatives of benzoquinones, were discovered; these showed antifungal, antibacterial, and cytotoxic activities.Anserinones A and B: new antifungal and antibacterial benzoquinones from the coprophilous fungus Podospora anserina. Horizontal gene transfer is common in bacteria and between prokaryotes and eukaryotes yet is more rare between eukaryotic organisms. Between fungi, secondary metabolite clusters are good candidates for HGT. For example, a functional ST gene cluster that produces sterigmatocystin was found in Podospora anserina and originally derived from Aspergillus. This cluster is well-conserved, notably the transcription-factor binding sites. Sterigmatocystin itself is toxic and is a precursor to another toxic metabolite, aflatoxin.

The Umayyad army, under Muslim ibn Sa'id al-Kilabi, was campaigning in the Ferghana Valley when it learned of the Türgesh advance. Immediately, the Arabs began a hasty retreat to the Jaxartes, pursued and harassed by the Türgesh cavalry. Finally, after 11 days, the Umayyad army reached the Jaxartes, where it was caught between the Türgesh and the forces of the native Transoxianian principalities. Nevertheless, the Arabs managed to break through and cross the river to Khujand. The Umayyad defeat led to the collapse of Muslim rule over much of the region, which until ca. 740 remained disputed territory, with both the Arabs and the Türgesh fighting for control over it.  Background  The region of Transoxiana had been conquered by the Muslim Arabs of the Umayyad Caliphate under Qutayba ibn Muslim in the reign of al-Walid I (), following the Muslim conquests of Persia and Khurasan in the mid-7th century. The loyalties of Transoxiana's native Iranian and Turkic populations and those of autonomous local rulers remained questionable, however, as demonstrated in 719, when the Transoxianian princes sent a petition to the Chinese and their Türgesh vassals for military aid against the Caliphate's governors. The Türgesh responded by launching a series of attacks against the Muslims in Transoxiana, beginning in 720. These incursions were coupled with uprisings against the Caliphate among the local Sogdians. The Umayyad governor of Khurasan, Sa'id ibn Amr al-Harashi, harshly suppressed the unrest and restored the Muslim position almost to what it had been during the time of Qutayba, except for the Ferghana Valley, control over which was lost.  Expedition against Ferghana and the \\"Day of Thirst\\"  In 723, al-Harashi was replaced as governor by Muslim ibn Sa'id al-Kilabi, who resolved late the next year to launch an expedition with the goal of seizing Ferghana. The campaign faced difficulties already in its early stages, when the news arrived of the accession of a new caliph, Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik, and the appointment of a new governor of Iraq, Khalid al-Qasri. This brought the long-simmering tribal rivalries of the Arabs of Khurasan to the fore: the Yemeni (southern Arab) troops in Balkh initially refused to join the campaign, as they expected the imminent recall of al-Kilabi (who was of northern Arab stock) by the new regime.Khalid al-Qasri replaced a staunch pro-Qays (northern Arab) governor, Umar ibn Hubayra, and was considered as pro-Yemeni. Hawting (2000), p. 82 Only after Nasr ibn Sayyar led a force of Mudaris (northern Arabs) against them and defeated them at Baruqan did the Yemenis join al-Kilabi's army. The campaign eventually went ahead as Khalid al-Qasri wrote to al-Kilabi, urging him to proceed with it until his replacement, Khalid's brother Asad, arrived in Khurasan. Nevertheless, 4,000 troops from the Yemeni Azd tribe withdrew from the army. Al-Kilabi led his army along the Jaxartes valley to Ferghana, and laid siege to it while devastating the surrounding countryside. At this point, the Umayyad army became aware that the Türgesh khagan Suluk was advancing against them with an army stronger than their own. Abandoning the siege, the Muslim army retreated so hastily towards the south that it was claimed they covered a distance in one day that equalled three days of normal travel. On the second day, after the Arabs crossed the river Wadi al-Subuh, the Türgesh army caught up with them, and attacked a secondary camp pitched by Abdallah ibn Abi Abdallah separately from the main Arab force. The Arabs and their Sogdian allies suffered heavy casualties—the brother of the ruler of Samarkand, Ghurak, being among the slain—but managed to repel the attack. The Arabs continued their retreat for eight more days, during which they were constantly harassed by the Türgesh cavalry. On the ninth day, the Arabs reached the Jaxartes only to find their path blocked by their enemies, troops of the native principalities of Shash and Farghana, and the remnants of the Sogdian rebellion that Sa'id al-Harashi had suppressed. The Arabs made camp for the night and burned all their baggage, allegedly worth one million dirhams, in preparation for battle. On the next day, despite suffering from thirst and being hemmed in between the Türgesh on their rear and the Transoxianian forces in front, the desperate Arabs managed to break through the enemy lines and cross the Jaxartes. As al-Tabari writes, when they reached the relative safety of Khujand, \\"suffering from hunger and exhaustion, the troops spread out in disorder\\". There, the leadership of the army was formally transferred to Abd al-Rahman ibn Na'im al-Ghamidi, who led the remnants of the army back to Samarkand.  Aftermath and impact  The defeat of the Arab army, and the casualties suffered, was a catalyst for the almost complete collapse of Muslim rule in Transoxiana over the next few years. In the words of the British scholar H. A. R. Gibb, \\"it was practically the last aggressive expedition of the Arabs into Transoxania for fifteen years, but of much greater importance was the blow which it struck at Arab prestige. The roles were reversed; from now onwards the Arabs found themselves on the defensive and were gradually ousted from almost every district across the Oxus.\\" The new Umayyad governor, Asad al-Qasri, campaigned incessantly over the next few years, but without achieving any major result. Asad also tried to secure the cooperation of the local elites by abolishing for a time the payment of taxes by the native converts (mawali), but this policy was opposed by the Khurasani Arabs themselves, and was reversed by Asad's successor Ashras ibn Abdallah al- Sulami. This led to a general uprising of Transoxiana in 728, and with Türgesh military aid the Arabs were evicted from almost the entire region. Transoxiana thereafter remained contested, and the Arabs did not recover their previous position until the campaigns of Nasr ibn Sayyar in 739–741, who took advantage of the collapse of the Türgesh Khaganate into civil wars after the murder of Suluk in 738.

He lives in Sydney where he is Emeritus Professor at University of New South Wales and Vice-President of the Royal Society of New South Wales.  Academic career and achievements  As foundation professor of theoretical physics at the University of New South Wales from 1975 and emeritus from 1992 he established the Department of Theoretical Physics, where a number of students received the university medal, with a record level of publications and where he supervised most of his 25 PhD students. Guest and adjunct professorships include ones at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, the universities of Rochester, Bern, Iowa, Giessen, Tokyo, Regensburg, Osaka, Western Sydney and the Weizmann Institute. For seven years he was active in industrial research at Zeiss, IBM, Westinghouse and Siemens. He also was involved with research for 12 years at the Max-Planck-Institute for Plasma Physics in Garching near Munich, Germany and for one year as attache remun. at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland. He consulted to the laser movie \\"Der Verräter\\" in the TV series \\"Das Blaue Palais\\". His taped lecture course at CERN (1991) about laser acceleration of particles contributed to Gerard Mourou's PeV particle acceleration. His discoveries include the volume mechanism for photo-electric emission, sub-threshold defect generation by electron beams for producing semiconductor junctions with application in solar cells. Prof. Hora's first publication about growth of diamond crystals by physical vapour deposition became an IBM patent in 1964. His first general formula for nuclear energy gain at laser compression and thermal ignition of fusion led to his subsequent discovery of volume ignition (later confirmed by John Archibald Wheeler as \\"Wheeler modes\\").

In 2012, it was shown that mutations in the gene KAT6B cause the syndrome. Signs and symptoms Genitopatellar syndrome is characterized by genital abnormalities, missing or underdeveloped kneecaps (patellae), intellectual disability and abnormalities affecting other parts of the body. It is also associated with delayed development and intellectual disability, which are often severe. Affected individuals may have an unusually small head (microcephaly) and structural brain abnormalities, including agenesis of the corpus callosum. Major features include: * Patellar hypoplasia/agenesis * Flexion contractures at the hips and knees (including club feet) * Agenesis of the corpus callosum with microcephaly * Hydronephrosis and/or multiple kidney cysts Other features may include: * Dental anomalies (delayed eruption of teeth) * Hearing loss * Thyroid anomalies * Anal anomalies * Hypotonia * Global developmental delay/intellectual disability * Intestinal malrotation Cause Genitopatellar syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. The mutation responsible for the syndrome occurs in the KAT6B gene. This gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 10 (10q22.2). The KAT6B gene gene product is an enzyme called histone acetyltransferase which functions in regulating and making of histone which are proteins that attach to DNA and give the chromosomes their shape. The function of histone acetyltransferase produced from KAT6B is unknown but it is considered as a regulator of early development. There is little known about how the mutation in the KAT6B causes the syndrome but researchers suspects that the mutations occur near the end of the KAT6B gene and causes it to produce shortened acetyltransferase enzyme. The shortened enzyme alters the regulation of other genes. On the other hand, the mutation of KAT6B leading to the specific features of genitopatellar syndrome is still not surely proven. Diagnosis Even though clinical diagnostic criteria have not been 100 percent defined for genitopatellar syndrome, the researchers stated that the certain physical features could relate to KAT6B mutation and result in the molecular genetic testing. The researchers stated that the Individuals with two major features or one major feature and two minor features are likely to have a KAT6B mutation. To diagnose the Genitopatellar Syndrome, there are multiple ways to evaluate. Medical genetics consultation *Evaluation by developmental specialist *Feeding evaluation *Baseline hearing evaluation *Thyroid function tests *Evaluation of males for cryptorchidism *Orthopedic evaluation if contractures are present or feet/ankles are malpositioned *Hip X-rays to evaluate for femoral head dislocation *Kidney ultrasound examination for hydronephrosis and cysts *Echocardiogram for congenital heart defects *Evaluation for laryngomalacia if respiratory issues are present *Evaluation by gastroenterologist as needed, particularly if bowel malrotation is suspected Treatment There is no cure for genitopatellar syndrome. However, there are treatments for the different symptoms. For the developmental symptoms, Educational intervention and speech therapy beginning in infancy could help to reduce the high risk for motor, cognitive, speech, and language delay. For the skeletal features, referral to an orthopedist for consideration of surgical release of contractures. In addition, early referral to physical therapy could help increase joint mobility. Lastly, thyroid hormone replacement could help out the thyroid dysfunction. History In 1988, Goldblatt et al. first reported a 4-year-old boy with hypoplastic patellae, mental retardation, scrotal hypoplasia, skeletal deformities, kidney anomalies, flattened nasal bridge, and short stature. Later in 2000, Cormier- Daire et al. reported seven patients with genital anomalies (scrotal hypoplasia and cryptorchidism in the boys and clitoral hypertrophy in the girls), facial dysmorphism, kidney anomalies, absent patellae, and severe mental retardation in the two survivors.

Biography He was born in Cassel, Germany, where he received his first musical instruction from his father, a court musician. At the age of 9, he was proficient enough to make a performance tour of the Netherlands with his father. After winning a Mozart scholarship in 1841, he began studies of theory and composition under Moritz Hauptmann and violin under Louis Spohr, and after two years of study entered the Cassel court orchestra, where he became concertmaster at the age of 17. In 1846, he left Cassel to travel through Germany. He played before William I and was accompanied by Liszt and Meyerbeer. In 1857, he became court kapellmeister at Meiningen, and then in 1865 accepted a similar position in Hanover. In 1877 he went to Magdeburg to direct the Conservatory there, and in 1880 he went to Braunschweig, where he compiled an encyclopedia on musicians and music. In 1883, he was giving concerts in Hamburg. In 1885 he came to New York. While in the United States, he made it a practice to visit Hamburg every summer. He reportedly died from grief over the loss of his 1725 Stradivarius violin, which was stolen from him on 31 March 1894. It was his favorite, and he would play on no other in a concert. After Bott's death, a violin was found in the store of Victor S. Fletcher at 23 Union Square which his widow said was the stolen violin. She pointed to various identifying features, and two violin makers, August Gemünder and John Friedrich, testified that it was a Stradivarius, contradicting a Mr. Ross who had purchased the violin from Fletcher and said he did not think it a Stradivarius. Family In Meiningen, Bott married Matilda Blomeyer in 1861. Their son entered the German army in 1894, and turned 23 in 1895. Works His works comprise two operas — Der Unbekannte (The Unknown, 1854) and Aktäa, das Mädchen von Korinth (Actea, the maid from Corinth, 1862) — and symphonies, overtures, violin concertos, pianoforte music, solos for violin, and songs.

The Grove is a small village located at Tophill on the Isle of Portland in Dorset. The village is found close to the larger village Easton, and is most notable for containing the Youth Offender's Institute HM Prison Portland, including its museum Grove Prison Museum. As with the rest of Portland's villages and settlements, The Grove has been designated as a conservation area, as it is a place of special architectural and historic interest. The village was designated in 1981.https://www.dorsetforyou.com/415315https://www.dorsetforyou.com/media/199172/Portland- conservation-area- appraisal/pdf/Appraisal_of_the_Conservation_Areas_of_Portland.pdf History The village developed with the establishment of HM Prison Portland in 1848. Before it had no road links or buildings. By the middle of the 19th century, the village's main road, Grove Road, had been established, as a gateway to the prison. The convicts at the prison would provide labour for the building of the breakwaters of Portland Harbour, and a number of surrounding quarries were opened, known as Admiralty Quarries.http://www.southampton.ac.uk/~imw/Portland-Quarries.htm The convicts soon became a tourist attraction,http://www.portland-port.co.uk/history and a number of homeowners along Grove Road opened cafes from the upstairs of their houses for tourists to watch the convicts at work. After becoming a permanent establishment, the prison was converted into a Borstal in 1921, a Young Offenders Institution in 1988, and in 2011 it became an Adult/Young Offenders establishment.http://www.geoffkirby.co.uk/PortlandArchivePictures/html/grove_prison.html The end of the First World War saw a need for housing on Portland, and the first council-built houses were in the Grove's Victoria Road, built in 1932. With the outbreak of World War II, Portland was a natural target for German aircraft, due to the importance of island's naval base.http://www.geoffkirby.co.uk/PortlandArchivePictures/html/world_war_2.html During August 1940 the Borstal was hit with four boys left dead, while during the Easter of 1941 three houses in Augusta Road left four dead.http://www.geoffkirby.co.uk/Portland/695720/ The Grove has seen further housing over the second half of the 20th century, one of which is Rufus Way, built over a filled-in quarry.http://www.geoffkirby.co.uk/Portland/695725/ Portland United Football Club began to play their games at Grove Corner since 1921. During the 1990s, the club's original football ground was moved further into the village to provide quarrying access, and an unexploded World War 2 bomb was discovered. This sparked a major evacuation of 4000 people for a 31-hour operation by the Royal Engineers Bomb Disposal Team. Features To the north of St Peter's Church is a large sports stadium/field, Grove Sports Stadium, which was converted from a disused quarry during the 1930s for the Borstal. Nearby are the Young Offenders Institution farm buildings, and the Grove Lime Kiln. In 2010, funding of a community project to restore the Governor's Community Garden allowed it to be opened to the public - a garden belonging to the Young Offenders Institution. Broadcroft Quarry lies close to the village and features a working quarry and also a nature reserve mainly for butterflies. The old Coastguard Lookout at Grove Point is now used by QinetiQ, as MOD Grove Point.https://www.qinetiq.com/contact/pages/officedetails.aspx?siteid=18 The Grove Point building is used in conjunction with a sea range.http://www.ltpa.co.uk/site_range/loch_goil/index.asp In a field near Shepherds Croft is a World War II Coastal Defence/Chain Home Low (CD/CHL) radar station. The station, named site M73, was constructed by the British Army to monitor shipping and aircraft during the war. It was opened from 1941 but closed by the end of 1942. The Clifton Hotel in 2009. Unlike the majority of Portland's villages, The Grove features very little commercial business and largely consists of housing and the prison. The Grove General Store and Post Office were closed by 2003. The only remaining commercial property now located on Grove Road is The Clifton Hotel. Grade listed features St. Peter's Church The Grove has a wide array of architecture and buildings, a number of which are Grade Listed. One of the village's most notable features is a high wall running along the village's main road. This boundary wall was built to enclose the convict quarry workings. In the turning to Incline Road, set in the wall, is an old prison sentry box. The boundary wall, and the sentry box, are both Grade II Listed. The boundary wall, and gate piers, running from St Peter's Vicarage to Alma Terrace, are Grade II Listed. The early 19th century gate piers at the junction with Grove Road, along with the boundary walls to Ivybank and the Vicarage are also Grade II Listed. The boundary wall west of the prison is Grade II Listed, along with the prison's north and east boundary walls. St. Peter's Church was built by convicts, for soldiers stationed at nearby military garrisons. It was completed in 1872, and is Grade II* Listed. The gate piers and boundary walls to the north and west of the church are also Grade II Listed, as is the church vicarage. At Grove Road is the Church of Our Lady and St. Andrew, built in 1868, and closed at the end of the 20th century.http://taking-stock.org.uk/Home/Dioceses/Diocese-of-Plymouth/Our-Lady- and-St-Andrew-Grove-Portland The village contains Grove Infant School, which closed in 2014. Originally opened in 1872, it is Grade II* Listed. The adjoining School House, along with the rear boundary wall, is also Grade II Listed. Alma Terrace was built in 1854, since restored and designated Grade II. The wash houses and connecting boundary wall to the rear is also Grade II Listed. The Governor's House (102 Grove Road), with its front boundary wall, is Grade II Listed, and was formerly the Governor's House to the prison, built around 1850. Additionally the prison itself has various Grade Listed features. Ivybank, a detached house on Grove Road, of mid 19th century origin, is Grade II Listed, along with its boundary wall. Grove Lime Kiln lies approximately 320 metres north-west of St Peter's Church, and is Grade II Listed. Still owned by the prison service, the lime kiln remains in a derelict state. At the top of the nearby incline road is the abandoned Old Engine Shed that once served the cable-operated inclined railway that ran to Castletown. It is also Grade II Listed Within the village are three Victorian ventilator shafts, once used as ventilators to a sewer system. One lies within the Governor's Community Garden, and the other two shafts are found closer to the cliff edge. All three are Grade II Listed monuments. A War Department/Admiralty boundary marker near the gardens is also Grade II Listed.

She was one of the first women to practice medicine in Chicago.  Early life and education  Thompson was born in Fort Ann, Washington County, New York, April 15, 1829. She was the daughter of John Harris and Calista Corbin Thompson. She began her studies at a nearby school, then transferred to Fort Edward Institute, New York. She continued her studies at a Methodist school, Troy Conference Academy, located in West Poultney, Vermont, and in 1860 enrolled in classes at the New England Female Medical College in Boston.\\"Female Medical College of 100 Years Ago Had Two Professors and Not Even a Skeleton\\", O'Brien, Mary; Daily Boston Globe (1928-1960); Oct 21, 1948; p. 20 During this time she spent one year in an internship at the New York Infirmary for Women and Children, which was founded by physicians Emily and Elizabeth Blackwell. She received her medical degree in 1863.Directory of Deceased American Physicians, 1804-1929 (Allopath) In 1890, the Chicago Medical College granted a degree ad eundem to Thompson.  Career  Upon graduating from the New England Female Medical College, Thompson moved to Chicago, a city which had been founded only 30 years prior and with little competition for a woman physician. She initially worked in the Northwestern Sanitary Commission's Chicago branch (a branch of the United States Sanitary Commission) for Dr. William G. Dyas and Miranda Dyas, serving Civil War veterans’ families in Chicago. During this phase of her career, Thompson was limited in her ability to care for patients; women were not yet permitted to be on any of Chicago's hospital staffs, and at least one area hospital did not admit women as patients. She then founded her own hospital, with the assistance of Rev. William R. Ryder, who raised funds for the project. In May, 1865, the Chicago Hospital for Women and Children opened, and Thompson became chief surgeon and physician, and head of staff – positions she kept the rest of her life. In 1870, Thompson founded Woman's Hospital Medical College. She became one of initial nine faculty members, and served in this role until 1879, when the college separated from the hospital. In 1874, she began directing a nursing school within the hospital. In 1892, she joined the faculty of the Northwestern University Woman's Medical School as a clinical professor of gynaecology. After 10 years of practice, Thompson was admitted to the Chicago Medical Society in 1873; she became the organization's vice president, and its first female officer, in 1886. She was a member of the American Medical Association (AMA), and the AMA's first woman to present a paper to the Section on Diseases of Children, which earned her the role of Section Chair. She published and presented several papers on women's health and childhood diseases during her career. Thompson's private practice as an abdominal and pelvic surgeon was part of her hospital work, and for years she was the sole woman performing major surgery in Chicago. She also invented several surgical instruments and a special abdominal needle adopted by surgeons at the time.  Great Chicago Fire  In 1871, the Great Chicago Fire burned down the buildings of the Woman's Hospital Medical College and the Chicago Hospital for Women and Children. Thompson and her staff ensured her patients were cared for, and soon after reopened for burned and sick patients, male and female, in a private home on Adams street. In 1873, the Relief Aid Society of Chicago donated $25,000 to reopen the hospital and treat patients, and Thompson used the money to open in a new location that same year.  Death  Thompson died in 1895 at age sixty-six, suffering a cerebral hemorrhage. Shortly after her death, the board of the Chicago Hospital for Women and Children renamed the hospital the Mary Thompson Hospital of Chicago for Women and Children. The hospital closed in 1988. In 1905 the hospital board gave the Art Institute of Chicago a bust of Thompson that they commissioned from sculptor Daniel Chester French. Dr. Thompson is buried in Fort Ann Cemetery in Fort Ann, New York together with four of her siblings.

Spanning , it serves as a north/south principal arterial road through eastern Ogden, connecting US-89 (Washington Boulevard), Weber State University, and SR-39 (12th Street). Route description State Route 203 begins in South Ogden at the intersection of Harrison Boulevard and Washington Boulevard (US-89. From there, it travels north via Harrison Boulevard through eastern Ogden, in the shadow of the Wasatch Range, passing Weber State University, Ogden High School, and the Ogden River before ending at 12th Street (SR-39) just below the mouth of Ogden Canyon. The entire route is included in the National Highway System. History Part of Harrison Boulevard was first added to the state highway system in 1911 as what would become Utah State Route 39.Utah Department of Transportation, Highway Resolutions: , updated October 2007, accessed May 2008 State Route 39 originally ran east up 24th Street to Harrison Boulevard, then north along Harrison, then turning east on Valley Drive up Ogden Canyon. Later, in 1935, Harrison Boulevard south of SR-39 was added to the state highway system as Utah State Route 103, running from Route 39 (24th Street at the time) south to Route 5 (modern US-89). Harrison Boulevard north from SR-39 at Valley Drive to 2nd street was added in 1941 as Route 203, designated as continuing north on Harrison, past the Utah State Tuberculosis Sanatorium to 2nd Street, then west to the Army Supply Depot. At this time, some of Harrison Boulevard, from 2nd Street in the north to Route 5 in the south, was in the state highway system, covered by three routes. In 1953, the northern section of Harrison Boulevard was removed from SR-203, leaving that route entirely on 2nd Street. In 1964, SR-39 was realigned from Harrison and 24th to the new roadway constructed on 12th Street at the mouth of Ogden Canyon west to Washington Boulevard. At the same time, SR-203 was extended south along Harrison, re-adding the stretch between 2nd Street and Valley Drive, acquiring what had formerly been part of SR-39 between Valley Drive and 24th Street, and absorbing SR-103 in its entirety. As a result, SR-203 now ran from the Army Depot east along 2nd Street to Harrison, then south to the end of Harrison at present-day US-89, while SR-39 ran straight up 12th Street, and SR-103 was deleted from the state highway system until the route number was reused the following year. In 1969, a number of minor state highways were deleted, and State Route 203 was not immune. The northmost of the route were removed, comprising the roadway from SR-39 north to 2nd Street and west to the Army Depot, leaving the north end of SR-203 at SR-39 (12th Street), where it still remains.

The firm has been involved in some of Quebec's highest- profile family law cases, including Hendricks and Leboeuf v. Quebec, the Quebec Superior Court case which legalized same-sex marriage in Quebec; Lola vs. Eric, a case which resulted in the Quebec Court of Appeal declaring parts of Quebec's common-law marriage legislation to be unconstitutional in its denial of alimony and matrimonial regime rights, a decision ultimately overturned by the Supreme Court; and Bruker v.

Quebec.\\"Anne- France Goldwater Receives CBA SOGIC Ally Award\\" . Canadian Bar Association, August 19, 2003. Broadcasting Goldwater has been an outspoken public figure, earning the nickname \\"Goldfighter\\" for her sometimes controversial public statements. She was selected to host L'Arbitre in part because of her assertive style, which frequently sees her compared to Judge Judy. Goldwater was a panelist in the 2011 edition of Première Chaîne's Le Combat des livres, advocating for a French translation of David Gilmour's memoir The Film Club,\\"8e Combat des livres: les gants sont jetés\\". La Presse, February 25, 2011. and in the 2012 edition of CBC Radio's Canada Reads, advocating for John Vaillant's book The Tiger: A True Story of Vengeance and Survival. She was only the second personality, following Maureen McTeer, ever to participate in both the English and French programs. On the first day of discussions in the English Canada Reads, Goldwater faced criticism after calling Carmen Aguirre \\"a bloody terrorist\\", and alleging that Marina Nemat \\"tells a story that's not true\\". In response, Nemat posted on Facebook, \\"I hope [Goldwater] can produce evidence to back up her claims. If not, I would like to receive a public apology from her.\\" Goldwater responded to the criticism by stating that \\"When you're in a debate, I think it's gloves off. You can't apologize for taking a position in a debate because otherwise you would never take a position in a debate...in this country there is a tolerance for a difference of opinion, and if somebody just doesn't buy your story, they don't buy their story.\\"\\"Canada Reads panelist defends her ‘gloves off’ comments\\".

Issues include air and water pollution, poor waste management infrastructure and deforestation. The Albanian environmental movement includes around 40 active non-government organisations. Issues =Air pollution= Air pollution is a major environmental issue in the bigger cities of Albania, especially the capital, Tirana. The sharp increase in air pollution in bigger cities resulted from a sharp increase in cars' ownership, increasing secondary activity in the area and decrease of urban greenery. Annual average concentrations of PM10 and NO2 in Tirana are above the limit values of National Air Quality Standard and World Health Organization. =Water pollution= Water pollution in Albania is caused by disposal of trash, and discharge of untreated wastewater and sewage. Two rivers which pass through the capital, Tirana, are two of the most polluted rivers in Albania. Lana and Tirana River are clean at their source, but once they enter Tirana, their water is several times more polluted than allowed standards. Industrial pollution of rivers has been observed in the rivers Shkumbini, Fani, Gjanika and Semani, where toxic organic compounds and metals from mining and industrial activity are heavily affecting these rivers. =Waste= The waste management system is composed by a weak collection systems in cities and very little collection systems in rural areas. The Albania’s collection coverage is around to 77%.Waste Atlas(2012) Country Data: ALBANIA Recycling is done by private companies, which employ poor people to collect plastic, metallic, glass and paper waste which is processed or packed and then sold to other countries.http://www.eea.europa.eu/soer/countries/al/soertopic_view?topic=waste The rest is mostly landfilled.

The original carriageway, consisting of a ballasted track on Zores iron profiles, was replaced by a steel trough with ballast in 1982/1983. Several joints of the truss girder were also strengthened using post-tensioned bolts, and the steel elements were entirely repainted for corrosion protection.

Howard's sword and sorcery hero Conan the Barbarian. It was first published in paperback by Tor Books in May 1984, and was reprinted in December 1991; a trade paperback edition followed from the same publisher in 1991. The first British edition was published in paperback by Sphere Books in July 1986 and reprinted in September 1989; a later British edition was published in paperback by Legend Books in February 1997. The novel was later gathered together with Conan the Triumphant and Conan the Destroyer into the hardcover omnibus collection The Conan Chronicles II (Legend, April 1997), and was later gathered together with Conan the Triumphant and Conan the Victorious into the hardcover omnibus collection The Further Chronicles of Conan (Tor Books, October 1999). Plot During a prologue, set in the Kezankian Mountains, an evil priest named Basraken Ismalla sacrifices an entire tribe of hill-men to appease his Dragon god. Also, Ismalla is searching for three magical rubies known as the Eyes of Fire. These gems will allow him to direct the creature against his enemies. The scene shifts to Shadizar, Zamora's infamous City of the Wicked, where a newly arrived Conan attempts to steal an emerald goblet as pension in repaying a gambling debt. However, his plans are thwarted by the interference of Tamira, a female thief. Meanwhile, a noblewoman named Lady Jondra scouts out Conan as a possible paramour, even as Tamira inveigles her way into her household with intent to steal the lady's jewels. Looking to settle scores with the thief, the Cimmerian follows Jondra's hunting party out of the city. At length Conan encounters the lady, separated from her party and beset by wolves. He kills the creatures and so gains her favor. He learns that she is hunting the Dragon. Besting the lady's huntsman after a spear-throwing contest places Conan higher in her estimation and gains him a place in her bed. The party encounters Eldran, a survivor of a Brythunian village destroyed by the Dragon, who, armed with a magic sword, is also hunting the beast. Jondra dismisses his warnings of its ferocity and sends him off. That night the Kezankians attack the camp; Conan rallies the hunters and prevents them from being slaughtered. In the wake of the carnage, General Zanthinides of the Zamoran army shows up, pressing Lady Jondra to return to Shadizar under his escort. She refuses. Later the general attempt to rape her, and is thwarted by Conan. Meanwhile, Basraken Ismalla is frustrated. His thief and his warriors having failed him, his strategems to gain the Eyes of Fire have miscarried, and his leadership of the High Kezankian tribes that revere the Dragon is in jeopardy. He shores up his position by killing a rival chief and takes personal oversight of the effort to obtain the rubies. Lady Jondra's hunting party finally encounters its prey, and is decimated by the Dragon. The survivors scatter. Conan brings those he can find back together. Tamira and the lady are with him that night when the Kezankioans attack the camp slaughtering the hunters. In the battle Conan and Tamira are separated from Jondra. Conan leaves Tamira hidden to go and find Jondra. While he is gone, Tamira is captured by the hillmen. Returning to camp, Conan finds little spared by the hillsmen. He gathers what he can comes and across the chief huntsmen, his mind shattered by the battle, and the encounter with the beast. It is the lone wanderer Eldran who stumbles across her. As petulant as ever, she knocks him unconscious with a well aimed stone when he professes his love for her. She flees only to be captured a short while later by hillsmen. Having lost Jondra, Conan returns to find Tamira missing. He follows the hillsmen's trail and instead stumbles across Eldran and his group. He learns of Jondra's peril. They join forces, and together with Eldran's countrymen continue to seek the lady and Tamira. Jondra and Tamira are now in the hands of Basraken Ismalla. Basraken learns that the Eyes of Fire he sought were with a woman matching Jondra's description he orders his men to search through all the recovered items from the hunter's camp. Conan and the Brythunian party reach Basraken's encampment but seeing the army he has amassed sends a runner to find the Zamoran army and hopefully lead them back assist in the planned attack. Now, having the Eyes of Fire in his possession, Basraken, intends to summon the creature and sacrifice the women. Seeing the women unharmed, Conan, Eldran and one of his men decide that they cannot wait for the army and make an attempt to sneak down into the camp. An alarm rises during the ritual and Conan thinks he is discovered only to hear the cry of the hillsmen. The army has arrived. As the army attacks and Conan attempts the women, the beast heeding its call, arrives into the melee.

In the painting, Carpenter depicts Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States, and his Cabinet members reading over the Emancipation Proclamation, which proclaimed the freedom of slaves in the ten states rebelling against the Union in the American Civil War. Lincoln presented the Emancipation Proclamation to his Cabinet on July 22, 1862, and issued the Proclamation on September 22, 1862, which took effect on January 1, 1863. Carpenter spent six months in the White House while he painted. The painting is displayed at the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C.. Background Carpenter was deeply moved by Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, issued on January 1, 1863, calling it \\"an act unparalleled for moral grandeur in the history of mankind.\\" Carpenter felt \\"an intense desire to do something expressive of... the great moral issue involved in the war.\\" Carpenter, having formulated his idea for the subject of the painting and outlined its composition, met Frederick A. Lane, a friend who recently had earned a large amount of money. Lane agreed to bankroll Carpenter. By the influence of Samuel Sinclair of the New York Tribune and Representative Schuyler Colfax of Indiana, Carpenter gained Lincoln's assent to travel to Washington and work with him on the painting. Carpenter met with the President on February 6, 1864, who allowed him to live in the White House for four months, to work on the painting. Carpenter began with many sketches of Cabinet members and of Lincoln himself, working from life, as Lincoln worked, and from photographs taken by Mathew Brady of Lincoln and members of his Cabinet. Carpenter was given free access to Lincoln's White House office for the former purpose, and the State Dining Room was given him for a studio.U.S. Senate Art & History site retrieved 2008 On July 12, 1864, Lincoln led his cabinet into the State Dining Room to view the completed work.A Genealogical History of the Rehoboth Branch of the Carpenter Family in America.

Lincoln indicated to Carpenter each person's position in the room on the day of the first reading. The artist had found the placement \\"fortunately entirely consistent with my purpose.\\"Harold Holzer, Gabor S. Boritt, and Mark E. Neely, Jr., The Lincoln Image: Abraham Lincoln and the Popular Print (New York: Scribner, 1984; Reprint, Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2001), 117. Carpenter intentionally avoided, as he wrote, \\"imaginary curtain or column, gorgeous furniture or allegorical statue.\\"Carpenter, p. 18 Shown from left to right are Edwin M. Stanton, Secretary of War (seated); Salmon P. Chase, Secretary of the Treasury (standing); Lincoln; Gideon Welles, Secretary of the Navy (seated); Caleb Blood Smith, Secretary of the Interior (standing); William H. Seward, Secretary of State (seated); Montgomery Blair, United States Postmaster General (standing); and Edward Bates, United States Attorney General (seated). Portraits of Simon Cameron and Andrew Jackson adorn the wall behind them. Carpenter said, \\"There were two elements in the Cabinet–-the radical and the conservative. Mr. Lincoln was placed at the head of the official table, between two groups, nearest that representing the radical; but the uniting point of both. The chief powers of a government are War and Finance: the ministers of these were at his right–-the Secretary of War, symbolizing the great struggle, in the immediate foreground; the Secretary of the Treasury, actively supporting the new policy, standing by the President’s side.... To the Secretary of State, as the great expounder of the principles of the Republican party... would the attention of all at such a time be given.... The... chief officers of the government were thus brought in accordance with their relations to the administration, nearest the person of the President, who, with the manuscript proclamation in his hand, which he had just read, was represented leaning forward, listening to, and intently considering the views presented by the Secretary of State.\\"Carpenter, p16, p18 The map shown at the bottom right corner of the painting is a map made by the US Coast Survey in 1861 by using census data from 1860, and shows the relative prevalence of slavery in Southern counties that year. Exhibition of and reception When Lincoln had the painting exhibited to the public in the East Room of the White House, Carpenter noted that the exhibition was thronged with visitors. An engraving of the painting was made by Alexander Hay Ritchie for mass reproduction. The painting was well received by critics, according to newspaper advertisements for those reproductions; also, many of the subjects in the painting commented favorably. The painting itself then toured the country. Chase wrote a letter to Carpenter in 1866, remarking the composition of the work, noting that he and Stanton appear symbolically on Lincoln's right in the painting, having \\"thoroughly endorsed and heartily welcomed the measure,\\" and the cabinet members who had at first \\"doubted, or advised delay, or even opposed\\" the proclamation appear on Lincoln's left. [7] Carpenter later wrote a memoir of his experience painting the portrait, titled Six Months at the White House. Purchase and donation to Congress Carpenter campaigned for Congress to purchase the painting, enlisting the help of fellow Homer native William O. Stoddard, Lincoln's private secretary. Congress did not appropriate the money. The painting remained in Carpenter's possession until 1877, when he arranged for Elizabeth Thompson to purchase it for $25,000 and donate it to Congress. A joint session of Congress was held in 1878, on Lincoln's birthday, to serve as a reception for the painting. The artist was present at this event.

She was the wife of Marek Żuławski. Halina Korn Biography Her father, Julian, was a representative of foreign companies selling leather goods. Her mother, came from the Petite bourgeoisie and was brought up in a small provincial town near Lyon in France. Before the war, Korngold studied journalism in the Warsaw School of Political Sciences. At the same time she took singing lessons from Adela Comte-Wilgocka and the distinguished Stanisława Korwin-Szymanowska, sister of Karol Szymanowski. In August 1939 she left for France, where she was overtaken by the outbreak of World War II. In Paris, she worked as a typist in the Ministry of Welfare, part of the Polish government-in-exile, with which she moved to Angers. After the Fall of France in May 1940, she came to Great Britain where she stayed until the end of her life. She started painting and sculpting in 1941 and signed her works as \\"Korn\\". In January 1948, she had her first solo exhibition entitled, \\"Paintings of London Life\\" in London’s Mayor Gallery. In the fifties, she wrote exhibition reviews and texts about art for the BBC Polish Section. In 1965, due to increasing mental illness - bipolar disorder, she underwent neuro-surgery which brought her creativity to a stop. She is the author of Wakacje kończą się we wrześniu (Holidays end in September), published in 1983, with a preface by Stefan Themerson. It was everyday life, watched and caught in London streets, and people (she neither understood or liked abstraction) that became the subject of her work from the beginning. She painted the world around her: women in a mechanical laundry, a boy with a chunk of meat, mannequins in a shop window, coalmen, men and women on an escalator and people in a coffee shop. She depicted scenes of parks, psychology clinics, funerals, circuses as well as strip-joints. Maternity was a common motif in her works, particularly in sculpture. Halina Korn’s creativity, difficult to classify, was considered to be part of the Naive Art movement. Among others, Ignacy Witz, Feliks Topolski and Aleksander Jackowski wrote about her in his encyclopaedic outline entitled Sztuka zwana naiwną (Art termed naive). Quite a few critics emphasized her infallible flair for composition and form as well as her extraordinary sensitivity to colour. She had a few solo exhibitions in London, Edinburgh and New York, including a series of exhibitions in Poland (Warsaw, Cracow, Gdynia, Katowice). In England, she exhibited with the London Group, in Royal Academy, Women’s International Art Club. She was the member of Artists' International Association (AIA) and a founding member of the Arts Society of Paddington. Halina Korn’s works are in the National Museum, Warsaw and in Poznań, University Museum in Toruń, London’s Ben Uri Gallery & Museum among others and in numerous private collections, including in The Anthony Petullo Collection of Self-Taught and Outsider Art.Halina Korn entry on the Anthony Petullo website She was buried in London’s Kensal Green Cemetery on 6 October 1978.

He made a second camera, but quickly sold it also. As a result, he dropped the idea of becoming a school photographer and instead began building cameras for sale under the name VE-JA-DE Products (from his initials, V.J.D.).‘’Ste. Genevieve — A Leisurely Stroll Through History.’’ Bill Naeger, Patti Naeger, Mark L. Evans, Merchant Street Publishing, Ste. Genevieve, MO, 1999, page 33 They are the first documented mass-produced cameras specifically designed for school photography, starting a trend that has spread to high schools throughout the U.S. Vincent hand built all his cameras from walnut that he selected himself.

According to those who worked with him, production over the years was fairly evenly divided between 35 mm and 70 mm model cameras. During World War II Vincent sold many hundreds of his cameras to the U.S. Army for use in making IDs, photos of recruits, photos of war prisoners, etc. Other VE-JA-DE Products In 1926, Vincent filed for a patent on a contact printer that is somewhat similar in design to the many contact printers sold by Kodak in the 1930s and 1940s, but rather than making one contact print at a time, the Dunker printer was designed to use a long roll of contact paper inside along with strips of negatives on top of the printer to produce contact prints in a much more rapid manner than other contact printers of the time.U.S. patent No. 1,693,891, December 4, 1928. http://ip.com/patent/US1693891 His contact printer was sold throughout the United States as well as overseas.

Genevieve.’’ The exhibition included several Dunker cameras and numerous early photographs of Ste. Genevieve taken by Vincent. Dunker built a wide variety of cameras, contact printers and photo enlargers over a period of thirty-seven years. Many of his cameras were specifically designed for making high school photos for yearbooks and school photos for student purchase. He is the first documented mass-builder of such cameras in the U.S. As such, he can be considered the father of what is now a nationwide industry.

Left-wing artists had already formed groups, such as the November Group, Dadaist groups, or from 1924 to 1926, the Red Group, with which George Grosz, John Heartfield and Rudolf Schlichter were involved. Heinrich Vogeler had also formed the Arbeitsgemeinschaft kommunistischer Künstler (\\"Working Group of Communist Artists\\"). Further impetus to form a larger organization came from the \\"Central Atelier for Visual Propaganda\\", an arm of the KPD offices at the Karl-Liebknecht-Haus in Berlin. Several groups joined the Asso. Gregor Gog's artists group, the Brotherhood of Vagabonds (\\"Bruderschaft der Vagabunden\\") joined the Asso in 1931. In 1932, Oskar Nerlinger's group, \\"The Moderns\\" (\\"Die Zeitgemäßen\\"), previously called \\"The Abstracts\\", joined as well. The Asso also embraced Franz Wilhelm Seiwert's group of progressive artists, the Cologne Progressives, and the \\"Collective for Socialist Building\\". The Asso published a journal called Der Stoßtrupp and its first exhibition was in Berlin in 1929. For many Communist artists, art was a \\"weapon\\" to be used rallying the masses to the class struggle. Accordingly, the Asso produced placards, posters, propaganda art and banners for the Communist Party, Rote Hilfe and other organizations.

AFY is based on fostering \\"faith-building and life-changing learning\\", based on the principles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The camp is designed to help youth enjoy nature, participate in a variety of recreational activities, and grow personally and spiritually as they join in faith-building experiences with those who share similar beliefs. History of AFY AFY started more than a decade ago at BYU-Idaho's Outdoor Learning Center. Youth participated in activities on the high and low ropes courses and then spiritual discussions with their groups and counselors. Due to the increase in the number of students at BYU–Idaho, the Community Connections Department (the department that facilitates AFY) resources were reassigned to other areas on campus, so AFY was closed at BYU-I in 2017. Rather than letting the program come to an end, BYU Division of Continuing Education reached out to the BYU-Idaho team and asked about picking it up and moving it to a different location. BYU-I agreed, and since 2017 both teams have been working together to make AFY better than ever and transition from the Idaho mountains to the red rocks of Moab, Utah. Location Located in Moab, AFY is set in red rock formations that are used for the outdoor adventures that take place throughout the week. AFY activities AFY is a program that focuses on teaching \\"For the Strength of Youth\\" principles through experiential learning. The week is full of activities including river rafting down the Colorado River, hiking, climbing, and rappelling through Bull Canyon, and mountain biking on the Magnificent 7 trail system. Along with daily physical activities youth will engage in faith building group discussions, scripture study, and devotionals. Purpose of AFY The purpose of Adventure For Youth (AFY) is to encourage youth to \\"draw closer to the Savior by acting on true principles, participating in adventure activities, and seeking an excellent balance in all things\\". As youth go throughout the week, they're organized into companies, or groups of peers. These peers are their support system for the week. Each company is also assigned counselors who are in a similar stage of life and are there to support and be examples for the youth. In addition to providing a camp where teens can make friends and participate in a variety of outdoor activities, AFY is a place that encourages gospel discussions and spiritual growth.

They are highly significant to paleontology and avian evolution in that they document the fossil record's oldest-known birds.Wellnhofer (2009) p. 9 Over the years, twelve body fossil specimens of Archaeopteryx and a feather that may belong to it have been found, though the Haarlem specimen was reassigned to another genus by two researchers in 2017. All of the fossils come from the upper Jurassic lithographic limestone deposits, quarried for centuries, near Solnhofen, Germany.National Geographic News- Earliest Bird Had Feet Like Dinosaur, Fossil Shows - Nicholas Bakalar, 1 December 2005, Page 1. Retrieved 2006-10-18.  The feather  The single feather The initial discovery, a single feather, was unearthed in 1860 or 1861 and described in 1861 by Christian Erich Hermann von Meyer. The fossil consists of two counterslabs, designated BSP 1869 VIII 1 (main slab) and MB.Av.100 (counterslab), which are currently located at the Bavarian State Collection of Paleontology and Geology of Munich University and the Natural History Museum in Berlin, respectively.Wellnhofer (2009) p. 46 Although it was the initial holotype, there were indications that it might not have been from the same animal as the body fossils, but from another, as yet undiscovered, avialan. = History = Discovery and acquisition The feather was first described in a series of correspondence letters between Hermann von Meyer and Heinrich Georg Bronn, the editor of the German Jahrbuch für Mineralogie journal. Examining the fossil on both counterpart split slabs, von Meyer immediately recognized it as an asymmetrical bird feather, most likely from a wing, with an \\"obtusely angled tip\\" and a \\"here and there gaping vane\\", and noted its blackish appearance. Six weeks after writing this first letter in August 1861, von Meyer wrote again to the editor stating that he had been informed of a nearly- complete skeleton of a feathered animal from the same lithographic shale deposits, which would later be known as the London specimen. Coincidentally, von Meyer proposed the name Archaeopteryx lithographica for the feather, but not for the skeleton. Therefore, the official name of the animal was originally linked to the single feather rather than any actual skeleton, and is formally considered the original holotype. Though 1860 is often the year named for the feather's discovery, there is no proof of this date, and some authors consider it more likely to have been found in 1861, as it seems reasonable that von Meyer's original letter was likely sent not longer after it came into his possession. The feather was discovered in the partition of the Solnhofen Community Quarry located southwest of the municipality of Solnhofen in a forested district known as Truhenleite, which was opened in 1738. 25 meters of the limestone profile of Upper Solnhofen strata are exposed here, but no information was given about which horizon the feather originated from, though the fossil's dark colour may indicate that it came from a deeper level where it was protected from weathering. Today, the quarry is abandoned and the location is built up.  Original description  Von Meyer published his official description of the feather in the journal Palaeontographica in April 1862, wherein he expressed some doubt of its exact age and affinity. In his original description von Meyer mentioned neither the original discoverer nor the collector by name, and also omitted any diagnostic information about its prior ownership. It wasn't until the year of von Meyer's death, 1869, that the main slab came into the Munich collections. The feather's counterslab was acquired by the Natural History Museum of Berlin in 1876, after having been part of the private collection of von Fischer, a Munich physician.Wellnhofer (2009) p. 47 Hermann von Meyer There was also some initial uncertainty as to whether the fossil represented a real feather as in modern birds, though von Meyer pointed out that he could detect no morphological difference between the fossil imprint and modern feathers, and was able to recognize the central shaft, the barbs and the barbules. He described the lower end of the shaft (the calamus) as being less clearly imprinted than the rest, and concluded that the feather may have belonged to a juvenile individual for whom the shaft was still soft. Von Meyer also noted that due to having been compressed, the vane was split in several places. As part of his original description von Meyer compared the feather to that of a partridge, noting that the only discernible difference was in being slightly smaller and less rounded at the end. Some doubt also existed at first as to whether the feather was a real fossil from the Solnhofen lithographic limestone. The preservation was regarded by von Meyer as unusual and therefore suspicious, as it appeared to be \\"transformed into a black substance\\" that reminded him of dendrites, which are inorganic pseudofossils. He thought it was possible that someone had skillfully painted the feather onto the stone. However, he could not conceive of an artificial way in which such a perfect feather - especially as it was reproduced in a perfect mirror image on both counterslabs - could be created by a human hand, and therefore concluded the feather must be genuine.Wellnhofer (2009) p. 46-47 Though von Meyer was certain that the fossil feather was real, he was very reluctant to assign it with certainty to a bird, noting that the concurrent feathered skeleton could be \\"a feathered animal which differs from our birds essentially\\". His reluctance to link feathers to birds with certainty was prophetic, as it predated the discovery of very advanced, birdlike feathers on non-avian theropod dinosaurs by well over a century. = Specimen = After von Meyer's original 1862 description, no additional analyses of the feather were performed until 1996, when a detailed assessment of its morphology, function, taxonomy and taphonomy was produced by Griffiths, and the feather was later studied under ultraviolet light in 2004 by Tischlinger and Unwin.Wellnhofer (2009) p. 48 The feather was further studied using scanning electron microscopy technology and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis in 2012, and laser- stimulated fluorescence in 2019.  Morphology  The feather has a total length of , and the vane is at the widest margin. The end of the feather has an obtuse angle of 110°, while the barbs branch off from the rachis at an angle of around 25°. The barbs branch noticeably into barbules, as in the feathers of modern birds. The base of the feather consists of plumulaceous barbs which are unconnected to one another and result in a down-like appearance. This tuft of down led Griffiths to conclude that Archaeopteryx might have been endothermic in that it implies the use of thermal insulation. Image of the feather published in von Meyer's 1862 description The feather is clearly asymmetrical, which has been interpreted by researchers to be a clear indication of its aerodynamic function as a flight feather. As the feather bears little resemblance to the retrices (tail feathers) of the other full Archaeopteryx skeletons, it is generally thought to be a wing feather: Griffiths and others have concluded it was a remex (wing feather), while Carney and colleagues in 2012 interpreted it to be a covert feather. The feather has a relatively low degree of asymmetry, which Speakman and Thompson in 1994 concluded to indicate it as a secondary remex. If this is the case, then it would have originated from an animal smaller than even the Eichstätt specimen, which is the smallest Archaeopteryx specimen known to date. This is consistent with von Meyer's much earlier interpretation of the feather as having belonged to a juvenile. Although the calamus (quill) of the feather is no longer visible, Kaye and colleagues identified a corresponding geochemical halo using laser-stimulated fluorescence in 2019. On this basis, they cast doubt against all of these interpretations. First, they noted that the feather is more curved and less asymmetrical than the known primary remiges of Archaeopteryx, and too short relative to the secondary remiges of other specimens. Unlike the coverts of modern birds, they also noted that the center line of the calamus is straight and not S-shaped, although they did not rule out a covert or contour (body) feather identity. Carney and colleagues provided a rebuttal to Kaye and colleagues in 2020; they noted that Kaye and colleagues underestimated the length of the calamus based on von Meyer's description, and noted that coverts without S-shaped center lines are found at the wing tips of birds. They considered the feather to be more consistent with an upper major primary covert than any other type of feather.  Colouration  The feather was studied under UV light by Tischlinger and Unwin in 2004, and they found that a pattern of dark and light spots were visible on each side of the shaft. This was interpreted as remnants of the original pigment design that would have been on the feather in life, similar to the spots and bars on the feathers of modern partridges or birds of prey. It isn't possible to be certain of this, however, so conclusions about the colouration and patterning of the plumage cannot be drawn with certainty from this study. In 2012, Carney and colleagues performed the first colour study on an Archaeopteryx specimen with the fossil of this single feather. Using scanning electron microscopy technology and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, the team was able to detect the structure of melanosomes in the fossil. The resultant structure was then compared to that of 87 modern bird species and was determined with a high percentage of likelihood to be black in colour. While the study does not mean that Archaeopteryx was entirely black, it does suggest that it had some black colouration which included the coverts (or possibly the secondary remiges). Carney pointed out that this is consistent with what we know of modern flight characteristics, in that black melanosomes have structural properties that strengthen feathers for flight. In 2020, they re- performed the analysis using the specimen's melanosome imprints and an expanded dataset of birds, and predicted a matte black (non-iridescent) colouration with high probability. They reconstructed the entire feather as black, with a darker tip.  Taphonomy  The feather, shown on full slab of Solnhofen limestone The preservation of the fossil feather is unusual. In contrast to the feather imprints found on the full skeletons of Archaeopteryx, the isolated feather is preserved as a dark film, which could be composed either of organic matter (as in most fossil feathers) or as inorganic minerals. Though it is theoretically possible to determine which it is, studying the physical component of the preserved dark film would require taking away a certain amount of the material from the fossil, and no curator was willing grant permission for such damage to a valuable holotype specimen. Since dendrites are very common in Solnhofen limestones, it is possible that the structures could have formed along the cracks and fissures of the limestone, and subsequently penetrated the minute hollow left in the limestone from the decay of the feather. The manganese dioxide solutions could then have imitated all of the fine detail of the original feather, creating a pseudomorph. Billy and Cailleux, in 1969, proposed a mechanism by which bacteria could have created a similar effect with manganese dioxide. Davis and Briggs (1995) studied that the fossilization of feathers often involves the formation of bacterial mats, and found fossil bacteria with scanning electron microscopy upon the fossil feathers of birds from the Eocene Green River Formation and the Cretaceous Crato Formation. However, an SEM investigation on the isolated Archaeopteryx feather would also require a sample to be extracted, and has not yet been done. One explanation for the marked difference in preservation between the isolated feather and the body feathers of known skeletal specimens is that the single feather was likely shed during molt. This means that it would not have been connected to the body by ligaments and connective tissue, and was probably lost on dry land and was washed or blown into the lagoon. The feather could have been colonized by bacteria during the feather's travel time, as it likely did not sink to the bottom immediately after being shed, which could have initiated the taphonomic processes that rely on the presence of bacteria. One unique feature of the isolated feather specimen is that it features a series of small black spots and filaments, which are around the same diameter as the feather barbs, both across the feather and along the surfaces of both slabs. Von Meyer pointed out these structures in his original description, and described them as being similar to \\"short hairs\\" which probably originated from the animal's skin. However, due to being deposited both on the upper and lower surface of the slabs which indicates they were deposited at different times, it is more likely that they are remnants of plant material that may have been ground down before being washed into the lagoon along with the feather.  Taxonomy  Archaeopteryx lithographica was initially named for this original feather, rather than the full skeleton that was found around the same time, and the feather was originally the formal type specimen and holotype for the species. There are obvious problems with this idea, such as the fact that the feather may have come from a juvenile, or possibly another species altogether. The distal obtuse angle at the tip is not a feature found on the feathers of any other Archaeopteryx skeleton with integument imprints. It is possible, however, that the strange angle of the tip is an artifact caused by inappropriate preservation, as pointed out by Tischlinger and Unwin in 2004. Speakman and Thomson also found that the degree of asymmetry is different in this isolated feather than it is in similar feathers of the skeletal specimens of Archaeopteryx - the asymmetry of feathers in the skeletons ranged from 1.44 in the London specimen to 1.46 in the Berlin specimen, while the single feather as an asymmetry ratio of 2.2. These measurements are not conclusive, however, because the differences in asymmetry may be due to incomplete distal ends, overlapping, or monomorphic scaling, and may be meaningless for ascertaining the phylogenetic position of this feather. Owing to the inconsistency in morphology between the feather and other known Archaeopteryx specimens, Kaye and colleagues also suggested in 2019 that may have originated from another dinosaur, either an avialan or a more basal member of the wider group Pennaraptora. However, Carney and colleagues cast doubt on this suggestion in 2020, noting that the feather is proximal in time and space to other Archaeopteryx specimens, and that it would be more probable for the feather to be within the range of individual variation among Archaeopteryx. Whether the feather truly belongs to Archaeopteryx or to a different taxon remains unresolved, but what is certain is that the feather does represent the oldest example of a bird feather in the fossil record.  The London specimen  Replica of London specimen The first skeleton, known as the London Specimen (BMNH 37001),British Museum of Natural History - 'BMNH 37001' - the type specimen was unearthed in 1861 near Langenaltheim, Germany and perhaps given to a local physician Karl Häberlein in return for medical services. He then sold it for £700 to the Natural History Museum in London, where it remains. Missing most of its head and neck, it was described in 1863 by Richard Owen as Archaeopteryx macrura, allowing for the possibility it did not belong to the same species as the feather. In the subsequent 4th edition of his On the Origin of Species,Darwin, Origin of Species, Chapter 9, p. 367 Charles Darwin described how some authors had maintained \\"that the whole class of birds came suddenly into existence during the eocene period; but now we know, on the authority of Professor Owen, that a bird certainly lived during the deposition of the upper greensand; and still more recently, that strange bird, the Archeopteryx, with a long lizard-like tail, bearing a pair of feathers on each joint, and with its wings furnished with two free claws, has been discovered in the oolitic slates of Solnhofen. Hardly any recent discovery shows more forcibly than this how little we as yet know of the former inhabitants of the world.\\". Please note Darwin's spelling: 'Archeopteryx', not 'Archaeopteryx'. The Greek term \\"pteryx\\" (πτέρυξ) primarily means \\"wing\\", but can also designate merely \\"feather\\". Von Meyer suggested this in his description. At first he referred to a single feather which appeared like a modern bird's remex (wing feather), but he had heard of and been shown a rough sketch of the London specimen, to which he referred as a \\"Skelet eines mit ähnlichen Federn bedeckten \\" (\\"skeleton of an animal covered in similar feathers\\"). In German, this ambiguity is resolved by the term Schwinge which does not necessarily mean a wing used for flying. Urschwinge was the favored translation of Archaeopteryx among German scholars in the late 19th century. In English, \\"ancient pinion\\" offers a rough approximation. = History = Hermann von Meyer learned of the discovery of what would later be known as the London Specimen before he published his analysis of the single Archaeopteryx feather. In September 1861 he wrote to the \\"Neues Jahrbuch\\" about being informed of the discovery by Friedrich Ernst Witte, an avid fossil collector and jurist by profession, and commented on the coincidental nature of learning of a feathered skeleton from the Solnhofen strata while studying the feather. Witte had visited a well-known collector of Solnhofen fossils, Dr. Karl Häberlein, in the summer of 1861 whereupon he had first seen this \\"skeleton of an animal furnished with feathers\\" at the fossil collector's home in Pappenheim. Clearly recognizing the significance of such a fossil, he then immediately wrote to Hermann von Meyer as well as Andreas Wagner, the Munich Professor of Paleontology. He subsequently traveled to Munich in order to convince Wagner to purchase the fossil for the Bavarian State Collections.Wellnhofer (2009) p. 49 Witte later recounted his visit with Wagner in 1863 in a letter to the editor of \\"Neues Jahrbuch\\": He goes on to describe the visit paid to the fossil by Wagner's assistant after being told of the Solnhofen fossil feather published by von Meyer. Despite this, he still stuck to his conviction that the animal represented a saurian, and named it Griphosaurus. Witte is regarded as being the main person responsible for alerting the scientific community of existence and significance of the London Specimen. He took a remarkably prescient standpoint in claiming that the debate of whether it was allied with birds or reptiles was irrelevant, and that the animal \\"has characters of both and is strictly none of them\\". The only relevant question, he said, was which characters predominate, and which class it must be allied with \\"for the time being\\".Wellnhofer (2009) p. 49-50 It is not known with certainty how Dr. Häberlein first came into possession of the specimen, though as it was found in the section of the Solnhofen Community Quarry belonging to Johann Friedrich Ottman, it is reasonable to assume that Ottman sold the fossil to Häberlein directly. Häberlein offered his feathered fossil to the State Paleontological Collection in Munich after its director, Albert Oppel, examined it in 1861 in Pappenheim. Though Oppel had not been granted permission by the owner to draw the fossil, he retained an accurate memory of its appearance and was able to reproduce it upon his return. The sketch was later given to Wagner, who wanted the honor of describing the fossil first. Shortly after, Wagner presented a talk at the Bavarian Academy of Sciences, which was later published as an article in 1862. In this talk, Wagner gives a detailed account of the curious combination of avian and saurian features that made the fossil so unique and mysterious. He describes the feather imprints of the fossil to be \\"those of true birds\\", and went on to describe other features, like the long tail, that bore \\"not the least resemblance to that of a bird\\". He compares the fossil to Rhamphorhynchus, a Solnhofen pterosaur which also possessed a long, bony tail. He regarded the creature as a \\"mongrel\\" of bird and reptile, the whole of which was incomprehensible to him.Wellnhofer (2009) p. 50Wager, A. 1862. On a new Fossil Reptile supposed to be furnished with Feathers. -Annals and Magazine of Natural History (3)9: 261-267; London. Despite these comments, Wagner made it clear that he did not regard the feather-like imprints as proof of real bird feathers. He claimed that the imprints may merely be \\"peculiar adornments\\" and that he did not hesitate to regard it as a reptile. Wellnhofer points out that his reasoning behind this opinion was likely due to his anti- Darwinist approach to paleontology, which is confirmed in Wagner's November 1862 talk, wherein he makes a statement on the new fossil with the intention to \\"ward off Darwinian misinterpretations of our new Saurian\\". He was uncomfortable with the idea that a \\"transitional fossil\\" could exist, and in Wagner's creation-centered interpretation of paleontology, there was no room for a form intermediate between reptile and bird.Wellnhofer (2009) p. 50-51  Purchase by the British Museum  Slabs of the London specimen While the arguments about the nature of the new feathered animal were underway, negotiations were taking place between Dr. Häberlein and the British Museum of London, as the offer of sale to the Bavarian State Collection had failed. On 28 February 1862, a letter was written by George Robert Waterhouse, the Keeper of the Geological Department of the British Museum, to Häberlein asking if he'd be willing to sell the fossil. This letter was written at the request of Richard Owen, who was the Superintendent of the British Museum's Natural History division. Häberlein was interested in selling, but made it clear that he had a lot of other interested potential buyers from a variety of countries, and the competition was driving the price quite high.Häberlein, E. German Letter of 21 March 1862. He was 74 years old and quite ill at the time, and wished to sell his entire collection of Solnhofen fossils, which was fairly substantial. His original price for his full collection was set at 750 pounds sterling.Häberlein, E. German Letter of 29 May 1862. Owen presented this letter to his museum, and was thereafter sent to Pappenheim to negotiate with Häberlein, but had orders to spend no more than 500 pounds. Häberlein, however, was unwilling to part with the fossil for less than 650 pounds. For several weeks afterwards, the museum struggled to find a solution that would work within the limits of their budget. Waterhouse and Owen finally offered that Häberlein would be paid a sum of 450 pounds for the Archaeopteryx specimen during that year, and an additional 250 pounds would be paid the following year for the rest of the collection. Häberlein agreed to this somewhat grudgingly, and the fossil was packed and shipped to London at the end of September 1862.Häberlein, E. German Letter of 6 August 1862. As promised, the rest of the collection - totaling 1,756 Solnhofen specimens - was purchased the following year. In this way the London Museum came to acquire a truly important collection of fossils, many of them quite rare or undescribed at the time.Wellnhofer (2009) p. 51 Wellnhofer remarks that it was likely not the price that kept the Bavarian State Paleontological Collection in Munich from acquiring the fossil, but rather the hesitating attitude of Andreas Wagner which delayed any action. Following Wagner's death in 1861, negotiations with Häberlein certainly would have been all the more difficult. In the wake of this important transaction of the first Archaeopteryx body fossil, many German scientists bitterly regretted its departure from its native land to London. Frankfurt zoologist David Friedrich Weinland, for instance, commented that \\"the English became greedy for the treasure\\".Weinland, D. F. 1863. Der Greif von Solenhofen (Archaeopteryx lithographica H. v. Meyer). - Der Zoologische Garten 4(6): 118-122; Frankfurt a.M. The collection's final selling price of 700 pounds, or 8,400 Bavarian guldens, was calculated at approximately 18,340 British pounds in 1987,Rolfe, W. D. Jan, A. C. Milner & F. G. Hay 1988. The Price of Fossils. - Special Papers in Palaeontology 40(1988): 139-171; London. though that calculation may be low. In any case, it was considered to be a small fortune at the time. Häberlein allegedly used the payment as a dowry for one of his daughters. Historical reviews Henry Woodward's London Archaeopteryx sketch Andreas Wagner produced the first description of the fossil despite having not yet seen it; his interpretation was based on reports of Albert Oppel and Friedrich Ernst Witte. Wagner compared the specimen to the long-tailed pterosaur Rhamphorhynchus and suggested the integument of the London specimen as not being identical to bird feathers. Indeed, Wagner believed the specimen to represent a reptile and attempted to name it Griphosaurus, the enigmatic reptile. In October 1862, the fossil arrived in London and Richard Owen immediately began the scientific investigation. Then a staunch opponent to the theory of Darwinian evolution, Owen was intensely interested in this so-called transitional fossil that showed a strange mix of avian and reptilian characteristics. His first presentation of the results of his investigation was a talk at the Royal Society in London in November, and was published as an abstract in the Proceedings of the Royal Society the following year. Here he considered the single feather described by von Meyer in 1861 and assigned the new skeleton the same genus. Owen speculated possible short- and long-tailed forms of Archaeopteryx and on these grounds assigned the London specimen the species name macrura, meaning \\"long-tailed\\". Owen, who published a monograph on the specimen in 1863, generally considered the animal to be a bird despite describing its structure and proportions as resembling a flying squirrel. After conducting an embryological comparison with modern birds, he noticed a similarity between Archaeopteryx and the embryonic stage of birds, concluding that the former was likely an \\"archetype\\", or created kind, of the bird lineage. Owen's monograph presented a description of the osteology and the plumage, though he missed a number of elements. Owing to its overall similarity to the structure of modern birds, Owen postulated a toothless, horny beak-like instrument \\"fitted for preening\\", and misinterpreted the fragment of an upper jaw with teeth, located next to the pelvis on the specimen, as the remains of a fish. Fragments of the braincase and upper jaw were later identified and published by other researchers. While Owen's 1863 monograph on the specimen is historically considered to be the first real description of Archaeopteryx, Henry Woodward, assistant of the Geological Department of the British Museum, had published a shorter article on the specimen in December 1862. Here he provided a detailed description as well as the first published illustration of the specimen, sketched from the original. Rather than an attempt to steal Owen's glory, Woodward gave him due credit in this article as its official describer. Woodward's article nevertheless precipitated the first surge of widespread knowledge of the specimen across Europe.Wellnhofer (2009) p. 52-55 In the subsequent years of the 19th century, the London specimen was subject to a number of analyses by other researchers of historical importance, including Thomas Huxley, Othniel Charles Marsh, Wilhelm Dames, and Bronislav Petronievics. Much of this early study was relevant to controversy surrounding the possible taxonomic divisions of Archaeopteryx specimens.Wellnhofer (2009) p. 53-56 =Specimen= Paleontologist Richard Owen The London specimen is of obvious special importance because it was the first Archaeopteryx skeleton discovered. By coining the name Archaeopteryx, meaning \\"ancient wing\\", von Meyer had declared the animal to be a bird. Despite the feather's earlier discovery, von Meyer made the London fossil the type specimen of the genus (Archaeopteryx) and species (lithographica), establishing it as the exemplar of the species' features. Its discovery and subsequent descriptions, a mere handful of years after Darwin's On the Origin of Species, fulfilled the hope of a truly transitional form in its then-unique amalgamation of bird and reptilian characters.Shipman (1998) pp. 21–25 The specimen is preserved on two counter slabs broken originally into four pieces. The main, overlaying slab contains most of the skeletal elements, while only impressions and a few bone fragments are visible on the counter slab. This means the animal's carcass was pressed against the lagoon floor, representing the main slab. The main slab has a thickness of approximately 6 cm, and the case in which it's set measures a total of 60 x 40 cm.Wellnhofer (2009) p. 56 Taphonomy The London specimen shows the animal had undergone an advanced state of decomposition after death, reflected in its missing parts including a foot, some fingers, and the head. Both wings are preserved with spread fan-like with distinct feather impressions. The left hindlimb is preserved complete with four clawed toes; only the upper and lower portions of the right leg remain. The femur, pelvis, and remaining phalanges, while relatively complete, are disarticulated and scattered across the plate. Because of this scattering of the hand bones, Owen erroneously described the hands as two-fingers originally; the animal's three fingers were only known for certainty upon discovery of the Berlin specimen.Wellnhofer (2009) pp. 56–57 The London specimen's decomposition is estimated at being on the order of weeks, with a maximum \\"drifting time\\" estimated at 27 days. Weeks or months likely elapsed between time of deposition and burial. Skull While Owen essentially missed any signs of the presence of skull fragments, later researchers noticed the fragments but detailed study was made difficult by their being partially hidden within the stone. This resulted in reconstructions of the braincase as being narrower than was probably the case in life until recent decades. Though the specimen appears to be missing the head and was reported as such in the original description, fragments of the skull were isolated by further study in 1982, and a detailed reconstruction of the braincase was achieved a year later. Further studies conducted in the 1980s and '90s revealed that the braincase and ear region, while primitive, are essentially birdlike and similar in structure to that of modern birds. These analyses also further bolstered conclusions that the London specimen is likely to represent a juvenile individual. Remains of the London specimen's upper jaw are also preserved on the main slab nearby the femur, which includes at least one tooth still in its socket, analyses of which reveal similarity to the teeth of the Berlin specimen. While still other pieces of the skull lie nearby, they are generally fragmentary enough that little can be derived from them unequivocally.Wellnhofer (2009) p. 57 Trunk The vertebral column of the London specimen shows an incomplete cervical series, 22 articulated vertebrae above the tail, five or six sacrals, and 23 caudal vertebrae. The number of caudals is one greater than the Berlin and Eichstätt specimens and one more than the Munich specimen, which could be individual variability. Three left and six right dorsal ribs are preserved in rough articulation with the vertebrae. A number of gastralia are preserved scattered all over the plate. The scapula, coracoid and furcula are all preserved on the main slab. The coracoid is about a third the length of the scapula, and is much less elongated than in modern birds. This shortness originally led de Beer to include that short pectoral muscles of Archaeopteryx likely indicated it had very little flight ability. The furcula (wishbone) is well-preserved and lies between the scapulae; its boomerang-like shape reveals a 75-degree angle between its branches. De Beer identified a compressed mass of bone as a sternum in the London specimen, but later researchers disputed this as more likely to be a concretion of vertebrae encrusted by calcite. That Archaeopteryx lacked a bony sternum is in agreement with the modern consensus that many specimens of Archaeopteryx, including the London, likely represented immature animals whose sterna were still cartilaginous. The pelvic girdle is separated into its three components on the main slab.Wellnhofer (2009) p. 58 Owen's drawings of elements from the London specimen, including portion of the furculum (figure 1), impression of two primaries and four under-coverts (figure 7), and impressions of caudal plumes (figure 8) Limbs Both arms are preserved close to their natural articulation with the shoulder girdle, though displaced. The ulna is more robust and curved than the slender radius. A confusing jumble of metacarpals has led some researchers to conclude the beginning of fusion between carpals and metacarpals; this has been rejected by later researchers. Most manual bones of the right wing are missing, and the left wing preserves two metacarpals, the semilunate carpal, and two long, slender phalanges with large, strongly-curved claws. The missing third finger led Owen to conclude a two-fingered hand for Archaeopteryx in his original description. The left hindlimb is completely preserved on the main slab, and shows a slightly curved femur, a proximal muscle scar likely to represent the greater trochanter, a slender tibia and fibula, a remarkably birdlike tibiotarsus, and the four delicate toes of the foot. The right hindlimb shows only a disarticulated femur and tibia. The first toe is very short and includes a robust and strongly recurved claw that is oriented opposed to the other toes. While this conclusion would not necessarily be corroborated by subsequent specimens, the shape and position of the hallux led de Beer to conclude a perching, arboreal lifestyle for the animal. Plumage Flight feathers comprising primary remiges, secondary remiges, and tail rectrices are preserved on the London specimen, though no contour feathers are documented. The right wing shows better preservation than the left, though even here a precise arrangement of primaries and secondaries cannot be determined, instead appearing to emerge fan-like from a central area. The primaries and distal secondaries appear the same length, approximately 130 mm long. De Beer's original count of six primaries and ten secondaries is considerably less than the number documented in the later Berlin specimen. He also observed covert feathers above the base of the primaries, which show fine details of the barbs. He noted the similarity in shape and structure of these covert feathers to the original feather specimen described by von Meyer. The tail shows completely preserved rectrices along each side of the long, bony tail. They are paired, with one feather on each side of each vertebra from the sixth caudal onward to the tip. The proximal five pairs are 60 mm in length, and increase strongly in size until reaching a maximum length of 120 mm at the eleventh caudal; here they begin decreasing until a terminal length of 90 mm is reached at the tail tip.  The Berlin specimen  The Berlin specimen The Berlin Specimen (MB.Av.101) was discovered in 1874 or 1875 at the Blumenberg quarry near Eichstätt, Germany, by farmer Jakob Niemeyer, who reportedly sold the fossil for the money to buy a cow around a year later, to inn-keeper Johann Dörr, who again sold it to Ernst Otto Häberlein, the son of K. Häberlein. Placed on sale between 1877 and 1881, with potential buyers including O.C. Marsh of Yale University's Peabody Museum, it was eventually bought by the Natural History Museum of Berlin, where it is now displayed, for 20,000 Goldmark. The transaction was financed by Ernst Werner von Siemens, founder of the famous company that bears his name. Described in 1884 by Wilhelm Dames, it is the most complete specimen, and the first with a complete head. It was named in 1897 by Dames as a new species, A. siemensii; a 2002 evaluation supports the A. siemensii species identification.Elżanowski A. (2002): Archaeopterygidae (Upper Jurassic of Germany). In: Chiappe, L. M. & Witmer, L. M (eds.), Mesozoic Birds: Above the Heads of Dinosaurs: 129–159. University of California Press, Berkeley. = History =  Discovery and purchases  With the London specimen now owned by Great Britain, a second complete specimen, unearthed several years later, attracted a great deal of attention and subsequent conflict in Germany. After its private purchase by Häberlein, its first public mention was in the journal \\"Leopoldina\\", shortly followed by a blurb in the newspaper \\"Neues Jahrbuch\\", both in May 1877. In the \\"Neues\\" it appeared under the heading \\"Petrefaktenhandel\\" (\\"fossil trading\\"), where it was listed for sale by Häberlein—as a pterosaur—along with his collection of (actual) Solnhofen pterosaurs.Wellnhofer (2009) p. 60 A precise date for the specimen's original discovery is unknown, but is estimated at being sometime between as early as 1874 and autumn of 1876, shortly before its hand-off from Dörr to Häberlein. There is some conflict in reports of its year of discovery. Tischlinger (2005), for example, claims an 1874 or 1875 discovery for the fossil, some time before its purchase by Häberlein. Similarly, the fossil's original price is a matter of contradicting and speculative reports. Suggestions range from 140 marks, 1,400 marks, to 2,000 marks. Wellnhofer (2009) even mentions, based on a statement by quarry-owner Jakob Niemeyer's great-granddaughter, that only Häberlein knew the real value of the specimen and had purchased it pretending it was a pterosaur.Wellnhofer (2009) p. 60-61 1880 photo of the Berlin specimen, showing leg feathers that were removed subsequently, during preparation The original preparation of the specimen, exposing just part of the tail, was performed by Ernst Häberlein, who purchased it still mostly covered by matrix. This likely explains its misidentification as a pterosaur, despite its now-clear skeleton and feather impressions. After exposing these unique features, Häberlein first offered the specimen to the Bavarian State Paleontological Collection at a selling price of 15,000 guldens, equivalent to 25,710 marks. The State collection was unable to raise the money and the Bavarian parliament would not authorize the expenditure, despite the efforts of the then-acting director of the State collection, Karl Zittel, who passionately described the \\"faultless beauty\\" of the exposed tail alone. One of the first early offers for the fossil came from O. C. Marsh of the Yale Peabody Museum in America, who offered up 1,000 deutschemarks for the fossil. This offer was refused by Häberlein and was followed by a significant counteroffer of $10,000 by F. A. Schwartz of Nürnberg. There is no evidence that Marsh was interested in negotiating further, and historians speculate that this may be due to Marsh's suspecting the fossil might be a fraud, following claims of such in a Nürnberg newspaper.Shipman (1998) p. 42 At this point, Häberlein offered to sell the fossil to the British Museum of London through a letter addressed to Director of the Geology Department G. R. Waterhouse, who had negotiated with Häberlein's father for the first specimen. This time, however, Waterhouse delayed the potential transaction and sought to negotiate the price, likely due to the specimen's having not yet been fully prepared. Häberlein tried the following year to sell the specimen to King's College London at the price of 1,600 pounds—more than twice what his father had sold the first specimen for—with no success. Meanwhile, he continued to work at preparing the fossil, albeit \\"extremely erratically, crudely and amateurishly\\". By 1877 he had reassembled the negative impressions on the counter slab, revealing the whole skeleton and the plumage of its spread wings and tail on the main slab. Now that the completeness and beauty of the fossil was on full display, Häberlein began asking for 36,000 marks for its sale, a price unable to be raised by any museum in the world.Wellnhofer (2009) p. 60-62 Ernst Werner von Siemens, the famous industrialist who financed the transaction of the Berlin specimen As German representatives became increasingly desirous of the valuable fossil, intercessions with the German emperor as well as the king of Bavaria were attempted and ultimately failed. This failure incensed the professor of geology at the University of Geneva, Carl Vogt, who remarked that the emperor \\"would have agreed to an acquisition of the specimen, if it had been a cannon or a petrified gun\\". This statement was interpreted in Germany as a treasonous insult, especially given its subsequent publication in a French journal. At this point Häberlein was attempting to sell his fossil to museums in Munich, Berlin and Geneva; for this purpose he approached Vogt and reduced his price to 26,000 marks, a price still unaffordable by the Geneva museum.Wellnhofer (2009) p. 61-62 In 1880, Häberlein wrote to the Mineralogical Museum of the Friedrich-Wilhelms University in Berlin in another attempted sale, at the \\"greatly reduced price of 26,000 marks\\". Museum director Ernst Beyrich traveled to meet Häberlein and inspect the fossil in spring of March 1880. Despite his urgent recommendation for its acquisition, the requisite funds could not be produced. It was only through the intervention of renowned German industrialist Werner von Siemens, founder of the Siemens engineering company, that the specimen was finally acquired for the Berlin museum. Von Siemens, who learned of the specimen and its problems reaching a sale through museum curator Wilhelm Dames, proposed to simply buy the fossil himself and then permit the fossil to enter custody of the paleontological collection of Friedrich Wilhelm University (the Berlin University, which in the present day is named \\"Humboldt University of Berlin\\" since 1949). After several years of tension, the fossil was finally reclaimed by Germany for a sum of 20,000 marks in April 1880, whereby von Siemens made it immediately available for research by the Mineralogical Museum of Berlin. Historical reviews University of Geneva geology professor Carl Vogt was the first individual to express interest in committing the specimen to scientific study. His original attempts, however, were committed before the specimen had been secured by a scientific institution and was still in the possession of physician Karl Häberlein. While Häberlein struggled to sell the specimen, Vogt endeavored to examine and publish a scientific study on the specimen, despite Häberlein's agreement to not allow anyone to produce a cast, duplication, drawing or photograph of the fossil. Vogt nevertheless published a photograph of the specimen entrusted to him by Häberlein in the Berlin journal \\"Naturforscher\\" in September 1879, the first published photo of the fossil. He later published on the specimen in several papers in Germany, Switzerland, England and France, as well as presenting the specimen at a Swiss naturalist meeting in 1879. Prof. Wilhelm Barnim Dames Despite the shortcomings of these early attempts, Vogt was notable in that his passionate defense of evolutionary theory, much in line with Thomas Huxley's earlier predictions about dinosaurs and birds, was largely on the mark with respect to Archaeopteryx's role in the evolution of birds. Working from the Berlin specimen, Vogt described the genus as a \\"flying reptile furnished with bird's feathers\\" and neither a bird nor a reptile, but an \\"intermediate link between both.\\"Wellnhofer (2009) p. 63 Nevertheless, he also incorrectly predicted Aves as a paraphyletic taxon in which ratites evolved from dinosaurs and flying birds from Archaeopteryx. Many of these early conclusions were refuted by London paleontologist Harry Govier Seeley in 1881, who believed the animal to be a true bird. Seeley also originally posited that the Berlin specimen may represent a separate species from the London specimen, based on a comparison of skeletal measurements between the two. Famous paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh of Yale had the opportunity to study both the London and Berlin specimens in 1881. He described his findings in a meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in York, England, where he reported previously unnoticed features of the fossils including real teeth. Marsh, like Seeley, defended the animal as representing a real bird, albeit the most reptilian one known. Geologist John Evans also studied the fossil in 1881, and observed that the feathers on the hind limbs of the animal appear to have the same structure as those on the wings and may have acted as lifting structures in flight. This idea later formed the basis for American zoologist William Beebe's prediction that a four-winged ancestor played a pivotal role in avian evolution. Museum curator Wilhelm Dames was responsible for the first full scientific description of the Berlin specimen. Prior to this substantial monograph of 1884, Dames had already published a few shorter articles about the skull morphology while it was still partially covered by matrix. Now that the specimen was under his control and full exposed, his subsequent study and monograph was the first comprehensive description of an Archaeopteryx specimen that had not been disarticulated. =Specimen= The Berlin specimen of Archaeopteryx is to date the most complete existing specimen of this genus, and is widely regarded as one of the most beautiful fossils in the world.Shipman (1998) p. 13-14 Its well-preserved skeleton and the preserved feathers of its wings and tail have made it of considerable interest to a wide range of scientific study, beginning with Wilhelm Dames and Carl Vogt shortly following its discovery. This iconic fossil preserves the animal with an articulated skeleton, complete skull and lower jaw, and spread wings with excellently-preserved feather imprints. The three fingers of each hand are displayed with each claw oriented to the front, and the hind limbs are positioned to one side as though running. The bony tail is long, serially feathered, and slightly bent behind the pelvis. The main slab measures 46 cm by 38 cm and was broken into two unequal parts (visible today by a long crack). Due to Ernst Häberlein's inexpert attempts at mounting, the counter slab is relatively incomplete and shows only the negative molds of the bones and feather imprints. Taphonomy As is common among Solnhofen vertebrates, the neck and head of the Berlin specimen are highly recurved. The shoulder girdle has been displaced from the backbone by about 4 cm; this gives the specimen the illusion of having lower wings than it likely did in life. The natural articulation of humerus with the girdle's glenoid cavity reveals the wings of the living animal as having a more dorsal position. Researchers believed the animal likely died by drowning in a Jurassic Solnhofen lake, floated on the surface for some time, and then sunk to the lagoon floor where it was deposited in calcium-rich mud. The specimen's exquisite preservation suggests a relatively short time in the lake before being deposited, perhaps on the order of hours or days. Skull Detail of skull While the London specimen included only a few fragments of the brain case and upper jaw, the Berlin specimen of Archaeopteryx has what appears at first glance to be an almost perfectly preserved skull. Closer inspection reveals the skull, while remarkable, to have considerable damage and defects, including compression and damage to the occipital region, which is partly missing. The mandible is so tightly pressed against the upper jaw that part of it is obscured by overlapping. The orbital (eye socket) has a diameter of 14 mm and includes a preserved sclerotic ring composed of 12 overlapping elements. Many smaller elements of the skull are distorted and their exact shape, position and size have historically been a matter of some debate. However, new techniques in ultraviolet imaging have revealed a more definitive nature of the skull's morphology. Dentition analysis of the specimen shows twelve teeth on each half of the upper tooth row, likely four in the premaxillary and eight in the maxillary. The rostral teeth (near the tip) are longest and descend slightly in size towards the rear. Dames (1884) described the tooth shape as \\"cylindrical\\"; other authors have described their shape as peg-like, with curved tip and generally slender, having a smooth enameled surface and mostly oriented upright in the jaw. A slight constriction, or \\"waist\\", is visible about halfway between the root and the crown tip.Wellnhofer (2009) p. 68 Trunk Below the skull, the fossil shows a remarkable degree of articulation. The cervical vertebrae, for example, are all but one preserved in their natural pose. Analysis of these vertebrae led Dames to estimate a neck length of 60.5 mm. Later researchers postulated an additional vertebra and a slightly different measurement. This discrepancy is based on differing interpretations of the first two cervical vertebrae. Britt et al. (1998) observed lateral openings in these neck vertebrae and interpreted them as pneumatic foramina, suggesting a modern air sac system. The first eleven or twelve dorsal vertebrae bear ribs and these have a length between 5.5 and 7 mm with large neural spines. A sacral length of around 6.5 is deduced. Dames observed 20 caudal vertebrae; Wellnhofer posits 21.Wellnhofer (2009) p. 70 Dames also noted the similarity in the long, rod-like structures of the tail to those in the flying pterosaur Rhamphorhynchus, considering them to be ossified tendons. Thin, pointed cervical ribs begin at the third vertebra. The longest are about 50 mm and total eleven in number. Gastralia, or belly ribs, are arranged in 10 parallel rows and their position is suggested as evidence of post-mortem shrinking of the body. The scapulae are separated by about 17 mm and are flattened, narrow, and positioned much in their natural position. The coracoid, which comprises the other half of the pectoral girdle, is only well-preserved on the left side but shows a flattened, rectangular structure. Small fragments of the furcula are also identified, and as in other Archaeopteryx specimens this is a single boomerang-shaped structure. Some controversy surrounded the sternum when first described. Dames (1897) first identified the triangular structure and Petronievics (1925) later attempted to reconstruct it as being keeled. The sternum identified in the London specimen, by contrast, appeared unkeeled and this discrepancy led Petronievics to classify the Berlin specimen as a different genus, Archaeornis. American paleontologist John Ostrom later identified the structure as part of the right coracoid based on X-ray photographs of this specimen. This claim was examined via UV technology and later rejected by Wellnhofer (1993) and Tischlinger & Unwin (2004), who reclassified it as part of the sternum, albeit minimally ossified (mostly cartilagenous). This supports the idea that the Berlin Archaeopteryx was not a full-grown individual at the time of its death, and instead represents an immature animal. The pelvis of the Berlin specimen was considered by Dames to be markedly different from that of the London specimen, which was a major point in favor of his assigning a new species to the Berlin Archaeopteryx, siemensii, after its generous donor. Other researchers, however, disputed this difference, claiming it could be entirely accounted for by deformation of the specimens during preservation. Therefore, the Berlin specimen had at one point researchers arguing for both a separate genus and species name; Petronievics (1921) erected the genus Archaeornis and supported the claim that \\"Archaeornis siemensii\\" entirely lacked a pubic symphysis. De Beer continued to object that these differences were preservational, and that both specimens, while differing in size, possessed identical morphology, a conclusion generally accepted by later paleontologists.Wellnhofer (2009) p. 70-71 Limbs Detail of feet The forelimbs of the Berlin specimen are among the best-preserved elements of the skeleton. Both arms are spread in dorsal view, still articulated with the shoulder socket. The articulated elbow joins upper and upper arm at a 45-degree angle; the wrist joins lower arm and manus at a 100-degree angle. While this element confused Dames originally, Petronievics eventually identified a large distal and smaller proximal carpal bone, which Danish paleontologist Gerhard Heilmann identified as a single fused bone. Today we recognize this bone as the semilunate carpal, after its half-moon shape. The hands of the Berlin specimen are beautifully preserved, and in contrast to the London specimen definitively showed the hands as three- fingered, rather than two-fingered. Though in close contact and oriented parallel to one another, the fingers are not fused as in modern birds. The first digit of the hand is the shortest, the second is the longest, and the third intermediate. The first digit appeared to be more mobile than the others. The position of the third digit, which overlapped with the second on both forelimbs, is likely to be a post-mortem displacement. The total length of the Berlin specimen forelimb is about 20 cm long, just over half the length of the entire nose-to-tail measurement of the animal.Shipman (1998) p. 200 Unlike the forelimbs, both hind limbs are preserved on the right side of the animal, reflecting a torsion of the animal's body upon preservation. The left femur is mostly hidden beneath the pelvis. Two muscle scars are visible on the femur, which John Ostrom compared to the trochanter major of modern birds as well as to theropod dinosaurs. The tibia is slender and straight, considerably longer than the femur, and has a longitudinal ridge where it contacts the fibula. The tarsals are relatively poorly-preserved. The four-toed feet show a short, forward-pointing first digit and the curvature of the pedal claws is smaller than in the manual claws, though with larger flexor tubercles. The entire foot measures at about 75 mm in length. These hindlimb proportions agree roughly with those of the London specimen.Wellnhofer (2009) p. 72-72 The claw arc of the central pedal digit is about 120 degrees, which is close to the average for all Archaeopteryx specimens. This arc is also close to the average for that in perching birds and is well above the mean for ground- dwelling birds, despite conclusions against perching habits based on the short hallux and weak flexor tubercles.Shipman (1998) p. 161 Plumage Detail of arm, hand and plumage The remarkably preserved plumage is one of many features that sets the Berlin specimen head-and-coracoids above all other Archaeopteryx fossils to date. Clear feather impressions are visible on both wings, the tail, the lower legs, and the base of the neck. The feathers are likely to be preserved as molds and casts, rather than as imprints alone. Their preservation is unique: dubbed \\"relief-pseudomorphosis\\", the wings show the ventral surface of the feathers, with their negative mold on the main slab and their positive cast on the counter slab. This means the animal likely died on its back, showing the underside of its wings in preservation. As in birds, the primary remiges attach to the second digit of the manus at metacarpal II and phalanges. The secondary remiges are less distinctly preserved, attaching to the lower arm (ulna). Both sets of flight feathers are overlapping by extensive coverts. Some disagreement exists over the interpretation of the flight feathers, with some researchers claiming eleven primaries and others twelve. The distal primaries are asymmetrical, though the degree cannot be accurately measured due to overlapping, and range in length from 140 mm to 55 mm. The feather preservation of rectrices along the long, bony tail is similar to that of the wings. These dorsoventral-oriented feathers have clearly defined barbs and comprise at least six pairs of short (45 mm) feathers to the proximal postsacral vertebrae, and another ten or eleven pairs of tail feathers with lengths up to 87 mm, which decrease in length up to the terminal vertebra. The body feathers are described as being present at the base of the neck, on the back, and on the hind legs. The tibiotarsal feathers have been interpreted as similar to the feather \\"breeches\\" of birds of prey, and appeared at lengths from 25 mm up to 30–40 mm.  The Maxberg specimen  Composed of a torso, the Maxberg specimen (S5) was discovered in 1956 near Langenaltheim; it was brought to the attention of professor Florian Heller in 1958 and described by him in 1959. It is currently missing, though it was once exhibited at the Maxberg Museum in Solnhofen. It belonged to Eduard Opitsch, who loaned it to the museum until 1974. After his death in 1991, the specimen was discovered to be missing and may have been stolen or sold. The specimen is missing its head and tail, although the rest of the skeleton is mostly intact.Sammler und Forscher - ein schwieriges Verhältnis Sueddeutsche Zeitung - Collectors and scientists, a difficult relationship, published: 25 October 2009, accessed: 1 March 2011 It takes its name from the Maxberg Museum, where it was exhibited for a number of years.Archaeopteryx www.fossilien- solnhofen.de, accessed: 1 March 2011 The Archaeopteryx specimen is, as of 2011, one of only 11 body fossils ever found,Stelldichein der Urvögel Sueddeutsche Zeitung - Meeting of the Urvogel, published: 25 October 2009, accessed: 1 March 2011 but has been missing since the death of its last known owner, Eduard Opitsch, in 1991. It is conventionally referred to as the third specimen. = History =  Discovery and the first owner  Cast of the Maxberg Specimen The Maxberg specimen was discovered in 1956 by two workers, Ernst Fleisch and Karl Hinterholzinger, in a quarry between Solnhofen and Langenaltheim, Bavaria, eight decades after the previous discovery in 1874/1875, the Berlin specimen.Dingus, Rowe, 119 The workers however did not recognise the significance of the find, mistaking it for an unimportant crayfish, Mecochirus longimanatus, and the pieces remained stored in a hut for the following two years. In 1958, Eduard Opitsch, owner of the quarry, allowed the fossil to be taken away by visiting geologist Klaus Fesefeldt who believed it was some vertebrate and sent it to the University of Erlangen where paleontologist Professor Florian Heller identified it correctly and further prepared it. Opitsch, described by contemporaries as having had a difficult personality, attempted to sell the specimen to the highest bidder remarking: \\"if such things are found only once every hundred years, nothing will be given away for free\\". The Freie Universität Berlin offered 30,000 Deutschmark; in response the Bavarian institutions tried to preserve the specimen for their own Bundesland by outbidding them. In negotiations with Princess Therese zu Oettingen-Spielberg of the Bayerische Staatssamlung für Paläontologie und Geologie Opitsch, though never demanding an exact amount, had already vaguely indicated a price of about 40,000 DM. The BSP was willing to pay this but hesitant to compensate for the fact that any sum would be taxed at 40% as company profits. The tax collectors did not allow an exemption to be made for this special case. As a result, an irritated Opitsch in August 1965 suddenly broke off negotiations and declined all further offers.  Display and withdrawal  For a number of years, the find was displayed at the local Maxberg Museum. In 1974 Opitsch allowed high-quality casts to be made on the occasion of an exhibition by the Senckenberg Museum dedicated to Archaeopteryx, but immediately afterwards he removed it from public display altogether. Instead, he stored it in his private residence in nearby Pappenheim declining access to the specimen to all scientists. He rejected a proposal to further prepare the slabs. Opitsch had become more defensive about the fossil after an announcement of another specimen in 1973. This was the Eichstätt specimen, which was much more complete and also transpired to have already been discovered in 1951, five years before the Maxberg. He felt that the large attention for this new specimen was intended to deprecate his own. Attempts were made to gain permission to show the specimen in exhibitions, but Opitsch always refused the requests. In 1984 Peter Wellnhofer, a renowned expert on Archaeopteryx, attempted to gather together all specimens and experts on the subject in Eichstätt but Opitsch ignored his request and the conference proceeded without the Maxberg specimenDingus, Rowe, 121 — the London and Berlin specimens however were absent too, the former because seen as too valuable by the British Museum of Natural History, the latter as it was about to be displayed in a surprise exhibition in Tokyo, together with a visit of the Berlin Brachiosaurus to Japan.  Disappearance  When Eduard Opitsch died in February 1991, the Maxberg specimen was not found in his house by his only heir, a nephew entering the building a few weeks after the death of his uncle who was the sole inhabitant. Witnesses claim to have seen the specimen stored under his bed shortly before he died. Opitsch's marble headstone at the cemetery of Langenaltheim depicts a gilded engraving modelled after the specimen, which led to the rumour that he had taken it to his grave. Another theory is that the specimen was sold secretly.All About Archaeopteryx talk.origins, accessed: 1 March 2011 The case of the lost specimen was even investigated by the Bavarian police after the heir reported it stolen in July 1991, but no further evidence of its whereabouts was found. Raimund Albersdörfer, a German fossil dealer who was involved in the 2009 purchase of the long-missing Daiting Specimen, believes, as do others, that the specimen is not lost but rather in private possession and will resurface eventually. As a result of all this, the specimen has no official inventory number. The disappearance of the Maxberg specimen has led to renewed calls to protect fossil finds by law. The laws in this regard would be a matter of the federal states in Germany. Bavaria, to this date, is the only Bundesland having no laws protecting such finds. However, the federal government has declared the Maxberg specimen a national cultural heritage, national wertvolles Kulturgut, in 1995, meaning it cannot be exported without permission. In 2009, the value of a high-quality Archaeopteryx specimen was estimated to be in excess of three million Euro. = Specimen = The Maxberg specimen, like all Archaeopteryx exemplars except the so-called \\"Daiting\\", shows body feathers.Four-winged birds may have been first fliers New Scientist, published: 23 May 2004, accessed: 1 March 2011 The specimen was formally described in 1959 by Florian Heller. Heller had roentgen and UV-pictures made by the photographic institute of Wilhelm Stürmer. The specimen consists of a slab and counterslab, mainly showing a torso with some feather impressions, lacking both head and tail.Archaeopteryx www.stonecompany.com, accessed: 1 March 2011 The roentgen pictures proved that parts of the skeleton still remained hidden inside the stone. Prior to its disappearance, several researchers had the opportunity to study the fossil including John Ostrom and Peter Wellnhofer. At this time, it was determined that further professional preparation of the fossil—which was still largely obscured by matrix—would expose a much greater extent of the skeleton to make available for research. Unfortunately, this was disallowed by Opitsch. To this day, any further research on the specimen must necessarily be conducted through a small number of relatively precise casts, photographs and X-ray images of both fossil slabs, which had been fortuitously made before its disappearance.Wellnhofer (2009) p. 81 Taphonomy The Maxberg specimen shows the greatest extent of disintegration among the Archaeopteryx body fossils, exemplified by its loss of skull, cervicals and parts of the hindlimb, indicating an extended period of transport before deposition on the lagoon floor. Both arms are preserved flexed unnaturally under one another, and the decayed rib cage had been separated and jumbled across the body. Apart from a large section of the vertebral column, most other elements of the skeleton were disarticulated upon preservation.Wellnhofer (2009) p. 80 It was determined by a geologist that the quarry that produced the Maxberg specimen had also produced the London specimen, which was found almost one hundred years earlier, in 1861. However, the Maxberg example was found almost seven metres lower than the London one. Skeleton The vertebral column, parts of which are among the only articulated elements of the skeleton, is nevertheless too incompletely preserved for an exact vertebrae number to be estimated. Its original describer, Florian Heller, counted seven cervicals and five presumably fused sacrals. The left scapula, while badly damaged proximally, is in good condition distally; the right scapula is partly articulated with the coracoid at an almost right angle. The furcula is relatively well preserved, sitting close to its natural position and showing typical boomerang shape.Wellnhofer (2009) p. 81-82 All three components of the pelvic girdle—illium, ischium and publs—are somewhat articulated in almost natural position. Both forelimbs, though disarticulated, are mostly complete, including a completely exposed right humerus. The slightly curved ulna, like all Archaeopteryx specimens, lacks quill knobs in contrast to modern birds. No carpus elements are present, but the right manus is fairly well preserved and all three digits of the hand are separated and independent. All three fingers bear robust, strongly curved claws with well-developed flexor tubercles. An isolated horn sheath, indicating the keratinous outer surface of the claw in life, lies near the second finger of the left manus.Wellnhofer (2009) p. 82 The left hindlimb is well preserved, and shows a femur, tibia with fibula, and vague foot skeleton; the right hindlimb preserves only an isolated tibia. Both hindlimbs are disarticulated from the pelvis. An isolated foot skeleton lies on the counter slab, probably the left. This shows the three unfused center metatarsals (II, III, and IV) lying in parallel, as well as initial fusion between tarsal and metatarsals. As in other specimens, this supports an incipient tarsometatarsus in Archaeopteryx, approaching the fully fused condition in modern birds.Wellnhofer (2009) p. 83 Plumage The Maxberg specimen preserves feather imprints covered by a thin sedimentary layer that obscures many fine details of the feathers. This may be a consequence of decay and disintegration on the lagoon floor. In the few feathers where detailed morphology can be observed, their structure appears identical to the plumage of other Archaeopteryx specimens. The left wing preserves the better plumage and shows flight feathers firmly connected to the arms. Though the wings overlap each other enough that assigning feather attachment points to individual bone regions is not possible, it does appear, consistent with other specimens and modern relatives, that the long primary feathers are attached to the second manual digit. The feathers of the right wing are considerably more damaged; so many feathers are missing that only a few can be definitively linked to the ulna, designating them as secondary remiges. One small feather is isolated next to the right humerus, suggesting that the animal's feathers had fallen out prior to or shortly after decomposition. Numerous small feathers proposed to be coverts are observed next to the second metacarpal and the phalanges, partly overlapping the shafts of the flight feathers. Feather \\"breeches\\", similar to those observed in the Berlin specimen, are found around the tibial region.Wellnhofer (2009) p. 84  The Haarlem specimen  Slab of the Haarlem Specimen The Haarlem Specimen (TM 6428/29, also known as the Teyler Specimen) was discovered in 1855 near Riedenburg, Germany and described as a Pterodactylus crassipes in 1857 by von Meyer. It was reclassified in 1970 by John Ostrom and is currently located at the Teylers Museum in Haarlem, the Netherlands. It was the very first specimen, despite the classification error. It is also one of the least complete specimens, consisting mostly of limb bones and isolated cervical vertebrae and ribs.Wellnhofer (2009) p. 85 In 2017, paleontologists Christian Foth and Oliver Rauhut concluded that the specimen represented an animal more closely related to the Chinese Anchiornis and introduced the generic name Ostromia. = History = The commonly-used names of this specimen come from the old Dutch city of Haarlem, as well as from the city's Teyler Museum, named for its founder Pieter Teyler van der Hulst. In the 19th century the museum acquired a huge number of fossils from Solnhofen, and between 1863 and 1868 it listed over 12,000 fossils in its paleontological collection. In March 1860, a seemingly unremarkable vertebrate fossil from Riedenburg, Bavaria, was purchased from von Meyer by the then- director of the Teyler Museum, Jacob Gijsbertus Samuël van Breda (Winkler 1865). This piece had been described in 1857 as belonging to the pterosaur Pterodactylus crassipes by H. v. Meyer (v. Meyer 1857), and the Teyler Museum displayed it as such for over a century. In October 1966, Peter Wellnhofer visited the Teyler Museum to examine its collection of Solnhofen pterosaurs, disputing its assignment to P. crassipes. However, it was not until 8 September 1970 that the fossil was finally recognized as belonging to Archaeopteryx by John Ostrom, who was also at the time engaged in studying Solnhofen pterosaurs and was suspicious of the species assignment of this pterosaur. His reclassification of von Meyer's P. crassipes type specimen as an Archaeopteryx was published in Science in 1970 (Ostrom 1970), with a more thorough investigation of the specimen two years later in the Proceedings of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Sciences (Ostrom 1972b). In this way, the so- called fourth specimen of Archaeopteryx, preceded in the literature by the London, Berlin and Maxberg specimens, was in reality the first, discovered as it was originally in 1855—five years before the feather that would ultimately reveal the existence of avians in the Jurassic.Wellnhofer (2009) p. 86 = Specimen = Opposite slab of the Haarlem specimen Both slabs of the specimen display bone material and faint feather impressions, and together preserve the parts of the dorsal vertebrae and gastralia, a number of bones of the arms and especially the hand with all three fingers well-preserved, a small piece of the pelvic girdle, and substantial parts of both legs, most notably the feet which are also reasonably well-preserved, particularly the phalanges and metatarsus of the left foot. All pieces remain in original articulation and both slabs show relatively little decay.Wellnhofer (2009) p. 87  Skeleton  While not one of the best-preserved Archaeopteryx fossils, a few of its skeletal elements are noteworthy. Its gastralia are exceptionally-well preserved, and the counter slab shows at least 14 of the slender, rib-shaped bones. Faint imprints of several dorsal vertebrae are also observed, and four actual rib fragments in articulation with the vertebrae. A single pelvic bone is preserved, the pubis, and displays the boot-shaped pubic symphysis.Wellnhofer (2009) p. 88-89 The main slab preserves a significant portion of the left leg. Pieces of both femora remain, and a large part of the left femur is preserved in natural articulation at the knee with the lower leg, which preserves only the left tibia in proximal. The left fibula is preserved on the main slab, but the distal elements of the lower leg are broken off at the slab edge. The left metartarsus and foot are preserved only as faint impressions, but these are distinct enough to derive the pedal phalange formula 2-3-4-5-0 that is typical for the genus (Ostrom 1972b) The claw impressions are also relatively distinct and allow for comparison with the forelimb claws.Wellnhofer (2009) p. 88 The forelimb preserves parts of the wing skeleton on the main slab, which displays the distal left humerus and both forearm bones. A bone that has been interpreted as a semilunate carpal may lie between the forearm and second metacarpal, but this remains inconclusive. The hand is fairly well-preserved and the first finger especially preserves the claw at its tip most exceptionally. This claw has a strong curvature, sharply pointed, has deep lateral furrows, and a stout tubercle at the base. The imprint of the horn sheath also remains, which shows a rounded thickening of the claw that tapers to a very sharp point. While otherwise not an exceptional specimen in many respects, the details of the hand provided previously-unknown details of the animal's claw morphology. Apart from the plumage, it was many elements of the forearm preservation that allowed Ostrom to make the Archaeopteryx determination. For example, the narrow gap between radius and ulna, which is clearly observed in the Haarlem specimen, is a feature not known in pterosaurs (Ostrom 1972b). = Plumage = Although the specimen preserves faint plumage impressions, it is understandable why they escaped v. Meyer's notice in 1857—such structures as feathers were unknown from the Late Jurassic before 1860–61. Only in oblique light do the Haarlem specimen's feather imprints show up at all, and these originate from the left forearm, and therefore likely the imprints of the animal's secondary remiges. Some researchers have speculated at some obscure impressions on the specimen belonging to the primary feathers, but this has not been determined with certainty.Wellnhofer (2009) p. 89  The Eichstätt specimen  Slabs of the Eichstätt specimen The Eichstätt Specimen (JM 2257) was discovered in 1951 near Workerszell, Germany and described by Peter Wellnhofer in 1974. Currently located at the Jura Museum in Eichstätt, Germany, it is the smallest specimen and has the second best head. It is possibly a separate genus (Jurapteryx recurva) or species (A. recurva).Wellnhofer (2009) p. 90 = History = More than 20 years passed between the discovery of the Eichstätt specimen and its description and publication in 1973. The most likely reason for this discrepancy can be traced to the preliminary description of the specimen by Franz Xaver Mayer, a German collector of Plattenkalk fossils and professor of several disciplines. In 1973, he wrote that he came into possession of the fossil after a series of extremely intricate and protracted negotiations with Xaver Frey of Workerszell, who owned the fossil prior to Mayer's bringing it to the Jura Museum in the Willibaldsburg. Wellnhofer later reconstructed the probable course of events. Xaver Frey had in 1951 offered the piece for sale as a pterosaur specimen. Mayer, a priest and conservator of the fossil collection of the Eichstätt seminary, had at first identified it as a rare Compsognathus exemplar, buying the fossil at an elevated price. On further preparation however, he discovered that it was a priceless Archaeopteryx specimen. Although the sale was in principle valid despite the error, as a priest Mayer felt a moral obligation to allow Frey to rescind on the deal. But Mayer knew that his institute could never afford to acquire such an expensive object and he feared it would be lost to science. Unable to solve this moral dilemma, he stored the specimen in his safe. In 1965, Frey had deceased. In 1972, Mayer, himself already eighty-four years old, on the occasion of the opening of a new Eichstätt natural history museum, invited Peter Wellnhofer to examine the specimen and publish a scientific analysis. Frey's heirs were financially compensated. The specimen was displayed for a time at the Frankfurt Senckenberg Museum, and in 1974 both slabs were transferred to the newly opened Jura Museum in Eichstätt, where it remains.Wellnhofer (2009) p. 91  Investigation and Analyses  Close up of a slab The first documented preparation of the specimen was carried out in 1972 (Tischlinger 1973), and further studies were conducted under the supervision of Wellnhofer at Munich's Paleontological State Collection in 1973, and of the skull by the Jura- Museum's preparator, Pino Völkl, in 1989 (Völkl 1989). X-ray photographs were additionally taken prior to any public announcement of the specimen, including some which involved innovative methods of image processing (Stürmer 1983). Some of these were later built upon by Johannes Mehl in his subsequent analyses of the fossil, including by stereo images, ultraviolet light, and other techniques (Mehl 1998, Vieser 1988). = Specimen = The Eichstätt specimen of Archaeopteryx is represented by an almost-complete skeleton visible on both slab and counter-slab, though the majority of the skeleton is on the main (overlying) slab. The animal is preserved lying on its right side, as in the Berlin specimen. The specimen is in almost complete articulation with many items in their original positions. The vertebral column, which had become strongly recurved in death, enabled the animal's head to lie above the pelvis in near-perfect preservation. This excellently-preserved skull is one of the most notable features of this specimen.Wellnhofer (2009) pp. 90–91 Skeleton The majority of the Eichstätt specimen's noteworthy status comes from its beautifully preserved skull, which has been analyzed in depth by Wellnofer (1974) and later by Elzanowski & Wellnhofer (1996). The skull is laterally compressed but single bones are nonetheless distinguishable. Among other things the skull presents evidence of a certain extent of cranial kineses by way of a preserving an articular surface on the ventral side, showing that sliding movements were possible between the lacrymal and jugal.  The Solnhofen specimen  The Solnhofen specimen The Solnhofen Specimen, inventory number BMM 500, was probably discovered in the 1970s near Eichstätt, Germany and described in 1988 by Wellnhofer. Currently located at the Bürgermeister-Müller-Museum in Solnhofen, it was originally classified as Compsognathus by an amateur collector, the same burgomaster Friedrich Müller after which the museum is named. Müller acquired it in a completely unprepared state from some anonymous fossil dealer. It is the largest specimen known and may belong to a separate genus and species, Wellnhoferia grandis. It is missing only portions of the neck, tail, backbone, and head.Wellnhofer (2009) p. 98 =History= The Solnhofen specimen was originally thought to be a Compsognathus by Friedrich Müller, the former Bürgermeister of Solnhofen whose private collection it resided in until it was examined on 11 November 1987 by Peter Wellnhofer and Günter Viohl, the then-Director of the Jura Museum, during an appraisal of the collection, about to be sold to the Bürgermeister- Müller-Museum. Mr. Müller had already prepared the fossil, and granted permission to Wellnhofer for the study and publication of the new specimen. The fossil was transferred to Munich in 1987 and then officially introduced to the public at a Solnhofen press conference on 14 July 1988. The Solnhofen specimen became the center of an ownership litigation issue in the fall of 1988, when an Eichstätt quarry owner, Franz Xaver Schöpfel, claimed that the specimen had in fact in 1985 been found by one of his workers in the Wintershof area of the quarry. The fossil was then, Schöpfel claimed, sold by the worker to the private collector instead of respecting his ownership. As such, Schöpfel charged two of his workmen with embezzlement, as well as Mr. Müller as a fencer. After being delayed until 1994, the case was finally thrown out for lack of evidence, analysis of the stone structure of the piece showing that it differed from the Wintershof layers. However, in 1995 the plaintiff then sued the community of Solnhofen to recover the fossil, presenting testimony from private collectors claiming to have been offered the specimen, and eventually the Landgericht Ansbach (a \\"District Court\\") ordered the specimen returned in 1998. The community of Solnhofen objected to this decision and the case went to the Oberlandesgericht Nürnberg (the Superior District Court of Bavaria) in 2001, where it was overturned in favor of the community. This in turn was objected to by the quarry owner, who brought the case to the highest level of the Federal Court of Justice in Karlsruhe, which upheld the Superior District Court's decision in 2003, bringing a 14-year lawsuit to a close and earning the sixth Archaeopteryx specimen its name of Solnhofen. =Specimen= The Solnhofen specimen represents the largest Archaeopteryx individual known. It is represented by a nearly-complete skeleton on a plate sized 39 x 52 cm. There is no counterslab associated with this specimen. The skeleton shows a death posture typical of theropods and especially similar to that of the Eichstätt specimen. The animal's carcass was likely deposited and buried completely articulated. Despite the specimen's skeletal completion, plumage traces are very faint and scarce on the fossil. Some suggestions of slightly curved, parallel structures lie between the left lower arm and the right upper leg, likely to represent the secondary feathers of the left wing.Wellnhofer (2009) p. 99 The specimen's skull is discernible only from the anterior portion and several pieces of the mandible; the rest seems to be missing, crushed or fragmented. Four premaxillary and seven maxillary teeth are preserved. Only a few remains of cervical and dorsal vertebrae are preserved, though the last four dorsals remain articulated and fifteen caudals are present, suggesting a significantly missing tail tip (the London specimen, by contrast, had 23 caudals); this missing tip had by Müller been incorrectly restored on the slab. Elongated, rod-like structures along the tail from the fifth caudal onward suggest a stiff tail that was chiefly flexible at the base. Ten pairs of dorsal ribs are preserved, and like previous specimens lack uncinate processes. An unfused scapula and coracoid remain in close contact, and the presence of a furcula, contrasted against the lack thereof in smaller specimens, suggests that ossification of this bone is age-related. Both wings are naturally articulated, with only the wrist area of both hands missing. The three digits of the right hand are positioned similarly to the Berlin, Eichstätt and Maxberg specimens, with the third digit crossing underneath the second—a condition suggested by Kemp & Unwin (1997) to reflect post-mortem displacement. The legs are similarly well-articulated, robust, and arranged similarly to those of the Munich specimen. The toes of the right foot are completely preserved, and the aberrant phalangeal formula reads 2-3-4-4-0 rather than 2-3-4-5-0 as in other specimens. The reason for this discrepancy is not known, and cannot be checked against the left foot, which is missing critical elements. Suggestions include an aberrant anomaly (Wellnhofer 1988b, 1992a) or a taxonomically significant character (Elzanowski (2001b).Wellnhofer (2009) pp. 102–103  The Munich specimen  The Munich specimen The Munich Specimen (BSP 1999 I 50, formerly known as the Solenhofer- Aktien-Verein Specimen) was discovered on 3 August 1992 near Langenaltheim and described in 1993 by Wellnhofer. It is currently located at the Paläontologisches Museum München in Munich, to which it was sold in 1999 for 1.9 million Deutschmark. What was initially believed to be a bony sternum turned out to be part of the coracoid,Wellnhofer, P. & Tischlinger, H. (2004). Das \\"Brustbein\\" von Archaeopteryx bavarica Wellnhofer 1993 - eine Revision. Archaeopteryx. 22: 3–15. [Article in German] but a cartilaginous sternum may have been present. Only the front of its face is missing. It may be a new species, A. bavarica. =History= In August 1992, this specimen was unearthed piecemeal in the limestone quarries of Langenaltheim by Jürgen Hüttinger, who was working in the quarry under the auspices of the stone company Solenhofer Aktien-Verein. Hüttinger first found a small fragment of stone showing a few fossil bones, and was able to collect all fragments of the layer and fit them together like a puzzle. He was initially under the impression it was a pterosaur until noticing a few traces of feather imprints on the surface of the collected fragments.Wellnhofer (2009) pp. 104 The quarryman honestly informed the director of the quarry, who legally owned any finds by worker, and the next day Wellnhofer was called on to come examine the fossil and was asked to take over the scientific study of the new specimen. It was prepared in Munich by Wellnhofer's skilled preparator, Ernst Schmieja, in the Paleontological State Collection labs. When preparation of the fossil was completed in December of that year, Schmieja realized that only the tip of one wing was missing from the assembled stone fragments, and a frantic search amongst the half metric ton of saved slabs collected from the same layer finally revealed the missing fragment, to be placed as the final piece to complete the puzzle. This seventh Archaeopteryx fossil has been the focus of many public events and attractions. In April 1993, the Munich specimen was the feature of a public press conference in Solnhofen, where it was highlighted by Bavarian journalists, radio and television companies. Later that year it went on exhibit on occasion of the 150th anniversary of the Bavarian State Collection in Munich. In 1997, the Chicago Field Museum featured it in a special exhibit titled \\"Archaeopteryx—the bird that rocked the world\\" for the annual meeting of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology. The specimen spent five years, from 1994 to 1999, in Munich on loan from the Aktien-Verein. Though technically still under private ownership, it began being referred to as \\"the Munich specimen\\" around this time and was coveted by a number of potential buyers for amounts well into the millions of marks range. The head of the Solenhofer Aktien-Verein, Dr. Michael Bücker, expressed interest in selling the specimen around the end of the loan period to Munich, and eventually the fossil was offered to the Bavarian State Collection for 2 million deutschmarks. In this way, the Bavarian State Collection was able to purchase an Archaeopteryx specimen for the first time in 160 years, and remains a uniquely important cultural and scientific object to the state of Bavaria.Wellnhofer (2009) pp. 104–105 =Specimen= Munich specimen display case at the Munich Museum of Paleontology The exact position of the specimen in the limestone layer is known, indicating that the Munich specimen is the highest in the Plattenkalk profile of Upper Solnhofen limestone and therefore the geologically youngest. Found in the same area were the Maxberg specimen at 8.5 m below the Munich specimen, and the London specimen at 14.5 m, indicating that these Archaeopteryx specimens were buried in the same location but something like 45,000 years (for the Maxberg specimen) and 75,000 years (for the London) earlier. (Barthel 1978, Viohl 1985a, Park & Fürsich 2001a, b) Skeleton Both main slab and counterslab were recovered, and while the main slab preserves the bones of the skeleton better, the feather imprints are clearer on the counterslab. The skeleton is nearly complete, and retains most of its natural articulation. The skull is one of the only features not completely preserved, with only the braincase, ear region, jugal, lower jaw, and a few other pieces roughly intact. A detailed analysis of the skull elements of this specimen has been published by Elzanowski & Wellnhofer (1996). The teeth of the lower jaw are particularly well-preserved and the anterior third of this mandible is occupied by a total of twelve teeth, equally-spaced, which are consistent in morphology but not in size. Some of the smaller teeth appear recently erupted at time of death, indicating a specific tooth replacement pattern. The Munich specimen provided the first evidence of interdental plates in Archaeopteryx, the presence of which is evidence of a primitive (plesiomorphic) condition: this feature is present in a variety of other archosaurs, but is notably absent in birds. Much of the rest of the skeleton is excellently preserved, including the normal vertebral count in Archaeopteryx, cervical ribs, gastralia, naturally-contacted (and not co-ossified) scapula and coracoid, pelvic girdle, and hind limbs. Both arms are preserved naturally articulated, but the humeri of both are only partially preserved. The specimen was first described as having a bony sternum, which would have been the first evidence for a breastbone in Archaeopteryx (Wellnhofer 1993a). However, when examined with sophisticated ultraviolet techniques, this was revealed to be a medial, plate-like extension of the left coracoid, which had been rotated after death (Wellnhofer & Tischlinger 2004). It was largely the assumption of this bony sternum that led to the fossil's original classification of a new taxon, Archaeopteryx bavarica. The hind limbs, while showing no morphological differences from previously known specimens, were perhaps the best preserved yet and showed some unprecedented details. For example, the right foot was preserved so tightly flexed that the claws of the first and fourth toes are overlapping, indicating that a grasping or perching function was present in Archaeopteryx, possibly as sophisticated as that of modern birds.Wellnhofer (2009) pp. 110–111 Plumage Only the imprints of wing and tail feathers are present, and all sign of feathers comes from the counterslab. No body feathers are evident. The right wing displays a fan-like arrangement of primary feathers which number at eleven to twelve, as is typical for Archaeopteryx specimens. Some of the specimen's arm feathers show indicators not just of shafts but also vanes and rami. The less-clear secondaries are also visible. Despite its much smaller body size, the Munich specimen's longest primary—the sixth—approaches that of the London specimen, and would also be considerably longer proportionally than that of the Berlin specimen. The tail feathers are imprinted biserially along the caudal vertebrae, which is typical for the genus, and preservation begins around the 9th caudal. The longest tail feathers, at the distal tip, are also much relatively longer than the same feathers in the London specimen. The reason for the Munich specimen's comparatively longer wing and tail feathers is not known, but could be individual variation, age difference or sex difference.Wellnhofer (2009) pp. 111–112  The Daiting specimen  Daiting Specimen, holotype of Archaeopteryx albersdoerferi An eighth, fragmentary specimen was discovered in 1990, not in Solnhofen limestone, but in somewhat younger sediments at Daiting, Suevia. It is therefore known as the Daiting Specimen, and had been known since 1996 only from a cast, briefly shown at the Naturkundemuseum in Bamberg. The original was purchased by palaeontologist Raimund Albertsdörfer in 2009.Archäologischer Sensationsfund in Daiting, Augsburger Allgemeine - Donauwörth edition, published: 28 November 2009, accessed: 23 December 2009 It was on display for the first time with six other original fossils of Archaeopteryx at the Munich Mineral Show in October 2009.Sammler und Forscher - ein schwieriges Verhältnis , Sueddeutsche Zeitung, published: 25 October 2009, accessed: 25 December 2009 A first, quick look by scientists indicates that this specimen might represent a new species of Archaeopteryx.Wiedergefundener Archaeopteryx ist wohl neue Art Die Zeit, accessed: 25 December 2009 It was found in a limestone bed that was a few hundred thousand years younger than the other finds. =History= The eighth specimen of Archaeopteryx was officially announced in February 1996 at a special exhibition at Bavaria's Naturkunde Museum. Its director, Matthias Mäuser, made the announcement to a surprised audience that the specimen had already been casted and that this was on display in the exhibit. Few details were known of its origin or preparation, but it was concluded that the type of preservation indicated a Mörnsheim formation origin, which overlies the Solnhofen proper and is slightly younger. Since the best-known vertebrate Mörnsheim fossils come from the Daiting quarry, the eighth specimen is thought to have originated there. However, it remains possible that it came instead from a quarry near Mülheim.Wellnhofer (2009) pp. 113 The Daiting Specimen was given the name Archaeopteryx albersdoerferi by Kundrat et al. (2018).Martin Kundrát, John Nudds, Benjamin P. Kear, Junchang Lü & Per Ahlberg (2019) The first specimen of Archaeopteryx from the Upper Jurassic Mörnsheim Formation of Germany, Historical Biology, 31:1, 3-63 =Specimen= Only one scientific analysis, conducted by Matthias Mäuser in 1997, has been performed on the cast of this specimen. The fossil displays only a skull and a few skeletal elements including scapulae, a humerus, a furcula, and a wing with incomplete hand. Based on the length of the humerus, Mäuser has estimated the size of the animal to approximate that of the Thermopolis specimen. Otherwise, without subjecting the original fossil to further mechanical preparation, X-ray or UV investigations, there is little more that can be known. Though unremarkable in anatomy and preservation, the Daiting specimen is the first evidence of Archaeopteryx persisting past the span of geologic time indicated by the Solnhofen formation. Wellnhofer speculates that this specimen could have lived around a hundred thousand years later than the Solnhofen specimens, but concedes that possible osteological changes over this span of time could not be reliably ascertained without access to the original fossil.  The Bürgermeister-Müller specimen  Bürgermeister-Müller (\\"chicken wing\\") Specimen Another fragmentary fossil was found in 2000. It is in private possession and since 2004 on loan to the Bürgermeister-Müller Museum in Solnhofen, so it is called the Bürgermeister-Müller Specimen; the institute itself officially refers to it as the \\"Exemplar of the families Ottman & Steil, Solnhofen\\". As the fragment represents the remains of a single wing of Archaeopteryx, the popular name of this fossil is \\"chicken wing\\".Wellnhofer (2009) p. 114 =History= This ninth specimen of Archaeopteryx first came to light in spring of 2004 when it was presented to the Bürgermeister-Müller Museum by quarry worker Karl Schwegler. He claimed to have discovered it in a quarry above Solnhofen, on the Old Steinberg. After the specimen was recognized for what it was—the wing bones of an Archaeopteryx—an agreement was arranged for the fossil to go on an unlimited loan to the Solnhofen Museum, and the owners subsequently agreed to let it undergo scientific investigation by the Bavarian State Collection in Munich. The fossil was unveiled to the public in summer of 2004 and has been on display in the Bürgermeister-Müller Museum ever since.Wellnhofer (2009) p. 115 =Specimen= The fossil, which had been immediately nicknamed the \\"chicken wing\\" upon unveiling, consists of an isolated wing skeleton which includes the upper and lower arm, which are crossed following post-mortem displacement, as well as an almost-complete hand. Most of the bones are preserved three-dimensionally on the main slab. The humerus shows an \\"unfinished\\" exterior typical of death prior to final stage of ossification, indicating another immature specimen. On the counterslab, traces of distinct and slightly curved elevations can be seen in a fan-like arrangement around the second finger. These are assumed to be imprints of the shafts of primary remiges.Wellnhofer (2009) p. 116  The Thermopolis specimen  The Thermopolis specimen Long in a private collection in Switzerland, the Thermopolis Specimen (WDC CSG 100) was discovered in Bavaria and described in 2005 by Mayr, Pohl, and Peters. Donated to the Wyoming Dinosaur Center in Thermopolis, Wyoming, it has the best-preserved head and feet; most of the neck and the lower jaw have not been preserved. The \\"Thermopolis\\" specimen was described in 2 December 2005 Science journal article as \\"A well-preserved Archaeopteryx specimen with theropod features\\"; it shows that the Archaeopteryx lacked a reversed toe – a universal feature of birds – limiting its ability to perch on branches and implying a terrestrial or trunk-climbing lifestyle. See commentary on article This has been interpreted as evidence of theropod ancestry. In 1988, Gregory S. Paul claimed to have found evidence of a hyperextensible second toe, but this was not verified and accepted by other scientists until the Thermopolis specimen was described.Paul, G.S. (1988). Predatory Dinosaurs of the World, a Complete Illustrated Guide. New York: Simon and Schuster. 464 p. \\"Until now, the feature was thought to belong only to the species' close relatives, the deinonychosaurs.\\"National Geographic News- Earliest Bird Had Feet Like Dinosaur, Fossil Shows - Nicholas Bakalar, 1 December 2005, Page 2. Retrieved 2006-10-18. The Thermopolis Specimen was assigned to Archaeopteryx siemensii in 2007. The specimen is considered the most complete and well preserved Archaeopteryx remains yet. =History= This specimen first came to light around the end of 2001, when it was offered to the Senckenberg Museum in Frankfurt by an anonymous collector. No details were provided about the specific place or time of discovery. More information came to light in 2005 via a statement issued by the Wyoming Dinosaur Center (WDC), which asserted that the fossil came originally from the private collections of a Swiss fossil collector who had died in the 1970s, and whose wife then offered the fossil for sale to the Senckenberg Museum shortly thereafter. Unable to raise the requisite funds, the museum approached the Wyoming Dinosaur Center's founder Burkhard Pohl, who was able to find an anonymous donor willing to offer up the funds. After an initial period of display and scientific study in Germany, the specimen would then be given to the WDC on a long-term loan. After a period of research (Mayr et al. 2005, 2007), the fossil was transferred to the Wyoming Dinosaur Center of Thermopolis, Wyoming, where it has remained since June 2007. The export out of Germany of this specimen—widely considered to be one of the best Archaeopteryx fossils known—has caused some concern among German paleontologists and the public. Though no formal legality was broken by the export of the fossil to Switzerland in the 1970s, nor to the U.S. where it remains, there was some initial concern over the potential availability of the fossil for scientific scrutiny, given that the WDC is a private, not public, institution. (Stoksad 2005) However, the WDC has issued a statement that they will pose no barrier to scientific inquiry from home or abroad, and intend to leave the fossil on public display indefinitely. Thus the Thermopolis specimen of Archaeopteryx is the first to find a permanent home outside of Europe, in the U.S.Wellnhofer (2009) pp. 117–118 =Specimen= In sheer completeness, articulation and detail, the Thermopolis specimen is surely one of the best, and is said to be surpassed in beauty only by the Berlin specimen. The skeleton has been professionally prepared, and some of the bones, including the skull, are preserved in three dimensions. The only missing parts include some presacral and final caudal vertebrae, as well as some small pieces of the right foot. The specimen also preserves voluminous plumage whose imprints show feathers still attached to the wings and tail, indicating a relatively short period of floating on the surface waters of the bird's ancient lagoons before preservation.Wellnhofer (2009) pp. 118 Skeleton The skull of the Thermopolis specimen rivals only the Berlin and Eichstätt as the best- preserved of any Archaeopteryx specimen. It is the only one that shows the skull in dorsal view, permitting access to details hitherto unknown. Most of the mandible is overlapped and hidden by the skull, though the tips of five dentary teeth are visible through the right nasal opening. Ten of the standard 23 presacral vertebrae are missing, as well as the last several caudals of the tail-tip. Chevrons along the tail—large, plate-like hemophophyses—are visible and well-developed in this specimen. Only a few ribs are preserved, lacking the ones associated with the missing thoracic vertebrae, and ventrally- preserved gastralia are preserved showing an asymmetrical zigzag pattern similar to that in confuciusornithines (Chiappe et al. 1999). The specimen shows, for the first time in an Archaeopteryx specimen, an entirely exposed coracoid, which shows some unprecedented details. As in all other specimens, there is no ossified sternum. This and other details of the humerus suggest, like the other specimens, an animal immature at the time of death. The hind limbs are particularly well-preserved and show a handful of unprecedented details. Unlike other specimens, the hind legs are splayed apart in opposite directions, and most of their elements have remained in natural articulation. The excellent detail of the feet shows that the first toe (hallux) was not fully reversed, as in most modern birds, and instead is spread medially on both feet. Some researchers have subsequently considered the appearance of a reversed hallux in other specimens to be an artifact of preservation. (Mayr et al. 2005) Another unique feature of the feet that has come to light via the Thermopolis specimen is the orientation of the second toe, which shows features consistent with hyperextension, as in dromaeosaurs and troodontids. This specimen suggests that Archaeopteryx could have raised its short second toe in a similar manner to its dromaeosaur cousin Deinonychus, whose second toe bore an enlarged \\"sickle claw\\" for probable use in predation. It remains unclear whether Archaeopteryx also used its hyperextended toe-claw in a similar fashion or for some other purpose. Taken together, many of the unique features of the skull, feet and coracoid strengthen a close relationship of archaeopterygids to deinonychosaurian theropods.Wellnhofer (2009) pp. 120–121 Plumage Well-preserved imprints of wing and tail plumage show details of the barbs, but not barbules, and the shafts of 11 primaries can be counted on the right wing. Asymmetry is visible on the eighth to tenth primaries. The secondaries are too faint to be counted, but are assumed to range between 12 and 15. \\"Marked, fuzzy furrows\\" around the elbow joint may have indicated tertiaries. The tail feathers (rectrices) are also too faint to be confidently counted, but barbs are nevertheless observable though fainter than those on the wings. All of the tail feathers appear to attach to the vertebral column at the same angle of around 30 degrees.Wellnhofer (2009) p. 121  The eleventh specimen  The eleventh specimen In 2011 the discovery of an eleventh specimen was announced. It is said to be one of the more complete specimens, but is missing the skull and one forelimb. It is privately owned and has yet to be given a name. Paleontologists of Ludwig-Maximilians- Universitaet (LMU) in Munich are currently studying it. This specimen reveals previously unknown features of the plumage. Foth et al. (2014) describe pennaceous feathers not only on the wings and tail, but on the body and legs, features previously unseen in Archaeopteryx. The eleventh specimen provides insight into the original function of pennaceous feathers. An analysis of the phylogenetic distribution of pennaceous feathers on advanced maniraptoran theropod dinosaurs and basal birds suggests an original function other than flight. Pennaceous feathers thus represent an exaptation and were only later adapted for aerodynamic capabilities, a function that was apparently convergent among different groups within Avialae.  The twelfth specimen  The twelfth specimen In February 2014, the existence of a twelfth specimen was announced from an Altmannstein quarry near the Schamhaupten district of Bavaria. This specimen was unearthed by a private collector in 2010. Based on a new diagnosis for the genus Archaeopteryx, by the German paleontologist Oliver Rauhut c.s., the Berlin, Eichstätt, Solnhofen, Munich, Daiting, Thermopolis, 11th, and 12th specimens can be referred to this genus with high certainty.

It was first published as a book in 1974. The plot is set in the Bronx, New York City, from mid-1962 to mid-1963.Richard Price: The Wanderers, Houghton Mifflin Company, 1st printing, 1974, Writing and publication Price was 24 years old when The Wanderers, was published. It was his first novel, and the setting of the story is a housing project in the Bronx, New York, which is similar to that in which Price grew up. The book contains 12 chapters, which are loosely connected with each other, mainly by reappearing characters. It is more like a collection of short stories--each chapter can stand on its own. A conventional encompassing plot is missing. However, there is a thread: the protagonists are forced to mature, each one in his own way, toward the end of the book. Parts of the book were published as the story \\"Big Playground\\" in Antaeus, New York City, in 1972.Antaeus, Autumn 1972 Regarding the year(s) in which the story takes place there is an inconsistency.

The Wanderers was first published at Houghton Mifflin, Boston, Massachusetts, USA in 1974. Reprints and publications at other publishers followed, such as: *Avon Books, New York, USA, 1975. Paperback. . *Chatto & Windus, London, UK, 1975. Hardcover. . *Rowohlt, Reinbek, GER, 1976. 1st German paperback edition (German title “Scharfe Zeiten”). . *Bloomsbury Publishing Limited, London, UK, 1993. 1st paperback edition. . Plot Richie Gennaro is the 17-year-old leader of the Wanderers, an Italian-American youth gang in the Bronx in 1962. His girlfriend is Denise Rizzo. Richie's friends in the Wanderers are Joey Capra, Buddy Borsalino, Eugene Caputo and Perry LaGuardia. At the beginning of the book, a broad range of events and characters describe the zeitgeist. In addition to the protagonists, many characters appear only once. At first, “gang-business” is on focus: rivalry with other gangs in the neighborhood who come from different cultural and/or ethnic backgrounds. This rivalry is determined by prejudice and machismo. But there is also competition, in terms of sports such as football and bowling. And above all, it is about being cool and trying to have sex for the first time. Toward the end of the book, the events focus more and more on the protagonists and their problems and challenges of growing up – everyone in his own way. Eugene joins the marines after watching, without interfering, his girlfriend, Nina, being raped. Perry's father had died several years ago; now his mother dies, and he's suddenly on his own. Living with his aunt in Trenton, New Jersey, becomes unbearable for him, so he decides to go to Boston and sail to sea. After the situation escalates, Joey flees from his violent father and joins Perry. And Buddy impregnates his girlfriend, Despie, on their very first date and has to face the challenges of being a 17-year-old husband and father. The serious side of life is catching up, the gang is falling apart, and Richie is staying behind. Characters =Major characters= *Richie Gennaro, 17 years old, is the head of the Wanderers. His father, Louis, and his mother, Millie, both 41 years old, run a rather conservative household with a reasonable income, since there's always plenty of good food on the table. Louis accuses Richie of being ungrateful for what he does for him. Apart from that, Richie's family background is pretty normal. Richie has a 12-year-old brother, Randy, and a girlfriend, Denise. Richie is desperately trying to get laid. *Denise Rizzo, called C, 15 years old, is Richie's girlfriend. Her parents often have arguments and yell at each other in front of the children. They both blame one another for lack of respect. C stands for comb, since Denise always has a pink comb handy. C has a little brother, Dougie. She is not yet ready for her first time with Richie. *Joey Capra is short, smokes, and has much nervous energy, never standing still. Joey's best friend is Perry. Joey is afraid of his brutal father. There's permanent tension in his home because of his father's conceit and chauvinism. *Mario Borsalino, called Buddy, is anxious to get laid: when he does, he gets Despinoza \\"Despie\\" Carabella pregnant. *Despie Carabella, a friend of C's. They go to the same school, and she later becomes Buddy's love interest, and eventually, wife, after he impregnates her. *Eugene Caputo, whom his father calls him \\"Ace\\", lives with his parents in their house. He's a womanizer, keeping score of his conquests. Eugene's major activity is chasing girls, although he has a complex: because of his penis pointing downward when erected, he thinks he's impotent. Consequently, he's always insulting girls, to make them run off before sex occurs. He is afraid of falling in love, but when does, it leads to tragic consequences. *Perry LaGuardia, a tall, beefy guy, who has problems at home involving his mother, and his brother's absence, to deal with, as well as his rivalry with Emilio, Joey's father. =Minor characters= *Turkey is ugly and alone, but of high intelligence, with flippy parents and a cheap sister. Turkey is Jewish, yet collecting Nazi paraphernalia. He can draw, sing and speak German. He occasionally hangs out with the Wanderers. *Dougie Rizzo, C's brother, he is malicious with an evil streak. Causes much trouble for Richie, but is paid back in full by Randy Gennaro and his gang. *Scotty Hite is Dougie Rizzo's friend, that is, Scotty is Dougie's punching ball, until Scotty dares standing up. Regarding this as mutiny, Dougie tricks Scotty to jump off the roof of a tall building – to death. *Randy Gennaro, Richie's little brother, he is called upon to get revenge against Dougie for causing Richie trouble against the African-American students at his school *Antone is the head of the Pharaohs. After calling a truce with the Wanderers, he turns around and almost hurts the Wanderers, if not for the intervention of Turkey. *Lenny Arkadian owns the sign-painting shop, where the Wanderers sometimes hang out after school. Lenny is more of an entertainer than a business man. He served in the Navy and is the one painting the football banner for the Stingers (football team of the Wanderers). Apparently, Lenny has a lot of experience with women and is Richie's advisor in how to get laid. He finally makes arrangements with a hooker for Richie's first time. *Joey DiMassi is leader of the Fordham Baldies, respected for his fairness and decency. But he tires of being a Baldie, and the nail in the coffin, is when all the good members in a drunken stupor, sign up for the US Navy. *Terror, cross-eyed, 150 pounds, six foot four is the war machine of the Fordham Baldies. He suffers from asthma. His mother is said to be Mexican. *Clinton Stitch is the head of the Pips. *Raymond LaGuardia is Perry's brother, and married with a wife and kids, he neglects his mother and brother after the death of their father. After their mother's death, Perry refuses to have anything to do with him *Nancy and Marie are two girls Buddy and Eugene meet at a bar, Nancy is crosseyed, Marie has a face full of acne, and the two wear hearing aids, but it is with Nancy that Eugene pops his cherry *Emilio Capra is Joey's father. He is a fireman. He has a humiliating and rather violent way of raising his son and treating his wife. Emilio was Mister New York City 1940, and is still in good shape. He is egomaniac and has no respect for his son, who is not at all like him. He likes teasing Joey to the point of distress and giving him a hard time whenever possible. He also has a rivalry with Perry, being the same size. *Chubby Galasso, A Bowling gambler, he and his five brothers run a racket at the local bowling alley. *Peppy Dio, an older man who works in the bar at the bowling alley, he is the uncle of the Galasso brothers, helping them with their racket. *Mr. Sharp, an ex-gang member turned teacher, he hates Puerto Ricans, and teaches all the students of his class a simple lesson about racism. *Nina Becker, Eugene's later girlfriend, he falls in love with her, but after witnessing her rape by a black guy, he leaves her. Reception The Wanderers received mostly positive reviews.New York Times, April 21, 1974 Conor Tannam best sums it up: \\"[...] The language is direct and steers clear of grandiose statements. Price writes about these adolescents like he knows where they ha been, like he had just stepped out of the places and potholes of their childhood. And although his primary focus is on The Wanderers, the eponymous youth gang, his peripheral vision is so sharp it allows him to cast a critical eye over the greater American urban landscape. \\"There is immediate violence. We are drawn into the fierce territorial disputes that govern gang life, even as the tone borders on a parody of that infamous musical West Side Story. Again and again, Price is quick to remind us that the stuff this novel is made of is violence, not irritating sing-alongs. A local football match soon descends into anarchy when the protagonists rise to the challenge of the Ducky Boys, an Irish gang whose members would not reach five feet if they stood on their razors. But long before these boys have reached manhood, physical confrontation is the means by which masculinity is measured. Price is as unafraid as his cast when it comes to making this point: to be a man is to fight for the glory of the tribalistic gangs. Hence, even though the novel avoids the current trend towards the visceral, it leaves no room for ambiguity about life in the projects. \\"Yet Price anchors his novel in a ground so common we have all been to it. As the Wanderers’ awkward sexual encounters capture the insecurity and self- consciousness of adolescence, Price's writing is reminiscent of Ed McBain, not least his blend of humorous levity and human drama. Price weaves the burgeoning sexuality of youth into the city's amorphous community of apartment blocks, and so the panicked bravado of these fumbling encounters not only throws the brutal violence of their childish inexperience into sharp relief. It also shows how precariously we all straddle that gap between Innocence and Fall. \\"The Wanderers is yet another example of crime writing that refuses to exhaust its potential and our patience with stereotypes. The main protagonists may be unashamedly violent, but they are also full of shame and fear. Written in 1974, the novel paints an image of a city that is not quite sure how to negotiate the various ethnic groups along the self-destructive path that often leads through contemporary America. [...]\\"The Crime of it All - At the critical edge of crime and fiction Adaptions =Film= film The Wanderers was filmed in 1979 by Philip Kaufman. The first Avon Books printing from February 1975 refers to the upcoming movie (\\"SOON A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE\\").Richard Price: The Wanderers, AVON 1975, book cover back The artwork of the title on the front cover of the same book may have been the inspiration for the 'Wanderers logo' on the back of the uniform jackets in the film. The major differences between book and film are Despie is Richie's girlfriend and made Chubby's daughter, Buddy is made a minor character, Eugene and C are nonexistent, Nina becomes Joey's love interest and Nina's rape never occurs. Instead, she kisses Richie in the back of his car, becoming his main love interest which betrays Joey. However disappointed with all their boys lifestyles, Richie sees her \\"disappear\\" and becoming more interested and heading into a higher spiritual road along the intellectual Youth Force that will lead the 1960s away from the 1950s in which his gang were still lingering, and way ahead incomprehensible for him at the verge of settling into a married man life. Witnessing the assassination of President Kennedy on a store-window TV set made him realize that change was spinning and speeding up in the nation as a whole, as well as in him and his peers as they transitioned from teens to young adults.

The High Commissions at Mumbai, New Delhi and Kolkata processed 14,366, 6,688 and 1,328 applications, respectively. In 2008, of the 336,000 student visas issued in India, around 20 percent (67,000) were issued in Chennai. Of late, the visa rejection rate from the Deputy High Commission at Chennai has been increased. As part of the U.K. Border Agency's new guidelines, the Deputy High Commission started processing U.K. visa applications from the British High Commission in Colombo, Sri Lanka, in a phased manner. As of 2011, the U.K. Border Agency in Chennai processed most visa applications from Sri Lanka. In December 2013, the Deputy High Commission launched a pilot passport pass-back service, a user-pays service that enables applicants to retain their passport for the majority of the application processing period, for the first time in the country. The British Council Logo of the British Council The British Council division of the Deputy High Commission is the United Kingdom's primary cultural relations organisation and is responsible for activities in education, English language, governance, science and the arts. The British Council office at Chennai covers the South Indian region. It plays an important role in helping Indian students pursue their studies in the United Kingdom. The council also manages the British Library. The British Council division publishes two magazines—Postgraduate U.K. and Club U.K., the latter meant for Indian students. According to 2004 U.K. government figures, of the 14,000 Indian students studying in the United Kingdom, 43 percent hail from South India. In 2010, the British Council launched the British Council IELTS Scholarship Award with the objective of assisting Indian students to continue their postgraduate study at any university abroad.

() is a novel by Alexander Herzen. History Who is to Blame? was first published in the journal Otechestvennye Zapiski (1845-1846), with some cuts by the censor. It was published in book form in 1847. It was the first purely \\"social\\" novel in Russian literature. Vissarion Belinsky remarked that the novel was artistically weak but was valuable as a social and psychological evaluation of contemporary Russian life. Plot In part one Dmitry Krutsifersky, the poor son of a provincial doctor, is hired to tutor the son of the rich landowner Negrov. Krutsifersky eventually marries Negrov's illegitimate daughter Lyubov. In part two Krutsifersky and Lyubov are happily married with a child. Their happiness is destroyed when a rich young landowner named Beltov becomes a friend of the family and begins an illicit relationship with Lyubov. Beltov ends up departing Russia for Europe, leaving the young couple with a broken and hopeless marriage. Part one is a satire of the Russian landed gentry, showing their coarseness and pettiness. Part two introduces the type of the \\"superfluous man\\" in the person of Beltov.

Biography Farnum was educated in Pottsville, Pennsylvania. In his youth, Farnum was an Overland express rider.Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher, Civil War High Commands. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. . p. 231. Farnum entered the army as sergeant-major of the 1st Pennsylvania Infantry in 1846, and served through the Mexican War. Subsequently he joined the Lopez expedition to Cuba which left New Orleans in 1850, and also took an active part in Walker's Nicaraguan expeditions. Still later he was captain of the slave yacht \\"Wanderer,\\" and was indicted at Savannah, Georgia, for carrying on the slave trade. He is said to have regretted this episode in his life. At the beginning of the Civil War, he became major in the 70th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, which was raised and commanded by General Sickles. He distinguished himself for gallantry in all the engagements in which Sickles's brigade took part, and was promoted colonel of his regiment. At the Battle of Williamsburg, 5 May 1862, he was severely wounded, but recovered in time to take part in the battles of Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, and Gettysburg. (Colonel Farnum's name appears in the Graffiti House in Brandy Station, Virginia from this period.) He was then compelled by his wounds to abandon active service, and accepted the colonelcy of the 11th regiment of the veteran reserve corps, which he retained until the close of the war.

Soubise sauce was originally a slow-cooked onion and butter mixture used with various meats, game, poultry and vegetables dating back to the 1850s. Over the years, and through the hands of many chefs, it now has many variations. The simplest contains 3 ingredients, not counting salt and pepper. The French version is either thickened with Béchamel sauce, or with cooked rice, ground in a Mortar and pestle. History According to an 1872 issue of Victoria Magazine the sauce takes it name from the Prince de Soubise.Victoria Magazine - Volume 20 - Page 270 It is one of the sauces known from collection of Auguste Escoffier, made by adding a thickened béchamel to butter-stewed onions. To make a variation with rice and bacon fat instead of béchamel, Escoffier suggests to gently cook a high starch rice (such as Carolina rice) with fatty bacon, onions and white consommé, then purée the onions and rice before finishing with the usual butter and cream. Tomato purée seasoned with paprika or curry can be added to either variation, but Escoffier notes that béchamel is preferred to rice for its smoother consistency. 19th- century Anglo-Italian cook Charles Elmé Francatelli serves the sauce over boiled pheasant with potato croquettes. Eliza Acton, who said soubise was \\"the finest kind of onion sauce\\", serves it with lamb, suggesting any rich gravy or brown cucumber sauce as a substitute. It is among the sauces she recommends to be served with Veal Fricandeau. Her recipe for English soubise replaces the béchamel with rich veal gravy finished with cream.

S. Van Dyke and distributed by Metro Pictures. The film starred Bessie Love and Gareth Hughes. It is considered a lost film.  Plot  Scene from the film with Otto Lederer and Bessie Love Young mother Mary Gordoon (Hunt) is too poor to take care of her infant daughter, and leaves the child at orphanage. The girl, Ann (Love) grows up with a crippled leg in the orphanage, and has fallen in love with a fellow orphan Jimmy (Hughes). The mother returns to the orphanage after 15 years to adopt her daughter, but believing her daughter to have been adopted by someone else already, she adopts Jimmy instead. Ann is eventually adopted by a sidewalk musician (Lederer), who teaches her to play the violin. When Jimmy marries another girl, Ann plays at his wedding. Many years later, after Jimmy's wife dies, the pair are reunited.  Cast   Production  Director W. S. Van Dyke was unhappy about the casting of Bessie Love in the lead, whom he had not chosen. In preparation for her role, Love lived at an orphanage for two weeks. Scenes were filmed at the Crooked Tree in Arch Beach, Laguna. The song \\"A Million Hearts Are Calling: Forget Me Not\\" with words and music by Billy Baskette and Ernest Lutz, was composed and published for the film.  Reception  The film received generally positive reviews and was commercially successful. According to The Evening Mail, the film \\"is a fine, clean, beautiful picture… told with such depth of understanding and with entire lack of artificiality that it strikes its note of appeal as few films that have… It is blessed with a cast that could not be improved upon.\\" The Daily News said, \\"Few who see this little screen drama will not soon forget its sweetness and charm.\\" The New York Times was critical of the film, deeming that it had only \\"one genuinely poignant moment.\\" Of the performances, those of Love and Hunt, in particular, were praised. The New York Times reviewer wrote of Hughes's performance that \\"it is always a pleasure to watch him\\" and that Love was \\"sometimes remarkably effective, though occasionally she simpers in an annoying manner\\". The film's use of intertitles was criticized.

He served as High Treasurer and High Burgrave of Bohemia.  Life  William of Rosenberg was a member of the influential noble House of Rosenberg. He was the son of Jošt III of Rosenberg and his second wife Anna of Roggendorf (d. 1562). His father died when William was four years old. William and his younger brother Peter Vok then stood under the guardianship of their uncle Peter V. From age seven, he studied at the Protestant private school of Arnošt Kraiger von Kraigk in Mlada Boleslav. In 1544, at the age of nine, he switched to a Catholic school for young nobles at the court of Bishop Wolfgang of Passau. On 23 April 1551, at the age of sixteen, William was declared an adult by a decree of Emperor Ferdinand I. He took up the administration of the family's possessions and chose as his residence Český Krumlov Castle, which he remodeled in a Renaissance style. From 1552 to 1556, he fought a court case against Henry IV of Plauen, the High Chancellor of Bohemia, about their precedence in Bohemian society. William won. In 1560, he was appointed High Treasurer by King Ferdinand. In 1566, he was appointed commander of the Bohemian army and on 10 June 1566, he began forming an army at Znojmo to fight a war against the Ottoman Empire. Their aim was to recapture Szigetvár, which William's brother-in-law Nikola Šubić Zrinski had lost to the Turks. The Habsburg armies were to meet at Győr. However, the Turks retreated south after the death of Suleiman the Magnificent and no battle ensued. Youth Portrait The salt house built at Prachatice (South Bohemia) in 1571. Note his name WILHELMUS ROSENBERG in the central fresco. On 26 May 1570, William was appointed High Burgrave of Bohemia, the highest office in the Kingdom. In this position, he was repeatedly given diplomatic duties, for example, he was sent to Germany twice. In 1572, he negotiated with Emperor Maximilian II, the leader of the Holy League about the next step to take in the ongoing war with then Ottoman Empire. In 1574, he was involved in the negotiations about electing King Rudolf II of Bohemia as the new emperor. In Poland, he represented the interests of Archduke Ernest of Austria, who aimed to be elected King of Poland. His efforts were in vain, although he gained so much sympathy that when King Henry fled, he was considered as a candidate to be the next king. As it happened, King Rudolf was also interested and out of loyalty, William withdrew. Eventually Stephen Bathory, a Transylvanian prince, was elected. However, he died shortly after his election. William was honored with the order of the Golden Fleece for his diplomatic mediation. In 1587, Sigismund III Vasa was elected as the new King of Poland, defeating the Habsburg candidate Maximilian III. Maximilian then tried to grab power in Poland by invading the country. His army was defeated by the Polish general Jan Zamoyski and he was taken prisoner. William was sent to Poland to negotiate his release. These negotiations led to a peace treaty in March 1589, and Maximilian's release. In addition to his high political office, William was actively promoting science, literature, music and architecture. Both he and his younger brother Peter Vok acted as patrons of the arts. They supported the Charles University in Prague and founded secondary schools in their territories. They created a library with a vast collection of precious manuscripts and incunables. With its approximately volumes, it was one of the largest libraries of its time. Many humanists such as the Flemish mineralogist, physician and naturalist Anselmus de Boodt were active at his court.Marie-Christiane De Boodt-Maselis, Anselmus Boetius De Boodt (1550-1632), Brugs humanist aan het Hof van Oostenrijk Vlaanderen in: Jaargang 51. Christelijk Vlaams Kunstenaarsverbond, Tielt 2002, p. 21-22 William also supported economic and cultural development in his territories. His Třeboň Castle was expanded and remodeled in a renaissance style by the architect Antonio Ericer between 1565 and 1575. He added the southwest wing, a tower and the entrance gate. In 1573, William expanded the Rosenberg Palace his uncle Peter V had built inside the Prague Castle, using designs made by the architect Ulrico Aostalli.Rožmberk Palace at radio.cz In the town of Roudnice nad Labem, which he acquired in 1577, he renewed the castle and the bridge across the Elbe. In 1580, William exchanged some territory with his business manager Jakub Krčín of Jelčan: he transferred Sedlčany and Křepenice to Jakub and received a large deer parc and the Leptáč manor near Netolice in return. Between 1583 and 1589, William built his Kratochvíle Castle at Netolice. This castle is one of the most important Renaissance buildings in southern Bohemia. In 1584, he invited the Jesuits to his Český Krumlov Castle and between 1586 and 1588, they constructed a large college building there. The castle, which was his main residence, was extensively remodeled during his reign and he equipped a number of state rooms in the upper castle. In 1580, he added a tower, connected to the castle with a Renaissance arcade. In 1589 he took part in the negotiations of the Treaty of Bytom and Będzin. Around 1590, he added the Little Castle. He gave town rights to Borovany, which was located in his land, and in Libějovice he expanded the old castle into another renaissance castle. In Třeboň, he promoted carp breeding and constructed the Rožmberk Pond. William died in 1592 and was buried in the St. Vitus Church in Český Krumlov, next to his third wife, Anna Maria of Baden. Since he was childless, his younger brother Peter Vok inherited his possessions. When Peter vok died in 1611, the House of Rosenberg died out in the male line.  Marriages  William married four times. All four marriages were childless. By marrying German imperial princesses, he gained political influence outside Bohemia, which benefitted his diplomatic efforts. He married: # Catherine of Brunswick (1534 - 10 May 1559). They married on 28 February 1557 in Münden. She died either in Karlovy Vary or in Teplice and was buried in the Rosenberg family vault in the Vyšší Brod Monastery # Sophie of Brandenburg (15 December 1541 - 27 June 1564), a granddaughter of King Sigismund I of Poland, and daughter of Joachim II Hector, Elector of Brandenburg. They married on 14 December 1561 in Cölln (now part of Berlin). She died in Český Krumlov and was also buried in Vyšší Brod Monastery # Anna Maria of Baden (22 May 1562 - 25 April 1583), daughter of Philibert, Margrave of Baden-Baden. She was 15 years old when they married on 27 January 1578.

Historically the watershed was much larger than its current limits, but was altered in the early 1970s to divert runoff into Long Bayou for flood relief. Due to the low volume of water, and the nutrient and pollutant rich drainage from the urbanized area surrounding the lake, water quality has been a concern, with the county developing the Lake Seminole Watershed Management Plan to protect water quality and habitat. On the east shore of Lake Seminole is Lake Seminole Park, a 250 acre county park that provides year-round public access to the lake. Popular activities on the lake include boating, jet skiing, water-skiing, and fishing. The park is also popular with families and nature enthusiasts, and includes a two-mile multi-use trail that winds through pine flat woods, a softball field, and volleyball courts.http://www.pinellascounty.org/park/08_Seminole.htm References External links *Information at Pinellas County website Seminole Category:Lakes of Pinellas County, Florida ","title":"Lake Seminole (Pinellas County, Florida)"},{"id":"34483935","text":"Exaeretia nigromaculata is a moth of the family Depressariidae.

Life Shortly before John Spata died on 29 October (1399, according to Nicol; 1400 according to others), he appointed his brother, Sgouros, ruler of Naupactus, as his successor as the despot of Arta. A few days after Sgouros took over Arta, however, the town was captured by the adventurer Vonko.According to a Greek monastic chronicle from the Panteleimon monastery at Ioannina, \\"October 29, on Wednesday (1400), Despot Spatas enters Eternity (dies).

In 1402/3, Maurice came to Sgouros' aid when the latter was besieged at Angelokastron by the forces of Carlo I Tocco. The attack, under Carlo's general Galasso Peccatore, was repulsed, but Sgouros died soon after, from wounds suffered in the war, leaving his possessions to his son Paul Spata. Aftermath Sgouros was succeeded by his son Paul, who became an Ottoman vassal and was aided with a contingent that was defeated by Tocco in 1406, after the latter had turned on the offensive, Angelokastron was ceded to the Turks and Paul retired to Naupaktos, however he sold it in 1407 to the Republic of Venice.

The CSSWE mission was a joint effort by the University of Colorado's Department of Aerospace Engineering Sciences and Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics. The mission principal investigator was Prof. Xinlin Li, and the Co- PIs are Prof. Scott Palo and Dr. Shri Kanekal. The project manager for the project was Dr. Lauren Blum, the system engineer was Dr. David Gerhardt, and the instrument scientist was Dr. Quintin Schiller. CSSWE launched on September 13, 2012, on an Atlas V rocket by the United Launch Alliance on ELaNa-VI as part of the NASA's CubeSat Launch Initiative (CSLI). The CSSWE team released its science products to the public for download on NASA's Coordinated Data Analysis Web Site (CDAWeb). As of December 22, 2014, CSSWE showed severe battery degradation, likely due to pushing the battery thousands of cycles beyond the battery's design specs. As a result, CSSWE cannot retain enough power to receive or transmit data. Mission Objective CSSWE's mission objective is to study space weather from a near-Earth orbit (480 km x 780 km).Li, X., S. Palo, R. Kohnert, L. Blum, D. Gerhardt, Q. Schiller, and S. Califf (2013), Small mission accomplished by students - big impact on space weather research, Space Weather, Accepted, DOI: 10.1002/swe.20025 Specifically, CSSWE works in conjunction with concurrent missions (such as the Van Allen Probes, BARREL, and SAMPEX) to address the following questions: 1) How does solar flare location, magnitude, and frequency elate to the timing, duration, and energy spectrum of solar energetic particles (SEPs) reaching Earth and 2) How the spectrum and dynamics of Earth's radiation belt electrons evolve.Li, X., S. Palo, and R. Kohnert (2011), Small Space Weather Research Mission Designed Fully by Students, Space Weather, 9, S04006, doi:10.1029/2011SW000668 Science Instrument CSSWE's science instrument, the Relativistic Electron and Proton Telescope integrated little experiment (REPTile), is the only science instrument aboard and meets the mission objectives. It is a scaled-down version of the Relativistic Electron and Proton Telescope (REPT) instrument, which is part of the Energetic Particle, Composition, and Thermal Plasma (ECT) Instrument SuiteVan Allen Probes Instrument Suites on board the Van Allen Probes. REPTile fulfills the mission objectives by measuring electrons from 0.58 to >3.8 Megaelectronvolts (MeV) and protons from 8 to 40 MeV.Blum, L. and Q.

Also on the CubeSat is an onboard magnetometer to provide knowledge of spacecraft and instrument orientation with respect to Earth's magnetic field. Pre-Flight Testing CSSWE underwent the same rigorous testing that all space-based assets at LASP do. In addition to component and subsystem level testing, the spacecraft underwent numerous system level tests. It passed the thermal vacuum chamber test, in which 11 orbital cycles of the spacecraft were simulated in vacuum by increasing and decreasing the spacecraft temperature to reproduce thermal models which predict actual on-orbit temperatures. The first few hours of the mission were reproduced by simulating launch (in which the deployment switch is released, initiating automated commissioning phase) from a mesa nearby the LASP ground station. CSSWE passed this test by completing the initial commissioning phase, deploying its antenna, and establishing contact with the LASP ground station. Orbital attitude tests were performed as well, including Helmholtz cage and error ellipse tests. Launch CSSWE was originally scheduled to launch on August 2, 2012 aboard the National Reconnaissance Office Launch-36 (NROL-36). However, the launch was delayed three times to provide additional time for resolution of a range instrumentation issue, according to the United Launch Alliance official statement.NASASpaceFlight.com Launch Summary The Atlas V 401 eventually launched on September 13, 2012 from Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 3. The primary payload aboard NROL-36 was a classified NRO payload, so no spacecraft or orbit information was provided. However, there were 11 CubeSats on board the rocket as secondary payloads. The launch vehicle delivered the CubeSats into a 480x780 km orbit with an inclination of 65 degrees. The CubeSats were carried in eight PPOD dispensers attached to the end of the Centaur rocket via the Aft Bulkhead Carrier, which replaced an unnecessary Helium tank. Four of the CubeSats were launched as part of the NASA's Educational Launch of Nanosatellites (ELaNa) program - CSSWE (University of Colorado - Boulder), CINEMA 1 (University of California - Berkeley et al.), CXBN (Morehead State University), and CP5 (California Polytechnic University). The remaining seven were Aeneas (operated by the University of Southern California), two SMDC-ONE (US Army), STARE-A (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory), and three AeroCube-4 (Aerospace Corporation). An artistic rendition of how CSSWE would appear on orbit. On Orbit Success The spacecraft uses a measuring tape as an antenna to communicate with ground stations. CSSWE was first heard beaconing telemetry packets by amateur radio operator call sign DK3WN almost exactly two hours after deployment from the PPOD, overcoming its first major hurdle. The spacecraft completed science commissioning and was commanded into full science mode 22 days later on October 5. Full mission success occurred on January 5, 2013 after three months of science data. The CSSWE mission ended in December 2014 due to battery degradation.

NSMS is also known by the names \\"blade tip timing\\" (BTT), \\"arrival time analysis\\" (ATA), \\"blade vibration monitoring\\" (BVM), Beruehrungslose Schaufel Schwingungsmessung (BSSM), and \\"blade health monitoring\\" (BHM). NSMS uses externally mounted sensors to determine the passing times of turbomachinery blades. The passing times after conversion to deflections, can be used to measure each blade’s vibratory response characteristics such as amplitude/stress, phase, frequency and damping. Since every blade is measured, stage effects such as flutter, blade mistuning, and nodal diameter can also be characterized. The measurement method has been used successfully in all stages of the gas turbine engine (fan, compressor, and turbine) and on other turbo- machinery equipment ranging from turbochargers to rocket pumps. The ability to apply the technology to a given situation is dependent upon a sensor type that can meet the environmental requirements. Method A set of sensors is used to measure the arrival times of rotating blades. These arrival times, in comparison to a baseline, are used to determine blade deflections. The blade deflections over a number of revolutions and/or across a number of sensors can be used to determine vibratory characteristics. This information, in conjunction with a finite element model (FEM), can then be used to determine the dynamic stresses in a rotating part. Spot probe example, radial view Hardware Any sensor or probe that can provide a precise indication of a blade’s passing can be used in NSMS. Commonly optical probes using fiber optics are used to obtain a high level of spatial resolution. A light source, typically a laser, and fiber optics are used to direct a constant beam of light into the path of a rotating blade. As a blade passes the probe, light is reflected and captured by fiber optic and routed to a photo detector for conversion to an electrical signal. Field type sensors such as Eddy Current, Capacitive, and Microwave sensors are useful in harsh environments and for long duration testing. History NSMS technology was patented as early as 1949,US 2,575,710 with many improvements patented since that date. Some recent US practitioners believe that NSMS was first developed in 1980, by major aircraft engine OEMs (and the US Air Force). It may be envisioned as a replacement technology to rotating strain gauges, however it is currently used as an essential complement to strain gauges. The technology is widely used for turbo-machinery development and high cycle fatigue (HCF) troubleshooting. Due to the direct blade observation, external mounting and inherent serviceability of the sensors, NSMS has been used since at least 2006 as a long term health monitoring method. More recently, multiple practitioners are becoming active in this application of the technology.

Programming The IFT played the important role of bringing to Ireland notable developments in the art of cinema of which the public were otherwise deprived by lack of interest from mainstream Irish cinemas, or which had been or would have been banned, or significantly damaged by cuts by the Irish film censor at the time.A new history of Ireland, Volumes 7-8 by Theodore William Moody, Francis X. Martin, Francis John Byrne, Art Cosgrove. The cinema screened mostly non-mainstream work usually unavailable elsewhere in Ireland including Irish film, independent film, and foreign language film from around the world. Established classic films were exhibited alongside new releases, allowing audiences the chance to view work from Western and Eastern Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia, and Latin and North America at a time when cinema programming in Ireland was usually confined to mainstream English language material from the United States and Britain. Films from the United States that were ignored by Irish commercial cinemas were also shown, such as Nashville by Robert Altman or Between the Lines by Joan Micklin Silver. Avoidance of censorship The cinema operated as a film club where members paid a fee to join. Members could also bring non-members as their guests. Under the Censorship of Films Act, 1923 (amended in 1925, 1930, 1970, and 1992) only films to be shown to the general public needed to be submitted to the film censor to receive a certificate allowing exhibition. Films screened in private clubs were uninspected and were shown in their entirety without any censorship. Many foreign language and independent films that were radically forthright, and that would otherwise have been cut or banned by the Irish censor, were shown in their complete forms, including Pasolini's Salò, Oshima's Ai No Corrida, Bertolucci's Last Tango in Paris, and a great many other films whose portrayals of nudity and sexuality would have triggered bans or cuts in Ireland at that time.Censorship of Indecency in Ireland: A View From Abroad, Jerome O'Callaghan, The Institute for European Studies, December 1998. Closure The Sugar Club The financially ailing Irish Film Theatre was closed by the Arts Council at the end of May 1984. The final film shown was Forbidden Relations, a Hungarian drama about incest. The IFT was itself a successor to the Irish Film Society, and the role of showing art cinema played by the IFT was later undertaken in Dublin by the Irish Film Centre in Temple Bar in 1992, by the Screen Cinema on Hawkins Street, and by the Light House Cinema in Smithfield. The theatre in Earlsfort Terrace reopened in 1999 as a multi-purpose arts-and-entertainment venue and bar called The Sugar Club, with the entrance moved around the corner to Leeson Street.About the Sugar Club .

The term rate is used to identify the career field of a Chief Petty Officer. For example the rate of Master-at- Arms in the rank of Chief Petty Officer would be spoken as Master-at-Arms, Chief Petty Officer or Master-at-Arms Chief. Additionally it would be officially written MAC (Person's name), USN/R. The grade of chief petty officer was established on 1 April 1893 for the United States Navy. The United States Congress first authorized the Coast Guard to use the promotion to chief petty officer on 18 May 1920. Chief petty officer is also the final cadet grade in the United States Naval Sea Cadet Corps. Prior to 1958, chief petty officer was the highest enlisted grade in both the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard. This changed with the passage of , the Military Pay Act of 1958, which established two new pay grades of E-8 and E-9 in all five branches of the U.S. Armed Forces. In the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard, the new E-8 paygrade was called senior chief petty officer (SCPO) and the new E-9 paygrade master chief petty officer (MCPO), with the first selectees promoting to their respective grades in 1959 and 1960. Prior to establishment of the E-8 and E-9 grades, chief petty officers could typically serve in uniform for 30 or more years. Shortly following establishment of the E-8 and E-9 grades, service limits currently known as high year of tenure (HYT) were established by pay grade. Although these limits periodically flex based on Fleet manpower requirements, current HYT limits restrict chief petty officers not selected for promotion to senior chief petty officer to 24 years of service, after which they face mandatory retirement. Similar limits of 26 years for senior chief petty officer and 30 years for master chief petty officer are currently used, with a smaller core of master chief petty officers serving in command, force, and fleet master chief petty officer positions in the Navy, and area Master Chief or the Coast Guard Reserve Force Master Chief in the Coast Guard, being eligible to remain in uniform for 32 to 35 years and with the Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy and the Master Chief Petty Officer of the Coast Guard being permitted to remain in uniform until reaching 38 years of service. Role A chief petty officer gives instructions to a seaman aboard an aircraft carrier in 2013. Navy chief petty officers serve a dual role as both technical experts and as leaders, with the emphasis being more on leadership as they progress through the CPO paygrades. Like petty officers, every chief petty officer has both a rate (unlike the land and air services, rank only refers to commissioned officers in the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard) and a rating (i.e., job specialty, similar to an MOS in the U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps, or an AFSC in U.S. Air Force). A chief petty officer's full title is a combination of the two. Thus, a chief petty officer who has the rating of gunner's mate would be referred to as a chief gunner's mate (GMC).The Chief Petty Officer's Guide, John Hagan and Jack Leahy. - Naval Institute Press, 2004. Each rating has an official abbreviation, such as QM for quartermaster, BM for boatswain's mate, and FC for fire controlman. When combined with the Petty Officer level, this gives the shorthand for the chief's rate, such as BMC for chief boatswain's mate. It is not uncommon practice to refer to the chief by this shorthand in all but the most formal correspondence (such as printing and inscription on awards). Usually, chief petty officers are referred to and in conversation as \\"Chief\\" regardless of their rating. In the U.S. Navy, both commissioned officers and chief petty officers are often colloquially referred to as \\"Khakis\\". In the past, commissioned officers and chief petty officers wore khaki-colored uniforms both while onboard seagoing vessels and ashore, as opposed to petty officers and seamen, who were referred to as deckplate sailors, or blueshirts. However, since 2009, while khakis are still worn ashore, the U.S. Navy used a blue and gray camouflage working uniform which replaced the khaki-colored ones worn by commissioned officers and chief petty officers on board ships, and also adopted a new service uniform for petty officers and seamen in pay grades E-6 and below, consisting of a khaki shirt and black trousers. The latter has caused some discontent among some chief petty officers and commissioned officers as a result. In the U.S. Coast Guard, petty officers, chief petty officers, warrant officers, and commissioned officers all wear similar uniforms.  Induction  The Navy and Coast Guard are distinct among the U.S. Armed Forces in that promotion to the paygrade of E-7 traditionally has involved a set of specialized activities known collectively as \\"Initiation\\", \\"Orientation\\", \\"Induction\\" or most recently, \\"CPO 365 Phase II\\". The \\"Induction Season\\", as it was called, has been replaced by a program called CPO 365, a year-round program for first class petty officers. On January 7, 2013, the master chief petty officer of the Navy, Michael D. Stevens, announced: > \\"Effective immediately, we're respectfully sun-downing the word 'induction', > and in its place we'll use CPO 365 as the primary term. I believe that > induction is more about a moment in time, and CPO 365 and the development of > our FCPOs to become CPOs is not about a moment in time. It's about a > continuous time. This is something we're going to do every day, 365 days a > year, and so we want to make sure the term we are using is matching what we > are doing.\\" On May 30, 2017, Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy Steven Giordano announced: > \\"The process creating Chief Petty Officers should once again be referred to > as \\"Initiation\\". We are Initiating new Chief Petty Officers, and providing a > roadmap for people to be successful in life — whatever the > course.\\"https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2017/05/31/initiation-is- > back-mcpon-ends-officialdom-s-14-year-ban-on-using-the-term-for-chiefs- > training/  Advancement  Unlike petty officer first class and lower grades, advancement to chief petty officer not only carries requirements of time in service, superior evaluation scores, and specialty examinations, but also carries an added requirement of peer review. A chief petty officer can only advance after review by a selection board of serving senior and master chief petty officers, in effect \\"choosing their own\\".The Chief Petty Officer's Guide / John Hagan and Jack Leahy. Naval Institute Press, 2004. . Advancement into the chief petty officer grades is the most significant promotion within the enlisted naval grades. At the grade of chief petty officer, the Sailor takes on more administrative duties. In the Navy, their uniform changes to reflect this change of duty, becoming identical to that of an officer's uniform except with different insignia. Personnel in the three chief petty officer rates also have conspicuous privileges such as separate dining and living areas. Any naval vessel of sufficient size has a room or rooms that are off-limits to anyone not a chief (including commissioned officers), except by specific invitation. In naval jargon, this room is called the Chief's Mess. In addition, a chief petty officer is usually addressed by either their rate or as \\"Chief\\" by both subordinates and superiors upon advancement to the grade. Deckplate leaders  In naval terminology, the deckplate can roughly refer to the deck (\\"flooring\\"), or the area of the deck of a ship or boat (submarine). It can also refer to the Division Officer and chief petty officer leadership.http://www.dcmilitary.com/stories/071708/trident_28221.shtml The term deckplate leaders is a colloquial term referring to the senior enlisted personnel of the grade of chief petty officer and higher. They are generally charged with keeping good order and discipline within the lower enlisted grades.  Insignia and emblem  U.S. Navy left sleeve insignia for a Chief Yeoman on Service Dress Blue/Full Dress Blue or Dinner Dress Blue Jacket Rate insignia in the Navy and Coast Guard are mostly identical. A chief petty officer's rate insignia is a perched eagle with spread wings (often affectionately referred to as a \\"crow\\") above three chevrons topped by a rocker. The rating emblem is displayed below the crow, within the area bordered by the rocker and the uppermost chevron. The chevrons and rocker are either red or gold. In the Navy enlisted members with at least 12 consecutive years of good conduct service in the armed forces wear gold chevrons. The Coast Guard does not have such a rule; a Coast Guard chief petty officer's sleeve insignia is always gold, and rates below chief petty officer are always red. On the dress blue uniform (and variants such as mess whites), the insignia is worn on the left arm of the uniform blouse (or \\"suit coat\\" in civilian terminology). On all other uniforms other than the Type III Navy Working Uniform, the insignia used is worn on the collar and has become universally accepted as the symbol of the chief petty officer, which is a fouled (entwined in the anchor chain) gold anchor superimposed with the letters \\"USN\\" in silver in the Navy, or a silver shield in the Coast Guard. A U.S. Navy chief petty officer's rate emblem is symbolized by a fouled anchor with the letters \\"USN\\" centered on the anchor. A U.S. Coast Guard chief petty officer's rate emblem is symbolized by a fouled anchor with a shield superimposed on its shank. The anchor is emblematic of \\"the chief\\" and represents stability and security. It serves to remind the chief petty officer of their responsibility to keep those they serve safe from harm's way. The significance of the shield date to the days of the Revenue Cutter Service when Congress added the shield to the ensign of the Cutter Service to distinguish cutters from other naval vessels. The chain is symbolic of flexibility and strength and serves to remind the chief petty officer that the chain of life is forged day-by-day, link-by-link. The chain also represents the reliance of one chief petty officer on another to get the job done and reminds him not to be the weak link in the chain. The chain fouled around the anchor represents \\"the Sailor's disgrace\\" and serves to remind chief petty officers that there may be times when circumstances are beyond their control in the performance of their duty, but a chief petty officer must complete the task.

It is most characterized by an increase in interactions with white blood cells (leukocytes), and it is associated with the early states of atherosclerosis and sepsis, among others. It is also implicated in the formation of deep vein thrombosis. As a result of activation, enthothelium releases Weibel–Palade bodies.  Mechanical sensing and responses  Elevating shear stress induces a vascular response by triggering nitric oxide synthesis and mechanotransduction pathways of endothelial cells. The synthesis of nitric oxide facilitate shear stress mediated dilation in blood vessels and maintains a homeostatic status. Additionally, physiologic shear stress levels at the vessel wall upregulate the presence of antithrombotic agents through the mechano-signal transduction of mechano-recepting transmembrane proteins, junctional proteins, and subendothelial mechanosensors. Shear stress causes endothelial cell deformation which activates transmembrane ion channels Elevated wall shear stress caused by exercise is understood to promote mitochondrial biogenesis in the vascular endothelium indicating the benefits regular exercise may have on vascular function. Alignment is recognized as an important mechanism and determinant of shear-stress induced vascular response; in vivo testing of endothelial cells has demonstrated that their mechanotransductive response is direction dependent as endothelial nitric oxide synthesis is preferentially activated under parallel flow while perpendicular flows activates inflammatory pathways like reactive oxygen species production and nuclear factor-κB. Therefore, disturbed/oscillating flow and low flow conditions, which create an irregular and passive shear stress environment, result in inflammatory activation due to a limited alignment capability of the endothelial cells. Regions in the vasculature with low shear stress are vulnerable to elevated monocyte adhesion and endothelial cell apoptosis. However, unlike oscillatory flow, both laminar(steady) and pulsatile flow and shear stress environments are often considered together as mechanisms of maintaining vascular homeostasis and preventing inflammation, reactive oxygen species formation, and coagulatory pathways. High, uniform laminar shear stress is known to promote a quiescent endothelial cell state, provide anti-thrombotic effects, prevent proliferation, and decrease inflammation and apoptosis. At high shear stress levels (10 Pa), the endothelial cell response is distinct from upper normal/physiological values; high wall shear stress causes a promatrix remodeling, proliferative, anticoagulant, and anti-inflammatory state. Yet, very high wall shear stress values (28.4 Pa) prevent endothelial cell alignment and stimulate proliferation and apoptosis although the endothelial response to shear stress environments was determined to be dependent on the local wall shear stress gradient.

Known for her work in statistical thermodynamics, solid state NMR and chemical education, she is a fellow of the American Physical Society, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the Massachusetts Academy of Sciences. She is the author or coauthor of more than 180 scientific papers and a book. Research contributions Although trained as a theoretician, Herzfeld's interest in biophysics led her to also establish an experimental program. For the first two decades, her theoretical program focused on the spontaneous spatial ordering of self-assembled protein filaments in the crowded interiors of cells and its implications for the morphology and rheology of cells in health and in disease (e.g., sickle-cell disease). More recently, her theoretical program has focused on developing an explicit valence electron force field (LEWIS) for efficient modeling of reactions in complex solvents, so that detailed computer simulations can provide insights into solvent influences on reaction mechanisms, rates and selectivity. Her experimental program applies solid state NMR spectroscopy to problems that are intractable by other structural methods. A long-term study has focused on the mechanism by which the membrane protein bacteriorhodopsin executes ion transfers that convert light energy to electrochemical form. A more recent study on the flotation organelles of aquatic micro-organisms has revealed that an amyloid pattern of protein assembly underlies their strength and interfacial stability. Other studies have elucidated the structures of amorphous polymers that form under prebiotic conditions. In the course of solving some of the practical problems involved in this work, she has also developed some methods that have been adopted by other spectroscopists. This includes spinning sideband analysis to extract local anisotropy information, and spectroscopy by the integration of frequency and time domain information (SIFT) to carryout rapid, model-free processing of non-uniformly sampled spin evolution. Pedagogical contributions Given the large choice of excellent textbooks covering the standard topics, lecturing in general chemistry is mostly redundant. Furthermore, the recent pedagogical literature concludes that active learning improves understanding and retention. To thoroughly implement active learning in large chemistry classes, Herzfeld adopted the Peer Instruction method pioneered by Eric Mazur and developed a large, widely used set of ConcepTests that thoroughly covers the content of general chemistry. In further pursuit of active learning, she also designed some games to play through complex chemical scenarios and some drawing exercises that assist in visualizing the variables underlying chemical behavior. As a broad survey of \\"the central science\\", general chemistry also provides an opportunity to tell the story of how our material world came to be as we find it today. Herzfeld has reorganized and updated a highly regarded general chemistry textbook according to this narrative, divided in six stages, from the condensation of fundamental particles into elements and molecules, through the formation of a planet blessed with water and sunshine, to the advent of life and the changes that human kind has wrought since the start of the industrial revolution. This approach is particularly suited to liberal arts colleges interested in bringing reflection on the human condition into the physical sciences. Biography The first born of young German-Jewish refugees, Herzfeld received her primary and secondary education in New York City public schools, supplemented by the resources of the city's public libraries, parks and museums, and by the Girl Scouts of the USA. (She is a firm believer in the power of well-run public institutions.) She first became attracted to the sciences in an accelerated and enriched junior high school program mounted by the city in response to Sputnik, began research during her last summer in high school (with Murray Goodman at the then Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute), and won the First Army Prize at the National Science Fair during her senior year. She received her university education at Barnard College of Columbia University (bachelor’s in chemistry 1967, advisor Bernice Segal), MIT (doctorate in chemical physics 1972, departmental advisor Robert Silbey, thesis advisor H. Eugene Stanley) and the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University (master’s in public policy 1973). She began her independent work as a tenure track Assistant Professor of Chemistry at Amherst College in 1973, the first woman appointed to the faculty in the natural sciences at the then still all-male college. A year later she resigned to marry her future husband Robert Griffin. Moving back to Boston, she took a position at Harvard Medical School, first as a member of the Biophysical Laboratory (led by Arthur K. Solomon) and then as a member of the Department of Physiology and Biophysics. There she represented her colleagues on the Faculty Council, served on the Faculty Docket Committee, and chaired the Joint Committee on the Status of Women of the Harvard Schools of Medicine, Dental Medicine and Public Health. Her two daughters were born during those years. In 1985 she moved to the Department of Chemistry at Brandeis University where her service has included two terms as a faculty senator, one term as the department chair (the first woman in that role in the natural sciences), and four terms as a faculty representative to the Board of Trustees.  Family  Herzfeld is married to Robert Guy Griffin and they have two daughters, Sarah R. Griffin and Rachel H. Griffin.

They were built around a cul-de-sac that exited east onto 14th Street. No garages or driveways were part of the original concept, and today only four garages have been built in the years since. One of the bungalows was torn down in 1993 and the empty lot remains. with Architecture There is a conscious arrangement to the bungalows in the district. The houses feature a double gable on the main façade of the structure. Each house has a mirror image twin that is positioned opposite or diagonal from it. Lot sizes and shape vary depending on where it is located on the cul-de-sac. The lot widths are between 40 and 45 feet, and lengths are between 70 and 147 feet.

It is native to northern North America, where its distribution extends across Alaska and most of Canada.Esser, Lora L. 1992. Salix arbusculoides. In: Fire Effects Information System, [Online]. U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Fire Sciences Laboratory. This willow is a shrub or tree growing up to 9 meters tall. It has many branches with smooth gray or reddish brown bark. The leaves are up to 7.5 centimeters long and often have a thin coat of hairs on the undersides. Immature leaves have thicker coats of hair and are paler and yellowish in color. The leaves have toothed edges that are studded with glands that function as resin glands as well as hydathodes.Salix arbusculoides. Flora of North America. This species is dioecious, with male and female catkins borne on separate individuals. The flowers are pollinated by insects, especially bees. This plant grows in forests and open meadows. It dominates or codominates willow communities, particularly in interior Alaska and parts of the Northwest Territories. It can grow on tundra above the timberline. It is often found near rivers and streams and on floodplains, forming dense thickets near water. It can be found in spruce woodlands and muskegs. Associated species include black spruce (Picea mariana), white spruce (Picea glauca), paper birch (Betula papyrifera), resin birch (Betula glandulosa), mountain alder (Alnus viridis crispa), thinleaf alder (Alnus incana tenuifolia), Scouler willow (Salix scouleriana), Bebb willow (Salix bebbiana), bluejoint reedgrass (Calamagrostis canadensis), cladonia lichens, sedges, and mosses. This is an early seral species which colonizes freshly disturbed habitat, such as floodplains recently scoured by floodwaters. The seeds germinate immediately when they are deposited upon moist substrate, and the plant grows best on wet alluvium. It also commonly sprouts up in recently burned areas. It can grow on other types of disturbed habitat, such as roadsides and mine sites. It does not tolerate shade and will be shaded out as the habitat transitions to forest when other trees begin to grow. This plant provides food for many animals, such as moose, deer, caribou, snowshoe hares, beavers, and small mammals and birds. It is especially palatable to moose, and it is nutritious. The plant also provides cover when it forms dense thickets. When it grows along waterways it provides overhangs for fish to hide under. Medicinal uses This plant was used medicinally by the Eskimo for ailments such as skin sores and watery eyes.Salix arbusculoides. University of Michigan Ethnobotany. Native Americans used parts of willows, including this species, for medicinal purposes, basket weaving, to make bows and arrows, and for building animal traps.

Returning to the Scott again in 1992, Dolan and team finished round robin with a 4–7 record. Dolan once again returned to the Scott in 1995; this time she played third for Rebecca Jean MacPhee. This new team found success, and for the first time, Dolan made it to the playoffs at the Scott. The team finished fourth in round robin with an 8–3 record. The team lost the 3-4 game to Alberta’s Cathy Borst. At the 1997 Scott Tournament of Hearts, playing third for MacPhee, the team finished round robin with a 5-6 record, failing to regain a playoff spot. Dolan’s next appearance at the Scott came in 1999, playing third for MacPhee. The team finished with a 6–5 record and failed to reach the playoffs. =2000–current= In 2002 Dolan was asked to play fifth for Kathy O'Rourke, who would represent Prince Edward Island at the Scott. This was the first time Dolan would make a trip to the Scott without qualifying. O'Rourke’s squad would finish 3-8 in round robin play. In 2004, Dolan would win the Provincial Mixed Curling Championships. Dolan would finish round robin of the 2005 Canadian Mixed Curling Championships with a 3-8 record. In 2005, Dolan, now playing third for O'Rourke, would fail to qualify at the provincial level. She was asked by Rebecca Jean MacPhee, who won the 2005 Prince Edward Island Scott Tournament of Hearts, to accompany the team as their fifth. MacPhee’s team would finish round robin with a 4-7 record. In 2008, Dolan would make a different appearance at the Scotties. She was asked by Suzanne Gaudet to not only be the fifth, but also accompany the team to the Nationals as their coach. The team would finish round robin with a 3-8 record. At the 2012 Prince Edward Island Scotties Tournament of Hearts, Dolan would win her first provincial championship in 13 years, bringing the total number of provincial championships nine. She would defeat defending campion Suzanne Birt in round robin, three time junior champion Sarah Fullerton in the semi- final and four time junior champion Meaghan Hughes in the final. This was also a historic win for Dolan, as for the first time in Prince Edward Island women’s play, a mother and daughter, (Sinead Dolan), would win a championship together. Dolan would play in her final Scotties, at the 2012 Scotties Tournament of Hearts, where she would finish round robin with a 3-8 record. Her final game in Draw 16, would mark Dolan's 100th game at the Scotties. She would defeat New Brunswick's Rebecca Atkinson 11-4.

He was born to wealth and privilege, and acquired a peerage, but due to his loyalty to the English Crown he suffered considerable hardship during the English Civil War, and died in poverty. Background He was born in Dublin, probably at Merrion Castle, eldest of the five sons of Sir Richard FitzWiliam, Constable of Wicklow, and Jane Preston, daughter of Christopher Preston, 4th Viscount Gormanston.Ball, F. Elrington History of Dublin Alexander Thom and Co. Dublin 1902-1920 Vol.2 p.11 The FitzWilliam family are recorded in Dublin from about 1210, and by the time of Thomas's birth they were among the wealthiest and most influential families in the Pale. Early career Thomas was only fourteen when his father died. As a young man he spent some time in London studying law at Gray's Inn. He was knighted in 1605, the year of his marriage. In 1608 he narrowly avoided being caught up in the rebellion of Sir Cahir O'Doherty, having stood surety for the good behaviour of O'Doherty, who had married Thomas's aunt Mary Preston.Ball, p.12 A messenger arrived at Merrion Castle ordering FitzWilliam to produce the person of O'Doherty; fortunately FitzWilliam was not at home. He was knighted the same year, and served as Sheriff of County Dublin in 1609. In 1610 he received a substantial grant of land in County Armagh from the English Crown. No doubts seem to have been entertained about his own loyalty to the Crown, except perhaps during the latter part of the English Civil War, In 1629 King Charles I created him Viscount FitzWilliam in recognition of his family's long record of service to the Crown.Cokayne Complete Peerage 6 volumes. Reissued 2000 Vol. 5, p. 527 It appears that a good deal was expected in return for the title, and Thomas had to make substantial gifts of money to the King. This put a particular burden on his estates since he was involved in protracted litigation with his numerous brothers and sisters, due to his father's breaking of an entail on the estates, which benefitted Thomas at the expense of his siblings. Admittedly Thomas himself had been the beneficiary of a generous Crown grant of land in Armagh. Like nearly all of his family he inclined to the Roman Catholic faith, while adhering in public to the Church of Ireland; later generations of Fitzwilliams were quite open in their support for the Catholic religion. Civil war and last years When the Irish Rebellion of 1641 broke out, FitzWilliam, unlike many of the nobility of the Pale, remained loyal to the Crown, despite strong pressure from his mother's family, the Prestons of Gormanston, to join the Irish Confederacy.Ball, p.13 He was one of only three nobles to offer their assistance in the Royalist defence of Dublin, and a garrison was placed in Merrion Castle. It was betrayed in June 1642 and thereafter FitzWilliam only lived there for short periods. He offered his services to the Lords Justices, but despite his long record of loyalty to the Crown he was rebuffed, apparently on account of his known leanings towards the Roman Catholic religion, and he took no further part in the fighting. He spent some time in England, where the King received him courteously. He was promised an English Earldom, but the promise was not kept. He returned to Ireland, only to discover that he had been outlawed]. In his last years he led an unsettled existence, living sometimes at Merrion Castle, sometimes with his eldest son at Howth, and sometimes in Louth. At times he seems to have been almost destitute, and he wrote to James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde in 1647 asking for repayment of a debt. In 1648 he was promised a pension of £100 a year, but it is unclear if he ever received it.Ball, p.16 Due perhaps to the confused conditions of the English Civil War, little seems to be known about the date and place of his death. Even the year has been disputed, but is generally stated to be 1650. He was certainly dead before 1655 when his eldest surviving son Oliver was allowed to inherit a part of the estates, though most of them were not restored until 1663.Ball, p.18 Family In 1605 he married Margaret Plunkett, daughter of Oliver Plunkett, 4th Baron Louth and his wife Frances, who was the daughter of Nicholas Bagenal and Eleanor Griffith, and sister of Henry Bagenal and of Mabel, Countess of Tyrone.Cokayne Complete Peerage, p. 527 They had four sons: *Richard, who predeceased his father: He married Elizabeth Stanihust but had no children; *Oliver FitzWilliam, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell, he was married three times but had no children; *Christopher, who lived mainly in England: he married Jane Brereton of Malpas (whose sister Dorothy was his brother Oliver's first wife) and had one surviving daughter but no son; *William FitzWilliam, 3rd Viscount FitzWilliam, ancestor of all succeeding Viscounts Fitzwilliam. He married Mary Luttrell and had six children.

He studied at the Rijksakademie in Amsterdam. His multimedia practice encompasses video, installation, drawing, painting and sculpture. He works on obsolete materials and their uncertain futures, he criticizes the illusory mechanisms that bind humanity to technology, ideologies and their influences in a society in crisis. In 2006, he won the Uriöt prize, Amsterdam, the grand prize of the Dakar Biennial and the Cairo Biennial Award in 2010.Lillian Davies, Mounir Fatmi: Suspect Language, Milan: Skira, 2012, 205p. Biography = Childhood = Mounir Fatmi was born in Tangier, Morocco, in 1970. He spent his childhood in the district of Casabarata,Tangier#Notable landmarks playing in the giant flea market, where his mother sold clothes for children. The flea market, a chaotic world where everyday consumer goods, images and sounds abound, it is seen by the artist as an open-air museum in ruins, full of obsolete and abandoned objects and becomes soon his first art school. In 1975 his family moved to Casablanca, first in the district of the Old Medina, street of the consulate of England, district called La Croix- Rouge. During his adolescence he discovers the city and its architecture: the Sidi Bousmara square, the Sidi Allal Karouani mausoleum, the Zaouiat Darkaouia, the Imperial cinema, the Central Hotel, the fortifications of the Sqala, the Zerktouni garden. = Artistic education = In 1987, he leaves Morocco and his family environment to go to Italy. He enrolled as a student at the Free School of Nude and Engraving at the Academy of Fine ArtsAccademia di Belle Arti di Roma in Rome. During the years of his artistic studies he questions the issue of individual identity and begins to reflect on the role of the artist in a society in crisis. In 1989, back in Casablanca, he attended the art school for one single term. When he returns to Tangier in 1990, he is interested in the architecture of his childhood home and some decorative elements that will mark him visibly: a photograph of King Mohammed V, an Arabic calligraphy and a copy of the Koran that he was forbidden to touch when he was a child. Here, he meet the Moroccan writer Mohamed Choukri who introduces him to the American writer Paul Bowles, thanks to whom he discovers the writings of Brion Gysin, William S. Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac and Jean Genet. The discovery of the Beat Generation literature is a great source of artistic and intellectual inspiration and it is what opens the door to the desire to travel and experiment. The same year, he make his first installations and research in video, as well as his first major series of paintings, Fragile / Communication (1990-1996). = Professional career =  1990-1995  In 1990 he works as artistic director in an advertising agency in Casablanca. By promoting consumer products, he experiments the rhetorical power of advertising and the influence of images on the consumer public and he develops a critical awareness of the aesthetic strategies of communication and information flow. He begins the iconographic project The Fourth Cover, inspired by his professional experience and advertising rhetoric. In 1993 he receives the first prize at the 3rd Biennial of Young Moroccan Painting, for the serie Fragile / Communication and on this occasion he meets Catherine David, president of the jury.

He begins the series of paintings No Witness and Obliteration Memorizing. Spectators are invited to contemplate the works done before they are covered with several layers of white paint. The performance establishes a clear line of separation between \\"Those who have seen\\" and \\"Those who have not seen\\" the works before their erasure. The witnesses of the paintings are finally photographed and their portraits are placed alongside the works stamped Painted, Seen, Erased. A year later, he realizes the Coma performance, during which canvases were shown to witnesses before being wrapped and packed in clear plastic covers. In the meantime, he finishes the video Arabesque, a tribute to Jackson Pollock, and he wins the Audience Award at the 4th Casablanca Video Art Festival. He starts traveling all over Europe, winning prizes and special mentions for his videos.

Work  Mounir Fatmi’s work deals with the historical matters, religious objects and their desecration, dismantling dogmas and ideologies and the relation of death with the subject of consumption. His installations and films have the specificity to be produced with archaic and outdated material, such as VHS tapes. Mounir Fatmi is largely influenced by September 11 attacks. He produced a series of installations named Save Manhattan. These artworks show the Manhattan skyline including the destroyed World Trade Center towers. Save Manhattan 1 is made with books, Save Manhattan with videotapes and Save Manhattan 3 is a sound installation with speakers. The ultimate contribution to this project is a video where the skyline progressively dissolves itself in distorted liquefied reflection. Many of Mounir Fatmi’s works are seen as subversive, such as his Brainteaser for moderate Muslim, a series of Rubik's Cubes painted in black with white stripes to imitate the Kaaba in Mecca.

He is considered important enough as a musician that he was recognized nationally at a tribute concert in 2013, an event that was a \\"tribute from his peers for a rich career.\\"  Biography  rebáb. Abdelkader Chaou studied at the Conservatory of Algiers (staying in 1967), led at the time by Hadj Mohamed El Anka. His purpose in attending the conservatory was not to imitate El Anka, who he calls \\"the Master\\", but to learn technique, how to play the instruments of Chaabi and the rules of the music. While there he learned how to play the violin, mondol, oud, piano, qanoûn, rebab, and derbuka (goblet drum). Besides El Anka, other musicians who he credited with having an impact on his musical education as career included Mehdi Tamache, Cherchem, Ahcen Said, and Mahboub Bati. Mahboub Bati is the educator who took charge of his later education. He modernized chaâbi to make its style more alive and attractive. Chaou's career began to show signs of success in the 1970s with the songs \\"Ghazali Goudami\\" and \\"Lilah wan cheftou koudami\\" in 1970, and \\"Djah rebi ya djirani\\" in 1973. His influence on modernizing Chaabi has had mixed reception. Some have accused him of distorting the music, while others, such as Mahboub Bati, Mahboub Stambouli, and Skandrani, have embraced it. His musical repertoire contains both \\"light\\" cheerful songs as well as sad, borrowed from the Iberian or Andalusian music tradition.

The music of the film was entirely composed by Dionysos. The original French language version, Jack et la mécanique du cœur, which translates literally as Jack and the Mechanics of the Heart, was released in October 2013, with English-, German-, Finnish- and Spanish-language versions following in 2014. Summary In Edinburgh, Scotland 1887, Jack is born on the coldest day ever. Due to the extreme cold he is born with a frozen heart which will not beat. The attendant midwife Madeleine saves his life by replacing his heart with a fragile but working cuckoo clock. She then advises him of three rules to prevent his untimely death: he must never play with the hands of the clock, lose his temper, or fall in love. Jack's mother, for reasons known only to her, quickly decides her child would be better raised by Madeleine and departs, leaving Jack. Madeleine, incapable of bearing children of her own, raises and loves him as her own. On Jack's tenth birthday, Madeleine repeats the three rules before taking him into town for the first time. He meets a girl in town named Miss Acacia and becomes infatuated with her. After starting school shortly afterward, he also meets Joe, a bully who is in love with Miss Acacia as well. Jealous, the older boy and his gang of students torment Jack for the next four years. During an assault from Joe, the cuckoo of Jack's clock heart gouges Joe's eye, and Jack runs home believing he had murdered Joe. Madeleine, believing Jack to be a fugitive, helps him to escape. Jack only wants to see Miss Acacia again and eventually meets up with Georges Méliès, a magician attempting to operate an early film camera. Georges helps repair his heart and agrees to join Jack in the search for Miss Acacia. They proceed to Andalusia, Spain in search of her. After a long journey they arrive at a circus in Andalusia. Jack finds Miss Acacia but Georges advises him against revealing his identity to her. He proceeds to befriend her and foolishly avoids sharing his feelings. She hints that her heart belongs to someone from her past. It turns out that Jack was that person from her past. Jack eventually finds a way to reveal himself and gives a key to Miss Acacia which can be used to wind his heart. Before Jack and Miss Acacia could run away together, Joe, the bully from Jack's past, shows up. He had been looking for an opportunity to further punish Jack and explains to her the three rules of Jack's cuckoo clock heart in an attempt to sabotage them. Miss Acacia, after talking with Joe, decides she doesn't want to risk being the cause of death of Jack by allowing him to fall in love. She rejects him, and leaves with Joe. Jack, after being rejected, tears at the screws of his heart. In the carriage with Miss Acacia and Joe, he tells her that soon after Jack escaped with Madeleine's help, Madeleine was sent to prison. There, she died soon afterwards. Rumors said that she died of a broken heart. Miss Acacia eventually realizes she holds the key to Jack's survival and returns to search for him. She finds out quickly Jack had departed for home in Edinburgh and follows behind him. She knows she has only a short time to reach him. When he reaches home, he is told what happened to Madeleine. They also tell him that Jack gave her the joy of being a mother and she worried at the thought of how he will grow up. Miss Acacia finds Jack in front of Madeleine's grave, shivering in the cold. She tries to use the key to turn his clock but he throws away the key, choosing to die from not using the key. Then they finally kiss. When Jack breaks the kiss, time has stopped for him. Jack sings a song about climbing to Heaven while using the frozen snowflakes as a ladder, ascending into the sky as the film fades to black and ends the movie.

There were a number of different engine capacities to suit different sections of the market. The bike was primarily released to compete with the ever-popular Honda Super Cub. It is also very similar to the Suzuki FR50.  Model V overview  Delivery driver riding a Yamaha V step through one handed In order of engine capacity and model: #Yamaha V50 #Yamaha V50P #Yamaha V50M #Yamaha V70 #Yamaha V75 #Yamaha V80 #Yamaha V80M #Yamaha V90 The Yamaha V series was advertised as an inexpensive and reliable moped/motorbike that was easy to use. The V series actually started in the early 1970s with the initial line up of the V50, V70 and V90. Then branched out to different variations in the mid 1970s with the V50p (to replace the V50) and V75 and then in the late 1970s added the V80. In early 1980, Yamaha discontinued the V70, V75, V90 and the original V80 models and introduced two new models, the V50M and the V80M. Thus reducing the number of models to two. The M in the name was to differentiate them from the earlier models In 1985, the V range of step-through motorbikes were discontinued completely, being replaced by the Townmate series of Yamaha step-through motorbikes which carried on selling until some time in the early to mid 1990s in the UK.  Differences between the V50s  Throughout the V series' lifetime there were three different variations of the V50. The reason for the different models was that Yamaha needed to change the moped to comply with changing laws on the 50 cc moped in the UK. = V50 = This was the first Yamaha V50 and was one of the first models to be sold along with the V70 and the V90. The original V50 had a two- stroke engine with a three speed semi-automatic gearbox and could reach speeds of about . The problem with this model was that in the UK in the early 1970s to ride a 50 cc moped on a learner licence the bike needed to have pedals. So Yamaha decided to change the V50 model to the V50p, so it could be ridden on L-plates (in the UK). = V50P = The P in Yamaha V50P stood for pedals and was released in the UK in 1975, now that it had pedals it could be bought and used on L-plates. The bike itself was almost exactly the same to the original V50 but instead of having the standard footrests it had pedals that could move the bike when the engine was off. It still had the same engine with the 3-speed semi-automatic gearbox and still able to reach speeds of around 35–40 mph. In 1977, the law changed in the UK on what a moped was, so Yamaha released the next model of V50 in 1980. = V50M = The V50M was the last revision of the V50. It had a slight redesign with a different faring, a square headlight and a new speedometer with built in fuel gauge. The main difference was that this model had a two-speed automatic gearbox with high and low ratios and had a restricted top speed of . The model changed because of the new law in the UK that defining a moped. Under the new law all new 50 cc mopeds were restricted to 30 mph.

Although written for law enforcement use, it is freely available and can be used as a general data recovery tool.  History  Foremost was created in March 2001 to duplicate the functionality of the DOS program CarvThis for use on the Linux platform. Foremost was originally written by Special Agents Kris Kendall and Jesse Kornblum of the U.S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations. In 2005, the program was modified by Nick Mikus, a research associate at the Naval Postgraduate School's Center for Information Systems Security Studies and Research as part of a master's thesis. These modifications included improvements to Foremost's accuracy and extraction rates.  Functionality  Foremost is designed to ignore the type of underlying filesystem and directly read and copy portions of the drive into the computer's memory. It takes these portions one segment at a time, and using a process known as file carving searches this memory for a file header type that matches the ones found in Foremost's configuration file. When a match is found, it writes that header and the data following it into a file, stopping when either a footer is found, or until the file size limit is reached. Foremost is used from the command-line interface, with no graphical user interface option available. It is able to recover specific filetypes, including jpg, gif, png, bmp, avi, exe, mpg, wav, riff, wmv, mov, pdf, ole, doc, zip, rar, htm, and cpp. There is a configuration file (usually found at ) which can be used to define additional file types. Foremost can be used to recover data from image files, or directly from hard drives that use the ext3, NTFS, or FAT filesystems. Foremost can also be used via a computer to recover data from iPhones.

Howard's sword and sorcery hero Conan the Barbarian. It was first published in paperback by Tor Books in June 1982 and reprinted in July 1990; a trade paperback edition followed from the same publisher in 1998. The first British edition was published in paperback by Sphere Books in September 1989; a later British edition was published in paperback by Legend Books in August 1996. It was later gathered together with Conan the Defender and Conan the Unconquered into the hardcover omnibus collection The Conan Chronicles (Tor Books, July 1995). Plot summary Amanar the Necromancer, in his lair in the Kezankian Mountains, sacrifices to his demonic patron, Morath- Aminee, for protection against the Black Ring, a league of sorcerers he has betrayed. Meanwhile, in a Shadizar tavern, Conan mulls over prospects for his next theft, in between incidental quarrels with one woman and the rescue of another who fails to thank him. He is hired by a supposed merchant to steal some pendants in the possession of the King of Zamora. The merchant is actually Imhep-Aton, an agent of the Black Ring, who intends on using these artifacts against Amanar. The Cimmerian makes an attempt on the palace, convincing the slave girl Velita to help him steal the pendants in exchange for her freedom, but the heist is interrupted and the alarm sounded. He escapes, but finds the next morning that the pendants and Velita have been stolen by someone else. He sets out in pursuit, along with, unknown to him, the king's cavalry and Imhep-Aton, who assumes Conan himself has absconded with the goods. At a desert oasis, Conan saves a woman from bandits—the same, surprisingly, he had earlier aided in the tavern—and with her continues his pursuit of the caravan. He catches up to what he believes is it, only to have the woman reveal herself as the infamous raider Karela the Red Hawk, and the band he has discovered as hers. Karela's men overpower the Cimmerian and take him prisoner. However, Conan ingratiates himself with the raiders, and together they resume the pursuit of the caravan, while they themselves continue to be pursued by the Zamorans and the agent of the Black Ring. Karela's band, trapped between tribal hillmen and the Zamoran cavalry, slip away to let their adversaries fight each other, before coming under attack by Amanar's reptilian underlings. Fighting them off, they track the reptilian creatures towards Amanar's keep. The necromancer attempts guile, entertaining Conan and Karela, while claiming no knowledge of the girl or the pendants, and offering to hire them. Conan, distrustful, returns by night and discovers Velita, but an enchantment prevents her from being removed from the stronghold. Conan ends up in Amanar's dungeon together with several others, including Karela's lieutenant and the Zamoran captain. Together, they plan an escape. They make their break in time to see Amanar's keep stormed by an army of hillmen. In the chaos, Conan and Imhep-Aton both assault Amanar as he summons Morath-Aminee. The Eater of Souls destroys Imhep-Aton and Amanar as well, but is slain in turn by the necromancer's spells. With their deaths, the castle collapses, but Conan rescues Velita and escapes. Karela, who had been ensorceled by Amanar, also gets away. Conan, having freed Velita as promised, comes upon Karela captured by slavers and bound to be sold. Reminding her of the promise she extracted from him not to aid her, he rides on, leaving her. Reception Ryan Harvey calls this, Jordan's first Conan novel, an \\"excellent first venture into the Hyborian Age,\\" as well as \\"pulpily exciting and one of the few pastiches from the Tor books that I recommend to people who normally avoid non-Howard Conan.\\" He rates it above Conan the Defender, Jordan's second venture, which he considers \\"a lesser novel.\\"Harvey, Ryan. \\"Pastiches ‘R’ Us: Conan the Defender\\" (Review), December 8, 2009.

Like his previous book The Void Captain's Tale, Child of Fortune takes place three or four thousand years in the future in an era called the Second Starfaring Age. It is a coming of age story about a young girl's wanderjahr, a rite of passage that all adolescents in the Second Starfaring Age are expected to undertake before they become adults. Critical reaction to the book was mixed, with some critics dissatisfied with Spinrad's long ornate polyglot writing. Others were more positive, finding the difficult language worth the effort. Plot The book is presented as an autobiographical tale, CHILD OF FORTUNE, A Historie of the Second Starfaring Age by Wendi Shasta Leonardo, and it includes an introduction written by the fictional narrator. Adolescents in the Second Starfaring Age are expected to embark on a journey of self-discovery called a wanderjahr, \\"the eternal journey from childhood to maturity through the wondrous and terrible chaos of the region between.\\" The wanderers are known as \\"Children of Fortune\\", and their culture contains elements of the carnivalesque and 1960s flower Children. The wanderjahr is typically a fairly long journey that only ends when the wanderer adopts her adult name (her freenom) and chooses her life's work. Some never complete this rite of passage, and remain Children of Fortune their whole lives. The novel is the story of Wendi Shasta Leonardo's wanderjahr. The story begins when Wendi (known by her childhood name Moussa) leaves her home planet, Glade, with only a return ticket home, a small amount of spending money, and a sex- enhancing ring. She travels to the planet-sized city of Edoku, where she quickly burns through all her money and becomes a mendicant. She is adopted by a group of Children of Fortune known as the Gypsy Jokers. Moussa falls in love with the leader of the Gypsy Jokers, Pater Pan, who teaches her the art of ruespieling (story-telling) and gives her the name Sunshine. After the abrupt disappearance of Pater Pan, Sunshine leaves Edoku with a wealthy Child of Fortune named Guy Vlad Boca. They sample the hedonistic life of the Honored Passengers aboard the interstellar Void Ships and eventually arrive on the planet Belshazaar. On Belshazzar, there is a large forest known as the Bloomenwald, which is the source of a plethora of naturally occurring psychedelic drugs. The trees use intoxicants to induce mammals to perform pollination duties, and many Children of Fortune are trapped by the forest ecosystem. Through her force of will, Sunshine is able to lead a group back to reality. This becomes the basis for her first original composition as a ruespieler, \\"The Pied Piper of the Bloomenwald\\". Sunshine's tale attracts the attention of an author who convinces her to go find Pater Pan, so that the story will have an ending. Sunshine finds Pater Pan addicted to the Charge, a kind of electronic drug. As he is dying, she experiences his entire life story in a kind of ecstatic vision. Sunshine ends her wanderjahr and adopts the freenom Wendi. Style and themes In a 1999 interview, Spinrad spoke about his use of language in his \\"far-future\\" novels, Child of Fortune and The Void Captain's Tale: \\"In these books, people speak this kind of mélange language of human languages, to the point where everybody speaks their own dialect of this common language – their own sprach of lingo, I call it. I hasten to say, these books are at least 80% in English! But in Void Captain's Tale, the starship captain speaks a more Germanic form, and in Child of Fortune it's more latinate and Italian.\\" Critic Wendy Erisman saw Child of Fortune as a work of utopian science fiction. Spinrad's wanderjahr is a prototypical rite of passage that takes place in three stages: separation, margin, and reintegration. Traditional \\"stagnant\\" utopias are based on oppressive social controls, but the freedom or the \\"margin\\" phase of the wanderjahr \\"becomes an impetus for creativity and social change\\" that allows young people to take their place in a constantly evolving utopia. Spinrad has called the book \\"an Anarchist novel, because there's no government\\". Criticism The book reviewer H. Kirchhoff felt that \\"[f]or all its invention and flash, the book is irretrievably marred by Spinrad's arch, self-consciously ornate language.\\" A common criticism was that the book was too long and \\"overblown\\". A short review in the Los Angeles Times was guardedly positive: \\"Entertaining if you read it in long stretches, but picking up the rhythm of the in-house jargon, a pastiche of German, French, Spanish and Hindu (I believe) takes some getting used to.\\" The New York Times was also mostly positive, stating that the difficult language was \\"worth the effort\\".

The road from the Green to the A134 was known as Madges Lane and was also known as The Drove Lane. There was also a lost lane (still marked by the hedge) known as The W(i)elde Lane that ran north-east from the Green. Listed buildings English Heritage lists two Grade II Listed buildings within the hamlet of Lawshall Green: * Pond Cottage - An eighteenth/nineteenth century lump building that has been plastered. The roof is thatched with two dormers on the front and a central square chimney stack. The gable is weather-boarded. It was formerly two cottages. Images of England * The Howes - An eighteenth- century timber-framed house extended and turned into two cottages in the nineteenth century, with sympathetic twentieth century extensions at the east end. The roof is thatched and now has three sloping roofed dormers and a central chimney stack. Images of England * Trees Farmhouse - An early-mid sixteenth timber-framed and plastered house, with later additions to the north elevations, forming an L-shaped plan. The house was re-roofed, probably in the eighteenth century at a lower pitch and pantiled, with 2 gabled dormers on the front. There is a central square chimney stack. The interior has exposed timber-framing, ceiling beams and joists. The farmhouse is located immediately north of Lawshall Green. Images of England NB: The above property details usually represent the names and addresses that were used at the time that the buildings were listed.

Charles Frederick Tyrwitt Drake died on 23 June 1878 and was buried in Jerusalem. In his memory the family commissioned the digging of Drake's Well and the provision of a handsome cover to be placed over the well. It remains an impressive feature as one enters Lawshall from the A134. Footpath to Lawshall Green - part of St Edmund Way St Edmund Way The St Edmund Way is a long distance footpath that extends from Sudbury to Bury St Edmunds and connects the Stour Valley Path with the Lark Valley Path. The St Edmund Way passes through Long Melford and Lavenham before reaching Lawshall Green where it progresses northward to Stanningfield and Little Whelnetham and then onwards to Bury St Edmunds. The total length of the route is 13 miles and Lawshall Green represents the half-way point.

GoToAssist Remote Support enables users to access and control remote computers and other Internet-connected devices in order to provide technical support. The solution allows a desktop view of a host computer to be manipulated from a it computer. The two machines are connected through a TCP/IP network. One of Expertcity's innovations was to employ the Internet for connectivity, protecting transmissions with high-security encryption and multiple passwords. By combining a web-based software service with software installed on the host computer, transmissions could be passed through highly restrictive firewalls. \\"GoToMyPC works by using the Internet, Expertcity-hosted secure servers and screen-sharing to enable users connect to their computers from a Web browser.\\" In December 2003, Citrix Systems of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, acquired the GoToAssist service and its developer, Expertcity, for $225 million, half cash and half stock. In 2017, LogMeIn, a SaaS company in Boston, completed the acquisition (through merger) with Citrix's GetGo family of products including GoToAssist. GoToAssist joined former competitor LogMeIn Rescue to create the Rescue family of support products. Editions GoToAssist has gone through a series of editions.

The church was founded in 1643, just a few years after the first settlement of Guilford in 1639. At that time, under the theocratic structure of the New Haven Colony, the town of Guilford and its church were essentially the same entity. Guilford's first meeting house was a simple stone structure with a thatched roof, located on the town green. It was expanded in the 1660s, 1670s, and 1680s, and finally replaced in 1713 with the construction of a larger building, also on the green, that is reputed to have been the first church in Connecticut with a steeple clock and a bell. Initially the church served a very large area, which was reduced over time as new congregational societies were established in East Guilford (now the town of Madison), Cohabit (now North Guilford), and North Bristol (now North Madison).Smith (1877), p. 8 The current church building, a wooden structure that overlooks the town green, was completed in 1830 as part of a campaign to clear the green of buildings. Five other Congregational churches were built on essentially the same design in the Connecticut towns of Old Lyme (the 1816–17 Old Lyme Congregational Church), Milford (1823), Cheshire (the 1827 First Congregational Church of Cheshire), Litchfield (the 1829 First Congregational Church of Litchfield), and Southington (1830). All six churches have front porticos with four fluted columns, the doors of all six have the same dimensions, all six steeples are of the same design and are surmounted by weathervanes that appear to have been cast from one mold, and all six churches have twenty-over-twenty double-hung windows. The similarities suggest that some of the building elements may have been prefabricated. The church lost its steeple in the 1938 New England hurricane, but the steeple was rebuilt the following year. In the 19th century, the congregation was divided over the issue of slavery. After church leaders refused to allow local abolitionists to meet in the church, the church's abolitionist members formed a new separate congregation, the Third Congregational Church, which built its own meetinghouse in 1840.Smith (1877) gives 1843 as the date of the establishment of the Third Church and 1844 as the date of building of its meetinghouse. The Guilford Preservation Alliance list of \\"Significant Structures Fifty Years Old or More, Guilford, Connecticut\\" also gives an 1844 date for the Third Church's meetinghouse. Aaron Dutton, who had been the First Congregational minister since 1806, left in 1842 because of the congregation's disapproval of his abolitionist views.Smith (1877), page 98 According to the First Congregational Church's account of its own history, most of the members of the abolitionist church returned to First Church by 1920, after the slavery question had been resolved.

The wreckage site was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. History Sevona, originally named Emily P. Weed, was launched in 1890. She was renamed Sevona in 1897. On September 1, 1905, Sevona left Allouez, Wisconsin, bound for Erie, Pennsylvania, with a cargo of iron ore and a crew of twenty men and four women. Later that night, an unexpected storm hit the area. By midnight, the wind had reached gale-force strength. At around 6:00 a.m. on September 2, Sevona ran aground on a shoal and broke in half. No other vessel was in the area to aid Sevona, so crew members on the stern section of the ship boarded the lifeboats. Crew members on the bow section, separated from the lifeboats, were forced to construct a raft out of hatch covers and doors. All crew members on the makeshift raft later lost their lives in the storm. Three other vessels, including the schooner-barge Pretoria, were lost in the storm. In 1909, the United States Army Corps of Engineers, who were concerned about navigation hazards posed by the wreck of Sevona, blew it up with dynamite. Several parts of the ship were recovered and brought to shore following the explosion, but what was left became a popular site for scuba diving. The wreck site is managed jointly by the Wisconsin Historical Society, the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore, and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. Sam Fifield, a former Lieutenant governor of Wisconsin, had a summer resort on Sand Island, and salvaged some of the wreckage of Sevona. With this material, he built a house on Sand Island, and named it the Sevona Memorial Cottage. The house still stands today, and has undergone some preservation work over the years.

Seydel wrote as a syndicated columnist and founded the Seydell Journal, a quarterly journal that was the successor to The Think Tank a short-lived biweekly journal of poetry, articles and reviews (1940–1947) (with the catchphrase/logo Drop it into your thoughts and see the best splash in print). She also founded the Mildred Seydell Publishing Company, and was a regular on the lecture circuit. Early life Seydell's parents were Vasser Woolley, an attorney and businessman from Atlanta, and Bessie Cobb Rutherford, the daughter of Colonel John Cobb Rutherford, who was also an attorney. Named after her grandfather's sister Mildred Lewis Rutherford, Seydell was the elder of two children. Her brother Vasser Woolley, Jr., six or seven years younger than her, would follow their father in business. Seydell matriculated from the Lucy Cobb Institute in Athens, Georgia before attending the Sorbonne. Career In 1922, she began her career as a journalist with the Charleston Gazette, a West Virginia newspaper. In 1924 she moved to Atlanta as a correspondent for that paper. She was affiliated with the Atlanta Georgian, one of William Randolph Hearst's string of newspapers, working there from 1926 until its closing in 1938. Seydell was twice married. Her first marriage which lasted from 1910 to 1944 was to Paul Bernard Seydel, a Belgian chemist/scientist whom she met while studying at the Sorbonne. Their children were Paul and John. After Mr. Seydel died from complications of a colectomy, she married Max Seydel, her first husband's brother in 1947. For two decades, Belgium was their home, until their return in 1967 to Atlanta. She adopted his last name with two \\"L\\"s as her professional/pen name at the beginning of her journalistic career. She reported on the Scopes Monkey Trial in 1925. The Scopes trial was her first major story. She interviewed Harold E. \\"Red\\" Grange, and was pictured doing his hand reading, a technique she used to \\"break the ice\\" with an interview subject. Seydell employed the stratagem of hand reading in order to increase her readership, asserting her ability to discover the intimate personality characteristics of big names such as U.S. vice president Charles G. Dawes and film director Cecil B. DeMille. She even claimed to have been able to read the palms of a well known circus gorilla called Sultan (aka \\"John Daniel II\\"). During the Scopes trial, Seydell was sent a picture of a monkey's hand, and she was photographed comparing the hands of the Bible toting judge John T. Raulston, Clarence Darrow and William Jennings Bryan to it. Seydell circa 1931 During her career, she interviewed Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini in 1926, Risto Ryti, the Finnish President and Jean Sibelius were interviewed by her while she was on tour in Finland and Lapland. Other notable personages interviewed by her included (in alphabetical order): Mrs. Edvard Beneš, George Cukor, Ève Curie, Marion Davies, and Bette Davis. She was quoted as having once opined that she \\"much preferred to set the stage for adventure rather than the table for dinner\\". Her interviews appeared in her column, Talks with Celebrities, (Hollywood celebrities mostly) which was carried in 27 Hearst papers and the Universal News Service. Other columns included What Would You Do? (advice column from 1926 to 1931) renamed as Mildred Seydell Says... in 1933, and All in a Day. In her columns, she detailed the suffering of the unemployed in the 1930s, and offered advice. Seydell became intertwined with the National Woman's Party and the struggle for equal rights following the passage of the 19th Amendment. In 1931 and 1932, she was Chairperson of Atlanta and Georgia, respectively. In 1935 she became associate editor of Equal Rights, its national publication. Other women's organizations in which she was active included: the League of Women Voters, the League of American Pen Women (on March 13, 1931, after meeting with its national president, she was one of 15 Charter members of the Atlanta Branch), the National Federation of Press Women, the Pan American League, the Atlanta Women's Chamber of Commerce; and the Atlanta Woman's Club. From 1941-43, Seydell served as President of the Atlanta Federation of Women's Clubs. Seydell was also active in the Federation of American Women's Club Overseas (in Belgium) and the American Woman's Club of Brussels. Seydell was an enthusiastic supporter of the Tallulah Falls School, \\"the only school in the United States which is owned and operated by a state federation of women's clubs.\\" It was founded in 1909 by the Georgia Federation of Women's Clubs. As Seydell wrote in the Atlanta Georgian, \\"The school is called the 'Light in the Mountains' because ignorance is darkness and knowledge is light.\\" President Franklin D. Roosevelt is claimed to have said \\"am much interested in your articles\\". She was an accomplished traveler, having gone to at least 52 \\"far lands during her career .\\" In 1973, she was honored with the Order of Leopold by the Belgian government for her cultural exchange contributions between Belgium and the United States. It is one of the orders of knighthood; the highest order of Belgium and named in honor of King Leopold I. She wrote and planned to publish her autobiography The Record on the Wall. Apparently, it was not published. The manuscript is at the Emory Library. Death and after Her papers and memorabilia are massively collected ( linear) at Emory University. A collection of early and rare Belgian poetry and masterpiece books was created by her at the Emory University Library in 1971, in honor of her late husband Paul. It was a gift of the charitable foundation, organized in 1982, which bears their names. In a Georgia State Capitol ceremony on Martin Luther King Day in 2012, Georgia Governor Nathan Deal quoted Chins Up! by Mildred Seydell: \\"Great men don't hate. They are too busy with their accomplishments. Hate flourishes in the breasts of those who have time to feel their wrongs. Hate is the weapon of the defeated, love that of the victor.

It is notable for its unusual double or rose comb, for the early age at which birds reach maturity, and for the unusual shape of the eggs. The Sicilian Buttercup, bred in Australia, Great Britain and the North America, derives from it, but its long separation from the original stock has led to marked differences between the two. History Gallus turcicus, from the Ornithologiae tomus alter of Ulisse Aldrovandi (1522–1605) The Siciliana appears to derive from ancient inter-breeding of local Sicilian birds with North African stock such as the rose-combed Berbera breed or the Tripolitana described by Tucci. These birds may have been similar to the \\"Gallus turcicus\\" described by Ulisse Aldrovandi in 1600. Chickens similar to the Siciliana are depicted in 16th-century paintings in the Vatican Museums and the Galleria Borghese in Rome, and in Florence and Paris. In about 1863 or 1877, a certain Cephas Dawes of Dedham, Mass, captain of the Frutiere, was loading oranges in Sicily and bought a number of chickens to provide meat on his homeward journey. Some of these continued to lay well during the voyage, and were kept for eggs instead. Some of them were later sold to one C. Carroll Loring, also of Dedham, who became the first breeder of what would become the Sicilian Buttercup. All American Buttercups, however, descend from a later shipment of hatchlings, in 1892. In Sicily, the Siciliana was bred from 1913 by Francesco Tucci, director of the Istituto Zootecnico, or zoo-technical institute, of Palermo, who bred only gold-coloured birds and who established the first standard for the breed. The Siciliana was described in 1922 by Ferruccio Frau- Sanna, who praised the work of Tucci but found stocks to be low and of uneven type. The breed declined through most of the 20th century until by the 1980s it was all but extinct. In 1986 some examples were shown at Forlì, and interest in the breed was renewed; it was for some time among the breeds under the protection of the Stazione Sperimentale di Pollicoltura (experimental poultry-breeding station) of Rovigo and of the Conservatorio delle Razze Avicole in Pericolo di Estinzione (centre for avian breeds in danger of extinction) of the Veneto region. In 2004 the Siciliana was included in the official standard of the Federazione Italiana Associazioni Avicole, the federation of Italian poultry associations, which is the national authority governing poultry breeding in Italy. Breed numbers remain low. A study published in 2007 used a figure of approximately 1000 for the total breeding stock, of which approximately 250 were cocks. Characteristics Four colour varieties are recognised in the Siciliana: golden duckwing, black, white and, since June 2008, blue. The legs are willow green, and the skin is soft and yellow. The comb is cup-shaped, the two parts joined at the front and preferably also at the back, preferably with 5 well-defined points on each side. The ear-lobes are red; some white is tolerated. Average weight is for cocks, for hens. The eggs range from white to light brown in colour, and weigh at least 45 g. They are of an unusually elongated and pointed shape. Ring size is 18 mm for cocks, 16 mm for hens. The Siciliana matures early. Male chicks may begin to crow at four weeks and display sexual behaviour at 40 days. Pullets begin laying at four or five months.

Typically on the first Saturday in December, this Cultural Center-wide “Open House” features free admission to many of Detroit’s well-known museums, as well as many other activities such as horse-drawn carriage rides, carolers, music, dance, children’s activities, arts and crafts, shopping, and its annual community sing-along led by the Salvation Army on the Woodward Avenue bandstand.\\"39 Years of Holiday Merriment. \\"  History  = 1973 = The first Noel Night took place on December 19, 1973, from 6 to 9pm. It was originally organized by the now disbanded art group, Detroit Adventure. They described Noel Night as the first cooperative event of its kind to happen in this area at this time of year for all the people of Detroit, Michigan.Noel Night Collection., MS- Detroit Adventure, Box 25. Burton Historical Collection, Detroit Public Library. The organization’s goal was to create an audience of participation through venues. Noel Night was their starting point. Performances consisted of high school, university and church choirs, the City of Detroit Recreation Department and school theater groups. A truck outfitted with a speaker system (referred to by Detroit Adventure as the “soundmobile”) drove Woodward Avenue, playing Christmas carols. There were also specific children-oriented activities at certain venues. Woodward Avenue was closed between Kirby and Putnam, and the entire road and surrounding buildings were opened to the public for use during the event. Participating institutions included the following: The Children’s Museum, Detroit Historical Museum, Detroit Public Library, International Institute, The Cathedral Church of St. Paul, The Scarab Club, The Smiley Brothers Society for Arts and Crafts (now called the College for Creative Studies), U of M Rackham extension, and Your Heritage House. It was estimated that approximately 6,000 people attended the event. = 1974 - 1976 = The next three years maintained a format similar to the 1973 event. Participating venues included everything from the previous year in addition to the Detroit Community Music School, The Detroit Science Center, and The Detroit Institute of Arts. The sound mobile was redesigned as a larger rolling bandwagon in 1974. Television personalities John Kelly and Marilyn Turner both lead the community sing-along from that bandwagon that year. In 1975, a large ice sculpture was placed in the center of Woodward Avenue for the duration of the 3 hour event. In 1976, attendance was estimated at 8,000. = 1977 - 1978 = Over the years, there have been many organizations to be added to the participation in the Noel Night event. As more of these organizations have been added, the larger the crowds. In 1977, the outdoor mobile stage was first introduced. It is still in use today. The ice sculpture activity, which was first introduced in 1978, is also used in Noel Night each year.  Buildings/Vendors  When the first Noel Night started in 1973, there were 10 institutions that participated in the event. The most recent event took place in 2016 with over 60 midtown venues. It is estimated that over 35,000 people showed up to the event. Some of the places that have participated include The Detroit Institute of Arts, Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History, Detroit Historical Museum, Detroit Public Library, Detroit Medical Center, Detroit Science Center, and Old Main (Wayne State University).

The injuries were not life threatening. Detroit Police were investigating what caused the argument during which the juvenile fired the weapon.

Published in 2011, it is the first book featuring Scowen's character Dr. Matthew Cameron. The novel received mixed reviews in New Zealand newspapers due to its handling of controversial theories relating to New Zealand's accepted history. While one book reviewer praised the novel for a thought-provoking story-line, another labelled sub-plots of the debut work as laughable. Most agree that despite the sometimes 'clunky' writing, The Spanish Helmet is a fun, easy and quick read. The peer reviewed journal of the Australian and New Zealand Map Society (The Globe: ) included a review of The Spanish Helmet in their first bi-annual issue of 2013. The reviewer was John Dancy of Ordnance Survey, UK. In summary, the reviewer had some issues with the book which he suggests may come about from his distance from the setting, however he concluded that the story-lines are believable and there is something there to keep you interested until the end. Dancy also commented on the fine use of maps and thorough knowledge of New Zealand presented.Dancy, John. The Spanish helmet [Book Review] [online]. Globe, The, No. 72, Jun 2013: 35-36. Availability: . [cited 26 Mar 14].  Alternate history theories  New Zealand has numerous pseudohistory theories of pre Māori settlement and alternative narratives of early European exploration some of which are explored in this novel. The plot of The Spanish Helmet revolves around a theory that New Zealand was discovered by the crew of a Spanish ship lost at sea in 1525. This theory was originally proposed by Australian writer Robert Langdon in his 1975 work The Lost Caravel. Scowen acknowledges the work of Langdon as the basis for the novel and has intertwined the story of the crew of the San Lesmes beyond their last sighting with the story of a modern-day archaeologist/historian who investigates the suggested New Zealand discovery. Another possible settlement of New Zealand by Celts is also lightly skirted around. The explanation for the helmet is in an article by H. Fildes in 'The Dominion' newspaper, Wellington, 3 August 1932, p.6. It came from Alfred Taine, the son of immigrants to Wellington in 1840. He said an immigrant of 1840 had purchased the helmet when embarking at Gravesend for New Zealand, 'believing the iron headgear would be serviceable as protection when he landed among the savages of New Zealand. On his arrival here he learned a helmet was quite unnecessary, and as he was sufficiently encumbered with his goods and chattels, and not any of his fellow immigrants cared to accept the iron hat, he got rid of it in the most easy way—by tossing it overboard.' The helmet was recovered from Wellington Harbour 'some fifty years ago', This is the only time guide to when the helmet was dredged up. This, as well as the helmet's good condition, lends support to people in the Tower of London who say the helmet was a nineteenth century English musketeer's helmet.Journal of the Polynesian Society, 1989, p.232 Therefore the helmet was probably acquired cheaply at some London outlet disposing of surplus military equipment and was not a valuable sixteenth century antique.R.S. Bennett, author/publisher of 'Australia and its neighbours 1494-1799' 2014 Auckland Awards The novel was selected by the New Zealand Society of Authors for presentation at the Frankfurt Book Fair in 2012, where New Zealand was the guest of honour.http://innz.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?BBID=750075 References Category:2011 novels Category:Historical novels Category:Thriller novels Category:21st-century New Zealand novels Category:Fiction set in the 1520s Category:Novels set in the 16th century Category:Novels set in New Zealand Category:New Zealand historical novels ","title":"The Spanish Helmet"},{"id":"34486128","text":"Parisian Love is a black and white 1925 silent film starring Clara Bow.

Early years Eliza was born in Dunkirk, France as Eliza Ware Rotch to Benjamin and Elizabeth Rotch who were a family of successful whaling merchants. During her early life, she and her family left France during the French Revolution and moved to England where she was educated. Due to bad investments, her family lost everything and she was sent to New Bedford, Massachusetts to live with her grandparents. Here, she was an active member of the Friends Meeting, a religious society for Quakers; however, she was eventually disowned by this organization for her liberal views as a New Light. Career In 1828, she married John Farrar, a professor of mathematics at Harvard. Between the years 1830 and 1837, Eliza was most active in her writing, and most of her works were published in Boston, Massachusetts. With these publications, she was recorded as Mrs. John Farrar, but even still she was a known name and revered as a respectable individual based on her works. In 1834, she appeared in the American Annals of Education for the announcement of her upcoming book The Letter-Writer. Although there is not a public version available, Eliza also wrote \\"Memorials of the Life of Elizabeth Rotch, Being the Recollections of a Mother, by her Daughter, Eliza Farrar.\\" This memorial, along with a collection of correspondences between Eliza and her family, is held by the New Bedford Whaling Museum, and the Massachusetts Historical Society also has a collection of the Rotch's which includes personal correspondences of Eliza.

Following allegations of sexual and physical abuse in a letter by former students in 2017, Rigpa commissioned an independent investigation which found those claims to be largely substantiated, along with evidence of a cover-up. According to its website, Rigpa seeks to make the teachings of Buddha available to benefit as many people as possible, and to offer those following the Buddhist teachings a complete path of study and practice, along with the environment they need to explore the teachings to their fullest.About Rigpa at Rigpa.org History After five years teaching in the West, Sogyal Rinpoche gave the name 'Rigpa' to his work.The History of Rigpa, The Rigpa Journal, volume 2 At that time, Rigpa had just one centre, in north-west London and was known as Dzogchen Orgyen Chö Ling.Dzogchen Orgyen Chö Ling By 1980, Sogyal Rinpoche was teaching in the UK, France, the United States, Ireland and Holland. Rigpa centres opened in a number of major cities, and in each country Rigpa was established as a non-profit organization. A programme of Easter and summer retreats began, and Rigpa’s first retreat centre, Dzogchen Beara, was set up on the west coast of Ireland.DzogchenBeara.org: About Us =Major events= Rigpa invited the Dalai Lama, or sponsored his teachings or empowerments, on a number of occasions; in Paris in 1982, London in 1984 and San Jose in 1989. Five and a half thousand people attended the teachings in San Jose, in what at the time was the largest gathering of practitioners and masters of Buddhadharma in America, and possibly in the West. In 1990, Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche taught and gave empowerments to 1,500 people at Rigpa’s summer retreat near Grenoble in the French Alps.Rigpa Wiki: Prapoutel 1990 In 1992, the Dzogchen Monastery in Kollegal in India, sponsored by Rigpa, was officially inaugurated when Dzogchen Rinpoche invited the Dalai Lama to give empowerments. In the same year, Rigpa opened its main retreat centre, Lerab Ling near Montpellier in the south of France.LerabLing.org: About Lerab Ling Thich Nhat Hanh, Khenpo Jigme Phuntsok and Penor Rinpoche were among the masters who taught there in the years that followed. In 1999, Trulshik Rinpoche founded the basis for a monastic community within Rigpa by ordaining the first nuns. In 2000 the Dalai Lama visited Lerab Ling, and gave five days of teachings entitled The Path to Enlightenment, attended by more than 10,000 students of Tibetan Buddhism from around the world.Rigpa Wiki:Lerab Gar 2000 The teachings given by the Dalai Lama have been published in a book entitled Mind in Comfort and Ease: The Vision of Enlightenment in the Great Perfection.Wisdom Publications: Mind in Comfort and Ease Lerab Ling was officially recognized as a ‘religious congregation’ in 2002.About Lerab Ling In 2006, a traditional three-storey temple at Lerab Ling was completed, including a seven-metre high statue of Buddha Shakyamuni. Rigpa's first three-year retreat began, with over 300 people remaining in closed retreat at Lerab Ling from 2006–2009, and since 2006, over 3,000 students have followed a 'home retreat' programme in their own countries.Groundbreaking three-year retreat draws to a close In 2007, work began on Rigpa's Spiritual Care Centre at Dzogchen Beara.The Spiritual Care Centre at Dzogchen Beara, Who are we? =The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying= In 1993, Sogyal Rinpoche published The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying,Sogyal Rinpoche, The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying, the success of which led to a great expansion in the work of Rigpa. A Spiritual Care Education and Training Programme was set up,Rigpa.org:Spiritual Care and in 1996 Rigpa presented a conference on care for the dying, near Munich, which had a considerable influence on the emerging hospice movement in Germany.History of Rigpa: 1992-1996 = Suspension of membership from UBF = Following the testimonies from current and ex-Rigpa students, of physical, sexual and financial abuse by Sogyal Rinpoche, the Union Bouddhiste De France suspended the membership of Rigpa Lérab Ling and Rigpa France on August 3rd, 2017. = Independent investigation from Lewis Silkin = In July 2017 a number of allegations of misconduct were brought against Rigpa's founder, Sogyal Rinpoche. One of the actions undertaken by Rigpa was to commission an independent investigation into the allegations to enable witnesses to come forward, and \\"be listened to in an open, impartial and sensitive way\\". The report by Karen Baxter of UK law firm Lewis Silkin confirmed that, on the balance of probabilities: * some students of Sogyal Lakar (who were part of the ‘inner circle’) have been subjected to serious physical, sexual and emotional abuse by him; and * there were senior individuals within Rigpa who were aware of at least some of these issues and failed to address them, leaving others at risk. In her findings Karen Baxter described one of the senior managers interviewed for the report as being “guarded, hostile and inconsistent”. Another senior member of the management team was described by the lawyer as involved in “a pro-active cover-up”. The UK Charities Commission has made it very clear in recent years that they will expect organisations with safeguarding problems to launch an investigation, co-operate with the authorities and put right what they can before they are allowed to move on. Rigpa has acknowledged the gravity of the independent report, but has not yet accepted the findings of the investigation, nor committed to implementing its recommendations. Study and practice Rigpa has developed a graduated \\"study and practice\\" program that is delivered internationally and which can take several years to complete. It begins with foundation-level courses introducing basic meditation practice, using samatha methods such as resting the mind on an object (such as the breath or a picture of Padmasambhava) and mantra recitation. Then the Mahayana teachings are presented, together with the tonglen practice of giving and receiving. Next, students are taught Vajrayana preliminaries, including \\"Taking Refuge\\" and bodhicitta (mind of awakening).Meditation & other courses Older students are taught sadhana practices focusing on the terma revelations of Sogyal Rinpoche's predecessor, Tertön Sogyal, as well as the practice of Dzogchen meditation. Rigpa also has a program, Rigpé Yeshé, to help members who are parents and wish to educate their children as Buddhists.About Rigpé Yeshé =Rigpa Shedra= The Rigpa Shedra, or study college, was established in 2001 in Lerab Ling.Rigpa Shedra at Rigpawiki It offers courses based on traditional Buddhist texts taught by lamas such as Dzogchen Rinpoche, Dzigar Kongtrul Rinpoche, Ringu Tulku and Khenpo Pema Sherab. A longer, more intensive version known as Rigpa Shedra East, which is based in Pharping near Kathmandu and is under the guidance of Khenpo Namdrol, began in 2006. This eastern shedra runs for four months a year and the full curriculum takes nine years to complete. Teachers Over the years many senior teachers from the Tibetan tradition have taught in Rigpa centres, including the Dalai Lama, Sakya Trizin, Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, Dudjom Rinpoche, Kalu Rinpoche, Nyoshul Khen Rinpoche and Trulshik Rinpoche. More recently, regular teachers at Rigpa centres around the world have included many from the younger generation of lamas, such as Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche, Dzigar Kongtrul Rinpoche, Tsoknyi Rinpoche, Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche and Khandro Rinpoche. A number of teachers from other traditions have also been invited, including Thich Nhat Hanh, who taught in Lerab Ling in 1993, and Balangoda Ananda Maitreya Thero, who taught in Rigpa London in 1983.

Musaazi.Engholm, Geoffrey: \\"Political Parties and Uganda's Independence\\", pages 15–17, Transition, 3 January 1962. He became the Secretary General of the UNC in his youth and while an undergraduate student at Makerere University College, which later became Makerere University. Abu Mayanja helped Musaazi draft the Constitution of the Uganda National Congress party. Abu was a fighter for independence in Uganda and Africa, a strong parliamentarian and one who disliked injustice. He contributed greatly to the political life of Uganda as a constitutional expert, formidable parliamentarian, government minister at various times, and as an excellent Barrister in private practice. His written contributions in the Tribune magazine, Transition, Uganda Argus and New Vision newspapers were always well received and much respected.  Early life and career  Abu Mayanja was born in 1929 to Abdalla Waswa Kambuga Kakyama and Mariantonia Kayaga. His father Abdalla was from Buga village (Ziba, near Ngogwe in Mukono district of Uganda). His mother Mariantonia was from Buvuma Islands. His father worked as a subsistence farmer and was a Muslim by faith. His mother was a Christian. Abu Mayanja distinguished himself academically despite the disadvantages of coming from a relatively poor family. His mother Mariantonia taught him to read and write by encouraging him to read old newspapers which had previously served as wrappings for kabalagala, a local pancake made from cassava flour and bananas. At school, he skipped senior 3 due to his brightness. He was a very able young man and sat for his senior 6 examinations at Old Kampala in 1949. Prior to this, he had scored the highest marks in the Primary Leaving Examinations; this was the highest ever recorded marks in the whole country at the time. Abu Mayanja attended King's College Budo in 1944 while D.G. R. Herbert was the Headmaster, and was admitted to England House. Apollo Kironde was one of his teachers at King's College Budo. Abu went to Makerere University College in 1950 to read English Literature, History and Mathematics. While at Makerere he was the editor of The Makerere Current News and also the Secretary of the Guild Council.  Makerere to University of Cambridge  Abu Mayanja was expelled from Makerere University College in 1952 because he and other students complained about the diet and started a strike.Mills, David (2006): \\"Life on the Hill: Students and the social history of Makerere”, Africa, 76(2). While still concentrating on UNC activities, Abu Mayanja was keen to resume his academic studies. To revive his academic pursuits, Abu sought support from lecturers at Makerere University College; they included Professor A. G. Warner, Dr Kenneth Ingham and Bernard Debansin. They were all in agreement that it would be a great shame for Uganda if Abu Mayanja, a bright young man, did not continue with his university education. They recommended continuation of his studies.Kavuma, Richard, “1958–2004: Mayanja saw it all”, Weekly Observer Newspaper (Uganda), 18 November 2004. With this strong recommendation, the matter was taken by Abu Mayanja to Latima Mpagi, then an official at Mengo. The Kabaka (King), Sir Edward Mutesa II, raised the issue of Abu Mayanja's education with the Colonial Governor Sir Andrew Cohen. As it happened, Sir Andrew Cohen was about to leave for London on leave and while in London he made arrangements for Abu Mayanja to attend the University of Cambridge. Sir Edward Mutesa II and Sir Andrew Cohen were thus instrumental in Abu Mayanja's continuation of his undergraduate education. A very bright and able Abu Mayanja was deservedly given the opportunity to resume his education at a university of international standing.  Independence fighter  Having been accepted to study at the University of Cambridge, Abu had to make a speedy escape to London because of his political position. He was under threat of arrest by the colonial authorities. He was in the United Kingdom from 1953 until 1959. While still a student at Cambridge University (King's), where he read History, Abu Mayanja attended the first All-African Peoples' Conference held in Accra, Ghana between 5–13 December 1958. The conference was organised by Kwame Nkrumah and chaired by Tom Mboya. The conference was the forerunner of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) which later became the African Union (AU). Abu Mayanja met many Africans in London who were involved in campaigns for political independence in their respective countries. He wrote numerous articles which were published in Tribune magazine. He advocated political independence for Uganda and Africa from colonial rule. Abu Mayanja was the first Muslim in Uganda to earn a university degree.  UNC splits into factions  The Uganda National Congress Party split into factions during the time Abu Mayanja was away in the United Kingdom. On his return on 30 May 1959, after completing his undergraduate studies at Cambridge University, and legal studies at the Bar (The Honourable Society of Lincoln's Inn – October 1955 to June 1957); and having worked for a while at the chambers of Roland Brown, Abu Mayanja found the UNC political party no longer in existence. He went to the United States of America on a Leadership grant and returned to Uganda in February 1960.  Buganda government minister  In 1961 Abu Mayanja was appointed a Minister of Education in the Buganda government. He participated in the Lancaster House Conference in London prior to Uganda's independence from Britain which was granted on 9 October 1962. Abu Mayanja resigned in April 1964 after the Speaker, Mr Eriasafi Kalule insulted him during a session of the Lukiiko (Parliament of Buganda). He was, however, later that year elected by the Lukiiko as MP in September 1964 following the resignation of Jimmy Simpson as representative of Kyaggwe North East.Ssemujju, Ibrahim Nganda, \\"A Biography Abu Mayanja never lived to read\\",Weekly Observer newspaper (Uganda), November 2005  1962 Constitution  Abu Mayanja was among the delegation to the Uganda Independence Conference in 1962. He was given the responsibility of overseeing the implementation of the 1962 Constitution in Buganda, in effect he was responsible for the attachment of the Buganda constitution within the main Uganda constitution.  Charges of sedition  In October 1968, following a critique of the 1967 Uganda Constitution in the Transition Magazine (April 1968 issue); which upset the then Government, Abu Mayanja was arrested and charged for sedition. At the time he was newly married to his first wife, Hadija. Abu was acquitted of the charges but immediately rearrested in Court under the emergency detention powers operating at the time. Amnesty International adopted him as a prisoner of conscience. He spent two years in Luzira maximum security prison, away from his wife Hadija, until 1970 when he was released.  \\"Supersonic speed government\\"  Abu Mayanja was appointed Minister of Education in 1971 by Idi Amin, but on 30 November 1972 he, as well as other government ministers, was relieved of his ministerial duties, he was by then Minister of Labour. The other government ministers who were sacked were: Professor William B. Banage, Apollo Kironde, and Yekosefati Engur. Explaining the reason for their sacking, Idi Amin told the ministers that they could not cope under his government which was now running at “supersonic speed”. He was called upon to perform other duties of importance. In 1972 Abu Mayanja chaired the committee that made the arrangements for the return of the body of Ssekabaka Sir Edward Mutesa II from London, where he had died in 1969, back to Uganda. In 1986 Abu Mayanja became Attorney General and Deputy Prime Minister under President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni.  Lungujja  For most of his life Abu Mayanja lived at Lungujja, near Mengo, apart from episodes abroad as a student in the UK and in exile in Kenya, and also when he was imprisoned during the 1960s for writing an article about the 1967 Uganda Constitution. He suffered during the colonial period and was arrested a few times; in fact on one memorable occasion it was Mwalimu Julius Nyerere, the late President of Tanzania, who paid the necessary fine to secure his release.  Abu Mayanja Foundation  The Abu Mayanja Foundation inaugural memorial lecture was delivered by the renown African academic and political writer Professor Ali Mazrui on 30 July 2007 at the Rwenzori Ball Room, Sheraton Kampala Hotel. Professor Mazrui has in the past lived and worked in Uganda. He was at Makerere University from 1965 to 1973 as Head of the Department of Political Science (1965–1973), and Dean of the Faculty of Social Sciences (1967–1969). The inaugural lecture by Professor Ali Mazrui was entitled \\"Between Secular Activism and Religious Observance – Abu Mayanja and Africa's Triple Heritage\\".

Higgins.Kilian Doyle, Irish Times, 02/01/2012 Mulready is the only President's nominee on the Council of State who does not live in Ireland. She was appointed by the President due to her many decades of work for the Irish community in Britain. The Irish Times of 21 January 2012 published an article about Mulready headlined \\"The President's emigrant\\".\\"The President's emigrant\\", Mark Henessy, London Editor, Irish Times, 21 January 2012 Work with Irish in Britain Sally Mulready's work spans many decades and many areas. The theme that runs through all her work is helping and empowering the disadvantaged. Survivors Mulready is a founder member, and current Chair, of the Irish Women Survivors Network, known widely as \\"the Women's Group\\".Irish Survivors Support and Advice Network website http://www.irishsurvivorsuk.org.uk'Survivors' is the term given to the men and women who spent time in Irish institutional care under the religious orders. =The Women's Group= Sally Mulready founded the Irish Women Survivors Network in London in 2002 after watching the ground-breaking States of Fear programme by the late Mary Raftery. The group was founded in order to provide support, advice and companionship to women who had spent time in Irish institutional care, either as children or as mothers (in 'mother and baby' homes.) Over the last ten years, the group has grown in terms of numbers of women involved (often with 400 people attending meetings), scope, and reach (regularly contributing to government policy discussions through attendance of meetings with Ministers and formal submissions.) =Policy contribution= Mulready gave evidence to the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse and has recently given evidence to the Irish Government's interdepartmental inquiry into the possibility of state involvement in the infamous Magdalene Laundries. The inquiry was established by Minister Alan Shatter and is being chaired by Senator Martin McAleese. Mulready has gathered extensive evidence from individual Magdalene women, which has been acknowledged as of great importance to the work of the inquiry. In 2011 and after a long fight for justice, the women received an official apology from the Irish government in a speech made by Ireland's Taoiseach Enda Kenny. The Prime Minister met 15 from the Magdalene survivors and ordered the judicial commission to create compensation packages for the affected women. =Survivors' welfare= Sally Mulready and the other Trustees of the Irish Women's Survivors Network later founded the Irish Survivors Support and Advice Network, providing help to survivors relating to accessing the Residential Institutions Redress Board, tracing family members, counselling, benefits and other welfare needs. This is a survivors-led organisation, with all Trustees being survivors and the head of the service (voluntary basis), Phyllis Morgan, is also a survivor. A book documenting the personal and contextual history of the Irish Women Survivors Network is currently being written and will be available in 2012. In her former capacity as the Secretary of the Federation of Irish Societies, Mulready secured the Irish Government’s agreement for the creation and funding of five Survivor Outreach Services in Britain, at a time when no such services existed. The aim was to meet the urgent needs of the thousands of men and women who fled Ireland hurt and alone following terrible experiences and ordeals. Work with older Irish people Sally Mulready is the Director of the Irish Elderly Advice Network, a charity supporting older Irish people living in and around London. The aim of the charity is to combat poverty and isolation amongst older Irish people. The Irish Elderly Advice Network was founded in 1993 by Bridie McGowan and Margaret Byrne, both older Irish people, after three vulnerable older Irish people were found dead in their homes in Camden. Sally was the first member of staff. Mulready campaigned, successfully, for recognition of the right of Irish pensioners to an Irish contributory pension based on their national insurance contributions made before they left Ireland; something that continues to have a transforming impact on people’s lives. The charity remains small in staff numbers but big in reach. To date, it has helped combat the poverty and isolation of over 4000 older Irish people and is highly regarded by the Ireland Fund of Great Britain, the Irish Embassy and the Irish community in London. In formal recognition of her work in this area, Mulready was awarded the Irish Post newspaper’s Outstanding Community Services Award for her ‘work with elderly Irish people’. In 2005 Mulready created the London Irish Pensioners Choir and she directed their recording of Songs of Love and Emigration One of her daughters, Nora, also works with her at the Irish Elderly Advice Network. Birmingham Six Campaign Having watched the (now famous) Granada TV World In Action programme on the case of the case of the Birmingham six, Sally was convinced of the innocence of the six men and worked with a handful of other workers, mostly from Islington Council in London, to arrange the first meeting of the London campaign; it took place in a small room in the Red Rose Club in Islington in 1986, where Sally was elected as the Secretary of the campaign. This became the London Birmingham Six campaign and it complimented the campaigning work being done by the wives of the men in Birmingham, a campaign group in Dublin and numerous other individuals who were making representations to their MPs on behalf of the Birmingham Six. Jeremy Corbyn MP and Chris Mullin MP were pivotal to raising the campaign in Westminster. The Birmingham Six campaign grew into an international campaign against injustice and the eventual release of the men in March 1991. When the men were finally released Sally wrote Cruel Fate with Hugh Callaghan, the oldest of the Birmingham Six. Sally continued to support the men following their release by campaigning for a legislative change to Pensions entitlements enabling them, and all subsequent victims of miscarriages of justice, to access full State Pensions. Labour Party work Sally has been a member of the British Labour Party since 1980. Sally Mulready is also an elected Labour Party Councillor in Chatham Ward in the London Borough of Hackney. She was first elected to this position in 1997. Sally Mulready was the Speaker of Hackney from 2010 to 2011.

In 1806 there were just over 1,000 but by 1815 this had almost doubled to 1,819. Manchester was dubbed \\"warehouse city\\". The earliest were built around King Street although by 1850 warehouses had spread to Portland Street and later to Whitworth Street. They are direct descendants of the canal warehouses of Castlefield. Function In the mid-19th century, warehouses were mostly built of brick with sandstone dressings and steps to the front door. They were five or six storeys tall with basements housing hydraulic presses, had wooden floors supported on cast iron columns and at the rear of the building was a loading bay with a hydraulic cranes. Fireproof construction was used at the end of the century and into the next. The most successful traders built their own warehouses and many speculative developments offered suites and offices for those who needed smaller premises. Warehouses for the home market in ready-made clothing, haberdashery and fancy goods attracted retailers who visited them to view the goods and make orders. Shipping warehouses, receiving and storing and packing goods for export, multiplied after 1815. Many early-20th-century warehouses were built to a common design with steps to a raised ground floor with a showroom and offices, and the first floor contained more offices and waiting rooms for clients all decorated to impress customers. The working areas above were plain with large windows to allow in natural light. Orders were packed there and sent to the basement on hoists powered by Manchester's hydraulic power system and packed into bales using hydraulic presses before dispatch. The warehouses were lit by gas. Warehouses were a dominant part of the urban landscape in the 19th century and continued to be through the 20th century; the buildings remained when their original use had changed. There were several types of cotton warehouse. =Display of goods for sale= Watts Warehouse Some warehouses displayed finished goods for the home trade such as fashion items. Their street frontages were impressive and some were built in the style of Italianate Palazzos. Richard Cobden's warehouse in Mosley Street was the first to use the palazzo style. There were seven warehouses on Portland Street when the elaborate Watts Warehouse of 1855 was begun, and four more were opened before it was finished. =Overseas warehouses= Overseas warehouses were the meeting places for overseas wholesale buyers where printed and plain cloth was discussed and ordered. Trade in cloth was conducted by merchants of many nationalities. The 1851 census showed 1000 persons of German birth in the city, and in 1871 there were 150 German business houses. Behrens Warehouse was built for Louis Behrens & Son by P Nunn in 1860. It is a four-storey predominantly red-brick building with 23 bays along Portland Street and nine on Oxford Street. The Behrens family were prominent in the banking and social life of the city's German community. =Packing warehouses= The main purpose of a packing warehouse was picking, checking, labelling and packing goods for export. The packing warehouses Asia House, India House and Velvet House on Whitworth Street were among the tallest buildings of their time. =Railway warehouses= Manchester became a railway hub, and goods for the home market and export left the city by train. Warehouses were built close to the major stations. The first was opposite the passenger platform at the terminus of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. There was an important group of warehouses around London Road station (now Piccadilly). The London Warehouse at Piccadilly was one of four built by the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway in about 1865 to service its station. The warehouse was also linked to a branch of the Ashton Canal. It was built of brick with stone detailing and had cast-iron columns with wrought-iron beams. Three warehouses have been demolished, but one that was used as a car park was restored as residential units. In the 1890s the Great Northern Railway Company’s warehouse, the last major railway warehouse to be built, was completed on Deansgate.

He previously played for the Detroit Tigers and Chicago Cubs. Drafted out of high school in 2010 by the Detroit Tigers, Castellanos became one of the top prospects in baseball. Castellanos appeared in the 2012 All- Star Futures Game, and was named the Most Valuable Player of the contest. He made his MLB debut on September 1, 2013. On July 31, 2019, the Tigers traded him to the Chicago Cubs. Prior to the 2020 season, he signed with the Cincinnati Reds. Early life Castellanos was raised by his parents, Michelle and Jorge, in South Florida. His mother's family is based in Michigan. Castellanos attended the American Heritage School in Plantation, Florida, where he played for the school's baseball team. American Heritage won the Florida state championship in his sophomore year. Castellanos transferred to Archbishop McCarthy High School in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, before his junior year. He was named Gatorade Player of the Year for the state of Florida after finishing his senior season with a .542 batting average, 34 runs scored, 41 runs batted in (RBIs) and 22 stolen bases while leading his team to the Class 4A state championship. In the 2009 Under Armour All-America Baseball Game, played at Wrigley Field, he scored three runs, had four doubles and three RBIs, winning Most Valuable Player honors. The Sun-Sentinel named Castellanos the Class 6A-5A-4A Player of the Year. Castellanos played for the United States national baseball team for individuals 18 years of age and under in the 2009 Pan American Junior Championships, in which he batted .356 with six doubles and nine RBIs, leading all players with 14 runs scored, as the team won the gold medal. Castellanos was named to the All-Tournament team. He committed to attend the University of Miami on a baseball scholarship. He intended to play college baseball for the Miami Hurricanes baseball team in the Atlantic Coast Conference. Professional career =Minor leagues= The Detroit Tigers selected Castellanos with the 44th pick in the 2010 Major League Baseball draft. He was rated by Baseball America as the third best power hitting prospect and fourteenth best overall prospect prior to the draft. He slipped because of his commitment to the University of Miami. He signed with the Tigers, receiving a $3.45 million signing bonus, the highest bonus at that point ever given to a player taken after the first round. The deal was almost invalidated, as the Tigers' email to the office of the Commissioner of Baseball was not received until three minutes after the midnight deadline on August 15, 2010; a text message about the deal to the Commissioner's Office received at 11:59 convinced the Commissioner to approve the deal. Though Castellanos played shortstop in high school, the Tigers shifted him to third base as a professional. Castellanos appeared in seven games for the Gulf Coast Tigers of the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League that season. Before the 2011 season, Baseball America rated Castellanos as the 65th best prospect in baseball. He played for the West Michigan Whitecaps of the Class-A Midwest League. With the Whitecaps, Castellanos batted .312 with seven home runs and 76 RBIs, leading the Midwest League with 158 hits and being named the Tigers' minor league position player of the year. Castellanos with the Lakeland Flying Tigers in 2012 Prior to the 2012 season, Baseball America ranked him as the second best prospect in the organization and 45th best in baseball. The Tigers invited Castellanos to spring training in 2012, and expect to assign him to either the Class-A Advanced Lakeland Tigers of the Florida State League or the Class-AA Erie SeaWolves of the Eastern League. Castellanos began the 2012 season with Class-A Lakeland. He was named the Tigers' minor league player of the month of May 2012. After he batted .402 with 32 RBIs in 55 games for Lakeland, the Tigers promoted Castellanos to Erie on June 4. Appearing in the 2012 All-Star Futures Game, Castellanos hit a three-run home run, and was named the game's Most Valuable Player. He batted .264 with Erie that year. Castellanos was blocked at third base by Miguel Cabrera and at first base by Prince Fielder. He has been seen as a potential centerpiece for a trade to acquire a marquee talent. However, the Tigers considered Castellanos untouchable in trade negotiations. Castellanos began to take outfield practice in left field during the 2012 season. With Castellanos now playing left field on a full-time basis, the Tigers optioned him to the Toledo Mud Hens of the Class AAA International League at the start of the 2013 season. In 134 games for the Mud Hens, Castellanos batted .276 with 18 home runs and 76 RBIs. He appeared in the Triple-A All-Star Game and was named to the International League's post-season All-Star team. =Detroit Tigers= 2013–2016 Castellanos fielding for the Tigers in spring training, 2012 When major league rosters expanded on September 1, 2013, Castellanos was among the players promoted to the Tigers, and made his major league debut that day, playing left field. On September 7, Castellanos made his first major league start, and recorded his first major league hit, an infield single, off Danny Duffy. However, he received infrequent playing time, as the Tigers were in a pennant race and manager Jim Leyland preferred to use players with more major league experience. He batted 5-for-18 with the Tigers in 2013. After the 2013 season, the Tigers traded Prince Fielder. Dave Dombrowski, the general manager of the Tigers at that time, said that they would shift Miguel Cabrera to first base, and use Castellanos as their starting third baseman for 2014. Castellanos hit his first MLB home run on April 9, 2014 off the top of the wall in dead center field off Josh Beckett of the Los Angeles Dodgers at Dodger Stadium. He finished his rookie season with a .259 batting average, 11 home runs, 31 doubles and 66 RBIs. He was named the 2014 Detroit Tigers/Detroit Sports Broadcasters Association Rookie of the Year. On July 22, 2015, Castellanos hit his first career grand slam off Mike Montgomery of the Seattle Mariners. Castellanos hit .255 this season, while slamming 15 home runs and driving in 73. Through the All-Star break of the 2016 season, Castellanos was hitting .302 with 17 home runs and 51 RBIs, while playing as the Tigers' starting third baseman. On August 6, Castellanos was struck by a pitch from New York Mets reliever Logan Verrett, fracturing the fifth metacarpal bone in his left hand. After the game, Castellanos was placed on the 15-day disabled list for the first time in his career, and was expected to miss at least four weeks. Castellanos did not return to the Tigers until the final week of the regular season, entering a September 27 game against the Cleveland Indians as a pinch hitter. During the 2016 season, Castellanos set career highs with a .285 average, 18 home runs, .331 on-base percentage, and a .496 slugging percentage, despite being limited to 110 games. 2017–2019 On January 13, 2017, the Tigers avoided arbitration with Castellanos, agreeing on a one-year contract worth $3 million. On July 18, Castellanos hit a single, triple and two home runs in a game against the Kansas City Royals, becoming the fourth Tigers player to do so since 1913, and the first Tigers player to do so since Dmitri Young in 2003. With the acquisition of third baseman Jeimer Candelario and the departure of right fielder J. D. Martinez, both in July trades, Castellanos began playing games in right field from early September to the end of the 2017 season. On September 29, Castellanos recorded his 100th RBI of the season. Castellanos became the 10th player in Tigers history to drive in more than 100 runs at the age of 25 or younger, and the first player to do so since Miguel Cabrera in 2008. He became the sixth player in Tigers history to record 10 or more triples, 25 or more home runs and 100 or more RBIs in a season, and the first player to do so since Al Kaline in 1956. Castellanos finished 2017 with a .272 batting average, while setting career highs in doubles (36), triples (10), home runs (26) and RBI (101). His 10 triples led the American League. On January 17, 2018, the Tigers avoided arbitration with Castellanos, agreeing on a one-year contract worth $6.05 million. On August 13, Castellanos went 5-for-5 with 5 RBIs, for his first career five-hit game. He became the first Tigers player with five hits in a game since Ian Kinsler in 2015. With two singles, two doubles and a home run, he also became the first Tiger with 10 total bases in a game since Justin Upton in 2017. Castellanos earned American League Player of the Week honors for the week of August 13–19. In seven games, he batted .393 with an OBP of .485, and had two homers, three doubles, eight runs scored and ten RBI. The award was the first weekly honor for any Tiger player in 2018, and the first since J.D. Martinez won the award for the week ending July 17, 2017. Castellanos hit a career-high .298 in the 2018 season, adding 23 home runs and 89 RBI. He finished among the AL leaders in hits (185, third), doubles (46, fourth) and multi-hit games (56, third). He also led all MLB hitters (60 or more plate appearances) in batting average against left- handers, at .381.Splits Leaderboards  FanGraphs He was named the 2018 Tiger of the Year by the Detroit Chapter of the Baseball Writers Association of America (BBWAA). On January 11, 2019, the Tigers avoided arbitration with Castellanos, agreeing on a one-year contract worth $9.95 million. =Chicago Cubs= On July 31, 2019, the Tigers traded Castellanos along with cash considerations to the Chicago Cubs in exchange for Alex Lange and Paul Richan. In the month of August, Castellanos hit .348 with 11 homers, 20 RBIs, and 9 doubles to go along with a .385 on-base percentage and a .713 slugging percentage.

Castellanos' 58 doubles were the tenth-highest single-season total in MLB history, earning him the nickname \\"Nicky Two Bags.\\" He also joined Hall of Famers Hank Greenberg (1934) and Joe Medwick (1937) as the only right-handed batters to ever hit 55+ doubles and 25+ home runs in the same season. On defense in 2019, he had a −9 Defensive Runs Saved (DRS) rating, the lowest in the major leagues among right fielders. =Cincinnati Reds= On January 27, 2020, Castellanos signed a 4-year $64 million dollar contract with the Cincinnati Reds.

Randolph Engineering, Inc. is also the prime contractor for aviator sunglasses to the United States military. History Photograph of the Randolph Engineering, Inc. manufacturing facility in Randolph, Massachusetts. (2013 photo)Jan Waszkiewicz and Stanley Zaleski formed the company in 1972 in Randolph, Massachusetts, where the company remains to this day. Jan Waszkiewicz was born in Poland, but he and his family fled Poland on Christmas Eve 1939 after the Germans overran Poland. His long journey took him through Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Italy and into southern France. He joined the French Army, but soon was captured and became a prisoner of war for three months. He soon escaped and fled into Switzerland and then on to England where he joined the English Army and later became a Royal Air Force navigator, flying 32 bomber missions. He had heard a lot of stories about America and at the end of the war settled in Boston, Massachusetts, because it was culturally similar to Europe. After arriving in Boston he continued his education at Northeastern University and got a job as a tool and die maker. He later found employment at the American Optical Company and then Marine Optical. Convinced that he could design and manufacture better eyeglass frame manufacturing equipment, he and his partner Stanley Zaleski formed Randolph Engineering, Inc. in 1972. The company originally focused on designing and manufacturing optical tools and machinery for the production of eyewear. Waszkiewicz and Zaleski designed and made most of the machinery in their plant, but over time the company turned its attention to making its own eyewear, using the tools and machinery designed and manufactured by their company. In 1977, Randolph Engineering obtained its first government contract. By 1982, they had become the prime contractor for military-style Type HGU-4/P aviator sunglasses for the United States Department of Defense. With 68 employees, 200,000 pairs of sunglasses were made for the Navy, Air Force, and Army that year. Since that time they have provided eyewear for many government agencies, ranging from sunglasses for air force pilots to eyewear for submarine personnel. In the early 1990s sales were expanded to offer their products to the consumer marketplace. By August 2008, the company had expanded its eyewear offerings to include other specialty lines of sunglasses for police, security personnel, outdoor sports enthusiasts and other sight-critical occupations and outdoor enthusiasts. Presently the company supplies the military with a variety of glasses and frames including contracts with the Defense Logistics Agency worth $9 million each. The current contract is valued at $38,662,664 and was issued on December 23, 2011. In 2011, the company had approximately $8 million in sales. All glasses are made at the U.S. location in Randolph, Massachusetts using only a handful of international components. Sales are handled through their website, large retailers and world-wide distributors. Randolph Engineering has positioned itself as a vendor to other Air Forces around the world including Australia, Belgium, Israel, and Jordan. The Alliance for the Commonwealth and the Massachusetts Port Authority awarded Randolph the 1997 Massachusetts Product Export Achievement Award in recognition for achievements made in International trade. Randolph sponsored the world's first transcontinental biofueled flight. Pilot Ross McCurdy, his son Aedan, and co-pilot Alex Schenck completed their 10 day trip to Santa Monica, CA from Smithfield, RI, with stops made in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas, Arkansas, and Arizona. The flight marked the first transcontinental flight and round trip completed in a light aircraft powered by biofuel, which is made with a blend of renewable Camelina plant seed oil.

Spanning , it serves as a north/south arterial road through the city of Ogden, from SR-26 (Riverdale Road) to US-89 just north of Ogden in Harrisville. Route description State Route 204 begins just south of the Ogden-South Ogden border, at the intersection of Wall Avenue and Riverdale Road (SR-26). From there it travels north along Wall Avenue passing along the east edge of the Newgate Mall. As it travels north, it crosses the one-way pair of 31st and 30th streets (SR-79), one of several east-west arterials that provide access to Interstate 15 to the west. Continuing north, the route passes Union Station at the west end of Historic 25th Street. Just north of Union Station, Wall Avenue passes under the viaduct for 24th Street (SR-53), immediately followed by the Ogden Intermodal Hub on the west, which serves the FrontRunner commuter rail and Utah Transit Authority bus lines. At this point, the route also passes just one block west of Lindquist Field, the baseball stadium for the Ogden Raptors minor league baseball team. Continuing north, Wall Avenue crosses another one-way pair of streets, 21st and 20th streets (SR-104), followed by the Ogden River and 12th Street (SR-39), before ending just north of the city limits in Harrisville at Harrisville Road (US-89). History In 1931, the Utah State Road Commission designated State Route 103 in the area of what would later become State Route 204. However, it is unclear whether this route followed the exact alignment of Route 204, based on the legislative descriptions of 1931 \\"From West Ogden northerly to junction with route 1 at North Ogden Hot Springs\\", and 1933 \\"From Ogden, at a point between Washington avenue and Wall avenue northerly to junction with Route 1 at North Ogden Hot Springs.\\". The route was deleted in 1935 and the route number was transferred to a section of Harrison Boulevard. State Route 204 was first designated in 1939 as running from Utah Hot Springs (now the location of Hot Springs Junction southerly via a diagonal route and Wall Street to Route 1 on Riverdale Road (now SR-26). At the time, Route 1 ran from the hot springs southeast along what is now Pleasant View Drive through Pleasant View and North Ogden, then south along Washington Boulevard. In 1945, Route 1 in North Ogden was realigned to the south to follow the more southerly diagonal section of Route 204 (now US-89), truncating the latter to its current northern terminus where Wall Avenue ends at US-89, while the former alignment of Route 1 through Pleasant View was designated as State Route 235. The route has been unchanged since.

Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli (R) assailed the Act as encouraging exterminators to dump the District of Columbia’s rats into bordering Virginia. Similar concerns were voiced by Maryland legislator Pat McDonough (R-Baltimore). See also One commentator referred to the Act as providing \\"Right to Life for Rodents\\"! See also The controversy went national when it was aired by Rush Limbaugh and soon picked up as well by Huffington Post. District of Columbia Council Member Mary Cheh (D), author of the Act, spoke on Fox News, claiming that critics' statements misrepresented it.

The film debuted at the Berlin International Film Festival in February 2011 and online on January 5, 2012. Dimanche is the first professional film by Doyon, a native of Montreal. Doyon had previously created a three-minute animated short Square Roots in 2006, while enrolled in the NFB's Hothouse program for young animators. Still learning how to use computer animation tools, he worked with pen and pencil to create Dimanche, hand drawing the entire film. The 10-minute film took him two years to complete, creating individual drawings on paper, working on a light table. Doyon ended up with 15 boxes full of sheets with sketches, which he then scanned into the computer, colourized and began editing. Doyon believes such traditional animation techniques are better for portraying emotion. Awards The film was nominated Best Animated Short Film at the 84th Academy Awards as well as Best Animated Short Subject at the 39th Annie Awards. It also received the ASIFA-Colorado Award for the Best Animated Short at the 34th Denver Film Festival. It also received Quebec’s Prix Jutra for best animated short.  Plot  Dimanche tells the story of a young boy who goes to his grandparents' house in a small town in Quebec after church on Sunday. Bored with the adult world, he wanders outside to indulge his hobby of creating elongated coins by placing them on train tracks. Doyon has said that the film is inspired by his youth in Desbiens, Quebec.

The PPI was developed by Scott Lilienfeld and Brian Andrews to assess these traits in non-criminal (e.g. university students) populations, though it is still used in clinical (e.g. incarcerated) populations as well. In contrast to other psychopathy measures, such as the Hare Psychopathy Checklist (PCL), the PPI is a self-report scale, rather than interview-based, assessment. It is intended to comprehensively index psychopathic personality traits without assuming particular links to anti-social or criminal behaviors. It also includes measures to detect impression management or careless responding. Factor structure =Development= Original subscales The items used in the original version of the PPI were based on a number of conceptual constructs theorized (by previous researchers such as Hervey Cleckley and Robert D. Hare) to be related to psychopathy. It consists of a series of statements to which subjects respond on how accurately the statement describes them using a 4-point Likert scale (\\"False, \\"Mostly False\\", \\"Mostly True\\", \\"True\\"). Factor Analysis of the initial 160 items revealed 8 factors: * Machiavellian Egocentricity (ME): A lack of empathy and sense of detachment from others for the sake of achieving one's own goals * Social Potency (SOP): The ability to charm and influence others * Coldheartedness (C): A distinct lack of emotion, guilt, or regard for others' feelings * Carefree Nonplanfulness (CN): Difficulty in planning ahead and considering the consequences of one's actions * Fearlessness (F): An eagerness for risk-seeking behaviors, as well as a lack of the fear that normally goes with them * Blame Externalization (BE): Inability to take responsibility for one's actions, instead blaming others or rationalizing one's behavior * Impulsive Nonconformity (IN): A disregard for social norms and culturally acceptable behaviors * Stress Immunity (STI): A lack of typical marked reactions to traumatic or otherwise stress-inducing events Additionally, the PPI also included two special validity scales designed to detect participants who were giving random, inconsistent, or insincere answers. This was to avoid attempts at malingering, and to eliminate subjects who seemed to have difficulty understanding multiple items. Revised factors In 2005, the PPI was revised. The new version, called the PPI-R, included a reorganization of the 8 subscales into two (sometimes three) new higher-order factors: PPI-1:Fearless Dominance (FD), consisting of the Social Potency, Stress Immunity, and Fearlessness subscales. Associated with less anxiety, depression, and empathy as well as higher well-being, assertiveness, narcissism, and thrill-seeking. PPI-2: Self-Centered Impulsivity (SCI), consisting of the Carefree Nonplanfulness, Impulsive Nonconformity, Machiavellian Egocentricity, and Blame Externalization subscales. Associated with impulsivity, aggressiveness, substance use, antisocial behavior, negative affect, and suicidal ideation. A person may score at different levels on the different factors, but the total score indicates the overall extent of psychopathic personality. Higher scores on factor I are associated with emotional stability and social efficacy, as well as reduced empathy. Higher scores on factor II are associated with maladaptive tendencies, including aggressiveness, substance use problems, negative feelings and suicidal ideation. Scores on the two major factors tend to be only moderately correlated. =Use of coldheartedness= Although independent analyses of the PPI's factor structure have shown support for the validity of the new 2-factor model, there is some data that suggests that a 3-factor model may be better. Many analyses of the PPI tend to exclude Coldheartedness and focus only on FD and SCI, but some studies have shown the two factors to be less statistically reliable when Coldheartedness is not also considered separately. Thus, some researchers are starting to use it as a distinct third factor in their analyses, as such meanness was a central part of Cleckley's conceptualization of a psychopath (see The Mask of Sanity). Coldheartedness has also been shown to be distinct from the other two factors when comparing across other personality models, such as the Five Factor Model (FFM). In particular, Coldheartedness has significantly negative correlations with the Openness and Agreeableness dimensions of the FFM. In 2015, researchers from Baylor University proposed the connection between psychopaths' cold-heartedness and their inability to “catch” the contagious yawning. Those who had more psychopathic qualities were less likely to yawn while watching the yawning clip. =Relationship to other psychopathy theories= The Fearless Dominance and Self-Centered Impulsivity factors are similar to the concepts of primary and secondary psychopathy. Like Primary Psychopathy, FD traits are related to a lack of emotional responsivity but accurate perception of those emotions in others. Conversely, secondary psychopathy and SCI traits are related to difficulties in both emotional perception and control of negative emotional responses, such as anxiety, irritation, and aggressiveness. =Validity= Construct validity The PPI is based on a personality-centric theory of psychopathy. Thus, to demonstrate construct validity, the PPI should \\"behave\\" as a measure of psychopathy is hypothesized to behave according to personality theory of psychopathy. According to this theory, psychopaths should possess a number of specific personality traits, including low Conscientiousness, socialization, and empathy, as well as high impulsivity and sometimes aggression. Preliminary research suggests that the PPI behaves as the personality theory of psychopathy says it should. For example, one study of 100 male inmates found total PPI scores to be negatively correlated with empathy and positively correlated with aggressive behavior and borderline personality traits (such as impulsiveness, substance abuse, and unstable personal relationships). Additional studies have reexamined the same variables in light of the revision of the PPI into its two new higher order factors. Splitting the PPI into two separate factor scores (instead of using only the total score) allowed new relationships that were otherwise obscured to be revealed. These included PPI-1 having a strong correlation with measures of Dominance and extraversion, whereas the total score and PPI-2 had no such relationship, but PPI-2 did show a moderate association with substance abuse and anxiety. These relationships are consistent with the conceptualizations of the two factors. Thus, the PPI shows validity as a measure capable of assessing the personality theory of psychopathy. Criterion validity The PPI demonstrates strong levels of criterion validity. It shows modest correlations with the PCL, which is considered the \\"gold standard\\" of psychopathy assessments. Any discrepancies in scores have been theorized to stem from the fact that the PPI was designed for non-forensic populations and thus focuses more on personality than behavior, while the PCL (designed to assess the disorder in criminals) puts more emphasis on antisocial behaviors in its scoring system. Additionally, each measure uses a different form of data collection (interviews and a review of personal history vs. self-reports), which could also contribute to weaker correlations between the two scores, as discrepancies in the information obtained may result in very different conclusions. Concurrent validity The PPI exhibits moderate to strong correlations with other measures of psychopathy when used in cross-sectional designs. As stated earlier, the PCL and its derivatives are often used in criminal settings and consists of a semi-structured interview and review of the subject's criminal records. Despite being very different in format, some of the factors of the PPI correlate with the factors of the PCL. One series of studies found moderate correlations between PPI-SCI and PCL Factor 2, which like PPI-SCI examines impulsive and antisocial tendencies. The correlations between PPI-FD and PCL Factor 1 (which both examine interpersonal relations and emotional deficits) were not nearly as strong, but the researchers suggested that this was due to the method variance (self-report vs. interview/file review), and that the correlations were typical for measures of the same construct using different methods. Because of this, it has been suggested that the PPI and interview- based measures of psychopathy like the PCL examine unique aspects of psychopathy while still sharing some overlap. Gender differences Because of the disproportionately large number of male inmates compared to female, some studies have explored whether the validity of the PPI is affected by the gender of the population. One study used an incarcerated female sample to test this, and found that while the statistical reliability of the PPI factors was the below the normal average for men, the measure proved to be satisfactory at assessing psychopathic traits in comparison to the PCL, the measure most commonly used to assess psychopathy in prison samples. In comparison to other self-report measures, another study compared a female undergraduate sample with an incarcerated female sample. Although the measure correlated well with other self-report measures of psychopathy in both samples, the mean total scores between the two samples was the same, despite prisons normally having a far higher concentration of psychopaths than the general population. This suggests that the PPI has greater difficulty in detecting psychopathic traits in female criminals, possibly due to the expression of psychopathy varying by sex. = Application = In 2016 psychologist Dr Kevin Dutton ranked the psychopathic traits of the US historical and political figures using the PPI-R. According to that assessment, Adolf Hitler scored 169 points, Donald Trump received 171. Margaret Thatcher scored 136 points and Elizabeth I scored 130. Jesus and Saint Paul both scored 157 points. According to Dutton, politicians and business leaders often demonstrate psychopathic qualities. Criticism =Fearless dominance = Some researchers have criticized the status of the Fearless Dominance (FD) factor of the PPI-R as an orthogonal factor of the psychopathy construct. A 2012 Meta-analysis found that while the FD and SCI factors of the PPI-R did not overlap much, FD had very weak or non- statistically significant correlations with variables normally associated with psychopathy (such as anti-social behavior, violence, or substance abuse). When compared to other two-factor models of psychopathy (such as the two factors of the PCL-R), the SCI and PPI-R total score correlated well with their corresponding factors, but FD had weak correlations with its supposed PCL equivalent. On the contrary, PPI-FD's best relationships were with positive personality traits, such as extroversion. This observation caused the researchers to suggest that the FD factor, examined alone, is actually more indicative of the personality of a mentally healthy, well-adjusted individual. They thus concluded that FD was not a valid factor of psychopathy by itself, as it did not appear to fit into the pathological definitions of psychopathic personality conceptually or empirically. In response, some of the creators and supporters of the PPI-R defended Fearless Dominance as a legitimate aspect of psychopathy, arguing that the authors of the meta-analysis were misinterpreting the role and importance of the factor. They contended that FD helps to distinguish psychopathy from other personality disorders, such as antisocial personality disorder, and that the traits that were similar to well-adjusted individuals are part of the \\"mask\\" psychopaths put on in public. Without the presence of the FD factor (in their opinion), psychopathy would be a mere subset of anti-social behavior. They also criticized the choice of comparison variables the meta-analysis employed, noting that anti-social behavior and substance abuse are more commonly associated with the SCI factor rather than the FD factor (which would cover areas such as low empathy and immunity to stress), so their data would naturally result in weak FD correlations. Furthermore, the fact that the PCL and PPI-R are designed for different types of sample populations (criminal vs. community), and thus could have very different outcomes and relationships when comparing factors, was reason to doubt the conclusions of the meta-analysis. The authors of the meta- analysis quickly attempted to address some of these criticisms. They contended that the PPI-R supporters were downplaying the role of anti-social behavior in assessing psychopathy, and that doing so could result in accidentally identifying otherwise normal extroverts as psychopathic. They also reemphasized the fact that the FD factor's best correlations were with positive personality traits such as extroversion, which to them suggests that the FD factor is a better indicator of psychological well-being rather than malfunction. Furthermore, they accused their critics of cherry picking their selections of data in order to support their own claims while criticizing the conclusions of the meta-analysis. In the end, most researchers agree that Fearless Dominance, by itself, is not a sufficient indicator of psychopathy, and that anti-social behavior does need to be a prominent feature regardless of whether the psychopath is a criminal or an ordinary citizen. The authors of the meta-analysis did admit that some of the more pathological components of FD (such as unconcern for other or self-assurance) may have a place in the description of psychopathic traits, but that a high presence of these in an individual in the absence of other psychopathy factors is not truly psychopathic personality or behavior. The two parties thus ultimately continued to disagree on the place of FD in psychopathy, with PPI-R supporters maintaining that the factor is an important distinguishing feature of the disorder, and their critics claiming it is ultimately unnecessary and may be better suited in assessing social adjustment and sanity (rather than the \\"moral insanity\\" of psychopaths). =Self-report related issues= Because the PPI and PPI-R are self-report measures, there are several potential weaknesses in using it with certain populations or under certain circumstances. Positive impression management In criminal populations, psychopathy assessments are often used in threat assessment to determine if inmates are fit for early release or solitary confinement. Thus, it is often beneficial to inmates to appear less psychopathic (less callous or manipulative, more empathetic, etc.) in order to receive a more positive assessment or judgment. Although the PPI has a validity scale built into it, the measure was designed using populations in which no real \\"stakes\\" were involved, which may have resulted in the measure being prone to manipulation by the taker when there is a need to appear \\"less\\" psychopathic. One study that explored this used a social desirability scale as well as a few direct questions about participants' honesty and motivation, given after completing the PPI. The data showed that participants who were instructed to be \\"faking good\\" (intentionally trying to create a positive impression) had lower mean scores on the PPI and higher scores on the social desirability scale than those who were given no instructions or told to be honest in their answers. Despite the validity scales built into the PPI being able to indicate when such response distortion was occurring in many of the cases, a significant number of misclassifications were observed. Thus, the researchers concluded that the PPI was vulnerable to manipulation by respondents consciously attempting to present themselves in a positive light, which could limit its utility in criminal populations or any situations in which users have a significant motivation to appear well-adjusted. The study has not yet been replicated using the revised form of the scale, the PPI-R, however. Malingering Individuals may sometimes benefit from appearing to be mentally ill, such as when attempting an insanity defense. In relation to psychopathy, individuals possessing psychopathic traits are often more apt to engage in this sort of deception for practical or amusement purposes, and thus may possibly pose a greater risk for malingering than other populations. Thus, the PPI (being a self-report measure) may be similarly vulnerable to malingering. As in the case of positive impression management, the validity scales built into the PPI were designed to detect such manipulation. One study that examined whether these scales could reliably detect feigned psychosis found that these scales did indeed classify malingering effects correctly with over 95% accuracy, including individuals with high scores. This was in spite of the fact that participants were specifically told to fake some form of insanity (having even been given common symptoms of several mental illnesses to assist them), as well as being made aware that the instrument (the PPI) was designed to detect faking beforehand. Thus, the researchers concluded that higher PPI scores were not associated with greater success at malingering on the PPI (other psychopathy measures, such as the PCL and the Psychopathic Deviate scale of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, were used to further confirm the presence of psychopathic traits). However, because the sample did not include any participants meeting criteria for an official diagnosis of psychosis, it is unknown whether those with an actual mental illness would also be classified correctly on the validity scales. As with positive impression management, this study has yet to be replicated with the PPI-R.

They were built in Dutch shipyards to a design by the British Yarrow Shipbuilders, which was based on the destroyer , which Yarrow had designed and built for the British Royal Navy.Gardiner and Chesneau 1980, p. 390. The ship's main gun armament was four guns built by the Swedish company Bofors, mounted two forward and two aft, with two anti-aircraft guns mounted amidships. Four 12.7 mm machine guns provided close-in anti-aircraft defence. The ship's torpedo armament comprised six torpedo tubes in two triple mounts, while 24 mines could also be carried. To aid search operations, the ship carried a Fokker C.VII-W floatplane on a platform over the aft torpedo tubes, which was lowered to the sea by a crane for flight operations.Whitley 2000, pp. 210–211. Service history The ship was laid down on 5 August 1925, at the Burgerhout's Scheepswerf en Machinefabriek in Rotterdam, and launched on 29 December 1926. The ship was commissioned on 12 April 1928. She and her sister De Ruyter left the Netherlands on 27 September 1928, for the Dutch East Indies. On 29 July 1929, Evertsen, De Ruyter, the cruiser , and the submarines and , left Surabaya, and steamed to Tanjung Priok. At Tanjung Priok the ships waited for the royal yacht Maha Chakri of the king of Siam and the destroyer Phra Ruang. After this the ships, without the submarines, visited Bangka, Belitung, Riau, Lingga Islands, Belawan, and Deli. On 28 August, they returned in Tanjung Priok. On 31 August, she participates in a fleet review at Tanjung Priok, held in honor of the Dutch Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, who was born that day. Other ships that participated in the review where the destroyer De Ruyter and the cruiser Java. While practicing with the cruiser , De Ruyter, and five submarines, Sumatra stranded on an uncharted reef near the island Kebatoe, on 14 May 1931. Sumatra was later pulled free by and a tugboat. On 13 November 1936, Sumatra and Java, and the destroyers Evertsen, , and , made a fleet visit to Singapore. Before the visit they had practiced in the South China Sea. =World War II= From 1940 to 1942, she served as a convoy escort , mainly in the Dutch East Indies. At the end of February 1942, in the aftermath of the Battle of the Java Sea, Evertsen (Luitenant ter zee W. M. De Vries, commanding), was ordered to escape from Tanjung Priok to Tjilatjap via the Sunda Strait, in company with the Australian light cruiser HMAS Perth and the American heavy cruiser USS Houston. Perth and Houston departed at 19:00 on 28 February, but Evertsen was delayed, leaving port two hours later. The route through the Strait had earlier been reported clear by Allied intelligence, but unfortunately a Japanese invasion fleet with its close covering force of two heavy cruisers, one light cruiser and nine destroyers had started landing troops that night in Banten Bay, at the eastern end of Sunda Strait. Perth and Houston ran into this force, and in a ferocious night action that ended after midnight on 1 March, both ships were sunk. Evertsen was attempting to catch up with Houston and Perth. Her crew sighted the gunfire of the main action, and managed to evade the Japanese main force. However, Evertsen was then engaged by two Japanese destroyers (Murakumo and Shirakumo) in the Strait, and on fire and in a sinking condition, grounded herself on a reef near Sebuku Island. The surviving crew abandoned ship just as the aft magazine exploded and blew off the stern; they were taken prisoner by the Japanese on 9–10 March 1942.

Approved protective eyewear includes both military standard and commercial styles. Soldiers serve in different situations with different types of risk for eye injury, from ballistic projectiles. Some styles can accommodate prescription lenses. Several types of goggles are available because they are optimized for certain purposes, such as regular use, use in vehicles, or use with night vision goggles. Some fit over regular eyeglasses, some can accommodate prescription lenses, and others are designed for those who do not wear eyeglasses. The Army's New Protective Eyewear Larry T. Hasty, Engineer magazine, April–June, 2005, pp. 26-27 Performance Eyewear on the APEL must meet the standards established by the Army Vision Conservation and Readiness Program. For ballistic resistance, this program requires that eyewear meet the current ANSI Z87 civilian standard.The Army Vision Conservation and Readiness Program Department of the (U.S.) Army, 2009, pp. 14-15 Then the U.S. military standard (MIL-PRF-31013) must also be met. The U.S. civilian standard for protective eyewear was revised in 2010. The previous version from 2003 was organized by the type of protector. The Z87.1-2010 version is organized by the type of hazard such as droplet and splash, impact, optical radiation, dust, fine dust, and mist.ANSI/ISEA Z87.1-2010: Frequently Asked Questions about the New Standard Also, the 2003 version specified that protective products be marked as providing “Basic” or “High Impact” protection. In the Z87.1-2010 standard, there is no longer a distinction between levels of ballistic protection. Products are either non-impact or impact protectors. Products marked as impact protectors must pass all high-impact testing requirements and are marked as “Z87+”. Non-impact protectors are those which do not pass all high-impact testing requirements and are therefore marked only with “Z87” (no “+” sign). The U.S. military standard (MIL-PRF-31013), requires (at a minimum) that ballistic eyewear can always withstand a 0.15 caliber, 5.8 grain, T37 shaped projectile at a velocity of 640 to 660 feet per second (approximately 3.8 mm 0.376 g at a velocity of 195 – 201 m/s). Goggles are required to stop a 17-grain fragment simulating projectile moving at a speed of 550 feet per second (approximately twice the energy impact of spectacles). For testing, the velocity of the projectile must be verified using sound or optical chronograph methods. The eyewear is put on an Alderson 50th percentile male headform. A 0.002 inch thick aluminum foil “witness sheet” is placed behind the area of impact. This sheet shows whether any small pieces penetrate or come off of the eyewear during the test. The eyewear being tested is hit one time straight on slightly toward the outside of the center of the lens. The eyewear fails the test if the aluminum foil witness sheet is punctured or if the eyewear is cracked. In addition to ballistic performance, the U.S. military standard includes requirements for optical clarity, protection from UV rays, fit, chemical resistance, and environmental stability (properties won’t be changed by exposure to a range of temperatures or levels of humidity).MIL-PRF-31013 Performance Specification: Spectacles, Special Protective Eyewear Cylindrical System (SPECS), 1996 Though soldiers are increasingly exposed to explosive threats, there is currently no testing or performance requirements for blast resistance of approved eyewear.

AIPT In 1948, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) President, Dr. Karl Compton, MIT board of trustees, and Earl Eames, a graduating senior in chemical engineering, active in student government, sought ways in which the institute could join the international cooperative undertaking to rebuild war- torn Europe. As a result of their effort, they formed the U.S. chapter of the newly created International Association for the Exchange of Students for Technical Experience (IAESTE-US). Two years later in 1950, their first exchange programs occurred when they sent 37 American students to apply their engineering skills in jobs abroad, while American employers welcomed 30 foreign trainees to complete short-term training assignments in the United States. Students and participating employers soon found the effort extremely valuable in many dimensions: as an excellent tool of public diplomacy, as a new way for forward-thinking corporations to identify talent and form an international workforce. By 1980, the organization grew beyond the technical fields and established professional programs, becoming AIPT. AIPT was known for its positive workplace culture and low employee turnover with employees spending close to nine years with the organization on average. Karen Krug, AIPT’s CFO set the record with 32 years of service (1980-2012) followed by its CEO, Elizabeth Chazottes, with 25 years (1987-2011). CDS International In the 1920s, Carl Duisberg, CEO of Bayer AG in Germany, initiated the first transatlantic work-study programs between the United States and Germany with the help of the Deutsche Studentenwerke's (German Student Association) New York City office. As hoped, program alumni rose to prominent positions following World War II at leading firms such as AEG, Bayer, Bosch, Daimler- Benz, and Siemens, by introducing in Germany the mass production methods and business practices learned in the United States. The alumni from these initial exchanges founded the Carl Duisberg Gesellschaft (CDG) in 1949 to help engineers, businessmen, and farmers gain international work experience necessary for rebuilding post-war Germany and Europe. In 1968, the Carl Duisberg Society was founded in New York City as a non-profit organization designed to rekindle Duisberg's original exchanges and to facilitate international career training opportunities for Americans and Germans. The name was officially changed to CDS International in 1987 to reflect the organization's increasingly international nature of its programs beyond Germany to include partners in other European countries, Asia and Latin America.

Darumbal people of the Keppel Islands and surrounding regions are sometimes also known as Woppaburra or Ganumi, and the terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Country Map of traditional lands of Aboriginal people around Mackay, Rockhampton and Gladstone, Queensland. Traditional Darumbal land is considered to encompass an estimated around most of coastal Central Queensland, running from Arthur Point at Shoalwater Bay to Yeppoon, and taking in the mouth of Fitzroy River and Keppel Islands. From Keppel Bay they extended inland to Boomer Range, and Marlborough, Yaamba, Rockhampton, and Gracemere. Language Ethnologue classifies the Darumbal language as \\"extinct\\". Technically, Bayali was quite distinct from Darumbal, sharing, according to Dixon's analysis, no more than 21% of its basic word stock with Darumbal. Society The Darumbal comprised some 13 hordes, though one of these was described as belonging to the Ningebal tribe. One extinct branch of the group, the Warabal, may have dwelt around the foot of the Boomer Range. History With the arrival of European settlers in the region, some Darumbal people were tolerated as part of fringe communities of the new settlements, but most were systematically killed to make way for pastoral development. According to some estimates, \\"between 1865 and 1902 the population of the Keppel Islands suffered a substantial reduction of 75 to 80 per cent\\". In one incident alone on July 1865 alone, native troopers ambushed a Darumbal ceremonial gathering outside Rockhampton, near Samuel Birkbeck's Glenmore Station and shot dead 18 Aborigines, after nearby settlers expressed worries about the presence of natives in their area. After the massacre, they then set fire to the corpses. Native title Darumbal Native Title claims and land use issues have become prominent in recent years. In 2001, a claim was made to the National Native Title Tribunal, and in 2007 137 hectares at Mount Wheeler were handed over to the tribe. There have been several controversies regarding fisheries licensing and conservation. Darumbal people have been granted limited access to the Shoalwater Bay Military Training Area. Although the language is extinct, some Darumbal words live on in place names in Central Queensland.

A new church building was consecrated in 1767. It was a timber-framed, cruciform building that was painted red. That church was soon too small for the parish, so in 1880, a new church was built just south of the old church. After the new church was completed, the old church was torn down and the materials were sold. The 1880-church was also a cruciform shape, but the inner corners were cut off, forming more of an octagonal central area.

Architect, polemicist and theoretician, Claude Parent was the first person in France to make a sharp epistemological break with modernism, beginning in the mid 1950s. Through articles, books, magnificent manifesto-drawings and built projects, his work has enabled us to rethink our understanding and evolve our grasp of space. From the Maison Drusch (1963) all the way to his project for the Musée du Prado (1995), he has sought to create discontinuity by shifting and tipping volumes and by fracturing of the plan. Essentially self-taught, he began his career with Ionel Schein, with whom he worked until 1955. He also participated in the Espace group, founded in 1951 by the artists André Bloc and Félix del Marle. The Architecture Principe group (1963–68) was born out of his encounter with Paul Virilio. As was the adventure of the oblique function, their innovation through the continuity of the inclined plane, which led to the construction of the l’Eglise Sainte-Bernadette-du-Banlay in Nevers (1966). After the 1968 split with Virilio, Claude Parent continued to experiment, develop and build the oblique function into his projects (Claude Parent's own house in Neuilly, painter Andrée Bellaguet's apartment) as well as in temporary installations in several Maisons de la Culture (Culture centers in France in the late 60s). In 1970, he curates and designs the French Pavilion at the 35th Venice Art Biennale, Italy, inviting artists such as Gérard Mannoni, Gilles Ehrmann, Samuel Buri; François Morellet, Andrée Bellaguet, Jean-Pierre Cousin and Charles Maussion. Claude Parent's space design (called \\"The Line of the Greatest Slope\\") is the first successful attempt to construct an oblique space. Imagined alone, but elaborated collectively, the French pavilion is considered by Parent as \\"a collective act [...] a creative action.\\" With this event, Claude Parent transforms the viewer into works of art. This experiment becomes his working material and the reactions, positive as well as negative, will form the basis of the architect's study. Parent also designed several superstores in “béton brut” or “raw concrete” in Ris Orangis (1969) and Sens (1970), among others. In 1974, a few months after the oil crisis, EDF (France's production and distribution power company), Parent, 47, is entrusted with the coordination of a group of architects including, among others Paul Andreu, Jean Willerval and Roger Taillibert. For the next 10 years he leads the group to redesign nuclear power plants and find ways to better integrate them in the landscape. Commissions from the public sector for the French Education Department, the Regional Council of Provence Alpes Côte d’Azur in Marseille (1991), the Charles de Gaulle airport exchange center (1995) and the French Pavilion facade at the Venice Biennale of Architecture (1996) are all expressions of his quest for disequilibrium, movement and fluidity in architecture. Demanding, critical, provocative and fiercely obstinate, Claude Parent has continuously proposed places of contradiction generating doubt and disquiet and excluding any sort of passiveness with regard to architecture. Though destined for a career as an engineer in the field of aeronautics, Claude Parent enrolled in the École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts of Toulouse in 1943 in the architecture studio, and then in 1946 in the École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts of Paris. He left before obtaining his diploma in architecture, and later founded his own firm in 1956, but was only recognized by and admitted to the Order of Architects in 1966, based on his experience. An Academician, Claude Parent is a Commander of the French Legion of Honor, a Commander of Arts and Letters, Officer of the Palmes Académiques and a Commander of the National Order of Merit. Prizes stand as milestones marking his entire career: National Grand Prize of Architecture (1979), the silver medal of the Academy of Architecture, the medal of the Central Union of the Decorative Arts, the gold medal of the Society for the Encouragement of Progress and the medal of the U.I.A for his work in criticism. In 1994, Architecture critic and curator Fréderic Migayrou celebrates Claude Parent's essential contribution and unique place in post WWII architecture, and many leading architects such as Jean Nouvel, Frank Gehry, Thom Mayne, Zaha Hadid recognize him as both a precursor and an influence. In 2010, a retrospective exhibition at the Cité de l’Architecture et du Patrimoine was dedicated to this major figure in the history of 20th-century architecture.

Life and career He was born in Häsleby parish in Jönköping County, to the pastor Nicolaus Petri and his wife, Botilda Olofsdotter, but adopted the surname Verelius in his youth.C. Annerstedt, \\"Verēlius, Olof\\", Nordisk familjebok, 1926, cols. 1216-17, col. 1216, online at Project Runeberg He studied at Dorpat (now Tartu, Estonia) in 1633 and Uppsala in 1638, was given a position as tutor to youths of noble birth by Axel Oxenstierna, and in 1648-50 took a tour abroad on which he made a speech in Leiden about the Peace of Westphalia and in Paris on the occasion of the coronation of Queen Christina. Verelius was named to a professorship of Rhetoric at Dorpat in 1652 but never took it up; instead, in 1653 he became steward of the academy at Uppsala, a position which he held until 1657, when he took a teaching position in history. In 1662 he took up the chair in Swedish antiquities at Uppsala University which had been created especially for him. In 1666 he also became national archivist, and assessor in the newly founded College of Antiquaries ().Suomalainen Tiedeakatemia, Annales 1992, p. 28. In 1675 and 1679 respectively, he resigned those positions. In 1679, while retaining his professorship, he became university librarian. He died in Uppsala on 3 January 1682. Works The Icelandic student Jón Rúgman Jónsson, who had been intending to study in Copenhagen but ended up in Sweden, had brought a number of saga texts to Uppsala; he had copied them as leisure reading.Henrik Williams, \\"Förnyad filologi: Filologins rötter\\", in Omodernt: Människor och tankar i förmodern tid, ed. Mohammad Fazlhashemi and Eva Österberg, Lund: Nordic Academic Press, 2009, , pp. 276-92, p. 278 With his uncredited assistance in translation,Annales, p. 30. in 1664 Verelius published the first edition of an Icelandic saga, together with a Swedish translation: Gautreks saga, under the title Gothrici & Rolfi Westrogothiæ regum historia lingua antiqua Gothica conscripta.Andrew Wawn, The Vikings and the Victorians: Inventing the Old North in Nineteenth-Century Britain, Cambridge: Brewer, 2000, , p. 18.Annerstedt, col. 1217, online. This was followed by Herrauds och Bosa saga (Bósa saga ok Herrauðs) in 1666 and Hervarar saga (Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks) in 1672. Verelius also wrote the first Old Norse dictionary by a non-Icelander, Index linguæ veteris scytho- scandicæ sive gothicæ, begun in 1681 and published after his death by Olaus Rudbeck in 1691.Henrik Schück and Karl Warburg, Illustrerad Svensk Litteraturhistoria volume 1 Sveriges litteratur till frihetstidens början, Stockholm: Geber, 1896, , p. 267 He was probably best known abroad for this and the Hervarar saga.Frank Edgar Farley, Scandinavian Influences in the English Romantic Movement, [Harvard] studies and notes in philology and literature 9, Boston: Ginn, 1903, , p. 5. In 1675, he published a handbook of Swedish runic inscriptions, in Latin and Swedish, Manuductio ad runographiam.The Nordic Languages: An International Handbook of the History of the North Germanic Languages, ed. Oskar Bandle et al, Handbücher zur Sprach- und Kommunikationswissenschaft 22, volume 1 Berlin: de Gruyter, 2002, , p. 359. This continued Johannes Bureus' research into the runes and was a significant work, although limited by, for example, the assumption that the runes could be derived from the Greek alphabet. On his return from his foreign tour, Verelius had written Epitomarum Historiæ Svio-Gothicæ libri quattuor et Gothorum extra patrium gestarum libri duo, a highly patriotic view of ancient Swedish history. This was published in 1730 and became popular as a reader because of its good Latin. Views and controversies Verelius is counted the founder of the Hyperborean School in Swedish scholarship, which took the view that the Goths of Gotland were the people referred to as Hyperboreans in Greek literature; this gave rise to Gothicism and Verelius' student Rudbeck became its most prominent proponent.The Nordic Languages, p. 358.Adolph Burnett Benson, The Old Norse Element in Swedish Romanticism, Columbia University Germanic Studies, New York: Columbia University, 1914, , p. 21: \\"and it was from [Verelius] that Rudbeck received the impetus for his work.\\" From 1672 to 1681 he and Johannes Schefferus disputed bitterly over the site of the heathen temple at Uppsala.Patrik Hall, The Social Construction of Nationalism: Sweden as an Example, Lund political studies 106, Lund: Lund University Press, 1998, , p. 161. Schefferus argued in Upsalia, published in 1666, that the temple had been located in the centre of the modern town.David King, Finding Atlantis: A True Story of Genius, Madness and an Extraordinary Quest, New York: Harmony, 2005, , p. 177. Verelius disputed this in his notes to Hervarar saga, arguing that the temple had been on the site of the church at Gamla Uppsala. In 1678, Verelius published excerpts from Bishop Karl's Chronicle in support of his view, but the document was a forgery, although Verelius and Rudbeck may not have known this.Olof Sundqvist, Freyr's Offspring: Rulers and Religion in Ancient Svea Society, Acta Universitatis Upsaliensis, Historia religionum 21, Uppsala: Universitet, 2002, , pp. 299-300.King, pp. 182, 185. In any event Verelius' view, although based less on sober scholarship than Schefferus'--he considered the tower of the church at Gamla Uppsala to predate Christianity and be identical with the heathen temple--Henrik Janson, \\"Äkta förfalskning åter bevismaterial. Annotationes ex scriptis Karoli\\", Scandia 2008, pp. 41-60, p. 42, pdf p. 2 has proven correct.

Pipe Gate was a railway station on the North Staffordshire Railway's Stoke to Market Drayton Line. Construction Construction was started on the Newcastle- under-Lyme to Silverdale Junction line on 29 July 1864, and the first train ran on 1 February 1870. The station served the hamlet of Pipe Gate, which is part of the parish of Woore, Shropshire. It was hence named Pipe Gate (for Woore). Trains from the station ran from , to junction with the Great Western Railway at Market Drayton. On grouping in 1923 it was absorbed into the London Midland and Scottish Railway. Passenger services The early years of the 20th century were the busiest, there being thirteen trains daily from Stoke to Silverdale and five to Market Drayton. Railmotor services began in 1905, intended to compete with trams and were somewhat successful in this respect, although they only lasted until 1926. The station also serviced Woore Racecourse which opened at Pipe Gate in 1885. The section between Silverdale and Pipe Gate was reduced to single track in October 1934. Dwindling passenger numbers after World War II meant that there were only two trains daily from Stoke to Market Drayton, and all passenger services ceased on 7 May 1956. Freight traffic Express Dairies had a creamery with private siding access to the station, allowing its preferred transport partner the GWR to provide milk trains to the facility, for onward scheduling to London. In 1962 a new \\"chord\\" line was opened at Madeley to provide a connection to the West Coast Main Line. This was used as a diversionary route when the Harecastle diversion line was being constructed and continued in use for freight workings once the latter was completed. After the closure of the creamery, the route between Market Drayton and Madeley Chord closed under the Beeching Axe in 1966. Today A large amount of rail still exists to the eastern edge of the former and now demolished station, running back towards Silverdale.

A professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1936 to 1973, he was a recipient of the National Medal of Science and a member of the National Academy of Engineering. John Trump was noted for developing rotational radiation therapy. Together with Robert J. Van de Graaff, he developed one of the first million-volt X-ray generators. He was the paternal uncle of President Donald Trump. Early life John was the youngest of three children and the second son of German immigrants Frederick Trump and Elizabeth Christ Trump. He was born in New York City on August 21, 1907. John's brother, Fred, joined their mother in real estate development and management while still in his teens (Elizabeth Trump & Son). Initially, John and his brother tried working together building houses, but ultimately they dissolved their partnership, and John pursued a career in electrical engineering. Trump received his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from the New York University Tandon School of Engineering (then Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn) in 1929, his master's degree in physics from Columbia University, and his doctorate of electrical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1933. He was a professor at MIT from 1936 until 1973. War service During World War II, Trump switched from work on hospital X-ray machines to research into similar technologies, especially the development of radar. During 1940, he joined the newly formed National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), as technical aide to Karl Compton, President of MIT and the Chairman of the Radar Division. During 1942, Trump became Secretary of the Microwave Committee, a sub-committee of the NDRC. The director of the Microwave Committee was Alfred Lee Loomis, the millionaire physicist, who decided to create a laboratory. He selected a site for it, chose a suitably discreet and ambiguous name for it and funded the construction, until the Federal administration was established. The new institution was the MIT Radiation Laboratory, or the \\"Rad Lab\\". The British were also researching radar, which they termed Radio Direction Finder (RDF), and had started much earlier. Their Tizard Mission to the US showed how much more sophisticated they were with some of the technologies, particularly the magnetron. The US decided to send a team to Britain to help coordinate the efforts of the two Allies. The unit was known as the \\"British Branch of the Radiation Laboratory\\" (BBRL) and operated as a department of Britain's Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) at Malvern, in Worcestershire. In early 1943, two days after the death of Nikola Tesla, the Federal Bureau of Investigation ordered the Alien Property Custodian to seize Tesla's belongings. Trump was called in to analyze the Tesla items, which were being held in custody. After a three-day investigation, Trump's report concluded that there was nothing which would constitute a hazard in unfriendly hands. From February 1944 to the end of the war in Europe, Trump was the Director of the BBRL. During this time, Trump also served in the Advisory Specialist Group on Radar, advising USAAF General Carl Spaatz on navigational radar, precision- bombing radar, and also defenses against the German radars found in their night-fighters and in their flak units. The systems included: Gee, Oboe, LORAN, H2X, MEW & SCR-584. Trump worked with all the most important British radar experts, including Sir Robert Watson-Watt, A.P. Rowe and Bernard Lovell. At the end of the war, Trump also had interviews with Germany's main radar technicians. Trump received recognition for his war related work partnership from both the United States and the United Kingdom. Family John G. Trump is a member of the Trump family. He married Elora Sauerbrun (1913–1983), and they had three children: the late John Gordon Trump (1938–2012) of Watertown, Massachusetts; Christine Philp of New London, New Hampshire; and Karen Ingraham of Los Alamos, New Mexico; and six grandchildren. Trump's nephew, Donald Trump, has been President of the United States since 2017. Later life During 1946 Trump, Robert J. Van de Graaff, and Denis M. Robinson initiated the High Voltage Engineering Corporation (HVEC) to produce Van de Graaff generators. He returned to MIT to teach and direct research for three decades after the war. He directed the MIT High Voltage Research Laboratory from 1946 to 1980. Some of his research at MIT concentrated on treating wastewater. He researched using an electron beam from a high voltage accelerator as the deactivating agent in the treatment of municipal wastewater sludge. The High Voltage Research Laboratory developed a prototype system that was tested at one of Boston's wastewater treatment plants and it was able to provide bacterial and viral disinfection via continuous on-line treatment. Trump died in Boston on February 21, 1985. The National Academy of Engineering described Trump as \\"a pioneer in the scientific, engineering and medical applications of high voltage machinery\\". James Melcher, Trump's lab director, is quoted as saying: \\"John, over a period of three decades, would be approached by people of all sorts because he could make megavolt beams of ions and electrons – death rays... What did he do with it? Cancer research, sterilizing sludge out in Deer Island [a waste disposal facility], all sorts of wondrous things. He didn't touch the weapons stuff.\\"Science for the People, January/February 1988, p25, Retrieved 2016-11-4.

Two additional years were added to his sentence in 2004 when he protested in jail. Several international human rights groups have protested or campaigned on his behalf, and Amnesty International designated him a prisoner of conscience.  Background and early activism  Jigme Gyatso is from Kersul in Amdo, in Gansu province, Tibet. In 1985, he travelled to India to receive religious initiation, then returned to Tibet to join a monastery the following year. He then became involved in the Tibetan independence movement, acting as the leader of the secret youth organization \\"Tibetan Independence Organisation\\" in 1991. In 1992, he helped to organize a pro-independence rally in Lhasa, at which many participants were arrested by the Chinese public security bureau (PSB). Following the rally, PSB officials put Jigme Gyatso under surveillance.  Arrest and imprisonment  On 30 March 1996 around 6pm, Jigme Gyatso was arrested at a restaurant in Lhasa owned by a fellow member of the Tibetan Independence Organization who was also arrested with him. Jigme Gyatso was then detained on charges related to the 1992 Lhasa protest: incitement and endangering national security by establishing an illegal organization. At his trial, authorities described him as a \\"counter-revolutionary ringleader\\". On 25 November 1996, the Lhasa Municipal Intermediate People’s Court sentenced him to 15 years' imprisonment and 5 years' deprivation of his political rights. Jigme Gyatso was then held for one year and one month in Gutsa PSB Detention Centre. He later stated that he was tortured during this time by prison authorities. During the first six months, he allegedly faced lengthy interrogation sessions, was forced to wear manacles on his wrists and ankles, and was beaten with batons. Amnesty International reported that in 1997, he was \\"beaten so badly that he could barely walk afterwards\\". \\"I heard that they took him out of the prison to a different place to torture and interrogate him very severely. The secret service policemen got drunk and put the beer bottles between the handcuffs and his back to hurt him even more.\\" said his best friend who lives in exile.http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/453183/20130403/tibetan-monk-jigme- gyatso-tsultrim-china.htm He was transferred to Drapchi Prison in April 1997. In May of the following year, he joined other inmates in protesting inside prison when Chinese prison officials tried to force Tibetan political prisoners to salute the Chinese national flag and sing the Chinese national hymn. Nine inmates were killed by prison authorities in retaliation, and Jigme Gyatso was again beaten. In May 2004, Jigme Gyatso again shouted \\"Long live the Dalai Lama!\\", resulting in a beating with electric batons. He was charged with \\"inciting separatism\\" and given an additional two years to his sentence, pushing his scheduled release back to March 2013. He was later transferred again, this time to Chushul Prison on the outskirts of Lhasa. In January 2011, Amnesty International reported that Jigme Gyatso was believed to be seriously ill as a result of prison mistreatment, and issued an alert on his behalf. The World Organization Against Torture reported that he had become \\"very frail\\", suffered from kidney dysfunction, and could \\"only walk with his back bent\\". = International reaction = The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention reviewed Jigme Gyatso's case in 1999, and issued a ruling that his detention was \\"arbitrary\\" and unlawful. Amnesty International has campaigned repeatedly for Jigme Gyatso's release, and designated him a \\"prisoner of conscience\\", \\"detained solely for peacefully exercising his rights to freedom of expression, association and assembly\\". The Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy has issued warnings over his health and called for his release on compassionate grounds. In 2009, the World Organization Against Torture called for a letter-writing campaign on Jigme Gyatso's behalf in light of the evidence that he had been mistreated by prison authorities. The International Campaign for Tibet has also circulated petitions calling for \\"the release of Jigme Gyatso, so that he may seek medical attention and be freed from unjust political persecution\\". On 27 November 2005, UN Special Rapporteur on Torture Manfred Nowak visited Jigme Gyatso in prison; in his official report, Nowak recommended that the prisoner be released. Jigme Gyatso was reportedly subject to beatings and solitary confinement as a result of the meeting. Jigme Gyatso, after his release from prison, on 1 April 2013 in his hometown = Release = Jigme Gyatso was released from Chusul prison on 30 March 2013. He was ordered to return to his Sangchu home and arrived under police escort on 1 April 2013. His friend Jamyang Tsultrim related that \\"Those who saw him reported that he was very weak. He was limping and reported having heart problems and high blood pressure. His vision was also weak.\\" Further he said that \\"People might think he is free now.

She made five whaling voyages to the seas around New South Wales and New Zealand. The government chartered her in 1803 to transport stores and cattle, to Risdon Cove on the River Derwent, Tasmania. Voyages On her first voyage, Albion, Eber Bunker, master, left Britain on 20 February 1799, bound for New South Wales. There is some ambiguity about whether she was carrying convicts or not. Albion arrived in Port Jackson (Sydney), on 29 June 1799, with a cargo of salted pork after a voyage of 3 months and 15 days. Albion left Port Jackson in September bound for the whale fisheries around New South Wales (NSW) and New Zealand (NZ). She then took 600 barrels of sperm oil off New South Wales and New Zealand between September 1799 and August 1800. At some point Albion sailed to Tahiti at the request of Governor Philip Gidley King. When she returned to Port Jackson she reported having seen \\"immense numbers of whales\\". Albion returned to Britain on 26 March 1802 with a cargo of 155 barrels of whale oil. Shortly before she arrived she reportedly rescued a ship on 19 March at , i.e., north of the Azores.British Southern Whale Fishery Database – Voyages: Albion. In July 1802 Albion again sailed for Port Jackson. The next month the Honourable the Court of Directors of the East India Company announced that they had licensed 19 vessels, Albion, Charming Kitty, and among them, to sail east of the Cape of Good Hope to engage in whaling in the \\"Southern Whale Fishery\\".Naval Chronicle (Jul-Dec 1802), Vol. 8, p.254. Albion was at Boa Vista, Cape Verde, on 5 October. In January 1803 she was \\"all well\\" at the Bay of Islands, New Zealand. Returning to Port Jackson on 6 July 1803, Albion, Captain Eber Bunker, went on a second whaling expedition along the Australian coast. Bunker discovered the Bunker Islands off the Queensland coast. Next, the colonial government chartered Albion to carry convicts,Australian Dictionary of Biography - Bowen, John (1780-1827) stores and cattle, and also the leader of the settlement party, 23-year-old Lieutenant John Bowen, as part of the establishment of the first European settlement at Risdon Cove, Tasmania.

Between them the two ships carried 49 passengers for the new settlement: 21 male convicts, three female convicts, members of the New South Wales Corps, and free settlers and their families.) Albion, although chartered, had been given permission to take whales along the way.Dictionary of Sydney - Sydney's whaling fleet In December 1803 she was at New Zealand.
