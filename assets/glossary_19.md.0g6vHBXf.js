He is now known for his work of criticism Discours de la po√©sie chr√©tienne from 1633. Antoine Godeau. Biography His verse-writing early won the interest of a relative in Paris, Valentin Conrart, at whose house the literary world gathered. The outcome of these meetings was the foundation of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise, of which Godeau was one of the first members and the third whose lot it fell to deliver the weekly address to that body. He was induced to settle in Paris, where he soon became a favorite at the H√¥tel de Rambouillet,His association with the Guirlande de Julie earned him the nickname of the nain de Julie, the dwarf of Julie d'Angennes, future duchesse de Montausier. rivalling the famous writers of his period. At that time, to say of any work c'est de Godeau was to stamp it with the seal of approval. Perhaps best known among the works of his early days is his Discours sur les ≈ìuvres de Malherbe (1629), which shows some critical power and is valuable for the history of the French prose of the seventeenth century. In 1636, he was named Bishop of Grasse by Richelieu, to whom he had dedicated his first religious composition, a poetical paraphrase of the Psalm Benedicite omnia opera Domini. He proved a model prelate. By a Bull of Pope Innocent X he was empowered to unite the Dioceses of Grasse and Vence under his administration, but seeing the dissatisfaction of the clergy of the latter diocese, he relinquished the former and established himself at Vence. Godeau by no means gave up other interests. In 1645 and 1655 he took a prominent part in the General Assembly of the French Clergy, and under the regency of Anne of Austria was deputy from the Estates of Provence. He was stricken with apoplexy and died in his episcopal city at the age of sixty-seven. Works He turned his talent for versification to religious uses, his best known productions being a metrical version of the Psalms, poems on St. Paul, the assumption, St. Eustace, Mary Magdalen, and one of 15,000 lines on the annals of the Church. The monotony and mechanical arrangement of the poems are relieved at intervals by passages remarkable for thought or expression, among others those lines embodied by Corneille in his Polyeucte: > Leur glore tombe par terre, Et comme elle a l'√©clat du verre, Elle en a la > fragilit√©. The Jesuit poet Fran√ßois Vavasseur (1605-1681) published, in 1647, a satire on Godeau, Antonius Godellus, episcopus Grassensis, the verdict of which was echoed by Boileau in a letter to Maucroix. His Eloges des evesques, qui dans tous les si√®cles de l'Eglise ont fleury en doctrine et en saintet√© (Paris, 1665) was republished in 1802 by M. Sauffret. His Histoire de l'Eglise (Paris, 1633) was translated into Italian by Sperone Speroni and into German by Hyper and Groote (Augsburg, 1768‚Äì96), and is still cited. Of this work Johann Baptist Alzog says that \\"although written in an attractive and popular style, it is lacking in solid worth and original research\\" (Manual of Universal History, I, Dublin, 1900, 33). It is related that during the publication of this work the author chanced one day in a library to engage in conversation with the Oratorian, P√®re Le Cointe, who, ignorant of Godeau's identity, indicated some grave defects in the volumes which had already appeared, criticisms of which the author availed himself in correcting the work for a new edition. The same P√®re Le Cointe, later a staunch friend of Godeau's, while conceding to the complete work many excellencies, calls attention to its frequent inaccuracies and lack of critical balance. Minor writings of Godeau's include L'Id√©e du bon magistrat en la vie et en la mort de Mr de Cordes, conseiller au Chastelet de Paris (1645) and Eloges historiques des empereurs, des roys, des princes..... qui dans tous les Si√®cles ont excell√© en pi√©t√© (1667). Among Godeau's works of a religious character are: Pri√®res, m√©ditations (Paris, 1643); Avis √† Messieurs de Paris pour le culte du Saint Sacrement dans les Paroisses, & de la fa√ßon de le porter aux malades (1644); Ordonnances et Instructions synodales (1644); Vie de Saint Paul Ap√¥tre (1647); La vie de saint Augustin (1652); La pan√©gyrique de saint Augustin (1653); La vie de saint Charles Borrom√©e (1657); Eloge de Saint Fran√ßois de Sales (1663). His chief title to fame, however, rests on his work in Holy Scripture. His paraphrases of the following books: Romans (Paris, 1635); Corinthians, Galatians, and Ephesians (1632); Thessalonians, Timothy, Titus, and Philemon (1641); Hebrews (1637); the Canonical Epistles (1640), are still recommended and useful, the sense and connexion of ideas being brought out clearly by the insertion of the fewest possible words (Simon in Hist. Critique des principaux commentateurs du N.T., c. lvii). His Version expliqu√©e du Nouveau Testament de Nostre Seigneur J√©sus-Christ (1668) is something between a literal translation and a paraphrase. The greatest of all his works, according to Nic√©ron, is La morale chr√©tienne pour l'instruction des Curez et des Pr√™tres du dioc√®se de Vence (Paris, 1709), intended to combat the Casuists, a model of force, clearness, and revealing a precision rarely to be found in the other writings of the same author. In the Latin translation, which appeared at Augsburg in 1774 under the title Theologia moralis ex purissimis s. Scriptur√¶, patrum ac conciliorum fontibus derivata, notis theologicis illustrata, the arrangement of the matter is greatly improved.

It serves as the main interchange between the Hucknall and Phoenix Park branches of the initial system - however, NET recommends that people alight at the previous stop rather than change at Highbury Vale, due to the lines splitting at Babbington junction, just before the trams reach the stop. This essentially makes Highbury Vale two separate stops connected by a walkway. Viewed for appropriate area with unitary authority ward boundaries and names selected. The two separate parts of the tram stop each comprise an island platform flanked by twin tracks. The platform for the Hucknall branch is alongside and parallel to the Robin Hood railway line that links Nottingham and Worksop. The tram and railway tracks are separated by a fence, and there is no stop on the railway line. The platform on the Phoenix Park branch is some away, and at an angle to the Hucknall platform. Between the two platforms is a small open space, and on the connecting footpath is a display indicating which platform to go to for the next city tram. Immediately to the west of the platform on the Phoenix Park, the twin tracks merge into the single track branch. With the opening of NET's phase two, Highbury Vale is now the more northerly of the two junctions on the NET, where line 1, from Hucknall, meets line 2, from Phoenix Park. South of Highbury Vale the two lines run together through the city centre to a junction just south of Nottingham railway station. Here the two lines split again, with line 1 continuing to Beeston and Chilwell, and line 2 to Wilford and Clifton. Trams on each line run at frequencies that vary between 4 and 8 trams per hour, depending on the day and time of day, combining to provide up to 16 trams per hour on the common section.

The earliest of these primordial trumpets were adapted from animal horns and sea shells, and were common throughout Europe, Africa, India and, to a lesser extent, the Middle East. Primitive trumpets eventually found their way to most parts of the globe, though even today indigenous varieties are quite rare in the Americas, the Far East and South-East Asia. Some species of primitive trumpets can still be found in remote places, where they have remained largely untouched by the passage of time. For the most part, these primitive instruments were \\"natural trumpets\\": that is to say, they had none of those devices (fingerholes, keys, slides or valves) by which the pitch of an instrument might be altered. It is in fact quite exceptional to come across a chromatic trumpet ‚Äì primitive or otherwise ‚Äì which is not derived from the chromatic trumpet of Western tradition; the bƒÅs of Madhya Pradesh in India, which has fingerholes bored into the side of its tube, is one such exception. Primitive trumpets The simplest ‚Äì and presumably the earliest ‚Äì type of trumpet was made from the hollowed-out horn or shell of an animal, into the end of which a hole was bored for the mouth. This \\"trumpet\\" had neither a mouthpiece nor a bell, and was not so much a musical instrument as a megaphone into which one spoke, sang, or shouted. The intention was to distort the voice and produce a harsh, unnatural sound to ward off evil spirits or disconcert one's enemies. Only later was the trumpet used to invoke friendly gods or to encourage one's own warriors on the battlefield. Typically only one or two different pitches could be produced on such an instrument, though sometimes a small fingerhole was bored in the tip to provide the player with an extra pitch. Most of these early trumpets were end-blown, like the modern trumpet; side-blown varieties, however, were not unknown, and can still be found in Africa and other parts of the globe. As they were played only by men, they probably acquired strong phallic overtones; among certain aboriginal tribes, for example, it was a capital offense for a woman to look at a trumpet. The tradition of playing trumpet or bugle fanfares at sunrise (Reveille), sunset (Last Post), and at funerals (Taps), probably evolved from these ancient rituals. The use of the trumpet as an instrument of warfare and the chase is probably as old. Its strident sound and animal origins must have suggested a wild or belligerent nature at a very early date, while the ritualistic uses to which it was put only served to strengthen its associations with death and male-oriented activities. Animal-horn trumpets Animal-horn trumpets are still employed today, especially in Africa, though they are also found in Israel, Asia and Oceania. With the exception of African varieties, most are end-blown instruments from which the tip has been removed to provide a mouthhole. In the majority of cases the player's lips are applied directly to the mouthhole; sometimes, however, the instrument has a detachable mouthpiece. Cattle, sheep, goats and antelopes are among the animals whose horns are ‚Äì or have been ‚Äì most frequently used to make such trumpets. The following examples may be briefly noted: *The Sumerian si was the ordinary word for animal horn. Literary references show that as an instrument it was played in the streets by the herald who delivered public announcements. *The Jewish shofar is perhaps the best-known animal-horn trumpet. It is usually made from a ram's horn, though the horn of any kosher animal other than a cow or calf may be used. The shofar, which is still employed in Jewish religious ceremonies today, is an ancient instrument; it is mentioned frequently in the Bible and rabbinic literature. It can generally produce only two pitches; theoretically, these should be a fifth apart (being the second and third partials of the instrument's harmonic series); the irregular bore of the instrument, however, can reduce this to as little as a fourth or increase it to as much as a sixth. These acoustical details apply to most animal-horn trumpets. Shringa- an Indian trumpet *The Indian shringa, or ·π£·πõnga, (Sanskrit for \\"horn\\") was originally made from the horn of the buffalo, though the term was later applied to almost any kind of horn or trumpet, irrespective of its origin. In the south of the country the general name of the instrument is kombu, a Dravidian term which also means \\"horn\\". The shringa is an end-blown instrument, though one particular variety ‚Äì the singha of Orissa ‚Äì is side- blown. The shringa and its close relations are known by various names in different parts of India: singe (the shringa of the Bhils), sakna (a buffalo horn of the Santals), reli'ki (the Angami's buffalo horn, which has a bamboo mouthpiece), visan (a buffalo horn of Uttar Pradesh), singi (a deer horn of Uttar Pradesh), and kohuk (a horn of the Marias of Madhya Pradesh). India's national epic, the MahƒÅbhƒÅrata, mentions the govishanika, which is thought to have been a cow's horn. Many species of shringa can still be found in India today. *The Greek keras (\\"horn\\") and the Etrusco-Roman cornu (Latin for \\"horn\\") were originally simple animal-horn trumpets, though both were superseded by more advanced instruments to which they lent their names. *The Germanic cowhorn, or Stierhorn, which was generally made from the horn of an aurochs or buffalo. *The rwa-dun is a Tibetan ram's-horn trumpet similar to the Jewish shofar. It has been used for centuries in Buddhist ceremonies for the purposes of exorcism. *The Latvian ƒÅ≈ærag was made from a goat's horn, and was blown by young men in the summertime to announce their intention to take a wife. *The engombe is a side-blown trumpet found in Uganda; it is usually made from a cow's horn and is blown by Bugandan huntsmen to ensure a successful hunt. Conch-shell trumpets Conch shells have also been used as primitive instruments since Neolithic times, and must be numbered among the antecedents of the natural trumpet. The four shells most commonly used for this purpose are the triton or trumpet shell, the cassis or helmet shell, the fusus, and the strombus or true conch, though the term \\"conch-shell trumpet\\" is generally applied to all instruments of this type. The spiral interior of the shell acts as tubing, and a mouthhole is created either by breaking off the point of the shell (end-blown conch) or by boring a small hole in the body (side-blown conch). The cassis is an end-blown shell; the other three types are usually side-blown. Conch-shell trumpets are found in almost every part of the globe, including inland areas like Tibet, Central Europe and the Andes. They are especially common throughout Oceania, where the conch-shell trumpet was once used on religious, ceremonial and military occasions. Today, however, the instrument is more often associated with mundane events like football matches; the Tongan football team is regularly encouraged by ensembles of up to nine kele'a. In the South Pacific island nation of Vanuatu, local fishermen use conch-shell trumpets known as tap√°e to call for assistance when they are drawing in their nets. In Fiji, the davui conch-shell trumpet is still blown to invoke the gods. End-blown conch-shell trumpets are still used as sacred ritual instruments in Asia. The Indian ≈õa≈Ñkh or ≈õa≈Ñkham is blown by Brahmins in Hindu temples throughout India and South Asia, and is also used today as an instrument of folk music and dance; formerly it was employed as a heraldic instrument to declare war or celebrate victory. According to Hindu mythology the ≈õankh will be blown by Siva at the end of the current World Age as a sort of Last Trump. The conch shell is also used as a signal in Buddhist ceremonies in the Far East. In Tibet it is known as the dun-dkar, or dung-dkar; in China it is the faluo or hai lo, and in Japan the horagai or hora. Early manufactured trumpets Brudev√¶lte Lurs, Denmark. The earliest artificial trumpets appeared before the end of the Neolithic, and were adapted from the natural models provided by animal-horns and conch-shells. They were ‚Äì and in some parts of the world are still ‚Äì made from a variety of perishable and non- perishable materials, including bark, wood, gourds, bamboo, horn, bone, ivory, clay and, of course, metal. Early metallic trumpets were either hammered from sheets of a suitable metal (e.g. silver) or cast in bronze by the lost-wax method. Among these primitive trumpets the following may be noted: *The ancient Nordic lur was made of bronze and dates back to the Late Bronze Age (1000‚Äì500 BCE). This extraordinary instrument consisted of an elaborate S-shaped conical tube, usually about in length, with a slightly flared bell. It was an end-blown natural trumpet, and sounded rather like a modern trombone. To date, fifty-six lurs have been found: forty-five in Denmark, eleven in Sweden, four in Norway, five in northern Germany, and one in Latvia. They have often been discovered in matching pairs, which suggests that they were used for ceremonial or religious purposes, rather than as instruments of war. The original name of the instrument is unknown. *The Celtic carnyx was also made of bronze, and was used as an instrument of war during the Iron Age ( 300 BCE ‚Äì 200 CE). It consisted of a cylindrical tube about long; the bell was elaborately carved to resemble a wild boar's head, with a movable tongue and jaw; the mouthpiece was curved. The carnyx was held vertically with the bell above the player's head. The instrument is most often associated with the Celts, but is now known to have been used also by the inhabitants of ancient Dacia. A similar S-shaped trumpet from the Iron Age has been found at Loughnashade in Ireland. Named the trumpa cr√©da (archaic Irish for \\"bronze trumpet\\"), it consists of two curved tubes of bronze, each comprising a quarter circle, one of which is of conical bore and one of cylindrical bore, with a joint in the middle. The Loughnashade trumpet is generally displayed with the two halves joined together to make a semicircle, but it is now thought to have been played with the two parts bending in opposite directions to make an S-shaped trumpet not unlike the carnyx, to which it may have been related. *In India the primitive shringa or kombu was adapted to make a great variety of metallic trumpets. The modern kombu is generally a C-shaped instrument made of brass or copper, with a conical bore and a detachable mouthpiece. It is still played at weddings and funerals, and during religious processions. There are two sizes of kombu: the small timiri kombu and the large bari kombu. Another type of brass kombu ‚Äì known variously as turi, bƒÅnkiƒÅ, bargu, banke, ransingha, narsingha, narsƒ©gƒÅ and nagphani in different parts of the subcontinent ‚Äì is S-shaped and looks remarkably like the trumpa cr√©da of Ireland. Indigenous straight trumpets have been made in India since the Neolithic and are still found today in various guises and under various names: turahi, turya, tutari, tuttoori, bhongal, kahal, kahala, and bhenr. The booraga of Sanskrit literature was possibly also a straight trumpet made of brass or copper. *The wooden lur of medieval Scandinavia (not to be confused with the much earlier bronze instrument to which it has lent its name) is referred to in the Icelandic sagas as an instrument of war, used to marshal troops and frighten the enemy. It is also mentioned by Saxo Grammaticus in his Gesta Danorum. This particular species of lur was a straight, end-blown natural trumpet, with a cylindrical tube about long. It was made of wood ‚Äì typically by cutting a thick branch in half lengthwise and hollowing it out, and then rejoining the two-halves, which are secured with tar and willow osiers. A similar instrument, but secured with birch, known as the birch trumpet, has been used in Nordic countries since the Middle Ages as a signalling instrument and to call cattle. *The Lithuanian daudytƒó is a natural wooden trumpet similar to the wooden lur of Scandinavia; its sections are held together with putty and linen yarn. *The alphorn, or alpenhorn, is a distinctive natural wooden horn with a conical bore, upturned bell and cup- shaped mouthpiece. It has been used as a signalling instrument in the Alpine regions of Europe for about two millennia. The alphorn is generally carved from the solid softwood of the spruce or pine. In former times alphorn makers would use a tree that was already bent at the base, but today's alphorns are pieced together from separate sections, which are secured with bark or gut. The cup-shaped mouthpiece is usually carved out of a block of hardwood. *The Australian didjeridu is one of the best known species of primitive trumpet. A natural wooden trumpet, it has been in continuous use among the aboriginal peoples of Australia for at least 1,500 years, and possibly much longer. It is usually manufactured from the trunk of a hardwood tree, such as the eucalyptus, which has been suitably hollowed out by termites. The instrument is typically about long; the bore may be conical or cylindrical. By vibrating his lips against the mouthhole the player can produce a deep drone; the note so produced may be sustained indefinitely by means of a technique called circular breathing. Today the didjeridu is frequently played as a solo instrument for recreational purposes, though it was traditionally used to accompany dancing and singing on ceremonial occasions. *The Ugandan arupepe is a natural wooden trumpet covered with animal hide. *The molimo is a wooden trumpet used by the Mbuti people of the Congo to awaken the spirit of the Ituri Rainforest. It is also the name of the elaborate ritual in which the instrument plays a vital role. *Bone trumpets made from human femurs (khang ling) and tiger femurs (stag ling) can still be found in the Himalayas, where they are associated with Buddhist tantra. In Tibet the human thigh-bone trumpet is called the rkan-dun (or rkang-gling) and plays an important role in the traditional shamanistic religion known as B√∂n. In the Tibetan language the word dun means both \\"trumpet\\" and \\"bone\\"! Brass replicas of bone trumpets are also known in Tibet. *The borija, a short natural trumpet found in Yugoslavia, is made from the spiral shavings of the willow or ash, bound firmly into a conical tube about long. *The obsolete tƒÅ≈°u taure of Latvia was of similar design to the borija, but it was made from birch bark and could be up to long. *In the Amazon Rainforest giant trumpets up to in length are made from tightly coiled bark; sticks are attached to one or both sides of the instruments to support them and prevent sagging. *Bamboo trumpets can be found in many parts of Africa and South America, but are almost unheard of in the bamboo-rich regions of China and South-East Asia. A notable exception is provided by the bamboo \\"brass-band\\" tradition of Sulawesi, which is actually quite a recent tradition. In the 19th century Dutch missionaries introduced European brass bands to the island; later, in the 1920s, local craftsmen began to make bamboo replicas of these modern instruments. Today most replicas are made of zinc, though bamboo examples can still be found in isolated pockets, such as the Sangir Archipelago, which lies to the north of Sulawesi. *Gourds, the hollow, dried shells of the fruit of a member of the family Cucurbitaceae, can be adapted quite easily to make natural trumpets. Gourd trumpets have been used in Africa for centuries, and are also to be found in Asia and the Americas; one particular variety of gourd, the calabash, is even known as the \\"trumpet gourd\\". The gourd trumpet was also used by the Aztecs and other indigenous peoples of Central America. One notable variety, the Mayan Hom-Tah, has been compared to the Australian didjeridu. Among the gourd trumpets that are still in use today is the waza of the Berta people, who live in the Blue Nile region of the Sudan. A 14th-century olifant. *Most trumpets fashioned from the ivory tusks of an elephant are of African origin; both end-blown and side-blown varieties can still be found in some parts of the continent today. The most notable exception is the medieval olifant, a short, thick, end-blown trumpet carved from ivory, which was apparently introduced to Europe by the Saracens at the time of the Crusades; a Middle Eastern instrument, the olifant was possibly adapted by the Arabs from African models, which have a long history. *Clay trumpets can be found in South America, India, Western Europe and parts of Africa. South American varieties include imitations of conch-shell trumpets, such as the potuto of Peru. The Horniman Museum in London has a red- and-white-marbled clay Portuguese trumpet which was obviously copied from a brass instrument. Coiled clay trumpets probably derive from animal-horn or conch-shell models. Peru had long straight clay trumpets called pungacuqua or puuaqua which were up to long and were blown in pairs, as was the botuto from the Orinoco basin. Clay trumpets have also been found in Mayan cities in Central America. Ancient Egypt Silver and gold plated trumpet and its wooden mute from the tomb of Tutankhamun (1326-1336 BC) The natural trumpet was probably first used as a military instrument in ancient Egypt. The trumpets depicted by the artists of the Eighteenth Dynasty were short straight instruments made of wood, bronze, copper or silver. The Ancient Egyptian name for this particular instrument was sheneb (≈°nb). According to the Classical writers, the Egyptian trumpet sounded like the braying of an ass. For the most part the trumpeters depicted in Egyptian art are engaged in military activities ‚Äì the sheneb was probably used on the battlefield both to encourage (and possibly also to direct) the Pharaoh's troops and to intimidate the enemy. In some murals from the Eighteenth Dynasty, the sheneb appears to be accompanying dancers; if this is the case, it is possibly the earliest depiction of a trumpet in a truly \\"musical\\" setting. Egyptian trumpeters are often, though not always, shown in pairs. The oldest surviving examples of metallic trumpets are the two instruments that were discovered in the tomb of Tutankhamun in 1922. One of these is long and is made of silver; it has a conical tube in diameter, and a flaring bell wide. The other instrument is long and is made of copper with gold overlay. Neither instrument has a separate mouthpiece and their respective weights have not been documented. Both are inscribed with the names of gods associated with Egyptian army divisions. A third trumpet, probably dating from the Ptolemaic era, is now preserved in the Louvre museum in Paris. Ancient Israel Other trumpets are mentioned in the Bible besides the primitive shofar: the yowbel was the ram's-horn trumpet whose sound made the walls of Jericho fall down (Joshua 6); the taqowa' was a Jewish military trumpet which is mentioned in Ezekiel 7:14. The best known Biblical trumpet after the shofar, however, is the hasoserah. In the Book of Numbers, Moses is instructed to make two silver hasoserah: > 2Make thee two trumpets of silver; of a whole piece shalt thou make them: > that thou mayest use them for the calling of the assembly, and for the > journeying of the camps. 3And when they shall blow with them, all the > assembly shall assemble themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of > the congregation. 4And if they blow but with one trumpet, then the princes, > which are heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves unto > thee. 5When ye blow an alarm, then the camps that lie on the east parts > shall go forward. 6When ye blow an alarm the second time, then the camps > that lie on the south side shall take their journey: they shall blow an > alarm for their journeys. 7But when the congregation is to be gathered > together, ye shall blow, but ye shall not sound an alarm. 8And the sons of > Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets; and they shall be to you > for an ordinance for ever throughout your generations. 9And if ye go to war > in your land against the enemy that oppresseth you, then ye shall blow an > alarm with the trumpets; and ye shall be remembered before the Lord your > God, and ye shall be saved from your enemies. 10Also in the day of your > gladness, and in your solemn days, and in the beginnings of your months, ye > shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the > sacrifices of your peace offerings; that they may be to you for a memorial > before your God.... (Numbers 10:2‚Äì10, King James Version.) The hasoserah was played in two different ways: taqa‚Äò and teruw‚Äòah. The former referred to a continuous sounding of the instrument by one or two Levites during religious ceremonies; the latter referred to the sounding of an alarm or military signal, and was always carried out by two trumpeters. In the 18th century the German music theorist Johann Ernst Altenburg compared these two styles of playing to the two styles of trumpet playing prevalent in the Late Baroque: the mellow style of the principale and the strident style of the clarino. The military use of the natural trumpet is recorded in many passages of the Bible (e.g. Jeremiah 4:19, Zephaniah 1:16, Amos 2:2). Other passages recount its use as a celebratory instrument (e.g. II Kings 11:14, II Chronicles 5:12‚Äì13, Psalms 98:6). Josephus, who credits Moses with the invention of the hasoserah, describes the instrument thus: > ‚ÄúIn length it was little less than a cubit []. It was composed of a narrow > tube, somewhat thicker than a flute, but with so much breadth as was > sufficient for admission of the breath of a man's mouth: it ended in the > form of a bell, like common trumpets. Its sound was called in the Hebrew > tongue Asosra.‚Äù (Antiquities of the Jews, 3.291) The hasoserah is depicted on the Arch of Titus among the spoils taken by the Romans in the sack of Jerusalem in 70 CE (though these particular trumpets appear to be at least long). Babylon and Assyria A straight trumpet similar to the Egyptian sheneb was also used in ancient Babylonia and Assyria, where it was called the qarna. On a relief from the time of Sennacherib (reigned 705‚Äì681 BCE) depicting the moving of a colossal bull statue, two trumpeters are standing on the statue; one is playing while the other rests. Among the descendants of the qarna are the Persian karranay and the Safavid karna. The latter, a straight metallic trumpet, can still be found in northern India. Ancient Greece The war-trumpet used by the ancient Greeks was called the salpinx, and was probably adapted from the Egyptian sheneb. There is a fine example on display in Boston's Museum of Fine Arts; the tube of this particular salpinx is long and consists of thirteen cylindrical parts made of ivory; the instrument's bell and mouthpiece are both made of bronze, as are the rings used to hold the ivory sections together; the instrument is thought to date from the second half of the 5th century BCE. The Greek playwright Aeschylus described the sound of the salpinx as \\"shattering\\"; the word salpinx is thought to mean \\"thunderer\\". At the Olympic Games, contests of trumpet playing were introduced for the first time in 396 BCE. These contests were judged not by the participants' musical skill but by the volume of sound they generated! Among the more famous trumpeters who participated in the games was Achias, who was awarded first prize on three occasions and in whose honour a column was erected. Another famous contestant was Herodorus of Megas, a man of immense stature, whose playing was so loud that audiences were allegedly concussed by his performances. By winning the trumpet contest at Olympia, a trumpeter was authorized to perform at the hippodrome and to introduce the athletes for the remainder of the games. On a painted ceramic knee guard dating from around 500 BCE, a salpinx call is recorded using the Greek syllables TOTH TOTOTE. This is the earliest example of trumpet notation anywhere in the world. Etruria and Ancient Rome The use of the natural trumpet as a fully-fledged military signalling instrument is generally credited to the ancient Romans; a total of forty-three signals are said to have been used in the Roman army. Since the early days of the Republic, two centuriates of troops (about 160 men) were composed entirely of trumpeters; these musicians, called aenatores, employed a variety of instruments. It is now thought that the Romans adapted these instruments, and possibly also the signals sounded on them, from Etruscan models. The Etruscans were expert metallurgists and keen musicians, and musical instruments were just some of the many inventions they bequeathed to their Roman conquerors. Among the trumpet-like instruments used by the Romans, the following four may be distinguished: *The tuba was a straight trumpet played by a tubicen. It was about long and had a conical bore of between . It was usually made of bronze and was played with a detachable bone mouthpiece. It had a slightly flared bell. The Roman tuba was probably a direct ancestor of both the Western trumpet and the Western horn. (The modern tuba, which shares its name with the Roman tuba, however, is a recent invention.) *The cornu was a natural horn about long, with a wide, conical bore; it was made of bronze and took the form of a letter G. It was played with a cup-shaped mouthpiece. The large flaring bell curved over the player's head or shoulder. The cornu was played by a trumpeter known as a cornicen. *The buccina, or bucina, was played by a buccinator. This was of similar construction to the cornu and was also played with a cup-shaped mouthpiece, but it had a narrower, more cylindrical bore. The military buccina evolved from a primitive prototype, the buccina marina, which was a natural conch-shell trumpet; in Roman poetry the buccina marina is often called the concha. *The lituus was a long J-shaped trumpet. Essentially, it was a straight trumpet, like the tuba, to which an animal-horn trumpet was attached to act as a bell; it is not unlike the Celtic carnyx. The lituus was a cult instrument used in Roman rituals and does not appear to have had any military uses, though the term was later used in the Middle Ages to denote a military trumpet. Surviving litui are between long. Being the shortest of the Roman trumpets, the lituus was a higher pitched instrument, the sound of which Classical writers described as acutus (\\"high\\"). The lituus and the buccina are frequently confused. The late Roman writer Vegetius briefly describes the use of trumpets in the Roman legions in his treatise De Re Militari: > The legion also has its tubicines, cornicines and buccinatores. The tubicen > sounds the charge and the retreat. The cornicines are used only to regulate > the motions of the colours; the tubicines serve when the soldiers are > ordered out to any work without the colours; but in time of action, the > tubicines and cornicines sound together. The classicum, which is a > particular signal of the buccinatores or cornicines, is appropriated to the > commander-in-chief and is used in the presence of the general, or at the > execution of a soldier, as a mark of its being done by his authority. The > ordinary guards and outposts are always mounted and relieved by the sound of > the tubicen, who also directs the motions of the soldiers on working parties > and on field days. The cornicines sound whenever the colours are to be > struck or planted. These rules must be punctually observed in all exercises > and reviews so that the soldiers may be ready to obey them in action without > hesitation according to the general's orders either to charge or halt, to > pursue the enemy or to retire. For reason will convince us that what is > necessary to be performed in the heat of action should constantly be > practised in the leisure of peace. (De Re Militari, Book II) Like the Greek salpinx the Roman trumpets were not regarded as musical instruments. Among the tems used to describe the tone of the tuba, for instance, were horribilis (‚Äúhorrible‚Äù), terribilis (‚Äúterrible‚Äù), raucus (‚Äúraucous‚Äù), rudis (‚Äúcoarse‚Äù), strepens (‚Äúnoisy‚Äù) and stridulus (‚Äúshrieking‚Äù). When sounding their instruments, the tubicines sometimes girded their cheeks with the capistrum (‚Äúmuzzle‚Äù) which aulos (‚Äúflute‚Äù) players used to prevent their cheeks from being puffed out unduly. Middle East After the fall of the Western Empire in 476, the trumpet disappeared from Europe for more than half a millennium. Elsewhere the art of bending long metal tubes was lost, for the trumpets of the succeeding era lacked the characteristic G-like curve of the cornu and buccina. The straight-tubed Roman tuba, however, continued to flourish in the Middle East among the Sassanids and their Arabic successors. The Saracens, whose long metal trumpets greatly impressed the Christian armies at the time of the Crusades, were ultimately responsible for reintroducing the instrument to Europe after a lapse of six hundred years. During the last centuries of the Roman Empire the name buccina was widely used throughout the Near East to denote a particular type of straight trumpet similar to, and probably derived from, the Roman tuba. From this, undoubtedly, derives the generic term b≈´q, which first occurs after 800; this was the name used by the Arabs to describe a variety of both trumpet-like and horn-like instruments. The b≈´q al-nafƒ´r (\\"buc[cina] of war\\") was a long straight metal trumpet used in the military bands of the Abbasid period (750‚Äì1258) and thereafter; by the 14th century it could be as much as long. From the 11th century, this term was used to denote any long straight trumpet. Other Arabic words for trumpets of various sizes and shapes include qarnƒÅ and s≈´r; the latter is the name used in the Qur'an for the Last Trump that will announce Judgment Day. The qarnƒÅ is thought to be a descendant of the ancient Mesopotamian instrument of the same name. The Saracens are sometimes said to be the first people to make brass trumpets from hammered sheet, though this is not at all certain. Many of the long, straight metal trumpets that first appeared around this time were associated with the spread of Islam. In Africa, for example, end-blown metal trumpets are found only in Islamic regions such as Nigeria, Chad and central Cameroon. Known as kakaki (among the Hausa of Nigeria) or gashi (in Chad), these trumpets consist of narrow cylindrical tubes, sometimes over in length, with flared metal bells. The silver nafiri is one of only two trumpets found in Malaysia; its name clearly derives from the Arabic b≈´q al-nafƒ´r. Slightly less than long, a single nafiri is present in each of the royal nobat ensembles maintained by the local sultans. As in Africa, these royal ensembles play on ceremonial occasions and Islamic holidays. Asia Playing trumpet at Palace Temple. Mandi, Himachal Pradesh, India The dung is the long monastic trumpet of Tibet; it is similar to, and probably derives from, straight trumpets depicted in 13th-century Arabic and Persian manuscripts. The dung is a straight, end-blown trumpet with a conical bore; it is made of copper or brass and has a separate mouthpiece. It varies in length from about (the medium-sized rag-dun) to as much as (the telescopic dung-chen). In musical ensembles, two such instruments blown in alternation provide a continuous drone, which is sustained beneath the woodwind and percussion. Monk with trumpets and hats. Key Monastery Spiti, Himachal Pradesh, India The dung-chen can also be found in the northern hills of Laddakh in India and in Bhutan, where it is known by the name thunchen. This ceremonial instrument is used to accompany ritual dances. Nearly long, it is made of copper and decorated with silver. The thunchen is generally employed in pairs; the trumpeters, known as thunchen pa, announce the commencement of ceremonies from the gamba, or temple, and also accompany ritual dances. The length and weight of thunchen make it extremely unwieldy; so the flared end is rested on the ground or a special stand, or is supported on the shoulders of another monk. Possibly related to the Tibetan dung is the tirucinnam, a straight trumpet still found in Tamil Nadu in southern India. Usually a pair of these long, slender instruments are blown together; until a few decades ago it was standard practice for one musician to play both of them simultaneously, which seems to have been the case also in Nepal. A double trumpet of this type is depicted on a relief in Chandi Jawri, Indonesia, dated to 1300. The tirucinnam is about long and has a wide cylindrical bore; it has a narrow conical bell but no mouthpiece (to facilitate the simultaneous blowing of two instruments). The Chinese too had a long cylindrical metal trumpet known as haotong (or, in Japanese, dokaku), which may have been related to the foregoing instruments. In place of a bell, the haotong had a long, broad cylinder made of wood, iron or brass, into which the rest of the instrument could be telescoped when not in use; the haotong was played with the bell end resting on the ground. The ordinary Chinese trumpet was the laba (rappa in Japanese). This came from Mongolia, where it was called the rapal. It had a narrow, conical bore and consisted of two or three sections which telescoped into each other. (Chinese sources record the use of trumpets on the battlefield by the Huns, or Xiongnu, in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE.)

Vegetius makes a clear distinction between the cornu and the buccina; moreover, he refers to the instrument played by the cornicen as an aes curvum, or brass curve, rather than a cornu. Ovid (Metamorphoses, 1:98) refers to aeris cornua, \\"brass horns\\". See Meucci (1989) for further details, including the claim that Vegetius originally described the buccina as being made of animal horn rather than metal. #This instrument is mentioned, for example, in an apocryphal letter of St. Jerome to Dardanus, prefect of Gaul. #Baibars, the Sultan of Egypt from 1260‚Äì1277, numbered twenty trumpeters among the sixty-eight members of his military band.

They are very different from the trio sonatas in the Italian manner (such as those of Corelli), where the harpsichord is only providing the role of a continuo bass. In Rameau's works, the harpsichord is at the heart of the ensemble, playing a fully written-out obbligato part with virtuosity, with the accompaniment falling to the violin and viola da gamba. Rameau provided for differing instrumental combinations: the flute can replace the violin and a second violin can replace the viola da gamba. It is possible to compare these works with the violin sonatas of Johann Sebastian Bach, written earlier, around 1720, in which the melodic material is shared equally between the violin and harpsichord and the harpsichord part is obbligato nearly throughout. They are divided into five concerts of three to four movements with typical French 'character' names, some of which can be enigmatic: a name of a place (Le V√©zinet), of character (La timide, L'aga√ßante) or of persons (La Forqueray, La Marais, La Rameau).

The building opened in 1941 as the Elgin Theater, a movie house, and was gut-renovated and reconfigured in 1981-82 to reopen as the Joyce Theater. The Joyce is a leading presenter of dance in New York City and nationally. Creation of The Joyce In 1977, the Eliot Feld Ballet had begun exploring more affordable approaches to presenting its annual season of performances in New York City. Rental costs and house sizes of the theaters available to the company made these seasons financially risky propositions. Eliot Feld, the company‚Äôs founder and Artistic Director, and Cora Cahan, its Executive Director, envisioned creating a theater specifically for smaller dance organizations that their company could use, which would also be available to other companies. The first facility they looked at in late 1978 was the Elgin Theater, a defunct movie theater in Manhattan‚Äôs Chelsea neighborhood built in 1941. They quickly commenced negotiations to purchase it, ultimately arriving at a price of $225,000 and concluded the transaction in January, 1979. The philanthropist LuEsther Mertz, co-founder of Publishers Clearing House and a benefactor of the company who had supported the renovation of the company‚Äôs studio, underwrote the full cost of the purchase. In developing financial projections for the theater, Feld and Cahan anticipated an inclusive rental cost of around $12,000 per week. In a national survey they conducted, 73 dance organizations expressed interest in using the theater at the projected rental rate. These findings helped garner a wide range of financial support for developing the theater. The project secured a $400,000 Federal Urban Development Action Grant, which recognized its potential to provide employment and add to the vitality of its neighborhood. Other Federal Government support included a $450,000 challenge grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, and a guarantee of a $600,000 bank loan. Private donors and foundations such as the Rockefeller Foundation contributed the balance of the funds. Feld and Cahan engaged architect Hugh Hardy of the firm Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer to develop plans for a gut renovation of the facility. Major changes to the structure included the elimination of the original balcony configuration to create a steeply raked seating area on one level, new construction at the rear of the building to provide additional backstage space, and the installation of a 67 x 36 foot proscenium stage with a sprung floor. The completed theater had 472 seats. The overall cost of the project was $3.6 million. At the June 25, 1981 groundbreaking, the building was renamed the Joyce Theater after the daughter of LuEsther Mertz in recognition of the elder Mertz‚Äôs leadership support of the project. The theater opened with a gala performance on June 2, 1982. The Feld organization retained ownership of the building and created a separate non-profit organization to operate the theater under a 35-year lease at a nominal rent of $1 a year. As the 2016 conclusion of the lease term approached, the operating organization, the Joyce Theater Foundation, purchased the theater from the Feld organization for $20 million.Both the Feld organization and the Joyce Theater Foundation operated under successive legal names during the period recounted here. For the sake of clarity, these various names are elided in this section. Governance and management The Joyce is a 501(c)3 charitable organization whose mission is ‚ÄúTo serve and support the art of dance and choreography, to promote the richness and variety of the art form in its fullest expression, and to advance the public interest in, and appreciation of, dance and the allied arts of music, design, and theater.‚Äù A 27-member Board of Trustees oversees the organization. It operates on a budget of around $10 million annually that is supported by earned revenue, contributed income, government support and endowment income. Executive Director Linda Shelton oversees day-to-day activities of the Joyce, supported by a full-time staff of approximately 45 people. Before joining the Joyce in 1993, Shelton was General Manager of the Joffrey Ballet, and had earlier held senior management roles at Twyla Tharp Dance. Aaron Mattocks is Director of Programming, with lead responsibility for developing each year‚Äôs presenting season. Main activities The Joyce presents an annual 40 to 45 week season on its stage, hosting an audience of approximately 150,000 people. In addition to this Chelsea season, the Joyce presents or co-presents at a small number of other venues, including the David H. Koch Theater at Lincoln Center and alternative spaces. Through artistic residency and commissioning programs, the Joyce gives resources to established, early- and mid-career artists to advance their practice and develop new works for the Joyce stage. New commissions are supported by the Stephen and Cathy Weinroth Fund for New Works, a $1 million endowment contributed by a Joyce board member. The organization also mounts a range of education, school and family programs that range from structured class visits to Joyce performances, to lessons at schools and community centers with Joyce-affiliated teaching artists, to family matinees with discount tickets for children. World Trade Center cultural center In 2004, The Joyce's proposal to operate a dance theater in the planned \\"arts hub\\" at the World Trade Center was accepted by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. The Joyce would have been one of several arts organizations at the facility, and proposed a 1,000-seat theater for major dance companies, with supporting programming. In the ensuing years, the vision for the cultural center has evolved through multiple iterations and tenant lists. It is currently planned as The Ronald O. Perelman Performing Arts Center, a multi- venue facility encompassing a range of performing and media arts. The Joyce's role in the current plan for the center has not been announced. Former affiliated spaces =Joyce SoHo= In 1996, The Joyce purchased a dance performance and rehearsal facility at 155 Mercer Street in Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood that was owned and operated by the Dia Art Foundation. The building had been used for dance since 1985, and was sold because of financial difficulties at Dia. The Joyce obtained the building for $1.5 million with support from the LuEsther T. Mertz Charitable Trust, the charitable organization established by the organization's longstanding benefactor LuEsther T. Mertz upon her death. The Joyce continued Dia's program of rehearsal space rental and performances in the 75-seat theater until 2012, when it accepted an unsolicited offer to sell the building for $27.25 million. =DANY Studios= In December, 2009, the Joyce leased a rehearsal studio facility at 305 West 38th Street, in Manhattan's Garment District, that it operated under the name DANY [Dance Art New York] Studios. The facility contained 11 studios. The Joyce did not renew when its lease ended in 2016 and closed DANY.

Scribner (October 10, 1910 - December 21, 1976) was an American animator best known for his work on the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of cartoons from Warner Bros. Cartoons. He worked during the Golden age of American animation. Early life Scribner had an interest in drawing in high school. Drawing was one of his subjects (along with English and political science) when he attended Denison University for three years. Later, after an interlude spent as an manager of an \\"hunting marsh\\", he studied art in Toledo, Ohio, and at the Chouinard Art Institute before he joined the Schlesinger animation staff. Career Rod Scribner started as an assistant animator for Friz Freleng in 1935, then a main animator for Ben Hardaway and Cal Dalton in 1938, and also briefly animated for Chuck Jones the next year. In 1940, he joined Tex Avery's unit and worked with Robert McKimson, Charles McKimson, Virgil Ross, and Sid Sutherland.Irv Spence and Rod Scribner, One-Shot Moonlighters In late 1941, after Tex Avery left to direct Speaking of Animals series for Jerry Fairbank Productions, he was replaced as the unit director by Bob Clampett. Scribner's animation matched Clampett's expansive and energetic cartoons. Clampett classics such as A Tale of Two Kitties (1942), Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs (1943), and The Great Piggy Bank Robbery (1946) showcase some of his trademark \\"Lichty style\\" of animation, which he proposed to Clampett. Clampett left Warner Bros. in 1945 to pursue a career in puppetry and television. Not much is known about where Scribner was between 1946 and 1949 (although he did some animation on three McKimson cartoons starring Porky, Daffy and an elephant named Bobo in 1947).In His Own Words: Bob Clampett at Warners He briefly was a cartoonist on Happy Comic's Rowdy Runner and a January 1945 issue of a military magazine called \\"Service Ribbin\\". In 1950, Scribner returned to Warner Bros. under Robert McKimson's unit. His animation was tamed down to McKimson's standards, but he still got away with energetic scenes, like in Hillbilly Hare (1950), Hoppy Go Lucky (1952) and Of Rice and Hen (1953).Robert McKimson‚Äôs ‚ÄúOf Rice and Hen‚Äù (1953)Robert McKimson‚Äôs ‚ÄúHillbilly Hare‚Äù (1950) According to Warner Brothers animator Lloyd Turner in an interview, Scribner was irresponsible at McKimson's unit and was thoroughly crazy. Turner says Scribner did a lot of weird things including burning his house down, and that he had a disdain towards his colleague Arthur Davis, although it is unknown why but it is presumably because Davis replaced Clampett after his departure. Scribner played a lot of pranks on Davis at McKimson's unit, and one time while Davis was in John W. Burton's and on a telephone line in a phone booth, Scribner elbowed Turner and said to him, \\"Watch me fix Davis\\". Scribner went on the other side of the booth and tipped the telephone into a 45 degree angle and it boomed like a bomb. Davis was scared, Scribner tipped the phone back, and Scribner ran and, according to Turner \\"laughed like he was possessed\\". When Davis saw him running out, he got mad. He left Warners in 1954 and worked for UPA, Jay Ward, and Storyboard Inc. from the 50's to the mid 60's.Commercials Animated By Rod Scribner When Scribner went to work at Bakshi Studios, he sat down with Bakshi and said to him, \\"Ralph, I can't do this anymore. I love what you're doing, and this is going to be the greatest studio in the world, but I just can't do it anymore.\\" He cried while he was speaking and handed his scene in. Bakshi recalled the scene looking \\"absolutely hideous\\" and looking like something was wrong with him, which ironically, there was. Although Scribner was credited, most of his animation were thrown out or overhauled.Thad Komorowski In his later years, Scribner worked with former colleague Bill Melendez on various Charlie Brown movies and television specials that worked in Snoopy Come Home (1972), There's No Time for Love, Charlie Brown (1973) and It's the Easter Beagle, Charlie Brown (1974), eventually starting at an studio called Playhouse Pictures, which produced commercials for over 45 years.Playhouse Potpurri The only thing he didn't do for UPA or his former colleague Melendez is an 1968 training video for IBM called A Computer Glossary.https://mubi.com/films/a-computer- glossaryA Computer Glossary Death and legacy After Scribner's death, many people in the animation industry praised his work. (examples shown) After being arrested and put on suicide watch in a mental hospital, Scribner died there on December 21, 1976 from tuberculosis, which he had contracted during World War II. His last project was Race For Your Life, Charlie Brown, released posthumously in Summer 1977.http://www.toonzone.net/forums/threads/question- about-rod-scribner.3657641/http://dmgermain.blogspot.com/2006/03/rod- scribner.html Bill Plympton says his work on Coal Black \\"is a masterpiece of animation and distortion\\" and that the animation in the Clampett cartoons blew his mind.On Animation: The Directors Perspective pg. 351Making Toons That Sell Without Selling pg. 111 Cartoon Brew puts him on Number 18 on the list of \\"25 Great Cartoonists You Should Know\\"25 Great Cartoonists You Should Know John Kricfalusi is a \\"Scribner fanatic\\" and is the reason why he has a despise for Disney animation.An Exchange with John K.A Story of Rod Scribner Partial filmography =Warner Bros.= *A Tale of Two Kitties *Hare Ribbin' *All This and Rabbit Stew *A Corny Concerto *The Great Piggy Bank Robbery *Private Snafu *Of Rice of Hen *The Night WatchmanChuck Jones‚Äô ‚ÄúThe Night Watchman‚Äù (1938) *Falling Hare *Gruesome Twosome *Russian Rhapsody *Draftee Daffy *A Wild Hare *The Prize Pest *Quack Shot *An Itch in Time *Porky's Hare Hunt *A-Lad-In Bagdad *Tortoise Wins by a Hare =Commercials= *Kool Aid (1964‚Äì65) (mostly directed by Tex Avery and features Bugs and Elmer)Bugs Bunny Kool-Aid Commercial *Hawaiian Punch (1965-1975) *Cheerios with Rocky and Bullwinkle (1960's) *Bank of America *Foremost *ABC Saturday Morning =John Hubley= * A Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass Double Feature *Urbanissimo *The Gerald McBoing-Boing Show =Bakshi Productions= *Fritz the Cat =Peanuts= *Race For Your Life, Charlie Brown *Snoopy Come Home References External links * Category:1910 births Category:1976 deaths Category:20th-century deaths from tuberculosis Category:American animators Category:American animated film producers Category:Warner Bros.

It was declared to protect and to make a refuge for the displaced wild animals during the Mahaweli Development Project in 1984 and is one of the four National Parks designated under the Project. Originally it was designated as a nature reserve in 1938, and then in the early 1970s the area was regraded as a strict nature reserve. Wasgamuwa is one of protected areas where Sri Lankan Elephants can be seen in large herds. It is also one of the Important Bird Areas in Sri Lanka. The name of the Wasgamuwa has derived through the words \\"Walas Gamuwa\\". \\"Walasa\\" is Sinhala for sloth bear and \\"Gamuwa\\" means a wood. The park is situated 225 km away from Colombo. Physical features The National Park's annual daily temperature is and has a dry zone climate. Annual rainfall ranges between 1650‚Äì2100 mm. Rain is received during the north-eastern monsoon, from October to January. July‚ÄìSeptember is the dry season. Highest elevation of the National Park is Sudu Kanda (White mountain), which is of height. The soil of the national park contains quartz and marble. The forests of Wasgamuwa represent Sri Lanka dry- zone dry evergreen forests. The park consists of primary, secondary, riverine forests and grasslands. History and historic irrigation Ruins of Malagamuwa, Wilmitiya, Dasthota irrigation tanks and Kalinga Yoda Ela canal which are built by ParƒÅkramabƒÅhu I remain in the national park. In the past water was irrigated from the Minipe anicut's left bank canal to Parakrama Samudra by Amban ganga which had run through Wasgamuwa. Yudangana Pitiya has identified as the battleground of the battle between King Ellalan and King Dutthagamani taken place. A grassland that the Dutthagamani's army supposed to have camped before the battle is known as Kandauru Pitiya. The ruins of Chulangani chaitya which is built by King Mahanaga can be seen in the national park. Its circumference, is greater than the Ruwanwelisaya's. The artifacts that have been recovered from the bricks of the chaitya include a bowl used by King Sri Vikrama Rajasinha and several bronze statues are now kept in the Yudangana vihara. Flora Safari trail at Wasgamuwa. Wasgamuwa National Park exhibits one of the highest biodiversity among the protected areas in Sri Lanka. More than 150 floral species have recorded from the park. Cryptocoryne walkeri and Munronia pumila are two plants with economic value. Reservoirs and riverine forests support large number of fauna species. The forest consists of several layers. Chloroxylon swietenia, Manilkara hexandra, Elaeodendron glaucum, Pterospermum canescens, Diospyros ebenum, Holoptelea intergrifolia, Pleurostylia opposita, Vitex altissima, Drypetes sepiaria, and Berrya cordifolia are dominant trees in the emergent layer. Polyalthia korinti, Diplodiscus verrucosus, Limonia acidissima, Cassia roxburghii and Strobilanthes stenoden are common in other strata. Some 1,700 years old tamarind tree, \\"Oru Bendi Siyambalawa\\" (Sinhala for Canoes-Moored-Tamarind) was situated in the park. Fauna peafowl enjoying the morning sun Wasgamuwa National Park is home to 23 species of mammals. The park is inhabited by a herd of 150 Sri Lankan elephants. Marsh elephant (Elephas maximus vil-aliya) roams in the Mahaweli river area. Both monkeys found in the park, purple-faced langur and toque macaque, are endemic to Sri Lanka. While water buffalo and Sri Lankan axis deer are common to observe, Sri Lanka leopard and sloth bear are rare. Small golden palm civet is another rare endemic mammal. The number of bird species recorded from the park is 143. This includes 8 endemic species. Endemic red-faced malkoha is a resident bird in this national park. Sri Lanka junglefowl is another endemic bird inhabits the park. Lesser adjutant, yellow-fronted barbet, and Sri Lanka spurfowl are the species that visit the reservoirs and streams of the national park. Peafowl, painted stork, black-headed ibis and Eurasian spoonbill are the park's other aquatic birds. Rare Sri Lanka frogmouth can be found here. Another rare species, chestnut-winged cuckoo, is seen near the Mahaweli river. Endemic and endangered Fejervarya pulla is one of the eight species of amphibians of the park. Of 17 reptile species recorded in the park, five species are endemic. Water monitor and mugger crocodile are common in the waterbodies of the park. Skinks Lankascincus spp., lizards Calotes ceylonensis and Otocryptis wiegmanni, and serpent Chrysopelea taprobanica are the endangered reptile species. Endemic Garra ceylonensis and combtail are among the 17 fish species reside in the aquatic habitats of the park. Of the park's 50 butterflies, eight species are endemic. Threats and conservation There is a possibility that wild animals might catch diseases by coming into contact with domestic cattle, which are released to park's grasslands by the villagers. Wild animals have to compete with these cattle as they have occupied the grazing lands and water pools. These cattle also damage the park's electric fence. Illegal logging is a major threat and preventing it has been a difficult issue. Elephants damage the properties of the villagers and fatal attacks on them have reported from the park. An elephant transit home is being proposed in the Wasgamuwa National Park. Environmentalists raised concern over proposed resettlement of displaced people from the construction of Moragahakanda reservoir. It is suggested that this resulted in escalating the elephant-human clash.

Career Lopo Soares de Albergaria (sometimes called Lopo Soares de Alvarenga, or simply Lopo Soares) was a middling noble, well-connected to the powerful Almeida family. Lopo Soares had served a successful term (1495‚Äì99) as captain-general of S√£o Jorge da Mina in the Portuguese Gold Coast (West Africa). In 1504, Lopo Soares commanded the 6th Portuguese India Armada. Regarded as one of the more successful early India armadas, Lopo Soares brought the fleet back in 1505 nearly intact, with one of the best cargos yet received by King Manuel I of Portugal. This placed him in a good position for future preferment and appointments. In March 1515 Lopo Soares de Albergaria was chosen by king Manuel I of Portugal to supersede governor Afonso de Albuquerque, and departed from Lisbon to India on 7 April. The seventeen ship fleet transported also an embassy to the Emperor of Ethiopia with Portuguese ambassador Duarte Galv√£o, Ethiopian ambassador Mateus (also known as Matthew the Armenian) and father Francisco √Ålvares. In August, having learned through contacts in Venice that the Mamluk Sultan of Cairo had prepared a fleet at Suez to fight the Portuguese, king Manuel repented to have replaced Albuquerque, and immediately wrote to Albergaria to return the command of all operations to Albuquerque, and provide him with resources to fight.

Early life  He was born in c. 1732 in Karabakh. He was among deportees to Astarabad with his father Panah Ali Khan. He returned to Karabakh after Adil Shah issued a firman (decree) recognizing Panah Ali as the new khan. Participating in internal politics of his father, he was married with Hurizad, daughter of Armenian melik of Varanda - Shahnazar II, as a tool of marriage alliance. Panah Ali further wed him with Shahnisa, sister of Nazarali Khan Shahsevan of Ardabil and Tuti, daughter of Shahverdi Khan of Ganja in 1749. He was given as hostage to Fath-Ali Khan Afshar in 1759, who was defeated by Karim Khan Zand later. He was released by Karim Khan in 1759 and was allowed back to Karabakh.  Reign  He had to contest the khanate with Mehrali bey Javanshir, his younger brother who was left behind by his father Panah Ali Khan prior to his departure to Iran in 1759. Ibrahim Khalil emerged victorious thanks to aid by his new relative Umma Khan of Avar Khanate and forced his brother to flee the region. Later in his reign, Avar and Karabakh khanates coordinated against growing power of Fatali Khan of Quba. Despite their efforts, Shirvan Khanate was invaded by Fatali and Quba's power continued to grow. However later in 1774, combined forces of Amir Hamza of Qaytaq, Muhammad Husayn Khan Mushtaq of Shaki, Muhammed Khan of Gazikumukh Khanate, Rustam of Tabasaran Principality, Ali Sultan of Dzhengutay and other Dagestan forces clashed with Fatali Khan in Battle of Gavdushan plains near Khudat. This was a heavy blow to Fatali Khan's ambitions, he fled scene wounded. In the 1780s, Ibrahim Khalil Khan emerged as one of the most powerful rulers in the eastern Caucasus. He aspired to bring most of the Muslim-ruled territory from the Caucasus mountains as far south as Tabriz under his sway, but eventually he had to curb his efforts in the face of the rising Qajar power in Iran. He was then allied with the Georgian king Erekle II of Kartli- Kakheti and the two interfered in the affairs of the Erivan khanate and made the Ganja Khanate their puppet. Muhammad Hasan of Ganja was soon arrested by Ibrahim Khalil together his son Agha. However Fatali Khan invaded Karabakh in 1780 by crossing the Kura River, but then Erekle II helped Ibrahimkhalil Khan by sending him a detachment under the command of princes George and David. In August of that year the khan of Quba undertook an unsuccessful campaign again, but in the beginning of 1781 he could penetrate deep into Karabakh and to captured some amount of peasants from there.Vadim Nikolayevich Leviatov, –û—á–µ—Ä–∫–∏ –∏–∑ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏ –ê–∑–µ—Ä–±–∞–π–¥–∂–∞–Ω–∞ –≤ XVIII –≤–µ–∫–µ [Essays on the history of Azerbaijan in the 18th century], Baku, 1948, p.112 The alliance waned after Erekle accepted the Russian protectorate in the treaty of Georgievsk in 1783. Ibrahim maintained contact with the Russian authorities, but did not sign any formal treaty. Museum of History of Azerbaijan = Campaigns against the Melikdoms = Like his father, Ibrahim Khalil Khan also campaigned against Armenian meliks of Karabakh starting from 1775. Allying with Meliks of Varanda and Khachen, khan campaigned against Melik Yesai of Dizak. In one of those battles, Melik Mirzakhan of Khachen was captured by Yesai and beheaded in 1775. However, after a long siege of Togh, Melik Yesai was captured and strangled in prison in summer of 1781. His nephew, Bakhtam was put in his place by the khan. As next step, khan sent two Armenian assassins - namely Misael bek and his son-in-law Hagop Yuzbashi to kill Melik Mezhlum of Jraberd. However, plot failed and they were captured and executed. Misael's brother Rustam fled the scene and joined Ibrahim Khan's court in Shusha. Being son-in- law of Apres Agha, his wife Vard Khatun was a relative of Nerses V, who was based in Yerits Mankants Monastery and supported by Javad Khan and Ibrahim Khalil Khan as anti-catholicos. His successor, anti-Catholicos Israel (1728‚Äì1763) would also side with Ibrahim Khalil in future. Armenian meliks soon wrote a secret letter to Catherine II on 22 January 1783, inviting her to invade Karabakh and if possible, set a vassal Armenian state in the region. However the plot was uncovered thanks to Allahquli Hasan-Jalalyan, brother of Catholicos Hovhannes (1763-1786) who told Khan about the letters. Catholicos Israel meanwhile seized the letters on their way to Ganja, securing them for Ibrahim Khalil. Using opportunity, Khan seized Melik Mezhlum of Jraberd, Melik Abov of Gulistan, Melik Bakhtam of Dizak and Catholicos Hovhannes (alongside his brothers). Melik Bakhtam was given to Nazarali Khan Shahsevan, with whom he had a grievance, Dizak was annexed to Karabakh. Melik Abov and Mezhlum, who were imprisoned in the Shusha fortress, later managed to escape. They came to Heraclius II and the head of the Russian garrison in Tbilisi, Colonel Stepan Burnashev, to ask for troops to fight Ibrahim Khan. They were promised a detachment of 4,000 soldiers, which was to be commanded by Prince Demetrius Orbeliani. In September 1787, the troops of Heraclius II and Colonel Burnashev approached Ganja, but at that time the Russian-Turkish war broke out, and Burnashev received an order to immediately return with the troops to the Caucasian line. Heraclius also was forced to turn back. Using opportunity, Ibrahim Khan demanded that Georgia hand over the meliks to him, promising to return three thousand families of Azerbaijanis who had fled from Borchali to Karabakh in previous years. Heraclius II was inclined to satisfy the demand of Ibrahim Khan in order to keep him from hostile actions. Meliks Abov and Mezhlum, having learned about the demand of Ibrahim Khan, fled from Tbilisi to Ganja to Javad Khan. Javad Khan, who was at enmity with Ibrahim Khan, warmly welcomed them and gave them a place near Shamkhor for the peasants who would come to them from Karabakh. Other Hasan-Jalalyan brothers - Jalal bek and Daniel bek were arrested in 1791 and executed as well. Meanwhile, Ibrahim Khan elevated another anti-catholicos - Simeon (1794-1810) and established him in Yerits Mankants Monastery, while also supporting anti-Catholicos Israel in Amaras Monastery. Molla Panah Vagif was famously vizier of Karabakh Khanate = Invasion of Agha Mohammad Khan = In 1795 the ruler of Iran, Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar, attacked the region to bring it again within influence of the Iranian empire. The khans of Ganja, Nakhjavan, and Erivan submitted, but Ibrahim Khan did not. He was defeated in battle and retreated to the fortress of Shusha. After a 33 day long siege, Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar failed to take the fortress and left the region. In a verbal truce, Ibrahim Khan acknowledged Qajar supremacy and was permitted to continue to rule as Khan of Karabakh. In 1796, following Agha Mohammad Khan's return to mainland Persia, Catherine the Great ordered her army to conquer the Caucasus. Ibrahim began negotiating with the Russian commanders and agreed to cooperate with them in exchange for maintaining his rule in Karabakh. Soon after Catherine the Great died, her successor, Paul, abandoned her plans for the region and recalled the Russian troops. Using opportunity, Ibrahim and Heraclius teamed up again, this time to invade Ganja Khanate, since its ruler Javad Khan joined Qajar Army in their raid of Tbilisi. During siege of Ganja, Melik Mezhlum was killed by Apres Agha, father of anti-Catholicos Israel. In 1797, Aga Mohammad Khan, angered by the betrayal of Ibrahim Khalil Khan and other khans in the Caucasus, attacked and captured Shusha. Agha Mohammad Khan was assassinated in Shusha five days after its capture. Molla Panah Vagif, khan's vizier was captured by Muhammad bey, son of Mehrali bey and claimant to throne after few days. Ibrahim, who had fled to his in-laws in Avar Khanate, then returned to Shusha and gave Aga Mohammad Khan an honourable burial. In order to retain his position and ensure peaceful relations with the shah, he gave one of his daughters to Agha Mohammad Khan's successor to the throne, Fat‚Ä≤h Ali Shah Qajar.  End of reign  During the Russo-Persian War (1804‚Äì1813), General Tsitsianov promised that Russia would recognize Ibrahim Khan as khan and agreed that Ibrahim's elder son would succeed his father, and thus an agreement was signed between Russia and Ibrahim Khan on May 14, 1805. Tsitsianov then occupied Shusha and left a Russian garrison stationed there. Tsitsianov's death on 20 February 1806 in Baku and the breakup of the Russian offensive persuaded Ibrahim Khalil Khan, in the summer of 1806, to repudiate his allegiance to the Russians, and resubmit himself to the shah; he then asked the shah for aid in ousting the Russian garrison. As the Persian army approached Shusha, Ibrahim Khan left the fortress and camped outside. On 12 June 1806, the Russians, instigated by Ibrahim Khalil Khan's grandson and fearful of their own vulnerability, attacked the camp and killed Ibrahim Khan, one of his wives, a daughter, and his youngest son. To gain support from the local Muslims, the Russians appointed a son of Ibrahim Khalil, Mehdigulu Khan Javanshir, as khan of Karabakh.\\"History of Azerbaijan\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online:Abbas-gulu Aga Bakikhanov.

The Vacuum Cleaner: A History. McFarland. p. 49 He also designed Ferris wheels, suspension bridges and factories. Later he became Chairman and Managing Director of the British Vacuum Cleaner and Engineering Co. Early life Booth was born in Gloucester, England in 1871. He was educated at Gloucester College and Gloucester County School under headmaster the Reverend H. Lloyd Brereton. In 1889 he entered the Central Technical College, City and Guild, London after passing the entrance examination. He completed a three-year course in civil engineering and mechanical engineering under Professor William Cawthorne Unwin FRS. He completed the Diploma of Associateship (ACGI), coming second in the engineering department. He became a student of the Institution of Civil Engineers. Career In December 1892 he entered the drawing office of Messrs Maudslay Sons & Field, Lambeth, London under Mr Charles Sells, as a civil engineer. In this capacity he designed bridges and large ferris wheels for amusement parks in London, Blackpool, Paris, and Vienna. He also worked on the design of engines for Royal Navy battleships. =Vacuum cleaner= Booth is known for introducing one of the first powered vacuum cleaners. Before Booth introduced his version of the vacuum cleaner, cleaning machines blew or brushed dirt away, instead of sucking it up. As Booth recalled decades later, in 1901 he attended \\"a demonstration of an American machine by its inventor\\" at the Empire Music Hall in London. The inventor is not named, but Booth's description of the machine conforms fairly closely to American inventor John S. Thurman‚Äôs blown air design. Booth watched a demonstration of the device, which blew dust off the chairs, and thought that \\"...if the system could be reversed, and a filter inserted between the suction apparatus and the outside air, whereby the dust would be retained in a receptacle, the real solution of the hygienic removal of dust would be obtained.\\" He tested the idea by laying a handkerchief on the seat of a restaurant chair, putting his mouth to the handkerchief, and then trying to suck up as much dust as he could onto the handkerchief. Upon seeing the dust and dirt collected on the underside of the handkerchief, he realized the idea could work. Booth created a large device,Vacuum cleaner facts, information, pictures . Encyclopedia.com. Retrieved 19 June 2012. driven by an internal combustion engine. Nicknamed the \\"Puffing Billy\\", Booth's first petrol-powered, horse-drawn vacuum cleaner relied upon air drawn by a piston pump through a cloth filter. It did not contain any brushes; all the cleaning was done by suction through long tubes with nozzles on the ends. Although the machine was too bulky to be brought into the building, its principles of operation were essentially the same as the vacuum cleaners of today. He followed this up with an electric-powered model, but both designs were extremely bulky, and had to be transported by horse and carriage. The term \\"vacuum cleaner\\" was first used by the company set up to market Booth's invention, in its first issued prospectus of 1901. Booth initially did not attempt to sell his machine, but rather sold cleaning services. The vans of the British Vacuum Cleaner Company (BVCC) were bright red; uniformed operators would haul hose off the van and route it through the windows of a building to reach all the rooms inside. Booth was harassed by complaints about the noise of his vacuum machines and was even fined for frightening horses. Gaining the royal seal of approval, Booth's motorized vacuum cleaner was used to clean the carpets of Westminster Abbey prior to Edward VII's coronation in 1901. The device was used by the Royal Navy to improve the level of sanitation in the naval barracks. It was also used in businesses such as theatres and shops, although the device was too large to be feasibly used as a domestic appliance. When cleaning the Royal Mint, upon leaving he was arrested as his machine had collected a massive amount of silver dust from the coins and he had forgotten to empty it. He was however quickly released. Booth received his first patents on 18 February and 30 August 1901. Booth founded Goblin, his company to sell vacuum cleaning services and refined his invention over the next several decades. Though Goblin lost out to competition from Hoover in the household vacuum market, his company successfully turned its focus to the industrial market, building ever- larger models for factories and warehouses. Booth's company, now BVC, lives on today as a unit of pneumatic tube system maker Quirepace Ltd.British Vacuum Company. BVC. Retrieved 19 June 2012. Personal life In 1903, Booth married Charlotte Mary Pearce, one of the daughters of Francis Tring Pearce, director of the Priday, Metford and Company Limited. He was a friend of Hugh Pembroke Vowles. He was offered a Knighthood, however he turned it down. His father, Abraham Booth, was involved in the development of the transatlantic telephone lines. Booth died on 14 January 1955 in Croydon, England. Tribute On July 4, 2018, Google celebrated his 147th birthday with a Google Doodle.

Golestan-i Iram Ancestry Panah Ali Khan was from the Sarijali branch of the clan of Javanshir, who with their associate clan of Otuz-Iki (meaning thirty-two in Azerbaijani) had for long been rivals of the Yirmi-D√∂rt (meaning twenty-four in Azerbaijani) and Ziyadoglu Qajars of Ganja, whose chiefs had been official rulers of Karabakh since Safavid times. His father's name was Ibrahim agha Javanshir but information on his further ancestry is quite complicated. According to Mirza Adigozal bey, Panah Ali's paternal great- grandfather and namesake Panah Ali bey served at the headquarters of the governors (beglarbegs) of the Karabakh-Ganja province in the early 17th century, at the time when the region's was directly controlled by the Safavid Empire of Iran. He soon retired, married a woman from the Javanshir clan of Karabakh and had a son by the name of Ali (nicknamed Sarija Ali). They lived in their estate located in Arasbar (Arasbaran) (present-day Khojavend and Agdam rayons of Azerbaijan) but also owned land in Tartar and the northern shores of the Aras River. The Arasbar estate was rebuilt into a castle in Sarija Ali's son Ibrahim Khalil's lifetime and has been known as Ibrahim Khalil Galasi since.Mirza Adigozel-bek, Karabakh-name (1845), Baku, 1950, p. 54 However, aforementioned information were contested by different sources - namely Mir Mehdi Khazani who named Panah Ali khan's grandfather as Ibrahim Sultan (head of tribe ) and great-grandfather as Budagh Sultan (head of tribe ). While Azerbaijani historian E.B.Shukurzade proposed his grandfather as Panah Ali agha (I) and great-grandfather as Ibrahim Khalil agha (I). However, in all versions his father was same. He had two brothers - Fazlali bey, who was his elder and Behbud Ali bey, was his junior.  Early life  After the dethronement of the Safavids in 1736 by Nader Shah, the landed classes of Ganja and Karabakh gathered in Mughan (the Javanshirs were also among them) deciding to oppose the new shah and agreeing on trying to get the Safavids back on the throne. When this news reached Nader Shah, he ordered all Muslim landowners of the region and their families deported to Khorasan (northeastern Iran) as a punishment. As such, Panah Ali happened to be among the deportees. His elder brother and former master of ceremonies () of Nader, Fazlali bey was murdered c. 1738. This was when Panah Ali found himself displeased with Nader Shah's attitude towards him and having gathered many of those deported from Karabakh in 1736, returned to his homeland in 1747. The shah sent troops to bring back the runaway however the order was never fulfilled: Nader Shah himself was killed in Khorasan in June of the same year. The new ruler of Persia, Adil Shah issued a firman (decree) recognizing Panah Ali as the Khan of Karabakh. Reign Adil Shah's murder in 1748 left Panah Ali virtually independent. He campaigned on Five Melikdoms of Karabakh on his plan to solidify rule in Karabakh. He forged alliance with new Melik of Varanda - Melik Shahnazar II, who killed his uncle or elder brother Hovsep and usurped the rule recently. As a result, Melik Shahnazar II's daughter Hurizad was wed to Panah Ali's son Ibrahimkhalil and the melik swore fealty to khan. Alarmed meliks forged alliance and raided Shahnazar's lands but couldn't take his fortress in Avetaranots. Coin struck during reign of Panah Ali Khan in Shusha Using power vacuum same year, on west and south he campaigned against Nakhchivan and Karadagh khanates, taking Tatev and Sisian from former and Bargushat, Meghri, G√∂yn√ºk from latter; also conquering Ghapan and Zangezur from Ebrahim Afshar. On north, he subdued Kolani tribe living on shores of Tartar river. He also invited a part of Kangarlu tribe from Nakhchivan and as well as Damirchi Hasanlu and Jinli tribes from Georgia. It was also when Bayat fortress was built as the khan's first residence. In a short period of time, external walls were constructed, ditches were dug out, and the bazaar, the bath and the mosque were built. Craftsmen from surrounding areas were re- settled into the castle. Many of residents of the area and even residents, especially craftsmen of the Tabriz district and Ardabil, moved into the Bayat castle with their families.Mirza Jamal Javanshir (1847), History of Karabakh, Baku, 1959, p. 68 Strengthening of Panah Ali khan's power faced resistance from Khanate of Ganja and Khanate of Shaki and from the remaining Melikdoms of Karabakh, as well as rival branches of Javanshir clan. The struggle between the Karabakh khan and Haji Chalabi Khan of Shaki, one of the most powerful feudal rulers of the South Caucasus, started same year. Haji Chalabi Khan wishing Panah Ali khan's power not increased further, allied with Hajji Muhammad Ali Khan of Shirvan and surrounded the castle of Bayat. The allies for the unsuccessfully tried to capture the capital of the Karabakh khanate for whole month. The Shaki and Shirvan khans withdrew, incurring huge casualties and failing to accomplish the mission. Haji Chelebi Khan was forced to admit: \\"Until now Panah Khan was raw silver that was not minted. We came, minted it, and returned.\\" Same quote from another Karabakh historian of 19th century, Mirza Yusif, reads: \\"Until now Panah Khan was merely gold, we came and minted a coin from that gold.\\"Mirza Yusuf, Tarihi-Safi, 1856 In any case, Panah Ali was forced to abandon Bayat and constructed Shahbulag Castle instead. Using power vacuum in Persia, he grew ambitious and planned to subdue neighboring regions as well. He moved on Nazarali Khan Shahsevan of Ardabil in 1749 and forced him to marry his sister Shahnisa to his own son Ibrahimkhalil and accept vassalage. Same year he attacked Shahverdi Khan of Ganja and subdued him, forcing Shahverdi's daughter Tuti to marry Ibrahimkhalil as well. According to Mirza Adigozal bey, he also kept his sons as hostage in Shahbulag. However, emergence of new Qajar warlord Muhammadhasan khan forced Panah Ali to seek new fortress. On advice of Melik Shahnazar II, he built Shusha Castle in 1750-1751 and relocated his capital, thus settling semi- nomadic populace within quarters of the new city. Palace of Karabakh Khans in 19th century = Campaign against Shaki = Next year, in 1752, Teymuraz II attacked Ganja and forced Panah Ali to retreat from area. Teymuraz then allied himself to Haji Chalabi of Shaki to raid on Djaro-Belokani, only to betrayed by latter who defeated Georgian army. Using opportunity Panah Ali allied himself with Shahverdi Khan of Ganja, Kazim Khan of Karadagh, Hasan Ali Khan of Erivan, Heydarqoli Khan of Nakhchivan against Haji Chalabi of Shaki same year and invited Heraclius II to their alliance. During the negotiations near Qƒ±zƒ±lqaya, the Georgian detachments, hiding in ambush, surrounded and captured five khans along with their retinue. Haji Chalabi, having learned about the conspiracy of Heraclius II, gathered an army and began to pursue Heraclius, attacked him and defeated him in the battle at the river Aghstafa, having freed all the captured khans. Haji Chalabi later invaded the Georgian possessions, where he captured the Kazakh and Borchali regions, leaving his son Agakishi bey as viceroy. = Campaign against Melikdoms = After returning to Karabakh, Panah Khan began his campaign against remaining Armenian principalities of Karabakh. He allied with tanuter of Khndzristan village, Mirzakhan and promised him Principality of Khachen if he killed Allahverdi I Hasan-Jalalyan, achieving this Mirzakhan was made new Melik of Khachen by Panah Ali in 1755. Soon later Melik of Jraberd, Allahqoli Soltan was also arrested and beheaded in Shusha. Panah Ali signed a separate peace with Melik of Dizak, Yesai later. In 1757, Muhammadhasan khan arrived in Karabakh to gather troops to fight against Karim Khan Zand. Panah Ali refused to join his armies and battled against Qajar troops. Muhammadhasan khan soon left for Iran and left his cannons in area, which was later taken by Panah Ali. However, he soon had to face another invasion from south, this time by Fath-Ali Khan Afshar, khan of Urmia in 1759. Armenian meliks of Talish and Jraberd - Melik Atham (brother of Allahqoli) and Melik Hovsep joined Fath-Ali in his siege of Shusha. Unable to withstand, Panah Ali submitted to Fath Ali, handing over his son Ibrahimkhalil as a hostage. However, Panah Ali had to switch his allegiance towards Zands who now captured Ibrahimkhalil from Fath Ali after a battle in 1760. He left his son Mehrali bey Javanshir in charge of khanate while he left for battle against Fath Ali.Grave stone of Panah Ali Khan (Azerbaijan National History Museum) Death According to Mirza Adigozal bey when Karƒ´m Khan Zand took control of much of Iran, he forced PanƒÅh Khan to come to Shiraz (Capital), where he died as a hostage in 1763. (Although according to his gravestone in Aghdam, he died in July‚ÄìAugust 1759.) However Raffi and Mirza Yusuf Qarabaghi offer another version of Panah Ali's death, where he faked his death in order to escape Shiraz but unsuccessfully was captured, killed and his stomach was stuffed. Panah-Ali Khan's son Ibrahim-Khalil Khan was sent back to Karabakh as governor. Ibrahim, succeeding his father, not only ruled over most of QarƒÅbƒÅ·∏°, but also became one of the major potentates in the Caucasus.

It was written on 2 December 1844 and published in 1846 in a book collecting poetry by Bront√´ and her siblings.  Poem excerpt   Context  The poem appears to be a Gondal poem from the writing style, but there is nothing in the poem to confirm this theory. The narrator is an anonymous woman. There is no known character by the name of Edward in the Gondal Saga. And the one vague reference to 'Arden's lake' is unhelpful because it is not a known place in either the Gondal world or the Glass Town Confederacy. Gondal was an imaginary world created by Emily and Anne Bront√´ in their childhood. Initially, all four siblings: Charlotte, Emily, Anne and Branwell created an imaginary world called 'Angria', where each sibling ran an island with a town by the name of 'Glasstown'. They named it \\"the Glass town confederacy'. Later Emily and Anne broke off and created their own world of Gondal. Gondal also had two islands- Gaaldine and Angora. The northern island was the kingdom of Angora, and was commonly referred to as Gondal. It was a cold region with moorlands and mists. The southern island was Gaaldine, and it was a colony of mainland Gondal. Gaaldine had a more tropical climate with greenery and sunlight. Gondal is surrounded by choppy seas. Gondal's most well known character is Queen Augusta Geraldine Almeda (A.G.A). She has a number of lovers including Alexander- Lord of Elbe, Alfred Sidonia, and Fernando de Samara, all of whom are killed. There is no record of a lover by the name of Edward.  Poetic techniques  = Structure = The poem has a rhyme pattern of ABAB and stanzas 1‚Äì7 are in quotation marks, this could show that Augusta is directly addressing her husband, Edward, as she calls to him with this name. =Gondal references= The poem uses frequent references to water: \\"Arden's lake\\" in stanza 3, \\"eternal sea\\" in stanza 4 and \\"Eden isles\\" in stanza 6. This water is most probably Emily referring to the water surrounding Gondal. There are other parts of nature that are touched upon in this poem, primarily in stanza 10, these could showing how Augusta is turning to nature to help her cope with the oncoming and unavoidable grief.  Analysis  The poem describes Augusta's sorrow over her dying husband, describing the journey of his final movements. In the second stanza Augusta is trying to convince herself that he will survive, using positive words such as \\"youthful\\", \\"cheerful\\" and glowing. In the third stanza, she is willing him to awake from his endless sleep. Emily describes the surroundings of the pair as a \\"golden evening\\" and the lake as being \\"warm and bright\\" ‚Äì yet more positive imagery. The fourth stanza shows how close the couple are. True love could be what Augusta is feeling when she describes him as her \\"dearest friend\\" and wants \\"one hour delay\\" on his fate. In stanza five, Augusta describes the surroundings more with in-depth explanation of the water around them. Here it also appears that she is looking for hope as she is \\"straining\\". Stanza six shows the difference naturally between Gondal and Angria with the high oceans that are \\"tempestuous\\" and split the two up. Stanza seven follows a similar format to the third stanza, where Augusta is trying to convince herself that he is not dying. There are feelings of pain where she feels that he is leaving her. In stanza eight, the scene between the two is described as the pair look at one another: the last look of pain and suffering that \\"moved\\" Augusta. In the ninth stanza, she feels she can let go and not feel guilty for no \\"further grieving\\". Stanza ten is back to the nature of Gondal. In this stanza the sun mimics what Lord of Elb√´, Augusta's husband was doing, \\"sunk to peace\\". The setting described here is of the land, not sea, and it appears to be much like the moorland that Emily grew up in. Using somewhat religious imagery, stanza eleven describes the last few moments of life in the Lord of Elb√´. In stanza twelve, seen as it is from Augusta's point of view, confusion seems rife as she uses negatives. However, she does seem proud that her husband did not give in to weeping and wandering. In the thirteenth and final stanza, Augusta appears to come to terms with the death and is able to check his breathing. The frequent punctuation in this stanza heightens the time period that she is with him. The word \\"languid\\" shows how limp and lifeless the Lord was at his end, and the last line emphasises this as with the finality of life comes the end of the poem.

K-33 was involved in two incidents. Kattegat incident MS Finnclipper The location of the incident On 12 April 1963, K-33 collided with the Finnish merchant vessel in the Kattegat. Finnclipper, owned by Enso Gutzeit, was on her way to the United States with a load of 6,000 tons of paper. When she reached the Kattegat, there was a mist. Finnclippers crew heard engine noise on their port side at 11.05 a.m. and a submarine emerged from the mist. Finnclipper steered sharply to starboard to try to avoid a collision, but to no avail. Finnclipper immediately stopped and returned to the submarine to see if she needed help. Two Soviet officers on board told the Finnish captain that the submarine's side had suffered severe structural damage, having been pressed in and deformed. The Soviet officers did not reveal their nationality, but told Finnclippers crew that their vessel was a Warsaw Pact submarine. The Finns, however, could read the number 921 clearly on the side of the submarine, identifying her as K-33. According to some Soviet sources, K-33 underwent an overhaul at a Soviet Northern Fleet base from 25 October 1962 through 29 December 1964 and therefore could not have been involved in the collision, and at the time the Soviets claimed that the submarine involved was not a nuclear submarine, although Finnclippers crew had identified K-33 clearly. A 1996 Russian article says K-33 was en route to a patrol in the North Atlantic Ocean when she collided with Finnclipper.Podvodnye Lodki Rossii, Atomnye Pervoye Pokoleniye; Tom IV, Chast 1;1st Defense Ministry Scientific-Research Institute & Rubin Central Design Bureau of Marine Equipment; Sankt Peterburg, 1996 Finnclipper managed to cross the Atlantic Ocean after the collision, although she had sprung a leak. The severely damaged K-33 limped to Murmansk for repairs. The captain of the Finnish vessel, Runar Lindholm, gave a maritime declaration when arriving in New York, but the report was labeled \\"secret\\" for over 44 years. It has been speculated that the incident was held secret due to the Finno-Soviet Treaty of 1948, under which the Soviets could forbid the Finns to report the incident in the news media or even to research it. On 4 April 2007, Lindholm and maritime author Jaakko Varimaa, who at the time was second mate on Finnclipper, published the book Sukellusvene sumussa (\\"Submarine In The Mist\\"), revealing the accident to the general public. Arctic incident In 1965, K-33 was involved in a radiation emergency in the Arctic, involving dehermeticity of fuel elements.Sommergibili Nucleari: Problemi di sicurezza e impatto ambientale Sources * *Ilta-Sanomat 4 April 2007 References Category:Hotel-class submarines Category:Ships built in the Soviet Union Category:1960 ships Category:Cold War submarines of the Soviet Union Category:Maritime incidents in 1963 Category:Maritime incidents in 1965 ","title":"Soviet submarine K-33"},{"id":"10455422","text":"The Lamar station is a train station in Lamar, Colorado served by Amtrak.

It is catalase-negative, aerobic, beta-hemolytic, and not motile. It has been known to cause head and neck infections, pharyngitis, and sinusitis (Arcanobacterium haemolyticum infections). History It was first described by MacClean et al. in 1946 from US servicemen and peoples of the South Pacific suffering from sore throat. Due to its resemblance to another genus of bacteria, Corynebacterium, A. haemolyticum was initially classified as C. pyogenes subspecies hominus. It was known for several decades as Corynebacterium haemolyticum; controversies regarding classification were resolved in 1982 when a new genus, Arcanobacterium, was created by Collins et al. to reclassify Corynebacterium haemolyticum on the basis of its peptidoglycan, fatty acid, and DNA characteristics. Since its initial description, the spectrum of diseases caused by A. haemolyticum has been expanded to include sepsis and osteomyelitis. Organisms are Gram-positive, facultative anaerobic, catalase- negative rods (but transition to the coccal shape occurs as the organism grows) with arrangements described as matchbox or Chinese letters arrangements. Growth is enhanced in blood and by carbon dioxide. Detection Hemolysis is detected on human blood agar plates, and routine plating of specimens suspected of containing A. haemolyticum on human blood agar is suggested to distinguish it from Streptococcus pyogenes, as A. haemolyticum can easily be confused with this organism. Microscopic morphology differences can be used to differentiate them, since Arcanobacterium is rod-shaped and Streptococcus is coccus-shaped. A. haemolyticum infection is most common in 15- to 25-year-old persons and manifests as exudative pharyngitis and/or tonsillitis accompanied by cervical lymphadenopathy. Symptoms look like those of Œ≤-hemolytic streptococci or viral infection. A rash of the chest and of the abdomen, neck, or extremities is seen in 20% to 25% of cases, enhancing the risk of diagnostic error as streptococcal infection or penicillin allergy, when Œ≤-lactam therapy is initiated without exact diagnosis. A. haemolyticum often occurs in polymicrobic infections together with typical respiratory pathogens such as streptococci. The isolation of classical pathogens from specimens that also contain A. haemolyticum might be in part responsible for the tendency to miss the organism. Pathology A. haemolyticum is the cause of pharyngitis (sore throat) in up to 2.5% of cases. In one study, it was the causative agent of pharyngitis in 1.4% of military conscripts.Carlson P, Kontianinen S, Renkonen OV, Sivonen A, Vorpi R Arcanobacterium haemolyticum and streptococcal pharyngitis in army conscripts Scand J Infect Dis. 1995; 27 (1) 17‚Äì8 It is rarely found in the skin or throat of healthy people, meaning it is not a member of the usual bacterial flora. Little is known about the means by which A. haemolyticum causes infection or the associated skin manifestations. The organism is known to produce uncharacterized hemolytic agent(s), a neuraminidase and a phospholipase D (PLD) acting preferentially on sphingomyelin. PLD is known to result in tissue damage, but the role in disease of the cytotoxic effect caused by this extracellular toxin is not established. Pyothorax has been reported. Treatment A. haemolyticum isolated from humans is susceptible to erythromycin (proposed as the first- line drug), clindamycin, gentamicin, and cephalosporins. The use of parenteral antimicrobial drugs must be limited to serious infections.

It is contemporary and closely related with Gumelni»õa in southern Romania, often considered as local variants. It is characterized by polychrome pottery and rich cemeteries, the most famous of which are Varna Necropolis, the eponymous site, and the Durankulak complex, which comprises the largest prehistoric cemetery in southeastern Europe, with an adjoining coeval Neolithic settlement (published) and an unpublished and incompletely excavated Chalcolithic settlement. 294 graves have been found in the necropolis, many containing sophisticated examples of copper and gold metallurgy, pottery (about 600 pieces, including gold-painted ones), high-quality flint and obsidian blades, beads, and shells. The site was accidentally discovered in October 1972 by excavator operator Raycho Marinov. Research excavation was under the direction of Mihail Lazarov and Ivan Ivanov. About 30% of the estimated necropolis area is still not excavated. The findings showed that the Varna culture had trade relations with distant lands, possibly including the lower Volga region and the Cyclades, perhaps exporting metal goods and salt from the Provadiya rock salt mine. The copper ore used in the artifacts originated from a Sredna Gora mine near Stara Zagora, and Mediterranean spondylus shells found in the graves may have served as primitive currency. Burial rites Burials at Varna have the oldest human-modified gold artifacts in history jewelry. There are crouched and extended inhumations. Some graves do not contain a skeleton, but grave gifts (cenotaphs). The symbolic (empty) graves are the richest in gold artifacts. 3000 gold artifacts were found, with a weight of approximately 6 kilograms. Grave 43 contained more gold than has been found in the entire rest of the world for that epoch. Three symbolic graves contained masks of unfired clay. Religion The culture had sophisticated religious beliefs about afterlife and developed hierarchical status differences: it constitutes the oldest known burial evidence of an elite male. The end of the fifth millennium BC is the time that Marija Gimbutas, founder of the Kurgan hypothesis claims the transition to male dominance began in Europe. The high status male was buried with remarkable amounts of gold, held a war axe or mace and wore a gold penis sheath. The bull-shaped gold platelets perhaps also venerated virility, instinctive force, and warfare. Gimbutas holds that the artifacts were made largely by local craftspeople. Decline The discontinuity of the Varna, Karanovo, Vinƒça and Lengyel cultures in their main territories and the large scale population shifts to the north and northwest are indirect evidence of a catastrophe of such proportions that cannot be explained by possible climatic change, desertification, or epidemics. Direct evidence of the incursion of horse-riding warriors is found, not only in single burials of males under barrows, but in the emergence of a whole complex of Indo-European cultural traits.

The school has also appeared in the manga Barefoot Gen, written by Keiji Nakazawa.About Honkawa Elementary School on Hiroshima City official site History Before the atomic bomb around 1935 After the atomic bombThe school opened in the Myocho-ji, a temple of the Nichiren sect, on January 10, 1873. They built an independent schoolhouse at the current address in 1884. In July 1928 the school constructed a new building, which was the first reinforced concrete school building in Hiroshima. During World War II students in third grade or older were evacuated to another school in the suburbs in April 1945. A few months later, on August 6, 1945, about 400 students and more than 10 teachers were killed by the atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima. In February 1946 the school reopened with 45 students with 4 teachers, but they didn't have any school supplies and the building still hadn't been fully repaired. In 1947 Reverend Arthur Powell Davies encouraged his congregation at the All Souls Church to donate half a ton of school supplies to Honkawa Elementary school. The students drew pictures in thanks, and sent them to the All Souls Church. In June 1947 the school was renamed as Hiroshima City Honkawa Elementary School. In 1950 it was designated as the \\"School of the Peace Memorial City\\" by the Ministry of Education. The new school building was built and part of the old building was opened as the Peace Museum in April 1988. A memorial for the atomic bomb victims was built in November 1998. The total number of visitors for the museum reached 100,000 in September 1998. A collection of the stories about the atomic bomb, Negai was written in March 2005. Students participated in the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Ceremony and performed the Commitment to Peace as the Children's representatives on August 6, 2005.

In 1986, Kelly attended the IRA Army Convention where the main topic of discussion was the principle of abstentionism. Gerry Adams and others argued that the abstentionist rule should be dropped and the Provisional movement should become involved in constitutional politics. Kelly voted against dropping the rule, and a rift with the majority of the IRA Army Council ensued.

It was a more orderly style of painting in reaction to Les Automatistes In 1954, a young critic and painter newly returned from Paris, , reviewed an exhibition of four young artists whom he called Les Plasticiens. The name itself expressed their exclusive concern with the abstract properties of painting. They focused on colors, lines, contrast; completely rejecting the idea of Surrealism and their attachment to the idealism of the European Constructivist movement. He pointed out the difference of their approach from automatism. In his criticism he wrote: > Every painting must have its own particular form to make a totality, > resistant to and not assimilated by an ambiance and where each part depends > on the whole and vice-versa. The movement was launched in 1955 by the Manifeste des plasticiens, written by de Repentigny (under the name Jauran) and signed by , and Fernand Toupin. In the manifesto they acknowledged a kind of debt to the Automatists, recognizing their place in the revolutions that had helped to free the arts from ‚Äúservitude to a materialistic ritual‚Äù. They also called on artists to follow the example of Piet Mondrian. The Plasticiens sought to objectify paintings instead of paint objects. For example, Toupin shaped his own canvases into geometric shapes so that they would be objects of another kind.Gagnon, Fran√ßois-Marc. \\"Plasticiens, Les.\\" In Grove Art Online.

This episode is based on the novel of the same name by Bernard Cornwell. Plot In 1813, a band of deserters, British, French, and others, led by Sharpe's nemesis Obadiah Hakeswill (Pete Postlethwaite) and a French renegade named Pot-au-Feu (Tony Haygarth), takes over a Portuguese village. Lady Isabella (Elizabeth Hurley), the wife of Sir Augustus Farthingdale (Jeremy Child), the English military envoy to Portugal, is taken captive. The brigands demand a ransom for her and for another lady taken earlier, Sarah (Helena Michell), the spouse of French Colonel Dubreton (Fran√ßois Gu√©tary). Sharpe delivers the money for Lady Isabella, while Dubreton does the same for his wife. Sarah mysteriously recites a verse of poetry. Hakeswill demands double the amount and gives each man five days to deliver the second installment. When Sharpe returns to camp, Wellington (Hugh Fraser), the British commander, decides that drastic action is required to discourage desertion before it can infect the rest of his army. Sharpe also reports seeing a Major Ducos (F√©odor Atkine), who accompanied Dubreton. This worries Major Nairn (Michael Byrne), the head of Wellington's military intelligence. He suspects that Ducos, his French counterpart, is scouting the route for a French invasion of Portugal. The village happens to be directly in the most likely path. Sarah's poem\\"Eloisa to Abelard\\" by Alexander Pope, with full text here. conceals a clue to the captives' whereabouts. Sharpe comes up with a risky plan to rescue the women. When Farthingdale objects by quoting regulations that a major must lead a detachment of this size, Wellington presents him with a letter from the Prince Regent, who has followed Sharpe's exploits with admiration, promoting Sharpe to major. Sharpe then sneaks into the village with Sergeant Harper (Daragh O'Malley) and his \\"chosen men\\" on Christmas Eve, when the enemy is drunk and distracted, and frees the captives. While they wait for Captain William Frederickson (Philip Whitchurch) to bring up his company of the 60th Rifles, it is revealed that Lady Isabella had been a prostitute, and at one time Sharpe's lover. With time on their hands, they resume their sexual relationship. The battle goes almost as planned. The deserters are killed or captured, except for Hakeswill, who escapes. He runs into Sharpe's wife Teresa (Assumpta Serna), who had been scouting the approaching French force. Hakeswill kills her, but is then caught by Dubreton, who hands him over to Sharpe. Ducos delivers an ultimatum, demanding the surrender of the village. Sharpe refuses. When Farthingdale tries to negotiate, Sharpe stops him by threatening to reveal Isabella's past to the Lisbon court. The French attack, outnumbering the British 10 to 1, but fall into Sharpe's trap and are repulsed with rocket artillery. Afterwards, Hakeswill is executed by firing squad.

Perhaps the highest of these was the state funeral held at St Paul's Cathedral, after his body had lain in state for three days in Westminster Hall,Picknett, et al., p. 252. an honour rarely granted to anyone other than a British monarch or consort. Queen Elizabeth also broke protocol by giving precedence to a subject, arriving at the cathedral ahead of Churchill's coffin. https://www.history.com/news/winston-churchills- funeral-50-years-ago The funeral also saw one of the largest assemblages of statesmen in the world. Throughout his life, Churchill also accumulated other honours and awards. He was awarded 37 other orders and medals between 1885 and 1964. Of the orders, decorations and medals Churchill received, 20 were awarded by the United Kingdom, three by France, two each by Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg and Spain, and one each by the Czech Republic, Egypt, Estonia, Libya, Nepal, the Netherlands, Norway, and the United States. Ten were awarded for active service as a British Army officer in Cuba, India, Egypt, South Africa, the United Kingdom, France, and Belgium. The greater number of awards were given in recognition of his service as a minister of the British government. Coat of arms Coat of Arms of Winston Churchill as a Gentleman Coat of arms of Sir Winston Spencer-Churchill Churchill was not a peer, never held a title of nobility, and remained a commoner all his life. As the grandson of 7th Duke of Marlborough, he bore the quartered coat of arms of the Spencer and Churchill families. Paul Courtenay observes that \\"It would be normal in these circumstances for the paternal arms (Spencer) to take precedence over the maternal (Churchill), but because the Marlborough dukedom was senior to the Sunderland earldom, the procedure was reversed in this case.\\" In 1817 an augmentation of honour was granted commemorating the victory of Blenheim by the 1st Duke.Paul Courtenay, The Armorial Bearings of Sir Winston Churchill The Armorial Bearings of Sir Winston Churchill (accessed 20 July 2013). As Churchill's father, Lord Randolph Churchill, was the surviving second son of the 7th Duke of Marlborough, his arms should have been differenced, by strict heraldic rules, with a mark of cadency. Traditionally, this would have been a heraldic crescent. Those differenced arms would have been inherited by Winston Churchill. This never seems to have been used by Lord Randolph or Winston. As arms are used to differentiate two bearers, there doesn't seem to have been any confusion between Churchill's arms as a gentleman with many decorations and later Knight of the Garter, those of his brother as a plain gentleman, and his cousin, the Duke of Marlborough, which were adorned with the insignia of a duke. As a Knight of the Garter, Churchill was also entitled to supporters in his achievement. But, he never seems to have got around to applying for them.Paul Courtenay, The Armorial Bearings of Sir Winston Churchill The Armorial Bearings of Sir Winston Churchill (accessed 02 February 2018). The resulting heraldic achievement is: quarterly 1st and 4th, Sable a lion rampant Argent on a canton of the second a cross Gules (Churchill); 2nd and 3rd, quarterly Argent and Gules, in the second and third quarters a fret Or, over all on a bend Sable three escallops of the first (Spencer); in chief, on an escutcheon Argent a cross Gules surmounted by an inescutcheon Azure charged with three fleurs-de-lys Or. When he became a Knight of the Garter in 1953, his arms were encircled by the garter of the order, and at the same time the helms were made open, which is the mark of a knight. His motto was that of the Dukes of Marlborough, Fiel pero desdichado (Spanish for \\"Faithful but unfortunate\\").Robson, Thomas, The British Herald, or Cabinet of Armorial Bearings of the Nobility & Gentry of Great Britain & Ireland, Volume I, Turner & Marwood, Sunderland, 1830, p. 401 (CHU-CLA). Honorary citizen On 9 April 1963, United States President John F. Kennedy, acting under authorization granted by an Act of Congress, proclaimed Churchill the first honorary citizen of the United States. Churchill was physically incapable of attending the White House ceremony, so his son and grandson accepted the award for him. He had previously been made an honorary citizen of the City of Paris on 12 November 1944 while visiting the city following the liberation. During the ceremony at the Hotel de Ville he received the Nazi flag that once flew from the Hotel de Ville. Proposed dukedoms In 1945, King George VI offered Churchill to make him the Duke of Dover ‚Äì the first non-royal dukedom to be created since 1874 ‚Äì as well to become a Knight of the Garter; however, Churchill turned down both.Finest Hour, Number 57, Autumn 1987 ‚Äì quarterly journal of the International Churchill SocietyTheir Noble Lordship ‚Äì website archive.org Since 1900, only members of the British royal family have been made dukes, so the offer was exceptional.The Orders, Decorations and Medals of Sir Winston Churchill by Douglas Russell In 1955, after retiring as prime minister, Churchill was offered again by Queen Elizabeth II for elevation to the peerage in the rank of duke. By custom, prime ministers retiring from the Commons were usually offered earldoms, so a dukedom was a sign of special honour. One title that was considered was Duke of London, a city whose name had never been used in a peerage title. Churchill had represented divisions of three different counties in Parliament, and his home, Chartwell, was in a fourth, so the city in which he had spent most of his time during fifty years in politics was seen as a suitable choice. Churchill considered accepting the offer of a dukedom but eventually declined it; the lifestyle of a duke would have been expensive, and accepting any peerage might have cut short a renewed career in the Commons for his son Randolph and in due course might also prevent one for his grandson Winston. (At the time there was no procedure for disclaiming a title; the procedure was first established by the Peerage Act 1963. Upon inheriting a peerage, either Randolph or Winston would immediately be unseated from the House of Commons). In the event, Randolph never sat in Parliament after losing his only seat there in 1945 and indeed was to die only three years after his father, so the dukedom would have had no effect on his career. Randolph's oldest son Winston did serve in the Commons from 1970 until 1997, but by that time provision existed for disclaiming a hereditary peerage.

On 4 April 1939, Churchill was made an Honorary Air Commodore of No. 615 (County of Surrey) Squadron (\\"Churchill's Own\\") in the Auxiliary Air Force. In March 1943, the Air Council awarded Churchill honorary wings. He retained the appointment until 11 March 1957 when 615 Squadron was disbanded. He did however continue to hold the rank of Honorary Air Commodore. He frequently wore his uniform as an Air Commodore during World War II.

He was also Honorary Colonel of the Queen's Own Oxfordshire Hussars. From 1941 to his death, he was the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, a ceremonial office. In 1941 Canadian Governor General Alexander Cambridge, Earl of Athlone, swore him into the King's Privy Council for Canada. Although this allowed him to use the honorific title The Honourable and the post-nominal letters PC, both of these were trumped by his membership in the Imperial Privy Council which allowed him the use of The Right Honourable. He was also appointed Grand Seigneur of the Hudson's Bay Company in December 1955. In 1945, he was mentioned by Halvdan Koht among seven candidates that were qualified for the Nobel Peace Prize. However, he did not explicitly nominate any of them. Actually he nominated Cordell Hull. On July 4, 1947 Churchill was admitted as an hereditary member of the Connecticut Society of the Cincinnati. He was presented with his insignia and diploma when he visited Washington, D.C. on January 16, 1952.https://www.societyofthecincinnati.org/collections/featured/churchill Churchill held the office of Deputy Lieutenant (DL) of Kent in 1949. In 1953, he was awarded two major honours: he was invested as a Knight of the Garter (becoming Sir Winston Churchill, KG) and he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature \\"for his mastery of historical and biographical description as well as for brilliant oratory in defending exalted human values\\". He was Chancellor of the University of Bristol as well as in 1959, Father of the House, the MP with the longest continuous service. In 1956, Churchill received the Karlspreis (known in English as the Charlemagne Award), an award by the German city of Aachen to those who most contribute to the European idea, and European peace. In 1961 the Chartered Institute of BuildingCIOB named Churchill as an Honorary Fellow for his services and passion for the construction industry. In 1964, Civitan International presented Churchill its first World Citizenship Award for service to the world community. Churchill was also appointed a Kentucky Colonel. When Churchill was 88 he was asked by the Duke of Edinburgh how he would like to be remembered. He replied with a scholarship like the Rhodes scholarship but for the wider masses. After his death, the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust was established in the United Kingdom and Australia. A Churchill Trust Memorial Day was held in Australia, raising $4.3 million. Since that time the Churchill Trust in Australia has supported over 3,000 scholarship recipients in a diverse variety of fields, where merit, either on the basis of past experience, or potential, and the propensity to contribute to the community have been the only criteria.

Numerous buildings and squares have also been named in his honour. The most prominent example of a statue of Churchill is the official statue commissioned by the government and created by Ivor Roberts-Jones which now stands in Parliament Square. It was unveiled by Churchill's widow, Lady Churchill, on 1 November 1973, and was Grade II listed in 2008. Another Roberts-Jones statue of Churchill displaying the V sign is prominently placed in New Orleans (1977). In June 2020 when anti-racism protests occurred in the United Kingdom during the George Floyd protests, the statue of Sir Winston Churchill located in Parliament Square was vandalised when a protestor painted graffiti on the statue reading ‚Äúwas a racist‚Äù underneath Churchill‚Äôs name which was crossed out by the same vandal which wrote the sentence. A couple of days after this event took place the statue was cleaned and it did not sustain any permanent damage.

History The track opened on April 27, 1903, a day which featured the inaugural running of the Excelsior Handicap. Eugene D. Wood, one of the founders and largest stockholder, served as its first president. Upon Wood's death in April 1924, Dr. Edward P. Kilroe was appointed president to replace him. The Wood Memorial Stakes is named in Eugene Wood's honor. Legendary Hall of Fame horse trainer Sunny Jim Fitzsimmons was the first to train at Jamaica Race Course and Native Dancer made a winning debut here on April 19, 1952. The facility's attendance record of 64,679 was set on Memorial Day, 1945. It was home to ongoing races such as the Prioress Stakes, Frizette Stakes, Paumonok Handicap, Excelsior Handicap, Wood Memorial Stakes, Remsen Handicap, Bed O' Roses Handicap, and the Jamaica Handicap. In 1955, the Greater New York Association took over management of Jamaica Race Course along with Aqueduct Racetrack, Belmont Park, and Saratoga Race Course and decided to undertake renovations to Aqueduct in South Ozone Park, the other track in the Greater Jamaica area. Jamaica took on the Big A dates during Aqueduct's four year renovation, after which it would be sold for redevelopment as a housing project. With Aqueduct slated to reopen in the fall of 1959, Jamaica ceased operations on August 1 and was torn down the following year. Today the Rochdale Village housing development occupies the former site of Jamaica Race Course. The racetrack was served by the adjacent Locust Manor station on the Long Island Rail Road.

Idaho Commission for Libraries. 4 April 2007. http://libraries.idaho.gov. History of the Idaho Commission for Libraries Early in its statehood, stagecoaches delivered traveling libraries to Idaho settlements, mining camps, and outposts. The wooden boxes contained volumes for every age and every interest. The \\"Traveling Library,\\" the precursor to the Idaho Commission for Libraries, was formed by the Columbian Club of Boise in 1899. The 1901 Idaho Legislative Session created the State Library with an annual operating budget of $3,000. Charged with organizing new libraries and improving existing ones, Idaho took pride in its State Library services. The traveling library brought a civilizing and educational force to 51 settlements - including large towns like Boise, Moscow, and Pocatello and small ones like Preston, St. Anthony, and Salmon. By 1904, 100 communities were receiving books. By the 1920s, every major city in Idaho and many smaller communities boasted a library. Ten of those were built with Carnegie grants. These grants required local community support, much like private and federal library grants of today. The State Library continued to deposit collections of books throughout the state. In the 1930s, continuing education to improve local library services began and continues to be in demand. In 1957, the Idaho Legislature more than doubled the State Library's budget, allowing the agency to receive federal grants under the Library Services Act. With these monies, local libraries demonstrated innovative services such as bookmobiles and children's story times. These early grants were the precursors of the Library Services and Technology Act funds administered by the Commission for Libraries in Idaho today. After the Library Services Act was revamped in 1964, federal dollars also went toward library buildings - the final construction grant was awarded in 1998. In 1973, the Talking Book Library began to serve people whose disabilities made it difficult to use printed materials. Today, special machines and recorded books are sent statewide to provide recreational reading materials to thousands of patrons. In the mid-seventies, the State Library ushered in computer technology by awarding library automation grants. That legacy continues today through the Libraries Linking Idaho Network (LiLI). The network hosts the popular LiLI databases and statewide resource sharing catalog, paid for by state dollars. Plans for LiLI include the development of more statewide networking activities. Effective July 1, 2006 the Idaho State Library changed its name to the Idaho Commission for Libraries and the Board of Trustees was renamed the Board of Library Commissioners.  LiLI (Libraries Linking Idaho)  Libraries Linking Idaho (LiLI) is an alliance of libraries and library consortia working together on projects and services that bring networked library services to the citizens of Idaho. In 1998, the Idaho Commission for Libraries contracted with Himmel & Wilson Consultants to conduct a feasibility study on creating a formal network of Idaho libraries. Upon implementing some of the recommendations, LiLI was born. An advisory board consisting of Idaho school, public and academic library leaders was put into place. The first phase of the LiLI project was the development of the LiLI Web site to provide information about Idaho and Idaho libraries, provide links to information sources for Idaho citizens, and provide access to Idaho library home pages and online public access catalogs. The LiLI website, which was unveiled in October 1997, continues to be a central point of communication about LiLI programs and services. In 1998 the Idaho State Legislature passed funding for statewide access to online databases. The LiLI Databases (LiLI-D) are available to all Idaho citizens.

They are commonly known as microcaddisflies or purse-case caddisflies, in reference to two characteristic traits of this family: Hydroptilidae are much smaller than other caddisflies, rarely exceeding in length. Their larvae do not build a protective case until the final instar of their growth. At that time however, they build a typically Purse-shaped case, either portable or stuck to the substrate, in which the larva finishes growth and pupates. Systematics and taxonomy Their systematic placement among the caddisflies is still disputed. They are traditionally placed in the suborder Spicipalpia, which do not seem to be a natural monophyletic group, but rather an evolutionary grade of moderately advanced caddisflies. Some authors downrank the Spicipalpia to a superfamily of the more basal Annulipalpia and call them Rhyacophiloidea (which otherwise refers to a subfamily of suborder Spicipalpia), but recent studies generally rejected this view. More often, the Hydroptilidae are placed in a monotypic superfamily Hydroptiloidea, either in the Spicipalpia or - probably more appropriately considering the present state of caddisfly phylogeny ‚Äì incertae sedis in the Trichoptera. It may be that the Glossosomatoidea are particularly closely related to the Hydroptilidae; together they might even be closer to the most advanced caddisflies (the tube case caddisflies, Integripalpia) than any other living caddisfly. But this view is almost as disputed as including the Spicipalpia in the Annulipalpia. In any case, were Glossosomatoidea and Hydroptiloidea to be merged into a single superfamily, the older name Hydroptiloidea would apply for the combined group. The peculiarly apomorphic genera Palaeagapetus and Ptilocolepus have been separated as subfamily Ptilocolepinae, while all other genera form the Hydroptilinae family with its multiple tribes. It is far from certain that the Ptilocolepinae are the living fossils such an arrangement would imply them to be.

Early life and career Jona went to school at the Scotch College, Melbourne before studying medicine at the University of Melbourne in 1944, and before he went to Scotch College Melbourne he went to Glenferrie Primary School. After spending 1945 in the Royal Australian Air Force, Jona returned to his medical course, but found his passion for politics after taking some politics units. This lead Jona to joining the Melbourne University Liberal Club and becoming active within the Liberal Party in his local area.Walter Jona (2006), People, Parliament and Politics, Tertiary Press, Melbourne, pp. 58-60 Jona was also active in many other groups including the Melbourne Apex Club, Melbourne Junior Chamber of Commerce and in 1958 he became President of the Victorian Association of Jewish Ex-Servicemen. Political career In the lead up to the 1964 state election, Peter Garrisson, the Liberal member for Jona's local seat of Hawthorn was disendorsed because he was charged under the Companies Act. Jona won a hotly contested preselection against ten other candidates, and went on to win the seat despite challenges from Garrisson and from Labor (at the time, the seat of Hawthorn included parts of working class Richmond, making it less secure for the Liberals than today). Jona served as the Chairman of a Select Committee on Road Safety between 1967 and 1973.Crown Content Who's Who in Australia 2007 page 1108 This committee recommended the mandatory wearing of seatbelts in 1971, which was a world first. From 1973 to 1976 Jona served as Parliamentary Secretary to cabinet before being promoted by Premier Rupert Hamer to be Victoria's first Ethnic Affairs Minister. From 1979 until the Liberals' defeat at the 1982 election, Jona served as Minister for Community Welfare Services. He also served as shadow Education Minister until his retirement in 1985. Like many Liberal Party politicians from Victoria, Jona's political views were considered to be small-l liberal.

The tell of Belo Brdo ('White Hill') is almost entirely made up of the remains of human settlement, and was occupied several times from the Early Neolithic (c. 5700 BCE) through to the Medieval period. The most substantial archaeological deposits are from the Neolithic-Eneolithic Vinƒça culture, of which Vinƒça-Belo Brdo is the type site. Geography Vinƒça is situated on the right bank of the Danube, 14 km downstream from Belgrade, on a high loess terrace. This location was attractive to its Neolithic settlers: the Danube on one side provided water and fishing while on the other the valley of the river Bolecica connected it to a hinterland rich in minerals, ores, hunting grounds and fertile agricultural soils. Belo Brdo is one of the largest tell sites in the Balkans, covering 10 hectares of land with 9 metres of cultural deposits and a total height of 10.5 metres... Excavations Information signboard on closed Vinƒça-Belo Brdo archeological site, 2011 Archaeological site after landslide in 2011 The first archaeological excavations at Vinƒça were carried out by prominent Serbian archaeologist Miloje Vasiƒá starting in 1908. These were interrupted by the outbreak of World War I and, apart from a brief season in 1924, Vasiƒá was unable to obtain the necessary funding to continue working on the site from the impoverished postwar Yugoslav government. However, with the financial backing of British businessman and archaeologist Sir Charles Hyde, Vasiƒá was able to resume excavations, on a much larger scale, between 1929 and 1931. These piqued the interest of the British press and the site was subsequently visited by several prominent intellectuals of the time, including Hyde, John Myres, Veselin ƒåajkanoviƒá, W. A. Hurtley and Bogdan Popoviƒá. Finds from these excavations are now in several UK museums including the Ashmolean Museum and the British Museum.British Museum Collection New excavations were begun in 1978 under the auspices of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts. From 1978 to 1982 the project focused on the Bronze Age and later layers, under the direction of Nikola Tasic and Gordana Vujovic. In 1982 excavations began on the more prominent Neolithic occupation, investigation of which continues to the present, led by Milutin Garasanin and Dragoslav Srejovic. Unfortunately in the 47 years between Vasiƒá's and the present research the site suffered considerable damage from unauthorized excavations and looting. Occupation =Starƒçevo period, c. 5700‚Äì5300 BCE= The earliest deposits at Belo Brdo date to around 5700 BCE. and belong to the Early Neolithic Starƒçevo culture. Evidence for this phase of occupation is scant owing to the disruption of the later Vinƒça settlement, and consists mainly of one large grave containing the remains of eleven males. This collective burial is unusual for Starƒçevo sites, where individual inhumations are the norm. Otherwise the Starƒçevo finds at Belo Brdo are unremarkable, and it is only one of several contemporary Starƒçevo settlements in the vicinity of modern Belgrade.. =Vinƒça period, c. 5200‚Äì4900 BCE= A clay figurine from Vinƒça- Belo Brdo on display at the British Museum.British Museum Collection A century after the abandonment. of the Starƒçevo settlement Belo Brdo was occupied by people of the Vinƒça culture. A total of thirteen building horizons from this period make up the majority of the tell's stratigraphy, as new buildings were constructed on the debris left by periodic fires.. Belo Brdo was a major Vinƒça centre and, at its peak, one of the largest settlements in Neolithic Europe. However, it was abandoned by 4900 BCE, some five centuries before the wider collapse of the Vinƒça culture... As in the earlier Starƒçevo occupation, the Vinƒça houses at Belo Brdo were constructed primarily from wood and clay, but they also made use of levelled foundations, insulation and decoration with paint and wall coverings. In later phases large (40 x 60 m2) rectangular buildings with internal divisions and fixed furniture (benches, braziers, waterwheels, tables, etc.) appeared alongside the predominant one-roomed dwellings. The Vinƒça settlement was arranged on straight streets, fenced and considerably larger than that of the Starƒçevo period. The inhabitants' subsisted based both on the cultivation of grains (einkorn, emmer and barley) and husbandry of domesticated animals (primarily cattle, but also goats, sheep and pigs). These agricultural practices probably continued to be supplemented by hunting and fishing in the surrounding environs. In the Early Vinƒça phase Belo Brdo seems to have developed into a ritual centre for the entire region. The manufacture of various types of cult objects, including 'mushroom amulet' and 'animal head' jewellery made from semi-precious stones, first appeared there and then spread to other Vinƒça sites. The raw material for these objects often had to be imported from considerable distance, indicating also that from its earliest phase the site was part of large-scale exchange networks.. It is therefore thought that Belo Brdo was a key place in a wider Vinƒça prestige economy, and an abundance of ritual paraphernalia, especially anthropomorphic figurines, is characteristic of the site. Another ritual innovation of Early Vinƒça phase Belo Brdo was the bucranium cult, where the painted skulls of cattle were fixed to the interior of houses. It is speculated that this practice may be linked to the wealth of individual households as measured in cattle. Later, however, Belo Brdo was to some degree eclipsed by the nearby site of Vr≈°ac, which became the centre of the much more widespread exchange of ornaments made from Spondylus shells.. Subsequently, in the Late Vinƒça phase figurines became less widely circulated, and at the same time more standardised in form (in contrast to the many idiosyncratic styles of the Early Vinƒça phase). They also began to be inscribed with Vinƒça symbols, which perhaps indicates that competition and conflict was arising between different groups within Belo Brdo trying to assert control over the flow of ritual goods. =Post-Vinƒça occupations= Belo Brdo has been occupied several times since the abandonment of the Vinƒça settlement, but not on the same scale. From the Copper Age there are four graves belonging to the Bodrogkereszt√∫r culture, a very small Baden culture settlement and some evidence of visits by people of the Kostolac culture. There was a large but short-lived Bronze Age settlement belonging to the Vatin culture. In the Iron Age the size of the tell made it an attractive location for a significant Celtic hill fort complete with defensive earthworks.. The most recent historical use of the site was a substantial Old Serbian necropolis. Tourism Vinƒça-Belo Brdo is classified as an Archaeological Site of Exceptional Importance by the Serbian government, entitling it to the highest level of state protection. Artefacts from the site are on display in exhibitions at the archaeological park, the National Museum of Belgrade, the Belgrade City Museum and the University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy. Currently, the entire Vinƒça archeological site is closed for tourists and protected with a thick layer of sand due to the landslide problems.

Firestone Vineyard is one of the wineries along the famous Foxen Canyon Wine Trail. History Firestone Vineyard was founded by members of the Firestone family in 1972, as Santa Barbara County's first estate winery. The winery was designed by Richard Keith & Associates, architects. The winery is located in the heart of the rural Santa Ynez Valley near the town of Los Olivos in Santa Barbara County. It includes a barrel cellar, fermentation cellar, crush pad, tasting room and bottling line for full production from the vine to the bottle. The winery is surrounded by of estate vineyards. In early 2007, Firestone Vineyard opened a companion winery in Paso Robles, with a focus on small lots of Bordeaux varietals from select local vineyards. William P. Foley acquired Firestone Winery and surrounding of land (300 acres under vine) in early August 2007 as part of a plan to expand his portfolio of small specialty wineries up and down the western coast (he owns Foley Winery in the Sta. Rita Hills). As part of an evolving brokering of the deal, the Paso Robles facility - initially planned to stay in Firestone hands - was also purchased by Foley. Firestone Walker Brewing and Curtis Winery, will remain in the hands of the Firestone family. Curtis Winery focuses on Rh√¥ne wines from Ambassador's and Crossroads vineyards (Firestone family owned, and retained in the deal) and Voglezang vineyard (independently owned). As of July 2008, William Foley II remains the proprietor of Firestone Vineyard. Currently, Lorna Kreutz is the Director of winemaking and Daniel Spratling is the Associate winemaker. Climate Vineyards in the Santa Ynez Valley benefit from the unique east-to-west orientation of the surrounding mountain ranges which extends the growing season and encourages the development of balanced and flavorful grapes. Firestone Vineyards estate vineyards have an alternating climate of warm afternoons followed by cooler coastal evenings. Temperature swings of up to 50 degrees are normal during the summer growing season which results in a long growing season. The estate vineyards soil is composed of gravelly loam with rocky subsoils. Well-draining soils are ideal for winegrowing. Paso Robles Winery The Firestone Paso Robles winery focuses on small lots of Paso Robles-grown Bordeaux, including Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. The winery is located at the corner of Highway 46 East and Airport Road near downtown Paso Robles and features a tasting room, barrel cellar, enclosed patio, estate vineyard and terraced gardens with picnic accommodations. Initial production is 4,000 cases annually. Firestone Vineyard Paso Robles, was opened in early 2007. Firestone Vineyard purchased Paso Robles fruit for several vintages, and the quality of the resulting wines was enough to make the decision to establish a new winery. Firestone Vineyards affiliated company Firestone Walker Brewing Company relocated its brewing operations to Paso Robles in 2001. The Paso Robles winery is managed by Andrew Firestone. Paso Robles resides inland from the coast between Los Angeles and San Francisco in northern San Luis Obispo County. The coastline is bordered by the Santa Lucia Mountains, which trap heat during the daytime. In the evening coastal air moves through the Templeton Gap. This climate pattern is ideal for Bordeaux production. Estates Firestone Vineyard also manages a collection of estates on California's Central Coast. *Curtis Winery: Founded in 1995, Curtis Winery is a small winery which produces Rh√¥ne-style wines.

He began riding longer races, including time-trials that lasted 12 hours. \\"I really was a novice, a greenhorn who knew nothing, but in my first season I progressed to being club champ and winning some good time-trials,\\" he said. He broke the Road Records Association 50-mile record in 1928.(ref RRA General Secretary) Olympic Games Lauterwasser was picked for the 1928 Olympic Games in Amsterdam and cycled there from London. He won a silver medal in the 160 km road race event at the Amsterdam Olympics. The race was run against the clock as an individual time trial, a British speciality, with riders starting at two-minute intervals. Lauterwasser finished fifth in 5h 2m 57s.

He later became a Minister for Foreign Affairs in Ghana's second republic between 1971 and 1972. Early life Nana William Ofori Atta was the son of Nana Sir Ofori Atta I who was the Omanhene (King) of Akyem Abuakwa between 1912 and 1943. He was thus a nobleman of royal lineage of the Ofori-Atta dynasty, although the fact that the Akan people (to which he belonged) are traditionally matrilineal meant that he was not a dynastic prince. William Ofori Atta attended Mfantsipim School, but was withdrawn to Achimota School where he was among the first batch of students to sit for the Cambridge School Certificate. Some of his school mates included Komla Agbeli Gbedemah and Edward Akufo-Addo. His batch of students also pioneered the intermediate degree programs.

She was the lover of many notable members of society, and socialised with many others. In 1722 she stabbed and wounded a client, the politician John Finch, who was a son of Daniel Finch, 2nd Earl of Nottingham and Anne Finch, Countess of Nottingham. As a result, Salisbury was sentenced to one year's imprisonment. She was sent to Newgate Prison to serve her sentence but died in prison after only nine months. Biography She was born around 1690‚Äì1692 and given the name Sarah Pridden. Her father was a bricklayer. At the age of nine, Salisbury was apprenticed to a seamstress in Aldgate. After losing a valuable piece of lace, Salisbury ran away and took to life on the streets of the slum district of St Giles. Here she turned to various forms of street trading. She became well known in London as \\"the beautiful little wench who sells pamphlets to the schoolboys and apprentices...in Pope's Head Alley in the City of London\\". Her pamphlet sales were merely a sideline to her more lucrative trade, charging the boys half a crown for an hour of her time. The notorious rake Colonel Francis Charteris made her his mistress, but abandoned her c. 1704, when she was 14 years old. Following her abandonment, Salisbury was taken in by the bawd, Mother Wisebourne, whose house in Covent Garden was among the most exclusive and expensive brothels of the time. She adopted the surname Salisbury from the name of one of her lovers. After Wisebourne's death, Salisbury moved on to the house of Mother Needham in Park Place. =Celebrity prostitute= Salisbury was celebrated for her beauty and wit, and consequently attracted many aristocratic customers. The Secretary of State for the Northern Department (1710-1713) and Secretary of State for the Southern Department (1713-1714), Viscount Bolingbroke was a great admirer of Salisbury, willing to pay \\"the highest price for the greatest pleasure\\". She boasted that she had \\"at least half a score\\" of lords as clients. The Duke of Richmond, the poet and diplomat Matthew Prior, and Nell Gwyn's son, the Duke of St Albans all patronised her, and even the future George II was rumoured to have been amongst her lovers. She spent time in Marshalsea and Bridewell prisons for minor offences and debt. After a riot at Wisebourne's house in 1713, Salisbury was sent to Newgate Prison. She was released by Judge Blagney, who had become infatuated with her. =Stabbing= 18th century illustration of Salisbury stabbing Finch. The stabbing took place as the result of an argument over some opera tickets that a customer had given to Sally's sister instead of Sally. The customer was the politician John Finch, a son of Daniel Finch, 2nd Earl of Nottingham and Anne Finch, Countess of Nottingham. Finch was also a brother to Daniel Finch, 8th Earl of Winchilsea. During the argument in the Three Tuns Tavern in Chandos Street, Covent Garden, Finch and Salisbury both became angry. Salisbury snatched up the knife she had been given with her meal and stabbed Finch in the chest. She was apparently immediately remorseful, and called for a surgeon to attend Finch. Finch was gravely ill for some time, but forgave Salisbury on the spot. When he later recovered, he wished to visit her in prison to reiterate his forgiveness. The incident was the talk of the town, as Salisbury was a celebrity in London and her every move was reported. Lady Mary Wortley Montagu wrote to Lady Frances Pierrepont, the exiled Countess of Mar (wife of John Erskine, Earl of Mar) in Paris of the gossip a few days after the event: =Trial and imprisonment= Salisbury was charged with violent assault and tried at the Old Bailey on 24 April 1723. Her lawyer claimed that the act had not been premeditated, and that Mr. Finch's forgiveness should count in her favour. The defence also tried to argue that Sally had acted to defend her sister from Mr. Finch's dishonorable amorous intentions, rather than from jealousy.Rosenthal, Laura J. \\"The Whore's Estate: Sally Salisbury, Prostitution, and Property in Eighteenth-Century London\\". Women, Property and the Letters of the Law in Early Modern England. Ed. Margaret W. Ferguson, Nancy E. Wright, A. R. Buck. University of Toronto Press, 2004. pg 100. The prosecution mocked her reputation and claimed that Finch's forgiveness showed only his amiable character and offered nothing in the way of mitigation. The jury found her guilty of assaulting and wounding Finch, but acquitted her of intent to murder. She was sentenced to pay a fine of 100 pounds, a year's imprisonment, and to find sureties for her behaviour for two years. Salisbury's esteemed patrons did not abandon her: she received visitors while in prison and awaiting trial. The courtroom was packed with notables of London society during the trial. After she was taken to Newgate, she continued to receive visitors, who brought her luxury goods and made sure that she was comfortable during her imprisonment. After serving nine months of her sentence, she died of \\"brain fever brought on by debauch\\", almost certainly syphilis, and was buried in the churchyard of St Andrew Holborn. Legacy She was the subject of a number of biographies, among them the anonymous The Genuine History of Mrs. Sarah Pridden, usually called Sally Salisbury, and Her Gallants, and Captain Charles Walker's Authentic Memoirs of the Life, Intrigues and Adventures of the Celebrated Sally Salisbury, both from 1723, as well as receiving mention in C√©sar de Saussure's A Foreign View of England. She is a possible inspiration for the harlot Moll Hackabout, in William Hogarth's A Harlot's Progress: her lover Charteris features in the series and, like Moll, Salisbury had spent time in Bridewell. She was thought to be the satirical subject of the song Sally in Our Alley until the author, Henry Carey, claimed he had not heard of her when he wrote it.

Meath The Boyne Navigation () is a series of canals running 31 km (19 mi) roughly parallel to the River Boyne from Oldbridge to Navan in County Meath, in Ireland. The navigation was once used by horse-drawn boats travelling between Navan, Slane and the port of Drogheda; however is now derelict. The Boyne Navigation branch of the Inland Waterways Association of Ireland have an agreement with An Taisce ‚Äì The National Trust for Ireland giving it a license to carry out restoration work on the navigation to return it to a usable waterway. History The Boyne Navigation comprises two sections; the Lower Navigation from Drogheda, near mouth of the Boyne, to Slane and the Upper Navigation is from Slane to Navan. The navigation channel is partly the river itself and partly stretches of canal, mostly on the south side of the river. The route uses the river exclusively below Oldbridge while the Upper Navigation is mostly canal. The designers intended that the navigation continue upstream along the Boyne to Trim where it could connect with the Royal Canal. The section from Navan to Trim was never built,http://www.geograph.ie/photo/2517281 and the Boyne Navigation remains disconnected from other inland waterways in Ireland. The Boyne Navigation Company began work on the lower section of the navigation from the sea lock at Oldbridge to Slane in 1748 and was completed in the 1760s. The upper section from Slane to Navan was completed in 1800. The main cargo on the navigation was grain and flour between the mills on the river and the port of Drogheda and coal in the other direction. At four places along the route the towpath switches from one side of the river to the other. Where this happened the horse would step onto the barge while it was poled across to the other side. David Jebb was the engineer in charge of the construction. Jebb himself built a flour mill at Slane in 1766 to take advantage of the navigation that he had recently completed that far. When opened it was the largest mill of its kind in Ireland. A traditional craft used by people on the Boyne was the Boyne c√≥ire√°il (circular currachs). A group called the Boyne Currach Heritage Group was founded in 1997 to build replicas of the original currachs. Economics The navigation was never a commercial success, however it did expand the local economy by making it easier to transport agricultural goods from inland County Meath to market. The total cost to build the navigation was ¬£190,000 (in pounds sterling) of which ¬£30,000 was private contributions the remainder being public funds. In the financial year ending in April 1844 income for the navigation was ¬£734.12s.4d. and expenses were ¬£460.6s.9d (both in pounds, shillings and pence). Navigation Boats with a draught of 1.4 m (4 ft 8 in) in the winter and 1.1 m (3 ft 6 in) in the summer could travel the navigation. Low water in the summer and during low tides meant that the Boyne Navigation was not always navigable. The journey from Drogheda to Slane took 7 hours in summer and 6 hours in the winter. Slane to Navan took 4 hours in the summer and 9 in the winter. In 1847 the toll to travel the lower section was 1¬º d. per ton per mile and 2 d. per ton per mile on the upper section. Boat owners would charge 3 s. per ton to carry freight from Drogheda to Slane and 4 s. 6 d. per ton from Drogheda to Navan. The names of the locks on the Navigation are: Oldbridge section: {Lock 1: Oldbridge Sealock/ Tiernan's Lock, Lock 2: Oldbridge Guard/ Turf Lock,} Staleen section: {Lock 3: Staleen Lower Lock, Lock 4: Staleen Guard Lock,} Broe section: {Lock 5: Broe Lock, Lock 6: Broe Guard Lock,} Slane section: {Lock 7: Morgan's/ Rosnaree Lock, Lock 8: Slane Guard Lock,} Lock 9: Slane Castle Lock, Lock 10: Carrickdexter Lock, Lock 11: Cruicetown Lock, Lock 12: Castlefin Lock, Lock 13: Deer Park Lock, Lock 14: Stackallen Guard Lock, Navan section: {Lock 15: Stackallen Lock, Lock 16: Taffe's Lock, Lock 17: Rowley's Lock, Lock 18: Ruxton's Lock, Lock 19: Metge's Lock (removed, lock and harbour filled in, turned into Andy Brennan's Park now).} Current status The canal passed into private ownership in 1915 and over the next ten years fell into disrepair. An Taisce purchased the navigation rights to the canal from the Navan baker John Spicer & Co. for one Irish pound in 1969. An Taisce also own most of the towpaths and adjoining lands however there is no public access on a section of the Lower Navigation from Rosnaree Lock to Roughgrange. A number of sections of the towpath are maintained as walking paths, particularly the section from Stackallan Bridge to Navan. Metges Lock [Navan] and weir were removed in the 1980 by the OPW as part of a flood relief scheme. Voluntary restoration efforts have mostly been concentrated on the first section of navigation, from the Sealock (Lock 1) to the Guardlock (Lock 2) at Oldbridge (Oldbridge section). The Oldbridge section has reinstated Lockgates. Lockgates for Lock 1 were hand built on the towpath/ grass verge to this lock, of the course of about 4 years. Lockgates for Lock 2 were contracted out to a local joiner (Michael Black, Drogheda). They were installed over he course of a week during May 2017. A silt harbour was also reinstated above Lock 2. Lock 3 was dredged during Summer 2018. Lockgates were been fabricated between the end of 2018 and early 2019. Basic gates were installed at it back in May 2019. The Boyne Navigation section of I.W.A.I. spent the rest of 2019 and early 2020 fitting additional parts to these lockgates to make them functional. Work has been suspended due to the covid-19 illness. A subgroup of The Boyne Navigation section of I.W.A.I. has been established back in roughly 2018. They work on the Navan section of the Boyne Navgation. The carry out work days ever Monday except bank holidays. Their work can be followed on. They have been involved in maintaining the grounds of Lock 17, clearance of fallen trees, maintenance of growth along the Navan section. Other work that has taken place in the recently past: the area above the Guardlock has been dredged, considerable clearance of towpath below Staleen Lower lock (Lock 3), Restoration of stone wall bank which borders the canal above Staleen Lower Lock (Lock 3), clearance of the navigation between Athlumney and Ruxton's Lock (Lock 17). The Oldbridge section is now managed for navigation. The gates at Lock 2 are closed during the Winter (river flooding periods of the year) and can opened during the summer (times of low River Boyne levels). Small boats can effectively travel from Drogheda up as far as Staleen Lock (lock 3). When complete, this will allow passage of boats from Drogheda as far upstream as Staleen Lock. The Staleen section actually passes Newgrange. The announcement of a public mooring at Scotch Hall shopping centre in Drogheda will complement the Boyne Navigation. A grant has been awarded for the construction for the public moorings, as per announcement on local Councillor's (Frank Godfrey's) Facebook page. The mooring is not due to go ahead as funding was around ‚Ç¨100,000 but the cheapest quote was around ‚Ç¨400,000. Official restoration agents carrying out the Voluntary restoration of the Boyne Navigation are the Boyne Navigation section of I.W.A.I. They have agreed to carry such work with the Property owner An Taisce on sections it owner and other property which the Boyne Navigation runs through. They have recently been carrying out the workdays on both ends (Drogheda and Navan) of waterway. The Drogheda group's Facebook presence and the Navan group operates a different Facebook presence. A local Community employment group working under IWAI's Boyne Navigation Branch is currently undertaking works on the Slane section of the navigation. Recent works which have taken place include: removal of thick vegetation growth on the waterway section (during Summer 2014) between Slane Lock (Lock 9) to a little beyond the Bridge that crosses the Boyne Navigation and River Boyne leading to Slane. Sluices were installed in the concrete barriers at Locks 8 and 9 at this section to allow for the rewatering of the waterway section and also allow for the regulation water levels. Once or were funding sourced, it would be hoped for the installation of lockgates at Lock 8 (Morgan's Lock) and Lock 9 (Slane Weir) allowing boat passage from the River Boyne to the other using the Boyne Navigation. A boat would do this by entering the double lock chamber at Lock 8 under the engineering feat of the man-made archway (locally known as the Scabby Archscabby arch) under the stone arch road bridge to Slane up to Lock 9 and back out onto the River Boyne. A local group have established a workgroup to maintain and upkeep the Staleen Guard Lock walkway/ towpath section, between the River Boyne and back down to the Drogheda Waterworks. Boat trips After the commercial feasibility of using the waterway for ferrying trade goods was made redundant with the advent of the train. The Boyne Navigation attracted tourists and tour boats to run trips on its waters. At least two tour boats were known to have operated on the navigation one by the name of Ros na Righ. One of these boats' journeys functioned by having a leading boat with an end, which dragged a boat behind it with its paying travellers. In the 21st century, tour boat activity has been reestablished on the Oldbridge section. One company offering trips is called Boyne Boats. They have been operating for about the last two years. Tourists are offered a trip through the history of the Boyne Valley, while paddling a traditional Irish boat (currach) called a naomh√≥g along the Boyne Navigation - Oldbridge section. This company has offered boat trips above Lock 2 and Lock 8 on the River Boyne, opposite Slane Castle.  Boyne Greenway (officially called Boyneside Trail) A cycle track and walkway (known as the Boyne Greenway/ Boyneside Trail) has been developed along the Oldbridge section of the navigation. It runs between Pass (townsland on the exact border between Meath and Louth to opposite) the entrance of the Battle of the Boyne Centre. Walking routes Walkways in the area include routes from: * Battle of the Boyne Centre to under Br√∫ na B√≥inne Centre walkway * Lock from Slane town to Rossnaree/ Morgan's Lock * Slane Ramparts to Slane Castle * Navan to Stackallen (Broadboyne) Bridge Books featuring the Boyne Navigation  * * See also *Canals of Ireland References External links *An Taisce - Boyne Navigation and Tow Path *Inland Waterways Association of Ireland - Boyne Navigation - I.W.A.I. *Boyne Currach - Group recreating boating method that took place on the Boyne *Navan Historical Society - Boyne Navigation Page *Old pictures of the Boyne Navigation - write by Niall Galway *Ask about Ireland - The River Boyne and Boyne Canal *Info on the restoration efforts of the Boyne Navigation - Written by James Leahy (Pages 14 - 19) Category:Canals in Ireland Category:Inland waterways under restoration Category:Transport in County Meath Category:Canals opened in 1800 ","title":"Boyne Navigation"},{"id":"10455944","text":"SABC Africa was the international television service of the South African Broadcasting Corporation, which ceased to broadcast on 1 August 2008 after poor performance on the DStv satellite television platform.

Chapman's basic requirements for the design were for a car of 1100 lbs powered by an 85 bhp engine and a maximum speed of 125 mph. Work began on this design in late 1953 and Chapman was assisted in the design of the body by the aerodynamicist Frank Costin, who was the brother of Mike Costin, his main collaborator. The spaceframe chassis for the Mark VIII has been described as \\"the most nearly perfect sports car chassis\\". This was Lotus' first true spaceframe and relied on the aircraft experience of Peter Ross and Gilbert McIntosh. Extremely light (the total weight of the frame alone was only 35 lbs) and very stiff, the frame consisted of only nineteen members and was fully triangulated. However, from a practical point of view, the frame had limitations, mostly regarding maintenance; in order to install the engine, it had to be disassembled and then reassembled inside the framework. The spaceframe retained the divided front axle independent suspension that Chapman had employed on his earlier cars, and used a de Dion layout with inboard brakes at the rear. A modified MG 1500 cc engine and transmission were installed, and a stressed undertray further stiffened the chassis. In its first race at Oulton Park, Chapman set the fastest lap of the day in Mark VIII prototype, which was designated P3, but had to retire because of a blown head gasket. However, at the next race at Silverstone Chapman won the 1,500 cc. class outright. It was at a subsequent meeting of the RAC British Grand Prix at Silverstone, on 17 July 1954, where the reputation of Lotus cars was made, as Chapman in the Lotus Mark VIII and Peter Gammon in the Mark VI beat the works quad-cam Porsche driven by Hans Herrmann, again winning the class. The Mark VIII was a precursor to the later aerodynamic Lotus cars.  Mark X  Lotus Mark X The Lotus Mark X was an aluminium-bodied sports racing car manufactured by Lotus Engineering Ltd. The Mark X, of which only 6 or 7 were made, was essentially identical to the Mark VIII but made use of the larger 2.0-litre Bristol engine. The Mark VIII, Mark IX and Mark X were transitional forms, although they represent the first full bodied aerodynamic Lotus sports cars and made use of the De Dion tube as a rear suspension locator, together with inboard rear brakes. The more successful Lotus Eleven, of which 270 were manufactured between 1956 and 1958, was the direct descendant of these earlier cars. The earlier cars are today considered rare and highly valued collectible automobiles ‚Äî even museum pieces ‚Äî but can still be seen raced in vintage events.

In 2018, 3.46 million passengers travelled on the line, a 10% increase from 2017 figures. About It is one of the longest in Ireland at 266 km. The line is utilised by both InterCity and Commuter services. Services to Waterford branch off at Cherryville Junction, after Kildare, and to Westport and Galway after Portarlington. Although there are some direct services to Limerick, most services require a change at either Limerick Junction or Ballybrophy (the latter traveling onward via the Limerick-Ballybrophy railway line). Services to Tralee via Killarney and Farranfore (for Kerry Airport) run from Mallow. Commuter services run on both the South Western Commuter line between Dublin and Kildare or Portlaoise, and Cork Commuter line between Mallow and Cobh. Iarnr√≥d √âireann, the Irish state railway company, has invested heavily in improving the infrastructure and rolling stock. It has had both its track and signalling upgraded in the last few years thanks to funding from the government's National Development Plan - beginning in 1977, the line was upgraded to continuous welded rail, while the introduction of Centralised Traffic Control means that signalling is controlled from a single location at Dublin Connolly station. In 2006, the first of 67 new Mark 4 coaches were introduced on the route as part of a ‚Ç¨117 million upgrade of rolling stock. These seven new 8-car sets provide an hourly service frequency between Dublin and Cork. Although Dublin Heuston is the terminus, the line connects to Dublin Connolly via the Phoenix Park Tunnel. This route is used for both passenger and freight services, as well as rolling stock movements to the main Iarnr√≥d √âireann works at Inchicore, just south of Heuston. It is occasionally also used for special passenger services to Dublin Connolly, usually for Gaelic games events at Croke Park. History Built by the Great Southern and Western Railway (GS&WR;), it connects the largest and second largest cities in the country. It connects with lines to other destinations, including Galway, Waterford, Westport, Limerick and Tralee. Construction began in 1844, when the GS&WR; built a line from Kingsbridge Station (now Heuston Station, Dublin) to Cashel in County Tipperary, later extended to Cork. Amalgamations between the GS&WR; and other smaller railway companies in the south led to the line gaining connections to other population centres. A branch from Portarlington to Athlone was built to connect with the Midland Great Western Railway to Galway. Timetable There are 14 daily services between Dublin Heuston - Cork Kent (Monday - Saturday) Departing hourly on the hour. There are 15 daily services between Cork Kent - Dublin Heuston (Monday - Friday) Departing hourly at 25-past-the-hour and 14 daily on Saturday. On Sundays there are 10 services between Cork Kent - Dublin Heuston. In 2015, a morning service started which ran non-stop from Cork-Dublin. This service departs Cork Kent at 06:15 AM and arrives at Dublin Heuston in 2 hours 15 minutes, at 08:30 AM. Since then, in an extra service from Cork to Dublin than Dublin to Cork the 21:00 train from Dublin is formed of a 3+4 car class 22000 train which splits in Cork to operate 2 services to Dublin. In 2016 Irish rail brought the 2 mkiv sets that were out of service back into service which freed up some ICR sets. Upgrading project The line has been progressively upgraded from the late 2000s onward, with work focusing on the removal of speed restrictions, and separation of main line traffic from commuter trains near Dublin. The objective is to increase the sections of line capable of operation and thus provide faster services to compete with the M8 motorway. Ultimately it is intended for trains to run non-stop from Cork to Dublin in two hours or less. This has resulted in major disruption and cancellations on many weekends and speed restrictions affecting the punctuality of trains. The following is a summary of the main works involved: * Awbeg River bridge renewal: The railway crosses the Awbeg river near Charleville, Co. Cork. By the late 2000s this bridge in dire need of renewal, with a speed restriction of . The bridge was replaced in 2011 at a cost of ‚Ç¨1 million . * Kildare Route Project: This involved increasing the number of tracks from 2 to 4 between Cherry Orchard & Hazelhatch. It also included The renewing of the two old tracks. There is now a Down Fast, Down Slow, Up Slow & Up Fast lines. This section was cleared for 100 mph in November 2010. Project completed in March 2011. *Limerick Junction Reconfiguration: Previously there was a speed limit through Limerick Junction. In 2011 the junction was resignallised, and new track laid. It also included the automation of Emly level-crossing gates where there was a limit of in a section. This allowed speed increases to and respectively through these areas. *Relaying with 60 kg rail: All relaying on the Dublin/Cork line in the future will involve using the 60 kg rail. It is a much heavier rail giving a smoother ride in trains. The section between Portarlington and Portlaoise has been relayed with the 60 kg rail. Most of this section is now cleared for 100 mph operation. 60 kg rail is being laid on many other smaller sections on the line and this is continuing. Relaying commenced in 2011, starting from Sallins and working back towards Hazelhatch and Celbridge. *Rehabilitation works: Rehabilitation works have been undertaken on some existing sections of track. This included excavation, renewing drainage, installing a geo-textile membrane, replacing broken sleepers and renewing side worn rails. This was carried out on the section between Newbridge and Portlaoise. Speeds have been restored to almost . *Lisduff Area Renewal: Where the line passes through Lisduff Co.Tipperary there is the quarry used for ballast for the railway. There are railway sidings leading off the main line into it which were in poor condition and were replaced in early 2012, following a brief line closure. *Other Works: Other works now completed have been: Renewal of Track layout Sallins (2009); Renewal of Points & provision of faster turnouts, Cherryville (2010); Portarlington Rebuilding to increase line speed here from to (2008), Renewal of Signalling & Track, Portlaoise (2010) & Excavtion of boggy area, Pile driving and track renewal, Ballybrophy (2009) In September 2011, Iarnr√≥d √âireann received government funding of ‚Ç¨1 million to continue the improvements on the Dublin ‚Äì Portarlington section of this line later in 2011. In September 2011, Iarnr√≥d √âireann announced a ‚Ç¨175 million major investment programme, designed to further accelerate upgrading works on InterCity Routes, In particular the Dublin - Cork line. Since 2012 further upgrading has taken place including the following: *Sallins - Cherryville Realignments: In this section, in particular around the Curragh, there was much curvature in the line, resulting in an 80 mph limit in these areas. This project has seen the Railway realigned through these areas to remove the curves & increase the speed limit to 100 mph. There was also relaying of track in this section. Project completed in 2016. *Portlaoise - Limerick Junction Relaying: This long section of line formerly had a maximum speed of 90 mph, with slightly lower limits in spots. The majority of this section had works to the trackbed & Relaying to increase the speed to 100 mph. There was also an elimination of level crossings & upgrading of points nearer Limerick Junction. Project completed in 2016. In 2015 further upgrade plans were announced. Iarnr√≥d √âireann chief executive David Franks outlined how ballast was to be renewed between Hazelhatch and Kildare, which was to allow running on the long stretch. Further upgrades such as the removal of level crossings and bridge replacements are expected to bring journey times from Cork to Dublin to under 2 hours. The line is expected to be fully electrified by 2030. High-speed rail proposal In 2020 the Irish Government confirmed it will be launching a study into an approximately 500 km high-speed railway from Belfast via Dublin to Cork and Limerick, which could cost around ‚Ç¨15 billion.

The seat of Ijok in the State Legislative Assembly of Selangor, Malaysia, fell vacant after the death of the incumbent, K. Sivalingam, on 4 April 2007 from a heart attack. Sivalingam was a member of the state executive council as well as the deputy chairman of the Selangor state Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC), a component party of the ruling Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition.Vijian, P. (4 April 2007). Selangor Exco Member Sivalingam Dies Of Heart Attack In Chennai . Bernama. The by-election was won by the BN candidate K. Parthiban, with a 1,850-vote majority over the opposition candidate, Khalid Ibrahim.  Background  State assembly seat N.08 Ijok lies in parliamentary seat P.096 Kuala Selangor. As of the 2004 General Elections, Ijok was a Malay-majority seat (50.6%), followed by Indians (28.3%), Chinese (20.9%) and others (0.2%). In the 2004 election, the late K. Sivalingam of the MIC (a component party of the BN coalition), garnered 5,213 votes, defeating Abdul Rahman Moharam of the People's Justice Party (PKR) (3,564 votes) and independent candidate Mohamed Shariff Nagoorkani (313 votes).  Pre-nomination speculation  = Barisan Nasional = There was no shortage of potential candidates from the BN coalition; the English daily The Star had quoted MIC president S. Samy Vellu that 23 MIC members have expressed interest to contest the by-election. However, the two leading favourites were said to be MIC central working committee members S. Murugesan and T. Mohan. Other names bandied by the media included teacher and MIC Kuala Selangor division chief P. Thirumoorthy, Shah Alam division vice-chairman S. Muruga Vellu and Kota Raja deputy chief R. Subramaniam. However, on 16 April 2007, the BN picked a relative unknown, former teacher K. Parthiban as its by- election candidate. The selection prompted the MIC Kuala Selangor division chief P. Thirumoorthy, a relative party heavyweight on the candidate shortlist to quit the MIC, only to backtrack and declare his support for Parthiban two days later. = Opposition = The opposition candidate was Khalid Ibrahim from Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR). Meanwhile, the two major opposition parties, the Pan Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS) and the Democratic Action Party (DAP), in a rare display of opposition solidarity, both threw their support behind the PKR for the by-election. PKR's campaign will be led by party adviser and former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. The leading potential candidate was current party treasurer and former Kumpulan Guthrie Bhd and Permodalan Nasional Bhd CEO Khalid Ibrahim, although some PKR members lobbied for an Indian candidate. Eventually, the party announced that it had shortlisted Khalid and Indian bureau head K.S. Nallakarupan for its ticket. Later on 17 April 2007, it was announced that, as expected, Khalid would be the PKR nominee. Nallakarupan said that although PKR President Wan Azizah Wan Ismail had offered him the nomination, he declined in favour of Khalid. Azizah denied allegations of racial bias in the decision, stating: \\"We picked the candidate not on racial lines but on the basis of the most appropriate choice to be the people's voice in the state assembly\\". = Independent candidates = On 15 April 2007, Klang-based businessman K. Loganathan announced he would contest as an independent candidate in the by-election, citing the lack of development and progress under the previous assemblyman and his desire to serve the rural folk of Ijok as reasons. By 18 April 2007, rumours were rife that a plethora of independent candidates will be contesting the by-election. Independent online news daily Malaysiakini reported as many as four independent candidates, including Loganathan, have expressed interest to contest. Nominations BN Deputy Youth Chief Khairy Jamaluddin was alleged to have been involved in provoking a nomination day scuffle. On 19 April 2007, the candidates from BN and PKR filed their nominations at the Batang Berjuntai community hall, which was converted into a temporary nomination centre. Neither Loganathan nor any of the purported independent candidates appeared, and thus after the nomination period ended at 11.00 am, returning officer Haris Kasim announced that the by-election would be a straight fight between K. Parthiban of the MIC and Khalid of PKR. The nomination was marred by a clash between BN and PKR supporters when their processions to the nomination centre inadvertently met. Eventually, the police intervened and separated the two groups. PKR later accused that Khairy Jamaluddin, Deputy BN Youth Chief, had been involved in provoking the fight, and also that BN Youth Chief and Education Minister Hishamuddin Hussein had thrown bottles at PKR supporters. However, no valid reports was actually made. The Prime Minister had later warned both PKR and BN supporters of their behaviour during the by-election of Ijok.  By-election results  The BN candidate, K. Parthiban, won with a majority of 1,850 votes. Parthiban secured 5,884 votes while Keadilan's Abdul Khalid Ibrahim got 4,034 votes. A total of 10,052 voters, or 81.9%, of the 12,272 eligible voters had cast their ballots, a record turnout for the constituency. In the 2004 General Elections, BN defeated PKR by 1,649 votes in the constituency.

It is located in the East Neuk, south-east of St Andrews. At the heart of the estate lies the 19th-century Cambo House, the home of Sir Peter Erskine, Bt and Lady Catherine Erskine. The gardens of Cambo are open to the public, and include the walled garden and seasonal snowdrop gardens. Elsewhere on the estate is the Kingsbarns Golf Links golf course, which co-hosts the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship every year. History The estate of Cambo was granted to Robert de Newenham by a charter of King William the Lion. His descendants took the name \\"de Cambhou\\", and had settled in Fife by the early 14th century. Sir John de Cambhou fought at the Battle of Methven (1306), but was captured by the English and hanged at Newcastle. In 1599 the estate was granted to Thomas Myretoun. In 1668, Sir Charles Erskine, Bt (d. 1677), the Lord Lyon King of Arms and brother of the 3rd Earl of Kellie, purchased the property from the creditors of Patrick Merton. The estate passed through the Erskine family to the 5th Earl of Kellie, who forfeited his lands after supporting the Jacobite rising of 1745. In 1759 Cambo was sold to the Charteris family, who bought it for their son who was studying at St Andrews University. Thomas Erskine, 9th Earl of Kellie (c. 1745‚Äì1828), bought the estate back in the 1790s. A successful merchant in Sweden, he invested heavily in improving the estate, building the picturesque Georgian estate farms, and carrying out extensive land drainage. He commissioned the architect Robert Balfour to remodel the house in 1795. His descendants continued the improvement of the estate through the 19th century, laying out ornamental gardens, with a series of early cast iron bridges. The old house comprised a tower house with numerous additions, including a first-floor conservatory. It was destroyed by fire in 1878, after a staff party when the Erskine family was away. The present house was built on the same site between 1879 and 1884, to designs by the architects Wardrop & Reid. Cambo House The estate Cambo House is protected as a category B listed building, and the grounds are included in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland, the national listing of historic gardens. The house is operated as self-catering and bed & breakfast accommodation, while the walled garden and woodland gardens are open to the public year-round. The estate woodlands have a significant collection of snowdrops, including over 300 varieties of Galanthus species. The estate was awarded National Collection status by the National Council for the Conservation of Plants and Gardens. Kingsbarns Golf Links was laid out in 2000 to designs by American golf course architects Kyle Phillips and Mark Parsinen. The Alfred Dunhill Links Championship, an annual pro-am golf tournament, is played in September on Kingsbarns, St Andrews Old Course, and Carnoustie.

It opened in 1866 but was continuously short of money, and was unable to complete its originally-planned route, nor to provide more than the most basic level of equipment. It closed due to bankruptcy in 1935. Origin Bishop's Castle RailwayBishop's Castle is a small town located in Shropshire near the border with Montgomeryshire, now Powys. Its population in the middle decades of the nineteenth century was about 2,000. The town had been on the route of a proposed trunk line to Porth Dinllaen, which was seen as a packet port for Ireland at one time, but that scheme had come to nothing.Richard K Morriss, Railways of Shropshire: a Brief History, Shropshire Libraries, Shrewsbury, 1983, , pages 38 and 39 To the east the Shrewsbury and Hereford Railway had opened its main line in 1852; there was a station at Craven Arms, named after a nearby inn that had been a staging post for the coaches. To the west, lay the Oswestry and Newtown Railway, which was promoted in 1859: its main purpose was to connect a group of small railways at Newtown with the English railway network, by way of Oswestry. The O&NR; had a Montgomery station, but it was two miles from the town it served. That part of the line opened in 1862.T R Perkins, The Bishop's Castle Railway, in the Railway Magazine, February 1909 At this time it had become clear that rural towns that were not connected to a railway would suffer economically, as necessities brought in, and manufactures and agricultural products sent out, were expensive to transport by other means. Accordingly the idea developed of a railway branch line from the Craven Arms station to a point on the O&NR; near Montgomery, serving the town and intermediate areas. From a junction at Wistanstow near Craven Arms, this would run through Lydham and join the O&NR; north of Montgomery station, near the bridge over the River Camlad. The town of Montgomery is on a hill, and the route of the proposed railway could not be made close to the town; a short branch line to it would be built. There would also be a branch from Lydham to Bishop's Castle.T R Perkins, In Memoriam: the Bishop's Castle Railway, in the Railway Magazine, October 1937 At public meetings locally, the scheme received enthusiastic support, and a Parliamentary Bill went forward; the railway was authorised by the Bishop's Castle Railway Act, on 28 June 1861. Authorised share capital was ¬£180,000, to build miles of line.Ernest F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959Donald J Grant, Directory of the Railway Companies of Great Britain, Matador Publishers, Kibworth Beauchamp, 2017, , page 50 There was dismay when the scheme was published, for it was then seen that Bishop's Castle was planned to be on a branch and not the main line. The Shrewsbury Chronicle commented, \\"The railway is a misnomer, for Bishop's Castle will never enjoy much, if any, of its vast benefits\\".Shrewsbury Chronicle, 22 March 1861, quoted in Oppitz As a result of local feeling, the Committee of the House of Commons introduced a clause in the Railway Bill requiring that a branch from Lydham Heath to Bishop's Castle must be opened concurrently with the main line.Leslie Oppitz, Shropshire and Staffordshire Railways Remembered, Countryside Books, Newbury, 1993, , page 34 Construction and opening Remains of station buildings at Bishop's Castle in 1951A contractor was appointed, and he stated that he would start work as soon as a proportion of the share capital had been actually subscribed. This proved extremely difficult and for a considerable time no work was started, due to the absence of share subscriptions. It was not until 1865 that work was begun, by another contractor, and the part of the line from Craven Arms to Lydham and Bishop's Castle was opened on 1 February 1866. The line formed a Y shape, as trains ran from Craven Arms to Lydham and reversed to reach Bishop's Castle. Much of the route followed the River Onny. The first commercial use of the line was actually on 27 January 1866, when a special train was provided for the Squire of Plowden for his shooting party.Shrewsbury Free Press, 3 February 1866, quoted in Michael Quick, Railway Passenger Stations in England, Scotland and Wales: A Chronology, the Railway and Canal Historical Society, Richmond, Surrey, fifth (electronic) edition, 2019, pages 475 and 476 However Oppitz says that the Bishop's Castle branch from Lydham was used [for passenger purposes] from October 1865 without waiting for the approval of the Government Inspector.Edward Griffith, The Bishop's Castle Railway, 1865 ‚Äì 1935, quoted in Oppitz page 45 Expansion plans Notwithstanding the failure to complete the line, the directors now started to plan an extension line, to Minsterley. The topography was helpful for such a line, as low-lying land around the Aylesford Brook and the Rea Brook led from Chirbury (on the proposed Montgomery line) to Minsterley; there was already a branch line terminus there, connecting with Shrewsbury. An Act authorising this extension was granted on 29 June 1865. Now the money market turned against railway projects in the financial Panic of 1866 and it became impossible to get finance. Moreover the ordinary trading of the company was disappointing, and it fell into the hands of a receiver in Court of Chancery. Completion of the original line from Lydham to Montgomery was obviously impossible.Oppitz, page 36 Working the line The company had two locomotives, and operated one at a time, so that the operating system was ‚Äúone engine in steam‚Äù. There was no electric telegraph or block working, and therefore no communication for train control. There were three train services each way daily with an additional one on cattle-fair days. There were several passenger coaches, although three were normally used on service trains; they were four-wheelers, using the obsolescent chain brake system. Receivership and temporary closure The railway was always heavily in debt, and on 27 February 1877 possession some of the land on which the railway ran was taken by authority of the Court of Chancery, due to unpaid debts. The line was closed until 2 July 1877 when the sum of ¬£700 was paid in to court and the seizure was cancelled. The money was raised by a sale and leaseback of a locomotive and some land, to local persons. Most of the press simply said that the line was 'stopped' during this period; however the Wellington Journal (newspaper) said that a service was continuing between Horderley and Bishops Castle, with Mr Scriven, a hotel proprietor, providing a wagonnette service from Craven Arms to Horderley. The suspension of through goods trains was considered to have had a marked adverse effect on the price of coal in Bishop's Castle.Wellington Journal, 3 March 1877, quoted in QuickQuick, page 476Oppitz, page 37 Another Attempt to reach Montgomery Not to be deterred the company's supporters promoted a further scheme in 1883 to extend the line from Lydham Heath to Montgomery. They obtained an authorising Act of Parliament on 7 August 1884, incorporating the Bishop's Castle and Montgomery Railway, but once again local support in the form of share subscriptions was absent, and the scheme never progressed. It was abandoned by a further Act of 5 July 1887.Grant, pages 49 and 50 Washout in 1886 There was severe flooding in the district in 1886 and the line was breached by a washout at Plowden on 13 May 1886. For a few weeks the traffic was worked from each end and passengers were conveyed past the gap in horse brakes. A final plea to the GWR On 1 January 1922, the Cambrian Railways, owners of the Oswestry and Newtown line at Montgomery, joined the Great Western Railway as part of the grouping of the railways. Craven Arms was also a Great Western station (jointly with the London and North Western Railway, shortly to be the London Midland and Scottish Railway). The Bishop's Castle Railway tried to persuade the GWR to build the Lydham Heath to Montgomery line, so forming a through link between the two main lines. If that were done the Bishop's Castle might sell its line to the GWR. The GWR immediately made it plain that it was not interested in such a development.Morriss, page 54 Evidently Montgomery Town Council had been lobbying for such a scheme‚Äìthe \\"Montgomery\\" station on the Cambrian line was some distance from the town; however in June 1924, the Ministry of Transport indicated that a Government grant was not a possibility. Closure For decades the company had struggled to continue in business while in receivership. The financial state of the company was worsening as road transport in rural areas began to expand, and the Receivership was terminated in April 1935: the business was closed down and the line now ceased to operate.

Life  Kawena Pukui was born in the Ka ª≈´ district of the Island of Hawai ªi, to Mary Pa ªahana Kanaka ªole (a native Hawaiian woman) and Henry Nathaniel Wiggin (originally from Massachusetts). In the traditional custom of hƒÅnai, she was initially reared by her mother's parents. Her grandmother Naliipo ªaimoku, a traditional dancer in the court of Queen Emma, taught her chants and stories, while her grandfather Keli'ikanaka'ole-o-Haililani (k) was a healer and kahuna pale keiki (obstetrician) who used lomilomi massage, la ªau lapa ªau (herbal medicine), ho ªoponopono (forgiveness), and pule (prayer). Her great grandmother Keli ªipa ªahana was a kahuna pule (priestess) in the Pele line. Keli'iPa'ahana's parents were the High Chief KU or Kauhi and High Chiefess Na'ai Hunali'i (The Hidden chief). Keli'iPa'ahana was interned in Halema'uma'u in 1869 in the Ka'u district. She married the High Chief Keli'iKanaka'ole (k), the son of High Chief Kaelele and Princess Kekelaokalani, whose family inherited the sacred Ali ªi Moe Kapu (the prostrating Taboo). Upon the death of her grandmother Nali'i Poai moku she returned to live with her parents and spoke both Hawaiian and English. Pukui was educated in the Hawaiian Mission Academy, and taught Hawaiiana at Punahou School. Pukui was fluent in the Hawaiian language, and from the age of 15 collected and translated folk tales, proverbs and sayings. She worked at the Bernice P. Bishop Museum from 1938‚Äì1961 as an ethnological assistant and translator. She also taught Hawaiian to several scholars and served as informant for numerous anthropologists. She published more than 50 scholarly works. She is the co-author of the definitive Hawaiian-English Dictionary (1957, revised 1986), Place Names of Hawaii (1974), and The Echo of Our Song (1974), a translation of old chants and songs. Her book,  ª≈ålelo No ªeau, contains nearly 3,000 examples of Hawaiian proverbs and poetical sayings, translated and annotated. The two-volume set NƒÅnƒÅ i ke Kumu, Look to the Source, is an invaluable resource on Hawaiian customs and traditions. She was a chanter and hula expert, and wrote lyrics and music to more than 150 Hawaiian songs. In addition to her published works, Pukui's knowledge was also preserved in her notes, oral histories, hundreds of audiotape recordings from the 1950s and 1960s, and a few film clips, all collected in the Bishop Museum. She is often credited with making the Hawaiian Renaissance of the 1970s possible. She was named a \\"Living Treasure of Hawai'i\\" by the Honpa Hongwanji Mission of Hawai ªi in 1977. In 1995 she was inducted into the Hawaiian Music Hall of Fame. In March 2017, Hawai ªi Magazine ranked her among a list of the most influential women in Hawaiian history.

It is a prodrug of tolmetin sodium. Background  Tolmetin sodium is an approved NSAID, marketed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. In humans, tolmetin sodium is absorbed rapidly with peak plasma levels observed 30 min after administration. It is eliminated rapidly with a mean plasma elimination t¬Ω of approximately 1 hr. The preparation of slow release formulations or chemical modification of NSAIDs to form prodrugs has been suggested as a method to reduce the gastrotoxicity of these agents. Amtolmetin guacil is a non-acidic prodrug of tolmetin, having NSAID properties similar to tolmetin with additional analgesic, antipyretic, and gastro protective properties. Amtolmetin is formed by amidation of tolmetin by glycine. Pharmacology *Most is absorbed on oral administration. It is concentrated in the gastric wall. Highest concentration is reached 2 hours after administration. *Amtolmetin guacil can be hydrolysed to produce the metabolites Tolmetin, MED5 and Guiacol. *Elimination completes in 24 hours. This happens mostly with urine in shape of gluconides products (77%), faecal (7.5%). *It is advised to take the drug on empty stomach. *Permanent anti-inflammatory action continues up to 72 hours, with single administration. Mechanism of action Amtolmetin guacil stimulates capsaicin receptors present on gastrointestinal walls, because of presence of vanillic moiety and also releases NO which is gastro protective.

Trevor was the eldest of three sons born to Arthur and Ethel Oldham. He was educated at Melbourne Church of England Grammar School and the University of Melbourne. He had enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force on 7 November 1918, four days before the Armistice. He married Kathleen Cooch in 1929. Business career Oldham graduated in law at Melbourne University in 1921 and practised as a solicitor until the weight of parliamentary duties limited his time. He was a past president of the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital and a former deputy chancellor of Melbourne University. Oldham was a former director of Henry Berry & Co., Hoadley Chocolates Ltd, Ruskins Motor Bodys Ltd, and Ensign Dry Cleaners Ltd. Political career Oldham entered parliament in 1933 as a member of the United Australia Party, he won the seat of Booroondara and held it until the seat was divided in 1945. When the UAP was reformed as the Liberal Party in 1945 Oldham won the seat of Malvern. Oldham served as Attorney-General and Solicitor-General of Victoria in Thomas Hollway's first government in 1947, and he also served as Deputy Premier of Victoria for 8 months before the Liberals lost office to a Country Party and Labor Party alliance in 1950. In 1951 Les Norman replaced Hollway as Liberal leader after the party grew lukewarm on Hollway's plan of reforming Victoria's malapportioned electoral boundaries. In a provocative move, Hollway contested Norman's urban-based seat of Glen Iris at the 1952 election and won. With their leader having been defeated the Liberal Party elected Oldham as leader and Henry Bolte as deputy leader. Death Trevor Oldham and his wife were killed in a plane crash in India on 2 May 1953, on their way to England to attend the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. The BOAC Comet they were travelling in broke up mid-air a few minutes after leaving Calcutta among severe thunderstorms and torrential rain. Indian authorities arranged a communal burial of all victims of the Comet crash in Calcutta. A memorial service was held at Melbourne's St Paul's Cathedral on 6 May 1953. The Oldhams were survived by their three children, James 10, Byrony 8 and Kristin 6.

It comprises two dense white dwarfs orbiting each other once every 321.5 seconds (in this system the \\"year\\" duration is of only 5.4 minutes), at an estimated distance of only apart (about 1/5 the distance between the Earth and the Moon). The two stars orbit each other at speeds in excess of . The stars are estimated to be about half as massive as the Sun. Like typical white dwarfs, they are extremely dense, being composed of degenerate matter, and so have radii on the order of the Earth's radius. Astronomers believe that the two stars will eventually merge, based on data from many X-ray satellites, such as Chandra X-Ray Observatory, XMM-Newton and the Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission. These data show that the orbital period of the two stars is steadily decreasing at a rate of 1.2 milliseconds per year as they thus are getting closer by approximately per day. At this rate, they can be expected to merge in approximately 340,000 years. With a revolution period of 5.4 minutes, RX J0806.3+1527 is the shortest orbital period binary system currently known. Observations As RX J0806.3+1527 is a pair of white dwarfs, it has a relatively low optical luminosity. Scientists discovered periodic spikes occurring every 321.5 s by looking at the source in the X-rays. In fact, the 321.5 s modulation of RX J0806.3+1527 was discovered serendipitously in 1999 thanks to the ROSAT mission working in the X-ray band. Optical follow-up observations with the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT), Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG) and Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) allowed the counterpart to be identified, a relatively dim (20.7 magnitude in the B filter) object which shows an optical modulation at the same period detected in the X-ray band. The optical monitoring of the counterpart of RX J0806.3+1527 during 2001-2004 clearly shows that the period is decreasing at a rate of about 1/1000 s each year. This result was confirmed by monitoring the source in the X-rays for several years. Relation to general relativity The decreasing separation of the components of the system mean that the system is losing orbital energy. Albert Einstein's theory of General Relativity predicts such a system will lose orbital energy through the generation of gravitational waves. Scientists believe that RX J0806.3+1527 may be one of the strongest sources of gravitational waves in the Milky Way galaxy.

Ilex glabra is often found in landscapes of the middle and lower East Coast of the United States. It typically matures to tall, and can spread by root suckers to form colonies. It normally is cultivated as an evergreen shrub in USDA zones 6 to 10.Cloud, Katherine Mallet-Prevost. The Cultivation of Shrubs (Chapter IX: Cultural Instructions), Dodd, Mead & Company, 1927, p. 191. Gallberry nectar is the source of a pleasant honey that is popular in the southern United States. Description 'Compacta' leaves Spineless, flat, ovate to elliptic, glossy, dark green leaves (to 1.5 in long) have smooth margins with several marginal teeth near the apex. Leaves usually remain attractive bright green in winter unless temperatures fall below -17 C/0 F. Greenish white flowers (male in cymes and female in cymes or single) appear in spring, but are relatively inconspicuous. If pollinated, female flowers give way to pea-sized, jet black, berry-like drupes (inkberries to 3/8\\" diameter) which mature in early fall and persist throughout winter to early spring unless consumed by local bird populations. Cultivars of species plants (see for example Ilex glabra 'Shamrock') typically have better form (more compact, less open, less leggy and less suckering) that the species. Uses =Honey= Gallberry honey is a highly rated honey that results from bees feeding on inkberry flowers. This honey is locally produced in certain parts of the Southeastern U. S. in areas where beekeepers release bees from late April to early June to coincide with inkberry flowering time. =Beverage= Dried and roasted inkberry leaves were first used by Native Americans to brew a black tea-like drink, hence the sometimes used common name of Appalachian tea for this shrub.

There is also an alternate universe d≈çjinshi and two episode OVA called Shiritsu Araiso Koto Gakko Seitokai Shikkobu (ÁßÅÁ´ãËçíÁ£ØÈ´òÁ≠âÂ≠¶Ê†°ÁîüÂæí‰ºöÂü∑Ë°åÈÉ® Araiso Private School Student Council Executive Committee). Wild Adapter was also adapted as a two episode OVA in 2014, which is set in the universe of the manga series. Overview Although originally serialized in a boy's love anthology magazine, the content of the manga mixes seinen action and mystery with sh≈çnen-ai themes and thus does not fall clearly into either category. The volumes are stand alones, each with its own storyline and theme that fit into the broader arc of the general plot, which has Kubota and Tokitoh, the main characters, investigating a mysterious drug, 'W¬∑A', and finding out about Tokitoh's past before his amnesia. As such, the overall series is largely character-driven, rather than action-driven, and other events and issues are shown as part of the lives of the main characters. The storytelling is done through a different side character for each volume, and the author has described the series as \\"the lives of the protagonists as seen, and described by an onlooker\\". There is plenty of violence and bloodshed in the manga, which also deals with serious issues, and a theme for each volume, such as the cult of religion, the power of words, the struggle for survival. The yakuza underworld serves as a setting for the series, but it is not the main focal point. Rather, it is the interactions between the two protagonists, and the exploration of their characters. The artstyle of the manga is stark black and white with clean sharp lines, and there is less shading or greytones. Keeping in line with Minekura's style the characters are highly detailed, with emphasis on facial features, especially the hair, and anatomically accurate bodies. The backgrounds are also highly detailed and portray the Tokyo urban landscape very realistically.Common scenes are of buildings, the skyline, complete with billboards of real brands and logos. A unique feature of the manga has all the pages and spaces outside the panels coloured black, a technique usually used in manga only to reflect a past event or a flashback.It is unclear if the black pages are used to signify the events of Wild Adapter being in the past, or if it is simply for asethetic reasons. This work was originally serialized in Japan in Chara magazine, starting from 2001, and was published by Tokuma Shoten. Since 2011, it is published by Zero Sum Ward of Ichijinsha. The series is licensed in North America by Tokyopop, the first volume of which was published in January 2007. There are 6 volumes which were originally published between 2001 and 2008. The series is also published in English by Chuang Yi, in German by Carlsen Comics and is published in East Asia. Story \\"W¬∑A,\\" later identified as \\"Wild Adapter,\\" is the name of a dangerous drug which transforms its users into an animalistic state; the users exhibit superhuman strength and a berserker mentality until the drug causes his or her organs to explode, effectively killing them. The corpses left behind by W¬∑A are covered in fur and sport cat-like claws. The police are baffled by W‚Ä¢A even as they investigate the remains of W¬∑A users, and the Yakuza wants it. Two powerful rival yakuza groups, the Izumokai and the Toujougumi are fighting to figure out and gain control of the source of W¬∑A, a task made harder by the fact that no user of W¬∑A have managed to stay alive after consuming the drug. Amid this, 17-year-old Kubota, the first of two main protagonists, have somehow managed to stumble into the position of Head of the Izumokai youth group, despite not being a gang member before that. He is aided by the second-in-command, Komiya, in his yakuza jobs and it is through Komiya that he knows of the existence of W¬∑A. Komiya is killed by the rival Toujougumi gang when investigating W¬∑A, and Kubota quits the gang after Komiya's death, but not before taking out twelve high-ranking members of the Toujougumi gang, and disappears from the yakuza world. Soon after, Kubota picks up a stranger with amnesia whom he names Tokitoh, and they start living together. Tokitoh has no idea of his identity, or why his right hand is a furry, clawed paw identical to the animalistic bodies of dead W¬∑A users, yet he is still alive. Kubota and Tokitoh then set out on a mission to investigate W¬∑A, hoping to discover Tokitoh's past at the same time. The manga details their quest to investigate every victim of W¬∑A, and following up on any leads provided by Kou, a drugstore owner who is Kubota's current employer, or Kasai, Kubota's detective uncle. These tips however are usually red herrings or traps and lead nowhere. In the process, Kubota and Tokitoh often get mixed up with the yakuza who are just as eager to seek W¬∑A. Sanada, leader back of Izumokai gang and Kubota's former employer is fascinated by Kubota, and constantly keeps tabs on him. Sekiya, leader of Toujougumi just wants to get his hands on W¬∑A. In their various clashes with the yakuza Kubota and Tokitoh rarely emerge unscathed, but they always manage to survive and make it out somehow, ready to follow the next lead. Characters ; Kubota Makoto In volume one of Wild Adapter, Kubota is 16. He becomes leader of the Yakuza's Izumokai youth division when he is offered two guns; one of them is dangerously defective and the other is safe and functional. He chooses the functional gun and executes the youth division's previous leader who was revealed to be a spy from the rival Yakuza. Kubota leaves the Izumokai after only seven months, and a year later, re-emerges as Tokitoh's protector. He is seen as calm, collected, and focused, as well as cool, callous, and aloof. He is cruel and insensitive, but at the same time, childish and sweet. To both friends and enemies, they find him terrifying at times‚Äîwhether because he can insensitively break a man's arm, or because of his smile. He is never seen without a cigarette, and his favored brand is Seven Stars. Komiya, in volume 1, says he has no logic to him. He says, \\"Interested in nothing, yet fiercely curious about everything. Acts like he doesn't care, but with so much desire in his eyes. Only caring for himself, but completely masochistic. Needing nothing, clinging to everything. Chaos existing inside tight order...All of these fevered colors merging into black...and disappearing. He's just like this city.\\" Kubota is extremely possessive of Tokito, and is a very talented mahjong player. * voiced by Toshiyuki Morikawa on drama CDs and in the Executive Committee OVA ; Tokito Minoru Tokitoh is first introduced as a boy running from pursuers. He collapses, unconscious, in an alley, where Kubota finds him soon after leaving the Izumokai. Tokitoh's right hand is that of a beast's‚Äîand that of deceased W¬∑A users‚Äîand it occasionally causes him immense pain. He keeps it covered by a black glove. He has no memory of his past before Kubota picked him up, other than flashes of a menacing figure who calls him \\"Minoru.\\" Tokitoh is loud, impulsive, stubborn, and tactless at times, but he is straightforward, kind- hearted, and a very loyal ally. Kubota, along with several other characters, refers to Tokitoh as a \\"cat,\\" or \\"stray cat.\\" Tokitoh calls Kubota \\"Kubo- chan.\\" Tokitoh is the only person who calls Kubota 'Kubo-chan' in the manga. This makes it obvious when Tokitoh is talking, and also shows how close they are, as opposed to others who go by the more formal 'Kubota-san' or 'Kubota- kun'. This detail is sometimes lost in translation. Tokitoh is highly protective of Kubota, and gets jealous easily when he thinks someone else is closer to Kubota. * voiced by Hideo Ishikawa on drama CDs and in the Executive Committee OVA =Yakuza= Izumokai * Sanada is the daikou, or leader, of the Izumokai. He takes a special interest in Kubota when he becomes leader of the Youth Division. He has a vicious dog named Ark‚Äînamed for his favorite brand of cigarettes, Ark Royal Vanilla. After Kubota leaves the Izumokai, Sanada follows him around. * Komiya Nobuo is the second-in-command in the Izumokai Youth Division. He is doubtful of Kubota when he first takes up the leader position, but over the course of the first volume, develops feelings for him. Komiya's mother is a drug-using prostitute who is almost killed at the hands of a W¬∑A user. Komiya is killed at the end of the first volume when he obtains a sample of W¬∑A for Kubota. Komiya's death is the reason why Kubota leaves the Izumokai. * Osamu is the man who takes Kubota's place as the leader of the Izumokai Youth Division. He is introduced at the end of volume 4 as a cold, ruthless man willing to do anything to climb up the yakuza ranks. In volume 6, he is responsible for abducting Tokitoh to the Izumokai's off-shore oil tanker. * Ryuunosuke/Tatchan is Osamu's second-in-command and childhood friend. He is more compassionate and friendly than Osamu. Toujougumi ‚Ä¢ Sekiya Jun is the leader of the Toujougumi Youth Division, and becomes the daikou when Kubota kills the previous leader as his condition of leaving the Izumokai at the end of volume 1. In his one major confrontation with Kubota and Tokitoh in volume 2, Sekiya tells them that he knows about W¬∑A, at least, and makes it clear that he suspects Tokitoh is also involved. He acts suggestively toward Tokitoh and has a stereotypically homosexual attitude; he speaks with a lisp and refers to himself with the feminine \\"atashi\\" (rather than the more masculine \\"ore,\\" \\"jibun,\\" or \\"boku\\"). Saori calls him an \\"okama\\"‚Äîan offensive term for a homosexual man. * voiced by Shin-ichiro Miki on drama CDs =Police= * Kasai is Kubota's uncle and a detective. He gives Kubota information regarding W¬∑A and helps him out in various ways, like letting Kubota off the hook when he turns up at the scenes of assorted murders or gang turf-wars. He is very concerned about his nephew, but his advice does not always get across to Kubota. * Araki is Kasai's rookie detective. He accompanies Kasai to crime scenes and is infamous for his weak stomach around W¬∑A scenes. * Hasebe is another detective who detains Kubota on suspicion of murder in volume 4. =Friends= * Kou manages a small shop in the Chinese area of Yokohama. He acts as Tokitoh's doctor (\\"veterinarian\\"), despite the fact that he is unlicensed. Tokitoh resents him and calls him various things like, \\"quack\\" or \\"unlicensed bastard.\\" Kou sells various questionable odd and ends in his shop, including weapons and drugs and is good at getting information. He employs Kubota for odd jobs like deliveries. * voiced by Toshihiko Seki on drama CDs * Ookuba Saori is a girl who runs into Kubota and Tokitoh; volume 2 details her interaction with them, and is most likely her sole appearance in the story as a whole. Saori is a pregnant girl who runs away from home, intending to find her boyfriend. She encounters Kubota when she's trying to shoplift from a convenience store, and later becomes more involved with Kubota and Tokitoh when she discovers that her boyfriend is dead as an effect of W¬∑A. It is strongly implied at the end of the volume that she has an abortion. * Takizawa Ryouji is a reporter who encounters Kubota and Tokitoh in volume 3 and becomes quite fond of them. He joins Kubota and Tokitoh in investigating a religious cult called \\"Kaikou no Kiba\\"‚Äî\\"Fang of Fortune\\"‚Äîand its possible connections to W¬∑A. Takizawa becomes a freelance reporter in volume 4. * Anna is an old friend of Kubota's who works as a prostitute. She asks for Kubota's help in volume 4, but ends up generally making Tokitoh jealous and uneasy. She knew Kubota when he was 15 and took his virginity. * Shouta is a young neighbor of Kubota and Tokitoh's. He lived in the next-door apartment when Kubota first brought Tokitoh home, and was instrumental in socializing Tokitoh. He moved away before the events of volume 2, but his character is not revealed until volume 5. Executive committee Wild Adapter's characters first made their debut in one of Minekura's earlier works, a d≈çjinshi titled Araiso Private High School Student Council Executive Committee. In Executive Committee, Kubota and Tokitoh are high school students who are on the Executive Committee, a kind of juvenile police force. The stories in Executive Committee are largely silly and plotless, such as resolving mysteries over a cheat-sheet for an exam, or acting as bodyguards for a spoiled teen idol. Executive Committee is also a two-episode OVA.

Many species in this genus can be characterized as opportunistic avirulent plant symbionts. This refers to the ability of several Trichoderma species to form mutualistic endophytic relationships with several plant species. The genomes of several Trichoderma species have been sequenced and are publicly available from the JGI.  Taxonomy  The genus was described by Christiaan Hendrik Persoon in 1794, but the taxonomy has remained difficult to resolve. For a long time it was considered to consist of only one species, Trichoderma viride, named for producing green mold. = Subdivision = The genus was divided into five sections in 1991 by Bissett, partly based on the aggregate species described by Rifai: *Pachybasium (20 species) *Longibrachiatum (10 species) *Trichoderma *Saturnisporum (2 species) *Hypocreanum With the advent of molecular markers from 1995 onwards, Bissett's scheme was largely confirmed but Saturnisporum was merged with Longibrachiatum. While Longibrachiatum and Hypocreanum appeared monophyletic, Pachybasium was determined to be paraphyletic, many of its species clustering with Trichoderma. Druzhina and Kubicek (2005) confirmed the genus as circumscribed was holomorphic. They identified 88 species which they demonstrated could be assigned to two major clades. Consequently, the formal description of sections has been largely replaced by informal descriptions of clades, such as the Aureoviride clade or the Gelatinosum clade. =Species= The belief that Trichoderma was monotypic persisted until the work of Rifai in 1969, who recognised nine species. Currently there are 89 accepted species in the genus Trichoderma. Hypocrea are teleomorphs of Trichoderma which themselves have Hypocrea as anamorphs. Characteristics Cultures are typically fast growing at 25‚Äì30 ¬∞C, but some species of Trichoderma will grow at 45 ¬∞C. Colonies are transparent at first on media such as cornmeal dextrose agar (CMD) or white on richer media such as potato dextrose agar (PDA). Mycelium are not typically obvious on CMD, conidia typically form within one week in compact or loose tufts in shades of green or yellow or less frequently white. A yellow pigment may be secreted into the agar, especially on PDA. Some species produce a characteristic sweet or 'coconut' odor. Conidiophores are highly branched and thus difficult to define or measure, loosely or compactly tufted, often formed in distinct concentric rings or borne along the scant aerial hyphae. Main branches of the conidiophores produce lateral side branches that may be paired or not, the longest branches distant from the tip and often phialides arising directly from the main axis near the tip. The branches may rebranch, with the secondary branches often paired and longest secondary branches being closest to the main axis. All primary and secondary branches arise at or near 90¬∞ with respect to the main axis. The typical Trichoderma conidiophore, with paired branches assumes a pyramidal aspect. Typically the conidiophore terminates in one or a few phialides. In some species (e.g. T. polysporum) the main branches are terminated by long, simple or branched, hooked, straight or sinuous, septate, thin-walled, sterile or terminally fertile elongations. The main axis may be the same width as the base of the phialide or it may be much wider. Phialides are typically enlarged in the middle but may be cylindrical or nearly subglobose. Phialides may be held in whorls, at an angle of 90¬∞ with respect to other members of the whorl, or they may be variously penicillate (gliocladium-like). Phialides may be densely clustered on wide main axis (e.g. T. polysporum, T. hamatum) or they may be solitary (e.g. T. longibrachiatum). Conidia typically appear dry but in some species they may be held in drops of clear green or yellow liquid (e.g. T. virens, T. flavofuscum). Conidia of most species are ellipsoidal, 3‚Äì5 x 2‚Äì4 ¬µm (L/W = > 1.3); globose conidia (L/W < 1.3) are rare. Conidia are typically smooth but tuberculate to finely warted conidia are known in a few species. Synanamorphs are formed by some species that also have typical Trichoderma pustules. Synanamorphs are recognized by their solitary conidiophores that are verticillately branched and that bear conidia in a drop of clear green liquid at the tip of each phialide. Chlamydospores may be produced by all species, but not all species produce chlamydospores on CMD at 20 ¬∞C within 10 days. Chlamydospores are typically unicellular subglobose and terminate short hyphae; they may also be formed within hyphal cells. Chlamydospores of some species are multicellular (e.g. T. stromaticum). Trichoderma genomes appear to be in the 30‚Äì40 Mb range, with approximately 12,000 genes being identifiable. Teleomorph Teleomorphs of Trichoderma are species of the ascomycete genus Hypocrea. These are characterized by the formation of fleshy, stromata in shades of light or dark brown, yellow or orange. Typically the stroma is discoidal to pulvinate and limited in extent but stromata of some species are effused, sometimes covering extensive areas. Stromata of some species (Podostroma) are clavate or turbinate. Perithecia are completely immersed. Ascospores are bicellular but disarticulate at the septum early in development into 16 part-ascospores so that the ascus appears to contain 16 ascospores. Ascospores are hyaline or green and typically spinulose. More than 200 species of Hypocrea have been described but few have been grown in pure culture and even fewer have been described in modern terms. Occurrence Trichoderma colony in nature Trichoderma species are frequently isolated from forest or agricultural soils at all latitudes. Hypocrea species are most frequently found on bark or on decorticated wood but many species grow on bracket fungi (e.g. H. pulvinata), Exidia (H. sulphurea) or bird's nest fungi (H. latizonata) or agarics (H. avellanea). Biocontrol agent Several strains of Trichoderma have been developed as biocontrol agents against fungal diseases of plants. The various mechanisms include antibiosis, parasitism, inducing host-plant resistance, and competition. Most biocontrol agents are from the species T. asperellum, T. harzianum, T. viride and T. hamatum. The biocontrol agent generally grows in its natural habitat on the root surface, and so affects root disease in particular, but can also be effective against foliar diseases. Causal agent of disease T. aggressivum (formerly T. harzianum biotype 4) is the causal agent of green mold, a disease of cultivated button mushrooms. Pennsylvania State University extension bulletin Trichoderma viride is the causal agent of green mold rot of onion. A strain of Trichoderma viride is a known cause of dieback of Pinus nigra seedlings. =Toxic house mold= The common house mold, Trichoderma longibrachiatum, produces small toxic peptides containing amino acids not found in common proteins, like alpha-aminoisobutyric acid, called trilongins (up to 10% w/w). Their toxicity is due to absorption into cells and production of nano-channels that obstruct vital ion channels that ferry potassium and sodium ions across the cell membrane. This affects in the cells action potential profile, as seen in cardiomyocytes, pneumocytes and neurons leading to conduction defects. Trilongins are highly resistant to heat and antimicrobials making primary prevention the only management option.Reason Discovered for the Toxicity of Indoor Mould ‚Äì ScienceDaily (Oct. 12, 2012) : https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/10/121012074655.htm‚ÄúTrilongins‚Äù Offer Insight into Mold Toxicity Environmental health perspectives 2/2013. Medical uses Cyclosporine A (CsA), a calcineurin inhibitor produced by the fungi Trichoderma polysporum, Tolypocladium inflatum and Cylindrocarpon lucidum, is an immunosuppressant prescribed in organ transplants to prevent rejection. Industrial use Trichoderma, being a saprophyte adapted to thrive in diverse situations, produces a wide array of enzymes. By selecting strains that produce a particular kind of enzyme, and culturing these in suspension, industrial quantities of enzyme can be produced. * Trichoderma reesei is used to produce cellulase and hemicellulase * Trichoderma longibrachiatum is used to produce xylanase * Trichoderma harzianum is used to produce chitinase.

Little more is known than that Carter was from Clerkenwell in London as stated in the title page of the first edition. Her book was first published around 1765 in London by Francis Newbery, who was based in a printing enclave around St Paul's Cathedral. He was the nephew of John Newbery, after whom the Newbery Medal for children's books was named. The book was also published in 1765 in Dublin, and was first reprinted in North America in 1772 by Benjamin Edes and John Gill in Boston, illustrated with prints made by Paul Revere. The book strongly influenced the first cookery book by an American author, Amelia Simmons's American Cookery (1796), in parts almost identical content. An appendix was added to the 1803 American edition, supplementing \\"receipts\\" [recipes] \\"adapted to the American mode of cooking\\" - such as Indian puddings, buckwheat cakes, pumpkin pie, maple molasses, and maple beer. The appendix may have been translated from a Swedish book, Rural Oeconomy: an identical appendix appears in an 1805 edition of Hannah Glasse's The Art of Cookery (originally published in 1747). Confusingly, a completely different book with the same title was written by Lydia Maria (Francis) Child; its popularity may be reason why it remained in print from 1829 to 1855. Child's The Frugal Housewife was also published in London and Glasgow from 1832 to 1834. In 1832 to avoid the confusion, Child changed her title to The American Frugal Housewife. She wrote of the usefulness of Carter's book for Americans: \\"It was the intention of the author of the American Frugal Housewife, to have given an Appendix from the English Frugal Housewife; but upon examination, she found the book so little fitted to the wants of this country, that she has been able to extract but little.\\" References Further reading * Botein, Stephen. \\"The Anglo-American Book Trade before 1776: Personnel and Strategies\\".

Rif Fort, Otrobanda Otrobanda located at the southwest of Willemstad is one of the historically quarters of the city centre in Cura√ßao. The district was developed in the 18th century and picked up in the early 19th century when the once walled city of Punda became overpopulated. Otrobanda was connected to Punda in 1888 via the Queen Emma Bridge (affectionately known as \\"The Swinging Old Lady\\") and in 1974 by the Queen Juliana Bridge. The main center of Willemstad is separated in two quarters: Punda and Otrobanda, which stands for 'city' and 'the other side'. Kura Hulanda is one of the best historical restorations in Otrobanda. Many of the over 700 UNESCO listed buildings in Willemstad have been restored and or renovated (on the inside) to serve as homes, shops, offices and accommodations like Poppy Hostel Curacao. The restored area now shelters Rif Fort Village, a shopping and entertainment center that offers panoramic views of Punda and the sea. The Brionplein (Brion Plaza) is the centerpiece of Otrobanda‚Äôs waterfront. There are two major hotels currently under construction in otrobanda of which the Corendon and Courtyard by Marriott.  Rif Fort  The Rif Fort is a 19th-century defense monument which was built to protect the island from the invasion of pirates and enemies. Its key location was centered in the heart of Cura√ßao. It lies at the entrance of the Sint Anna Bay in the western Otrobanda neighborhood. Rif Fort is made of 1.5-meter thick coral walls that once stored over 56 cannons. Today, Rif Fort is a tourist attraction that features great local restaurants, live entertainment, trendy bars with Latin and Caribbean music and the rough waves that smash through the ends of the walls. The Fort was redeveloped by the Renaissance Cura√ßao Resort and Casino. Locals and tourists visit this site frequently.

Other methods include the Rayleigh-Ritz method. Whirling of a shaft No shaft can ever be perfectly straight or perfectly balanced. When an element of mass is offset from the axis of rotation, centrifugal force will tend to pull the mass outward. The elastic properties of the shaft will act to restore the ‚Äústraightness‚Äù. If the frequency of rotation is equal to one of the resonant frequencies of the shaft, whirling will occur. In order to save the machine from failure, operation at such whirling speeds must be avoided. Whirling is a complex phenomenon that can include harmonics but we are only going to consider synchronous whirl, where the frequency of whirling is the same as the rotational speed.

The Worldview Literacy Book Parthenon Books 2009. Excerpt at http://www.projectworldview.org/wvtheme46.htm Some references define technological fix as an \\"attempt to repair the harm of a technology by modification of the system\\", that might involve modification of the machine and/or modification of the procedures for operating and maintaining it. Technological fixes are inevitable in modern technology. It has been observed that many technologies, although invented and developed to solve certain perceived problems, often create other problems in the process, known as externalities. In other words, there would be modification of the basic hardware, modification of techniques and procedures, or both.The sacred and the limits of the technological fix AR Drengson - Zygon¬Æ, 1984 - Wiley Online Library The technological fix is the idea that all problems can find solutions in better and new technologies. It now is used as a dismissive phrase to describe cheap, quick fixes by using inappropriate technologies; these fixes often create more problems than they solve, or give people a sense that they have solved the problem.The Technological Fix Critique of Agricultural Biotechnology, D Scott, http://wiki.umt.edu/odc/images/d/db/TechFixISU6-25.pdf Contemporary context In the contemporary context, technological fix is sometimes used to refer to the idea of using data and intelligent algorithms to supplement and improve human decision making in hope that this would result in ameliorating the bigger problem. One critic, Evgeny Morozov defines this as \\"Recasting all complex social situations either as neat problems with definite, computable solutions or as transparent and self-evident processes that can be easily optimized--if only the right algorithms are in place.\\"E. Morozov, To Save Everything, Click Here (2013), pg 5 While some criticizes this approach to the issues of today as detrimental to efforts to truly solve these problems, opponents finds merits in such approach to technological improvement of our society as complements to existing activists and policy efforts. An example of the criticism is how policy makers may be tempted to think that installing smart energy monitors would help people conserve energy better, thus improving global warming, rather than focusing on the arduous process of passing laws to tax carbon, etc. Another example is thinking of obesity as a lifestyle choice of eating high caloric foods and not exercising enough, rather than viewing obesity as more of a social and class problem where individuals are predisposed to eat certain kind of foods (due to the lack of affordable health-supporting food in urban food deserts), to lack optimally evidence-based health behaviors, and lack of proper health care to mitigate behavioral outcomes.E. Morozov, To Save Everything, Click Here (2013)  Climate change  The technological fix for climate change is an example of the use of technology to restore the environment. This can be seen through various different strategies such as: geo-engineering and renewable energy. = Geo-engineering = Geo-engineering is referred as \\"the artificial modification of Earth's climate systems through two primary ideologies, Solar Radiation Management (SRM) and Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR)\\". Different schemes, projects and technologies have been designed to tackle the effects of climate change, usually by removing CO2 from the air as seen by Klaus Lackner's invention of a Co2 prototype, or by limiting the amount of sunlight that reaches the Earth's surface, by space mirrors. However, \\"critics by contrast claim that geoengineering isn't realistic ‚Äì and may be a distraction from reducing emissions.\\" It has been argued that geo-engineering is an adaptation to global warming. It allows TNC's, humans and governments to avoid facing the facts that global warming is a crisis that needs to be dealt with head-on by reducing emissions and implementing green technologies, rather than developing ways to control the environment and ultimately allow Greenhouse Gases to continue to be released into the atmosphere. = Renewable energy = 189x189px Renewable Energy is also another example of a technological fix, as technology is being used in attempts to reduce and mitigate the effects of global warming. Renewable Energy refers to technologies that has been designed to be eco-friendly and efficient for the well-being of the Earth. They are generally regarded as infinite energy sources, which means they will never run out, unlike fossil fuels such as oil and coal, which are finite sources of energy. They additionally release no green house gases such as carbon dioxide, which is harmful for the planet as it depletes the ozone layer. Examples of renewable energy can be seen by wind turbines, solar energy such as solar panels and kinetic energy from waves. These energies are regarded as a technological fix as they have been designed and innovated to overcome issues with energy insecurity, as well as to help protect Earth from the harmful emissions released from non-renewable energy sources, and thus overcome global warming. It is also known that such technologies will in turn require their own technological fixes. For example, some types of solar energy have local impacts on ambient temperature, which can be a hazard to birdlife.  Food famine  It has been made explicit within society that the world's population is rapidly increasing, with the \\"UNICEF estimating that an average of 353,000 babies are born each day around the world.\\" Therefore, it is expected that the production of food will not be able to progress and develop to keep up with the needs of species. Ester Boserup highlighted in 1965 that when the human population increases and food production decreases, an innovation will take place. This can be demonstrated in the technological development of hydroponics and genetically modified crops. hydroponics = Hydroponics = Hydroponics is an example of a technological fix. It demonstrates the ability for humans to recognise a problem within society, such as the lack of food for an increasing population, and therefore attempt to fix this problem with the development of an innovative technology. Hydroponics is a method of food production to increase productivity, in an \\"artificial environment.\\" The soil is replaced by a mineral solution that is left around the plant roots. Removing the soil allows a greater crop yield, as there is less chance of soil-borne diseases, as well as being able to monitor plant growth and mineral concentrations. This innovative technology to yield more food reflects the ability for humans to develop their way out of a problem, portraying a technological fix. = Genetically modified organism = Genetically modified organism (GMO) reflect the use of technology to innovate our way out of a problem such as the lack of food to cater for the growing population, demonstrating a technological fix. GM crops can create many advantages, such as higher food fields, added vitamins and increased farm profits. Depending on the modifications, they may also introduce the problem of increasing resistance to pesticides and herbicides, which may inevitably precipitate the need for further fixes in the future.  Golden rice  Golden rice is one example of a technological fix. It demonstrates the ability for humans to develop and innovate themselves out of problems, such as the deficiency of vitamin A in Taiwan and Philippines, in which the World Health Organization reported that about 250 million preschool children are affected by. Through the technological development of GM Crops, scientists were able to develop golden rice that can be grown in these countries with genetically higher levels of beta-carotene (a precursor of vitamin A). This enables healthier and fulfilling lifestyles for these individuals and consequently helps to reduce the deaths caused by the deficiency.  Externalities  Externalities refer to the unforeseen or unintended consequences of technology. It is evident that everything new and innovative can potentially have negative effects, especially if it is a new area of development. Although technologies are invented and developed to solve certain perceived problems, they often create other problems in the process. = DDT = DDT was initially use by the Military in World War II to control a range of different illnesses, varying from Malaria to the bubonic plague and body lice. Due to the efficiency of DDT, it was soon adopted as a farm pesticide to help maximise crop yields to consequently cope with the rising populations food demands post WWII. This pesticide proved to be extremely effective in killing bugs and animals on crops, and was often referred as the \\"wonder-chemical.\\" However, despite being banned for over forty years, we are still facing the externalities of this technology. It was found that DDT had major health impacts on both humans and animals. It was found that DDT accumulated within the fatty cells of both humans and animals and therefore highlights that technological fixes have their negatives as well as positives. DDT being sprayed  Humans  * Breast & other cancers * Male infertility * Miscarriages & low birth weight * Developmental delay * Nervous system & liver damage  Animals  * DDT is toxic to birds when eaten. * Decreases the reproductive rate of birds by causing eggshell thinning and embryo deaths. * Highly toxic to aquatic animals. DDT affects various systems in aquatic animals including the heart and brain. * DDT moderately toxic to amphibians like frogs, toads, and salamanders. Immature amphibians are more sensitive to the effects of DDT than adults. Automobile = Global warming = Global warming can be a natural phenomenon that occurs in long (geologic) cycles. However, it has been found that the release of greenhouse gases through industry and traffic causes the earth to warm. This is causing externalities on the environment, such as melting icecaps, shifting biomes, and extinction of many aquatic species through ocean acidification and changing ocean temperatures.  Automobiles  Automobiles with internal combustion engines have revolutionised civilisation and technology. However, whilst the technology was new and innovative, helping to connect places through the ability of transport, it was not recognised at the time that burning fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, inside the engines would release pollutants. This is an explicit example of an externality caused by a technological fix, as the problems caused from the development of the technology was not recognised at the time.  Different types of technological fixes  = High-tech megaprojects = High-tech megaprojects are large scale and require huge sums of investment and revenue to be created. Examples of these high technologies are Dams, nuclear power plants, and airports. They usually cause externalities on other factors such as the environment, are highly expensive, and are top-down governmental plans. The 176x176px  Three Gorges Dam  The Three Gorges Dam is an example of a high-tech technological fix. The creation of the multi-purpose navigation hydropower and flood control scheme was designed to fix the issues with flooding whilst providing efficient, clean renewable hydro-electric power in China. The Three Gorges Dam is the world's largest power station in terms of installed capacity (22,500 MW). The dam is the largest operating hydroelectric facility in terms of annual energy generation, generating 83.7 TWh in 2013 and 98.8 TWh in 2014, while the annual energy generation of the Itaip√∫ Dam in Brazil and Paraguay was 98.6 TWh in 2013 and 87.8 in 2014. It was estimated to have cost over ¬£25 billion. There have been many externalities from this technology, such as the extinction of the Chinese River Dolphin, an increase in pollution, as the river can no longer 'flush' itself, and over 4 million locals being displaced in the area. = Intermediate technology = Rainwater harvesting Is usually small-scale and cheap technologies that are usually seen in developing countries. The capital to build and create these technologies are usually low, yet labour is high. Local expertise can be used to maintain these technologies making them very quick and effective to build and repair. An example of an intermediate technology can be seen by water wells, rain barrels and pumpkin tanks. = Appropriate technologies = Technology that suits the level of income, skills and needs of the people. Therefore, this factor encompasses both high and low technologies. An example of this can be seen by developing countries that implement technologies that suit their expertise, such as rain barrels and hand pumps. These technologies are low costing and can be maintained by local skills, making them affordable and efficient. However, to implement rain barrels in a developed country would not be appropriate, as it would not suit the technological advancement apparent in these countries. Therefore, appropriate technological fixes take into consideration the level of development within a country before implementing them. Concerns Michael and Joyce Huesemann caution against the hubris of large-scale techno-fixes In the book Techno-Fix: Why Technology Won't Save Us Or the Environment they show why negative unintended consequences of science and technology are inherently unavoidable and unpredictable, why counter- technologies or techno-fixes are no lasting solutions, and why modern technology in current context does not promote sustainability but instead collapse. Naomi Klein is a prominent opponent of the view that simply technological fixes will solve our problems. She explained her concerns in her book This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. the Climate and states that technical fixes for climate change such as geoengineering bring significant risks as \\"we simply don't know enough about the Earth system to be able to re- engineer it safely\\". According to her the proposed technique of dimming the rays of the sun with sulphate-spraying helium balloons in order to mimic the cooling effect on the atmosphere of large volcanic eruptions for instance is highly dangerous and such schemes will surely be attempted if abrupt climate change gets seriously under way. Various experts and environmental groups have also come forward with their concerns over views and approaches that look for techno fixes as solutions and warn that those would be \\"misguided, unjust, profoundly arrogant and endlessly dangerous\\" approaches as well as over the prospect of a technological 'fix' for global warming, however impractical, causing lessened political pressure for a real solution.

They are named after the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid, because their definition relies on an idea in Euclid's proof that there are infinitely many primes, and after Albert A. Mullin, who asked about the sequence in 1963.. The first 51 elements of the sequence are :2, 3, 7, 43, 13, 53, 5, 6221671, 38709183810571, 139, 2801, 11, 17, 5471, 52662739, 23003, 30693651606209, 37, 1741, 1313797957, 887, 71, 7127, 109, 23, 97, 159227, 643679794963466223081509857, 103, 1079990819, 9539, 3143065813, 29, 3847, 89, 19, 577, 223, 139703, 457, 9649, 61, 4357, 87991098722552272708281251793312351581099392851768893748012603709343, 107, 127, 3313, 227432689108589532754984915075774848386671439568260420754414940780761245893, 59, 31, 211... These are the only known elements . Finding the next one requires finding the least prime factor of a 335-digit number (which is known to be composite). Definition The nth element of the sequence, a_n, is the least prime factor of :\\\\Bigl(\\\\prod_{i < n} a_i\\\\Bigr)+1\\\\,. The first element is therefore the least prime factor of the empty product plus one, which is 2\\\\. The third element is (2 √ó 3) + 1 = 7. A better illustration is the fifth element in the sequence, 13. This is calculated by (2 √ó 3 √ó 7 √ó 43) + 1 = 1806 + 1 = 1807, the product of two primes, 13 √ó 139\\\\. Of these two primes, 13 is the smallest and so included in the sequence. Similarly, the seventh element, 5, is the result of (2 √ó 3 √ó 7 √ó 43 √ó 13 √ó 53) + 1 = 1,244,335, the prime factors of which are 5 and 248,867. These examples illustrate why the sequence can leap from very large to very small numbers. Properties The sequence is infinitely long and does not contain repeated elements. This can be proved using the method of Euclid's proof that there are infinitely many primes. That proof is constructive, and the sequence is the result of performing a version of that construction. Conjecture asked whether every prime number appears in the Euclid‚ÄìMullin sequence and, if not, whether the problem of testing a given prime for membership in the sequence is computable. conjectured, on the basis of heuristic assumptions that the distribution of primes is random, that every prime does appear in the sequence.. However, although similar recursive sequences over other domains do not contain all primes,. these problems both remain open for the original Euclid‚ÄìMullin sequence.. The least prime number not known to be an element of the sequence is 41. The positions of the prime numbers from 2 to 97 are: : 2:1, 3:2, 5:7, 7:3, 11:12, 13:5, 17:13, 19:36, 23:25, 29:33, 31:50, 37:18, 41:?, 43:4, 47:?, 53:6, 59:49, 61:42, 67:?, 71:22, 73:?, 79:?, 83:?, 89:35, 97:26 where ? indicates that the position (or whether it exists at all) is unknown as of 2012.The listing with the question marks is given in the Extensions field of the OEIS entry, whereas the main listing stops at 33 and has no question marks. Related sequences A related sequence of numbers determined by the largest prime factor of one plus the product of the previous numbers (rather than the smallest prime factor) is also known as the Euclid‚ÄìMullin sequence. It grows more quickly, but is not monotonic.. The numbers in this sequence are :2, 3, 7, 43, 139, 50207, 340999, 2365347734339, 4680225641471129, 1368845206580129, 889340324577880670089824574922371, ‚Ä¶ . Not every prime number appears in this sequence, and the sequence of missing primes, :5, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, ... has been proven to be infinite... It is also possible to generate modified versions of the Euclid‚ÄìMullin sequence by using the same rule of choosing the smallest prime factor at each step, but beginning with a different prime than 2. Alternatively, taking each number to be one plus the product of the previous numbers (rather than factoring it) gives Sylvester's sequence. The sequence constructed by repeatedly appending all factors of one plus the product of the previous numbers is the same as the sequence of prime factors of Sylvester's sequence. Like the Euclid‚ÄìMullin sequence, this is a non-monotonic sequence of primes, but it is known not to include all primes..

The Almadas were not of noble blood, but descended from a merchant family that made their fortune in overseas trade.Moreno, p.999; Costa-Lobo (1904: p.487) The Lordship of Almada they had acquired was expropriated during the 1383‚Äì1385 Crisis, although Jo√£o Vaz's notable military service to John I of Portugal earned him partial reinstatement and rewards in other districts. The family resided primarily in Lisbon and Alg√©s. √Ålvaro had a younger brother named Pedro Vaz de Almada and two half-siblings, born out of wedlock, by an unknown mother: Jo√£o Vaz de Almada, 1st Lord of Pereira (born c.1400) and Brites de Almada. At an early age, √Ålvaro accompanied his father to the Kingdom of England. Both were said to have fought in the Hundred Years' War and built up a rapport with King Henry V of England, before returning to Portugal in early 1415.Moreno, p.999  Career  Shortly after returning from England, √Ålvaro fought alongside his father at the conquest of Ceuta in 1415, and was knighted in the aftermath by the Portuguese royal prince Peter, Duke of Coimbra. This was the beginning of a long association and friendship between the two men. In June 1423, √Ålvaro was appointed by John I of Portugal as capit√£o-mor da frota (admiral of the sail fleet). The letter of appointment gave him unusually extensive powers, encroaching on areas normally reserved to the Admiral of Portugal (admiral of the galley fleet), thereby making Almada the de facto head of the entire Portuguese navy.Quintella, p.41-42 In the late 1420s, √Ålvaro Vaz de Almada accompanied Peter, Duke of Coimbra on his famous tour of Europe, and fought alongside him against the Turks in Hungary on behalf of Emperor Sigismund. He was back in Portugal by 1433, when his term as capit√£o-mor was renewed.Quintella, p.82 He participated in several small naval encounters off Ceuta. During the 1430s, he was rewarded by King Edward of Portugal with more sinecures, including a share of the taxes imposed on the Jews of the kingdom.Moreno,p.100 √Ålvaro Vaz de Almada was one of the leaders of the ill- fated 1437 Tangier expedition. Organized and led by Prince Henry the Navigator, the expedition was a fiasco. After several hopeless assaults on the walls of Tangier, the Portuguese expeditionary force was defeated and starved into submission by the Marinid armies of Morocco. Nonetheless, Almada distinguished himself in the encounter, and was given the honor (shared with the marshal, Vasco Fernandes Coutinho) of being the last man to leave the beach. During the regency crisis of 1438-39, √Ålvaro Vaz de Almada was one of the first to line up behind Peter of Coimbra, and instrumental in gathering more supporters to his cause. During the popular tumults, in September 1439, the people of Lisbon elected Almada as the alferes-mor (standard-bearer) and spokesman of the city.Moreno, p.1002 In recognition of his efforts, the new regent Peter appointed Almada as a member of his royal council and alcaide-mor of the Castle of S√£o Jorge in Lisbon in April, 1440.  England  Dom √Ålvaro Vaz de Almada's coat-of-arms (nr. 162) displayed at St. George's Hall, Windsor Castle. He was made the 162nd Knight of the Garter. √Ålvaro Vaz de Almada returned to England after 1415 but it is not known how often or when. In August 8, 1444, King Henry VI of England issued a royal letter ennobling √Ålvaro Vaz de Almada as the 1st Count of Avranches. Avranches was one of the few remaining Plantagenet ruled towns in Normandy; the title was translated by Portuguese writers as the Conde de Abranches. The letter cited his distinguished service to the English crown in the reigns of both Henry V and Henry VI. Simultaneously, he was appointed the 162nd Knight of the Most Noble Order of the Garter in 1445. Almada was one of the few foreigners not of royal blood to become a member of the illustrious English knightly order, and the only Portuguese to receive a hereditary English title. In addition to these honors, Henry VI granted Almada an annual life pension of one hundred marks, as well as a gift, a gold cup with one hundred gold marks inside.Moreno, p.1003-04 News of Almada's career in England filtered inchoatly into the Portuguese popular chivalric legend of the Twelve of England (Os Doze de Inglaterra). A semi-legendary tale made famous by Lu√≠s de Cam√µes in his Os Lus√≠adas, it is set during the reign of John I, and relates how twelve (or thirteen) Portuguese knights went to England to repair an offense made to some ladies of the household of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster. Almada is traditionally identified as one of the twelve knights (even though the year proposed by the legend - if it happened at all - would have been c.1390, when Almada was merely a newborn infant.) The Battle of Alfarrobeira In 1448, King Afonso V of Portugal reached majority and dismissed the regency of Peter of Coimbra. However, under the influence of Afonso of Barcelos-Braganza, the king immediately set about undoing all of Peter's regency acts and dismissing all his appointees, often accompanied by dubious legal proceedings to further dispossess them. The vacated nobles and bureaucrats turned to Peter for redress. left √Ålvaro Vaz de Almada, then in Ceuta, returned to Portugal in September 1448, to support the embattled Peter. For daring to speak up in Peter's defense in court, Almada was dispossessed of the alcaide of Lisbon in December, 1448.Moreno, p.1004. Almada further enraged the king by leading a contingent of Peter's retainers to Coja, on the edge of Peter's Duchy of Coimbra, to block the passage of Afonso of Barcelos-Braganza through his friend's property. Although Afonso was carrying more men, the military reputation of Almada was such that Afonso decided to take a circuitous route rather than force the issue.Moreno, p.1005 In May, 1449, Peter of Coimbra, accompanied by Almada, set out from Coimbra, leading his men in a march on Lisbon - according to Peter, a peaceful march to demand that he and his dismissed appointees be given a chance to defend themselves in court. But Afonso of Barcelos-Braganza warned that Peter and Almada were intending to lay siege to Lisbon, and would likely use their connections to provoke an uprising within the city. Afonso V, alarmed, declared them rebels and traitors and set out with an army against him. Almada's own half-brother, Jo√£o Vaz de Almada (Lord of Pereira and vedor of palace) was among the king's host. The armies met on May 20, 1449 at the Battle of Alfarrobeira (around Alverca do Ribatejo). It is said that Peter and Almada had sworn a personal oath not to survive each other. Peter was killed early in the encounter. Almada, hearing the news from a page, ordered him not to reveal it to the rest of the army. Then, after taking brief refreshment, Almada (who was now in his fifties) marched forward into the thick of the fight. Soon recognized, Almada was quickly surrounded by the king's soldiers, but refused to surrender. He struck down all who approached him, until, at last, exhausted, he uttered his famous exclamation \\"My body, I feel you can no more; and you, my soul, already delay.\\" (\\"Meu corpo, sinto que n√£o podes mais; e tu, minh' alma, j√° tardas.\\"), lowered his weapon and fell to the ground, spitting out his famous last words \\"now indulge yourselves, villains\\" (\\"Ora fartar villanagem\\", now a common Portuguese expression). His enemies fell upon him and finished him. On the king's orders, Almada's body was left decapitated on the battlefield, exposed to the elements, to decay in the open. Only upon the repeated entreaties of Jo√£o Vaz de Almada, did king Afonso V finally consent to allow him to bury his brother's corpse.Moreno,p.1005 Nonetheless, legal proceedings continued against Almada, and much of his property was confiscated. The family seat of Alg√©s went to Jo√£o Vaz de Almada, while much of the remainder was given to the king's counsellor √Ålvaro Pires de T√°vora. Almada's widow, Catarina de Castro (daughter of Fernando de Castro) was only allowed to retain possession of their Lisbon homes as well as the Jewish taxes. Almada's oldest son Jo√£o de Abranches (from Almada's first marriage, who attached \\"Abranches\\" to his surname albeit not possessing the title), inherited what remained of his father's pre-1385 estates that could not be confiscated by the crown. The title of Count of Abrantes and capit√£o-mor da frota was (eventually) recovered by Fernando de Almada, the only son of Almada's second marriage to Catarina de Castro. Marriage and children √Ålvaro Vaz de Almada married twice. From his first marriage (before 2 January 1436) to Isabel da Cunha (daughter of √Ålvaro da Cunha, 3rd Lord of Pombeiro, and Beatriz de Melo), Almada had the following children: *Dom Jo√£o de Abranches (b. c. 1420), married first to Leonor ..., without issue, and married second to his distant relative M√©cia da Cunha (daughter of Vasco da Cunha and wife Maria Rodrigues de Azevedo), and had issue *Dona Leonor da Cunha, a Nun *Dona Violante da Cunha (b. c. 1430), married as his first wife to Dom Fern√£o Martins Mascarenhas, 1st Lord of Lavre and 1st Lord of Estepa (b. c. 1430, d. 1501) (son of Nuno Vaz Mascarenhas and wife Catarina de Ata√≠de), without issue *Dona Isabel da Cunha (b. 1420), married as his first wife to √Ålvaro Pessanha (b. c. 1415) (a bastard son of Carlos Pessanha, 6th Admiral of Portugal, by an unknown woman), and had issue * Dona Brites da Cunha, married to the English nobleman Sir ... de Mabermont Isabel da Cunha died before Almada was ennobled with County of Avranches. Nonetheless, their eldest son attached and used \\"Abranches\\" in his surname (he did not inherit the title, however). From his second marriage (on August 4, 1445) to Dona Catarina de Castro (daughter of Dom Fernando de Castro, governor of the household of Prince Henry the Navigator and his wife Isabel de Ata√≠de): * Fernando de Almada, 2nd Count of Avranches (b. c. 1430, d. April 29, 1496), married in 1463 to Dona Constan√ßa de Noronha, 5th Lady of Lagares de El-Rei (b. c. 1435), and had issue, also had two children born out of wedlock by an unknown mother Almada's second wife, Catarina de Castro, later remarried her first cousin, Dom Martinho de Ata√≠de, 2nd Count of Atouguia (with no issue). The Avranches/Abranches are sometimes confused with unrelated families named after \\"Abrantes\\", a town in Portugal.  References  Sources * Costa L√¥bo, A.

This type of access does not entail any third-party access to the copper pair in the local loop. ‚Äì Network Neutrality Revisited: Challenges and Responses in the EU and in the US The incumbent may also provide transmission services to its competitors, using its Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) or IP network, to carry competitors' traffic from the digital subscriber line access multiplexer (DSLAM) to a higher level in the network hierarchy where new entrants may already have a point of presence (e.g. a transit switch location). Bit-stream handover points thus can be at various levels: * Handover at DSLAM * Handover at ATM-PoP * Handover at IP level Bit-stream access is nowadays considered a key tool for opening competition in the broadband market. It enables competitors to offer their own products to consumers even if they do not operate the local loop (the last mile). Bit- stream access allows the new entrant to use the high-speed modems and other equipment provided by the incumbent and thus avoid maintenance and investments into the local loop. This affects the economics of the service and places restrictions on the type of modems that the customer of the new entrant can buy or rent. The main elements defining bit-stream access are the following: * High-speed access link to the customer premises (end user part) provided by the incumbent and transmission capacity for broadband data in both direction, enabling new entrants to offer their own, value-added services to end users; * New entrants have the possibility to differentiate their services by altering technical characteristics and/or the use of their own network. Thus, bit- stream access is a wholesale product consisting of the access (typically ADSL) and ‚Äúbackhaul‚Äù services of the (data) backbone network (ATM, IP backbone).  EU regulation  Unlike unbundled access, the provision of bit-stream access services is not mandated under European Union law, but where an incumbent operator provides bit-stream DSL services to its own services, subsidiary or third party, then, in accordance with community law, it must also provide such forms of access under transparent and non-discriminatory terms or conditions to others (Directive 98/10/EC Article 16). Bit-stream access service allows the incumbent to retain control of the rate of deployment of high-speed access services, and the geographical regions in which these service are rolled out. From the regulatory point of view, such services are therefore seen as complementing the other forms of unbundled access, but not substituting them. Bit stream general model  * Backhauling: is the physical linking of Telecommunications Terminal Equipment and/or licensed ISP Networks to Public Telecommunications Networks in order to allow Users of the licensed ISP Networks or the Users of the Telecommunications Terminal Equipment to communicate with Users of a Public Telecommunications Network or Users of the same or another licensed ISP Networks or to access services provided on a Public Telecommunications Network as appropriate * Points of interconnections: are the border physical connections between licensed Internet Service Provider, and the Access Network of a Telecommunication Network, marked as the demarcation zone, and the aim is to allow the licensed Internet Service Providers to acquire logical port capacity to serve IP stream and access services provided on a Public Telecommunications Network as appropriate.

The program was initially written by Joe Taylor, K1JT, but is now open source and is developed by a small team. The digital signal processing techniques in WSJT make it substantially easier for amateur radio operators to employ esoteric propagation modes, such as high speed meteor scatter and moonbounce.  History  WSJT was originally released in 2001 and has undergone several major revisions. Communication modes have been both added and removed from the software over the course of its development. Since 2005, the software has been released as open source software under the GNU General Public License. This licensing change required substantial rewrites and took several months to complete. Although Joe Taylor was the original developer (and still acts as maintainer), several programmers are currently involved in writing the software. Currently, the program is written in Python and C, with several utilities written in Fortran. WSJT versions up through 7.06 r1933 (referred to as colloquially as WSJT7) and earlier were aggregations of previous versions, and as such WSJT7 contained 16 different modes (FSK441, JT6M, JT65 variants A - C, JT2, JT4 variants A - G, WSPR, and a preview of JT64A). As of version 8.0 (referred to as colloquially as WSJT8) the available modes changed completely such that WSJT8 now offers 5 different modes (JTMS, ISCAT, JT64A, JT8, and Echo) -- none of which are back-compatible with WSJT7 or earlier releases. This backwards-incompatibility includes JT64A, such that the preview release of JT64A in WSJT7 cannot communicate with the stable release of JT64A in WSJT8. , the latest WSJT version is WSJT10.  Communication modes provided  The software carries a general emphasis on weak-signal operation and advanced DSP techniques; however, the communication modes rely upon different ionospheric propagation modes and may be used on many different bands. WSJT's communication modes can be divided into fast and slow modes. While fast modes send character-by-character without error correction, the slow modes aim to optimize for minimal QRO (high-power) use. As of WSJT10, supported fast modes are JTMS, FSK441, ISCAT, and JT6M, and the slow modes are JT65 and JT4. WSJT-X 1.8 additionally implements the \\"slow\\" JT9, FT8, and QRA64. Some modes have derived submodes with larger tone spacing. Two other modes, WSPR and Echo are included for measuring propagation and testing moon bounce echo. = FSK441 = FSK441, introduced in 2001 as the first communications mode included with WSJT, is designed to support communication using streaks of radio-reflecting ions created in the ionosphere by the trails of meteors entering the Earth's atmosphere. The bursts of signal created by such trails are commonly referred to as ‚Äúpings‚Äù, due to their characteristic sound. Such pings may be as short as a tenth of a second and carry enough information to complete at least one stage of a contact. FSK441 employs multi-frequency shift keying using four tones, at a data rate of 441 baud. Because of the choice of character codes in the protocol, it is self- synchronizing and does not require an explicit synchronization tone. FSK441 is generally used on the 2-meter and 70-centimeter amateur bands. Contacts may be made at almost any time (that is, a meteor shower is not required to be in progress) at distances of up to 1400 miles (2250 km). When transmitted messages include at least one space, the FSK441 decoding algorithm uses that space character as a syncword for zero-overhead synchronization. Joseph H Taylor, Jr, K1JT. \\"WSJT User Guide\\". Mode is no longer part of wsjt-x v.2.1.2. = JT6M = JT6M, introduced in late 2002, is intended for meteor scatter and other ionospheric scattering of signals, and is especially optimized for the 6-meter band. The mode also employs multiple frequency-shift keying, but at 44 tones. One of the tones is a synchronization tone, leaving 43 tones to carry data (one tone per character in the character set, which includes alphanumerics and some punctuation). The symbol rate is 21.53 baud; the actual data rate as encoded for transmit is 14.4 characters per second. The mode is known for sounding \\"a bit like piccolo music\\". Mode is no longer part of wsjt-x v.2.1.2. = JT65 = JT65, developed and released in late 2003, is intended for extremely weak but slowly varying signals, such as those found on troposcatter or Earth-Moon-Earth (EME, or \\"moonbounce\\") paths. It can decode signals many decibels below the noise floor in a 2500 Hz band (note that SNR in a 2500 Hz band is approximately 28 dB lower than SNR in a 4 Hz band, which is closer to the channel bandwidth of an individual JT65 tone), and can often allow amateurs to successfully exchange contact information without signals being audible to the human ear. Like the other modes, multiple-frequency shift keying is employed; unlike the other modes, messages are transmitted as atomic units after being compressed and then encoded with a process known as forward error correction (or \\"FEC\\"). The FEC adds redundancy to the data, such that all of a message may be successfully recovered even if some bits are not received by the receiver. (The particular code used for JT65 is Reed-Solomon.) Because of this FEC process, messages are either decoded correctly or not decoded at all, with very high probability. After messages are encoded, they are transmitted using MFSK with 65 tones. Operators have also begun using the JT65 mode for contacts on the HF bands, often using QRP (very low transmit power); while the mode was not originally intended for such use, its popularity has resulted in several new features being added to WSJT in order to facilitate HF operation. = JT9 = JT9, intended for MF and HF use, was introduced in an experimental version of WSJT, known as WSJT-X. It uses the same logical encoding as JT65, but modulates to a 9-FSK signal. With 1-minute transmission intervals, JT9 occupies less than 16 Hz bandwidth. JT9 also has versions designed for longer transmission intervals of 2 minutes, 5 minutes, 10 minutes or 30 minutes. These extended versions take increasingly less bandwidth and permit reception of even weaker signals. =FT8 = Joe Taylor, K1JT, announced on June 29, 2017 the availability of a new mode in the WSJT-X software, FT8. FT8 stands for \\"Franke-Taylor design, 8-FSK modulation\\" and was created by Joe Taylor, K1JT and Steve Franke, K9AN. It is described as being designed for \\"multi-hop Es where signals may be weak and fading, openings may be short, and you want fast completion of reliable, confirmable QSO's\\". According to Taylor, the important characteristics of FT8 are ‚Äî * T/R sequence length: 15 s * Message length: 75 bits + 12-bit CRC * FEC code: (174,87)LDPC * Modulation: 8-FSK, keying rate = tone spacing = 6.25 Hz * Waveform: Continuous phase, constant envelope * Occupied bandwidth: 50 Hz * Synchronization: three 7x7 Costas arrays (start, middle, end of transmission) * Transmission duration: 79*1920/12000 = 12.64 s * Decoding threshold: -20 dB (perhaps -24 dB with a priori decoding, TBD) * Operational behavior: similar to HF usage of JT9, JT65 * Multi-decoder: finds and decodes all FT8 signals in passband * Auto-sequencing after manual start of QSO Compared to the so-called \\"slow modes\\" (JT9, JT65, QRA64), FT8 is a few decibels less sensitive, but allows completion of QSOs four times faster. Bandwidth is greater than JT9, but about one-quarter of JT65A and less than one-half of QRA64. Compared with the \\"fast modes\\" (JT9E-H), FT8 is significantly more sensitive, has much narrower bandwidth, uses the vertical waterfall, and offers multi-decoding over the full displayed passband. Features not yet implemented include signal subtraction, two-pass decoding, and use of a priori (already known) information as it accumulates during a QSO.\\" =FT4= In 2019, Taylor, et al, introduced FT4, an experimental protocol which is similar to FT8 but has a shorter T/R sequence length for faster contest exchanges.The FT4 Protocol for Digital Contesting April 2019 Alternative software for JT65 There are alternative software packages available for JT65 including MultiPSK (a commercial package developed by F6CTE), and JT65-HF HB9HQX Edition (a free software package forked from the JT65-HF project developed by W6CQZ). The JT65-HF HB9HQX Edition software, along with the source code, may be obtained from Sourceforge. An article series on using the original JT65-HF software appeared in CQ Amateur Radio's October & November 2010 issues. And MSHV from LZ2HV recompiled from source code of WSJT-X with different GUI implementation both for Linux and Windows OS.

This theory opposes the notion that one‚Äôs aptitude is unchangeable. Striving for learning goals motivates an individual to be engaged in activities with a commitment to learning. * Children learn the standards values, and knowledge of society by raising questions and accepting challenges to find solutions that are not immediately apparent. Other learning processes are explaining concepts, justifying their reasoning and seeking information. Therefore, learning is a social process which requires social and cultural factors to be considered during instructional planning. This social nature of learning also drives the determination of the learning goals. * Knowledge and learning are situated in particular physical and social context. A range of settings may be used such as the home, the community, and the workplace, depending on the purpose of instruction and the intended learning goals. * Knowledge may be viewed as distributed or stretched over the individual, other persons, and various artifacts such as physical and symbolic tools and not solely as a property of individuals. Thus, people, as an integral part of the learning process, must share knowledge and tasks.  Assessment  One of the main goals of contextual learning is to develop an authentic task to assess performance. Creating an assessment in a context can help to guide the teacher to replicate real world experiences and make necessary inclusive design decisions. Contextual learning can be used as a form of formative assessment and can help give educators a stronger profile on how the intended learning goals, standards and benchmarks fit the curriculum. It is essential to establish and align the intended learning goals of the contextual task at the beginning to create a shared understanding of what success looks like. Self- directed theory states that humans by nature seek purpose and the desire to make a contribution and to be part of a cause greater and more enduring then oneself. Contextual learning can help bring relevance and meaning to the learning, helping students relate to the world they live in. Questions to address when defining and developing a contextual task  * Does the task fulfill the intended learning goals? * Does the task involve problems that require the students to use their knowledge creatively to find a solution? * Is the task an engaging learning experience? * Is the audience as authentic as possible? * Does the task require students to use processes, products and procedures that simulate those used by people working in a similar field? * Is the task inclusive? * Are there clear criteria for students on how the product, performance or service will be evaluated? * Are there models of excellence which demonstrate standards? * Are the students involved in the assessment process? * Is there a provision made for continuous formative feedback, from oneself, from teachers and peers to help the students improve? * Is there an opportunity for student choice and ownership to the extent that would be.

In the pre- independence phase, bird exploration was first carried out in the mid-18th century. The naming of the Cacatua sulphurea citrinocristata by Fraser in 1844 and Larius roratus cornelia by Bonaparte in 1853, shows that at least two of the journal's authors had studied the Sumbanese bird a century before independence. Next, several other researchers arrived until 1944. Ernst Mayr was the last researcher in the pre-independence era. He noted there were 121 species of birds on Sumba. After Indonesian independence, E.R Sutter went on an expedition to Sumba in 1949. However, until three decades later, no ornithologist was involved in bird research on Sumba.

It still operates a bank account at Drummonds Bank (now part of Royal Bank of Scotland) which was opened by its first secretary, Michael Christian Festing, in November 1738. The Fund received patronage from George III, and it was incorporated by Royal Charter in 1790. Funds were raised by holding charity concerts, musical dinners, and music festival. Liszt gave his first concert in England for the benefit of the Society in 1824, aged 12. It also held performances by Mendelssohn, Moscheles, and Dvo≈ô√°k. Meyerbeer, Liszt, and Clara Schumann all became members. A Society of Female Musicians was formed in 1840, but merged with the Royal Society in 1866. In the days before the welfare state, membership of the Royal Society guaranteed a degree of financial security to professional musicians. A second Royal Charter was granted in 1987, confirming its aims to support to all professional musicians (not just members) and their dependents who are in need through illness, disease or old age.

It describes the unusual association of fetal and placental hydrops with maternal preeclampsia. The name \\"mirror syndrome\\" refers to the similarity between maternal edema and fetal hydrops. It was first described in 1892 by John William Ballantyne.http://www.whonamedit.com/synd.cfm/616.html Causes The etiology may be any of the variety of obstetric problems that range from immunological disorders, including Rh-isoimmunization, to fetal infections, metabolic disorders, and fetal malformations. Ballantyne syndrome can result from the maternal reaction to a fetus that has hemoglobin Barts disease due to inherited double alpha thalassemia trait (alpha thalassemia major) from both parents.http://sogc.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/gui218CPG0810.pdf Pathogenesis The etiopathogenetic mechanism of Ballantyne syndrome remains unknown. Signs and symptoms Ballantyne syndrome has several characteristics: * edema, always a key feature * albuminuria of the mother, usually mild * preeclampsia, unusual The fetal symptoms are related to fluid retention, including ascites and polyhydramnios. Fetal hydrops suggests the presence of an important and probably fatal fetal pathology. It can be associated with twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. Diagnosis Although the exact etiopathogenetic mechanism of Ballantyne syndrome remains unknown, several authors have reported raised uric acid levels, anemia, and low hematocrit without hemolysis. Differential diagnosis The problem of distinguishing (or not) between Ballantyne syndrome and preeclampsia is reflected in the diversity of terminology used and in the debate that surrounds the subject. It seems much more likely that an etiology of severe fetal hydrops may cause Ballantyne syndrome when the fetal status greatly worsens and that the syndrome is only a manifestation of the extreme severity of the fetus-placental pathology. Platelet count, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, and haptoglobin are usually unaffected and may be used to distinguish mirror syndrome from HELLP syndrome. Treatment In most cases Ballantyne syndrome causes fetal or neonatal death and, in contrast, maternal involvement is limited at the most to preeclampsia.

Known as ‚ÄúMaine Public Classical‚Äù, the station features a classical music format. History The station originally was signed on in August 2005 as WRMO, a 130-watt class A classic rock station by owner and broadcast engineer Lyle Robert Evans of Green Bay, Wisconsin and station manager Mike McSorley. Less than a year later, in June 2006, the station's ownership was transferred to the estate of Mr. Evans. In September 2006, the estate entered into a purchase agreement for WRMO with Mike McSorley. From September 2006 to October 20, 2010, the station programmed an adult standards/oldies adult contemporary format known as ‚ÄúSongs You Know and Music You Love‚Äù from studios in Steuben, Maine. Citing financial difficulties, the station fell silent on October 20, 2010. On June 26, 2011, the estate of Mr. Evans sold WRMO to Pine Tree Broadcasting, LLC.

The film stars Jean-Louis Trintignant, Stefania Sandrelli, Gastone Moschin, Enzo Tarascio, Fosco Giachetti, Jos√© Quaglio, Dominique Sanda and Pierre Cl√©menti. The film was a co-production of Italian, French, and West German film companies. Bertolucci makes use of the 1930s art and decor associated with the Fascist era: the middle-class drawing rooms and the huge halls of the ruling elite.Buss, Robin. Italian Films, Il conformista, page 120. London: Anchor Press Ltd. .https://www.independent.co.uk/arts- entertainment/films/news/bernardo-bertolucci-dead-conformist-godfather- sopranos-francis-ford-coppola-a8651786.html Plot In Paris, Marcello Clerici finalizes his preparations in assassinating his former college professor, Luca Quadri. It frequently returns to the interior of a car driven by Manganiello as the two of them pursue the professor and his wife. Through a series of flashbacks, he is seen discussing with his blind friend Italo his plans to marry, his somewhat awkward attempts to join the Fascist secret police, and his visits to his parents: a morphine-addicted mother at the family's decaying villa, and his unhinged father at an insane asylum. In another flashback, Marcello is seen as a boy during World War I, who finds himself in his family's wealth. He is humiliated by his schoolmates until he is rescued by Lino, a chauffeur. Lino offers to show him a pistol and then makes sexual advances towards Marcello, which he partially responds to before grabbing the pistol and shooting wildly into the walls and into Lino, then flees from the scene of what he assumes is a murder. In another flashback, Marcello and his fianc√©e Giulia discuss the necessity of his going to confession, even though he is an atheist, in order for her Roman Catholic parents to allow them to marry. Marcello agrees and, in confession, admits to the priest to have committed many grave sins, including his homosexual intercourse with and subsequent murder of Lino, premarital sex, and his absence of guilt for these sins. Marcello admits he thinks little of his new wife but craves the normality that a traditional marriage with children will bring. The priest is shocked -- and pruriently interested in Marcello's homosexual experience -- but quickly absolves Marcello once he hears that he is currently working for the Fascist secret police, called Organization for Vigilance and Repression of Anti-Fascism. Marcello finds himself ordered to assassinate his old acquaintance and teacher, Professor Quadri, an outspoken anti-Fascist intellectual now living in exile in France. Using his honeymoon as a convenient cover, he takes Giulia to Paris where he can carry out the mission. While visiting Quadri he falls in love with Anna, the professor's young wife, and pursues her. Although it becomes clear that she and her husband are aware of Marcello's Fascist sympathies and the danger he presents to them, she responds to his advances, as well as forming a close attachment to Giulia, towards whom she also makes sexual advances. Giulia and Anna dress extravagantly and go to a dance hall with their husbands where Marcello's commitment to the fascists is tested by Quadri. Manganiello is also at the dance hall, having been following Marcello for some time and doubtful of his intentions. Marcello secretly returns the gun that he has been given and gives Manganiello the location of Quadri's country house where the couple plan to go the following day. Even though Marcello has warned Anna not to go to the country with her husband and has apparently persuaded her to stay in Paris with him, she does make the car journey. On a deserted woodland road, Fascist agents conspire to stop Quadri's car with a fake accident scene. When Quadri attempts to help the apparently stricken driver, he is attacked and stabbed to death by several men who appear from the woods. Anna watches her husband being murdered with horror. When the men turn their attention to her, she runs to the car behind for help. When Anna sees that the passenger in the rear of the car is Marcello and realizes his betrayal, she begins to scream uncontrollably, before running into the woods to escape the men trying to kill her. Marcello watches without emotion as she is pursued through the woods and finally shot to death. Manganiello walks away from the car for a cigarette, disgusted with what he sees as Marcello's cowardice in not shooting Anna when she ran to their car. The ending of the film takes place in 1943 as the resignation of Benito Mussolini and the fascist dictatorship is announced. Marcello now has a small child and is apparently settled in a conventional lifestyle. He is called by Italo, his blind friend and former Fascist, and asked to meet on the streets. While walking with Italo, they overhear a conversation between two men in the act of picking each other up, and Marcello recognizes one of them as Lino, the man who seduced him when he was a boy and whom he had thought he had murdered. Marcello publicly denounces Lino as a Fascist, homosexual, and for murdering Professor Quadri and his wife. In his frenzy, he also denounces his friend Italo as a fascist. As a monarchist political crowd sweeps past, taking Italo with them, Marcello is left alone, remaining behind and separate from the passing crowd of the new movement, and having spurned his former friend. He sits near a small fire and stares intently behind him at the young man Lino had been talking to.

Themes Marcello seduces Giulia during their train ride to Paris. The film is a case study in the psychology of conformism and fascism: Marcello Clerici is a bureaucrat, cultivated and intellectual but largely dehumanized by an intense need to be 'normal' and to belong to whatever is the current dominant socio-political group. He grew up in an upper class, perhaps dysfunctional family, and he suffered a major childhood sexual trauma and gun violence episode in which he long believed (erroneously) that he had killed his chauffeur. He accepts an assignment from Benito Mussolini's secret police to assassinate his former mentor, living in exile in Paris. In Trintignant's characterization, Clerici is willing to sacrifice his values in the interests of building a supposedly \\"normal life.\\"Scott. A.O. The New York Times, film review, Arts Section, July 31 - Aug. 6, 2005. According to the political philosopher Takis Fotopoulos, The Conformist (as well as Rhinoceros by Ionesco) is \\"a beautiful portrait of this psychological need to conform and be 'normal' at the social level, in general, and the political level, in particular.\\"Takis Fotopoulos, \\"Recent Theoretical Developments on the Inclusive Democracy Project, B.

It was photographed by Vittorio Storaro, who used rich colors, authentic wardrobe of the 1930s, and a series of unusual camera angles and fluid camera movement. Film critic and author Robin Buss writes that the cinematography suggests Clerici's inability to conform with \\"normal\\" reality: the reality of the time is \\"abnormal.\\"Buss, Robin. Ibid. Also, Bertolucci's cinematic style synthesizes expressionism and \\"fascist\\" film aesthetics. Its style has been compared with classic German films of the 1920s and 1930s, such as in Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will and Fritz Lang's Metropolis.Klein, Jessi. Vassar College Department of Italian, 1996. In 2013, Interiors, an online journal concerned with the relationship between architecture and film, released an issue that discussed how space is used in a scene that takes place on the Palazzo dei Congressi. The issue highlights the use of architecture in the film, pointing out that in order to understand the film itself, it's essential to understand the history of the EUR district in Rome and its deep ties with fascism.Mehruss Jon Ahi and Armen Karaoghlanian \\"The Conformist\\" Interiors Journal (April 15, 2013) Production The filming locations included Gare d'Orsay and Paris, France; Sant' Angelo Bridge and the Colosseum, both in Rome.. Lead actor Trintignant learned his Italian-language lines phonetically, and per common practice in the Italian film industry at the time, was later dubbed over by another actor, Sergio Graziani. The film was influential on other filmmakers: the image of blowing leaves in The Conformist, for example, influenced a very similar scene in The Godfather, Part II (1974) by Francis Ford Coppola.Visions of Light at the Internet Movie Database. Additionally, the scene in which Dominique Sanda's character is chased through the snowy woods after her husband has been murdered, is echoed with mood, lighting and setting in a third-season episode of The Sopranos, \\"Pine Barrens\\", directed by Steve Buscemi.

Critical response Vincent Canby, film critic for The New York Times, liked Bertolucci's screenplay and his directorial effort, and wrote, \\"Bernardo Bertolucci...has at last made a very middle-class, almost conventional movie that turns out to be one of the elegant surprises of the current New York Film Festival...It is also apparent in Bertolucci's cinematic style, which is so rich, poetic, and baroque that it is simply incapable of meaning only what it says...The movie is perfectly cast, from Trintignant and on down, including Pierre Clementi, who appears briefly as the wicked young man who makes a play for the young Marcello. The Conformist is flawed, perhaps, but those very flaws may make it Bertolucci's first commercially popular film, at least in Europe where there always seems to be a market for intelligent, upper middle- class decadence.\\"Canby, Vincent. The New York Times, film review, September 19, 1970. Last accessed: December 22, 2007. A review in Variety stated, \\"For those who appreciate its subtleties, but also its subsurface power and great evocative qualities, it's a gem.\\"\\"Film Reviews: Il Conformista\\". Variety. July 8, 1970. 15. Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and called it \\"much more of a show than a story,\\" with its narrative themes \\"all but lost amid Bertolucci's splendid recreation of the era. In other words, if you are looking for fashion and furnishing hints, this is the place.\\" Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times declared that the film \\"places young Bernardo Bertolucci in the front ranks of Italian directors and among the finest film-makers working anywhere. In this dazzling film, Bertolucci, 30, manages to combine the bravura style of a Fellini, the acute sense of period of a Visconti and the fervent political commitment of an Elio Petri ('Investigation of a Private Citizen') with complete individuality and, better still, a total lack of self-indulgence.\\" Gary Arnold of The Washington Post said that the film was \\"an extraordinarily beautiful and spellbinding picture,\\" but \\"what's below the surface doesn't stand up to much analysis. I think this is true and that it amounts to a terrible flaw. The dramatic material, while intriguing, isn't adequately developed: many connecting or explanatory scenes appear to be missing (reading the original novel by Alberto Moravia restores some of these), the psychology of the most complex characters is murky, and the climactic and concluding scenes are positively trite.\\" Jan Dawson of The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote, \\"In his screen adaptation of Moravia's novel, Bertolucci has eliminated all explanations or analysed motivations, as well as any allusions to Marcello's life before the moment he first sees Lino ... The effort of these changes, in purely psychological terms, is to reduce Marcello's story to a model Freudian case history.\\" In 1994 critic James Berardinelli wrote a review and heralded the film's look. He wrote, \\"Storaro and Bertolucci have fashioned a visual masterpiece in The Conformist, with some of the best use of light and shadow ever in a motion picture. This isn't just photography, it's art -- powerful, beautiful, and effective. There's a scene in the woods, with sunlight streaming between trees, that's breathtaking to behold -- and all the more stunning because of the brutal events that take place before this background.\\"Berardinelli, James. Reel Views, film review, 1994. In a 2012 article in The Guardian, John Patterson defined the movie as an \\"expressionist masterpiece\\", which \\"offered a blueprint for a new kind of Hollywood film,\\" inspiring New Hollywood film makers.

Its parent body is the Honourable Society of the Inner Temple, one of the four Inns of Court. Its law collections cover the legal systems of the British Isles (England and Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man) and also Commonwealth countries. There are, in addition, extensive non-law collections covering such subjects as history, topography, biography and heraldry, and an important collection of legal and historical manuscripts. History The Library is first mentioned in 1440,Inner Temple Papers, p. 234, Taylor & Francis, 1948, MacKinnon, Sir Frank Douglas, accessed 25 November 2009 then in the Inn‚Äôs records in 1506. The Library refused to accept John Selden's manuscripts in 1654, most likely because the size of the collection would have necessitated a new building, but it has been described as \\"the greatest loss which the Library of the Inner Temple ever sustained\\". In 1707 the Inner Temple was offered the Petyt Manuscripts (William Petyt had been Keeper of the Records in the Tower, and a well-known writer of constitutional law) and a sum of ¬£150 to build a new Library, which was completed in 1709 and consisted of three rooms. A Librarian was appointed immediately, and the practice continues to this day.

There are two types of paratonia: oppositional and facilitatory. Oppositional paratonia (\\"gegenhalten\\") occurs when subjects involuntarily resist to passive movements, while facilitatory paratonia (\\"mitgehen\\") occurs when subjects involuntary assist passive movements. Both types of paratonia have been associated with cognitive impairment or mental disorders, particularly in relation to frontal lobe dysfunction. Paratonia is frequently encountered in clinical practice. Paratonia can be assessed with rating scales during clinical examination. Paratonia scale is a semi-quantitative score to rate the amount of oppositional and facilitatory paratonia separately. Kral modified procedure is a more objective semi-quantitative rating of upper limb facilitatory paratonia easily applicable while patients are seated. The Paratonia Assessment Instrument (PAI) was also used in a physiotherapic setting for the assessment of oppositional paratonia. In 2017 facilitatory and oppositional paratonia have been assessed with surface electromyography, allowing a quantitative measure and better characterization of paratonia. Recording paratonia with electromyography on elbow flexor and extensors during repetitive continuous or discontinuous elbow movements may help distinguish paratonia from other forms of altered muscle tone. Both facilitatory and oppositional paratonia increase during continuous flexion and extension movements, moreover, oppositional paratonia increases with movement velocity. Spasticity also is velocity- dependent, but, differently from oppositional paratonia, if repeatedly elicited decreases instead of increasing. Conversely, parkinsonian rigidity is independent from movement velocity and probably also from movement repetition.

He is head of The Ibeto Group, the largest business enterprise from Nnewi, a city unique for its entrepreneurial spirit. In the early 1980s, when the oil crash and a controversial import licensing system was making a dent on the Nigerian manufacturing environment, Nnewi went through a growth period. The Ibeto Group under the Ibeto's leadership was a pacesetter in the region and nation's trading and later manufacturing development. Early history Cletus Ibeto started out as a spare parts import dealer, after spending some time as an apprentice in the motor parts business, a gradual step taken by many eastern traders. In March 1988 he stopped direct importation of lead-acid automotive battery and plastic motor accessories, after completing his factory in Nnewi. By 1995 The Ibeto Group had become one of the largest auto spare parts manufacturing outfits in the country. On October 2, 1996, he established Ibeto Petrochemical Industries Ltd. which is engaged in the blending of oil lubricants as well as the production of various types of petroleum products for local and international markets. The Company owns the largest liquid storage facilities for petroleum products in Nigeria with a capacity of over 60,000 metric tonnes located at Apapa Wharf and Ibru Jetty Complex, Lagos. In May 2018, Ibeto Cement Company Limited announced a reverse merger with Century Petroleum Corporation, a United States (U.S.) publicly-traded petroleum exploration and production company in a move to enter global markets and bypass the complex process of listing.

A well-known cosmopolite and high liver, Travers was a member of 27 private clubs, according to Cleveland Amory in his book Who Killed Society? Early life Travers was born in 1819 and graduated in 1838 from Columbia College, where he was a member of the Philolexian Society. Career Along with John Hunter, in 1863 he founded Saratoga Race Course and served as its first president. Saratoga's Travers Stakes is named in his honor and is the oldest major Thoroughbred horse race in the United States. In 1884, William Travers became one of the backers of the Sheepshead Bay Race Track on Coney Island. Travers was a partner in Annieswood Stable with John Hunter and George Osgood. The operation had considerable success both in racing runners and with breeding at their Annieswood Stud farm in Westchester County, New York. Their horse, the Hall of Famer Kentucky won the first running of the Travers Stakes in 1864. One of their most famous horses was Alarm, considered one of the best sprint race horses in American Thoroughbred horse racing history. Travers was a long-time president of the New York Athletic Club. On January 13, 1887 the club purchased Hogg Island in Long Island Sound and Pelham, New York shoreline from the estate of John Hunter and renamed it Travers Island in his honor.

The death of the elder Mowrer when Hobart was 13 changed his life radically. A year later he suffered the first in a series of major depressions which would recur throughout his life. Nevertheless, he did well in high school and entered the University of Missouri in 1925. Having decided on psychology as a career, he became laboratory assistant to the university's first and only psychology professor, Max Friedrich Meyer. Meyer had earned a PhD in physics before emigrating from Germany in the 1890s and was a rigorous behaviorist. Although Mowrer's initial hope was that psychology would help him to understand himself and his own problems, he readily adapted to Meyer's behavioral approach. Mowrer began his college years as a conservative Christian, but lost his faith as he adopted progressive and scientific views prevalent in academia. In his senior year, as a project for a sociology course, Mowrer composed a questionnaire to investigate sexual attitudes among students. It was distributed anonymously and the responses were to be returned anonymously. The questionnaire was accompanied by a letter from a non-existent \\"Bureau of Personnel Research\\" which began: > Dear University Student: > During the last several decades it has become increasingly apparent that > there is something seriously wrong with the traditional system of marriage > in this country. But, unfortunately, the whole matter has been so > inextricably bound up with religious dogmas, moral sentiments, and all > manner of prudish conventionalities as to make it exceedingly difficult to > ascertain with any degree of accuracy the precise reasons for this > situation. There were slight differences in wording between the questionnaires sent to women and those sent to men, but each contained 11 groups of questions requesting the student's opinions about illicit sexual relations, whether the student would marry a person who had engaged in sexual relations, how s/he would react to unfaithfulness in marriage, whether s/he had engaged in sex play as a child or sexual relations as an adult, and whether s/he would favor the legal establishment of \\"trial marriage\\" or \\"companionate marriage.\\" Some of the students sent the questionnaires on to their parents, who complained to the administration. Two faculty members were aware of the questionnaire and allowed it to be distributed, sociology professor Harmon O. DeGraff and psychology professor Max Friedrich Meyer, although neither had read the cover letter. Ultimately both men lost their jobs, and Meyer never held an academic position again. The American Association of University Professors censured the University for violation of academic freedom, in the first such action taken by the AAUP. The scandal had little impact on Mowrer's career. He left the university without a degree in 1929 (the degree was granted a few years later), entering Johns Hopkins University, where he worked under Knight Dunlap. Mowrer's PhD research involved spatial orientation as mediated by vision and the vestibular receptors of the inner ear, using pigeons as subjects. During his time at Johns Hopkins he also underwent psychoanalysis for the first time, in an attempt to resolve another episode of depression. After completing his doctorate in 1932 he continued his work on spatial orientation as a post-doctoral fellow at Northwestern University and then Princeton University. Yale, then Harvard Academic positions were scarce during the Great Depression, so in 1934 Mowrer began a Sterling Fellowship at Yale University researching learning theory. Yale psychology was then dominated by the stimulus-response approach of Clark Hull. Mowrer's wife, Willie Mae (Molly) had been a fellow student at Hopkins and remained there as an instructor for several years after Mowrer left. When she moved to New Haven, Connecticut, the couple served as houseparents at a residential home for infants and children. Mowrer used the home as an informal behavioral science laboratory. He and his wife developed the first bedwetting alarm while working there. In 1936, Mowrer was hired by the Yale Institute of Human Relations, then a relatively new project funded by the Rockefeller Foundation, as an instructor. The institute was designed to integrate psychology, psychoanalysis and the social sciences. One product of the institute's unique approach was a detailed study of aggression by sociologist John Dollard with psychologists Mowrer, Leonard Doob, Neal Miller and Robert Sears. Each of the five contributors had training in psychoanalysis or had been individually psychoanalyzed, but the language of the book reflected the objective behaviorism of the day. During the late 1930s Mowrer began experimenting with the use of electric shock as a conditioning agent. At the time, most psychologists agreed with William James that fear (in this usage, synonymous with anxiety) was an instinctive response. Mowrer suspected fear was a conditioned response and designed a way to create fear in the laboratory. The unusually generous funding available at the institute allowed him to use human subjects for the first time. The subjects were attached to galvanic skin response recorders and to electrodes which could deliver an electric shock. They were then exposed to a light stimulus which was sometimes (randomly) followed by a shock. Mowrer discovered two unexpected phenomena. There was a substantial galvanic stress response to the first presentation of the light stimulus, before any shock had been administered. The anticipation was apparently more aversive than the shock, which would not have been predicted by traditional behavioral theory. Mowrer also noticed that after each shock the subjects experienced a marked degree of relaxation. Together with fellow psychologist Neal Miller, Mowrer gives his name to the \\"Miller-Mowrer Shuttlebox\\" apparatus.N., Pam M.S., \\"MILLER-MOWRER SHUTTLEBOX,\\" in PsychologyDictionary.org, April 7, 2013, https://psychologydictionary.org/miller-mowrer-shuttlebox/ (accessed February 20, 2019). Using animals in similar experiments, he found that a cycle could be produced in which the subject became more and more responsive to conditioning. He concluded that anxiety was basically anticipatory in nature and ideally functions to protect the organism from danger. However, because of the circumstances of conditioning, the degree of fear is often disproportionate to the source. Anxiety can be created artificially, and relief of anxiety can be used to condition other behaviors. Mowrer's term for the state of expectancy produced by carefully timed aversive stimuli was the \\"preparatory set,\\" and it was foundational to his later thinking in both learning theory and clinical psychology. In 1940 Mowrer became Assistant Professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. While there, he became involved with Henry A. Murray and his group at the Harvard Psychological Clinic. Mowrer, Murray, Talcott Parsons, Gordon Allport and others formed a group which eventually led to the formation of the Harvard Department of Social Relations, partially in response to the success of the Yale Institute of Human Relations. During this time Mowrer's faith in Freudian theory was fading. His primary professional loyalty had always been to learning theory, but he continued to assume that neurotic symptoms and depression were best addressed through analysis. His first psychoanalyst had treated him for only a few months. When his depression returned he underwent a second, much lengthier analysis and felt that he was much improved. His symptoms soon returned, leading him to question Freud's premises. In spite of his doubts he underwent a third analysis during the time he was at Harvard, this time with the prominent Freudian disciple Hanns Sachs. War work In 1944 Mowrer became a psychologist at the Office of Strategic Services developing assessment techniques for potential intelligence agents. Mowrer's experience with the laboratory induction of psychological stress, along with the work of other psychologists, was utilized to construct an environment in which recruits could be assessed for their ability to withstand highly stressful situations. As part of his work there, he participated in a seminar led by Harry Stack Sullivan. Sullivan's theories on the role of disturbances in interpersonal relationships with \\"significant others\\" in the etiology of mental disorders had a profound effect on Mowrer's thinking. When Mowrer returned to Harvard, he began counseling students in addition to his faculty duties. He used the principles he had learned from Sullivan, questioning them about their interpersonal relationships and confronting them when he felt they were being dishonest. Move to Illinois In 1948, Hobart Mowrer accepted a research- only position at the University of Illinois and moved to Urbana, Illinois with Molly and their three young children. He was now involved with two essentially separate lines of work, learning theory and clinical psychology. Mowrer's primary achievements in learning theory followed from his work with aversive conditioning or avoidance learning. He formulated a two-factor learning theory, arguing that conditioning (sign learning) is distinct from habit formation (solution learning). This theory was initially described in a 1947 paper. In the 1950s he modified the theory to allow for only one type of learning but two types of reinforcement. Mowrer's interest in clinical psychology was primarily a hobby during the 1950s, but it would eventually eclipse his work as a learning theorist. He had given up on psychoanalysis after 1944, partially as a result of the failure of his own analysts to cure his problems. Most importantly, Harry Stack Sullivan had persuaded him that the key to mental health lay in healthy, scrupulously honest human relationships, not in intrapsychic factors. Mower took Sullivan's ideas to heart and confessed to his wife some guilty secrets concerning his adolescent sexual behavior, and that he had had an affair during the marriage. She was upset, but convinced (as was Mowrer) that those secrets might explain his bouts of depression. The depressive symptoms did remain in remission for eight years. In 1953, at the height of his career and on the eve of accepting the presidency of the American Psychological Association, he suffered the worst psychological collapse of his life. He was hospitalized for three and a half months with depression complicated by symptoms resembling psychosis. Few effective treatments were available. A few years later, Mowrer was successfully treated with one of the first tricyclic antidepressants. Religious views During most of Mowrer's adult life he had no involvement with religion. He recognized that his theories about the importance of guilt were similar to traditional religious ideas, but he had arrived at his convictions through a secular process and the religious concepts of guilt and sin did not at first interest him. Freud, in Mowrer's view, had made a fatal error in attributing emotional distress to inappropriate guilt. Mowrer had concluded that mental disorders, including even schizophrenia, were the result of real, not imagined, guilt. Mowrer did not see this as a religious issue. He had been raised to associate religion with \\"otherworldly\\" values, with the relationship of individuals to God, and his own focus was on the relationship of individuals to one another. In 1955 Mowrer read a religious novel which changed his thinking. His daughter was reading Magnificent Obsession by Lloyd C. Douglas and told her father that it might interest him. Mowrer was impressed by Douglas' thesis, expressed through a fictional character, that the Bible was a superb handbook of human relations. A central theme of the novel is a secret shared by a small group of people who have found great spiritual and material success. It is derived from Jesus' suggestion to \\"do alms in secret\\", not letting anyone know. In the book, however, good deeds done in secret invest the characters with almost magical power. Mowrer turned the concept around to place the emphasis on the pathological potential of misdeeds when they are kept secret. He summed it up the phrase, \\"You are your secrets,\\" sometimes reworded as \\"You are as sick as your secrets.\\" After reading other fictional and non-fictional works by Lloyd Douglas, who had left the Congregationalist ministry to devote himself to writing, Mowrer became a member of the Presbyterian Church. He was soon disappointed. He had condemned psychoanalysis for being soft on sin, and now he found that the church was dominated by similar permissive assumptions. It was not only the modernist influences in churches to which Mowrer objected, however, but some traditional beliefs such as the doctrine of justification by faith. He set out to restore to churches the consciousness of personal sin and guilt he felt they had lost. He was able to acquire funding from the Lilly Endowment for a fellowship in morality and mental health. The program brought students from seminaries and divinity schools (among others, Jay E. Adams) to Champaign-Urbana, where they learned Mowrer's counseling and group techniques. Integrity therapy After Mowrer's positive experiences as a result of his disclosures to his wife in 1945, he began to counsel students using several simple premises: that neurotic people often are being deceptive in some way with people they care about; that they suffer from conscience pangs but resist or repress the prompting of the conscience; and that this causes their symptoms. When Mowrer was counseling someone who could not be induced to confess anything of significance, he would \\"model\\" confession for them by disclosing something from his own life. Group therapy was coming into fashion, and although most groups were dominated by the same psychotherapeutic ideas Mowrer had rejected, he saw hope of using groups in a way that would increase the opportunities for confession and emotional involvement. In a 1972 article detailing the procedures of the groups, Mowrer described the intake interviews as \\"very unlike a social case-work interview\\" and \\"more like those followed in intakes at Synanon or Daytop.\\" The prospect was first put at ease by \\"sharing\\" offered by the interviewers. Committee members would then zero in on some point on which the person seemed to be evasive, inconsistent or defensive. If the person immediately \\"came clean\\" to the satisfaction of the committee, s/he would be rewarded with verbal approval and admission to the group. If any resistance was shown, there would be further confrontation, then deliberation by the committee in the presence of the prospective member. According to Mowrer it was rare for someone to be flatly turned down, although they might be asked to seek help elsewhere (with a \\"psychiatrist of our choice\\") and come back when they were able to be honest as defined by the group. Meetings lasted at least three hours. No one could leave before the three hours were up, and anyone who walked out during a \\"run\\" (i.e. while the target of group confrontation) was permanently excluded from the group. Any language was acceptable, including profanity and yelling, but no physical violence or threat thereof. Feelings were to be expressed in \\"gut-level\\" language and verbal aggression was common. Embraces and physical expressions of affection were also common. All significant details of member's everyday lives were to be shared with the group, and members had contracts detailing steps they would take toward honesty and restitution. These agreements were recorded in a \\"commitment book\\" and the member had to answer to the group for any failure to keep a commitment. Mowrer dropped the term \\"Integrity Therapy\\" in favor of \\"Integrity Groups,\\" to avoid the impression that it was possible to outgrow the need for Group attendance. He considered membership in an Integrity Group to be a lifelong commitment (members were shuffled among groups to avoid fixed relationships). Criticism of the Integrity Group concept centered on Mowrer's negativity about human nature, and the questionable value of investing a group with supreme authority over one's life. There was concern that deliberately increasing anxiety in vulnerable people could lead to a psychotic break or suicidal behavior. When it was suggested that his techniques resembled brain- washing, Mowrer repeated the response of Charles Dederich (as quoted by Yablonsky) to a similar question: \\"Yes, that's right, we do engage in a good deal of 'brain-washing.' Most of the people who come here have very dirty brains, and we try to clean them up a bit!\\" Eugene May noted with respect to this remark that the people entering Synanon generally had severe drug problems and were alienated from family and community, while most participants in Mowrer's community and university groups were leading fairly normal lives. Later years The popularity of Integrity Groups faded during the 1970s. Mowrer's techniques in fact were to have a substantial legacy in the alcohol and drug rehabilitation field, but community groups did not last. Mowrer recognized the irony of this. Opposition to professionalism in therapy had been a guiding principle for both Molly and Hobart Mowrer and for years they resisted the temptation to sponsor formal training in I.G. leadership. Times were changing, however, and it seemed that the only future available for Mowrer's approach was in the hands of paid professionals. He did continue to have some non-professional influence through the Grapevine articles he wrote for Alcoholics Anonymous, an organization he very much admired. Hobart Mowrer was an advocate of the idea that mental illness has a substantial biological and genetic basis. He held this conviction in spite of his equally strong belief in the importance of the \\"pathogenic secret.\\" Mowrer accepted the importance of biological factors at a time when many people did not, and was in this respect ahead of his time. He regarded his own affliction as in some sense a \\"gift,\\" the driving force behind his innovative ideas, but also the great misery of his life. Mowrer had hoped to remain professionally active in retirement, but circumstances forced him to slow down shortly after he retired in 1975. Molly became seriously ill and he developed medical problems of his own. Molly's death in 1979 was a great loss, and also left him with few responsibilities. He had accepted that his periodic depressions would never be entirely cured, and had long held the opinion that suicide was a reasonable choice in some circumstances. He committed suicide in 1982 at the age of 75.

A port fief to the Hindu-Buddhist Majapahit kingdom thought to have been founded in the last quarter of the 15th century, it was influenced by Islam brought by Muslim traders from China, Gujarat, Arabia and also from Islamic kingdoms in the region, such as Samudra Pasai, Malacca and Bani (Muslim) Champa. The sultanate was the first Muslim state in Java, and once dominated most of the northern coast of Java and southern Sumatra. Despite its short period, the sultanate played an important role in the establishment of Islam in Indonesia, especially on Java and neighboring area. Etymology The origin of Demak was the settlement named Glagah Wangi. According to tradition, the first person that Raden Patah encountered in Glagah Wangi was a lady named Nyai Lembah, from Rawa Pening. Nyai Lembah invited Raden Patah to settle in Glagah Wangi, which later was renamed as Demak Bintara. There are several suggestions on the origin of the name \\"Demak\\". According to Indonesian historian Poerbatjaraka, the name derived from Javanese term delemak which means \\"watery soil\\" or \\"swamp\\". According to Hamka the name was derived from Arabic term dimak which means \\"tears\\" to imply the hardship endured during the struggle to establish Islam in Java. According to another historian, Sutjipto Wiryosuparto, the name Demak was derived from the Kawi language which means \\"heirloom\\" or \\"gift\\". Formation During the reign of Wikramawardhana of Majapahit, a series of Ming armada naval expeditions led by Zheng He, a Muslim Chinese admiral, arrived in Java several times spanning the period from 1405 to 1433. This Chinese expedition supported the establishment of Muslim state of Malacca in 1400s, subsequently had assisted for the establishment of Muslim Chinese, Arab and Malay communities in northern ports of Java such as Semarang, Demak, Tuban, and Ampel; thus Islam began to gain a foothold on the northern coast of Java. Demak's origins are uncertain although it was apparently founded in the last quarter of the 15th century by a Muslim, known as Raden Patah (from Arabic name: \\"Fatah\\", also called \\"Pate Rodin\\" in Portuguese records, or \\"Jin Bun\\" in Chinese record). There is evidence that he had Chinese ancestry and perhaps was named Cek Ko-po. According to tradition, Sunan Ampel ordered Raden Patah to establish an Islamic learning center in the Glagah Wangi village in coastal Central Java. Soon the village grew to become the center for dawah activities among distinguished Islamic proselytizers, traditionally known as Wali Songo or \\"the nine saints\\". At that time Glagah Wangi was a small fiefdom belongs to Majapahit. It was the only Majapahit's fiefdom that its ruler was a Muslim. Then the name was changed to Demak, and it grew further by the establishment of madrasa Islamic school and pesantren boarding school. =Raden Patah= The foundation of Demak is traditionally attributed to Raden Patah (r. 1475‚Äì1518), a Javanese noble related to Majapahit royalty. At least one account stated that he was the son of Kertabhumi, who reigned as king Brawijaya V of Majapahit (1468‚Äì1478). According to tradition, Raden Patah was the son of Majapahit King Kertabhumi with his concubine, a Chinese princess resided in Majapahit palace. Unknowingly, when she was pregnant with the king's child, she was given away to be betrothed with the regent of Palembang, a Majapahit's vassal state. There Raden Patah was born in 1448 with the name Raden Hasan. After coming of age, Raden Hasan went to Ampel Denta in Java (now Surabaya) to learn from Sunan Ampel, a prominent ulama. Sunan Ampel betrothed him with his daughter, Nyai Ageng Malaka. Subsequently, in 1470s Raden Patah was sent by Sunan Ampel to establish a new settlement in Glagah Wangi, Central Java. Through Sunan Ampel's recommendation, Raden Hasan was appointed as the regent of Glagah Wangi by King Kertabhumi of Majapahit, with the title Adipati Bintara. Dates for the end of the Majapahit Empire range from 1478, traditionally described in sinengkalan or chandrasengkala (chronogram) Sirna ilang kertaning bhumi that is correspond to 1400 Saka,) to 1517. The year 1478 was the year of Sudarma Wisuta war, when Ranawijaya's (Girindrawardhana) army under general Udara (who later became vice-regent) breached Trowulan defences and killed Kertabumi in his palace,Pararaton, p. 40, \\" .... bhre Kertabhumi ..... bhre prabhu sang mokta ring kadaton i saka sunyanora-yuganing-wong, 1400\\".See also: Hasan Djafar, Girindrawardhana, 1978, p. 50. but not the actual fall of Majapahit itself as a whole. Demak sent reinforcements under Sunan Ngudung, who later died in battle and was replaced by Sunan Kudus, but they came too late to save Kertabumi although they managed to repel the Ranawijaya army. This event is mentioned in Trailokyapuri (Jiwu) and Petak inscription, where Ranawijaya claimed that he already defeated Kertabhumi and reunited Majapahit as one Kingdom.Poesponegoro & Notosusanto (1990), pp. 448‚Äì451. Ranawijaya ruled from 1474 to 1498 with the formal name Girindrawardhana, with Udara as his vice-regent. This event led to the war between Demak and Daha, since Demak rulers were descendants of Kertabhumi. As the response of the collapse of Kertabhumi of Trowulan and the rise of Girindrawardhana of Daha in 1478, Demak decided no longer obliged to sent tribute to Majapahit central court and declared its independence. At that time Demak was temporary led by Sunan Giri (Prabu Satmoto). Three years later the Islamic kingdom of Demak was established under the chronogram Geni mati siniram janmi which corresponds to 1403 Saka or 1481 CE. Raden Hasan was crowned by members of Wali Songo under the new regnal name as Sultan Syah Alam Akbar Al-Fattah, thus in Javanese tongue he was more popularly known as Raden Patah. Demak Great Mosque built by Sultan Al-Fattah in late 15th century in traditional Javanese tajug stacked pyramidal roof. As the sign of his new reign, Raden Patah built a new Grand Mosque as the center of Islamic teaching. He appointed members of Wali Songo as advisors within his new government; Sunan Kudus as qadi (great judge of religious law), Sunan Giri as mufti, Sunan Kalijaga as imam and advisor. A Chinese chronicle in a temple in Semarang states that Raden Patah founded the town of Demak in a marshy area to the north of Semarang. After the collapse of Majapahit, its various dependencies and vassals broke free, including northern Javanese port towns like Demak. Demak managed to gain hegemony over other Javanese trading ports on the northern coast of Java such as Semarang, Jepara, Tuban, and Gresik. The supremacy of Raden Patah was illustrated by Tome Pires,\\" ... should de Albuquerque make peace with the Lord of Demak, all of Java will almost be forced to make peace with him... The Lord of Demak stood for all of Java\\". Apart from Javanese city-states, Raden Patah also gained overlordship of the ports of Jambi and Palembang in eastern Sumatra, which produced commodities such as lignaloes and gold. As most of its power was based on trade and control of coastal cities, Demak can be considered as a thalassocracy. Growth thumb400pxcenter An early 18th century map of Java. Note that only major trading ports on the northern coast were known to the Europeans. From west to east: * Bantam (Banten) * Xacatara (Jayakarta) * Cherebum (Cirebon) * Taggal (Tegal) * Damo (Demak) * Iapara (Jepara) * Tubam (Tuban) * Sodaio (Sedayu, now near Gresik) * Surubaya (Surabaya) Raden Patah's son, or possibly his brother, led Demak's brief domination in Java. He was known as Trenggana, and later Javanese traditions say he gave himself the title Sultan. It appears that Trenggana had two reigns--c 1505-1518 and c 1521-1546--between which his brother in law, Yunus of Jepara occupied the throne. Between 1513 and 1518 Demak wage war against Patih Udara of Daha, the successor state of Majapahit located in today's Kediri city. The main Demak army led by Raden Patah and Sunan Kudus marched overland through Madiun, while Demak navy fleet led by Pati Unus took sea route through Sedayu. Demak managed to consolidate its power to defeat Daha in 1518, because it is more accepted as the legitimate successor of Majapahit, since Raden Patah claimed as a direct descendant of King Kertabhumi who perished during the Girindrawardana invasion of Trowulan back in 1478. Not long after defeating Daha, in 1518 Raden Patah died. =Pati Unus = The 1573 map by Egnazio Danti showing Dema on the center north coast of Iava Magiore (Java). Raden Patah was succeeded by his brother-in-law Pati Unus or Adipati Yunus (r. 1518‚Äì1521), king of Jepara. Before ascending to Demak throne, he was a ruler of Jepara, a vassal state to the north of Demak. Pati Unus ruled under the regnal name Sultan Syah Alam Akbar II. He was known for his two attempts in 1511 and 1521 to seize the port of Malacca from the control of Portuguese. In Suma Oriental, Tom√© Pires refer to him as \\"Pate Onus\\" or \\"Pate Unus\\", brother in-law of \\"Pate Rodim\\" (Raden Patah), the ruler of Demak. During the invasions he managed to mobilize vessels from Javanese coastal cities to Malay Peninsula. Javanese ports turned against Portuguese for a number of reason, the main one being opposition to Portuguese insistence on a monopoly of the spices trade. The invasion fleet consisted of around 100 vessels (1st expedition - 1513) and 375 vessels (2nd expedition - 1521), but both of the invasion were repelled by the Portuguese. The destruction of this navy proved devastating to the Javanese ports, the trading activity in these ports became lethargic. This campaign attempt ended with failures and loss of the King's life in 1521. He was later remembered as Pangeran Sabrang Lor or \\"the Prince who crossed (the Java Sea) to North (Malay peninsula)\\". =Sultan Trenggana= Pati Unus was childless when he died, thus led to crisis of Demak succession. After the death of Pati Unus, the throne was contested between his brothers; the older Raden Kikin and Raden Trenggana the youngest. According to tradition, Prince Prawata also known as Raden Mukmin, the eldest son of Prince Trenggana, stole Keris Setan Kober, a powerful magical kris from Sunan Kudus, and used it to assassinate his uncle Raden Kikin by the river, since then Raden Kikin also referred to as Sekar Seda Lepen (flower that fell by the river). With the help from his son, Raden Trenggana rise as Sultan. The Pati Unus' brother-in-law, Trenggana (r. 1522‚Äì1546), crowned by Sunan Gunungjati (one of the Wali Songo), became the third and the greatest ruler of Demak. He conquered the Hindu-based resistance in Central Java. Trenggana oversaw the spread of Demak's influence to the east and west. During Trenggana's reign a young man came to his court to offer his service for the sultan. He was just came back from Mecca after several years spending times studying Islam there, and learned that his hometown in Pasai was captured by the infidels Portuguese. His name was Fatahillah, soon he will rose to become Demak's renowned military general. Tradition mentioned that the Sultan was very much impressed by Fatahillah's imposing figure and charisma also his knowledge in Islam, the Sultan betrothed him with his daughter, also the widow of deceased Pati Unus. Following the disclosure of a news of Portuguese-Sunda alliance in 1522, Sultan ordered Fatahillah to capture Banten and Sunda Kelapa ports of kingdom of Sunda in 1527. Sunda Kelapa was later renamed Jayakarta. From this territories he created Sultanate of Banten as vassal-state under Hasanudin, son of Gunungjati. Sunan Gunungjati crowned Hasanudin king of Banten with authority bestowed by the Sultan of Demak who, in turn, offered Hasanudin his sister's hand in marriage. Thus, a new dynasty was born at the same time as a new vassal-state was created. Trenggana spread Demak's influence eastward and during his second campaign, he conquered the last Javanese Hindu-Buddhist state, the remnants of Majapahit. Majapahit had been in decline since the later 15th century and was in an advanced state of collapse at the time of the Demak's conquest. Demak was able to subdue other major ports and its reach extended into some inland areas of East Java that are not thought to have been Islamised at the time. Although evidence is limited, it is known that Demak's conquests covered much of Java: Tuban, an old Majapahit port mentioned in Chinese sources from the 11th century, was conquered c. 1527; He appointed his daughter, Ratna Kencana (popularly known as Ratu Kalinyamat), and her husband Sultan Hadlirin, as the ruler of Kalinyamat and Jepara. He also appointed Jaka Tingkir as the duke of Pajang and gave his daughter in the hand of marriage to Jaka Tingkir. After his success on conquering Western Java north coast by establishing Banten sultanate, and also captured some coastal ports in East Java previously belongs to Majapahit, his attention shifted further east to the Hindu principality of Pasuruan. His campaign ended when he was killed in Pasuruan, East Java in 1546. According to tradition, Sultan Trenggana was assassinated by a ten years old Adipati of Surabaya, stabbed with a kris during the boy serving him betel nut. Decline =Sunan Mukmin= The death of the strong and able Trenggana in 1546 has caused the former familial grudge to be resurvaced and triggered a blood vendetta. Arya Penangsang, the son of the assassinated Sekar Seda Lepen (Raden Kikin) sought revenge for the murder of his father, and argued that he deserved to be the next sultan of Demak, since his late father was more deserving than his uncle, Sultan Trenggana. Of course he hold grudge against Prince Mukmin or Sunan Prawata, the murderer who now is next in line for throne succession. This blood feud sparked the civil war of succession between Prince Mukmin, son of Trenggana, and Prince Arya Penangsang, the adipati (duke) of , a vassal of state of Demak. According to Babad Demak chronicle, several influential figures of Wali Songo, each proposed and supported their own preferred successor. Sunan Giri insists for the rise of Prince Mukmin (Sunan Prawata) as the next sultan, while Sunan Kudus supported Arya Penangsang instead. Sunan Kudus argued that Arya Penangsang was more deserving since he belongs to the line of the eldest male son of the Demak dynasty. On the other hand, Sunan Kalijaga proposed Hadiwijaya, the adipati of Pajang and also the son in-law of Trenggana, popularly known as Joko Tingkir, as the next sultan. Mukmin (r. 1546‚Äì1549), the son of Trenggana, ascended to throne as the new and fourth Sultan of Demak. However, Arya Penangsang of Jipang, with the help of his teacher, Sunan Kudus, took revenge by sending an assassin to kill Prawata and his wife, using the same kris that killed his father. =Arya Penangsang= In 1549, Arya Penangsang (r. 1549‚Äì1568), the duke of Jipang ascend to the throne of Demak after assassinating his cousin Sunan Prawata. Arya Penangsang was a valiant yet vicious and fierce character, never hesitate to use brutal force to achieve his goals. Feeling threaten, Prawata's son Arya Pengiri, sought refuge in his aunt's realm in Kalinyamat, Jepara, trying to get away from the menace of Penangsang's men. Prawata's younger sister Ratu Kalinyamat sought justice from Sunan Kudus, the teacher of Penangsang. Sunan Kudus however, declined her request, since previously Prawata had committed the crime of assassinating Penangsang's father, Raden Kikin (Sekar Seda ing Lepen), thus rendering Penangsang's revenge justified. Disappointed, Ratu Kalinyamat went home with her husband, Sultan Hadlirin, from Kudus to Kalinyamat only to be attacked by Penangsang's men on their way back. Hadlirin was killed in this attack while Ratu Kalinyamat barely survived. Ratu Kalinyamat seeks revenge on Penangsang, for the death of her husband, Sultan Hadlirin. She urged her brother in-law, Hadiwijaya (popularly known as Jaka Tingkir), Duke of Pajang (now Boyolali), to kill Arya Penangsang. Arya Penangsang soon faced heavy opposition from his vassals due to his unlikeable character, and soon was dethroned by a coalition of vassals led by Hadiwijaya, Duke of Pajang, who had kinship with the King Trenggana. In 1568, Hadiwijaya sent his adopted son and also his son in-law Sutawijaya, who would later become the first ruler of the Mataram dynasty, to kill Penangsang. In 1568 Hadiwijaya assumed the role as the sovereign after Penangsang was killed. However, instead of ruling from Demak, he moved all of Demak's regalias, heirlooms and sacred artifacts to Pajang. He appointed Prawata's son Sunan Pangiri, as the adipati of Demak. This time however, it was the other way around; it was Pajang rose to become the suzerain kingdom, while Demak reduced to become a vassal of Pajang. Thus he ended Demak history when he founded his new kingdom: the short-lived Kingdom of Pajang. Economy Muria and Java still separated. Demak derived its income by trade: importing spices and exporting rice to Malacca and the Maluku Islands. Demak was a busy harbor with trade connection to Malacca and the Spices islands. It was located at the end of a channel that separated Java and Muria Island (the channel is now filled and Muria joined with Java). From the 15th century until the 18th century, the channel was wide enough and important waterway for ships traveling along northern Javanese coast to the Spices islands. In the channel also located Serang river, which enabled access to rice producing interior of Java. This strategic location enabled Demak to rise as a leading trading center in Java. According to Tome Pires, Demak had more inhabitants than any port in Sunda or Java. Demak was the main exporter of rice to Malacca. And with the rise of Malacca, so did Demak rise into prominence. Its supremacy also enhanced with claim of direct descent of Raden Patah to Majapahit royalty and his marriages ties with neighboring city- states. Religion Grand Mosque of Demak showing saka guru or four main wooden columns. The mosque was built in vernacular Javanese architecture. Before emergence of Demak, northern coast of Java was seat of many Muslim communities, both foreign merchants and local Javanese. The Islamisation process gained momentum from decline of Hindu-Buddhist Majapahit authority. Following fall of Majapahit capital to usurper from Kediri, Raden Patah declared Demak's independence from Majapahit overlordship, so did later nearly all northern Javanese ports. As the first Islamic polity in Java, Demak enjoys a venerated status among Indonesian Muslims. Demak is traditionally linked with the legendary revered Wali Songo, the nine Muslim ulama; preacher that proselytize Islamic faith among then strongly Hindu-Buddhist population of Java. Up until today, Islamic sites such as Demak Great Mosque and maqam (tombs) of Wali saints and Demak sultans continues to draw ziyarat pilgrimage among Muslims in the region. Javanese legends of Demak Later Javanese Babads chronicles provide varying accounts of Demak origin and conquest, but they all describe Demak as the legitimate direct successor of Majapahit although they do not mention the possibility that by the time of its final conquest, Majapahit was no longer ruled the area. The first 'Sultan' of Demak, Raden Patah, is portrayed as the son of Majapahit's last king by a Chinese princess who was exiled from the court before Patah's birth. Tradition mentioned that the Chinese princess was first served as Kertabhumi's (Brawijaya V) concubine in Trowulan, and later was sent away as a gift to be betrothed to the regent of Palembang. Unknowingly, that she was already pregnant with Majapahit king's son. Although these legends explain little about the actual events, they do suggest that the dynastic continuity survived Islamisation of Java. Or more likely, as Demak's attempt to reinforce their rule on Java, by claiming the link to Majapahit dynasty as the source of political legitimation, i.e. tracing back and providing the \\"right ancestor\\" for their first king to buttress his claim. Demak was more likely a coastal settlement established owed to Zheng He's Chinese expedition back in the first half of 15th century, ruled by non-Javanese foreigners; Chinese Muslims, possibly also attract Arabs and Malays Muslim traders, that politically grew substantially and manage to supplant the old kingdom.

Tom√°s de Herrera also became President of the Republic of the New Granada in 1854 during the rebellion against the incumbent president Jos√© Mar√≠a Melo. Herrera was born on December 21, 1804. He entered military service in 1822 and became a lieutenant. He participated in the battles of Jun√≠n and Ayacucho against the royalists in Peru. In 1828 he was charged with conspiracy, and jailed in Bogota. Herrera escaped, was recaptured and sentenced to death, but his sentence was commuted to banishment. Upon completion of sentence, he returned to Panama in 1830 and participated in the fight against Colonel Juan Eligio Alzuru. When Alzuru was shot, Herrera was appointed Colonel Commandant General of the Isthmus of Panama. He fought in the Cauca revolution in 1840 but the isthmus population did not want to join that conflict. A popular meeting in Panama on Nov. 18, 1840 voted for the separation of Panama from Colombia, under the name of the State of the Isthmus with Colonel Herrera as president. He then organized the economy and obtained that Costa Rica and the United States would recognize the new country. The State of the isthmus lasted only 13 months. An agreement to which Herrera opposed reconvened the union between Panama and Colombia, which lasted until 1903. Governor of Panama In 1845, Herrera returned to national political life as governor of Panama and later minister of War and Navy of the government of Jos√© Hilario L√≥pez. In 1850, he was appointed governor of the province of Cartagena and that same year he received the grade of general. In 1851 a revolution erupted in the provinces against the conservative government of President Jos√© Hilario L√≥pez, whereupon the government appointed military commanders to quell the insurgency. Herrera had to confront the governor of Antioquia, Col. Eusebio Borrero, who was defeated and considered General Herrera as a military genius. Rise to power Herrera was appointed by the presidency of Colombia in 1854 when he was a member of Congress. President Jos√© Mar√≠a Obando was ousted by a military coup on April 17 of that year. Vice President Jos√© de Obald√≠a met with Herrera and other characters in the Legation of the United States to try to assume power, offering Herrera the secretariat of war, nomination that the general refused because it deprived him of his congress seat. Days later, Herrera managed to evade military custody that the dictator Melo had established in Bogota. On April 21, he arrived to Chocont√°, where he declared himself exercising the executive power as a result of a letter of Obald√≠a stating that he was not able to form a government. Tasks of government Herrera appointed Colonel Anselmo Pineda as Secretary of State responsible for Finances, war and foreign relations. Herrera continued his march and entered on April 23 to Tunja, thanks to Colonel Reyes Patria won the national guard ensconced in the city, where he appointed General Manuel Maria Franco as commander of the army and Reyes Patria commander of the provinces of Tunja and Tundama. Franco managed to build an army of 2557 men, which was the second commander Gen. Marcelo Buitrago and chief of staff Colonel Jose Maria Rojas Pinz√≥n. Herrera came out with his army of Tunja to Nemoc√≥n, population they arrived on May 19, and which should take one of two decisions: attacking the column of Colonel Manuel Jimenez Stake Zipaquir√°, or continue the march up to join Honda to the forces commanded by General Joaqu√≠n Par√≠s Ricaurte. Herrera took the decision to attack Jimenez, on May 20, 1854 and the resulting Battle of Zipaquir√° was a disaster, where the constitutional forces were defeated necessarily. On the death of Franco, Herrera gave him the command of Army. Gen. Marcelo Buitrago, who has returned to the starting point of the battle, sought the departure of the troops to Tunja, while Herrera had taken the opposite direction, to continue with the plan original. With the support of the army Arboleda, Herrera rebuild the government appointing Ramon Mateus as secretary of war and foreign affairs, and Pastor Ospina Rodriguez as secretary of the interior and finance. They departed with a bataillon to join Paris but not succeeded, then sought to reach Ambalema by San Juan de Rioseco. At the port, Herrera named Tom√°s Cipriano de Mosquera as commander of Momp√≥s, Panama and Costa and sent instructions to the governors. Then he left for El Guamo where he was joined by Gen. Lopez and the governor of Cauca. Herrera was finally able to get to Ibague and install the executive branch, where he issued decrees which called on lawmakers to start meetings on July 20 in Bogota. On July 15, Herrera rebuild his cabinet, leaving Pastor Ospina in government, Jose Maria Soto Plata in Treasure, Ramon Mateus in Foreign Affairs and Pedro Alcantara Herran at war. On July 20 were 23 congressmen in Ibague, which did not allow Congress to sit for lack of quorum. Return to the ranks and death On August 5 Jos√© de Obald√≠a assumed executive authority, appointing Herrera second in command of the army in the North. On September 28 Piedecuesta was in command of his troops when he received the visit of General Mosquera, commander in chief of the army. On Sept. 25 they succeeded in crossing the river Chicamocha . On December 2 they reached the outskirts of Bogota with the column commanded by General Camilo Mendoza. On December 4, 1854 after the attack deployed by the army on the southern side of the city of Bogota, Herrera went into action in command of two battalions but he was seriously injured in the corner of the races Pamplona and B√°rbula, and died shortly after.

This combination is also called an engine-generator set or a gen-set. In many contexts, the engine is taken for granted and the combined unit is simply called a generator. An engine-generator may be a fixed installation, part of a vehicle, or made small enough to be portable. Components In addition to the engine and generator, engine-generators generally include a fuel supply, a constant engine speed regulator (governor) and a generator voltage regulator, cooling and exhaust systems, and lubrication system. Units larger than about 1 kW rating often have a battery and electric starter motor; very large units may start with compressed air either to an air driven starter motor or introduced directly to the engine cylinders to initiate engine rotation. Standby power generating units often include an automatic starting system and a transfer switch to disconnect the load from the utility power source when there is a power failure and connect it to the generator. A Cummins Onan transfer switch Types MAN diesel stationary engine and generator, now on outdoor museum display Engine-generators are available in a wide range of power ratings. These include small, hand-portable units that can supply several hundred watts of power, hand-cart mounted units that can supply several thousand watts and stationary or trailer-mounted units that can supply over a million watts. Regardless of the size, generators may run on gasoline, diesel, natural gas, propane, bio-diesel, water, sewage gas or hydrogen. Most of the smaller units are built to use gasoline (petrol) as a fuel, and the larger ones have various fuel types, including diesel, natural gas and propane (liquid or gas). Some engines may also operate on diesel and gas simultaneously (bi-fuel operation). = Engines = Many engine-generators use a reciprocating engine, with fuels mentioned above. This can be a steam engine, such as most coal-powered fossil- fuel power plants use. Some engine-generators use a turbine as the engine, such as the industrial gas turbines used in peaking power plants and the microturbines used in some hybrid electric buses. The generator voltage (volts), frequency (Hz) and power (watts) ratings are selected to suit the load that will be connected. Portable engine-generators may require an external power conditioner to safely operate some types of electronic equipment. Engine-driven generators fueled on natural gas fuel often form the heart of small-scale (less than 1,000 kW) combined heat and power installations. = Three phase = There are only a few portable three-phase generator models available in the US. Most of the portable units available are single-phase generators and most of the three-phase generators manufactured are large industrial type generators. In other countries where three-phase power is more common in households, portable generators are available from a few kW and upwards. = Inverter Generator = Small portable generators may use an inverter. Inverter models can run at slower RPMs to generate the power that is necessary, thus reducing the noise of the engine and making it more fuel-efficient. Inverter generators are best to power sensitive electronic devices such as computers and lights that use a ballast, as they have a low Total Harmonic Distortion. = Mid-size stationary engine-generator = Perkins diesel generator, manufactured by FG Wilson (Engineering) Ltd. This is a 100 kVA set The mid-size stationary engine-generator pictured here is a 100 kVA set which produces 415 V at around 110 A. It is powered by a 6.7-liter turbocharged Perkins Phaser 1000 Series engine, and consumes approximately 27 liters of fuel an hour, on a 400-liter tank. Diesel engines in the UK can run on red diesel and rotate at 1,500 or 3,000 rpm. This produces power at 50 Hz, which is the frequency used in Europe. In areas where the frequency is 60 Hz (United States), generators rotate at 1,800 rpm or another divisor of 3600. Diesel engine-generator sets operated at their peak efficiency point can produce between 3 and 4 kilowatt hours of electrical energy for each liter of diesel fuel consumed, with lower efficiency at partial loads. = Large scale generator sets = Many generators produce enough kilowatts to power anything from a business to a full-sized hospital. These units are particularly useful in providing backup power solutions for companies which have serious economic costs associated with a shutdown caused by an unplanned power outage. For example, a hospital is in constant need of electricity, because several life- preserving medical devices run on electricity, like ventilators. A very common use is a railway diesel electric locomotive, some units having over . Large generators are also used onboard ships that utilize a diesel-electric powertrain. Voltages and frequencies may vary in different installations. Applications Generator tie-in panel 1200-amp outdoor enclosure Engine- generators are used to provide electrical power in areas where utility (central station) electricity is unavailable, or where electricity is only needed temporarily. Small generators are sometimes used to provide electricity to power tools at construction sites. Trailer-mounted generators supply temporary installations of lighting, sound amplification systems, amusement rides etc. You can use a wattage chart to calculate the estimated power usage for different types of equipment to determine how many watts are necessary in a portable generator. Trailer-mounted generators or mobile generators, diesel generators are also used for emergencies or backup where either a redundant system is required or no generator is on site. To make the hookup faster and safer, a tie-in panel is frequently installed near the building switchgear that contains connectors such as camlocks. The tie-in panel may also contain a phase rotation indicator (for 3-phase systems) and a circuit breaker. Camlock connectors are rated for 400 amps up to 480-volt systems and used with 4/0 type W cable connecting to the generator. Tie-in panel designs are common between 200- and 3000-amp applications. Standby electrical generators are permanently installed and used to immediately provide electricity to critical loads during temporary interruptions of the utility power supply. Hospitals, communications service installations, data processing centers, sewage pumping stations and many other important facilities are equipped with standby power generators. Some standby power generators can automatically detect the loss of grid power, start the motor, run using fuel from a natural gas line, detect when grid power is restored, and then turn itself off‚Äîwith no human interaction. Home generators basics by L. Rozenblat 2008 Privately owned generators are especially popular in areas where grid power is undependable or unavailable. Trailer-mounted generators can be towed to disaster areas where grid power has been temporarily disrupted.  Safety  Some generators include a warning stating \\"Using a generator indoors will kill you in minutes\\" Every year, incorrectly used portable generators result in deaths from carbon monoxide poisoning. A 5.5 kW portable generator will generate the same amount of carbon monoxide as six cars, which can quickly build up to fatal levels if the generator has been placed indoors. Using portable generators in garages, or near open windows or air conditioning vents can also result in carbon monoxide poisoning. Additionally, it is important to prevent backfeeding when using a portable engine generator, which can harm utility workers or people in other buildings. Before turning on a diesel- or gasoline-powered generator, users should make sure that the main breaker is in the \\"off\\" position, to ensure that the electric current does not reverse. Exhausting extremely hot flue gases from gen-sets can be done by factory-built positive pressure chimneys (certified to UL 103 test standard) or general utility schedule 40 black iron pipe. It is recommended to use insulation to reduce pipe skin temperature and reduce excessive heat gain into the mechanical room. There are also excessive pressure relief valves available to relieve the pressure from potential backfires and to maintain the integrity of the exhaust pipe.

Life history and career  Beit was born in Hamburg, Germany, the younger brother of Alfred Beit, into the Jewish family of an affluent Hamburg trader. He went to England in 1888, where he joined the stockbroking firm of Wernher, Beit & Co., in which his brother Alfred Beit, was a partner. In 1890 he left for South Africa to gain experience in the diamond industry. He remained for six years and played an active role in the development of Rand Gold Mines and became a member of Hermann Eckstein's firm, H. Eckstein & Co. Despite playing a prominent part in the Witwatersrand gold industry, he returned to London, partly because he did not want to confine his interests solely to financial activities, but also to cultivate his scientific, artistic and cultural tastes. He became a naturalised British citizen in 1896. He fell under the spell of Cecil Rhodes's imperialist vision and was his house-guest at the time of the Jameson Raid. On his return to London, he followed for a few years the career of stockbroker and continued with his interest in the mining industry until the death of his brother Alfred, after which he retired and devoted himself for the remainder of his life to philanthropy.

World War I  The Corps saw service throughout the entirety of World War I, notably participating in the Battle of Passchendaele (as part of the French First Army).

After the 1940 campaign, commanded the 17th Military Region in 1940-1941 and then retired. Recalled in 1944 and retired again in 1945. as part of the French mobilization for war. Initially assigned as part of the French First Army, the corps was transferred to the French Seventh Army and moved to coastal regions near Calais and Dunkerque by mid-November 1939. On May 10, 1940, the Corps commanded the 25th Motorised Infantry Division (25e DIM) in addition to its organic units. With the German invasion violating the neutrality of Belgium and the Netherlands on May 10, 1940, the 1st Army Corps moved into Belgium with the goal of gaining contact with the Dutch Army. This was achieved on May 12 near Breda, but the general failure of the Allies to hold the German advance mandated early retreats so that the 1st Army Corps would not be cut off. Breda fell to the Germans on May 13 and the corps conducted a fighting withdrawal through Dorp and Wuustwezel to the fortified zone of Antwerp, Belgium. During May 15‚Äì17, the corps defended the Scheldt Estuary with the 60th and 21st Infantry Divisions (60e DI and 21e DI), but was ordered to retreat back into France on May 18.Grandes Unit√©s Fran√ßaises, Vol. I, p. 69 The period from May 19‚Äì26 saw the corps falling back to the line of the Somme River, where the French Army intended to make a major stand. Because of German advances, the 1st Army Corps had to deploy its divisional reconnaissance units to cover positions on the river that the slower-moving infantry divisions (4th Colonial Infantry Division - 4e DIC, 7th North African Infantry Division - 7e DINA, and the 19e DI) could then occupy. This required combat with the Germans, but the corps reached positions near Le Hamel, Aubigny, and along the road between Amiens and Saint-Quentin. During May 24‚Äì25, troops of the corps seized and lost Aubigny twice.Grandes Unit√©s Fran√ßaises, Vol. I, pp. 69-71 The Germans, however, had held onto a large bridgehead at Peronne. The Germans broke out of this bridgehead on June 5, 1940, and continued their advance into the heart of France. A counterattack by armored elements of the corps on June 6 was halted by the Germans. From June 9, the corps was involved in a succession of withdrawals that were meant to form lines of defense along the Avre, Oise, Nonette, Seine, and Loire rivers. The crossing of the Oise River was made under German air attack, some bridges were destroyed by the Luftwaffe, and portions of the corps' infantry had to surrender north of the Oise. After the Germans crossed the Loire River on June 18, the 19e DI of the corps was largely destroyed near La Fert√©. This was followed by capture of the bulk of the infantry of the 29th (29e DI) and 47th Infantry Divisions (47e DI) on June 19 near Lamotte-Beuvron.Grandes Unit√©s Fran√ßaises, Vol. I, p. 77 The final week of the campaign was a constant retreat for the remnants of the corps, with elements crossing the Dordogne River near Bergerac on June 24, 1940. The following day, an armistice was declared and the corps assembled in the region of Miallet and Thiviers. On July 1, Brigadier General TrancartJacques Marie Joseph Edmond Ignace Trancart, 1881-1952, commander of 1st Army Corps Artillery prior to assuming corps command. assumed command of the corps.

To the south, the German 90. Panzergrenadier-Division and the Reichsf√ºhrer-SS assault infantry brigade were evacuating Sardinia and landing on the southern coast of Corsica. Wishing to cut off the German troops, and informed on September 10, 1943, that the Italian troops on Corsica were willing to fight on the side of the Allies, the French launched Operation V√©suve and landed elements of the 1st Army Corps at Ajaccio on September 13, meeting Corsican partisans who also wanted enemy troops off the island.

After the Germans began disarming Italian soldiers, General MagliGiovanni Magli, 1884-1969, commander of the Centauro Armored Division prior to commanding VII Army Corps on Corsica, then GOC of Sardinia 1943-1944. of the Italian Army ordered Italian forces to consider the Germans as an enemy rather than as allies. Thereafter, Italian units on the island cooperated with the French forces. Surprising the Italian Friuli Division in the northern port of Bastia on the night of September 13, 1943, the SS troops took 2,000 Italian prisoners and secured the port from which the Germans could evacuate their forces. Although supported by the Royal Navy, the French were unable to land forces quickly enough on Corsica to prevent the bulk of the German troops from reaching their exit ports on the east coast of the island. The final combat took place around Bastia, with the island secured by French forces on October 4, 1943. The bulk of the German forces, however, had made good their escape. The Germans took 700 casualties and lost 350 men to POW camps. The Italians lost 800 men in the fighting (mostly Friuli Division troops), and the French had 75 killed, 12 missing, and 239 wounded.L'Arm√©e de la Victoire, Vol. I, p. 161 From October 1943 until May 1944, the 1st Army Corps defended Corsica, conducted training, and moved units between Corsica and North Africa.

Following the liberation of Corsica, the French proposed to invade the island of Elba, possession of which would allow the Allies to dominate by gunfire ships in the Piombino Channel and vehicles on the coastal road of the Italian peninsula, both transportation arteries essential to the supply of German forces in western Italy. Initially, the proposal was denied by General Eisenhower,Dwight David Eisenhower, 1890-1969, Commander in Chief Allied Expeditionary Force Mediterranean, then Commander in Chief Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force in 1944-1945, postwar U.S. Army Chief of Staff and President of the United States. who considered it a dispersal of resources while the planning for the Anzio landings was underway.

At 0400 hours on June 17, 1944, the 1st Army Corps assaulted Elba in Operation Brassard. French forces comprised the 9th Colonial Infantry Division (9e DIC), two battalions of French commandos (Commandos d'Afrique and Commandos de Choc), a battalion and supplementary battery of the Colonial Artillery Regiment of Morocco (R.A.C.M.) and the 2nd Group of Moroccan Tabors (2e GTM), in addition to 48 men from \\"A\\" and \\"O\\" commandos of the Royal Navy.BBC - WW2 People's War - Operation Brassard The Invasion of Elba French Choc (lightly armed fighters who had the mission of operating behind enemy lines) units landed at multiple points before the main landing force and neutralized coastal artillery batteries. Landing in the Gulf of Campo on the south coast, the French initially ran into difficulties because of the German fortifications and extremely rugged terrain that ringed the landing area. Falling back on an alternate plan, the landing beach was shifted to the east, near Nercio, and here the troops of the 9th Colonial Infantry Division seized a viable beachhead. Within two hours, French commandos reached the crest of the 400-meter Monte Tambone Ridge overlooking the landing areas. The RN commandos boarded and seized the German Flak ship K√∂ln and also landed to guide in other troops headed for the beaches, but a massive blast from a German demolition charge killed 38 of their men. Portoferraio was taken by the 9th Division on June 18 and the island was largely secured by the following day. Fighting in the hills between the Germans and the Senegalese colonial infantry was vicious, with the Senegalese employing flamethrowers to clear entrenched German troops.The History of the French First Army, p.45 The Germans defended Elba with two infantry battalions, fortified coastal areas, and several coastal artillery batteries totaling some 60 guns of medium and heavy caliber. In the fighting, the French seized the island, killing 500 German and Italian defenders, and taking 1,995 of them prisoner. French losses were 252 killed and missing, and 635 men wounded in action, while the British lost 38 of their 48 commandos, with nine others wounded by the blast of the demolition charge. = France 1944 = Advance of U.S. and French forces after landing in southern France, August - September, 1944. The Belfort Gap forced and the formation of the Colmar Pocket, November - December, 1944. The Battle of the Colmar Pocket, January 20 - February 9, 1945. Following the successful Operation Dragoon landings in southern France, the headquarters of the 1st Army Corps was assembled at Aix, France on September 1, 1944, to command troops as a subordinate corps of the French First Army. 1st Army Corps was now under the command of Lieutenant General √âmile B√©thouart,Marie √âmile Antoine B√©thouart, 1890-1982, commander of the 1re DLC, French forces in Norway, sub- Division Rabat, and Division Casablanca, as well as head of the French military mission to Washington prior to assuming command of 1st Army Corps.

For the remainder of the war in Europe, many French divisions would be subordinated to 1st Army Corps, but the divisions that spent the most time with the corps were the 2nd Moroccan Infantry Division (2e DIM), the 9th Colonial Infantry Division (9e DIC), the 4th Moroccan Mountain Division (4e DMM), and the 1st Armoured Division (1re DB). 1st Army Corps drove north along the east bank of the Rh√¥ne River, but the push lacked strength as the 4e DMM was still deploying to France (and would be further engaged securing the alpine frontier with Italy for several months) and the 1re DB was still assembling in southern France. In mid- September, the corps secured the Lomont Mountains, a range about long running from the Doubs River to the Swiss border. German resistance was spotty in September, but rapidly coalesced in front of the Belfort Gap, a corridor of relatively flat terrain that lies between the Vosges and Jura mountains on the Swiss frontier, and a gateway to the Rhine river. Operating with one division and experiencing the same logistics problems as other Allied units in Europe, the advance of the 1st Army Corps was slowed in front of the Belfort Gap by the German 11. Panzer-Division. Compounding the distance that supplies had to travel from the ports in southern France were the north‚Äìsouth railway lines with destroyed bridges and sections of track. Early October 1944 also saw the unseasonably early arrival of cold and wet weather more characteristic of November. All of these factors served to force a halt to the 1st Army Corps' advance in October while the corps improved its supply situations and resolved manpower issues caused by the French high command's decision to rotate the Senegalese troops to the south and replace them with FFI manpower. The supply situation had improved by early November, coinciding with orders from General Eisenhower, now in charge of all Allied forces in northwestern Europe, directing a general offensive all along the Western Front. Believing that the relative inactivity of 1st Army Corps meant the corps was digging in for the winter, the Germans reduced their forces in the Belfort Gap to a single, not- at-full strength infantry division. The 1st Army Corps launched their attack to force the Belfort Gap on November 13, 1944. By a stroke of fate, the French attack caught the German division commander near the front lines, who perished under a hail of Moroccan gunfire.Generalleutnant Hans Oschmann, 1894-1944, commander of the 286. Sicherungs-Division in 1943-1944 prior to taking command of the 338. Infanterie-Division on September 18, 1944.Riviera to the Rhine, p. 413 The same attack narrowly missed capturing the commander of the German IV. Luftwaffen-Feldkorps. Although desperate German troops formed islands of resistance, most notably at the fortified city of Belfort, troops of the 2e DIM, 9e DIC, and the 1re DB pushed through gaps in the German lines, disrupting their defense and keeping the battle mobile. French tanks moved through the Belfort Gap and reached the Rhine River at Huningue on November 19. The battle cut off the German 308. Grenadier-Regiment on November 24, forcing the German troops to either surrender or intern themselves in Switzerland. On November 25, 1st Army Corps units liberated both Mulhouse (taken by a surprise armored drive) and Belfort (taken by assault of the 2e DIM). Realizing the German defense had been too static for their own good, General De Lattre (commander of the French First Army) directed both corps of his army to close on Burnhaupt in order to encircle the German LXIII. Armeekorps (the former IV. Luftwaffe Korps). This maneuver succeeded on November 28, 1944, and resulted in the capture of over 10,000 German troops, crippling the LXIII. Armeekorps.Riviera to the Rhine, p. 431 French losses, however, had also been significant, and plans to immediately clear the Alsatian Plain of German forces had to be shelved while both sides gathered strength for the next battles. The November offensives of the French First Army and the U.S. Seventh Army had collapsed the German presence in Alsace to a roughly circular pocket around the town of Colmar on the Alsatian Plain. This Colmar Pocket contained the German 19. Armee. As the southernmost corps of Allied forces in northwestern Europe, the French 1st Army Corps now faced the Rhine at Huningue and held Mulhouse and the southern boundary of the Colmar Pocket. A French offensive in mid-December designed to collapse the Colmar Pocket failed for lack of offensive power and the requirement to cover more of the Allied front line as U.S. units were shifted north in response to the Ardennes Offensive. On January 1, 1945, the Germans launched Operation Nordwind, an offensive with the goal of recapturing Alsace. After the U.S. Seventh and French First Armies had held and turned back this offensive, the Allies were ready to reduce the Colmar Pocket once and for all. The 1st Army Corps led the attack against the Colmar Pocket on January 20, 1945. Fighting in woodlands and dense urban areas, the 1st Army Corps attack stalled after the first day, meeting a German defense in depth and attracting German 19. Armee reinforcements. By the end of the month, however, other attacks by U.S. and French forces against the Colmar Pocket had forced the Germans to redistribute their troops, and an early February attack by the 1st Army Corps moved north through weak German resistance, reaching the bridge over the Rhine at Chalamp√© and making contact with the U.S. XXI Corps at Rouffach, south of Colmar. The final German forces in the 1st Army Corps area retreated over the Rhine into Baden on February 9, 1945. Thereafter, the thrust of the Allied offensive moved to the north, and the 1st Army Corps was assigned the defense of the Rhine River from the area south of Strasbourg to the Swiss frontier until mid-April 1945. = Germany 1945 = French 1st Army operations, April 15 - May 8, 1945.On April 15, 1st Army Corps was given the mission of crossing the Rhine, traversing the Black Forest, and sweeping south Baden of German troops. The 4e DMM drove directly on Freudenstadt, an important Black Forest road junction, capturing it on April 17, 1945. The 9e DIC, crossing the Rhine north of Karlsruhe, raced south along the east bank of the Rhine and then swung east, paralleling the course of the Swiss frontier. From Freudenstadt, the 4e DMM turned south and met the 9e DIC near D√∂ggingen on April 29, cutting off the German XVIII. SS-Armeekorps in the Black Forest. Frantic attempts at escape by the encircled German troops came to naught among French roadblocks and the formidable terrain of the forest, and they were left no options save death or surrender. From Freudenstadt, elements of the 1re DB pushed east and south, capturing Ulm on April 24, and then pushed south again with elements of the 2e DIM into the Alps, crossing into Austria and marching into Sankt-Anton on May 7, 1945. Elements of the 5e DB and the 4e DMM drove southeast along the north shore of Lake Constance, capturing Bregenz and then turning east toward Sankt-Anton. The following day was VE Day, ending Allied military operations in Europe. During the course of its operations in France and Germany in 1944 - 1945, the 1st Army Corps lost 3,518 men killed, 13,339 wounded, and 1,449 missing, for a total of 18,306 casualties. Although not all casualties inflicted on the Germans by 1st Army Corps are known, the corps is credited with taking 101,556 Germans prisoner during the campaigns to liberate France and invade Germany.Grandes Unit√©s Fran√ßaises, Vol. V-III, p. 801 = Commanders in WW II = * 2 September 1939 - 2 July 1940 : G√©n√©ral Sciard * 2‚Äì10 July 1940 : G√©n√©ral Trancart * . * 30 August 1943 - 10 August 1944 : G√©n√©ral Martin * 10 August 1944 - 8 July 1945 : G√©n√©ral B√©thouart * 1 September 1945 - 6 June 1946 : G√©n√©ral Sevez  Postwar  After VE Day, the 1st Army Corps occupied Baden, parts of W√ºrttemberg, and Austria, with corps headquarters initially in Ravensburg.

Haticepinar is located in Turkey inhabited by Kurdish people. History Haticepinar has acquired the status of a village in 1950 and according to the knowledge of the elderly who still reside in Haticepinar acclaim that people first settled in the area as far as 130 to 150 years ago. Inhabitants of Haticepinari are related to the nearby village of Ka≈üanlƒ±. The name Ka≈üanlƒ± is derived from the Kasan city in Iran and according to the elderly of the region Kurdish people that were oppressed by the Persian King left the city of Kasan moving north-west and eventually settling in the current area. Culture People of Haticepinari are Kurdish hence the main language spoken is Kurdish (Kurmanji dialect) language. Local people have retained their Kurdish traditions that include the traditional dressing code, Kurdish cuisine and special methods of cooking. Traditional folk dance is still performed by the local people at occasions such as weddings and musical instruments such as Baglama and Kaval are played by majority of the people. Geography Haticepinar is 55 km away from Af≈üin and 205 km from Kahramanmara≈ü Province. Haticepƒ±nar, Af≈üin Haticepinar is located on the mountainous region of the Binboƒüa Mountains and for this arable lands are limited. On the west of the village is the village of Oglakkaya, on the south is the Orenli village, on the north is the Guldede village of G√ºr√ºn and on the east are the neighbouring Kavak villages. Climate Altitude wise, Haticepinar is the highest village of the local region. This has led to the area experiencing significantly colder winters with heavy snowfall. Despite its colds winters, summer season at Haticepinar is very warm with temperatures rising to as high as 38-40¬∞C. Population According to Government Statistics Institution there are 70 houses in the village and 1990 census shows that the population was 176, in 1997 census the population had dropped to 124. In 2009 the figure was 84. Economy Due to declining agricultural resources of the area the increasing population could not be supported with the available resources and this has led to migration to larger cities or even to several European countries or other continents. The current economy still relies of agriculture and farming. In recent years, apricots have been produced although this is not at a large scale. Other crops that are grown in the area include wheat, barley and chickpeas. Dairy products are obtained from the cows, sheep and goats that are owned by the inhabitants. Other information Haticepinar has a primary school that is currently not in use due to shortage of teachers in the region. Water for domestic use and for drinking is obtained from the several wells in the village and there are also two fountains. Work has been started in 2005 to build water system to homes which is due to completion in summer of 2007. The village has no health care clinic with local/regional nurses visiting the village a few times a year. The main transport link to major towns is a gravel road. Haticepinar has electricity but no telephone services therefore people have to travel to nearby villages that have telephone services. 10-15 Minutes from the village is the Maden Dagi (Mine Mountain) which has one of the richest marble mines of the region. In the recent years government lead companies have excavated the top of the mountain and marbles were obtained which were then used mainly in building work, decorations or as exports.

Though at present, it can hardly be recognized as a river due to immense pollution and population. But it is believed that once the great poet Rabindranath Tagore had come and wrote a poem about the Anjana river and a temple beside it. That temple can still be found beside the Anjana river. =Area overview= Nadia district is mostly alluvial plains lying to the east of Hooghly River, locally known as Bhagirathi. The alluvial plains are cut across by such distributaries as Jalangi, Churni and Ichhamati. With these rivers getting silted up, floods are a recurring feature.Gangopadhyay, Basudev, Paschimbanga Parichay, 2001, , p. 70, Sishu Sahitya SansadThe Ranaghat subdivision has the Bhagirathi on the west, with Purba Bardhaman and Hooghly districts lying across the river. Topographically, Ranaghat subdivision is spread across the Krishnanagar- Santipur Plain, which occupies the central part of the district, and the Ranaghat-Chakdaha Plain, the low-lying area found in the south-eastern part of the district. The Churni separates the two plains. A portion of the east forms the boundary with Bangladesh. The lower portion of the east is covered by a portion of the North 24 Parganas district.The subdivision has achieved reasonably high urbanisation. 41.68% of the population lives in urban areas and 58.32% lives in rural areas. Note: The map alongside presents some of the notable locations in the subdivision. All places marked in the map are linked in the larger full screen map. All the four subdivisions are presented with maps on the same scale ‚Äì the size of the maps vary as per the area of the subdivision.

It provides free legal advice on human rights and EU law issues in Europe, and seeks to promote the dissemination of information about international human rights law throughout Europe. History The charity states its mission as: Founded in 1993 by human rights lawyer Nuala Mole, it has provided advice and information to more than 8000 individuals on their rights under the two European legal orders (European Union Law and the European Convention on Human Rights). They develop their function by: * Providing free legal advice to other lawyers and advisers in the voluntary sector * Providing free legal advice to individuals directly * Taking cases to the European Court of Human Rights * Carrying out training and drafting reports and other publications Funding The charity gains funding from various sources, including the Equality and Human Rights Commission (April 2009 to April 2012, ¬£185,906), the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund and Comic Relief. Controversy The charity has backed a number of controversial test cases at the European Court of Human Rights: * In 2011, it represented Somali illegal immigrants ‚Äì Abdisamad Sufi, who since entering the UK in 2003 had 17 convictions for offences including burglary, fraud, threats to kill and indecent exposure; and Abdiaziz Elmi, a drug addict with convictions for drugs and theft ‚Äì against the UK Border Agency who were requesting deportation. The ECtHR ruled in favour of the two, stating that return to Somalia in light of their activities in the UK could be a violation of Article 3 (prohibition of inhuman or degrading treatment) of the European Convention on Human Rights if the pair were sent back to Mogadishu, resulting in their facing ill treatment under local Sharia law. The charity later requested and gained ECtHR legal approval to extend the arrangement to 214 other named illegal Somali immigrants. * 2011: appealed on behalf of Nigerian national Akindoyn Akinshipe, who aged 15 attacked and raped a 13-year-old girl. Convicted and handed a four-year sentence for rape, he was advised aged 16 whilst in jail that on completion of his sentence he would be deported. Akinshipe immediately appealed the decision through both the UK and ECtHR courts process for eight years, before being arrested again aged 24 by the UK Border Agency for deportation. Held at an immigration detention centre, AIRE appealed to the ECtHR under Article 8 of the ECHR that deportation would detrimentally affect his right to \\"Private and Family life\\", which the ECtHR agreed with. * In 2005 it backed convicted murderer John Hirst in his appeal to the ECtHR regarding the blanket ban on prisoners' voting rights. Since the successful ruling, AIRE have made further appeals to the ECtHR, and lobbied various parties, groups and politicians at Westminster * 2013: brought test cases to the ECtHR arguing for the right of EU immigrants not to have to undergo a residency test before they can claim a host of benefits. The European Commission referred the United Kingdom to the EU's European Court of Justice in Luxembourg over the right to reside test.

It was first announced at \\"Konami Gamers' Day\\" in early 2003. The game received generally positive reviews from video game critics, but it failed to garner sales and is often regarded as one of the most sought after handheld games. Gameplay Ninja Five-O is an action game is centered around Joe Osugi, a ninja tasked with stopping a terrorist group influenced by the Mad Masks, masks that give the wearer obscene power. As Osugi, the player must defeat the terrorists and rescue hostages through six missions with three levels and a boss battle. Development The game was developed by Hudson Soft. Ninja Five-O was first announced in January 2003 during \\"Konami Gamers' Day\\", where they announced along with fifteen other games they would publish in 2003. Despite being developed and published by Japanese video game companies, it was never released in Japan for reasons unknown. The US box art was illustrated by Julie Giles, who designed other Konami packaging such as the Castlevania and Metal Gear franchises. Ninja Five-O was released in North America and Europe in April 2003. Reception Upon release of the game, Ninja Five-O received \\"favorable\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. It was chosen as runner-up for \\"GBA Game of the Month\\" by IGN for the month of April 2003, behind Golden Sun: The Lost Age. In a retrospective review from Nintendo Life, Perry Wild praised its level design for having a balance between the platforming and combat aspects in the game. Ninja Five-O received awards and nominations from several gaming publications. GameSpy named it the third best Game Boy Advance game of 2003, as well as the Best Platform Game for the system. It was also chosen as the \\"Best Game No One Played\\" by IGN. IGN later listed it at number 23 in their list of the top 25 Game Boy Advance games of all time. In 2008, CraveOnline featured the game among top 10 Ninja games of all time, calling it \\"weird, fun, challenging, and a great homage to another awesome ninja game from the 8-bit era, Shadow of the Ninja\\". According to GameFan, \\"Ninja Five-O was one of the biggest sleeper hits of 2003. Given lackluster sales it‚Äôs unlikely to spawn a sequel, but with everything it got right the first time one can only imagine what might have been.\\" Ninja Five-O is now seen as one of the most sought after games for the Game Boy Advance, with IGN listing it as \\"Extremely Rare\\".

When combined with basic electronic circuitry, the sensor detects the change in presence or proximity of ferrous objects. With more complex circuitry and the addition of software and specific mechanical hardware, a VR sensor can also provide measurements of linear velocity, angular velocity, position, and torque.  Uses and applications  A VR sensor used as a simple proximity sensor can determine the position of a mechanical link in a piece of industrial equipment. A Crankshaft position sensor (in an automobile engine) is used to provide the angular position of the crankshaft to the Engine control unit. The Engine control unit can then calculate engine speed (angular velocity). Speed sensors used in automobile transmissions, are used to measure the rotational speed (angular velocity) of shafts within the transmission. The Engine control unit or Transmission control unit (depending on the particular automobile) uses these sensors to determine when to shift from one gear to the next. A pickup used in an electric guitar (or other musical instrument) detect vibrations of the metallic \\"strings\\". See Pickup (music technology) for details of this application.  Construction  This sensor consists of a permanent magnet, a ferromagnetic pole piece, and coil of wire.  Interface circuits  VR sensors need waveform shaping for their output to be digitally readable. The normal output of a VR sensor is an analog signal, shaped much like a sine wave. The frequency and amplitude of the analog signal is proportional to the target's velocity. This waveform needs to be squared up, and flattened off by a comparator like electronic chip to be digitally readable. While discrete VR sensor interface circuits can be implemented, the semiconductor industry also offers integrated solutions. Examples are the MAX9924 to MAX9927 VR sensor interface IC from Maxim Integrated products, LM1815 VR sensor amplifier from National Semiconductor and NCV1124 from ON semiconductor. An integrated VR sensor interface circuit like the MAX9924 features a differential input stage to provide enhanced noise immunity, Precision Amplifier and Comparator with user enabled Internal Adaptive Peak Threshold or user programmed external threshold to provide a wide dynamic range and zero-crossing detection circuit to provide accurate phase Information. Reluctor rings  The reluctor ring on an ABS-Sensor To measure angular position or rotational speed of a shaft, a toothed ring made of ferrous material can be attached to the shaft. As the teeth of the rotating wheel (or other target features) pass by the face of the magnet, the amount of magnetic flux passing through the magnet and consequently the coil varies. When the gear tooth is close to the sensor, the flux is at a maximum. When the tooth is further away, the flux drops off. The moving target results in a time-varying flux that induces a proportional voltage in the coil. Subsequent electronics are then used to process this signal to get a waveform that can be more readily counted and timed. This system has been employed in automotive electronic ignition and ABS braking. By attaching two reluctor rings to a shaft, the torque can be measured. The tooth spacing on reluctor rings may be uniform, or uneven.  Advantages and disadvantages  Although VR sensors are based on very mature technology, they still offer several significant advantages. The first is low cost - coils of wire and magnets are relatively inexpensive. Unfortunately, the low cost of the transducer is partially offset by the cost of the additional signal- processing circuitry needed to recover a useful signal. And because the magnitude of the signal developed by the VR sensor is proportional to target speed, it is difficult to design circuitry to accommodate very-low-speed signals. A given VR-sensing system has a definite limit as to how slow the target can move and still develop a usable signal. An alternative but more expensive technology is Hall effect sensor. Hall effect sensors are true zero- rpm sensors and actively supply information even when there's no transmission motion at all. One area in which VR sensors excel, however, is in high- temperature applications. Because operating temperature is limited by the characteristics of the materials used in the device, with appropriate construction VR sensors can be made to operate at temperatures in excess of 300 ¬∞C. An example of such an extreme application is sensing the turbine speed of a jet engine or engine cam shaft and crankshaft position control in an automobile.

Melville was an active member of the presbyterian resistance to the ecclesiastical policies of both James VI and Charles I. She was a personal friend of leading figures in the presbyterian opposition, whose frustration eventually erupted in 1637 in the Edinburgh Prayerbook Riots, leading to the National Covenant of February 1638, the Glasgow General Assembly which abolished the episcopate, and the outbreak of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms.See, inter alia, Rev.

Despite inheriting his father's protestant convictions, Sir James began his career as a page to Mary, Queen of Scots in France in 1549. Like his brothers Robert Melville of Murdocairnie and Andrew Melville of Garvock, James later served Mary in Scotland, and remained loyal to her after her fall and forced abdication. The Melville brothers would nonetheless eventually go on to become loyal and valued servants of Mary's son, King James VI of Scotland. Sir Robert became treasurer-depute in 1582, Sir Andrew became master of the household to King James (having served the imprisoned Mary in that capacity during her English captivity), and Sir James would resume his wide-ranging diplomatic activities. His Memoirs of His Own Life, written in old age for the political education of his heir, are a well-known historical source. Sir James's long association with a French court notable for highly educated women, who both wrote and published their works, may well have inspired his decision to have his daughters well educated, presumably at the family home, the long-vanished Halhill Tower near Colessie. Sir James had inherited Halhill from his adoptive father, the lawyer Henrie Balnaves, a close friend of the Reformer John Knox. Like Knox, Balnaves had been banished to serve a penal sentence in France. The theme of the persecuted Christian elect is prominent in Eizabeth Melville's poetry; between her father's absolute commitment to the Reformed faith, her paternal grandfather's ‚Äòmartyr‚Äô status, and the suffering for the faith of her adoptive grandfather Balnaves, her protestant antecedents were impeccable. In the summer of 1569, Sir James Melville married Christian Boswell (d.1609), one of the many daughters of David Boswell, laird of Balmuto in Fife.Henry Balnaves died in February 1570, and as historians have noted, his testament, whereof his adopted son Sir James was executor, makes no mention of the latter's wife. But the marriage contract (National Records of Scotland, RD1/ 9, f.444v et seq.) is dated 11 and 12 June 1569, and stipulates that the marriage must be celebrated by Lammas (1 August) that year. The contract is discussed and quoted by David Laing, ed The Works of John Knox, 6 vols.(Wodrow Society : Edinburgh, 1846‚Äì64), iii, 416. David Boswell was a Catholic who had welcomed a visit of Mary, Queen of Scots to his home as an opportunity to celebrate Mass.Joseph Bain, Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1563-1569, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1900), p. 138. The Boswell family was well-connected to King James VI; George Boswell was a royal surgeon, and David's heir, his grandson John Boswell, laird of Balmuto had lent the king money to help pay for the royal wedding voyage to Scandinavia. He was knighted with his son and heir at the baptism of Prince Henry Frederick in 1594.\\"Boswell,\\" The Scottish Nation. Christian Boswell is listed, along with nineteen siblings and their spouses, in Sir Robert Douglas, The Baronage of Scotland (Edinburgh, 1798), p. 310. For the story of her nephew‚Äôs loan to the king, see the anonymous article ‚ÄòPecuniary Distress of James VI‚Äô in Blackwood‚Äôs Edinburgh Magazine, no. 2 (October 1817 ‚Äì March 1818), pp. *312‚Äì313 (accessible via Google Books). Sir James Melville and Christian Boswell had five children (dates of birth unknown): James, Robert, Margaret, Elizabeth and Christian. James, who inherited Halhill, shared a father-in-law with Elizabeth, namely Alexander Colville (d.1597), Commendator of the Abbey at Culross, judge and privy councillor.See Sir James Balfour Paul, ed. Scots Peerage, 9 vols (Edinburgh, 1904‚Äì1914), vi, 91‚Äì92. Robert Melville trained for the ministry and for many years assisted the minister of Culross, Mr. Robert Colville, another son of Commendator Alexander.Tweedie, Select Biographies, i, 332-33. Margaret Melville married Sir Andrew Balfour of Montquhany in Fife.Contract of 27 December 1589; National Records of Scotland (NRS), RD1/34, f. 240 et seq. He was another laird knighted at the baptism of Prince Henry Frederick in 1594. Christian married John Bonar of Lumquhat in Fife.See St Andrews University Library, MSdep94/2, a charter of January 1631. Archibald Douglas sent Sir James Melville's daughter, presumably Elizabeth, a pair of virginals from London as a present in 1589.HMC Salisbury Hatfield, vol. 3 (London, 1889), p. 398. = Marriage = Culross situated on the north coast of the Firth of Forth; the village from which Melville took her courtesy title, Lady Culross. Elizabeth's marriage contract has not survived, but it is clear from the signatures to a legal document of February 1597 that by that date, she was already married to John Colville.NRS, RD1/59, f.96v: 5 February 1597, Tack by Sir Andrew Balfour of Montquhanie ‚Äòwith expres assent & consent of Margaret Melville my spous‚Äô. Signatories include Margaret and Sir James Melville of Halhill; the witnesses include James Melville and ‚ÄòJohne Colville of Comrie‚Äô. On 16 February 1599,In the print, the year is ‚Äò1598‚Äô, because the year changed on Lady Day (25 March) in Scotland ‚Äì until 1600, when it was promulgated that it should start on 1 January. Alexander Hume would end the epistle dedicating his Hymnes and Sacred Songs (Edinburgh, 1599) with the injunction ‚Äò Love your husband: have a modest care of your family‚Äô, which suggests the existence of more than one child: see Alexander Lawson, ed. The Poems of Alexander Hume (Scottish Text Society: Edinburgh, 1902), pp. 4‚Äì5. John Colville was styled ‚Äòof West Comrie‚Äô (Cumrie Wester, Wester-Cumbrae), an estate a little to the north-east of Culross, and in keeping with the Scottish custom of calling landowners (including farmers) by the name of their property, his wife was initially known as ‚ÄòLady Comrie‚Äô (it is simply wrong to call her ‚ÄòElizabeth Colville‚Äô: Scotswomen retained their maiden names). In addition to West Comrie, John Colville owned the lands of Lurg and Kincardine, just to the west of Culross. John Colville is frequently described as ‚ÄòJohn, Lord Colville of Culross‚Äô, a peerage title that he never held.The entirely erroneous elevation of John Colville to the peerage originates with Sir Robert Douglas, The Peerage of Scotland, rev. Wood (1813), I, 354, where it is claimed that the 2nd Lord Colville of Culross died heirless in 1640, whereas he actually died (in Ireland) in 1654 leaving two sons who had no heirs and whose legitimacy has been doubted. See Sir James Balfour Paul, Scots Peerage, ii, p. 558-59; he says there is no proof of illegitimacy. Douglas‚Äôs mistake led W.K. Tweedie to designate John Colville of West Comrie ‚ÄòLord Colville‚Äô in his influential and widely cited printing of some of Elizabeth Melville‚Äôs Letters to John Livingstone, Select Biographies, I, 349. The \\"Colville of Culross\\" peerage was created in 1604 and confirmed in 1609 for John Colville's cousin, Sir James Colville (1550‚Äì1629) of East Wemyss.Scots Peerage, ii, 560-61. Sir James, 1st Lord Colville of Culross, was the distinguished son of another James Colville, the older half-brother (d.1562) of John Colville‚Äôs father, Alexander commendator of Culross. Sir James was much-appreciated by King James as a soldier and diplomat. He had fought on behalf of Henri de Navarre during the French Wars of Religion, and retained close links with the French court until the end of his eventful life. His own line failed c.1678, in Ireland, and then the title of Lord Colville came to the descendants of Elizabeth Melville and John Colville of West Comrie, although it was not claimed by them until 1722.See Sir James Balfour Paul, ed. Scots Peerage, ii, 546-48 and 553-57. Note that in 'The \\"real\\" Dr Alexander Colville of Galgorm' (see Bibliography), p. 62, James Reid Baxter has misidentified Commendator Alexander's half- brother Sir James (d.1562), stating that he was Alexander‚Äôs father. The half- brothers James and Alexander were in fact the sons of the twice-married Sir James Colville of Ochiltree and East Wemyss (d.1540), who also fathered the illegitimate Robert Colville of Cleish. All three branches of the Fife Colvilles were therefore descendants of Sir James of Ochiltree and East Wemyss. On the death of his father in 1597, John Colville became titular Commendator of Culross. As the title pages of the second and third editions (?1604, 1606) of Ane Godlie Dreame show, Elizabeth Melville soon became known as ‚ÄòLady Culross younger‚Äô, rather than ‚ÄòLady Comrie‚Äô (the elder ‚ÄòLady Culross‚Äô was her mother-in-law). She continued to be known as Lady Culross for the rest of her life, despite the fact that John Colville resigned the title of Commendator of Culross in 1609. Elizabeth's surviving letters, held in Edinburgh University Library, prove that she and John Colville had at least seven children: Alexander, James, Robert, John, Samuel, and at least two daughters: one unnamed, who died before 1625, and Christian.See J. Reid- Baxter, \\"Elizabeth Melville's letters in Edinburgh University Library, Laing III.347\\" in Notes and Queries, (OUP), December 2006, pp. 525‚Äì528. Imperfect transcriptions of eight holograph letters to John Livingstone were published, with no attempt to establish their chronological order, by W. K. Tweedie in his Select Biographies, I, 349-70. The probable chronological order of all twelve extant letters is suggested in J. Reid-Baxter,'Elizabeth Melville, Lady Culross: Two Letters to her Son James', in E Ewan and J Nugent (eds.) Children and Youth in Medieval and Early Modern Scotland (Martlesham: Boydell and Brewer, 2015), pp. 205‚Äì19, at 218 (fn. 82). Alexander, Robert, John and the deceased daughter appear in a letter of 29 January 1629 to her son James.See J. Reid-Baxter,'Elizabeth Melville, Lady Culross: Two Letters to her Son James', p. 213. The financial problems that Melville recounts in this letter indicate that her husband was a poor estate-manager, and from her comments in another letter it seems that John Colville also had shortcomings as a family man: Melville wrote that the death of her clerical brother-in-law Robert was 'a soir strok to this congregatioun, and chiefly to me, to quhom he wes not only a pastour and a brother, bot, under God, a husband and a father to my children. Nixt his awin familie, I have the greattest los'.To John Livingstone, 25 March 1631. Tweedie, Select Biographies, i, 358. Robert Colville, a strong presbyterian, had died on 25 February 1631. For Robert‚Äôs presbyterian activism, see under ‚ÄòCulross‚Äô in Fasti Ecclesiae Scoticanae, v, 14, which identifies him as son of the commendator, Alexander, but does not even mention his eldest brother John Colville of West Comrie. Elizabeth Melville's children Information about Elizabeth's children is far from plentiful. With the exception of Elizabeth's eldest and youngest sons, Alexander and Samuel, what is known mostly stems from her extant letters, above all from the two she wrote to her son James, in 1625 and 1629. These were edited and published only in 2015.J. Reid Baxter, ‚ÄòElizabeth Melville, Lady Culross: Two Letters to her Son James‚Äô, in E. Ewan and J. Nugent (eds.) Children and Youth in Medieval and Early Modern Scotland (Martlesham: Boydell and Brewer, 2015), pp. 205‚Äì219. See also J. Reid-Baxter, ‚ÄúElizabeth Melville's letters in Edinburgh University Library, Laing III.347‚Äù in Notes and Queries, (OUP), December 2006, pp. 525‚Äì528. Imperfect transcriptions of eight holograph letters to John Livingstone were published, with no attempt to establish their chronological order, by W. K. Tweedie in his Select Biographies, I, 349-70. In 1817, Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe had published another letter to Livingstone, in his edition of The Secret and True History of the Church of Scotland by the Rev. Mr James Kirkton, p. 51. From the first letter, we learn of the unnamed daughter, who died piously after a hard struggle at an unknown date; she is also mentioned in the second letter, written to James at court in London. It tells us that James was under the patronage of Sir Robert Kerr of Ancram, and that his brothers John and Robert were in Sweden (presumably as soldiers) with Robert Leslie.Robert Leslie of Kinclaven, 3rd son of Patrick Lindsay, 1st Lord Lindores. See the online Scotland, Scandinavia and Northern European Database (SSNE); Robert Leslie‚Äôs SSNE identity no. is 2932. There is no record in SSNE for either of the Colville brothers. John had kept up his learning, and sent Latin verse to his father. Nothing more is known of Robert and John, or their unnamed sister; the brothers are not mentioned in a bond of provision made by John of West Comrie on 5 May 1643 which names only Alexander, James and Samuel.Cited by Sir Robert Douglas, Peerage of Scotland, 2 vols (Edinburgh, 1813), i, 355. (John and Robert have so far not turned up in any of the now much-scoured Scandinavian records of Scottish regiments, and would therefore appear to have died, possibly of disease, before they saw much or indeed any military service.) Elizabeth Melville‚Äôs letter of 1629 talks about the considerable financial difficulties in which the family finds itself. The lands of Kinnedar have had to be sold off outright, and those of Comrie sold under reversion, redeemable by her eldest son, Alexander, the purchaser in both cases being John Colville‚Äôs younger brother, Mr Robert, minister of Culross. Lady Culross indicates that Alexander Colville did not keep in frequent contact with her, and asks James to write to him about the redemption of the Comrie land. = Dr. Alexander Colville = St Mary's College, St Andrews, at which Melville's son, Alexander, taught. After studying at Edinburgh, in 1619 Alexander had moved to teach at the protestant academy in Sedan in France, the home (since 1611) of the banished Scottish presbyterian spokesman Andrew Melville. There Alexander took his D.D. degree in 1628 and married the daughter of a French pastor in 1631. In 1641, the General Assembly asked him to return to teach at St. Andrews, which he did at a date as yet unclear.Robert Baillie, Letters and Journal, 3 vols (Edinburgh: Bannatyne Club, 1841‚Äì42), i, 366. By 1649, he was professor of theology in St. Mary's College there, and would experience problems in the 1650s thanks to the antics of his disruptive youngest brother Samuel.See Charles Rogers, Social Life in Scotland, 3 vols (London, 1884‚Äì86 ), iii, 191; G.R. Kinloch, ed. Records of the Presbyterie of St Andrews and Cupar (Edinburgh: Abbotsford Club, 1837), pp. 66‚Äì67; John A. Fairlie, \\"The Old Tolbooth: with Extracts from the Original Records\\", The Book of the Old Edinburgh Club (Edinburgh: T. and A. Constable, 1908‚Äì), iv (1911), p. 133. During the Covenanting period, Dr. Alexander Colville seems to have been a generally respected moderate Covenanter,G. R. Kinloch, ed. Selections from the Minutes of the Synod of Fife (Edinburgh: Abbotsford Club, 1837), p. 214; Baillie, Letters and Journal, iii, 544. but at the Restoration, he conformed to episcopacy. He died in 1666. The descendants of his son John (d.1671), minister of Mid-Calder, would inherit the title of Lord Colville of Culross, on the extinction of the senior line in 1678. However, they did not use the title until Elizabeth Melville's great-great- grandson John successfully claimed it in 1723.Scots Peerage, ii, 560-61., ii, 560-61. The present Viscount Colville of Culross is his direct descendant. In A Genealogical and Heraldic Dictionary of the Landed Gentry for 1853, vol.3, p. 71, Sir Bernard Burke misidentified Elizabeth Melville's son Dr Alexander as an Ulster planter and clergyman also named Dr Alexander Colville. The latter, almost certainly a scion of the Colvilles of Cleish, acquired a very considerable fortune and built Galgorm Castle near Ballymena, gaining a reputation for necromancy in the process. Burke's mistake has unfortunately given rise to erroneous statements in various publications and online genealogies.See J Reid Baxter, \\"The 'real' Dr Alexander Colville of Galgorm\\", in Familia (2014); for details see Bibliography. = Samuel Colville = In a letter of 1631 to John Livingstone, Elizabeth had commented that ‚ÄòSamuell is going to the colledge in Sant Andrews, to a worthy maister thair, bot I feare him deadly‚Äô, which indicates that her youngest child's behaviour had long been unpredictable. Three of Samuel's doggerel pasquils (from 1643, 1669 and 1673) survive in manuscript, attacking Clerk Register Sir Alexander Gibson, Bishop Gilbert Burnet and the Earl of Dundonald respectively.The first two are in the National Library of Scotland, Adv.Ms. 19.3.8, f.45 and Wodrow Folio XXXI, item 81, and were printed by James Maidment, A Book of Scottish Pasquils (1868), p. 141, 394. The third is in the National Records of Scotland, GD 158 /913. In 1681 Samuel published the first-known of numerous editions of his Mock Poem, or The Whiggs Supplication, which is sometimes described as the Scottish Hudibras.See Ralph Stewart ‚ÄòThe Whiggs Supplication‚Äô, Scottish Literary Journal, 18(1), 1991, pp. 37‚Äì45. An astonishing number of manuscript copies of this poem are extant. In 1673 he had published a large tome, The Grand Impostor Discovered: or, An Historical Dispute of the Papacy and Popish Religion, supposedly the first of two. No further parts ever appeared. It is not known when he died. It is highly probable that Samuel Colville, rather than James or Alexander, was the son referred to by Melville‚Äôs correspondent Samuel Rutherford when he wrote to her on 9 July 1637: ‚ÄòAs for your son, who is your grief, your Lord waited on you and me, till we were ripe, and brought us in. It is your part to pray and wait upon him. When he is ripe, he will be spoken for. Who can command our Lord‚Äôs wind to blow? I know that it shall be your good in the latter end.‚ÄôAndrew A. Bonar, ed. Letters of Samuel Rutherford (Edinburgh, 1891), letter no. CCXXII. = Christian Colville = Pastor Samuel Rutherford (c.1600 ‚Äì 1661). The same letter of 9 July 1637 to Elizabeth Melville from the great presbyterian pastor Samuel Rutherford says ‚Äòyour son- in-law W.G. is truly honoured for his Lord and Master's cause ‚Ä¶ his wife is his encourager, which should make you rejoice‚Äô.Andrew A. Bonar, ed. Letters of Samuel Rutherford (Edinburgh, 1891), letter no. CCXXII. See also notice of Glendinning on p. 265. This refers to William Glendinning (or Glendoning) provost of Kirkcudbright, who in early spring 1637 had refused to imprison his father, Mr. Robert, the local minister. Mr. Robert had been suspended for nonconformity by Bishop Thomas Sydserf of Galloway, who subsequently ordered that Provost Glendinning and other local officials be imprisoned in Wigtown. William Glendinning was married to Christian Colville, named for her maternal grandmother Christian Boswell.See Dumfries Register of Sasines, 4, f.24 (1 April 1634) and 5, f.151 (3 March 1646). The couple seem to have only one child, Elizabeth, presumably named for her maternal grandmother; her first husband was one George Glendinning, her second was John Maxwell, brother of the third Earl of Nithsdale, who died in the first half of 1658.The Scots Peerage, vi, 487, and xi, 144. Rutherford's extant letters to William Glendinning all conclude with special greetings to Glendinning's wife.Bonar, Letters: Letters nos CXXXVII, CCLXVII, CCLXXVI. See also notice of Glendinning on p. 265. At present, nothing further is known about Christian Colville, but Glendinning enjoyed some prominence in Covenanting Scotland, attending the Glasgow General Assembly that abolished the episcopate, and being one of the four Scottish commissioners sent to London to try to prevent the execution of Charles I.See D Laing, ed. Correspondence of the Earl of Ancram and the Earl of Lothian, 2 vols (Bannatye Club, 1875), i, 199, 229‚Äì46. Melville's poetry = Printed poems = Ane godlie dreame, compylit in Scottish meter be M. M. gentelvvoman in Culros, at the requeist of her freindes, by Elizabeth Melville, Lady Culross. Title page. Published 1603 in Edinburgh by Robert Charteris. (Courtesy of National Library of Scotland.) In 1599, the poet- pastor Alexander Hume dedicated his Hymnes, or Sacred Songs to ‚ÄòLady Cumrie‚Äô, and in his prefatory address to her, he described her as ‚Äòa Ladie, a tender youth, sad, solitare and sanctified‚Äô, adding ‚ÄòI knaw ye delyte in poesie yourselfe; and as I unconfeinedly confes, excelles any of your sex in that art, that ever I hard within this nation. I have seene your compositiones so copious, so pregnant, so spirituall, that I doubt not bot it is the gift of God in you‚Äô. In his essay ‚ÄòTo the Scottish Youthe‚Äô in the same volume, Hume set out his austere view that religious verse was the only poetry that Christians should read or write. Melville's poetry in many ways exemplifies Hume's prescriptions, though another minister, David Black, provides a perfect summary of the essence of Melville's work. In An Exposition vpon the thirtie two Psalme, describing the true maner of humbling and raysing vp of Gods children (1600), Black says that the psalm is a record of King David's ‚Äòinwarde experience and obseruations of GOD his dealing with himselfe, which in the end of his labours and agonies, hee recompteth and committeth to writing‚Äô. Melville's writings are filled with echoes of the psalms, both of the Geneva Bible prose versions and those found in the Scottish metrical psalter of 1564 (by no means identical with the English Whole Booke of Psalmes of 1562). Much of her poetry was clearly born of her own personal spiritual struggles and her inward experience of God's dealings with her. In Ane Godlie Dreame, she made a narrative drama out of those struggles, and chose to share it with the world ‚Äòat the requeist of her freindes‚Äô. The poem is cast in 60 eight-line ‚Äòballat royal‚Äô stanzas (rhyming ababbcbc), and features dialogue between the narrator and Christ, effective descriptive passages, theological writing and homiletic exhortation; the last third of the poem reviews what has gone before, in an ‚Äòapplication‚Äô of its message, such as would have been found in a sermon of the time. The 1603 print is presented in Scots orthography. In the next, undated edition, probably from 1604, the text has been transcribed into a form of English orthography, with some small textual changes, and the publication is now stated to have been ‚Äòat the request of a friend‚Äô. All successive editions (thirteen are known of in all, down to 1737) followed this text. The success of the Dreame was such that Charteris issued a third edition in 1606. In these editions, and in Andro Hart's edition of 1620, the Dreame was followed by a ‚Äòcomfortable song‚Äô in five stanzas, beginning ‚ÄòAway vaine warld‚Äô, long mis-attributed to the great court-poet Alexander Montgomerie (d.1598). It is a ‚Äòsacred parody‚Äô of the extremely successful English love- song, ‚ÄòShall I let her goe‚Äô published by Robert Jones in 1600 and quoted by Shakespeare in Twelfth Night. In Raban's 1644 Aberdeen print of the Dreame, ‚ÄòAway vaine world‚Äô was joined by ‚ÄòCome sweet Lord, my sorrow ceas‚Äô, a Scots- language sacred parody of another English love-song. Militantly anti-Catholic, this is presumably a work of Elizabeth Melville's that had circulated in manuscript. In later editions of the Dreame, it replaces ‚ÄòAway vaine world‚Äô. A three-stanza text of ‚ÄòAway vaine warld‚Äô was, however, included in a later Aberdeen publication, John Forbes‚Äôs Songs and Fancies (1662, 1666 and 1682), as song no. 35. Like all the book‚Äôs song texts, it is unattributed. Forbes‚Äôs error-strewn text cannot have been copied from the text printed eighteen years earlier at Aberdeen in Raban‚Äôs Godly Dream.Further proof that Forbes was not drawing on Raban‚Äôs Godly Dream is the fact that while for song 14, ‚ÄòCome Love, let‚Äôs walk in yonder spring‚Äô, Forbes printed both secular and sacred lyrics, when it came to song 32, the English ‚ÄòCome sweet Love, let sorrow ceas‚Äô, there is no sign of the sacred text which Raban had printed to be sung to the same tune. The contrafactum, ‚ÄòCome sweet Lord; my sorrow ceass‚Äô is written in dense Scots, and is ascribed to Melville in Poems of Elizabeth Melville, pp. 94‚Äì97. = Manuscript poems = As far as is currently known, no other work by Melville appeared in print. The two comminatory ‚Äòrhyme royal‚Äô stanzas inscribed on the outer wall of the Melville mausoleum in Collessie kirkyard, built by Sir James of Halhill for his wife in 1609, are presumably the work of his poet daughter. Manuscript survivals of individual poems (three sonnets, a sacred parody of Marlowe's ‚ÄòCome live with me‚Äô and the large-scale ‚ÄòLoves Lament for Christ's Absence‚Äô) indicate that handwritten copies of some of her works were in circulation. The major survival, however, is what seems to be a consciously ordered sequence of sixteen poems and three short sonnet- sequences. Totalling c.3,000 lines, these are found at the end of a beautifully copied manuscript volume of twenty-nine sermons on Hebrews 11, preached in 1590‚Äì91 by Robert Bruce, minister of Edinburgh.Edinburgh University, New College Library, MS Bru 2, ff.170‚Äì184. The overlap in lexis, phraseology, style and content with Ane Godlie Dreame and ‚ÄòAway vaine warld‚Äô (and with the four manuscript poems bearing Melville's name) led to their being attributed to Melville by Jamie Reid-Baxter in 2002; for the same reasons, he also attributed the anonymous manuscript poem ‚ÄòLoves Lament for Christ's Absence‚Äô to her that same year. A distinctive stylistic marker is Melville‚Äôs use of a ‚Äòchiming‚Äô internal rhyme before the caesura in both lines of the closing couplet of her three scribally-assigned sonnets. The acrostic sonnet to the imprisoned minister John Welsh ends: > A sight most bright thy soul shall shortly see > When store of Glore thy rich reward shall be. The acrostic (and anagram) sonnet to the imprisoned Andrew Melville ends: > Now saulls do schyne quho luik unto thy licht > And wel wer myne to sie that blissed sicht. and the accompanying sonnet also addressed to him ends: > Rejoyce and sing thoch Sathan sift thee soir > Fecht for thy king and gaine ane crowne of glor. This striking device is also employed in some of the Bruce Manuscript sonnets.For all of these sonnets, see Poems of Elizabeth Melville, pp. 68, 10‚Äì11, 65‚Äì67. See also the dixain on p. 12 for the same internal rhyming device. The device is discussed by Jamie Reid-Baxter in ‚ÄòElizabeth Melville, Lady Culross: new light from Fife‚Äô (see Bibliography), pp. 42‚Äì43, 67‚Äì68, 76. It is also found in sonnets by four ministers of the presbytery of St Andrews.Namely in sonnets by John Dykes, William Scot, John Carmichael and James Melville printed as parts of the paratext to the last-named‚Äôs Spirituall Propine of a Pastour to his People (Edinburgh, 1598), as well as in manuscript sonnets by John Dykes and his brother-in-law James Melville. See J.Reid- Baxter, ‚ÄòThe Nyne Muses, an unknown Renaissance sonnet sequence: John Dykes and the Gowrie Conspiracy of 1600‚Äô, in K. Dekker and A. A. MacDonald (eds.) Royalty, Rhetoric and Reality (Leuven: Peeters, 2005), pp. 197‚Äì218, at 206‚Äì06. See also J. Reid-Baxter, ‚ÄòLiminary Verse: the paratextual poetry of Renaissance Scotland‚Äô, Journal of the Edinburgh Bibliographical Society, no. 3 (2008), pp. 70‚Äì94, at 85 and endnote 72. The last line of ‚ÄòA Sonnet sent to Blackness to Mr John Welsh, by the Lady Culross‚Äô, recorded in the idiosyncratic cursive hand of the presbyterian historian Rev. Robert Wodrow (1679‚Äì1734), has been repeatedly mistranscribed, despite the existence of the correct transcription printed by the Scottish manuscript scholar David Laing in 1826 and reprinted in 1895.David Laing, Early Metrical Tales (Edinburgh, 1826), p. xxxii ; reprinted in 1895, in Laing, Early Popular Poetry of Scotland (2 vols), ed. W.C.Hazlitt, ii, 281. Thousands of pages of Wodrow‚Äôs handwriting are extant. In this sonnet, Wodrow‚Äôs sprawling majuscule G at the start of the word ‚ÄòGlore‚Äô has been regularly misread as ‚ÄòC‚Äôs‚Äô, resulting in ‚ÄòC‚Äôs lore‚Äô. (Wodrow‚Äôs minuscule r has also been misread as a v, producing ‚ÄòC‚Äôs love‚Äô). In Poems of Elizabeth Melville, p. 68, the editor has removed Wodrow‚Äôs indentations and restored Scots ‚ÄòEfter‚Äô at the start of line 6, so as to enable the acrostic MJHONEWELSHE to be read, which Laing had missed. Melville uses an acrostic in one of her sonnets to Andrew Melville and in the dixain at the start of the collection of poems in the Bruce Manuscript. In the sonnet to Andrew Melville/Melvin printed on p. 10 of Poems, the editor has restored the poet‚Äôs original (English) orthography of the scribal weill war and Quhy, which spellings effectively hide the acrostic (MANDREWMELVIN) and anagram (And wel wer myne: Andrew Melvyne). The relevant MSS can be seen here: http://hri.newcastle.edu.au/emwrn/index.php?content=melvillebio. Melville's Letters Edinburgh University Library‚Äôs Laing Collection holds a bound volume of eleven holograph letters by Elizabeth Melville, and a transcript of a twelfth. One letter dates from August 1625, the other eleven were written between January 1629 and June 1632. They represent no more than a tiny fragment of what must have been a vast correspondence, but they constitute an invaluable source of biographical information about the poet. The most informative are the two that Melville addressed to her son James in 1625 and 1629, already discussed. These two are also the only letters to have been edited, but only one of the nine holograph letters (to the Countess of Wigton, Margaret Livingston) remains unpublished. Despite its addressee, it forms an integral part of the existing group of nine letters Melville wrote to the young minister John Livingstone between June 1629 and June 1632. Livingstone‚Äôs own autobiographical writings are, with the letters, the major source of information about Melville‚Äôs biography.Two letters written to her by Samuel Rutherford in 1637 contain oblique allusions to members of her family (her brother, her son Samuel and her daughter Christian). In 1845, Livingstone‚Äôs autobiography and the heterogeneous observations he entitled ‚ÄòMemorable Characteristics and Remarkable Passages of Divine Providence‚Äô were published by W.K.Tweedie. Tweedie also included the texts of the eight holograph letters addressed to Livingstone by Elizabeth Melville, explaining that these had been transcribed by their original collector, the antiquary Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe.W.K.Tweedie, ed. Select Biographies, 2 vols. (Wodrow Society : Edinburgh, 1845‚Äì47) i. References to and observations made by Elizabeth Melville are found in both A Brief Historical Relation of the Life of Mr John Livingstone (pp. 127‚Äì197) and Livingstone‚Äôs Memorable Characteristics, and Remarkable Passages of Divine Providence (pp. 293‚Äì348). The letters, numbered I to VIII, are printed on pp. 349‚Äì370. None of Livingstone‚Äôs letters to Melville are extant. Tweedie does not mention that in 1817, Sharpe had printed a ninth letter from Melville to Livingstone, prefacing it with the observation that, like Samuel Rutherford, John Livingstone ‚Äòcarried on an epistolary correspondence with all the distinguished female enthusiasts in Scotland, and I have seen many letters ‚Ä¶ expressing wonderful attachment to his person, as well as to the covenanted cause. As a specimen of the style in which these she-saints wrote, a letter of Lady Culross, much more brief than the generality of her religious rhapsodies, is subjoined, from the original MS.‚Äô.Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe, ed. The Secret and True History of the Church of Scotland by the Rev. Mr James Kirkton (Edinburgh, 1817), p. 51. The letter in question is found only as a 19th century transcript in the bound volume in Edinburgh University Library. As printed by Tweedie, Sharpe‚Äôs transcription of the eight other letters is apparently not entirely accurate.See J. Reid- Baxter,‚ÄòElizabeth Melville's Letters in Edinburgh University Library, Laing III.347‚Äô in Notes and Queries, (Oxford University Press), December 2006, pp. 525‚Äì528, at 525. Tweedie wrote that ‚ÄòIt is difficult to fix the dates of the different letters with precision‚Äô, but their contents show that the order in which he printed them is not chronological. A list providing an apparently more accurate ordering was published in 2015, whereby the first-written would be Tweedie‚Äôs no III, followed by nos. VIII, I, II and then nos. IV to VII. In this ordering, the letter printed by Sharpe in 1817 would come between III and VII, i.e. second in the complete chronological series, while the unprinted holograph letter to the Countess of Wigton would come between nos. II and IV.See J.Reid-Baxter, 'Elizabeth Melville, Lady Culross: Two Letters to her Son James', in E Ewan and J Nugent (eds.) Children and Youth in Medieval and Early Modern Scotland (Martlesham: Boydell and Brewer, 2015), pp. 205‚Äì19, at 218, fn.82. The extant letters are, like Melville‚Äôs poetry, are full of Biblical quotations and allusions, but contain no verse. The two to her son James are ‚Äòmore solicitous than imperious‚Äô, while those to Livingstone are ‚Äòoften imperious (as well as querulous and self-deprecatingly humorous)‚Äô; Melville writes like ‚Äòa ‚Äúmother in God‚Äù, lecturing Livingstone, counselling him, scolding him and even suggesting subject matter for sermons‚Äô.Ibid. p. 218-219. Having trained for the ministry in order to follow in his father‚Äôs footsteps, Livingstone found his path to a Scottish parish blocked by the episcopal hierarchy on account of his adherence to presbyterianism, and for several years he preached wherever he was welcome as a guest, including in Fife. In his writings, Livingstone speaks with gratitude of the protection and support he was afforded by a number of ladies of the landowning classes, but he ‚Äòhas more to say of Elizabeth Melville than of any of the much grander grandes dames to whom he was beholden‚Äô.Ibid. p. 219. Melville‚Äôs letters to him make references to persons and places that demonstrate the extent to which she was part of the nationwide Scottish network of presbyterians practising passive resistance to Crown policy with regard to worship and Kirk governance. Apart from her correspondence, other sources give clues to her network and contacts, in December 1609 Alexander Hume, minister of Logie, linked \\"elder Lady Elizabeth Melville, Lady Comrie\\" with Marie Stewart, Countess of Mar in his will, wishing them both \\"love, Christian affection, and blessing\\".HMC 14th Report part 3: Hugh Hume Campbell of Marchmont (London, 1894), p. 92. Robert Wodrow was told that she had visited Anne Livingstone at Eglinton Castle in 1622, meeting the minister David Dickson.Robert Wodrow, Analecta vol. 1 (Maitland Club, 1842), p. 19. Modern interest in Melville = Interest within the universities = 1600 Edinburgh imprint of the anonymous Gude and Godlie Ballatis, one of Melville's first-hand literary influences. Modern scholarship on Melville dates back to David Laing's 1826 reprint of the 1603 text of Ane Godlie Dreame in Scottish Metrical Tales, reissued by Carew Hazlitt in 1895 as Early Popular Poetry of Scotland. Laing's enthusiastic introduction to the Dreame included Melville's acrostic sonnet of 1606 or 1607 to the imprisoned minister John Welsh (the acrostic reads M Jhone Welshe), which had survived in non-contemporary copies in the Wodrow Manuscripts (now held by the National Library of Scotland). Laing omitted ‚ÄòAway vaine warld‚Äô, however, since he discovered a version of the text in the Margaret Kerr Manuscript of the poems of Alexander Montgomerie, whose date of death was completely unknown until the 1970s. Laing assumed that a poem of such quality must be the work of James VI's ‚Äòmaister makar‚Äô, and had been appropriated by Melville's printer as a make-weight. Paratextual studies are a very recent development, and Laing was not alone amongst 19th-century editors of older printed work in omitting liminary verse as irrelevant. It is nonetheless curious that Laing failed to notice how closely this short lyric relates to the major theme of the Dreame, namely the spiritual bliss afforded in this earthly life by a truly unconditional love for Christ and complete trust in Him as guide and in the strength of His hand to protect and save.The paratextual function of ‚ÄòAway vaine warld‚Äô is briefly discussed in Jamie Reid- Baxter ‚ÄòLiminary Verse : the Paratextual Poetry of Renaissance Scotland‚Äô, Journal of the Edinburgh Bibliographical Society No. 3 (2008), pp. 70‚Äì94, at 71‚Äì72. In his Scottish Text Society edition of the works of Melville's friend Alexander Hume (Edinburgh, 1902), Alexander Lawson included both the Dreame and ‚ÄòAway vaine warld‚Äô in an appendix. However, Melville really began to register with contemporary scholarship only with Germaine Greer's inclusion and discussion of her work in the epoch-making Kissing the Rod: An Anthology of 17th-Century Women's Verse (1988). In 1991, An Anthology of Scottish Women's Verse, edited by the Scottish-Canadian Catherine Kerrigan, likewise reproduced some stanzas from Ane Godlie Dreame and Melville's sonnet to John Welsh. Since then, Melville's name and poetry have been regularly mentioned and discussed in scholarly work on Early Modern Women. Academic interest in and writing about Melville continues to grow, though she is often treated as an ‚Äòearly modern Englishwoman‚Äô, and hence sometimes even referred to as ‚ÄòElizabeth Colville‚Äô. Sarah Dunnigan, Rebecca Laroche, Sarah Ross and Jamie Reid-Baxter have attempted to place Melville firmly in her Scottish context, whether historical, ecclesiastical or literary. Still unexplored is the extent of her familiarity with French literature, though there are clear parallels to be drawn with the poetry of Margu√©rite de Navarre. Her own father's French connections ran very deep. But Scotland's intimate links with France, by virtue of the 'Auld Alliance', meant that after the Reformation, great numbers of Scots continued to study and teach there, not least in the various French protestant academies. Her friend Alexander Hume spent several years studying in France, and her own son Alexander would make a large part of his career there. That Melville was aware of English literary developments, read the publications of Tudor puritan divines, and had an encyclopaedic familiarity with the Geneva Bible and its marginalia is not in dispute, but in literary terms, her work relates most immediately to the productions of her Scottish contemporaries Alexander Hume, James Melville and Alexander Montgomerie, and behind them, the presence of Sir David Lindsay's Dreme (c.1526; published 1574) and his huge Dialogue betuix Experience and ane Courteour, Off the miserabill estait of the world (Paris, 1558, Scottish reissue 1574), as well as the anonymous Gude and Godlie Ballatis (1565 and several later editions). Elizabeth Melville's language, her use of complex rhyme-schemes and alliteration, and of the Scottish interlacing sonnet form (ababbcbccdcdee) all belong to her native poetic tradition. Like Robert Henryson's Orpheus, David Lindsay's narrator travels to hell in both the Dreme and Ane Dialogue betuix Experience and ane Courteour. The Scottish dream-vision tradition was still lively in the 1590s, with James Melville, John Burel and Montgomerie all publishing substantial, if very different, dream-vision poems between 1590 and 1597. For the growing academic interest in Melville, see Bibliography below. = Interest outwith the universities = There is no monument of any kind to Lady Culross in the historic village of Culross, where she worshipped throughout her adult life in the Abbey kirk, under the ministry of her brother-in-law and her brother. Popular books expressive of nineteenth-century presbyterian piety, which venerated the spirit of the National Covenant of 1638, noted Melville's existence as a friend of John Welsh, John Livingstone and Samuel Rutherford, though there was no popular reprint of Ane Godlie Dreame to parallel the multiple editions of Rutherford's Letters.See fn. 2 and 27 above. Melville was occasionally mentioned in popular histories of Scottish vernacular literature,For example, David Irving, The History of Scottish Poetry (Edinburgh, 1861), pp. 481‚Äì483; Duncan Anderson, The Bible in Seventeenth-Century Scottish Life and Literature (London, 1936), pp. 251‚Äì252, 262. but her work does not seem to have been included in any of the many popular anthologies of Scottish poetry which were produced right through the 19th and 20th centuries, nor does she appear in the New Penguin Book of Scottish Verse (2002). However, following Jamie Reid-Baxter's recovery of the manuscript poetry, there were two public concert presentations of Melville's life and work: 3 April 2004 in Culross Abbey, and 26 June 2005 in Innerpeffray Collegiate Kirk. In 2010, Melville's songs were included in three concerts (in Culross, Dundee and Dunfermline) marking the 450th anniversary of the Scottish Reformation. Poems of Elizabeth Melville, Lady Culross was launched at the first of these, in Culross Abbey on 17 April 2010. The inscribed flagstone in Makars' Court in Edinburgh commemorating Melville is a public statement, and the quotation chosen highlights Melville's continuing relevance to modern life as a woman who resisted tyranny. Its unveiling by Germaine Greer on 21 June 2014 formed part of ‚ÄòElizabeth Melville Day‚Äô, a series of public events culminating in a choral concert featuring all five of Melville's lyrics for which music is extant. Reading Melville Melville's Geneva-Bible-based lexicon largely eschews specifically Scots items of vocabulary, and thus poses few problems for a non-Scotophone reader.The 'Select Glossary' in Poems of Elizabeth Melville (2010) occupies only two columns on p. 131. The sound of Melville's language, however, is that of her native late 16th-century Fifeshire Scots, and her artistry and technical skill are all the more apparent when her work is pronounced as Scots. This is no easy task in view of the vagaries and often very anglicised spelling of her scribes and printers; by 1603, when Ane Godlie Dreame was first printed, the traditional Scots system orthography had long started to break down under the impact of imports of English printed books.See Poems of Elizabeth Melville, Lady Culross (2010), ‚ÄòA Note on Written Scots‚Äô, p. 130; and Jeremy J. Smith, Older Scots : A Linguistic Reader (Scottish Text Society, 2012), pp. 1‚Äì50, with references therein, including to the online Dictionary of the Scots Language/Dictionar o the Scots Leid. Melville's lines also need to be correctly scanned: she did not write unmetrical doggerel. In her verse, the standard Middle Scots written termination \\"-is\\" (marking plural nouns or the 3rd person singular) is almost never to be given syllabic value; the same often applies to the past participle ending ‚Äò-it‚Äô,For example, in the first stanza of Ane Godlie Dreame (1603 text), the word ‚Äòthingis‚Äô is a monosyllable in line 2, (‚ÄòWith sindrie thingis quhair with my saull was greifit‚Äô). In that line, ‚Äògreifit‚Äô can be monosyllabic or disyllabic to taste, but in line 2 (‚ÄòMy greif increasit and grew moir and moir‚Äô) scansion requires that ‚Äòincreasit‚Äô have three syllables, whereas in line 6 (‚ÄòI loathit my lyfe, I culd not eit nor drink‚Äô) ‚Äòloathit‚Äô has to pronounced as a monosyllable. In line 8 (‚ÄòBut musit alone and divers thingis did think‚Äô) neither the ‚Äò-it‚Äô nor the ‚Äò-is‚Äô ending has any syllabic value. The same applies, for example, to ‚Äòdrownit‚Äô at the end of line 58 (‚ÄòIn filthie vyce our sensles saules ar drownit‚Äô), since it rhymes with ‚Äòabound‚Äô in line 60 (‚ÄòTo mend our lives, bot sin dois still abound‚Äô). In the texts as reproduced in Poems of Elizabeth Melville, Lady Culross (2010), the editor has reduced all non-syllabic ‚Äò-is‚Äô endings to simple ‚Äò-s‚Äô, but retained the ‚Äò-it‚Äô past participle ending; see pp. 116‚Äì117, 127 and 130 for his explanations. while ‚Äì as so often in Middle Scots ‚Äì intervocalic \\"v\\" is very frequently elided (cf. ‚ÄòHallowe'en‚Äô and ‚Äòo‚Äôer‚Äô).A striking example of this phenomenon is the way that this elision reduces ‚Äòcovenand‚Äô to ‚Äòconand/ cunnand‚Äô. See ‚Äòconand‚Äô in the Dictionary of the Older Scottish Tongue. Like all the vernacular poetry of late 16th- and early 17th-century Scotland, Melville's work uses much alliteration, and so \\"k\\" in words beginning \\"kn\\", and \\"w\\" (pronounced as \\"v\\") in words beginning \\"wr\\" should be voiced, e.g. ‚Äòvretchit‚Äô for written ‚Äòwretchit‚Äô.Ane Godle Dreame (1603 text), line 9: ‚ÄòThe wretchit warld did sa molest my mynde‚Äô. The guttural consonant \\"ch\\" should always be given its proper value, even if spelled \\"gh‚Äù and the sound represented by ‚Äòow‚Äô in words like ‚Äòdowne‚Äô and ‚Äòcrowne‚Äô, or by ‚Äòou‚Äô in words like ‚Äòout‚Äô and ‚Äòabout‚Äô, is ‚Äòoo‚Äô, as in modern spoken Scots.)See the Dictionary of the Older Scottish Tongue and the Scottish National Dictionary. See also The Concise Scots Dictionary (1985). As her rhyme-schemes show, in Melville's Fife-Angus dialect, words like \\"peace\\", \\"cease\\", or \\"heid\\" and \\"deid\\" were pronounced as \\"pace, sayss, hayd, dayd\\" (cf. modern Ulster pronunciation).See, for example, the rhymeword ‚Äòpeace‚Äô in Ane Godlie Dreame (1606 text), lines 129‚Äì136: I am the way, I am the trueth and life, I am thy spouse that brings thee store of grace: I am thy Lord that soone shall end thy strife, I am thy love whom thou wouldst faine imbrace. I am thy joy, I am thy rest and peace, Rise up anone and follow after me: I shall thee leade unto thy dwelling place, The Land of rest thou longest so sore to see. Like other Scots poets, Melville makes occasional use of ‚Äòsouthern‚Äô pronunciation of certain sounds for the purposes of rhyme; for example, when written \\"moir/more\\" is rhymed with \\"gloir\\" or \\"befoir\\" it is not pronounced as \\"mair\\".For example, in Ane Godlie Dreame (1603 text), compare lines 106 -108 : ‚ÄòMy greif is greit, I can it not declair,/ Into this earth I wander to and fro,/ Ane pilgrime pure consumit with siching sair‚Äô with lines 194‚Äì197: ‚ÄòOver wateris greit that hiddeouslie did roir:/ Thair lay belaw, that feirfull was to sie/ Maist uglie beists that gaipit to devoir./ My heid grew licht and troublit wondrous soir‚Äô. The richer the Scots in which Melville's lines are read, and the more accurately they are scanned, the greater their musicality. In her song lyrics, the lines are well shaped to the melodies she chose, and when sung, these poems are deeply affecting.See Jamie Reid-Baxter \\"The Songs of Elizabeth Melville\\", passim (see Bibliography below). The impact of her songs was commented on by performers and audiences alike at the concerts in 2004, 2005, 2010, and the Edinburgh performances on 20 May, 1 and 21 June 2014. The impact of Melville's work in general is greatly heightened by being heard: Ane Godlie Dreame proved to be an effective performance piece at the Elizabeth Melville Day Symposium on 21 June 2014.Performed by Eleanor Hubbard and Jamie Reid-Baxter, Augustine United Church, George IV Bridge, Edinburgh. Also suitable for performance by two voices is the lengthy penultimate poem in the Bruce Manuscript, a dialogue between the soul of someone in great spiritual distress ‚Äì perhaps even dying? ‚Äì and a soberly consoling spiritual counsellor.See folios 182r-83v. The following stanzas (nos. 16‚Äì20) from f.182v exemplify the dialogue (the ‚Äòsecond voice‚Äô is here italicised): Och is my hairt of stone or steill? It cannot brust in two. I can not knaw quhat fear I feill my saull is blinded so. I am so tossed to and fro [125] my hairt is lyke a hell, I feill ane falss confused wo: the caus I can not tell. Sall I not find releif at lenth? How bitter is my stryfe! [130] How sall I stryve without my strenth, or live without my lyfe? I sie my secreat sinis ar ryfe, yit can I not contend. O wisched death quhair is thy knyfe [135] that sould this battell end? O slouthfull saull, O blinded beast, quhy wereis thou so fast? O fuill thou wold be gone in haist now quhen thy grace is past! [140] Wilt thou not byde ane bitter blast for thy redeimeris saik? Thy cair on him he bidis thee cast: quhy is thy faith so waik? O sall I live or sall I die, [145] and live no more in paine? Or sall I ficht or sall I flie, and lat my saull be slaine? O sall I not from sin refraine so long as I have braith? [150] O sall I spend more tyme in vaine and heap up double wraith? Quhy wold thou die befoir thou live to magnifie his name? since doubell lyfe he did thee give [155] Then irk not so for schame! Och could I once set furth his fame and spred his praise abrod, I willinglie wold stay from home [sic] to glorifie my god. [160] Melville's legacy John Livingstone‚Äôs notes on the \\"Memorable Characteristics\\" of his contemporaries contain several references to Elizabeth Melville, which testify to the extent of her influence on her correligionists. These individuals included the versifying presbyterian minister of Irvine on the Ayrshire coast, David Dickson, whom she singled out to lead the prayers of a despondent company of dissident ministers and other presbyterians on 4 August 1621 after the Scottish Parliament had ratified the episcopalian Five Articles of Perth.See W.K.Tweedie, Select Biographies, i, 315-16. Dickson‚Äôs much-reprinted long poem, True Christian Love, to be sung with the common tunes of the psalms, first published in 1634, is reminiscent of Melville‚Äôs work. Dickson also wrote an acrostic poem (on his own name, in three ababacc stanzas), reminiscent of Melville‚Äôs acrostic spiritual sonnets.See W.K.Tweedie, Select Biographies, i, 316-17; see Poems of Elizabeth Melville (2010), pp. 10, 12 and 68. She is known to have been in correspondence with Dickson.See W.K.Tweedie, Select Biographies, i, 354, 367; his name also appears in Melville‚Äôs letters to Livingstone in ibid., pp. 353 and 369. It has been suggested that Melville‚Äôs poetry also influenced another apparently presbyterian poet from Ayrshire, Francis Hamilton of Silvertonhill.Jamie Reid- Baxter, 'The Apocalyptic Muse of Francis Hamilton of Silvertonhill (c.1585‚Äì1645)', in Journal of the Northern Renaissance vol. IV (2012), numbered paragraph 32. It is probable that Ane Godlie Dreame was known to the militantly presbyterian Sir William Mure of Rowallan, also from Ayrshire. In particular, his sonnet-sequence The Joy of Teares (published in 1635) contains many lines and images strongly reminiscent of Melville‚Äôs poetry deploring the persecution of the faithful.For example, compare Christ‚Äôs words to the faithful in Mure‚Äôs 22nd sonnet: Your peace is made, let Dragons fret and fume: My light your joy, shall make their eyes stone-blind, Though now they think my Cedars to consume. To your comfort my promises resume, In your distresse I will not you forsake: Through my strong arme you boldly may presume, To make the stoutest brambles all to quake. I am your rock, gainst mee who can prevaile? Earth shall decay, your strength shall never faile. with Ane Godlie Dreame (1603 print) Bot call on Christ to help zow in zour neid, Quha will nocht faill his promeis to fulfill (lines 367‚Äì368) Thocht Tirannes freat, thocht Lyouns rage & roir (line 386) Rejoyce in God, let nocht zour curage faill, Ye chosin Sancts that ar afflictit heir: Thocht Sathan rage, hee neuer sall preuaill, Fecht to the end and stoutlie perseueir. Your God is trew, zour blude is to him deir (lines 425‚Äì429) The Lord of Hostis that is zour strenth and sheild The Serpents heid hes stoutlie trampit downe: Trust in his strenth, pas fordwart in the feild, The King of kings gif he be on our syde, Wee neid nocht feir quhat dar agains us stand: Into the feild may wee not baldlie byde, Quhen hee shall help us with his michtie hand Quha sits above and reules baith sea and land, Quha with his breath doth mak the hilles to shaik (lines 438‚Äì446) But Melville‚Äôs legacy is much more extensive, insofar as the very long shelf- life of Ane Godlie Dreame must have influenced the spirituality of several generations of pious Scottish presbyterians.See the list of known prints in the Bibliography (below). In 1658, Sir Robert Moray (1608/1609‚Äì1673), wrote to the exiled and ill Sir Alexander Bruce, future 2nd earl of Kincardine, that he assumed Bruce would, on his sickbed, have been reading \\"your good friend the Lady of Culross and her dream\\" (D Stevenson, ed. Letters of Sir Robert Moray to the Earl of Kincardine, 1657‚Äì73 (Ashgate: Aldershot, 2007), p. 162). With the unveiling of the commemorative flagstone in Makars' Court, and the considerable publicity which surrounded that event, she has become a flagship for the revaluation of the writings of Scottish women of earlier centuries: the other six women commemorated there all published after 1900. thumb750pxcenterFlagstone commemorating Elizabeth Melville, Lady Culross (c1578-c1640), in Makars' Court, Lawnmarket, Edinburgh, Scotland.

The city served for a short time as the capital of the Republic of the Rio Grande in 1840. The city name of City of New Guerrero follows the Old Guerrero City (Antigua Guerrero) that was located on a tributary of the Rio Grande, the Rio Salado, some ten kilometers from the original banks of the Rio Grande. Old Guerrero was flooded after the construction of Falcon Dam, and moved south to its current location on the current shoreline of Falcon Lake. The original Church is partially above water and may still be viewable on the Salado Arm of the lake or approached on land when the water level in the lake is low.

In 2009, it was inscribed on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity of UNESCO. Overview In Tuvan throat singing, the performer produces a fundamental pitch and‚Äîsimultaneously‚Äîone or more pitches over that.Aksenov, A. N. Tuvan Folk Music. Asian Music, Vol. 4, No. 2 (1973), pp. 7-18. The history of Tuvan throat singing reaches far back. Many male herders can throat sing, but women are beginning to practice the technique as well. The popularity of throat singing among Tuvans seems to have arisen as a result of geographic location and culture. The open landscape of Tuva allows for the sounds to carry a great distance. Ethnomusicologists studying throat singing in these areas mark khoomei as an integral part in the ancient pastoral animism still practiced today. Often, singers travel far into the countryside looking for the right river, or go up to the steppes of the mountainside to create the proper environment for throat-singing.Slobin, Mark. Ethnomusicology. Volume 36, No. 3, Special Issue: Music and the Public Interest. (1992), pp 444-446. The animistic world view of this region identifies the spirituality of objects in nature, not just in their shape or location, but in their sound as well. Thus, human mimicry of nature's sounds is seen as the root of throat singing. An example of this is the Tuvan story of the waterfall above the Buyant G√∂l (Deer River in Tuvan), where mysterious harmonic sounds are said to have attracted deer to bask in the waters, and where it is said harmonic sounds were first revealed to people. Indeed, the cultures in this part of Asia have developed many instruments and techniques to mimic the sounds of animals, wind, and water. While the cultures of this region share throat singing, their styles vary in breadth of development. Ordinarily, melodies are created by isolating the 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th and 12th partial in accordance with the harmonic series. Thus, if the fundamental frequency were C3, the overtones would be G5, B‚ô≠5, C6, D6, E6, G6. However, it is possible to reach as low as the 2nd and as high as the 24th. The fundamental pitch is typically around E and G below middle C, and this affects the range of partials the singer can reach, with higher partials more easily reached on lower notes, and vice versa. cents difference from equal temperament (rounded to the nearest cent). Blue notes are flat and red notes are sharp. The people of Tuva have a wide range of throat singing vocalizations, and were the pioneers of six pitch harmonics. There are several different classification schemes for Tuvan throat singing. In one, the three basic styles are khoomei, kargyraa and sygyt, while the sub- styles include borbangnadyr, chylandyk, dumchuktaar, ezengileer and kanzyp. In another, there are five basic styles: khoomei, sygyt, kargyraa, borbangnadyr and ezengileer. The substyles include chylandyk, despeng borbang, opei khoomei, buga khoomei, kanzyp, khovu kargyraazy, kozhagar kargyraazy, dag kargyraazy, Oidupaa kargyraazy, uyangylaar, damyraktaar, kishteer, serlennedyr and byrlannadyr. These schemes all use Tuvan terminology.  Khorekteer  Khorekteer refers to the \\"chest voice\\". This is the voice that throat singers use when using khoomei, kargyraa, or any other harmonic-inducing style. The term can also be used to refer to all styles of Tuvan throat singing, much like khoomei. It can also refer to the feeling of chest resonance or pressure that one experiences when throat singing. Khorekteer is often used as a launching pad into the khoomei, sygyt, or kargyraa styles of throat singing.  Khoomei  The most popular style of Tuvan throat singing is known as Khoomei (or Kh√∂√∂mei, in Cyrillic: –•”©”©–º–µ–π). Khoomei is traditionally a softer sounding style, with the fundamental (or drone) usually in the low-mid to midrange of the singer's normal voice. In this style, usually 2 or 3 harmonics can be heard between one and two octaves above the fundamental. In Khoomei, the abdomen is fairly relaxed, and there is less tension on the larynx than in other styles. Pitch is manipulated through a combination of movements of the lips, throat, tongue or jaw. Singing in this style gives the impression of wind swirling among rocks. The term Khoomei is also used as a generic term to designate all throat singing techniques in this region.  Sygyt  Sygyt (in Cyrillic: –°—ã–≥—ã—Ç), literally 'whistling', has a midrange fundamental and is characterized by strong, flute-like or rather piercing harmonics, reminiscent of whistling. Also described as an imitation of the gentle breezes of summer, the songs of birds, the ideal sound for the harmonics is called –ß–∏—Å—Ç—ã–π –∑–≤—É–∫‚ÄîRussian for clear sound. To perform Sygyt, the tongue rises and seals around the gums, just behind the teeth. A small hole is left back behind the molars, either on the left or right side. The sound is then directed between the teeth to the front of the mouth. The lips form a bell-like shape, usually with an ‚Äúee\\" vowel, and the sound is directed through this small opening. Pitch is manipulated exactly the same way as in khoomei style.  Kargyraa  The more deep sounding style of throat singing is known as Kargyraa (in Cyrillic: –ö–∞—Ä–≥—ã—Ä–∞–∞). Kargyraa has a deep, almost growling sound to it and is technically related to Sardinian bass singing in Canto a Tenore choirs, and also to Tibetan Buddhist chant and has some similarities with the way Popeye's cartoon voice was created. It uses both the vocal and the vestibular folds (also known as \\"false vocal cords\\") simultaneously, creating two connected sources of sound. By constricting the larynx, the vestibular folds can be brought together (adducted) and, under certain conditions, vibrate. It can produce an undertone exactly half the frequency of the fundamental produced by the vocal folds. Therefore, for each second vibration of the vocal folds, the vestibular fold completes a whole vibration cycle. While the larynx generates such rich sound, the mouth cavity may be shaped, just like in the manipulation of vowels, to select some particular harmonics, resulting in a sound that may be perceived as having different pitches simultaneously. This vocal mechanism has been recently elucidated and shown to be identical to \\"sardinian bassu\\", which is one of the four voices of Sardinian \\"canto a tenore\\" choirs. It is also similar to the chant practiced in Tibet by the Gyuto monastery and other Buddhist orders.Fuks et al., 1998Lindestad et al., 2001 There are two types of Kargyraa: Dag (mountain) and Xovu (steppe). The Dag style is deeper, while Xovu is raspier and sung at a higher pitch with more throat tension and less chest resonance.Alden-ool Sevek (1995). \\"Dag (Muntain)Kargyraa\\". (MOV video). khoomei.com.Kaigal-ool. \\"Orphan's Lament\\". (MOV video). khoomei.com. \\"Kaigal- ool sings his heart out in several khoomei styles.\\" There are also the distinctive kargyraa styles of Vladimir Oidupaa and Albert Kuvezin, the latter also bearing the name kanzat. This is sometimes described as the howling winds of winter or the plaintive cries of a mother camel after losing her calf.  Effects and other styles  Of the following list, two effects that commonly employed in the khomeii, sygyt and kargyraa styles: Borbangnadyr and Ezengileer. * Borbangnadyr (–ë–æ—Ä–±–∞“£–Ω–∞–¥—ã—Ä) is a trill reminiscent of birds and traveling brooks, made by rapid movements of the tongue. Another effect that is usually added to this style is the light quivering of the lips,called \\"byrlang\\". * Ezenggileer (–≠–∑–µ“£–≥–∏–ª—ç—ç—Ä) is a pulsating style, attempting to mimic the rhythms of horseback riding. It is named after the Tuvan word for stirrup, ezengi. * Chylandyk (–ß—ã–ª–∞–Ω–¥—ã–∫) is simultaneous Sygyt and Kargyraa. This creates an unusual sound of low undertones mixed with the high Sygyt whistle. It has also been described as the \\"chirping of crickets.\\" A careful listener can further break down this style into Dag Chylandyk and Xovu Chylandyk. * Dumchuktaar (–î—É–º—á—É–∫—Ç–∞–∞—Ä) could be best described as \\"throat humming\\". The singer creates a sound similar to sygyt using only the nasal passage. The word means to sing through the nose (dumchuk). The mouth does not need to be closed, but of course, it demonstrates the point better.  Women in Tuvan throat singing There were a few female throat singers in Tuva's history, though it was believed a woman performing throat singing could hurt her male relatives and cause her difficulties during childbirth. Choldak-Kara Oyun, the mother of the famous throat singer Soruktu Kyrgys and grandmother of the husband of famous Tuvan actress Kara-Kys Namzatovna Munzuk, throat sang throughout her life while milking her cows, singing lullabies to her children and sometimes while she was drinking Tuvan araga (fermented milk alcohol). Close relatives of famous singers, like Khunashtaar-ool's niece (in the 1960s) and Kombu's daughter (in the 1940s or 1950s), performed khoomei (throat singing) in public more than once. The wife of the throat singing shaman Bilek-ool from Manchurek, Aldinsova Tortoyavna, said that she has always sung khoomei \\"because it was innate to [her] from birth.\\" She could not resist singing khoomei after she got married and had children, and sang khoomei in public in the 1950s and 1960s. But her sister, who also sang khoomei as a girl, gave up when others repeatedly reminded her of the supposed dangers. In the Soviet era it was rare for women to perform on stage, except during Republican festivals. Valentina Salchak performed throat singing in public in 1979. Valentina Chuldum from Mongun-Taiga (1960- Autumn 2002) toured European countries as a throat singer in the early 1990s. With the start of the International Symposium of Khoomei women could sing publicly there. Tyva Kyzy (–¢—ã–≤–∞ –ö—ã–∑—ã, pronounced ) (Daughters of Tuva, in Tuvan Turkish), founded in 1998, is an all-female folk ensemble performing Tuvan throat singing, under the direction of Choduraa Tumat. It is the first and only women's group in Tuva that performs all styles of Tuvan throat singing.  In popular culture  In 2016, a band called The Hu was formed. Hailing from Mongolia, the band blends rock and heavy metal with traditional Mongolian instrumentation, including Mongolian throat singing and the Morin khuur (also known as the horsehead fiddle). The Hu calls their style of music \\"hunnu rock\\", hu being a Mongolian root word for \\"human\\". Batzorig Vaanchig, a member of the band Khusugtun, is a internationally famous tuvan singer with almost 7 million views on youtube as of September 2020. In 2018, the band made its debut at Download Festival in Donington. A song by The Hu, \\"Black Thunder\\" was created for the 2019 videogame Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. A different version of the song was then translated and recorded by The Hu from the original Mongolian to a new fictional Star Wars language created by the band, with guidance from the game's developers. This version, \\"Sugaan Essena\\", was used for the game.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGcem7JFvEghttps://www.revolvermag.com/music/how- mongolian-band-hu-made-song-star-wars-alien-language  Examples  * Kargyraa * Khoomei * Sygyt * Ezengileer * Borbangnadyr  See also  * Music in the Tuva Republic * The Hu * Khusugtun * Tyva Kyzy, a women's throat singing group in Tuva * List of overtone musicians - chapter \\"Tuva\\" * Tuvan artists on Tyvawiki * Genghis Blues, a documentary about an American musician's trip to Tuva to compete in a throat singing contest. * Inuit throat singing  References  ;Bibliography and further reading * Emory, Michael.

It is about miscegenation in Creole Louisiana during the antebellum period. Plot summary D√©sir√©e is the adopted daughter of Monsieur and Madame Valmond√©, who are wealthy French Creoles in antebellum Louisiana. Abandoned as a baby, she was found by Monsieur Valmond√© lying in the shadow of a stone pillar near the Valmond√© gateway. She is courted by the son of another wealthy, well-known and respected French Creole family, Armand. They marry and have a child. People who see the baby have the sense it is different. Eventually they realize that the baby's skin is the same color as a quadroon (one-quarter African)--the baby has African ancestry. Because of D√©sir√©e's unknown parents, Armand immediately assumes that she is part black. D√©sir√©e denies the accusation. D√©sir√©e sends Madame Valmond√© a letter in need of help which Madame Valmond√© responds telling her that she can come back to her estate. Armand, scornful of D√©sir√©e, rejects her and insists that she leave. She takes their child and walks off into a bayou, never to be seen again. Armand burns all of D√©sir√©e's belongings, even the child's cradle, as well as all of the letters that she had sent him during their courtship. With this bundle of letters is also one written from his mother to his father, revealing that Armand is the one who is part black, by his mother's ancestry. D√©sir√©e's ancestry is never defined. Publication history \\"D√©sir√©e's Baby\\" as it appeared in Bayou Folk, 1894 \\"D√©sir√©e's Baby\\" was first published on January 14, 1893, in Vogue.Toth, Emily. Unveiling Kate Chopin.

Kate Chopin: A Critical Biography. Louisiana State University Press, 1980 (reprint): 54. \\"D√©sir√©e's Baby\\" was included in Chopin's collection Bayou Folk in 1894. Themes and literary classification  Though Kate Chopin is usually considered to be a writer of American realism and naturalism, the story is difficult to classify, in part because it is extremely short. The story leaves the moral conclusion up to the reader, suggesting it is naturalistic, but the fairytale-like elements of the love story are inconsistent with either naturalism or realism. The atmosphere of the story and the characterization of Armand create gothic undertones. Though brief, the story raises important issues that plagued Chopin's South, particularly the pervasive and destructive, yet ambiguous nature of racism, especially given the numerous people of color in the society. The story also questions the potential fulfillment of woman's identity‚Äîa subject that fascinated the unconventional Chopin. In her portrayal of D√©sir√©e, a woman whose self-worth and self-exploration is intrinsically linked to that of her husband, Chopin opened the door to her lifelong query into a woman's struggle for a place where she could fully belong. This story focuses on themes of hypocrisy and gender equality. The story also seems to be a transposition of De Maupassant's \\"The Story of a Farm Girl\\".

The first is the thesis of unilinear progress. This is the belief that technological progress follows a direct and predictable path from lower to higher levels of complexity and that each stage along this path is necessary for progress to occur (Feenberg 211). The second is the thesis of determination by the base. This is the concept that in a society where a technology had been introduced, that society must organize itself or adapt to the technology (Feenberg 211). In his argument against the former thesis Feenberg says that constructivist studies of technology will lead us to realize that there is not a set path by which development of technologies occur but rather an emerging of similar technologies at the same time leading to a multiplicity of choices. These choices are made based upon certain social factors and upon examining them we will see that they are not deterministic in nature (Feenberg 212). Arguing against the latter thesis, Feenberg calls to our attention social reforms that have been mandated by governments mainly in regards to the protection of its citizens and laborers. Most of the time these mandates are widely accepted after being passed through the governing body. At which point technology and industry will reform and re- evolve to meet the new standards in a way that has greater efficiency than it did so previously (Feenberg 214) Bibliography *Feenberg, Andrew. \\"Democratic Rationalization\\". _Readings in the Philosophy of Technology_.

Spanish, Agua de Valencia) is a cocktail made from a base of cava or champagne, orange juice, vodka and gin. In general, it is served in pitchers of various sizes and is consumed from a broad cocktail glass. It was made for the first time in 1959 by Constante Gil in the bar Caf√© Madrid de Valencia in the city of Valencia, Spain. According to the writer Mar√≠a √Ångeles Arazo in her book Valencia Noche, the bar was frequented at that time by a group of Basque travellers that used to order \\"Agua de Bilbao\\" (Spanish, \\"Water of Bilbao\\"), referring to the bar's best cava. Tired of always ordering the same thing, they challenged the owner to offer them something new and he suggested that they try the \\"Agua de Valencia\\". They agreed to try what Gil made, and liking it, they continued to drink it in later visits. For a decade the drink was known only to a small group of clients and it was not until the 1970s that it started to become known in the wider Valencian nightlife. Since then, it has grown to be a very popular drink. Constante Gil left the bar in 2000, and dedicated himself to painting \\"Tertulias de Caf√©\\" (Spanish, \\"social gatherings of the caf√©\\"), an homage to his experiences there. Gil died of a heart attack on 7 June 2009 in Valencia, Spain.

History  The entire history combines places like Payradanga, Anulia, Baidyapur, ans Haradham. Roads connect all these places. In 1606 A.C. Bhabananda Roy Majumder was the King of Nadia according to the Mughal Empire Jahangir's 14 Parganas. Later on Raja Rudra (1683‚Äì94) established the city Krishnagar. However, the development in Nadia was led by Raja Krishnachandra (1728‚Äì82). He built religious places and small localities around different places in Nadia. He also built a locality at Haradham (currently in Payradanga) and Anandadham. There were many areas scattered in and around Payradanga, while during the 1950s some social workers, like Khitish Chandra Guha, Rohonikanta Das, and Bhabes Chandra Chakroborty developed a locality in Pritinagar. They built a co-operative to support the project. After that they established the Pritinagar High School and started the Durga Puja festival and other activities. The first structured ruling system employed in Payradanga was the Chowkidary Panchayat system that started in 1870 during the British period. In 1885 this two-level ruling structure was formed by the British Government. Post-independence, the ruling scheme was similar. In 1957 the first Panchayet structure was employed in West Bengal, but in 1973 this law was passed and a 3-stage panchayet was employed, i.e. Zilla Parishad, Block Panchayet Samiti. The 1st Gram Panchayat election was held in June 1978. Ukilnara is one of the most popular area in Payradanga. Geography =Location= Payradanga is located at . Payradanga is not identified as a separate inhabited place in 2011 census.

Payradanga railway station is shown as being located in Parbbatipur. =Area overview= Nadia district is mostly alluvial plains lying to the east of Hooghly River, locally known as Bhagirathi. The alluvial plains are cut across by such distributaries as Jalangi, Churni and Ichhamati. With these rivers getting silted up, floods are a recurring feature.Gangopadhyay, Basudev, Paschimbanga Parichay, 2001, , p. 70, Sishu Sahitya SansadThe Ranaghat subdivision has the Bhagirathi on the west, with Purba Bardhaman and Hooghly districts lying across the river. Topographically, Ranaghat subdivision is spread across the Krishnanagar- Santipur Plain, which occupies the central part of the district, and the Ranaghat-Chakdaha Plain, the low-lying area found in the south-eastern part of the district. The Churni separates the two plains. A portion of the east forms the boundary with Bangladesh. The lower portion of the east is covered by a portion of the North 24 Parganas district.The subdivision has achieved reasonably high urbanisation. 41.68% of the population lives in urban areas and 58.32% lives in rural areas.

The two members of Hexes and Ohs consist of Edmund Lam and Heidi Donnelly, who were high-school sweethearts who experimented and created their own musical sound. History Donnelly and Lam's first musical endeavour was a pop quartet called Jolly Bean. While with this band they recorded two albums and through the 90‚Äôs transformed from an East Coast pop style to a more electric sound. Jolly Bean experimented with different styles of music included pop, grunge, and electronic. Jolly Bean was changed into a trio called \\"A Vertical Mosaic\\" in 1999. The band was soon signed by a Canadian record company called Noise Factory Records and continued to record songs. A Vertical Mosaic built up a fan base in the band‚Äôs city or origin, Montreal. A Vertical Mosaic disbanded in 2004 due to disagreements between the members. Donnelly and Lam then created the duo Hexes & Ohs shortly after A Vertical Mosaic was disbanded. In 2005 they released their debut album Goodbye Friend, Welcome Lover which consisted of songs recorded from their apartment.

The film stars David Carradine and Playboy Playmate Claudia Jennings. It would be one of Jennings' last movies before her death. Plot \\"A thousand years from tomorrow\\", after the Neutron Wars, the world is divided into a barbaric collection of city states, surrounded by wastelands where only mutant cannibals and independent warriors, known as Range Guides, can live. Led by Lord Zirpola, the city state of Helix is planning war on another state, Tritan, for their fuel supply. Hoping to prove the superiority of their newest weapons, the Death Machines (laser- equipped dirt bikes), they create a new pastime - Deathsport. The death penalty has been replaced by Deathsport, where criminals battle each other to the death in return for gaining their freedom. Lord Zirpola has managed to capture legendary Range Guide Kaz Oshay (Carradine) and he wants to add a female range guide for an upcoming Deathsport event. A female guide, Deneer (Jennings), is captured while leading a group of Tritans across the desert. A child, Tara, is taken by the mutant group during the attack to capture Deneer. In a Helix jail Kaz Oshay bonds with Deneer and vows to escape with her and find the group's child. After enduring torture and facing his mother's killer, Ankar Moor, Oshay and Deneer are forced onto the Deathsport motocross field, which is mined with explosives. They easily defeat the other riders and escape from Helix with two other prisoners, Dr. Karl and his son Marcus. During the escape, though, the doctor is killed. Eventually, they rescue the child Tara from the mutant cannibals, and battle the other Death Machine riders who followed them. Finally safe, Deneer delivers Marcus to Tritan, while Oshay faces Ankar Moor in \\"honorable\\" combat, using Whistlers (swords that make a sound like music). After a bloody battle, Oshay decapitates Ankar Moor, thus becoming the greatest Range Guide alive. The film ends with Oshay, Deneer and the child Tara riding their horses off into the sunset.

Haggerty - jailer *Peter Hooper - Mr. Bakkar *Brenda Venus - Adriann Production =Development= The film was intended as a follow-up to Death Race 2000 (1975), only with motorcycles instead of cars. Corman had a commitment with David Carradine to have him as a star under a five-picture contract that he had signed with the actor, and had gotten Charles B. Griffith to write a script. However, Corman was unhappy with the script. Allan Arkush who worked at New World at the time recalls Corman \\"offered it [the film] to everybody and nobody wanted to do it, because it was really half-baked and Death Race 2000 was a really good movie.\\"Bass p 52 Nicholas Niciphor, a recent graduate of USC, was given the job of rewriting and directing the film. Niciphor got the job on the recommendation of Joe Roth, who admired Niciphor's short films. Niciphor said that he had less than two weeks to write and pre-produce the film. He also said that Carradine was reluctant to do the film, as he was making more prestigious films at the time, and would only be available for 21 days. Gary Graver was hired to shoot the movie and he lobbied for Claudia Jennings to be the female lead.Bass p 52-53 =Shooting= Many locations were used around the Los Angeles area including the famous Vasquez Rocks and Bronson Caves both of which have appeared in many films and television episodes. Shooting was problematic. Niciphor said that it became \\"hell\\" from the third day of shooting. \\"The script was too ambitious, the shooting schedule too tight and...the crew and the cast were largely sodden with drugs.\\" The director claimed that Carradine was very open with his drug use and that Claudia Jennings had both a drinking problem and a cocaine problem. The film fell behind schedule and Corman threatened to replace Niciphor with Alan Arkush. Arkush said Niciphor \\"didn‚Äôt shoot the action scenes, he had problems with screen direction. ..It was a frustrating experience for him, and he didn‚Äôt get along with the actors on top of it.‚ÄùBass p 53 Graver said the director \\"was just paranoid and crazy and nervous and everything. We all tried to help him, really. He couldn‚Äôt hack it. Some people shouldn‚Äôt be on film sets. He was mean to Claudia.‚ÄùBass p 53 In a 1990 letter to Psychotronic Video magazine (Psychotronic Video #7), David Carradine described writer and director Nicholas Niciphor as \\"a very talented and crazy guy. As a director he was erratic and unknowing...The picture, which was brilliantly written, was unable to overcome the madness of the shoot\\". Carradine said Niciphor's \\"direction seemed to me to mainly consist of hysteria and episodic tantrums.\\"Carradine, p. 453 Specifically he claimed that, on one occasion, Niciphor \\"physically attacked\\" Claudia Jennings and that Carradine \\"beat up\\" Niciphor in response. Niciphor countered these claims in a 1991 letter to Psychotronic Video magazine (Psychotronic Video #9) where he claimed that he and two stuntmen had physically removed Jennings from a motorcycle when Niciphor realized that she was drunk and apparently high on cocaine (Jennings had a well-known cocaine addiction in the late 1970s). He said that Carradine was not there during this exchange, but admitted that the actor did assault him on several occasions, one of which resulted in Carradine breaking Niciphor's nose and led to the director winding up in the hospital. Corman insisted that Niciphor return to shooting, or he would be replaced with Arkush. Niciphor went back to the set and completed the movie, in time for Carradine to leave and go film Circle of Iron. Carradine wrote in his memoirs that, when the time came to shoot a sex scene between Carradine and Jennings, Niciphor told Carradine that he had not been with a woman in six months and could not be in a room with a naked Jennings, and asked Carradine to direct it.Carradine, p. 454 =Reshoots= Several weeks later Corman asked Niciphor to return to shoot some additional scenes. Niciphor says that he refused because he did not want to work with Carradine again. Carradine claimed that it was because the scenes involved filming explosions and Niciphor had PTSD from his experiences as a soldier in the Vietnam War. Nicophor denies this, however, and says that it was just about Carradine. Allan Arkush was called in to complete the film, recutting it and adding new scenes. Arkush later claimed that: > Mostly we just blew up motorcycles. Lots of them. We also set some mutants > on fire. And the stunning Claudia Jennings got naked. David > Carradine...smoked a lot of high-grade weed and helped us to blow stuff > up...Sad to say, I couldn't save the picture.Allan Arkush on Deathsport at > Trailers From Hell Arkush added that Jennings did have a cocaine problem and \\"at times she was definitely a little ‚Äòglazed over‚Äô on the set.\\"Bass p 53 Carradine said that one of the additional scenes shot was of Jennings being tortured while naked. He said that Corman asked for this, as the producer felt that there was insufficient nudity.Carradine, p. 454 Release The film was not as successful at the box office as Death Race 2000 and a proposed second follow- up film, Deathworld, was announced but never made. Carradine called the film \\"terrible\\" and claimed that \\"my career never really fully recovered from that blunder.\\"Carradine, p. 465 On August 3, 2010, Shout! Factory released Deathsport, along with the 1982 film Battletruck, on a double-feature Collector's Edition DVD. Soundtrack The film was scored by Andy Stein and featured guitar riffs from Jerry Garcia.

For the 2005 election the constitution was amended to create a single vice-president (Hondurans previously elected three 'presidential designates' on a ticket along with the presidential candidate). For the 2005 election the system of proportional representation was also changed from a closed list to an open list - the parties also used open-list primaries to select candidate slates. The list system reduced the re-election rate of incumbents, with just 31% of deputies in the new Congress having seats in the 2002‚Äì2006 Congress. Primaries Primary elections (internal party elections) were held for the first time in Honduras in this election, in February 2005. Only the Liberal Party and National Party participated in these elections, since the smaller parties lack significant factions. They were supervised by the official electoral body, and the 72-hour ban on the sale of alcohol which accompanies all official elections was also imposed over that weekend. 45% of the electorate voted in the primaries: 24% for the Liberals and 21% for the National Party. According to the Country Report quoted in the U.C.

Here the original curve with the tangents drawn from it is a semicircle. Visual calculus, invented by Mamikon Mnatsakanian (known as Mamikon), is an approach to solving a variety of integral calculus problems.Visual Calculus Mamikon Mnatsakanian Many problems that would otherwise seem quite difficult yield to the method with hardly a line of calculation, often reminiscent of what Martin Gardner calls \\"aha! solutions\\" or Roger Nelsen a proof without words.Nelsen, Roger B. (1993). Proofs without Words, Cambridge University Press. .Martin Gardner (1978) Aha! Insight, W.H. Freeman & Company; Description Illustration of Mamikon's method showing that the areas of two annuli with the same chord length are the same regardless of inner and outer radii. Mamikon devised his method in 1959 while an undergraduate, first applying it to a well-known geometry problem: Find the area of a ring (annulus), given the length of a chord tangent to the inner circumference. (Perhaps surprisingly, no additional information is needed; the solution does not depend on the ring's inner and outer dimensions.) The traditional approach involves algebra and application of the Pythagorean theorem. Mamikon's method, however, envisions an alternate construction of the ring: First the inner circle alone is drawn, then a constant-length tangent is made to travel along its circumference, \\"sweeping out\\" the ring as it goes. Now if all the (constant- length) tangents used in constructing the ring are translated so that their points of tangency coincide, the result is a circular disk of known radius (and easily computed area). Indeed, since the inner circle's radius is irrelevant, one could just as well have started with a circle of radius zero (a point)--and sweeping out a ring around a circle of zero radius is indistinguishable from simply rotating a line segment about one of its endpoints and sweeping out a disk. Mamikon's insight was to recognize the equivalence of the two constructions; and because they are equivalent, they yield equal areas. Moreover, so long as it is given that the tangent length is constant, the two starting curves need not be circular--a finding not easily proven by more traditional geometric methods. This yields Mamikon's theorem: :The area of a tangent sweep is equal to the area of its tangent cluster, regardless of the shape of the original curve. Applications Tom Apostol has produced a very readable introduction to the subject.A VISUAL Approach to CALCULUS problems An introduction by Tom Apostol In it he shows that the problems of finding the area of a cycloid and tractrix can be solved by very young students. \\"Moreover, the new method also solves some problems unsolvable by calculus, and allows many incredible generalizations yet unknown in mathematics.\\" He also mentions that combining Mamikon's method with the geometric solution yields a new proof of the Pythagorean Theorem. Solutions to many other problems appear on Mamikon's Visual Calculus site. =Area of a cycloid= Finding the area of a cycloid using Mamikon's theorem. The area of a cycloid can be calculated by considering the area between it and an enclosing rectangle. These tangents can all be clustered to form a circle. If the circle generating the cycloid has radius then this circle also has radius and area . The area of the rectangle is . Therefore the area of the cycloid is : it is 3 times the area of the generating circle. The tangent cluster can be seen to be a circle because the cycloid is generated by a circle and the tangent to the cycloid will be at right angle to the line from the generating point to the rolling point. Thus the tangent and the line to the contact point form a right-angled triangle in the generating circle. This means that clustered together the tangents will describe the shape of the generating circle.

It's also the longest street (21.0 km) in the city. It starts at the north end of downtown at Locke Street North and is a two-way street that stretches eastward through a number of different and varied communities in the city and ends in Winona at Fifty Road just west of the Hamilton/Niagara regional boundary. The street is divided in East and West portions, divided by James Street. However, the East designation does not continue through the Stoney Creek district (which includes Winona), which was a separate municipality prior to amalgamation in 2001, and the designation as well as the address numbering system were not restructured upon amalgamation, and numbers reset at the former city limits at Centennial Parkway. History St.Stanislaw Kostka Polish Roman Catholic Church In the early days Hamilton was known as Barton township, named after a township in Lincoln County, England. Barton Street is all that remains of the township. In 1816, Barton township Population was 668. On 24 May 1909 a Coney Island-type amusement Park was opened in Hamilton. It was known as Maple Leaf Park and was bounded by Barton Street (north), Ottawa Street (east), Cannon Street (south), Rosslyn Avenue (west). It failed to attract enough visitors to keep the gates open and only lasted a year. Investors of the Park sold the land to local real estate speculators for $25,000 interested in the property because the land itself was a valuable commodity in the booming East Hamilton market. It had a \\"Figure 8\\" roller coaster. This was the most popular coaster model of the era, with many Canadian parks having one. Most were built by Fred Ingersoll. Barton Street East actually \\"changed\\" locations in the late 1960s. Barton Street East heading east from Strathearne Avenue, ended at Walter Avenue, where you continued south on Walter Avenue (to present day Melvin Avenue) and it continued east to Fifty Road in Stoney Creek. The section east of Walter Avenue was called Superior Street (for the Superior Propane Company) and it ended close to Talbot Street. Some buildings on Melvin Avenue close to Woodward Avenue still have signage indicating their address as Barton Street East (i.e. Bar-Wood Apts. 2041 Barton Street East). Hamilton's first artificial skating surface was The Forum. Locals referred to it as the Barton Street Arena. It was situated between Sanford Avenue and Wentworth Streets. It opened 8 January 1913. Eventually, a few years down the line it was purchased by Kenneth D. Soble and then he announced a new rink would be built and the new Forum opened up for business 1 October 1953. The rink lasted until 1976. That's when the Junior A hockey club Hamilton Fincups left Hamilton. Demolition started in September 1976. Present-day Centre Mall used to be the site of the Jockey Club racetrack but in the years after the Second World War the push for Hamilton's eastward expansion had completely engulfed the Jockey Club property. On 26 September 1952 the racetrack was sold. The site would then become the site of the Greater Hamilton Shopping Centre. Centre Mall reconstruction project Centre Mall owners announce plans for a 23-building super centre on the property on Barton Street East. Cost is estimated to be around $100-million and will take up of retail space. This will end up being the largest redevelopment project in the history of Hamilton's east-end. The buildings on the property will be grouped around the edge of the property and create a friendly, pedestrian-oriented design rather than a commercial island in a sea of parking. The overhaul will take about two-and-a-half years to complete but the bulk of the work is expected to be done by the end of the summer of 2008. Some new buildings will go up before the enclosed mall is torn down. The redevelopment of Centre Mall is transforming the entire neighbourhood from Ottawa Street to Kenilworth Avenue. The $100-million investment in the mall has boosted Ottawa Street North - already the city's No.1 tourist destination. The garment district has also morphed into a holistic home decor destination area, complete with lighting, antique, design & glass stores. The Ottawa Street B.I.A. had the most application and grants under the commercial property improvement program in 2007 with thirty three and it had an effect on the property values and real estate activity in the district.

The split had its roots in a long-standing dispute between the de facto leader of the Ralliement, R√©al Caouette, and the party's national leader, Robert N. Thompson. At the party's 1960 leadership convention, held two years after the party lost all of its seats in the House of Commons of Canada, Thompson defeated Caouette for the leadership. The party returned to Parliament in the 1962 federal election, but all but four of its 29 MPs came from Quebec. Under the circumstances, Thompson was all but forced to name Caouette as deputy leader of the party. The relationship was strained, however, and the strain was exacerbated when the party failed to make any gains in its old heartland of the Prairies in the 1963 federal election. Only Thompson and three others were elected outside of Quebec, while 20 Socreds were elected in Quebec. The two factions of the party were not re-united until October 1971. Founding a new party The Social Credit Party had been represented in Parliament in one form or another from 1935 until the 1958 election, when the Progressive Conservatives under John Diefenbaker won the biggest majority government in Canadian history. All 19 Socred MPs lost their seats. Caouette, a social credit adherent since 1939, did much to build a strong base for the movement in Quebec while it was out of Parliament. He founded the Ralliement des cr√©ditistes du Canada as the party's Quebec branch. By 1961, his following had grown to the point that he felt he should succeed Solon Earl Low as party leader. At the ensuing leadership convention, Caouette lost to Thompson, who had the support of the leader of the party's most powerful branch, Alberta Premier Ernest Manning. Whatever the case, when the party returned to Parliament Hill in the 1962 election, its dynamics were greatly altered. Of the 29 Social Credit MPs, only four‚Äîincluding Thompson‚Äîcame from the party's traditional heartland in western Canada. The other 25 came from Quebec, including Caouette. More or less by default, Caouette became the party's deputy leader. Thompson and Caouette never got along very well, and their relationship became even chillier after the 1963 election. The party held onto all of its seats in Quebec, but lost four seats in English Canada. The Quebec cr√©ditistes considered Caouette, not Thompson, to be their true leader. Eventually, Caouette came to believe that since the party was strongest in Quebec nationally, he should be its leader. However, Thompson refused to give way. Matters came to a head at the annual meeting of the Quebec wing of the party in Granby, Quebec, held on 1 September 1963. The 600 delegates in attendance voted to establish a new party. The vote was held after virtually no discussion by a show of hands. Approximately three-quarters of the delegates supported the motion to: # no longer recognize Thompson as party leader; and # ask the party's Quebec Members of Parliament (MPs) to name a parliamentary leader until a leadership convention could be held. The convention also voted to appoint a ten-member committee to consider forming an affiliated party to contest provincial elections.Dufresne, Bernard, ‚ÄúQuebec‚Äôs Socreds vote to Disown Thompson‚Äù, Globe and Mail, 2 September 1963, p.1 After the vote, 16 of the party's 19 Quebec MPs met to consider approval of the motion. Ten of the MPs approved it immediately, while six deferred approval pending discussions with their constituents. Gerard Chapdelaine (Sherbrooke), Henri Latulippe (Compton‚ÄîFrontenac) and Charles-Eugene Dionne (Kamouraska) did not attend the meeting. (Dr. Guy Marcoux, who had been elected as a Social Credit MP in Quebec‚ÄîMontmorency in 1963, had left the Socred caucus to sit as an ‚Äúindependent Social Credit‚Äù MP.) Caouette then gave a 55-minute speech to the convention saying that the results were the basis for forming an ‚Äúefficient national Social Credit movement‚Äù. On the Saturday of the convention, Caouette had given a 90-minute speech in which he described Thompson as a ‚Äúmarionette‚Äù for Manning. He also dropped a bombshell: he claimed that in 1960, ten minutes before the leadership vote, Manning had instructed him to ‚Äútell your people to vote for Thompson because the West will never accept a Roman Catholic French Canadian leader‚Äù. Thompson's response to the split in his party was limited at first: ‚ÄúQuebec doesn‚Äôt quite run me yet, nor the country.‚Äù The following day, he said that the Social Credit Party would now have wider acceptance throughout Canada than it had before because of Caouette's departure.Globe and Mail, ‚Äú7 in Quebec Give Support to Thompson‚Äù, 3 September 1963, p. 1 On 2 September 1963, seven Quebec MPs announced that they would be supporting Caouette's breakaway faction: Maurice Cot√© (Chicoutimi), Jean-Louis Frenette (Portneuf), Chapdelaine, Gerard Ouelette (Rimouski), Marcel Lessard (Lac-Saint-Jean) and Gerard Grouard (Labelle). Dr. Marcoux rejoined the Social Credit Party and announced his loyalty to Thompson. (Marcoux had never stated his reasons for quitting the party, but said that the reasons had now been removed.) This left the Thompson faction with 11 MPs, the Caouette faction with ten, and three MPs who had not announced.Dufresne, Bernard, ‚Äú7 in Quebec Give Support to Thompson‚Äù, Globe and Mail, 3 September 1963, p. 1 The Ralliement's riding executive in Marcoux's Quebec‚ÄîMontmorency riding called for his resignation, saying that he had \\"betrayed us, has lost our confidence forever, and for the last time we ask him to resign.\\"Montreal Gazette, 11 September 1963, \\"Vote of Quebec MP to Caouette's group Gives Power Balance\\", p.1 The Thompson loyalists said that they had been elected to work in the interests of party policies throughout the country under Thompson's leadership, and that that mandate would remain intact until the next election. Further, they said that the positions of party leader and deputy leader could only be determined by a national convention. They announced that they would establish a new branch of the National Social Credit Association in Quebec to replace Caouette's Ralliement des cr√©ditistes, which had been serving in that role. They also said that they expected that they would be expelled from the Ralliement. Caouette met with 14 Quebec Socred MPs on 2 September 1963 to start work on creating the new party, saying, ‚ÄúEventually we will attempt to make this a national party and take it across Canada to protect French Canadians in every province.‚Äù Dufresne, Bernard, ‚ÄúIn the Separatist Shadow‚Äù, Globe and Mail, 3 September 1963, p. 7 His faction now included Charles Gauthier (Roberval), Gilles Gregoire (Lapointe), Gerard Perron (Beauce), Gilbert Rondeau (Shefford), Pierre Boulin (Dorchester), R. Beaul√© (Quebec Est), L.-P. Boulanger (Charlevoix), Raymond Langlois (Megantic), in addition to Latulippe and Dionne. Caouette was elected parliamentary leader and Gregoire was elected House Leader. Caouette again called for a new national convention of the Social Credit Party of Canada to choose a new leader, and announced that the Thompson loyalists in the Quebec caucus would not be expelled from the Ralliement des creditistes. Caouette said that Thompson did not care about the French Canadian view of politics, and was afraid of embracing social credit doctrine, for which there was more support in Quebec than in the rest of Canada.Dufresne, 3 September 1963 On 10 September 1963, Lucien Plourde, MP for Quebec West, declared his support for Caouette,Globe and Mail, ‚ÄúCreditiste MPs Outweigh Socreds‚Äù, 11 September 1963, p.41 bringing the Ralliement caucus to 13. The Thompson faction was now reduced to 11 MPs, one less than the minimum for a party to be a recognized group in the Commons, which meant that Caouette‚Äîand not Thompson‚Äîwould receive an extra $4,000 per year in compensation (worth about $29,700 in 2011 dollars), and be given priority in speaking in the House.Globe and Mail, 11 September 1963Montreal Gazette, 11 September 1963 As a measure of how much the party's dynamics had changed, seven of the Social Credit Party's 11 MPs were from Quebec. Reaction in the rest of Canada W.A.C. Bennett, the Socred Premier of British Columbia, had supported Caouette's bid for the leadership of the national party in 1960. However, following the split, Bennett declared his support for Thompson, albeit in a less than convincing way: ‚ÄúI am for making unity, not disunity. What‚Äôs-his-name [Thompson] was elected national leader at the national convention and he is the national leader.‚ÄùGlobe and Mail, ‚ÄúBennett Forgets ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs His Name‚Äô‚Äù, 6 September 1963 The rejection of Thompson's leadership by the Quebec wing of the party was supported by a group of rebels in the Ontario Social Credit Association called ‚ÄúSocial Credit Action‚Äù. This group had split from the Ontario wing of the party over its refusal to campaign aggressively in provincial elections. Social Credit Action, led by James Audy, the party's former candidate in Spadina riding, and by David Hartman, also of Toronto, announced its support for Caouette. Audy blamed the split on Thompson, saying that he only wanted to keep power for Manning.Dufresne, 2 September 1963. While Audy was announced by Caouette as leader of the Ralliement's Ontario wing he did not run in the 1965 federal election. In that election, Caouette's party only ran two candidates outside of Quebec, Raymond Berthiaume in the Glengarry‚ÄîPrescott and Joseph-Hurgel Dub√© in Restigouche‚ÄîMadawaska, both ridings with large francophone populations. In the 1968 federal election they again stood a candidate in Restigouche but nowhere else outside of Quebec. A separatist element? There is evidence that support for the split came, in part, from a Quebec separatist element in the party. Yvan Piche, chief organizer of the Parti r√©publicain, a separatist party led by Marcel Chaput, attended the annual meeting of the Quebec wing as an observer, and was seen talking to groups of young delegates. For his part, Caouette walked a thin line between federalism and separatism. He made no secret of his strong nationalist views, but maintained that he wanted to work within the spirit and letter of Confederation: ‚ÄúLet us not burn our bridges. It is not the time for le Ralliement des cr√©ditistes to be separatists, but rather to win recognition for the French fact within Canada.‚Äù Caouette said that he would fight for the recognition of French Canada's aspirations within Confederation on the basis of a partnership with the other nine provinces, ‚ÄúBut if this partnership cannot be brought about, I shall become the more ardent separatist in Quebec.‚ÄùDufresne, ‚ÄúIn the Separatist Shadow‚Äù, Globe and Mail, 3 September 1963, p. 7 Resolution Thompson's Social Credit Party continued to stagnate, electing only five MPs to the House of Commons in the 1965 federal election - one up from the 1962 and 1963 performance in English Canada. Bennett, leader of the party's second-most powerful provincial branch, cut off his party's financial and organizational support to the federal party in order to pressure the national Social Credit Party to reconcile with Caouette's wing.\\"Socred leader resigns, lack of support cited\\", Globe and Mail, March 10, 1967 Meanwhile, the Alberta wing also failed to give its federal counterpart material and organizational support. Manning, was concerned at the leftward drift of Canadian politics and urged Thompson to negotiate a merger between Social Credit and Robert Stanfield's Progressive Conservatives. Thompson attempted this but was unsuccessful. Facing the loss of their seats, in 1967, Bud Olson crossed the floor to join the Liberals. The next year, Thompson himself joined the Tories with the open support of both Manning and Stanfield. The three remaining Social Credit MPs lost their seats in the 1968 federal election, leaving Caouette's party as the sole representative of the Canadian social credit movement in the House of Commons. This cleared the way for the two parties to reunite at the 1971 Social Credit convention. Caouette was elected as the reunified party's leader. However, the party's dynamics had been permanently altered. It would never win another seat in English Canada, and went into headlong decline after Caouette's death in 1976. The party lost its remaining seats in 1980, never to return.

Background Candace Mossler and her nephew Melvin Lane Powers, with whom she was having an incestuous affair, were charged with the killing of Mossler‚Äôs millionaire husband, Jacques Mossler, in his Key Biscayne, Florida, condominium on June 29, 1964. Mossler and her husband were separated at the time of his murder. Jacques Mossler had considered suing Powers and divorcing his wife but, upon consultation with his lawyer, had decided against doing so in order to avoid the negative publicity and losing half of his fortune to his wife. At the time of her husband's murder, Mossler was on a $5,000 a week stipend allocated for household upkeep. During initial interviews with police officers, Candace Mossler asserted that she believed her husband's death was a result of a burglary gone wrong. However, when the officers stated they believed the murder was a crime of passion, noting that Jacques Mossler had been stabbed over thirty times before being bludgeoned over the head with a glass bowl, Mossler changed her story, saying that she believed that her husband had been a closeted homosexual, and had been cheating on her with another man who could have possibly committed the crime. As her husband had been found wearing only a bath robe, officers pursued this lead until they found Jacques Mossler's diary, which cast suspicion directly upon his wife and his nephew. Media coverage and trial The media took note of the salacious case and covered it extensively. Soon, the public began to demand an indictment of Candace Mossler and her nephew Melvin Powers. It finally came on July 20, 1965. Candy Mossler was represented by a pair of Houston's best defense attorneys, Clyde Woody and Marian Rosen. Melvin Powers was defended by top-ranked Houston defense lawyers Percy Foreman and William F Walsh, the former a high-profile attorney who years later defended James Earl Ray, the man convicted of killing Martin Luther King, Jr. As the assets Mossler was set to inherit from her late husband were frozen at the time of her arrest pending the investigation of his death, Mossler paid Foreman's retainer with jewelry, diamonds, and furs that had been bought for her by her late husband before their separation. Prior to her arrest, Mossler had flown to Rochester, Minnesota to undergo treatment at the Mayo Clinic for migraines, but agreed to fly to Miami to surrender rather than risk the indignity of a surprise arrest. Accompanied by a private nurse and wearing a Mayo Clinic wrist identification band, she flew from Minnesota to Miami International Airport, where she was treated to a genteel arrest by a state police commander. A mighty press contingent had gathered at the airport, and Mossler smiled and posed for them. When reporters confronted her with allegations of adultery, incest, and murder, she simply replied, \\"Well, nobody's perfect.\\" Mossler, a former model with platinum blond hair and a southern accent, was notable for her on-camera charm. While jail inmates shouted obscenities at her, she would smile and blow kisses at the cameras. She rented two adjoining flats at the White Hall Apartments on the North West side of town, and her children joined her. Meanwhile, investigators in Texas and Florida continued working for months to uncover evidence. Police officers turned up four witnesses who claimed the lovers had solicited a hit on \\"the old mooch.\\" The investigators lined up a long list of witnesses--neighbors, employees, hotel clerks--who said they had seen Mel and Candy share affectionate moments. Cops found a photographic record of Candy and Mel's travels--souvenir snapshots from nightclubs, ski slopes, concerts. The courtroom was filled to maximum capacity with spectators every day of the murder trial. People brought their lunches with them and ate during court proceedings in order to retain their seats all day. The subject matter was considered so prurient that people under the age of 21 were turned away. During the course of their trial, lawyer Percy Foreman declined to call any witnesses to the stand, in direct contrast to the district attorney, who called a number of questionably relevant witnesses. Instead, Foreman emphasized his closing statement which, by many accounts, was extremely compelling. Both Mossler and Powers were acquitted. Police officers and the district attorney's office declined to continue the search for Jacques Mossler's murderers afterwards, as they maintained their initial conclusion that Candace Mossler and her lover had committed the crime. Eventually, Powers and Mossler drifted apart and Mossler remarried. Death On October 26, 1976, Candace Mossler died of an accidental overdose of migraine medicationhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/36892036 in Miami Beach, Florida. She was 56.

Central C.F.5, was a British civil two/three-seat biplane aircraft produced by Central Aircraft Company Limited of London. History The Centaur IV was a two-seat wire-braced, fabric- covered wooden biplane designed by A.A. Fletcher. It was the first original design to be built by Central Aircraft Company at Kilburn, London during 1919. The prototype had a 70 hp (52 kW) Renault air-cooled V-8 engine but the seven production aircraft were fitted with an Anzani radial engine. The Centaur IV was originally proposed in two versions: *A two-seat aircraft, with the two seats side-by-side in an open cockpit; *A three-seat aircraft, with two seats side-by-side and the open cockpit extended to allow installation of a third (single) seat. No market existed for private ownership at that time, so the eight aircraft were all built as three-seaters. All the aircraft were initially used by Central Aircraft for joyriding or instruction at Northolt Aerodrome. The fifth aircraft was fitted with a three-float undercarriage. It was used for a week giving joyrides at Southend-on-Sea. It was converted into a landplane later in 1920 and crashed in October 1920. As the postwar slump continued, some of the aircraft were sold in Belgium and were still operating in 1938. The last survivor was destroyed in the German invasion of Belgium in May 1940.

Originally a midfielder, Wilding became somewhat of a utility player during his time at Shrewsbury, playing in every position during his six-year stay at Gay Meadow. He played as a goalkeeper when he deputised for the injured Paul Edwards in a match against Torquay United on 18 December 1998. Playing career Wilding spent much of his playing career in the Shrewsbury local leagues, however his good form led him to sign with then Conference National side Telford United in 1996. After one and a half seasons, Telford manager Jake King was appointed manager at neighbouring Shrewsbury Town, with one of King's first acts as Shrewsbury manager being to sign Wilding from Telford for ¬£10,000 in August 1997. Wilding was to play under two managers during his stay at Shrewsbury, Jake King, and later Kevin Ratcliffe. Whilst not one of the big names in the Shrewsbury squad, the hometown player endeared himself to Shrewsbury fans with his dependable, workmanlike performances. Arguably Wilding's finest season was the 2002-03 season. In the FA Cup third round, Shrewsbury famously defeated Everton 2‚Äì1. Whilst Nigel Jemson grabbed most of the headlines by scoring both goals, Wilding had a superb game, completely marking Wayne Rooney out of the game. Sadly for Shrewsbury, their form dipped in the latter half of the season, eventually finishing bottom of the Football League Third Division. Despite this, Wilding was seen as one of the side's best players that season, and escaped much of the intense criticism levelled at some of his 'big name' teammates. Following relegation, Ratcliffe resigned, and Wilding was one of the few players to be offered a new contract by Ratcliffe's replacement Jimmy Quinn. Feeling unhappy with the terms of the contract, Wilding opted to reject it, and retired from professional football. Wilding later signed for League of Wales side Welshpool Town before retiring from football in 2004. He went on to run a lastering business in Shrewsbury - His job before turning pro, while still being the adulation of those who saw him play. as, while he may not have been the most gifted footballer, he was the \\"local boy, done good\\" who gave his all, and didn't stop trying.

A number of the Pomo, an indigenous people of California, had been enslaved by two settlers, Andrew Kelsey and Charles Stone, and confined to one village, where they were starved and abused, until they rebelled and murdered their captors. In response, the U.S. Cavalry murdered at least 60 of the local Pomo. Background The Bloody Island Massacre (also called the Clear Lake massacre) occurred on an island called in the Pomo language, Bo-no- po-ti or Badon-napo-ti (Island Village), at the north end of Clear Lake, Lake County, California, on May 15, 1850.Clear Lake's First People. (pdf file) Habematolel Pomo of Upper Lake. (retrieved 27 Feb 2009)Key, Karen. Bloody Island (Bo-no-po-ti). The Historical Marker Database. 31 June 2007 (retrieved 27 Feb 2009) It was a place where the Pomo had traditionally gathered for the spring fish spawn. After this event, it became known as Bloody Island. A number of Pomo, primarily members living in the Big Valley area, had been enslaved, interned, and severely abused by settlers Andrew Kelsey (namesake of Kelseyville, California) and Charles Stone.https://www.academia.edu/5539505/The_Kelsey_Brothers_A_California_Disaster Dr. John Parker's 2012 review of the various accounts of the incident. Kelsey and Stone purchased cattle running free in Big Valley from Salvador Vallejo in 1847. They captured and impressed local Pomo to work as vaqueros (cowboys). They also forced them to build them a permanent shelter with promises for rations that were not kept. Because they made a residence there, their treatment of the Pomo was more brutal than had been Vallejo's, though the massacred Pomos at Anderson Island might have argued that point. The people were eventually confined to a village surrounded by a stockade and were not allowed weapons or fishing implements. Families starved on the meager rations they provided, only four cups of wheat a day for a family. When one young man asked for more wheat for his sick mother, Stone reportedly killed him.Elizabeth Larson, \\"Bloody Island atrocity remembered at Saturday ceremony\\", Lake County News, 13 May 2007 (retrieved 27 Feb 2009) In the fall of 1849, Kelsey forced 50 Pomo men to work as laborers on a second gold- seeking expedition to the Placer gold fields. Kelsey became ill with malaria and sold the rations to other miners. The Pomo starved, and only one or two men returned alive.They also captured all the Pomo from the Scotts Valley village and forced both camps to march to Sonoma and build the Vallejo hacienda that exists today. Gradually those people made their way home.Richerson, Pete and Scott Richerson. \\"Bloody Island\\", in Putah and Cache: A Thinking Mammal's Guide to the Watershed, ed. Amy J. Boyer, Jan Goggans, Daniel Leroy, David Robertson, and Rob Thayer, University of California, Davis, 2001 (retrieved 27 Feb 2009) Stone and Kelsey regularly forced the Pomo parents to bring their daughters to them to be sexually abused. If they refused they were whipped mercilessly. A number of them died from that abuse. Both men indentured and abused the Pomo women. The starving Pomo became so desperate that Massacre On May 15, 1850, a 1st Dragoons Regiment of the United States Cavalry contingent under Nathaniel Lyon, then still a lieutenant, and Lieutenant J. W. Davidson tried to locate Augustine's band to punish them. When they instead came upon a group of Pomo on Badon-napoti (later called Bloody Island), they killed old men, women and children. The National Park Service has estimated the army killed 60 of 400 Pomo; other accounts say 200 were killed. Most of the younger men were off in the mountains to the north, hunting. Some of the dead were relatives of Habematolel Pomo of Upper Lake and Robinson Rancheria of Pomo Indians of California. The army killed 75 more Indians along the Russian River. One of the Pomo survivors of the massacre was a 6-year-old girl named Ni'ka, or Lucy Moore. She hid underwater and breathed through a tule reed. Her descendants formed the Lucy Moore Foundation to work for better relations between the Pomo and other residents of California. Legacy Later, the Pomo were forced to live in small rancherias set aside by the federal government. For most of the 20th century, the Pomo, reduced in number, survived on such tiny reservations in poverty. Few textbooks on California history mentioned the Bloody Island incident or abuse of the native Californians. Two separate historical markers record the site. The first, placed by the Native Sons of the Golden West on 20 May 1942 on Reclamation Road 0.3 miles off Highway 20, simply noted the location as the scene of a \\"battle\\" between U.S. soldiers under \\"Captain\\" Lyons and Indians under Chief Augustine.Historical Marker Database.

Amongst other things, the concept of single window clearance as advocated by this committee report draw parallels with government's effort towards improving ease of doing business in the country. National programs and legislation The Government of India has launched various programs since its independence, such as some of the five-year plans, to alleviate poverty and address the widening income gap, both, amongst the upper and lower classes of society, and amongst the rural and urban parts of the country.

For instance, the \\"Eighth Plan policy guidelines envisages integrated approach to alleviation of urban poverty and servicing the urban poor with basic facilities so that their quality of life improves.\\" As trends in the Gini coefficient reflect, the income gaps were not as pronounced until the early 1980s, but the situation has been continually getting worse since. Misplaced priorities of the Indian Government and bad planning of subsidy programs is largely responsible for this.

While newly launched programs like Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MNREGA), National Rural Health Mission (NRHM), Food Security Act, Mid-day Meals and Bharat Nirman Yojana have demonstrated success in the initial stages, their performance over the long- run still remains to be seen. The shortsightedness of the Indian government often leads it to launch populist programs that may not necessarily work well. Low-hanging fruit like increasing worker's minimum wage can go a long way in achieving the goal of poverty alleviation, but are yet to be taken up in spite of reminders from leading economists.Ashenfelter, Orley, and Stƒõp√°n Jurajda.

History The name of Shyamngar came from a folk etymology of Samne+ garh (‡¶∏‡¶æ‡¶Æ‡¶®‡ßá+ ‡¶ó‡¶¢‡¶º), which in course of time changed to Shyamnagar. Great Banyan Tree with Mulajore Kalibari During the rule of Raja Krishnachandra Roy of Krishnanagar, the king gave the village called 'Mulajore' along with a title of Roy Gunakar to his court poet Bharatchandra Ray. In memory of Bharat Chandra Roy Gunakar there is an old and historic library named Bharat Chandra Library, established in 1906. It is situated close to the railway station. Relatives of Rabindranath Tagore had set up Mulajor Kalibari at Shyamnagar in North 24 Parganas and it is unknown to many people. The temple beside Hooghly River is very eye soothing. One of the priests said the temple was constructed on 31 Baishakh in 1219 Bengali year around 200 years ago beside Hooghly River even before Dakhineswar Kali temple was set up by Rani Rashmoni Devi. Six priests are engaged for offering puja to goddess Kali and one of the temple priests said. \\"No dedicated book had been written on this temple and gradually history is fading away but we know relatives of Rabindranath Tagore constructed this temple\\". Srijit Thakur is the surviving member of the Thakur family whose ancestors set up the temple, lives in Rajbari at Pathuriaghata Street near Natunbazar in Kolkata. According to the biographer of Rabindranath Tagore, Prabhat Kumar Mukhopadhyaya, the original surname of the Tagores was Kushari. They were Rarhi Brahmins and originally belonged to a village named Kush in the district named Burdwan in West Bengal. Rabindranath Tagore's ancestor Dinanath Kushari, the son of Bhatta Narayana was a native of this village.Mukhopadhyaya, Prabhatkumar, Rabindrajibani o Rabindra Sahitya Prabeshak, 1985, Visva Bharati, p 3On the edges of time (New ed.)

One of the descendants Panchanan Kushari later came back from Jessore District in East Bengal to West Bengal and settled in Gobindopur.\\"https://banglalive.com/jorasanko-thakurbari-muslim-connection/ \\" \\"Panchanan got the title thakur since then his family member used to write the title Thakur instead of Kusari,\\" said a priest. Jairam Thakur (Kusari) was latter generation had four sons- Anandiram, Nilmoni, Darpanarayan and Gobindaram. Prince Dwarkanath Tagore was the next generation of Anandiram, whose son was Debendranath and Rabindranath was his eighth son. Debendranath, however, became Brahmo and did not believe in idol worshipping. It had not been known whether he or his sons ever visited the temple. Gopimohan Thakur, the son of Darpanarayan founded the temple. Gopimohan had two sons Prsanna Kumar and Harakumar and daughter Brahmamoyee. Prasanna Kumar had one son Pradyot Kumar and Harakumar had Jatindromohan. Surviving member Srijit Thakur is the son of Prabirendro Mohan, who was the son of Pradyot Kumar. According to local tale that the present place of the Kali temple was occupied of 'Nandi' (caste) and 'Pirali' so experienced priest from 'Bhatpara toll (Sanskrit educational institution)‚Äô used to refuse offering puja to the goddess Mulajore Shyamnagar Kali as a result priests were brought from Bankura, Burdwan and other places. Later a Sanskrit College was set up by the king Gopimohan Thakur as a matter of pride and to make erudite Sanskrit students. Students were accommodated in this college hostel they used to take Prasad in the temple as a lunch and dinner. Ramkumar Chattopadhyaya, elder brother of Ramakrishna Dev was the student of this college. But instead of reconstructing that dilapidated building, a heritage building of the locality with its Ionic pillars Rabindra Bhawan was set up by municipality replacing the college, ignoring the sense of heritage. Overview Rabindra Bhavan Shyamnagar is situated on the east bank of the Ganges. A Kali Temple is situated in between Shyamnagar railway station and Hooghly river is known as Mulajore Kalibari. An auditorium named Rabindra Bhavan was built by Bhatpara Municipality by the side of this Kali Temple.

They were threatened with legal action initially but released three days later following diplomatic discussions between Jack Straw, then British Foreign Secretary, and Kamal Kharazi, then Iranian Minister of Foreign Affairs. The weapons and boats of the British personnel were confiscated and have not been returned. They were released unharmed three days later, on 24 June, after the British and Iranian governments agreed there had been a misunderstanding. Their equipment was not returned and a rigid inflatable boat (RIB) was put on display in a museum in Tehran. During their detention, according to former detainee Marine Scott Fallon, they endured a mock execution in which they were marched into the desert and made to stand blindfolded in front of a ditch while their captors cocked their weapons. They also appeared blindfolded on Iranian TV, where they were forced to apologise for their \\"mistake\\". The Royal Navy boats were operating close to the northern coast of the Persian Gulf in the mouth of the Shatt al-Arab waterway which divides southern Iran and Iraq. The weather was bad causing negligible visibility which may have contributed to a potential crossing of the Iranian border by the Royal Navy.

The development of a reliable 6-volt motor made it possible to produce model locomotives capable of pulling long trains. The company relocated from Chicago, Illinois, to Miami, Florida, in 1955. Varney sold his company to Sol Kramer in 1960, which became the basis for launching his own line of Life-Like Trains in 1970. Varney models were above average in quality and detail and are still quite popular with collectors and model railroad enthusiasts. History The company was founded by Gordon Varney in 1936. Varney's main significance to the model railroad community was his early advocacy of the HO scale and the development of a reliable motor small enough to power the locomotives of this gauge. Varney's early catalogs contain detailed information and instruction that clearly show an understanding of the mind of model railroaders. Gordon Varney was correctly named the \\"Dean of HO scale.\\" He definitely played a crucial part in bringing the hobby to the smaller size and offering those with less space a tremendous opportunity to enjoy model railroading at its fullest. Varney's famous V-1 motor was the beginning of his HO endeavor. It was small enough to place in an HO scale loco, with enough power to pull a long train. The motors ran on 6 volts direct current, like most designs of that day. Varney first offered the 4-6-2 Pacific and the 2-8-0 Consolidation in the late 1930s and early 1940s. The first HO scale model trains were just emerging as a viable commercial product when these steam locomotive models made their appearance. The Pacific had the USRA boiler style and was patterned after the Southern Pacific prototype. The Consolidation was designed after the Reading 2-8-0. Soon the 2-8-2 Mikado followed, and the other models were also added to the line. All of these models looked a bit crude by today's standards, but with a some effort and customization, made a beautiful prototypical model. Varney's kits often cost more than competitors, but represented the top-of-the-line quality of the day. The result was a smooth running, powerful locomotive that would rival any model on the market. The quality was apparent then, and now, many 50- and 60-year-old models are still in operation today. Vehicle Models Varney was also a leader in producing accessories, the most popular of which were miniature Ford vehicles. In 1954, Varney created a 1 1/4\\" model of the 1953 Ford Customline Fordor Sedan. With moveable wheels and incredible detailing, the accuracy was the result of the use of the AMT Corporation's 1/25-scale Customline, which was used as a master. Released at the same time were a 1949 Ford F-1 pickup truck, panel truck and stake truck, all pantographed off 1/32-scale models made by National Products. The stake truck was later modified so it could be assembled as a van or a flatbed. A 1953 Studebaker Starliner (also spawned by AMT) soon joined the Ford line-up. Originally offered in gray, red and black, in 1956 they offered these same models molded in clear styrene, allowing the really detail-oriented hobbyist to paint the vehicles and have clear plastic window glass. Sale and Legacy Varney relocated the company to Miami, Florida, in 1955. Some of the steam locomotives previously developed by Varney were acquired by Penn Line Manufacturing, which itself was later acquired by Bowser Manufacturing. In 1960, Gordon Varney sold his company to Sol Kramer of Life-Like Products. Gordon Varney died in 1965. Model trains continued to be produced under the Varney name until March 1970, when the branding was changed to \\"Life-Like.\\" Gordon Varney was named a \\"Pioneer of Model Railroading\\" by the Model Railroad Industry Association (now the Hobby Manufacturers Association) in 1985.

When a grenade landed at Hassan's feet, Bourguiba threw it back before it could detonate, probably saving the King's life.Slaughter at the Summer Palace, Time Magazine He subsequently served as the Minister of Justice until he was named by his father as a Special Counselor in 1977. He was removed from this office as part of the coup d'√©tat on 7 November 1987 which overthrew his father's administration and brought Zine El Abidine Ben Ali to power.

Designated the Centaur IIB the first aircraft, registered G-EAHR, first flew during July 1919. The fuselage had an open cockpit for the two crew and six passengers. A second example, registered G-EAPC, was built. It had the same designation Centaur IIB but had an enclosed cabin for seven passengers. The second aircraft first flew in May 1920. The second aircraft was tested by the Air Ministry in the 1920 Commercial Aeroplane Competition. It was described at the time as old-fashioned and low-powered, another problem was that loaded with all the fuel required for the three and half-hour test flight meant it was unable to carry passengers or pilots. The aircraft did not win the competition. The prototype was destroyed in an accident at Northolt Aerodrome in July 1919, shortly after the competition.

She is Ojibwe and member of Obishikokaang (Lac Seul First Nation).\\"Rebecca Belmore: Facing the Monumental\\" , Art Gallery of Ontario, 2018. Belmore currently lives in Toronto, Ontario. Belmore has performed and exhibited nationally and internationally since 1986. Her work focuses on issues of place and identity, and confronts challenges for First Nations People. Her work addresses history, voice and voicelessness, place, and identity. Her work, be it sculpture, video or photographic in nature, is performance-based. To address the politics of representation, Belmore's art strives to invert or subvert official narratives, while demonstrating a preference for the use of repetitive gesture and natural materials. Belmore's art reveals a long-standing commitment to politics and how they relate to the construction of identity and ideas of representation. She has exhibited across Canada, the US, Mexico, Cuba and Australia. In 2005, OCAD University conferred an honorary doctorate on Belmore in recognition of her career. She was the first Indigenous woman representing Canada at the Venice Biennale in 2005. She also received Canadian Governor General‚Äôs Award in Visual and Media Arts in 2013. Life Belmore was born on March 22, 1960 in Upsala, Ontario, Canada.Belmore at The Canadian Encyclopedia, accessed September 8, 2019 Until the age of 16, Belmore spent her summers in Northwestern Ontario with her grandparents. During these summers, her grandmother taught her about harvesting native foods from the land. Author Jessica Bradley describes Belmore's adolescence as difficult due to \\"the custom ingrained through the [Canadian] government imposed assimilation, she was sent to attend high school in Thunder Bay and billeted with a non-Native family.\\" Bradley adds that as a result of her experience as an adolescent, notions of displacement and cultural loss are \\"reformed into acts or objects of reparation and protest [within her various works].\\" Belmore attended the Ontario College of Art and Design in Toronto in 1988 and because of her success at the 2005 Venice Biennale, was awarded an honorary Doctorate degree in 2005. Belmore's mother was born on a small island in Northern Ontario and her journey to visit her mother's birthplace has had a significant impact on her work. Career Rebecca Belmore has presented work in biennial exhibitions throughout her career. She has twice represented Canada at the Sydney Biennale; in 1998 in the exhibition Every Day, and in 2006 in the exhibition Zones of Contact. In 2005 her work Fountain was shown at the Canadian Pavilion of the 51st Venice Biennale, as the first aboriginal artist ever to represent Canada at the event. In the same year she exhibited as part of Sweet Taboos at the 3rd Tirana Biennale, Tirana, Albania. In 1991, she exhibited at the IV Bienal de la Habana, Havana, Cuba. Jolene Rickard's Venice Biennale Catalogue essay describes Belmore's work: \\"As a First Nations or Aboriginal person, Belmore's homeland is now the modern nation of Canada; yet, there is reluctance by the art world to recognize this condition as a continuous form of cultural and political exile. The inclusion of the First Nations political base is not meant to marginalize Belmore's work, but add depth to it. People think of Belmore as both Canadian and Anishinabe‚Äîl think of her as an Anishinabe living in the continuously colonial space of the Americas.\\" Belmore has had two major solo touring exhibitions, The Named and the Unnamed, a multi-part installation that commemorates women missing from Vancouver's Downtown Eastside, at the Morris and Helen Belkin Art Gallery, Vancouver (2002); and 33 Pieces, Blackwood Gallery, University of Toronto at Mississauga (2001). In 2008, the Vancouver Art Gallery hosted Rising to the Occasion, a mid-career survey of Belmore's artistic production. In 2014, Belmore was commissioned to create an original work for the Canadian Museum for Human Rights The work consists of a blanket of hand pressed clay beads, engaging the community in Winnipeg to help produce them. In 2010, Belmore was involved in a legal dispute with the Pari Nadimi Gallery of Toronto, that sued her for punitive damages and for lost future revenues to $750,000. In 2017, Belmore's work was exhibited at documenta 14 in Athens, Greece and in Kassel, Germany. In 2018, the Art Gallery of Ontario staged a touring retrospective of Belmore's work, Facing the Monumental. Curated by Wanda Nanibush, Facing the Monumental incorporates sculptures, installations, photography and videos spanning 30 years of Belmore's career. It has been the largest exhibition of her work to date, and shown at galleries in Canada and the United States. = Artworks =  Descriptions of important works  Belmore's interactive installation Mawa- che-hitoowin: A Gathering of People for Any Purpose (1992), featured a circle of chairs from Belmore's kitchen and kitchen chairs owned by other women close to her, arranged in a circle. Each chair had a pair of headphones resting on it. Visitors were invited to sit in each chair, put on the headphones, and listen to the stories of the struggles and triumphs of different indigenous women in Canada, told in their own voices. The work was commissioned for an exhibition of Indigenous art on the 500th anniversary of Columbus's arrival in Hispanola. As such, it used Indigenous traditions of storytelling and passing on wisdom from elders as a way to push back against Native stereotypes and victimization.

Paraphasic errors are most common in patients with fluent forms of aphasia, and comes in three forms: phonemic or literal, neologistic, and verbal. Paraphasias can affect metrical information, segmental information, number of syllables, or both. Some paraphasias preserve the meter without segmentation, and some do the opposite. However, most paraphasias affect both partially. The term was apparently introduced in 1877 by the German-English physician Julius Althaus in his book on Diseases of the Nervous System, in a sentence reading, \\"In some cases there is a perfect chorea or delirium of words, which may be called paraphasia\\". Causes Paraphasia is associated with fluent aphasias, characterized by ‚Äúfluent spontaneous speech, long grammatically shaped sentences and preserved prosody abilities.‚ÄùSinanovic O, Mrkonjic Z, Zukic S, Vidovic M, Imamovic K. 2011. Post-stroke language disorders. Acta clinica Croatica 50:79-94 Examples of these fluent aphasias include receptive or Wernicke‚Äôs aphasia, anomic aphasia, conduction aphasia, and transcortical sensory aphasia, among others. All of these lead to a difference in processing efficiency, which is often caused by damage to a cortical region in the brain (in receptive aphasia, for example, the lesion is in or near Wernicke‚Äôs area); lesion location is the most important determining factor for all aphasic disorders, including paraphasia - the location of the lesion can be used to hypothesize the type of aphasic symptoms the patient will display. This lesion can be caused by a variety of different methods: malfunctioning blood vessels (caused, for example, by a stroke) in the brain are the cause of 80% of aphasias in adults, as compared to head injuries, dementia and degenerative diseases, poisoning, metabolic disorders, infectious diseases, and demyelinating diseases. Lesions involving the posterior superior temporal lobe are often associated with fluent aphasias. =Damage to the brain's language centers= Two areas of the brain, Broca‚Äôs area and Wernicke‚Äôs area, are responsible for various disruptions in speech when damaged. Each is defined by their distinct characteristics. Broca‚Äôs aphasia is characterized by non-fluent or telegraphic-type speech - where articles, conjunctions, prepositions, auxiliary verbs, pronouns and morphological inflections (plurals, past tense) are omitted. The word substitutions are infrequent and distortion of consonants and simplification of consonant clusters is frequent. Content words such as nouns, verbs and adjectives may be preserved. Subjects of this aphasia are aware of their errors in speech. Damage to the Broca‚Äôs area does not affect comprehension of speech. Wernicke‚Äôs aphasia is characterized by fluent language with made up or unnecessary words with little or no meaning to speech. Those who suffer from this type of aphasia have difficulty understanding others speech and are unaware of their own mistakes. When corrected they will repeat their verbal paraphasias and have trouble finding the correct word. Wernicke‚Äôs area is found in the dominant hemisphere of the posterior gyrus of the first temporal convolution of the brain, whereas Broca‚Äôs area is found anterior to the Wernicke‚Äôs area. Symptoms =Phonemic paraphasia= Phonemic paraphasia, also referred to as phonological paraphasia or literal paraphasia, refers to the substitution of a word with a nonword that preserves at least half of the segments and/or number of syllables of the intended word. This can lead to a variety of errors, including formal ones, in which one word is replaced with another phonologically related to the intended word; phonemic ones, in which one word is replaced with a nonword phonologically related to the intended word; and approximations, an attempt to find the word without producing either a word or nonword. These types of errors are associated with Wernicke's aphasia, among others. Phonemic paraphasias are often caused by lesions to the external capsule, extending to the posterior part of the temporal lobe or internal capsule. This type of paraphasia also occurs in other languages as well. For example, case studies have been performed with German speakers, which demonstrated that 30.8% of paraphasias occurred at the beginning of the word in patients with Wernicke's aphasia and 22.6% for patients with Broca's aphasia. In English speakers this tendency to create errors at the beginning of the word remained. *Types of phonemic paraphasias **Anticipatory errors occur when a syllable from later in the word replaces a syllable from earlier in the word - \\"papple\\" for apple or \\"lelephone\\" for telephone. **Perseverative errors occur when a syllable from earlier in the word replaces a syllable from later in the word - for example, \\"gingerjed\\" for gingerbread. **Paradigmatic errors based on similarity in how the sounds are formed can also occur - \\"marmer\\" for barber, i.e. **Addition errors, in which a segment is added that bears no relation to the intended word, are much rarer than anticipatory, perseverative, or paradigmatic errors, though they do occur. Most often what can be mistaken for an addition error is an anticipatory error from the words surrounding the intended one. However, an example of a possible addition error could be \\"selezant\\" for elephant. **Substitution errors involve a clear phonological substitution, such as \\"ragon\\" for wagon. **Epenthetic errors are the insertion of a segment into the target, as in the case of \\"plants\\" for pants. **Finally, metathetical errors are the full exchange of segments like \\"deks\\" for desk. =Neologistic paraphasia= Neologistic paraphasias, a substitution with a non-English or gibberish word, follow pauses indicating word-finding difficulty. They can affect any part of speech, and the previously mentioned pause can be used to indicate the relative severity of the neologism; less severe neologistic paraphasias can be recognized as a distortion of a real word, and more severe ones cannot. The hypothesized source for these neologisms is ‚Äúa device which quasirandomly combines English phonemes in a phonotactically regular way.‚Äù A neologistic paraphasia can be thought of as a neologism resulting from aphasia, rather than any other of the sources with which they are associated. Neologistic paraphasia is often associated with receptive aphasia and jargon aphasia. *Types of Neologistic paraphasias **There are also various types of neologistic paraphasias. They can be phonologically related to a prior word, a following word, the intended word, or another neologism. The neologistic paraphasia shares phonemes or the position of phonemes with the related word. This most often occurs when the word and neologistic paraphasia are in the same clause. Neologistic paraphasias have a less stringent relationship with the target word than phonological paraphasias - where a phonological paraphasia has more than half of the target word‚Äôs phonemes, a neologistic paraphasia has less than half. =Verbal paraphasia= Verbal paraphasias are confusions of words or the replacement of one word by another real word; another definition is that of a contextually inappropriate English word or an English word of a syntactically incorrect class - the wrong part of speech, for example. Verbal paraphasias do not often preserve length, although the gender of the target word was preserved in more than half of the errors in one case study. It is hypothesized that verbal paraphasias are not the result of a random process but from a precise deficit in a single area. Verbal paraphasias are the only type of paraphasias that can also be linked to nonfluent aphasias, and they are mainly caused by lesions to the posterior temporal region of the brain, the head of the caudate nucleus, or both. *Examples **These errors can be semantic, in which the meaning of the word is related to that of the intended word (car for van, for example). Semantic paraphasias can be further subdivided into six different types. ***Coordinate semantic paraphasias replace the target word with one that is from the same category, such as tiger for lion. ***Associate semantic paraphasias replace the target word with one that is related to the target but is not of the same category, like replacing foot with shoe. ***Superordinate semantic paraphasias replace a specific target word with a more generalized group to which the target word involves, such as replacing pear with fruit. ***Subordinate semantic paraphasias are the opposite of superordinate semantic paraphasias and replace the target word with one that is more specific - rose, for flower, for example. ***Part-whole semantic paraphasias replace the \\"whole\\" with the \\"part\\" as in finger for hand; or, conversely, the part with the whole, in the case of leg for foot. ***Finally, a visual semantic paraphasia replaces the target word with a word that shares visual features with the target, such as knife for nail. **Random errors, in which the word has no relation to the target, also occur. =Perseverative paraphasia= Perseverative paraphasia is a type of paraphasia in which the previous response persists and interferes with retrieval of new responses. (See the experimental case study D.L.A published by Dennis in 1976.) It is associated with lesions in the left caudate nucleus. Treatment Many language impairments, including paraphasic errors, are reduced in number through spontaneous recovery of neurological function; this occurs most often with stroke patients within the first three months of recovery. Lesions associated with ischemic strokes have a shorter spontaneous recovery time, within the first two weeks, and lesions associated with hemorrhagic strokes, on the other hand have a longer period for spontaneous recovery, four to eight weeks. Whether spontaneous recovery occurs or not, treatment must begin immediately after the stroke, with support from a Speech and Language Therapist or Pathologist. A traditional approach requires treatment beginning at the level of breakdown - in the case of paraphasia, at the level of the phoneme. There are commercially available workbooks that provide various activities such as letter, word-picture, or word-word matching, and sentence completion, among other things. The difficulty of these activities varies with the level of treatment. However, these treatments have not been proven to be clinically productive. Functional magnetic resonance imaging is the most widely used technique to study treatment-induced recovery, looking at activation of particular areas of the brain. There are many different ways to process fMRI scans, beginning with the pre-scanning process. Data must be normalized. There is also no consensus on whether or not single subject scans are more helpful than group scans to determine a general pattern of treatment.Meinzer M, Beeson PM, Cappa S, Crinion J, Kiran S, et al. 2012. Neuroimaging in aphasia treatment research: Consensus and practical guidelines for data analysis. NeuroImage However, fMRI scans have a few disadvantages. A 1988 study by Mary Boyle proposed a method focused on oral reading to treat phonemic paraphasias was partially successful, resulting in fewer phonemic paraphasias but a slower rate of speech. Treatments lasted for 50 minutes and occurred once a week. During these treatment sessions, the patient was instructed to look at twenty different phrases -each of these phrases consisted of one to three syllables - then read the phrase. If the patient failed to read the phrase, the process was repeated. If the patient failed to read the phrase again, the process was abandoned. To progress from a set of one syllable phrases to two syllable phrases and two syllable phrases to three syllable phrases, an 80% success rate was necessary. This treatment was partially successful. Although fewer phonemic paraphasias were produced due to this treatment, speaking efficiency was not improved by this study. This is partially because the focus of the treatment was on sound production rather than semantic content. Improvements lasted for six weeks before the patient regressed.Boyle M. 1988. Reducing Phonemic Paraphasias in the Connected Speech of a Conduction Aphasic Subject. In Clinical Aphasiology Conference, pp. 379-93. Cape Cod, MA Experimental (magnetic-stimulation-induced) paraphasias Transient paraphasias (as well as other language defects such as speech arrest) can be generated by artificially activating the brain's language network with Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). With navigated TMS (nTMS), nodes of the language network can be located presurgically so that critical areas can be saved when performing tumor or epilepsy surgery.T. Picht, S. M. Krieg, N. Sollmann, J. R√∂sler, B. Niraula, T. Neuvonen, P. Savolainen, P. Lioumis, Pantelis, J. P. M√§kel√§, V. Deletis, B. Meyer, P. Vajkoczy, and F.

Life and career Koller was born in Glonn in Bavaria. He enlisted in the army in 1914 and, after infantry service, transferred to aviation. He passed pilot training in 1916 and flew in observation and fighter squadrons, being captured by the British in May 1918. Following release in 1919 he served in various police capacities, shifting to the Luftwaffe in 1935. An exemplary officer, in 1936 Koller graduated valedictorian at the Air War Academy.Nielsen, 41 He was the Chief of Staff for Hugo Sperrle during the Blitz. For Operation Sea Lion, the planned invasion of the United Kingdom by the Wehrmacht, Oberstleutnant Koller was to serve as the Operations Officer of Luftflotte 3, in coordination with the German 9th Army. Koller became the Chef der Luftwaffenf√ºhrungsstabes (\\"Chief of the Luftwaffe Operations Staff\\") in October 1943, which essentially made him as assistant to the General Staff. Dissatisfied with Hermann G√∂ring's leadership of the Luftwaffe, Adolf Hitler wanted to replace him with Robert Ritter von Greim.Read, 853 Unable to convince Greim to accept the role, Hitler forced G√∂ring to sack the Chef des Generalstabs der Luftwaffe (\\"Chief of the General Staff of the Luftwaffe\\"), Generalleutnant Werner Kreipe, and provisionally replace him on September 19, 1944 with the stolid Koller, who was officially assigned the position on November 12.Nielsen, 40 However, Koller was unable to reform the Luftwaffe, which had been mismanaged by G√∂ring and had lost air superiority over the skies of Europe.Nielsen, 130 Koller explained the problem the Luftwaffe had dealing with the other service branches: > In June 1944, in order to counter the many recent attacks on Luftwaffe > policy, I took advantage of a small conference at the Obersalzberg to point > out the weakness of Luftwaffe armament resources, and voiced my feeling that > the Armed Forces High Command, which ought to have supported the Luftwaffe > armament program in the interests of the Armed Forces and the nation as a > whole, had limited itself to negative criticism. I stated frankly that our > top military leaders had simply neglected their duty in this connection. > And with this I had stumbled into a wasps' nest! They refused to consider my > arguments and tried to persuade me that G√∂ring would not have countenanced > any participation by the Armed Forces High Command in the affairs of the > Luftwaffe, that he would have termed it interference and forbidden it. There > can be no doubt of the inaccuracy of this contention. To be sure, G√∂ring was > not a man to countenance interference, but he certainly would have welcomed > constructive support and assistance from the Armed Forces High Command in > improving the Luftwaffe's armament situation.Nielsen, 136 Although Koller supported G√∂ring against the Heer and the Kriegsmarine, he was one of G√∂ring's harshest critics, writing that \\"one had the feeling that he [G√∂ring] had no interest in bringing about an atmosphere of smooth cooperation, that he was almost afraid that this would lead to the establishment of a phalanx against himself.Suchenwirth, 152 Koller was in Adolf Hitler's F√ºhrerbunker in Berlin on April 20, 1945 to attend the dictator's final birthday.Shirer, 1443 Although several high-ranking leaders abandoned the city that night, Koller remained behind to represent the Luftwaffe in nearby Werder (Havel); G√∂ring did not acknowledge the Chief of Staff's salute as he left.Read, 894 Koller was represented within the bunker by General Eckhard Christian. Hitler ordered Koller to send his remaining planes and airmen to assist in Felix Steiner's relief of Berlin, explaining, \\"Any commander who holds back his forces will forfeit his life in five hours. You yourself will guarantee with your head that the last man is thrown in\\".Shirer, 1444 With few troops remaining to him, Steiner was unable to come to the city's defense. After Alfred Jodl told Koller that Hitler had decided to commit suicide, the Luftwaffe general flew to Obersalzberg at 3:30 a.m. on April 23 to inform G√∂ring in person.Shirer, 1448 In the ensuing power struggle between the Nazi leaders as Hitler's mental state declined, Martin Bormann sent SS troops to place G√∂ring, Koller, and Hans Lammers under house arrest at Obersalzberg. G√∂ring was able to dissuade the SS men from their mission and travel with him to his castle at Mauterndorf.Read 902 Koller, who was free at Berchtesgaden, convinced G√∂ring to meet him at Castle Fischhorn at Zell am See,Read 917 where American forces took them into custody on May 7. Post- war After the war ended, Koller was imprisoned by the British at Oxford; Charles Lindbergh visited him during this time. Koller was released in December 1947 and returned to Bavaria. In 1949 he published his wartime shorthand diary as the memoir Der letzte Monat (The Last Month, Mannheim), which provided information about Hitler's last days during the Battle of Berlin. Koller also served as the chairman of the Verband Deutscher Soldaten in Bayern. He died in his hometown of Glonn.

The current minister is The Revd Nigel Uden. the church building is temporarily closed for major building works, with regular worship taking place in Westminster College, Cambridge until the building works are complete. In the recent past prior to the merger of the two congregations, activities have included regular Sunday worship, a programme of music concerts, hosting an NHS group therapy centre and hosting a night-time drop in centre, and a night-time drop-in centre hosted by Cambridge Street Pastors. The refurbishment has been designed to facilitate similar activities are once the current refurbishment programme is complete. The pre-merger congregations both existed prior to the foundation of the United Reformed Church: Emmanuel was originally known as Hog Hill Independent Church, later becoming Emmanuel Congregational Chapel and then Emmanuel Congregational Church; St Columba's was known as St Columba's Presbyterian Church.

From left to right: Henry Barrow, John Greenwood, Oliver Cromwell, John Milton, Francis Holcroft and Joseph Hussey Historically a congregational church, Emmanuel voted to join the new United Reformed Church in 1972. Prior to the 2018 merger, Emmanuel United Reformed Church had been known by different names over the years, first as the 'Hog Hill Independent Church' and then the 'Emmanuel Congregational Chapel' or 'Emmanuel Congregational Church'. The Emmanuel congregation was founded as the Cambridge 'Great Meeting' in 1687, at Hog Hill, the original building being there, on what is now the Old Music School in Downing Place. From 1691 the minister was Joseph Hussey; he was commemorated in the stained glass in the apse of the former Emmanuel United Reformed Church building alongside John Greenwood, Henry Barrow, Oliver Cromwell, John Milton and Francis Holcroft. Hussey's congregation split in 1696, with some going to the meeting in Green Street, Cambridge, and again after he had left for London, in 1721, with a group founding the precursor of St Andrew's Street Baptist Church, Cambridge. The church was rebuilt on the same site in the later 18th century, opening as Emmanuel Congregational Chapel in 1790.City of Cambridge, vol.2 p.302 (1959), Royal Commission of Ancient Monuments The move to the new church on Trumpington Street, called the Emmanuel Congregational Church, came in 1874. The old chapel was put to use from 1881 as the Balfour Biological Laboratory for Women, for female science students in the University of Cambridge. Prior to September 2020, Emmanuel United Reformed Church occupied a building on Trumpington Street, Cambridge. It was built to a design by the architect James Cubitt in 1875. The building was sold to Pembroke College to form part of the college's Mill Lane development project. In the years leading up to the merger, Emmanuel organised regular Sunday worship and a programme of community activities in the recent past: a volunteer-staffed fairtrade cafe, a series of lunchtime music recitals and a share in Hope Cambridge's Churches Homeless Project. =St Columba's United Reformed Church= St Columba's was historically a Presbyterian church. A Presbyterian congregation first registered in Cambridge 1689, at that time based in Green Street. The congregation of St Columba's was formally established in 1881, initially worshipping in Cambridge Guildhall. As of 1891, the present-day building on Downing Place had been built. In the years leading up to the merger, St Columba's, the church's programme included regular Sunday worship, hosting an NHS group therapy centre and a night-time drop-in centre hosted by Cambridge Street Pastors. =Merger to form Downing Place United Reformed Church= In 2018, St Columba's United Reformed Church and Emmanuel United Reformed Church merged to form Downing Place United Reformed Church. The combined congregation occupies the former St Columba's building in Downing Place. (The former Emmanuel building was sold to Pembroke College, Cambridge across the road in Trumpington Street, who intended to retain it as a lecture and performance area as part of their Mill Lane redevelopment. The merged congregation retained the use of the church building for a short period. The final service in the Emmanuel building took place on Sunday 26 July 2020 and all activities at Trumpington Street have now ceased. =People= Former ministers have included: * 1738‚Äì1754 John Conder * 1767‚Äì1788 Joseph Saunders * 1806‚Äì1817 William Harris * 1848‚Äì1854 George Burder Bubier (The most relevant text is on pp. 246-247.) * 1859‚Äì1865 Thomas Campbell Finlayson * 1871‚Äì1872 James Ward * 1894‚Äì1901 P.

He is known for the Malliavin calculus, an infinite dimensional calculus for functionals on the Wiener space and his probabilistic proof of H√∂rmander's theorem. He was Professor at the Pierre and Marie Curie University and a member of the French Academy of Sciences from 1979 to 2010. Scientific contributions Malliavin's early work was in harmonic analysis, where he derived important results on the spectral synthesis problem, providing definitive answers to fundamental questions in this field, including a complete characterization of 'band-limited' functions whose Fourier transform has compact support, known as the Beurling-Malliavin theorem. In stochastic analysis, Malliavin is known for his work on the Malliavin calculus, a theory which has found many applications in Monte Carlo simulation and mathematical finance. As stated by mathematician D. Stroock: \\"Like Norbert Wiener, Paul Malliavin came to probability theory from harmonic analysis, and, like Wiener, his analytic origins were apparent in everything he did there.\\" Malliavin introduced a differential operator on Wiener space, now called the Malliavin derivative, and derived an integration by parts formula for Wiener functionals. Using this integration by parts formula, Malliavin initiated a probabilistic approach to H√∂rmander's theorem for hypo-elliptic operators and gave a condition for the existence of smooth densities for Wiener functionals in terms of their Malliavin covariance matrix.

Although great hopes of mineral traffic drove the original construction of the line, these failed to materialise and after a quiet existence carrying local passengers and agricultural produce, the line closed in 1952. Planning and construction =First railways to Dorchester and Weymouth= The Southampton and Dorchester Railway opened its line to Dorchester on 1 June 1847. The Company was friendly to the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) so Dorchester had a direct connection to London over that line. At the time there was intense rivalry between the LSWR and its allies, and the Great Western Railway (GWR) and its associated companies. Because the track gauges of the two groups were different, the competition was characterised as the gauge wars; the GWR used the broad gauge and the LSWR used the narrow gauge, which later became known as standard gauge.R A Williams, The London & South Western Railway, Volume 1: The Formative Years, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1968, E T MacDermot, History of the Great Western Railway, volume I part 1, published by the Great Western railway, London, 1927 The Southampton and Dorchester line had been planned as the first stage of a line via Bridport to Exeter, but that intention was not implemented. The Southampton and Dorchester Railway was taken over by the LSWR on 22 July 1848.J G Cox, Castleman's Corkscrew: The Southampton and Dorchester Railway 1844 - 1848, published by the City of Southampton, 1975 The GWR planned a line to reach Weymouth, and it promoted a nominally independent company, the Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth Railway, which started construction from near Chippenham. It was taken over by the GWR on 14 March 1850, but progress in building towards Weymouth was slow; it finally reached the town via Yeovil and Dorchester, on 20 January 1857. The line had a separate station at Dorchester, and a connecting link was made to the Southampton and Dorchester (now LSWR) line. The GWR was required by the terms of its authorising Act of Parliament to give running powers to the LSWR over the line from Dorchester to Weymouth, and \\"mixed gauge\\" track, that is track with rails both for broad gauge trains and narrow gauge trains, was provided. The line passed through difficult terrain, and there were steep gradients and a tunnel. There was public demand for a station serving Upwey and Broadwey, and the GWR agreed to provide one if local subscriptions reached ¬£150 toward the cost. This was done and the station opened at Upwey,Opening notices published by the GWR and reproduced in Jackson incorrectly spell the name Upway. on the north side of what is now Old Station Road on 21 June 1871.Brian L Jackson, The Abbotsbury Branch, Wild Swan Publications Ltd, Didcot, 1989, The broad gauge system of the GWR posed difficulties in arranging through traffic to other lines, as goods had to be transshipped and passengers were faced with a change of train. The Directors decided to alter the track gauge and in a huge operation, the lines of the former Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth network were converted in June 1874. The Dorchester - Weymouth section was already mixed, of course, so that all that was needed was to remove the broad gauge rails. =Getting Parliamentary authorisation= In the 1873 session of Parliament, a Bill was presented in Parliament for a line from the west end of Upwey station on the GWR to Portesham and Abbotsbury. Exploitation of mineral deposits, limestone, iron ore and oil-bearing shale, seems to have been the motivation. The Bill was opposed by Henry Fox-Strangways, 5th Earl of Ilchester who owned substantial property in the area, and the scheme was thrown out. Four years later the Earl had been mollified, for another Bill was presented, which he did not oppose, and the scheme obtained the Royal Assent on 6 August 1877, capital ¬£54,000. The engineer was William Clarke. Having obtained authority to raise the money, the task now was to actually get it, and a series of meetings were held at which rosy pictures of future prosperity were held out; indeed the iron ore alone made Abbotsbury capable of becoming a second Middlesbrough. =Money shortage and other problems= Two practical problems emerged in 1878 over the route of the line. The first was that the plans deposited for the Act of Parliament showed a junction at Upwey aligned towards Dorchester. In view of the steep upward gradient of the main line there, which was in any case well above the level of the approach from Abbotsbury, this made the junction impracticable. The second was that speculators had purchased the land required fore the line and sliced it up in such a way that the railway would have to buy unnecessarily large areas of land at high prices. The latter difficulty induced the Directors to consult with the GWR, after which they decided to alter the junction so as to face Weymouth. The first sod had been cut immediately prior to 8 April 1879, and work proceeded; the contractor was Monk & Edwards of Chester. However shortage of subscribed capital was a continuing problem, and in October the Company failed to pay Monk & Edwards moneys due to them; a hasty compromise was reached and work continued. An extraordinary general meeting took place on 13 February 1880, at which it was asserted that the construction of the Weymouth- facing junction at Upwey was outside the Company's powers. The defensive explanation of the Directors makes it clear that this was the case, and the meeting was asked to approve the change, and to approve a new Parliamentary Bill to authorise it. However shortage of money was still the pressing problem, and Monk & Edwards were unable to continue the work without it, and in October 1880 they took legal action against the Company to recover sums due to them: over ¬£10,000, they claimed. A company without funds and with a judgment against it for default on paying its contractor was obviously going to find it difficult to resume construction work; and so it proved. A small series of apparently willing contractors were found, only for them to leave the negotiation at the last minute, until a deal was struck with Green and Burleigh, a London company, were prepare to complete the work \\"for the remainder of the shares and debentures\\".They would receive all the unissued shares in the Company in payment, and would be creditors for the full authorised amount of the debenture loan, one third of the value of the share capital. In fact Green and Burleigh owned ¬£32,770 face value of shares and the general public ¬£21,230.Jackson, page 16 The Company had by now, on 19 May 1882, obtained a further Act of Parliament authorising the altered junction arrangement at Upwey, and to issue ¬£10,000 in preference shares and an additional ¬£3,000 of debenture loan. On 8 February 1883 the Great Western Railway had agreed to work the line for 50% of gross receipts. Having only secured subscribed capital of 39% of the authorised value from the public when the line captured local imagination, it was clearly impossible to issue the preference shares now that the line was in financial trouble, and an approach was made to the Great Western Railway to take the shares. In April 1884 it was reported that Green and Burleigh were not progressing the work as fast as was hoped, and the Directors write to them, expressing their disappointment. At this time there were still 20 parcels of land required for the construction and not yet acquired. On 5 September 1884 it was reported that construction work was at a standstill; Mr Burleigh had failed to attend the last four meetings. A notice was sent to him stating that the works would be put in the hands of another contractor unless he resumed the work immediately. Green and Burleigh were the majority shareholder, of course. It may be surmised that Green and Burleigh themselves were financially embarrassed, for at a meeting on 7 October 1884 Burleigh introduced a Mr George Barclay Bruce, who undertook to complete the works, taking over all the shares allocated to Green and Burleigh; this arrangement was formalised on 16 December 1884. In fact Burleigh and Green (as the partnership seemed to be styled now) went into liquidation in March 1885. At the Annual General Meeting on 19 March 1885 it was announced that the Great Western Railway had agreed to a loan of ¬£10,000,The original proposal was that the GWR might take the ¬£10,000 of preference shares. Instead a loan guaranteed against those shares was probably a device to overcome legal objections to the GWR becoming a significant shareholder in another railway company. and also to the construction (by them) of an interchange station at \\"Broadwey Junction\\". =Last lap to opening= The half yearly shareholders' meeting on 2 October 1885 was held in Weymouth, and it concluded with a trip to Abbotsbury by train. At last the line was all but complete. Col Rich of the Board of Trade carried out the formal inspection on 28 October 1885. He found the line generally satisfactory, although a large number of minor technical points concerned with the signalling were commented upon. The working arrangement was to be \\"one engine in steam\\" for the time being, until the junction station at Upwey was completed, passenger trains were to run through to Weymouth. The line opened to the public on 9 November 1885. Six miles of railway had taken six years to build, and three men had lost their lives during the construction. At the beginning of 1886 the GWR remitted the first instalment of the Abbotsbury Railway's share of receipts for the half year: ¬£99 12s 8d. The GWR junction station was to be called Broadwey Junction, but it was not ready for opening day, so for a period trains on the branch terminated at the Abbotsbury Railway Broadway station, and onward passengers were conveyed by horse and carriage to Upwey GWR station. On 19 April 1886 the junction station was ready, now to be called Upwey Junction, so that the stations on the line were then: * Upwey Junction: GWR station on the main line, with a platform for branch trains; the junction was a short distance to the south; * Broadway * Portesham * Abbotsbury. The GWR Upwey station was closed on the same day. As it had been built partly from a public subscription, a Mr John Lipscombe wrote to the GWR asking for a refund of the money, but there is no record that it was given. Note: the spellings of Broadwey were very inconsistent, even on official GWR notices, and Ordnance Survey maps of the period used Broadway for the settlement. Broadway station was officially renamed Broadwey on 24 June 1896. The hoped- for boom in extraction of iron ore and other minerals did not happen, but an unexpected rush of day tripper traffic took place in the spring and summer of 1886; on Easter Monday the afternoon train from Weymouth had been formed of two engines and 18 carriages. In the following year, however, the novelty value had worn off and passenger carryings settled down. In 1890 the Directors reported that income for a certain period had amounted to ¬£419 but interest payments on the loans amounted to ¬£907, and the total outstanding debt was ¬£4,609. The initial train service was four passenger trains each way daily except Sunday, and ran through to and from Weymouth. The service timetable for 1889 shows that the goods train is running as a mixed (passenger and goods) train, and there is a new entry: at 4.30 a.m. a \\"Contl. Fish\\" (Continental fish) train ran if required to Weymouth, returning empty. If the train was to run, special arrangements had to be made the afternoon before to ensure that the junction signal box was open and ready. Initially intermediate stations were provided at Upwey and Portesham. Coryates Halt, between the two, was opened in May 1906 as part of a GWR scheme to run railmotors to compete with the rising threat of local buses. There was also a platform used solely for loading milk, at Friar Waddon. Its location is now uncertain. An incline was constructed at Portesham to link local quarries on the hill near the Hardy Monument to the line although the actual traffic from this source proved disappointing. An accident A derailment occurred on 23 January 1894: the 6 p.m. passenger train from Weymouth to Abbotsbury hauled by Armstrong standard good locomotive no 52 running tender first was negotiating the sharp curve between Upwey Junction and Upwey stations. The leading (in the direction of travel) coupled wheels derailed to the right, by the flange climbing the high rail. The Parliamentary plans showed the curve to be 12 chains radius, but there was a short section at 8¬Ω chains. The locomotive class had a relatively long rigid wheelbase, at 15ft 8ins and there was no check rail. The driver was found to be working regular shifts of 14 hours 5 minutes on six days a week, although this was not contributory to the accident. Major Marindin was the Board of Trade inspector and as well as calling attention to the hours of duty, he recommended that the sharpest part of the curve should be eased and relaid \\"with a chair road\\", (the existing track was flat-bottom rail spiked direct to the sleepers); to fit a check-rail and to increase slightly the slackness of gauge; and \\"to work passenger trains on the branch only with tank engines and as far as possible to avoid running six-wheel coupled engines upon it\\".Major Marindin, Accident Report, 28 February 1894 This ban in the meantime left the motive power duties on the line to other designs, notably the 0-4-2T's which ran for many years. The \\"517\\" class gave way to the \\"14xx\\"class which were used for passenger and goods traffic until closure. Steam rail motors ran on the line for a few years but having the same weaknesses here as elsewhere were converted to auto trailers. Towards the end of the line's existence GWR diesel railcars were used to reduce costs. Takeover by the GWR The end of the independent existence of the Abbotsbury Railway came suddenly, when a Board meeting on 19 November 1895 approved the terms of a sale to the GWR. The purchase was formalised on 1 August 1896. The purchase cost the GWR ¬£27,561.Jackson, page 32 Railmotors In 1905 the GWR introduced railmotors, self contained passenger coaches with their own steam power unit, in order to respond to the demand for frequent passenger trains stopping more frequently. Additional halts were opened between Dorchester and Weymouth, served by the new trains. The first train from Weymouth and its return working were operated by railmotors from early June 1905, and there was now a Sunday passenger service, all worked by railmotors. The entire branch train service was worked by railmotors from 1 October 1905. In May 1906 a halt was opened at Coryates, between Portesham and Broadwey. Broadway station had been renamed Broadwey in 1895, and on 1 January 1913 Broadwey station was renamed Upwey, to avoid confusion with Broadway in Worcestershire. Road competition At the end of the first world war many independent operators started to run commercial road services. As well as goods lorries, these included scheduled bus services and coaches for excursions. These facilities were cheaper and more flexible than the railway service, and competition from them hit the railway hard. The decline in income was to become serious. In the summer of 1932 a \\"milk platform\\" was opened on the branch at Friar Waddon, between Upwey and Coryates. Jackson says that it \\"henceforth appeared as a recognised stopping place in the working timetable\\". In fact a 1933 working timetable is reproduced by Jackson, showing only a weekday train to Abbotsbury calling there (at 3.4 p.m.) and a Sundays-only milk train from Portesham to Upwey Junction, calling at 4.21 p.m. (There was no ordinary Sunday train service at this time.) There were dairies close to the line to the north and south. The platform was simply a short timber stage.Jackson, page 62 It does not appear in public timetables, for example Bradshaw July 1938.Bradshaw's July 1938 Railway Guide, David and Charles (Publishers) Limited, Newton Abbot, 1969, Topography The Down direction was from Upwey Junction to Abbotsbury. The physical junction at Upwey Junction was immediately south of the station; the branch line descended steeply from the junction, while the main line continued to climb. The line was falling at 1 in 44 and unfitted goods trains required to stop to pin down brakes. Upwey station was at 0m 35c, and gradients were more moderate from there passing Friar Waddon Milk Platform at 2m 00c and climbing at 1 in 228 and then a short length of 1 in 60 to Coryates Halt, 2m 79c. Continuing then at 1 in 60 rising, the line reached Portesham at 4m 47c. The line then fell with a ruling gradient of 1 in 60 to Abbotsbury at 6m 3c. When the line was first built, a siding ran from the Upwey end of Portesham on the north side of the line, curving north to serve a quarry. It connected with a cable-operated incline to the quarry itself. Although the line was worked on the one engine in steam principle, in the early years there were signal boxes at all the stations. The points were not locked by key on the train staff as was the later custom, and ordinary running signals indicated the lie of the points. From 1904 the signal boxes were abolished and replaced with ground frames. Twentieth century train services As described above steam railmotors were introduced in the area from 1905. This did not displace locomotives completely, and a number of 517 class 0-4-2T locomotives were in use with auto-trailers in the area. Both forms of train were referred to as railmotors and there is some ambiguity about the term; it is likely that both forms of traction co-existed. The goods service declined in volume considerably in the 1920s, and the goods trains were reduced at first to three days a week, and later to mixed trains only. From September 1937 a new series of 0-4-2T was introduced, the 48XX class, and they came to dominate working on the branch. They were renumbered in the 14XX series later, a number sequence that had been used for earlier types of the same wheel arrangement. In February 1936 the first GWR diesel railcar allocation to Weymouth took place, and in due course this type appeared on the Abbotsbury branch. In the summer of 1939 there were seven passenger trains each way daily, and four on Sundays, the latter being worked by the GWR diesel railcars. Final decline and closure Following the Second World War, carryings on the line declined further as road passenger and goods services improved, and it soon became obvious that the life of the line was limited. Despite local protests, the last train ran on 29 November 1952. The short spur from Upwey Junction to Upwey station was retained and Upwey becoming a goods station only, as no facilities for goods existed on the main line. Upwey Junction was renamed Upwey & Broadwey on 1 December 1952. Upwey Goods station closed on 31 December 1961.

The theory is named after Jean Cerf, who initiated it in the late 1960s.  An example  Marston Morse proved that, provided M is compact, any smooth function f\\\\colon M \\\\to \\\\R can be approximated by a Morse function. Thus, for many purposes, one can replace arbitrary functions on M by Morse functions. As a next step, one could ask, 'if you have a one-parameter family of functions which start and end at Morse functions, can you assume the whole family is Morse?' In general, the answer is no. Consider, for example, the one-parameter family of functions on M=\\\\mathbb R given by :f_t(x)=(1/3)x^3-tx. At time t=-1, it has no critical points, but at time t=1, it is a Morse function with two critical points at x=\\\\pm 1. Cerf showed that a one-parameter family of functions between two Morse functions can be approximated by one that is Morse at all but finitely many degenerate times. The degeneracies involve a birth/death transition of critical points, as in the above example when, at t=0, an index 0 and index 1 critical point are created as t increases.  A stratification of an infinite-dimensional space  Returning to the general case where M is a compact manifold, let \\\\operatorname{Morse}(M) denote the space of Morse functions on M, and \\\\operatorname{Func}(M) the space of real-valued smooth functions on M. Morse proved that \\\\operatorname{Morse}(M) \\\\subset \\\\operatorname{Func}(M) is an open and dense subset in the C^\\\\infty topology. For the purposes of intuition, here is an analogy. Think of the Morse functions as the top-dimensional open stratum in a stratification of \\\\operatorname{Func}(M) (we make no claim that such a stratification exists, but suppose one does). Notice that in stratified spaces, the co-dimension 0 open stratum is open and dense. For notational purposes, reverse the conventions for indexing the stratifications in a stratified space, and index the open strata not by their dimension, but by their co-dimension. This is convenient since \\\\operatorname{Func}(M) is infinite-dimensional if M is not a finite set. By assumption, the open co- dimension 0 stratum of \\\\operatorname{Func}(M) is \\\\operatorname{Morse}(M), i.e.: \\\\operatorname{Func}(M)^0=\\\\operatorname{Morse}(M). In a stratified space X, frequently X^0 is disconnected. The essential property of the co-dimension 1 stratum X^1 is that any path in X which starts and ends in X^0 can be approximated by a path that intersects X^1 transversely in finitely many points, and does not intersect X^i for any i>1. Thus Cerf theory is the study of the positive co-dimensional strata of \\\\operatorname{Func}(M), i.e.: \\\\operatorname{Func}(M)^i for i>0. In the case of :f_t(x)=x^3-tx, only for t=0 is the function not Morse, and :f_0(x)=x^3 has a cubic degenerate critical point corresponding to the birth/death transition.  A single time parameter, statement of theorem  The Morse Theorem asserts that if f \\\\colon M \\\\to \\\\mathbb R is a Morse function, then near a critical point p it is conjugate to a function g \\\\colon \\\\mathbb R^n \\\\to \\\\mathbb R of the form :g(x_1,x_2,\\\\dotsc,x_n) = f(p) + \\\\epsilon_1 x_1^2 + \\\\epsilon_2 x_2^2 + \\\\dotsb + \\\\epsilon_n x_n^2 where \\\\epsilon_i \\\\in \\\\\\\\{\\\\pm 1\\\\\\\\}. Cerf's one-parameter theorem asserts the essential property of the co-dimension one stratum. Precisely, if f_t \\\\colon M \\\\to \\\\mathbb R is a one-parameter family of smooth functions on M with t \\\\in [0,1], and f_0, f_1 Morse, then there exists a smooth one-parameter family F_t \\\\colon M \\\\to \\\\mathbb R such that F_0 = f_0, F_1 = f_1, F is uniformly close to f in the C^k-topology on functions M \\\\times [0,1] \\\\to \\\\mathbb R. Moreover, F_t is Morse at all but finitely many times. At a non-Morse time the function has only one degenerate critical point p, and near that point the family F_t is conjugate to the family :g_t(x_1,x_2,\\\\dotsc,x_n) = f(p) + x_1^3+\\\\epsilon_1 tx_1 + \\\\epsilon_2 x_2^2 + \\\\dotsb + \\\\epsilon_n x_n^2 where \\\\epsilon_i \\\\in \\\\\\\\{\\\\pm 1\\\\\\\\}, t \\\\in [-1,1]. If \\\\epsilon_1 = -1 this is a one-parameter family of functions where two critical points are created (as t increases), and for \\\\epsilon_1 = 1 it is a one- parameter family of functions where two critical points are destroyed.  Origins  The PL-Schoenflies problem for S^2 \\\\subset \\\\R^3 was solved by J. W. Alexander in 1924. His proof was adapted to the smooth case by Morse and Emilio Baiada. The essential property was used by Cerf in order to prove that every orientation-preserving diffeomorphism of S^3 is isotopic to the identity, seen as a one-parameter extension of the Schoenflies theorem for S^2 \\\\subset \\\\R^3. The corollary \\\\Gamma_4 = 0 at the time had wide implications in differential topology. The essential property was later used by Cerf to prove the pseudo-isotopy theorem for high-dimensional simply-connected manifolds. The proof is a one-parameter extension of Stephen Smale's proof of the h-cobordism theorem (the rewriting of Smale's proof into the functional framework was done by Morse, and also by John MilnorJohn Milnor, Lectures on the h-cobordism theorem, Notes by Laurent C. Siebenmann and Jonathan Sondow, Princeton Math.

Cerf's proof is built on the work of Thom and John Mather.John N. Mather, Classification of stable germs by R-algebras, Publications Math√©matiques de l'IH√âS (1969) A useful modern summary of Thom and Mather's work from that period is the book of Marty Golubitsky and Victor Guillemin.Marty Golubitsky, Victor Guillemin, Stable Mappings and Their Singularities. Springer-Verlag Graduate Texts in Mathematics 14 (1973)  Applications  Beside the above-mentioned applications, Robion Kirby used Cerf Theory as a key step in justifying the Kirby calculus.  Generalization  A stratification of the complement of an infinite co-dimension subspace of the space of smooth maps \\\\\\\\{ f \\\\colon M \\\\to \\\\R \\\\\\\\} was eventually developed by Francis Sergeraert.

As well as being the natural course for the Russian Empire to take upon the declaration of war on the German Empire, it was also an attempt to focus the German Army on the Eastern Front, as opposed to the Western Front. Despite having an overwhelming superiority over the Germans in numbers, the invading Imperial Russian Army spread its forces thin and was defeated in the battles of Tannenberg and the Masurian Lakes. German planning German strategy vis-√†-vis Russia was defensive from 1888 onward, when the Chief of the German General Staff, Helmuth von Moltke, abandoned the concept of a decisive offensive into Russian territory and began to consider defensive options. According to German intelligence estimates, the railway network in Poland limited the Russians to three options: a purely defensive posture against Germany, an offensive down the Vistula straight towards Berlin or an invasion of East Prussia with two armies, one from the Narew and one from the Neman. French political pressure blocked the first option, while the second option was militarily unsound, leaving the third option as the most likely Russian course of action. In 1894 Alfred von Schlieffen, then Chief of the General Staff, war-gamed a scenario that corresponded to the Battle of Tannenberg in 1914. With the Russian Niemen army having overrun half of East Prussia, the German commander in the exercise exploited the separation between the Russian Narew and Niemen armies to mass his troops against the right flank of the Narew army and destroy the whole force. In the exercise critique Schlieffen said the Germans could easily just establish a defensive line behind the Vistula, but when the opportunity to destroy an entire Russian army was available, it should be taken. Whereas Schlieffen's predecessor's Alfred von Waldersee's idea had been to launch a spoiling attack on the Russians as they deployed and then wait for reinforcements from the west, Schlieffen foresaw a mobile operation on interior lines using railways to mass forces against one Russian army and destroy it before it could retreat. As a result, every German general staff officer in East Prussia in 1914 knew how to respond to the Russian offensive. Comparison of strength The invasion was led by two Russian armies: the First Army, which was commanded by General Paul von Rennenkampf and consisted of 6.5 infantry divisions, 5.5 cavalry divisions and 500 guns, and the Second Army under the command of General Alexander Samsonov, composed of 11 infantry divisions, 3 cavalry divisions and 720 guns. They were confronted by the German Eighth Army, commanded by General Maximilian von Prittwitz and consisting of 14.5 infantry divisions, 1 cavalry division and 1000 guns.–ú–µ—Ä–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤ –ê., –°–ø–µ–∫—Ç–æ—Ä –ê., –î–æ—Ä–æ—à–∫–µ–≤–∏—á –û., –õ–∏–∫—Å–æ –í. –ü–æ–ª–Ω–∞—è —ç–Ω—Ü–∏–∫–ª–æ–ø–µ–¥–∏—è. –ü–µ—Ä–≤–∞—è –º–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—è –≤–æ–π–Ω–∞ (1914-1918), –ê–°–¢, 2014, .

P. 40 Battle However, quite quickly, Russia was able to mobilize an invasion into East Prussia. Any invasion of Prussia was an important blow to German morale as well as her general strategic situation, due to Prussia (including East Prussia) being the historical heart of the German Reich (Empire). The German deployment on the outbreak of the war left only the 10 divisions of the German Eighth Army under General Maximilian von Prittwitz in East Prussia whereas the Russians had been able to mobilize the First Army, under General Paul von Rennenkampf and the Second Army, under General Alexander Samsonov. They entered East Prussia on 7‚Äì9 August. The Battle of Stallup√∂nen, fought between Russian and German armies on 17 August, was the opening battle of World War I on the Eastern Front. It was a minor German success, but did little to upset the Russian timetables. The Battle of Gumbinnen, started by the Germans on 20 August, was the first major offensive on the Eastern Front during the First World War. Due to the hastiness of the German attack the Russian army emerged victorious. The Germans were forced to retreat, perhaps with the intention of performing holding actions in Masuria, or even retreating to the Vistula River which would have meant abandoning the salient of East Prussia. This would have fitted in with the plans made before the start of the First World War; that these were the positions the Germans would retreat to if the Russians put up a much stronger fight than they had anticipated. Regardless of whatever preparations had been made, however, it still remained that the Germans could not let the Prussian capital K√∂nigsberg fall into Russian hands. The moral, symbolic and military value (since it was a major military hub) of the city meant to lose it was to invite disaster on the home front, in addition to the strategic ramifications. Also, it was very likely that the Russians would have used the upper hand thus gained to use their superior forces to overwhelm the static German defenses. In short, the Germans had to fight back immediately and force the Russians from East Prussia. Helmuth von Moltke the Younger, Chief of the German General Staff from 1906 to 1914 replaced Prittwitz with Paul von Hindenburg (brought out of retirement) on 22 August. Hindenburg, along with his Chief of Staff, the formidable Ludendorff would approach the crisis in East Prussia very differently from Prittwitz, who panicked when the Russian onslaught entered East Prussia. In contrast to Prittwitz, Hindenburg and Ludendorff decided to take the offensive and encircle one of the opposing armies. Following the plans of Colonel Max Hoffmann, Prittwitz's deputy chief of operations, they chose to send eight divisions against Samsonov in the Battle of Tannenberg resulting in over 90,000 captured and 70,000 killed or wounded. The Second Army was destroyed and Samsonov shot himself. In the Battle of the Masurian Lakes, the Germans forced the First Army to retreat out of East Prussia. The invasion was a ghastly failure for the Russians, a setback which was followed by considerable German advances in the following year, including the capture of the Polish city of Warsaw. However, the crisis caused in the German High Command by the unexpected Russian advance forced the sending of 2 corps and a cavalry division from the Western Front as part of the new 9th Army in order to support the attack on the Russians. These additional forces did not arrive in time for the twin battles as Ludendorff predicted and, had they entered France as originally planned, could have been tremendously helpful to the precarious situation in the West. In the head of French Intelligence Colonel Dupont's words, \\"their debacle was one of the elements of our victory.\\" Casualty estimates vary in different sources, from 37,000 to about 100,000 for the Germans and about 300,000, of which 100,000 were prisoners of war, for the Russians.

Also known as the bristled grass warbler, this species is endemic to the Indian subcontinent, where it is patchily distributed in Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan. These insectivorous birds skulk in dense and tall grasslands, often in marshy areas, habitats that are threatened by human activities. Formerly considered to be sedentary, the species may be migratory, moving south and east in the Indian peninsula during winter and returning to their breeding grounds in the northern plains south of the Himalayas. Description Bristled Grassbird (at Dadri) This warbler is large and brownish with broad dark streaks to the feathers of the crown and back and can appear almost babbler-like in appearance (easily mistaken for common babbler). The tail is graduated with white tips to the feathers. The rachis of the tail feathers is dark and there are dark ribs to the feathers. The bill is strong. The tarsus is brown and the bill is black with the lower mandible tipped bluish grey. They have a buff supercilium (brow) and have a pale unmarked underside. This species was included in the \\"Old World warbler\\" family Sylviidae, in the genus Chaetornis but more comprehensive studies on external morphology and DNA sequence studies, have led to its placement in the grass warbler family Locustellidae as a sister species of Schoenicola platyurus in the genus Schoenicola. The bristles are thought to protect the eyes when they forage through dense grass. This genus in the warbler family is distinctive in having a bare patch of skin in front of the eyes (the lores) on which a vertical row of five stiff rictal bristles arise and face forward. The bare skin is flexible and it is thought that the bristles provide protection to the eye as the bird scampers between the dense and rough grass by folding back and forming a kind of cage or visor over the eye . The feathers on the breast are stiff and in some individuals the tips are dark giving it a necklaced appearance. The sexes are similar in plumage. Distribution and habitat The habitat in which the species occurs is tall grass-covered marshlands. The distribution range is mainly in the northern part of the Indian Subcontinent. Formerly described as common in at least Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Orissa, Lahore (where they bred in the Rakh area parts of Bangladesh, and Nepal. The species is threatened by the destruction of grassland and marshland habitats. The species was thought to be mainly sedentary with movements related to the rains but they may be migratory, breeding along the riverine plains south of the Himalayas and wintering further east and south in the peninsula of India. Behaviour Bristled grassbirds are hard to spot, usually seen briefly at the top of a grass clump but diving in and most often hidden inside grass clumps where they forage for insect prey. Males display by rising above the grass to about a metre or so and zig zag in the air before parachuting back down. They also call in flight with a rising and falling chwee-chew. The breeding season is May to September and the nest is a ball of grass with an opening at the top and placed near the base of a grass clump. The usual clutch is four to five and eggs are thought to be incubated by the female alone. The eggs are white with purplish red speckles.

It was Hornsby's first studio album with his touring band, the Noisemakers, and his last album for RCA Records . The album was Hornsby's most experimental effort to date; the only album on which Hornsby barely plays any piano, it relied heavily on post-electronica beats, drum loops, Pro Tools editing, and dense synthesizer arrangements. The album also boasts a \\"stream-of-consciousness wordplay\\" of lyrics that are in many ways more eccentric and humorous than previous work.

Veratrum lobelianum Bernh) is a poisonous plant of the family Liliaceae or Melanthiaceae. It is native to Europe and parts of western Asia (western Siberia, Turkey, Caucasus). Description Veratrum album is a tall perennial herb with alternate, pleated leaves. The flowers are white, marked with green on the top portion of the stalk. The fruit is a small pod containing winged seeds. The stout, simple stems are tall. The plants have an estimated lifespan of several centuries and often achieve dominance in wild areas as they are unpalatable to grazing herbivores. Uses Protoveratrine AProtoveratrine B Extracts from dried rhizomes of Veratrum album were briefly used as a pesticide against the Colorado potato beetle. =Research= In 1890, Salzberger first isolated and named the alkaloid protoveratrine. Later investigation found that protoveratrine is a mixture of two closely related alkaloids, protoveratrine A and protoveratrine B. During the 1940s and 1950s, Veratrum album was studied in essential hypertension, hypertension during renal dysfunction, and pre- eclampsia. =Horticultural= Veratrum album is grown as an ornamental plant. In the UK It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society‚Äôs Award of Garden Merit.  Toxicity  In beverages, V. album has been mistaken for the harmless yellow gentian (Gentiana lutea) or wild garlic (Allium ursinum), resulting in poisoning. All parts of the plant are poisonous, including its aroma. = Symptoms = Symptoms of Veratrum alkaloid poisoning typically occur within thirty minutes to four hours of ingestion, and include: *vomiting *abdominal pain *hypotension *bradycardia *nausea *drowsiness * dizziness * dilated pupils = Treatment = Treatment for Veratrum alkaloid poisoning include supportive care and symptomatic treatments, such as fluid replacement and anti-emetics. Atropine and vasopressors act to combat bradycardia and hypotension. Duration of illness can last up to ten days but full recovery is possible within a few hours depending on dose and treatment. = Poisonings = Various Veratrum alkaloids were present in a German sneezing powder in 1982, resulting in the accidental poisoning of those who used it. Sneezing powders are commonly used to prank others. In 1983, there were nine cases of accidental poisoning as a result of these pranks due to the presence of Veratrum alkaloids in the sneezing powders. The victims were nine boys aged between 11 and 18 years old in Scandinavian countries who used supplies imported from the Federal Republic of Germany. All boys had inhaled the powder and six had ingested it. Symptoms typically presented within an hour, after which calls were made to authorities. After sneezing, the victims began to develop gastrointestinal disturbances such as vomiting in all cases and epigastric pain in two. Three of the children collapsed due to low blood pressure prior to being admitted to hospital. Seven of the children had significantly decreased blood pressure and five have cases of sinus bradycardia with no other irregularities. Half of those who had ingested the powder were treated with gastric lavage. Four of the boys were given atropine to combat bradycardia and one was given activated charcoal. Atropine normalised their heart rates within minutes but did little to assist with low blood pressure. In all cases, the patients recovered within twenty-four hours. In 2005 and 2008, there were three reported cases of accidental poisoning. In 2009, eleven children, aged 8 to 12 years old, accidentally ingested Veratrum album at a youth camp where they had prepared homemade tea using fresh herbs. Two children remained asymptomatic, nine developed mild gastrointestinal symptoms, six presented neurological symptoms, and three showed bradycardia; after medical care, all children recovered. Four cases of accidental poisoning were reported in 2010 after Veratrum album was mistaken for wild garlic and used in self prepared-salad and soups. All victims developed nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, sinus bradycardia, and hypotension. Complete recovery took between twenty-four and forty-eight hours. = Alexander the Great = A debate amongst historians is centred around the cause of death of Alexander the Great. Some believe the Macedonian king died of natural causes and others believe he was poisoned. The Romance suggests that his inner circle conspired to assassinate him upon his return to Babylon. A theory proposed by Schep in 2013 suggests that Veratrum album was used to kill Alexander the Great. Schep argues that the usual suspects thought to be the culprit, such as arsenic and strychnine, would have acted too quickly to correlate with historical accounts. Alexander was ill for twelve days and suffered symptoms synonymous with Veratrum album poisoning. Notably, the theory is furthered by the proposal that Alexander drank wine poisoned with Veratrum album. Accounts from Diodorus detail that the king was struck with pain after drinking a large bowl of unmixed wine in honor of Hercules. = In vitro mechanism = Sodium ion channel Veratrum album contains over fifty steroidal alkaloids called 'Veratrum alkaloids', including O-acetyljervine, cevadine, cryptenamine, cyclopamine (11-deoxojervine), cycloposine, germitrine, germidine, jervine, muldamine, protoveratrine (A&B;), veratramine, veratridine, and veriloid. Some of the principal toxins have a modified steroid template while others differ in their esterified acid moieties. In general, Veratrum alkaloids act by increasing the permeability of the sodium channels of nerve cells, causing them to fire continuously. Increased stimulation, associated with the vagus nerve, results in the Bezold-Jarisch reflex: hypotension, bradycardia and apnoea. The neurotoxicity of Veratrum alkaloids derives from their effect on the sodium ion channels of nerve cells. They activate receptor site 2 of the voltage-dependent Na+ channel in membranes by prolonging its open state. The alkaloids depolarize nerves by enhancing exchange of Na+ and K+ across the membrane.

It is parasitic on birch and other trees. The sterile conk is irregularly formed and has the appearance of burnt charcoal. It is not the fruiting body of the fungus, but a sclerotium or mass of mycelium, mostly black because of the presence of massive amounts of melanin. Some people consider chaga to be medicinal. I. obliquus is found most commonly in the Circumboreal Region of the Northern Hemisphere, where it is distributed in birch forests.  Morphology  Chaga on a birch tree Chaga in alder Chaga fruiting body from a dead birch tree Birch slices showing the development of chaga I. obliquus causes a white heart rot to develop in the host tree. The chaga spores enter the tree through wounds, particularly poorly healed branch stubs. The white rot decay will spread throughout the heartwood of the host. During the infection cycle, penetration of the sapwood occurs only around the sterile exterior mycelium mass. The chaga fungus will continue to cause decay within the living tree for 10‚Äì80+ years. While the tree is alive, only sterile mycelial masses are produced (the black exterior conk). The sexual stage begins after the tree, or some portion of the tree, is killed by the infection. I. obliquus will begin to produce fertile fruiting bodies underneath the bark. These bodies begin as a whitish mass that turn to brown with time. Since the sexual stage occurs almost entirely under the bark, the fruiting body is rarely seen. These fruiting bodies produce basidiospores which will spread the infection to other vulnerable trees.  Common names  The name chaga ( ) comes from the Russian name of the fungus (transliterated from —á–∞–≥–∞), which in turn is purportedly derived from the word for the fungus in Komi-Permyak, the language of the indigenous peoples in the Kama River Basin, west of the Ural Mountains. It is also known as the clinker polypore (from its resemblance to the slag left after a coal fire, known commonly as \\"clinker\\" when coal fires were common), cinder conk, black mass and birch canker polypore. In England and officially in Canada, it is known as the sterile conk trunk rot of birch. Distribution and cultivation Generally found growing on birch (Betula spp.) trees, it has also been found on alder (Alnus spp.), beech (Fagus spp.), oak (Quercus spp.) and poplar (Populus spp.). In species other than birch, the fungus often appears as buried stem canker, instead of the charcoal-like mass found on birch trees. Attempts at cultivating this fungus on potato dextrose agar and other simulated mediums resulted in a reduced and markedly different production of metabolites. Cultivated chaga developed a reduced number of phytosterols, particularly lanosterol, an intermediate in the synthesis of ergosterol and lanostane-type triterpenes. Chemistry The black sclerotium has been shown to contain large concentrations of melanin. Chaga has been reported to contain extremely high concentrations of oxalate, 2800‚Äì11200 mg total oxalates/100 g sclerotium, one of the highest reported levels of any organism. Preparation Chaga is traditionally grated into a fine powder and used to brew a beverage resembling coffee or tea. However, caution is warranted with chronic use due to the extremely high concentrations of oxalates in chaga. Currently, three extraction processes are used. * Hot water extraction is one of the most common preparations. A decoction is created by simmering pieces of the chaga in numerous quarts of water until the water is reduced and the remaining liquid contains a portion of the chaga's concentrated water-soluble compounds. The √ü-D-glucans may have a content of approximately 35% in a pure extract. * Ethanol or methanol extraction isolates the water-insoluble components, betulinic acid, betulin and the phytosterols. This extraction process is in general used as a second step after hot-water extraction, since ethanol alone will not break down chitin effectively‚Äîheat is essential. * Fermentation is the most time-consuming and most expensive. Because fermentation methods are not standardized (many types of bacteria and fungi can be used in the process), the outcome is also not standardized.

There are several approaches to clustering, most of which do not employ a clustered file system (only direct attached storage for each node). Clustered file systems can provide features like location-independent addressing and redundancy which improve reliability or reduce the complexity of the other parts of the cluster. Parallel file systems are a type of clustered file system that spread data across multiple storage nodes, usually for redundancy or performance. Shared-disk file system A shared-disk file system uses a storage area network (SAN) to allow multiple computers to gain direct disk access at the block level. Access control and translation from file-level operations that applications use to block-level operations used by the SAN must take place on the client node. The most common type of clustered file system, the shared-disk file system --by adding mechanisms for concurrency control--provides a consistent and serializable view of the file system, avoiding corruption and unintended data loss even when multiple clients try to access the same files at the same time. Shared-disk file-systems commonly employ some sort of fencing mechanism to prevent data corruption in case of node failures, because an unfenced device can cause data corruption if it loses communication with its sister nodes and tries to access the same information other nodes are accessing. The underlying storage area network may use any of a number of block-level protocols, including SCSI, iSCSI, HyperSCSI, ATA over Ethernet (AoE), Fibre Channel, network block device, and InfiniBand. There are different architectural approaches to a shared-disk filesystem. Some distribute file information across all the servers in a cluster (fully distributed). =Examples= * Blue Whale Clustered file system (BWFS) * Silicon Graphics (SGI) clustered file system (CXFS) * Veritas Cluster File System * Microsoft Cluster Shared Volumes (CSV) * DataPlow Nasan File System * IBM General Parallel File System (GPFS) * Oracle Cluster File System (OCFS) * OpenVMS Files-11 File System * PolyServe storage solutions * Quantum StorNext File System (SNFS), ex ADIC, ex CentraVision File System (CVFS) * Red Hat Global File System (GFS2) * Sun QFS * TerraScale Technologies TerraFS * Versity VSM * VMware VMFS * WekaFS * Apple Xsan Distributed file systems Distributed file systems do not share block level access to the same storage but use a network protocol. These are commonly known as network file systems, even though they are not the only file systems that use the network to send data. Distributed file systems can restrict access to the file system depending on access lists or capabilities on both the servers and the clients, depending on how the protocol is designed. The difference between a distributed file system and a distributed data store is that a distributed file system allows files to be accessed using the same interfaces and semantics as local files for example, mounting/unmounting, listing directories, read/write at byte boundaries, system's native permission model. Distributed data stores, by contrast, require using a different API or library and have different semantics (most often those of a database). =Design goals= Distributed file systems may aim for \\"transparency\\" in a number of aspects. That is, they aim to be \\"invisible\\" to client programs, which \\"see\\" a system which is similar to a local file system. Behind the scenes, the distributed file system handles locating files, transporting data, and potentially providing other features listed below. * Access transparency: clients are unaware that files are distributed and can access them in the same way as local files are accessed. * Location transparency: a consistent namespace exists encompassing local as well as remote files. The name of a file does not give its location. * Concurrency transparency: all clients have the same view of the state of the file system. This means that if one process is modifying a file, any other processes on the same system or remote systems that are accessing the files will see the modifications in a coherent manner. * Failure transparency: the client and client programs should operate correctly after a server failure. * Heterogeneity: file service should be provided across different hardware and operating system platforms. * Scalability: the file system should work well in small environments (1 machine, a dozen machines) and also scale gracefully to bigger ones (hundreds through tens of thousands of systems). * Replication transparency: Clients should be unaware of the file replication performed across multiple servers to support scalability. * Migration transparency: files should be able to move between different servers without the client's knowledge. =History= The Incompatible Timesharing System used virtual devices for transparent inter-machine file system access in the 1960s. More file servers were developed in the 1970s. In 1976 Digital Equipment Corporation created the File Access Listener (FAL), an implementation of the Data Access Protocol as part of DECnet Phase II which became the first widely used network file system. In 1985 Sun Microsystems created the file system called \\"Network File System\\" (NFS) which became the first widely used Internet Protocol based network file system. Other notable network file systems are Andrew File System (AFS), Apple Filing Protocol (AFP), NetWare Core Protocol (NCP), and Server Message Block (SMB) which is also known as Common Internet File System (CIFS). In 1986, IBM announced client and server support for Distributed Data Management Architecture (DDM) for the System/36, System/38, and IBM mainframe computers running CICS. This was followed by the support for IBM Personal Computer, AS/400, IBM mainframe computers under the MVS and VSE operating systems, and FlexOS. DDM also became the foundation for Distributed Relational Database Architecture, also known as DRDA. There are many peer-to- peer network protocols for open-source distributed file systems for cloud or closed-source clustered file systems, e. g.: 9P, AFS, Coda, CIFS/SMB, DCE/DFS, WekaFS, Lustre, PanFS, Google File System, Mnet, Chord Project. =Examples= * Alluxio * BeeGFS (Fraunhofer) * CephFS (Inktank, Red Hat, SUSE) * Windows Distributed File System (DFS) (Microsoft) * Infinit * GfarmFS * GlusterFS (Red Hat) * GFS (Google Inc.) * HDFS (Apache Software Foundation) * IPFS * iRODS * LizardFS (Skytechnology) * Lustre * MapR FS * MooseFS (Core Technology / Gemius) * ObjectiveFS * OneFS (EMC Isilon) * OpenIO * OrangeFS (Clemson University, Omnibond Systems), formerly Parallel Virtual File System * PanFS (Panasas) * Parallel Virtual File System (Clemson University, Argonne National Laboratory, Ohio Supercomputer Center) * RozoFS (Rozo Systems) * Torus (CoreOS) * WekaFS (WekaIO) * XtreemFS Network-attached storage Network- attached storage (NAS) provides both storage and a file system, like a shared disk file system on top of a storage area network (SAN). NAS typically uses file-based protocols (as opposed to block-based protocols a SAN would use) such as NFS (popular on UNIX systems), SMB/CIFS (Server Message Block/Common Internet File System) (used with MS Windows systems), AFP (used with Apple Macintosh computers), or NCP (used with OES and Novell NetWare). Design considerations =Avoiding single point of failure= The failure of disk hardware or a given storage node in a cluster can create a single point of failure that can result in data loss or unavailability. Fault tolerance and high availability can be provided through data replication of one sort or another, so that data remains intact and available despite the failure of any single piece of equipment. For examples, see the lists of distributed fault- tolerant file systems and distributed parallel fault-tolerant file systems. =Performance= A common performance measurement of a clustered file system is the amount of time needed to satisfy service requests. In conventional systems, this time consists of a disk-access time and a small amount of CPU- processing time. But in a clustered file system, a remote access has additional overhead due to the distributed structure. This includes the time to deliver the request to a server, the time to deliver the response to the client, and for each direction, a CPU overhead of running the communication protocol software. =Concurrency= Concurrency control becomes an issue when more than one person or client is accessing the same file or block and want to update it. Hence updates to the file from one client should not interfere with access and updates from other clients. This problem is more complex with file systems due to concurrent overlapping writes, where different writers write to overlapping regions of the file concurrently.Pessach, Yaniv (2013). Distributed Storage: Concepts, Algorithms, and Implementations. . This problem is usually handled by concurrency control or locking which may either be built into the file system or provided by an add-on protocol. History IBM mainframes in the 1970s could share physical disks and file systems if each machine had its own channel connection to the drives' control units. In the 1980s, Digital Equipment Corporation's TOPS-20 and OpenVMS clusters (VAX/ALPHA/IA64) included shared disk file systems.

It was primarily developed by Michael Hines, John W. Moore, and Ted Carnevale at Yale and Duke. Neuron models individual neurons via the use of sections that are automatically subdivided into individual compartments, instead of requiring the user to manually create compartments. The primary scripting language is hoc but a Python interface is also available. Programs can be written interactively in a shell, or loaded from a file. Neuron supports parallelization via the MPI protocol. Neuron is capable of handling diffusion-reaction models, and integrating diffusion functions into models of synapses and cellular networks. Parallelization is possible via internal multithreaded routines, for use on multi-core computers. The properties of the membrane channels of the neuron are simulated using compiled mechanisms written using the NMODL language or by compiled routines operating on internal data structures that are set up with Channel Builder. Along with the analogous software platform GENESIS, Neuron is the basis for instruction in computational neuroscience in many courses and laboratories around the world.  User interface  Neuron features a graphical user interface (GUI), for use by individuals with minimal programming experience. The GUI comes equipped with a builder for single and multiple compartment cells, networks, network cells, channels and linear electric circuits. Single and multiple compartment cells differ in that multiple compartment cells features several \\"sections\\", each with potentially distinct parameters for dimensions and kinetics. Tutorials are available on the Neuron website, including for getting basic models out of the cell, channel and network builders. With these builders, the user can form the basis of all simulations and models. =Cell Builder= The cell builder menu with the six options visible Cell Builder allows the user to generate and modify stick figure cell structures. These sections form the basis of functionally distinct areas of the neuron. The user can define functionally distinct groups of sections. Sections branching from one another can be labeled \\"dendrites,\\" while another, single section that projects from the same central one can be labeled as the \\"axon.\\" The user can define parameters along which certain values are variable as a function across a section. For instance, path length along a subset can be defined as a domain, the functions along which can then be defined later. The user can select either individual sections, or groups and set precise parameters for length, diameter, area and length for that group or section. Any of these values can be set as a function of length or some other parameter of the corresponding section. The user can set the number of functional segments in a section, which is a strategy for spatial resolution. The higher the number of segments, the more precisely Neuron can handle a function in a section. Segments are the points where point process managers can be associated. Users can define kinetic and electro-physiological functions across both subsets and sections. Neuron comes equipped with a probabilistic model of Hodgkin-Huxley ModelHodgkin-Huxley ionic current characterization giant squid axon kinetics, as well as a function to model passive leak channel kinetics. Both of these functions, and the features they describe, can be added to the membrane of the constructed cell. Values for leak rate, sodium conductance and potassium conductance can be set for modeling these kinetics can be set as functions over a parameterized domain. Channels become available for implementation in a cell membrane. =Channel Builder= The user can generate both voltage- and ligand-gated channel models. Channel Builder supports local point channels, generally used for single, large channels whose function is to be modeled, and general channels whose density across the cell can be defined. Maximum conductance, reversal potential, ligand sensitivity, ion permeability, as well as precise dynamics of transitional states using activation and inactivation variables, and including differential conductance, can be defined. =Network and Network Cell Builder= Neuron allows for the generation of mixed models, populated with both artificial cells and neurons. Artificial cells essentially function as point processes, implemented into the network. Artificial cells require only a point process, with defined parameters. The user can create the structure and dynamics of network cells. The user can create synapses, using simulated synapse point processes as archetypes. Parameters on these point processes can be manipulated to simulate both inhibitory and excitatory responses. Synapses can be placed on specific segments of the constructed cell, wherein, again, they will behave as point processes, except that they are sensitive to the activity of a pre-synaptic element. Cells can be managed. The user creates the basic grid of network cells, taking previously completed network cells as archetypes. Connections can be defined between source cells and target synapses on other cells. The cell containing the target synapse becomes the post-synaptic element, whereas the source cells function as pre- synaptic elements. Weights can be added to define strength of activation of a synapse by the pre-synaptic cell. A plot option can be activated to open a graph of spikes across time for individual neurons. =Simulation and recording= Neuron comes equipped with a slew of simulation tools. Most notably, it includes several \\"point processes,\\" which are simple functions at a particular segment of a cell. Point processes include simulations of voltage, patch, single electrode and current clamps, as well as several simulated synapses. Synapse point processes are distinct for their ability to model stimulation intensities that vary non-linearly across time. These can be placed on any segment of any section of a built cell, individual or network, and their precise values, including amplitude and duration of stimulation, delay time of activation in a run and time decay parameters (for synapses), can be defined from the point process manager module. When implemented into a network as synapses, point process parameters are defined in the synapse builder for a particular network cell.PointProcess documentation Graphs describing voltage, conductance, and current axes over time can be used to describe changes in electrical state at the location of any segment on the cell. Neuron allows for graphs of change at both individual points over time, and across an entire section through time. Duration of run can be set. All point processes, including those standing for cells or synapses of artificial neurons, and all graphs reflect the duration. Examples This example creates a simple cell, with a single compartment soma and a multi compartment axon. It has the dynamics of the cell membrane simulated using Hodgkin-Huxley squid axon kinetics. The simulator stimulates the cell and runs for 50 ms. //create two sections, the body of the neuron and a very long axon create soma, axon soma { //length is set to 100 micrometers L = 100 //diameter is set to 100 micrometers diam = 100 //insert a mechanism simulating the standard squid Hodgkin‚ÄìHuxley channels insert hh //insert a mechanism simulating the passive membrane properties insert pas } axon { L = 5000 diam = 10 insert hh insert pas //the axon shall be simulated using 10 compartments. By default a single compartment is used nseg = 10 } //connect the proximal end of the axon to the distal end of the soma connect axon(0), soma(1) //declare and insert a current clamp into the middle of the soma objref stim soma stim = new IClamp(0.5) //define some parameters of the stimulus: delay, duration (both in ms) and amplitude (in nA) stim.del = 10 stim.dur = 5 stim.amp = 10 //load a default NEURON library file that defines the run routine load_file(\\"stdrun.hoc\\") //set the simulation to run for 50 ms tstop = 50 //run the simulation run() A plot can be generated showing the voltage traces starting from the soma and the distal end of the axon. The action potential at the end of the axon arrives slightly later than it appears in the soma at the point of stimulation. The plot is membrane voltage versus time.

The Groove showcases a new style of small car from General Motors. The mini car was completely designed by GM Daewoo in South Korea. The Groove is powered by a 1.0 L diesel engine that is similar to the one powering the current Chevy Spark, a minicar sold in Asia. The Chevrolet Beat and the Chevrolet Trax were also showcased to provide a vision for future designs in the GM subcompact segment. These three concepts could be voted on after their introduction on a special website. In the end, both the Groove and Trax lost to the Beat, which is slated for production. Both Beat and Trax were eventually green-lit for production. While the Groove was not, design language from it has found its way into the Chevrolet Sonic and Chevrolet Orlando designs.  Nameplate usage  In October 2019, General Motors registered the 'Groove' nameplate in a trademark filing in Uruguay.

Blues Revue said he plays ‚Äújoyous rave-ups‚Ä¶he testifies with stunning soul fervor and powerful guitar. One of the blues‚Äô finest songwriters.‚Äù Early life Harrington was born in Macon, Mississippi, on January 10, 1935. He was raised by his part-Cherokee grandmother in Mississippi. His family moved to Birmingham, Alabama, in 1948. He was a cousin of the blues harmonica player Carey Bell. He began playing guitar at age 13, teaching himself left-handed and upside down. He began performing with gospel groups, including the Five Blind Boys of Alabama. He moved to Chicago in 1950, playing predominantly gospel, and later developed his blues artistry after working with Magic Sam, Otis Rush, and others. Career Clearwater is best known for his activity in the Chicago blues scene since the 1950s. He performed in the US (especially around the Chicago area, where he resides) and internationally, having played at blues festivals in France, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Poland and the Netherlands. His sound has been described as ‚Äúhard- driving Windy City blues, soul-tinged balladry, acoustic country blues and gospel uplift‚Ä¶.good natured fretboard fireworks.‚Äù When he left the South for Chicago in 1950, he worked as a dishwasher while living with an uncle, through whom he met many of Chicago‚Äôs blues masters, including Otis Rush (who also was a left-handed playing the guitar upside down) and Magic Sam. Inspired by the music of Chuck Berry, he began performing some of Berry‚Äôs songs and writing in a style influenced by him. Clearwater still regularly performs songs by Rush, Magic Sam and Berry, as well as original compositions. In 1953, then known as Guitar Eddy, he began working regularly in bars on Chicago‚Äôs South and West Sides. His first single, the Berry-styled ‚ÄúHill Billy Blues‚Äù, was recorded in 1958 for his uncle‚Äôs Atomic H label, under the moniker Clear Waters, a name given to him by his manager, drummer Jump Jackson, as a play on the name of the famous Muddy Waters. He recorded a few more singles, which had some local radio airplay. Eventually the name Clear Waters evolved into Eddy Clearwater. He worked steadily throughout the 1960s and 1970s and was among the first blues musicians to find success with Chicago‚Äôs North Side college audiences. He was a regular Saturday act on the north stage of the blues club Kingston Mines, while bluesman Linsey Alexander played on the south stage. He toured Europe twice during the 1970s and appeared on BBC Television. Clearwater acquired the nickname The Chief and often performed wearing a Native American headdress. The release of his 1980 album, The Chief, on the Rooster Blues label, made him known on the Chicago blues scene. Two encores for Rooster Blues, Help Yourself (1992) and Mean Case of the Blues (1996), cemented Clearwater's reputation. His album Cool Blues Walk was released in 1998, followed by Chicago Daily Blues in 1989 and Reservation Blues in mid-2000.[ Eddy Clearwater]. accessed February 2008. In 2004, he was nominated for a Grammy Award with Los Straitjackets for their collaborative album Rock 'n' Roll City. His album West Side Strut, released by Alligator Records in 2008, was described by Vintage Guitar magazine as ‚Äúgreat blues. Eddy‚Äôs tone shows a masterful command of the guitar. It‚Äôs hard to believe he can reach such heights in a recording studio. One listen and you‚Äôll wonder why Clearwater‚Äôs name isn‚Äôt respectfully spoken in the same breath as Freddie King and Otis Rush.‚Äù Personal life Clearwater in 1978 Clearwater was married to Earlean Harrington of Chicago and was the stepfather of her son Daryl Thompson. Clearwater was married to his manager, Renee Greenman. They owned Reservation Blues, a Wicker Park (Chicago) blues bar and restaurant, in the early 2000s (and no longer in operation). It featured Clearwater regularly as well as local and national blues talent. He fathered two sons, Jason and Edgar. On January 8, 1997, Clearwater underwent successful triple heart bypass surgery. Clearwater's hometown for the last few decades of his life was Skokie, Illinois, a northern suburb of Chicago. Skokie's mayor declared January 6 as Eddy \\"The Chief\\" Clearwater Day. Clearwater died at his home in Skokie on June 1, 2018, of heart failure at the age of 83.

In the year following the emperor's rebuff to the British mission headed by Lord George Macartney, Titsingh and his colleagues were much feted by the Chinese because of what was construed as seemly compliance with conventional court etiquette. The members of the Titsingh mission, including de Guignes, were the last European diplomats to savour the mid-winter splendor of the vast Summer Palace (the Yuangmingyuan, now known as Old Summer Palace) before its destruction by the Lord Elgin's troops during the punitive Second Opium War in 1860.van Braam, An authentic account..., Vol. I (1798 English edition) pp. 283-284.

[Ph.D. dissertation, University of Washington]  Sinologist  In 1808, Napoleon ordered de Guignes to prepare a Chinese-French-Latin dictionary. The work was completed five years later. Shortly after the publication, it was discovered that the dictionary was nothing more than a copy of an older work composed by the Franciscan friar, Basilio Brollo of Gemona (1648‚Äì1704). While de Guignes had altered the original by arranging the characters according to the order of the 214 radicals (as contrasted with Basilio's tone-based order), the dictionary received strong criticism in 1814 from the first person to be appointed to be a professor of Chinese at a European institution of higher learning, Jean- Pierre Abel-R√©musat (1788‚Äì1832).Zurndorfer, Harriet Thelma.

The album was produced by Tim Wheeler, and mixed by Michael Brauer. Production history In 2006, Ash bought the lease for three years for a recording studio in New York City, and decided to record their follow up to 2004's Meltdown here. This album marks the band's first release since returning to its original \\"power trio\\". The songs recorded from this album were intended to have a substantially different sound from the Californian rock of \\"Meltdown\\" and to acquire more of a \\"tight 70s guitar band sound\\", and less of a polished sound that their previous albums had. The band planned to road test their new tracks by \\"playing out and about in tiny New York bars, unannounced, just for fun.\\" By September, the album had the working title of 5.5, due to the band considering the album to be their fifth and a half album. The band were continuing to record demos, with the intention of using 14 or 15 of the demos to record for the album itself. This month the band also played their debut gig since returning to a three, their first in 14 months. The gig was held in New York, at a party by the record producer and DJ Arthur Baker. The band debuted two new tracks at the party: \\"What Is the Meaning?\\" and \\"Roulette\\". In October, the band played their second gig, debuting the same songs, at a concert organized by Spin magazine at the Annex in New York. By this point the band had decided upon the 14 of the demos they were to record for the album: \\"I Started a Fire\\", \\"Suicide Girls\\", \\"Shadows\\", \\"Roulette\\" (previously called \\"Keep It In\\"), \\"Princess Six\\", \\"Polaris\\", \\"Dark and Stormy\\", \\"You Can't Have It All\\", \\"End of the World\\", \\"Blacklisted\\", \\"Shattered Glass\\", \\"Saskia\\", \\"What Is the Meaning?\\" and \\"In Hell\\". The other tracks are to be relegated to appear either as B-sides, on future albums, or simply scrapped altogether. During October and November the band recorded the guitar and drums parts for the tracks. In late November and early December, Wheeler began to record the vocals for the album. As well as this, the string sections for \\"Polaris\\" and \\"In Hell\\" were recorded with a 20 piece orchestra in Los Angeles at this time. Some rough mixes were done for the tracks in December also. In January 2007, Michael Brauer was recruited to mix the album. The vocals were being finished off at this time (despite Wheeler coming down with the flu) also. After around a fortnight, the tracks were finished being mixed, and the songs were mastered. Before the announcement of the album details, a few name changes occurred. \\"In Hell\\" became \\"Twilight of the Innocents\\", \\"Roulette\\" became \\"Ritual\\" and \\"Suicide Girls\\" became \\"Palace of Excess\\". TOTI began with 27 rough songs, which they started recording demos for in June 2006. *\\"Wasted on You\\" *\\"Princess Six\\" *\\"Suicide Girls\\" (now titled \\"Palace of Excess\\") *\\"Lay Down Your Arms\\" *\\"Keep It In\\" (formerly \\"Roulette\\", now titled \\"Ritual\\") *\\"Shadows\\" *\\"Piano Song\\" (now titled \\"Polaris\\") *\\"Hospital\\" *\\"Saskia\\" *\\"You Can't Have It All\\" *\\"What Is the Meaning?\\" (now titled \\"Comet Tempel 1\\") *\\"Dead Fairy\\" *\\"Wish You Were Dead\\" *\\"A Little High\\" (now titled \\"Kingdom of Shadow\\") *\\"Thin Air\\" *\\"Obsolete\\" *\\"Come On Over\\" *\\"Can't Be Owned\\" (now titled \\"I Started a Fire\\") *\\"New Tattoo\\" *\\"Running Away Again\\" *\\"Carlos D\\" *\\"Dark and Stormy\\" *\\"Shattered Glass\\" *\\"End of the World\\" *\\"Kill Your Friends\\" *\\"In Hell\\" (now titled \\"Twilight of the Innocents\\") Talking to Kerrang! in 2008, Tim Wheeler said: > We'd gone back to being a three piece without Charlotte [Hatherly], and it > was the first album we‚Äôd produced ourselves.

P.54 =Album title= On 4 April 2007 the album title was revealed to be Twilight of the Innocents. For three months previous to this, the band had held a hangman game with its fans on MySpace and their message board. Each week the band would provide the players with five potential letters, and hold a vote. Whichever letter got the highest number of votes per week would be considered the fans guess, and contributed towards the hangman game. Tim had also managed to get Chris Moyles involved in the game during an interview on his Breakfast Show, who subsequently had members of Travis guessing the next day as well. Neither came near. The game continued for around eight weeks, until the game was aborted in late March, due to leaks in the press, and various correct guesses to the title. The title of this album could be a play on words of Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophical work Twilight of the Idols. This was in turn a play on words of the Wagner composition \\"Twilight of the Gods\\". During the period prior to the revealing of the album's title, it was codenamed TOTI. Pre-album promotion In February 2007 the band began their first tour since 2005 in the form of the Higher Education Tour. The tour consisted of around 20 universities around the United Kingdom and was in co-operation with the NUS. On this tour the band debuted several new songs, and were supported by the band V//Formation. The band also played promotional gigs for XFM and BBC Radio 1. In February, the band released a free download track to the fans. \\"I Started a Fire\\", the eventual album's opener. The song raised much excitement from the general public, in a similar fashion to \\"Clones\\" did for \\"Meltdown\\".

Cyril and Methodius in Lemont () - historic church of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago, located in Lemont, Illinois. It is a prime example of the so-called 'Polish Cathedral style' of churches in both its opulence and grand scale. Along with the Hindu Temple of Greater Chicago, it is one of the two monumental religious edifices that dominate the Lemont skyline. History Poles are noted in the Lemont area as early as 1860 working in the local quarries. SS. Cyril and Methodius parish was founded in 1884 as a Polish parish. The surrounding area was called Jasna G√≥ra, in reverence to the shrine of the Black Madonna in Poland. The parish offers mass in both Polish and English and is currently home to 1,965 families. Architecture The church was designed by Erhard Brielmaier, and sons, who are most well known for their design of the magnificent St. Josaphat Basilica in Milwaukee as well as the now closed parish of St. Salomea in Roseland. The Romanesque style edifice was completed in 1929, replacing a former church that burned down in 1928. Some of the church's highlights are the beautiful original rose window, the new entryway, and the church's steeple which is the highest elevation in all of Cook County, Illinois. Patron saints Cyril and Methodius were brothers born of Macedonian nobility, who became priests in Constantinople. They evangelized to the Slavic peoples, translated the liturgy into Slavonic and made numerous converts. They are also credited with devising and spreading the Glagolitic alphabet, which was used for Slavonic manuscripts before the development of the Cyrillic, the alphabet derived from Glagolitic, that, with small modifications, is still used in a number of Slavic languages. Both brothers were canonized in The Eastern Orthodox Church as \\"equal-to-apostles\\". In the Roman Catholic Church they are also jointly revered as Apostles to the Slavs and their cult was further glorified in 1980 when Pope John Paul II declared them the patron saints of Europe.

Today it is a modern hospital with 900 beds, with wards for adults, pregnant women and children. There are three different emergency rooms for different categories of patients. The maternity ward (Mangiagalli Clinic) has the highest number of births in Lombardy. The Foundation is a scientific Institute for Research, Hospitalization and Health Care (IRCCS), which means that, alongside clinical activity, it promotes research programs with predominantly translational purposes. The programs are concerned with the rapid transfer of therapies from the laboratory to patients. Organization *President: Marco Giachetti *General Director: Ezio Belleri *Administrative Director: Fabio Agr√≤ *Medical Director: Laura Chiappa *Scientific Director: Silvano Bosari History In 1456 the Duke of Milan, Francesco Sforza, founded the Magna Domus Hospitalis (Ca' Granda), a hospital dedicated to Annunciata (a municipality of the province of Brescia, Northern Italy). He did so primarily to gain the affection of its people, who were followers of the Visconti family of Milan, even though the Duke was married to Bianca Maria Visconti at the time.New Guardia Pavilion and First Aid after the renovation works Policlinico's courtyard, now seat of the University of Milan, after the bombing of 1943. Entering Milan victorious on 25 March 1450 (the day of Annunciation), the Duke decided to dedicate a charitable institution to Annunciata. It was then that the new foundation became the Spedale della Nunciata. Designed by the renowned architect Filarete and built by the engineer Guiniforte Solari (responsible for the courtyard of the Certosa di Pavia, a monastery complex in Lombardy, Northern Italy), the hospital formed part of the completion of the reform of hospitals started by the Archbishop Rampini in the years of the Golden Ambrosian Republic. The completion of the cloisters and their ornamentation was carried out by Giovanni Antonio Amadeo, Solari's son-in-law and pupil. Although the hospital was founded for the poor, it was from the outset a hospital where people with some hope of recovery were treated. Chronic diseases were treated in hospitals outside the city. For this reason the Ospedale Maggiore has always been the centre of health information in the city. Policlinico's aerial view, before the demolition started between 2010 and 2011.At the beginning of the 20th century, it was decided that the hospital would be moved to a location beyond the canal (where work had already been started on its expansion). This move coincided with the founding of the state University, which took over the old buildings of the Ca' Granda, where it remains today. The Ospedale Maggiore moved to a vast area between the streets of Francesco Sforza (the site of the canal), Porta Romana, Lamarmora and Commenda. The obstetrics and gynaecology department was the first to be inaugurated, by Luigi Mangiagalli (the first Chancellor of the University), and the department still bears his name. At the time the hospital moved it had been decided that a general hospital would be created in the area of Niguarda (a neighbouring municipality, which had become part of Milan in 1923). This hospital was designed by Gi√≤ Ponti and inaugurated in 1932. It kept the name Ca' Granda, whilst the new general hospital took the name Ospedale Maggiore. Policlinico's old Guardia Pavilion, before the renovation works started in 2010 Further additions to the hospital institution included the San Carlo Borromeo di Milano (also designed by Gi√≤ Ponti) and the Sesto San Giovanni hospitals. The institution was later divided up, giving autonomy to the different institutes, whilst others were founded independently and included later. In 1909 the Adelina brothers and Marco De Marchi founded the Asilo per le madri povere legittime \\"Regina Elena\\" (Regina Elena Refuge for Poor Mothers), which remained an independent service until 1990. In 1957 it was converted into a specialist hospital and in 1968 it became the Regina Elena Institute of Obstetrics-Gynaecology and Paediatrics. From 1998 to 2004 the clinical Institutes of Faithful Improvement, Mangiagalli and Regina Elena were placed under the same authority. In 2010 the name of the hospital was changed, reverting to the former Ca' Granda. The university has hosted prominent medical doctors and experts including: * Carlo Forlanini - inventor of artificial pneumothorax. * Edoardo Porro - innovator of the caesarean section. * Baldo Rossi - pioneer of emergency surgery. * Luigi Mangiagalli - founder of Istituto Ostetrico Ginecologico. * Luigi Devoto - pioneer of occupational medicine. Historical archive =Insignia and logo= Historical building The organisation's insignia used to bear the scene of the Annunciation and the Latin motto 'ave gratiae plena' (\\"hail, full of grace\\"). Later it was simplified to a picture of the dove of the Holy Spirit. The heraldic representation, still the basis of the Foundation's current logo, is closely linked with the Visconti symbol of the flaming, radiant turtle-dove. The olive branch in the bird's beak was added later. Until 1825 the Organisation had the duty of assisting children in need, who, considered as 'the hospital's children', took the surname 'Colombo', meaning 'dove'. The Niguarda, Sesto San Giovanni and San Carlo Borromeo hospitals also obtained insignias or sculptures reminiscent of the dedication. =Banner= The hospital has two banners of honour: one large banner, maintained in a museum collection, and a pair of smaller banners for use in ceremonies. The need for a banner to display at ceremonies and funerals of benefactors arose in 1927, and inspiration was taken from the banner of the Municipality of Milan, which has particularly solemn connotations. The front of the banner represents the Annunciation. On the other side, the dove is embroidered, surrounded by the heraldic insignias of the hospital's main benefactors: Sforza, Macchi, Del Sesto, Parravicini, Ponti, Secco Comneno, the municipality of Milano, Pio II Piccolomini, Pio IV Medici di Marignano, Pio XI Ratti, Cardinals Saint Carlo Borromeo e Schuster, and the Order of the Holy Sepulchre. The project and its realisation were the responsibility of the Milanese architect Gi√≤ Ponti, who intended to add value to the banner using both materials and techniques. The metallic parts of the banner were created by the Ravasco firm, and Alfredo Ravasco, the company director, wanted to donate precious stones. Meanwhile, the Bartelli firm had completed the gold and silver embroidery on pure silk. The banner was inaugurated by Cardinal Ildefonso Schuster on 24 March 1935 (the first day of the Festival of Forgiveness) during a solemn function held in Milan's Duomo. In 1938 a copy was made, in order to be able to transport it with ease with just two poles. The original was moved to a collection in 1942 and decorated with crystals by the Silvestri firm. =Book of the Dead= At the beginning of the 19th century, the Milanese Carlo Ingnazio Busca brought a mummy in a sarcophagus and a papyrus to Milan. Today, the mummy can be found at Sforza Castle, while the papyrus is housed in the Historical Archive of the General Hospital. It is not open to public viewing, but is reproduced digitally with infra-red reflectography thanks to an agreement with the University of Milan's Interdepartmental Centre of Infrared and Diagnostic Reflectography of Cultural Heritage, run by Professor Duilio Bertani. The ancient Egyptian papyrus is called Libro per uscire dal giorno (\\"Book to leave the day\\") and reproduces the famous Book of the Dead, a series of formulae aimed to facilitate the soul on its last journey beyond the western horizon toward the afterlife. The scroll, almost seven metres long, was produced in Thebes for the scribe and designer Pthamose at the beginning of the nineteenth dynasty of Egypt (1305-1200 BC). It shows a complete text, full of drawings, and it mentions a series of formulae to activate several amulets, which is rare in similar papyri. The heirs of the mummy had to decide what to do with this souvenir, and, taking advice from Dr. Pessani of the Ciceri-Agnesi Fatebenesorelle Hospital, they were persuaded to donate it to the Institute's pharmacy (the mummy was in fact, at the time, considered to be a pharmacological remedy). The mummy then became part of the Civic Archaeological and Numismatic Collections at Sforza Castle. Departments The Ospedale Maggiore General Hospital- Mangiagalli- Regina Elena Foundation, has two executive committees which are divided into separate departments. thumb Ospedale Maggiore General Hospital Committee *Zonda Department: general surgery and transplants *Monteggia Department: surgery (head and neck) *Sacco Department: radiology, cardiology, lungs *Granelli-Marcora Department: internal medicine, gastroenterology, endocrinology, haematology *Litta Department: the first to be built in the area beyond the Canal in 1895; it houses the Association of Italian Rescue Workers *Frigerio Department (Lamarmora): group practice *Beretta Neuro Department: brain surgery *Ponti Department: neurology *Guardia Department: A&E; *Guardia II Department:psychiatry *Marangoni Department: immunohaematology, transfusions and transplants *Bosisio Department: pathology  Centers  The hospital hosts the following biological sample banks and centers: = Milano Cord Blood Bank = The hospital hosts the Milano Cord Blood Bank, which has an inventory of 9,000 umbilical cord blood acquired from donations, which is used for more than 500 stem cell transplants in Italy and abroad. = Biobanca = The biobank contains about 200,000 samples of biological materials such as serum, cells, DNA and RNA.

Kagey purchased a circa-1950's Challenge proof press This Strange Thing of Ours: Witty and spiritual, scofflaw yet civic-minded. Beautiful Angle is a tangle of contradictions, all coated with wheatpaste, City Arts (Tacoma), Sep/Oct 2007 through eBay for $50. After paying more than 12 times that amount in shipping and after months of self-education and experimentation, Kagey and copywriter and author Tom Llewellyn began producing posters. The first poster, Swirl, was distributed on October 31, 2002, the anniversary of the posting of The Ninety-Five Theses by Martin Luther. Beautiful Angle has used a variety of printing techniques, including split fountain color process, a two color double run, and a brayer over a printed image. A typical press run is 100 posters, of which 80 are posted around the downtown area of Tacoma, and the remainder are sold. Beautiful Angle has a \\"strange, contradictory relationship with the city\\"; even though the posters are posted perhaps illegally, the group has won a Chamber of Commerce award of merit.Recognizing New Tacoma Award Winners, May 4, 2010 Beautiful Angle has also worked with other artists such as Art Chantry.

The MacLeod Baronetcy, of Fuinary, Morven, in the County of Argyll, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 3 March 1924 for John MacLeod, who had earlier represented Glasgow Central and Kelvingrove in the House of Commons as a Conservative. His grandson, the third Baronet (who succeeded his father), was killed on active service in 1944. He was succeeded by his uncle, the fourth Baronet, George MacLeod. He was a clergyman, one of the best known, most influential and unconventional Church of Scotland ministers of the 20th century, and founder of the Iona Community on the island of Iona. In 1967 he was given a life peerage as Baron MacLeod of Fuinary, of Fuinary in Morven in the County of Argyll.

It opened in 1933 as an affiliate of Fordham University and merged with St. John's University in 1971. Notre Dame was located on the former estate of Herbert Gans. It opened with 13 students and graduated its first class in 1935. The alumnae association now has about 1,600 active members. The college's campus is now the Staten Island campus of St. John's. The Gans Family Estate The site of the college, now St. John's Staten Island campus, was originally purchased in the early 20th century by immigrant John Gans. He chose the Grymes Hill location for his family estate because it overlooked New York Harbor, where he operated a steamship company. The main house of the estate, a 30-room Georgian mansion, was completed in 1915 and became home to son Herbert Gans and his family.  Founding In the early 1930s, Herbert Gans and his wife befriended Mother Saint Egbert, later known as Sister Helen Flynn, a Sister of the Congregation of Notre Dame. She had just been named the director of the newly established Staten Island extension of Fordham University which was housed at Notre Dame Academy (Staten Island), a private school down the road from the Gans estate. When the small college of 13 students received its own charter in 1933, the Gans family sold the family mansion to the new Notre Dame College, which became a Catholic undergraduate college for women. The home, renamed Flynn Hall after the college foundress, opened in 1934 and graduated its first class in 1935. In 1937, Lavelle Hall, an academic building, was added and named in honor of Monsignor Lavelle, the Vicar General of the Archdiocese of New York. A science building followed in 1945 named Mahoney Hall, after its principal benefactor. In 1955, the college doubled its property with the purchase of the Herbert Gans estate, which included several properties, the largest of which served as the college library. It was named Spellman Hall after Francis Spellman, then cardinal archbishop of the Archdiocese of New York, who contributed toward its reconstruction. The final purchase, an English Tudor home at the far end of the campus, was made in 1965. The Drury family, who had purchased the house from Hans Gans in 1945, sold the house and surrounding property to Notre Dame College. It was renamed Rosati Hall in honor of Bishop Joseph Rosati, C.M. 1789‚Äì1843. Consolidation Notre Dame College served the community as a premier women's college for over 30 years. During the late 1960s, when it became difficult for small colleges to survive, Terence Cooke, then Cardinal Archbishop of the Archdiocese of New York, asked the Vincentian Fathers of St. John's University, to integrate Notre Dame College, in order that Catholic higher education remain a vibrant presence in the Staten Island community and its environs. On January 27, 1971, the New York State Board of Regents approved the consolidation and the Staten Island Campus of St. John's University became a reality. Classes began in the fall of 1971, combining the original Notre Dame College with the Brooklyn campus of St. John's, offering undergraduate degrees in liberal arts, business and education.

Part of the Oregon Coast Range, Saddle Mountain is in Saddle Mountain State Natural Area in the northwest corner of Oregon. The peak is listed on Oregon's Register of Natural Heritage Resources.  Geology  A view from the Saddle Mountain trail. Saddle Mountain was created around 15 million years ago in the Miocene epoch when lava flows poured down the old Columbia River valley. When the lava encountered the water at the Astoria Sea, great steam explosions and thermal shocks occurred to create a large pile of basalt rocks. The mountain consists of this volcanic breccia, which is a rock made up of broken basalt fragments that are fused together in a fine-grained matrix.  History  In modern time, the mountain has been viewed and described by a variety of European and American explorers. Beginning in 1788, these explorers included British captain John Meares, Lewis and Clark in 1805, and the Wilkes Expedition in 1841. Meares named the peak Mont de la Selle in 1788.  Access  The hike to the taller of the two peaks is a round trip consisting of challenging terrain. Elevation gain is and leads to a 360-degree view to the Pacific Ocean, Cascade Mountain peaks such as Mount Hood, Mt. St. Helens, Mt. Rainier, Mt. Adams, and other peaks in the Coast Range. The lower peak-- elevation -- to the east and south does not have trail access. The trail is steep at times along rock outcroppings, but does offer views that include wildflowers in bloom in the springtime. Beside the trailhead is a picnic area and a primitive walk-in campground. Saddle Mountain is off U.S. Route 26 about west of Portland. The access road to the mountain and state park is paved.

History Apoyevmatini was initially foundedhttp://www.sofiatimes.com/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=14876&Itemid;=86 as a collaboration between Konstantinos Vasileiadis (in Greek: ŒöœâŒΩœÉœÑŒ±ŒΩœÑŒØŒΩŒøœÇ ŒíŒ±œÉŒπŒªŒµŒπŒ¨Œ¥Œ∑œÇ), holder of the publishing license, and Odysseas Krystalidis (ŒüŒ¥œÖœÉœÉŒ≠Œ±œÇ ŒöœÅœÖœÉœÑŒ±ŒªŒªŒØŒ¥Œ∑œÇ), owner and operator of printing facilities, and experienced individual in newspaper distribution. Editor-in-chief until 1927 was Kavalieros Markouizos (ŒöŒ±Œ≤Œ±ŒªŒπŒ≠œÅŒøœÇ ŒúŒ±œÅŒ∫ŒøœÖŒêŒ∂ŒøœÇ), who adopted the motto still being used in the newspaper, Victor Hugo's \\"New epochs bring new missions\\" (in Greek: ŒëŒπ ŒΩŒ≠Œ±Œπ ŒµœÄŒøœáŒ±ŒØ ŒµœÄŒπŒ≤Œ¨ŒªŒªŒøœÖœÉŒπ Œ∫Œ±Œπ ŒΩŒ≠Œ± Œ∫Œ±Œ∏ŒÆŒ∫ŒøŒΩœÑŒ±). Appropriate for the time, the motto reflected the transition that the Greek community was facing, following the emergence of the newly formed Republic of Turkey out of the Ottoman Empire. In 1927 Grigorios Giaveridis (ŒìœÅŒ∑Œ≥œåœÅŒπŒøœÇ ŒìŒπŒ±Œ≤ŒµœÅŒØŒ¥Œ∑œÇ) becomes editor-in-chief until his death, on 1 August 1979.

This was probably a discreet hint on the newspaper's potential demographic significance, since it is up to this date habitual for Greek families to announce births, baptisms, matrimony, deaths and memorial services to newspapers. In September 1955 during the anti-Greek Istanbul Pogrom, the offices and the printing establishments of the newspaper were completely wrecked by the fanatical mob. Apoyevmatini managed to resume its publication two weeks after the event. Its losses alone were estimated at 500,000 Turkish liras.Vryonis Speros Jr. September 6, 1955: Krystallnacht in Constantinople. orthodoxytoday.org After Dr. Georgios' Adosoglou death on 21 June 2002, ownership of Apoyevmatini was transferred to his sister, Efsevia Adosoglou (ŒïœÖœÉŒµŒ≤ŒØŒ± ŒëŒ¥œåœÉŒøŒ≥ŒªŒøœÖ), with the newspaper declining to a circulation of barely 80 copies per day, managing to survive only through minor incoming funds from donations and announcements.Broussard Ph., L'EXPRESS, issue 2840, 8 Dec 2005, p. 64 Since 1 January 2003, Michael Vasiliadis (ŒúŒπœáŒ±ŒÆŒª ŒíŒ±œÉŒπŒªŒµŒπŒ¨Œ¥Œ∑œÇ) has been the editor-in-chief of Apoyevmatini. In July 2011, Apoyevmatini declared that it would shut down due to financial difficulties: the newspaper faced closure due to financial problems that had been further aggravated by the economic crisis in Greece, when Greek companies quickly stopped publishing advertisements. This ignited a campaign to help the newspaper. Among others, the supporters were mostly students from ƒ∞stanbul Bilgi University who subscribed to the newspaper and ran a campaign including video spots calling for help, with the slogan 'Apoyevmatini is our Cultural Heritage too' (in Turkish: \\"Bu gazete bizim de k√ºlt√ºr mirasƒ±mƒ±zdƒ±r\\".Milliyet - \\"APOYEVMATiNi K√úLT√úR MiRASIMIZDIR\\" The campaign saved the paper from bankruptcy for the time being. Because the Greek community is close to extinction, money from occasional obituary notices and from the announcements of the various Greek- orthodox foundations of Istanbul, as well as subscriptions by Greek and Turkish people, are the only sources of income. As of 2011 this income covered only 40 percent of the newspaper expenditures.H√ºrriyet Daily News, 12 July 2011 Turkey‚Äôs sole Greek daily off the hook This was followed in September 2011 by a government cash grant of 45,000 Turkish Liras to the newspaper through the Turkish Press Advertisement Agency (Basƒ±n ƒ∞lan Kurumu), as part of a wider support of minority newspapers.Dardaki azƒ±nlƒ±k gazetelerine bayram gecesi yardƒ±mƒ±...

One can also find news of international interest such as education, culture, charity, technology, health and science. Printing methods During earlier years the newspaper was being produced using type-founding and printing press in the newspaper's own installations, but with the declining of the Greek population the circulation of the newspaper also declined, leaving no option but to sell the space used for printing. The original equipment is currently being exhibited in the Museum of Printing Press in Sultanahmet. Until December 2007 the technology behind the process of preparing each issue was unsatisfactory. Due to lack of funds, each page was prepared by hand; the infrastructure installed in the newspaper's office consisted of a 486 microprocessor-based PC, an inkjet printer and one photocopy machine. Text was written and printed, and then cut in a rectangle shape of physical width matching that of the newspaper's column. All the rectangles assembling the final columns would then be glued to a thin sheet A2 sized paper which would be photocopied and become the master copy for that page.Yildiz A., Zaman, 20 April 2004, \\"Greek Community's Oldest Newspaper Lives on By Xerox\\". The process would be repeated for each of the four daily pages of the newspaper, which would then be outsourced to a modern printing facility to be photographed and printed using a photo-offset printing method. Because of the use of photocopy paper (as opposed to using a film), the resulting contrast was too poor to allow any detail to be seen in photographs, thus banning them from the final print. After December 2007 and because of the widespread access to technology the newspaper's budget allowed the renewal of the equipment, and it is now being issued using modern digital methods.

It tells the story of an odd couple of army buddies in World War I; the movie, while played on a comedic register, does not hide from the viewer the horrors and grimness of trench warfare. Starring Alberto Sordi and Vittorio Gassman and produced by Dino De Laurentiis, the film won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. Its crew also included Danilo Donati (costumes) and Mario Garbuglia (set designer). It was an Academy Award nominee as Best Foreign Film. In 1999 the critics of Ciak magazine chose it as one of the 100 most important films in history, and was selected to enter the list of the \\"100 Italian films to be saved\\". It won huge success outside Italy, especially in France. Plot 1916\\\\. The Roman Oreste Jacovacci and Giovanni Busacca meet in a military district during the call to arms. The former promises to deceive the other in exchange for money. The two meet again on a train to the front: after Giovanni's initial anger, they end up sympathizing and becoming friends. Although completely different in character, they are united by the lack of any ideal and the desire to avoid any danger in order to emerge unscathed from the war. After going through numerous vicissitudes during training, fighting and rare leave, following the defeat of Caporetto, they are commanded as relay runners, a very dangerous task, which is entrusted to them because they are considered to be the \\"least efficient\\". One evening, after carrying out their mission, they lie down in the stable of an outpost not far from the front line, but a sudden advance of the Austrians \\"transports\\" them to enemy territory. Surprised to wear coats of the Austro- Hungarian army in an attempt to escape, they are captured, accused of espionage and threatened with shooting. Overwhelmed by fear, they admit that they have crucial information on the Italian counterattack on the Piave, and in order to save themselves, they decide to pass it on to the enemy. The arrogance of the Austrian officer and a joke of contempt for the Italians, however, restores strength to their dignity, leading them to keep the secret until the execution, one boldly insulting the enemy captain and the other who, after the shooting of the companion, pretends not to be aware of the information and is thus shot shortly after the friend. The battle ended shortly after, with the victory of the Italian army and the reconquest of the position fallen into the hands of the Austrians, ignoring the noble sacrifice of Busacca and Jacovacci, believed to be fugitives, who opted for the shooting in order not to betray the own compatriots.

It is narrated in a simultaneously neorealist and romantic idiom, combining typical features of Italian comedy with attention to historical detail. One review wrote that it \\"realises a fusion, in some ways unsurpassed, through criticism dressed as comedy and the perspective of historical criticism capable of dealing with the past with the same lucidity and with the same anti-conformity as that shown by cinema following the eveolution of contemporary Italian society. Another review stated \\"Italian comedy was getting to grips with grand cinema and this had to pass through a direct contact with social reality and great labour in psychologically defining character. The remarkable crowd scenes are accompanied by acute characterizations of many characters, human and fearful anti-heroes, resigned to their fate in solidarity with each other, united by their enforced participation in a disaster which in the end overwhelms them. Monicelli and his scriptwriters Age & Scarpelli and Luciano Vincenzoni reached the pinnacle of their careers with this film, combining artistic skill with unparalleled fluidity of storytelling, comedy and dramatic tone, and paving the way for a new style of war film. In the citation for an honorary degree from the University of Udine on 30 May 2005, Monicelli was rewarded \\"for his extraordinary contribution to [public] knowledge of Italian history through his films, particularly 'The Great War'. A master of cinematography and the course of history, but also ... a kind of master ... who taught us things we will remember for a lifetime.\\" The short final sequence shows the two main characters redeem themselves by making a small but courageous gesture of sacrifice, one as a \\"swaggering hero\\" and the other as a \\"heroic coward\\", the latter being Sordi's role, for which he won the Nastro d'Argento for Best Actor. One reviewer wrote: The reconstruction of wartime life is, from a historical point of view, one of the best contributions by Italian cinema to the study of the First World War. For the first time a representation of that war was purged of the rhetoric of Fascist and Second World War propaganda, which continued the myth of Italy fighting a successful and heroic war, meaning The Great War had problems with the censors and banned for under 18s. One reviewer wrote \\"Its antirhetorical character brought press reactions right from the start of filming, but its public success contributed more than anything else to the de-mythologising of patriotic and romantic historiography which had always clouded the massacre that was the First World War under the oratory of ardour and sacrifice.\\" Until then Italian soldiers had always been portrayed as courageous and willing men sacrificing themselves for their country. The film also denounces the absurdity and violence of the conflict and the miserable living conditions of civilians and soldiers, but also speaks strongly about the friendships which grew up among soldiers from very different classes, cultures and regions of Italy. Forced to live side by side, the soldiers' regional rivalries and provincial nature, never thrown together before for so long, helps to partly form a national spirit that before then was nearly non-existent, in strong contrast to Italy's commanders and institutions, which are shown as the main things to blame for the war. Production The film was born out of an idea by Luciano Vincenzoni, influenced by \\"Two friends\\", a story by Guy de Maupassant. Initially thought of as a star vehicle just for Gassman, it was the producer De Laurentiis who decided to add another character, played by Sordi. The screenplay combined characters and situations from two famous books - \\"A Year on the Plateau\\" by Emilio Lussu and ‚ÄúCon me e con gli alpini‚Äù by Piero Jahier. In an interview, the director himself stated: The journalist and writer Carlo Salsa, who had actually fought in these areas in the First World War, was a script consultant, helping with the story, dialogue and background, all particularly vivid and original.

(1483 - 7 April 1560) was a French bishop, historian, and controversialist. He was born in Paris. In 1513 he became doctor of the Faculty of Theology in the Sorbonne, and in 1515 was made Bishop of Vence. From here he was transferred in 1530 to the See of Riez, and in 1532 to that of Avranches. He took an active part in the religious and polemical discussions that attended the Protestant Reformation. Works He wrote several controversial works, the most important of which are: *\\"Pro tuendo sacro coelibatu\\" (Paris, 1545) *\\"Tractatus de utriusque gladii facultate, usuque legitimo\\" (Paris, 1546, and Leyden, 1558) *\\"Axioma de divortio matrimonii mosaici per legem evangelicam refutato\\" (Paris, 1549) *\\"Traductatis Calviniacae\\" (Paris, 1556) *\\"Methodus de compescend√¢ haereticorum feroci√¢\\" (Paris, 1557). In the same year and place in which the last-named work was published, there appeared his Historia Galliae, dedicated to Henry II of France. This was a folio volume, treating of the name, origin, and achievements of the Gauls, Franks, and Burgundians. It has but little critical value. Not long afterward he produced \\"L'histoire eccl√©siastique de Normandie\\". While Bishop of Riez he issued synodal statutes of that diocese, and wrote a treatise on weights and measures under the title: \\"De liquidorum leguminumque mensuris, seu ver√¢ mensurarum ponderumque ratione\\" (Paris, 1532, 1535, 1547).

A spare is a term used in bowling to indicate that all of the pins have been knocked down during the second ball of a frame when not all the pins were knocked down in the first frame of that player‚Äôs two turns. The symbol for a spare for most bowling sports is a forward slash mark (/), while the unique vertically- oriented scoring system for candlepin bowling is somewhat different. A \\"spare\\" is awarded when no pins are left standing after the second ball of a frame; i.e., a player uses both balls of a frame to clear all ten pins. A player achieving a spare is awarded ten points, plus a bonus of whatever is scored with the next ball (only the first ball is counted). It is typically rendered as a slash on score sheets in place of the second pin count for a frame. :Example: ::Frame 1, ball 1: 7 pins ::Frame 1, ball 2: 3 pins (spare) ::Frame 2, ball 1: 4 pins ::Frame 2, ball 2: 2 pins ::The total score from these throws is: 7 + 3 + 4(bonus) + 4 + 2 = 20, while the score for Frame 1 is 14. A player who bowls a spare in the tenth (final) frame is awarded one extra ball to allow for the bonus points. Correctly calculating bonus points can be difficult and time-consuming, especially when combinations of strikes and spares come in consecutive frames. In modern times, however, this has been overcome with automated scoring systems (also known as score keepers), linked to the machines that set and clear the pins between frames. A computer automatically counts pins that remain standing, and fills in a virtual score sheet (usually displayed on monitors above each lane). However, even the automated system is not fool-proof, as the computer can miscount the number of pins that remain standing. The term \\"hard spare\\" refers when no pins are knocked down on the first ball, due to a foot foul or a ball thrown into the gutter, and then a spare is converted with all ten pins remaining with the second ball. This is sometimes mocked as throwing a strike one ball too late. Since throwing three strikes in a row is referred to as a \\"turkey,\\" novices who have three spares in a row usually use terms related to birds such as a \\"sparrow\\" or \\"cornish game hen\\" to celebrate this achievement.

The celerity and safety with which this boat descends and ascends the currents of these mighty waters, the improvement of the navigation of which is so advantageous to the western world, must be equally interesting to the farmer and the merchant. The facility and convenience of the passage, in ascending the rivers, are such as to give a decided preference to this mode of navigation, while the size and construction of the boat entitles it to all the advantages which the √Ütna and Vesuvius have in vain attempted to monopolize over the free waters of our common country.\\"American Telegraph, 5 July 1815: \\"Arrived at this port on Monday last, the Steam Boat Enterprize, Shreve, of Bridgeport, from New Orleans, in ballast, having discharged her cargo at Pittsburgh.

Livingston were the first to enter the potentially lucrative field of steamboat commerce west of the Allegheny Mountains.Hunter, pp. 7-12Stecker They established an operation in Pittsburgh, where their steamboats were also built, and another in New Orleans, the busiest port in the West. During this age, a steamboat builder could receive a federal patent that provided both protection from being copied and the freedom to navigate any of the country's waterways. Fulton had been granted a federal patent but so had several others, including Daniel French. Fulton and Livingston decided to take additional measures to prevent another steamboat company from beginning operations on the western rivers. To this end they petitioned the states bordering the western rivers for a grant of an exclusive privilege to ply their waters by steamboat. Their requests were turned down by every state except Louisiana which granted them an exclusive privilege in 1814. In states where they did not have an exclusive privilege, Livingston and Fulton resorted to litigation under their federal patent to prevent competition.Pittsburgh Gazette, 29 October 1813: \\"Fulton and Livingston have ordered a suit to be brought against Daniel French and the owners of the \\"Comet\\" for a violation of the essential part of their patent.\\" Elisha Hunt Elisha Hunt Elisha Hunt was a resident of Brownsville where he was a prominent businessman, land owner, and a director of the Monongahela Bank of Brownsville.Ellis, pp. 450-451; Bank directors are listed. He owned and operated with Caleb, his younger brother, a general store which was located in the \\"Neck\\", as the commercial center of Brownsville was called.Ellis, p. 432: \\"Elisha Hunt and Caleb Hunt kept a store in the Neck, where now is Keiser's jewelry-store. The Hunts were members of the Society of Friends.\\" The Hunt brothers sold a wide variety of items, ranging from cotton and woolen goods to nails and gunpowder, to local customers. They were ambitious and wanted to expand their mercantile business. To accomplish this Elisha and Caleb Hunt planned to augment the store's local business with interstate commerce via the western rivers. Philadelphia meeting American Telegraph, Oct., 1814 During the autumn of 1812, Elisha Hunt made the 290-mile trip to Philadelphia.Shourds Here he met with Joseph White, a former business associate and a Friend, who introduced him to Daniel French. Daniel French was an experienced mechanic who would design and construct steam engines to power a variety of equipment which he would also design and build. This equipment just happened to include a steamboat, named the Rebecca, which was currently operating as a ferry between Philadelphia and Camden, New Jersey.Daniel French PapersMaass (1996) Furthermore, French held a federal patent for his particular steamboat design which was propelled by one of his engines driving a stern paddlewheel. While he was there, arrangements were made and a stock company was formed to construct steamboats and carry passengers and freight by steamboats between Pittsburgh and New Orleans. The stock of this company was divided into six shares, of which Joseph White owned two or one-third of the whole amount stock. Daniel French, a Connecticut man, owned a patent for steamboats, and had built a little stern wheel steamboat on his plan, which was then running as a ferry boat between Cooper's Point, Camden, New Jersey, and Philadelphia. French said he could construct steamboats that would run five miles an hour, against the current of the Mississippi river, and an arrangement was made with him by which he sold to the company the right to use his patent west of the Allegheny mountains. The draft business agreement between Hunt and Daniel French reads, \\"Daniel French gives Hunt one-fourth of all advantages and profits during the patent arising from French's one-half of the whole property in his new invented steam improvements. Hunt gives French five hundred dollars in advance. Said Hunt is to go from places to places to look out places for establishing French's machinery in its various applications in mills, boats and other machinery, as also to sell, let, lease and assist in setting up works for the benefit of the said French at Hunt expense, and those services shall continue during the patent term as the best interest of the company mutually considered may direct, the said Hunt shall not hold back any reasonable services requested by the said French on forfeiture of said one- fourth as granted by said French to said Hunt, as those services are the principle consideration to said French for Hunt's one-fourth of said profits.\\"French The services of French were engaged, shops were erected at Brownsville, Pennsylvania, tools for working in iron were made, logs were cut into plank with whip saws, and with the ferry boat above mentioned as their model, they constructed the steamboat Enterprise, costing about fifteen thousand dollars, and in the latter part of the summer of 1813 she left Pittsburgh for New Orleans, under the command of Captain Henry Shreve, who was the son of Israel Shreve, of Burlington county, New Jersey, a Colonel in the Revolutionary army. In December 1812, Elisha and Caleb Hunt transported Daniel French, his three sons and a steam engine from Philadelphia to the valley of the Monongahela River in western Pennsylvania. The trip was documented by Caleb Hunt's grandson, James Walker Roberts, on a tag which was attached to his grandfather's \\"steamboat watch\\": thumb The Philadelphia meeting between Elisha Hunt, Joseph White and Daniel French was a success. Joseph White, the third shareholder in the fledgling steamboat company, would remain in Philadelphia where his hardware business was located. The basic business plan was this: Elisha Hunt would promote the use of Daniel French's steam engines and then French would build them. The nucleus of a steamboat company had been formed. But before a steamboat could be built the company needed a large increase in capital. 1813 Late in 1813, the keel of the Enterprise was laid. Hunt's store was a meeting place where potential investors were presented with an opportunity to invest in the fledgling steamboat company. Elisha Hunt wrote, \\"The little office connected with our Brownsville store was the rendezvous of many intelligent and enterprising young men, and there all the recent inventions for improving travel, etc., were argued and discussed.\\"Shourds, p. 319: \\"One of Elisha Hunt's letters states: 'The little office connected with our Brownsville store was the rendezvous of many intelligent and enterprising young men, and there all the recent inventions for improving travel, etc., were argued and discussed.' \\" Daniel French built the steam engine at Brownsville which was installed in the Comet at Pittsburgh in 1813.Congressional Edition, Volume 2552 (1889), pp. 188-9: \\"In the mean while, however, several other steam-boats had been built. The Comet was constructed at Pittsburgh in 1813, 52 feet long and 8 feet beam, with 50 to 60 pounds of steam per inch, and 20 to 30 strokes a minute.\\" \\"At the end of 1813, there were according to Kramer's Almanac, eleven steam- boats in the whole country, three building about Pittsburgh to complete the line between that town and New Orleans, and one small boat to carry wheat and corn on the Monongahela.\\"Congressional Edition, Volume 2552 (1889), p. 193: \\"The first high-pressure engine was built in 1813, by French, at Brownsville, Pa., and was placed on the Comet. It was an oscillating engine, but not working well, was taken out and placed in saw-mill at Natchez in 1814.\\" 1814 Caleb Hunt went to Louisiana for the purpose of expanding the company's steamboat line to a third boat which would operate between Louisville and New Orleans. Furthermore, this trip was a fulfillment of the business agreement between Elisha Hunt and Daniel French.\\"Said Hunt is to go from places to places to look out places for establishing French's machinery in its various applications in mills, boats and other machinery.\\" French, Daniel: Draft of a business agreement between Daniel French and Elisha Hunt. On March 1, 1814 Benjamin Henry Latrobe, serving as an agent for Fulton and Livingston, wrote from Pittsburgh to Robert Fulton, \\"There is a company chiefly of Quakers who are building a Steam boat on French's plan at the eastern shore 30 miles above this place.\\" Sometime in May 1814, the Enterprise was launched at Bridgeport.Lloyd, James T. (1856), Lloyd's steamboat directory, and disasters on the western waters..., Philadelphia: Jasper Harding, p. 43: \\"The Enterprise was No. 4 of the Western steamboat series.\\"\\"The Elegant Steam Boat, Enterprize, Captain Israel GREGG, arrived here on Wednesday last, from Bridgeport, on the Monongahela,... She is handsomely fitted up for passengers for Louisville, Falls of Ohio, for which place she will sail on Saturday or Sunday morning next.\\" Pittsburgh Gazette, 10 June 1814. Latrobe responded to the arrival of the Enterprise at Pittsburgh by publishing a public notice threatening the shareholders of the Monongahela and Ohio Steam Boat Company with litigation.Pittsburgh Gazette, 15 July 1814: \\"Steam Boat Navigation. Robert Fulton and the heirs of Robert R. Livingston, proprietors, of a Patent for navigating by Steam, do hereby give notice, that they will use every legal means to prevent the violation of their patent rights on the waters of the Ohio, to the injury of themselves or their assigns. It is not the wish of the patentees, nor is it the intention of their agent to interrupt the amusement of any person who, in making experiments on this mode of navigation, may encroach on their patented invention. The advantageous terms on which they have assigned their agents to compare it, willing and able to carry them into effect on a useful scale, are proof of their liberality. But they cannot in justice to themselves or their assigns, and certainly will not permit injurious encroachments upon their rights: And an order that ignorance may not be pleaded as to what those rights comprehend, the following specification is quoted from the patent granted to Livingston and Fulton, bearing date 11th Feb. 1809: \\"Hitherto, I (Mr. Fulton) having placed a propelling wheel on each side of the boats, with wheel guards or frames outside of each of them for their protection; a propelling wheel or wheels may however be placed behind the boat, or in the center between two boats,\\" &c.; On the 23d Sept. 1809 following, Mr. French took out a patent and selected for its subject the position of the wheel behind the boat. It is easy for any one who can pay $30 into the treasury, and is willing to swear that he believes himself the first and sole inventor of the thing patented, to obtain a patent, but the priority of invention of the right to an exclusive privilege, is not in a court of law to be decided on legal grounds. This therefore is to give notice that actions will be brought in the district court of the U. S. against each individual concerned in making, vending or using the patented rights of Fulton and Livingston to the injury of themselves or their assigns. B. H. Latrobe. Agent for the Patentees. July 8, 1814.\\" In August 1815, the manager of the cotton factory, named the \\"Bridgeport Manufacturing Company\\", announced that it was ready to begin operations.Ellis, p. 476. Using Daniel French's steam engines the company would process raw cotton and wool into yarn. Elisha Hunt was one of the principals behind the Bridgeport Manufacturing Company. He planned to process raw cotton and wool into finished goods in Bridgeport and then ship them to southern ports aboard the company's steamboats. Then the steamboats would transport raw cotton to Bridgeport to be processed into finished goods. This synergistic relationship between the manufacturing company and the steamboat company would increase the chances that both of them would be successful. 1815 By August, the shareholders of the Monongahela and Ohio Steam Boat Co. had decided to expand their business by adding another larger steamboat to make round-trip voyages between New Orleans and Louisville. To this end they planned to raise capital by selling additional shares at $500 each.American Telegraph [Brownsville, Pa.], 9 August 1815: \\"The Monogahela and Ohio Steam Boat Company, of this place, we are pleased to learn, intend to lay the keel of a Steam Boat of one hundred and thirty tons burthen, as soon as sufficient stock can be sold. The shares in this company are five hundred dollars each, one hundred paid on subscribing, and one hundred at the end of each succeeding sixtieth day until the whole be paid; the new stock holders to draw a dividend of the profits of all the boats after the one proposed shall be in operation. This boat is intended as a regular trader from New Orleans to the falls of Ohio, which with the Enterprize which is destined to ply between the falls & Pittsburgh, and the Despatch from Pittsburgh to Bridgeport, will form a complete line from New Orleans to this place.\\" 1816 =February= The Dispatch at New Orleans The Dispatch, owned as well as the Enterprise by the Monongahela and Ohio Steam Boat Company, steamed from Brownsville to the port of New Orleans by February 13, 1816 with important documents aboard for attorney Abner L. Duncan to use during the impending Enterprise trial.American Telegraph [Brownsville, Pa.], 5 April 1815: \\"WAS LAUNCHED, In Bridgeport, adjoining Brownsville, last Thursday, the Steam Boat DESPATCH. This boat is owned by the \\"Monongahela and Ohio Steam Boat Company.\\" We understand she is intended as a regular packet between Bridgeport and Pittsburgh.\\"New Orleans Wharf Register: On February 13, 1816, payment of the wharfage fee, in the amount of \\"$6\\", for the \\"Steam Boat Dispatch\\" was recorded. While docked at the levee, an incident occurred aboard the Dispatch that Robert Rogers, the first engineer, would record: Accounts of this incident were published in newspapers throughout the West.Commonwealth [Pittsburgh, Pa.], 15 May 1816: \\"From a Kentucky paper we have copied an account of the detention of the steamboat Dispatch, and the interruption she met with in New Orleans. We have endeavored to see Captain Bruce since his arrival, in order to obtain more correct information on the subject, but have not had the good fortune to meet with him. We conceive the act of the legislature under which Mr. Livingston has proceeded in this business, as an infamous violation of the constitutional privileges of the citizens of all states lying on the great Western waters. We know not what construction the above act will receive from the courts at Orleans. But it is much better to trust to our own power of retaliation than to the justice of courts two thousand miles from us. If the system of oppression under which Captain Bruce has suffered, is to be continued, it is to be hoped that the powerful State of Pennsylvania will not submit to a legalized system of plunder and robbery, maintained by the State of Louisiana. It is to be presumed that she will rise in the majesty of her strength, pass retaliatory acts, and subject to attachments and seizure, not the vessels merely which may belong to its citizens. This would be an act of vengeance worthy of her; and if this should not be able to put a stop to the impudent pretensions of the new State to an exclusive jurisdiction over the navigation of the waters within her boundaries, force must!\\" =May= The Enterprise trial at New Orleans 1817 Resolution by Kentucky legislature During May 1816, the Enterprise trial, judge Dominic A. Hall presiding, was held in the old Spanish courthouse, 919 Royal Street. The plaintiffs were represented by John R. Grymes, the defendants by Abner L. Duncan. Duncan began by presenting Daniel French's 1809 federal patent for his improved steamboat engine, which powered the Enterprise.Daniel French granted US Patent (October 9, 1809), Propulsion of Vessels, 1791‚Äì1810, US Patent Office Scientific Duncan argued that this federal patent protected all of the defendants ‚Äì French, Shreve and the shareholders of the Monongahela and Ohio Steam Boat Co. - from the charges by the monopolists.Duncan, Abner L. \\"Supplemental answer to the Judge of the District Court for the First Judicial District of the State of Louisiana, filed January 22, 1816\\". LeBoeuf Collection, Calendar of the Mississippi Set, The New-York Historical Society. On May 20, Judge Hall, stating that the Territorial Legislature had excedeed its authority in granting the steamboat monopoly, dismissed the petition of the plaintiffs. A letter announcing the news of Judge Hall's decision and proclaiming its significance to the growth of steamboat commerce and the economy of the West was published in a Louisville newspaper.Western Courier [Louisville, Ky.], 13 June 1816: \\"Copy of a letter from a gentleman in New-Orleans, to his friend in this place, dated New-Orleans, May 26, 1816. 'Having understood you are interested in the Steam Boat building at Louisville, I have the pleasure to inform you that the suit depending between Livingston and the proprietors of the steam boat Enterprize, has been decided in the district court of this state against Livingston & Co. on the plea that the legislature of this (then) territory, exceeded their power in granting an exclusive privilege. Mr. Livingston has appealed to the superior court of this state, where it is generally supposed he will meet with a similar fate. I hope this information will be of service to your company, and cause them to progress more rapidly in an undertaking which is calculated to be of such importance to the Western country.'\\" During January of 1817, the Kentucky legislature responded to the seizures of the Enterprise and the Dispatch by passing a resolution.Slaughter, Gabriel (1817). Acts passed at the first session of the twenty-fifth general assembly, for the commonwealth of Kentucky. Frankfort, Kentucky: Gerard and Kendall, pp. 280-1: \\"Resolutions relative to the free navigation of the river Mississippi. Be it resolved by the general assembly of the commonwealth of Kentucky, That they have viewed with the deepest concern, the violation of the right guaranteed by the federal constitution and the laws of congress, to navigate the river Mississippi, in the seizure of the Steam Boat Enterprize, under the pretended authority of a law enacted by the legislature of the late Territory of New Orleans. Resolved, That they will maintain inviolate by all legitimate means the right of her citizens to navigate said river, and its tributary streams.\\" From the arrest and seizure of May 1, 1815, throughout the preliminary legal procedures, to the last testimony before Judge Hall during the Enterprise trial, Grymes and Duncan represented opposing positions. Out of court, however, they worked together as aides-de-camp for General Andrew Jackson during the recent siege of New Orleans and as conspirators engaged in profiteering from illegally seized Spanish property.

It is opposite the upper end of Shippingport, and has water enough at all seasons for vessels of any burthen.\\" Historian Thomas Shourds used firsthand information provided by Elisha Hunt, the principal founder and shareholder of the Monongahela and Ohio Steam Boat Company, to chronicle the final days of the Enterprise: According to Elisha Hunt, while safely anchored in Rock Harbor during August or early autumn of 1816, the unattended Enterprise was allowed to sink. Sale of Company assets During August of 1816, an announcement that assets of the Monongahela and Ohio Steam Boat Company would be sold was published in Brownsville's newspaper, the American Telegraph.Henshaw, p.57: \\"The Monongahela and Ohio Steamboat Company eventually failured to raise enough capital from the public to continue building steamboats. The company began selling its assets such as tools (chest and cupboard locks, knob locks, hinges) on August 17, 1816.\\" Aftermath Caleb Hunt's steamboat watch During the waning days of the Monongahela and Ohio Steam Boat Company, Caleb Hunt exchanged his share of stock for a fine English watch.Warren, Dorothy J. (10 April 1955), \\"History wanted on riverman's watch\\", St. Paul Sunday Pioneer Press, St. Paul, Minnesota, p. 4 This watch, with its original recorded history, has been passed down through several generations of Caleb Hunt's descendants.

All the other pins are knocked down in a chain reaction called pin scatter and this is commonly known as a perfect strike. A strike is a term used in bowling to indicate that all of the pins have been knocked down with the first ball roll of a frame. On a bowling scoresheet, a strike is marked by an \\"X\\". Top view: A bowling ball impacting the head pin at a point found to be optimum to achieve a strike (for a right-handed release). Many believe‚Äîwrongly‚Äîthat the ideal \\"pocket\\" is more \\"between\\" the 1 pin and 3 pin. Entry angles of 0¬∞, 2¬∞, 4¬∞ and 6¬∞ are illustrated. Front view: ball impacts center pocket at \\"board 17.5\\"‚Äîfound by a USBC pin-carry study to maximize strike probability. The ideal impact point is closer to the center of the head pin than most people think. In American nine-pin bowling, a ringer is an equivalent term for knocking all nine pins in the first ball of the frame (known as a full house). Scoring A ten-pin bowling score sheet showing how a strike is scored When all ten pins are knocked down with the first ball roll (called a strike and typically rendered as an \\"X\\" on a score sheet), a player is awarded ten points, plus a bonus of whatever is scored with the next two rolls (not necessarily the next two frames). In this way, the points scored for the two rolls after the strike, are counted twice. ::Frame 1, ball 1: 10 pins (strike) ::Frame 2, ball 1: 3 pins ::Frame 2, ball 2: 6 pins ::The total score from these throws is: :::*Frame one: 10 + (3 + 6) = 19 :::*Frame two: 3 + 6 = 9 ::::TOTAL = 28 Strike scoring works similarly for five-pin bowling, except strikes are worth 15 points rather than 10 (as the pins are scored with the values of 2, 3, 5, 3, and 2). Consecutive strikes Two consecutive strikes are referred to as a \\"double\\" (or a \\"Barney Rubble\\" to rhyme) aka the \\"rhino\\". Three strikes bowled consecutively is known as a \\"turkey\\" (sometimes a \\"sizzling turkey\\" if on the first three frames). Any longer string of strikes is referred to by a number affixed to the word \\"bagger,\\" as in \\"four- bagger\\" for four consecutive strikes. Broadcaster Rob Stone created the name \\"hambone\\" to describe four consecutive strikes. When a player is \\"on the strikes\\", a string is often referenced by affixing \\"in a row\\" to the number of strikes bowled consecutively. Six strikes in a row are sometimes referred to as a \\"six pack\\" or \\"sixer\\". Six strikes and nine strikes in a row can also be referred to \\"wild turkeys\\" and \\"golden turkeys\\" respectively. Any string of strikes starting in the first frame or ending \\"off the sheet\\" (where all of a bowler's shots from a certain frame to the end of the game strike) are often referred to as the \\"front\\" or \\"back\\" strikes, respectively (e.g. the 'front nine' for strikes in frames 1-9, or the 'back six' for strikes in frames 7, 8, and 9 with a turkey in the tenth). Twelve strikes in a row is a perfect game; 36 consecutive strikes constitutes a 900 series. Due to the difficulty of achieving a game of 300 or a series of 900, many Bowling establishments have plaques engraved with 300 and 900 club members. :A player who scores multiple strikes in succession would score like so: ::Frame 1, ball 1: 10 pins (strike) ::Frame 2, ball 1: 10 pins (strike) ::Frame 3, ball 1: 4 pins ::Frame 3, ball 2: 2 pins ::The score from these throws is: :::*Frame one: 10 + (10 + 4)= 24 :::*Frame two: 10 + (4 + 2) = 16 :::*Frame three: 4 + 2 = 6 ::::TOTAL = 46 :The most points that can be scored in a single frame is 30 points (10 for the original strike, plus strikes in the two subsequent frames) :The most points that can be scored in a single game is 300 points which is a perfect game. :A player who bowls a strike in the tenth (final) frame is awarded two extra balls so as to allow the awarding of bonus points. If both these balls also result in ten pins knocked down each, a total of 30 points (10 + 10 + 10) is awarded for the frame. These bonus points do not count on their own, however. They only count as the bonus for the strike. Publications * * References Category:Ten-pin bowling ","title":"Strike (bowling)"},{"id":"10460358","text":"The malia (Malia grata) Collar, N.

The young is duller than adult. It is the only member of the genus Malia. An Indonesian endemic, the malia is restricted to montane forests of Sulawesi. Usually, it is found in pairs or small groups of three to seven birds. The diet consists mainly of insects, beetles and other arthropods. There has been some debate over the taxonomic relationships of the malia. It has some plumage characteristics reminiscent of bulbuls, and has been shifted between that family and the wastebasket taxon Timaliidae sensu lato by past authors. A study published early in 2012 found that the malia was not a babbler; later in the same year, a second study determined that it was instead an aberrant member of the family Locustellidae. Widespread and common in its habitat and range, the malia is evaluated as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

Sir Humphrey de Trafford, 2nd Baronet (1 May 1808 - 4 May 1886) was a prominent English Catholic. Born at Croston Hall near Chorley, Lancashire on 1 May 1808, he was the fourth child and the eldest son of Sir Thomas de Trafford. Early life In 1821 he was entered as a pupil at the Manchester Grammar School and became a boarder in the high master's house. He also studied at Oscott College, a Catholic seminary. In 1826 he entered the Royal Dragoons, becoming a lieutenant in 1830, and retiring in 1832. He is recorded as having placed the last keystone in position for the Victoria Bridge, connecting Manchester and Salford across the River Irwell, on 23 March 1839. On the death of his father, on 10 November 1852, he became the 2nd Baronet de Trafford, 25th Lord of Trafford, and took up residence at the family home of Trafford Hall, in Trafford Park. On 17 January 1855, he married Lady Annette Mary Talbot, eldest sister and co-heiress of Bertram Talbot, 17th Earl of Shrewsbury. The ceremony took place in Rugby, Worcestershire, and was performed by William Bernard Ullathorne, Bishop of Birmingham. It was reportedly the first Roman Catholic nuptial mass to be performed in England since the Reformation. They had five daughters and three sons: * Mildred Mary Josephine (27 March 1856 - 29 December 1934), married Charles Bellew, 3rd Baron Bellew, 8 August 1883. * Humphrey Francis, born 3 July 1862, who became the Third Baronet * Charles Edmund, born 21 May 1864, who played cricket for Lancashire and the MCC, and captained Leicestershire for 17 seasons. Charles married Lady Agnes, daughter of Rudolph Feilding, 8th Earl of Denbigh, on 15 October 1892. Their eldest son, Captain Hubert Edmund de Trafford, was awarded the DSC for heroism during World War I and later emigrated to Malta, his daughter later returned to England and married Admiral Arthur Francis Turner. * Gundrede Annette Teresa (born before 1866), married Sir Timothy Carew O'Brien, 3rd Baronet, also a cricketer, on 22 September 1885. Their daughter was the pioneering pilot Sicele O'Brien. * Mary Annette * Sicele Agnes (22 February 1867 - 5 February 1948). On 2 June 1892 she became the second wife of Charles William Clifford, son of Sir Charles Clifford, the first Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives. * Mary Hilda, who became a nun * Gilbert Talbot Joseph (born 1871/1872 ‚Äì died 15 July 1890, aged 19) The national land survey of 1873 records Sir Humphrey as holding of land in Cheshire, producing an annual gross rental income of ¬£3,361. In 1861 he served as High Sheriff of Lancashire In 1881, he bought Hothorpe Hall in Northamptonshire (though near Theddingworth, Leicestershire), and presented it to his son Charles. The de Traffords purchased the hall from Henry Everett, great-nephew of John Cook, the hall's builder. In 1884, the Lancashire and Cheshire Antiquarian Society, at its meeting on Friday 11 January, recorded the receipt from Sir Humphrey of the head of a stone hammer found in 1860 in a drain ditch at Blackshaw Farm near Alderley Edge. Manchester Ship Canal In 1882, a meeting held at the Didsbury home of engineer Daniel Adamson resulted in the creation of the Manchester Ship Canal committee. Sir Humphrey was an implacable opponent of the proposed canal, which the committee proposed would cross his land at Trafford Park. He objected, among other grounds, that it would bring polluted water close to his residence, interfere with his drainage, and render Trafford Hall uninhabitable, forcing him to \\"give up his home and leave the place\\". Despite his opposition, the Ship Canal Bill became law on 6 August 1885, after two previous Bills had failed to get through Parliament. Sir Humphrey was paralysed in 1884 and never recovered. He died on 4 May 1886, three days after his 78th birthday. Construction of the Manchester Ship Canal began the following year.

The content of the newspaper is varied, ranging from information for all serving personnel of whatever rank or specialisation to Sea Cadets and former shipmates. Members of the public with an interest in the Royal Navy, Royal Marines and the Fleet Air Arm also have access to the newspaper. The newspaper is distributed free to serving personnel (ratio 1:5), and is available to members of the public through subscription or through a newsagent. Up to 35,000 copies are printed each month. Navy News includes sections on news; special features; sport; book reviews; association news; people; charity work; Fleet Focus (where the ships are deployed); 2-6 (for serving personnel); letters and the very popular noticeboard (on which readers can search for old shipmates, notify deaths and reunions or ask a question). In 1998 it was decided to create a website which has been running ever since. It always includes regularly updated news stories as well as notifying readers about reunions; people searches and other features. In April 2007, the first free digital edition of Navy News was launched on the website, and each edition since then has appeared giving free access to readers worldwide; to date over 300 editions have been uploaded. Another popular innovation is the recording of sections of the Navy News, initially recorded onto 90-minute tapes, but now recorded digitally onto memory sticks with no restriction on length of time. This is then distributed by the Portsmouth Area Talking News to visually impaired persons for free, through the ‚ÄòArticles for the Blind‚Äô scheme all over the world. History The paper was founded in 1954 (with ¬£300 from the then Victory Barracks (now HMS Nelson) pigswill fund, the proceeds of 'gash' food from the mess sold to local farmers!) purely to serve the Portsmouth Command, after all Plymouth had its own 'Guzz Gazette' and Chatham had its own 'Chats'. Within a few months Navy News success allowed it to expand to cover the whole of the Senior Service. Today it is estimated to have more than 100,000 readers worldwide, possibly many more, as there is of evidence of how individual copies are passed around whole ship's companies, ex-pat communities and ex-Service associations who use its columns to keep in touch with present developments and old shipmates. Not to mention wives and families and, most of all perhaps, people who are just interested in the Navy and what it does. Embassy attach√©s and media correspondents scan its pages, regularly picking up items they have missed through official lines of communication. There have been some notable scoops over the years including the cancellation of the rum issue ordered by First Sea Lord Admiral Sir Michael 'Dry Ginger' Le Fanu in 1970 and the full integration of the WRNS into the Naval Service in 1993. The newspaper is published on the first of each month and the production run is up to 35,000 copies monthly.

Early life Payne was born in Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk. He came to prominence as one of the most vocal adherents of the methods of Joseph Jacotot in England, publishing in 1830 an exposition of Jacotot's methods and lecturing to other teachers about education while teaching at a school in the New Kent Road, London. In 1838 he established Denmark Hill Grammar School with David Fletcher.  Career  In 1845 he opened the Mansion grammar school, at Leatherhead in Surrey. The school was very successful in exams and followed a detailed curriculum. Initially the pupils studied spelling and writing, history and geography, French, word and object lessons, arithmetic. As they progressed, English grammar, botany, and physics were added and at the age of 12, Latin German, mathematics, English literature, and physics were introduced. Chemistry would be added in the final two years. He retired from teaching in 1868 and began to write various textbooks and criticized elementary education in the England. He was also heavily involved in reforms and believed education could transform society. He was a founding member of the College of Preceptors and became its first Professor of science and art of education in 1873. He was one of the founders of the Women's Education Union, and he was also one of the original shareholders of the Girls' Public Day School Company which was created by the Union. Payne was also a member of the council of the Social Science Association and of the committees of the Kindergarten Association. Payne and Caroline Bishop are credited with founding the Froebel Society.  Family  He married Eliza Dyer in December 1837, and they had four children, John Burnell, Joseph Frank, Mary Eliza and William Payne. His wife died in October 1875 and he retired from the College of Preceptors in December 1875 due to ill health. He died a few months later in April 1876.

Despite its common name, V. nigrum is not closely related to the true hellebores, nor does it resemble them. The plant was widely known even in ancient times. For example, Lucretius (ca. 99 BCE ‚Äì ca. 55 BCE) and Pliny the Elder (23 AD ‚Äì August 25, 79) both knew of its medicinal emetic as well as deadly toxic properties.Lucretius Of the Nature of Things, Thomas Creech, ed., 1714, p. 363. Distribution and habitat Veratrum nigrum is native to Eurasia from France to Korea including Germany, Poland, Russia, China, and Mongolia.Altervista Flora Italiana, Veratro nero, Veratrum nigrum L. includes photos and European distribution mapArmitage, Armitage's Garden Perennials: A Color Encyclopedia, 2000, p. 269. The plant can exist in hardiness zones 4 through 7. It grows best in shade or partial shade, with wet or moist grounds conditions.Raven, The Bold and Brilliant Garden, 1999, p. 59.Hobhouse, Flower Gardens, 2001, p. 206. Any nutrient-rich soil supports its growth,Nicholson, Garrett, and Trail, The Illustrated Dictionary of Gardening, 1887, p. 143.Thomas, \\"The Complete Gardener, 1916, p. 72. although one source observes that it prefers calcium-rich soil.Hulme, Familiar Swiss Flowers, Figured and Described, 1908, p. 207. Another source observes that the bed must be fairly deep. Description The plant has a robust black rhizome. Simple angiosperm leaves arranged in a whorled pattern emerge from the base of the plant. Each whorl is decussate (rotated by half the angle between the leaves in the whorl below), with only two or three whorls around the base. Each leaf is sessile (attaching directly to the plant), and about in length.Beckett, The Concise Encyclopedia of Garden Plants, 1983, p. 418. The leaves are broad, glabrous (smooth), lanceolate in shape, with entire (smooth) edges. The veins in the leaves branch immediately from the base and run parallel through the leaf, leaving a pleated look.Van Dijk, Encyclopedia of Border Plants, 1999, p. 304. Long, green, coarse, woody spike racemes branch off in decussate patterns from the main trunk, with short pedicels supporting a single flower. The flowers are purple-black, giving the plant its name. Veratrum nigrum blooms in early summer for several weeks, but goes dormant in intense summer heat. It tends to grow in colonies, and attains a height of about . Its racemes branch out to about in width. The seed heads are crimson in color. Plants grown from seeds will generally push through the earth and sprout leaves in early spring. Garden use Foliage Veratrum nigrum was used as an ornamental plant in European gardens at least as far back as 1773.Abercrombie and Mawe, Every Man His Own Gardener, 1773, p. 594. It was in common use in 1828,Curtis, General Indexes to the Plants Contained in the First Fifty-Three Volumes of the Botanical Magazine, 1828, p. 711. and Charles Darwin grew it in his garden in the 1840s.Darwin, The Correspondence of Charles Darwin, 1985, p. 299. The plant is still widely used in gardens in Europe and Asia because of its striking black flowers. It is also used to add height to a garden, and as a means of providing a darker backdrop to more brightly colored plants and flowers.Martin, Creating Contrast With Dark Plants, 2000, p. 130-131. The large seed pods weather winter well (tending not to drop in high wind), and it can be a striking winter ornamental seedpod plant as well.Kingsbury, Seedheads in the Garden, 2006, p. 140. However, it is difficult to find and very expensive in the United States. This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Propagation is by seed or by division. However, a plant generally takes seven years to reach maturity and flower. Snails and slugs feed on the plant's rhizomes and leaves, so gardeners must take care to keep these pests away. Toxicity All parts of the plant are highly toxic.Barceloux, Medical Toxicology of Natural Substances, 2008, p. 816. However, the highest concentrations of toxins tend to be in the rhizome. Toxicity varies widely depending on the method of preparation (extract, water extract, etc.), and the method of application. Just per can cause death due to cardiac arrhythmia.Huang, The Pharmacology of Chinese Herbs, 1998, p. 247. Death has even occurred at a dosage as low as .Bensky, Clavey, and St√∂ger, Chinese Herbal Medicine: Materia Medica, 2004, p. 461. Veratrum nigrum contains more than 200 steroid-derived alkaloids, including isorubijervine, jervine, pseudojervine, rubijervine, tienmuliumine, tienmuliluminine, and verazine.Huang, The Pharmacology of Chinese Herbs, 1998, p. 246. The herb causes irritation of mucous membranes. When ingested, the irritation of the mucosal membranes of the stomach and intestines will cause nausea and vomiting. If the herb is introduced to the nose, this mucosal irritation will cause sneezing and coughing. Ingestion can also cause bradycardia (slow heart rate), hyperactivity, and hypotension (low blood pressure). In high concentrations, topical contact can cause skin irritation, excessive tears from the eyes, and redness.Barceloux, Medical Toxicology of Natural Substances, 2008, p. 817. Classic symptoms of Veratrum nigrum toxicity include blurred vision, confusion, headache, lightheadedness, nausea, stomach pain, excessive sweating, and vomiting. In severe cases, heart arrhythmia, muscle cramps, extreme muscle twitching, paresthesia (the feeling of \\"pins and needles\\" all over the body), seizures, weakness, and unconsciousness occur. Death may follow. Toxic symptoms generally resolve themselves after 24 to 48 hours. Supportive treatment for the symptoms is usually administered. Because extreme vomiting occurs, decontamination (e.g., stomach pumping or the ingestion of activated charcoal) is usually not implemented unless ingestion has occurred within one hour. Atropine is usually administered to counteract the low heart rate, and sympathomimetic drugs and liquids administered to raise the blood pressure. The herb is also a known teratogen. However, no data exists on whether it can cause birth defects in human beings. Medicinal usage The dry root of Veratrum nigrum can lower blood pressure and slow heart rate, possibly by stimulating the vagus nerve, if taken in small doses internally. It has been used to treat hypertension and cardiac failure, and to treat pre-eclampsia during pregnancy. It has been found to act as an antibiotic and insecticide. Cyclopamine (11-deoxojervine) is one of the alkaloids isolated from the plant which interferes with the hedgehog signaling pathway (Hh). Cyclopamine is under investigation as a possible treatment for several cancers (such as basal cell carcinoma and medulloblastoma) and skin disorders (such as psoriasis), which result from excessive Hh activity.Barceloux, Medical Toxicology of Natural Substances, 2008, p. 815-816. The dried rhizomes of Veratrum nigrum have been used in Chinese herbalism. All of the false hellebore species are collectively called \\"li lu\\" (ËóúËòÜ) in China. Li lu is administered internally as an emetic, and is also used topically to kill parasites (such as tinea and scabies) or to stop itching. It was most widely used to treat vascular disease. Some herbalists refuse to prescribe li lu internally, citing the extreme difficulty in preparing a safe and effective dosage. Other uses In Asia, an extract of the herb is mixed with water in a 1 percent to 5 percent solution and used in many rural areas to kill fleas, their larvae, and their eggs in toilets.

In common with other joinery companies during the First World War it turned to sub- contract manufacturing of aircraft components. In 1919 shortly after the end of the war the company produced two original designs, the Centaur IV and Centaur IIA. The aircraft were built at the company works at Kilburn,http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1916/1916%20-%200734.html London. The first aircraft were flown from a field next to the factory, but later aircraft were test flown and operated from Northolt Aerodrome.

He is considered the first post-Soviet designer to bring a contemporary Russian look to the international fashion world, wowing critics with sumptuous theatricality as well as wearable styles. His designs have been exhibited in museums such as the Mus√©e de la mode et du textile in Paris, the California Museum of Fashion in Los Angeles, the Metropolitan Museum in New York, and the State Historical Museum in Moscow. In 2010, he redesigned Russia's military uniforms, creating 85 designs to dress all branches of the Russian armed services. Nevertheless, the uniforms turned out to be absolutely useless, causing supercooling of many soldiers in the following winter. Also the quality was unbearable ‚Äì the uniforms ripped apart very quickly and lost their colours after a very short period of time. Yudashkin said that the bad version of the uniform had not been made by him.

Architecture View poolside in the Pousada da Ria The Pousada is located along the southern arm of the isthmus between the municipality of Murtosa and Aveiro, between the beaches of S√£o Jacinto (along the coast) and the protected natural reserve of the Ria estuary.The Nature Reserve of S√£o Jacinto (), with an area of, was created by Decree in 1979, with the aim of preserving the sand dunes and the areas flora and fauna. It is a zone of transitional watercourses, between the interior waterways and the Atlantic coast. It is situated in the civil parish of Torreira known for its local architecture that includes the Chapel of S√£o Paio and the parochial church.The Chapel of S√£o Paio, dates from 1878, but was remodelled and renovated three times, since the two previous incarnations collapsed due to unstable terrain. The current building was remodelled in 1995, and includes a well-preserved 18th century altarpiece and sculptures from the 16th and 18th centuries. The hostel conforms to a \\"L\\"-shape plan, of articulated spaces and covered in tile. This includes a principal 2-storey body that runs parallel to the river, with various varandas and terraces over the water. Along the same orientation is a body that is one-storey, but withdrawn, that corresponds to the laundry and ancillary annexes. At the intersection, is a narrow, two-storey body with the ground floor occupied by support services and the second-floor by guest rooms. The Pousada includes 20 rooms (including two suites) with views of the Ria de Aveiro, where it is common to observe the traditional work of the Moliceiros (the fishermen that guide the traditional Aveiro boats) and the fishing along the Ria. The characteristics of the Ria also allow it to be a prime spot for boat trips and water sports. This pousada has no real historical significance; in fact, it is more along the lines of a two-storey inn and very hotel-like.

He is a former member of the Jimmyz stable, where he was known by the ring name Ryo \\"Jimmy\\" Saito. His name is sometimes abbreviated as SaiRyo, so as not to confuse him with SAITO. Professional wrestling career =Toryumon= Ryo Saito debuted in 1999 as a fourth term student. He fought in that year's Young Dragons Cup, but lost in the finals to the newly-heel Yasushi Kanda. In 2000, he divided his time between Japan and Mexico, and in Japan he adopted the gimmick of a bicycling enthusiast, wearing a professional bicycler's outfit, helmet, and glasses and coming to the ring on a bicycle. He became something of a jobber, losing nearly 20 opening matches in a row to Kenichiro Arai. He also participated in that year's Young Dragons Cup, and made it to the finals again, but lost to the man who became his greatest foil, Milano Collection A.T. When he returned to Japan, his bicycle was stolen by Sumo \\"Dandy\\" Fuji 2000, starting up a feud between them that led into 2001. Saito eventually managed to win his bicycle back, and he and the now-renamed Big Fuji started teaming on and off as the Bicycle Brothers for the next couple of years. 2001 was also the year when Saito finally broke out of his small role and achieved some championship success. On August 14, he teamed with Magnum TOKYO and Dragon Kid to win the UWA World Trios Championship from CIMA, SUWA, and Big Fuji of Crazy MAX, and on September 30, he beat Susumu Mochizuki for the NWA World Welterweight Title. His momentum came to a halt in late 2001 when the T2P class arrived in Japan, and he spent the next few months losing to Milano Collection A.T. and feuding with the newly-heel Genki Horiguchi. It was during this time that he formed a close friendship with T2P student Anthony W. Mori. In 2002, Saito began to make a heel turn. He, along with Dragon Kid, aligned with Darkness Dragon after he lost a mask vs. mask match to Dragon Kid on September 8 and was booted out of M2K, joining the Do Fixer unit that Darkness created. On October 28, Magnum Tokyo sealed M2K after Yasushi Kanda retired, and later that night he revealed that he and the other members were the real Do Fixer, along with the newly renamed K-ness. K-ness had been sent into the home army as a spy to cause problems within it, and it worked in that Saito was not welcomed back into the home army. Because of this, he decided to actively pursue gaining membership into Do Fixer. He abandoned his bicyclist character, smashing up his bike with a chair, but he could not pass leader Magnum Tokyo's dance test and was denied entrance. That all changed in December when he debuted his own personal and bizarre dance called the \\"SaiRyo Dance\\", and Magnum Tokyo, pleased with it, allowed him to join should he pass one more test, which was a match on December 20 where he and the other Do Fixer members faced Masaaki Mochizuki, Kenichiro Arai, Raimu Mishima, Takamichi Iwasa, and Anthony W. Mori in an elimination match. Towards the end, Magnum eliminated himself, leaving just Ryo and his friend Mori as the final two. Saito proved his allegiance to Do Fixer by betraying Mori, smacking him with a black box and winning the match. 2003 went by quite uneventfully for Saito. He acted as the main H-A-G-E call cheerleader for stablemate Genki Horiguchi, and he was derailed by injuries. =Dragon Gate= Saito in Oxford, November 2009 2004 was also another injury-plagued year, but he began to turn face again, aiding his old friend Mori in his feud with Takuya Sugawara. He helped him overcome the shock of Sugawara's betrayal, and when Mori lost a hair vs. hair match, Saito took the haircut for him. 2005 brought about a major resurgence in his career. He opened the first show of the year on January 9 by pinning CIMA in a six-man tag match. Then, when he appealed for a shot at the Open the Dream Gate title, held by Masaaki Mochizuki, he was given a January 14 singles match with Milano Collection A.T. as a hurdle, and he defeated Milano after four years of losses to him. He failed to win the Open the Dream Gate title in the February 6 match. He spent the remainder of the year garnering high-profile victories, as well as two Open the Triangle Gate Championship reigns with Genki Horiguchi and Dragon Kid, and when Magnum began to move down a different path with his Renaissance project, he named Saito the new leader of Do Fixer. Saito then won a feud with CIMA, and in December he won the inaugural King of Gate Tournament. His momentum continued right into February 2006, when he beat Magnitude Kishiwada to win the Open the Dream Gate Championship and became the ace of the promotion. His quick ascent to the top was not entirely accepted by the fans, and thus his career went downhill after his title victory. He dropped the championship to Susumu Yokosuka in his first defense, and though he had a third Open the Triangle Gate title reign with Genki and Dragon Kid, things were quiet for him for the rest of the year. He made it to the finals of that year's King of Gate Tournament again, but lost to Masaaki Mochizuki. In February 2007, Genki Horiguchi betrayed Do Fixer to join the Muscle Outlaw'z, so Ryo decided to end Do Fixer activity and follow the only other remaining member Dragon Kid into CIMA's Typhoon stable. In Typhoon, he reunited with Susumu Yokosuka to form the RyoSuka team. Despite achieving some success in the tag ranks, most notably winning the WAR I-J Heavyweight Tag Team Championship in July from Jado and Gedo and two more reigns as Open the Triangle Gate champion with CIMA and Susumu, Ryo continued to slide further in rank. In 2008, Ryo began to regain rank in the promotion. He took offense to CIMA putting down the Open the Brave Gate title after he challenged for it, causing some strife within Typhoon. It resulted in Ryo challenging CIMA for the Open the Dream Gate title on April 27, and though Ryo lost, their issues were reconciled afterwards. On May 5, Ryo and Susumu achieved further success with their team when they won the Open the Twin Gate titles from Kenichiro Arai and Taku Iwasa of Tozawa-juku. They dropped the championship to inaugural champions Speed Muscle (Naruki Doi and Masato Yoshino) on September 26. On December 28, he was without a unit after he, Dragon Kid, and Susumu Yokosuka lost a Unit Split survival three-way six-man tag team match to teams from WORLD-1 and Real Hazard, ending Typhoon. He continued to team with Susumu, and also made attempts to form his own unit. On February 15, 2009, he ended up joining a unit instead, turning heel and aligning with Real Hazard after turning on Susumu during an attempt on the Open the Twin Gate titles held by YAMATO and Cyber Kong. Upon joining Real Hazard he reformed his tag team with Genki Horiguchi, and they won the Open the Twin Gate Championship on May 5, 2009, in a three-way match, which included Real Hazard stablemates Kenichiro Arai and Yasushi Kanda. On June 26, when YAMATO defected from Real Hazard, he assumed the leadership role in the stable. His title reign with Horiguchi ended on September 17, when they lost the belts to Shingo Takagi and YAMATO. On December 3, Susumu Yokosuka turned heel and joined Real Hazard, and they reformed their team, but their reunion plans were quickly derailed when Saito sustained a ruptured Achilles tendon, sidelining him. On February 27, 2010, Genki Horiguchi joined up with the Warriors stable after leaving Real Hazard two weeks earlier, and as a condition of him joining, Saito was brought out of Real Hazard and into Warriors. Saito turned heel on January 14, 2011, along with the rest of Warriors, when they attacked Masato Yoshino and World-1, and joined forces with Naruki Doi's group. On January 18 the new group was named Blood Warriors. On February 6, 2011, Saito and his Blood Warriors stablemate Genki Horiguchi defeated Don Fujii and Masaaki Mochizuki to win the Open the Twin Gate Championship. They lost the title to rival group Junction Three representatives Dragon Kid and PAC on June 19, 2011. On February 9, 2012, new Blood Warriors leader Akira Tozawa kicked Saito and Horiguchi out of the group.

The projected image has not been keystone-corrected to be rectangular. The keystone effect is the apparent distortion of an image caused by projecting it onto an angled surface. It is the distortion of the image dimensions, such as making a square look like a trapezoid, the shape of an architectural keystone, hence the name of the feature. In the typical case of a projector sitting on a table, and looking upwards to the screen, the image is larger at the top than on the bottom. Some areas of the screen may not be focused correctly as the projector lens is focused at the average distance only. In photography, the term is used to describe the apparent leaning of buildings towards the vertical centerline of the photo when shooting upwards, a common effect in Architectural photography. Likewise, when taking photos looking down, e.g., from a skyscraper, buildings appear to get broader towards the top. The effect is usually corrected for by either using special lenses in Tilt‚Äìshift photography or in post-processing using modern image editing software. Brooklyn Bridge keystoning  Theory  The distortion suffered by the image depends on the angle of the projector to the screen, and the beam angle. The distortion (on a two-dimensional model, and for small focus angles) is best approximated by: :\\\\frac{\\\\cos\\\\left(\\\\varepsilon - \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{2}\\\\right)}{\\\\cos\\\\left(\\\\varepsilon + \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{2}\\\\right)} where \\\\epsilon is the angle between the screen axis and the central ray from the projector, and \\\\alpha is the width of the focus. From the formula, it is clear that there will be no distortion when \\\\epsilon is zero, or perpendicular to the screen.  Keystone effect in stereo imaging  In stereo imaging, two lenses are used to view the same subject image, each from a slightly different perspective, allowing a three-dimensional view of the subject. If the two images are not exactly parallel, this causes a keystone effect. This is particularly noticeable when the lenses are close to the subject, as with a stereo microscope,Introduction to stereo microscopy but is also a common problem with many 3D stereo camera lenses.  Solving the problem  The problem arises for screen projectors that don't have the depth of focus necessary to keep all lines (from top to bottom) focused at the same time. Common solutions to this problem are: * moving the projector more to the center of the screen, * tilting the screen in a small angle, * the use of special software on the projector * and computer controlling the projector.  Correction  Keystone correction, colloquially also called keystoning, is a function that allows multimedia projectors that are not placed perpendicular to the horizontal centerline of the screen (too high or too low) to skew the output image, thereby making it rectangular. It is often necessary for a projector to be placed in a position outside the line perpendicular to the screen and going through the screen's center, for example, when the projector is mounted to a ceiling or placed on a table top that is lower or higher than the projection screen. Most ceiling-mounted projectors have to be mounted upside down to accommodate for the throw of the image from the lens, with the image rotated right-side-up with software. Keystone correction is a feature included with many projectors that provides the ability to intentionally \\"distort\\" the output image to recreate the original rectangular image provided by the video or computer source, thus eliminating the skewed output that would otherwise result due to angled projection. The ability to correct horizontal keystone distortion is generally only available on larger or professional level projectors. In most consumer units, this is easily corrected by moving the projector left or right as necessary, or less often by lens shifting, with similar principles as Tilt‚Äìshift photography. = Functionality = In modern projectors keystone correction technology is performed digitally (rather than optically) via the internal (LCD) panels or (DLP) mirrors of the projector, depending on the technology used. Thus, when applying keystone correction to an image, the number of individual pixels used is reduced, lowering the resolution and thus degrading the quality of the image projected. Home theater enthusiasts would argue that keystoning should not be used because of the impact it has on image quality. However, it is a useful technology in cases where the projector cannot be mounted directly in front of the screen, or on projectors utilizing lens shift technology where the projector must be mounted outside the frame of the screen.

It is a lottery-type drawing, operated on a regional basis using the daily state lottery draw, by mobsters known as contraventores, bicheiros or banqueiros (\\"bankers\\"). Despite its popularity, especially in Rio de Janeiro, it is illegal in 25 of the 26 states of Brazil and those involved may be prosecuted. Para√≠ba is the only state where the game is legal and regulated by the state, even though federal law prohibits gambling. Unlike most state- operated lotteries, in Jogo do bicho any amount can be wagered. History The originator of jogo do bicho was baron Jo√£o Batista Viana Drummond, a Brazilian-born Englishman, to whom Emperor Dom Pedro II awarded a title and the concession to the Rio de Janeiro zoo in the late 19th century. As a publicity measure, Drummond encouraged visitors to guess the identity of an animal concealed behind a curtain, and paid prizes off to winners. In time the guessing game became a tremendously popular numbers game, with different numbers assigned to 25 animals.Jogo do Bicho, Time Magazine, October 29, 1945 Bets were soon being made by people outside the zoo. Within months, government authorities made its first attempt to shut down the game, but it simply shifted to the city, an environment in which it has thrived ever since. Rudyard Kipling, visiting Rio in the 1920s, wrote of seeing bookies wandering the streets carrying placards with colourful pictures of animals. The game is said to have become popular because it accepted bets of any amount, in a time when most Brazilians struggled to survive a very deep economic crisis. \\"If you see two shacks lost somewhere in the backlands,\\" a Brazilian diplomat once observed, \\"you can bet that a bicheiro lives in one of them and a steady bettor in the other.\\" For the following decades official policy fluctuated between tolerance of the game, sometimes motivated by corruption, and intermittent campaigns to crack down on gambling. In 1946, gambling was prohibited by federal law, but the game continued to thrive in illegality. A crackdown on the game by S√£o Paulo police in 1966 nearly paralysed the city. More than 60,000 men were idled. By that time it had grown into a US$500 million-a-year business that employed roughly 1% of Brazil's total working force. The crisis was quietly resolved in return for unspecified concessions. Since the early 1990s, bicheiros have expanded their activities to bingo parlors, video poker and slot machines, known in Brazil as \\"nickel hunters\\" (ca√ßa-n√≠queis). It was reported by the New York Times in 2007 that it was played everywhere in Brazil, and especially in Rio de Janeiro, from where the scheme was operated by about a dozen bosses, called bicheiros.Brazilian Numbers Game Ties Officials to Mobsters, by Larry Rohter, The New York Times, June 7, 2007 = In Para√≠ba = Para√≠ba is the only state where the game has been legalized at the state level, despite the federal law that prohibits it. The game is regulated by the State Lottery of Para√≠ba (LOTEP), which licenses banqueiros as lottery agents, to avoid the game's association with organized crime, as in Rio de Janeiro. The state capital, Jo√£o Pessoa, has 15 authorized points. Each point pays a region-dependent monthly tax to LOTEP, depending on its business volume. The draw is made three times a day in the LOTEP building and released by the official state radio. Folha destaca apoio do Governo ao jogo do bicho na Para√≠ba, Paraiba.com.br, May 5, 2007 Criminal charges and political connections Because it deals with large sums of sounding money, out of reach of government control, the game has attracted the attention of corrupt officials, who may ally with the bosses. Bosses are generally interested in buying the leniency of the government or the removal from office of people active on the game's repression. To foster public support, the bosses have invested part of their enormous earnings in activities, like the financing of samba schools and football clubs. From the early 1970s until now, nearly all of the Rio de Janeiro samba schools are under the control of bicho bosses (bicheiros). Two soccer clubs famous for their association with such bosses were Bangu (with Castor de Andrade) and Botafogo (with Emil Pinheiro). Denise Frossard \\"The animal game is a deeply embedded cultural phenomenon with a certain romantic aura, and thus hard to eradicate,\\" according to Denise Frossard, a former judge who became famous for sending 14 bicheiros to jail in 1993. \\"But it is also a quintessentially Brazilian way of laundering money and contributes greatly to the problem of impunity in this country.\\" The bicheiros were arrested for criminal association and forming armed gangs. According to prosecutor Ant√¥nio Carlos Biscaia, the bicheiros built an association with the principal goal to corrupt authorities and cops and the elimination of 130 people. The superintendent of this association was Castor de Andrade. A volta dos bicheiros , by Ant√¥nio Carlos Biscaia, O Globo, March 22, 1998 They were sentenced to six years each, the maximum sentence for racketeering. But in December 1996 they were all back on the streets, granted parole or clemency. In March, 1994, police raided the stronghold of Castor de Andrade in Bangu. They seized 200 account books and 167 computer diskettes. Former president Fernando Collor de Mello, Rio governor Nilo Batista, S√£o Paulo mayor Paulo Maluf, Rio mayor Cesar Maia, seven entrepreneurs, three judges, 12 congressmen and seven assemblymen, 25 police commissioners and 100 police officers were implicated.Mafia: Never ending mud, News from Brazil, May 31, 1994 Investiga√ß√£o liga autoridades a bingos, Jornal do Brasil, August 30, 2003 Bicheiros Antonio Petrus Kalil, or Turc√£o, An√≠sio Abra√£o David, or An√≠sio, and Capit√£o Guimar√£es, at the time president of the Independent League of Samba Schools of Rio de Janeiro, were among 24 people arrested on April 12, 2007, for alleged involvement with illegal numbers games, bingo parlors and the distribution of slot machines. Raids by the Federal Police have uncovered big payoffs to judges, police officers, prosecutors and lawyers from the bosses who run the game. Mounds of documents have been seized and US$6 million in cash has been confiscated.Brazil police crack down on gambling, Associated Press, April 13, 2007 The possibility of legalisation has been often been argued, but no practical decision ever made. Structure Since its early inception the game has preserved a hierarchy: operators (banqueiros), managers (gerentes) and dealers (vendedores). This same hierarchy was later reproduced in the organisation of drug-trafficking and other types of organised crime in Brazil. Bets are taken at pontos (points-of-sale) where dealers collect money and keep record of the bets. The bets (and the money) are sent to the central operator (banca), where the draw is done. All it takes is a scribbled note or a phone call to any of the thousands of bicheiros who haunt the street corners, shops and offices of every city, easily identified by their sunglasses, cigars and/or typical floral or printed shirts. Neither the pontos nor the bancas need a fixed operational centre. Most pontos are simple stools or wooden boxes on which the dealers sit through the day. Drawings are usually held at 2 PM in local bicho headquarters, and the winning numbers are immediately dispatched by taxi and bicycle and scribbled in chalk on designated walls and lampposts. Phone lines become so clogged after each drawing that telephone company executives call it \\"the bicho hour.\\" The draw is not fair: if too many people bet on a given number, it is removed from the lot to prevent the quebra da banca (bankruptcy). This is necessary because most bancas operate with slim resources and their owners do not want to invest their personal assets to pay the bets.  Description  =Animals= The name of the game arises from the mnemonic association of the drawn numbers with a random selection of 25 animals: * 1 - Avestruz (Ostrich) * 2 - √Åguia (Eagle) * 3 - Burro (Donkey) * 4 - Borboleta (Butterfly) * 5 - Cachorro (Dog) * 6 - Cabra (Goat) * 7 - Carneiro (Ram) * 8 - Camelo (Camel) * 9 - Cobra (Snake) * 10 - Coelho (Rabbit) * 11 - Cavalo (Horse) * 12 - Elefante (Elephant) * 13 - Galo (Rooster) * 14 - Gato (Cat) * 15 - Jacar√© (Caiman) * 16 - Le√£o (Lion) * 17 - Macaco (Monkey) * 18 - Porco (Pig) * 19 - Pav√£o (Peacock) * 20 - Peru (Turkey) * 21 - Touro (Bull) * 22 - Tigre (Tiger) * 23 - Urso (Bear) * 24 - Veado (Deer) * 25 - Vaca (Cow) =Superstition= Over the decades, superstitious theory has evolved around selecting the proper animal, much of it involving dreams. Horse, for example, can be indicated by a dream of a horse, or by dreams of wheat or milk or naked women.Brazil's President May Lose Big On The Lottery, by Shawn Blore, Globe and Mail, February 28, 2004 The elephant has come to be associated with death, and whenever there is a fatal traffic accident involving a car with one of the elephant's numbers (45-48) on its license plates, the betting is unusually heavy. When the Rio papers published the picture of a derailed locomotive in the 1960s, so many bet on the last four figures of its registration number that the bicheiros were forced to warn that they could not pay off at the usual odds if it won.The Animal Game, Time Magazine, March 25, 1966 =Bets and prizes= Each of the 25 animals is assigned a sequence of four consecutive numbers between 1 and 100. The most common way to play is to bet one real on an animal, but one can also choose a combination of numbers and numerals designated by an animal. The traditional four types of prizes are as follows: * Cabe√ßa (\\"head\\"): A bet on four numbers between 00 and 99, represented by an animal; returns 25:1. * Dezena (\\"tens\\"): A bet on a number from 00 to 99; returns 100:1. * Centena (\\"hundreds\\"): A bet on a number from 000 to 999; returns 1000:1. * Milhar (\\"thousands\\"): A bet on a number from 0000 to 9999; returns 10000:1. If the last two numerals in the daily state lottery draw form one of the four numbers associated with an animal, a bicheiro will pay out 15 reais for a bet of 1 real. Cultural impact Despite its illegality, the game has left significant cultural influences in Brazilian society, even among people that have never played it. Jogo do bicho is responsible for the strong association of the number 24 with homosexuality in Brazil. In the game, 24 is the number given to the deer (veado in Portuguese), an animal that has long been pejoratively associated with gay men.Brazil in the International Encyclopedia of SexualityThe Alternative Portuguese Dictionary , accessed April 9, 2011 The jersey number 24 is heavily avoided by male Brazilian athletes, with rare exceptions. Football players, for example, usually reject this number for their jerseys, and may express dissatisfaction when obligated to wear a 24 jersey due to fixed number rules in international competitions. No futebol brasileiro ningu√©m quer usar a camisa 24. Qual o problema dela?, UOL, July 2, 2015 24 is also used in politics, as many LGBT candidates include 24 in their campaign numbers, to be easily associated with LGBT movement causes. Candidatos usam \\"24\\" para causa gay, Terra, August 25, 2012 For the same reason, the number is seldom used by heterosexual politicians, whether or not they have an anti-LGBT agenda. In the Brazilian Senate, for example, although there are 81 Senators, no one currently has a cabinet numbered 24, nor a car plate numbered SF-0024 (the Senators' plate options go from SF-0001 to SF-0095, and any available number can be freely chosen). Na m√≠stica dos n√∫meros no Senado n√£o cabe 24 nem 69, HuffPost, January 24, 2016 Another legacy of Jogo do Bicho is the use of zebra meaning upset.Zebra in WordReference.com Dicion√°rio Portugu√™s-Ingl√™s In 1964, before a football match between Portuguesa (RJ) and Vasco da Gama, the manager of Portuguesa, a much weaker team, was asked if he could defeat Vasco. Gentil Cardoso, the manager, commented that beating Vasco would be like drawing a zebra in Jogo do Bicho. Brasil Afora: Portuguesa espera ventos favor√°veis para se reerguer, Globo esporte, December 12, 2010 As there is no zebra in the game, his sentence expressed an impossibility. However, Portuguesa did win that game (by 2-1), and since then the term zebra is used in Brazil for sports upsets. Treze Futebol Clube, a football club from Para√≠ba, has a rooster as their mascot, because Treze means thirteen, and the rooster is the 13th animal of the Jogo do bicho. Mascotes paraibanos, Treze Futebol Clube website Another football team with the rooster as its mascot is Clube Atl√©tico Mineiro, whose supporters expected 2013 to be the \\"year of the rooster\\", also because the rooster is the 13th animal.

The montane guinea pig is the likely ancestor of Cavia porcellus, the domestic cavy or domestic guinea pig. Taxonomy Peruvian wild guinea pigs were first described by E. T. Bennett in 1835, who termed them Cavia cutleri. Johann Jakob von Tschudi, in an 1845 publication, used the term Cavia cutleri to refer to what are now considered two separate entities - the first, Bennett's Cavia cutleri, which was later (by Oldfield Thomas in 1917) identified as probably a differently pigmented version of Cavia porcellus, and the second, a wild Peruvian guinea pig that was clearly different from the animal Bennett described. In 1867, Leopold Fitzinger renamed the latter guinea pig Cavia tschudii. Description The montane guinea pig is a medium-sized species, growing to a total length of . The colour varies in different parts of the range; in Peru, the dorsal fur is dark reddish-brown mixed with black, and the underparts are dark buffy-grey; in Chile, the dorsal surface is pale agouti brown with paler underparts; in Bolivia, the upper parts are agouti olive and the underparts creamy-white or white. Distribution and habitat The montane guinea pig is native to the high Andes in South America. Its range extends from Peru southward to the Tarapac√° Region of Chile and the Tucum√°n Province of Argentina. Its altitudinal range is above sea level. It lives in moist habitats with rocks and coarse vegetation, making runways through the foliage. In Argentina it lives in burrows with several entrances. Lifecycle The montane guinea pig has a gestation period around 63 days. Litter size ranges from one to four, and the young grow quickly, becoming mature at two months of age.

Writing  As a writer, Lafourcade has published at least 24 novels (over 30 by some accounts) and over a dozen anthologies and collections of short stories and essays.Enrique Lafourcade, official website (Sitio Oficial), http://www.enriquelafourcade.cl Cafe Literarte, Enrique Lafourcade, http://www.cabalgata.com/lafourcade/enrique His novel Palomita Blanca (1971) sold over a million copies, making it one of the all-time best sellers in Chile.

Journalism  Self-described as \\"a sentimental anarchist and catholic in a state of wilderness\\", it is as a journalist and critic that Lafourcade is best known. For years he has written an editorial for the newspaper El Mercurio (the largest in the country), focusing on literature but with incursions into politics, cultural issues and subjects of impact upon the nation. Some of his most critical articles, written in an often mordant style, have produced the ire of dictators and politicians in Chile and other Latin American countries and occasionally generated diplomatic apologies. He has appeared in numerous television programs, both as guest and as part of recurring panels of cultural critics. His ironic and often sarcastic style as well as his impudent way of offering opinions on just about everything and everybody has more than once produced a commotion in the country, making \\"Lafourcade\\" a household name in Chile. Numerous anecdotes surround his name, including engaging in a fist fight with another journalist during a live television program. For some time he wrote a gastronomic review under the name of \\"Conde de Lafourchette\\" (\\"fourchette\\" meaning \\"fork\\" in French) in the journal El Mercurio, where he gave his uncensored opinion about restaurants and their food, reason for which he is feared by restaurant owners across the country. Allegedly, waiters are instructed to call upon the owner or general manager as soon as they see Lafourcade walking in. In 1997 he published the book \\"La cocina er√≥tica del conde Lafourchette (The Erotic Cuisine of Count Lafourchette)\\".La cocina er√≥tica del conde Lafourchette, by Enrique Lafourcade, LOM Ediciones, Santiago, February 1997. He has publicly declared himself an \\"unrelenting enemy of ignorance and incompetence.\\" He is believed to have just as many enemies as he has friends, to the point that for years rumors circulated of a group of people gathering signatures to \\"expel Lafourcade from Chile\\".  Personal life According to public records, Lafourcade was married three times: with Chilean-born Canadian artist Maria Luisa Segnoret; with Chilean writer and journalist Marcela Godoy Divin; and recently with Chilean painter Rossana Pizarro Garcia, with whom he has reportedly lived for nearly 20 years now.El Mercurio, Artes y Letras: Animales Literarios, by Rossana Pizarro, 9 September 2001.

She commanded over 1800 junks (traditional Chinese sailing ships) manned by 60,000 to 80,000 pirates‚Äîmen, women, and even children. She entered into conflict with major nations, such as the British Empire, the Portuguese Empire, and the Qing dynasty.Lily Xiao Hong Lee, A. D. Stefanowska, Clara Wing-chung Ho - 2003 - 387 pages Ching Shih and her crew's exploits have since been featured in numerous books, novels, video games, and films about piracy, pirates and their way of life in China as well as worldwide. Based on her tremendous influence and achievements as a pirate and commanding the vast fleet of around 1500-1800 ships manned by 80,000 sailors during her peak, she is widely accepted to be the most successful pirate in history.  Early life  She was born Shih Yang (Áü≥ÈôΩ) in 1775 in Guangdong province. She was a Cantonese prostitute or madame nicknamed Shih Heang Koo () who worked in a floating brothel (Ëä±Ëàπ) in Guangzhou. In 1801, she married Cheng I, a notorious pirate. Marriage to Cheng I The Cheng family genealogy Cheng I was from a family of notorious pirates whose roots trace back to the mid-17th century. Sources differ on Cheng I's motivation for marriage: some argue that he became infatuated with Shih Heang Koo, while others argue that the union was purely as a business move intended to consolidate power. Either way, Shih Heang Koo is said to have agreed to lend her powers of intrigue, as it were, to her husband's endeavours by formal contract, which granted her a 50% control and share. Following their marriage, Shih \\"who participated fully in her husband's piracy,\\" was known as Cheng I Sao (). They adopted Cheung Po as their step-son, making him Cheng's fully legal heir. Cheng also bore two more sons: Cheng Ying Shih () and Cheng Heung Shih (). Cheng I used military assertion and his reputation to bind former rivalling Cantonese pirate fleets into an alliance. Cheng 1 and Ching Shih formed a massive coalition from unifying small gangs into a federation of 70,000 men and 400 junk ships. Their coalition consisted of six fleets known by the colors of blue, red, green, black, white, and yellow. By 1804, this coalition was a formidable force, and one of the most powerful pirate fleets in all of China; by this time they were known as the Red Flag Fleet. Ascension to leadership On 16 November 1807, Cheng I died in Vietnam at the age of 39. Ching Shih immediately began maneuvering her way into his leadership position. She took control of her late husband's pirate fleet and by 1809, she commanded over 800 large junks, and 1,000 smaller ones. She also commanded over 70,000 men and women in her pirate crew. She commanded the Red Flag Fleet and controlled South China‚Äôs seas. She earned the trust of her lieutenants by sharing her power with them. With these men under her, the gang collected money, raided camps and ships, and raided Chinese river towns and coastal villages demanding a contribution, and quickly grew in power. Madame Ching and her crew escaped every attempt by the government to get her band of pirates under control and was eventually offered amnesty for her crimes and offered her pirates ranking in the Imperial Navy.\\"PIRATE QUEEN: A STORY OF ZHENG YI SAO.\\" Kirkus Reviews LXXXVIII, no. 1 (Jan 01, 2020). She started to cultivate personal relationships to get rivals to recognize her status and solidify her authority. She acted quickly to solidify the partnership with her adopted son Cheung Po with intimacy.Lu K'un, Ch'eng, Kwang-tung hai-fang hui- lan (An Examination of Kwangtung's Sea Defense) In order to stop her rivals before open conflict erupted, she sought the support of the most powerful members of her husband's family: his nephew Ching Pao-yang and his cousin's son Ching Ch'i. Then she drew on the coalition formed by her husband by building upon some of the fleet captains' existing loyalties to her husband and making herself essential to the remaining captains. In order to remain in control of the federation, Ching Shih seduced her step-son Cheung Po. She chose him due to his loyalties and ties to Cheng I, thus securing a leader who would be loyal to her and accepted by the lower ranking pirates. Code of laws Once she held the fleet's leadership position, Ching Shih started the task of uniting the fleet by issuing a code of laws. The Neumann translation of The History of Pirates Who Infested the China Sea claims that it was Cheung Po Tsai that issued the code. Yuan Yung-lun says that Cheung issued his own code of three regulations, called san-t'iao, for his own fleet, but these are not known to exist in a written form. The code was very strict and according to Richard Glasspoole, strictly enforced. 1) Anyone giving their own orders (ones that didn't come down from Ching Shih) or disobeying those of a superior was beheaded on the spot. 2) No one was to steal from the public fund or any villagers that supplied the pirates. 3) All goods taken as booty had to be presented for group inspection. The booty was registered by a purser and then distributed by the fleet leader. The original seizer received 20% and the rest was placed into the public fund. 4) Actual money was turned over to the squadron leader, who only gave a small amount back to the seizer, so the rest could be used to purchase supplies for unsuccessful ships. According to Philip Maughan, the punishment for a first-time offense of withholding booty was severe whipping of the back. Large amounts of withheld treasure or subsequent offenses carried the death penalty. Ching Shih's code had special rules for female captives. Standard practice was to release women, but J.L. Turner witnessed differently. Usually the pirates made their most beautiful captives their concubines or wives. If a pirate took a wife he had to be faithful to her. The ones deemed unattractive were released and any remaining were ransomed. Pirates that raped female captives were put to death, but if pirates had consensual sex with captives, the pirate was beheaded and the woman he was with had cannonballs attached to her legs and was thrown over the side of the boat. Violations of other parts of the code were punished with flogging, clapping in irons, or quartering. Deserters or those who had left without official permission had their ears chopped off, and then were paraded around their squadron. Glasspoole concluded that the code \\"gave rise to a force that was intrepid in attack, desperate in defense, and unyielding even when outnumbered.\\" Pirate career The fleet under her command established hegemony over many coastal villages, in some cases even imposing levies and taxes on settlements. According to Robert Antony, Ching Shih \\"robbed towns, markets, and villages, from Macau to Canton.\\" In one coastal village, the Sanshan village, they beheaded 80 men and abducted their women and children and held them for ransom until they were sold in slavery. In January 1808, the Chinese government tried to destroy her fleet in a series of fierce battles. However, Ching Shih managed to pillage and take over the government ships. The government had to revert to only using fishing vessels for battle. At the same time that the government was attacking her, Ching Shih faced a larger threat in the form of other pirate fleets. One in particular was O-po-tae, a former allied-pirate who began working with the Qing government, that forced them to retreat from the coast. For years, the Red Flag Fleet under Ching Shih's rule could not be defeated, neither by Qing dynasty Chinese officials nor by Portuguese or British bounty hunters. She captured Richard Glasspoole, an officer of the East India Company ship The Marquis of Ely, and seven British sailors in 1809. In September and November 1809, Ching Shih and Cheung Po Tsai fleet suffered a series of defeats inflicted by the Portuguese Navy at the Battle of the Tiger's Mouth and there was no way they would be able to hold out forever. In their final battle in the Naval Battle of Chek Lap Kok 1810, they surrendered to the Portuguese Navy on January 21 and later accepted an amnesty offered by the Qing Imperial government to all pirates who agreed to surrender, ending their career and allowed to keep the loot that same year.Andrea J. Buchanan, Miriam Peskowitz-2007-279 page This amnesty allowed only 60 pirates to be banished, 151 to be exiled, and only 126 to be put to death out of her whole fleet of 17,318 pirates. The remaining pirates only had to surrender their weapons. Cheung Po Tsai changed back to his former name, and was repatriated to the Qing Dynasty government. He became a captain in the Qing's Guangdong navy. That is one story. However, the Portuguese version does not match in terms of dates or much else two other sources, the Chinese narrative of Yuan Yonglun, the Jinghai Fenji that was translated and published in English in 1831 or Richard Glasspoole's narrative of his capture, made as an official report to the East India Company, which appears as an appendix to Neumann's translation and various other contemporary and later sources. From these two sources it seems clear that the Portuguese narrative, not published until twenty years later has significant errors. Late life and death Upon being pardoned for her life as a pirate, Ching Shih negotiated for Cheung Po to retain several ships, including approximately 120 to be used for employment on the salt trade. She also arranged for Cheung Po and other pirates in the fleets to be given positions in the Chinese bureaucracy. Ching Shih also requested that the government officially recognize her as the wife of Cheung Po. Despite the restrictions against widows remarrying, her request was granted as the wife of a government official. In 1813, Ching Shih gave birth to a son, Cheung Yu Lin. She would later have a daughter who was born at an unknown date. After Cheung Po died at sea in 1822, Ching Shih moved the family to Macau and opened a gambling house. She was also involved in the salt trade there. In her later years, she even served as an advisor to Lin Zexu in battling the British Army during the First Opium War which broke out in 1839. In 1844, she died in bed surrounded by her family in Macau, at the age of 69.  Cultural references  A semi-fictionalized account of Ching Shih's piracy appeared in Jorge Luis Borges's short story The Widow Ching, Lady Pirate (part of A Universal History of Infamy (1935)), where she is described as \\"a lady pirate who operated in Asian waters, all the way from the Yellow Sea to the rivers of the Annam coast\\", and who, after surrendering to the imperial forces, is pardoned and allowed to live the rest of her life as an opium smuggler. Borges acknowledged the 1932 book The History of Piracy, by Philip Gosse (grandson of the naturalist Philip Henry Gosse), as the source of the tale. In Chapter 15 of Codename: Sailor V, a manga created by Naoko Takeuchi, Sailor V transforms temporarily into Ching Shih. In 2003, Ermanno Olmi made a film, Singing Behind Screens, loosely based on Borges's retelling, though rights problems prevented the Argentine writer from appearing in the credits. Afterlife, a 2006 OEL graphic novel, depicts Ching Shih as a guardian who fights demons to protect the denizens of the underworld. In The Wake of the Lorelei Lee, book 8 of L.A. Meyer's Bloody Jack series, Jacky is captured by Ching Shih and so impresses her that the pirate bestows her with a tattoo of a dragon on the back of her neck to indicate she is under Shih's protection. A character loosely based on Ching Shih appears in the 2007 film Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End. Played by Takayo Fischer Mistress Ching is portrayed as one of the 9 Pirate Lords of the Brethren Court and the powerful leader of the pirate confederation of China. The character also appears in 3 tie-in books, Rising in the East, Day of the Shadow, and The Price of Freedom. Puppetmongers Theatre of Toronto, Canada, mounted 2 different productions based on Ching Shih's life. The first was a co-production with the Center for Puppetry Arts in Atlanta, directed by Jon Ludwig in 2000, and the second version, directed by Mark Cassidy played at Toronto's Tarragon Theatre Extra Space in 2002. In the 2015 Hong Kong television drama Captain of Destiny, Maggie Shiu plays a character who's based on Ching Shih. Red Flag, a limited series which centers on Ching Shih, starring Maggie Q and Francois Arnaud, was scheduled to start filming in the fall of 2014 in Malaysia. On March 19, 2018, a character who references the real-life Ching Shih, named \\"Madame Shih\\" was added to the MMORPG Runescape, debuting in a pirate-themed quest titled \\"Pieces of Hate\\". She goes on to feature in another quest, released on February 25, 2019, titled \\"Curse of the Black Stone\\". In both quests she's captured, but eventually escapes with help from the player, possibly referencing Ching Shih's knack for getting out of all sorts of dangerous situations.Runescape Wiki-Madame Shih See also *Pirates of the South China Coast  References  Category:1775 births Category:1844 deaths Category:18th-century Chinese women Category:19th-century Chinese women Category:19th-century pirates Category:Chinese brothel owners and madams Category:Chinese female prostitutes Category:Chinese pirates Category:Female pirates Category:People from Guangzhou Category:Qing dynasty people Category:Date of birth unknown Category:Date of death unknown Category:Women in war in China Category:Women in 18th-century warfare Category:Women in 19th- century warfare ","title":"Ching Shih"},{"id":"10461503","text":"Challengers is the fourth studio album by Canadian indie rock band the New Pornographers, released on August 21, 2007.Carl Newman Reveals New Pornographers LP Details The track listing for the album was revealed June 1, 2007.New Pornographers Reveal Challengers Tracklist A box set containing three blank CD-Rs, named \\"Executive Edition\\", was released August 7, 2007, two weeks before the album, with the promise of future multimedia to be downloaded at the band's website for fans to compile and burn their own CDs.

Various additional ingredients can be used. It is usually served chilled, although it is sometimes served hot or at room temperature. It is used as a dip for potato chips, crackers, bread, and crudit√©s. Commercial varieties of clam dip are mass-produced by some companies and marketed to consumers in grocery stores and supermarkets. History In the early 1950s in the United States, the first televised recipe for clam dip appeared on the Kraft Music Hall show, a well-known and popular radio and television variety program that ran from 1933 to 1971. After the recipe segment aired, canned clams in New York City sold out within 24 hours. The ingredients used in this recipe were minced canned clams, cream cheese, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, salt and pepper. Clam dip remained popular throughout the 1960s and 1970s in the U.S., at which time prepared manufactured clam dips were available in U.S. supermarkets. As various tomato based salsas gained more popularity with American consumers beginning in the late 1980s and 1990s, the popularity of clam dip and similar dips made with sour cream and cream cheese declined. Preparation alt= Clam dip is typically prepared using chopped or minced clams, sour cream or cream cheese, and various seasonings, and usually served chilled. It is used as a dip for potato chips, bread, crackers, and crudit√©s. It has a creamy texture and mouthfeel. Canned, cooked, and frozen or fresh clams may be used, the latter of which can be cooked by steaming or pan cooking. Canned clams can be drained, or the liquid can be retained and used as an ingredient. After refrigeration, the dip may thicken, and the liquid from canned clams can be used to thin the dip. Milk or cream is also sometimes used to thin clam dip. When refrigerated overnight, the flavors of the ingredients intermingle more greatly, resulting in a more flavorful dip. Smoked clams are sometimes used, which imbues a distinct smoky flavor to the dip. The clams can be smoked in the shell and then minced afterward. Additional ingredients can be used, such as lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, onion, scallions, shallots, chives, garlic, and pepper sauce. The ingredients can be mixed using a food processor. It is sometimes served as a hot dip, which can be kept warm using a chafing dish, and melted cheese can be used as an ingredient in hot versions. It is also sometimes served at room temperature. Clam dip can be served in a hollowed-out loaf of bread, such as sourdough. It can be garnished with ingredients such as parsley, scallions and paprika. Crudit√©s to accompany the dish can include red peppers, carrots, radishes, and cauliflower, among others. Prepared clam dip can be preserved by storing it in a freezer. Commercial varieties alt= Some companies mass- produce commercial varieties of prepared clam dip and market them to consumers in grocery stores and supermarkets. Commercial varieties are typically packaged in plastic tubs. Prepared clam dip mixes have also been commercially manufactured and marketed to consumers. One such product comes packaged with dried sour cream that is reconstituted using water.

History  The band was originally formed in 1987, with lead singer/bassist Scott Llewellyn, guitarist Luis Peraza Jr., and drummer Chris Neuberg. Lucy Brown recorded an eponymous LP for DC-area label T.O.G. Records in 1988. The vinyl- only release suffered from low sales and limited distribution, and was not a success beyond the DC area. After adding a new lead singer, Gene Hawkins (Llewellyn stayed on as bassist), Lucy Brown signed with Megaforce Records, for which they recorded another self-titled LP in 1991. The album was not a commercial success, and the band lost their contract with Megaforce. Llewellyn left the band in 1992, and was replaced by Jon Papazoglou. Lucy Brown made one final recording, an EP entitled Five Dogs Dead for the local Death Rebel label. Gene Hawkins died in 1994 from an overdose of heroin, and the surviving members of the band decided to disband. Today, Luis Peraza Jr. and Eric Schwelling run Atomic Music, a company with two musical instrument stores in the DC metropolitan area.(2005). \\"Atomic Music: Who we are \\". Atomicmusiconline.com.

The attack allows an attacker to recover the key in an RC4 encrypted stream from a large number of messages in that stream. The Fluhrer, Mantin and Shamir attack applies to specific key derivation methods, but does not apply in general to RC4-based SSL (TLS), since SSL generates the encryption keys it uses for RC4 by hashing, meaning that different SSL sessions have unrelated keys. However, the closely related bar mitzvah attack, based on the same research and revealed in 2015, does exploit those cases where weak keys are generated by the SSL keying process. Background The Fluhrer, Mantin and Shamir (FMS) attack, published in their 2001 paper \\"Weaknesses in the Key Scheduling Algorithm of RC4\\",Fluhrer, S., Mantin, I., and A. Shamir, \\"Weaknesses in the Key Scheduling Algorithm of RC4\\", Selected Areas of Cryptography: SAC 2001, Lecture Notes in Computer Science Vol. 2259, pp 1-24, 2001. takes advantage of a weakness in the RC4 key scheduling algorithm to reconstruct the key from encrypted messages. The FMS attack gained popularity in network attack tools including AirSnort, weplab, and aircrack, which use it to recover the key used by WEP protected wireless networks. This discussion will use the below RC4 key scheduling algorithm (KSA). begin ksa(with int keylength, with byte key[keylength]) for i from 0 to 255 S[i] := i endfor j := 0 for i from 0 to 255 j := (j + S[i] + key[i mod keylength]) mod 256 swap(S[i],S[j]) endfor end The following pseudo-random generation algorithm (PRGA) will also be used. begin prga(with byte S[256]) i := 0 j := 0 while GeneratingOutput: i := (i + 1) mod 256 j := (j + S[i]) mod 256 swap(S[i],S[j]) output S[(S[i] + S[j]) mod 256] endwhile end  The attack  The basis of the FMS attack lies in the use of weak initialization vectors (IVs) used with RC4. RC4 encrypts one byte at a time with a keystream output from prga(); RC4 uses the key to initialize a state machine via ksa(), and then continuously modifies the state and generates a new byte of the keystream from the new state. Theoretically, the key stream functions as a random one- time pad, as a pseudo-random number generator controls the output at each step. With certain IVs, an attacker knowing the first byte of the keystream and the first m bytes of the key can derive the (m + 1)th byte of the key due to a weakness in the PRNG used to generate the keystream. Because the first byte of the plaintext comes from the WEP SNAP header, an attacker can assume he can derive the first byte of the keystream from B ‚äï 0xAA (the SNAP header is almost always 0xAA). From there, he only needs an IV in the form (a + 3, n ‚àí 1, x) for key index a origin 0, element value space n (256 since 8 bits make a byte), and any X. To start, the attacker needs IVs of (3, 255, x). WEP uses 24-bit IVs, making each value one byte long. To start, the attacker utilizes the IV as the first 3 elements in K[ ]. He fills the S-box S[ ] with sequential values from 0 to n as RC4 does when initializing the S-box from a known K[ ]. He then performs the first 3 iterations of ksa() to begin initializing the S-box. After the third step, the attacker can possibly, but not definitely, derive the fourth byte of the key using the keystream output O by computing (O ‚àí j ‚àí S[i]) mod n = K[i], with the value i = 3 at this step. At this point, the attacker does not yet have the fourth byte of the key. This algorithm does not regenerate the next byte of the key; it generates a possible value of the key. By collecting multiple messages--for example WEP packets--and repeating these steps, the attacker will generate a number of different possible values. The correct value appears significantly more frequently than any other; the attacker can determine the value of the key by recognizing this value and selecting it as the next byte. At this point, he can start the attack over again on the fifth byte of the key. Although the attacker cannot attack words of the key out of order, he can store messages for later sequential attack on later words once he knows earlier words. Again, he only needs messages with weak IVs, and can discard others. Through this process, he can gather a large number of messages for attack on the entire key; in fact, he can store only a short portion of the beginning of those messages, just enough to carry the attack out as far as the word of the key the IV will allow him to attack.

As of 2014 one creation is extant. The Bellingham Baronetcy, of Hilsington in the County of Westmorland, was created in the Baronetage of England on 30 May 1620 for Henry Bellingham, Member of Parliament for Westmorland. He was succeeded by his son, the second Baronet, who also sat as Member of Parliament for Westmorland. On his death in 1650 the baronetcy became extinct.George Edward Cokayne Complete Baronetage Volume 1 1900 The Bellingham Baronetcy, of Dubber in the County of Dublin, was created in the Baronetage of Ireland on 18 March 1667 for Daniel Bellingham, Deputy Receiver-General and Vice-Treasurer of Ireland and Lord Mayor of Dublin. He was succeeded by his son, the second Baronet. He was Sheriff of County Dublin in 1684. He was childless and on his death in 1699 the title became extinct. The Bellingham Baronetcy, of Castle Bellingham, in the County of Louth, was created in the Baronetage of Great Britain on 19 April 1796 for William Bellingham, Member of Parliament for Reigate and private secretary to William Pitt the Younger, with remainder to the heirs male of his father Colonel Alan Bellingham. He was a great-great-grandson of Henry Bellingham, younger brother of the first Baronet of the 1667 creation. Bellingham died childless and was succeeded according to the special remainder by his nephew, the second Baronet. He was the son of Alan Bellingham. The second Baronet was succeeded by his son, the third Baronet. He was Sheriff of County Louth in 1829. On his death the title passed to his son, the fourth Baronet. He was Member of Parliament for County Louth and Lord-Lieutenant of County Louth. He was succeeded by his son, the fifth Baronet. He was Brigadier-General in the British Army, a Senator of the Irish Free State and Lord-Lieutenant of County Louth. He died without male issue and was succeeded by his nephew, the sixth Baronet (the son of Captain Roger Charles Noel Bellingham, second son of the fourth Baronet). As of 2014 the title is held by his second son, the eighth Baronet, who succeeded his brother in 1999. Two other members of the family may also be mentioned. Alice Sophie, daughter of the third Baronet, was the wife of Sir Victor Brooke, 3rd Baronet. She was the mother of Field Marshal The 1st Viscount Alanbrooke and the grandmother of The 1st Viscount Brookeborough. The Conservative politician Henry, Lord Bellingham (Henry Bellingham) is the great-great-great-grandson of John Bellingham, younger brother of the second Baronet, and is consequently in special remainder to the baronetcy. The family surname is pronounced \\"Bellinjum\\". This is dependent on what part of the British Isles you are in, with some parts, particularly in Northumberland, where it is 'Bellinjum', most other areas pronounce the name 'Bellingham'.

Attempts at weed control by herbicide, to the neglect of other methods, may have led to proliferation of this species in some environments.

There are many movie theaters in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) but they are situated only in the main cities like Khobar, Riyadh and Jeddah and so. There were no cinemas in Saudi Arabia from 1983 to 2018, although there was occasionally talk of opening movie theaters, and in 2008 conference rooms were rented to show the comedy Mennahi. Saudis wishing to watch films have done so via satellite, DVD, or video. In 2018, as part of the Saudi Vision 2030 initiative, and toward achieving Quality of Life Program‚Äôs goal, Saudi Arabia began to authorise the construction of new cinemas for the first time in 35 years. until the first cinema in Saudi Arabia opened on 18 April 2018 in Riyadh. AMC Theatres plans to open up to 40 cinemas in some 15 Saudi cities over the following five years.Saudi cinema screens reopen on 18 April 'with Black Panther', BBC News, 5 April 2018 In January 2019, the first cinema theater was opened in Jeddah, the commercial capital of Saudi Arabia. Keif al- Hal?, released in 2006, was billed as Saudi Arabia's first film; however, it was shot in the United Arab Emirates and the lead female was played by a Jordanian. The 2012 film Wadjda had an all-Saudi cast and was the first feature film shot entirely in Saudi Arabia. The film Barakah Yoqabil Barakah by director Mahmoud Sabbagh was shot in Jeddah in 2015, premiered the 66th Berlin International Film Festival, making it the first Saudi feature film to participate in the festival. Sameera Aziz is the first Saudi filmmaker in Indian cinema (Bollywood).  Films  Keif al-Hal? triggered a debate on the country's stance on cinemas and films. The documentary short film directed by Abdullah Al-Eyaf called Cinema 500 km discussed the issue of banning movie theaters and the film forced the media to take up the issue and discuss it. Wadjda was selected as the Saudi Arabian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 86th Academy Awards - The first time the country made a submission to the Oscars, but it was not nominated. It earned a nomination for Best Foreign Film at the 2014 BAFTA Awards. Barakah Yoqabil Barakah was the first feature film from Saudi Arabia to participate in the Berlin International Film Festival; it won a jury award at the festival. Movie theaters In the 1970s, there were many movie theaters in Saudi Arabia and they were not considered un-Islamic, though they were seen as contrary to Arab cultural norms. In the 1980s, there were some improvised movie halls in Saudi Arabia, most of which were in Jeddah and Mecca, where Egyptian, Indian, and Turkish films were screened without government intervention. However, all these halls were closed due to the growing objections of religious conservatives during the Islamic revival movement in the 1980s. As a political response to an increase in Islamist activism, including the 1979 seizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca, the government closed all cinemas and theaters. During the cinema ban, the only public theater in Saudi Arabia was a single IMAX cinema located in Khobar at the Sultan Bin Abdulaziz Science and Technology Center. The IMAX cinema, in operation since 2005, shows only educational films. The documentaries are mostly productions from the United States shown in Arabic, with English audio headphones available. In November 2005, a 1,400-seat cinema opened at a hotel in Riyadh for a limited run. The cinema was open for women and children only and showed foreign cartoons dubbed in Arabic. Following the public screenings, the cinema ban was put into question as the demand for movie theaters in Saudi Arabia increased. On 11 December 2017, as part of the Saudi Vision 2030 initiative, the Saudi Arabian Minister of Culture and Information announced that public movie theaters would be allowed by 2018. The government hopes that by 2030, Saudi Arabia will already have more than 300 theaters with over 2,000 movie screens. The first public film screening was Black Panther beginning on 18 April 2018 for five days in a 620-seat cinema owned by AMC Theatres in Riyadh's King Abdullah Financial District which was originally intended to be a symphony hall. Avengers: Infinity War began screening in the kingdom on 26 April. In May 2018, it was announced that IMAX had signed a deal with VOX Cinemas to open at least four IMAX venues following the lifting of the cinema ban. At the time, it was also announced that VOX Cinemas intends to open 600 screens throughout Saudi Arabia over the next five years. As well as the cost of investment Vox Cinemas announced it would be investing $533 million. In January 2019, officially public movie theaters were opened in Jeddah city. ‚ÄúBy 2030, Saudi Arabia is expected to host 2,600 cinema screens that will entertain its growing population,‚Äù said Dr Martin Berlin, Middle East partner and global deals real estate leader at PwC Middle East.\\" Cin√©polis has started the process to open a number of cinemas in Saudi Arabia. This will include introducing 63 screens to Dammam, Jazan, Jeddah, Riyadh and Najran. Video rental stores Video rental stores started appearing in the 1980s and offered Arabic, Western, and Asian movies. By the late 1990s, the increasing number of free-to-air satellite TV channels had led most video stores to close. Saudi films A small number of films have been shot in Saudi Arabia with a Saudi cast since the early 2000s. However, due to the lack of cinemas in Saudi Arabia before April 2018, those listed have not been shown within Saudi Arabia itself.

Their open weaves provide lightness and flexibility that allow them to be carried and manipulated with relative ease, making them valuable for methodical tasks such as hunting, fishing, sleeping, and carrying. Definition A net, in its primary meaning, comprises fibers knotted and twisted into a grid-like structure which blocks the passage of large items, while letting small items and fluids pass. It requires less material than something sheet-like, and provides a degree of transparency, as well as flexibility and lightness. History A fragment of neolithic fishing net. The oldest nets found are from the Mesolithic era, but nets may have existed in the Upper paleolithic era. Nets are typically made of perishable materials and leave little archeological record. Some nets are preserved in ice or bogs, and there are also clay impressions of nets. Making and repairing nets thumbleftOne method of making nets is by tying sheet bends using a netting needle and a gauge. Key: *a) head rope *f) loop of the sheet bend being tied *n) netting shuttle *s) gauge *z) tongue of the netting shuttle (makes it easier to load the twine so that it does not twist as it is used) Mending a net; binding a length of net to a new head rope. Note that, unusually, the gauge of the row being worked is larger than the gauge of the rest of the net. Some nets are still made by hand. This 2013 image shows a Syrian refugee in Lebanon in her home, manually knotting a fishing net intended for sale. Originally, all nets were made by hand. Construction begins from a single point for round nets such as purse nets, net bags, or hair nets, but square nets are usually started from a headrope. A line is tied to the headrope at regular intervals, forming a series of loops. This can be done using slipped overhand knots or other knots, such as clove hitches. Subsequent rows are then worked using sheet bends, as shown in the diagram, or another knot. Some nets, such as hammocks, may be looped rather than knotted. To avoid hauling a long length of loose twine through each knot, the twine is wound onto a netting shuttle or netting needle. This must be done correctly to prevent it twisting as it is used,Netting instructions but makes net production much faster. A gauge ‚Äì often a smooth stick ‚Äì is used to keep the loops the same size and the mesh even. The first and last rows are generally made using a half-size gauge, so that the edges of the net will be smooth. There are also knot-free nets. Some nets are still shaped by their end users,Net making (and repair) guide for commercial fishing nets. although nets are now often knotted by machine. When a hole is ripped in a net, there are fewer holes in it than before the net was ripped. However, the stress concentration at the edges of the hole often causes it to tear further, making timely repairs important. Mending nets by hand is still an important skill for those who work with them. Materials Nets may be made using almost any sort of fiber. Traditional net materials varied with what was locally available; early European fishing nets were often made of linen, for instance. Longer-lasting synthetics are now fairly universal. Nylon monofilament nets are transparent, and are therefore often used for fishing and trapping. Structural properties Finishing a Mayan hammock, which is twisted rather than knotted. The twisted net of a Mayan hammock is very stretchy, letting it hold this sleeping baby securely. Nets, like fabric, stretch less along their constituent strands (the \\"bars\\" between knots) than diagonally across the gaps in the mesh. They are, so to speak, made on the bias. The choice of material used also affects the structural properties of the net. Nets are designed and constructed for their specific purpose by modifying the parameters of the weave and the material used. Safety nets, for example, must decelerate the person hitting them gradually, usually by having a concave-upwards stress‚Äìstrain curve, where the amount of force required to stretch the net increases the further the net is stretched. Uses =Transport= Examples include cargo nets and net bags. Some vegetables, like onions, are often shipped in nets. =Sports= Nets are used in sporting goals and in games such as soccer, basketball, bossaball and ice hockey. A net separates opponents in various net sports such as volleyball, tennis, badminton, and table tennis, where the ball or shuttlecock must go over the net to remain in play. A net also may be used for safety during practice, as in cricket. =Capturing animals= Nets for capturing animals include fishing nets, butterfly nets, bird netting, and trapping nets such as purse and long nets. Some, like mist nets, rocket nets, and netguns, are designed not to harm the animals caught. Camouflage nets may also be used. =Furnishings= Hammocks, safety nets, and mosquito nets are net-based. Some furniture includes a net stretched on a frame. Multihull boats may have net trampolines strung between their hulls. =Clothing= Hair nets, net lace, and net embroidery are sartorial nets. =Armed conflict= Anti-submarine nets and anti-torpedo nets can be laid by net-laying ships.

It also serves the city of Waterford, and at it connects with the Dublin‚ÄìCork railway line. Since 2010 there has been no service between Waterford and Rosslare Europort, and all trains terminate at . Rosslare (Europort and Strand) and Wexford have still at least 3 trains a day to Dublin, and Three Back (Morning, Afternoon and Evening). The line between Rosslare and Waterford has now been abandoned including the stations, (with the exception of Rosslare Strand). History Construction of the route was begun in 1848 for the Waterford and Limerick Railway and completed in 1854. It is one of the oldest railways in Ireland, and the first to have been authorised by the UK Parliament. The company was renamed the Waterford, Limerick and Western in 1896 and merged with the Great Southern and Western Railway in 1901. The section between Waterford and Rosslare section remains the property of the Fishguard & Rosslare Railways and Harbours Company, which is jointly owned by Iarnr√≥d √âireann and Stena Line. It is the only main line railway in the Republic not wholly owned by the State. The line's most notable feature on the line is the Cahir Viaduct across the River Suir in County Tipperary. It was built in 1852 and has three iron spans borne on stone abutments. The viaduct partly collapsed in 1955 and partly collapsed again in 2003 (see below). Iarnr√≥d √âireann renewed the viaduct at a cost of ‚Ç¨2.6 million, and the line was reopened in September 2004. Train services have remained infrequent for more than 100 years. By 2003 the line was carrying fewer than 100 passengers a day. When I√â reopened the line it introduced new railcars and a service of three journeys in each direction on weekdays, which was a greater service frequency than the line had for much of its history. There is no Sunday service. Between and Limerick Junction, trains between Limerick and Dublin also serve the line. The speed limit on much of the line is less than . In November 2016 it was announced that the section of the line between Limerick Junction and Waterford section may be closed in future along with the line linking and , part of the Wexford line, and the Limerick‚ÄìBallybrophy railway line. Waterford ‚Äì Rosslare section On 12 March 2010 it was announced that Iarnr√≥d √âireann would review the service between and because few passengers were using it. Ticket revenue met only 2% of the line's operating costs. About 25 passengers per day were by using the service. Timetabling was poor. There was only one train each way daily from Monday to Saturday, leaving Rosslare early in the morning and returning from Waterford early in the evening. The trains made very poor connections with other rail services. They connected with the Stena Line ferry service to and from Fishguard Harbour, but due to the poor onward connections at Waterford few passengers used this. The exception was during the volcanic ash crisis of 2010, when trains were fully loaded and had standing room only. The last train between Waterford and Rosslare ran on 18 September 2010. Iarnr√≥d √âireann provided a four-car 2700 class diesel multiple unit for the service, instead of the usual two-car unit. The National Transport Authority requires I√â to maintain the now-disused line. Bus √âireann revised the timetable and route of bus service 370 to offer alternative passenger transport from 20 September. Buses on the route are branded \\"370 Connect\\". Notable incidents *In 1955 an out-of-control train crashed through the buffers in the loop at and fell through the deck of the viaduct. The driver and fireman were killed.MacAongusa, p 180. *In 2003 a train of 22 cement wagons was derailed on the viaduct. The locomotive and driver safely crossed the bridge, but 13 of the wagons behind the locomotive fell through the deck of the bridge into the river. The Department of Transport's Interim Railway Safety Commission investigated the accident and found that timber supporting the rails was rotten, which may have allowed the rails to spread and the wagons to fall between the rails. Services resumed in September 2004 with diesel railcars, but further engineering works dogged services, requiring frequent bus replacements of the train services. *In 2012 a young girl was hit and injured by a train near Tipperary Town which was travelling from Limerick Junction to Waterford. She was taken to hospital. No-one aboard the train was injured. Trains IE 22000 Class InterCity railcars usually operate services on the line. Between 2012 and 2013 I√â operated IE 2800 Class railcars on the line. From 2004 until 2012 IE 2700 Class railcars operated most services.

There are two types of incorporated municipalities in Maine, towns and cities. The tables below differentiate between towns and cities. Most areas of New England are entirely divided into incorporated municipalities, with no unincorporated territory. In the three northern New England states, however, some unincorporated territory does exist, generally in areas that are very sparsely populated. Maine contains significantly more unincorporated territory than the other states, with the bulk of it in interior and northern counties. Some southern and coastal counties, including Knox County, also contain smaller amounts of unincorporated territory, however. Some unincorporated territory in Maine is organized into a third type of town-level municipality unique to Maine, called a plantation (considered to be ‚Äúorganized‚Äù, but not incorporated), while some is entirely unorganized. Knox County currently contains one plantation (Matinicus Isle), as well as a small amount of territory that is entirely unorganized (the former Criehaven Plantation). All of Knox County‚Äôs unincorporated area is on offshore islands. Separate sections with census totals for unincorporated areas follow the main tables below. For any census, adding up the totals for each town-level municipality, including any plantations or unorganized entities, should yield the county total. Except for Matinicus and Criehaven, all of Knox County is incorporated; except for Criehaven, all of the county is at least organized. (For a period in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Knox County was entirely organized, but it has never been entirely incorporated.)

Plantations As of 1900, Knox County contained three plantations: Criehaven, Matinicus Isle and Muscle Ridge. All were located on offshore islands (the mainland of the county was then, and is now, entirely divided into incorporated towns). Matinicus Isle is the only plantation that remains today. Muscle Ridge and Criehaven surrendered their organization in 1916 and 1925, respectively. When they did so, both reverted to unorganized territory, but Muscle Ridge's former territory was later annexed to a nearby town. Criehaven's former territory remains unorganized. 1900 *Matinicus Isle 184 *Muscle Ridge 72 *Criehaven 47 1910 *Matinicus Isle 179 *Muscle Ridge 67 *Criehaven 46 1920 *Matinicus Isle 140 *Criehaven 63 1930 *Matinicus Isle 156 1940 *Matinicus Isle 112 1950 *Matinicus Isle 188 1960 *Matinicus Isle 100 1970 *Matinicus Isle 90 1980 *Matinicus Isle 66 1990 *Matinicus Isle 67 2000 *Matinicus Isle 51 Unorganized Territory As of 1900, Knox County was entirely organized. The dissolutions of the town of Hurricane Isle (1915), Muscle Ridge Plantation (1916) and Criehaven Plantation (1925) all created unorganized territory, however, as each reverted to that state. The former territories of Hurricane Isle and Muscle Ridge were later annexed to nearby towns, leaving only Criehaven as unorganized territory today (see the Notes section for more information). The former Criehaven Plantation consists of a small group of islands, covering less than one square mile of land, adjacent to (and once part of, before organizing separately) Matinicus Isle Plantation. This area is sometimes referred to as ‚ÄúCriehaven Township‚Äù. Its population has not exceeded 20 in any census since 1940, and in recent censuses it has reported few if any year-round residents. 1900 through 1920 There was no unorganized territory in Knox County at the time of these censuses. 1920 Unorganized territory reported 47 residents. The unorganized territory consisted of the former Muscle Ridge plantation (pop. 36) and the former town of Hurricane Isle (pop. 11). 1930 Unorganized territory reported 88 residents. No breakdown was provided, but it would seem to have included some combination of territory that had been part of the former town of Hurricane Isle and/or the former Criehaven and Muscle Ridge plantations. 1940 Unorganized territory reported 113 residents. No breakdown was provided, but it would seem to have included some combination of territory that had been part of the former town Criehaven and/or Muscle Ridge plantation. 1950 Unorganized territory reported 18 residents. No breakdown was provided, but it would seem to have included the former Criehaven plantation. 1960 Unorganized territory reported 14 residents, all in the former Criehaven Plantation, which was the only unorganized territory in the county. 1970 Unorganized territory reported no residents. The only unorganized territory in the county was the former Criehaven Plantation. 1980 Unorganized territory reported 5 residents, all in the former Criehaven Plantation, which was the only unorganized territory in the county. 1990 Unorganized territory reported no residents. The only unorganized territory in the county was the former Criehaven Plantation. 2000 Unorganized territory reported no residents. The only unorganized territory in the county was the former Criehaven Plantation. Notes Unorganized territory in 1930 through 1950 Censuses During the 1910s and 1920s, three municipalities in Knox County, all located on offshore islands, dissolved: the town of Hurricane Island, Muscle Ridge Plantation, and Criehaven Plantation. While Criehaven apparently reverted to unorganized territory and has continued to hold that status down to the present time, sources contain conflicting information as to the disposition of Hurricane Isle and Muscle Ridge after their dissolution. It is apparent that the former territory of Hurricane Isle and Muscle Ridge was eventually annexed to other municipalities (unlike Criehaven, they no longer exist today as distinct entities in any form), but at least some of their territory may have continued for a time after their dissolution as unorganized territory. The 1920 Census provided distinct listings for Hurricane Isle and Muscle Ridge as unorganized townships (as well as a listing for Criehaven, which was still an organized plantation at the time). The 1930 through 1950 Censuses handle unorganized territory via a single listing for ‚ÄúIslands not belonging to any town‚Äù, however, with no indication of exactly what this is. The population figures for 1930 and 1940 are significantly higher than any figure for Criehaven before or since, which suggests that, at least for those two censuses, the area covered may be larger than Criehaven. For the 1960 Census, the Census Bureau abandoned any attempt to provide breakdowns for unorganized territory within Maine counties, simply providing a single listing for ‚ÄúUnorganized Territory‚Äù. Starting in 1970, the Census Bureau began using defined ‚Äúunorganized territories‚Äù. In each census since then, the unorganized territory in Knox County has been shown as ‚ÄúCriehaven‚Äù. A footnote in the 1970 Census reports also indicates that the territory shown as ‚ÄúCriehaven‚Äù in that census is the same as the territory shown as ‚ÄúUnorganized Territory‚Äù in the 1960 Census. From this, it seems that Criehaven has been the only remaining unorganized territory in Knox County at least as far back as the 1960 Census. Given the similarity between the 1950 population for ‚ÄúIslands not belonging to any town‚Äù and the 1960 population figure for ‚ÄúUnorganized Territory‚Äù, this may be true back to 1950 as well, but this is not known with any certainty.

He entered the Society of Jesus, 25 October 1621, taught humanities and rhetoric for seven years, then positive theology and Scripture at Bourges, and later at Paris. His first work was a paraphrase of the Book of Job in Latin hexameters (1637), resumed and accompanied by a commentary in 1679. He published also Theurgicon (1644), on the miracles of Christ, \\"Elegiarum liber\\" (1656), \\"De ludicra dictione\\" (1656); took an active part in the Jansenistic controversy (\\"Cornelius Jansenius Iprensis suspectus\\", Paris, 1650), and defended himself against the charge of having written pamphlets concerning the Calaghan affair (De libello supposititio dissertatio, 1653). In this last writing he defined accurately the style of the Port Royal writers before the Provinciales:, monotonous and burdened with complicated periods. He wrote a sharp and learned criticism of the \\"Epigrammatum delectus\\" of Port- Royal (1659), \\"De epigrammate liber et epigrammatum libri tres\\" (1669), showing knowledge of Catullus, Martial, and the Greek anthology. He was sensitive on this subject and took issue with his confere Ren√© Rapin, who had practically declared that no modern had written a good epigram (Remarques sur les nouvelles r√©flexions du R.P. Rapin J√©suite, touchant la po√©tique, 1675). Guillaume de Lamoignon, Rapin's protector, had Vavasseur's pamphlet suppressed. \\"Pere Vavasseur was a learned man, one of those critical and severe minds which find something to bite even in good works, and which let nothing pass\\" (Sainte-Beuve, \\"Port-Royal\\", III, 528). His other works include sermons, a commentary on Osee, and a dissertation on the beauty of Christ. All his writings were collected by the theologian Jean Leclerc (Amsterdam, 1709). His Latin writings had appeared previously in Paris (1683). References *Sommervogel, Bibl. de la compagnie de Jesus, VIII (Paris, 1898), 499 *Sainte- Beuve, Port Royal, III, 49, 28, 625.

It is also known locally as Blessington Lake. It holds 166 billion litres (43.8 billion gallons, or 0.2 cubic km) and has a surface area 22.26 km2, making it the largest artificial reservoir in Ireland by capacity and surface area. It has a 27.5-mile (44.3 km) shoreline, and is 24.6 miles (39.6 km) from the sea.[1] History It was created between 1937 and 1947, with flooding beginning at 10 am on 3 March 1940 by damming the River Liffey at Poulaphouca as part of the Electricity Supply Board project to build a second hydroelectric station in Ireland, Ardnacrusha on the River Shannon being the first. Kalpan turbine of the Poulaphouca power station The reservoir is one of two major sources of Dublin's water supply, the other major supply being Vartry Reservoir in east Wicklow. Between 1938 and 1940, 76 houses were demolished, and the bridges at Humphreystown, Baltyboys, and Burgage blown up, in anticipation of the flooding of the valley for the Poulaphouca hydroelectric power station. Technique The Poulaphouca Reservoir supplies the three power stations along the River Liffey, which are located in Poulaphouca, Golden Falls and Leixlip. Poulaphouca has the largest capacity with two 15 MW generators driven by Kaplan turbines, the other two stations have a capacity of 4 MW each, so the total capacity of the power stations on the River Liffey is 38 MW. The Kaplan turbines of the Poulaphouca station where delivered by the Swiss manufacturer Ateliers des Charmilles from Geneva, Switzerland. Each turbine has a capacity of 25,300 horsepower at a hydraulic head of 50.5 m. The contract was executed in collaboration with English Electric from London. Nature Remains of excavations from the construction of Poulaphouca Dam The reservoir is sometimes known as \\"lakes\\" due to its shape, which arises because it lies in not one but two river valleys - that of the Liffey and, primarily, that of the King's River. The King's River joined the Liffey at Baltiboys, at which point it was the larger flow, and when the Liffey was dammed upstream of the confluence, the King's River Valley was flooded far to the south. A ridge of land, on which the village of Valleymount lies, divides the southern part of the reservoir. The goosander, recently arrived as a breeding species in Ireland, can sometimes be seen here.  Blessington Greenway  The Blessington Greenway walk is 6.5km in length and links the historic town of Blessington with the Palladian mansion at Russborough House. The trail starts in Blessington village and leads south to the Avon Ri Activity Centre at the southern end of the town and weaves its way along the lake shores and forestry, crosses an ancient medieval Ringfort, and then uses the footpath along part of the N81 before turning back into the forest at Burgage Moyle lane. The Greenway follows the lake shore and phase 2 is underway, with the goal of a 30 km greenway around the reservoir for walking, cycling and other recreational activities.

From Thanksgiving Day through December 31 WSAE broadcasts Christmas music around the clock. Home.FM originally played such Soft AC artists as Lionel Richie, Amy Grant, and Sade, but the music mix has changed to more of a Hot/Modern AC mix since. Typical mainstream artists heard on the station now include the likes of U2, Jack Johnson, Taylor Swift, Tolmachevy Sisters, Of Monsters and Men, Coldplay, Ingrid Michaelson, Michael Bubl√©, Regina Spektor and Kelly Clarkson. Mainstream artists make up the bulk of the playlist, but the station does still play a few Christian songs an hour by artists such as Jeremy Camp, Francesca Battistelli, Brandon Heath, Shawn McDonald, Jamie Grace and Needtobreathe.

Some noteworthy collaborations include a piano-and-saxophone duet with Ornette Coleman and a performance with Roger Waters of Pink Floyd's \\"Comfortably Numb.\\" The set also offers a number of excellent examples of Hornsby's re- inventiveness with his own compositions, particularly in a live setting, for instance three different versions of ‚ÄúThe Valley Road‚Äù are included‚Äîa live \\"bluesy funk\\" version with the Noise Makers, a Grammy-winning bluegrass version with the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, and \\"a loose and sloppy but totally grooving boogie\\" take with the Grateful Dead.

He is known for work which he did towards preparing the codification of French laws. Guillaume de Lamoignon. He became in 1644 master of requests in the Parlement. He took an active part in the Fronde of the Parlement against Mazarin. He became first president of the Parlement in 1658. A distinguished member of the Society of the Holy Sacrament, he was greatly devoted to the Catholic cause. He induced Colbert to give up the idea of putting back to twenty-seven the age for ordination to priesthood, and the years required for monastic vows to twenty for the women and twenty-seven for the men. He had Gallican tendencies, and in 1663 he spoke before the Parlement in favor of the \\"liberties of the Gallican church\\" against a thesis suspected of ultramontanism. A nephew of Bishop Potier of Beauvais, a close friend of the Jansenist Hermant, Lamoignon was supposed to sympathize with Port Royal, but he chose Ren√© Rapin, a Jesuit, as tutor for his sons, whom he also brought into close acquaintance with Bourdaloue. When in 1664 the Jansenists deferred to the Parlement a confutation of Pascal's Provinciales written by the Jesuits, the decree which condemned this book nevertheless spared the Jesuits. On this occasion Lamoignon said to the king that he had been \\"a witness of the unfair outbursts of the Jansenists in all the differences they had with the Society of Jesus; and this Jansenist party, which was being formed in the kingdom on the dissemination of the new teaching, was but a cabal which would become pernicious to the State\\". It was Lamoignon who, having as first president to settle the dispute that had arisen at the Sainte-Chapelle between the precentor and the treasurer regarding a desk, furnished Boileau with the account of this incident from which the latter evolved the celebrated poem of the \\"Lutrin\\".

In the winter of 330 BC, Ariobarzanes led a last stand of the outnumbered Persian forces at the Persian Gates near Persepolis, holding back the Macedonian army for a month. Alexander eventually found a path to the rear of the Persians from the captured prisoners of war or a local shepherd, defeating the Persians and capturing Persepolis. Background The Persian Empire suffered a series of defeats against the Macedonian forces at Granicus (334 BC), Issus (333 BC) and Gaugamela (331 BC), and by the end of 331 BC Alexander had advanced to Babylon and Susa. A Royal Road connected Susa (the first Persian capital city in Elam) with the more eastern capitals of Persepolis and Pasargadae in Persis, and was the natural venue for Alexander's continued campaign. Meanwhile, King Darius III was building a new army at Ecbatana. Ariobarzanes was charged with preventing the Macedonian advance into Persis, and to this effect he relied heavily on the terrain Alexander needed to pass through. There were only a few possible routes through the Zagros Mountains, all of which were made more hazardous by winter's onset. After the conquest of Susa, Alexander split the Macedonian army into two parts. Alexander's general, Parmenion, took one half along the Royal Road, and Alexander himself took the route towards Persis. Passing into Persis required traversing the Persian Gates, a narrow mountain pass that lent itself easily to ambush.For the identification, see more.... During his advance, Alexander subdued the Uxians, a local hill-tribe which had demanded the same tribute from him they used to receive from the Persian kings for safe passage. As he passed into the Persian Gates he met with no resistance. Believing that he would not encounter any more enemy forces during his march, Alexander neglected to send scouts ahead of his vanguard, and thus walked into Ariobarzanes' ambush. The valley preceding the Persian Gate, called the Tang'e Meyran, is initially very wide, allowing the Macedonian army to enter the mountains at full march. Ariobarzanes occupied a position near the modern-day village of Cheshmeh Chenar. The road curves to the southeast (to face the rising sun) and narrows considerably at that point, making the terrain particularly treacherous. (And thus well suited for Ariobarzanes's purposes.) According to historian Arrian, Ariobarzanes had a force of 40,000 infantry and 700 cavalry who faced a Macedonian force of over 10,000. However, some modern historians have claimed these figures for the Achaemenid force to be grossly exaggerated and implausible.Mehrdad Kia: \\"The Persian Empire: A Historical Encyclopedia [2 volumes]: A Historical Encyclopedia\\", ABC-CLIO, LLC, Santa Barbara and Denver, 2016, pp. 97 Encyclop√¶dia Iranica suggests a number of defenders of just 700 (or no more than 2,000) men based on the maximum number of troops likely at Ariobarzanes' disposal, but it notes that most modern historians follow Arrian, Curtius, and Diodorus unreservedly.\\"Alexander historians give Ariobarzanes a large army (40,000 infantry and 700 cavalry in Arrian, Anabasis 3.18.2; 25,000 infantry in Curtius 5.3.17 and Diodorus 17.68.1; the latter adds 300 horsemen), and their modern successors follow them unreservedly (e.g., Th. Doge, Alexander, Boston and New York, 1890, p. 401; J. F. C. Fuller, The Generalship of Alexander the Great, London, 1958, pp. 228ff.; N. G. L. Hammond, *Alexander the Great: King, Commander and Statesman, London, 1981, p. 185). However, Greek estimates for Persian infantries were generally valueless (C. Hignett, Xerxes‚Äô Invasion of Greece, Oxford, 1962, pp. 350f.), and Ariobarzanes could hardly have mustered more troops than he had taken to Gaugamela. Arrian's 700 can thus be interpreted as indicating the total strength of Ariobarzanes. Against them Alexander led an army of well over 10,000 men, for having sent Parmenion with the baggage train and heavier-armed troops down the carriage road, he himself took the Macedonian infantry, the lancers and archers through the mountainous track (Arrian, Anabasis 3.18.1; Curtius 5.3.16f.; Diodorus 17.68.1; Stein, op. cit., pp. 19f.)\\" Battle Map of the Persian Gate The Persian Gate was only a couple of meters wide at the point of ambush. Once the Macedonian army had advanced sufficiently into the narrow pass, the Persians rained down boulders on them from the northern slopes. From the southern slope, Persian archers launched their projectiles. Alexander's army initially suffered heavy casualties, losing entire platoons at a time.Quintus Curtius Rufus The Macedonians attempted to withdraw, but the terrain and their still-advancing rear guard made an orderly retreat impossible. Alexander was forced to leave his dead behind to save the rest of his army‚Äîa great mark of disgrace to the Macedonians and to other Greeks who valued highly the recovery and proper burial of their fallen.Prevas 17 Ariobarzanes had some reason to believe that success here could change the course of the war. Preventing Alexander's passage through the Persian Gates would force the Macedonian army to use other routes to invade Persia proper, all of which would allow Darius more time to field another army, and possibly stop the Macedonian invasion altogether. Ariobarzanes held the pass for a month, but Alexander succeeded in encircling the Persians in a pincer attack with Philotas and broke through the Persian defenses. Alexander and his elite contingent then attacked the force of Ariobarzanes from above in a surprise attack until the Persians could no longer block the pass.Prevas 18 Accounts of how he did so vary widely. Curtius and Arrian both report that prisoners of war led Alexander through the mountains to the rear of the Persian position, while a token force remained in the Macedonian camp under the command of Craterus.Arrian 3.18.5-6; Curtius 5.4.29 :\\"[The Persians]...Fought a memorable fight... Unarmed as they were, they seized the armed men in their embrace, and dragging them down to the ground... Stabbed most of them with their own weapons.\\"Curtius 5.3.31-2 Diodorus and Plutarch generally concur with this assessment, although their numbers vary widely. Modern historians W. Heckel and Stein also lend credence to this argument. Although precise figures are unavailable, some historians say that this engagement cost Alexander his greatest losses during his campaign to conquer Persia. Youtab, the sister of Ariobarzanes, fought alongside her brother in the battle. According to some accounts, Ariobarzanes, and his surviving companions were trapped, but rather than surrender, they charged straight into the Macedonian lines. One account states that Ariobarzanes was killed in the last charge while another version by Arrian reports that Ariobarzanes escaped to the north where he finally surrendered to Alexander with his companions. Modern Historian J. Prevas maintains that Ariobarzanes and his forces retreated to Persepolis, where they found the city gates closed by Tiridates, a Persian noble and guardian of the royal treasury under Darius III, who had been in secret contact with Alexander the Great. Tiridates considered resisting Alexander's forces to be futile, and so allowed Alexander to massacre Ariobarzanes and his troops right outside the city walls of Persepolis rather than fight against Alexander. This is in agreement with Curtius' account which states that the Persian force, after both inflicting and suffering heavy casualties in the ensuing battle, broke through the Macedonian forces and retreated to Persepolis, but were denied entrance into the capital at which point they returned to fight Alexander's army to the death.Quintis Curtius Rufus:Delphi Complete Works of Quintus Curtius Rufus - History of Alexander (Illustrated) (Delphi Ancient Classics Book 75), Delphi Classics, Ltd., Hastings and East Sussex, 2017 A few historians regard the Battle of the Persian Gate as the most serious challenge to Alexander's conquest of Persia.Berve, Das Alexanderreich II, p. 61; A. B. BosworthA Historical Commentary on Arrian's History of Alexander I, Oxford, 1980, p. 326 Michael Wood has called the battle decisive and A. B. Bosworth refers to it as a \\"complete and decisive victory for Alexander\\". Aftermath Similarities between the battle fought at Thermopylae and the Persian Gates have been recognized by ancient and modern authors.Heckel, p. 171 The Persian Gates played the role \\"of a Persian Thermopylae and like Thermopylae it fell.\\"(Burn, 1973, p. 121) The Battle of the Persian Gates served as a kind of reversal of the Battle of Thermopylae, fought in Greece in 480 BC in an attempt to hold off the invading Persian forces. Here, on Alexander's campaign to exact revenge for the Persian invasion of Greece, he faced the same situation from the Persians. There are also accounts that an Iranian shepherd led Alexander's forces around the Persian defenses, just as a local Greek showed the Persian forces a secret path around the pass at Thermopylae. The defeat of Ariobarzanes' forces at the Persian Gate removed the last military obstacle between Alexander and Persepolis. Upon his arrival at the city of Persepolis, Alexander appointed a general named Phrasaortes as successor of Ariobarzanes. Alexander seized the treasury of Persepolis, which at the time held the largest concentration of wealth in the world, and guaranteed himself financial independence from the Greek states.Prevas 19 Four months later, Alexander allowed the troops to loot Persepolis, kill all its men and enslave all its women, perhaps as a way to fulfill the expectations of his army and the Greek citizens, or perhaps as a final act of vengeance towards the Persians.Prevas 23 This destruction of the city can be viewed as unusual as its inhabitants surrendered without a fight and Alexander had earlier left Persian cities he conquered, such as Susa, relatively untouched.Prevas 27 In May 330 BC, Alexander ordered the terrace of Persepolis, including its palaces and royal audience halls, to be burned before he left to find Darius III.Prevas 33 Sources disagree as to why he ordered the destruction: it could have been a deliberate act of revenge for the burning of the Acropolis of Athens during the second Persian invasion of Greece, an impulsive, drunken act, or it could have been out of Alexander's supposed anger over not being recognized as the legitimate successor to Darius III.

Dakota offers Advanced Placement courses in limited subject areas, that include mathematics and the sciences. On May 3, 2014, Dakota Collegiate celebrated its 50th anniversary. History Dakota Collegiate opened in 1963 with 200 students and 20 teachers. In June 1964, there were 72 students in the first graduating class. Dakota began as an experimental team-teaching school and offered only University Entrance courses. Dakota now has roughly 1200 students, approximately 60 teachers, and offers over 120 courses. In 2012, it had a graduating class of roughly 280 students. The Dakota Collegiate Lancers have earned 590 provincial sports titles since the school was founded. =21st Century Learning 1:1 Initiative= During the 2011-2012 school year, Dakota Collegiate introduced the 21st Century Learning One-to-One initiative, in which all grade nine students were required to purchase their own laptop computer to use in their classes. The computers were used to complete assignments, create presentations, and research information. This initiative continued in the 2012-2013 school year, with grade 9 and 10 students requiring laptops, and an open invitation for students in higher grades to bring their own devices if they desire. =Murray Field= After 54 years of Dakota Collegiate's opening the school never played a single home football game until the school raised money for \\"the field of dreams\\" project. The school started fund raising money in late 2015 for a brand new football field, outdoor basketball court and a cricket pitch. Dakota finished the project in late 2017. It took over $3,000,000 to complete building the football field, and it took over $180,000 to complete the basketball court. Fundraising for the project was through gala dinners with guest speakers such as Troy Westwood, Matt Dunigan, Milt Stegall, Rod Hill, Dale Hawerchuk, Mark Scheifele, Jon Montgomery, and Donovan Bailey. The field got its name from a $250,000 donation from the family of auto dealer Dan Murray. The basketball court was named after former Dakota Collegiate coach and teacher Dale Bradshaw.

The goal took place on June 22, 1986, at the Azteca Stadium in Mexico City. Under association football rules, Maradona should have received a yellow card for a clear \\"handball\\" incidentUnderstanding The Hand Ball Rule. Medium. Retrieved 10 January 2020 and the goal disallowed. However, as the referees did not have a clear view of the play and video assistant referee technology did not yet exist, the goal stood and Argentina led 1‚Äì0. The game ended with a 2‚Äì1 win for the Argentines, thanks to a second goal scored by Maradona, known as the \\"Goal of the Century\\". After the match, Diego Maradona stated that the goal was scored \\"a little with his head, and a little with the hand of God\\".  The Goal  The move of the \\"Hand of God\\" goal At the end of the first half, while the game was still tied at 0-0, Maradona was beginning to influence the end result of the match. Six minutes into the second half of the game, Maradona took the ball out of the box with his left leg and passed it to teammate Jorge Valdano. Valdano tried to take on several English defenders, but the ball was intercepted and thrown back and forth and eventually cleared towards England's goal by English defender Steve Hodge. Because of the position of the players, Maradona would have been caught offside, but as the ball came off an opponent, he was onside. Alone inside the penalty box and with the ball dropping down, Maradona struggled for the ball alongside goalkeeper Peter Shilton, who stood 20 centimeters taller than Maradona. Shilton jumped forward with his right hand, while Maradona did so with his left arm outstretched. Maradona's fist, which was raised close to his head, touched the ball first and hit the ball into England's goal. Maradona began to celebrate while glancing sideways at the referee and the linesman for confirmation. He then fully celebrated the goal when it was given. Tunisian referee Ali Bennaceur gave the goal, but after the English players' protests he sought the advice of his second linesman who confirmed the goal. Mexican photographer Alejandro Ojeda Carbajal immortalized this moment in a photograph in which Maradona can be seen hitting the ball with his hand.  \\"History is already written\\"  In 2005, 19 years after scoring the controversial goal, Maradona confessed on a program La Noche del 10, that the goal was actually scored with his hand. In early 2008, The Sun newspaper published an article in which they implied that Maradona, during a visit to England, had apologized for what is described as \\"the infamous goal of The Hand of God\\". The newspaper first cites the phrase in this form: but later repeats the same quotation by adding the word \\"apologize\\" which did not appear in the first one, although it is the same sentence:and then completes the idea:Several world media outlets reported the news, creating controversy.[es:El Mercurio], Maradona pide perd√≥n por la \\"Mano de Dios\\" Even Peter Shilton rejected the apology, arguing that it was now too late.[es: La Tercera], Peter Shilton rechaz√≥ las disculpas de Maradona Maradona, a few days after the article came out, denied everything, saying that the newspaper had misquoted him. Maradona responded:A few days later, The Sun newspaper confirmed that it had modified the interpretation of Maradona's words and asked to change the name to The Devil's Hand. In the original text of the interview, it could be seen that Maradona had never asked for forgiveness for the goal from the Hand of God.  Falklands War and \\"symbolic revenge\\"  In the 2019 documentary film directed by Asif Kapadia, Maradona links the event to the Falklands War four years earlier: \\"We, as Argentinians, didn't know what the military was up to. They told us that we were winning the war. But in reality, England was winning 20-0. It was tough. The hype made it seem like we were going to play out another war. I knew it was my hand. It wasn't my plan but the action happened so fast that the linesman didn't see me putting my hand in. The referee looked at me and he said: 'Goal.' It was a nice feeling like some sort of symbolic revenge against the English.\\"  Subsequent use  The \\"Hand of God\\" became a popular phrase and reference to it is still made around the world. Here are some other famous football handballs; In the first round of the 1990 World Cup between Argentina and the USSR, in the first half of the 0‚Äì0 draw, a Soviet attack failed as Maradona intercepted the shot with \\"the hand of God\\" without the referee noticing.\\"13 June 1990: Diego Maradona's other World Cup handball\\". The Guardian. Retrieved 3 February 2015 During the final minutes of the second leg of the play-off for the 2010 World Cup between Ireland and France, William Gallas scored the decisive goal from a Thierry Henry assist that gave France a 2-1 aggregate victory and qualified them for the World Cup. Controversy followed immediately as replays were showing Henry repeatedly centering the ball with his hands moments prior to passing the ball to Gallas. Despite protests from the Irish side, Swedish referee Martin Hansson did not admonish Henry and allowed the goal. After the match ended, sporting news industries from around the world gave Henry's cross several nicknames, ranging from \\"The New Hand of God\\", to the more scathing \\"The Hand of Frog\\", the latter using an insulting term towards French people. Uruguayan footballer Luis Su√°rez illegally stopped with his hand a likely goal from Ghanaian Dominic Adiyiah in the quarter-finals of the 2010 FIFA World Cup. At the subsequent press conference, the striker said he had done so with the \\"Hand of God\\". On February 11, 2020, in Group G of the 2020 AFC Cup, Joshua Grommen of Ceres- Negros F.C. scored the second goal of their game against Preah Khan Reach Svay Rieng FC by diverting the ball into the net with his hand. Despite vocal protests from the opposing side, the goal was given as officials had failed to notice the blatant handball.

Currently operating in 44 states and Washington, D.C., Corps annually enroll more than 29,000 young men and women who annually mobilize approximately 227,000 community volunteers who in conjunction with Corpsmembers generate 21.3 million hours of service every year. Service and Conservation Corps are a direct descendant of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) that built parks and other public facilities still in use today. Like the legendary CCC of the 1930s, today's Corps are a proven strategy for giving young men and women the chance to change their communities, their own lives and those of their families. Service and Conservation Corps provide a wealth of valuable conservation, infrastructure improvement and human service projects. Some Corps tutor and some fight forest fires. Others complete a wide range of projects on public lands. Still others improve the quality of life in low- income communities by renovating deteriorated housing, engaging in environmental restoration, creating parks and gardens and staffing after- school programs.

She was among the first to report on the spread of Nazism from 1934 to 1938. She traveled widely in Europe and Asia, contributing articles to the Atlantic Monthly and other magazines. She was one of the few correspondents who reported from Communist China and Mongolia, reporting for the Saturday Evening Post for three and a half years, including reporting from the Korean War (1947-1951). She regularly contributed to the Atlantic Monthly from 1925 to 1962.

From childhood, she was interested in Chinese culture after learning of a family trading-connection with the Lin family of Hopei Province from the early 19th- century. China Having made contact with the family, she left Swarthmore College before graduating, and in 1920, set out for China.According to Women of History Nora Waln was born 4 June 1895. She ended up living for 12 years in the Lin household as a \\"daughter of affection\\" and developed this experience into her acclaimed memoir House of Exile, which was published in 1933. This gave readers an insiders look at Chinese culture and customs in a time of change following the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty. The family was considered \\"exiles\\" because a Lin had been ordered by thirteenth-century Mongol Emperor Kublai Khan to help work with the Grand Canal in Hopei, and had moved North from the family's Canton homestead.

Derivation Consider General Relativity in d spacetime dimensions. In the presence of an antisymmetric tensor field (without external sources), the Einstein Field equations, and the equations of motion for the antisymmetric tensor are :\\\\begin{align} R^{\\\\mu u}-\\\\frac{1}{2}R g^{\\\\mu u} = 8 \\\\pi T^{\\\\mu u}, ~~~~ abla_\\\\mu F^{\\\\mu \\\\, \\\\alpha_2 ... \\\\alpha_s} = 0 \\\\end{align} Where the stress-energy tensor takes the form : T^{\\\\mu u} = F_{\\\\alpha_1 ... \\\\alpha_{s-1}}~^\\\\mu F^{\\\\alpha_1 ... \\\\alpha_{s-1} u}-\\\\frac{1}{2s} F_{\\\\alpha_1 ... \\\\alpha_{s}} F^{\\\\alpha_1 ... \\\\alpha_{s}}g^{\\\\mu u} Being a rank s antisymmetric tensor, the field strength F has a natural ansatz for its solution, proportional to the Levi-Civita tensor on some s-dimensional manifold. :F^{\\\\mu_1 ... \\\\mu_{s}}=(\\\\epsilon^{\\\\mu_1 ... \\\\mu_{s}}/\\\\sqrt{g_s}) f Here, the indices \\\\mu_i run over s of the dimensions of the ambient d-dimensional spacetime, g_s is the determinant of the metric of this s-dimensional subspace, and f is some constant with dimensions of mass-squared (in natural units). Since the field strength is nonzero only on an s-dimensional submanifold, the metric g is naturally separated into two parts, of block-diagonal form : g_{\\\\mu u}=\\\\begin{bmatrix} g_{ m n}(x^p) & 0  0 & g_{\\\\bar{m} \\\\bar{n}}(x^{\\\\bar{p}}) \\\\end{bmatrix} with m, n, and p extending over the same s dimensions as the field strength F, and \\\\bar{m}, \\\\bar{n}, and \\\\bar{p} covering the remaining d-s dimensions. Having separated our d dimensional space into the product of two subspaces, Einstein's field equations allow us to solve for the curvature of these two sub-manifolds, and we find :\\\\begin{align} R_{d-s} &= \\\\frac{(s-1)(d-s)}{(d-2)}\\\\lambda, ~ ~ R_{s}=-\\\\frac{s(d-s-1)}{(d-2)}\\\\lambda  \\\\lambda &= 8 \\\\pi G \\\\sgn(g_s) \\\\end{align} We find that the Ricci curvatures of the s- and (d-s)-dimensional sub-manifolds are necessarily opposite in sign. One must have positive curvature, and the other must have negative curvature, and so one of these manifolds must be compact. Consequently, at scales significantly larger than that of the compact manifold, the universe appears to have either s or (d-s) dimensions, as opposed to the underlying d. As an important example of this, 11D-Supergravity contains a 3-form antisymmetric tensor with a 4-form field strength, and consequently prefers to compactify 7 or 4 of its space-like dimensions, so the large-scale spacetime must be either 4 or 7 dimensional, the former of which is attractive from a phenomenological perspective Perspective From String Theory Some important examples of Freund‚ÄìRubin compactification come from looking at the behavior of branes in string theory. Similar to the way that coupling to the electromagnetic field stabilizes electrically charged particles, the presence of antisymmetric tensor fields of various rank in a string theory stabilizes branes of various dimensions. In turn, the geometry of the spacetime near stacks of branes becomes warped in such a way that Freund‚ÄìRubin compactification is realized. In Type II-B string theory, which requires ten spacetime dimensions, there is a five-form field strength F_5 that allows for three dimensional D-branes, and the near horizon geometry of a stack of D3-branes is five-dimensional Anti-de Sitter space times a five-dimensional sphere, AdS_5 \\\\times S^5, which is compact in five dimensions. This geometry is an important part of the AdS/CFT correspondence. Similarly, M-theory and its low energy limit of 11D-Supergravity contain a 4-form field strength, that stabilizes M2 and M5 branes. The near horizon geometry of stacks of these branes are AdS_4 \\\\times S^7 and AdS_7 \\\\times S^4, respectively.

It is now maintained by the National Trust. Originally a goods transshipment point, before the construction of the Godalming Navigation the principal cargos were timber from the Surrey forests and gunpowder from the works at Chilworth as the Guildford authorities refused to let it pass through the town centre for loading at the town wharf. For a period of time at the beginning of the 20th Century, Dapdune Wharf was the centre of barge building on the Wey Navigation. Dapdune is now the starting point for boat trips, including boat hire. The Visitor Centre has interactive displays, a smithy, a stable, and two of the three remaining Wey barges in the world - the Reliance, permanently damaged and kept in a graving (dry) dock, and Perseverance IV, still floating but in need of repair and the subject of a 2010 National Trust restoration appeal. Dapdune Wharf is now the head office of the Navigation. As part of the continued preservation of British history the National Trust has a group of volunteers, the Wey Navigation Research Group, researching and publishing information about the Godalming and Wey Navigation. Wharf buildings Dapdune Wharf comprises a complex of a dozen buildings. Most are concerned with the construction and maintenance of the barges and stores for the various materials needed. They include a smithy, a barge repair shed at the end of a short cut from the bend in the river, a carpenters shed, formerly the sail loft, and the barge building shed at the north end of the site. There was also a graving dock with associated capstans for barges needing repairs below the water line. There were separate stores for gunpowder, part of the oldest building on the site, and for carbide, which was delivered from London for fuel for lamps. Two specialist buildings were the steam chest for bending wood to shape for boat ribs, and the tar chest for caulking. A cottage on the wharf, renovated in 1894 for the Edwards family, is a Grade II listed building. The other cottage, Dapdune Lea, was built at the same time for William Stevens III's sister, Mary Jane Stevens. Later their brother, John, added a first floor balcony in order to be able to watch the cricket in comfort. Dapdune Lea is now the National Trust's administrative offices for the navigations. Barge Building at Dapdune The Wey Navigation opened in 1653. Traffic on the Navigation grew very quickly. In its first year the owners took ¬£800 in tolls on goods carried. This quickly grew to ¬£15,000 per annum. One reason for this growth was the many mills that were built along the Wey plus the slow alternative means of transport. One of the largest remaining mills was built at Coxes Lock, near Addlestone. In the early days the Navigation was owned by the local landowners and business people. It was Sir Richard Weston of Sutton Place, Guildford who first had the idea of making the Wey navigable. By 1723 the Navigation was in the hands of the Langton family and the Earl of Portmore from Weybridge. Two families dominated the river and barge building on the Wey, the Stevens and the Edwards. =Stevens family= Over a period of 150 years the Stevens family played an important role in the development of the Wey Navigation. They started from being humble lock keepers to ownership and management of a substantial transport business along the Navigation and around the Guildford area. Four generations of the family were linked to the Navigation. * William Stevens (1777-1856) William was a trained carpenter and moved to the Wey in 1812 to take up the position of lock keeper at Trigg's Lock. In 1820 he and his family moved to Thames Lock. Thames Lock, being the entry and exit to the navigation, meant that William had wider duties than the other lock keepers. One of the duties was to calculate the tolls due from the barge owners. This is probably where William got his first taste of the business side of the Navigation. * William Stevens II (1810-1890) Born on the river, William followed his father into the business and it was under him that the family expanded into building and operating their own barges from 1840. William having learnt his trade by working in several yards as an apprentice. The family moved from Thames Lock and lived over the Navigation offices at 3 Friary Street, Guildford. One of their early barges, Perseverance was built at Guildford in 1840, though not at Dapdune. A number of barges carried the name but it was only the last, Perseverance IV, that was built at Dapdune. * William Stevens III (1844-1936) It was William III who brought the Edwards family to the Navigation and started to build the Wey barges at Dapdune. William also ran several steam tugs and a towage business on the river Thames. In 1902 the Stevens brothers gained full financial control and ownership of the Navigation. * Harry W. Stevens (1887-1970) The last of the family to be involved with the Navigations, Harry bequeathed the Wey Navigation to the National Trust on his retirement in 1964. =Edwards family= In 1894 William Stevens persuaded Edwin Edwards, a barge builder, to move his family of wife and family (4 sons and several daughters) from the Kennet and Avon Canal to work at Dapdune. The Stevens provided a cottage for Edwin and his family on site. Prior to coming to Guildford, Edwin Edwards had been working for a well established manufacturing firm at Honey Street, Devizes, supplying wooden barges for customers in the South-West of England. Edwin died in 1904 at the age of 46 and a further five years were to pass before William Stevens III could launch a newly built barge suitable for trade on the Wey Navigation. In October 1909 he launched his new barge Dapdune from the barge building shed at Dapdune. The barge had been built by Edwin's four sons in their spare time. The boys‚Äô main job was maintaining the Navigation, especially the locks. Dapdune remained in service until 1944. After 1909 the Edwards continued to build barges for the Stevens as a part-time occupation and completed eleven barges over the next thirty years. As well as their duties along the Navigation the Edwards brothers also maintained the barges and carried out any necessary repairs. Construction of a Wey barge Wey barge Reliance The Wey barge was built on the earlier western barge designs and the first barges built specifically for use on the Wey were probably built at Honey Street Wharf, Devizes. The earliest that this could be was 1810 as the Kennet and Avon Canal was opened through to the Thames that year. The ribs of the hull were built from oak. There was a steam chest behind the shed (now the public toilet block) where the wood could be shaped. However the Edwards family preferred to find wood naturally shaped. The hull was planked with pitch pine. Pitch pine was used because it was lightweight and came in long lengths so required less joints. Elm was tried, and although it was more water resistant, it was heavier and therefore the barge had a lower cargo capacity. The barge was flat bottomed and straight sided, this meant that it could operate in shallow water with a reasonable cargo. Once the hull was complete it was covered in pitch to create a watertight finish. The barge was built on trestles to keep it off the ground and assist in launching. Only the hull was built in the shed. On completion the water side of the shed was removed and the barge was launched sideways. The barge was then towed up to the area where the pleasure boats are moored today and it was here that fitting out was completed. This was also the area used to repair barges. The Wey barge was in length and the width was constrained by the narrowest lock to . A barge would have only centimetres to spare when going through the lock. A Wey barge could carry 80 tonnes of cargo from the Thames to Coxes mill. From Coxes going upstream the capacity was reduced to 50 tonnes as far as Guildford and further reduced for the journey to Godalming owing to the decrease in the depth of water available. Goods carried by the barges A variety of goods were transported along the navigation, for example: * Wheat grain or barley from Victoria Docks in London to Coxes mill. * Gunpowder from Chilworth to Barking or Woolwich * Wood pulp from London docks to Woking paper mill * Timber from Guildford to London. With no engines or sails the barges were towed by horses or people, and occasionally poled or rowed. Once a Wey barge reached the Thames it would be towed by tug boats. The horses were rested in stables along the Navigation. The Navigation owned three stables, at Thames lock, Coxes Mill and Friary Street. The bargemen would pay to use the stables. Local inns along the towpath also provided stabling facilities.

Named for counties in South Carolina and West Virginia, she was the only U.S. Naval vessel to bear the name. LST-279 was laid down on 2 July 1943 at Ambridge, Pennsylvania by the American Bridge Company; launched on 19 September 1943; sponsored by Miss Marion Ruth Warsack; and commissioned at New Orleans, Louisiana on 25 October 1943 with Lieutenant Charles A. Palm, USNR, in command. Service history =World War II, 1943-1945= After fitting out at the Naval Station Algiers, New Orleans, LST-279 loaded supplies and ammunition before proceeding to St. Andrews Bay, Panama City, Florida for her shakedown cruise. While there, her crew practiced beach maneuvers and held communications and gunnery drills. In mid-November, she returned to New Orleans where the tank landing ship (LST) received minor alterations at the Pendleton Ship Yards. She then proceeded independently to New York, and from there on to Davisville, Rhode Island to load supplies and cargo. Moving on to Halifax, Nova Scotia in early January 1944, she got underway in convoy for Europe later that month. After arriving at Plymouth, England on 7 February and unloading tank deck cargo, the LST engaged in various training maneuvers between Plymouth, Salcombe, and Dartmouth off the southern coast of England. Assigned to Flotilla 28 in May, the tank landing ship was placed under British operational control for the upcoming landings in France. She then spent the days immediately before the Normandy invasion in the western Solent, Southampton, undergoing further training with British troops. On 6 June 1944 LST-279 moved from Southampton to Portsmouth, where she loaded British troops and vehicles before joining a convoy for Normandy. On the morning of 7 June, the tank landing ship beached and unloaded her charges in the Green sector of Juno Beach. Casualties then came on board for the return trip to Portsmouth. On her next convoy run, however, the tank landing ship ran into trouble. German E-boats, operating from Cherbourg, torpedoed the ocean tug and closed the LST convoy. Before nearby escorts drove off the attackers, one E-boat torpedo narrowly missed LST-279, passing 20 feet from her bow, but went on to damage instead. Over the next two months, LST-279 made over a dozen more shuttle trips, carrying troops, ammunition, and supplies from England to the beachheads in France. Starting in August 1944, she made routine operational trips from Portland, England, to the Normandy beaches and to the French ports of Rouen, Le Havre, Cherbourg, and Saint-Michel-en-Gr√®ve. By the time she departed for home in June 1945, LST-279 had made 74 Channel crossings in support of the Allied armies in Europe. After unloading cargo at Norfolk, Virginia the tank landing ship proceeded to New Orleans for maintenance availability and repairs. Following a short post-repair cruise to Galveston, Texas LST-279 moved to Green Cove Springs, Florida on the St. Johns River in Florida, where she joined the Atlantic Reserve Fleet on 12 October 1945. LST-279 was decommissioned there on 27 June 1946. =Atlantic Fleet, 1951-1955 = On 20 July 1950 in consequence of the June 1950 invasion of South Korea by communist North Korea and the ensuing mobilization of units in the reserve fleet, the tank landing ship was tapped for activation the following year. On 5 April 1951 LST-279 was recommissioned at Green Cove Springs and reported to the Atlantic Fleet for duty. The tank landing ship operated out of Norfolk for the next three and a half years, carrying out a variety of training missions and hauling cargo up and down the east coast. In January 1955 she sailed south, passed through the Panama Canal, and steamed to Long Beach, California. There, LST-279 commenced inactivation procedures after being transferred to the Pacific Reserve Fleet on 1 February. LST-279 was decommissioned at Long Beach on 14 June 1955. =Republic of China, 1955-1978= On 30 June 1955, the tank landing ship was transferred to the Nationalist Chinese Navy, in which she served as Chung Chie (LST-218). Although named USS Berkeley County (LST-279) on 1 July 1955 she never returned to Navy service, and her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 25 April 1960. The tank landing ship served in the Taiwanese Navy until scrapped sometime during 1978. LST-279 earned one battle star for World War II service.

During 2012 to 2017, Peng was the President of then People's Liberation Army Academy of Art, and from 2005 to 2010, served as Vice President of the All-China Youth Federation. Peng gained popularity as a soprano singer from her regular appearances on the annual CCTV New Year's Gala, a widely viewed mainland Chinese television program that airs during the Chinese New Year. Peng has won many honors in singing competitions nationwide. Peng's most famous singles include \\"People from Our Village\\" (), \\"Zhumulangma\\" (Mount Everest; ) and \\"In the Field of Hope\\" (). Peng also sang the theme songs of several popular TV series, such as The Water Margin (1998). She also starred in musical productions. In 1986, she received the Plum Blossom Award, China's highest theatrical award, for her lead role in The White Haired Girl. Peng was a civilian member of China's People's Liberation Army, and held the civilian rank equivalent to Major General before she was appointed the Art Academy's dean, upon which she was given the formal rank. She is known for her world- class fashion appearances, specifically on traditional Chinese styles, credited to her personal couturier Ma Ke. In 2014, Peng was listed as the 57th Most Powerful Woman in the World by Forbes.  Biography  Peng and Juliana Awada, the First Lady of Argentina, in the Quinta de Olivos, Buenos Aires, December 2018. Peng Liyuan is a native of Yuncheng County, Shandong province. Peng joined the People's Liberation Army in 1980, when she was 18 years old, and began as an ordinary soldier. Because of her vocal talent, Peng later performed during frontline tours to boost troop morale during the Sino- Vietnamese border conflicts. Peng first performed nationally and came to fame during the earliest rendition of the CCTV New Year's Gala in 1982, when she performed On the Plains of Hope. Peng has been married to Xi Jinping for over 30 years. Together they have a daughter named Xi Mingze () born in 1992, nicknamed Xiao Muzi (). For the greater part of their relationship, Peng has enjoyed a very positive reputation within China, comparable to that of her politician husband. Since her husband became General Secretary of the Communist Party (de facto paramount leader) in November 2012, and Chinese President (de jure head of state) in March 2013, the American press refers to her as the First Lady of China. Xi and Peng were introduced by friends as many Chinese couples were in the 1980s. Xi was reputedly academic during their courtship, inquiring about singing techniques. Xi was the son of famous Chinese revolutionary Xi Zhongxun, and Peng's family obviously accepted the relationship with ease, due to his attitude. After parental consent, the couple married on 1 September 1987 in Xiamen, Fujian. Four days later, Peng Liyuan returned to Beijing to appear in the National Art Festival, and then immediately departed for the United States and Canada to perform. Since that time, Xi and Peng have led largely separate lives, with Peng spending most of her time in Beijing, and her husband spending his time in Fujian and later in Zhejiang. Peng is actively involved in politics, and is a member of the 11th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Peng is a WHO Goodwill Ambassador for tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS since 2011. On 20 November 2014, Massey University in New Zealand conferred Peng an Honorary Doctorate in recognition of her international contributions to performing arts, health, and education. Peng sang in a song-and-dance number in 2007 shown on Chinese television, that featured Tibetans thanking the Chinese military for liberating them.As China Readies for Transition, 7 Tibetan Self- Immolations in 7 Days, Time, 29 October 2012.  Controversy and criticism  Directly after the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 in June 1989, Peng Liyuan sang for the martial-law troops. A photo showing the scene in which Peng, wearing a green military uniform, sings to helmeted and rifle-bearing troops seated in rows on Beijing's Tiananmen Square, was swiftly scrubbed from China's Internet before it could generate discussion online. However, the image ‚Äî seen and shared by outside observers ‚Äî revived a memory of the leadership's preference to suppress. The image was from the back cover of a 1989 issue of the People's Liberation Army Pictorial, a publicly available military magazine. In June 2013, the American Foreign Policy magazine's article Why Michelle Obama Shouldn't Meet With Peng Liyuan, approved the First Lady of the United States Michelle Obama's choice not to meet with Peng Liyuan who allegedly sang in support of Chinese troops in Tiananmen Square in 1989, following a crackdown on protesters on 4 June. Nevertheless, Michelle Obama met Peng in a number of highly publicised tours in both Beijing and Washington, D.C.Why Michelle Obama shouldn't meet with Peng Liyuan, Foreign Policy, 5 June 2013.‰∏çË¶ãÂΩ≠È∫óÂ™õ Èô∏Á∂≤ÂèãÈÖ∏ËúúÈõ™ÂÖí , Apple Daily, 7 June 2013.

After being arrested on February 6, 1694, she committed suicide, refusing to return to a life of slavery. She is a mysterious figure today, because not much is known about her life. Most of the stories about her are varied and disconnected.. She and her husband Zumbi dos Palmares, the last king of the Quilombo dos Palmares, had three children.  Personality and abilities  Described as a hero, Dandara dominated the techniques of capoeira and fought many battles alongside men and women to defend Palmares, the place where escaped slaves would go to live safely. Palmares was established in the 17th century in the Serra da Barriga, in the state of Alagoas, because it was difficult to access the area due to its dense vegetation. It is unknown if she was born in Brazil or in Africa. When she was a young girl, she joined a group of Afro-Brazilians to fight against slavery in Brazil. She helped create strategies to protect Palmares. Dandara was known as a fighter, but she also had interests in hunting and agriculture. She planted corn, cassava, beans, sweet potatoes, sugar cane, and bananas. The people of Palmares, known as Palmarinos, produced tools for agriculture and weapons for war. They also worked with wood, ceramics, and metals. Initially, all of the activities and work of the Palmarinos was to create their self-sustaining community, but some did trades with villages and mills in the region. Attacks to Palmares became frequent starting in 1630, with the Dutch invasion in Brazil. According to the stories regarding Dandara, she had an important role in making her husband cut ties with his uncle Ganga-Zumba, who was the first big chief of Quilombo dos Palmares. In 1678, Ganga-Zumba signed a peace treaty with the government of the state of Pernambuco. The treaty stated that people of Palmares who had been arrested were to be released. Also, all those born in Palmares were to be free people, not slaves, and they were granted permission to engage in commerce. However, in exchange, the people of Palmares had to stop giving refuge to any new runaway slaves and hand over to the Portuguese authorities any such runaways seeking shelter. Dandara and Zumbi dos Palmares are said to have opposed the deal because it did not end slavery, and in fact made Palmares complicit in its perpetuation. Ganga-Zumba was killed by one of the Palmarinos who opposed his proposal.

Route (sections) # The first part of the R772 starts at J12 (Newtownmountkennedy North) on the N11. The route travels through the main street of Newtownmountkennedy, then on to Killadeernan and Newcastle Hospital. This route was the original R772. The road then travels southwest and then east up and down hill via existing single track local roads. The route then goes under the present N11 to Coynes Cross. The road follows the old N11 to Ashford, where it connects to the R764 at a roundabout in the village centre. The road then crosses the River Vartry and travels through Ashford, passing Mount Usher Gardens. The road continues over the N11 and into Rathnew. In Rathnew, the road takes a right turn at the village roundabout and continues to J17 (Wicklow South) of the N11. # The route begins again at J20 (Arklow North). The road travels through northern Arklow, over the River Avoca and up Arklow main street. The road then travels through south Arklow. The R772 then crosses the Wicklow-Wexford border and onwards via the old N11 to Inch. The road travels through Gorey, Clogh, and connects to J24 of the M11 at Clogh Roundabout. The road continues along the old N11 through Camolin and Ferns, and meets the N30 and N80 at the Scarawalsh Roundabout, and continues through the Clavass Roundabout.

Built by German Jochen Dauer's Dauer Racing, a racing version of this car went on to win the 1994 24 Hours of Le Mans with the support of Porsche. The first road car debuted at the 1993 Frankfurt Auto Show. In total 13 cars were made.  Changes to meet road regulations  Dauer Racing (now Dauer Sportwagen) produced the 962 Le Mans from stripped down Porsche 962 bodies for modification.QV500.com: Dauer 962 LM Components of the bodywork were replaced with slightly revised carbon fiber and kevlar panels. The under tray was replaced with a flat version for better stability at high speeds.QV500.com: Dauer 962 LM sport A second seat and leather upholstery were installed in the cramped cockpit, as well as a video screen for DVD playback in later years. A small compartment was added to the front of the car to carry luggage. A hydraulic suspension system was also added to meet German ride height requirements for street cars.Supercars.net  Specifications  The 962 Le Mans uses nearly the same engine as the racing 962: Porsche's water-cooled Type-935 2994 cc Flat-6 with two K√ºhnle, Kopp und Kausch AG turbochargers. Since the road car did not have to meet racing regulations, the air restrictor was removed allowing for an output of approximately . The 5-speed racing gearbox was also retained. The drivetrain also stood the same, being rear- wheel-drive. A top speed of was independently measured in 1998. Other performance figures included a 0- in 2.8 seconds and 0- in 7.3 seconds. The Dauer 962 was called the 'fastest street-legal production car in the world' in the Evo September 2003 issue.Evo September 2003: p.106-109 It was succeeded by the Bugatti Veyron which reached in 2007.  Motorsports  Following rule changes in the World Sportscar Championship in 1992 which saw Porsche 962 numbers dwindle in Europe, including at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, Porsche was looking for ways to continue their sports car efforts. Although 962s were still legal at Le Mans, the cars were subjected to newer technical regulations that negatively affected their performance, subsequently ceasing to be competitive against the current top entrants in its class. With the re- introduction of production-based grand tourer-style cars in 1993, the Automobile Club de l'Ouest (ACO) had created a loophole as no specific number of road-going examples was established within its homologation requirements. With Dauer's success in modifying a Porsche 962 into a street-legal car in 1993, Porsche saw an opportunity to bring the 962 back into competition. With the first production car shown to the public in 1993, Porsche had only to meet certain design criteria--the requirement that production-based cars have storage space for a typical suitcase had already been fulfilled, as the Dauer road car was able to carry luggage. The flat bottom of the 962 Le Mans also fit with GT rules.Porsche USA - 1994 Dauer 962 Three more modifications were necessary to fully comply: Narrower tires than the 962 had run in Group C, a larger fuel tank (now up to 120 litres), and the reinstallation of a restrictor for the engine, although this one would be larger than the one they had run in Group C. The flat bottom and narrow tires of the 962 Le Mans would hinder the performance of the car over the long laps at Le Mans even with the increased power from the GT-class air restrictor. However Porsche believed that the larger fuel tank they were allowed in the GT-class would allow them to overcome this lack of speed by spending less time in the pits than the Group C cars, something which is key for an endurance race. A total of two Dauer 962 Le Mans race cars were built. Arriving at Le Mans with the support of Porsche's factory racing team, Joest Racing, Dauer's two cars showed that they lacked the overall pace of the top Group C cars by qualifying fifth and seventh. However their pace in their class was shattering as the next closest GT1-class car could only muster 12th. The race saw Porsche's plan pan out, as the Dauer 962 Le Mans were able to gradually make their way to the top of the standings while their competitors spent time in the pits or succumbed to mechanical woes. In the end, only a lone Toyota 94C-V in the Group C class could contend with the Dauers, taking second place overall. The Dauer 962 Le Mans of Yannick Dalmas, Hurley Haywood, and Mauro Baldi would take the overall win while the second team car would finish one lap behind in third place overall. Soon after this event the ACO attempted to fix the loophole in the GT regulations by setting a minimum requirement for production cars to meet homologation standards. With this, the Dauer 962s would never race again, nor would the normal Porsche 962s as the Group C class was finally abandoned.

During World War II, he worked for the Special Operations Executive and was involved in clandestine missions in Ethiopia, China, and particularly Albania. In 1954 he served as a Unionist Member of Parliament for Inverness. Family and education McLean was born in Sutherland, the elder son of Neil Gillean McLean, who had made a great deal of money trading with India and owned an estate at Glencalvie. The family called him \\"Billy\\". He was educated at Eton College, where he excelled in fencing,\\"Fencing\\", The Times, 8 April 1936. becoming Captain of the school team.\\"Eton College\\", The Times, 4 May 1936. He was then sent to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst to train to become an officer. Having spent his holiday periods fox hunting, he was a keen sportsman and won many point to point races while attending Sandhurst. WWII and Army service In August 1938 on leaving Sandhurst, McLean was commissioned into the Royal Scots Greys. The following year he was posted to Palestine and spent the first two years of the Second World War there. In 1941, he was transferred to the Special Operations Executive, an unorthodox military unit which worked behind enemy lines on sabotage and espionage. After completing his training he was sent to join Col. Wingate's Gideon Force in Ethiopia, where he commanded a mixed group of Ethiopian and Eritrean irregulars (nicknamed \\"McLean's Foot\\") against the occupying Italian army. For his efforts he was awarded the Distinguished Military Medal of Haile Selassie I in 1941. 1942 saw McLean shifted to a staff job with the Special Operations Executive (SOE); first in Cairo, Egypt then in Syria and back in Palestine. He also worked for MI9 in Istanbul aiding resistance fighters in Nazi-occupied countries. Albanian missions In early 1943 McLean was selected by SOE to lead a mission in occupied Albania, for which he was promoted to Major. His team was parachuted behind enemy lines in April 1943, where they made contact with the partisan National Liberation Movement (LAN√á) and the nationalist, anti-Communist, anti-Zog movement, the Balli Komb√´tar.Albania by Gloyer, Gillian; 'Bradt Travel Guides; Fifth edition. 1 March 2015; pp. 13-14 McLean then organized them into the 1st Partisan Brigade, and arranged their training and armament. After his evacuation from Albania in November 1943, McLean was awarded the Distinguished Service Order \\"Army Awards\\", The Times, 24 March 1944. and promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel. However, even after he left tension between the partisans and the nationalists in Albania was still causing concern to SOE at which point the Foreign Office and McLean devised a plan to unite them in a common struggle against the Axis forces there. In April 1944, exactly one year later, McLean returned to Albania with a small team known as \\"The Musketeers\\" which included Major David Smiley and Captain Julian Amery. Unfortunately they could not persuade the nationalists to join with the partisans; nor could McLean get SOE-HQ in Bari to support his nominee to lead the partisan fight against the Axis powers, Abaz Kupi. Meanwhile, the partisans grew suspicious of this outside interference, and eventually McLean and his team had to be withdrawn. Ironically, British strategy was subsequently altered to recognize only the LAN√á who went on to convert Albania into a Communist state. Post-war Early in 1945 McLean volunteered to work for SOE against the Japanese forces in China and was appointed military advisor to Sir Clarmont Skrine, the British consul in Kashgar. He was still working undercover there when the war ended. After some years traveling in the late 1940s, McLean resigned his commission and returned to Albania one last time, joining a clandestine organization operated by the United States and British intelligence agencies to undermine Enver Hoxha and the Communist government there. In 1949 he married Da≈°ka Ivanoviƒá, from Dubrovnik in Croatia. Coincidentally his new brother-in-law, diplomat Vane Ivanovic, had been a member of the Yugoslav section of the Political Warfare Executive (PWE), the propaganda arm of SOE, during the war. Entry to politics At the 1950 general election, McLean ran as the Conservative Party candidate for Preston South, a newly created constituency which was expected to be marginal. He was defeated by 149 votes. He stood again in the 1951 general election, but was again defeated by the extremely narrow margin of 16 votes. This was the smallest majority in any constituency in that election.\\"Polls Apart\\", The Times, 27 October 1951. In the summer of 1952, McLean was chosen as the Unionist Party candidate for Inverness, where the sitting Member of Parliament Lord Malcolm Douglas-Hamilton intended to stand down. He toured the constituency continuously, familiarizing himself with its problems and speaking to local groups.\\"Speculation In Inverness\\", The Times, 4 December 1954. Lord Malcolm resigned in autumn 1954 and a by-election was called for 21 December. The Liberal Party was strong in the constituency and campaigned against the practice of \\"plural farming\\" by which landowners farmed multiple farms with a single labour force, and which was unpopular with agricultural workers.\\"Dilemma In The Highlands\\", The Times, 13 December 1954. McLean's work in nursing the constituency paid off as he was elected by 1,331 votes.\\"Inverness Stays Conservative\\", The Times, 24 December 1954. Owing to illness, McLean did not make his maiden speech until March 1956, and he chose to speak about Egypt and Gamal Abdel Nasser whom he regarded with extreme concern.\\"Parliament\\", The Times, 8 March 1956.\\"Unreconstructed Nationalists and a Minor Gunboat Operation: Julian Amery, Neil McLean and the Suez Crisis\\", by Onslowa, Sue - Contemporary British History, Volume 20, Issue 1, 2006, pages 73-99. McLean was a strong supporter of the decision to invade Egypt during the Suez Crisis, and an equally strong opponent of the decision shortly thereafter to withdraw. The Members of Parliament who took this view were known as the \\"Suez Group\\"; McLean did not join those who abandoned the Conservative whip in 1957, but did declare that he was in sympathy with them and that \\"the M.P.s who have resigned have raised the flag for many of us who have not resigned\\".\\"Possible Tory Abstentions\\", The Times, 15 May 1957. In general McLean's Parliamentary contributions were concentrated on foreign affairs. He also visited areas of concern, including French Indochina and Algeria to find the situation on the ground, and reported back to British newspapers. In September 1962 while visiting Algeria he was pinned down for an hour by a firefight between rival groups.\\"No Rush To Vote In Algeria\\", The Times, 21 September 1962. That year he also began to work with Muhammad al- Badr in resisting Egyptian efforts to install an ally as President of North Yemen where he became the principal military advisor to the Royalist forces. He persuaded the Foreign Office not to recognize the Communist-backed government in the country; an accomplishment described by McLean's biographer Xan Fielding as his \\"crowning achievement\\".Xan Fielding, \\"One Man in His Time - The life of Lieutenant-Colonel NLD ('Billy') McLean, DSO\\" (Macmillan, London, 1990), p. 156. In June 1964 McLean introduced a Private Members Bill aimed at protecting some paper mills, shipbuilding and cotton firms which had received government grants from nationalization.\\"Parliament\\", The Times, 24 June 1964. During the 1964 general election he found himself under severe pressure from the Liberal Party and ended up losing his seat. Final years Being out of Parliament left McLean more time to travel, especially in the Middle East. He kept up his work in Yemen, and had contacts with most of the Muslim Arab states including Jordan where he had developed a close relationship with then monarch King Hussein. Fielding claimed that he was a kind of \\"unofficial under-secretary\\" of the Foreign Office,Fielding op cit, p. 170. and quoted a 1979 letter from Harold Macmillan which said \\"You are one of those people whose services to our dear country are known only to a few\\".Fielding op cit, p. 208. In his retirement he was appointed to the Royal Company of Archers, the Queen's bodyguard in Scotland. McLean suffered from diabetes and septicaemia and died of heart failure in 1986. At his side were his family, including his step-grandson, the actor Cary Elwes.Elwes, Cary, As You Wish: Inconceivable Tales from the Making of The Princess Bride (2014) Touchstone; First edition (14 October 2014) All of his diaries, notes and orders kept meticulously from all his campaigns now reside in the Imperial War Museum.

The advancement program is often considered to be divided into two phases. The first phase from joining to First Class is designed to teach the scout Scoutcraft skills, how to participate in a group and to learn self-reliance. The Scout badge is awarded when the Scout demonstrates a rudimentary knowledge of the Scouting ideals and program. Tenderfoot, Second Class, and First Class have progressively harder requirements in the areas of Scoutcraft, physical fitness, citizenship, personal growth and Scout Spirit. The second phase: Star, Life, and Eagle, is designed to develop leadership skills and allow the Scout to explore potential vocations and avocations through the merit badge program. The Star and Life ranks require that the scout serve in a position of responsibility and perform community service. Except for Scout rank (and Eagle Palms as of August 1, 2017), all ranks require that the candidate participate in a Scoutmaster conference and pass a Board of Review. Advancement process Merit badges and rank may be earned by any registered Scout until their eighteenth birthday. Venturers and Sea Scouts who earned First Class as Scouts BSA members may continue to work towards Eagle Scout in their crew or ship until age eighteen. Scouts participate in a Scoutmaster conference as a requirement for each rank. For ranks other than the Scout rank, when all other requirements have been completed, the Scout appears before a board of review as the final requirement. =Scoutmaster conference= The Scoutmaster conference is a meeting between the Scoutmaster and the Scout and is a requirement for each rank. The Scoutmaster reviews the Scout's progress and ensures all requirements have been met. The Scout is expected to show how he has grown in his understanding of the Scouting ideals, including the Scout Oath and the Scout Law, and how he has applied those ideals. The Scoutmaster will also discuss the next steps in advancement and encourages the Scout to advance. =Board of review= The board of review is a group of three to six members of the troop committee and is the final approval process for Scout rank advancement. The board reviews the Scout to ensure all requirements are met and attempts to determine the Scout's attitude and their acceptance of Scouting's ideals and their application. The board also solicits the Scout's opinions on the troop program and on youth and adult leadership. Eagle Scout The Eagle Scout board of review is convened by the council or district. Members are selected by council policy and may include troop committee members, district or council Eagle representatives or community members with an understanding of the Eagle board. There must be at least one district or council Eagle representative. Scouts must attain the requirements for this rank prior to their 18th birthday, though the board of review itself can be done after the 18th birthday. Rank advancement =Emblems= The program uses a series of medals and patches as emblems. The badge for the Scout rank consists of a simple fleur-de-lis, which symbolizes a compass needle. The needle points the Scout in the right direction, which is onward and upward. The Tenderfoot badge takes the fleur-de-lis of the Scout badge and adds two stars and an eagle with an American shield. The stars symbolize truth and knowledge; the eagle and shield symbolize freedom and readiness to defend it. The Second Class badge features a scroll inscribed with the Scout Motto, BE PREPARED, with the ends turned up and a knotted rope hanging from the bottom. The knot reminds each Scout to remember the Scout slogan, Do a Good Turn Daily, and the upturned ends of the scroll symbolize cheerfulness in service. The First Class badge combines the elements of the Tenderfoot and Second Class badges. For many years, the First Class badge was used as the official emblem of the BSA. Star has a First Class symbol on a five-pointed yellow star, and initially indicated the five merit badges required to earn the rank. Life has a First Class emblem on a red heart, and initially symbolized the first-aid and health-related merit badges that the rank required. Now it signifies that the ideals of Scouting have become a part of the Scout's life and character. The rank insignia have been around since the beginning. The current design for the Eagle Scout badge was adopted in 1985, with minor modifications in 1986 and 1989. The Eagle Scout medal is of the same basic design as in 1915, with only occasional slight modifications due to changes in manufacturer over time, most recently in 1999. The current design of the other rank badges were finalized in 1990. For the BSA's centennial year of 2010, special rank badges were available. For each badge from Scout through Life, the badge design is encircled by brown lettering that says \\"2010 (Rank) Scout\\", and \\"Boy Scouts of America\\". For the Eagle badge, which already had the design surrounded by white lettering (\\"Eagle Scout\\"/\\"Boy Scouts of America\\") the only change is the addition of \\"2010\\" before \\"Eagle\\". These badges could be earned during 2010 only. For the Eagle Scout's centennial year of 2012, on the Eagle Scout badge only, it states Centennial on the writing around the badge. =Scout= Scout was previously a joining badge, but is now considered the first rank, and is earned by completing certain requirements. As of January 2016, the Scout badge has a gold fleur-de-lis on a tan background. The badge is awarded when the youth demonstrates a rudimentary knowledge of Scouting skills and ideals such as tying a square knot and knowing the Scout oath, law, motto, and slogan. =Tenderfoot= Tenderfoot is the second rank a scout can earn. A Scout can work on the requirements for the Tenderfoot, Second Class, and First Class ranks at the same time, but each rank must be earned in sequence. The badge is awarded when the Scout completes requirements in the areas of Scoutcraft, physical fitness, citizenship, personal growth, and Scout Spirit. The badge is similar to that of the Scout rank with it adding an eagle and two stars. =Second Class= Second Class is the rank above Tenderfoot and below First Class. A Scout can work on the requirements for the Tenderfoot, Second Class, and First Class ranks at the same time, but must be earned in sequence. The badge is awarded when the Scout completes requirements in the areas of Scoutcraft, physical fitness, citizenship, personal growth and Scout Spirit. =First Class= First Class is the rank above Second Class and below Star Scout. A Scout can work on the requirements for the Tenderfoot, Second Class, and First Class ranks at the same time, but must earn them in sequence. The badge is awarded when the Scout completes requirements in the areas of Scoutcraft, physical fitness, citizenship, personal growth and Scout Spirit. At this point, Scouts shift focus from learning physical Scouting method to start developing leadership skills. Originally, First Class was the all around Scout and the final and highest rank. Later ranks were originally recognitions of earning merit badges beyond First Class, and not properly ranks. Now these additional ranks form a second tier where Scouts can further develop leadership skills and explore potential vocations and avocations through the merit badge program. Although Eagle is the highest rank and one all Scouts should strive for, the number of Scouts achieving First Class within one year of joining is still one of the key measures of unit effectiveness. Studies purportedly have shown that if a Scout achieves First Class within a year of joining, he typically stays in the Scout program for at least three years. Scouts who do so are purportedly more likely to retain Scout values as an adult and achieve the BSA primary mission of \\"producing useful citizens\\". From 1972 to 1990, the First Aid merit badge was required for First Class rank. After 1990, this was replaced with a series of requirements to demonstrate awareness of advanced first aid techniques, including CPR. A sixth merit badge was added to the requirement for Star rank at that time to maintain its overall requirement of 21 merit badges, and First Aid is still one of the merit badges that is mandatory for Eagle Scout. =Star= Star is the rank above First Class and below Life Scout. It is the third-highest rank. Star is awarded when the Scout serves actively in the troop, team or crew in a position of responsibility for at least 4 months; performs at least six hours of community service; and earns six merit badges (four of which must be among the 13 required for Eagle Scout rank). Initially, the Life badge was awarded for five merit badges and the Star badge was awarded for ten. The order was reversed in the 1920s when it was decided that the five-pointed star of Star Scout better represented the five merit badges required for first rank above First Class. That symbolism disappeared when the number of merit badges required for Star was increased to six in 1990. =Life= Life is the second-highest rank attainable, above Star and below Eagle. Life is awarded when the Scout serves actively in the troop, team or crew, serves in a position of responsibility for six months, and performs six hours of community service. A Scout must also earn five merit badges (at least three of which must be required for the rank of Eagle) for a total of 11, including the six previously earned. Finally, the Scout must pass a Scoutmaster conference, and board of review. Life was originally lower than Star, and originally required earning five specific merit badges concerned with health and fitness (First Aid, Lifesaving, Public Health, Personal Health and Athletics). The ranks were switched in the 1920s, following a decision to recognize the five-pointed star as a symbol of the five badges needed to earn that rank. The Life heart came to symbolize achievement in health and fitness, as the First Aid merit badge was required for both Life and Eagle until 1972, when it became required for all ranks above First Class. =Eagle= Eagle Scout is the highest rank attainable in the Eagle Scout (Scouts BSA) division of the BSA. Since its introduction in 1911, the Eagle Scout rank has been earned by more than two million young men. Requirements include earning a minimum total of 21 merit badges, including all required badges that were not previously earned, and demonstration of Scout Spirit, service and leadership. This includes an extensive service project that the Scout plans, organizes, leads, and manages. Use in other BSA programs The seven ranks are fully applicable to the Scouts BSA program, and most earning of these ranks occurs within that program. They are also offered to a more limited extent in other older scout programs.

Although several separate sightings had been made by numerous witnesses in the weeks leading up to September 3, the specific incident, eventually to become by far the most famous, involved a local teenager and two police officers. The November/December 2011 edition of Skeptical Inquirer offers an explanation of the incident, based on details reported by the eyewitnesses. The Muscarello sighting On September 3, 1965, at approximately 2:00 a.m., 18 year old Norman Muscarello was hitchhiking to his home in Exeter along New Hampshire Route 150. Muscarello had recently graduated from high school and was three weeks away from leaving for service in the United States Navy. He had been visiting his girlfriend at her parents' home in nearby Amesbury, Massachusetts; since he did not own a car, he would hitchhike to and from his girlfriend's home, a distance of about ; however, at that hour of the morning there was little traffic on the highway, and Muscarello had walked a good part of the distance. After reaching Kensington, a few miles outside Exeter, Muscarello noticed five flashing bright red lights in a field, which he initially thought might be the lights of a police car or fire engine. The lights illuminated the surrounding woods and two nearby houses in brilliant red light and made absolutely no sound. (One house belonged to the Dining family, who were not at home at the time.) Muscarello became terrified as the object, which he estimated to be in diameter, began to move silently towards him; he dived into a ditch beside the road. The lights changed direction and hovered over the Dining farmhouse; Muscarello ran to the house, pounded on the door and yelled for help, but no one answered. The object then moved away and disappeared into the woods. Seeing the headlights of an approaching car, Muscarello ran into the road and forced it to stop. The middle-aged couple in the car drove the frightened youth to the Exeter police station. At the police station, Muscarello, pale and visibly shaken, told his story to officer Reginald Toland, who worked the night desk. Toland knew Muscarello, and was impressed by his obvious fear and genuinely agitated state. Toland radioed police officer Eugene Bertrand, Jr., who earlier in the evening had passed a distressed woman sitting in her car on NH 108. When Bertrand stopped to ask if she had a problem, the woman told him that a \\"huge object with flashing red lights\\" had followed her car from Epping, away and hovered over the car before flying away. Bertrand considered her a \\"kook\\", but did stay with her for approximately fifteen minutes until she had calmed down and was ready to resume her drive. After arriving at the police station and hearing Muscarello's story, Bertrand decided to drive back to the Dining farm with Muscarello to investigate the field where he had seen the lights. Officers Bertrand and Hunt Bertrand drove Muscarello back to the area of his sighting. From Bertrand's patrol car they at first saw nothing unusual. However, when they left the car and walked towards the woods where Muscarello had first seen the objects, some horses in a nearby corral began kicking the fence and sides of a barn, making loud, frightened noises; dogs in the area also began barking and howling. Bertrand and Muscarello then saw an object slowly rise from the trees beyond the corral. Bertrand described the UFO as \\"this huge, dark object as big as a barn over there, with red flashing lights on it.\\" The object moved silently towards them, swaying back and forth. Instinctively remembering his police training, Bertrand drew his revolver, and pointed it at the object. He then decided that shooting would not be wise, so he reholstered the revolver, grabbed Muscarello, and both ran back to the patrol car. Bertrand radioed another Exeter policeman, David Hunt, for assistance, and while the two waited in the car for Hunt to arrive they continued to observe the object. According to UFO historian Jerome Clark, Bertrand and Muscarello \\"observed the object as it hovered 100 feet away and at 100 feet altitude. It rocked back and forth. The pulsating red lights flashed in rapid sequence, first from right to left, then left to right, each cycle consuming no more than two seconds; the [local] animals continued to act agitated.\\"Clark 1998, p. 184. The object was still there when Hunt arrived, and he also watched it. The object finally rose over the trees and disappeared. Hunt soon heard the engines of a B-47 bomber as it flew overhead, and he later told journalist John G. Fuller that \\"You could tell the difference\\" between the UFO and the bomber, \\"there was no comparison.\\"Fuller 1997 All three men drove back to the Exeter police station and immediately filed separate reports on what they had seen. Bertrand then drove Muscarello home and told his mother about the incident. Other Exeter sightings The sightings by Muscarello and the two policemen received national publicity. John G. Fuller, a journalist and regular columnist for Saturday Review magazine, decided to travel to Exeter and investigate. Fuller interviewed a number of people in the Exeter area who also claimed to have witnessed strange lights and unusual objects. Among them were Ron Smith, a senior at Exeter High School, who told Fuller that about two or three weeks after Muscarello's sighting, he was travelling in a vehicle with his mother and aunt one evening at 11:30. According to Smith, he, his mother and aunt all saw an object with \\"a red light on top and the bottom was white and glowed. It appeared to be spinning. It passed over the car once and when it passed over and got in front, it stopped in midair. Then it went back over the car again.\\" Fuller also spoke to police officer Toland at Exeter's police station. Toland told Fuller of a number of calls he had received from Exeter-area residents regarding UFO sightings. A good example of the type of calls Toland had received came from Mrs. Ralph Lindsay. According to Toland \\"she called in here early, just before dawn. She said it was right out her window as she was calling. It was like a big orange ball, almost as big as the harvest Moon ... and it wasn't the Moon, either ... all the time she was talking to me, her kids were at the window watching it. Now why would people go to all this trouble ‚Äî people all over the area ‚Äî if they weren't seeing something real?\\" Air Force investigation and explanation When Exeter's police chief read the reports of Bertrand, Hunt, and Muscarello he called nearby Pease Air Force Base and reported a UFO sighting. The Air Force sent Major David Griffin and Lieutenant Alan Brandt to interview the three men. The Air Force officers asked all three men not to report their sighting to the press, but a reporter from the Manchester Union-Leader newspaper had already interviewed them. Major Griffin sent a report of the incident to the staff of Project Blue Book, the official Air Force research group assigned to investigate UFO reports. Griffin wrote that \\"At this time I have been unable to arrive at a probable cause of this sighting. The three observers seem to be stable, reliable persons, especially the two patrolmen. I viewed the area of the sighting and found nothing in the area that could be the probable cause. Pease AFB had five B-47 aircraft flying in the area but I do not believe that they had any connection with this sighting.\\"Clark 1998, p. 185. Before Project Blue Book could send this evaluation to the Pentagon, however, the Air Force had already issued an explanation of Muscarello and the two policemen's sighting to the press. The Pentagon informed reporters that the three men had seen \\"nothing more than stars and planets twinkling ... owing to a temperature inversion.\\" Project Blue Book then issued its own explanation, stating that \\"Operation Big Blast ... a SAC/NORAD training mission\\" had been active on the night of the sighting and that it could have accounted for the UFO. Project Blue Book's supervisor, USAF Major Hector Quintanilla, wrote policemen Bertrand and Hunt that \\"in addition to aircraft from this operation [Big Blast], there were also five B-47 aircraft flying in your area during this period ... since there were many aircraft in the area, at the time, and there were no reports of unidentified objects from personnel engaged in this operation, we might then assume that the objects [you] observed between midnight and two a.m. might be associated with this military air operation.\\" Quintanilla also added that \\"If, however, these aircraft were noted by either of you, this would tend to eliminate this air operation as a possible explanation for the objects observed.\\" Controversy and Air Force retraction Muscarello, Bertrand, and Hunt all strongly disagreed with the Air Force explanation. The two policemen sent a letter to Project Blue Book in which they stated, \\"As you can imagine, we have been the subject of considerable ridicule since the Pentagon released its 'final evaluation' of our sighting of September 3, 1965. In other words, both Patrolman Hunt and myself saw this object at close range, checked it out with each other, confirmed and reconfirmed that it was not any type of conventional aircraft ... and went to considerable trouble to confirm that the weather was clear, there was no wind, no chance of weather inversion, and that what we were seeing was in no way a military or civilian aircraft.\\"Clark 1998, p. 186. Bertrand also noted that their UFO sighting took place nearly an hour after Operation Big Blast was said to have ended, which eliminated the operation as a possible cause of the sighting. When Project Blue Book did not respond to their letter, on December 29, 1965 ‚Äî nearly four months after the sighting ‚Äî the two men sent another letter to Blue Book in which they wrote that the object they observed \\"was absolutely silent with no rush of air from jets or chopper blades whatsoever. And it did not have any wings or tail ... it lit up the entire field, and two nearby houses turned completely red.\\" In addition to Muscarello and the policemen, John G. Fuller also ridiculed the Air Force explanation in print. He wrote that he had observed an unusual object near Exeter himself, and that it was being chased by an Air Force jet fighter. Raymond Fowler, the New England investigator for the National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena (NICAP), also filed a detailed report on the Exeter sightings. In his view the Air Force explanation was also incorrect.Fowler 1997, p. 42. At one point an Air Force officer claimed that the UFOs people had been observing were merely lights from nearby Pease AFB. To prove it, he had the lights activated before a large crowd who were gathered some distance away. According to Fowler, \\"he ordered personnel at the base to turn the lights on. Everybody looked and waited ‚Äî and nothing happened. Frustrated, he yelled into the mike to turn on the lights. A voice replied that the lights were on. The very embarrassed officer slunk back into the seat of the staff car and drove off amongst the laughs and jeers of the crowd.\\"Fowler 1981, p. 43. In January 1966 Lieutenant Colonel John Spaulding, from the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force, finally replied to the policemen's two letters. Spaulding wrote that \\"based on additional information submitted to our UFO investigation officer, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, we have been unable to identify the object you observed on September 3, 1965.\\" Aftermath The Exeter UFO sightings ‚Äî and particularly the initial sightings involving Norman Muscarello and police officers Eugene Bertrand and David Hunt ‚Äî remain among the best-documented and best-publicized in UFO history. In 1966, Fuller published an account of his investigation into the case. Entitled Incident at Exeter, it made The New York Times Best Seller list.(Peebles, p. 90) Norman Muscarello died at age 55 following a brief illness in April, 2003; he insisted his entire life that what he had witnessed was real and not an ordinary object. Bertrand died in 1998, and Hunt in 2011. In 2010, the Exeter Kiwanis Club started the \\"Exeter UFO Festival\\" as a fundraiser to benefit children's charities in the Exeter area.  Skeptical Inquirer explanation  In 2011, Joe Nickell, a prominent skeptic, and James McGaha, Major, USAF retired, proposed a possible explanation for the incident in the Skeptical Inquirer. As a pilot, McGaha had been refueled in flight by KC-97 tanker aircraft like the ones stationed at Pease AFB near Exeter in 1965. In the article, he claimed to have recognized the flashing red light pattern reported by the witnesses Bertrand and Muscarello: one, two, three, four, five, four, three, two, one. According to Nickell and McGaha, before refueling, the underbelly of the KC-97 tankers flashed five very bright red lights in that same pattern. The refueling boom hung down at a 60 degree angle and would flutter in the air currents when not being controlled by the boom operator: hence \\"floating like a leaf\\" per witness Muscarello.

It is known informally as Moscow's Embassy Row, and is home to the finest mansions built in the 1890s and 1900s. Povarskaya Street also houses the Supreme Court of Russia and the Gnessin State Musical College. Most of Povarskaya Street lies in the Arbat District; its northern side near Kudrinskaya Square is administered by the Presnensky District. History Povarskaya Street follows the track of an ancient road from Moscow to Volokolamsk. In the 1570s Ivan Grozny allocated the street to oprichnina (private royal domain) and the street was taken over by his associates. In the 17th century, however, its upper-class population was diluted by lower classes. The street owes its name to cooks (povara) of the 17th century Muscovite court. Nearby lanes are also named after various court servants: bakers (Khlebny Lane), tablecloth weavers (Skatertny Lane), etc. When Peter I established his new capital city in Saint Petersburg, this court sloboda depopulated, and the street was re-settled by nobles again, housing families including Gagarin, Golitsyn, Suvorov and the court of Peter's sister, princess Natalya Alexeevna (1673‚Äì1716). The street has retained its upper- class, exclusive role since that time. It is unusually quiet for downtown Moscow - with the exception of music from the Gnesin Institute windows, there are no retail shops, no office blocks and no public transport. In the late 1890s, real estate developer Jacob Reck consolidated two blocks in the middle of Povarskaya and commissioned prestigious Moscow architects Lev Kekushev and Roman Klein to design exclusive single-family mansions. These buildings, occupied by foreign embassies, are a showcase of Moscow Art Nouveau style.

Storey played for Ardsley Welfare and Grimethorpe Athletic in non-League football while working as a miner, before joining Huddersfield Town in 1943. After leaving them he played for Wombwell Athletic before moving to York City in 1947. He played for York in the FA Cup semi-final in 1955 and left a year later after making 354 appearances to join hometown club Barnsley. He later had periods with Accrington Stanley and Bradford Park Avenue before returning to York as trainer-coach for three years. Career Born in Darfield, West Riding of Yorkshire, Storey worked at a W. H. Smith in Barnsley, West Riding of Yorkshire at the age of 14 before becoming a miner at Houghton Main Colliery. Meanwhile, he played non-League football for local colliery sides Ardsley Welfare and Grimethorpe Athletic before signing for Huddersfield Town in September 1943. He was released by the club soon after and returned to play non-League football for Wombwell Athletic, where his father worked as a trainer. He joined Third Division North team York City for a fee of ¬£100 in May 1947, combining mining with playing and training for the club. He was later rated as \\"perhaps the best bargain York City ever bought\\". He made his debut in a 2‚Äì2 home draw at Bootham Crescent with Wrexham on 27 May 1947 and finished the remainder of the 1946‚Äì47 season with three appearances. He missed one game for York during the 1947‚Äì48 season, making 42 appearances and scoring 12 goals in all competitions. An injury resulted in him missing the FA Cup semi-final against Newcastle United on 26 March 1955 and several league games, with many fans believing this cost the club promotion, although he was able to play in the 2‚Äì0 defeat to Newcastle in the semi-final replay on 30 March at Roker Park. He received a benefit match in 1955 and was granted a free transfer in 1956 after making 354 appearances and scoring 42 goals in all competitions for York, joining hometown club Barnsley in May to run their reserve team. He managed to play for Barnsley due to an injury to one of their first team players and he was able to \\"demonstrate that his old skills had not deserted him\\". He made 29 appearances and scored four goals in the league for Barnsley before joining Accrington Stanley in October 1957, where he \\"once more belied his age with some top class displays\\". He made 30 appearances and scored two goals for Accrington in the league and joined Bradford Park Avenue as player-coach of the reserves in July 1959. He made two league appearances for Park Avenue and following his retirement as a player he rejoined the York coaching staff as a trainer-coach. He left after three years in 1963 and worked for Richmond Sausages as a van driver for two years. He was then employed as a bus driver for the West Yorkshire Road Car Company and after York won the 1983‚Äì84 Fourth Division championship he drove the open top bus that paraded the team around York. He resided in Haxby, North Yorkshire until his death in York, North Yorkshire on 6 April 2010 at the age of 90. His death was marked a day later by a minute's applause before York's game at home to AFC Wimbledon, which the team won 5‚Äì0. Style of play Storey played as a left-sided inside forward and has been described as a \\"ball-player\\", a \\"little gem\\" and a \\"creative spark\\". He was held in \\"great esteem\\" by York fans due to his ball work and vision. Following his death, it was said that \\"it will be for his jinking skills and sweet left foot that he will always be remembered\\".

Its emblem features a farmer with a plow, a reference to the city's agricultural past.  History  Founded in 1892, Hayward High is one of the oldest high schools in the San Francisco Bay Area. The first true high school that opened in 1893 was called Union High School #3. It served students from Hayward, Castro Valley, San Lorenzo, Redwood, Palomares and Stonybrook. Initially, it was a one-story building with a basement. As late as the 1960s, students still rode their horses to school and tied them to hitching posts. As the number of students exceeded the campus' limit, the site was expanded from 10 to . The architecture for the new buildings included ionic columns, low-pitched roofs, and friezes of goods. This building, built in 1911, lasted until Hayward High moved to its current campus in 1962, to make way for the City Center Building.

Grant County Park, this site is situated in the Diablo Range foothills of the eastern Santa Clara Valley. The park is one of 28 owned by Santa Clara County and managed by the Santa Clara County Parks and Recreation Department. Joseph D. Grant, son of a wealthy San Francisco merchant, began buying what had been the Rancho Ca√±ada de Pala Mexican land grant. Grant used the property for grazing cattle, recreating, and hunting game. Joseph D. Grant died in 1942. Santa Clara County purchased approximately of the land in 1975, and created this public park. Grant Ranch Park is situated in the Diablo Range, near Mount Hamilton.

It depicts different families that have been affected by the violence in Israel between Israelis and Palestinians. In this film, Just Vision, a non-profit organization, follows these families for 16 months. It begins this journey by documenting the ongoing troubles between the Israelis and Palestinians. The team conducted 475 preliminary interviews and did two years of research before embarking on this 16-month journey. The crew traveled throughout Israel, from Tel Mond, Tulkarem, Hebron, and Haifa. These parents and loved ones have been attempting to end the violence by joining, or beginning their own peace organizations and awareness campaigns. Plot One mother that is introduced early on in the film is Robi Damelin. Damelin‚Äôs son David was a soldier in the Israeli army that had been shot by a sniper while working at a checkpoint. The soldiers had been sent to protect an Israeli settlement on Palestinian territory. After learning of her son's loss, Damelin joined the Bereaved Families Forum, where she was able to meet other Palestinian and Israeli families that had been through the same losses. There she worked closely with the families from different backgrounds and began to advocate peace between Palestinians and Israelis. She continues to work for an end to the conflict. The production team also follows Ali Abu Awwad to examine his stance on non- violence. After being shot in his lower body by an Israeli settler he was sent to Saudi Arabia for medical treatment. While healing in Saudi Arabia, Ali‚Äôs brother Yusef had been killed by an Israeli militant. After the news of his brother's death Ali Abu Awwad teamed up with the Bereaved Families Forum to work with Israelis and Palestinians who together campaigned for non-violence. Shlomo Zagman, who grew up in an Israeli settlement most of his life is another character in the documentary. Along with the settlers from his hometown, Shlomo, and other Israeli settlers, are extremists that believe that all Palestinians should be deported to the neighboring Arab countries. The movie illuminates this point as we see how Shlomo and his wife transform, despite the meandering resistance of his parents and hometown, to become founding members of the Realistic Religious Zionism group. Subsequently, Shlomo tries to encourage the people of his hometown, as well as other settlements, to withdraw from these Occupied Territories and convince them that the persistence of these settlements will be detrimental to Israel.

History Originally known as the Bay Area Women's Philharmonic, in 1998, the orchestra's repertoire consisted almost entirely of works by more than 150 women, including more than 130 premiere performances and more than 40 commissions. A partial list of TWP's repertoire, compiled by Women's Philharmonic Advocacy, includes 283 works. TWP's mission was \\"to change the face of what is played in every concert hall by incorporating works by women composers into the orchestral repertoire.\\" TWP's long list of accomplishments includes multiple awards for Adventurous Programming from ASCAP and the American Symphony Orchestra League. In 2008, Women's Philharmonic Advocacy was formed \\"in order to recognize the achievement of The Women's Philharmonic (1980-2004) over their 24 years of activity, to build on this work by advocating for the performance of women composers by orchestras and ensembles, to address the place of women composers (historic and contemporary) in today's repertoire of orchestras and ensembles in the US and internationally, and to present information that highlights the shortage of programming of works by women; the heritage of The Women's Philharmonic emphasizes that this should and can be corrected.\\" See 'Women‚Äôs Philharmonic Advocacy' (a non-profit organization founded in 2008 in order to build on the achievements of The Women's Philharmonic) Accessed 30 December 2016 The Philharmonic continues in existence as the Community Women's Orchestra, which was initially founded in 1985 by Nan Washburn as an adjunct to The Women's Philharmonic.

Originally from Roan Mountain, Tennessee, Smith served as a head coach for 22 seasons. Best known as the head coach at Auburn from 1978 to 1989, he also coached at East Tennessee State (1976‚Äì1978) and VCU (1989‚Äì1998). Smith won the 1985 SEC Tournament championship while at Auburn, and won both the CAA regular season and tournament titles in 1996 while at VCU. He made six NCAA Tournament appearances as a head coach, five at Auburn and one at VCU. Smith was inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame in 2007.  East Tennessee State  Sonny Smith was hired by East Tennessee State in 1976. He coached the Buccaneers for two seasons before leaving to become the head coach at Auburn. Smith finished with a record of 30‚Äì23 (.566) while at East Tennessee State.  Auburn  Sonny Smith was hired by Auburn in the summer of 1978 after the recently hired Paul Lambert died in a hotel fire. Smith took the Auburn job despite returning all of his starters from the year before and moving into a new arena at East Tennessee State. Smith guided Auburn to its first ever NCAA Tournament appearance in 1984, led by future Hall of Fame player Charles Barkley. The Tigers were upset in the First Round, however, by the 12th-seeded Richmond Spiders. Smith was named SEC Coach of the Year following the 1984 season. The 1985 regular season was considered a letdown, with the Tigers going 8‚Äì10 in conference play. Before the SEC Tournament, Smith announced his plan to retire at the end of the season. However, Smith and tournament MVP Chuck Person led Auburn to its first ever SEC Tournament championship, winning four games in four days for the first time in tournament history. He then coached that team to the Sweet Sixteen of the 1985 NCAA Tournament. Following this success, and despite receiving an offer from his former school, East Tennessee State, Smith decided to remain at Auburn. Smith would go on to lead the Tigers to three more NCAA Tournament appearances, making it as far as the Elite Eight in 1986. This streak of five straight NCAA Tournament appearances is the longest in Auburn history. Smith was again named SEC Coach of the Year following the 1988 season. Following a losing season in 1989, Smith left Auburn to become the head coach at VCU, citing his doubts that he could return Auburn to the success of the previous five seasons. His record at Auburn was 173‚Äì154 (.529). To date, he is the only coach in Auburn men's basketball history to have three consecutive 20-win seasons.  VCU  Though he did not achieve the level of success that he had while at Auburn, Sonny Smith's tenure at VCU was not without its bright spots. In his fourth season he led the Rams to 20 wins and an invitation to the 1993 NIT. Smith's best season at VCU was his seventh, the 1995‚Äì96 season. VCU had just left the struggling Metro Conference to become a member of the Colonial Athletic Association, and Smith led them to success in the new conference immediately. The Rams won both the CAA regular season and tournament championships, earning Smith's only NCAA Tournament bid at VCU. Smith was named CAA Coach of the Year at the end of the season. Smith retired at the end of the 1997‚Äì98 season, with his longtime assistant coach Mack McCarthy taking over as head coach at VCU. Smith finished at VCU with a record of 136‚Äì127 (.517), and an overall head coaching record of 339‚Äì304 (.527).  Broadcasting career  After retiring from coaching, Smith joined his friend and former Alabama coach Wimp Sanderson on a sports talk radio show \\"The Sonny and Wimp Show\\" on WJOX-AM in Birmingham, Alabama. The show ran for more than six years before it was canceled in 2006. From 2003 to 2014, Smith provided the color commentary for the Atlantic Sun Game of the Week on CSS. Smith currently works alongside Andy Burcham as the color commentator for Auburn men's basketball games on the Auburn Sports Network radio broadcast.

Career Mabe, based in Louisville, Kentucky, achieved notability with his prank responses to telemarketing calls. Upon receiving an unsolicited call, Mabe would engage telemarketers in an unexpected and often uncomfortable conversation while recording the incident. One of his best known pranks of this genre involved convincing a telemarketer that he had inadvertently called the scene of a homicide. He has been featured on Drew & Mike in the Morning on WRIF numerous times and has released three comedy albums of his calls through Virgin Records Nashville. Mabe now operates a YouTube channel entitled \\"MabeInAmerica\\" onto which he uploads his pranks. His exploits now primarily focus on the candid camera style of pranking, although telemarketing related and other prank calls are still included on occasion. In 2008, Mabe was the Executive Producer, writer, and talent for the CMT (Country Music Television) comedy series, Mabe In America. Six episodes have been produced, including two \\"best of\\" shows that showcase his most popular features. He appeared in the second episode of CMT Comedy Stage. Mabe also performs as a standup comedian. The current center of focus of his acts generally revolves around issues that Americans tend to find annoying including email spam, bad customer service, and high gas prices. In December 2013, Mabe created a prank video, intended to discourage driving under the influence, in which he and several accomplices convinced a mutual friend with a history of multiple DUIs that he had just awoken from a 10-year coma resulting from a drunk driving accident. It became a viral video, earning over 28 million views on YouTube by October 2017. Hotel incident Tom Mabe is also known for attending an event at which telemarketers gathered in Washington D.C. with the hopes of discouraging new laws that would prevent telemarketing. Mabe booked a room in the same hotel in which they were staying and called the telemarketers in their rooms at 3 a.m. to pretend to sell them sleeping pills.

Large area multispectral obscurant smoke screening is used to cover the tracks of troops and artillery. Construction The M58 system is made up of an M56 smoke generation unit built onto an M113 type chassis. The M113 chassis was designed as a fully tracked armoured personnel carrier, light enough to be transported via airplane, yet still moderately armored. The vehicle can carry a payload of cargo, troops, and a crew of three. With its mechanical foundation based on an upgraded diesel engine, four speed hydrostatic transmission, and large external fuel tanks it is capable of providing side-by-side support with even the most agile Abrams and Bradley AFVs. Smoke generation Without replenishment of smoke producing agents, the M58 can produce ninety minutes of thick, visually impairing smoke, or thirty minutes of infra-red obscuring haze. This screen effectively blocks infrared range finding as well as conventional night vision technologies. A future smoke capability, based on millimeter wave technology, could also be used to block higher-frequency radar systems. The system generates smoke by vaporizing medium viscosity oil in a specially designed exhaust manifold. The hot vapors form a thick, white cloud. Other components may be added to the oil to form different types of cloaking hazes. Infrared smoke has special components added so that infrared light is refracted along with the full visual spectrum. Purpose of a smoke platoon A chemical smoke platoon is designed to mask the maneuvers of ground forces during reconnaissance, recovery, and insertion missions. The designated primary mission of the M58 Wolf is provide troop cover, counter electronic sensors, munitions guidance systems, and standard night vision. All forms of pinpointing things within the thick smoke cloud are effectively blocked. The best the enemy can do in this situation is to blanket the smoky area with rounds, which would ultimately lead to few kills and lots of wasted ammunition. By blinding the enemy, countermeasures, such as laser guided missiles, are warded off; the obscured troops are safer and have the element of surprise on their side. A typical platoon of seven M58 vehicles acts as cover support on tactical missions. Two groups of three M58 Wolves create a perimeter, circling troops and vehicles which are to be hidden. The seventh vehicle leads the platoon, coordinating maneuvers that provide the thickest and largest area of cover.

With 34 stands, it was the largest bus station in Wales. It was located adjacent to Cardiff Central railway station forming a major interchange. Construction of a new bus station on the site of the former NCP multi-storey car park in Wood Street adjacent to the old bus station is underway with an expected date of completion in Spring 2023. The station used to handle the vast majority of bus and coach services that run in and through the city. Notable exceptions were Megabus services (which called at Kingsway and Cardiff University), Stagecoach South Wales route 122 (which called at Greyfriars Road)http://www.stagecoachbus.com/timetables/122Oct08[2].pdf and EST route 89 (which used Customhouse Street). History The bus station in 1980 The terminal building from Wood Street in 2007 The site of Cardiff's bus station had previously been an area of housing and shops known as Temperance Town. However, demolition of Temperance Town commenced in 1937 after the Great Western Railway persuaded the Cardiff Corporation to improve the view from their new railway station.Abandoned Communities website Abandoned Communities ..... Temperance Town (viewed 11 October 2011) The Central bus station opened in 1954. Demolition of the bus station began in 2008 with the terminus building being demolished. Before work began, there were eight concourses lettered A-F and W with each concourse having numbered stands. Redevelopment Demolition of the terminal building in 2008 Redevelopment of the bus station began in 2008. Demolition of the old terminal buildings (between stand A and Wood Street stands) started on 11 January 2008, with buses instead picking up at Castle Street and Westgate Street. On 6 May 2008, Stand A at the bus station closed for demolition of the terminal buildings. As of 4 January 2009, some services reverted to using the bus station, whilst others remained split between the alternative terminal points. A multimillion- pound modernisation of Cardiff central bus station was announced in December 2010, with three options for public consultation. In December 2011 the council announced that the existing bus station would close in early 2013 and the new bus station would be built on the site of the neighbouring Wood Street Car Park. The new bus station would open in mid-2014, and provide 19 bays and have direct access to Westgate Street and St Mary Street via Saunders Road. A further announcement was made in January 2012, that negotiations were underway to sell off the existing bus station land to two major companies, who would build a 12-storey headquarters on the site. Part of the proceeds from the sale would be put towards redesign and redevelopment of Central Square, which would be renamed Capital Square. These plans were put in doubt after the May 2012 council election. Proposed new Cardiff Central bus station The new Cardiff bus station and associated buildings under construction (August 2020) In October 2014 a new masterplan was revealed for the area, produced by architects Foster + Partners. BBC Cymru Wales earmarked the bus station as the site for its new headquarters. Proposals for a replacement bus station were to be put to the Cardiff Council later in 2014. In June 2015 Foster + Partners were chosen as the preferred architects and images were revealed of the new bus station, which would be completed by mid-2018. The final part of the bus station closed on 1 August 2015.\\"Work begins on new Cardiff bus station\\" Coach & Bus Week issue 1199 28 July 2015 page 9 Construction of the new Cardiff Central bus station is now due to begin early in 2018, after an agreement was made between Rightacres, the developer of the site, and the Welsh Government. The plans, which were approved by Cardiff Council's cabinet on 20 December 2017, will include both offices and residential apartments built along with the bus station. The plans still need planning approval for some elements of the plan. The new bus station was described as due to open in 2020. In July 2019 Cardiff Council announced they had signed contracts with developer Rightacres and funder Legal and General to re-open the bus station on its new site. The project is now expected to be completed in Spring 2023. Facilities Eating and drinking facilities such as a Burger King, as well as other shops and bus company offices, faced the stands on Central Square. Taxi ranks were located on both sides of the station. Toilets and a newsagent were located at stand A which was demolished in mid-2008 as part of the redevelopment of the station. However, these services are available in the adjacent Cardiff Central railway station.

Impassable falls are present on upper Arroyo Hondo, but the rainbow trout in Smith and Isabel creeks are assumed to be native, as California roach (Hesperoleucus symmetricus) and Sacramento sucker (Catostomus occidentalis occidentalis) are also present above and below the falls. Speckled dace (Rhinichthys osculus) were collected by John Otterbein Snyder in 1905 in Arroyo Hondo and Isabel creeks, but not by Scoppettone and Smith in 1978, having disappeared from most of their former sites in the central coast.

Founded as a mail order business by Anne Kennedy in 1969 and sold in 1988, Clothkits at one stage employed 400 workers and had 7 shops. The name continued to be used for a short time after the takeover of the company by Freemans, a larger mail order catalogue business, and was discontinued in 1991. Clothkits specialized in selling pre-printed kit clothing for children and adults. The kit would comprise a pattern printed onto the fabric so that it could be cut out and assembled without needing to pin a paper pattern. The kits were also notable for containing all the materials needed to complete the garment. The spare fabric around the pieces of the main pattern would often feature a doll sized pattern for the same garment. As well as the printed kits, they sold ready-made clothing and coordinating knitted items such as jumpers and tights. After a period of hibernation, the Clothkits brand was bought in 2007 by artist Kay Mawer and the company relaunched in early 2008. Clothkits continue to produce kit clothing, also available pre-assembled, inspired by the original concept.

Before 1945 the name Isergebirgsbahn was used for the railway line Friedeberg am Queis (Mirsk) - Bad Flinsberg (≈öwierad√≥w-Zdr√≥j) that used to connect Prussia with the Austro-Hungarian Empire via the New World Pass.Czech: Novosvƒõtsk√Ω pr≈Øsmyk, German: ' The line is currently operated by PKP.  History  The name comes from Jizera Mountains. The first section at the foothills of the Giant Mountains (Riesengebirge/Karkonosze/Krkono≈°e) was completed in 1891. The mountain section took several more years to finish. The railway station Jakobsthal (Jakuszyce) close to the New World Pass became the highest railway station in Prussia. The terminal station was Polaun/Gr√ºnthal (Ko≈ôenov). The complete track was opened in 1902, together with the Cog railway Tannwald-Gr√ºnthal. The line was electrified in 1923. Deserted track between Szklarska Porƒôba and Harrachov In April 1945 most of the locomotives were evacuated. Some were captured in the border station Polaun/Gr√ºnthal by the advancing Red Army. After the war, the electric equipment was dismantled and together with the remaining locomotives transported to the Soviet Union as reparation. Silesia was transferred to Poland, and cross-border traffic was abolished. Following an exchange of border territories between Czechoslovakia and Poland, the Bohemian part was extended to Harrachov, and that became the new terminal station. Polish State Railways (PKP) operated passenger trains as far as Szklarska Porƒôba Huta (Josephinenh√ºtte) and freight trains as far as Jakuszyce. The track as far as Szklarska Porƒôba G√≥rna was electrified again in 1987. Except for a one-day celebration on the 100th anniversary in 2002, cross border traffic was never restored.

This project has been recommended to be awarded a subsidy. The reconstruction work started in June 2009 on the Polish side, in October 2009 also on the Czech side. The regular public rail transport across the border started on August 28, 2010. Until December 12, 2015, the trains were operated both by a Polish company Przewozy Regionalne and a Czech company Viamont A.S.

She studied Sanskrit and Buddhist literature and spent time in the jungles of Madhya Pradesh to study tribal life. She later returned to Mumbai as a researcher and wrote books in Marathi. She is arguably the foremost female writer in Marathi. Shes one amongst the prominent writers who opposed The Emergency (India). She also abstained from accepting such institutional and civilian honours as the Padma Shree and the Jnanapeeth. Early years Durga Bhagwat was born in 1910 in a Karhade Brahmin family settled in the then princely state of Baroda. The veteran Sanskrit scholar and social activist Rajaram Shastri Bhagwat was the brother of her grandmother. Her sister Kamala Sohonie went on to become the first woman scientist of India. Her father was a scientist who discovered the procedure of making ghee from oil. Durgabai was attracted to Gandhism and took part in Indian freedom movement for a very short time. When she realised that she cannot do it for a longer time she left that and completed her studies from St. Xavier's College. But she continued to wear Khadi in that period. Her paternal aunt, Seetabai Bhagwat, had a great influence on Durgabai. Durgabai went to Madhya Pradesh for studying tribal culture where she had an idiosyncratic reaction to yam (Elephant foot) for which she was bed-ridden for six years. She could not complete her doctorate course. Later years Durga Bhagwat was elected President of the 51st Marathi Sahitya Sammelan, held in Karad, in 1975. She was the second woman President of the Sammelan, after Kusumavati Deshpande since its inception in 1878. Durgabai publicly opposed the state of Emergency imposed by Indira Gandhi and the arrest of Jaiprakash Narayan and was jailed by the government. After the emergency was lifted, she campaigned against the ruling Congress Party in the 1977 general election, and remained opposed to it for the rest of her life. After the Emergency, she was offered an influential government seat by the then ruling Janata Party which she declined. She decided not to accept any state-sponsored honours and declined the Jnyan Peeth Award. Before chairing the Marathi Sahitya Sammelan, she was elected chairperson of the Tamasgir Meet and considered it a great honour. Durga Bhagwat never married. Her idols throughout her life had been Vyasa, Gautama Buddha, Adi Shankaracharya, American philosopher Henry David Thoreau, and Indian writer Shridhar Venkatesh Ketkar. Her contribution Durga Bhagwat's notable works include a biography of Rajaram Shastri Bhagwat, Pais, a collection of articles based around religions, their literature and practises and Vyas Parva, a book about her study of Mahabharat. She studied religious literature, particularly Buddhist, works of Marathi saints from Dnyaneshwar to Tukaram, major Sanskrit works of Vyas and Adi Shankaracharya. Her book RRitu-chakra, detailing the nature (particularly trees and flowers) in each Indian month, is perhaps her most famous work. During her prolonged recuperation after being food poisoned in Madhya Pradesh, she observed the changes in the nature over the 12-month cycle and spurred her to write articles on each season. Bhagwat wrote many articles on cooking and crafts and was known as the 'Marathi Saraswatachi Sarswati'.

Early life and education Born in Vienna to an aristocratic Catholic family, he was the son of Viktor Urbantschitsch, a physician and one of the founders of modern ENT medicine. His uncle, Carl Fr√∂schl, was a portrait painter. Rudolf von Urban studied at the Vienna Theresianum, graduating in 1898. URBANTSCHITSCH (URBAN), RUDOLF VON (1879-1964); Encyclopedia; Career Early in his career, he worked as assistant to the internist Carl von Noorden. With Noorden's support he opened the prestigious Wiener Cottage Sanatorium as a clinic for the aristocracy in 1908. In January 1908 he presented a paper, \\"Meine Entwicklungsjahre bis zur Ehe\\" (From my puberty to my marriage), to a group of Viennese psychoanalysts to whom he had been introduced by the physician Fritz Wittels. He became a member of a group called the Wednesday psychology society, and remained a member of it until 1914. With Noorden's support and under the patronage of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, he opened the prestigious Wiener Cottage Sanatorium in 1908, serving as its director. The sanatorium became one of the most prestigious clinics in Europe, treating patients from the highest level of Viennese society. Among the doctors who sent their patients to the clinic was Sigmund Freud. In 1920, Urbantschitsch lost his position as director of the sanatorium, which was sold in 1922. On Freud's recommendation, he then began to train as an analyst, first with Paul Federn and then with S√°ndor Ferenczi in Budapest. Because he was a Catholic, an aristocrat, and a monarchist, Urbantschitsch was an outlier in the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society. In the ensuing years he lectured widely in Austria and abroad, giving a series of lectures on sexology at the University of Athens in 1933. His popularization of the ideas of psychoanalysis subjected him to criticism by his some of his Viennese colleagues, who also objected to his love affairs, two of which resulted in suicide. Consequently the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society declined to renew his membership, and in 1924 even refused to welcome him as a guest. In response to the looming threat of Nazism, he fled Austria in late 1936, settling first in Los Angeles, where he worked as a psychotherapist, and moving the next year to San Francisco and to Carmel in 1941. Part of the reason for the brevity of his sojourn in Los Angeles was the opposition of psychoanalysts there to his theories and his therapeutic approaches. In 1938 he spoke at a neuropsychiatric conference at the University of California in San Francisco, and later spoke at a medical meeting at Stanford. In 1944 Urbantschitsch was accused of practicing medicine illegally. Sex Perfection - Von Urban; Reuniting; =Sex Perfection and Marital Happiness= His book Sex Perfection and Marital Happiness was published by Dial Press in 1949. In the book, which opens with chapters on ‚ÄúSex Development of Children,‚Äù ‚ÄúTalking to Children about Sex,‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Problem of Masturbation,‚Äù and goes on to discuss his ‚ÄúSix Rules of Sex Intercourse,‚Äù birth control, impotence, frigidity, and other subjects, von Urban argues that the avoidance of orgasm during sexual organism can result in a flow of energy that prolongs and enhances sexual intercourse. In his ‚Äúsix rules‚Äù he recommends extended foreplay, a certain sexual position, full concentration, and complete relaxation, states that the ideal sex act should take at least 27 minutes, and counsels a five-day break between sexual encounters.

Each title is accompanied by a brief synopsis and critique briefly explaining why the book was chosen. Some entries have illustrations. This book is part of a series from Quintessence Editions Ltd.  The list  The list contains 1001 titles and is made up of novels, short stories, and short story collections. There is also one pamphlet (A Modest Proposal), one book of collected text (Adjunct: An Undigest), and one graphic novel (Watchmen). The most featured authors on the list are J. M. Coetzee and Charles Dickens with ten titles each. The 2010 revised and updated edition of the book is less Anglocentric and lists only four titles from Dickens and five from Coetzee, who has the most of any writer on the list. It also includes a collection of essays by Albert Camus, The Rebel. There was a major revision of 280 odd titles in 2008. The clear shift within the list has been the removal of ~300 works almost entirely by English language authors who have more than one title on the original list in favour of lesser known works, often by non-English language writers.

It is a set of double-6 dominoes with a 120-degree curve. The main difference from dominoes is the curved shape of the pieces, which introduces a new level of strategy to the game. There is also a version of the game for younger players with pictures instead of numbers and symbols on the bendomino tiles.  Gameplay  Bendomino is played in rounds. At the beginning of each round, the 28 Bendominoes are placed face down and mixed. Players draw their hand, the remaining pieces represent the stock. (With 2 players each player takes 7 Bendominoes, with 3 players: each player takes 6 Bendominoes, with 4 players: each player takes 5 Bendominoes.) The player with the highest Bendomino double starts the game by placing the piece on the center of the table. If no double was drawn, the highest Bendomino number should be played. (Example: 6/5) Taking turns in a clockwise direction, each player tries to match a Bendomino by number to either end of the Bendomino chain. To be accepted the new piece needs to match but also has to fit. Each Bendomino must be connected evenly with other pieces to ensure accuracy of the game. If players do not have a Bendomino that can be played, they must draw one piece from the stock. If the piece they draw can be played, they can immediately play it. Players can decide to draw a Bendomino and pass their turn even if they have playable pieces. Either end of the Bendomino game can be blocked when: no matching numbers are available, no matching pieces can fit, one end of the game is trapped in a dead end, both ends connect (very rare). If both ends of the Bendomino chain are blocked, each player draws a Bendomino until the stock is empty. A round ends when: A player has no Bendominoes left to play or the stock is empty and players cannot play any pieces. A player wins a round when: They play all their pieces or no pieces can be played by any player and you have the lowest point total. (The point total is the total number of dots on your remaining Bendominoes). The winner of a round scores the dot points from all opponents‚Äô remaining Bendominoes. The first player to score 100 points wins the game. = Variations = Several variations exist. In Wild Draw: For a more aggressive game, when players do not have a playable piece they must continue to draw until they get a playable piece or until the stock is empty. In No Draw: When players do not have a matching piece, they pass their turn instead of drawing. No Draw with 2 Teams of 2 players: each player draws 7 pieces at the start of the game, so there is no stock. Players take turns and only use their individual pieces. A team wins a round when one team member is declared the winner (see basic rules). The winning team scores the dot points from the remaining Bendominoes of the losing team.

It is situated between Baralacha La to the south and Lachulung La to the north, at an altitude of . Row of Tents at Sarchu The journey along the Manali-Leh highway normally takes two days, so travellers and tourists stop overnight here. An Indian army camp is sited nearby on the banks of the Tsarap Chu river. The highway and the camp are closed during the winter, when snow blocks the high passes along the road.Surprise snowfall at Sarchu Prayer flag outside of campside at Sarchu Tented accommodation at Sarchu  Main Attraction  Earlier know for its significance as the old Silk Route. It is as yet a top most loved destination for traders of Himalayas, itinerant clans and adventure seekers. Sarchu is of great importance mainly due to its location on the Leh-Manali highway. It also resembles Ladakh with its barren splendor. This place can be visited between June and September when the snow melts and the Leh-Manali highway is open for traffic. Sarchu is an important route for Ladakh Manali Highway. In other words life line for both states. Sarchu is the starting point for Zanskar Trek of Ladakh. The trek is very testing as it includes exploring through remote crevasses, crossing high passes and waterways. There are dazzling perspectives on the snow-loaded pinnacles at every step of the way of on this trek. Other than seeing the normal magnificence along the path, the trek has some hair- raising challenges like river crossing, steep edges, and navigating through restricted canyons. The desolate excellence of Sarchu allures the travellers who are searching for comfort in the midst of mountains.  Boundary dispute  The boundary at Sarchu was disputed between the states of Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir. There is a pillar on the boundary, and records state that the boundary follows a drainage divide, but operators of seasonal tent accommodations cross the border to get favorable sites. In 2019, after this part of Jammu and Kashmir was reorganized into the union territory of Ladakh, there was renewed interest in having the Survey of India mark the border.  Weather  During winters, the temperature may drop to -20¬∞C or less depending upon the month while in summers the temperate varies from 5¬∞C to 15¬∞C during the day and may fall below 0¬∞C at night. Staying in Sarchu has its own set of difficulties. AMS or Acute mountain sickness is among the fundamental difficulties. Travelers normally stop at Keylong or Jispa before heading out to Sarchu to acclimatize themselves. The chances of mountain sickness are uneven and depend on person to person and their present health conditions, although the possibility of getting hit by AMS cannot be ruled out completely. Travelers are usually advised to drink adequate amount of water to keep their body hydrated at all times. Consumption of liquor may prove fatal if you are already experiencing symptoms of acute mountain sickness. High calorie diet with garlic is a common practice adopted by the locals and nomads of Sarchu to avoid any kind of mountain sickness.

He was often referred to as the \\"Dean of Lebanese Journalism\\". Early life Born in Beirut on 5 January 1926 to a Greek Orthodox Christian family, Ghassan Tueni was the son of Gebran Tueni, the founder and publisher of the daily newspaper An Nahar. His hometown was Beit Mary. Ghassan Tueni joined the Syrian Social Nationalist Party founded by Antoun Saadeh in the early 1940s. According to Tueni, it was Yusuf al-Khal who recruited him to join the party. During his time at the American University of Beirut, Tueni was the general executive head of student affairs within the SSNP and later rose to the position as assistant cultural dean of the party. In 1947, he met Antoun Saadeh for the very first time in Dhour El Choueir and was blown away by Saadeh's striking charisma. While studying for his master's degree in the United States, Antoun Saadeh at that time was in forced exile and the two exchanged letters between 1946 and 1947. Later that year, Tueni left the SSNP after the dismissal of Yusuf al-Khal, Fayez Sayegh and others from the party. Tueni found himself making a swift comeback to the SSNP after its party leader was summoned and executed in a trial that took less than twenty four hours by the Lebanese authorities in 1949. Saadeh's execution was dubbed by many as the worst kangaroo court trial in Lebanese legal history. The execution prompted Tueni to write a front-page column in the Nahar newspaper where he hailed Saadeh as a national hero forsaking his life for the national cause and condemning the execution. The article created a widespread political storm that caused much worry among the establishment and was soon sent to prison. In 1952, Tueni was appointed by the SSNP leadership to represent the party in the Popular Socialist Front led by Kamal Jumblatt that forced the resignation of Lebanese president Bechara El Khoury Education Ghassan Tueni (left) with the director Philippe Aractingi/ Tueni studied at the International College (IC) and then, at the American University of Beirut under Charles Malik who was influential in the development of his thoughts. He received a bachelor of arts degree in philosophy from AUB in 1945. He then went to the United States to study at Harvard University where he received his master's degree in government. He had to abruptly interrupt his PhD studies at Harvard and return to Lebanon to take over the reins of the journal when his father died. Career After the sudden death of his father Gebran Tueni, Ghassan, just 22 at the time, returned to Lebanon to continue publishing An Nahar. He became editor-in-chief and publisher of the paper from 1947 to 1999, and from 2003 until his death. He was imprisoned in the 1940s for his objections to censorship. Committed to his father's work, Ghassan developed a new team of journalists, modernising the editorial content and its production. An Nahar was at the time Lebanon's foremost daily and the Arab world's most credible and authoritative newspaper. He became a member of parliament in 1951, at age 25. Until 1977, he served in different governmental positions, including house speaker, deputy prime minister and minister of the social affairs and labor, industry, information, energy and education. He also served as Lebanon's permanent representative to the United Nations (UN) from September 1977 to September 1982, at the peak of the civil war. During his tenure at the UN, he famously addressed the Security Council on 17 March 1978 with the emotional plea: \\"Let my people live!\\". Soon, the UNSC adopted Resolution 425, calling for Israel to immediately withdraw its forces from Lebanon. During the Lebanese Civil War, he was against Bachir Gemayel and confessed lobbying in Washington, D.C. against his presidential election. Ghassan Tueni described the 1989 Taif Agreement as the peace of the others. After his son Gebran Tueni's assassination, Ghassan Tueni became the candidate for his son's seat in parliament and won the election. In June 2005, he published an article in An Nahar in which he praised Abdul Halim Khaddam's, former vice president of Syria, resignation from the Baath Party. In 2008, following clashes between pro- and anti-Syrian factions in Lebanon, he, along with other PMs, signed the Doha Agreement that ceased Lebanon's worst fighting since the civil war. Tueni's tenure at the parliament lasted until 2009 and his granddaughter Nayla Tueni won the same seat from Beirut. Personal life Tueni married Nadia Hamadeh in 1954 who died in 1983 after battling cancer for several years. He was predeceased by all three of his children. His son, the MP and journalist, Gebran Tueni was assassinated in 2005. At his son's funeral, he stood at the altar and pleaded, ‚ÄúLet us bury hatred and revenge along with Gebran.‚Äù His only daughter, Nayla, died at age 7 from cancer. Makram, his youngest son, was killed in a car crash in Paris in 1987 at age 21. A granddaughter, Nayla, is a journalist and a member of the Lebanese Parliament, like her late father, late Gebran Tueni. =Work= Ghassan Tueni's writings are extensive. In 1985, his book Une Guerre Pour les Autres (A War of Others) was published. He published another book, Enterrer La Haine Et La Vengeance (Let us bury hate and revenge), in 2009, which he dedicated to his late son Gebran. =Awards= *50px Grand Officier, National Order of the Cedar from Lebanon in 1984. In addition, Tueni was awarded an honorary degree from the American University of Beirut in June 2005. In December 2009, Tueni was given the Lebanese Order of Merit for his achievements in politics. In 2009, he was also the recipient of the Life Time Achievement Award of the Arab Thought Foundation. Moreover, in 2011, Tueni was awarded an honorary degree from the American University of Science and Technology. Death Ghassan Tueni died on 8 June 2012 after a long illness at age 86; he spent the last month of his life at American University Hospital in Beirut. He was survived by his second wife, Shadia al Khazen and four granddaughters. His funeral was held in Beirut on 9 June 2012. The Order of the Cedar was placed on his coffin.

He served as the head coach at McMurry University (1960‚Äì1965), Angelo State University (1969‚Äì1971), and Baylor University (1972‚Äì1992), compiling a career college football record of 170‚Äì151‚Äì8. In his 21 seasons as head coach of the Baylor Bears football team, Teaff's teams won two Southwest Conference titles and appeared in eight bowl games. His 128 wins are the most of any coach in the history of the program. Teaff was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 2001. Early career Grant Teaff played football at Snyder High School in Snyder, Texas. He continued playing at the college level for San Angelo Junior College (now Angelo State University) and then for McMurry University in Abilene, Texas. When McMurry head coach Wilford Moore was hired to coach for Lubbock High School in 1956, Teaff became his assistant. He then moved on to be an assistant at McMurry University from 1957 to 1959. Teaff began his head coaching career at McMurry in 1960, serving there until 1965. Among his players were future Pittsburgh Steelers split end Dick Compton and future San Diego Chargers offensive lineman Ernie Park. After a stint as an assistant coach to J. T. King at Texas Tech, Teaff became the head coach at Angelo State University from 1969 to 1971. Baylor In 1972, Grant Teaff was hired by Baylor University. Baylor originally hired Rudy Feldman from the University of New Mexico, but Feldman quit after one day, leaving the job to Teaff. The Baylor football team had been 7‚Äì43‚Äì1 in the five seasons preceding Teaff's arrival. Coach Teaff quickly built Baylor into a competitive team and in 1974, Baylor won eight games and captured the Southwest Conference title for the first time since 1924. In the process they defeated the Texas Longhorns, 34‚Äì24, after rallying from a 24‚Äì7 halftime deficit. It was Baylor's first victory over Texas in 17 years. The 1974 season and the win over Texas are commonly referred to as the \\"Miracle on the Brazos,\\" named after the Brazos River near the Baylor campus. In 1978, Coach Teaff led his team to another unforgettable win. His 2-8 Baylor Bears were set to play #9 ranked Texas. Many of the Bears were injured and they were expected to lose. To compensate for the loss of healthy players, Teaff introduced what is now known as the Wildcat formation. To motivate his team, Coach Teaff told them a story of two fishing eskimos. One was an excellent fisherman, reeling in one catch after another, while the other couldn't land a single fish. The frustrated eskimo asked his companion for the secret to successful fishing. His friend replied by pulling a worm out of his mouth, saying \\"you've got to keep the worms warm!\\" With this story, the coach let his team know that winning may cause momentary discomfort, but if they were able to put that aside for 60 minutes, the end result would be worth it. Coach Teaff told his team \\"this game is yours‚Äù, pulling a worm out of his mouth. The Bears went on to win the game 38-14, finishing the season 3-8. Teaff remained Baylor‚Äôs Head Football Coach until 1992, compiling a winning record and winning the Southwest Conference title for the last time in 1980. His teams won the 1979 Peach Bowl, the 1985 Liberty Bowl, the 1986 Bluebonnet Bowl, and the 1992 John Hancock Bowl, his final game as coach. His teams also earned invitations to the 1975 and 1981 Cotton Bowl Classic, the 1983 Astro-Bluebonnet Bowl, and the 1991 Copper Bowl. His Baylor teams were notable for success against the University of Texas, finishing with a 10‚Äì11 record against the Longhorns. By comparison, in the 15 seasons preceding Teaff's arrival and the 15 years following Teaff's departure, Baylor had a 1‚Äì29 record against Texas. Later life and family After retiring from coaching, Teaff became executive director of the American Football Coaches Association in February 1994, which is an organization headquartered in Waco, Texas. The AFCA represents coaches across the United States and is often consulted by the NCAA and the media regarding rule changes and developments that take place in college football. Teaff's wife, the former Jane Donnell Philips, is a member of the Baylor University Board of Regents. He and his wife have three daughters.

It is the second Picross game to be released by Nintendo in Europe and North America after Mario's Picross suffered a commercial failure in regions outside Japan, where many Picross games have been released for several Nintendo consoles. Like other Picross games, it presents the player with a series of nonogram logic puzzles to solve. It was first released in Japan, and was later released in North America, Europe and Australia. Gameplay The player deciphering the numbers to create the pattern required Gameplay follows traditional Picross rules, where players use logic to mark each square as full or empty, eventually revealing an unknown picture. Additional modes allow players to create their own puzzles and send them to friends, download classic puzzles and compete in speed competitions with friends or random rivals via the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, download classic Picross puzzles from previous titles and complete up to five timed daily challenges. In all modes except Daily and Online Challenge, the player is given the opportunity to receive a \\"hint\\" which reveals one randomly selected row and column, which does not impact the player's time. Also, three types of background music can be selected (except for Classic puzzles and the unlockable level 11 \\"extra\\" puzzles), or the music can be turned off. =Game modes= In Normal mode, the player is informed if they mark a square that should be unmarked. The first mistake incurs a time penalty of two minutes, the second mistake four minutes, and each following mistake eight minutes. Initially, the player can choose from an \\"easy mode\\" of 5√ó5 and 10√ó10 puzzles, and Levels 1‚Äì4 of 10√ó10 and 15√ó15 puzzles. As the player completes puzzles in the standard levels, levels 5‚Äì10 and an extra level can be unlocked, with puzzles up to 25√ó20 in size. To unlock the extra level, the puzzles in all ten levels must be completed with a time of less than one hour for each, including penalties. Each level contains 15 puzzles. After completing five puzzles in each level, one of three timed mini-games is unlocked: *Catch: 1√ó1 squares float around the grid. Tapping them all with the stylus clears this mode. *Sketch: The top screen displays a picture, which must be copied into the grid on the bottom screen. *Hit: Many squares appear and disappear quickly. Once a certain number are tapped, this mode is cleared. Minigames can be played multiple times to improve score, but do not have any bearing on unlocking new levels. They become more difficult in higher levels. The three types of music available in Normal mode are jazz, reggae and bossa nova. In Free mode, the player is not informed of mistakes, and the puzzles are generally more difficult to complete. To offset this, a Try it Out mode is available in which an overlay can be constructed to test various solutions. When finished with this mode, the player can delete it or apply the overlay. The Free mode minigames are the same as in Normal Mode but are generally more difficult. The three types of music available in Free Mode are rock, house and ambient. My Picross contains Original and Classic puzzles. Original puzzles are those that are created by the player or downloaded from friends in local or online wireless modes. Original puzzles can be classified as Normal or Free mode, and are given an automatically generated one to four star rating based on the puzzle's difficulty as assessed by the game. When these puzzles are played, the music selections are the same as in the regular Normal and Free modes depending on how the Original puzzle is classified. Classic puzzles are downloaded from the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. Downloadable puzzle packs will contain a variety of puzzles from classic Nintendo Picross titles; currently, puzzle packs from Mario's Picross, and Nintendo Power, are available in Europe and North America. As of November 21, 2007, twelve puzzle packs are currently available in North America, with two packs having been released biweekly starting on September 3, 2007. In Europe, only two packs have been released so far. In the classic mode, there is only one choice of music, which is not the same as any of the other modes but is different for Classic Normal mode and a Classic Free mode puzzles. The classic mode puzzles can be deleted at any time to make room for additional puzzles (ten packs can be held in memory at a time). Daily Picross contains up to five challenges, all on a 7√ó7 board with Normal mode rules. Mistakes in this mode incur a five-second penalty. Once a challenge is completed, the game time is recorded, graphed and assigned a letter grade, with A being an average time under 30 seconds. When other modes are unlocked, the grades are averaged together to obtain an overall grade, with five A grades resulting in the highest overall grade of S. The five challenges available in Daily Picross mode: *Nonstop Time Attack mode is initially available, which is a fast-paced series of five puzzles in rapid succession. *No X Marks mode is identical to Nonstop Time Attack, but the X mark, which is used to mark squares that the player thinks cannot contain a filled mark, cannot be used. This mode is available after playing Daily Picross for three (not necessarily consecutive) days. *Error Search mode shows the player five partially completed puzzles, with some squares needing a fill and some of the filled squares erroneously filled. On the top screen, the player is shown how many squares must be filled and how many erroneous squares need to be cleared before the puzzle is complete. If a filled square is cleared that should not be, no penalty is incurred, but if a square is filled that should not be, it incurs a time penalty similar to the Nonstop Time Attack mode. This mode is available after playing Daily Picross for seven days. *Memory mode gives the player one puzzle to solve. For 20 seconds, the numerical clues on the edges of the grid are shown. After these disappear, the player is free to complete the puzzle. After various time intervals, one clue in one row or column is revealed until all of them are shown or the puzzle is complete. This mode is available after playing Daily Picross for twelve days. *Secret mode is similar to Nonstop Time Attack in that a 7√ó7 grid must be completed and time penalties are possible; however, three of the numerical clues are replaced with an X mark. Three numbers are placed on the top screen; one of each of these are the true clue, and must be determined by the player by filling out the rest of the puzzle. Only one puzzle needs to be completed to finish this challenge. This mode is available after playing Daily Picross for twenty days. Online challenges consist of two 10√ó10 puzzles in a row. If a mistake is made, the game grid is frozen for five seconds while the other player is allowed to continue. Players cannot see the other player's screen, but are shown a progress bar that estimates how close the other player is to completing the puzzles. The bar quivers when the opponent has been penalized for making a mistake. The first player to complete both puzzles wins. This mode may be played against friends with a friend code, or with a randomly selected challenger. Reception Dan Ryckert of Lawrence.com gave Picross DS a 9.4 out of 10 saying that \\"I couldn't have been more pleasantly surprised with Picross DS. It ranks up there with the system's elite in terms of \\"pick up and play\\" gameplay. With so much content and such a great price, you'd be a fool not to add this to your DS library.\\" Boys' Life gave the game 8 out of 10 praising fun and challenging puzzles but also criticized it for a short length and zero replayability.

Chinese bandit and soldier, involved in the Japanese attempt to control Chahar province in 1933. Noted for switching sides several times and returning to banditry. Later, during the Second Sino-Japanese War, he commanded some Nanjing Government puppet troops. The former goat-herder Liu Guitang officially became a full-time bandit in 1915 at the age of 23 in the mountains of southern Shandong.Graefe, p. 69. He rose to command a large band of bandits, which eventually surrendered themselves to a Chinese army unit that absorbed them into its ranks (a common recruitment practice of the time). Liu and his men were given new arms and equipment and some time later deserted. They were eventually taken back by the army, but deserted once again. Taken back again in 1931, they were sent by Gen. Han Fuqu to help garrison northern Shandong. After yet another desertion they were sent by the Young Marshal Zhang Xueliang to garrison Jehol against Japanese and Manchukuoan forces in early 1933. There Gen. Liu and his men finally went over to the Japanese and Liu was made a Manchukuoan commander. Liu Guitang, now under Japanese orders, was sent to the southeastern part of Chahar province in the Dolonor region with the object of causing trouble for the Chinese there. He then led his estimated 3,000 troops further east to Changpei. Reported at the time as a Japanese operation, it may have been done by Liu without Japan's approval.http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,769784,00.html Leng Pass, From the April 24, 1933 issue of TIME Magazine In late June a force of two corps of the Chahar People's Anti-Japanese Army under Ji Hongchang pushed northeast against Dolonnur. His southern corps, under Fang Zhenwu, advanced on Guyuan, held by Liu and his puppet army. Fang persuaded Liu to negotiate with him to change sides in return for surrendering Guyuan and other places on the Bashang Plateau. Liu agreed and retained command of his force, now called the 6th Route. Chiang Kai-shek began to oppose and subvert the Anti-Japanese Army, directing Song Zheyuan to incorporate, disperse or suppress the Anti-Japanese forces still under Fang Zhenwu. The Anti-Japanese Army was considerably reduced by Song's activities. Fang Zhenwu as the new commander-in-chief ordered the army east to Dushikou. On September 10, Liu met with Fang Zhenwu, Tang Yulin and Ji Hongchang at Yunzhou (north of Chicheng). Together they decided to reorganize the Anti-Japanese Army; Fang Zhenwu was to be commander- in-chief, Tang Yulin deputy commander-in-chief, Guitang Right Route commander, Ji Hongchang Left Route commander and the decision was taken to leave from Dushikou and advance south to attack Peking. After the meeting in September Liu changed sides. He was given the title of Bandit Suppression Commander of Eastern Chahar and command of three regiments stationed at Chicheng, Dushikou and Yunzhou. Liu's force then blocked Tang's troops from following the rest of the Anti-Japanese Army south, leaving Fang Zhenwu and Ji Hongchang to continue alone; they were defeated outside Peiking in October.Guo Rugui Over the next few months Liu and his men became discontented with their new employment. His forces clashed with the local militia when they tried to collect more taxes than were legally authorized. He tried to get his command posted to a more prosperous location where he would have difficulty getting food for his men. Sung Che-yuan refused his request. Liu and his men revolted on December 25, 1933, and sacked two towns. Under pressure from the forces of Tang Yulin, Liu's men loaded their loot on hundreds of commandeered camels and donkeys and moved south into the newly created demilitarized zone in northern Hopei. He moved back and forth across it to avoid the Japanese and Chinese armies, neither of which would employ him or his men anymore. On January 1, 1934, his force attacked a town within 15 miles of Peiking. Troops of Gen. Han Fuqu were sent against him and defeated Liu's force. He evaded capture and reached the Japanese concession in Tientsin. There he was said to have once more offered his services to the Japanese.Jowett pg.40 It seems he returned to Shandong sometime late in the 1930s, and during the Second Sino-Japanese War commanded a puppet garrison for the defense of Juxian in support of the Japanese attack on Linyi during the Battle of Xuzhou. He managed to become Commander of over 1000 puppet troops for the Nanjing government in Shandong province. It is claimed he was killed in combat with Communist guerrilla troops in November 1943.

It belongs to the broader class of substructural logics, or logics of residuated lattices;Ono (2003). it extends the logic of commutative bounded integral residuated lattices (known as H√∂hle's monoidal logic, Ono's FLew, or intuitionistic logic without contraction) by the axiom of prelinearity.  Motivation  In fuzzy logic, rather than regarding statements as being either true or false, we associate each statement with a numerical confidence in that statement. By convention the confidences range over the unit interval [0,1], where the maximal confidence 1 corresponds to the classical concept of true and the minimal confidence 0 corresponds to the classical concept of false. T-norms are binary functions on the real unit interval [0, 1] which in fuzzy logic are often used to represent a conjunction connective; if a,b \\\\in [0,1] are the confidences we ascribe to the statements A and B respectively, then one uses a t-norm * to calculate the confidence a*b ascribed to the compound statement ‚ÄòA and B‚Äô. A t-norm * has to satisfy the properties of :commutativity a*b = b*a , :associativity (a*b)*c = a*(b*c) , :monotonicity ‚Äî if a \\\\leqslant b and c \\\\leqslant d then a*c \\\\leqslant b*d , :and having 1 as identity element 1*a = a . Notably absent from this list is the property of idempotence a*a = a ; the closest one gets is that a*a \\\\leqslant 1*a = a . It may seem strange to be less confident in ‚ÄòA and A‚Äô than in just A, but we generally do want to allow for letting the confidence a*b in a combined ‚ÄòA and B‚Äô be less than both the confidence a in A and the confidence b in B, and then the ordering a*b < a \\\\leqslant b by monotonicity requires a*a \\\\leqslant a*b < a . Another way of putting it is that the t-norm can only take into account the confidences as numbers, not the reasons that may be behind ascribing those confidences; thus it cannot treat ‚ÄòA and A‚Äô differently from ‚ÄòA and B, where we are equally confident in both‚Äô. Because the symbol \\\\wedge via its use in lattice theory is very closely associated with the idempotence property, it can be useful to switch to a different symbol for conjunction that is not necessarily idempotent. In the fuzzy logic tradition one sometimes uses \\\\& for this \\"strong\\" conjunction, but this article follows the substructural logic tradition of using \\\\otimes for the strong conjunction; thus a*b is the confidence we ascribe to the statement A \\\\otimes B (still read ‚ÄòA and B‚Äô, perhaps with ‚Äòstrong‚Äô or ‚Äòmultiplicative‚Äô as qualification of the ‚Äòand‚Äô). Having formalised conjunction \\\\otimes, one wishes to continue with the other connectives. One approach to doing that is to introduce negation as an order- reversing map [0,1] \\\\longrightarrow [0,1], then defining remaining connectives using De Morgan's laws, material implication, and the like. A problem with doing so is that the resulting logics may have undesirable properties: they may be too close to classical logic, or if not conversely not support expected inference rules. An alternative that makes the consequences of different choices more predictable is to instead continue with implication \\\\to as the second connective: this is overall the most common connective in axiomatisations of logic, and it has closer ties to the deductive aspects of logic than most other connectives. A confidence counterpart \\\\Rightarrow of the implication connective may in fact be defined directly as the residuum of the t-norm. The logical link between conjunction and implication is provided by something as fundamental as the inference rule modus ponens A, A \\\\to B \\\\vdash B: from A and A \\\\to B follows B. In the fuzzy logic case that is more rigorously written as A \\\\otimes (A \\\\to B) \\\\vdash B, because this makes explicit that our confidence for the premise(s) here is that in A \\\\otimes (A \\\\to B), not those in A and A \\\\to B separately. So if a and b are our confidences in A and B respectively, then a \\\\Rightarrow b is the sought confidence in A \\\\to B, and a * (a \\\\Rightarrow b) is the combined confidence in A \\\\otimes (A \\\\to B). We require that : a * (a \\\\mathbin{\\\\Rightarrow} b) \\\\leqslant b since our confidence b for B should not be less than our confidence a * (a \\\\Rightarrow b) in the statement A \\\\otimes (A \\\\to B) from which B logically follows. This bounds the sought confidence a \\\\Rightarrow b, and one approach for turning \\\\Rightarrow into a binary operation like * would be to make it as large as possible while respecting this bound: : a \\\\mathbin{\\\\Rightarrow} b \\\\equiv \\\\sup \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ x \\\\in [0,1] \\\\;\\\\big\\\\; a*x \\\\leqslant b \\\\right\\\\\\\\} . Taking x=0 gives a*x = a*0 \\\\leqslant 1*0 = 0 \\\\leqslant b , so the supremum is always of a nonempty bounded set and thus well-defined. For a general t-norm there remains the possibility that f_a(x) = a*x has a jump discontinuity at x = a \\\\mathbin{\\\\Rightarrow} b , in which case a * (a \\\\mathbin{\\\\Rightarrow} b) could come out strictly larger than b even though a \\\\mathbin{\\\\Rightarrow} b is defined as the least upper bound of xs satisfying a*x \\\\leqslant b ; to prevent that and have the construction work as expected, we require that the t-norm * is left-continuous. The residuum of a left-continuous t-norm thus can be characterized as the weakest function that makes the fuzzy modus ponens valid, which makes it a suitable truth function for implication in fuzzy logic. More algebraically, we say that an operation \\\\Rightarrow is a residuum of a t-norm * if for all a, b, and c it satisfies : a*b\\\\le c if and only if a\\\\le (b \\\\mathbin{\\\\Rightarrow} c). This equivalence of numerical comparisons mirrors the equivalence of entailments : A \\\\otimes B \\\\vdash C if and only if A \\\\vdash B \\\\to C that exists because any proof of C from the premise A \\\\otimes B can be converted into a proof of B \\\\to C from the premise A by doing an extra implication introduction step, and conversely any proof of B \\\\to C from the premise A can be converted into a proof of C from the premise A \\\\otimes B by doing an extra implication elimination step. Left-continuity of the t-norm is the necessary and sufficient condition for this relationship between a t-norm conjunction and its residual implication to hold. Truth functions of further propositional connectives can be defined by means of the t-norm and its residuum, for instance the residual negation eg x=(x\\\\mathbin{\\\\Rightarrow} 0). In this way, the left-continuous t-norm, its residuum, and the truth functions of additional propositional connectives (see the section Standard semantics below) determine the truth values of complex propositional formulae in [0, 1]. Formulae that always evaluate to 1 are then called tautologies with respect to the given left-continuous t-norm *, or *\\\\mbox{-}tautologies. The set of all *\\\\mbox{-}tautologies is called the logic of the t-norm *, since these formulae represent the laws of fuzzy logic (determined by the t-norm) which hold (to degree 1) regardless of the truth degrees of atomic formulae. Some formulae are tautologies with respect to all left-continuous t-norms: they represent general laws of propositional fuzzy logic which are independent of the choice of a particular left-continuous t-norm. These formulae form the logic MTL, which can thus be characterized as the logic of left-continuous t-norms.Conjectured by Esteva and Godo who introduced the logic (2001), proved by Jenei and Montagna (2002).  Syntax  = Language = The language of the propositional logic MTL consists of countably many propositional variables and the following primitive logical connectives: * Implication \\\\rightarrow (binary) * Strong conjunction \\\\otimes (binary). The sign & is a more traditional notation for strong conjunction in the literature on fuzzy logic, while the notation \\\\otimes follows the tradition of substructural logics. * Weak conjunction \\\\wedge (binary), also called lattice conjunction (as it is always realized by the lattice operation of meet in algebraic semantics). Unlike BL and stronger fuzzy logics, weak conjunction is not definable in MTL and has to be included among primitive connectives. * Bottom \\\\bot (nullary ‚Äî a propositional constant; 0 or \\\\overline{0} are common alternative tokens and zero a common alternative name for the propositional constant (as the constants bottom and zero of substructural logics coincide in MTL). The following are the most common defined logical connectives: * Negation eg (unary), defined as :: eg A \\\\equiv A \\\\rightarrow \\\\bot * Equivalence \\\\leftrightarrow (binary), defined as ::A \\\\leftrightarrow B \\\\equiv (A \\\\rightarrow B) \\\\wedge (B \\\\rightarrow A) : In MTL, the definition is equivalent to (A \\\\rightarrow B) \\\\otimes (B \\\\rightarrow A). * (Weak) disjunction \\\\vee (binary), also called lattice disjunction (as it is always realized by the lattice operation of join in algebraic semantics), defined as ::A \\\\vee B \\\\equiv ((A \\\\rightarrow B) \\\\rightarrow B) \\\\wedge ((B \\\\rightarrow A) \\\\rightarrow A) * Top \\\\top (nullary), also called one and denoted by 1 or \\\\overline{1} (as the constants top and zero of substructural logics coincide in MTL), defined as ::\\\\top \\\\equiv \\\\bot \\\\rightarrow \\\\bot Well-formed formulae of MTL are defined as usual in propositional logics. In order to save parentheses, it is common to use the following order of precedence: * Unary connectives (bind most closely) * Binary connectives other than implication and equivalence * Implication and equivalence (bind most loosely) = Axioms = A Hilbert-style deduction system for MTL has been introduced by Esteva and Godo (2001). Its single derivation rule is modus ponens: :from A and A \\\\rightarrow B derive B. The following are its axiom schemata: :\\\\begin{array}{ll} {\\\\rm (MTL1)}\\\\colon & (A \\\\rightarrow B) \\\\rightarrow ((B \\\\rightarrow C) \\\\rightarrow (A \\\\rightarrow C))  {\\\\rm (MTL2)}\\\\colon & A \\\\otimes B \\\\rightarrow A {\\\\rm (MTL3)}\\\\colon & A \\\\otimes B \\\\rightarrow B \\\\otimes A {\\\\rm (MTL4a)}\\\\colon & A \\\\wedge B \\\\rightarrow A {\\\\rm (MTL4b)}\\\\colon & A \\\\wedge B \\\\rightarrow B \\\\wedge A {\\\\rm (MTL4c)}\\\\colon & A \\\\otimes (A \\\\rightarrow B) \\\\rightarrow A \\\\wedge B {\\\\rm (MTL5a)}\\\\colon & (A \\\\rightarrow (B \\\\rightarrow C)) \\\\rightarrow (A \\\\otimes B \\\\rightarrow C) {\\\\rm (MTL5b)}\\\\colon & (A \\\\otimes B \\\\rightarrow C) \\\\rightarrow (A \\\\rightarrow (B \\\\rightarrow C)) {\\\\rm (MTL6)}\\\\colon & ((A \\\\rightarrow B) \\\\rightarrow C) \\\\rightarrow (((B \\\\rightarrow A) \\\\rightarrow C) \\\\rightarrow C) {\\\\rm (MTL7)}\\\\colon & \\\\bot \\\\rightarrow A \\\\end{array} The traditional numbering of axioms, given in the left column, is derived from the numbering of axioms of H√°jek's basic fuzzy logic BL.H√°jek (1998), Definition 2.2.4. The axioms (MTL4a)‚Äì(MTL4c) replace the axiom of divisibility (BL4) of BL. The axioms (MTL5a) and (MTL5b) express the law of residuation and the axiom (MTL6) corresponds to the condition of prelinearity. The axioms (MTL2) and (MTL3) of the original axiomatic system were shown to be redundant (Chvalovsk√Ω, 2012) and (Cintula, 2005). All the other axioms were shown to be independent (Chvalovsk√Ω, 2012).  Semantics  Like in other propositional t-norm fuzzy logics, algebraic semantics is predominantly used for MTL, with three main classes of algebras with respect to which the logic is complete: * General semantics, formed of all MTL-algebras ‚Äî that is, all algebras for which the logic is sound * Linear semantics, formed of all linear MTL-algebras ‚Äî that is, all MTL-algebras whose lattice order is linear * Standard semantics, formed of all standard MTL-algebras ‚Äî that is, all MTL-algebras whose lattice reduct is the real unit interval [0, 1] with the usual order; they are uniquely determined by the function that interprets strong conjunction, which can be any left-continuous t-norm = General semantics =  MTL-algebras  Algebras for which the logic MTL is sound are called MTL-algebras. They can be characterized as prelinear commutative bounded integral residuated lattices. In more detail, an algebraic structure (L,\\\\wedge,\\\\vee,\\\\ast,\\\\Rightarrow,0,1) is an MTL-algebra if * (L,\\\\wedge,\\\\vee,0,1) is a bounded lattice with the top element 0 and bottom element 1 * (L,\\\\ast,1) is a commutative monoid * \\\\ast and \\\\Rightarrow form an adjoint pair, that is, z*x\\\\le y if and only if z\\\\le x\\\\Rightarrow y, where \\\\le is the lattice order of (L,\\\\wedge,\\\\vee), for all x, y, and z in L, (the residuation condition) * (x\\\\Rightarrow y)\\\\vee(y\\\\Rightarrow x)=1 holds for all x and y in L (the prelinearity condition) Important examples of MTL algebras are standard MTL-algebras on the real unit interval [0, 1]. Further examples include all Boolean algebras, all linear Heyting algebras (both with \\\\ast=\\\\wedge), all MV-algebras, all BL-algebras, etc. Since the residuation condition can equivalently be expressed by identities,The proof of Lemma 2.3.10 in H√°jek (1998) for BL-algebras can easily be adapted to work for MTL- algebras, too. MTL-algebras form a variety.  Interpretation of the logic MTL in MTL-algebras  The connectives of MTL are interpreted in MTL- algebras as follows: * Strong conjunction by the monoidal operation \\\\ast * Implication by the operation \\\\Rightarrow (which is called the residuum of \\\\ast) * Weak conjunction and weak disjunction by the lattice operations \\\\wedge and \\\\vee, respectively (usually denoted by the same symbols as the connectives, if no confusion can arise) * The truth constants zero (top) and one (bottom) by the constants 0 and 1 * The equivalence connective is interpreted by the operation \\\\Leftrightarrow defined as ::x\\\\Leftrightarrow y \\\\equiv (x\\\\Rightarrow y)\\\\wedge(y\\\\Rightarrow x) : Due to the prelinearity condition, this definition is equivalent to one that uses \\\\ast instead of \\\\wedge, thus ::x\\\\Leftrightarrow y \\\\equiv (x\\\\Rightarrow y)\\\\ast(y\\\\Rightarrow x) * Negation is interpreted by the definable operation -x \\\\equiv x\\\\Rightarrow 0 With this interpretation of connectives, any evaluation ev of propositional variables in L uniquely extends to an evaluation e of all well-formed formulae of MTL, by the following inductive definition (which generalizes Tarski's truth conditions), for any formulae A, B, and any propositional variable p: :\\\\begin{array}{rcl} e(p) &=& e_{\\\\mathrm v}(p)  e(\\\\bot) &=& 0  e(\\\\top) &=& 1  e(A\\\\otimes B) &=& e(A) \\\\ast e(B)  e(A\\\\rightarrow B) &=& e(A) \\\\Rightarrow e(B)  e(A\\\\wedge B) &=& e(A) \\\\wedge e(B)  e(A\\\\vee B) &=& e(A) \\\\vee e(B)  e(A\\\\leftrightarrow B) &=& e(A) \\\\Leftrightarrow e(B)  e( eg A) &=& e(A) \\\\Rightarrow 0 \\\\end{array} Informally, the truth value 1 represents full truth and the truth value 0 represents full falsity; intermediate truth values represent intermediate degrees of truth. Thus a formula is considered fully true under an evaluation e if e(A) = 1\\\\. A formula A is said to be valid in an MTL-algebra L if it is fully true under all evaluations in L, that is, if e(A) = 1 for all evaluations e in L. Some formulae (for instance, p ‚Üí p) are valid in any MTL-algebra; these are called tautologies of MTL. The notion of global entailment (or: global consequence) is defined for MTL as follows: a set of formulae Œì entails a formula A (or: A is a global consequence of Œì), in symbols \\\\Gamma\\\\models A, if for any evaluation e in any MTL-algebra, whenever e(B) = 1 for all formulae B in Œì, then also e(A) = 1\\\\. Informally, the global consequence relation represents the transmission of full truth in any MTL- algebra of truth values.  General soundness and completeness theorems  The logic MTL is sound and complete with respect to the class of all MTL- algebras (Esteva & Godo, 2001): :A formula is provable in MTL if and only if it is valid in all MTL-algebras. The notion of MTL-algebra is in fact so defined that MTL-algebras form the class of all algebras for which the logic MTL is sound. Furthermore, the strong completeness theorem holds:A general proof of the strong completeness with respect to all L-algebras for any weakly implicative logic L (which includes MTL) can be found in Cintula (2006). :A formula A is a global consequence in MTL of a set of formulae Œì if and only if A is derivable from Œì in MTL. = Linear semantics = Like algebras for other fuzzy logics,Cintula (2006). MTL-algebras enjoy the following linear subdirect decomposition property: : Every MTL-algebra is a subdirect product of linearly ordered MTL-algebras. (A subdirect product is a subalgebra of the direct product such that all projection maps are surjective. An MTL-algebra is linearly ordered if its lattice order is linear.) In consequence of the linear subdirect decomposition property of all MTL-algebras, the completeness theorem with respect to linear MTL-algebras (Esteva & Godo, 2001) holds: *A formula is provable in MTL if and only if it is valid in all linear MTL-algebras. *A formula A is derivable in MTL from a set of formulae Œì if and only if A is a global consequence in all linear MTL-algebras of Œì. = Standard semantics = Standard are called those MTL-algebras whose lattice reduct is the real unit interval [0, 1]. They are uniquely determined by the real-valued function that interprets strong conjunction, which can be any left-continuous t-norm \\\\ast. The standard MTL-algebra determined by a left-continuous t-norm \\\\ast is usually denoted by [0,1]_{\\\\ast}. In [0,1]_{\\\\ast}, implication is represented by the residuum of \\\\ast, weak conjunction and disjunction respectively by the minimum and maximum, and the truth constants zero and one respectively by the real numbers 0 and 1. The logic MTL is complete with respect to standard MTL- algebras; this fact is expressed by the standard completeness theorem (Jenei & Montagna, 2002): : A formula is provable in MTL if and only if it is valid in all standard MTL-algebras. Since MTL is complete with respect to standard MTL- algebras, which are determined by left-continuous t-norms, MTL is often referred to as the logic of left-continuous t-norms (similarly as BL is the logic of continuous t-norms).

As a result, they counted on the hope that Greeks had, that by supporting them those countries would also help the Greek Kingdom to fulfill its expectations for economic progress and territorial expansion.

The colonization roads were used by settlers to lead them toward areas for settlement, much like modern-day highways.  History  During the early 1800s, the government of Upper Canada (present-day Ontario) appropriated settlers to various lots which had been surveyed along the lake shores of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. The townships established along these fronts contained generally fertile land composed of glacial till and clay-rich loam. As these townships filled up, business opportunities presented themselves for investors to purchase native lands and open them to settlement. The Canada Company was the most successful of these ventures and brought settlers to vast areas of land in Western Ontario by building routes such as Huron Road and Toronto‚ÄìSydenham Road during the 1830s and 1840s. As these areas also filled, the government came under pressure to open up the unforgiving terrain of the Canadian Shield to settlement and sought to establish a network of east‚Äìwest and north‚Äìsouth roads between the Ottawa Valley and Georgian Bay. This area was known as the Ottawa‚ÄìHuron Tract. In 1847, an exploration survey was carried out by Robert Bell to lay out the lines that would become the Opeongo, Hastings, and Addington Roads. The Public Lands Act, passed in 1853, permitted the granting of land to settlers who were at least 18. Those settlers who cleared at least within four years, built a house within a year, and resided on the grant for at least five years would receive the title to that land. The government subsequently built over of roads over the following 20 years to provide access to these grants. However, the promises of fertile land in this new northern tract of wilderness proved false. Beneath thin layers of sparsely spread soil was solid granite. Where this granite descended deeper, valleys formed and filled with muskeg. Despite an early influx of settlers, the vast majority of grants were abandoned by the turn of the century; only 40% remained. During the first half of the 1900s, many of these colonization roads were incorporated into the growing provincial highway network. Some sections were improved to modern highway standards, while others were subsequently bypassed or abandoned. The roads that were not incorporated as highways either became local roads or were consumed by nature. Though many other roads in the province can be considered \\"colonization roads\\", such as Yonge Street, Hurontario Street, Provincial Road (later Highway 2), Talbot Trail, and the Penetanguishene Road, they were either constructed for military purposes or by private investment. In October 2016, the imagineNATIVE Film + Media Arts Festival premiered a documentary titled Colonization Road at the TIFF Bell Lightbox in Toronto. The documentary explores these roads within various treaty territories of Canada and the relationships which surround them. The film has toured throughout Canada, and in January 2017, the Firsthand program on CBC Television aired a broadcast version of Colonization Road.  Description  The terrain these roads pass through is interlaced with many hills, lakes, forests, swamps and bedrock outcroppings. The location of many of these roads is in the Canadian Shield, among the most rugged terrain in Ontario. The soil is generally thin and unsuitable for the agricultural development that these roads were built to spur. Most of the colonization roads are not provincially maintained highways. Instead, they follow county roads and local town/township roads. A few have even been converted into hiking trails and bike trails.  List of colonization roads  Below is a list of all the colonization roads. = The Addington Road = The Addington Road was surveyed as far north as the Opeongo Line in Brudenell The Addington Colonization Road was one of the initial routes surveyed in 1847. The contract to construct the road was awarded to A. B. Perry, who completed more than half of the length from the Clare River to the Opeongo Line by 1856.Country Road Maps - Mazinaw Country In the south, it began in the village of Clareview and travelled north to the Opeongo Line, where the village of Brudenell was established. From north of Clareview to the community of Ferguson Corners (southwest of Denbigh), Highway 41 follows the old road, though in many places bypasses have been constructed and the old road named the Addington Road followed by a number from one to eight. North of Ferguson Corners, the old road has been overtaken by the forest, though short spurs are evident west of Denbigh and north and south of Quadeville. = The Bobcaygeon Road = Carnarvon The Bobcaygeon Colonization Road opened up the northern half of Peterborough and Victoria counties and much of Haliburton County. The road begins in the village of Bobcaygeon and travels north through Minden, ending north of the Peterson Road (Highway 118). The old road was surveyed as far north as the Oxtongue River but never continued beyond that. It now forms the boundary between Minden and Algonquin Highlands and the boundary between Muskoka and Haliburton further north. The former Highway 649 and Highway 121 were eventually routed the majority of the southern half of this road. From Minden north to Highway 118, the road is a paved township road. Between Ox Narrows and Dorset, Highway 35 generally follows the original survey line. = The Buckhorn Road = The Buckhorn Road begins just north of Peterborough at Lakefield Road. From Peterborough to the town of Buckhorn, the Buckhorn Road is referred to as Highway 23 and is still labelled as the Buckhorn Road at many intersections. North of Buckhorn, the road is listed as Highway 36 until Flynn's Turn. From there, Highway 507 is renamed the Buckhorn Road until it reaches the town of Gooderham. Slightly west of Gooderham, the old colonization road continues via Highway 3, also known as Glamorgan Road, until it reaches Highway 118 just outside Haliburton. = The Burleigh Road = The Burleigh Road begins in Burleigh Falls and continues north along Ontario Highway 28. The highway bypasses the town Apsley. However, inside the town is the old colonization road by the name of Burleigh Street. Continuing up Highway 28, it overlapped Cheddar Road (Dyno Road or Haliburton County Road 48) after passing Kidds Corners. As it continued past the Dyno mine site, it turned west and went through the town of Cheddar, then continued to the town of Cope Falls. From there, it was known as the Burleigh Road again and continued north on the east side of Cope Creek, towards Cope Lake. In Cope Lake, it met Deer Lake Road, which ran east to the town of Deer Lake and Ontario Highway 500. The Burleigh Road then turned west, crossing over Cope Creek and the Irondale River, and into the town of Wilberforce. It then turned north onto Ontario Highway 500 and passed the Wilberforce Public School. From here on, it was again called the Burleigh Road and continued northeast, running on the east side of Clement Lake and the west side of Grace Lake. The road ended at the colonial Kennaway Road in the town of Haliburton. South of Wilberforce, much of the old Burleigh Road is private, rendering it unusable to the general population. Some of it is being used as snowmobile trails. The middle part is walkable, from the Wilberforce Public School to Clement Lake. Farms are very common along this part of the road. The northern part of the road can be reached by following Loop Road to the Wilberforce Legion. = The Cameron Road = The Cameron Road ran north from Rosedale to Minden and is now the route of Highway 35\\\\. = The Frontenac Road = Frontenac Road near Mountain Grove The Frontenac Road travelled north from Kingston to the Madawaska River at Matawatchan. The road was first surveyed in 1852 and 1853 by Provincial Land Surveyor Thomas Fraser Gibbs. Warren Godfrey (for whom a town along the road is named) oversaw construction, completing the road as far north as the Mississippi Road at Plevna via Parham, Mountain Grove and Ardoch. This task was finished by 1862. An extension northwest to the Madawaska River at Matawatchan was completed by 1869.Frontenac Road Historical Plaque However, much of this section has been lost to the forest. = The Garafraxa Road = The Garafraxa Road was built to extend Brock Road north from Guelph to the new settlement of Sydenham, renamed Owen Sound in 1851, on Georgian Bay. An Order in Council was passed that called for the building of this road on April 13, 1837. Deputy Surveyor Charles Rankin was allowed to lay a line between Oakville and Sydenham. Rankin surveyed the line north of Arthur before the 1837 Upper Canada Rebellion broke out in Toronto. In 1839, John McDonald was hired to resurvey the line. He completed the survey between Guelph and Fergus that year, and to Arthur by October 1842. Construction of the line between Arthur and Sydenham began at both ends in 1843. The entire route was navigable by 1848. By 1861, the majority had been gravelled, and tollgates were briefly established between Fergus and Owen Sound. The entire route became part of Highway 6 in 1920. = The Great North Road = The Great North Road connected Parry Sound Road in Parry Sound with the Nipissing Road in Commanda. Today, Highway 124 largely follows the old road. = The Hastings Road = The Hastings Road was surveyed and built to the northern boundary of Hastings county, north of the hamlet of Lake St. Peter. It was continued north into the district of Nipissing as the North Road, and at one time could be driven to an intersection with the current Highway 60 between Whitney and Madawaska. It previously intersected with the Snow, Monck and Peterson roads. = The Lavant Road = = The Mississippi Road = The Mississippi Road began at a junction with the Frontenac Road and the Snow Road in the village of Plevna and travelled northwest, bisecting the Addington Road near Denbigh. It ended at the Hastings Road in Bancroft, where the Monck Road continued west. Today, Brule Lake Road and Buckshot Lake Road (Lennox and Addington County Road 30) follow a majority of the southwest portion of the road. Between Denbigh and Bancroft, Highway 28 travels adjacent to the old road, which has generally been overrun by trees. = The Monck Road = The Monck Road was a dual- purpose road that established colonization and military routes east from Lake Couchiching to the junction of the Hastings and Mississippi colonization roads at what is now Bancroft. The Monck Road was surveyed through 1864 and 1865. Construction began the following year under Chief Engineer and was completed seven years later in 1873. It was named in honour of Charles Stanley Monck, who was Governor General of Canada at that time.Monck Road Historical Plaque It is one of the oldest provincial roads north of Toronto. The Monck Road starts at Atherley and runs beside Simcoe County 45 (Rama Road), then turns into the city of Kawartha Lakes. It crosses Highway 35 at Norland and carries on to Kimount, then turns right and crosses over the Burnt River. The Monck Road then turns left up the hill and continues towards Haliburton County 503, which runs from Furnace Falls to Bancroft. From Lake Couchiching, it extends 150 kilometres east to the Hastings Road at Bancroft. = The Muskoka Road = The Muskoka Road, most of which now forms Highway 11, was constructed in the late 1850s and early 1860s, quickly becoming the primary trunk road to Lake Nipissing. A series of towns eventually would flourish along its length, the first of which was Bracebridge. East of Muskoka Falls, Thomas J. McMurray established a townsite in the spring of 1861 at the intersection of the Muskoka Road and the Peterson Road.Parry Sound: Gateway to Northern Ontario. p. 47 Construction on the Muskoka Road began in 1858. At the time of Bracebridge's founding, the road did not extend beyond the Muskoka River. It was opened as far as Sundridge by 1875. Today Highway 11 follows a majority of the route but bypasses it in several locations, notably between Bracebridge and Huntsville. = The Ottawa and Opeongo Road = Old farm along the Opeongo Line The Ottawa and Opeongo Road, also known as the Opeongo Line, was one of the initial colonization roads surveyed by Hamlet Burritt and A. H. Sims under the supervision of Robert Bell in 1851‚Äì52. It was constructed westward from Renfrew beginning in 1854, reaching as far as the Hastings Road in Whitney by 1865; thereafter the survey line continued to Opeongo Lake. Today, Highway 60 follows the old road between Algonquin Park and east of Barry's Bay. At that point, the road branches out to the southeast, following portions of Renfrew County Road 66, 512 and 64. Approximately west of Dacre, it encounters Highway 41\\\\. From there to Renfrew, Highway 132 follows the old road. Several songs have been written about the Opeongo Line, one of the most recent by Canadian singer-songwriter Terry McLeish. His song, \\"The Opeongo Line\\", has been included in several musicals and a tourist CD production of this historic road. The now-abandoned settlement of Newfoundout was created as a result of the Opeongo Road and Public Land Act. Thirteen pioneer families took up occupation on the land they had been granted up a mountainside off the main road. These families struggled to farm the rocky soil for thirty years, from the 1860s to the 1890s, while their settlement failed to attract institutions or other settlers. It was officially declared abandoned by 1948. More recently, the ruined log cabins have occasionally attracted photographers due to their high level of preservation. = The Parry Sound Road =  Horseshoe Lake Road, Highway 141, Raymond Road, Manitoba Street  Highway 400/Highway 69, Highway 141, Muskoka District Road 35, Muskoka District Road 4  Parry Sound  Bracebridge  Parry Sound Horseshoe Lake Rosseau Bracebridge = The Pembroke and Mattawan Road = The Pembroke and Mattawan Road was proposed by the Minister of Agriculture Allan McNab in 1852. A survey was conducted in 1853 and construction began in 1854. By 1875, the road was officially open in the summer months. The original road went through what is now Canadian Forces Base Petawawa and the Atomic Energy lands north of the town of Chalk River. It followed what is now the Balmer Bay road east of the town of Deep River. West of Deep River, the old road winds back and forth across Highway 17, which was built in the 1930s. = The Peterson Road = The Peterson Road began in Bracebridge and travelled east to Maynooth, where it met the Hastings Road. From Maynooth, it snaked its way northeast to Barry's Bay to meet the Opeongo Line. It was surveyed by Joseph Peterson and built between 1858 and 1863 at a cost of around $39,000. Poor soil led to little settlement in the area and some sections were already overgrown by the 1870s, but the Maynooth-Combermere section proved to be a useful logging route. Today, the section from Bracebridge to Maynooth has mostly been consumed by the forest, though Highway 118 follows adjacent to the old road as far as Haliburton. A small section remains as a local township road east of Carnarvon named Tulip Road. The old road that runs from Haliburton to the north end of Benoir Lake, on the Elephant Lake Road is now untraceable. This part runs through the south end of Algonquin Park. The section from Maynooth to Combermere to Barry's Bay is now the route of Highway 62\\\\. = The Rosseau- Nipissing Road = The Rosseau-Nipissing Road, also called the Nipissing Road, encouraged settlement in what is now Parry Sound. The project was authorized in 1864, with surveying done from 1864‚Äì1865. Construction began in 1866, and the road was open by 1873. A railway from Gravenhurst to Callander rendered the Rosseau-Nipissing road obsolete by 1886, yet much of it is still often used.Ontario Plaque = The Snow Road = Township Road 506 in Plevna, the junction of the Mississippi, Frontenac and Snow Roads The Snow Road is a short, minor branch of the colonization road network that connected the northern end of the agricultural settlement in Maberly with the southeastern end of the Mississippi Road in Plevna. The Lavant Road branches off to the east at the midpoint of the road. Today, County Road 36 follows the Snow Road through Lanark County, while part of Highway 7 follows the portion lying within Frontenac County. = The Victoria Road = Head River, Kawartha Lakes 35 enters the Canadian Shield The Victoria Road continued north of its current terminus in Uphill into what is now the Queen Elizabeth II Wildlands Provincial Park. It then followed the Black River north-east to the Peterson Road in Vankoughnet; this part of the road fell into disuse in the late 1800s. Between 1956 and 1998, the portion of The Victoria Road between Highway 46 (Highway 48 after 1975) and Highway 503 was designated as Secondary Highway 505\\\\. On January 1, 1998, the entire road south of Uphill was designated as Victoria County Road 35\\\\. Victoria County was restructured as the city Kawartha Lakes on January 1, 2001. At the same time, the Victoria Road was renamed as Kawartha Lakes Road 35\\\\.

A stomp box (or stompbox) is a simple percussion instrument consisting of a small box placed under the foot, which is tapped or stamped on rhythmically to produce a sound similar to that of a bass drum. A stomp box allows a performer such as a singer or guitar player to create a simple rhythmic self-accompaniment. Stompboxes are most commonly used in American folk and blues music, but they are also used across the musical spectrum. There are commercially produced stomp boxes available, but performers often simply mount a dynamic microphone inside whatever wooden box they have handy. Some homemade stomp boxes include customized features such as a built-in preamp or equalizer. In 2010s-era use, a simple piezo transducer (or sometimes a microphone) is located inside the box to allow amplification of the stompbox's bass sound through the PA system or bass amplifier. Other stompboxes such as the PorchBoard Bass and the Peterman acoustic use magnetic sensors designed to produce low-end frequencies.
