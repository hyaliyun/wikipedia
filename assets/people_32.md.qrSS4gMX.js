History  Computer model of the Vector-06C Vector-06C was created by Soviet engineers Donat Temirazov and Alexander Sokolov from Kishinev, Moldovan SSR. On 33rd National Radio Exhibition the design was honoured with the grand prize. Shortly after that several factories started production of Vector-06C. In 1988 Vector was honoured a prize on Exhibition of Achievements of the National Economy. There were modifications adopting Zilog Z80 CPU or the unique Soviet KR580VM1 CPU. A commercial project called Vector Turbo+ with a Z80 CPU, clock frequency increased to 6 or 12 MHz, RAM sized up to 2 MiB and a variety of other improvements was in development. However, according to the InVector e-zine, a prototype of this system never left the work bench due to economical reasons. Vector has gradually become less popular with the increasing flow of IBM PC- compatible computers on Soviet and then CIS markets. Presently Vector-06C enjoys loyal following of the few remaining fans.  Hardware  CPU: KR580VM80A (8080 clone), factory overclocked to 3 MHz (standard frequency was 2.5MHz); Busses:8-bit data bus, 16-bit address bus; Memory: 64 KiB RAM, up to 32 KiB can be used as video memory; 2048 bytes of ROM (512 bytes in earlier models); = Video = Vector-06C Video Memory Structure Video system supports following modes: * 256√ó256 pixels, 16 simultaneously displayed colours out of 256-colour palette * 512√ó256 pixels, 4 simultaneously displayed colours out of 256-colour palette * 256√ó256 or 512√ó256 monochrome (memory saving mode) The frame buffer of Vector-06C is unusual for home computers. The memory is organized as 4 bit planes, palette index of each individual pixel is formed from individual bits in 4 planes. Thus the highest colour mode has 24=16 simultaneously displayed colours. The bit planes are defined as follows: a byte represents a horizontal span of 8 pixels. Next byte in video memory represents a span of 8 pixels above it and so on. Thus a bit plane in 256√ó256 mode can be viewed as 8-pixel wide columns, growing bottom-to-top, left-to- right; whole screen is thus covered by 32 columns. = Sound = 3-channel sound system based around KR580VI53, Soviet clone of Intel 8253 timer. Third party modifications allowed use of General Instruments AY-3-8910 or YM-2149. = Storage = Homemade external ROM cartridge A generic household tape recorder was used for persistent data storage. There were 2 modulation methods used, FSK and PSK. Standard 60-minute cassette could hold: * at least 512 KiB using PSK (1500‚Äì2400 bit/s data rate) * at least 360 KiB using FSK (1200 bit/s data rate) FSK was primarily used in compatibility modes, which allowed reading data written on Microsha, Radio-86RK and ZX Spectrum. Native tape format used by original software is PSK.  Software  Adskok by A.Z.Lebedev Vector-06C had no built-in software, the tiny ROM only contained a boot loader. The computer could thus only be used with external storage. Vector-06C was sold with a tape containing system utility and game programs. Third party applications could be obtained through various companies. Original software titles were games, programming languages (BASIC, Pascal, a monitor/debugger, Assembler), text and graphics editors, etc. Due to the versatility and wide hardware capabilities Vector can be used for education, work and entertainment. As a gaming system it surpassed most of the other Soviet PC thanks to its unique multi-color palette and reasonably fast graphics, smooth hardware vertical scrolling, capabilities of the hardware overlay up to 4 image plans, 3-voices sound chip, a fairly large amount of RAM. It was created hundreds of games in assembler and thousands in Basic for Vector. Many games ported from the MSX standard, and almost without any changes (Rise Out, Putup, Alibaba, Eric, Binary Land, Pac-Man, Pairs, Stop the express, and others), and less from the ZX Spectrum and IBM PC (Exolon, Color Lines, Boulder Dash, Cybernoid, Filler, Best of the Best, and others). Many games developed specially for Vector: Ambal, Adskok, Grotohod, Polet (Flight), Planet of Birds, Sea Hunter, Death Fight, Cyber Mutant and others. Wide graphics capabilities in many cases allowed with absolute accuracy to simulate the MSX, Spectrum, IBM PC and other PCs. With optional floppy disk extension, CP/M version 2.2 was adopted. This allowed a broad range of CP/M software to be used on Vector. It was also possible to run some Radio-86RK, Microsha, Specialist software items. Also, a method of low-level adaptation of ZX Spectrum and MSX titles was developed and some software items were ported. In particular, Vector User magazine mentions a software package consisting of a disassembler, a processor that substitutes Z80-specific instructions that 8080 was lacking with macros and a set of macros. The package was used to port several ZX Spectrum titles, namely Chess Master, West Bank, Jumping Jack .  User community  Although Vector-06C was foreshadowed by more mainstream home computers such as BK-0010, ZX Spectrum and its clones, it enjoyed a considerable loyal following of fans. Enthusiasts developed and produced software and hardware extensions for Vector. Among hardware extensions there are RAM-disk, floppy and HDD controllers, sound synthesizers, realtime clocks and others. Both commercial and public developments existed. There were electronic and hardcopy publications, most notably Invector, Vector User, Coman Info. Several software contests were held among Vector users, notably DemosFan that used to take place in St.Petersburg, Russia.

In 1935 he became the last peer to be tried in the House of Lords for a felony, manslaughter, the result of a car accident. He was found not guilty. He lost his father to a road accident; in his maiden speech in 1928 in the House of Lords he called for mandatory driving tests. Later he spoke for speed limits, both of which measures were introduced in 1934. He was one of four peers to have at times before 1945 supported Sir Oswald Mosley and his British Union of Fascists. Early life Russell was born in Belgravia, London,General Register Office Births Jan-Mar 1907 St George Hanover Square dist, 1a 419 educated at Eton College and studied engineering at Imperial College London. In 1926 he was commissioned into the 21st (Royal Gloucestershire Hussars) Armoured Car Company of the Territorial Army; he was promoted Lieutenant in 1929 and Captain in 1938. His hobby until 1935 was racing cars, and he was a young supporter of fascist Sir Oswald Mosley and his British Union of Fascists. In 1926 in Marylebone, he married Dorothy Evelyn Meyrick, daughter of 43 Club owner Kate Meyrick.GRO Marriages Jan-Mar 1926: Marylebone 1a 928a Since he was nineteen, the law at the time required him to have his mother's consent to the marriage, which he knew he could not obtain due to his fianc√©e's association with the West End. He therefore lied about his age claiming to be 21, for which he was fined ¬£50 by the Lord Mayor of London in the magistrates' court. In 1928 he made his maiden speech in the House of Lords, on the subject of road safety, in which he proposed introducing mandatory driving tests for anyone applying for a driving licence. During his career in the House he also argued for speed limits to be imposed. (Both measures were introduced by the Road Traffic Act 1934.) Trial in the House of Lords On 15 August 1935, Lord de Clifford was involved in a high speed head-on collision which killed a 26-year-old driver in Surrey, Douglas George Hopkins, and caused him injury, while driving his sports car on the wrong side of the road.General Registration Office, Southport, Death certificate ref: Reg. Dec. Quarter 1935, Surrey North Eastern District, vol 2a p 48 When a jury in the coroner's court found unanimously that an 'accident involving others' was the cause of death, and that he had been well beyond the speed limit, the police charged him with a felony. At first he was indicted and committed for trial at the Old Bailey, until it dawned on the courts that, as he was a peer of the realm, only the House of Lords could try him for a felony. Since this had not occurred since 1901, when The 2nd Earl Russell was convicted of bigamy, the House set up a select committee to investigate the precedents and rules for such a proceeding. The trial commenced on 12 December, with the Lord Chancellor, Lord Hailsham, presiding, in the capacity of Lord High Steward appointed by the Crown for the occasion. The Attorney General prosecuted the case. Admission to the public was by ticket only. This was to be the last ever trial in the House of Lords, since the right of peers to be tried by their peers for felonies was abolished by the Criminal Justice Act 1948. (The House still has the power to try impeachments.) Lord de Clifford's defence was that Hopkins's vehicle had been travelling at excessive speed on the wrong side and that de Clifford had been compelled to switch lanes at the last moment to avoid a collision, only for the other vehicle to do the same. This defence was successful and he was acquitted. Lord de Clifford still faced another charge of dangerous driving, which was not a felony and therefore could not be tried in the House. He was due to be tried in the Old Bailey in January. However, in view of his acquittal, the prosecution abandoned their case and a verdict of not guilty was entered. He made no more speeches in the House of Lords for nearly forty years. Life after the trial In 1936 he sued The Spectator for libel, settling out of court. He was named as a co-respondent in a divorce petition. Whether this was true or false, his own marriage survived. Following his trial in the House of Lords, de Clifford gave up racing cars. During the Second World War he transferred to the Royal Army Ordnance Corps in 1942 and the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers in 1943. In 1946, having reached the rank of lieutenant colonel, he joined the regular army. He was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1955 New Year Honours. He divorced in 1973, having separated from his wife after the war, and married Mina Margaret in 1974. Lord de Clifford died in 1982 aged 74 and was survived by his second wife and two sons by his first wife. He was succeeded in the barony by his elder son, John Edward.

Eva Luna takes us into the life of the eponymous protagonist, an orphan who grows up in an unidentified country in South America. While the country's political history, traced through several decades of the mid-20th century, bears many similarities to Chile (the author's original nationality), the geography and social context of the story depict a society more similar to Venezuela (where she was exiled for over a decade). The novel takes us through Eva Luna's journey through life so far and her ability to tell stories, interweaving Eva's personal story with the broader geopolitical turmoil of Latin America during the 1950s ‚Äì 1980s.  Plot  The story is told from Eva's first-person point of view. In some sections Eva narrates Rolf Carl√©'s life. The story opens as Eva describes her mother's life, and how her mother (Consuelo) ended up working for a Professor. One day, the professor‚Äôs Indian gardener is bitten by a snake and whilst on his deathbed, Consuelo makes love to him, thus conceiving Eva. Miraculously, Eva's father recovers. Eva's mother then dies after choking on a chicken bone and leaves Eva to fend for herself. After the Professor dies, Eva moves on and eventually stumbles upon Huberto Naranjo, who places her in the care of La Se√±ora, the owner of a brothel. After living in harmony for a few years, a new police chief moves in and immediately storms the brothel. Eva is forced to flee and is eventually found by Riad Halab√≠, a man with a cleft palate. Eva moves to Agua Santa with Halab√≠ and settles into her new life, living with Riad and his wife, Zulema. After a few years, Riad's cousin Kamal moves in to live with them. Zulema is instantly infatuated with Kamal and when Riad goes on a trip, she seduces him, after which Kamal immediately leaves. Eventually Zulema loses interest in life and commits suicide by shooting herself in the mouth. After Eva is detained on suspicion of murdering Zulema, Riad bribes the police to release Eva. Eva and Riad realize that she must leave to escape the rumors, but before she leaves they share one night of passion. When Eva returns to the city, she reunites with the beautiful and engaging transsexual Melecio, now known as Mim√≠. Eva then reunites with Huberto Naranjo for infrequent sexual encounters, which Eva treasures as the only time she can see her loved one. Huberto is leader of a guerrilla unit fighting a revolution. As time goes on, Eva realizes that Huberto, although a dear friend, is not the man for her. Throughout the novel a parallel narrative is told - the life of Rolf Carl√©, traced from childhood to adulthood. Rolf grows up in Eastern Europe with a sadistic father who returns from the war and regularly torments and humiliates his wife. After his father is killed by some local boys, Rolf's mother resolves to send him to South America to be raised by his Aunt and Uncle. As Rolf grows up, he becomes interested in reporting news and becomes a leading journalist, shooting film footage from the front line. Rolf films the guerrillas, meeting Huberto, and later Eva. As the two slowly fall in love, they help the guerrillas in releasing nine prisoners from jail as an act of rebellion. When the rescue is complete, the two retreat to his aunt and uncle‚Äôs home. There they profess their love for each other, consummating their relationship and agreeing to marry.  Characters  * Eva Luna: Narrator, daughter of Consuelo and an Indian gardener, orphaned at age six, talented storyteller, writer, revolutionary, survivor * Huberto Naranjo: Eva's friend for many years, a ragamuffin street boy, later a fighter in the guerilla movement, Eva's first love * Consuelo: Eva's mother, found in the middle of a jungle by missionaries (also an orphan), has red hair, gives Eva the gift of storytelling, dies by eating a chicken bone * Riad Hilab√≠: One of Eva's many \\"patrons\\" (people she lives with), but Riad is more of a father figure, Eva lives with him for many years, has a cleft-lip, known in his village as \\"the Turk\\" (from Turkey, speaks Arabic), very kind and generous, shopkeeper, incredible lover * El Negro: Friend of Huberto Naranjo, bartender * La Se√±ora: Lady-pimp, takes Eva in, gives her a makeover, makes Eva leave after The Revolt of the Whores so the police do not find her with a minor, best friend of Melecio/Mim√≠ * Melecio/Mim√≠: The best friend of La Se√±ora, a transgender woman, eventually becomes Mim√≠. Mim√≠ is a famous actress in telenovelas, and Eva‚Äôs good friend and roommate later in Eva's life, encourages Eva to write down her stories * Zulema: Riad Hilab√≠'s wife, hates Riad because he has a cleft lip, lazy, depressed, has a one-night affair with Riad's nephew, eventually commits suicide * Rolf Carl√©: Grows up in post-World War II Europe, has a sadistic father and a kind but passive mother, leaves his home after his father's death, lives with his aunt and uncle, has threesomes with his two cousins, becomes a photojournalist eventually filming the guerilla movement (he meets Naranjo this way), falls in love with Eva at close of novel.  Major themes  Several different ideas are raised by Allende in this novel, often called a picaresque novel, with regard to the protagonist and heroine, Eva. Her ability to tell stories and concoct tales is one of her gifts and it is through this ability that Eva is able to cope with the oppressive atmosphere in Latin America, directly following World War II. Eva's stories intertwine Magical realism, that is the amalgamation of supernatural elements and realistic themes. Through this means, Eva is able to 'escape' her reality and construct her own view of society that she is better able to deal with. Described as a modern Scheherazade, Eva's ability to induce others with her stories is her gift to the world, helping her deal with the difficulties that many women, like herself, faced in a tyrannical and explosive political environment. Allende critiques on the gender imbalance that was and still is present in most Latin American countries. Generally, women were regarded as objects, entities that were subjugated in a male hegemony. Through the protagonist Eva, Allende has found a character that reflects on all the characteristics that all women trying to survive in the harsh conditions of Latin America, should embody. Eva's name is itself symbolic. Luna is Spanish for \\"moon\\" ‚Äì a symbol of the matriarchal power that women possess. In many ways the character Eva reflects Allende herself and the struggle that she went through after her father's cousin, Salvador Allende, was overthrown as Chilean President on September 11, 1973.

Page from Le Livre des tournois (BnF Ms Fr 2695) Barth√©lemy d'Eyck, van Eyck or d' Eyckalso sometimes in contemporary documents Barth√©lemy de Cler, der Clers, Deick d'Ecle, d'Eilz ‚Äì Harthan, John, The Book of Hours, p.93, 1977, Thomas Y Crowell Company, New York, ( 1420 ‚Äì after 1470), was an Early Netherlandish artist who worked in France and probably in Burgundy as a painter and manuscript illuminator. He was active between about 1440 to about 1469.Tolley. Although no surviving works can be certainly documented as his, he was praised by contemporary authors as a leading artist of the day, and a number of important works are generally accepted as his. In particular, Barth√©lemy has been accepted by most experts as the artists formerly known as the Master of the Aix Annunciation for paintings, and the Master of Ren√© of Anjou for illuminated manuscripts.British Library also the Master of the C≈ìur d‚ÄôAmour Epris For the Master of the Shadows of the Tr√®s Riches Heures, see below. The Aix identification was first made in 1953 (by IP May, La Revue des Arts, 3) partly on the basis of a rather questionable signature on a book in the Brussels panel, but is generally accepted. The Master of 1456 is a name used for the author of the Lichtenstein portrait (see external links), probably also Barth√©lemy He is thought by many to be the Master of the Shadows responsible for parts of the calendar of the Tr√®s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry. Biography It is likely that he was related to Jan van Eyck but this cannot be documented. His stepfather was a cloth-merchant who followed Ren√© of Anjou to Naples and the South of France. His mother died in 1460, and was described as \\"Ydria Exters d'Allemagne\\" ‚Äì that is \\"of Germany\\", which might well have included all the Netherlands as far as the Proven√ßals were concerned. Jan van Eyck's brother, Lambert, seems also to have worked in Provence after Jan's death. Some authorities have proposed, on stylistic grounds as well as the likely family relationship, that Barth√©lemy trained in the workshop of Jan van Eyck, and worked in the 1430s on the Milan-Turin Hours, a famous and important illuminated manuscript, where a number of different painting \\"hands\\" have been distinguished. Much of this only survives in black-and-white photographs after its destruction in a fire in 1904. A painter called only \\"Barth√©lemy\\" is documented as working in Dijon for Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy in 1440; this may well be him. Ren√© of Anjou, who was to become Barth√©lemy's major patron, had been held prisoner there by Philip. By 1444 Barth√©lemy d'Eyck was in Aix-en-Provence in the South of France presumably working with the leading French painter Enguerrand Quarton as they witnessed a legal document together. Central panel of the Aix Annunciation, c. 1443‚Äì45. The Aix Annunciation, dating from 1443‚Äì1445, is now generally accepted as being by Barth√©lemy. It is a triptych, now dispersed between Aix-en-Provence, Brussels, Amsterdam and Rotterdam (one of the side-panels having been cut into two pieces). It was commissioned by a cloth-merchant who knew Barth√©lemy's stepfather , and combines influences from the Early Netherlandish art of Robert Campin and Jan van Eyck with those of Claus Sluter who worked at Dijon, and Colantonio from Naples (although some see this last influence as flowing in the other direction). Many of the iconographic details follow those from Annunciations by Jan van Eyck and his circle, such as the Washington Annunciation. Together with a fine portrait dated 1456 (Lichtenstein Collection, Vienna), and a fragment with a small crucified Christ in the Louvre, this is the only surviving panel painting associated with him; most of his later works are illuminated manuscripts commissioned by Ren√© of Anjou. Ren√© of Anjou was a prince of the Valois family who had a complicated range of titles and claims, including that of King of Naples, from which kingdom he was ejected by the House of Aragon by 1442. There is evidence that Barth√©lemy either went to Naples, or that his works were known there, as his influence has been detected in the work of the Neapolitan artists Colantonio and Antonello da Messina. Ren√© preferred to live in his territories in the South of France, or in the Loire Valley, and was a poet and amateur artist of some talent. For a long time he was thought personally responsible for the manuscript illuminations now generally attributed to Barth√©lemy. From about 1447 Barth√©lemy appears in surviving accounts as \\"peintre et varlet de chambre\\" ‚Äì the same positions as Jan van Eyck held with Philip the Bold (and the Limbourg brothers had held with the Duke of Berry). A \\"varlet de chambre\\" was a court appointment of considerable status as a personal attendant to Ren√©. He travelled with Ren√© to Guyenne and on several occasions to Angers. Between 1447 and 1449 his workroom was next to Ren√©'s private apartments, suggesting a considerable and unusual degree of closeness to his patron. His last appearance in the accounts is in 1469, when he was paid his own salary, plus that of three servants or assistants, and three horses. There is some evidence he lived until 1476. Manuscripts Emilia, Arcite, and Palamon worship at the shrines of the Gods ‚Äì from the Th√©s√©ide Surviving illuminated works attributed to Barth√©lemy include a Book of Hours (M.358) in the Morgan Library in New York, on which Quarton also worked, and five miniatures added to The London Hours of Ren√© of Anjou in the British Library which relate very personally and intensely to Ren√©'s unhappy situation whilst imprisoned in Dijon. Harthan suggests the designs for these may have been sketched by Ren√© himself for Barth√©lemy to execute: \\"the faithful interpreter of the King's exalted ideas, an inseparable, discreet companion and the effective partner, perhaps, in joint artistic enterprises\\"Harthan op cit pp 90‚Äì93 . The two best-known manuscripts are the Livre du cueur d'amour esprit and the Th√©s√©ide, both in Vienna (√ñsterreichische Nationalbibliothek, Codex 2597, 2617), dating from 1460‚Äì70, with sixteen and seven miniatures respectively. The Livre du cueur d'amour esprit was a courtly allegorical romance written (almost certainly) by Ren√©. This has spaces reserved for a further twenty-nine miniatures, and these are all completed in another manuscript by a much less brilliant artist, probably working from Barth√©lemy's drawings. This chivalric allegorical romance comes near the end of that tradition, and only allows Barth√©lemy's realism and human sympathy to be engaged in places. His exceptional skill at lighting effects is fully deployed; four of the sixteen miniatures are night scenes, and others show dawn or dusk with great brilliance. The larger and more populated scenes of the French translation of Boccaccio's Il Teseida delle nozze d'Emilia, in theory about Theseus, in practice another romance, include magnificent scenes of urban life. December from the calendar of the Tr√®s Riches Heures A slightly earlier work, again illustrating a text by Ren√©, is the King Ren√©'s Tournament Book (BnF Ms Fr 2695) which is unusual in being in watercolour, rather than tempera and on paper rather than vellum.Walther & Wolf, Masterpieces, pp 350‚Äì3. He is also believed by many art historians to be the Master of the Shadows who added to the illustration of the Tr√®s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry in the mid 15th century, long after the Limbourg brothers had produced the most famous miniatures (they and the Duke died in 1416, leaving the manuscript unfinished and unbound). By then the book may have belonged to Ren√©. The calendar scene for September, probably only partly by this master, shows the chateau at Saumur, which Ren√© owned, and where he spent much of the 1460s. He also painted the main calendar scenes for March (perhaps only in part), October and December. His spatial awareness was greater than that of the Limbourgs, and he included shadows, which are a very marked feature of the miniatures of Barth√©lemy. His faces, especially those of peasants, are more sharply individualised, although his figures are less elegant. Only these calendar scenes, and possibly the faces in the double-page Procession of St Gregory (Walther & Wolf, op cit), show his style; many other miniatures were added a generation later by Jean Colombe. ‚Äì Pognon does not identify the Master with Barth√©lemy; Walther and Wolf do, and also give him June from the calendar.

He was born at Douglas Castle, Douglas, South Lanarkshire, the son of William Douglas, 1st Marquess of Douglas, and his wife Margaret Hamilton, a daughter of Claud Hamilton, 1st Lord Paisley. Douglas was sent at an early age to the court of Louis XIII, where he was served the King as a Page, where he steadily moved through the levels of the Maison du Roi. Thirty Years War At the age of twenty, he was appointed colonel of the Scots Regiment (one of five Scottish units in French service in this period), the first of three brothers to do so.For the confusion and conflation regarding these units, particularly in the 1640s see Steve Murdoch and Alexia Grosjean, Alexander Leslie and the Scottish Generals of the Thirty Years' War, 1618‚Äì1648 (London, 2014), p.161 The Scots Regiment, was raised as its name suggests in Scotland in 1625, and had fought in Sweden in the early part of the Thirty Years' War, it returned to Scotland as the Royal regiment of Foot in 1633. In 1635, the regiment was bound to King Louis, \\"in all service except against the King of Great Britain\\". Originally it was commanded by Sir John Hepburn, who was killed at the siege of Saverne in 1636; it was then taken over by his nephew, Sir James Hepburn who was killed in action the following year. Douglas was appointed the new Colonel, and the name of the corps was altered to the R√©giment de Douglas, and numbers increased to twenty companies of 100 Scotsmen.Fraser, vol II, p.427; Steve Murdoch and Alexia Grosjean, Alexander Leslie and the Scottish Generals of the Thirty Years' War, 1618‚Äì1648 (London, 2014), pp.90, 150, 154, 161, 166 The regiment fought with distinction, under Douglas, occasionally under the ultimate command of Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne. Douglas was injured in August 1645, and received a letter of sympathy from Cardinal Mazarin. He was killed in a skirmish on the road between Arras and Douai on 21 October 1645, in an attempt to take the latter city from the Habsburgs. According to Fraser, Louis XIV had indicated his wish to raise Douglas to the rank of Field Marshal, on the very day that he died, though the appointment was never made.Fraser, vol II, p.427 Douglas' body was returned to Paris and buried at the Abbey of Saint-Germain- des-Pr√©s, beside other members of his family, including William Douglas, 10th Earl of Angus, his grandfather. A fine memorial was erected to his memory in the Chapelle de Sainte-Th√©r√®se, within the Abbey Church. Douglas was succeeded as colonel by his elder brother, Archibald Douglas, Earl of Angus. The R√©giment de Douglas returned to British service in 1662, and by 1812 it took its more famous name: The Royal Scots.

World Jewish Relief was formed in 1933 as a support group to German Jews under Nazi rule and played a major role in organising the Kindertransport which rescued around 10,000 German and Austrian children from Nazi Europe.. After the war, the organisation brought 732 child Holocaust survivors to Britain, the first 300 are known as The Windermere Children and collectively they are known as The Boys. Currently, World Jewish Relief functions as one of Britain's leading development organizations, working with Jewish and non-Jewish communities alike. World Jewish Relief operates programmes mainly in the Former Soviet Union but also in Eastern Europe, Africa, and Asia. Founding and beginning operations World Jewish Relief was originally called the Central British Fund for German Jewry (CBF) and was founded in 1933. CBF was founded following a meeting of UK Jewish community leaders with Members of Parliament. The meeting was the initiative of Neville Laski and Leonard Montefiore, president of the Anglo-Jewish Association.Gottlieb, Amy Zahl. Men of Vision: Anglo- Jewry's Aid to Victims of the Nazi Regime, 1933-1945. London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1998, p.12 The pair were co-chairmen of the Joint Foreign Committee, which united the efforts of the Board of Deputies and the Anglo-Jewish Association. Also involved was Otto Schiff, a German Jew from a prominent family (notably his uncle, the philanthropist Jacob Schiff) who had moved to the UK in 1896 and had been active in aiding refugees and migrants for decades, having been awarded an OBE for his efforts to aid Belgians during the First World War.Gottlieb, Amy Zahl. Men of Vision: Anglo-Jewry's Aid to Victims of the Nazi Regime, 1933-1945. London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1998, Founding members included Simon Marks, chairman and managing director of Marks & Spencer, Sir Robert Waley Cohen, managing director of Shell Oil, Lionel and Anthony de Rothschild, managing partners of N M Rothschild & Sons, and Dr Chaim Weizmann, who would later become the first President of Israel. Another leading member, Sir Osmond Elim d'Avigdor-Goldsmid felt that, through the CBF, ‚ÄòJews of every shade of belief and political thought have united in their efforts to assist German Jewry‚Äô.Gottlieb, Amy Zahl. Men of Vision: Anglo- Jewry's Aid to Victims of the Nazi Regime, 1933-1945. London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1998, p.30 Originally intended to provide support for German Jews who were immigrating to the British Mandate of Palestine, CBF originally funded projects such at Hebrew University, the Technion, and the Maccabi World Union so that these organisations could provide immigrants with the skills and experience needed to become functional members of society in Palestine. By the time of the launch of CBF's initial appeal in the Jewish Chronicle on the 26 May 1933, ¬£61,900 had been raised by 42 donors.Gottlieb, Amy Zahl. Men of Vision: Anglo-Jewry's Aid to Victims of the Nazi Regime, 1933-1945. London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1998,p.31 By the end of 1933, almost ¬£250,000 had been raised. The 1934 appeal raised ¬£176,000.Gottlieb, Amy Zahl. Men of Vision: Anglo-Jewry's Aid to Victims of the Nazi Regime, 1933-1945. London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1998,p.35 Due to funding problems, CBF increasingly turned its efforts away from Palestine and towards Britain. By 1935, CBF and the Jewish Refugees Committee (JRC) were funding a programme that placed Jewish scholars in British universities willing to take on faculty members and graduate students. The two programmes placed more than 200 refugees at universities, including Ernst Chain, whose subsequent work on penicillin earned him a Nobel Prize. In 1936, Robert Waley Cohen and the other CBF leadership were angered at the placement of Youth Aliyah emigrants into non-religious environments in Palestine.Gottlieb, Amy Zahl. Men of Vision: Anglo-Jewry's Aid to Victims of the Nazi Regime, 1933-1945. London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1998,p.130 CBF coordinated with the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) in 1936 to create the Council for German Jewry, which carried out much of the pre-war operations to emigrate German Jews. The two organisations aimed to raise ¬£3m that would resettle 66,000 German Jews.Gottlieb, Amy Zahl. Men of Vision: Anglo-Jewry's Aid to Victims of the Nazi Regime, 1933-1945. London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1998,p.68 Resulting from the German-Austrian Anschluss in 1938, thousands of new refugees in Austria looked to emigrate. Due to the volume of need for refugees, the Council for German Jewry, represented by Norman Bentwich, attended the √âvian Conference in France to push world leaders for less restrictive immigration policies, but they were largely ignored. The advent of Kristallnacht later in that year exacerbated the refugee crisis, leaving the JDC overwhelmed in both financial and human resource capacity. The Council for German Jewry was eventually able to persuade the UK Home Office to admit Jews regardless of financial backing, and consequently 68,000 Jews registered before the start of war. For its part, CBF worked with the NGO Save the Children to establish the Inter-Aid Committee, which helped 471 Jewish and Christian children go to boarding schools in Britain. Kindertransport In November 1938, Jewish leaders met with British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain to advocate for allowing German Jewish children to immigrate to the British Mandate of Palestine. This led the subject of children's immigration to Great Britain to be discussed in the next Cabinet meeting, and the UK changed its policy to allow for admittance of Jewish children with largely no paperwork. Having secured government support, CBF started the Kindertransport effort by establishing the Movement for Care of Children from Germany; together with the Baldwin Fund (headed by ex-Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin) the Movement raised ¬£545,000 (¬£28.8 million in 2013 GBP) for Kindertransport. The Movement also identified thousands of Jewish and non- Jewish families from across Britain to host Jewish children during the war years. Additionally, it set up unused summer camps on the south coast of England to house refugees waiting for homes, and coordinated with Dutch organisations to transport children from Germany to the UK. Their efforts were aided by Gertruida Wijsmuller-Meijer, a member of the Netherlands Children's Refugee Committee, who met with eventual Final Solution administrator Adolf Eichmann and persuaded him to permit unaccompanied children to go to Britain. By the outbreak of war, the Movement had evacuated 9,354 children from Germany, 90% of them Jewish. Activities during World War II Though evacuation attempts halted with the outbreak of war, CBF continued to support children who had already been evacuated and started new projects. CBF ensured that children were being educated in Jewish contexts, and together with the Movement, they took pains to ensure that every child could get religious education in the religion of her parents. After the war, CBF helped refugees to file claims to recover their families‚Äô property. Additionally, CBF and the Council for German Jewry leased a property with two campsites for ¬£350 a year in 1939, renovating them within six months and opening up a camp for young German men at risk of deportation, the Kitchener Camp at Richborough. Over 3,500 men and hundreds of their wives were in residence when war broke out, many of whom would have surely perished in the Holocaust. The camp was disbanded by 1940 as many of the men enlisted, fighting for Britain. The Richborough men ended up in the British company that was evacuated from Dunkirk in 1940. Post war years CBF set up and financed the Jewish Committee for Relief Abroad to help administer aid and support to Jewish survivors of Nazi-occupied areas, which was especially instrumental in the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. In 1947, Movement children were granted British citizenship, and CBF helped file claims to recover refugees‚Äô families‚Äô property. In addition, CBF supported 732 orphaned child Holocaust survivors in their relocation to Britain after the war, initially to Windermere, and later to 22 hostels around the country. They also set up the Primrose Club, a community centre in Belsize Park to assist their transition to post-war life. Most became British citizens. Present work The dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 prompted CBF to shift the focus of its aid efforts to support the two million Jews living there. CBF changed its name to World Jewish Relief in 1994 and has since the early 1990s focused on addressing the causes of poverty in the communities in which it works, in addition to meeting immediate needs. World Jewish Relief integrated with World Jewish Aid in 2007. World Jewish Relief currently funds three main types of projects: meeting immediate needs of vulnerable communities, securing sustainable livelihoods for those in poverty, and responding to international disasters. * Meeting Immediate Needs: World Jewish Relief works with vulnerable communities in the Former Soviet Union (FSU), primarily in Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus, and Georgia, who often depend on meagre state pensions or welfare entitlements. In those areas, the charity funds homecare, medical expenses, food and communal activities for clients. World Jewish Relief also works in communities to repair and renovate cold and insecure homes, offering their residents relief from the harsh winter weather conditions. The charity also works with partners in Ukraine to provide support for socially isolated communities, and it works with partners in Ukraine, Moldova and India to empower people living with disabilities there, with services including job training, specialist therapy, and wheelchair accessibility improvements. * Sustainable Livelihoods: World Jewish Relief launched its Livelihood Development Programme (LDP) in 2009, which currently operates in Moldova and Ukraine. The Moldova LDP works with women from vulnerable communities to provide job training, as well as Romanian language instruction, with the goal of program graduates finding employment and increased income. The Ukraine LDP works with men and women to provide job trainings and establish job centres in local Jewish Community Centres. World Jewish Relief also works with partners in Rwanda to provide educational and vocational training to orphaned and street children. * Disaster Response: World Jewish Relief leads the British Jewish community's response to international disasters, recently working in Haiti, Mozambique and countries in East Africa. In Japan, World Jewish Relief worked with Save the Children to establish spaces for displaced children following the 2011 tsunami there. After the 2010 floods in Pakistan, World Jewish Relief worked with partners to provide immediate needs to displaced communities in Bagh District and restore homes that had been damaged or destroyed. World Jewish Relief worked with Merlin following the 2010 Haiti earthquake to provide medical services for those in need, and it worked primarily in Kenya with partners to provide food services for those suffering from the East Africa food crisis.. As part of their disaster response work, World Jewish Relief raised over ¬£1 million for the 2015 Refugee Crisis. Since then they have implemented the Specialist Training and Employment Programme (STEP) working in the UK to help resettled refugees gain employment.

The shipment of dumped documents is unsorted, or contains a large quantity of information that is extraneous to the issue under inquiry, or is presented in an untimely manner, or some combination of these three characteristics. The phrase is often used by lawyers, but is in increasing use in the blogosphere. It is often seen as part of the characteristic behavior of an entity that is engaging in an ongoing pattern of activities intended to cover up unethical or criminal conduct. Examples As one facet of the dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy in 2007, relevant committees of both houses of the United States Congress, controlled by the Democratic Party, requested, and then subpoenaed, backstory information from the United States Department of Justice on how the process that resulted in these dismissals had taken place. The Justice Department was reluctant to respond in a friendly manner to these requests, which they regarded as hostile; the Department responded with significant quantities of unsorted and extraneous information. Many U.S. liberals saw this response as a series of document dumps and communicated amongst themselves accordingly: > A big new bundle of documents just got dumped by the Department of Justice. > Here's a link to the documents in PDF form at the House Judiciary Committee > website. As per our routine in recent document dumps, if you'd like to help > us cull through the mails and reports, use this thread to share your > findings with us and other TPMm Readers. Identify the items you find by > document dump set number and page number. (Josh Marshall, April 27, 2007). Document dumps are not restricted to the field of politics. Large organizations of all types have become adept at overwhelming news organizations and other entities requesting information under state and federal freedom of information and open records laws. In a 2011 example, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill responded to an appeals court order to release certain records related to 11 specific athletes with a document dump of thousands of pages of phone records and parking tickets. The court's order was related to a media request under North Carolina open records law related to an ongoing NCAA investigation of the UNC football program. An underlying principle of information theory is that information must be comprehensible in order to be useful. One universal characteristic of a document dump is that its shippers intend to slow down the process through which their adversaries can make this information comprehensible. In an effort to minimize negative coverage by the news media, document dumps will often take place at times when reporters are not on duty, such as late on a Friday when media members have left for the weekend. The Friday night news dump is a classic technique for politicians to announce a decision or action which they know will be controversial. The term \\"document dump\\" is rarely used in public by the shipper or its workers. Public use of the phrase tends to be confined to the recipients of the information.

He was the highest scoring tank ace of the Allies during World War II. Biography A descendant of Kuban Cossacks, Lavrinenko finished his training at Ulyanovsk Tank Academy in May 1938. He took part in Soviet campaigns in Poland in 1939 and Bessarabia in 1940. In 1941, he commanded the new T-34/76 tank. With 58 tanks and self- propelled guns eliminated in 1941 during Operation Barbarossa on the Eastern Front of World War II, he is considered to be one of the top Soviet tank aces of the war, despite his early death in 1941. He achieved such impressive results by taking advantage of the abilities of the T-34. The tank's armor and great mobility were clearly taken into consideration by Lavrinenko. On December 18, 1941, Lavrinenko was killed just after freeing the village of Goryuny and knocking out his 52nd tank. Immediately after the action the Germans began shelling the village intensively. Lavrinenko got out of his T-34 near the village and tried to reach the commander of the 17th Armoured Brigade, Lt Col N. Chernoyarov, in order to report his victory but he was killed by a German mortar shell fragment. Lavrinenko participated in 28 engagements in 2.5 months and has 52 confirmed kills. For his heroism, he was given Order of Lenin on December 22, 1941. Lavrinenko is buried in the area where he heroically fell after successfully defeating yet another attack on Moscow. After the war Marshal Mikhail Katukov along with other high generals petitioned to give Lavrinenko Hero of the Soviet Union, yet he would not receive the highest award for another half a decade. On May 5, 1990, Lavrinenko was posthumously awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. The total number of tanks damaged and destroyed by Lavrinenko is comparatively small next to aces like Michael Wittmann (138 tanks and 132 anti-tank guns), Otto Carius (150 tanks), Kurt Knispel (168 tanks), and several others. However, almost all the German tank aces of the war fought from start to finish, so their overall results were more significant. Lavrinenko destroyed 52 tanks in just 2.5 months of fierce fighting in 1941. This was an outstanding result in the Soviet Army, and no single Allied tank officer surpassed him during the whole war.

Through this holding company, MGM's former creditors own the studio. Its headquarters are in Beverly Hills, California, United States. History MGM Holdings was formed on February 11, 2005, by a Sony-led consortium, and on April 8, 2005, it acquired MGM in a US$4.8 billion leveraged buyout. From that period until its emergence from bankruptcy on December 20, 2010, MGM Holdings was owned by Providence Equity Partners (29%), TPG Capital (formerly Texas Pacific Group) (21%), Sony Corporation of America (20%), Comcast (20%), DLJ Merchant Banking Partners (7%), and Quadrangle Group (3%). =Attempted sale and bankruptcy protection= After being installed in August 2009 as MGM's new CEO, Stephen Cooper tried to convince MGM's lenders that they should restructure the company's long-term debt in order to allow the studio to continue with its current business model. The lenders refused to do so and argued that a sale was the only way to recoup their investment. Cooper agreed to conduct an auction to gauge the level of interest by potential buyers and the value of the assets for sale. On November 12, 2009, MGM announced it was \\"beginning a process to explore various strategic alternatives including operating as a standalone entity, forming strategic partnerships and evaluating a potential sale of the company.\\" Alternatives the company was exploring included the sale of the company or merger with another media firm, or an asset auction, which could have included the sale of its 4,000-title film and television library, the company logo, rights to the James Bond franchise, and half-ownership in the three Hobbit films. The studio also held out the possibility of gaining a large influx of cash from new investors, although industry analysts believed that alternative was unlikely to happen. Some industry analysts said sale of the studio could net $1.5 billion to $3 billion. Others pegged the value at between $2 billion to $2.5 billion. Potential buyers included Time Warner (which already owned the pre-May 1986 MGM library, had enough cash reserves, and co-produced the Hobbit films with MGM), Qualia Capital (a private equity fund led by Hollywood producer Amir Malin), 20th Century Fox (MGM's home entertainment distributor), and Lionsgate. MGM also announced that its creditors agreed to a forbearance on the company's debt payments originally until January 31, 2010, but the forbearance was extended to March 31, 2010. As of early December 2009, 16 companies had expressed interest in purchasing all or parts of MGM, although only two had actually negotiated a confidentiality agreement that would allow them to examine MGM's financial statements. The Hollywood Reporter said Warner Bros., 20th Century Fox, and Lionsgate were the leading suitors for the company. Industry observers worried, however, that buyers might only bid on a few of MGM's assets such as the James Bond film franchise or The Hobbit film which would draw bids of less than $1 billion. At least one industry trade publication said creditors would accept offers amounting to $2 billion for parts or all of the studio. Even a bid or bids totalling $1.8 billion might be accepted, industry observers said, if the buyer agreed to \\"schmuck insurance\\" (the right to convert debt to equity, under certain conditions and time- frames). On December 18, press reports said that News Corporation's 20th Century Fox film studio had been interested in purchasing MGM, but that News Corp. could not agree to the \\"restrictive\\" terms of MGM's nondisclosure agreement, which (in part) do not permit potential buyers to speak with MGM's creditors. The strict terms of the nondisclosure agreement also led two other potential buyers to refuse to participate, and several others were negotiating over the terms and unable to participate in the process. The due diligence process was \\"going slowly\\" one trade publication reported, with only four of the potential 20 companies participating as of December 18. MGM originally set Friday, January 15, as the deadline to receive bids from the companies interested in acquiring the studio. However, fewer bids than expected were made. Reliance Entertainment, which has a joint venture with DreamWorks, joined the bidding on the deadline date. News Corp. reportedly signed a nondisclosure agreement on or about January 15, and was considering a bid. On January 17, the New York Times reported that bids had been received from Time Warner, Lionsgate, and a few smaller companies but that most of the offers were below the $2 billion minimum. Some of the bids may have been below $1 billion, and nearly all the bids would require MGM to file for bankruptcy first and shed its debt obligations. But the Financial Times said sources believed most bids were within the $1.5 to $2 billion range. Barclays Capital, a British investment bank, was quoted as saying, \\"We find it unlikely that MGM's creditors would cleanly agree to a sale price materially below $2bn.\\" Time Warner, one media source reported, is seen by industry observers as the leading bidder since it already owns much of the MGM library and has large cash reserves. Qualia Capital, previously thought to be a potential bidder, has suggested that MGM's creditors could avoid forcing the studio into bankruptcy by agreeing to transform $500 million of debt into company stock (which would provide MGM with a cash infusion as well as eliminate a substantial portion of debt). By January 23, bids from Relativity Media (about $1.6 billion) and Reliance Entertainment (about $1.8 billion) were received as well. Six days later, MGM extended its deadline to March 31, and by the next day, News Corporation suggested that the company should offer MGM some cash to keep the company running. MGM stated in February 2010 that the studio would likely be sold in the next four months and that Hot Tub Time Machine might be one of the last four films to bear the MGM name. However, some stated that the company might continue as a label for new James Bond productions, as well as other movie properties culled from the MGM library. A few weeks later, MGM set March 19 as a deadline to receive bids from companies interested in acquiring the studio, including Time Warner and Lionsgate, although Time Warner was considered the most likely to buy the studio since its Warner Bros. catalog already included all the pre-1986 MGM titles originally acquired by Ted Turner. Eventually, MGM filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on November 3, 2010 and emerged on December 2 when the Federal Bankruptcy Court approved MGM's reorganization plan, which led to MGM's creditors taking over the company. On December 17, 2010, the company laid off about 50 staff members. =Creditor group ownership= Following the emergence from bankruptcy, MGM's secured lenders, which include Credit Suisse and JPMorgan Chase, jointly owned MGM Holdings Inc, which in turn owns the Hollywood studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. In December 2010, MGM named Spyglass partners Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum as the co-Chairs and co-CEOs of the studio; and also appointed Ann Mather, the ex-Pixar CFO to head MGM's new board of directors. On December 29, 2010, MGM signed a new lease with New York-based group George Comfort & Sons for a 6-story building in the corner of 235‚Äì269 N. Beverly, leaving its old headquarters in Century City. A late 2011 financial report revealed that MGM had acquired Tom Cruise's 30% stake in United Artists and once again owned 100% of UA. On July 31, 2012, MGM announced it would acquire Carl Icahn's stake in MGM Holdings for $590 million. Once the sale is complete, MGM will become a public company. In May 2012, MGM sold its minority non-voting shares of LAPTV to Fox International Channels while signing a long term contract for content with LAPTV. On July 31, 2012, MGM announced a deal with Carl Icahn, MGM's largest shareholder, to acquire his stake in MGM Holdings for US$590 million. The deal allowed MGM to set a market value of US$2.4-US$3 billion for the studio, in case it went public or sold to a strategic investor. On July 31, MGM sold MGM Networks, Inc. to Chellomedia, while retaining its US, Canada, UK, Germany and joint ventures in Brazil and Australia, to raise fund to buy out Carl Icahn and prepare for an IPO. Chellomedia (later acquired by AMC Networks and renamed the latter as AMC Networks International) has licensed the MGM brand and content to continue on the purchased MGM channels. In September 2014, MGM acquired a 55% interest in One Three Media and Lightworkers Media, both operated by Hollywood producers Mark Burnett and Roma Downey. The two companies, along with UA, were consolidated into a new film and television company known as United Artists Media Group. On December 14, 2015, MGM announced that it had acquired the remaining 45% stake of UAMG it did not yet own. Downey and Burnett will receive stakes in MGM collectively valued at $233 million with Hearst receiving cash. Additionally, Burnett was promoted to CEO of MGM Television, replacing the outgoing Roma Khanna. The planned over-the-top faith service will become a separate entity owned by MGM, Burnett, Downey, and Hearst. In October 2017, MGM's board renewed Gary Barber's contract as chairman and CEO until December 2022. In February 2018, Chris Brearton, the former media M&A; attorney of Latham and Watkins, was appointed as chief operating officer. On March 19, 2018, MGM Holdings announced that Barber had been fired by the studio's board of directors. MGM gave no reason for his firing. For the interim, the company would be led by the newly formed \\"Office of the CEO\\". The \\"Office of the CEO\\" is made up of divisional heads and senior executives. Later in April, MGM decided to use the rights to the 25th James Bond film as leverage for a possible sale of the studio, with Annapurna Pictures and Warner Bros. seen as potential bidders. On May 21, it is reported that Barber (who still owns 9% of MGM through stock options) is exploring a bid to acquire MGM and is speaking to investment banks about financing his offer. Instead, Barber sells his stock and options to MGM in June in a three-year stand-still on company-related matters. In July 2018, MGM reset its debt capital structure to $2.5 billion which lowers the borrowing rate as MGM paid off the prior loan facility. This despite Moody's Investor Service reducing MGM on two key ratings because of increase TV spending and the departure of fiscally conservative Barber as CEO. Nancy Tellem, a director on the board since 2013, joined the company's Office of the CEO by February 7, 2019, with the title of executive director tasked with a long-term strategy. However, Tellem exited that position after six months in part due to clashes with Mark Burnett, TV group chairman. MGM's President of the Motion Picture Group, Jonathan Glickman, exited the company on February 1, 2020 with a first look deal starting with Aretha Franklin biographical Respect picture. Michael De Luca taking charge of the motion picture group as chairman effective March 1, 2020.

She published her novels in Mills & Boon since 1968. All her novels have also been published under Harlequin Enterprises Limited. Over a period of four decades, she has produced a body of sensuous work that investigates heritage, family, class and love. Her forte is to encode the opposing reading within the classic Harlequin plot. A synopsis of the author that accompanies her publications notes that she researched the market for romance fiction before electing to write in this category. Her first book published in North America established her reputation as a gifted storyteller. She has a strong vital writing style. As her career graph began in the late 1960s, Kay Thorpe, along with Charlotte Lamb and others, was one of the first writers to explore the boundaries of sexual desire, her novels often reflecting the forefront of the \\"sexual revolution\\" of the 1970s. As such she was also one of the first to create a modern romantic heroine: independent, imperfect, and perfectly capable of initiating a sexual or romantic relationship. However, under Kay Thorpe's expert analysis, the modern romantic heroine had to re-evaluate her age-old perceptions of what constituted love and marriage: she had to accept love unconditionally without looking for security in marriage. Biography Kay Thorpe was born in 1935 in England. After leaving school, she tried a variety of jobs, including dental nursing and a spell in the Women's Royal Air Force. In 1960, Kay was married to Tony, and five years later they had a son John. Now, she and her husband live on the outskirts of Chesterfield in Derbyshire. Her very first completed manuscript accepted, The Last of the Mallorys, was published in 1968. Since then she has written over 70 books. A word about the author Sometimes Kay Thorpe finds she has become two different people: the writer at her happiest when involved in the world of books and authors; and the housewife, turning her hands to the everyday needs of husband and son. Once in a while, she finds it difficult to step from one role to the other. She likes cooking, for instance, but she finds that it can be an irritating interruption when she's preoccupied with work on a novel, so the quality of her efforts in the kitchen tend to be a little erratic. She says, \\"As my husband once remarked, my writing gives life a fascinating element of uncertainty: one day a perfect coq au vin, the next day a couple of burned chops!\\" Luckily Kay has daily professional help with her housework, and that leaves her time to indulge in her hobbies. Like many other Harlequin authors, she admits to being a voracious consumer of books, a quality she shares with her readers. She likes music and horseback riding, which she does in the countryside near her home. But her favorite hobby is travel - especially to places that will make good settings for her books. Book notes I =Places and people = Kay Thorpe's stories are rich in details covering a diverse background. Unlike Flora Kidd and Robyn Donald, who showcase Scotland and New Zealand in their stories, Kay Thorpe gives her readers a taste for a myriad of locations. By and large, her stories are based on three locations, namely England, Canada and Africa. There are also stories based in Spain, Italy, South America, Greek Islands, Caribbean Islands, South Pacific Islands and Australia. Her main characters always stand by their British heritage. As a result, stories set outside England have an underlying subplot that explore how a newcomer from Britain can come to accept making a home for herself with one of the long-time British descendants settled in Canada or South Africa. For example, Safari South (1976), Timber Boss (1978) and Copper Lake (1981). In Storm Passage (1977) and Time out of Mind (1987), there is mention of how islands in the South Pacific and in the Caribbean came to be under private ownership by a British descendant. In Timber Boss (1978), there are references as to how Scottish settlers made the Canadian region of Nova Scotia their new home. Keith in Safari South (1976) appreciates the expansiveness of South Africa and the promising future the country offers him. While Keir in Temporary Marriage (1981) founds his fortunes as an engineering whiz in Sydney, Australia halfway around the world from his native English village. British engineers working in remote locations of hot and steamy Sierra Leone, the deserts of Libya, or the outback of Tanzania make up the scenery for The Iron Man (1974), The Man from Tripoli (1979), and No Passing Fancy (1980). In The Man at Kambala (1973) readers experience Masai Mara Reserve in Kenya. In Safari South (1976), they are taken to the Kruger National Park. The class division in British society provides the conflict for the love affair in Temporary Marriage (1981). Mention of public vs private schools, manner born, Irish vs English blood, cockney vs upper-class accents that indicate subtleties in class background make their way into her stories from the very first The Last of the Mallorys (1968) to other stories down the years such as No Passing Fancy (1980), A Man of Means (1983), and Win or Lose (1986). After man-woman relation, father-daughter and brother-sister relations take second place in many of her stories. While The Man at Kambala (1973) and No Passing Fancy (1980) have affectionate fathers indulging their daughters, the fathers in A Man of Means (1983) and The Land of the Incas (1983) prove self-serving. In Safari South (1976), Keith and Karen rekindle their sibling affections after years of being apart. While in Opportune Marriage (1969), the young woman realizes with a pang that her even younger brother is coming into his own and doesn't need her as before. As Lisa looks ahead to her stay in the family home as Kyle's wife in Time Out of Mind (1987), she considers the difficult personality of Kyle's mother as well as his brother. Kyle reassures Lisa that both mother and son can find alternative residences to stay. But Kyle's sentiment shifts in favor of his sister, which prompts him to mock Lisa, \\"Will Madalyn be a problem?\\". Kay Thorpe also takes a stab at the role of the mother, especially when mothers are relatively young compared to their daughters. In Never Trust a Stranger (1983) a forty-something lead actress Emily worries that casting her daughter Gemma in the same Broadway production with herself may bring out the advances in her age. The mother-daughter relationship becomes more poignant when Gemma accuses Logan of being a past lover of her mother. Although Logan denies the charge, there is no denying that the mother in Floodtide (1981) solicits sex from her son-in-law, which he declines albeit politely giving her the benefit of the doubt as needing for herself a full-blooded affair. Somewhere in her books Kay Thorpe throws in that British men think nothing much of their middle-aged wives, who still yearn for the love and romance of their not so far away youth. In The Iron Man (1974), Dave says that all wives are kept women. Dave's statement notwithstanding, Kay brings to life predatory women who elect to live off men. In This Side of Paradise (1979), Marie travels to a Caribbean resort with the purpose of securing for herself a moneyed man. In Bitter Alliance (1978) and in Never Trust a Stranger (1983), there are women who marry for money. Nonetheless, these women, promiscuous as their case is, are strong individuals who play by their own rules. A charismatic Ailsa in Full Circle (1978), knowing that her looks will not support her in the long run, has a Swiss bank account to fall back on for her olden days. Neil Davids, in This Side of Paradise (1979), says that there are women and there are women, some you use and some you cherish. If Kay showcases two types of women, one who is trading in security for love, and the other who is trading in love for money, she also brings about two competing urges in men, one who is looking for a life partner, and the other who is ready to walk away from a woman without a backward glance. As Liam in Bitter Alliance (1978), and Cal in Wilderness Trail (1978) grapple with movements in their own lives that test them with these two faces of women, Logan in Never Trust a Stranger (1983) must decide if marriage is meant for him. Although the romance series is designed to win the hearts of women, it is up to Kay's heroines to convince and to win over the hearts of these men so to propel them to make a choice in their favor. Theater is a backdrop Kay Thorpe takes up in several of her novels over ensuing decades. For example, Devon Interlude (1968), Curtain Call (1971), Never Trust a Stranger (1983) and The Land of Illusion (1988). In Never Trust a Stranger (1983), it is Logan's use of the word role that clues in would-be actress Gemma to who he is, a theater producer. In Full Circle (1978), Sara, in an unsteady galley kitchen, dishes out a savory coq au vin albeit with too much wine, which still draws Steve's complement. This story along with others such as Not Wanted on Voyage (1972), and Storm Passage (1977) opens a window to life aboard oceangoing watercrafts, be it in a ketch powered by sails or in an ice-breaking whaling ship. She also uses the sport of horse show jumping in Rising Star (1969), the circus world in Sawdust Season (1972), Corporate takeover in Dividing Line (1979), the international game of snooker in Win or Lose (1986), professional writing in This Side of Paradise (1979) and Skin Deep (1989), professional sculpting in Floodtide (1981), restoration of historical homes in Opportune Marriage (1969). Interwoven in the love stories, there are these varied interests shared by the main protagonists that lend a richness to the quality of the plots and educate the readers no less. =Love and marriage= Kay Thorpe explores many factors contributing to successful male-female intimate relationship, love and finally marriage and her writer's voice comes across strongly in each of her novels. Her narratives give the hero many advantages over the heroine, a trait found in stories of other renowned series novelists such as Flora Kidd, Charlotte Lamb, Robyn Donald just to name a few. However, the harlequin readers anticipate resistance from their heroine until the man confesses his undying love for her. An emotionally secured heroine can, in turn, confess her love for the man. Kay Thorpe's women, on the other hand, confess their love to men without first securing for themselves any safety net, emotional or otherwise. In such one-sided confessions, the women commit to staying with these men, willing to pay any price and to go with them just anywhere. For example, The Iron Man (1974), Bitter Alliance (1978), and Temporary Marriage (1981). In Olive Island (1972) Nikos Alexandros explains to Nickey that she will never be happy if the man does not dominate her. Nickey comes back smartly saying that British women are not as accommodating as Greek women. Jaime in Bitter Alliance (1978), on the other hand, admits to the dominant streak in Liam. But in the wake of her first admission comes a second one that Liam would love her like no other man can. This admission does not readily surface in Kay's other heroines. Therefore, the primary struggle is to fight against it. Ramon observes in Apple in Eden (1973) that a woman constantly baits the man, riling him on purpose; this is all but an attempt to meet up with her match in a man, who then wins her submission. In Safari South (1976), Brad is let down by Karen's answer to the question of compatibility between a man and a woman. Karen believes that she has to like what he likes and he has to like what she does. Brad counters that by saying what about personal likings and individual freedom? In This Side of Paradise (1979), Ryan responds to the same query by saying if two people are of the same mind, then one becomes superfluous, Gina's tentative answer to which is that one can agree to disagree. Men, as sexual drivers, are the quickest to recognize the significance of sexual compatibility so to use it like a mantra over and over in Kay Thorpe's stories that as long as the couple is sexually compatible it is a foundation from which they can build on. For example, in The Man From Tripoli (1979), Bryn expresses this sentiment to bolster up a simple marriage of convenience. Hence, the consensus that Kay establishes across her stories is that without sexual compatibility, there is no man-woman association to begin with. However, Steve in Full Circle (1978) tells Sara that a man can have sex with a woman with no strings attached. Therefore, for such an association to mature into any kind of relationship, women have to realize their own sexual potential to the fullest. Cynicism notwithstanding, Nick in Storm Passage (1977) tells Tara that it is not enough that she makes herself available but that she needs to be all woman in order to let their sexual chemistry work for the benefit of their marriage. As in the matching libido found between Jaime and Liam in Bitter Alliance (1978), when men find their own libido matching with that of the women, only then the relationship promises to be a lasting one. An older Annette in Sawdust Season (1972) tells young Toni that men are not the marrying type; that they only choose to do so when they find a woman whom they can't get out of their skin. Towards this end, Ross in Dividing Line (1979) tells Kerry that what she perceives as love is mostly made up of sexual attraction. Ross would not be appealing to Kerry if he couldn't arouse her sexually. While Dave in Win or Lose (1986) tells Sara that she is there with him to get laid, Dave in Iron Man (1974) accuses Kim of not confusing that kind of feeling with love. This reciprocal exchange of sexual needs places both men and women on an equal plane. However, Steve in Full Circle (1978) also tells Sara that a vast majority of women cannot have sex with men without being emotionally attached. This perception is not always forthcoming in all of Kay's male protagonists. And so, Kim in Iron Man (1974) rebutts Dave's accusation with her reply that wanting is part of loving for her kind of women. A drawback to women as emotional drivers is when they focus on security so that love becomes just another mean to this basic end. That men take an exception to this is clear from Ross in Dividing Line (1979), who confirms to Kerry that the latter wants to hold off sex until she has a ring on her finger and their signature on a paper. Since men can compartmentalize sexual love and respond to women who most match their libido and women hedge their sexual response to men over emotional attachment and security, the two sexes arrive at cross purposes with each other. In Storm Passage (1977), Nick voices just such a frustration to Tara who he says doesn't even recognize this difference. A lack of understanding of the divergent currents driving men and women easily transpire into mistrust so much so that in The Man from Tripoli (1979), despite the security blanket provided by her marriage, Lisa elects to leave Bryn because, without marital fidelity, she finds sexual love unconvincing. Sexual jealousy, albeit of her own sister, sows mistrust in Lyn's relationship with Andreas in Dangerous Moonlight (1985). In Curtain Call (1971), Ryan tells Kerry that for men a career would suffice whereas women want a home and a family. Therefore, Kay's men don't see the point in marriage unless it lasts. While proposing marriage to Gemma in Never Trust a Stranger (1983), Logan wants to convince himself that he can stay in it indefinitely and as such can't help but talk only about himself: Gemma doesn't bore him, she doesn't fill the place with clutter, to which Gemma secretly smiles thinking to herself that just give her time. The married men in Kay's stories show steadfastness in their commitment and no amount of ambivalence from their wives can shake them out of the will to make the marriage work. For example, in Remember This Stranger (1973), the wife, suffering from amnesia, refuses to accept the man as her husband despite all evidence pointing to this fact. The man, suffering from rejection, refuses to give up on her. However, keeping with the assertion made in Full Circle (1978) that a man's spontaneous attraction to a woman does not come with strings attached, Bryn, in The Man from Tripoli (1979), doesn't apologise to Lisa for flirting with other women. And Dave, in The Iron Man (1974), answers Kim's question of marital infidelity with a question of his own that if another woman takes undue interest in him, then what is she doing about it? Kay weaves this complexity into the couple's relationship to counter the paranoia she finds in women of jumping to suspect their partners of infidelity. In an opposite situation when Brad in Opportune Marriage (1969) suspects Lisa of infidelity, he confronts her directly but his emotions go flat when he asks whether she is in love. This is in keeping with another assertion made in Full Circle (1978) that vast majority of women cannot commit to a sexual relationship without some emotional attachment. In Full Circle (1978), the couple's marriage falls apart when Steve is unable to tolerate Sara's infidelity on the basis that sex aside, she must have been emotionally attached to the other man. Lisa in Opportune Marriage (1969) acknowledges that she was emotionally unfaithful to her husband if not sexually. She went to this other man for friendship that meant gentleness, tenderness and kindness, which for her construed an emotional cocoon. As Brad in Opportune Marriage (1969) says for everything that he was not. While Brad realizes what was lacking in him, Sara convinces Steve in Full Circle (1978) that her past indiscretion was an attempt at stark revenge for which she had no emotional attachment and that she reserved her deep love for him only. Having established a marital relationship on the basis of sexual compatibility and fidelity, the couple's personal knowledge of each other's virtues and vices come only with time. Soon after their marriage In Dangerous Moonlight (1985), Andreas asks Lyn that she doesn't really know him, does she? Although she is mortified by this discovery, he is unperturbed. Lyn finally realizes that she has all the years ahead of her to find out the answer to his query. To Sara's assertion in Full Circle (1978) that men are at their most vulnerable in the aftermath of sexual intercourse, a more experienced Ailsa tells her that men even then know what make them tick. It is In No Passing Fancy (1980) that a father advises his daughter, who demands more alone-time with her husband, saying that a man's career is his pride, and so not to get him away from it. A failure in career constitutes actual vulnerability in men. In Full Circle (1978), we learn that when a man is sick, depressed, or faces a setback in his career, is also when the woman can penetrate into his ego. And more than anyone else, a woman in the role of his wife, who knows the man from the inside, has the upper hand to witness him at his most vulnerable and then use the knowledge to her advantage. Kay charts the progress of desire, from curiosity to intimacy, and then writes about how sexual chemistry can blossom into tenderness, which she reveals in Floodtide (1981) is love. Although Kay makes her heroines accept love for its own sake as an unconditional emotion, the result is not humiliation but empowerment as the men reciprocate with sensitivity and depth. Here, Kay appreciates the fact that emotive words don't come easily to most men. Therefore, in Timber Boss (1978), and in Bitter Alliance (1978) after women have made their confessions of love, men contribute to it with cryptic but pregnant remarks such as there is no going back and don't say any more to seal their relationship. As strong-willed women submit to even stronger willed men, happiness follows. Book Notes II =Temporary marriage (1981)= Temporary Marriage (1981) is a Kay Thorpe classic. Regan and Keir are such meaningful names where the name Regan, stands out with pride like its namesake and Keir, an outlandish name suits someone who does something outlandish, coveting a girl beyond his social periphery and then turning hurt pride into zeal and determination. Regan and Keir's story does not finish with the first curtain close. They come together in a second act. But the ghost of the first one lies between them. To exorcise this ghost, they both act on impulses reaching impromptu decisions that voice deeply held sentiments, which they push out at the time from any detailed analysis. The pretext of marriage gives them the form needed to communicate at a level other than the one using clinical words. This is sexual love where unalloyed emotions bring out the affirmatives which are intellectually negated. And so this form of love opens up a window to their Will. And what comes by way of a rescue: a sudden crystallization of emotions. The pent up emotions wandering in the recesses and henceforth stamped out by reasonable means find a sudden release. In an outburst of emotions, the accompanying words flow in a torrent. However, the delivery is still negative in charge. But the negativity is so shrill and brittle in texture, that this time a true listener could hear the affirmation even when the words deny it. And so, it is for the listener to validate the affirmative sentiment behind the negative words. A true listener, then, is one who shares in the deep sentiment. This is a test for the listener as well, since if he/she didn't share, then the words would ring out empty and full of negative discord, and not resonate with affirming emotions. For both the speaker and the listener, there is selfishness in this emotion. The Man at Kambala (1973), The Iron Man (1974) and Sugar Cane Harvest (1975) also use this motif as the story's climax point.

He was also previously Foreign Minister of the ROC from 2004 to 2006 (the first Democratic Progressive Party member to occupy the position). Before returning to Taiwan, he worked for the United States Department of Commerce for 19 years. Career in Taiwan politics Chen became part of the Taiwan independence movement while he was completing his post- graduate education in the United States. In 1970, he organized the World United Formosans for Independence. After the establishment of the World Federation of Taiwanese Associations, Chen Tang-shan became its president from 1979 to 1984. Because of his political views, Chen was put on a blacklist by the Kuomintang government during this time, and was unable to return to Taiwan. He was eventually allowed to return with the advent of Taiwan's democratization. In 1992, Chen joined the Democratic Progressive Party and was elected a member of the Legislative Yuan. In December 1993, he was nominated the candidate of Tainan County Magistrate by the DPP and was elected. He was reelected again in 1997 with 66% of the vote. In 2001, Chen returned to the Legislative Yuan as a representative of Tainan County. He became the Republic of China's thirty-second Foreign Minister in 2004. After Frank Hsieh resigned his Premiership and a subsequent cabinet shuffle, Chen became the Secretary of the Presidential Office. In 2004, Chen gained international attention and prompted substantial criticism worldwide after he commented that Singapore is a \\"booger-size country\\" that \\"holding China's ball sacks\\" with both hands, known as the \\"LP incident\\". Foreign minister slams Singapore Taipei Times, Sept 28, 2004. Accessed on Nov 30, 2016. Subsequently, the Singaporean Foreign Ministry has issued a statement warning Taiwan authorities to \\"not belittle Singapore, and avoid using ‚Äúvulgar words to hurt others\\". Despite such comment, Singaporean politicians and lawmakers across the board and political spectrum overall refused to be drawn into a war of words or tensions over Chen's comments, which were described as \\"vulgar\\" and \\"undiplomatic\\", and even prompted criticism from some Taiwanese politicians, who urged him to withdraw such comments to avoid letting Singapore-Taiwan relations from deteriorating over the incident. However, Chen has not since taken back such words, but overall bilateral relations were not otherwise affected. In 2012, Chen was again elected to the Legislative Yuan for a four-year term, once again representing Tainan County. Alleged special fund misuse and acquittal On September 21, 2007, Chen faced charges of using false receipts to write off expenses from a special governmental account; the alleged misuse involved 368,199 Taiwan dollars (12,454 USD) during his time as foreign minister and presidential secretary general between July 2004 and June 2006. Vice President Annette Lu and DPP chairperson Yu Shyi-kun were also indicted on special fund abuse charges on the same day. Subsequently, in 2012, the Taipei District Court dismissed the case against Chen, finding him not guilty of all charges. Both Lu and Yu were similarly found not guilty. The court ruled that all three officials did not improperly use their special allowances and discretionary state affairs funds.\\"Lu special allowance fund trial begins\\", Taipei Times, 20 November 2007Taiwan's Vice President, two others indicted on corruption, M&G; Asia-Pacific News, Sep 21, 2007\\"Former officials found not guilty\\", Taipei Times, 3 July 2012\\"Former vice president found not guilty of special fund abuse\\", Focus Taiwan News Channel, 2 July 2012 Personal life He is a distant relative of Japanese politician Renh≈ç.

In 1936, Biologische Heilmittel Heel GmbH was founded in Berlin to develop and market his preparations. In 1953 Reckweg moved the company to its present location in Baden-Baden. Between the companies founding year 1936 and 1979 (when Reckeweg relocated to Albuquerque) he developed over 1,000 different homeopathic preparations available through Heel GmbH. When Reckeweg relocated to Albuquerque he created Biological Homeopathic Industries (BHI) and began manufacturing combination remedies in tablet form. In 1997, the Albuquerque company was renamed Heel USA Inc. In 2014, Heel USA became independent from the German Heel organization and operates under the name MediNatura Inc, which now manufactures and distributes BHI products and is the only legal importer of Heel products in the USA.

He first appeared in Strange Adventures Volume 1 #177 (June 1965). Multiple versions of his origin connect him to the villain Vandal Savage, with both gaining immortality by encountering a strange meteorite during prehistoric times. Immortal Man was also a founding member of The Forgotten Heroes. Traditionally, the Immortal Man has a unique form of reincarnation. If he is ever killed, he materializes in a new body somewhere else on Earth, clothed and with a jeweled amulet that granting him power and allows him to remember his previous lives.Strange Adventures #177 (June 1965). Strange Adventures #185 (February 1966).  Publication history  Immortal Man first appeared in Strange Adventures (Volume 1), one of the flagship science fiction anthology series of National Comics (now DC Comics) during the Silver Age of Comics. Published in issue #177 in June 1965, the 8-page story \\"I lived a Hundred Lives\\" was drawn by Jack Sparling. It is not clear who created him or if Sparling wrote the story as well. The story introduces the hero as a member of an ancient race of prehistoric superhumans who is given a magical amulet by the tribal chief so he may continue fighting evil for eternity by repeatedly reincarnating and recalling his past lives. Immortal Man was brought back to life in Strange Adventures #185 (1966) in a 16-page tale, with his reincarnation now explained as materializing in a new, clothed body soon after the death of his previous form. He then appeared again in Strange Adventures #190 (1966) and #198 (1967). Jack Sparling drew all four adventures, and Dave Wood wrote at least two of them (#185 and #190). Immortal Man featured on the covers of all four issues of Strange Adventures in which he appeared. In these four stories, the amulet also grants him the powers of telekinesis (granting flight and strength), pyrokinesis, and hypnosis. After 1967, the Immortal Man did not appear again until 17 years later in Action Comics #552 ‚Äì #553 (February ‚Äì March 1984), fighting alongside the Forgotten Heroes team in a story by Marv Wolfman and Gil Kane. This story gave the Immortal Man a new origin, one that connected him to the villain Vandal Savage. The story also removed his superhuman abilities beyond reincarnation, along with the idea that he belonged to a race of superhumans in his original life. A follow-up story appeared in DC Comics Presents #77 ‚Äì 78 (January ‚Äì February 1985) by Marv Wolfman, Curt Swan and Dave Hunt, the epilogue of which directly linked into DC Comics major cross-over event Crisis on Infinite Earths, also written by Wolfman. In this crossover event, the Immortal Man sacrifices his immortal energies to help save Earth from destruction, seemingly bringing his life to an end at last. Following his apparent death, the character appeared again in Animal Man #23 (May 1990) when the hero traveled through time and encountered a younger Immortal Man from before his death. In The Flash vol 2 #48 ‚Äì 50 (March ‚Äì May 1991), written by William Messner-Loebs with art by Greg Laroque and Jose Marzan Jr., a young girl named Steffi Jones was introduced as \\"the Immortal One\\". Inheriting the Immortal Man's memories and power of flight, she claims she is a new person rather than a continuation of the person who came before, then seemingly dies in an explosion, leaving her true nature unclear. The Immortal Man returned alive and well eight years later in Resurrection Man #25 ‚Äì 27 (June ‚Äì August 1999) by Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning. The storyline connected him to the hero Mitch Shelley and indicated he was not Steffi Jones. He dies at the end of the same storyline, and the circumstances imply he may not be able to reincarnate again. Following the DC Rebirth relaunch event in 2016, the character appears in the series The Immortal Men, now simply called Klarn, one of five beings who make up the Council of Immortals. His reincarnation ability and other powers are now gone, and he is simply ageless and invincible to injury like Vandal Savage. Fictional character biography =Silver Age= When first introduced, Immortal Man is reborn as a boy in modern times and has trouble remembering his origins. Found outside an orphanage, his caretaker finds a jeweled amulet around his neck and decides to keep it safe until the boy is older. Without it, the boy has no access to his power or previous life memories. Wanting freedom and confused by his expert level knowledge in a variety of fields (such as bullfighting, Japanese Samurai culture, and culinary arts), he runs away. After a few years, the now adult orphan returns to the orphanage to investigate his past and is finally given his jewel amulet, restoring his powers and memories. He recalls belonging to a \\"strange, ancient race\\" of cavemen who possessed superpowers. Thanks to a magical amulet given to him by the tribe chief, he is tasked to protect people from evil throughout eternity by constantly reincarnating in different bodies, sometimes older, sometimes younger. Over the millennia since, the Immortal Man has been a Babylonian, an Egyptian, a Greek, a Roman, a Carthaginian, an Arab, a European knight, a Mongol, and many others.all shown in flashbacks in various issues mentioned here ‚Äì and a hippie with excellent taste for music by The Electric Prunes in Animal Man #23 (May 1990) The next day, a burst reservoir threatens the town and the nameless Immortal Man acts to protect the citizens. He saves many but dies when a school boiler explodes near him. A journal where he recorded his discovery of his origins is later found.\\"I Lived a Hundred Lives\\" in Strange Adventures #177 (June 1965). The next story reveals that (following his death from the exploding boiler) the Immortal Man materializes as a clothed adult in an African jungle, the amulet around his neck. Unlike before, he immediately has access to his powers and memories, and it is revealed this is normally how his reincarnation works. After months of living as \\"Jungle Man,\\" he meets a pair of explorers and treasure hunters, Helen Phelps and her brother Rodney. The Immortal Man tries to protect them from a criminal named Karat who later uses a mystical artifact to bring a mythical beast to life. The Immortal Man sacrifices his life to protect the Phelps siblings from the beast. A month later, the Immortal Man materializes in a new body in England, wearing a suit and his amulet. Assuming the name \\"Mark King\\", he meets the Phelps siblings again and chases down Karat. Helen is drawn to King and realizes he is Jungle Man, having the same powers, personality traits, and amulet. The Immortal Man protects them from Karat but is killed in the process.Strange Adventures #185 (1966) Reborn in America, the Immortal Man assumes the identity of \\"Jason Kirk\\" and coincidentally meets Helen Phelps again months later. She suspects his identity but he then dies again while saving people from great monsters.\\"Immortal Man\\" in Strange Adventures #190 (July 1966) Months later, Helen Phelps tracks down the Immortal Man in his new identity \\"Anton Carver.\\" Realizing he loves her, the Immortal Man admits his identity and the two become engaged. When a dangerous dimensional rift threatens Earth, the Immortal Man asks Helen if he should risk himself again. Refusing to be selfish, she says yes and he sacrifices his life to close the rift. Helen hopes they will meet again soon.\\"The Apes with Bizarre Powers\\" in Strange Adventures\\" #198 (March 1967) =Revised origin and the Forgotten Heroes= Reintroduced in 1984, the Immortal Man no longer has super powers beyond his unique reincarnation and is given a revised origin (with further detail added in History of the DC Universe, The Flash Vol. 2 #48, and Resurrection Man #25-27). His reincarnation power is now said to work instantaneously, meaning his death now causes him to immediately materialize elsewhere in a new body. In the revised origin, the Immortal Man is born roughly 50,000 years ago as Klarn,\\"Persistence of Vision\\" in The Flash vol 2 #48 (March 1991) leader of the Bear Tribe.\\"History of the DC Universe\\" Book 1 (1986) Klarn is a mortal enemy of Vandar Adg of the Wolf Clan, their two clans repeatedly fighting. During one battle, a radioactive meteorite crashes nearby. Exposure to it makes Vandar immortal and invulnerable to injury while evolving his mind. After Vandar leaves, Klarn frees a glowing jewel from the meteorite and fashions it into an amulet. His mind also evolves and he later realizes he now has a unique form of reincarnation.\\"The World at Time's End\\" in Action Comics #553 (March 1984) Throughout history, he fights to protect people from threats and repeatedly interferes with the schemes of Vandar Adg, who adopts the name Vandal Savage. By the 1980s, the Immortal Man is living in the body of a middle-aged man of apparent European descent and has amassed great wealth and high-tech resources. Realizing Vandal Savage has a means to corrupt Superman, the Immortal Man attempts to contact the Justice League but the team is away on a mission. Rather than wait, he decides to deal with Savage's scheme and the mystery behind several strange golden pyramids by creating a team of \\"Forgotten Heroes\\", recruiting retired and semi-retired adventurers including: the Sea Devils, Cave Carson, Animal Man, Congo Bill, the time traveler Rip Hunter, Dolphin, and Rick Flag of the Suicide Squad. In the end, the heroes are triumphant and Superman recovers. Months after this adventure, Superman and the Immortal Man's Forgotten Heroes fight and defeat Vandal Savage's new team of \\"Forgotten Villains\\". Although the heroes win, the Immortal Man is killed while saving Dolphin from an attack by The Faceless Hunter From Saturn. Once the battle is finished, the Immortal Man appears again, now as a young man who appears to be of Asian heritage.\\"Triad of Terror\\" in DC Comics Presents #77 (January 1985) and \\"The Triad\\" in DC Comics Presents #78 (February 1985) During these 1980s stories, the Immortal Man's other powers do not play a major role. In the 1985-1986 crossover Crisis on Infinite Earths, the multiverse is threatened and all reality is in peril. During the final battles, Immortal Man sacrifices his immortal energies to help save the world, and is seemingly unable to return.\\"Death at the Dawn of Time\\" in Crisis on Infinite Earths #10 (January 1986) =Post-Crisis= Some time after the Immortal Man's sacrifice during the Crisis, an adolescent girl named Steffi Jones suddenly gains the Immortal Man's memories, as well as the power of flight. She helps the Flash against Vandal Savage and the speedster hero asks if she is the Immortal Man ina new body. Steffi says she doesn't think so; while she has Immortal Man's memories and instincts (but not his amulet), she believes she is a new person and refers to herself as \\"The Immortal One\\". No mention is made of Stefi's parents or if she was a child found and adopted, so it is also unclear if she was already alive before the Crisis, in which case she could not be Immortal Man. After Savage's plan is defeated, Steffi confronts him and the two are caught in an explosion that seemingly destroys them.The Flash vol 2 #48-50 (1991). Savage later turns up alive and continues battling Earth's superheroes. Steffi Jones is never seen again, making it unclear if she died in the blast or was reborn in a new body afterward or was indeed the original Immortal Man after all. In the 1990s, the comic series Resurrection Man reveals that the meteorite that Vandar Adg and Klarn encountered empowered carried \\"tektites\\" (a form of nanite-based technology). These tektites infected the two men to different degrees, granting them their unique abilities (with Immortal Man's amulet apparently maintaining his \\"tektite field\\"). The meteorite was hurled through time by unknown agents, landing in what would become the Ardennes Forest 1.93 million years ago, during the Pleistocene Era.note: Dan Abnett mistakenly describes it as the Pliocene, ‚Äì the Pliocene ended about 2.6 million years ago\\"Millenium Then\\" in Resurrection Man #25 (June 1999) In the late 20th century, the amnesiac hero Mitch Shelley begins operating as the Resurrection Man. Like Immortal Man and Vandal Savage, he has tektites in his body that grant him a form of immortality: every time he is killed, he returns moments or minutes later, fully healed and with a different superhuman power). The Forgotten Heroes encounter Mitch Shelley and believe he may be the Immortal Man with altered powers. Trying to jog his memory, they talk about an adventure they shared with Immortal Man soon before the Crisis, during which the hero had the form of a middle-aged man with black hair and white temples. Encountering Vandal Savage, the villain admits he has fought Mitch Shelley Shelley many times over throughout history, but reveals the Resurrection Man is an entirely separate person from the Immortal Man. To prove it, he reveals the real Immortal Man has been his prisoner since soon after the Crisis. The Immortal Man still has the appearance he had before the Crisis, indicating he did not reincarnate as Steffi Jones afterward.\\"Millenium Now\\" Resurrection Man #26 (July 1999) Resurrection Man, Vandal Savage, and the Immortal Man then join forces against a creature that emerges along with a second tektite meteorite. This creature, a \\"Warp Child\\", alters time and erases many of the world's heroes from reality. The Immortal Man melds his tektite field with the creature's own, overloading it and destroying them both while restoring history in the process. Because he overloaded his tektites, the source of his immortality, it is implied the Immoral Man is now truly dead.Resurrection Man #27 (1999). =DC Rebirth= Following the DC Rebirth 2016 relaunch of DC Comics, a new version of Immortal Man is introduced. In the new history, Klarn Arg is born in the 47th millennium BCE, a member of the Bear Clan with four siblings. One night, a radioactive meteorite strikes Earth and the four siblings investigate alongside Vandar Adg and the Wolf Clan. The five primitive humans are bathed in strange radiation that evolves their minds and makes them immortal. The five form a Council of Immortals and decide to help humanity but debate the best method to do so. Three methods debated are through knowledge, through harmony, or through expression. Klarn believes in saving humanity through firm and direct action, while his sister Kyra argues humanity rises through conquest. Over time, the Council of Immortals gain many followers. The five find they can also share immortality with those they feel are worthy, allowing some followers to remain with them for centuries. They each influence humanity but agree not to interfere with each other.The Immortal Men #1-4. Other versions In Final Crisis: Superman Beyond #1, Superman moves briefly through Earth-20, a world protected by the Society of Super-Heroes, led by Doc Fate (an alternate version of Doctor Fate) and including a version of Immortal Man.Final Crisis: Secret Files #1 (2009) Writer Grant Morrison described this particular parallel Earth as having the style of a \\"1940s retro thing\\", explaining why Doc Fate, the Immortal Man and their allies are drawn in the style of 1930s and 40s pulp magazine heroes.Interview with Grant Morrison ‚Äì In The Multiversity ‚Äì The Society of Super-Heroes: Conquerors from the Counter-World #1 (2014), it is revealed that this version of Immortal Man is actually Anthro, who in DC Comics is often cited to be one of Earth's first homo sapiens. On Earth-20, Anthro was exposed to the same meteorite that bestowed Vandal Savage's immortality. He and Doc Fate's Society of Super-Heroes are Earth-20's last defense against an invasion by Earth-40, an evil counterpart to Earth-20 where Vandal Savage and Lady Shiva lead an army of villains. Powers and abilities = Original Version = Empowered by a jewel he took from a meteorite (first said to be radioactive, later revised to be composed of microscopic technology called \\"tektites\\"), Klarn the Immortal Man possesses a reincarnation ability; if he dies, he soon materializes in a new body elsewhere on Earth, appearing from nowhere without having to be literally born again (as is usually the case with traditional reincarnation). His different bodies vary in age, physicality, and apparent nationality, but the basic personality remains the same. Although Immortal Man retains his learned skills and knowledge from previous lives, he sometimes has trouble remembering things at first, and the problem worsens if he does not have his amulet. The amulet seems to stabilize his power and knowledge (later comics say it does this by maintaining a \\"tektite field\\"). Due to his many lives across thousands of years, the Immortal Man is an excellent tactician, skilled in various forms of combat and survival, and is knowledgeable in many fields of study. In his four original 1960s stories, the Immortal Man's amulet also grants him psionic abilities. With his limited pyrokinetic abilities, he can create and control flame around him. His limited telepathic abilities allow him to hypnotize weak minds and commune with animals. His telekinesis allows him to fly and reinforce his own physical abilities, giving him the effect of superhuman strength. None of these powers appear again after his reintroduction in 1984, though Steffi Jones (who either inherits his power or is the Immortal Man in a new form) has the power of flight. During the series Resurrection Man, it was said the Immortal Man, Vandal Savage, and Mitch Shelley could all sense each other's presence due to their tektites reacting to each other. = DC Rebirth Version = Since DC Rebirth, Klarn does not repeatedly die and return in a different form. Instead, he is both ageless and invulnerable to harm following his contact with a radioactive meteorite. He can share his immortality but not his invulnerability to harm, meaning those he bestows with power are untouched by age or disease (the traditional definition of immortality) but can still be killed by physical damage or other outside factors.  In other media  In the shared Arrowverse of the CW network's DCTV shows, elements of Immortal Man's story are given to Hawkman and Hawkgirl as well as Rip Hunter, all of whom are sworn enemies of Vandal Savage in the that version of events.

The various meanings of the Latin word are all within the semantic field of \\"play, game, sport, training\\" (see also ludic).Oxford Latin Dictionary (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1982, 1985 reprint), pp. 1048‚Äì1049. An elementary or primary school or the school of the ‚Äúlitterator\\" attended by boys and girls up to the age of 11 was a ludus. Ludi were to be found throughout the city, and were run by a ludi magister (schoolmaster) who was often an educated slave or freedman. School started around six o'clock each morning and finished just after midday. Students were taught math, reading, writing, poetry, geometry and sometimes rhetoric. The word ludus also referred to a training school for gladiators; see Gladiator: Schools and training. Examples include the Ludus Magnus and Ludus Dacicus. Ludus was also the word for a board game, examples of which include ludus latrunculorum and ludus duodecim scriptorum, or a game played with knucklebones (astragali). Latin poetry often explores the concept of ludus as playfulness, both in the writing of poetry as a kind of play and as a field for erotic role-playing.Thomas N. Habinek, The World of Roman Song: From Ritualized Speech to Social Order (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2005), pp. 5, 143, et passim. \\"Poetic play (ludus, ludere, iocum, etc.),\\" Mich√®le Lowrie observes, \\"denotes two related things: stylistic elegance of the Alexandrian variety and erotic poetry.\\"Mich√®le Lowrie, Horace's Narrative Odes (Oxford University Press, 1997), p. 41. Ludi, always plural, were the games held in conjunction with Roman religious festivals. See also * Lusus Troiae, the Troy Game References Category:Ancient Roman culture ","title":"Ludus (ancient Rome)"},{"id":"11801186","text":"A Ludi Magister was a teacher at a Roman school, Roman Ludus. Magistri were often Greek or other educated slaves. The Ludi Magister was the teacher of the first stage of Roman education, the equivalent of an elementary school teacher. A Ludi Magister would have a class of around 30 students. Students would go to a Ludi magister at multiple ages and leave at the age of 11. Classes would be held in a room rented by the ludi magister or outside.  Role of a ludi magister  The subjects taught by a Ludi Magister were mainly reading and writing accompanied by a small knowledge of arithmetic and numbers. Teachers were allowed to employ corporal punishments if students were late or were disobedient and could be whipped. Many Roman boys attended this first stage of education; there was a medium fee and the skills learnt were essential. The skills were reading and writing Greek and Latin. However, only very rich families sent their daughters to school and most taught their daughters themselves or had their son teach them. For a girl other household skills such as making fabric and cooking were more important. A child would often be sent with a slave, a paedagogus, to school who would carry equipment and make sure they got there safely. The equipment used at this stage consisted of wax tablets (tabulae) which would be written on with a stick (stili) with a pointed end for writing and a flat end for rubbing the wax back so it could be written on again. Also, papyrus rolls and quills with black and red ink could be used, almost an equivalent to paper and pens but papyrus rolls were much rougher. As well as that, the ink was more durable as it was made of soot and resin. This was thinned by adding water to the thick substance. Some of the more durable and costly inks have been known to survive years buried under the ground.  Beyond the ludi magister  The second stage of Roman education was study under a grammaticus, and the third and final stage, only undertaken by young men from wealthy backgrounds, was instruction from a rhetor (the rhetor was almost always Greek and taught the art of public speaking). The ancient Romans did not have universities but they did have extra schooling taken by only the wealthiest families. An account cited that it was the custom among the wealthy Romans to pursue liberal education and that their elementary years were spent studying with a grammaticus and later, a rhetor. On the other hand, the students who came from the lower class studied under the ludi magister, suggesting that this teacher instructed in some form of trade school. Indeed, a description of the school noted that the ludi magister's place of work was small, lowly, noisy, and a familiar part of the Roman life. It was also said that the ludi magister's school competed with other schools and so his goal was to have a large number of students to earn the approval of his master.

The priority was to sign a goalscoring midfielder and the club seemed to have achieved just that with the signing of England midfielder Jimmy Bullard who signed for a record ¬£5 million from Fulham.\\"Hull complete ¬£5m Bullard swoop\\".

It is useful for studying chemicals with magnetically active nuclei (spins 1/2 and greater), and for studying molecular dynamics. The development of very sensitive magnetic sensors such as SQUID, GMR, and atomic magnetometers in the 2000s has made it possible to detect NMR signals directly in zero-field environments. Previous zero-field NMR experiments relied on indirect detection where the sample had to be shuttled from the shielded zero- field environment into a high magnetic field for detection with a conventional inductive pick-up coil. One successful implementation was using atomic magnetometers at zero magnetic field working with rubidium vapor cells to detect zero-field NMR. It is sometimes but inaccurately referred to as nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR).  See also  * Earth's field NMR * Low field NMR  References   Further reading  *M. P. Ledbetter, C. Crawford, A.

They were rebuilt in 1841 and remained the principal locomotive carriage and wagon workshops of the railway until closure in stages between 1891 and 1909. Thereafter a large steam motive power depot remained open on the site until 1967, serving Waterloo railway station. Original works The original locomotive, carriage and wagon workshops were built by the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) adjoining their original passenger terminus near the Vauxhall end of Nine Elms Lane in 1839, but suffered a disastrous fire in March 1841. They were rebuilt and from 1843 were used to construct over one hundred new locomotives for the company, to the designs of John Viret Gooch and Joseph Hamilton Beattie. Second works Within twenty years of their original construction it became apparent to Beattie that the restricted site originally chosen would be inadequate for the future needs of the company and so the facility was moved to a larger site south of the main line between 1861 and 1865.History of Nine Elms Locomotive Works & MPD http://www.svsfilm.com/nineelms/hoath.htm The second Nine Elms works was responsible for the construction of more than 700 steam locomotives before closure in 1909, to the designs of Joseph Hamilton Beattie, his son William George Beattie, William Adams and Dugald Drummond. The company enlarged the workshops on a number of occasions and at its height in 1904 the locomotive works employed 2,438 men, building 22 and repairing 450 locomotives in a year. By the mid-1880s it was clear that further expansion at Nine Elms would be impossible. The carriage and wagon shops were therefore transferred to Eastleigh in Hampshire in 1891, allowing for the temporary expansion of the locomotive works and the nearby motive power depot. Ultimately the locomotive works were transferred to Eastleigh between 1908 and December 1909. Motive power depot Ex-LSWR T14 class 4-6-0 on turntable at Nine Elms Locomotive Depot 1 March 1947. The principal function of the adjoining motive power depot was to provide and service locomotives for Waterloo railway station. The original motive power depot was opened on the north side of the main line by the London and Southampton Railway on 21 May 1838. It was closed and demolished in 1865. A second larger shed was built in 1849 on a site later occupied by the Nine Elms Goods Depot. This also closed in 1865. A replacement for these sheds, on the south of the main line, was opened in 1865 and demolished in 1876 to make way for the widening of the main line. A brick semi-roundhouse was built in 1876 and demolished in 1909.Nine Elms early maps A large fifteen road (fifteen track) shed was opened in 1885, which later became known as the 'Old Shed'. It was badly damaged during the Second World War and never fully repaired. This was adjoined by a ten-road shed in 1910 which became known as the 'New Shed'. The depot was demolished in 1967, after the end of steam working out of Waterloo on 10 July that year. The site is now a part of the New Covent Garden Market.

It took place in Pomerania and West Prussia from 10 February ‚Äì 4 April 1945. The operation happened in four phases: :Konitz-K√∂slin Offensive Operation 24 February ‚Äì 6 March 1945 :Danzig Offensive Operation 7‚Äì31 March 1945 :Arnswalde-Kolberg Offensive Operation 1‚Äì18 March 1945 :Altdamm Offensive Operation 18 March ‚Äì 4 April 1945 (near Stettin) It was the East Pomeranian Offensive that prevented Zhukov from reaching Berlin in February (the object of the massive Vistula‚ÄìOder Offensive), since it became a priority to clear German forces from Pomerania first. Planning Pomeranian and Silesian offensives The 2nd Belorussian Front‚Äîunder Konstantin Rokossovsky‚Äîhad initially been tasked with advancing westward north of the Vistula River toward Pomerania and the major port city of Danzig, with the primary aim of protecting the right flank of Zhukov's 1st Belorussian Front, which was pushing towards Berlin. During the East Prussian Offensive, however, Rokossovsky was ordered to wheel directly north toward Elbing.Duffy, p.170 This left substantial German forces intact in Pomerania, where they threatened the right flank of Zhukov's formations. As a result, once the initial phase of the East Prussian Offensive was over, the 2nd Belorussian Front was redeployed with the intention of attacking westwards into Pomerania, eliminating the possibility of a German counter-offensive (similarly, the parallel Silesian Offensives of Konev's 1st Ukrainian Front in the south were in part designed to protect the 1st Belorussian Front's left flank). The need to secure the flanks delayed the Soviets' final push towards Berlin, which was originally planned for February, until April. Joseph Stalin's decision to delay the push toward Berlin from February to April has been a subject of some controversy among both the Soviet generals and military historians, with one side arguing that the Soviets had a chance of securing Berlin much quicker and with much lower losses in February, and the other arguing that the danger of leaving large German formations on the flanks could have resulted in a successful German counter-attack and prolonged the war further: the Germans did in fact mount a surprise counter-attack in Pomerania in mid-February, Operation Solstice. The delay did, however, allow the Soviets to occupy significant parts of Austria in the Vienna Offensive. German intelligence As early as 13 February, German intelligence services had deduced that the Soviets would seek to clear Pomerania before advancing on Berlin. The 2nd Army‚Äîdefending a large and exposed sector running through Pomerania eastward toward the edge of East Prussia at Elbing ‚Äî sought permission to withdraw, but this was denied by Adolf Hitler.Duffy, pp.186‚Äì7 Graudenz, on the Vistula, was surrounded on 18 February (the garrison, from the 83rd Infantry Division‚Äîfinally surrendered the following month).

On 26 February, he inserted the 3rd Guards Tank Corps east of Neustettin, where they achieved a penetration of , and relieved Kozlov of command.Duffy, p.187 The 3rd Guards Tank Corps broke through at Baldenburg, while Neustettin on the Front's left flank fell to the 3rd Guards Cavalry Corps on 27 February. Wei√ü had hurriedly assembled the VII Panzer Corps, including the remnants of the 7th Panzer Division, at Rummelsburg to threaten 19th Army's flank. However, after a Soviet breakthrough at K√∂slin on 2 March, the 2nd Army found itself completely cut off from the rest of its Army Group. =1st Belorussian Front joins the attack= Soviet IS-2 in Stargard, 19 March 1945 Zhukov's right wing‚Äîa grouping of the 3rd Shock Army and 1st and 2nd Guards Tank Armies‚Äîwent over to the offensive on 1 March, striking northward with the main force concentrated at Reetz. The entire left wing of 3rd Panzer Army was cut off by their breakthrough, after Guderian refused Raus' request for withdrawal; the right flank withdrew towards Stettin.Duffy, p.188 On 4 March, forward Soviet tank units reached the Baltic, and the German forces in Pomerania were trapped in a series of encirclements. The 2nd Army began to fall back on the Danzig fortified area, while the X SS Corps of the 3rd Panzer Army had been surrounded at Dramburg. =The second phase= Rokossovsky opened the second phase of his offensive on March 6. The 2nd Shock Army threatened to cut off the defending forces in the fortress of Marienburg, which was evacuated two days later, while in the east Elbing finally fell on 10 March. The defence of Marienburg was conducted by a Kampfgruppe under the nominal control of the staff of the 7th Infantry Division, including marine, SS and other units. Wei√ü, having warned that the Elbing pocket could not be held, was relieved of command on 9 March and replaced by Dietrich von Saucken. The troops of the German 2nd Army withdrew in disarray into Danzig and Gdingen, where the 2nd Belorussian Front besieged them. Zhukov's forces meanwhile, cleared the remainder of 3rd Panzer Army from the east bank of the lower Oder, driving the Germans from their last positions in a bridgehead at Altdamm. Siege of Kolberg Many civilian refugees from Pomerania had fled into the coastal town of Kolberg, which was surrounded by 4 March. Nevertheless, the town was successfully defended until 18 March, by which time evacuation was almost complete. Siege of Danzig The Danzig- Gotenhafen (Gdingen) Fortified Area‚Äîalso the main port for refugees from East Prussia escaping to the west‚Äîwas ordered to be defended for as long as possible by von Saucken in order to keep the evacuation routes open. Rokossovsky opened his final offensive on 15 March 1945; the main thrust, toward the coast at Zoppot between Gdingen and Danzig, being undertaken by the 70th and 49th Army advancing in parallel.Duffy, p.223 The fighting was savage, but by 19 March 1945 the Soviet spearheads had reached the heights over Zoppot, while the 4th Panzer Division had been pushed back to the outskirts of Danzig itself. By 22 March 1945, the 70th Army reached the sea, splitting the German defence. Gdingen was taken on 26 March 1945, its defenders and many civilians retreating to the headland at Oxh√∂ft, from where they were evacuated to the Hel Peninsula. Danzig finally fell on 30 March 1945, after which the remnants of the 2nd Army withdrew to the Vistula delta southeast of the city. Evacuation of civilians and military personnel from there and from the Hel Peninsula continued until 10 May 1945. The Soviets declared the East Pomeranian Offensive complete a week after the fall of Danzig. According to Soviet claims, in the Battle of Danzig the Germans lost 39,000 soldiers dead and 10,000 captured.http://9may.ru/30.03.1945/inform/m4219 See also *History of Pomerania (1933‚Äì1945) *Operation Hannibal, the evacuation effort by the Kriegsmarine *Operation Solstice, the preceding German offensive in Pomerania *East Prussian Offensive, the parallel offensives of the 3rd Belorussian Front to the east *The Heiligenbeil Pocket, the parallel defence of the German 4.

Traver in the late 1920s. The Cyclone was located at the Crystal Beach Park in Ontario, Canada. History Three of these coasters (known as the 'Terrifying Triplets' of the Giant Cyclone Safety Coasters) were designed and built. The Crystal Beach 'Cyclone' and the Revere Beach 'Lightning' were both opened in 1927. The following year, the Schneck brothers, owners of Palisades Park in Fort Lee, NJ, contracted Traver to build a 'Cyclone' for the 1928 season. Of the three, the Crystal Beach version was the most famous and longest lasting, eventually being dismantled in September 1946 due to the high maintenance costs and falling revenues. Some of the wood and steel from the Cyclone was used by John Allen and Herbert Schmeck (both designers for the Philadelphia Toboggan Company) in the construction of the Crystal Beach Comet coaster in 1948. Construction Over 225 tonnes of metal were used in building the ride, which used a steel support structure instead of the more traditional wood. Having said this, it is still considered a \\"woodie\\", due to the construction of the track (300 X 25 millimetre wood laminants topped by a flat steel rail). Total length of wood used was about 6,100 metres - all British Columbia fir. At night, 1,000 small incandescent lamps lit the ride. Ride layout The layout consisted of a twisted arrangement of track with many curved, and steeply angled drops, banking at up to 80 degrees, the trains traversed multiple banked spirals and figure-8 sections. Other than one trim brake, there were no brake runs outside of the station as there were no level portions of track where brakes could be located (The trim brake was between the spiral's exit and the figure 8 element). =Ride features= * curve out of the station onto the lift * the chain lift * a spiraling first drop about 90 feet tall * a second hill which ended about 82 feet above the ground * an abrupt left turn down the second drop at 52 degrees * a spiral drop * the emergency brakes * a steep drop into the high speed figure eight * another drop and \\"hops\\" under the lift hill * a 210 degree high speed turn under the coaster's superstructure * a \\"zigzag\\" or \\"jazz twister\\" track (now called trick track) * a series of track which rose and fell like small, one foot bunny hops, leading back to the station =Differences between designs= All three were very similar in their design, following the same basic layout. The main difference in the design was that the spiral on the Cyclone at Palisades was even tighter than the two preceding coasters because of the extremely limited space in the park. Operation The ride ran one or two trains consisting of three or five four-passenger cars depending on crowds. Later, the trains would be permanently reduced to three cars to keep forces on the structure lower. Ride time was around 40 seconds, discounting station to top of the lift, which extended the time to a total of about 70 seconds. This would have been slightly faster than before opening day because almost half a metre had been removed from the height of the second hill due to roll-back problems. Reports say the ride at Crystal Beach drew 75,000 on opening day and crowds were so heavy that a railing was broken by those pushing to get close to the new ride. One patron rode 67 times that day and on its second day of operation, two boys rode 52 times. =Accidents and incidents= Over 5 million rides were given in the Cyclone's 20-year history with only one fatality. This occurred on opening day May 30, 1938, when 22-year-old Amos Wiedrich apparently stood up to take his suitcoat off, was thrown from the train after the first drop and fell to his death, being hit seconds later by the train he had been riding in. A failed lap bar was deemed to be the cause and the rider's estate was awarded $3000 by the court. Harry g. Traver and the 'terrifying triplets' Yvonne Salais died on the second day of sister coaster Lightning's operation, in 1927, after having jumped out. The Crystal Beach ride also kept a nurse in the station who was there to assist anyone who fainted, although she was originally hired to help lower insurance costs. Later, it is rumored that she was kept on the payroll to help keep the Cyclone known as one of the fiercest coasters around. Popular coaster lore says that she kept smelling salts on her and that a hot dog stand adjacent to the coaster sold splints. =Maintenance issues= These coasters, unfortunately, turned out to be a maintenance headache due to the high forces generated on the structure. Some reduction was gained through the use of three-car trains, but still the track suffered. According to Robert Cartmell's book \\"The Incredible Scream Machine: A History of the Roller Coaster\\", a man who worked at Palisades while the Traver-designed Cyclone operated said that he could not remember one week where it operated everyday. Structural and mechanical failures prevented it from being able to be open on anything resembling a regular schedule and the sheer viciousness of the ride did not help to endear the coaster to the park's visitors. In 1938, the entire ride at Crystal Beach was overhauled (supposedly by Herbert Schmeck) with many extra stress ties added. Ride Experience =Speed & G-Forces= The \\"Cyclone\\" was said to place over 4 Gs of force on passengers, and had a top speed approaching . Although the G-force statistic is likely true (and in fact may be low), the top speed advertised might be an exaggeration. The maximum velocity attainable from lift height to ground level, which the first drop did, would be with a zero initial velocity. If the cyclone imparted an initial velocity to the cars at the top of the hill (say from a lift chain) the car may have reached such advertised speeds. =Riders Quotes= Ed Cowley, who had ridden The \\"Cyclone\\" many times in his life, said: Erma Andrews, who piloted biplanes from the age of sixteen and became a registered nurse, rode the Crystal Beach \\"Cyclone\\" many times and recalled the following story: In September 2000 'coasterglobe.com interviewed Ed Mills, who described his experience of riding the Cyclone in 1945: www.coasterglobe.com - Lost Legends: Crystal Beach Cyclone  References  External links * Closed Canadian Parks, Ontario, Crystal Beach (1888-1989) * Ultimate rollercoaster.com Ride Designers - Harry G.

Biography Magarshack was born in Riga, in present-day Latvia, at the time part of the Russian Empire. In 1920, he moved to the United Kingdom in order to study, as anti-Jewish laws made it difficult for him to pursue higher education in Russia. After graduating from University College London with a degree in English Language and Literature in 1924, Magarshack attempted to make a career out of journalism, and then out of writing crime fiction, neither of which were successful. He gained British citizenship by naturalisation in 1931. In early 1949, Magarshack was approached by E.V. Rieu, the editor of the Penguin Classics series, in order to translate Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment. Magarshack accepted the job for an advance of ¬£200 and royalties of seven-and-a-half percent. Over the next 13 years, Magarshack went on to become one of the most prolific contributors to the Classics series. His last translation for the series, Chekhov's Lady with Lapdog and Other Stories, was published in 1964, after which Magarshack ceased translation for the series due to the new series editor's preference for more scholarly translations. Magarshack‚Äôs translation work was assisted by his wife Elsie, a Yorkshire-born, Cambridge-graduate of English. Magarshack‚Äôs daughter, Stella, has stated that Elsie helped Magarshack with all his translations and proofreading work. Magarshack wrote a series of biographies of Russian writers. His biography of Dostoyevsky was savagely critiqued by Joseph Frank who wrote: ‚ÄúIt is difficult to give any connected account of Mr. Magarshack‚Äôs interpretation of Dostoevsky because, to tell the truth, no such interpretation exists.‚Äù Magarshack continued to translate both contemporary and classic Russian literature. In addition, Magarshack wrote extensively on translation theory, though most of this work would remain unpublished. Magarshack died in London in 1977. Legacy Collections of Magarshack's writings, as well as his personal and professional correspondences, are held at the Leeds Russian Archive at the University of Leeds, as well as the Penguin archive at the University of Bristol. The novelist Anthony Powell paid the tribute: ‚ÄúDavid Magarshack has revolutionized the reading of Dostoyevsky‚Äôs novels in English by his translations which have appeared during the last few years ‚Ä¶ for years I was rather an anti- Dostoyevsky man, owing to the badness of the translations, but now there is an excellent translator in Magarshack‚Äù. (Punch, 2 April, 1958)‚Äô. The Nobel laureate Kazuo Ishiguro has identified Magarshack's translations as a significant influence on his writing style.

By mid-April, the East Pomeranian Offensive‚Äîcarried out by the 2nd, and elements of the 1st, Belorussian Fronts‚Äîhad succeeded in its objectives, reaching the important German port city of Stettin (now Szczecin). Motives Joseph Stalin's decision to delay the push toward Berlin from February to April 1945 has been a subject of controversy among Soviet generals and military historians, with one side arguing that in February the Soviets had a chance of securing Berlin much faster and with far fewer losses, and the other arguing that the possibility of large German formations (remnants of the Czech fortification system) remaining on the flanks could have resulted in a successful German counterattack and further prolonged the war. Stalin's aim in delaying the advance on Berlin had likely been political, as it allowed him to occupy substantial parts of Austria in the Vienna Offensive.

According to the South Carolina Department of Parks, Recreation and Tourism the theater has received the South Carolina Governor's Travel Award for Tourism and was designated as the Official Rural Drama State Theatre of South Carolina. It is included in the Abbeville Historic District.South Carolina Department of Archives and History page on Abbeville Opera House History At the turn of the 20th century there were many \\"road companies\\" producing shows in New York City. Once the production was assembled, the show traveled throughout the country. One of the more popular tours went from New York to Richmond to Atlanta. For a number of years, Abbeville was an overnight stop for the entire touring company. Several members of the community decided that if this area had a facility, since the travelling companies were coming through the area anyway, Abbeville could sponsor some of these touring productions. On October 1, 1908, what was then the Abbeville District dedicated a new Abbeville County Courthouse and City Hall. The grand old theatre now known as the Abbeville Opera House was a part of that splendid pair of buildings \\"equal in beauty of architecture and modern conveniences of any in the state,\\" according to regional newspaper accounts of the day. From that time on, all the \\"greats and near greats\\" played on the magnificent Opera House stage. Vaudeville was in its \\"heyday\\" as was Abbeville and the Abbeville Opera House. Today, most people who visit the historic Abbeville Opera House see a building that represents a microcosm of the history of Abbeville since the turn-of-the-century. Efforts toward preservation and renewal of Abbeville and the renewal of the Abbeville Opera House began some thirty years ago. The restored Abbeville Opera House continues to be one of the strongest drawing cards for the tourism industry in the upstate of South Carolina. The theatre operates year-round. The 218 newly refurbished seats face a stage. The balcony has 92 seats and the turn of the 20th century boxes seat up to 6 people in each of the four box seats.

The Landscape Area consists of five separate parts in the Danube Lowland, stretching from Bratislava in the north west, following the Danube and the borders between Slovakia and Hungary to a river island called Veƒækol√©lsky ostrov in Kom√°rno District. The biggest part is ≈Ωitn√Ω ostrov, the largest river island in Europe. The area is situated in three regions ‚Äì Bratislava, Trnava and Nitra. Altogether, it protects 122.84 km2 (47.43 mi2) of floodplains, wetlands and numerous water bodies, such as lakes, oxbow lakes, ponds, and streams. Dunajsk√© luhy PLA contains diverse flora and fauna, including endemic species, living in riparian zones. Geography The first part (farthest north) starts south of the Slovnaft oil refinery in south east Bratislava on the left side of the Danube, and it extends to the reservoir at the ƒåunovo waterworks. The second part is situated south west of the first one, on the right side of the Danube, near the boroughs of Rusovce and ƒåunovo. The third, largest part protects the island situated between the Danube and the border with Hungary. This area is protected almost entirely, except for the built up areas, the villages of Dobroho≈°≈•, Vojka nad Dunajom and Bod√≠ky and the levee alongside the Danube. The fourth area, located on the right side of the Danube, starts at the village of Sap, borders the villages of Medveƒèov and ƒå√≠ƒçov and ends at the village of Kl√≠≈æska Nem√°. The last fifth part is located on the Veƒækol√©lsky ostrov island, which ends in the east near the village of Zlatn√° na Ostrove. Biology and ecology Sunset over the Danube wetlands The whole area of the Dunajsk√© luhy PLA is listed as the site number 605 in the Ramsar Convention, an international treaty for the conservation and sustainable utilization of wetlands. =Flora= Aquatic plants are represented by many rare and protected species, such as the European white waterlily, yellow water-lily, Salvinia natans, water chestnut, Nymphoides peltata and others. Meadows are home to orchids, for example, Orchis coriophora (bug orchid), Military orchid, green-winged orchid, Epipactis helleborine, lesser butterfly-orchid, and others. The floodplains are covered with willows, alders, oaks, ashes, elms, poplars, European hornbeams, and dogwoods. =Fauna= Fauna is also influenced by a wide variety of biotopes in the Landscape Area. For instance, it contains 109 species of molluscs, of which 22 are protected, hundreds of true bugs, for example the endemic species Thinobius korbeli from the rove beetles family. The tundra vole is one of the most notable little mammals living in this area. Dunajsk√© luhy PLA is an important area for nesting and incubation of many water birds. Many rare species, such as the white-tailed eagle, little egret and purple heron, nest there. The whole Slovak-Hungarian part of the Danube is listed as an Important Bird Area. The Danube and surrounding bodies of water contain the highest number of species of fish in Slovakia. Rare and protected species include the wild form of the common carp, Umbra krameri (European mudminnow) from the order Esociformes, Pelecus cultratus from the family Cyprinidae, and Proterorhinus marmoratus (tubenose goby) from the goby family. Recreation Recreational activities include swimming, fishing, hiking, and biking. The Danube Bike Trail situated on or at the Danube levee allows bicyclists to tour along the whole Landscape Area.

It features the Tenth Doctor and Martha Jones. It was published on December 26, 2007, alongside Peacemaker and Wishing Well. It is also the second Tenth Doctor book to feature space pirates, after The Resurrection Casket. Plot After escaping from over-eager serving robots in Milky-Pink City, Martha asks the Doctor about the Starship Brilliant, which mysteriously disappeared. He agrees to investigate, but the TARDIS crashes on arrival and Martha is knocked out. She wakes in the ship's engine room, where she and the Doctor are led to the starship's experimental drive by the slave-like mechanics, who have small holes instead of mouths. The Doctor realises that the starship's experimental drive works by skipping out of space-time. However, it has become stalled, putting it at risk of exploding. They attempt to contact the captain, but find that the door out of the engine rooms is blocked with a membrane like scrambled egg. The Doctor notes that it separates regions where time flows at different rates, and uses his sonic screwdriver to allow them to pass through. Martha emerges by herself and meets the robot Gabriel, the ship's steward. He escorts her to the cocktail lounge, where she is befriended by Mrs Wingsworth, an egg-shaped alien. Martha learns that the ship has been invaded and asks Gabriel to warn the Doctor, but three badger-faced space pirates enter and disintegrate him. Two of the badgers, Dashiel and Jocelyn, leave to scout out the ship, leaving the third badger, Archibald, to guard the prisoners. He is amazed at the canap√©s which Martha offers to him, as he was raised on recycled food, and she convinces him to share the food with the passengers. Dashiel and Jocelyn return, having been unable to find either the ship's drive or their comrades. They try some of the food and are similarly impressed, with Martha noting that the canap√©s are mysteriously replenished. Dashiel disintegrates Mrs Wingsworth after she expresses her scorn at their lack of culture. Martha grabs Jocelyn's gun after she shoots another passenger, but she is startled when Mrs Wingsworth enters the room, allowing Archibald to take the gun. Dashiel shoots at Martha, but she shields herself with the canap√© tray, which reflects the shot at Jocelyn and kills her. Martha runs back to the engine room door, pursued by Archibald. She hits him with the tray, but she dies when he stabs her. On emerging from the scrambled egg membrane, the Doctor is met by Gabriel, who tells him that Martha has gone to the cocktail lounge. The Doctor learns that three hours have passed since Martha's arrival, as time passes more slowly in the engine rooms. He meets Jocelyn and Archibald, who disintegrate Gabriel again. The Doctor leads them to the engine room door, deducing that they intend to steal the ship's drive. However, they cannot pass through the scrambled egg membrane, as it is impossible to move from a region of faster time to one of slower time. Jocelyn blocks off the corridor by activating the fire doors, then escorts the Doctor to Dashiel in the cocktail lounge. Mrs Wingsworth antagonises the badgers and is once again disintegrated. While the Doctor attempts to negotiate, Archibald offers him some of the canap√©s, which continue to be replenished. Mrs Wingsworth enters the cocktail lounge again, explaining that the passengers are brought back to life after they die. However, Archibald mentions that Martha did not come back to life after she was killed. The Doctor resolves to find Martha's body and return it to her family once he has resolved the issues on the starship. Dashiel attacks the Doctor after he is tricked into disabling the guns using the sonic screwdriver, but runs into the window and is knocked unconscious. The Doctor takes his dagger and heads to the bridge with Mrs Wingsworth and Archibald, leaving Jocelyn to tend to Dashiel. They reach the capsule in which the badgers arrived, where Archibald mentions that Jocelyn died and woke up again there. The Doctor realises that everyone is resurrected where they first appeared and goes to open the fire doors in the engine room corridor, where he finds that both Martha and Gabriel have been resurrected. He explains that they are in a time loop, and the ship is attempting to protect the passengers by resurrecting them and replenishing the food, using its drive to alter reality. However, this is draining the ship's energy, as the loop is incomplete. Gabriel leads them to the bridge, where the door is blocked by another scrambled egg membrane. The Doctor and Martha pass through it, and are immediately killed by an electrical barrier. They are promptly resurrected and the Doctor convinces the captain, Georgina Wet-Eleven, to let them pass. Observing the pirate vessel on the wall screens, the Doctor realises that it has been frozen in time by the starship's drive, preventing the other pirate capsules from reaching them. The three badgers then invade the bridge and attack the crew, with everyone other than the Doctor and Martha being killed. The Doctor alters the electrical barrier so that it separates the resurrected crew and badgers. He lets the badgers out after they promise to behave, but the crew initially refuse to co-operate. Archibald offers Captain Georgina some canap√©s, and she reluctantly agrees to a truce. The Doctor uses the transmat booth to travel back to the engine room so that they can escape from the time loop, connecting the ship's drive to the TARDIS and using it to warp space-time. Meanwhile, the pirate ship has unfrozen and the scrambled egg membrane has disappeared. The badgers attempt to negotiate with their comrades, but they are unsuccessful. The other badger pirates board the ship, capture Martha, and shoot Dashiel and Captain Georgina. Archibald, Jocelyn and Martha are taken to Captain Florence on the pirate ship. On emerging from the TARDIS, the Doctor finds that the pirates have attacked and stolen the ship's drive. He leaves a note for Gabriel and is found by Mrs Wingsworth, who tells him that people have stopped coming back to life. They travel to the pirate ship in the TARDIS and take the lift to the bridge. The pirate ship destroys the Brilliant on Captain Florence's orders as they arrive, and she shoots Mrs Wingsworth and Archibald. The Doctor duels with her using the dagger he had taken from Dashiel, and she accidentally stabs herself. She refuses the Doctor's offer of help and shoots him. The badgers try to shoot Martha and Jocelyn, but find that their guns have been disabled. The Brilliant reforms and everyone who died is brought back to life. The Doctor explains that the ship drained the power from their guns because the note he left for Gabriel told him that the guns were a danger to the passengers. Instead of breaking them out of the time loop, he completed it and extended it to include the pirate ship. Reality is now only adjusted once every cycle and the loop has become self-sustaining, so the ship no longer needs to expend energy. The Doctor invites the badgers to a party on the Brilliant, and Martha, Jocelyn and the resurrected Captain Florence join the other badgers as they head for the capsules. The crew, passengers, mechanics, robots and badgers all party together on the starship. The Doctor announces that he will leave in the TARDIS, and that going with him will be their last chance to leave the never- ending party and return to the real world. The party-goers make their decisions as they dance to Mika's song Grace Kelly. Audiobook An abridged audiobook was released in July 2008. It is read by Freema Agyeman, who plays Martha Jones in the TV series.

Stems 1‚Äì4 cm long, often branched, sans hyaloderm. Basal cells of persistent axillary hairs numerous, strongly reddened. Leaves erect, linear to ligulate-lingulate, never squarrose-recurved, somewhat contorted when dry, smaller at base of stem than larger above, ¬æ‚Äì4¬Ω mm long; margins entire, revolute (i.e., strongly recurved); costa strong, broad (‚Öì to ‚Öî width of leaf base), ends near leaf apex; apex blunt, obtuse to rounded. Seta very long (1¬Ω‚Äì10 cm). Capsule pyriform, asymmetrical, curved, up to 4 mm long including neck; neck long, often wrinkled when dry; endostome of 16 segments open on the keel, sometimes with evidence of cilia; outer peristome shorter than the inner. Spores finely papillose.  Distribution, habitat, and ecology  This species has a bipolar distribution, meaning that it exists in both hemispheres. In the Northern hemisphere, it is circumboreal, being found in Greenland, Canada, the northern United States, the Baltic, Russia, and Mongolia. It is also known from South America and nearby places in Antarctica. This moss lives in fens, peaty soil banks, seeps, meadows, and rock fissures upon exposed, damp organic soil within upper montane to subalpine coniferous forest. More specifically, it prefers to live upon calcareous substrates, usually in alpine or arctic regions, but occurring also in rich fens at lower elevations. Its elevational range is from 3,950 ft. to 8,550 ft. The fire ecology of this plant is not known; however, fens rarely burn. Excess soot from a nearby fire, however, might negatively affect habitat quality. Fire return intervals in conifer bogs, a somewhat similar mire-type habitat, are estimated to be about once every 150‚Äì200 years. Fire does significant damage to peat, but the bog must be dry (as during a drought year) in order to burn; typically, bogs are not dry enough.  Conservation status and threats  U.S. Forest Service Pacific Southwest Region Sensitive Species. California Native Plant Society List 2.2 NatureServe California State Rank: S2.2; Global Rank: G4 Fens are delicate habitats susceptible to impacts from livestock grazing, hydrologic alteration, construction and continued use of roads, and peat mining. Rich fen habitats are especially susceptible to modification. The surface water chemistry of rich fens is sensitive to climatic and anthropogenic influences.  Field identification  Meesia uliginosa may be distinguished from M. triquetra by its lack of tristichous growth habit, relatively wide costa, entire and revolute leaf margins, blunt leaf apex, and autoicous sexual condition.

She also studied at University College London, training to be a librarian. She worked for the British Council in Bangkok, Thailand, in this role from 1973 to 1974. Career Active in socialist and feminist politics (the Women's Liberation Movement) since the early 1970s, she formed a writers' collective with Sara Maitland, Michelene Wandor and Zoe Fairbairns. At this time Roberts was the Poetry Editor (1975‚Äì77) at Spare Rib, the feminist magazine, and later at City Limits (1981‚Äì83). Her first novel, A Piece of the Night, was published in 1978.

Roberts also self-analyzes the effects of her Anglo-French family‚Äôs Catholicism ('the nun in my head, that monstrous Mother Superior'), which have remained a fertile source, even as she reacted against its overt doctrines. Her exploration of London, the various areas and houses that she lived in, went alongside her development as a writer.

British Council, Literature, 2008. In her 2020 work, Negative Capability: A Diary of Surviving, Roberts documents a period of crisis following the rejection of a novel she was writing by her publisher and agent.

The Eye rises at Bescaby, about six miles (10 km) north-east of Melton Mowbray. It flows east towards Saltby, where it turns south and flows past Sproxton, Coston and Garthorpe. At Saxby it turns west and flows by Stapleford, Freeby, Wyfordby, Brentingby and Thorpe Arnold. At Swan's Nest it enters Melton Mowbray, where it flows under bridges at Burton Road and Leicester Road. It then passes Sysonby, where, at Sysonby Lodge it changes its name to the River Wreake, which flows into the River Soar. Its full journey is about 13 miles (21 km). Overview The Eye near Coston. The river is neither wide nor fast flowing, although it does flood periodically. It drifts through the gentle rolling countryside of north-east Leicestershire by fields bounded by hawthorn hedges. There is very little woodland in the area; what's there is largely man-made in the form of fox coverts. Farming in the district is largely pastoral, with the grassland given over to sheep and cows, the traditional beasts of local agriculture. Stilton and Red Leicester cheeses originally came from the village and farm dairies in the Eye basin. History The name Eye comes from the Old English ƒìa, meaning \\"the river\\".Cox, B. A Dictionary of Placenames of Leicestershire and Rutland, Nottingham, 2005. It probably had an older, pre-historic name that has now been lost. However, Wreake is Danish in origin, meaning the twisting or meandering one. =Iron Age remains= The river has been the centre of human activity for many centuries. To its north-east, at Saltby Heath, are King Lud's Entrenchments, which may date from prehistoric times, although historians debate this. It may be significant that the Entrenchments lie just inside the county boundary with Lincolnshire, which may have been a territorial frontier. The county boundary follows the watershed between the River Eye and River Witham, and is marked by the ancient routeway from south- east England to the north, known as Sewstern Lane or The Drift. About six miles south of the river at Melton Mowbray lie the impressive remains of an Iron Age hill fort at Burrough Hill. It is suggested that this may have been the tribal centre for the Corieltauvi people who lived in the East Midland counties of Leicester, Lincoln, Nottingham and Rutland. There is a presumed prehistoric trackway from Burrough Hill northward towards Melton Mowbray, where it crosses the River Eye and heads north towards the Vale of Belvoir. In Roman times the tribal centre was moved to Leicester, which the Romans named Ratis (or Ratae) Corieltauvorum. =Danish and Saxon villages= Nine of the villages bordering the river have Danish names. The rest are Saxon. It is likely that these incomers used the river to reach their new homes. All these villages are likely to have been sited on dry ground close to a good source of water. The River Eye provided this source. Stapleford means 'the ford (over the River Eye) marked by posts'Cox, B. 2005. and indicates that the lanes around the Eye were in use twelve hundred years or so ago. Melton Mowbray appears to have become the Eye basin's trading centre in Saxon times. Its market probably pre-dates the Norman conquest and is one of the few in England listed in the Domesday Book (1085). Melton continued as the main trading centre in the area throughout medieval times, up to the present day. =Nineteenth century= The Eye valley was used by the Oakham Canal when it was built early in the nineteenth century. The stretch of the river from Stapleford to Sysonby (about six miles, 10 km) was canalised. There are a few sparse remains of the canal, although the river has largely reverted to its natural state. In 1844 the Midland Railway built the Syston and Peterborough Railway alongside the canal. It had to buy out the canal company as part of the agreement to build the railway. The Midland Railway allowed the canal to fall into disrepair because it was the major competitor to its new route. The river today Today, the River Eye is a relatively unknown part of the English landscape. Like many rivers it has a long history, much of it unwritten. It is still vital as a water source and drainage route and has a leisure focus for fishermen and those who walk the rights of way that criss- cross its route. The Eye has given its name to the UK's first community radio station 103 The Eye which has been broadcasting to Melton Mowbray and Vale of Belvoir since 2005.

Players complete space combat missions using preselected starfighters equipped with various weapons. The game features multiple paths of missions and outcomes, depending on the player's performance. It was followed by Colony Wars: Vengeance in 1998, and Colony Wars: Red Sun in 2000.  Gameplay  Players fight in numerous space combat missions using one of seven pre-selected League of Free Worlds starfighters (although in one mission, the player gets to use one captured Navy fighter). The selection is due to the League High Command's decisions for efficiency in every given mission. Each starfighter carries a certain combination of energy weapons, missiles or torpedoes, and a number of units are equipped with nonlethal EMP cannons. The player can also use countermeasures to shake off inbound enemy missiles and/or use a grapple gun to capture targets of importance. The stages are divided into several \\"Acts\\" with three missions each. Multiple paths and outcomes are available throughout the game, depending on the player's performance. Completing or failing missions does not always define the ultimate success or failure of the campaign, and certain missions are vital turning points which can dramatically affect the game's plot. Players can view their combat records in the game. They can also access a database of planets and ships, with full voiceovers.  Story  The Solar system is fully stripped of its natural resources by the fifth millennium. As a result, the Earth Empire sends out expeditionary sleeper ships to distant planets found to have abundant natural resources and harvests them. The discovery of hyperspace technology accelerates the Empire's interstellar expansion. As the colonies become more prosperous, the inhabitants become discontent as most of their mined resources are used to benefit Earth. A peaceful insurrection in the 47th century results in the Earth Empire's leader, the Tzar, personally leading the destruction of a rebellious planet. Stunned by the carnage, the other colonies band together as the League of Free Worlds, with a man known as the Father leading the fight. The Empire's Colonial Navy sends a fleet to attack League forces in the Gallonigher system, but the League executes hit-and-run strikes as they fall back to the main capital planet, Bennay. When the Navy overextends its forces for the assault on Bennay, the League lures them into a trap inside a nearby asteroid belt, where the Navy strike fleet is destroyed. The game picks up several months after the Battle of Bennay, when the player character signs up for combat duty with the League as it fully mobilizes for war. The player's first missions are set in the League's home star system of Gallonigher, where the League forces are fending off against the Navy's raid attacks. If the player is successful on Gallonigher, the League manages to capture Gallonigher's battle platform, which upholds the warphole in between Draco and Gallonigher systems and successfully close it without wasting too much resources or forces while doing so. This offers them an opportunity to launch a surprise counterattack into Draco system, by using the same captured Gallonigher battle platform to open a warphole into the Draco system. If the player is defeated on Gallonigher, with the failure to secure the Gallonigher battle platform, the League struggles defending the Gallonigher and takes so long time to secure the system, that the Navy has enough time to regroup its forces and leave the system to look elsewhere for its spoils. Their new target will be Diomedes system. The League is forced to split its struggling forces to prevent Navy from conquering Diomedes, which holds a great importance to the League, as it is one of the League's most loyal ally and a critical source of resources. If the player loses any Act on Diomedes, the Earth Empire wins the war as the Navy manages to conquer Diomedes and eliminate last pockets of its resistance, before launching a full-scale invasion on Gallonigher. While the remains of the League are attempting to make a one last desperate escape from the Diomedes system back to Gallonigher, a warphole appears behind them from where the Tzar's personal Super Titan flagship \\"Tsunami\\" appears and wipes away the League's retreating forces bringing end to an The League of Free Worlds and its rebellion. If the player is successful on Diomedes, the League manages to fend off Navy's attacks, but is left badly damaged and demoralized. As a result, they decide to launch a counterattack on the Alpha Centauri system, where a civil war is raging in between League supporters and Earth Empire loyalists. It is also possible to be sent to Alpha Centauri by being defeated on Draco system. Instead of fighting against the Navy here (or at least most of the time), the League ends up fighting against the group known as \\"The Faction,\\" which is a group formed by the former League participants who have grown discontent to the League and The Father and have decided to make an attempt to seize the entire control of the League to themselves. The Faction is fully supported by the Earth Empire. If the player is successful on Alpha Centauri, the Earth Empire and the League forge a peace as they reach a tactical stalemate after the Faction is defeated. The Earth Empire could never concentrate its forces enough to finish the League off without invoking more similar rebellions on the systems where Empire's forces would leave, while the League could never truly defeat the Earth Empire by their meager resources. As a result: The League gains independence from the Earth Empire, but agrees to support the Earth Empire and the preservation of the Sol system as a tribute to its status as the mankind's birthplace. If the player is defeated on Alpha Centauri, The Faction manages to seize the control of the League and makes peace with the Earth Empire by making a deal: In return for a chance to return to the League's home colonies and there declare a victory over the Earth Empire, The Faction would ensure that the old life of oppression and theft could continue unchecked and that the Earth Empire would gain all the resources it needs, until the colonies will have nothing left to give. The Faction executes most of the League participants, but a handful of them manage to escape. If the player is defeated on Draco, the League has failed in its attempt to conquer the Draco which leaves them in serious trouble's. They are forced to flee from the Draco into the Alpha Centauri. If the player is successful on Draco, the League has managed to conquer the Draco system from the Earth Empire. Due to Draco system's location which is near the Sol system, this gives League an opportunity to launch attack on Sol system which is the home of the Tzar and his Earth Empire. If player is defeated on Sol, it results to a canonical ending, in which the League is forced to retreat from Sol, but they manage to seal the Sol warp hole as they leave by destroying the Sol battle platform thus sealing the Sol system warphole which effectively imprisons the Earth Empire in the Sol system. Shortly afterwards: A civil war breaks out through out the Sol system and the Earth Empire collapses. This sets up the plot for Colony Wars: Vengeance, a sequel set 20‚Äì30 years later. If the player is successful on Sol, the League wins the war as following the destruction of the Tzar's personal Super Titan, the Earth Empire unconditionally surrenders and the Tzar is declared \\"gone and vanished.\\" With the Earth Empire defeated, the people of Sol are no longer limited to leave the Sol, they leave the system and migrates into the other colonized worlds on other star systems. Earth Empire's fall also results to the independence of all the colonized star systems and their worlds. If the player gets this ending without failing any act or mission during the entire campaign, there will be an additional scene: A disc-shaped spaceship, flying above an unknown sun. Development In the original design, players could choose to fight for either the League or the Earth Empire. The development team decided to scrap this option in order to provide a larger mission base for the game. Recognizing that in other games with branching paths based around mission success or failure, players tended to simply retry a mission whenever they failed, the team attempted to conceal mission failure by having the mission-tree move the player on to the next branch without making a point of their defeat. According to Psygnosis product marketing manager Mark Day, Colony Wars and G-Police were \\"neck and neck\\" as far as getting the biggest financial push from the company. The in-game soundtrack was written and produced by Tim Wright, who also composed music for the Wipeout series of games released by Psygnosis.  Reception  Colony Wars received critical acclaim. Reviewers lauded the game's graphics, mission branching system, controls (particularly with analog joypads), selection of weapons and craft, and the way the game achieved a feeling of actually being present in an epic space battle. IGN elaborated that \\"The game has an incredible sense of scale and space ... One minute you're flying your small attack fighter through a formation of giant (and I mean h-u-g-e) space cruisers, desperately trying to avoid the massive laser beams they're firing at you, and the next you're flying like a madman in the midst of a swarm of tiny enemy attack fighters trying to destroy them before they send you floating home in pieces.\\" Electronic Gaming Monthly gave it their \\"Game of the Month\\" award, with Crispin Boyer calling it \\"a breathtaking epic\\" and Kraig Kujawa \\"top-notch in just about every way possible.\\" Boyer also made Colony Wars his pick for \\"Sleeper Hit of the Holidays\\" several months before EGM reviewed the game. GamePro gave it a 4.5 out of 5 in control and sound and a perfect 5.0 in graphics and fun factor, saying it \\"easily ranks as the best space-combat game on the PlayStation.\\" Edge praised the game's graphics and presentation values, but criticized its superficial gameplay, stating that the game \\"proves little more than a 3D interpretation of Asteroids.\\" GameSpot took the reverse position, saying that the storyline and general mission presentation are bland, but that the gameplay excels due to the intense situations which arise during combat. Next Generation stated, \\"A technological marvel, Colony Wars seems to redefine what is possible on PlayStation. The special effects used throughout are both eye-popping and superior to just about anything that has come before on any platform. Simply put, this game is not to be missed.\\" EGMs Shawn Smith went so far as to say that the graphics were the best of any PlayStation game to date.  Sequels  Colony Wars was the first title in a series that included two sequels: Vengeance (1998) and Red Sun (2000). In 2010, UGO listed the series among its top ten most deserving of sequels.25 Games That Need Sequels , UGO.com, November 23, 2010 Star Trek: Invasion (2000) is a similar space combat simulator for the PlayStation developed by many of the same people that worked on the Colony Wars series.

In the film, she was played by actress Terry Moore; and in the TV series, she was portrayed by actress Barbara Parkins; in the short-lived daytime soap opera, she was played by actress Julie Parrish and later Lynn Loring. In a later TV movie, Murder in Peyton Place, Janet Margolin performed the role of Betty. Peyton Place =Novel= Betty is the daughter of millworker John and Berit Anderson, and lived in the small community of Peyton Place. She is known for her less than moral behavior, and used her sexuality for power over men. In the book, she was described as \\"having not only the morals but the claws of an alley cat\\". She had a crush on Rodney Harrington, the son of mill owner, Leslie Harrington. Betty and Rodney had gone on a drive to a nearby lake, and then it was discovered that she was pregnant; some time later, Rodney had died in a car accident. She eventually had a son named Roddy, whom she adored. For some time, (in the second book, Return to Peyton Place) she lived in New York, where she worked as a waitress; then after Roddy was born, she returned to Peyton Place, with a former neighbor in New York, Agnes Carlisle, who often watched Roddy. The family eventually moved to a house on Laurel Street, and they lived as well as they could. For a planned but never written third book of Peyton Place, author Grace Metalious considered depicting Betty as the mother of Rodney, Jr., as well as her relationship with her father-in-law. Furthermore, she was supposed to fall in love with a Swede named Karl Gustafson. =Film= Terry Moore (left) as Betty Anderson There were only a few differences from Betty's portrayal in the 1956 novel and the 1957 film. In the film, set in the early 1940s, she is the school's most popular girl who is involved with Rodney. Quiet girl Allison MacKenzie looks up to her, but at the same time falls in love with her boyfriend Rodney. She is invited to Allison's birthday party, where she pours alcohol in the drinks, dims all the lights, and starts heavily making out with Rodney. This enrages Allison's mother Constance, who disapproves of Betty and sends her away. Sometime later, Betty's father starts to demand that she marry Rodney. Rodney's wealthy father Leslie, though, disapproves of Betty because of her middle-class background, and pressures Rodney into taking someone else to the school prom; Allison. At the prom, Rodney dumps Allison to make out with Betty in her car. Just as they are about to have sex, Betty dumps him for not having asked her to the prom. During the summer, Rodney convinces her to give him another chance, and they go skinny dipping at a nearby lake, where they are spotted by a local gossip. Soon after, they elope, which greatly upsets Rodney's family. He leaves Betty behind to join the army, and after a while, she receives notice that he has died. This devastating news allows Betty to make peace with Rodney's father, who until then had never spoken a positive word about her. =Soap= Season 1 In the TV series, Betty was more prominent. She was the daughter of Julie Anderson and George Anderson. Growing up, Betty dealt with the unstable marriage of her parents; her father was an abusive alcoholic. She was in love with Rodney Harrington, who was her boyfriend from an upper-class family that disapproved of her. Life seemed to be fortunate, although she felt the competition between her and Allison MacKenzie, whom Rodney also felt attracted to. Their relationship is furthermore endangered by her mother Julie's affair with Rodney's father Leslie Harrington, which Rodney found difficult to deal with, as did Betty, who despised her mother when finding out. After they had already broken up, Betty found out through Michael Rossi that she was pregnant of Rodney.Peyton Place, episode 8 (season 1, episode 8). Aired on October 8, 1964. Instead of coming clean in hope for support, Betty refused to confide this in anyone but Michael and her mother. She was afraid too tell Rodney about her pregnancy, because she feared that he would think that she would be trapping him into a relationship.Peyton Place, episode 10 (season 1, episode 10). Aired on October 15, 1964. Soon after, she told Rodney the truth about her pregnancy, and Rodney, shocked, accidentally caused a car accident, during which Betty suffered a miscarriage.Peyton Place, episode 11 (season 1, episode 11). Aired on October 20, 1964. Fearing to lose Rodney, she pretended she was still pregnant to trick him into marrying her. They rushed into a marriage, which angered both the Harrington and Anderson family. Betty felt guilty about lying to Rodney about her fake pregnancy, but George assured her that she was doing it for the best.Peyton Place, episode 16 (season 1, episode 16). Aired on November 10, 1964. She is taken into the Harrington house, where she has trouble to become accepted by the family. Leslie asked Dr. Robert Morton to check up on her, and he found out about the miscarriage. He confronted Betty with this, which pressured her into telling the truth to Rodney.Peyton Place, episode 19 (season 1, episode 19). Aired on November 19, 1964. They got into a major fight, which led Betty to wanting to leave town for Boston.Peyton Place, episode 20 (season 1, episode 20). Aired on November 24, 1964. Instead, she stayed to save her marriage, despite Leslie's attempts to convince Rodney to divorce her. It did not work, though, and after she realized that they were no longer in love with each other, she left town for New York without informing anyone.Peyton Place, episode 31 (season 1, episode 31). Aired on December 31, 1964. Meanwhile, her parents broke up, for which Betty blamed her mother. In New York, she befriended Sharon Purcell, a wild party girl with a scandalous past. Sharon pressured Betty into going out with a married man, Roy Roberts. Betty was reluctant to do so, and freaked out when he forced himself upon her.Peyton Place, episode 40 (season 1, episode 40). Aired on February 2, 1965. After she was informed that her father was taken into a sanatorium, Betty returned to Peyton Place and granted Rodney an annulment on condition that Leslie paid George's medical bills.Peyton Place, episode 43 (season 1, episode 43). Aired on February 11, 1965. Drama quickly continued as Betty found out that Leslie had hired a private investigator to spy on her in New York. The contents of the report was a major story throughout the entire show, with conflicts of its reliability as the main issue. To progress the annulment, Betty was allowed a job as a nurse at the Peyton Place hospital, though she immediately got into conflict with head nurse Choate. Miss Choate felt that Betty was not fit as a nurse due to her personal problems, but Betty was hired nevertheless, and Choate's attempts to scare her away proved unsuccessful. Meanwhile, her father returned home from the sanitarium, but Betty's delightment was short lived, because George turned out to have lost his mind and - after an almost fatal confrontation with Martin Peyton and shoot-out with Elliot Carson - he was sent away forever. Despite her father's crime, she believed that he was manipulated by someone and blamed school teacher Paul Hanley.Peyton Place, episode 63 (season 1, episode 63). Aired on April 20, 1965. Some stability came back in her life when she met Reverend Jerry Bedford, with whom she became romantically involved. Almost simultaneously, she fell in love with lawyer Steven Cord. Even though Julie wanted her daughter to go out with Jerry, Betty eventually choose Steven to date.Peyton Place, episode 95 (season 1, episode 95). Aired on July 27, 1965. Season 2 Quickly, Steven grew jealous of Betty's connection to Rodney. The latter called Betty at the hospital when he accidentally killed Joe Chernak, creating a bond between the two while he went on trial. Steven grew suspicious of an affair, as Betty fought hard to prove Rodney's innocence, which led in turn to a great conflict with Joe's sister Stella Chernak (when Michael started dating Stella, Betty made sure that he knew about her thoughts of Stella).Peyton Place, episode 134 (season 2, episode 20). Aired on October 28, 1965. She even broke into hospital paper files to find any sort of information which could help Rodney, though she was caught by Miss Choate and got fired.Peyton Place, episode 150 (season 2, episode 36). Aired on December 2, 1965. Hereafter, she spent her time getting to meet Steven's mother Hannah Cord and Martin Peyton. Peyton immediately liked Betty for her outspokenness and was thankful to her for her attempts to help his grandson Rodney. Betty accepted his job offer as his personal assistant, thereby endangering Hannah's position as his maid. Hannah immediately disliked Betty because of this, and they never made up. Meanwhile, Rodney's trial was still ongoing and Betty was called to testify, because Sgt.

Return to Peyton Place The character Betty appeared in Return to Peyton Place, the follow-up novel to Peyton Place, but not in its 1961 film adaptation. However, she did appear in the daytime soap opera which aired from 1972 to 1974. In this version, she was married to Rodney Harrington, but they soon estranged from each other. Rodney fell in love with Allison MacKenzie, while Betty started an affair with Steven Cord. She was aware that Martin Peyton was still alive, and agreed on keeping it a secret from the other townspeople. In this soap opera, Betty was the mother of Steven's son Peyton, but, in mid-1973, she refused to let him see him. In late 1973, Betty and Steven planned on marrying each other, but their relationship was constantly put on the test by D. B. Bentley, a wealthy heiress who seduced Steven for business information. Betty gave Steven an ultimatum: choose between her and D. B. Steven initially followed D. B.'s advice not to rush into a wedding with Betty, but he later regrets the decision. The series ends with Betty, now divorced from Rodney, planning on marrying Steven in the Caribbean. When Martin Peyton finds out about this, he announces he will return to town to prevent this from happening. The soap opera was cancelled before this plot was finished, leaving it unknown to the viewer whether Betty and Steven married. TV movies =Murder in Peyton Place= In the first TV movie, Murder in Peyton Place (1977), Betty was married to a man named David Roerick, with whom she lived in another city. She was unfaithful to her husband, secretly arranging a meeting with Rodney in Peyton Place. She was supposed to meet Rodney near the town, and witnessed the car he was driving getting into a crash and explosion. Panicked, she called the police, but did not give her identity. Back in Peyton Place, she moved in with her friend Denise Haley. Denise's husband Stan was suspicious of Betty, and felt that she was keeping secrets. Constance MacKenzie was not glad with her arrival in town, and feared that she was going to seduce Rodney, who by then was in a relationship with her daughter Allison MacKenzie. When it turned out that Rodney and Allison died in the car crash, Betty extended her stay in Peyton Place, which worried her husband David. Along with a group of old friends, including Norman Harrington and Steven Cord, Betty suspected that the couple was murdered. They started their own investigation, during which Betty spent a lot of time with Steven. This worried his wife Carla, who suspected that Steven was having an affair with Betty. Betty's investigation was cut short when David asked her to move back in with him, after which she left town. =Peyton Place: The Next Generation= During the second reunion movie, Peyton Place: The Next Generation (1985), Betty was engaged to a man named Dorian Blake, and had a teenage son, Dana, from her marriage with Rodney Harrington. Together with Dorian, she lived in the mansion once owned by Martin Peyton, which she inherited through her son's family connection to Peyton, Dana's great grandfather. A condition of owning the mansion was coping with Peyton's faithful housekeeper Hannah Cord, who Betty greatly disliked. She is now fully occupied with raising her rebellious son, who to her regret, has issues with Dorian. During a visit to Dr. Michael Rossi, it is revealed that Dana was conceived through a one-night stand with Steven during her marriage to Rodney. She had kept the identity of Dana's father a secret to assure her son of one day inheriting Peyton's estate, which would not happen if it turned out that Dana was not related to Peyton. Michael pressures her to tell this to Dana and Steven, but Betty is too afraid. One evening, she overhears Dorian calling to the hospital to find out more about Megan MacKenzie, a young woman who was hit by a car earlier that evening. Dorian admits that he hit Megan and also raped Allison - who was recently strangled to death - twenty years earlier. Scared, Betty tries to get away, and runs into the woods near the mansion. Dorian follows her, and although she tries to escape, she is caught. Dorian attempts to push her off a cliff, but she is saved by Steven, who fights with Dorian before pushing him off the same cliff, which kills him instantly. After having processed the shock, Betty reveals to Steven and Dana that they are father and son. Steven is initially angry at Betty for having lied about this, but later forgives her, as does Dana. Production In February 1957, it was announced actress Terry Moore was campaigning for the role in the first film adaptation.Lowell Sun, February 21, 1957, p. 43 She was cast a month later. In the TV series, the character was supposed to be killed during a car accident in the 11th episode. However, the character's portrayer, Barbara Parkins, proved to be so successful, that she stayed on the show for its entire run. In a late 1965 interview, the actress said about her role: :\\"I'm lucky in the role I have. Mine was the big story when the series started off. I haven't had much to do lately, but when I do have scenes, they are important to the plot, You might say I'm the salt and pepper in the stew.\\"\\"Actress Barbara Parkins Once Ushered at Movies\\" by Bob Thomas, Nashua Telegraph, December 22, 1965, p. 9 Parkins was the only female star to remain with the series through its entire run (1964‚Äì1969). In 1966, she was nominated for an Emmy Award as Best Actress in a Lead Role in a Dramatic Series, but lost to Barbara Stanwyck for The Big Valley. About losing the award, on her 22nd birthday, Parkins told the press: :\\"I was hurt, but if I had to lose I was glad it was to Barbara Stanwyck, who is a grand lady and fine actress. I would have hated to lose to Anne Francis. I don't care much for her work. A woman should be feminine and not go around hitting people with judo chops the way she does in that Honey West show.\\"\\"No. 1 Girl in 'Peyton Place'\\" by Hal Humphrey, The Oakland Tribune, June 5, 1966, p. 26-EN Eventually shedding her \\"other side of the tracks\\" image, Betty endured many of the trials and tribulations of soap opera life. The character achieved such popularity that when the show ended its run, producer Paul Monash developed a spin-off series, The Girl from Peyton Place, for Parkins. However, when co-star Ryan O'Neal, who played her husband, declined to participate, the project was shelved. Nevertheless, Parkins insisted she often felt very insecure on the set, saying :\\"Sometimes I think I hold myself in too tightly. I would watch Lee Grant do those wild things when she played Stella Chernak and think I should try something like that, but when I did I was pathetic. I'm very critical of what I see of myself, but I did get an Emmy nomination, didn't I?.\\" In the first reunion film, Parkins was approached to reprise her role, but she declined.\\"Peyton Place reunion ‚Äî for murder\\" by Jerry Buck, Lowell Sun, October 2, 1977, p. 7 Janet Margolin was assigned as her replacement.

History The team was formed in 1928 by Manchester City Director, John Ayrton and the owner of Belle Vue, John Iles. Ayrton created Manchester Central because he felt East Manchester needed a League side. City had moved out of the area in 1923, but had initially considered moving to Belle Vue. The club played at the Belle Vue Athletics stadium, more commonly known as the Speedway Stadium. One of the coaches was Billy Meredith, the Welsh international and former Manchester City and Manchester United player. Their manager was James McMahon. Players meeting Chairman before 1st practice match at Belle Vue in 1928 The club joined the Lancashire Combination in its first year finishing seventh in the twenty team competition. This led to an immediate application to join the Football League for the 1929‚Äì30 season; this bid failed. The 1929‚Äì30 season, the club finished as runners up in the Combination and the reserves played in the Cheshire County League, the only other reserve teams in that league being from Football League clubs. After a successful season another application for League status was made and failed again. The 1930‚Äì31 season was less successful finishing seventh in the Combination and the reserves bottom. A further application for League status failed with Chester gaining membership. This led to withdrawal from the Combination and focus solely on the Cheshire County League. After Wigan Borough had to resign from the Football League in October 1931, Central applied to take their place. This was initially accepted by the leaders of Division Three (North), but a formal complaint was made jointly by First Division Manchester City and Second Division Manchester United. They believed that a third Manchester side would seriously damage Manchester United, who were struggling for support and finance. The Football League backed the existing Manchester League sides and Central were denied. The Manchester clubs, in particular United, received significantly bad media coverage as a result and this act damaged their image and support further. At the end of the season Central resigned from the Cheshire County League and became defunct, realising their ambitions would be unfulfilled. Central were an ambitious side and attracted many significant crowds, such as 8,500 for the visit of Wrexham during 1929‚Äì30. They also signed international players, such as Welsh international Bert Gray. In 2015, Manchester Central F.C was re-established as an amateur sports Club that is based out of Manchester, England. It was previously formed in 1928 rivalling Man United & Man City. Common myths It is widely believed that Manchester Central was considered as a new name for Newton Heath F.C. prior to them becoming Manchester United in 1902, but there is no factual evidence from the period to suggest this is true ‚Äì all comments come from later histories, while detailed records and media reports from the period make no reference whatsoever to this idea. In fact it seems highly improbable as Manchester Central was already the name of another soccer side competing in the Manchester region during the 1890s. This first Manchester Central played at Alexandra Park and ceased to exist around the turn of the century. The directors of Newton Heath would not have selected that name for fear of confusion. The name Manchester Central was considered as a name for F.C. United of Manchester.

It became very popular in the West beginning in the later 1990s and became one of the most popularly given girls' names in the Western world during the 2010s. Popularity The name was comparatively common in continental Europe in the medieval and early modern period. It was popularized in Britain by the German House of Hanover in the 18th century. It was repeatedly popularised among the wider population, by the name of a character in the novel Tom Jones (1794) by Henry Fielding, in The Vicar of Wakefield (1766) by Oliver Goldsmith, and in the 1960s by Italian actress Sophia Loren (b. 1934). Sophia was comparatively popular in the United States in the late 19th and early 20th century; its use declined in the 1920s to 1950s; it became again moderately popular during the 1960s to 1980s. During the 1990s to 2010s the popularity of the name rose dramatically in many countries throughout the western world. Suggested influences for this trend include Sof√≠a Vergara and Sofia Coppola (popular from the late 1990s) and Sofia Hellqvist (popular from the 2000s).Olivia Petter, This is the most popular girl's name in the world, 25 October 2017.

The spelling Soffia is Icelandic and Welsh. Hungarian has Zs√≥fia. Modern Spanish uses the acute diacritic, Sof√≠a. South and East Slavic and Baltic languages have Sofija (–°–æ—Ñ–∏—ò–∞), Sofiya (–°–æ—Ñ–∏—è) and Sofya (–°–æ—Ñ—å—è). West Slavic (Polish and Czech-Slovak) introduced a voiced sibilant, Zofia, ≈Ωofia, ≈Ωofie. French has the (disyllabic) hypocoristic Sophie, which was also introduced in German, Dutch/Flemish, English and Scandinavian in the spelling Sofie. A Dutch hypocoristic is Sofieke. Russian has the hypocoristic –°–æ–Ω—è (Sonya), which in the late 19th century was introduced to Western languages, in the spellings Sonya, Sonia and Sonja, via characters with this name in the novels Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoyevsky (1866, English translation 1885) and War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy (1869, English translation 1886).

After her husband's death in an accident at a WWF event, Hart sued the World Wrestling Federation. She later wrote a bestselling book about her husband's life and founded a charity in his name. She has subsequently been involved in several legal cases involving her husband's image and has worked as a philanthropist and researcher. Personal life Hart was born Martha Joan Patterson on October 31, 1966, the youngest of 11 children. Her mother, Joan, battled breast cancer before Hart and her sister Virginia were born; her father left her mother when Martha was young. She completed two degrees at the University of Calgary in Psychology (with distinction) and Sociology (1st- class honours) before moving to England to complete a master's degree and a PhD in Social and Development Psychology at Cambridge University. She has since worked as a university researcher in the area of pediatrics. She met her husband, Owen Hart, in 1982 at the age of 15, while they were both still in high school. She attended a Stampede Wrestling event with a friend, and met Owen after recognizing him as one of the wrestlers who attended her school for a wrestling practice. They married on July 1, 1989, and had two children together: Oje Edward Hart (born March 5, 1992) and Athena Christie Hart (born September 23, 1995). Owen died while performing a stunt on May 23, 1999, at the World Wrestling Federation (WWF)'s Over the Edge pay-per-view. As a result of the charitable contributions achieved through the Owen Hart Foundation, Martha was named Individual Philanthropist of the Year in 2004 by the AFP. She was Calgary's 2011 Champions of Learning. Hart was named the 2017 Goodwill Ambassador for the Monaco International Film Festival. Hart has had a long standing relationship with this non-profit international special interest film festival and is also the Monaco International Film Festival's Vice President of the Angel Film Awards. Professional career Martha Hart, Ph.D., is a researcher at the University of Calgary/Alberta Children's Hospital. Her present research includes co-creating and pilot testing the Attachment and Child Health (ATTACH) Intervention, which explores links between parental reflective function (RF) and parent/child attachment led by Nicole Letourneau.http://childstudies.ca/node/73 Hart presented findings on the program at a number International Attachment Related Conferences in New York, London, Miami, Prague; and in Vancouver. The ATTACH Program is funded by Harvard University's Centre for the Developing Child as one of their Frontiers of Innovation projects. In 2019, Hart and Nicole Letourneau launched their ATTACH‚Ñ¢ Program online. Hart completed two degrees at the University of Calgary before moving to England to join the Centre for Family Research at the University of Cambridge where she completed her Masters and Ph.D. programs in Social & Developmental Psychology under supervisor Claire Hughes. Hart worked as a researcher at the University of Cambridge with Ruth Gaunt for several years researching the division of labor in the family and parents‚Äô child care choices before joining the team at the University of Calgary. Hart's past research also consisted of working on a University of Cambridge-based longitudinal project investigating the early origins of children's problem behaviour/self-esteem within a diverse sample, and how social correlates predicts such characteristics, while focusing on children's friendship/sibling/teacher relationships, as well as mother's parenting style and mental states (e.g. self-esteem, depression) and the impact on children's social (problem) behaviour and mental states (e.g. self-esteem) and prosocial behaviour in single/non-single mother households. She has published various peer-reviewed papers and has co-edited Development and Adaptation: Seminal Papers on the Dynamic-Maturational Model of Attachment and Adaptation, published by Waterside Press, with another book in publication titled Parenting and Child Development.https://www.researchgate.net/scientific- contributions/2003590774_Martha_J_Hart Hart was trained to administer the PDI at Yale University and the AAI by Howard Steele and Miriam Steele at the New School University New York, as well as Erik Hesse and Mary Main at Berkeley University. Hart is also trained by Howard Steele in RF (PDI), and in Reflective Family Play by Dianne Philip - at The Hincks-Dellcrest Centre Toronto. In addition, Hart trained with Alan Sroufe, and Elizabeth Carlson at the University of Minnesota, and Marinus van IJzendoorn at Cambridge University in the ABCD model of attachment, William Whelan in the MAC attachment measure at University of Virginia, as well as Patricia Crittenden in the DMM; she is a certified reliable coder in various attachment measures, RF measures, as well as a number of other parent/child interaction measures. She is also trained and certified in Suicide Prevention. Hart is also a past recipient of the University of Calgary's prestigious Eyes High Post-Doctoral Award. Lawsuits =Owen Hart's death= Three weeks after Owen's death, Hart launched a wrongful death lawsuit against the WWF, she included her children and Owen's parents on the lawsuit, which was settled out of court for approximately $18 million on November 2, 2000. She set aside millions of the settlement to establish the Owen Hart Foundation. She has managed the foundation since 1999. She gave 2 million dollars to Owen Hart's parents. After the lawsuit, Martha separated herself from the majority of the Hart family. She criticized those family members who worked against her with the WWF. In the end she remained friends with only Keith, Wayne and Bret Hart out of Owen's ten living siblings.https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/wrestler-widow-wwf- settle/article4168593/ https://archive.today/20180130223744/https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/wrestler- widow-wwf-settle/article4168593/ =Diana Hart's Under the Mat= There is real-life tension between Martha and her sister-in-law Diana Hart-Smith. Martha sued Diana and claims that Diana's book, Under the Mat: Inside Wrestling's Greatest Family, is both slanderous and libelous, and had it removed from markets everywhere; Martha was issued a public apology by the publishers, who were also required to give an undisclosed amount as a donation to the Owen Hart Foundation as stated in the settlement agreement. =Hart family DVD= On June 22, 2010, Martha filed another lawsuit against Vince and Linda McMahon, this time for wrongfully using Owen's name and likeness in numerous DVDs under the WWE name, as well as for deceptive business practices, and not paying royalty payments to Owen's estate and his children. On April 4, 2012, Judge Underhill agreed that Martha's claims against the WWE should go forward regarding the use of family/personal photos without her permission - copyright infringement, as well as breach of contract for not paying royalties from money made (and kept) by the WWE from merchandise sold with Owen's likeness since his death in 1999. In April 2013, the lawsuit was settled. =Nancy Grace= On April 9, 2014, Nancy Grace of CNN/HLN ran a show on the death of The Ultimate Warrior; the segment focused on wrestlers who had died of drug abuse. During the discussion, a list of wrestlers who died 'young' scrolled up in the background, which included Owen Hart's name. Martha Hart wrote to CNN/HLN about the implication, which resulted in Nancy Grace delivering an on-air retraction/apology on April 14, 2014 about the mistake relating specifically to Owen Hart. Book In 2002, Martha Hart started writing a book entitled Broken Harts: The Life and Death of Owen Hart that was released in 2004, which is about their life together from when they met as teens and the life they created for their two children. Her book was a #1 Best Seller in Canada, and is now published in several countries including the United States and the United Kingdom, with all of her proceeds allocated to charity. Owen Hart Foundation Owen Hart Foundation logo In December 2000, she announced the opening of the Owen Hart Foundation, a charity that provides university/college scholarships for children in need, as well as housing for low income families. The Owen Hart Foundation also supports a number of other worthwhile charities in the Calgary community. Every year, as a tribute to Owen Hart, Martha hosts a high-profile fundraising event for the Owen Hart Foundation. The 2000-2003 charity events were in support of YouVille Women's Residence, a shelter for abused women. Starting in 2004, the charity events have included a guest star; guest stars have included, Bob Newhart, 2004; Paul Anka, 2005; Neil Sedaka, 2006; Bill Cosby, 2007; Howie Mandel, 2008; Jerry Seinfeld, 2009‚Äì10th Anniversary; Ringo Starr and his All Starr Band, 2010; Russell Brand, 2011; Robin Williams (with special guest David Steinberg), 2012; Steve Martin and Martin Short, 2013; Dane Cook, 2014‚Äì15th Anniversary. Seth Meyers performed on October 2 for the 2015 event. Elvis Costello performed on December 10, 2016 for the 17th anniversary of the OHF. In 2017, for Canada's 150th birthday, The Owen Hart Foundation wanted to honor a Canadian artist and therefore featured Sarah McLachlan on December 1, 2017 to mark their 18th anniversary. Famed actor and SNL superstar Alec Baldwin performed for the OHF's 19th anniversary annual event on November 30, 2018. The OHF announced that world famous comedian Jerry Seinfeld will make his return again as he did a decade ago as the headliner to commemorate the OHF's 20th Anniversary. Hart has stated that she started the Owen Hart Foundation to create a meaningful legacy for Owen and because she knew he would be happy that she was helping people in his name, especially in the area of education which was very important to both of them.

In evolutionary biology and psychology, such an ability is presumed to have evolved for inbreeding avoidance. An additional adaptive function sometimes posited for kin recognition is a role in kin selection. There is debate over this, since in strict theoretical terms kin recognition is not necessary for kin selection or the cooperation associated with it. Rather, social behaviour can emerge by kin selection in the demographic conditions of 'viscous populations' with organisms interacting in their natal context, without active kin discrimination, since social participants by default typically share recent common origin. Since kin selection theory emerged, much research has been produced investigating the possible role of kin recognition mechanisms in mediating altruism. Taken as a whole, this research suggests that active powers of recognition play a negligible role in mediating social cooperation relative to less elaborate cue-based and context-based mechanisms, such as familiarity, imprinting and phenotype matching. Because cue-based 'recognition' predominates in social mammals, outcomes are non-deterministic in relation to actual genetic kinship, instead outcomes simply reliably correlate with genetic kinship in an organism's typical conditions. A well- known human example of an inbreeding avoidance mechanism is the Westermarck effect, in which unrelated individuals who happen to spend their childhood in the same household find each other sexually unattractive. Similarly, due to the cue-based mechanisms that mediate social bonding and cooperation, unrelated individuals who grow up together in this way are also likely to demonstrate strong social and emotional ties, and enduring altruism. Theoretical background The English evolutionary biologist W. D. Hamilton's theory of inclusive fitness, and the related theory of kin selection, were formalized in the 1960s and 1970s to explain the evolution of social behaviours. Hamilton's early papers, as well as giving a mathematical account of the selection pressure, discussed possible implications and behavioural manifestations. Hamilton considered potential roles of cue-based mechanisms mediating altruism versus 'positive powers' of kin discrimination: These two possibilities, altruism mediated via 'passive situation' or via 'sophisticated discrimination', stimulated a generation of researchers to look for evidence of any 'sophisticated' kin discrimination. However, Hamilton later (1987) developed his thinking to consider that \\"an innate kin recognition adaptation\\" was unlikely to play a role in mediating altruistic behaviours: The implication that the inclusive fitness criterion can be met by mediating mechanisms of cooperative behaviour that are context and location-based has been clarified by recent work by West et al.: For a recent review of the debates around kin recognition and their role in the wider debates about how to interpret inclusive fitness theory, including its compatibility with ethnographic data on human kinship, see Holland (2012).Holland, Maximilian. (2012) Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches. North Charleston: Createspace Press. Criticism Leading inclusive fitness theorists such as Alan Grafen have argued that the whole research program around kin recognition is somewhat misguided: Others have cast similar doubts over the enterprise: Experimental evidence Kin recognition is a behavioral adaptation noted in many species but proximate level mechanisms are not well documented. Recent studies have shown that kin recognition can result from a multitude of sensory input. Jill Mateo notes that there are three components prominent in kin recognition. First, \\"production of unique phenotypic cues or labels\\". Second, \\"perception of these labels and the degree of correspondence of these labels with a 'recognition template'\\", and finally the recognition of the phenotypes should lead to \\"action taken by the animal as a function of the perceived similarity between its template and an encountered phenotype\\". The three components allow for several possible mechanisms of kin recognition. Sensory information gathered from visual, olfactory and auditory stimuli are the most prevalent. The belding ground squirrel kin produce similar odors in comparison to non- kin.Sherman, P. W. (1981). \\"Kinship, Demography, and Belding's Ground Squirrel Nepotism.\\" Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology 8: 251-259. Mateo notes that the squirrels spent longer investigating non-kin scents suggesting recognition of kin odor. It's also noted that belding's ground squirrels produce at least two scents arising from dorsal and oral secretions, giving two opportunities for kin recognition. Auditory distinctions have been noted among avian species. Long-tailed tits (Aegithalos caudatus) are capable of discriminating kin and non-kin based on contact calls. Distinguishing calls are often learned from adults during the nestling period. Studies suggest that the bald-faced hornet, Dolichovespula maculata, can recognize nest mates by their cuticular hydrocarbon profile, which produces a distinct smell.Discrimination Between Natal and Non- Natal Nests by the Social Wasps Dolichovespula maculata and Polistes fuscatus. Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society. Deanna Ferguson, George J. Gamboa and Julia K. Jones. Departement of Biological Sciences, Oakland University. Kin recognition in some species may also be mediated by immunogenetic similarity of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). For a discussion of the interaction of these social and biological kin recognition factors see Lieberman, Tooby, and Cosmides (2007). Some have suggested that, as applied to humans, this nature-nurture interactionist perspective allows a synthesis between theories and evidence of social bonding and cooperation across the fields of evolutionary biology, psychology (attachment theory) and cultural anthropology (nurture kinship). In plants Kin recognition is an adaptive behavior observed in living beings to prevent inbreeding, and increase fitness of populations, individuals and genes. Kin recognition is the key to successful reciprocal altruism, a behavior that increases reproductive success of both organisms involved. Reciprocal altruism as a product of kin recognition has been observed and studied in many animals, and more recently, plants. Due to the nature of plant reproduction and growth, plants are more likely than animals to live in close proximity to family members, and therefore stand to gain more from the ability to differentiate kin from strangers. In recent years, botanists have been conducting studies to determine which plant species can recognize kin, and discover the responses of plants to neighboring kin. Murphy and Dudley (2009) shows that Impatiens pallida has the ability to recognize individuals closely related to them and those not related to them. The physiological response to this recognition is increasingly interesting. I. pallida responds to kin by increasing branchiness and stem elongation, to prevent shading relatives, and responds to strangers by increasing leaf to root allocation, as a form of competition. Similarly, Bhatt et al. (2010) show that Cakile edentula, the American sea rocket, has the ability to allocate more energy to root growth, and competition, in response to growing next to a stranger, and allocates less energy to root growth when planted next to a sibling. This reduces competition between siblings and increases fitness of relatives growing next to each other, while still allowing competition between non-relative plants. Little is known about the mechanisms involved in kin recognition. They most likely vary between species as well as within species. A study by Bierdrzycki et al. (2010) shows that root secretions are necessary for Arabidopsis thaliana to recognize kin vs. strangers, but not necessary to recognize self vs. non-self roots. This study was performed using secretion inhibitors, which disabled the mechanism responsible for kin recognition in this species, and showed similar growth patterns to Bhatt et al., (2010) and Murphy and Dudley (2009) in control groups. The most interesting result of this study was that inhibiting root secretions did not reduce the ability of Arabidopsis to recognize their own roots, which implicates a separate mechanism for self/non-self recognition than that for kin/stranger recognition. While this mechanism in the roots responds to exudates and involves competition over resources like nitrogen and phosphorus, another mechanism has been recently proposed, which involves competition over light, in which kin recognition takes place in leaves. In their 2014 study, Crepy and Casal conducted multiple experiments on different accessions of A. thaliana. These experiments showed that Arabidopsis accessions have distinct R:FR and blue light signatures, and that these signatures can be detected by photoreceptors, which allows the plant to recognize its neighbor as a relative or non-relative. Not much is known about the pathway that Arabidopsis uses to associate these light patterns with kin, however, researchers ascertained that photoreceptors phyB, cry 1, cry 2, phot1, and phot2 are involved in the process by performing a series of experiments with knock-out mutants. Researchers also concluded that the auxin- synthesis gene TAA1 is involved in the process, downstream of the photoreceptors, by performing a similar experiments using Sav3 knock-out mutants. This mechanism leads to altered leaf direction to prevent shading of related neighbors and to reduce competition for sunlight. Inbreeding avoidance When mice inbreed with close relatives in their natural habitat, there is a significant detrimental effect on progeny survival. Since inbreeding can be detrimental, it tends to be avoided by many species. In the house mouse, the major urinary protein (MUP) gene cluster provides a highly polymorphic scent signal of genetic identity that appears to underlie kin recognition and inbreeding avoidance. Thus there are fewer matings between mice sharing MUP haplotypes than would be expected if there were random mating. Another mechanism for avoiding inbreeding is evident when a female house mouse mates with multiple males. In such a case, there appears to be egg-driven sperm selection against sperm from related males. In toads, male advertisement vocalizations may serve as cues by which females recognize their kin and thus avoid inbreeding. In dioecious plants, the stigma may receive pollen from several different potential donors. As multiple pollen tubes from the different donors grow through the stigma to reach the ovary, the receiving maternal plant may carry out pollen selection favoring pollen from less related donor plants. Thus, kin recognition at the level of the pollen tube apparently leads to post-pollination selection to avoid inbreeding depression. Also, seeds may be aborted selectively depending on donor‚Äìrecipient relatedness.

This small poultry farm is in Hainan, China. In poultry keeping, yarding is the practice of providing the poultry with a fenced yard in addition to a poultry house. Movable yarding is a form of managed intensive grazing. Yarding is often confused with free range. The distinction is that free-range poultry are either totally unfenced, or the fence is so distant that it has little influence on their freedom of movement.  Historical practice  Before the discovery of vitamins A and D in the 1920s, green feed and sunshine were essential to the health of poultry. Vitamin D was synthesized from sunlight on the skin (as with humans), while Vitamin A was obtained through green forage plants such as grass. Yards small enough to be fenced economically were soon stripped of palatable green forage and become barren. This is followed by a build-up of manure, parasites, and other pathogens. Free range husbandry was the most common method in these early days. Most farms had only a small free-range barnyard flock. Larger flocks were kept in small houses build on skids, which were dragged periodically to a fresh piece of ground. This method is similar to the modern practice of pastured poultry. Experts of the day estimated the sustainable level to be about fifty hens per acre (80 m¬≤ per hen), with one hundred hens per acre (40 m¬≤ per hen) as an absolute upper limit if special care was taken. These levels are sustainable in the sense that the turf can make use of the nutrients in the manure left behind by the chickens, and in the sense that, at this stocking density, the chickens will not completely destroy the turf through scratching. > At the Oregon Station on clay soil it was found that the day droppings from > 200 laying hens on an acre [20 m¬≤ per hen] in four years made the soil too > rich for the successful growth of cereal crops where cropping the ground was > done every other year.

Because fifty hens per acre represents per hen (80 m¬≤ per hen), while the density inside the house at the time was normally four square feet per hen (0.4 m¬≤ per hen), this required that the yard be 200 times wider than the house, assuming a yard on one side of the house. That is, a house wide required a yard wide to provide the necessary area. This would normally be provided as two yards, one on either side of the house, each wide. In reality, such yards are expensive to fence, and the chickens spend most of their time on the portion closest to the house, so sustainability was never achieved in practice except with portable houses, which were moved periodically to fresh ground. Yarded operations were operated with unsustainably small yards that were quickly denuded and which received excessive levels of manure. The use of multiple yards, frequent plowing, and liberal use of lime would allow higher stocking levels to be used, since plowing and liming would allow much of the nitrogen to escape from the soil. The following is typical advice for the successful use of yards in the Thirties and Forties: > All poultrymen should realize that there are no known substitutes for > sunshine and young green grass in keeping poultry in the best possible state > of health and in promoting growth and maintaining egg production. Where > sunshine and green grass cannot be provided, as in the case of birds kept in > strict confinement, the best possible substitutes must be provided.

Nutritional advances increasingly turned yarding into a liability, and it fell out of favor. Free range continued to be used, especially for breeding flocks and for pullets before they reached laying age, because of the lower rate of disease and greater overall health of grass-reared chickens. Breeding flocks (which lay eggs destined for incubation) are always given a better diet than flocks laying table eggs, since a diet that will produce table eggs cheaply will not provide eggs that hatch well. For some time after confined laying flocks produced table eggs satisfactorily, breeding flocks benefited from free range In Britain, Geoffrey Sykes developed a new yarding system in the Fifties.Geoffrey Sykes, The Henyard. 1952. Crosby Lockwood & Sons. This used a small yard covered with a thick layer of straw, with more straw added frequently. He also recommended that shade and a windbreak be provided by a solid fence around the yard, or by other means, such as rows of haybales. Once a year, the old straw was removed by a front-end loader or similar machinery. This method eliminated mud and pathogens. It was later forgotten because the industry moved to high-density confinement before the method was widely established.  Recent practice  Today, commercial poultry producers generally call yarding free range on their labels. This conflation of two very different techniques has led to confusion. The vast majority of \\"free-range\\" operations are really yarded. Pastured poultry, as promoted by the APPPA, the American Pastured Poultry Producers Association,APPPA: Pastured Poultry for Everyone and author/farmer Joel Salatin, takes a different approach, attempting to achieve the benefits of free range while using penning or yarding. The key element of Pastured poultry is the use of portable housing and the optional use of portable electric fencing. By moving the house and yard frequently, perhaps daily, all the disadvantages of permanent yards are eliminated.

Competing for Canada, he won the gold medal in the men's singles event at the 1983 FIL World Luge Championships in Lake Placid, New York in four record breaking runs. He represented the United States at the 1988 Winter Olympics.  Personal life  Zajonc was born on June 10, 1960, in Spi≈°sk√° Star√° Ves, Czechoslovakia. He grew up in the Tatra mountains in the town of Stary Smokovec in Slovakia. In 1995, he changed the spelling of his surname to Zayonc to aid with pronunciation. He became a U.S. citizen in 1996.  Career  = As a competitor = Zajonc started training in luge in 1971 and competed for Czechoslovakia until his defection to the United States in 1981. He was unable to compete for the U.S. until 1985 due to the U.S. luge citizenship qualification policy. Zajonc was allowed to compete for Canada and he won the World Championships in 1983. He defeated world champion Sergey Danilin (Soviet Union), Olympic champion Paul Hildgartner (Italy), and 1980 Olympic champion Bernhard Glass (Germany). Although Zajonc lacked a large support staff like the dominant German, Italian, and Soviet teams, the Italian luger Hansj√∂rg Raffl gave him one of his new speed suits just before the competition to help him be competitive with the best teams. His victory created problems for the Soviet coaching staff as he defeated Danilin on a Soviet-built sled purchased from them just months prior to the race. Despite sliding his best at the time Zajonc was unable to compete at the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo, due to not having US citizenship. After 1985, he represented the United States and was named in the U.S. team to the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary. He qualified despite breaking his right foot in a training accident five weeks prior to the Olympics. Zajonc suffered an open fracture and was missing part of his heal bone after hitting his foot at 65 mph 2√ó6 wall extension that was left square with the bottom of his foot. His injury prevented him from competing in singles and he would finish 11th in the men's doubles event for the US team, sliding with a special cast on his right foot. He used crutches to get to the start. The East German team requested to inspect Zayonc's injury, thinking he might be faking it to gain a competitive advantage using the pointed cast. He retired from competition in 1988. = As a coach = Zajonc joined the USA luge team's coaching staff in 1990. He served as head coach of the junior national team from 1991-2011. His athletes won 15 World Championship titles and many overall World Cup victories. He also coached the US Olympic luge teams in 1992, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, 2010 and 2014, winning five Olympic medals. In September 2012, Zayonc was named U.S. senior national head coach heading for Sochi. At the Olympics, Erin Hamlin won a bronze medal, the first-ever US Olympic medal in singles luge. In May 2017, Zajonc stepped down as head coach, due to Parkinson's disease. USA Luge CEO Jim Leahy stated that Zayonc would remain active in the organization.

Technical description The plants are dioicous, small but medium-sized for a liverwort, from golden-green to golden, but more typically reddish-brown, or dilute purplish-red, or coppery red, resembling a dense fuzzy mat, occurring in small or large patches. Shoots are less than 1¬Ω mm wide. Leaves are incubous (decurrent on the dorsal stem surface) and deeply bilobed, with each lobe divided 1-3 times, elongated, narrowly lanceolate, deeply divided. The lobe margins are entire, with 1 or 2 long, slender, cilia- like projections along the lobes margins and at lobe apices. The leaves are so closely overlapping that only a mass of ciliate projections is visible under a hand lens. The underleaves are prominent, wider than the stem but about or less than half the size of the leaves, 2-3 clefted, and with ciliate margins (even more finely divided into slender projections). The frequent perianths are plicate and narrowed to a ciliate mouth. Sporophytes are abundant from May to August. Distribution, habitat, and ecology In the past, this plant has been reported from Russia and Japan, but recent literature calls it an endemic of the west coast of North America, ranging from southeastern Alaska to northern California. This plant has a narrow environmental specificity; it is found in (and serves as an indicator species of) old-growth forest. It is typically epiphytic on bark at the base of standing mature to old-growth trees (Abies concolor, A. magnifica, and Pseudotsuga menziesii) or recently fallen logs; rarely on other organic substrates such as decaying logs and stumps, or humus covering boulders. At the southern end of its range (Oregon and California) this species is distinctly restricted to middle elevation forests. Its elevational range is from . The fire ecology of this plant is not known; however, fires in old-growth habitat might negatively affect P. californicum because of smoke, or from excessively opening the canopy. Severe fires that destroy old-growth trees would likely extirpate populations. Conservation status and threats The plant is on the U.S. Forest Service Pacific Southwest Region Sensitive Species list, and has a NatureServe California State Rank of S3 and a Global Rank of G4. The survival of Ptilidium californicum in the southern end of its range (i.e., northern California) depends upon the protection of the known sites as dispersal sources. The major threat facing P. californicum is loss of populations due to management activities that directly or indirectly impact the habitat or populations by disrupting stand conditions necessary for its survival. These include treatments such as the removal of colonized substrate, stand treatments that result in changes in microclimatic conditions or forest structure, or harvest of special forest products that may include individuals of this taxon. Spray paint used to mark 'leave,' 'take,' and 'wildlife' trees within project areas severely impact on this species. Liverwort diversity and abundance are strongly affected by forest age, and both components are much greater in old-growth forests. Therefore, the loss of old-growth habitats poses another threat to this species. Field identification The leaves with many lobes divided into slender cilia make this species unmistakable.

Design Although outwardly similar to the five previous post-war ships built by Cammell Laird, Manxman had a very different engine room lay-out than that of her five older sisters. Pictured shortly after her launch, Manxman can be seen being manoeuvred into Cammell Laird's fitting out basin at Birkenhead (note the aft lifeboat davits, which differentiated her from her five older sisters) Manxman was one of the first ships constructed to use the Pametrada design, in which the turbine rotor turned at 4,300 r.p.m. Double reduction gearing was used to drive the two propellers at 270 r.p.m.. Her two steam turbines were driven by superheated steam at . This meant Manxman developed a normal shaft horsepower of . Operational history Manxman‚Äôs maiden voyage took place on 21 May 1955, with a sailing from Douglas to Liverpool. From then on, she plied the routes from North West England and North Wales to the Isle of Man and Ireland. The Manxman was cast in the role of for the 1979 dramatic film S.O.S. Titanic. In 1981, the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company made a pre-tax loss of ¬£620,000 and it was announced that 1982 would be the Manxman's last year in Steam Packet service. Her first sailing of the 1982 season was a 23.55 relief from Liverpool to Douglas on 28 May. On 19 June 1982, the ship had been chartered by the Liverpool Co-Operative Society, but this booking was cancelled at quite short notice. The ship was therefore offered to the Manxman Steamer Society, who instead ran a Liverpool to Douglas day excursion entitled 'Steam All The Way'. On arrival at Douglas, passengers were able to travel by steam train to Port Erin on the Isle of Man Railway. As the 1982 season began to near its end, Manxman began to attract increasing attention from the media, making appearances on both television and radio broadcasts, and in regional and national newspapers. On 3 July, Manxman sailed from Ardrossan for the final time. This was followed by last sailings from Fleetwood on 15 August, Belfast on 27 August, and Dublin on 28 August. On 30 August, Manxman sailed 'light' from Douglas to Workington in preparation for a 10.15 sailing back to the Isle of Man. That evening, the return trip departed Douglas at 19.00 in foul weather. A Force 8 gale was blowing in the Irish Sea and it was not possible for the ship to berth safely in Workington. Manxman was forced to sail Northwards with over 1,000 passengers on board, and ride out the storm in the shelter of the Solway Firth. The ship finally docked at Workington at 09.00 the following morning, having given those on board a farewell trip they were unlikely to forget in a hurry. 1 September saw the final departure from Llandudno, and that evening the ship sailed light to Liverpool in preparation for what would be her penultimate public sailing. At 09.35 on 4 September 1982, Manxman departed Liverpool with her last ever sailing for the Isle of Man Steam Packet: a charter to Douglas run under the name 'Finished With Engines'. Slipping from the landing stage stern first, she turned in the River Mersey before heading downstream towards the sea. Long salutes on the ships whistle were sounded as she passed fellow Steam Packet vessel still berthed at the landing stage, and also with the small excursion ship . Further towards the sea she passed , a little further on , and finally . Sailing into Douglas, Manxman was greeted by many small ships which had sailed out to greet her. Passengers were able to enjoy 5 hours ashore before the advertised 18.30 departure, her last sailing from the Isle of Man. A dismal evening departure with drizzle and mist seemed to match the mood of many on board as Manxman left Douglas behind for good. With the Onchan Silver Band playing, and a flotilla of small vessels once more accompanying her, including a \\"guard\\" from Captain Stephen Carter and the tugs Union and Salisbury of the Laxey Towing Company, she set sail for Liverpool one last time. At sea, the weather improved dramatically, and she sailed under clear skies and a bright moon with the lights of North Wales and North West England visible on the shore. After arrival, Manxman was to be laid up at Birkenhead pending a decision on her future. On 21 September 1982 it was announced that TSS Manxman had been saved from the scrap man, and had been purchased by Marda (Squash) Ltd. for a sum in the region of ¬£100,000. The company intended for her to be the centrepiece of a new leisure complex at Preston Docks. Manxman was to be sailed there under her own steam, a final outing in passenger service. She departed her berth at Birkenhead at 08.28 on 1 October, sailing the short distance to Liverpool Landing Stage where she moored. On 3 October, with passengers paying ¬£12.50 for a single ticket, and with beer on sale at 1955 prices (10p per pint), Manxman departed Liverpool at 09.07. She berthed at Preston at 12.45 and 'finished with engines' was rung on the ships telegraph at 12.48. Decline and scrapping Following withdrawal from revenue service, and relocation to Preston Docks, Manxman's new owners intended to convert her into a floating museum and visitor centre. This venture was not a success, and the ship was subsequently developed into a floating nightclub and restaurant. Before moving to Preston docks she was used as a location for the film Yentl with Barbra Streisand. She also featured in a Granada series called Scramble with Richard and Judy (before they were an item) the show provided help to people setting up businesses. Redevelopment of the Preston docks area once again made the Manxman homeless, and she was towed to Liverpool in 1991 where once again she was to be used as a floating nightclub in the Trafalgar Docks area. In 1993 she was again moved, this time to Hull, being moored in the disused Ruscador Dry Dock. Here, a fire which broke out in August 1997 seriously damaged many of the vintage wood panels of the ship's interior and she was moved to the yard of Pallion Engineering Company Ltd on the River Wear, in the shadow of the Queen Alexandra Bridge in Sunderland, inside Pallion Dry Dock.Images of her pre-demolition state in dry dock at Pallion can be seen at http://www.shipsofmann.org.uk/Manxman.htm. (info provided by Keith Lloyd 270210) =Preservation campaign= Manxman at Pallion Engineering, Sunderland A preservation group, The Manxman Steamship Company was formed with the aim of securing the historic ship, the last of her line, and the last remaining classic British passenger turbine steamer. She was also the last surviving passenger ship constructed by Cammell Laird. A charity cruise on board the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company's Lady of Mann took place to raise funds for the Manxman. Several celebrities supported the Manxman Steamship Company, including Paul O'Grady, Tom O'Connor and Ken Dodd. The ship continued to deteriorate, including from theft of components and a fire which seriously damaged much of the interior woodwork. The preservation campaign was ultimately unsuccessful. It was announced in March 2010 that Manxman was to be dismantled in Pallion shipyard. By January 2011, the ship was being decommissioned and dismantled by G O'Brien & Sons, a specialist heavy industrial and marine demolition company. The dismantling took place in a large dry dock in the Pallion shipyard, Sunderland. The ship was finally broken up for scrap in 2012.

After the case closed, Chinamasa declared various NGO's illegal, including leading Human Rights organisation the Amani Trust which provides support to victims of torture; and was reportedly accused of working with the British government to unseat President Robert Mugabe and destabilise the nation.Zimbabwe: Rights under siege: State intimidation of Human Rights NGO Amani Trust.

He played hurling with his local club Blackrock and was a member of the Cork senior inter-county team from 1974 until 1983. Playing career =Club= O'Donoghue first came to prominence as a member of the hugely successful Blackrock minor team of the late sixties. In all he won three successive minor championship medals as Blackrock secured a remarkable four-in-a-row between 1966 and 1969. By 1973 O'Donoghue had become a key member of the Blackrock senior team and lined out in his first championship decider. A 2‚Äì12 to 2‚Äì10 defeat of Glen Rovers gave him his first championship medal. A subsequent two-point defeat of Newmarket-on-Fergus in the provincial decider gave O'Donoghue a first Munster medal. The subsequent All-Ireland final pitted Blackrock against Rathnure. A rousing draw was followed by a great replay. Superb late goals by Donie Collins and O'Donoghue secured a 3‚Äì8 to 1‚Äì9 victory and a first All-Ireland medal. Back-to-back championship titles eluded the Rockies, however, a 4‚Äì11 to 0‚Äì10 defeat of Glen Rovers in 1975 gave O'Donoghue a second championship medal. He later added a second Munster medal to his collection following a decisive 8‚Äì12 to 3‚Äì8 defeat of Mount Sion. Kilkenny's James Stephen provided the opposition in the subsequent All-Ireland final. Five points down at half-time, the Kilkenny club came storming back and defeated O'Donoghue's side by 2‚Äì10 to 2‚Äì4. It was 1978 before O'Donoghue enjoyed his next success. A 4‚Äì12 to 1‚Äì7 defeat of Glen Rovers gave him a third championship medal. Once again the Rockies stormed through the provincial championship and defeated Newmarket-on-Fergus by two goals, giving O'Donoghue a third Munster medal. The All-Ireland final saw Cork take on Kilkenny again. This time it was Blackrock versus Ballyhale Shamrocks. Ray Cummins scored two goals in rapid succession in the opening thirty minutes to put Blackrock in the driving seat. At the full-time whistle Blackrock were the winners by 5‚Äì7 to 5‚Äì5, giving O'Donoghue a third All-Ireland medal as captain. A 2‚Äì14 to 2‚Äì6 defeat of St. Finbarr's in 1979 gave O'Donoghgue his fourth championship medal. It was the first time that Blackrock had won back- to-back championships in almost fifty years. In a similar sequence of events to previous years the club later defeated Dunhill of Waterford to take the Munster club title. It was O'Donoghue's fourth Munster medal. The next few seasons saw Blackrock go into decline. The club lost the 1982 county final to St. Finbarr's, however, three years later in 1985 O'Donoghue's side triumphed once again. A 1‚Äì14 to 1‚Äì8 victory gave him a fifth county title. O'Donoghue bowed out of club hurling shortly after this victory. =Inter-county= O'Donoghue first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Cork senior team in the early 1970s. His first success came in 1974 when Cork trounced Limerick by 6‚Äì13 to 1‚Äì12 to take the National Hurling League title. O'Donoghue later made his championship debut against Waterford, however, the year ended without any championship success. Over the next few seasons O'Donoghue remained a fringe player on the Cork team. He came on as a substitute in the All-Ireland final of 1976 as the team battled back from being eight points down to secure a 2‚Äì21 to 4‚Äì11 defeat of Wexford. It was O'Donoghue's first All-Ireland winners' medal. Two years later in 1978 O'Donoghue was introduced as a substitute in Cork's narrow 0‚Äì13 to 0‚Äì11 win over Clare in the provincial decider. It was his first Munster medal on the field of play. This victory paved the way for Cork to take on Kilkenny in the subsequent All-Ireland final. The stakes were high as Cork were attempting to capture a first three in-a-row since 1954. The game, however, was not the classic that many expected. Cork were never really troubled over the course of the seventy minutes and a Jimmy Barry-Murphy goal helped the team to a 1‚Äì15 to 2‚Äì8 victory over their age-old rivals. O'Donoghue was once again introduced as a substitute. It was his second All-Ireland medal. After failing to secure an elusive four-in-a-row in 1979 a number of key players retired. O'Donoghue remained as Cork secured back-to-back National League titles in 1980 and 1981. By 1982 Cork returned to the big time with a new team. O'Donoghue remained on the fringes once again, however, he collected his second Munster medal on the field of play after coming on as a substitute in Cork's 5‚Äì31 to 3‚Äì6 drubbing of Waterford. The subsequent All-Ireland final pitted Cork against Kilkenny, with 'the Rebels' installed as the red-hot favourites. All did not go to plan as Kilkenny dominated. O'Donoghue was sprung from the bench again, however, Christy Heffernan was the hero of the day as he scored two goals in a forty- second spell just before half-time. Ger Fennelly captured a third goal in the second half as Kilkenny completely trounced 'the Rebels' by 3‚Äì18 to 1‚Äì15. O'Donoghue claimed a third Munster medal in 1983 as Waterford fell heavily by 3‚Äì22 to 0‚Äì12 for the second consecutive year. After defeating Galway in the All-Ireland semi-final Cork squared up to Kilkenny in the All-Ireland final for the second year in-a-row. O'Donoghue was on the starting fifteen in a championship final for the first time in his career. Once again Kilkenny dominated the game, assisted by a strong wind in the first-half, and hung on in the face of a great fight-back by Cork. At the full-time whistle Kilkenny emerged victorious by 2‚Äì14 to 2‚Äì12. For the second consecutive year O'Donoghue ended up on the losing side on All-Ireland final day. He retired from inter- county hurling following this defeat. =Inter-provincial= O'Donoghue was also selected for duty with Munster in the inter-provincial series of games. He was first picked for his province in 1976 and was named captain for the year. After a one-point win over Connacht, O'Donoghue's team lined out against Leinster in the final. That game was also a close affair, however, Munster triumphed by 4‚Äì9 to 4‚Äì8. It was O'Donoghue's first Railway Cup medal. After a hiatus of five years O'Donoghue was back with Munster again in 1981. The team stormed to the Railway Cup title following a 5‚Äì13 to 1‚Äì8 rout of Ulster and a ten-point win over fierce rivals Leinster. O'Donoghue retained his place on the Munster team for 1982, however, his side were defeated by Connacht in the semi-final. .

The agency was created as part of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, which was passed on October 11, 1974, in the wake of the 1973 oil crisis. The act split the Atomic Energy Commission into two new agencies: the Nuclear Regulatory Commission would regulate the commercial nuclear power industry, while the ERDA would manage the energy research and development, nuclear weapons, and naval reactors programs. The Energy Research and Development Administration was activated on January 19, 1975. The first Administrator was Robert Seamans, followed by Robert W. Fri.

His assessments as a rule differ in the part of Ukrainian historians which are supporters Petro Doroshenko. Biography He was a registered Cossack, belonging to the Chyhyryn Company (Chyhyryn Regiment). Early in his career he served as Bohdan Khmelnytsky's courier and diplomatic emissary. He was elected Kosh otaman (1661‚Äì3) of the Zaporizhian Sich. At the Chorna rada of 1663 he was elected Hetman of the Left Bank with the support of Moscow as an alternative to already elected Hetman Pavlo Teteria. Briukhovetsky's election was at the roots of the division of the Cossack State and is known in history as The Ruin. However, Briukhovetsky's reign and cruelty worked against him. Early on he arrested and executed his opponents, namely polkovniks Somko and Vasili Zolotarenko. To gain support he signed the Moscow Articles of 1665, which placed Left-bank Ukraine under direct control of the Tsar. In return, Briukhovetsky secured for himself the title of boyar, properties, and marriage to Prince Dolgoruky's daughter. This treaty went on to be called the \\"Briukhovetsky treaty\\" and caused massive rebellion in Ukraine. His popularity among the clergy fell when he suggested that Moscow appoint and send a metropolitan to the Kievan Metropolia. As his domestic policies failed, Briukhovetsky put the blame on the Russian authorities and sided with the Cossacks' rebellion in an attempt to save his reputation, but it was too late.

It was a mining town founded in 1850 during the California Gold Rush, and was the site of the Mount Ophir Mint, the first authorized mint in California. History Mount Ophir during the early 1850s was a large camp, and stores and tents straggled along the main road for quite a distance. In 1854, Louis Trabucco purchased the stone-walled trading post in Mount Ophir, which was patronized by miners and packers. Its ruins now stand next to the foundation of a large two-store frame hotel built in 1852. The Post Office opened in 1852 under the name \\"Ophir\\" but was changed in 1856 to \\"Mount Ophir\\" because of the name conflict with Ophir in Placer County. =Mount Ophir Mint= The gold stamping mill was built in 1850-51 by Moffat and Company, operating under the authority of Augustus Humbert, who had been appointed by President John Tyler to be the federal assayer for the new state of California. The Mount Ophir Mint produced Octagonal Gold Slugs with a fifty-dollar denomination. On February 14, 1851 the newspaper, the San Francisco Prices Current, indicated that the production of $50 slugs was about to begin: > The above cut represents the obverse of the United States ingot, or, rather, > coin, of the value of $50, about to be issued at the Government Assay > Office. It is precisely of this size and shape.... The reverse side bears an > impression of rayed work without any inscription. Upon the edges following: > 'Augustus Humbert United States Assayer-California Gold 1851.'... The fifty- > dollar pieces will be of uniform value, and will be manufactured in the same > manner as coins.... By order of the secretary of the Treasury these ingots > and coin are to be received for duties and other dues to the United States > government, and our bankers, we are advised, will receive them at their > stamped value.

By 1853 the mint was closed. The ruins of the mill are still visible. See also * * References * Cottin, Charles M.

Background and academic career  Madhuku was born on 20 July 1966 in Chipinge, Zimbabwe. He attended the University of Zimbabwe (UZ), receiving a Bachelor of Law degree in 1990. He then travelled to the UK to study at the University of Cambridge, receiving a Master of Law in 1994 and a doctorate in 1999. In 2010, he published a book titled An Introduction to Zimbabwean Law. He was made a full professor at UZ in 2011.  Activism  Madhuku is a founding member of the National Constitutional Assembly (NCA), a pro-democracy group allied with the Movement for Democratic Change led by Morgan Tsvangirai. The group opposes the one-party rule of President Robert Mugabe and seeks to establish a democratic constitution. Madhuku served as its vice president from 1997 to 2001 and its president from 2001 to 2011. In 2000, he helped to defeat a constitution introduced by Mugabe in a national referendum. Mugabe described Madhuku's activities as \\"opportunism\\", stating: \\"There are some fraudulent human rights campaigners like Lovemore Madhuku and his NCA who, when broke, intentionally provoke the police in order to get arrested and raise money from the donors. As such, they easily attract the attention international media line CNN, BBC over nothing. That's the Madhuku survival strategy for you\\". In November 2001, Madhuku was detained without charge for leading a demonstration after soldiers allegedly strangled a student and threw him from a train. According to journalist Geoffrey Nyarota, Madhuku was also subject to a smear campaign by state-owned media. Madhuku has stated that his country home was burned down and his house in Harare badly damaged by attacks. In February 2004, he was arrested during a protest, beaten, and left for dead outside Harare. On recovering, he stated, \\"We will not be deterred by the beatings and the cruelty of this regime. They can only stop us by killing us.\\" In October of the same year, Mugabe's government introduced a bill into parliament seeking to ban nongovernmental organizations, including the NCA. In November 2006, he was charged with organizing an illegal protest, but a magistrate later dismissed the charges. Police assaulted him again in March 2007, breaking his arm and leaving him with cuts to the head and body. He was summoned to court again in 2011 for his leadership of 2004 protests, drawing international criticism. Madhuku was re-elected as the NCA's chair in 2006 under controversial circumstances, as he had amended its constitution to extend his term of office. According to Radio Netherlands, Madhuku was particularly criticized for serving several terms after having himself criticized Mugabe for serving more than two terms in office. He completed his final term as the group's chair in 2011.  Civil Courage Prize  Madhuku was awarded the 2004 Civil Courage Prize by the US-based Train Foundation, sharing it with Iranian activist Emadeddin Baghi. He was unable to attend the ceremony due to the proposing banning of the NCA, and sending Nyarota to accept it on his behalf. together with Godfrey Nyamukuwa References Category:Living people Category:1966 births Category:People from Manicaland Province Category:Alumni of the University of Cambridge Category:University of Zimbabwe alumni Category:University of Zimbabwe faculty Category:Zimbabwean democracy activists Category:Zimbabwean politicians ","title":"Lovemore Madhuku"},{"id":"11802824","text":"Cicerone Field at Anteater Ballpark is the ballpark at the University of California, Irvine in Irvine, California, United States.

Retrieved 16 May 2009 Admissions With the current number of students around the 2100 markAbout Us page it puts John Port as the largest secondary school in Derbyshire, and one of the largest nationally.List of Large Secondary Schools, WhatDoTheyKnow.com The current head-teacher is Karen Squire. John Port is a mixed gender school, with the student age range between 11 and 18, and with the 6th Form taking students from the ages of 16 to 18. There are approximately 141 full-time and temporary members of the teaching staff. History The school is on the site of a demolished country manor, Etwall Hall, Etwall, situated just outside Derby, traditionally of the Port family who were the wealthy landowners/farmers of the parish.Etwall at Derbyshire-PeakDistrict.co.uk. Retrieved August 2007 In 1952, the Derbyshire County Council bought Etwall Hall from Reg Parnell, the famous racing car driver. The hall had been used during the Second World War by the Army, first as a petrol depot and later as an equipment supply centre and been left in a somewhat dilapidated state. After its demolition a secondary modern, Etwall Secondary School, and a secondary grammar school, John Port Grammar School, were built on the site. In 1965 they were amalgamated to form the John Port School that occupies the site today. The name of the Port family, who lived at the hall, has been associated with Etwall since the 15th century. The family's most famous son, Sir John Port, was the founder of the nearby Repton School and committed to the furthering of education for young men in the village. It therefore seemed entirely appropriate that the new school was named after him. School site A green site The large siteSite plan , Johnport.org has an open feel, being a 'green' campus with plenty of open spaces between the individual teaching facilities. The centre of the site is focussed around the lake, one of the original fishing ponds that were in the grounds of the Etwall Hall. Teaching facilities are spread across the site, with each faculty having a separate building. The buildings are mostly named after settlements and features in Derbyshire and the Peak District, with the exceptions to this being Flamsteed, named after a famous local scientist John Flamsteed, and the Jubilee Centre, named to commemorate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. The Learning Resources Centre is situated centrally on the site, occupying most of the ground floor of 'B' block. The site is also home to the Etwall Leisure Centre, with public access from Hilton Road. This new centre was officially opened on 17 July 2009, although it didn't open to the public till 5 August 2009. The new facilities include a six-lane 25 m swimming pool, squash courts, fitness suite and large sports hall. School performance The school was most recently graded as \\"Inadequate\\" by Ofsted in all aspects of the school in a June 2017 inspection report. Numerous failures of the school's leadership were criticised, in particular student safeguarding and welfare, academic performance, the behaviour and moral guidance of students, quality of teaching, sixth form education and lacklustre leadership, causing the then Headmaster Chris Sainsbury to resign after having been suspended.https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/local-news/damning-ofted- report-john-port-205994https://files.ofsted.gov.uk/v1/file/2711915 It has been placed under \\"special measures\\" by Ofsted as a result, and the school has not been inspected since.

Among her many awards and decorations are the State Prize of the Russian Federation and the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. She is now the President of the Pushkin Museum, a ceremonial post.  Career  Antonova studied under Boris Vipper at the Moscow University, graduating in 1945. Later that year she joined the staff of the Pushkin Museum, where she has worked ever since. In February 1961 Nikita Khrushchev put her in charge of the museum. Antonova witnessed as the entire collection of the Dresden Gallery arrived to the museum from Germany in 1945 and was removed from it ten years later. She opposed the return of the collection to Germany, claiming it was a just compensation for the damage inflicted on Russia's cultural heritage by the German invaders. The museum still holds Priam's Treasure, taken as a trophy by the Red Army after the Battle of Berlin. Antonova's interests revolve around Impressionist and Modern art. In 1948, the Pushkin Museum acquired considerable holdings of these works from the nationalized collections of Sergei Shchukin and Ivan Morozov. Antonova was also instrumental in establishing Svyatoslav Richter's December nights, an international music festival that has been held in the museum since 1981. Antonova had long supported the recreation of the State Museum of New Western Art, a museum created from the collections of Sergei Shchukin and Ivan Morozov, destroyed by Stalin in 1948. The collections of the museum were dispersed to the Pushkin and the Hermitage Museum. The Hermitage has been reluctant to let its collection go to the proposed museum and Antonova and the Hermitage director, Mikhail Piotrovsky publicly disagreed over the issue. The Russian Government proposed an online \\"virtual museum\\", which Antonova rejected. A spokesperson for Russian President Vladimir Putin said that \\"the chances of creating such a museum fall significantly\\" after Piotrovsky's disapproval. Antonova later said people who were against the recreation of the museum were \\"adhering to a decree of Stalin.\\" Shortly after the controversy, Antonova was fired and replaced by Marina Loshak. Antonova oversaw art collections which were taken by Soviet Union from Germany after World War II. She first denied that such collections exist, and when it was apparent that they exist started publicly stating that the collections were taken to the Soviet Union legally and should be exempt from the restitution.  Personal life  She was married to Russian art historian Evsey Rotenberg, who died 2011.

Foster discovered his talents as a playwright in Fredericton, New Brunswick, while he was working as host of a popular morning radio show. He accompanied a friend to an audition, and landed his first acting job, as Elwood P. Dowd in Harvey, without ever having even seeing a play. Intrigued with the theatre, he set his pen to paper and wrote his first play titled Sinners. In 1983 and 1984, Theatre New Brunswick mounted the first professional productions of Sinners and Foster's next play The Melville Boys. In the years following, TNB introduced My Darling Judith (1987), The Affections of May (1990), The Motor Trade (1991), Wrong for Each Other (1992), and Office Hours (1996). An extremely prolific writer, Foster has had more than fifty plays produced on professional stages. Other well- known plays include The Love List, The Long Weekend; Bedtime Stories; Kiss the Moon, Kiss the Sun; Storm Warning; Skin Flick; Outlaw; Hilda's Yard; On A First Name Basis; Old Love; Mending Fences, Here on the Flight Path, The Foursome and The Ladies Foursome. Frequently compared to American playwright Neil Simon, Foster pens plays that are known for their humour, accessibility, and insight into the everyday tribulations of life.http://halifax.infomonkey.net/nova.scotia.news.events.php?e=norm-foster title= Who's Afraid of Norm Foster Foster's work is frequently produced by theatre groups across North America, and as far away from his home in Canada as Canberra, Australia. Beginning in June 2016, The Norm Foster Theatre Festivalhttps://www.fosterfestival.com/site/home in St. Catharines, Ontario celebrated the work of this Canadian playwright.http://www.normfoster.com The Playwrights Guild of Canada awarded him lifetime membership in 2016. In December 2016, Foster was named an Officer of the Order of Canada. In 2018, he was awarded the key to the city in St. Catharines, Ontario. He also acts, often in his own work. For example, he appears as Jonas in some productions of Jonas & Barry in the Home.

Merchant Cargo Carrier  She operated as a merchant cargo carrier until placed in the National Defense Reserve Fleet at Suisun Bay, California, on 24 June 1948. Later taken out of reserve, she was chartered to Pacific Far East Line, Inc., San Francisco, California, on 24 December 1951 and operated as a merchantman in the Far East during the Korean War. On 2 June 1952 she was transferred by the Maritime Administration to the custody of the U.S. Navy at Suisun Bay, California.  Conversion to YAG-39  Acquired by the U.S. Navy on 2 April 1953, she was designated YAG-39 the following month. She was then fitted out with numerous scientific instruments, including nuclear detection and measurement devices, which enabled her to conduct contamination and fallout measurement tests after nuclear explosions. Manned by an experimental crew in a specially protected control cubicle, she also was fitted with electronic remote control gear that enabled her to serve as a robot ship.  Supporting atomic testing in the Pacific  Following extensive conversion, YAG-39 was placed in service at San Francisco, California, on 20 October 1953, with Lt. Comdr. Hugh W. Anglin in command. Assigned to Joint Task Force 7, she steamed to Eniwetok, Marshall Islands, where from March through May 1954 she participated in atomic tests at the Pacific Proving Grounds. During \\"Operation Castle\\", a nuclear underwater test, she gathered fallout data and carried out experimental ship protection studies. After returning to San Francisco, California, she was placed out of service from June until February 1955. In May, YAG-39 again served with Joint Task Force 7 during \\"Operation Wigwam\\", the deep underwater nuclear test carried out in the Eastern Pacific. During the next 10 months she operated between the West Coast and Hawaii, and conducted various experimental tests before returning to Eniwetok on 8 April 1956 to participate in additional nuclear tests. From 21 May to 23 July she took part in four nuclear-proving tests and gathered scientific data to advance knowledge of the atom and the effects of nuclear fission. Departing Eniwetok on 28 July, YAG-39 steamed via Pearl Harbor to San Francisco, California, where she arrived on 16 August. After receiving additional scientific equipment, she departed San Francisco on 6 February 1957 to resume experimental operations off the California coast. During the next few months she steamed with while testing advanced weapons and ship protection systems. Towed to San Diego, California, 21 October for inactivation, she was placed out of service on 1 November and assigned to the Pacific Reserve Fleet at San Diego.  Project 112 and Project SHAD  Reactivated in 1962, YAG-39 commissioned at San Francisco, California, on 20 October, with Lt. Comdr. William G. Sternberg in command. With her sister ship, YAG-40, she departed San Francisco, California, on 15 November for Pearl Harbor, where she arrived 24 November for underway training. Assigned to Service Squadron 5, she operated off Hawaii and carried out extensive experimental tests in the fields of ship protection systems and scientific warfare analysis. On 3 July 1963 she was assigned her former merchant name, George Eastman. From 1963, USS George Eastman operated as a research ship between the Hawaiian Sea Frontier and the equatorial area of the mid-Pacific, providing valuable support for various scientific research and defense projects of the Department of Defense. She sailed to the West Coast in April 1966 for a three-month overhaul; and, following her return to Pearl Harbor on 18 August, she resumed research cruises in Hawaiian waters. Her support activities continued through 1966 into 1967. This ship participated in the U. S. Navy's Top Secret biological and chemical warfare testing program. Project SHAD, an acronym for Shipboard Hazard and Defense, was part of a larger effort called Project 112, which was conducted during the 1960s. Project SHAD encompassed tests designed to identify U.S. warships' vulnerabilities to attacks with chemical or biological warfare agents and to develop procedures to respond to such attacks while maintaining a war-fighting capability.from 1962 until 1972 when President Nixon officially discontinued the program. The USS George Eastmans sister ship, the also participated as a floating laboratory and administrative command ship in Project SHAD along with five L.T. Tugboats, a submarine and aircraft. Sarin and VX nerve gas were sprayed on the USS George Eastman by the tugs and aircraft as well as E.coli, simulants for biological and chemical agents such as anthrax and a number of other diseases, tracers and mosquitoes. USS George Eastman directly participated in the following Project 112/ Project SHAD tests: * 63-1 Eager Belle I * 63-1 Eager Belle II * 64-2 Flower Drum I * 65-4 Magic Sword * 65-17 Fearless Johnny * 66-13 Half Note  Decommissioning  USS George Eastman was decommissioned (date unknown); struck From the Naval Register (date unknown); disposed of by MARAD sale, on 1 July 1976; and, final disposition, scrapped in 1977.

Somewhat more loosely, one speaks of a dual pair whenever two groups are the mutual centralizers in a larger group, which is frequently a general linear group. The concept was introduced by Roger Howe in . Its strong ties with Classical Invariant Theory are discussed in .  Examples  * The full symplectic group G = Sp(W) and the two-element group G‚Ä≤, the center of Sp(W), form a reductive dual pair. The double centralizer property is clear from the way these groups were defined: the centralizer of the group G in G is its center, and the centralizer of the center of any group is the group itself. The group G‚Ä≤, consists of the identity transformation and its negative, and can be interpreted as the orthogonal group of a one- dimensional vector space. It emerges from the subsequent development of the theory that this pair is a first instance of a general family of dual pairs consisting of a symplectic group and an orthogonal group, which are known as type I irreducible reductive dual pairs. * Let X be an n-dimensional vector space, Y be its dual, and W be the direct sum of X and Y. Then W can be made into a symplectic vector space in a natural way, so that (X, Y) is its lagrangian polarization. The group G is the general linear group GL(X), which acts tautologically on X and contragrediently on Y. The centralizer of G in the symplectic group is the group G‚Ä≤, consisting of linear operators on W that act on X by multiplication by a non-zero scalar Œª and on Y by scalar multiplication by its inverse Œª‚àí1. Then the centralizer of G‚Ä≤, is G, these two groups act completely reducibly on W, and hence form a reductive dual pair. The group G‚Ä≤, can be interpreted as the general linear group of a one- dimensional vector space. This pair is a member of a family of dual pairs consisting of general linear groups known as type II irreducible reductive dual pairs.  Structure theory and classification  The notion of a reductive dual pair makes sense over any field F, which we assume to be fixed throughout. Thus W is a symplectic vector space over F. If W1 and W2 are two symplectic vector spaces and (G1, G‚Ä≤1), (G2, G‚Ä≤2) are two reductive dual pairs in the corresponding symplectic groups, then we may form a new symplectic vector space W = W1 ‚äï W2 and a pair of groups G = G1 √ó G2, G‚Ä≤ = G‚Ä≤1 √ó G‚Ä≤,2 acting on W by isometries. It turns out that (G, G‚Ä≤) is a reductive dual pair. A reductive dual pair is called reducible if it can be obtained in this fashion from smaller groups, and irreducible otherwise. A reducible pair can be decomposed into a direct product of irreducible ones, and for many purposes, it is enough to restrict one's attention to the irreducible case. Several classes of reductive dual pairs had appeared earlier in the work of Andr√© Weil. Roger Howe proved a classification theorem, which states that in the irreducible case, those pairs exhaust all possibilities. An irreducible reductive dual pair (G, G‚Ä≤) in Sp(W) is said to be of type II if there is a lagrangian subspace X in W that is invariant under both G and G‚Ä≤, and of type I otherwise. An archetypical irreducible reductive dual pair of type II consists of a pair of general linear groups and arises as follows. Let U and V be two vector spaces over F, X = U ‚äóF V be their tensor product, and Y = HomF(X, F) its dual. Then the direct sum W = X ‚äï Y can be endowed with a symplectic form such that X and Y are lagrangian subspaces, and the restriction of the symplectic form to X √ó Y ‚äÇ W √ó W coincides with the pairing between the vector space X and its dual Y. If G = GL(U) and G‚Ä≤ = GL(V), then both these groups act linearly on X and Y, the actions preserve the symplectic form on W, and (G, G‚Ä≤) is an irreducible reductive dual pair. Note that X is an invariant lagrangian subspace, hence this dual pair is of type II. An archetypical irreducible reductive dual pair of type I consists of an orthogonal group and a symplectic group and is constructed analogously. Let U be an orthogonal vector space and V be a symplectic vector space over F, and W = U ‚äóF V be their tensor product. The key observation is that W is a symplectic vector space whose bilinear form is obtained from the product of the forms on the tensor factors. Moreover, if G = O(U) and G‚Ä≤ = Sp(V) are the isometry groups of U and V, then they act on W in a natural way, these actions are symplectic, and (G, G‚Ä≤) is an irreducible reductive dual pair of type I. These two constructions produce all irreducible reductive dual pairs over an algebraically closed field F, such as the field C of complex numbers. In general, one can replace vector spaces over F by vector spaces over a division algebra D over F, and proceed similarly to above to construct an irreducible reductive dual pair of type II. For type I, one starts with a division algebra D with involution œÑ, a hermitian form on U, and a skew-hermitian form on V (both of them non-degenerate), and forms their tensor product over D, W = U ‚äóD V. Then W is naturally endowed with a structure of a symplectic vector space over F, the isometry groups of U and V act symplectically on W and form an irreducible reductive dual pair of type I. Roger Howe proved that, up to an isomorphism, any irreducible dual pair arises in this fashion. An explicit list for the case F = R appears in .

Established in 1897, the publisher remained in existence until 1999. In 1897 the Czech National Social Party (no relation to German National Socialism) was founded after a split within the Czechoslavonic Social Democratic Workers' Party. The new party set up a publishing house \\"Knihtisk√°rna n√°rodnƒõ soci√°ln√≠ho dƒõlnictva\\" (\\"Printing press of national socialist workers\\") on July 9, 1897. The party also started a daily, \\"ƒåesk√° demokracie\\" (\\"The Czech Democracy\\"), led by V√°clav Klof√°ƒç, without much of success. In 1907 Jaroslav ≈†alda, a talented worker from the printing press, together with Klof√°ƒç started a new daily \\"ƒåesk√© slovo\\" (\\"The Czech Word\\"). The newspaper proved to be successful and in 1910 the publishing house bought building \\"Hvƒõzda\\" (\\"The Star\\") on the Wenceslaus Square. The company adopted name \\"Melantrich\\" after a renaissance publisher Ji≈ô√≠ Melantrich of Aventino (born Ji≈ô√≠ ƒåern√Ω Ro≈æƒèalovick√Ω; c.1511, Ro≈æƒèalovice - November 19, 1580, Prague). The building was renamed to \\"Melantrich\\" after the 1922 reconstruction. In 1919 the company, obtaining an official permit, started to publish several newspapers and journals (including the first tabloid in the Czech lands, \\"Pra≈æsk√Ω ilustrovan√Ω zpravodaj\\"). In 1924 Melantrich became joint stock company. In 1926 printing press \\"Koppe & Bellmann\\" from Sm√≠chov was acquired. In 1928 a branch in Ostrava was established, in 1934 branch in Brno and later branch in ≈Ωilina. During the 1930s Melantrich got involved in movie production and in commercial graphics. In 1936 a music publishing \\"MelPa\\" (Melantrich + Pazd√≠rek) was established. The spectrum of literature published by Melantrich was very wide and included works by many contemporary Czech writers, such as Bo≈æena Bene≈°ov√°, Jan ƒåep, Jaroslav Durych, Egon Hostovsk√Ω, Josef Kopta, V√≠tƒõzslav Nezval, Ivan Olbracht, and Vladislav Vanƒçura. The circulation of some newspapers and journals reached hundreds of thousands, in few cases (\\"Veƒçern√≠ slovo\\", weekly \\"Svobodn√Ω z√≠t≈ôek\\") more than one million. Led by ≈†alda, Melantrich became the largest publisher in the First Republic of Czechoslovakia. After the Nazi occupation (1939) the company managed to stay in business but ≈†alda was imprisoned (in 1941) and the control was taken over by Nazi collaborators. After the war ≈†alda, unwilling to participate in politics any more, was removed by the party from his executive position. \\"ƒåesk√© slovo\\" was renamed to \\"Svobodn√© slovo\\" (\\"The Free Word\\") in 1945. After the communist takeover of power in 1948 ≈†alda got ousted, the company nationalized and split into three parts. In 1950 the Czechoslovak Socialist Party (the party changed its name) was granted the right to control the company again while the state remained as the formal owner. (This settlement led to litigations after 1989.) In 1950 the publishing house changed its name to \\"Svobodn√© slovo-Melantrich\\", in 1960 to \\"Svobodn√© slovo\\" and again in 1967 back to \\"Melantrich\\". During the Velvet Revolution (1989) a balcony of Melantrich building served as a tribune for speakers to the masses of protesters gathered on Wenceslaus Square. The socialist party later used this balcony as the main symbol of their (eventually unsuccessful) election campaign in 1990. The first half of the 1990s was spent in disputes and litigations who is the new owner of the company. The newspaper Svobodn√© slovo changed the editor-in-chief many times while the circulation steadily declined. In 1996 Melantrich was bought by a media company, part of the Chemapol group. Svobodn√© slovo was renamed to \\"Slovo\\" (\\"The Word\\") and in 1998 sold out. Chemapol went bankrupt in 1998. The publishing house was, like many other large traditional publishers in the Czech Republic, unable to compete and closed down in 1999. Afterwards, the Melantrich building was turned into a luxurious hotel.

The ground was used for football club Hull City between 1906 and 1939. The record attendance was 32,000 in a FA Cup game against Newcastle United. The stands were bombed during the Second World War but Hull City used the site for training and reserve matches until 1965, when a railway line was built over the pitch.  History  Hull City football club played its first game at Dairycoates then seventeen games at The Circle cricket ground. The club then moved to their own ground, Anlaby Road adjacent to the Circle. The ground was opened on 24 March 1906 with 2,000 spectators in covered stand for the visit of Blackpool, which ended in a 2‚Äì2 draw. The covered stand was extended to 8,000 by the start of the 1907‚Äì08 season with a further 8,000 capacity of uncovered terrace. The season passes for the first season cost one guinea (¬£1‚Äì1s‚Äì0d/¬£1.05). Over the next few years, parts of the north and east stands were covered over despite wind damage to several sections of the stand. On Easter Monday 1914, a few hours after a 0‚Äì2 defeat at home to Bury, a fire destroyed the main stand and it was only the considerable efforts of the fire brigade that prevented the destruction of the north stand too. The cause was never determined though speculation included a carelessly discarded cigarette, arson and even the actions of suffragettes. The stand was replaced in the summer with a new brick and steel structure provided largely through the generosity of one of Hull City's directors, Bob Mungall. On 21 April 1934 after a 1‚Äì0 home defeat by Preston North End a crowd incident resulted in the ground being closed for the first fourteen days of the 1934‚Äì35 season. Hull City suspended their operations in 1941 as a result of the war. The ground was damaged during the Blitz of Hull and estimated repair costs were in the region of ¬£1,000. At the same time, the cricket club had been served notice to quit and in 1943, the tenancy was officially ended. The team then moved to Boothferry Park.  After closure  Although the Hull City first team never played at Anlaby Road again, football was played at the Circle until 1965. This included several war time fixtures, two seasons of use by Hull Amateurs and Junior matches for Hull City. The last game at the ground was played on 20 April 1965 and two days later it was demolished to make way for a section of rail track to link the East Coast line to Scarborough and allow the removal of three level crossings.Anlaby Road Website Hull City AFC, along with Hull rugby league club, moved to the new Kingston Communications Stadium built on the land at Hull Circle in December 2002.

Before getting there, it had to go through many steps such as the formation of a corporation in 1967 by a group of promoters in the area. A subscription campaign enabled them to collect the money necessary to buy the land and to start preparing the first runs on the mount that had the original name of \\"Mont Camille\\". Because they did not have the money necessary to buy the equipment necessary to maintain the runs, they called on snowmobilers to \\"groom\\" the runs with tree trunks. Because it was more or less effective, they borrowed $3500 to buy a \\"Muskeg\\" to maintain the runs with farm rollers. In 1972, they installed the first mechanical lift in the four school runs, the T-Bar. In the fall of 1973 they installed the first chairlift and five new runs. In its first year of operation in 1973, the Parc du Mont-Comi operated with an approximated budget of $85,000 and had six employees. At that time, a day pass cost $2.50 for an adult and $1.50 for a student. The operations budget had a major growth in the '80s to about 1.3 million dollars. Because one of the objectives of the Parc du Mont-Comi was to render available to everyone services and equipment for outdoor activities year-round, in summer of 1975 it opened the \\"Camp Soleil et Verdure\\". The presence of the camp brought a lot to the center. Many infrastructures (dormitories, welcome chalet) were built and subsidized because of the camp. Over the years, many employees and many volunteers contributed to the development of the Parc du Mont-Comi. In fact, the second general director (1985‚Äì1989) was M. Guy Desrosiers, who is now general director of Mont-Ste-Anne. =Second Chance= In May 1998, the Parc du Mont-Comi corporation declared bankruptcy because of accumulated debt. The mountain was then bought by M. Denis Roussel and his brothers in September 1998. M. Roussel had worked at the Parc du Mont-Comi since he was 15 years old. He went from Chairlift Operator to Director of Mountain Operations. He was born and grew up at the base of the mountain. The land around Mont-Comi belonged to his father Xavier Roussel. For the love of the mountain he gave it a second chance. Ski Boom Since its opening in 1973, every year there is the annual party called the Ski Boom. It is held on the Saturday before Easter weekend and it is characterized by the fact that all skiers must dress-up. A costume contest is organized. There are also many other activities throughout the day. Runs There are 26 maintained runs and 5 back country trails. It has a run \\"Le Mur\\" that is at 35¬∞. There is no night skiing. Telemark The Telemark club is now at its 24th season ('06‚Äì'07). Its objective is to facilitate exchanges between adepts of this style of skiing and to support the development of telemark. Its structure is simplified to the maximum with only a coordinator and some people responsible for specific activities. =Telemark Festival= The Telemark club also organizes one of the biggest telemark festivals in Eastern Canada which offers clinics in different areas such as moguls, off-trail and also has clinics for beginners who just want to try out telemark for a weekend.

He was one of the principal assistants in Rubens' studio in the 1630s. He later traveled to Italy where he resided for a decade in Rome. He subsequently worked as a court painter in Vienna and Brussels. Jan van den Hoecke was a versatile artist who created portraits as well as history and allegorical paintings.Matthias Depoorter, Jan van den Hoecke at Barok in Vlaanderen Life Amor vincit omnia, a collaboration with Paul de Vos Jan van den Hoecke was born in Antwerp as the son of the painter Gaspar van den Hoecke (1595‚Äì1648) and Margaretha van Leemput. It is believed that, like his half-brother Robert van den Hoecke, he first apprenticed with his father.Frans Jozef Peter Van den Branden, Geschiedenis der Antwerpsche schilderschool, Antwerpen, 1883, pp. 794‚Äì796 He then worked in the studio of Peter Paul Rubens in the 1630s. While he was at Rubens' studio he was a frequent collaborator on various major projects of Rubens. He is believed to have collaborated with Rubens on the ceiling decorations for the Banqueting Hall.Jahel Sanzsalazar, Jan van den Hoecke: quelques pr√©cisions et nouvelles propositions pour le catalogue de son oeuvre, Revue Belge d'Arch√©ologie et d'Histoire de l'Art / Belgish tijdschrift voor Oudheidkunde en Kunstgeschiedenis, 82 (2013), pp. 45‚Äì78 Together with his father, Jan contributed to the decorations for the Joyous Entry of Cardinal- infant Ferdinand in Antwerp on 17 April 1635, the overall artistic design of which was under the direction of Rubens. Jan painted monumental representations for this occasion after designs by Rubens. Of these large- scale works some have been preserved such as the Triumphal Entrance of Cardinal Prince Ferdinand of Spain (Uffizi Gallery) and The Battle of N√∂rdlingen, 1634 (Royal Collection). It is known that the latter work, which celebrates the Cardinal-Infant‚Äôs victory over a Swedish army at the Battle of N√∂rdlingen of 1634 was painted by van den Hoecke after an oil sketch by Rubens. It was placed at a central position in the centre of the front of the Arch of Ferdinand during the Joyous Entry. It remained outside for a few months after the event during which it was exposed to the natural elements. As van der Hoecke was in Italy by this time, Jacob Jordaens carried out some re- touching of the canvas in 1636 before it was offered to Cardinal-Infant Ferdinand in 1637.Jan van der Hoecke (Antwerp 1611 ‚Äì Antwerp or Brussels 1651), The Battle of N√∂rdlingen, 1634 at the Royal Collection Hercules between Vice and Virtue, Uffizi Jan van den Hoecke travelled to Italy where he resided likely from 1635 to 1644 although some extend the period of his stay to 1646.Jan van den Hoecke at the Netherlands Institute for Art History In Italy he seems to have become familiar with the paintings of Guido Reni and studied the antique. These influences explain the classicizing trends in his later work.G√ºnther Heinz. \\"Hoecke, Jan van den.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 17 July 2014 In 1644, the artist was accepted in Rome as a member of a select club, the Virtuosi al Pantheon. Van den Hoecke moved to Austria and entered the service of Emperor Ferdinand III in 1644. He also painted for Ferdinand‚Äôs brother, Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria (1614‚Äì1662), including a Madonna and Child and a number of allegorical pieces. Van den Hoecke returned to his home country with Archduke Leopold Wilhelm when the latter became the governor of the Southern Netherlands in 1647.Karl Sch√ºtz, Zeitgen√∂ssische niederl√§ndische Malerei in der Sammlung Erzherzog Leopold Wilhelms, in: De zeventiende eeuw. Jaargang 13. Uitgeverij Verloren, Hilversum 1997, pp. 371‚Äì377 He was at the same time a court painter and the conservator of the art collection of the Archduke, which was reported to be one of the largest in Northern Europe and comprised about 1,400 paintings and other artworks. He died in Antwerp or Brussels. Work =General= Equestrian portrait of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm Van den Hoecke was a versatile artist producing historical paintings as well as portraits and designs for tapestries. His work combined the achievements of the art of Rubens with 17th-century Italian Classicism. The artist and his work have only started to attract renewed attention from art historians since the 1970s. A better understanding of the characteristics of his style have led to the re- attribution to van den Hoecke of works earlier given to other collaborators of Rubens such as Erasmus Quellinus II and Jan Boeckhorst and tentative attributions of work earlier given to Theodoor van Thulden. Conversely, the increased knowledge of his unique style has also led to the attribution to other painters of works earlier given to van den Hoecke. There were 45 paintings of van den Hoecke in the Archduke's collection. This was the largest number of paintings of a Flemish artist in the collection. About half of these works found their way to the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna as the collection was moved to Vienna when the Archduke returned to his home country. The large number of van den Hoecke paintings in the collection is probably due to the Archduke‚Äôs preference for the more classicistic style of van den Hoecke. The Archduke also commissioned van den Hoecke to paint copies of Italian artists such as Titian and Veronese probably in order to complete the Archduke's collection of Venetian artists.Hans Vlieghe, Katlijne van der Stighelen, 'Sponsors of the past: Flemish art and patronage 1550‚Äì1700 : proceedings of the symposium organized at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, December 14‚Äì15, 2001, Faculteit Letteren, Departement Archeologie, Kunstwetenschap en Musicologie,' Katholieke Universiteit te Leuven (1970‚Äì ) Brepols, 2005 =Style= His early style with its precise draughtsmanship and closeness to Rubens can be found in his oil sketch of The Triumph of David (Kimbell Art Museum) (1635) that was for a long time regarded as a work by Rubens.Kimbell Art Museum, Triumph of David , image of work and background information His Hercules between Vice and Virtue (Uffizi Gallery) shows the influence from both Rubens (particularly Rubens' style between 1610‚Äì1620) and Anthony van Dyck. The closeness of his style to that of Rubens may have led to the attribution in 1780 to van den Hoecke of the Massacre of the Innocents (now attributed to Rubens) when it was in the Liechtenstein Collection.Iain Robertson, The Art Business, Routledge, 28 Aug 2008, pp. 41‚Äì42 Van den Hoecke painted a series of Sibyls which have been attributed to his earlier period from 1630 to 1637.Jan van den Hoecke, Sibylla Cimmeria, 1630 at 1stdibs Flower garland surrounding a portrait of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm The influence of Reni‚Äôs idealized figure types as well as of Domenichino and Poussin (see the Virtue Overcoming Avarice of 1637) are visible in the allegorical paintings he produced in Vienna. An example is the Virtue Overcoming Avarice in the Kunsthistorisches Museum. His familiarity with the work of Andrea Sacchi is reflected in his portraits of Emperor Ferdinand III and Archduke Leopold William. His style retained a certain reticence and a stiffness of composition as reflected in his Equestrian portrait of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm the static composition of which is clearly different from the lively equestrian portraits by Rubens and Anthony van Dyck. A portrait of Ferdinand III (Kunsthistorisches Museum) painted at around 1643 shows the same unadorned and austere appearance and contrasts sharply with the glorious and militant portraits of the Flemish Baroque of the 1630s.Dr Andrew H Weaver, 'Sacred Music as Public Image for Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand III: Representing the Counter-Reformation Monarch at the End of the Thirty Years' War', Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 28 Jan 2013, pp. 34‚Äì35 =Collaborations= As was common in the Flemish art scene at the time, van den Hoecke collaborated with other painters who were specialised in a particular genre. An example is the Amor vincit omnia (Kunsthistorisches Museum), in which the figure of Cupid was painted by van den Hoecke and the still life elements by Paul de Vos. It is not clear whether the composition is an allegory of peace, as suggested by the figure of Cupid and the traditional title, or rather an allegory of transience (vanities), as indicated by the motifs of the money bag, the armour and the musical instruments. Some of these collaborations involved the creation of so-called 'garland paintings'. Garland paintings are a type of still life invented in early 17th century Antwerp by Jan Brueghel the Elder and later developed further by Flemish still life painters such as Daniel Seghers. This style of painting typically shows a flower or a fruit garland around a devotional image or portrait. In the later development of the genre, the devotional image was replaced by other subjects such as portraits, mythological figures and allegorical scenes.Susan Merriam, Seventeenth-Century Flemish Garland Paintings. Still Life, Vision and the Devotional Image, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2012David Freedberg, \\"The Origins and Rise of the Flemish Madonnas in Flower Garlands, Decoration and Devotion\\", M√ºnchener Jahrbuch der bildenden Kunst, xxxii, 1981, pp. 115‚Äì150. An example of a collaboration by van den Hoecke on a garland painting is the Flower garland surrounding a portrait of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm (Uffizi Gallery). In this work Daniel Seghers painted the flowers and van den Hoecke the illusionistic bust of the Archduke.Ghirlanda di fiori con il ritratto dell'arciduca Leopoldo Guglielmo at the Uffize website =Tapestry designs= The triumph of time For Archduke Leopold Wilhelm, van den Hoecke further designed the pattern boards for a series of 12 wall tapestries on the motif of vanitas and a series of ten tapestries under the title 'Allegory of Time' (c. 1650): Day and Night, six pictures of The Months, the Four Seasons, the Four Elements and the Triumph of Time. The series of the Allegory of Time was woven between 1647 and 1650 in the Brussels tapestry workshop of Everaert Leyniers III. Several other artists such as Pieter Thijs and Adriaen van Utrecht also worked on the series. Ten preparatory oil sketches (\\"modelli\\") that van den Hoecke made for the series have survived (four in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna), as have eight tapestries based on the designs for Day and Night and The Months. Four of the modelli for The Months are now in the Miramare Castle in Trieste.Thomas P. Campbell, Pascal-Fran√ßois Bertrand, Jeri Bapasola, 'Tapestry in the Baroque: Threads of Splendor', Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1 January 2007 The cartoons of van Hoecke for the Allegory of Time series were innovative in that they dispensed with the traditional borders of the tapestries, which he replaced by elements of the picture such as piers, entablature and foreground step of the architecture as well as with sumptuous festoons of game, fowl, fish, flowers and fruit. He was also able to create an illusion of three-dimensional space by extending the architectural elements behind and around the figures. The muted palette of the modelli shows that van den Hoecke was more interested in line and composition than in colour.

It was released on September 15, 2005 in hardcover and August 29, 2006 in paperback. The premise tells the tale of Clark Kent's beginnings into becoming Superman, set in the 1930s, where Clark befriends a wrongly convicted photographer named Willi Berg, and is then taken from Kansas to Hollywood and finally in New York where he meets Lois Lane, fights Lex Luthor, as he debuts in his superhero persona. Despite the setting, this is not about the Golden Age Superman also known as the Superman of Earth-2; as Perry White, the Daily Planet, Lex Luthor's position and his trademark powers (including flight) are not part of that alternate Earth. Rather, it's a Superman period piece set in the 1930s. Plot In Smallville, Kansas, of 1935, Clark Kent is interviewed by the local sheriff over the death of a wanted man that Clark confronted at the local movie theatre. They believe the man died from his handgun firing backwards, but Clark and his father, Jonathan Kent, know the real truth: the man fired his gun at Clark, and the bullet bounced off Clark's forehead, killing the wanted man instead. Clark is scared over what he is becoming, with his father providing no answers to his questions. To make matters worse, Clark's beloved mother, Martha Kent, dies of a terminal illness not soon after. In Manhattan, Willi Berg storms out from his girlfriend, Lois Lane's, apartment over an argument concerning getting his camera from the pawn shop, so he decides to steal it. Arriving, he discovers several men dead, and gets wounded by the gang when he tries to escape after seeing the face of their leader: Lex Luthor, New York's leading Alderman. Lex frames Willi for the murders, with no one believing Willi's truth of the events. A henchwoman attempts to murder Willi at the hospital when she is stopped by federal agents, led by Meyer Lansky. With their help, and Lois's, Willi goes on the run, finding himself in Smallville as a member of the WPA. He meets Clark, now a reporter for the Smallville Herald Progress, and befriends him after he shows off his superspeed. After solving the crime of a kidnapped child that ends tragically, Clark quits the paper and Willi proposes for them to leave Smallville and travel. Because he wants to see what else is out there, Clark agrees. In 1937; Clark has a job as a Hollywood stuntman, and is dating costume designer Diana Dewey. Willi meets with Lois' former roommate, Skinny, where he is found by police and is arrested. Clark tries out a costume that was made for a canceled science fiction film: a blue leotard with a red cape and a red and black \\"S\\". After he discovers his ability to fly, Clark puts on the costume and frees Willi from the police. Clark and Willi head back to New York where they meet back up with Lois, now a reporter for the Daily Planet. Clark falls instantly in love with Lois, and at their new apartment, they describe their ‚Äúfriend‚Äù who freed Willi from the cops: Superman. Lois reveals the case that had been building against Lex Luthor has been dropped, due to the death of the head agent of the case, and the missing evidence. Willi becomes depressed, as the odds his name being cleared for murder now seems impossible. In a shocking turn of events, Lex announces his resignation from his Alderman position, and from his company, LUTHOR Corp., he initiates the construction of weaponized robots dubbed \\"Lexbots\\". On Halloween Night; Clark tries to cheer up Willi as they walk throughout the city. At the same time, Lois joins her former boyfriend, an ex-cop named Ben, when he is called by Ceil Stickowski, widow of one of Lex' old henchmen, who wants to reveal secret information on Luthor's plans. A gun fight occurs outside between them and henchman Paulie Scaffa, who murders Ceil in the process and shoots Ben. Paulie takes off until he is stopped by Clark, wearing his Superman costume. He damages the car to get Paulie out, but it causes a Lexbot to activate from inside the trunk, and attack Superman. After the Lexbot goes haywire, destroying city blocks that leaves several building on fire. a bruised and exhausted Superman finally destroys the robot and escapes when police arrive. Lois is ‚Äúintroduced‚Äù to Superman, while they find a piece of the robot with the LUTHOR Corp. logo on it. Thanks to both that and Clark's article on Superman himself; Lex Luthor is called to be arrested, while Clark gets a job at the Daily Planet. Before he is arrested, Superman meets with Lex at his home; as Lex talks about how similar the two are, making them \\"perfect rivals\\", Lex forces his assistant to jump from the window. Superman saves the assistant, but Luthor escapes. In the closing chapter, the central characters watch the play Our Town in February 1938, while Clark reflects on what has happened to him and Superman since that night. While he has saved countless lives, and was given a new more powerful costume with a red and yellow \\"S\\" by a still on the run Lex Luthor, Clark sometimes hates his Superman persona because of the pressures put upon him. He is reluctant to have a chat with FDR, and is heartbroken that Lois dislikes Clark but loves Superman. As the play ends, he thinks of what his father said to him just before he passed away recently; to use his powers for good, as not doing so wouldn't be fair for everyone. Lois notices Clark sobbing in his theater box and, surprised by her own concern, calls out to him. She finally gains his attention by throwing a shoe at him, and when she sees Clark takes off his glasses, she develops the classic suspicion that Clark and Superman are one and the same. At the same time, Clark realizes that he will love her for the rest of his life and that love will fuel him to do his best for the world. He has struggled through the entire book to feel \\"like everyone else\\", and now, he is \\"like everyone else\\". Main characters * Clark Kent is the protagonist, who later goes by the alter ego of Superman. The adopted son of farmers Jonathan and Martha Kent, Clark is a shy, quiet and insecure young man who feels \\"there\\" in society because of his alienation. He possesses \\"talents\\" such as super strength, speed, flight, and much more. No matter how many people he is surrounded by, he feels alone. This is because he feels that they can not relate to him (ironically the only person who does is his nemesis, Lex Luthor). Unlike most mythos, Clark is given a more \\"human\\" approach, much like an \\"everyman\\", that subjects him with the same humane actions and temptations that would go against his comic book counterpart, while still not astraying from his \\"boy scout\\" image. Examples include an angsty brooding nature more reminiscent of Batman than Superman; and moments where he breaks the law and uses his powers to his advantage. Also unlike the mythos, Clark is unaware of his Kryptonian origins. Instead, he at one point recalls a dream where a planet is dying of old age and a scientist and his wife send their son off to a rocket ship. Plus, he is jokingly told by his father that he came \\"from a \\"wagon\\", suggesting it might have been an airship that dropped a bomb (under this assumption, they do not understand why a bomb would contain a baby). But it is Clark who suggests to his denying father, that he must be an alien from another planet. * Willi Berg is a photographer, Lois Lane's ex-boyfriend, and, eventually, Clark Kent's best friend. Known for his past of getting into trouble; no one believes him when he is accused of murder, saying he was framed by Lex Luthor, New York's alderman. He is saved by the FBI, and with the help of Lois, gets a job with the WPA, where he meets Clark. It is because of Willi that Clark develops his powers, leaves Smallville, and he and Clark together create Clark's dual-identity; making Clark and Superman two separate people. It is alluded that Willi intended to use Clark and his abilities for his own purposes to get him out of the jam he was in, but went against that idea as he was starting to like Clark. Willi dyes his hair red while on the lam, making him reminiscent of the Daily Planet's red-headed photographer, Jimmy Olsen (who does not appear in this book, though was going to be Willi's false identity when he was on the run in the original proposal). * Lois Lane begins as a student at Columbia University journalism school, before becoming a reporter for the Daily Planet. Described as a \\"pistol\\" by the novel's reviewers, Lois will do anything to get the story, including getting the dirt on Lex Luthor, and will not let anything or anyone stop her in the male- dominated journalistic world. Her intelligence, self-confidence and beauty attract an impressive number of men, including Willi Berg and Ben Jaeger. She is an army brat; with the man she grew up being a hard-nosed retired army captain (in the comics, he is a general). She occasionally fears she will never meet a man where the relationship lasts, and she isn't put down because she is a woman. Her relationship with Clark is complicated; as she knows she can easily have him, she expresses disinterest and sometimes scorn when he asks her out. She always makes jokes about him, but she does not mean it, and she is not as cold-hearted as she makes herself appear. * Lex Luthor is the main antagonist, an alderman in New York, and in charge of his company, LUTHOR Corp. Luthor is the man responsible for framing Willi Berg after he is spotted at the murder scene of a pawn shop owner. Under his respectable disguise of an alderman, Lex secretly runs a criminal empire from within Manhattan, his connections allowing him to evade the long arm of the law. Lex's criminal actions are motivated, at least in part, by trying to outrun the memory of his father, himself a fugitive who lived in fear of being caught. Lex is embarrassed by his drunken, painfully honest mother, so much so, that after her funeral he confesses to her headstone that he never loved her. Despite his ruthlessness, Lex is the epitome of social grace; no racial slurs or coarse language are tolerated in his ranks. The connection between Lex and Clark/Superman is founded on how similar the two characters are revealed to be; not only in the outward \\"face\\" each presents to the world but the feelings of isolation which motivate those deceptions. * Jonathan and Martha Kent are the owners of their self-named farm, as well as the loving parents of their adopted son, Clark. Before Clark came into their lives, the Kents could not conceive, and Jonathan felt happy about that, due to his past with his own father to whom he disrespected. Because of Clark being \\"different\\", Jonathan could not help nor understand what must have been going in Clark's mind to answer his questions, making Jonathan feel as if he had been a bad father. All evidence, however, points to him as the opposite: a patient and loving man who gives Clark his moral conscience (and a few grammar lessons); Jonathan's encouragement becomes one of the reasons he becomes Superman, and why he stays being Superman even after experiencing some fears. Martha dies early in the novel, but her presence is still felt through the minds of both Clark and Jonathan; mentioning her background, her faith, and her past as a pioneer woman. Jonathan follows suit near the end and dies too; just like his wife, it appears to be of natural causes, hastened, it appears, by the loneliness brought on by Martha's death and Clark's departure for the wider world. Other characters Sheriff Bill Dutcher, is the Sheriff of the county in which Smallville, Kansas is located. His duty is dealing with the crimes that occur in the unincorporated county area surrounding Smallville; two of which feature and involve Clark Kent. He is sometimes accompanied by other law enforcement officers, such as Doug Parker, Smallville's local Chief of Police, and later with FBI Agent Foley. Jiggs Markley and the Markley Gang are criminals on the FBI's most wanted list who find themselves in Smallville, Kansas. Jiggs is killed by what the Sheriffs of Smallville believe his gun firing backwards while confronting Clark Kent at the Jewel movie theatre (in reality, the bullet bounced off Clark's forehead). Three others from the gang, made up by Ike \\"Curly Ike\\" Kelting, Milt George, and Claude Draper, later kidnap and murder the child of a banker they were holding for ransom. The gang is later taken down, while Ike is killed in a car crash caused by Clark, covering the incident for his town's newspaper. All others from the gang are mentioned to have fled to Mexico. Alger Lee is a young African-American man, who first appears working for the Jewel movie theatre, and later at the Kent Farm (like his father did) when Clark starts moving on away and Jonathan Kent becomes weaker due to old age. Alger knows Clark, and knows Clark can do things no other man can do, but keeps it a secret just like Willi. It is assumed that, after the passing of Jonathan Kent, that Alger and his family get the farm thanks to their generosity. Paulie Scaffa and Herman \\"Sticky\\" Stickowski are two of Lex Luthor's well-known henchmen. They perform their duties however Lex wants them to do them, and try not to get their boss angry at either one of them from whatever mistakes they make on purpose or not. Paulie is the son of a father who does not appreciate anything he does, even after showing him a Lexbot robot. Because of that, he hates his father. Sticky, already terminally ill, is smothered to death by Lex, who then offers his wife, Ceil, a job managing a brothel. Ceil Stickowski continues to nearly worship Lex until, near the end of the novel, she realizes he murdered her beloved husband. She is later killed by Paulie when Mrs. O'Shea learns that Ceil is about to spill all she know about Lex's robots to Lois Lane during a fight between Superman and a Lexbot the thug has foolishly hidden in the trunk of his car. Skinny Simon is a friend of Willi and Lois, and is ironically nicknamed Skinny because of her voluptuous figure. She works at a hospital in Manhattan and is the first to tell Lois when Willi is shot. Later, she and Willi meet in Hollywood where she is almost murdered by her husband. Despite these ordeals, she perseveres and eventually finds herself back in New York. She eventually marries Ben Jaeger. Dick Sandglass is a New York City detective; has a son nicknamed Spider, and is admired by both Willi Berg and his fellow partner, Ben Jaeger. He spends two years investigating the link between a \\"ghost gang of criminals\\" and Alderman Lex Luthor. Because of his investigation; Sandglass is later murdered by Luthor's men, and his son dies afterward while trying to rescue his father. Caesar Colluzo is a self-taught engineer who is hired by Lex Luthor to design ultra-powerful, omnipresent robots. After the creation of the Lexbots are a success; Lex murders Caesar so that he will not reveal Lex's secrets. Diana Dewey is briefly Clark's girlfriend - and his first lover - when he is living in Hollywood, California, working as a stuntman. A former actress; Diana is a costume designer for various movies, one was of which that becomes cancelled was going to be \\"The Saucer Man from Saturn\\". Clark tries out the only outfit made for the film which later becomes the Superman costume. By the time Clark and Willi are in New York, Diana is never seen again. One idea is that Diana might've seemed uncomfortable after Clark revealed what he could do and later after he freed Willi from jail was possibly eager to rid herself of Clark; but there is no evidence to support that theory. The only thing the novel does is that, once Clark meets and is smitten by Lois Lane, he doesn't seem to remember Diana at all. Ben Jaeger is a New York City cop, a protegee of Dick Sandglass, and the boyfriend (later ex-boyfriend) of Lois Lane. After the death of his mentor, Sandglass; Jaeger is hit hard and becomes obsessed with nailing. Even during this obsession, he brings Lois candy, but she is put off by his intense, brooding, single-minded demeanor. He is shot in the chest twice by Paulie and nearly dies, but later recovers, and finds a new lease on life working at the theatre with his first gig being involved with the play Our Town. Helen O'Shea (mainly called Mrs. O'Shea) is Lex Luthor's personal assistant, but after she murders the son of Dick Sandglass, she becomes Lex' full partner and his lover. Her husband, Denholm is serving a 50-year prison sentence for murdering a union organizer with a shed cutter. Lex met O'Shea after she was sent to the House of Detention for Women in Greenwich Village, and has been working for him since. Once she realizes Ceil Stickowski is going to inform Lois Lane on Luthor's Lexbots, she goes out to kill her, only to be killed herself by Paulie Scaffa, one of Lex's henchmen, who also kills Ceil. Edith \\"Soda\\" Wauters is a singer and owner of a jazz music club named after her nickname, and the mistress of late Dick Sandglass. A twice divorcee; Soda fell in love at first sight toward Sandglass (though he never told her his last name, and lied saying he was not a cop). She is devastated when he stops coming around, eventually realizing he is dead. It is only when she remembers the package he left for her to keep safe (a copy of the same one that was to be used against Lex Luthor, but was destroyed after Sandglass was murdered) that a drunken Soda heads out and after some dead ends, makes it to the Daily Planet the next day, where she meets Clark Kent. She and Clark later become friends; as evidenced by Clark's birthday present to her by taking her to see \\"Out Town\\", and by Soda dedicating the song \\"Someone to Watch Over Me\\" anytime he visits her club. Background After the release of his 1985 book, Funny Papers, Tom De Haven began working on the novella Sunborn Lake. From the work done in creating it, De Haven ended up falling in love with the 1930s, the period the first of his novellas was set in. After the release of Derby Dugan Depression Funnies, the sequel to Funny Papers, in 1996, De Haven got a call from DC, asking if he would be interested in doing a Superman novel set in the same period as Depression Funnies, the 1930s. De Haven was honored at first, because of the iconic nature of the character, but on the other hand felt unsure as he would not own the copyright as he had done for his previous works. Nevertheless, he accepted the job. However, he was already committed in writing Dugan Under Ground, and wanted to finish that first. DC agreed, even though that novel was finally published in September 2001, four years later. During that time, DC gave De Haven copies of Superman's early stories found in the pages of DC Archive Editions, for the writer to study. For De Haven, he wanted It's Superman! to be a straight adult novel, with little irony, and very real world (New York instead of the more famous Metropolis), as much as he wanted the Clark Kent/Superman who was an average Joe like Jerry Siegel's and Joe Shuster's version. A coming of age story where everything that made up the 1930s, religion, politics, or the world, influenced the mind of our main character. It was De Haven's idea to end the story with Clark ready to experience his life experiences as Superman, different from similar stories of the norm where everything is all set in the end. This was done for readers to easily have confidence in Clark because of the story's main events as the book closes. After De Haven's pitch proposal, Chronicle Books made the offer to publish the novel. Even with the contract to finish the manuscript within one year, it ended up taking up to two-and-a-half years to complete. The finished manuscript ran up to 1000 pages long and De Haven was allowed more time to cut the book down to a more reasonable page length in early 2005. Elements that were removed included the backstory on Lex Luthor, a subplot involving a Russian spy after Luthor's \\"Lexbot\\" plans, more about Diana Dewey, Clark's girlfriend from Hollywood, more on Martha Kent, and more. Losing the material was not missed on De Haven's part, as it made the book shorter, or as he put it, \\"faster than a speeding bullet.\\" Response Reviews of It's Superman! were overall generally positive. Readers applauded the 1930s details, from movies to even the brands of cigarettes, as well as the book's nature to \\"suck them into\\" the story. The New York Times described the novel as \\"Delightful with energy and imagination\\", and Entertainment Weekly stated that the book is \\"textured with authentic faces, places, and attitudes.\\" Various websites went as far as to put the novel side by side with non-superhero novels such as The Grapes of Wrath and The Outsiders. Comic Geek Speak, a fan podcast dealing with comics and other media, did an episode about the novel, where De Haven was also a guest. The novel was praised by the podcast, where the hosts stated that they liked the novel's story being original, and the depiction of Clark, where he was seen as \\"..a much more 'human' Clark than we are used to seeing in comics and other media.\\" It was also brought up that this novel alone had gotten every one of the hosts interested in other novels based on comic books and superheroes, noting Batman: The Ultimate Evil as one example. Some reviewers though felt the opposite, to which De Haven described in his entry on the Thunder Child website that he felt those readers \\"didn't get it\\". One example was from Superman Homepage.com; while one reviewer gave the novel a positive review, the other reviewer gave a negative one, feeling that, regardless of how intelligent the novel was, it should have been a superhero novel, and thus felt ripped off. The reviewer noted that there was only one battle in the book, and the actions Clark/Superman does in the novel were not \\"Superman-like\\", and went as far as to say the character was stupid. Those alone were defended by De Haven himself from the Thunder Child website, where he described that he was in \\"disgust\\" over the negative comments, and he explained that: \\"he is a young man who grew up in his time and his place and was educated according to the theories and with the tools of that context. (He went to Smallville High, not Phillips Exeter Academy, for crying out loud.) He worries that he's not smart enough to do the things that he wants to do, feels he should do, but he manages to put aside, if never completely overcome, those feelings of inadequacy, and to me that's heroic. Why would anyone think a 17-20 year old kid from a tiny farming town in eastern Kansas would move out into the greater world and immediately, instinctively believe he could compete with a big-city politician like Lex Luthor or engage in an easygoing man-to- man conversation with the President of the United States?\\" Comic Geek Speak joined De Haven in his comments, with co-host Bryan Deemer saying that he liked It's Superman!'s Clark because he himself was tired of seeing Clark as the \\"perfect angel\\" all the time; adding that Clark's actions made sense for him to do because he was a kid, and it will still lead him into the boy scout he will soon evolve into. Also, co-host Peter Rios pointed out that he saw the scenes where the doubtful Clark did not \\"get it\\", as scenes where Clark came across as \\"alien...which is exactly what he is.\\" References External links *It's Superman! from Chronicle Books *Comic Geek Speak interview with Tom De Haven on It's Superman!

Inc., which is also known as Volunteers for Adult Literacy in Florida (VALF), is a nonprofit organization which provides training, technical assistance and grants for volunteer literacy programs.  History  Starting in 2008, the organization started a small grant program for members. In August 2008, Literacy Florida! Inc., was renamed Volunteers for Adult Literacy in Florida. VALF provides grants, training, and technical support for adult and family literacy programs using trained volunteers.  Operations  According to this organization, around 74 million adults in the United States lack minimum literacy skills; one in five adults is still not literate and two-thirds of them are women. Statistics on Florida can be found at the Florida Literacy Coalition. VALF provides information and services to Florida literacy volunteers and providers in program management, adult learner persistence, communications and networking, technical assistance and training, public affairs, advocacy, and student leadership. VALF is a member of ProLiteracy Worldwide. Agencies running volunteer literacy programs include libraries, churches, school systems, and colleges. Civic clubs such as Altrusa have a history of supporting literacy and some of clubs have helped adult literacy programs get started. Florida's volunteer literacy programs reach adults who read at the lowest reading level and those needing help learning English. Programs are administered through public libraries such as the Jacksonville Public Library (Florida) or by independent nonprofit groups. Potential volunteers do not need to have teaching experience. Those who tutor conversational English do not need to know a foreign language. Most programs require volunteers to attend a tutor training workshop on basic reading workshop or on English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) to learn how to tutor. Some programs provide combined workshop. Each program develops their own criteria for participation, but tutors are often required to be 18 years old and have a high school diploma. Most must attend an initial training and participate in in-service opportunities and agree to tutor weekly for six months to a year. Well organized programs provide ongoing support for tutors and students. Programs also use volunteers as tutor trainers, in administrative functions and for tutor and student support. VALF holds their annual meeting at the Florida Literacy Conference which is sponsored by the Florida Literacy Coalition Florida Literacy Coalition in the spring.

Browne is known for his zeal in defending his clients, his flair for garnering media attention, and for being know as the ‚Äúplead guilty to avoid the death penalty‚Äù lawyer. He has represented defendants in a number of high-profile cases, including serial killer Ted Bundy, Colton Harris-Moore (also known as \\"The Barefoot Bandit\\"), Benjamin Ng and Martin Pang. He has tried over 250 criminal cases to verdict. Browne and his actions have been the subject of some controversy, and he has sometimes been criticized for his peculiar and combative style both in and out of the courtroom. He is particularly known for obtaining sympathetic treatment for his clients by shifting the focus away from the serious crimes that were committed by arguing for consideration of the background of the defendant and the circumstances in which the events took place. Particular cases In May 2011, Browne defended Christopher Scott Wilson in the case of the murder of Mackenzie Cowell. Wilson was charged with first-degree murder. Prosecutors accused Wilson of having a fascination with death and compared him to the fictional serial killer Dexter Morgan from the TV series Dexter. As part of a plea bargain, Wilson pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to 14 years in prison. On March 14, 2012, Browne took the case of Staff Sgt. Robert Bales, the U.S. soldier accused of murdering 16 Afghan citizens (mostly women and children) in an incident known as the Kandahar massacre. Browne defended Bales alongside military lawyers. Browne described Bales as \\"mild-mannered\\", and claimed his client was upset after seeing a friend's leg blown off the day before the killings, but held no animosity toward Muslims. Browne said \\"I think the message for the public in general is that he's one of our boys and they need to treat him fairly.\\" Browne also criticized anonymous reports from government officials, stating \\"the government is going to want to blame this on an individual rather than blame it on the war.\\" In order to avoid the death penalty, Bales pleaded guilty to sixteen counts of murder and six counts of assault and attempted murder in a plea deal. On August 23, 2013, he was sentenced to life in prison without parole. Browne's client Colton Harris- Moore was accused of at least 67 crimes in a long-running crime spree spanning several U.S. states, Canada, and the Bahamas. The crimes included burglaries and thefts of cars, boats, airplanes, store property, and personal property. By arguing for consideration of Harris-Moore's abusive upbringing, Browne was able to arrange a plea bargain involving a -year prison sentence, which was less severe than was generally expected in this highly publicized case. In 2011, when representing a client Dominic Briceno against drug dealing charges, Browne got into a significant dispute with the judge in the case and made various accusations against the judge. A mistrial was declared, and the judge later died before the issues were resolved. On behalf of David Wayne Kunze, Browne convinced a Washington state appeals court to overturn the murder conviction for the first man ever convicted based on forensic \\"earprint\\" evidence. He also defended Ted Bundy.Oversight of crime-lab staff has often been lax, Seattle P.I. After winning Kunze a new trial, he discredited a key witness and convinced prosecutors to drop all charges and set Kunze free in 2001. Browne also gained nationwide attention as lead plaintiff in a lawsuit filed in 2007 by class action lawyer Steve Berman against Avvo, a law-related review site. He was reportedly upset that the site had rated him \\"average\\" via a rating system that considered disciplinary actions that had been taken against attorneys. He claimed that the rating system was deceptive, not based on any valid criteria, and not reliable. Browne had previously been sanctioned by state disciplinary authorities. The suit against Avvo was dismissed on pre- trial motion, on grounds that the ratings were expressions of opinion protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. In 2006, the Washington State Bar admonished Browne as part of a settlement of ethics charges stemming from compensation issues, saying that he charged more than what had been arranged in a written agreement.Respected lawyer wants rating site Avvo closed, Seattle Post Intelligencer. Such an admonition was the lowest form of Bar disciplinary action. Browne said that an assistant had prepared the written agreement and he had not known about it. In 1995, Martin Pang set fire to his parents' frozen foods processing business ‚Äì resulting in the deaths of four firefighters with the Seattle Fire Department ‚Äì and fled to Brazil, where Browne successfully argued before the Brazilian Supreme Court that treaty law required that Pang could only be extradited if he was not charged with murder. As a result, King County Prosecutor, Norm Maleng was forced to drop the initial charges of first degree arson and four counts of first degree murder and no longer seek the death penalty, thus sparing Pang a potential death sentence. Browne was less successful in representing his client Darrell Cloud, who was accused in 1994 of murdering his former middle- school teacher with an assault rifle after years of sexual abuse. Browne guided his client in rejecting a plea bargain offer, and then presented an unsuccessful insanity defense in a jury trial. Cloud was convicted of first degree murder, and later successfully argued that Browne had harmed his ability to conduct plea negotiations by making an unreasonable assessment of his chances of success in the trial (which Browne had described as a 95% chance of a favorable outcome). By blaming Browne's conduct, Cloud was able to obtain a reduced sentence on a lesser charge. His client Benjamin Ng had participated in killing thirteen people in the 1983 incident known as the Wah Mee massacre. Browne was able to avoid his client receiving the death penalty by arguing that Mr. Ng had previously suffered a brain injury.Yardley, William, \\"For Lawyer in Afghan Killings, the Latest in a Series of Challenging Defenses\\", New York Times, March 24, 2012. Browne defended the professional American football player Duke Fergerson of the Seattle Seahawks against a charge of rape, obtaining an acquittal in 1980.

It took place at Annan, Dumfries and Galloway in Scotland. King Edward Balliol had seized the Scottish crown three months earlier after the Battle of Dupplin Moor (10‚Äì11 August 1332). October 1332, Sir Archibald Douglas, Guardian of Scotland, made a truce with Balliol, supposedly to let the Scottish Parliament assemble and decide who their true king was. Emboldened by the truce, Balliol dismissed most of his English troops and moved to Annan, on the north shore of the Solway Firth. He issued two public letters, saying that with the help of England he had reclaimed his kingdom, and acknowledged that Scotland had always been a fief of England. He also promised land for Edward III on the border, including Berwick-on-Tweed, and that he would serve Edward for the rest of his life. In the early morning hours of 16 December 1332, Bruce loyalists led by Sir Archibald Douglas, John Randolph, 3rd Earl of Moray, the future Robert II of Scotland, and Simon Fraser made a surprise attacked on Balliol. Most of Balliol's men were killed, though he himself managed to escape through a hole in the wall, and fled naked on horse to Carlisle, England. The Bruce loyalists were supporters of King David II of Scotland, the eight year old son of Robert the Bruce who had died on 7 June 1329.

Ophir received its Biblical name Ophir, the source of King Solomon's treasures, in 1850 because of the rich gold placer mining in the area. In 1852 it was the center of the local gold mining industry, and the most populous town in the county. It grew to over 500 families by 1853, when a disastrous fire on the 12th of July destroyed the whole town. The town was not rebuilt at the time. Later Ophir became the center of quartz mining in the county. It is remembered at California Historical Landmark #463. The Ophirville post office was open by 1852 and closed in 1866. The Ophir post office opened in 1872 and closed in 1910. The name comes from the Biblical Ophir, the source of King Solomon's treasures. After the gold rush, the area was planted in vineyards and orchards, and during Prohibition just in orchards. Beginning in the 1970s vineyards again returned to the area.

He worked with him for 6 months and worked with two other Utrecht glassworkers before embarking on a Grand Tour in 1620. He did not get far before he was offered work in Arras by the glassworker Peeter Matthys. After six months, he continued on to Paris in 1620, where he worked with the glassworker Chamu. He returned to Utrecht in 1622, where Cornelis Poelenburg taught him to paint.Jan van Bronkhorst biography in De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) by Arnold Houbraken, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature He married Catalijntje van Noort in 1626. He frequented the studio of Gerard van Honthorst. In 1647 he moved to Amsterdam where he created the stained glass windows and the organ doors (almost the only area in a Calvinist church where figurative painting was sometimes allowed) of the Nieuwe Kerk (finished in 1655). He has been described as the last of the great stained glass painters in Holland. Unlike his work for churches, his secular paintings show the influence of Caravaggio, and also show a striking appeal to sensuality. Among his pupils are counted his sons Jan Jansz and Gerrit Jansz, and Cesar van Everdingen.

(Ed) 1992. Stewart and Corry's Flora of the North-east of Ireland. Institute of Irish Studies, The Queen's University of Belfast or (in North America) shining geranium or shiny geranium, is a herbaceous annual plant of the genus Geranium. It is native to Europe, western Asia and North Africa. It has been introduced to North America as a garden plant and in places, particularly the Pacific Northwest, has become naturalised and is viewed as an invasive species and noxious weed. Description The shining cranesbill is an annual plant with stems up to long, brittle, fleshy, hairless and often red. Leaves round or kidney-shaped and glossy, palmately-lobed or divided bluntly to about two-thirds of their depth, sometimes with short hairs on the upper surface. Flowers with parts in fives, with sharply keeled sepals and bright pink, rounded petals, some in diameter, the petals having long bases and flat blades. These are born in pairs from May to August. The fruits are beaked capsules, ridged and slightly hairy, at least on the edges, and splitting open into five parts. The seeds are smooth. The whole plant has a tendency to turn red.Martin, W.

This plant is common in Great Britain and Ireland,Clapham, A.R.; Tutin, T.G.; Warburg, E.F. 1968. Excursion Flora of the British Isles (Second Edition) Cambridge University Press. especially in the southwest and west, but uncommon in Scotland. It is found at altitudes of up to . It has been grown as a garden plant in parts of the United States and has become naturalised in the Pacific Northwest. Habitat The shining cranesbill is common on limestone rocks and walls, and in churchyards on roadside verges, banks, gardens and bare ground; it thrives on chalky or sandy soil. It is also common on acid soils and shady banks. The plant has good dispersal abilities because the seed is explosively thrown out of the capsule, allowing the plant to move up slopes and exploit crevices in tree trunks and recesses in walls that are higher than the parent plant. Invasive species In parts of the United States including California, Washington state and the Willamette Valley in Oregon, shining cranesbill has become naturalised. It was first detected in the US in 1971 and has since been declared a noxious weed in Washington and Oregon. A 2013 survey by USDA reported that it was present in five counties in Washington, thirteen in Oregon and two in California. It was detected in Canada in 1982, on Vancouver Island in British Columbia, and has been introduced into Australia and New Zealand. When naturalised in the Pacific Northwest, it is often seen in association with the related European plant, herb Robert (Geranium robertianum), also classified as a noxious weed. In these areas, shining cranesbill seems to thrive in woodlands and forest glades, where it tends to overwhelm the native plants. State legislation has been enacted making it \\"prohibited to transport, buy, sell, offer for sale, or to distribute plants or plant parts, seeds in packets, blends or \\"wildflower mixes\\" of this species, into or within the state of Washington\\".

Battle was fought for about two hours, ending in Polish victory. It was first Polish success in the open field since Swedish invasion of Poland in early summer 1655 (see Swedish invasion of Poland).  Background  After the Battle of Jaroslaw, which took place on March 15, 1656, Swedish forces under king Charles X Gustav found themselves in a difficult situation. They needed reinforcements, so on March 16, the king ordered his brother, Adolph John, to send the army of Frederick VI, Margrave of Baden-Durlach, which was stationed in Warsaw. In the second half of March 1656, the margrave left Warsaw, with between 2,200 and 2,500 reiters and dragoons. His mission was to relieve main Swedish army, together with the king himself, which was trapped and surrounded by Poles and Lithuanians in the confluence of the Vistula and San rivers. The margrave and his soldiers had to cross the dense Kozienice Wilderness, where Swedish units were constantly attacked by Polish guerillas. After a few days, Frederick VI received a message from Charles Gustav, ordering him to return to Warsaw. The Swedish king realized that main Polish forces, which had trapped him in the area of Gorzyce, headed northwards, to face Frederick. Polish hetmans Jerzy Lubomirski and Stefan Czarniecki were no longer in the area, which gave Charles Gustav a chance to escape the trap. Frederick VI obeyed royal order, and began a retreat, via Kozienice and Warka. The Polish forces under Czarniecki and Lubomirski that chased him had to cover the distance of some 80 kilometers, which was difficult in the conditions of early spring, when roads were flooded by melting snow. The forces of Frederick VI could have escaped the Poles, but the margrave made a grave mistake, when he decided to wait for a column of Swedish soldiers together with heavy wagons, which marched slowly to Warka from Radom. When Polish forces reached Zwolen, after a quick march from Sandomierz, Frederick‚Äôs unit was still located south of the Pilica river. The battle Battle of Warka, Juliusz Kossak, 1862 After both Swedish groups had joined, they crossed the Pilica, which lasted a whole night. At the same time, Polish forces under Lubomirski caught Swedish rear guard. The skirmish, which took place near Kozienice, ended with complete destruction of the Swedish unit. The survivors, who reached Frederick VI, told him about the danger, but the margrave waited with destruction of the bridge until the morning of April 7. After leaving rear guard along the river, the Swedes formed a 4-kilometer long column, and began marching towards Warsaw. When Polish forces arrived, the column stretched from Piaseczno in the north to Warka in the south. Frederick VI did not feel threatened, as the Pilica was very wide after snowmelt, and there was no bridge available for Polish cavalry. The Poles, however, quickly found a ford, crossing the river near the village of Winiary, where they immediately attacked Swedish reiters. Polish forces were then divided into three groups. One of the groups, under Czarniecki, attacked Swedes guarding the partly destroyed bridge. After capturing the bridge, Polish engineers rebuilt it, which allowed three regiments to cross the Pilica. At the same time Lubomirski attacked the regiment of an officer named Ritter, destroying it. Frederick VI, whose forces shrank to between 2,200 and 2,500, ordered some units to guard the wagons, while the remaining regiments took positions at the edge of a forest, waiting for the attacking Poles with loaded muskets. Since Swedish troops stood in front of the forest, it was impossible for the Poles to encircle them, and frontal attack was the only solution. First to attack was Lubmirski‚Äôs cavalry, but it was twice stopped by Swedish firepower. Soon, Lubomirski was reinforced by Czarniecki with three regiments. Altogether, the Poles had 8,000 soldiers, divided into ten regiments, but some 6,000 took place in the main fight, as the remaining ones were busy chasing the retreating Swedes or looting the wagons. Swedish defense was broken in the third attack, carried out by Polish hussars. Survivors fled to the forest, trying to organize defensive positions there. Local residents then set the grass and bushes on fire, which forced the Swedes to return to the open field. The battle then turned into a slaughter; those reiters and dragoons that survived were mercilessly murdered by the peasants. A Swedish regiment tried to escape to a forest near the village of Magierowa Wola, but was destroyed by the Polish hussarss of Zamoyski. Other Polish units awaited fleeing Swedes near Chynow. Frederick himself escaped to Czersk, where he organized defence in the local castle. Polish units, who chased him, did not try to capture the castle, as they lacked infantry and artillery. Polish cavalry had very little time, as all units had to quickly return to the south, to prevent royal Swedish army from escaping. In the meantime, however, Charles Gustav, in a daring operation, managed to evade second-rate forces, which encircled him, and crossed the San.  Aftermath  Swedish losses amounted to some 400 killed and captured, while Poles lost 100 killed and 100 wounded, plus a great number of trained horses, killed by Swedish muskets. Polish forces captured a number of wagons (app. 200) with looted properties, and food, which was especially important in the destroyed, starving country. The victory of Warka had a symbolic meaning for Poland- Lithuania. The Polish Crown army, which had lost its best soldiers in the Battle of Batoh (1652), was based on young, inexperienced recruits, who had lost several battles with the Swedish Empire in the previous months. The Battle of Warka was the first Polish victory in an open field.

It is not recorded in the Guild's register with which master he apprenticed.De liggeren en andere historische archieven der Antwerpsche sint Lucasgilde Volume 2, by Ph. Rombouts and Th. van Lerius, Antwerp, Julius de Koninck, 1871, p. 93, on Google books On stylistic grounds it is assumed that the artist spent time in the Northern Netherlands (the Dutch Republic), possibly in the Zeeland area. The place of his death is not known with certainty. It was traditionally believed that he died in Zeeland. However, some art historians believe that there is a connection between Andriessen and the still life painter Pieter van der Willigen who was active in Antwerp. In particular, the same attributes occur in signed works of the two artists. It is possible that van der Willigen took over Andriessen's studio after his death in 1655. This would mean that Andriessen was living in Antwerp at the time he died. Many paintings formerly attributed to Pieter van der Willigen are now given to Andriessen. Work Vanitas with a skull and a Moorish boy holding a portrait of the painter Andriessen was a specialist still-life painter. His still-life paintings fall generally into the category of vanitas paintings. He further painted a number of 'smoker' still lifes (the so-called 'toebackjes'), which depict smoking paraphernalia. Only a few works of the artist are known. The number of works currently attributed to Andriessen range from six to nine of which five are said to be signed. Andriessen signed his paintings variously using his full signature, his initials or monogram. Attributions of work to him are sometimes disputed. An example is the Vanitas with a skull and a Moorish boy holding a portrait of the painter (c. 1650, Johnson Museum of Art), which is attributed to David Bailly on the museum website but is attributed to Andriessen by Fred G. Meijer (1985).David Bailly, Vanitas at Johnson Museum of ArtHendrick Andriessen, Vanitasstilleven op een ronde tafel met een schedel, bloemen, een luit, een palet met penselen, boeken, rookgerei, horloge, zonnewijzer, blokfluit, brief, zandloper, kandelaar, zeepbellen en rechts een moorse jongen met een portretje van de schilder in zijn hand at the Netherlands Institute for Art History A Vanitas still life with a skull, a broken 'Roemer', a rose, an hour glass, a nautilus shell, a pocket watch and other objects, all on a draped table (At Christie's on 25‚Äì26 November 2014, Amsterdam, lot 79) is attributed by Fred G.

This genre of still life offers a reflection on the meaninglessness of earthly life and the transient nature of all earthly goods and pursuits. This meaning is conveyed in these still lifes through the use of stock symbols, which reference the transience of things and, in particular, the futility of earthly wealth: a skull, soap bubbles, candles, empty glasses, wilting flowers, insects, smoke, watches, mirrors, books, hourglasses and musical instruments, various expensive or exclusive objects such as jewellery and rare shells. The term vanitas is derived from the famous line 'Vanitas, Vanitas. Et omnia Vanitas', in the book of the Ecclesiastes in the bible, which in the King James Version is translated as . The worldview behind the vanitas paintings was a Christian understanding of the world as a temporary place of fleeting pleasures and sorrows from which mankind could only escape through the sacrifice and resurrection of Christ. While most of these symbols reference earthly existence (books, scientific instruments, etc.) or the transience of life and death (skulls, soap bubbles) some symbols used in the vanitas paintings carry a dual meaning: the rose refers as much to the brevity of life as it is a symbol of the resurrection of Christ and thus eternal life.Kristine Koozin, The Vanitas Still Lifes of Harmen Steenwyck: Metaphoric Realism, Edwin Mellen Press, 1990, p. vi-vii This duality of meaning is shown in Hendrick Andriessen's Vanitas still life of a skull, a vase of flowers and smoking implements in a niche (c. 1635‚Äì1650, Museum of Fine Arts, Ghent) which shows a rose just rising above a skull in its role as a resurrection flower.Arthur K. Wheelock, Jr., From botany to bouquets: flowers in Northern art, Catalogue of an exhibition held in 1999 in Washington (National Gallery of Art), Washington (National Gallery of Art), 1999, pp. 67 and 80 Most of Andriessen's vanitas still lifes include a skull as one of the key props. Vanitas still life with a skull One of Andriessen's best-known works is the Vanitas still life with a globe, sceptre, a skull crowned with straw (c. 1650, Mount Holyoke College Art Museum). Because of the presence in the still life of a skull, a crown and sceptre and other related objects it is regarded as a reference to the death by decapitation of King Charles I of England.Hendrick Andriessen, Vanitas Still Life, ca. 1650 at the Mount Holyoke College Art Museum The objects in this vanitas still life not only convey the usual moral lessons of vanitas still lifes but also reference the fate of the executed English king. The composition blends the genres of still life, portraiture and history painting. Andriessen placed on the edge of the table in the painting a letter supposedly written by Death itself telling the viewer how the fate of Charles I exemplified the futility of the pursuit of wealth and power. The leering skull in the still life is almost like a portrait of the dead King, which confronts the viewer with its riveting stare. To the left of the skull are placed the stock symbols of transience such as wilting flowers, bubbles, an extinguished taper and a luxurious pocket watch waiting to be wound. To the right of the skull Andriessen depicted the symbols of Charles' royal power such as the gold crown, the Order of the Garter and the gold sceptre. The artist included a self-portrait on the silver candlestick. It is possible that Andriessen produced this particular work while living in the Dutch Republic. In the Northern Netherlands there was a lot of sympathy for the executed king among the large community of exiled English Royalists and a significant number of Dutch citizens. The painting was clearly intended for an erudite patron who would have been able to appreciate its many obscure references and symbolism and complex political and philosophical message. Other Flemish still life artists were also producing vanitas still lifes on the death of King Charles I for the Dutch market. An example is the Vanitas still life with a poem on the death of Charles I by Godfriedt van Bochoutt (signed and dated 1668, at Bonhams auction of 23 October 2019, London lot 67TP.Godfriedt van Bochoutt Vanitas still life with a poem concerning the death of Charles I, record at the Netherlands Institute for Art History In an exceptional example of collaboration between artists in Antwerp, Nicolaes van Verendael added in 1679 flowers to the skull and smoking implements painted by Hendrick Andriessen in the 1640s to create the Vanitas still life with a bunch of flowers, a candle, smoking implements and a skull (Gallerie dell'Accademia of Venice). Hendrick Andriessen en Nicolaes van Verendael, Vanitasstilleven met bosje bloemen, kandelaar, rookgerei en een schedel at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Hendrick Andriessen was one of the Antwerp painters who collaborated on a Cabinet of Pictures (Royal Collection, England) by Jacob de Formentrou. This painting dated between 1654 and 1659 represents an art gallery with works of important Antwerp masters and can be regarded as a carefully crafted advertisement for the contemporary talent and past legacy of the Antwerp school of painting. The inclusion in the art gallery's collection of a work by Hendrick Andriessen depicting a vanitas still life (bottom left on the right-hand wall, monogrammed HA) shows that he was at the time considered to be a leading painter in Antwerp.Nadia Sera Baadj, Monstrous creatures and diverse strange things\\": The Curious Art of Jan van Kessel the Elder (16261679), A dissertation submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy (History of Art) in The University of Michigan, 2012 References External links * Category:1607 births Category:1655 deaths Category:Artists from Antwerp Category:Flemish Baroque painters Category:Flemish still life painters Category:Flemish painters Category:Members of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke ","title":"Hendrick Andriessen"},{"id":"11803373","text":"Kopina is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Milan√≥w, within Parczew County, Lublin Voivodeship, in eastern Poland.

In the taxonomy of Bouchet & Rocroi (2005), the family Elysiidae is considered to be a synonym of the family Plakobranchidae Gray, 1840. The original spelling Placobranchidae, based on Placobranchus, an incorrect subsequent spelling by F√©russac (1824) in a translation of van Hasselt's work. Franc (1968: 848) and Jensen (1996: 92) attributed the name to Rang, 1829 (p. 134), who used the vernacular \\"les Placobranches\\". Jensen (1997: 180-181) argued for the restoration of the spelling Plakobranchidae, and she has been followed by W√§gele & Willan (2000: 91). Bouchet & Rocroi (2005: 133), argued that the spellings Placobranchus and Placobranchidae were in prevailing usage and were conserved under Art. 33.3.1. This view has been challenged by R.

A row of washing machines at a laundromat in Walden, NY. Laundromat in Philadelphia that opened in 1947 and is believed to be the first coin- operated laundromat in the United States. A self-service laundry, coin laundry, laundromat or coin wash is a facility where clothes are washed and dried without much personalized professional help. Laundromats are known in the United Kingdom as launderettes or laundrettes, and in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand as laundromats (from the genericized trademark of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation) or (rarely) washaterias. It is known that George Edward Pendray was the one to create the term \\"laundromat\\" for Westinghouse. General While most homes do have their own washers and driers in the US, laundromats are still very popular with some apartment dwellers and those who do not own their own machines. They are also used, even by those who own their own machines, for large bedding and other items that ordinary residential washers cannot accommodate. Most UK households have bedding (such as duvets and comforters) which are far above the capacity of domestic machines, and UK households may not have dryers making launderettes the only means available for cleaning them or drying them.  Staffed laundries  Some laundries employ staff to provide service for the customers. Minimal service centres may simply provide an attendant behind a counter to provide change, sell laundry detergent, and watch unattended machines for potential theft of clothing. Others allow customers to drop off clothing to be washed, dried, and folded. This is often referred to as fluff & fold, wash-n-fold, drop off, bachelor bundles, a service wash or full-service wash. Some staffed laundry facilities also provide dry cleaning pick-up and drop-off. There are over 35,000 laundries throughout the United States. Similar services exist in the United Kingdom where the terms service wash or full-service wash are also in use. The evolution of self-serve laundry services have been seen in some \\"fluff and fold\\" (also styled fluff n fold, fluff & fold, fluff 'n' fold, and fluff 'n fold) services provided by various laundromats. These services provide the end user with washing, drying, and folding services on a per pound basis. Some services offer free pickup and delivery, as well as complimentary laundry bags as part of their customer appreciation. Additionally, dry-cleaning services have been known to utilize the pickup and delivery as a means to help generate additional revenue.  On- premise laundromats  On-premise laundromats are found in locations such as hospitals, student residences at universities, or apartment blocks. Facility managers/maintenance staff work directly with machine distributors to supply and maintain washers and dryers. Use of the machines are primarily reserved for the residents of these facilities. Monday, 4 February 2019 Many building owners use on-premise laundromats as a way to increase revenue. They can do this through renting their laundry room to laundry companies for a fixed monthly price allowing the laundry company to keep all revenue from the machines. Building owners also have the option to create a revenue sharing system where the apartment owner and laundry company split the profits from the machines each month.https://cooperator.com/article/what-you-must- know/fullhttps://cdn.ymaws.com/www.almnet.org/resource/resmgr/Certification/Contact_Hour_Articles/041_AGuideToLaundryContracts.pdf By country = Australia = In Australia, self service laundries are widely available and in use by a good percentage of the population. Due to its mild weather, Australia has a much smaller percentage of dryer owners, as the mild weather allows for hanging laundry outside for most of the year, with the exception of a few months. The brief Australian winter sees a surge in the usage of drying machines, usually easily found in self service laundries. = Israel = In Israel, self service laundries are available and popular mainly in Tel Aviv, where there is a large network of laundromats. = New Zealand = In New Zealand self service laundries are available, but not widely used. The NZ culture tends to be reserved with in-house laundry facilities, but with the rise in apartment dwellers this is slowing. Most houses also operate their own dryer as the temperate climate can have often unpredictable downpours. There is a rise in delivered laundry and ironing services as New Zealanders better off are starting to outsource, in line with the value of their time. =United Kingdom = The first UK launderette (alternative spelling: \\"laundrette\\") was opened on 9 May 1949 in Queensway (London). UK launderettes are mainly fully automated and coin-operated, and are either manned or unmanned. Some may be manned during fewer hours than the operating time each week. They are generally found only in urban and suburban areas, and have been common features of urban life since the 1960s. In the last two decades there has been a decline in the number of launderettes, to approximately 3000 nationally. Rapidly rising utility charges, premises rent and a lower purchase cost of domestic machines have been noted as principal reasons for the recent decline. High initial launch costs, specifically for commercial washing machines and dryers, have also been commented on as reasons for fewer new entrants into the market. Furthermore, machine updates can be prohibitively expensive, which has held back premises investment. Many of the manned operations in the UK have added value services such as ironing, dry cleaning and service washes, which prove popular to busy professionals, students, and senior citizens. Student accommodation blocks often have their own unmanned laundries, which are typically commercially run at a profit by the accommodation provider. Local directories, such as the yellow pages and Thomson, only show those laundries that have chosen to pay for an entry in their directories, so trends are difficult to assess. However, cities such as Birmingham, Leeds, Liverpool, London, and Manchester have significant numbers of launderettes, as do many coastal tourist areas. The main manufacturers serving the UK in this market are Electrolux, IPSO, Maytag, and Primus. Brands such as Frigidaire and Speed Queen are also regularly deployed, with most originating from Belgium and the US. Whilst the future of launderettes in the UK is not assured, domestic machine users experiencing breakdowns in the home, users of large bedding, and tourists are potential customers, thereby making the provision valuable to the community. =United States= A modern laundromat in Ohio Self-service laundry facilities in the United States are most commonly called laundromats. \\"lavanderia\\" is an alternate name for laundromat, but is not in common use outside of Texas. The term comes from the first laundromat in the United States, which was known as a Washateria and was opened on April 18, 1934 in Fort Worth, Texas, by C.A. Tannahill. Though steam-powered laundry machines were invented in the 19th century, their cost put them out of reach of many. Cantrell and others began renting short-term use of their machines. Most laundromats in the US are fully automated and coin-operated and generally unmanned, with many operating 24 hours a day. The invention of the coin-operated laundry machine is ascribed to Harry Greenwald of New York who created Greenwald Industries in 1957; the company marketed the devices through the 20th century. The United States Census Bureau estimates that there are 11,000 of this style of laundromat in the US, employing 39,000 people and generating over $3.4 billion every year.

He did not receive a degree.Borthwick, Peter, A Cambridge Alumni Database, University of Cambridge Political career Borthwick first came to attention through his staunch opposition to the abolition of slavery, which attracted the attention and thanks of various slave owners and Conservative Associations. In 1833 he was appointed by the West India Association to defend slavery in debates in Glasgow with the abolitionist George Thompson.Whyte, Iain.

Early life Thomas Hopkinson was born in London, on April 6, 1709, the son of Mary Hopkinson, and Thomas Hopkinson, a London scrivener and a member of Middle Temple. He was educated there, attending Oxford University (but not graduating) and then studying law at London. He then immigrated about 1731 to Pennsylvania, where he became a merchant, lawyer, judge, and natural philosopher, as well as a friend of Benjamin Franklin. Career He worked with Franklin on several of his experiments on electricity and was a member of the Junto. As a young barrister, he was appointed deputy to Charles Read, Clerk of the Orphans' Court of Philadelphia. Upon his death, he was commissioned as his successor on January 20, 1736‚Äì7, filling that position until November 5, 1751, when he died. On the same date, he was commissioned Master of Rolls for the city, serving until 1741. Hopkinson held a number of legal and judicial positions, including Justice (1749), and Judge of the Vice Admiralty of the Province (1744-5). He was also a member of the Provincial (1747), and Common Councils (1741). As a merchant, Hopkinson acted as agent for several London firms, and in partnership with William Coleman, imported and sold a wide variety of goods, including fabrics, spices, gunpowder and iron. Under James Hamilton, he became Deputy Prothonotary, in 1748 becoming Prothonotary until his death. Hopkinson was a founder of both the Library Company of Philadelphia, as well as an original trustee of the College of Philadelphia (now the University of Pennsylvania), and served as first president of the American Philosophical Society.

He enrolled his son Francis Hopkinson, later a signatory of the Declaration of Independence in the first classes at the Academy. One of his daughters married Reverend Jacob Duch√©, and another Dr. John Morgan. Hopkinson was an early subscriber of the Dancing Assembly. Franklin wrote about him: \\"The power of points to throw off electrical fire was first communicated to me by my ingenious friend, Thomas Hopkinson, since deceased, whose virtue and integrity in every station of life, public and private, will ever make his memory dear to those who knew him and knew how to value him\\". Family Thomas Hopkinson married at Christ Church, Philadelphia on September 9, 1735, to Mary Johnson (b. August 4, 1718, Appoquinimink Hundred - d. November 9, 1804, Philadelphia).

Krzysztof Opali≈Ñski and Bogus≈Çaw Leszczy≈Ñski, dissatisfied with policies of King John II Casimir of Poland, decided to become Swedish allies together with the pospolite ruszenie (Lev√©e en masse) of Greater Poland to Charles X Gustav of Sweden.  Introduction  In the summer of 1655, the Swedish Empire invaded the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, entering Poland‚ÄìLithuania from Swedish Pomerania and Swedish Livonia. On July 5, 1655, Arvid Wittenberg concentrated his forces near Stettin, and marched towards the Polish border. He was faced by the Lev√©e en masse from the province of Greater Poland. Polish forces were made of local szlachta (nobility), which had not experienced any major military conflicts, and was unprepared to fight professional Swedish army, which was largely based on mercenaries, veterans of the Thirty Years' War. Wittenberg's army of 17,000 crossed Polish border near Czaplinek, on July 21. Polish forces, concentrated near Uj≈õcie consisted of 13,000 nobility, plus 1,400 chosen infantry. The Poles were supposed to be commanded by Bogus≈Çaw Leszczy≈Ñski, who feigned illness and left to Breslau. In the absence of Leszczy≈Ñski, the command was shared by Voivode of Pozna≈Ñ Krzysztof Opalinski, and Voivode of Kalisz, Andrzej Karol Grudzi≈Ñski. Their task was to defend the Noteƒá river crossings before the arrival of main forces, commanded by King John II Casimir. The battle On July 24, Wittenberg's army reached Uj≈õcie, urging Polish forces to capitulate. After the refusal, Wittenberg placed his artillery opposite Polish trenches, and began a barrage. For five hours, the chosen infantry defended bridges over the Noteƒá and the Gwda rivers, retreating after running out of ammunition. At the same time, Swedish cavalry unit managed to capture a bridge near Dziembowo. Facing encirclement, Polish leaders decided to negotiate. Furthermore, panic broke out in Polish camp.  Capitulation  On the next day, July 25, Polish leaders signed capitulation, pledging allegiance to the Swedish king. Among the dignitaries who signed the act were such names, as Voivode of Pozna≈Ñ Krzysztof Opalinski, Voivode of Kalisz Andrzej Karol Grudzinski, Castellan of Miƒôdzyrzecz Pawel Gembicki, Castellan of Krzywin Maksymilian Miaskowski and Andrzej S≈Çupecki. After the pact, Greater Poland's nobility, which stayed at the Uj≈õcie camp, was invited by the Swedes to a feast. According to the document signed by the Poles, Charles X Gustav was given complete control of the two Greater Poland's voivodeships, together with all church and royal properties, royal towns (Pozna≈Ñ, Kalisz, Ko≈õcian, Miƒôdzyrzecz), and royal castles.Pierwsze starcie. Patrick Gordon i bitwa pod Uj≈õciem (First Clash. Patrick Gordon and the Battle of Uj≈õcie) The nobility was granted guarantee of its freedoms (see Golden Liberty), and only Poles were to be nominated to the posts of civil servants.  Consequences  Retreat of the Poles by J√≥zef Brandt The capitulation, which took place after a short battle, opened to the Swedes the way towards defenceless central Poland. Wittenberg however headed south west, to Pozna≈Ñ, which he captured without fighting on July 31. In early August he camped near ≈öroda Wielkopolska, awaiting the arrival of the army commanded by Charles Gustav. News of the capitulation reached Warsaw on July 31. Shaken and desperate Polish King John II Casimir urged Austrian Emperor for help. Furthermore, on August 2 John Casimir expressed his willingness to hand the Polish crown over to Emperor Ferdinand III. The Battle of Uj≈õcie is now regarded in Poland as a symbol of treason. Politician and publicist Piotr Naimski wrote in his essay \\"Zaczƒô≈Ço siƒô pod Uj≈õciem\\" (\\"It all began at Uj≈õcie\\") that the source of the national weakness of the Poles lies at Uj≈õcie: \\"Before 1655, all cases of treason were severely punished. After the meeting with Swedes, where a group act of treason took place, its participants were not condemned. Furthermore, they were later allowed to return to Poland, and to participate in public life (...) It was after Uj≈õcie that collaboration and treason emerged as one of possible choices in the so-called \\"decent families\\". It was not only the Swedish invasion in itself that undermined Polish statehood. It also was the weed of treason, which was allowed to take root and with which we still struggle\\".Zaczƒô≈Ço siƒô pod Uj≈õciem ‚Äì dr Piotr Naimski o zdradzie narodowej. The webpage of Center of Political Thought (O≈õrodek My≈õli Politycznej) Polish historian J√≥zef Szujski described the events at Uj≈õcie in the following way: \\"The year 1655 brought a shameful renunciation of the Polish crown by King John II Casimir. This was a symbolic confirmation of the fact that the idea of a state, the idea of a monarchy, the allegiance to the government, was deeply undermined. The tragic cycle of invasions began with capitulation and treason of Greater Poland's lev√©e en masse. Despite the convenient, defensive position of the Uj≈õcie camp, despite numerical superiority, the nobility gathered at Uj≈õcie decided to negotiate with Wittemberg and traitor Hieronim Radziejowski, accepting the protectorate of Charles Gustav\\".Jozef Szujski, Historyi polskiej ksiag dwanascie, wydanie nowe, Warszawa 1889, page 291 References *Frost, Robert.

Instead they are sacoglossans, commonly known as sap-sucking slugs.Bouchet, P.; Gofas, S. (2010). Elysia Risso, 1818. In: Bouchet, P.; Gofas, S.; Rosenberg, G. (2010) World Marine Mollusca database. Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=137928 on 2010-12-14 Elysia sea slugs graze on algae and some species such as E. viridis and E. chlorotica hijack the chloroplasts for themselves. The chloroplasts end up lining the slug‚Äôs digestive tract, enabling the slugs to survive solely by photosynthesis for several months at a time. This association is crucial for the development and maturing of the slug. Exactly how the slugs use the chloroplasts is unclear, as many of the proteins used are encoded in the genome of the host cell. These proteins, numbering in the hundreds, are manufactured in the cell‚Äôs nucleus, and then moved into the chloroplast, enabling it to survive.BBC News item This genus was previously sometimes considered to be in the family Stiligeridae, and was also previously placed in the family Elysiidae.

A largely redesigned version (practically, a new car in modified old body) ‚Äì GAZ-24-10 ‚Äì was produced from 1985 to 1992. Belgian-assembled re-badge models were sold as the Scaldia-Volga M24 and M24D for the Western European market.  1967-1969  M-24 prototype (photo dated 1967). Some prototypes had quad headlights. First prototypes were built in 1966. \\"Pre-serial\\" Volga depicted on Soviet 1971 10 kopeks post stamp Development of the GAZ-24 (then called M-24) finished in 1966 when several prototypes were built. The Volga GAZ-24 was unveiled towards the end of 1967. However, only 32 units were built in 1968).Thompson, Andy. Cars of the Soviet Union (Haynes Publishing, Somerset, UK, 2008), p.131 primarily for road tests, with another 215 units built in 1969.Thompson, p.131 1968/69-built Volgas are often called \\"pre-serial\\" because full-scale manufacturing started only in 1970 (18,486 units built). Distinctive feature of the very first several prototypes were two outside rearview mirrors fixed on front fenders. Most of the pre-serial and all serial cars got one mirror placed on front left door. The GAZ-24 was developed to replace the outdated Volga GAZ-21 developed in the 1950s. The new Volga had a longer wheelbase () than the GAZ-21 (2700 mm (106 in), but slightly shorter overall length ( compared to ) ) and was substantially lower at ) compared to . Width remained untouched. Long wheelbase, boxier styling, bucket seats with lower bases and flat roof made the new Volga generously sized inside, with comfortable five- or six-passenger seating. The car was designed to last for years in severe road conditions, and its reinforced unibody construction gave the Volga extra weight if compared to foreign analogues. Yet power steering was not even an option, and it gained the nickname \\"barzha\\" (barge). Standard engine was aluminium-block overhead valve ZMZ-24D inline-four producing with one twin-choke carburetor. Only a four-speed manual transmission with floor- mounted shifter was offered (though GAZ did prototype an automatic, a column- shift manual, and a three-speed manual with overdrive).Thompson, p.130. The GAZ-21 trim lines (\\"standard\\" and \\"improved\\") were dropped, all GAZ-24 Volgas had similar trim. No specific options or extras were listed, but standard equipment included self-adjusting power drum brakes with front/rear split brake system, three-wave radio with power antenna, interior safety padding, central armrests (both front and rear), alternator, three-speed windshield wiper and foot-operated windshield washer, heater with defroster, rear window defogger, electric clock, and trunk and engine compartment lights. Early cars had \\"ribbon\\" speedometers, with gauges that filled up with red, in a thermometer fashion. The interior was available in three colours ‚Äì red, brown or light gray. Interior colour selection was often in contrast to the color of the exterior.Thompson, p.134. Official cars were almost always black outside and red inside. The dashboard was made of aluminium and painted in exterior colour, the upper part covered with safety padding and black vinyl. Some features of the Volga's styling were thematically quite similar to those of the GAZ-21, such as the vertical tail lights, so-called \\"baleen plates\\" grille, tiny fins on rear fenders. One of the most recognizable features of the GAZ-24 Volga sedan styling are chromed rhombic vents on the C-pillar. Among other distinctive features can be mentioned dashboard handles with \\"ivory\\" plastic inserts, two chromed \\"fangs\\" under front bumper, large two spoke steering wheel and large chromed parking brake handle placed under the dashboard on the right.  1970-1974  The GAZ-24 was displayed at the London Motor Show in 1970.Thompson, p.132. Full-scale manufacturing started 15 July 1970.Thompson, p.131. Export sales began in 1971. During 1970-74 the Volga remained almost unchanged. Only minor modifications took place in 1972-73, when the car got new trunk decklid lock, flat ashtrays in rear doors instead of early ashtrays that were built in rear doors armrests, new rear bumper and new radio with more pleasant appearance and modified construction. In 1973 dashboard with simulated wood insert appeared (also there was a \\"silver\\" grained finish, used until 1974). After 1973, the ignition switch was moved from the dashboard to under the steering wheel to prevent knee injuries in road accidents, although that was inconvenient for the driver. Also in 1974, the Volga got additional C-pillar parking lights on (something like opera lights). The 24-01 was joined in 1977 by the 24-07, which was fitted to use liquified propane. The original strip speedometer was changed to dial 1975, the same year the ignition switch was moved from the dash to the steering column. Beginning in 1977, seatbelts began to be offered. In 1978, about 1000 right-hand drive 24-56s were built for export to India, Pakistan, and Singapore; powered by the Peugeot XDP 4.90 engine, they were not assembled in Belgium, and were the last right-hand drive vehicles GAZ built. The Volga was a status symbol in the Soviet Union, being large and luxurious, with a three- band radio. Unlike the GAZ-21, however, for most of its production lifetime, it was not commonly available to the public; those that were sold required a special permit to purchase them.Thompson, p.135. This would not begin to change until the 1980s.

In 1971, the GAZ-24-01 taxi was introduced. It had cheap and easy-to-wash all-vinyl interior,http://www.vektaxi.ru/images/IMG_2144_dob_a.gif low compression ZMZ 24-01 engine (85 hp, SAE 95 hp) able to run on 76 octane fuel (most commonly available in the Soviet Union), taximeter under the dash, and distinctive checkerboard stripe on front doors. At first, Volga taxis were painted in different light colors; later, most taxis were painted in lime- yellow.http://www.vektaxi.ru/images/IMG_2143_24gaz.gif The GAZ-24 is still famous for its roadworthiness and durability. Volga taxicabs often have more than on their odometers, and several engine rebuilds. Taxicab drivers nicknamed GAZ-24 sedan \\"The Shrimp\\" due to its slim appearance (when compared to the GAZ-21, nicknamed \\"The Holy Cow\\") and the two \\"fangs\\" beneath the front bumper that resembled shrimp's claws. Wagon taxis GAZ-24-04 (station wagons were used as cargo taxies) were nicknamed \\"The Shed\\" due to vast interior space; they had a payload of , thanks to stiffer rear springs. = Station wagon and ambulance = In 1972, the GAZ-24-02 4-door station wagon was introduced, fitted with three rows of seats. However, to inhibit small private enterprises Volga wagons were not sold to private owners without special permit. For example, families with many children or sportsmen who had to carry heavy sport equipment (like parachutes) were allowed to purchase a Volga wagon. Famous clown and actor Yuri Nikulin was permitted to own a GAZ-24-02 wagon because he often transported heavy circus equipment. This restriction came from small volume of GAZ-24-02 production. Wagons were primarily used by hospitals (as ambulances), state-owned shops and taxi companies, Militsiya, GAI, post offices and other state enterprises. The wagon was sold freely in export markets. The GAZ-24-02 had generous interior area with three rows of seats and 7-8-passenger seating. The area behind the front seat could be converted into spacious one-level cargo compartment. The 24-02 had heavy-duty rear leaf springs (six leaves as opposed to the sedan's five) and could carry up to , thanks to stiffer rear springs. The GAZ-24-04Vektaxi was a taxicab variant of the Volga station wagon with special features similar to those of the sedan taxi. The ambulance specification GAZ-24-03 model was introduced in 1973. = Convertible = The GAZ never built GAZ-24 convertibles. All convertibles were produced by a military plant in the city of Bronnitsy. They were used for military parades. = Pickup truck = GAZ-24-95 Volga-based pickup trucks were built by different car repairing plants all over the country. Exteriors differed. = 4x4 version = During the winter of 1973-74, five AWD GAZ-24-95s were built.Thompson, p.133. It used a UAZ transfer case, with a heavily modified floorpan. The front axle ended up being a Volga rear axle turned backwards, attached to UAZ joints for the steering, with front leaf springs (on stronger frame rails, to carry the greater load). The sump also had to be modified. In all, the changes added . Some disadvantages were discovered during the tests and this modification remained experimental. One survives in the GAZ plant's museum, another perhaps in private hands in Nizhny Novgorod.  1975-1976  In 1975 the car was slightly modified. It got another, more conventional speedometer, more convenient outside rearview mirror. Engine cooling system was modified to use antifreeze instead of water. = V8-powered version = GAZ-24-34 V8 ZMZ-505.10 engine. GAZ 24-24 had almost the same engine (called ZMZ 24-24), 24-34 is a later development of 24-24 produced after 1985 From late 1974, a V8 powered version was produced in small numbers, the GAZ 24-24. It received an aluminium OHV ZMZ 24-24 V8 (derived from the GAZ-13)–í–æ–ª–≥–∞ 24 v8–î–≤–∏–≥–∞—Ç–µ–ª–∏ –ó–ú–ó-24-24, –ó–ú–ó-503.10, –ó–ú–ó-505.10–ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –ì–ê–ó–æ–Ω–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏—Ö –≤–æ—Å—å–º–µ—Ä–æ–∫ –ó–ú–ó V8. -13, -53-66, -14, -505, -500 —Å–µ—Ä–∏–π., one four-barrel carburetor, a dual exhaust, 3-speed automatic transmission (same as the Chaika), power steering, modified suspension, and a fuel tank, but the same drum brakes of the standard Volga. This modification is sometimes designated \\"device 2424\\", and was nicknamed \\"The Double\\" (for having a V8, rather than a straight four) and \\"Chaser\\" (Russian: –¥–æ–≥–æ–Ω—è–ª–∫–∞, dogonyalka). \\"Device 2424\\" was used by the KGB as interceptor and security car. The main function of the \\"2424\\" was an outrider vehicle accompanying governmental Chaika and ZIL limousines.  1977-1985  In 1976-78 the car was completely refreshed. To improve the safety, bumperguards, yellow front fog lamps, secondary turning signals on front fenders and seat belts (both front and rear) became standard equipment. The car got modified interior. New dashboard consisted of aluminium body and two pieces of soft polyurethane foam padding. Upper door panels had the same construction. Lower door panels were completely different from the previous version. Seats got more convenient vinyl-and-cloth upholstery with cloth seat cushion. Due to installation of seatbelts front central armrest was eliminated. New interior was available in red, brown, yellow, lime green, dark green, dark blue, or black. Interior trim became non-reflective. = Olympiad '80 = For the 1980 Summer Olympics a special fleet of Volga sedans and station wagons was built with special two- tone white and yellow paint. They accompanied the Olympic Torch. The color scheme was chosen by the local Moscow organizers, not the IOC- that year's Winter Games fleet was light blue (Ford products).

This car was GAZ-24 body with improved engine, revised mechanicals, heavily modified interior and many exterior differences (different headlights, flush door handles reducing the risk of pedestrian injury , ventless front doors, bumpers without bumper guards, plastic grille, plastic \\"aerodynamic\\" hubcaps, fewer bright metal parts, and so on). Also GAZ-24-12 station wagon, GAZ-24-11 taxicab and other versions were produced.  Derivative models  RAF-2203 \\"Latvija\\" van by Rƒ´gas Autobusu Fabrika (in production 1976-97) was based on drivetrain and suspensions of GAZ-24 Volga. GAZ-3102 Volga (produced since 1982) and almost all later GAZ passenger cars (31029, 3110, 31105) use central body shell of GAZ-24.  International variants  Wolga GAZ 24 of the East German Volkspolizei. The GAZ-24 Volga was exported to many countries, from Indonesia and Latin America to Western Europe. Right-hand-drive export versions also existed. In Europe, one of the most popular Volgas were cars, both sedans and wagons, assembled in Antwerp by Scaldia-Volga S.A..http://www.russischeklassiekerclub.nl/documentatie/M24combifolder- vlaams2.pdf These cars were shipped to Belgium without engines, where they were fitted with Indenor diesels (the same as in the Peugeot 404),Thompson, pp.131-132. a 2.1 litre unit with until the 2300 D was introduced for 1980. The 2.3 litre XD2 has . Those models were called M24D and M24DB (Break, station wagon), and there was also a \\"Luxe\\" version. Standard Volgas with Soviet engines were sold as M24 and M24B (Break). Cars that were sold in Europe often had such features as metallic paint, simulated vinyl roof, leather interior and other luxuries. Station wagons sometimes had simulated \\"wood\\" decoration and often a rear window wiper and heater. These features were usually installed by local European GAZ dealers. The petrol engine began disappearing from western European price lists towards the end of the 1970s. The Volga offered good value for money, with the retail price being lower than that of a Volkswagen Golf Diesel ‚Äì however, the resale value was abysmal. By late 1983, Belgian Volgas were also no longer available with sedan bodywork.

Early life and education  Bryant was born Sophie Willock in Dublin in 1850. Her father was Revd Dr William Willock DD, Fellow and Tutor of Trinity College, Dublin. She was educated at home, largely by her father. As a teenager she moved to London, when her father was appointed Professor of Geometry at the University of London in 1863, and she attended Bedford College. At the age of nineteen she married Dr William Hicks Bryant, a surgeon ten years older than she was, who died of cirrhosis within a year.  Career  Frances Mary Buss and Sophie Bryant in 1900 In 1875 Bryant became a teacher and was invited by Frances Mary Buss to join the staff of North London Collegiate School. In 1895 she succeeded Miss Buss as headmistress of North London Collegiate, serving until 1918. When the University of London opened its degree courses to women in 1878, she became one of the first women to obtain First Class Honours, in Mental and Moral Sciences, together with a degree in mathematics in 1881, and three years later was awarded the degree of Doctor of Science. In 1882 she was the third woman to be elected to the London Mathematical Society, and was the first active female member, publishing her first paper with the Society in 1884. Together with Charles Smith, Bryant edited three volumes of Euclid's Elements of Geometry, for the use of schools (Euclid's Elements of Geometry, books I and II (1897); Euclid's Elements of Geometry, books III and IV (1899); Euclid's Elements of Geometry, books VI and IX (1901)). Sophie Bryant was a pioneer in education for women. She was the first woman to receive a DSc in England; one of the first three women to be appointed to a Royal Commission, the Bryce commission on Secondary Education in 1894‚Äì1895; and one of the first three women to be appointed to the Senate of the University of London. When Trinity College Dublin opened its degrees to women, Bryant was one of the first to be awarded an honorary doctorate. She was also instrumental in setting up the Cambridge Training College for Women, now Hughes Hall, Cambridge. She is also said to have been one of the first women to own a bicycle. She was interested in Irish politics, wrote books on Irish history and ancient Irish law (Celtic Ireland (1889), The Genius of the Gael (1913)), and was an ardent Protestant Irish nationalist. She was president of the Irish National Literary Society in 1914. She supported women's suffrage but advocated postponement until women were better educated.  Later life and death  Bryant loved physical activity and the outdoors. She rowed, cycled, and swam, and twice climbed the Matterhorn. She died in a hiking accident in the Alps in 1922, age 72.

He was a pupil of Peter Paul Rubens and one of the closest collaborators of Rubens in the 1630s. Following Rubens' death in 1640 he became one of the most successful painters in Flanders. He was a prolific draughtsman who made designs for decorative programmes in the context of official celebrations, for publications by the local publishers and for tapestries and sculptures realised by the local workshops.Matthias Depoorter, Erasmus Quellinus II at Baroque in the Southern Netherlands Life Quellinus was born in Antwerp as the son of Erasmus Quellinus I and Elisabeth van Uden.Erasmus Quellinus II at the Netherlands Institute for Art History The Quellinus family became one of the leading artistic families in Antwerp, producing sculptors, painters and printmakers who would develop careers in Flanders and abroad. Father Erasmus Quellinus I, a sculptor, had moved from Sint-Truiden to Antwerp. The brothers of Erasmus Quellinus the Younger were both artists: Artus (1609-1668) was a leading Baroque sculptor and Hubertus (1619-1687) an engraver. Sleeping Amor Quellinus commenced his apprenticeship with Jan Baptist Verhaeghe, an obscure artist, in 1633. He became a master of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke in 1633‚Äì1634. In the 1630s, the artist worked and likely studied in the workshop of Rubens and regularly collaborated on projects with Rubens.Hans Vlieghe, Erasmus Quellinus and Rubens's Studio Practice, in: The Burlington Magazine, Vol. 119, No. 894, Sep., 1977, pp. 636-643 In 1634 Erasmus II married Catharina de Hemelaer, a niece of Jan de Hemelaer, the deacon of Antwerp Cathedral. Their son Jan Erasmus followed in his father's footsteps and became a painter. From the notes made by his son Jan Erasmus in the margin of his copy of Cornelis de Bie's book of artist biographies entitled Het Gulden Cabinet, it is known that Erasmus II obtained a degree in philosophy. This explains the fact that he wrote a philosophical tract entitled Philosophia, which was recorded in the 1679 inventory of his estate.Hans Vlieghe and Iris Kockelbergh. \\"Quellinus.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 9 November 2014 Quellinus became a regular collaborator of Rubens starting from 1635. He first worked on the decorations for the Joyous Entry into Antwerp of the new governor of the Habsburg Netherlands Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand. Rubens was in overall charge of this project. Quellinus made decorative paintings after designs by Rubens of which six have survived. In the period 1636-1638 Rubens' workshop received a large commission to make mythological decorations for the hunting pavilion Torre de la Parada of the Spanish king Philip IV near Madrid. For this project Quellinus painted decorations after oil sketches by Rubens some of which have been preserved (Prado Museum). In early 1637 Quellinus drew frontispieces for the Antwerp printing house Plantin Press according to Rubens' instructions regarding iconography and layout. These drawings were in Quellinus' own style as Rubens let him a free hand in the design of the modelli. Artemisia His brother Artus Quellinus I returned to Antwerp from Rome around 1640. Artus worked in a classicizing style of Baroque under the influence of his compatriot, the sculptor Fran√ßois Duquesnoy, in whose workshop in Rome he had worked. This style had in turn been influenced by the Classicism of Annibale Carracci. The two brothers would from then on work together on various projects and mutually influence each other. After Rubens' death in 1640 Erasmus Quellinus became one of the leading history painters of Flanders. He received many commissions for altarpieces in the region. In 1648 he was commissioned to make the decorations for the Joyous Entry of the Archduke Leopold Wilhelm into Antwerp, thus playing the same role as Rubens 13 years earlier for the Joyous Entry of Ferdinand. He made the decorations for the announcement of the Treaty of Westphalia in the same year. Around 1656 Erasmus worked in Amsterdam where his brother Artus was responsible for the decoration of the new City Hall. Erasmus assisted in this project and the brothers also collaborated on other commissions. Erasmus painted altarpieces for clandestine Catholic churches in Amsterdam.Erasmus Quellinus II, The Vision of St. Francis Xavier at the Indianapolis Museum of Art His first wife died in 1662. On 9 November 1663, Erasmus Quellinus II married Fran√ßoise de Fren. De Fren was the daughter of the well-off Andr√© de Fren, secretary of the Council of Brabant, and the sister of Isabella de Fren, who was married to the court painter David Teniers II. In 1665 Quellinus designed a cenotaph for the deceased Philip IV of Spain and the decorations for the Joyous Entry of Don Francisco de Moura as governor of the Habsburg Netherlands. Quellinus died in Antwerp on 7 November 1678. His pupils included his son Jan Erasmus Quellinus, Guilliam Forchondt (II), Julius de Geest, Willem de Ryck, Anthoni Schoonjans, Wallerant Vaillant and Remacle Serin. Work Portrait of a young boy =General= Quellinus was a very versatile artist who worked in various genres. He received numerous commissions for altarpieces depicting Counter-Reformation themes for churches and monasteries throughout the Southern Netherlands. He also received many civic commissions which allowed him to show his learning in the depiction of scenes from ancient history and mythology and allegorical compositions. In addition, he produced portraits, battle scenes and designs for tapestries. Like Rubens, Quellinus was a pictor doctus with a strong grounding in ancient history and philosophy. He had built an extensive library and art collection. This learning is reflected in the subject matter of his work. Even while he was a frequent collaborator with Rubens' workshop in the 1630s, Quellinus developed a personal style distinctive from that of Rubens. This style is reminiscent of the Antwerp followers of Caravaggio such as Theodoor Rombouts and Gerard Seghers. Characteristics of this style are the strong modeling of forms achieved through a sculptural use of light. Quellinus' oldest known work is the 1634 Adoration of the Shepherds (Alte Pinakothek, Munich), which is in this Caravaggesque mode. Achilles with the daughters of Lycomedes From the 1640s, his style took on a classicizing aspect and a sculptured look. Erasmus never travelled to Italy so this stylistic development was likely influenced by the work of his brother Artus, who introduced his own style of classicizing Baroque in Flemish sculpture after returning from Rome in 1640. Both brothers depicted similar idealizing Antique figures in their work in this period. His Adoration of the Holy Sacrament (1646) was painted in this style. From c. 1650 this classicism in his work became rigid and his compositions from this period made use of a limited number of stereotyped and idealized figure types. This stylistic development is evident in the interior decorations he made for the new City Hall of Amsterdam, which he executed in collaboration with his brother Artus. The brothers achieved stylistic agreement in this commission: the Judgement of Solomon, which Artus sculpted for the Council Chamber, is repeated in a painting by Erasmus. This development towards classicist rigidity may reflect the influence of French art with its preference for classicism. Birth of the Virgin Erasmus' work also gained a theatrical aspect as reflected in the 1652 painting Artemisia (Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery, University of Glasgow). The painting has a theatrical background like a park. This tendency became more evident in the 1660s when his paintings started to include grandiose scenery with flamboyant architecture. This is clear in the Let the Children Come to Me of 1664 (Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, Brussels). These later compositions possible reflect an influence by the early work of his son Jan-Erasmus Quellinus. =Collaborations= As was common in Antwerp at the time, Quellinus collaborated with other painters. He worked with still life specialists on still lifes and portraits. Many of the still lifes fall into the category of 'garland paintings'. Garland paintings are a special type of still life invented in Antwerp and whose earliest practitioner was Jan Brueghel the Elder. These paintings typically show a flower garland around a devotional image or portrait. Garland paintings were usually collaborations between a still life and a figure painter.Ursula H√§rting, Review of Susan Merriam, Seventeenth-Century Flemish Garland Paintings. Still Life, Vision and the Devotional Image Quellinus collaborated on garland paintings with still life specialists, such as his brother-in-law Jan Philip van Thielen, Daniel Seghers, Jan Pieter Brueghel, Frans Ykens, Peter Willebeeck and Jan Anton van der Baren. These collaborators painted the flower garland while Quellinus painted the figures and architectural setting. An example is the Holy Family in a Wreath of Flowers in the Hermitage Museum, a collaboration with Frans Ykens. Quellinus further collaborated with the animal and still life painter Jan Fyt on portraits such as the Portrait of a young boy (Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp) of c. 1650. Quellinus also collaborated with animal painters Peter Boel and genre painter Jan van Kessel the Elder.Dans le sillage de Rubens: Erasmus II Quellinus (1607-1678) In Rubens‚Äô footsteps, Erasmus Quellinus (1607-1678) at Codart =Tapestry designs= Quellinus executed various tapestry designs. In 1649 he produced the designs for a tapestry series depicting the History of the Thurn and Taxis Family (Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, Brussels). These designs are executed in his classicizing style. He also made a series of 8 sketches with battle scenes for another tapestry series also kept in the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium.Eight sketches for a tapestry series in the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium =Graphic designs= Holy Family in a wreath of flowers In addition to the frontispieces he produced for the Plantin Press, he made designs for various publications for the Antwerp publishers. This includes his designs for the Den methamorphosis ofte Herscheppinge van P. Ovidivs Naso: verdeelt in XV boecken, versiert met figueren, a translation into Dutch of Ovid's Metamorphoses by Seger van Dort. For this book, which Geeraerdt van Wolsschaten published in Antwerp in 1650, Erasmus made the designs for the illustrations which were engraved by Pieter de Jode II. He also contributed a poem to the introduction of the publication.Den methamorphosis ofte Herscheppinge at Google Books =Sculptural designs= Quellinus came from an artistic family whose predominant activity was the design and execution of sculptures and architectural decorations. His father, older brother and cousin as well as his brother-in-law Pieter Verbrugghen I were all prominent sculptors who worked for a local and international clientele. It is therefore no surprise that Erasmus was a prolific designer of sculptures and decorative projects. The inventory of his estate lists hundreds of drawings, of which at least 43 are for architecture, which would have included altarpieces and large-scale sculptures as well as others for sculpture and decoration. He is believed to have contributed designs for the organs in the Antwerp cathedral and Saint Paul's Church in Antwerp, as well as several altarpieces, executed by his brother-in-law Pieter Verbrugghen I. A drawing by Erasmus has been identified as being a study for a group of three music-making angels on one of the organs, although none corresponds exactly to the angels now on the organs. It seems that in these designs he did not attempt to create a precise three-dimensional model to be followed by the sculptor but rather an outline from which the sculptor executing the sculpture could work freely.

In the 2nd half of the 14th century, their financial situation was so critical that they had to sell the domain of Germolles which was purchased by the Duke of Burgundy, Philip the Bold. We know very little about the appearance of the fortress of the lords of Germolles. It certainly had large towers and solid walls with only a few windows. All that remains of the original building are the lower chapel and the wine cellar. =Country estate of Philip the Bold and Margaret of Flanders= The fireplace of the reception room (14th century) moved in the 20th century to the great hall of the ch√¢teau In 1380, Philip the Bold (first Duke of Burgundy of the new royal Valois dynasty in France, after the Capetian dynasty came to an end) purchased the domain of Germolles. After one year, he gave it to his wife, the Duchess Margaret of Flanders. Important and expensive transformations were immediately undertaken by her. They lasted for the next ten years.C. et P. Beck (2007)p.99 The aim of the duchess was to transform the austere and archaic fortress of the 13th century into a country estate. In order to achieve this, she enlisted the help of artists working in the service of the ducal couple: the architect Drouet de Dammartin, the sculptors, Jean de Marville and Claus Sluter, and the painter Jean de Beaumetz. These artists worked at the same time on another important project of the Duke: the chartreuse de Champmol.C. et P. Beck (2007), p99 The residence was slowly transformed into a sumptuous country estate. The large rectangular building, surrounded by a moat, enclosed a courtyard. The apartments were situated in the south and east wings, while the west wing contained receptions rooms, and the north wing was for the guards and security staff. The Duchess of Burgundy, who was energetic and a country lover, decided to develop at Germolles some rustic activities that would create a pleasant environment around her favourite residence, as well as developing local agriculture and providing some income for the maintenance of the domain. So she planted a large rose garden, and the petals were sent to Flanders to be used to make rose water. Similarly, a model sheepfold was built that reflected not only the Duchess‚Äôs interest in sheep, but also the important contribution of that animal, through its wool, to the fortune of Flanders, in Burgundy. The main building from the north (14th century) King Charles VI of France was received at Germolles on 12 February 1389, at the invitation of his aunt and uncle. =After the ducal period= After Philip the Bold and Margaret of Flanders, the ch√¢teau belonged to the following three Dukes of Burgundy : John the Fearless, Philip the Good and Charles the Bold. After the death of Charles the Bold in Nancy in 1477, the ch√¢teau became a possession of the King of France. Used by various families courtesy of the King until the end of the 18th century, the ch√¢teau was sold to the Nation after the French Revolution. Different kinds of destruction, voluntary or accidental, due in particular to the lack of maintenance, led to the loss of certain parts of the building. The ch√¢teau was purchased at the end of the 19th century by the same family who still own it. Today it is open to visitors throughout most of the year, and a programme of cultural events takes place annually. Description =Remains of the original fortress= Two elements date from the first period of Germolles (13th century). They are still conserved because they were integrated into the project of transformation in a ducal palace. The large wine cellar used for the storage of wine and food has conserved its medieval appearance with modern gothic next to traditional Burgundian romanesque elements. The lower chapel has similar architecture but has sculptured decoration with both romanesque reliefs and gothic foliage. The two towers at the entrance to the ch√¢teau certainly date from the original building but were reused and reinforced in the 14th century. Even if during the ducal period the ch√¢teau was no longer a fortress, the importance of the rulers of the place required the presence of an escort confined to the ch√¢telet comprising the towers and the guard room. =Sumptuous princely palace= The entrance of the large spiral staircase (14th century) The reception room above the cellar was used in the 14th century to receive important guests. It was destroyed by a fire at the beginning of the 19th century but the remains indicate its original size. The south wall of the room was decorated with a monumental fireplace on top of which was a gallery for the musicians. The remains of this fireplace were removed in the 20th century to the great hall of the present ch√¢teau. It is adorned with capitals from the workshop of Claus Sluter representing a scene of Chr√©tien de Troyes‚Äôs novel, Yvain, the Knight with the Lion. Today archaeological discoveries made in the ch√¢teau are displayed in the reception room. The ch√¢teau still has a large collection of medieval floor tiles that decorated the floors of the 1st and 2nd floors of the ducal residence. Made of enamelled terracotta, they are decorated with motifs such as daisies, lions that are the symbols of the rulers of the place as well as roses, thistles, sheep, suns, fleur-de-lis etc. =Ducal chapel= The duchess‚Äôs architect created, above the old lower chapel, a ducal chapel. This is composed of a nave, as well as a choir (architecture) installed in the elegant octagonal turret built as a bartizan and a private and comfortable oratory with its own fireplace. It was reserved for the devotions of the princess. At the end of the 19th century a fire destroyed this exquisite part of the building which was then exposed to the elements. In 2009‚Äì2010, restoration work under the supervision and with the financial support of the government and the Department of Sa√¥ne-et-Loire, was carried out to restore the roof and top part of the turret and recreate the sense of the space of the nave with a modern protection. =Main building and the luxurious comfort of the court of Burgundy= Today the main building is separated from the rest of the ch√¢teau that surrounded the courtyard. It is certainly the most remarkable part of the ch√¢teau. It is particularly well preserved with elements showing the quality of the construction: large windows opening to the outside, turrets with internal spiral staircases cut in stone, gothic fireplaces... Its three floors are the architectural manifestation of the brilliant court of the duke and duchess: the ground floor was used for domestic activities, the first floor contained the ducal apartments and the second, the court apartments. In one of the kitchens on the ground floor, the large gothic fireplace still in its original position evokes the activities of the place. Gothic Revival architecture wall paintings with rose motifs were revealed during recent restoration work carried out in at the beginning of the 20th century. On the first floor, the dressing room of Margaret of Bavaria (daughter in-law of the ducal couple and future duchess of Burgundy), still possesses its murals that have been recently restored. These paintings by Jean de Beaumetz and his assistant Armoult Picornet are very rare examples of princely wall paintings in France at the end of the Middle Ages. The motifs P and M, initials of the duke and the duchess, cover the walls, along with thistles, a noble flower with sharp prickles which is the emblem of Margaret of Flanders. This decoration which extended to the floor (with floor tiles showing thistles) can be found as well in the adjoining room. Cleaning has revealed wall paintings similar to those in the dressing room. Other wall paintings with roses and daisies have been discovered in other apartments on the first floor. The garret or rooms under the timbers on the second floor were for the court that accompanied the ducal couple. The ceiling built as an inverted hull of a ship was panelled and the walls were decorated with tapestries. One of these rooms, restored at the beginning of the 20th century is covered with copies of wall paintings from originals of the first floor. =Gardens to accompany the ducal residence= Medieval kitchen (14th century) transformed in a dining room (20th century) The garden created by Margaret of Flanders and the large rose garden have disappeared. Transformed into a romantic English garden at the end of the 19th century, the park has some charming spots with old and rare trees such as a Bald Cypress, a Tulip tree from Virginia, a ginkgo biloba, an araucaria, and groups of lime trees. Some dates * 1380: The duke of Burgundy, Philip the Bold, purchased Germolles for his wife, Margaret of Flanders; * 1382: beginning of the renovation and re- building of the residence.

Thousands of Chinese people including many children had been forced to work as slaves in illegal brickyards, and were tortured by the owners of the brickyards. As of June 2007, approximately 550 people have been rescued from such situations. Background Shanxi is located in the Loess Plateau in northern China which is known for its rich clay deposits which are easier and cheaper to mine than coal. Through corrupt relationships with officials, slave \\"bosses\\" opened illegal brickyards. Due to a scarcity of labor in Shanxi, some factories outsourced production to middlemen who recruited workers from other provinces, making huge profits for the bosses. For example, in one notorious case, it was reported that Wang Bingbing, the son of Wang Dongyi, a secretary of a local CCP branch, was the owner of a brickyard located in Hongdong County, Linfen. The owner outsourced the brickyard to Heng Tinghan, who was from Henan. The brickyard produces 10,000 bricks per day. The market price for 10,000 bricks is about 2,000 to 3,000 yuan; the owner, however, paid only 360 yuan to Heng per 10,000 bricks produced. Wang Bingbing and Heng Tinghan, along with three other employees, including Heng's son, were later charged with a variety of crimes including murder, illegal detention, and forced labor. The existence of illegal brickyards was first reported to authorities in 1998. On 1 May, Chen Jianjiao, a representative of the Shanxi People's Congress, received a telephone call from a laborer who had escaped from an illegal brickyard. The escaped man also wrote to the chairman of the Shanxi People's Congress. As a result, slave rescue operations were carried out by provincial government authorities without notifying local officials. Over 150 slaves, three of them child laborers, were freed from these illegal brickyards. Chen Jianjiao himself was responsible for helping to free hundreds of them. There have been continuing reports of cruelty committed at these illegal brickyards since 2004. On 7 May 2007, Henan TV Metro Channel reported the case of five minors around sixteen years old who had disappeared from the environs of Zhengzhou Railway Station. Having heard of earlier instances of child laborers being kidnapped for brickyards in Shanxi, their parents suspected their children might be found there. Two months later these five were among fifty minors from Henan who were found at an illegal brickyard. Human traffickers had sold them to brickyards for 500 Yuan each. Later in 2011, it was found that the practice had not abated, as disabled men in Zhengzhou were still being kidnapped and forced to labor in the brickyards. The scandal was only uncovered following an undercover investigation. On 10 May, reporters from Henan Television, accompanied by two parents, visited the sites of some illegal brickyards in Shanxi undercover. Reporters later visited many illegal brickyards in Yuncheng and Jincheng. The conditions they found were clearly those of slavery. Concealed camera revealed that the local police refused to take action to rescue the slaves. Later the reporters were allowed into the illegal brickyards with the company of the local police. Concealed camera showed the police keeping them from rescuing children who were not from Henan which showed obvious local government protection for the illegal brickyards.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ykc6wr2y4Ug Working conditions The brickyard owners had purchased laborers from human traffickers to use as slaves. Many of the slaves were sold for CNY300 to CNY400 including delivery. The slaves included children as young as eight years old and teenagers. Moreover, brickyard owners hired guards and wolfdogs to watch their slaves. These slaves were forced to work over sixteen hours every day and any mistakes were punished by brutal torture. One teenager who was rescued from an illegal brickyard said that, during his slavery, he had been taken to another brickyard by his boss to watch another slave being fed to a meat grinder. Investigation As the scandal received immediate media attention, it also caught the eyes of the country's major leaders, including President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao. Governor Yu Youjun of Shanxi province offered an unprecedented self-criticism, took responsibility, and tendered his resignation on 30 August. He was replaced by Meng Xuenong, an official who had been sacked as Beijing mayor after the SARS outbreak. In June and July 2007, 570 people in Shanxi and Henan were freed by the Chinese government. Of those rescued, sixty-nine of them were children. In response, the Chinese government assembled a force of 35,000 police to check northern Chinese brickyards for slaves, sent dozens of brickyard supervisors to prison, punished ninety-five low level officials in Shanxi province for dereliction of duty, and sacked twenty-four. One brickyard foreman, Heng Tinghan, was sentenced to life in prison, and an employee of his, Zhao Tanbing, earned the death penalty for killing a mentally handicapped slave.

As Mayor of New York City during the September 11 attacks in 2001, Rudy Giuliani played a role in the response to the terrorist attack against the World Trade Center towers in New York City. Preparedness before the attacks =Location of Office of Emergency Management headquarters= In September 2006, Village Voice writer and long-time Giuliani critic Wayne Barrett and Dan Collins, a senior producer for CBSNews.com, published The Grand Illusion: The Untold Story of Rudy Giuliani and 9/11, one of the strongest reassessments of Giuliani's role in the events of 9/11. The book highlights his decision to locate the NYC Office of Emergency Management headquarters (long-identified as a target for a terrorist attack) on the 23rd floor inside the 7 World Trade Center building, a decision that had been criticized at the time in light of the previous terrorist attack against the World Trade Center in 1993.\\"Rudy Giuliani's 5 Big Lies About 9/11: On the Stump, Rudy Can't Help Spreading Smoke and Ashes About His Dubious Record,\\" Village Voice August 8‚Äì14, 2007, p. 22-36. The Office of Emergency Management was created to coordinate efforts between police and firefighters, but with the distraction of evacuating its headquarters, it was not able to conduct these efforts properly. In May 2007, Giuliani put responsibility for selecting the location on Jerome M. Hauer, New York City‚Äôs first Director of Emergency Management who had been appointed by Giuliani himself and had served under Giuliani from 1996 to 2000. Hauer has taken exception to that account in interviews and has provided Fox News and New York Magazine with a memo demonstrating that he recommended a location in Brooklyn, but was overruled by Giuliani. Television journalist Chris Wallace interviewed Giuliani on May 13, 2007, about his 1997 decision to locate the command center at the World Trade Center. Giuliani laughed during Wallace's questions and said that Hauer recommended the World Trade Center site and claimed that Hauer said that the WTC site was the best location. Wallace presented Giuliani a photocopy of Hauer's directive letter. The letter urged Giuliani to locate the command center in Brooklyn, instead of lower Manhattan, because \\"not as visible a target as buildings in lower Manhattan.\\"audio and video from interview available on Robert Greenwald's \\"The REAL Rudy: Command Center\\" The February 1996 memo read, \\"The [Brooklyn] building is secure and not as visible a target as buildings in Lower Manhattan.\\" =Radio communications= The 9/11 Commission noted in its report that lack of preparedness could have led to the deaths of first responders at the scene of the attacks. The Commission noted that the radios in use by the fire department were the same radios which had been criticized for their ineffectiveness following the 1993 World Trade Center bombings. Giuliani testified to the Commission, where some family members of responders who had died in the attacks appeared to protest his statements. A 1994 mayoral office study of the radios indicated that they were faulty. Replacement radios were purchased in a no-bid contract. They were implemented in early 2001. However, in March 2001 the replacement radios were found to be faulty as well. Fire Department chiefs issued orders for the firefighters to evacuate. However, the order was issued over the radios that were not working in the towers, thus, the 343 firefighters inside the Twin Towers could not hear the evacuation order. They remained in the towers as the towers collapsed.Urban Legend video, https://abcnews.go.com/Video/playerIndex?id=3367678 \\"NY Firefighters attack Giuliani,\\" BBC News, July 12, 2007 http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6294198.stm However, when Giuliani testified before the 9/11 Commission he said that the firefighters ignored the evacuation order out of an effort to save lives.Kevin Baker, \\"A Fate Worse than Bush: Rudy Giuliani and the Politics of Personality,\\" Harpers, August 2007, p. 37, citing Jim Dwyer and Kevin Flynn, 102 Minutes (Times Books, 2002)Jon Weiner, \\"Rudy: Worse than Bush?\\"thenation.com, August 1, 2007 http://www.alternet.org/story/58480/ Also criticized was Giuliani's focus on personal projects and turf wars rather than vital precautions for the city, and his role in communications failures (which may have been the result of patronage deals inside City Hall). Kirkus Reviews stated, \\"Giuliani may not have been directly responsible for all those woes, but they happened on his watch\\". At the scene =During the attack= During the attack, Giuliani may have been near the WTC towers. Interviews with Barry Jennings, a 9/11 survivor of the tower 7 crash, reveals that Giuliani may have been in tower 7 on the day of the attacks, but exited the building hours before collapse. Additionally, in an interview with ABC News on the day of the attacks, Giuliani indicated that he was \\"at the scene\\" saying: \\"We went down to the scene and we set up headquarters at 75 Barclay Street which was right there with the police commissioner [and] the fire commissioner and the head of emergency management. And we were operating out of there when we were told that the World Trade Center was gonna collapse, and it did collapse before we could actually get out of the building so we were trapped in the building for 10-15 minutes and finally found an exit, got out, walked North, took a lot of people with us.\\" =After the attack= Giuliani was highly visible in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center. After the attacks, Giuliani coordinated the response of various city departments while organizing the support of state and federal authorities for the World Trade Center site, for citywide anti-terrorist measures, and for restoration of destroyed infrastructure. He made frequent appearances on radio and television on September 11 and afterwards ‚Äî for example, to indicate that tunnels would be closed as a precautionary measure, and that there was no reason to believe that the dispersion of chemical or biological weaponry into the air was a factor in the attack. When Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal suggested that the attacks were an indication that the United States \\"should re-examine its policies in the Middle East and adopt a more balanced stand toward the Palestinian cause\\", Giuliani asserted, :There is no moral equivalent for this [terrorist] act. There is no justification for it... And one of the reasons I think this happened is because people were engaged in moral equivalency in not understanding the difference between liberal democracies like the United States, like Israel, and terrorist states and those who condone terrorism. So I think not only are those statements wrong, they're part of the problem. Giuliani subsequently rejected the prince's $10 million donation to disaster relief in the aftermath of the attack. Giuliani claimed on August 9, 2007 that \\"I was at Ground Zero as often, if not more, than most workers.... I was there working with them. I was exposed to exactly the same things they were exposed to. So in that sense, I'm one of them.\\" This angered NY Fire and Police personnel 911 workers. A New York Times study a week later found that he spent a total of 29 hours over three months at the site; his appointment logs were unavailable for the six days immediately following the attacks. This contrasted with recovery workers at the site who spent this much time at the site in two to three days. The recovery workers often spent hundreds of hours working 8- to 12-hour shifts. \\"America's Mayor\\" In the wake of the attacks, Giuliani was hailed by many for his leadership during the crisis. When polled just six weeks after the attack Giuliani received a 79% approval rating among New York City voters, a dramatic increase over the 36% rating he had received a year earlier ‚Äî seven years into his administration.Quinnipiac University Poll, published October 24, 2001. Accessed March 4, 2007. New York State (NY) Poll * March 2, 2000 * Giuliani Leads Clinton 48-41 P - Quinnipiac University In his public statements, Giuliani mirrored the emotions of New Yorkers after the September 11 attacks: shock, sadness, anger, resolution to rebuild, and the desire for justice to be done to those responsible. \\"Tomorrow New York is going to be here\\", he said. \\"And we're going to rebuild, and we're going to be stronger than we were before...I want the people of New York to be an example to the rest of the country, and the rest of the world, that terrorism can't stop us.\\" Giuliani was widely praised by some for his close involvement with the rescue and recovery efforts, but others, including many police, rescue workers, and families of WTC victims argue that \\"Giuliani has exaggerated the role he played after the terrorist attacks, casting himself as a hero for political gain.\\" As an avid and public fan of the New York Yankees, who won four World Series Championships during his time as mayor, Giuliani was frequently sighted at Yankee games, often accompanied by his son. On September 21, 2001, the first game was played in New York City after the attacks, with the New York Mets at home facing the Atlanta Braves. Despite his being a Yankee fan, the crowd cheered for him and for his leadership over the preceding days. The term \\"America's Mayor\\", now in common usage among Giuliani supporters, was coined by Oprah Winfrey at a 9/11 memorial service held at Yankee Stadium on September 23, 2001. Mayoral term extension proposal The 9/11 attack occurred on the scheduled date of the mayoral primary to select the Democratic and Republican candidates to succeed Giuliani. The primary was immediately delayed two weeks to September 25. During this period, Giuliani sought an unprecedented three-month emergency extension of his term, from its scheduled expiration on January 1 to April 1, due to the circumstances of the emergency besetting the city. He threatened to challenge the law imposing term limits on elected New York City officials and run for another full four-year term, if the primary candidates did not consent to permit the extension of his mayoralty. Advocates for the extension contended that Giuliani was needed to manage the initial requests for funds from Albany and Washington, speed up recovery, and slow down the exodus of jobs from lower Manhattan to outside New York City. Although a provision for emergency extensions is written into the New York State Constitution (Article 3 Section 25), in the end leaders in the State Assembly and Senate indicated that they did not believe the extension was necessary. The election proceeded as scheduled, and the winning candidate, the Giuliani-endorsed Republican Michael Bloomberg, took office on January 1, 2002 per normal custom. Time Person of the Year On December 24, 2001, Time magazine named Giuliani its Person of the Year for 2001. Time observed that, prior to 9/11, the public image of Giuliani had been that of a rigid, self-righteous, ambitious politician. After 9/11, and perhaps owing also to his bout with prostate cancer, his public image had been reformed to that of a man who could be counted on to unite a city in the midst of its greatest crisis. Thus historian Vincent J. Cannato concluded in September 2006, \\"With time, Giuliani's legacy will be based on more than just 9/11. He left a city immeasurably better off ‚Äî safer, more prosperous, more confident ‚Äî than the one he had inherited eight years earlier, even with the smoldering ruins of the World Trade Center at its heart. Debates about his accomplishments will continue, but the significance of his mayoralty is hard to deny.\\" Handling of the Ground Zero air quality issue Giuliani has been subject to increased criticism for downplaying the health effects of the air in the Financial District and lower Manhattan areas in the vicinity of the Ground Zero.Ben Smith, \\"Rudy's Black Cloud\\", New York Daily News, September 18, 2006, p. 14 He moved quickly to reopen Wall Street, and it was reopened on September 17. He said, in the first month after the attacks, \\"The air quality is safe and acceptable.\\"Anita Gates, \\"Buildings Rise from Rubble while Health Crumbles,\\" \\"New York Times,\\" September 11, 2006, reporting on the documentary, \\"Dust to Dust: The Health Effects of 9/11\\" However, in the weeks after the attacks, the United States Geological Survey identified hundreds of asbestos hot spots of debris dust that remained on buildings. By the end of the month the USGS reported that the toxicity of the debris was akin to that of drain cleaner. It would eventually be determined that a wide swath of lower Manhattan and Brooklyn had been heavily contaminated by highly caustic and toxic materials.C&En;: Cover Story - Chemical Analysis Of A Disaster The city's health agencies, such as the Department of Environmental Protection, did not supervise or issue guidelines for the testing and cleanup of private buildings. Instead, the city left this responsibility to building owners. Firefighters, police and their unions, have criticized Giuliani over the issue of protective equipment and illnesses after the attacks. An October 2001 study by the National Institute of Environmental Safety and Health said that cleanup workers lacked adequate protective gear.Democracy Now!  New Yorkers Tell Federal Officials To Stop Ignoring 9/11's Health Effects Wayne Barrett, \\"Rudy Giuliani's 5 Big Lies About 9/11: On the Stump, Rudy Can't Help Spreading Smoke and Ashes About His Dubious Record,\\" Village Voice August 8‚Äì14, 2007, p. 35-36. The Executive Director of the National Fraternal Order of Police, Sally Regenhard, reportedly said of Giuliani: \\"Everybody likes a Churchillian kind of leader who jumps up when the ashes are still falling and takes over. But two or three good days don't expunge an eight-year record.\\" she went on to say, \\"There's a large and growing number of both FDNY families, FDNY members, former and current, and civilian families who want to expose the true failures of the Giuliani administration when it comes to 9/11.\\" She told the New York Daily News that she intends to \\"Swift Boat\\" Giuliani.Ben Smith, Rudy's Black Cloud: WTC Health Risks may hurt Prez Bid.\\" \\"New York Daily News,\\" September 18, 2006, p. 14 A May 14, 2007 New York Times article, \\"Ground Zero Illness Clouding Giuliani's Legacy,\\" gave the interpretation that thousands of workers at Ground Zero have become sick and that \\"many regard Mr. Giuliani's triumph of leadership as having come with a human cost.\\" The article reported that Giuliani seized control of the cleanup of Ground Zero, taking control away from experienced federal agencies, such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Army Corps of Engineers and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. He instead handed over responsibility to the \\"largely unknown\\" city Department of Design and Construction. Documents indicate that the Giuliani administration never enforced federal requirements requiring the wearing of respirators. Concurrently, the administration threatened companies with dismissal if cleanup work slowed.Anthony DePalma, \\"Ground Zero Illness Clouding Giuliani's Legacy,\\" \\"New York Times,\\" May 14, 2007 or https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/14/nyregion/14giuliani.html?hp The New York Times faulted his decision-making on the post September 11 cleanup of the World Trade Center site, in the lead editorial of the May 22, 2007 issue. Additionally, the Times took Giuliani to task for his handling of worker safety at the site and the issue of first responder health problems. Giuliani wrote to the city's Congressional delegation and urged that the city's liability for Ground Zero illnesses be limited, in total, at $350 million. Two years after Giuliani finished his term, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) appropriated $1 billion to a special insurance fund to protect the city against 9/11 lawsuits.Anthony DePalma, \\"Ground Zero Illness Clouding Giuliani's Legacy,\\" \\"New York Times,\\" May 14, 2007 or https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/14/nyregion/14giuliani.html?pagewanted=3&ei;=5070&en;=649d398b3ba5c8d4&ex;=1180411200 In 2007, then-Senator Hillary Clinton contemplated calling Giuliani to testify before a Senate committee on whether the government failed to protect recovery workers from the effects of polluted Ground Zero air. Matt Taibbi wrote an article for the June 14, 2007 issue of Rolling Stone, blaming Giuliani for rushing the recovery effort and setting a poor example for recovery workers.Matt Taibbi, \\"Giuliani: Worse Than Bush: He's cashing in on 9/11, working with Karl Rove's henchmen and in cahoots with a Swift Boat-style attack on Hillary. Will Rudy Giuliani be Bush III?\\" \\"Rolling Stone\\" June 14, 2007 In June 2007, former Republican Governor of New Jersey and director of the Environmental Protection Agency Christie Whitman reportedly stated that the EPA had pushed for workers at the WTC site to wear respirators but that she had been blocked by Giuliani. She stated that she believed that the subsequent lung disease and deaths suffered by WTC responders were a result of these actions. Former deputy mayor Joe Lhota, who had by then joined Giuliani's presidential campaign, replied, \\"All workers at Ground Zero were instructed repeatedly to wear their respirators.\\" A safety professional who worked at Ground Zero added, \\"I was absolutely aghast at the refusal of the workers at ground zero to wear the personal protective equipment. All of my efforts to convince these guys to wear the masks was for naught.\\" Aftermath of Ground Zero recovery effort In February 2007, the International Association of Fire Fighters issued a letter accusing Giuliani of \\"egregious acts\\" against the 343 firemen who had died in the September 11th attacks. The letter asserted that Giuliani rushed to conclude the recovery effort once gold and silver had been recovered from World Trade Center vaults and thereby prevented the remains of many victims from being recovered: \\"Mayor Giuliani's actions meant that fire fighters and citizens who perished would either remain buried at Ground Zero forever, with no closure for families, or be removed like garbage and deposited at the Fresh Kills Landfill,\\" it said, adding: \\"Hundreds remained entombed in Ground Zero when Giuliani gave up on them.\\" Lawyers for the International Association of Fire Fighters seek to interview Giuliani under oath as part of a federal legal action alleging that New York City negligently dumped body parts and other human remains in the Fresh Kills Landfill. 9/11 Commission and family protests A book later published by Commission members Thomas Kean and Lee H. Hamilton, Without Precedent: The Inside Story of the 9/11 Commission, maintained that the Commission had not pursued a tough enough line of questioning with Giuliani when he appeared before the Commission, because its members were afraid of public outcry. Family members had interrupted the proceedings, demanding an explanation from Giuliani for the lack of working radios. Some were removed from the hearing. The Commission had experienced criticism the morning of Giuliani's testimony for allegedly implying that police and firefighters had not done their jobs properly with their hard questions directed to some of Giuliani's staff the previous day. Commission member John Lehman had said that New York City's disaster planning was \\"not worthy of the Boy Scouts, let alone this great city.\\" The morning of Giuliani's testimony, the New York Post ran a picture of a New York firefighter with the headline \\"Insult\\" in response to Lehman's statement. Some family members of 9/11 victims have openly criticized Giuliani for the significant communication failures that occurred on that day, believing that the lack of working walkie-talkies put the lives of first responders in significant danger. They say that the lack of radios had been a complaint of emergency services responders for years but was never dealt with and led to deaths of first responders in building collapses for which they should have been warned. In December 2006, Sally Regenhard, mother of firefighter Christian Regenhard who died on September 11, and co-founder of the Skyscraper Safety Campaign, vowed to expose the truths of Giuliani's actions on 9/11 before 2008, stating, \\"I can't see why any 9/11 family member who knows the truth about the failures of the Giuliani administration ... would not be outraged.\\" She said in April 2007, \\"The bitter truth is that Rudy Giuliani is building a path to the White House over the bodies of 343 firefighters.\\" By April 2007 it was reported that Giuliani had been forced to limit his appearances in New York City due to the increasing protests by family members of 9/11 victims, particularly police, fire and other emergency workers.

Biography His mother was Polish and his father was a French soldier who was serving in the Crimean War. He was raised in Lw√≥w, then Poland, now Ukraine. At first, he studied technical subjects in Graz. After being wounded in a duel, he went to recuperate in Italy.Brief biography @ Agra Art. While there, he decided to pursue an artistic career instead. The Dream He began his studies in Vienna and Munich (1876), then went to D√ºsseldorf (1877), and finally to Paris, where he enrolled at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts (1877‚Äì1884), completing his studies with Henri Lehmann and Isidore Pils. He had his first showing at the Salon in 1879. During his time there, he worked for Le Monde Illustr√©, L'Illustration and L'Univers illustr√©. He also served as a correspondent in Russia and Austria. After graduating, he became a French citizen and settled in Paris. In 1896, thanks to the influence of his brother , a prominent colonial administrator, he was appointed official painter for the \\"Minist√®re de la Marine et des Colonies\\". In this position, he made trips to the Canary Islands, Senegal, Sudan, Kongo, Tunisia, Mauretania, Somalia and Guiana. As would be expected, his works increasingly came to focus on exotic themes.

Early years Baker was born in Brookline, Massachusetts, the middle child of William, who owned his own plumbing business, and Bertha (n√©e August) Baker. He had two brothers, Alan and Malcolm, and described his upbringing as \\"middle-middle class.\\" As the middle child, he referred to himself as \\"the pickle in the middle\\" and dreamed of being in musicals. He began acting in kindergarten, where he was cast as an elephant in school, and from fourth grade on, he was \\"constantly\\" on stage, eventually becoming the vice president of Brookline High School's dramatic society. While his brothers followed his father into plumbing, Baker stuck to acting. After graduating from high school, in 1962, he went to Boston University, where he majored in acting. He graduated in 1966. Throughout college, he appeared in the Spa Music Theatre in Saratoga Springs, New York, with Boston University's Theatre Division, and with the Harvard Summer Players at the Loeb Drama Center. Theatre Baker described himself as a \\"skinny, silly shlump.\\" He played offbeat characters, which he described as being \\"long, skinny funny-looking goofy types.\\" Coming out of college, Baker claimed to have offers to do theatre in New York, which he turned down out of fear of being reduced to \\"a spear carrier.\\" Instead, he accepted an offer from Richard Block, the director of the Actors Theatre of Louisville (ATL) in Kentucky, to be a journeyman, rounding out its 10 principal cast members: In September 1966, he made his acting debut, playing Tom Stark in All the King's Men, at ATL. The following year, he made Actors' Equity and earned the minimum, $125 per week (approximately $950 in 2019). He remained at ATL through May 1968. He then went to the Center Stage in Baltimore until he made his Off Broadway debut in 1969 in City Scene. He followed with three plays by Israel Horovitz at the Manhattan Theatre Club, a performance in The Year Boston Won the Pennant at Lincoln Center, as well as roles in Summertree and The Real Inspector Hound. In 1974, Baker went to Paris, where he performed two Israel Horovitz one-act plays: Hop Scotch and Spared. The same year, he made his Broadway debut in The Freedom of the Theatre. In 1976, he performed with the Phoenix Company in Secret Service, Boy Meets Girl, Pericles, Prince of Tyre, and The Merry Wives of Windsor. He later did a season with the New York Shakespeare Festival, during which he appeared in Henry V and Measure for Measure. However, his biggest performance was in I Love My Wife. Beyond Broadway, Baker performed in other regional theater productions in Chicago, St. Louis, and his native Boston. He spent five summers at the O'Neill Center's National Playwrights Conference and its Theatre for the Deaf in Waterford, Connecticut, working with young playwrights. He called his time at the O'Neill Theatre his \\"best training,\\" stating that watching the deaf taught him to be \\"so brazen with the comic use of his body.\\" In August 1977, Baker's Broadway contract was due to be re-negotiated. He was hesitant to commit to more than one year, stating: Film and television Baker appeared in a number of television shows, such as Kojak, Starsky and Hutch, The Rockford Files, and Taxi. In 1973, he appeared in the acclaimed TV film Pueblo. His most prominent film roles include The Paper Chase and the lead in Next Stop, Greenwich Village, Paul Mazursky's 1976 semi-autobiographical film. Personal life At the height of his career, Baker was 6'0\\" and 145 pounds. He was knob-kneed and was described as a \\"long, lean and lanky, stringbean of a chap with the most formidable nose in entertainment since Jimmy Durante.\\" It was often due to his physique and nose that he got auditions, jobs and laughs. However, as a child, Baker had been self-conscious about his body, particularly his prominent nose: On opening night of I Love My Wife, his apartment was burglarized. Along with his television set, his bar-mitzvah ring was stolen. Baker was a feminist. In 1977, during his run of I Love My Wife, he used his fame to vocally state his dissatisfaction with The Shubert Organization ‚Äì‚Äì the organization running the Barrymore Theatre, where the play was being performed ‚Äì‚Äì about pay equity: Baker was a proponent of actors going to college, believing a \\"good liberal education is essential\\" to grounding actors in all the arts. Later in his career, he expressed wanting to become a playwright and forming a repertory company with Paul Mazursky and Leonard Nimoy. Little is known of Baker's romantic life. In 1976, he claimed to be \\"dedicated to remaining a bachelor,\\" but alluded to serious romances with \\"two or three\\" women. Death In August 1978, Baker's career began to be cut short by illness. \\"A serious throat ailment,\\" according to articles in the Detroit Free Press and the Hartford Courant published during that month, caused him to leave the cast of the pre- Broadway show Broadway, Broadway. His final television performance was a guest-star appearance on the sitcom Taxi in 1979. His last noted stage performance was in March 1980, in which he reprised the one-act Horovitz plays he had performed in Paris. He later was diagnosed with Medullary thyroid cancer. Decades after Baker's death, commentator David Ehrenstein speculated in LA Weekly that Baker had suffered from AIDS, then known as \\"gay-related immune deficiency\\" (GRID), for approximately two years until his death. Ehrenstein's 2003 LA Weekly essay includes a quote from actor Anthony Holland that indicates that Baker lived in Los Angeles in 1980. As Baker's illness worsened, he moved to Miami to live with his parents. There is no reliable source to confirm that his illness was indeed HIV-related. He died on April 12, 1982 at the Community Hospital of South Broward in Hallandale Beach, Florida. He is buried in Lindwood Memorial Park in Randolph, Massachusetts.

The plant acquired its common name from the observation that it cured scurvy, and it was taken on board ships in dried bundles or distilled extracts. Its very bitter taste was usually disguised with herbs and spices; however, this did not prevent scurvygrass drinks and sandwiches becoming a popular fad in the UK until the middle of the nineteenth century, when citrus fruits became more readily available. Description Cochlearia officinalis is a biennial/perennial, growing to . The stems are hairless and long stalked with fleshy leaves. The leaves are heart or kidney shaped, the lower stems leaves form a rosette around the base of the plant. It is in flower from May to August, they are small, and come in white or lilac, with four daisy-like petals. The seeds ripen from July to September, they are globe shaped. The small, round seeds are reddish brown. The flowers are hermaphrodite and are pollinated by bees, flies, and beetles. The plant is self-fertile. It is also noted for attracting wildlife and not being frost tender. Taxonomy It is commonly known as 'common scurvy-grass', 'scurvy-grass' and 'spoonwort'. It was formerly described by the Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus in his seminal publication 'Species Plantarum' in 1753, on page 647. The specific epithet officinalis, refers to the Linnaeus term for plants with an established medicinal, culinary, or other use. It has one known subspecies, Cochlearia officinalis subsp. integrifolia (Hartm.) Nordal & Stabbetorp. Distribution and habitat Cochlearia officinalis in Prague Cochlearia officinalis is a temperate native to Europe. =Range= It is found within Eastern Europe, in the Russian Federation, (within the Administrative centre of Arkhangelsk, Komi, Murmansk and Nenets). In Middle Europe, within Belgium, Germany, Netherlands and Switzerland. In Northern Europe, within Iceland, Denmark, the Faroe Islands, Finland, Ireland, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom. In Southwestern Europe within France. It has also naturalised in other parts of Europe such as Italy and Spain. Habitat It grows in the coastal and mountainous regions of Europe, including the Alps. In Ireland, it prefers saltmarshes, coastal cliffs and walls, and rocky, muddy seashores. In Northern Scandinavia, it grows in gravel beaches, crevices in beach cliffs and salt marshes. Uses It was once used as Herbalists as a cure for Scurvy, as the plant contains Vitamin C. Nicholas Culpeper wrote in his book 'Complete Herbal', of Scurvygrass that its chief good effect is when used 'by those that have the scurvy' and that it 'is of singular good effect to cleanse the blood, liver and spleen, taking the juice in the Spring every morning fasting in a cup of drink. The leaves were also made into a beer called 'scurvygrass ale', it has been occasionally re-made as a craft ale.

It is notable in that it foresaw the importance of adaptive computer technology in the lives of future generations of disabled people. It is also an early example of discourse on disability politics, treatment of the disabled throughout history, and hit-or-miss relations and perceptions between the disabled and able-bodied communities. Plot Arthur Lane is a young boy with profound cerebral palsy, who is unable to walk, talk, feed himself, or sit unsupported. He is abandoned in a grim hospital in the north of England in 1921, at the age of seven. His family believe they are sending him to a specialised facility for the good of all, where they will have the equipment and expertise to give him a better life. In reality he is subject to extreme cruelty and neglect. Through his decades-long ordeal, his faith in the 'Skallagrigg' ‚Äì a special being with a keen empathy for people with his disabilities ‚Äì sustains him, and stories grow up about Arthur and the Skallagrigg. Half a century later comes Esther ‚Äì a keenly intelligent teenager who also has cerebral palsy, but whose talents are recognised in a more enlightened age. Her mother died at her birth due to a fatal car accident, and as a result, Esther was delivered prematurely by caesarian section ‚Äì which is implied to have possibly contributed to her condition. Since her father, Richard, is unable to cope with her condition and the loss of her mother, Esther is bounced between multiple foster parents ‚Äì who struggle to cope with her profoundly demanding and unique medical needs ‚Äì before winding up at a home for disabled children called the Dale Centre. There she meets Peter Rowne ‚Äì an even more disabled, even more intelligent boy slightly older than her, Karen ‚Äì a severely learning-disabled 'frienemy', and Tom ‚Äì a docile and courageous, though sometimes invasive young boy with Down syndrome, who becomes her lifelong ally and protector. At the age of eleven, Esther takes up residence with her father, and finally manages to communicate her intelligence to him with Tom's help (specialists had emphatically cautioned her father and able-bodied carers not to see intelligence that wasn't there). She is subsequently sent off to Netherton ‚Äì an adapted school for highly gifted disabled students. Having squandered her first term, the death of Peter Rowne from pneumonia, and her recently reconnected Grandmother's firm words, inspire a reformation in her, and she does exceptionally well. There she ponders the life questions every teenager does ‚Äì love, marriage, sex, friendships, jobs, future living, but with the added fear and uncertainty of her disability. She also learns about the terrible conditions disabled people have had to endure, both in the past and in her lifetime. Through all of this she grows up with the myth of the Skallagrigg, and the secret stories told among the disabled community through non-verbal language. She eventually realises that these stories are real, told by a real person and describing a real place. Piecing them together with the help of her friends and family, she eventually discovers Arthur, the true identity of the Skallagrigg, the characters in the story, and the fact that Arthur has an estranged son and grandson, reuniting Arthur with his beloved Skallagrigg. Following this, Esther becomes interested in writing computer games, and carries on written conversation with Daniel, an American computer graphics genius. Together they develop first a friendship, then, when he comes to England, a relationship which develops into a marriage. Meanwhile, Esther obsessively works on writing a computer game based on her experiences finding the Skallagrigg, her sense that Arthur's grandson should have the chance to discover his family (despite Arthur's belief that it would be better for him not to know what his grandfather was), and her own anguish at not being able to do more for Daniel, and for their infant child, due to her severe disabilities. The work, giving birth, and the relentless frustration and upset, take a heavy toll on her mental and physical health, which is exacerbated by frailty caused by her cerebral palsy ‚Äì but she remains surrounded by love and purpose throughout. The story ends with Arthur's son and grandson, Esther's granddaughter, father, husband and son, and Tom, all reuniting and reconciling ‚Äì having been torn apart by Esther's death and by Richard's marriage to Kate and subsequent emigration to Australia. Screen adaptation Skallagrigg was shown on BBC2's Screen Two in 1994 with screenplay by Nigel Williams and won a BAFTA for Best Single Drama in 1995. It starred John McArdle, Richard Briers, Nick Brimble, Kerry Noble and Ian Dury.Skallagrigg on IMDB Its screenplay and plot are a dramatically abridged version of the original book, and all the characters suffer from far milder disabilities than those in the book. A teenage Esther has been living in the Dale Centre where Tom and Peter also reside. Her estranged father has been failing to sell sports equipment overseas. Esther, meanwhile, has been trying to discover the identity of Arthur and the Skallagrigg, and enlists her father's help. At first her father is quite clueless as to how to cope with her disability, and she is upset with him for having abandoned her in favour of an easier, less restricted life. However, as their search takes them across the country, their bond grows and they become closer and more protective of each other. The story ends with him carrying her upstairs to bed, whereas he had left her to crawl up on her own at the start. The plot threads concerning Daniel, Arthur's family, the computer game, and Esther's extended family, are all left out.

During this siege some of the Gallic mercenaries engaged in the service of the Carthaginians began planning to betray the fortress into the hands of the Romans. But Alexon, who had on a former occasion saved the town of Agrigentum from a similar attempt of treacherous mercenaries, now acted in the same spirit, and gave information of the plot to the Carthaginian commander Himilco. He also assisted him in inducing the remaining mercenaries to stay faithful and resist the temptations offered by their comrades.Polybius, i. 43, ii. 7  References  Category:Ancient Achaeans Category:Ancient Greek mercenaries Category:Carthaginian commanders of the First Punic War Category:3rd-century BC Greek people ","title":"Alexon"},{"id":"11804183","text":"India Tower (previously known as the Park Hyatt Tower; also known as the Dynamix Balwas Tower or DB Tower) is a canceled 126-story, megatall skyscraper that began construction in the city of Mumbai, India, in 2010.

It is southwest of West Wollongong and connected to Wollongong by the Princes Highway and The Avenue. At the junction of the highway and The Avenue is Figtree Grove, a two-storey indoor shopping centre with a Woolworths, Coles and Kmart. The shopping centre was opened in 1965. The second story is used by a couple of businesses and a second storey to its carpark facilities. Adjacent to the centre is a park which contains sports facilities, a baby health centre and a small sculpture garden. There is a small commercial district near this junction and another connected area of mainly food stores further north on the highway near the freeway entrance. There is also another commercial area with a chicken food shop, liquor store and video rental store on the east side of the highway at the O'Briens Road junction. Figtree has a hotel, an oval, many specialty stores, a dog park, a private hospital and several schools. A smaller area of residences in Figtree is Figtree Heights, a neighbourhood which is slightly raised above the general level of Figtree. To the suburb's south between Figtree and Unanderra is Cobbler's Hill, where houses have been built on its side. History The suburb is named after a giant fig tree that once stood on the eastern side of the highway at the junction with O'Brien's Road, a mountain pass used in early days of settlement built by subscription in 1821 before completion by convict labour of Mount Keira road. In 1861 Figtree Bridge was built by Moore and Vaughan. In 1867 Figtree Inn was built, a small weatherboard building built at the site of the turnoff to O'Brien's Road, later its name changed to Figtree Hotel and it still stands. In the 1880s farming was the main industry in the area. In 1888 the Figtree Sunday School began in a cottage.Figtree - History On 25 November 1903 Figtree Park was opened by senator Hugh Vaughan-Floyd, 12 years before his death in World War I.

On 23 September 1965 Westfield Figtree was opened. It was expanded in 1974, and further expansions were completed in 2009, with another 15 specialty stores being added, and a \\"mini-department store\\" (The Reject Shop) making it one of the largest centres in the region. It now ranks in the top 5. It was sold in August 2015 and renamed Figtree Grove in September 2015. On 15 October 1979, the Illawarra Private Hospital was opened. The famous figtree was cut down in 1996 and only a small portion of its trunk is left. In 1998 Fig Tree Park was renovated with an aboriginal mosaic as a result of a community project. The name has been changed to Moreton Bay Figtree Park. During the 1998 Wollongong floods, Figtree was one of the worst suburbs hit with flood waters going through the Westfield shopping centre and residents being rescued by the SES from Figtree Caravan Park.

Professional history In 1974, Wentz launched Gull Laboratories as a one-man operation and developed a test for diagnosing Epstein-Barr virus infection. The company was later sold to Fresenius, a German medical products company, in 1994, although Wentz continued as Chairman until 1998. Wentz sold his controlling interests in Gull Laboratories in 1992 and founded USANA Health Sciences in the same year. Wentz also founded the Sanoviv Medical Institute in 1998, an alternative and holistic medicine center located near Rosarito, Mexico. Wentz served as President of Sanoviv from 1999-2010.

Through Gull Holdings, Wentz owns 51% of USANA. Shareholder lawsuit On April 4, 2007, Wentz was named as a defendant in a class-action lawsuit brought against USANA by company shareholders. The suit alleged that USANA presented materially false and misleading information about the company‚Äôs financial situation and business practices. Included in the allegations were that USANA's business model was unsustainable and amounted to a pyramid scheme. The suit cited several allegations from a report released by Barry Minkow and the Fraud Discovery Institute.

It ended in Swedish victory.  Background  On September 8, 1655, Swedish forces under King Charles X Gustav entered Warsaw, which had been abandoned by John II Casimir of Poland on August 18. At the same time, in the village of Mogilno near Zakroczym, Mazovian lev√©e en masse gathered to fight the invaders. It was commanded by Voivode of P≈Çock, Jan Kazimierz Krasinski. Swedish forces, including such units, as J√§mtlands f√§ltj√§garregemente and Norrlands dragonregemente, sent from Warsaw to face the Poles, decided to cross the Narew near Nowy Dwor Mazowiecki. The battle On September 21, the Swedes approached Nowy Dwor. Polish camp was located on a 30-meter hill, located at the confluence of the Vistula and Bugonarew. Swedish troops quickly captured Nowy Dwor and began construction of a bridge. Their commandant, Gustaf Otto Stenbock was well aware of the fact that in previous battles, the Polish szlachta of the lev√©e en masse had capitulated to the Swedes without fighting. Therefore, on September 28, Stenbock urged the Poles to capitulate, but their offer was rejected. An exchange of fire began, in which Swedish artillery had an advantage. Covered by the cannons, Swedish reiters crossed the Narew, finishing construction of the bridge, and digging trenches, which protected the river crossing. In the morning of September 30, Stenbock's army crossed the river and attacked Polish positions. The battle took place in the area where now the district of Modlin is located. Swedish fire forced the Masurians to withdraw north. Mobility of Polish units prevented them from complete destruction, as the Swedes were too slow to chase them. Polish losses amounted to some 300 killed. On the next day the Poles counterattacked, but without success. Swedish advance continued, and the invaders captured Pu≈Çtusk.  Aftermath  Swedish victory opened the road towards the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Livonia, while Swedish engineers noticed strategic importance of the location of the battle. In the following months, they constructed here a permanent fortified position, the so-called Bugskansen. This star-shaped military camp was main supply depot and concentration point of the Swedish-Brandenburgian army during the Battle of Warsaw. In the early 19th century, the Modlin Fortress was built in the location of the Bugskansen.

It is a Eurasian blue wildflower native to Denmark and England and now naturalized in southeast Ireland. It is also found southward through much of Europe into Africa. Common names The alternate name throatwort is derived from an old belief that C. trachelium is a cure for sore throat, and the species name trachelium refers to its use as treatment of the throat in folk medicine. Other folknames include Our Lady's Bells because the color blue was identified with the Virgin Mary's scarf, veil, or shawl; Coventry Bells because C. trachelium was especially common in fields around Coventry; and \\"Bats-in-the-Belfry\\" or in the singular \\"Bat-in-the-Belfry\\", because the stamens inside the flower were like bats hanging in the bell of a church steeple. Description Close-up showing the fine hairs on the leaves and petals of C. trachelium on the GR 5 by the river Doubs Campanula trachelium is a perennial plant with one or more unbranched, often reddish, square-edged stems that are roughly hairy. The leaves grow alternately up the stems. The lower leaves are long- stalked and ovate with a heart-shaped base. The upper leaves have no stalks and are ovate or lanceolate, hairy with toothed margins. The inflorescence is a one sided spike with a few slightly nodding flowers. Each flower has five sepals which are fused, erect and hairy, and the five violet (or occasionally white) petals are fused into a bell that is hairy inside. There are five stamens and a pistil formed from three fused carpels. The fruit is a hairy, nodding capsule. Habitat Campanula trachelium likes humus-rich soil and is found in broad-leaved woodlands, coppices, hedgerows and the margins of forests.

Born in Donard, County Wexford, Quigley was introduced to hurling in his youth. He enjoyed All-Ireland success at colleges level with St. Peter's College while simultaneously enjoying championship successes at underage levels with the Rathnure club. A three-time Leinster medal winner with the Rathnure senior team, Quigley also won nine championship medals. Quigley made his debut on the inter-county scene when he first linked up with the Wexford minor team. After little success in this grade, he later won an All-Ireland medal with the under-21 team. Quigley made his senior debut during the 1962‚Äì63 league. He went on to play a key role for Wexford in defence during a successful era, and won one All-Ireland medal, three Leinster medals and one National Hurling League medal. An All-Ireland runner-up on two occasions, Quigley captained the team to All-Ireland victory in 1968. As a member of the Leinster inter-provincial team, Quigley won three Railway Cup medals. Throughout his inter-county career he made 20 championship appearances. Quigley retired from inter-county hurling following the conclusion of the 1972 championship. Quigley's brothers ‚Äì Pat, John, Jimmy and Martin ‚Äì also played with distinction at all levels with Wexford. Regarded as one of the greatest players of all-time, Quigley was named as the Texaco Hurler of the Year in 1968. He was also chosen as one of the 125 greatest hurlers of all time in a 2009 poll. In retirement from playing Quigley became involved in team management and coaching at all levels with Rathnure. Playing career =College= During his schooling at St. Peter's College, Quigley established himself as a key member of the senior hurling team. In 1962 he won a Leinster medal following a 4‚Äì3 to 1‚Äì4 defeat of Kilkenny CBS. On 6 May 1962 St. Peter's faced Ennis CBS in the All-Ireland decider. A 4‚Äì11 to 2‚Äì4 victory gave Quigley an All-Ireland medal. =Club= Quigley was only seventeen years-old when he won his first championship medal at senior level following a defeat of St. Aidan's Enniscorthy. After a period of decline he won a second championship medal in 1967. In 1971 Quigley added a third championship medal to his collection as Rathnure defeated Enniscorthy District to take the title. He later won a Leinster medal as Rathnure defeated a disappointing Bennettsbridge by 2‚Äì12 to 1‚Äì8. On 14 May 1972 Rathnure faced Blackrock of Cork in the All-Ireland decider. Quigley top scored for Rathnure with 2‚Äì4 as they fought back from being 12 points in arrears, however, Pat Moylan's goal secured a 5‚Äì13 to 6‚Äì9 victory for Blackrock. Rathnure retained the title in 1972 following a 1‚Äì17 to 1‚Äì8 defeat of Rapparees before making it three-in-a-row in 1973 with a 2‚Äì7 to 1‚Äì7 defeat of Buffers Alley. Quigley subsequently secured a second Leinster medal following a 1‚Äì18 to 2‚Äì9 defeat of St. Rynagh's. On 17 March 1974 Rathnure faced old rivals Blackrock in the All- Ireland final. A tour de force by Quigley saw him score 3‚Äì6 in a 3‚Äì11 to 2‚Äì14 draw. The replay on 28 April 1974 was also a close affair. As Rathnure looked to be heading for victory, √âamonn O'Donoghue and Donie Collins scored two late goals to secure a 3‚Äì8 to 1‚Äì9 victory for Blackrock. Quigley won a sixth championship medal in 1974 as his 1‚Äì3 helped Rathnure to a 2‚Äì8 to 1‚Äì5 defeat of Oulart-the Ballagh and fourth successive title. In 1977 Quigley won a seventh championship medal as Buffers Alley were accounted for in the decider. He later claimed a third Leinster medal as Fenians were defeated by 0‚Äì16 to 1‚Äì10 in the provincial decider. On 27 March 1978 Rathnure faced St. Finbarr's of Cork in the All-Ireland final. Rathnure had an 0‚Äì8 to 0‚Äì1 half-time lead thanks to a gale-force wind, however, Barry Wiley scored the equaliser for St. Finbarr's with just ten minutes left to play. A Jimmy Barry-Murphy goal from a rebound sealed the title and resulted in a third All-Ireland final defeat for Quigley. Quigley finished off his club career by winning back-to-back championship medals in 1979 and 1980 following defeats of Faythe Harriers and Buffers Alley respectively. =Inter-county= Quigley first enjoyed success as the full-back on the inaugural Wexford under-21 team. He won his first Leinster medal in 1964 as Laois were defeated by 4‚Äì7 to 2‚Äì2. On 4 October 1964 Wexford faced Tipperary in the All-Ireland final. A tally of 2‚Äì2 for Babs Keating helped Tipperary to an easy 8‚Äì9 to 3‚Äì1 victory. Wexford retained the provincial under-21 title in 1965 with Quigley winning a second Leinster medal. The subsequent All-Ireland final was a repeat of the previous year with Tipperary providing the opposition once again. A 3‚Äì7 to 1‚Äì4 victory gave Quigley an All-Ireland Under-21 Hurling Championship medal. After making his senior debut during the 1962‚Äì63 league, Quigley was added to the Wexford panel for the subsequent championship. He remained an unused substitute during their Leinster semi-final exit at the hands of Kilkenny. Quigley made his senior championship debut at full-back in a 5‚Äì9 to 4‚Äì8 Leinster semi-final defeat by Kilkenny on 5 July 1964. In 1965 Quigley won his first Leinster medal following a narrow 2‚Äì11 to 3‚Äì7 defeat of reigning champions Kilkenny. Tipperary were Wexford's opponents in the subsequent All-Ireland final on 5 September 1965, however, the game failed to live up to the two classic games between the two sides in 1960 and 1962. Victory went to Tipperary on that occasion by 2‚Äì16 to 0‚Äì10, courtesy of a brace of goals by Se√°n McLoughlin. Quigley claimed his first national title in 1967 when a 3‚Äì10 to 1‚Äì9 defeat of Kilkenny gave him a National Hurling League medal. Quigley was appointed captain of the team in 1968 and he quickly collected a second Leinster medal following a 3‚Äì13 to 4‚Äì9 defeat of reigning provincial and All-Ireland champions Kilkenny. This victory allowed Wexford to advance to an All-Ireland final against Tipperary, the outstanding team of the decade, on 1 September 1968. All was going to plan for Tipperary as they took a 1‚Äì11 to 1‚Äì3 lead at half-time. In one of the great All-Ireland comebacks, Tony Doran got Wexford back on track with a goal six minutes after the interval. Three more goals followed from Paul Lynch, Jack Berry and Doran again. Late goals from Michael \\"Babs\\" Keating and Se√°n McLoughlin for Tipperary failed to stem the tide as Wexford secured a remarkable 5‚Äì8 to 3‚Äì12 victory. The victory gave Quigley his sole All-Ireland medal while he also had the honour of lifting the Liam MacCarthy Cup. After surrendering their championship titles in 1969, Wexford regrouped the following year. A 4‚Äì16 to 3‚Äì14 defeat of old rivals Kilkenny in the very first 80-minute championship game gave Quigley a third Leinster medal. Wexford subsequently faced Cork in the All-Ireland decider on 6 September 1970. A record 64-point scoreline and eleven goals were produced in a sometimes ill-tempered and disappointing contest. Tony Doran top scored for Wexford with two goals, however, the day belonged to Eddie O'Brien who scored a hat-trick of goals for Cork from his hand. A remarkable 6‚Äì21 to 5‚Äì10 score line gave Cork the victory. Quigley retired from inter-county hurling following the conclusion of the 1972 championship. =Inter-provincial= Quigley also lined out with Leinster in the inter-provincial series of games and enjoyed much success. In 1964 he was at full-back as Leinster faced Munster in the decider. A 3‚Äì7 to 2‚Äì9 victory gave him a Railway Cup medal. After being off the team for a few seasons, Quigley won a second Railway Cup medal in 1967 following a 2‚Äì14 to 3‚Äì5 defeat of Munster once again. After several years of Munster dominance, Leinster bounced back in 1971. A 2‚Äì17 to 2‚Äì12 defeat of Munster gave Quigley his third Railway Cup medal.

Unlike several other species in the genus, Chaerophyllum temulum is poisonous.Star√Ω, Franti≈°ek, Poisonous Plants (Hamlyn colour guides) ‚Äì pub. Paul Hamlyn April, 1984, translated from the Czech by Olga Kuthanov√°. Etymology The generic name Chaerophyllum is a compound of the Greek elements chairo 'to please' and phyllon a leaf, giving the meaning 'having pleasant foliage'. The specific name temulum or temulentum means 'drunken' - from the similarity of the symptoms elicited by poisoning by the plant to those of alcoholic intoxication.Royal Horticultural Society Dictionary of Gardening pub. Oxford University Press 1984 Volume I : A to CocculusBotanical Latin Stearn,William T., revised and annotated second edition first pub. 1973, 3rd impression 1980 David and Charles, Newton Abbot, Devon, U.K. Description Somewhat hispid, biennial herb. Stems to , solid, swollen below nodes, purple-spotted or wholly purple. Leaves bi- to tri-pinnate, dark green, appressed-hairy on both surfaces, longipetiolate: lobes mostly , ovate in outline, deeply toothed, the teeth contracted abruptly at the apex. Umbels compound, bearing usually 6-12 (occasionally as few as 4 or as many as 15) hairy rays usually long; peduncle longer than rays, hairy; terminal umbel with mostly hermaphrodite flowers, overtopped by lateral umbels, which have mostly male flowers. Bracts absent, or rarely 1-2; bracteoles 5-8, shorter than pedicels, ciliate, eventually deflexed. Flowers white; sepals absent; outer petals not radiating; styles with enlarged base, forming stylopodium. Fruit usually , slightly laterally compressed, oblong but narrowing toward apex, constricted at commissure; mericarps having broad, rounded ridges; carpophore present; vittae solitary, conspicuous; pedicels without a ring of hairs at apex; styles roughly as long as stylopodium, recurved; stigma capitate. Cotyledons tapered gradually at base without distinct petiole. Flowering time (in U.K.) : late May to early July. Ploidy Chromosome number of Chaerophyllum temulum and infraspecific taxa 2n = 14, 22. Distribution Chaerophyllum temulum is found throughout most of Europe, although it is rare in the Mediterranean region. Its range also extends into the Maghreb and Western Asia, including Turkey and the Caucasus. Within the United Kingdom the plant is common in most of England and Wales, but local and mainly Eastern in distribution in Scotland. In Ireland the plant is local and confined mainly to the Eastern half of the country. In much of England the plant is distinguishable from other umbelliferae by being the first of the common roadside species to flower after Anthriscus sylvestris, with other distinguishing features including hairy, purple-spotted stems and swollen tops to the internodes.Umbellifers of the British Isles Tutin T.G. BSBI Handbook No.2. Pub. Botanical Society of the British Isles,1980. Habitat Chaerophyllum temulum is a ruderal or pioneer species which will grow in a variety of situations, from damp places, such as waterside thickets, to open woodland, woodland edges, waste places, by walls and fences, in both lowland and hilly country. Ecology Pollen is collected by solitary bees. Toxicity Chaerophyllum temulum contains (mainly in the upper parts and fruits) a volatile alkaloid chaerophylline, as well as other (probably glycosidally bound) toxins, the chemistry and pharmacology of which has, as yet, been but little studied. Externally, the sap of the plant can cause inflammation of the skin and persistent rashes. If consumed, the plant causes gastro-intestinal inflammation, drowsiness, vertigo and cardiac weakness. Human poisonings have seldom been observed, because the plant lacks aromatic essential oils that could lead to its being confused with edible umbellifers used to flavour food. It is, however, used occasionally in folk medicine. Animal poisonings by the plant are commoner than those of humans, pigs and cattle thus intoxicated exhibiting a staggering gait, unsteady stance, apathy and severe, exhausting colic, ending sometimes in death. Such symptoms recall those caused by the toxic grass Lolium temulentum, the common darnel. Chaerophyllum bulbosum and Chaerophyllum hirsutum have also been reported to be toxic. Chaerophyllum temulum has been reported to contain the polyyne falcarinol and the compound falcarinone. Use in herbal medicine Chaerophyllum temulum has been used in folk medicine, in small doses, to treat arthritis, dropsy, and chronic skin complaints, and as a spring tonic. The early modern physician Boerhaave (1668‚Äì1738) once successfully used a decoction of the herb combined with Sarsaparilla to treat a woman suffering from leprosy ‚Äì in the course of which treatment temporary blindness was a severe side effect following each dose.

It was built by King Vira Someshwara of the Hoysala Empire in 1250 C.E. The dating of the temple is based on the style of the sculptures and architecture that compares closely with the contemporary Hoysala monuments at Javagal, Nuggehalli and Somanathapura. The town of Hosaholalu is about from Hassan and from the heritage city of Mysore, the cultural capital of Karnataka state.Foekema (1996), p71 Temple plan The temple is a splendid example of a trikuta vimana (three shrined) temple though only the central shrine exhibits a tower (superstructure or Shikhara) on top.Quote:\\"Depending on the number of towers, the temples are classified as ekakuta (one shrine and tower), dvikuta (two), trikuta (three), chatushkuta (four) and panchakuta (five). Most Hoysala temples are ekakuta, dvikuta or trikuta\\", Foekema (1996), p25 The lateral shrines are square in construction with five projections and no special features. The central shrine is well decorated and its tower has a sukanasi (called \\"nose\\") which is actually a lower tower over the vestibule that connects the shrine (cella containing the image of the deity) to the hall (mantapa). The sukanasi looks like an extension of the main tower over the central shrine.Foekema (1996), p22 The material used for the temple construction is chloritic schist, more commonly known as Soapstone.Kamath (2001), p136 The temple is built on a jagati (platform), a Hoysala innovation that elevates the temple by about a metre.Quote:\\"The Jagati serves the purpose of a pradakshinapatha (circumambulation) as the shrine has no such arrangement\\", Kamath (2001), p135Quote:\\"This is a Hosala innovation\\", According to art critic Gerard Foekema, the temple as a whole exhibits the \\"new style\\" and belongs to the 2nd phase of Hoysala building activity (13th century), with two sets of eaves, and six moldings at the base of the outer wall.Quote:\\"A eave is a projecting roof overhanging a wall\\", Foekema (1996), p93 The first eave is located where the superstructure meets the temple outer wall and the second eave runs around the temple and about a metre below the first eave. In between the two eaves are decorative miniature towers on pilasters (called Aedicule), with sculptured wall images of Hindu deities and their attendants below the second eave. Being a Vaishnava temple (a Hindu sect), most of the images represent some form of Hindu god Vishnu, his consort and his attendants. There are a hundred and twenty such images. In all there are twenty four sculptures of Vishnu standing upright holding in his four arms the four attributes, a conch, a wheel, a lotus and a mace in all possible permutations.Foekema (1966), p72 Below the panel of deities is the base of the wall consisting of six decorative rectangular moldings of equal width which run all around the temple.Quote:\\"Generally, Hoysala temples built in the 13th century have 6 mouldings (\\"new style\\") while those built a century earlier have 5 mouldings (\\"old style\\")\\" Foekema (1996), p28 The six horizontal mouldings are intricately sculptured and are called friezes.Quote:\\"A rectangular band of stone decorated with sculpture\\", Foekema (1996), p93 Seen from top to bottom; the first frieze depicts birds (hansa), the second depicts aquatic monsters (makara), the third frieze has depictions of Hindu epics and other mythological and puranic stories narrated in the clockwise direction (direction of devotee circumambulation), the fourth frieze has leafy scrolls, the fifth and sixth friezes have a procession of horses and elephants respectively.Foekema (1966), p29 In the frieze that depicts the epics, the Ramayana starts from the western corner of the southern shrine and the Mahabharata starts from the northern side of the central shrine vividly illustrating the demise of many heroes of the famous war between Pandavas and Kauravas.Foekema (1966), p72 The interior of the temple consists of a closed hall (mantapa) of modest size with four polished lathe turned pillars supporting the roof.Quote:\\"This is a common feature of Western Chalukya- Hoysala temples\\", Kamath (2001), p117 The four central pillars divide the hall into nine equal \\"bays\\" (compartments) and nine decorated ceilings.Quote:\\"A bay is a square or rectangular compartment in the hall\\", Foekema (1966), p93 The sanctum of the three shrines contain the images of Venugopala, Narayana in the middle and Lakshminarasimha; all forms (Avatar) of Vishnu.

It is widespread across much of Europe. It is a large, biennial herb with sharp spines on the tips of the leaves, and long, woolly hairs on much of the herbage. Flower heads are large and nearly spherical, with spines on the outside and many purple disc florets but no ray florets. Flower head of C. eriophorum in Kozara National Park, Republika Srpska, Bosnia and Herzegovina Description A tall, biennial herb, C. eriophorum reaches heights of . The strong, branched stem is densely woolly hairy but has no wings. The stiff leaves are usually pinnate with strong, yellow spines; the lowest leaves are up to long. The leaf margins are rolled over and the underside of the leaf is felted with white hair. The inflorescence is cymose with a few large flowers with a diameter of up to . These are globular and densely covered with woolly hair. They contain many tubular florets, with long purple tubes and purple stamens, each with a spiny bract covered with white wool through which a spine projects. The flowers are rich in nectar and attract bees, flies, beetles, butterflies and moths. Distribution and habitat Cirsium eriophorum has a Central and Western Europe distribution. Its range extends from Upper Volga and the Balkans to the Netherlands, France and Britain. It typically grows in grassland, scrubland and open woodland on chalk, limestone or alkaline clay soils, including the disturbed ground caused by quarrying. In Britain, it grows up to about and is largely confined to central and southern England. Uses Young leaves of C. eriophorum can be eaten raw, and young stems can be peeled and eaten raw or cooked, first being soaked in water which removes the bitterness. The flower buds can be used in a similar way to artichokes, but being smaller this is a fiddly business; an edible oil can be extracted from the seeds, and the pappus can be used as tinder for lighting fires. The plant is hardy and can be easily grown in a sunny position in the garden, in a wildflower meadow or in dappled shade in a woodland garden. In the United Kingdom, it flowers between July and September.

This image of Texas, obtained by astronauts aboard NASA's Gemini 4 spacecraft shows a large dark swath attributed to rainfall. Texas' weather varies widely, from arid in the west to humid in the east. The huge expanse of Texas encompasses several regions with distinctly different climates: Northern Plains, Trans-Pecos Region, Texas Hill Country, Piney Woods, and South Texas. Generally speaking, the part of Texas that lies to the east of Interstate 35 is subtropical, while the portion that lies to the west of Interstate 35 is arid desert. Texas ranks first in tornado occurrence with an average of 139 per year. Tropical cyclones can affect the state, either from the Gulf of Mexico or from an overland trajectory originating in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Those originating from the Gulf of Mexico are more likely to strike the upper Texas coast than elsewhere.

During the summer, this area of state sees the most clear days. Winter nights commonly see temperatures fall below the freezing mark, or . The wettest months of the year are April and May. Tornadoes, caused by the convergence of westerly and southerly prevailing winds during the late spring, are common, making the region part of Tornado Alley. Poor land management, drought, and high wind speeds can cause large dust storms, minimized in modern times by improved land-management practices, but most troublesome in the 1930s during the Dust Bowl period. The panhandle region, farthest from the Gulf of Mexico, experiences colder winters than the other regions of Texas, where occasional wintertime Arctic blasts can cause temperatures to plunge to well below freezing and bring snowy conditions. International areas with comparable climate: Southern China; North Argentina; New South Wales, Australia. = Trans Pecos Region = The Trans-Pecos region, also known as Big Bend Country, is in the west-central and western parts of the state, consisting of the Chihuahuan Desert and isolated mountain ranges. During fall, winter, and spring, it experiences the most clear days statewide. It is also the driest receiving an average annual rainfall of only or less. Snowfall is rare at lower elevations, although the highest mountain peaks are prone to heavy snowfalls during winter. The arid climate is the main reason for desertification of the land, but overgrazing is slowly widening the land area of that desert. In the mountain areas one can see coniferous forests in a wetter and more temperate environment. The wettest months in this region occur during the summer. Winds are strengthened as they are forced to push through canyons and valleys. In the flatter areas these winds are harvested into usable electricity.

The climate is semi-arid west of Brady through Junction to Rocksprings, but it is sub-humid east and south of that area; both areas have hot summers and mild winters with occasional cold spells. Humidity is high during the warm season, though afternoons especially further northwest can see a wind shift and drier air before Gulf air returns after sunset. The vegetation is both broadleaf evergreen and deciduous in the river valleys, and coniferous where there is greater elevation. Dry savannas, open woodlands, and shorter grasses dominate the northwest, while closed woodlands and moist savannas mix with taller grasses in the east and south. In a single year the region can receive up to of precipitation, and flooding is common near rivers and in low-lying areas, while drier years might receive only of precipitation; average annual precipitation ranges from in western sections up to in southeast. The wettest months of the year are April and May.

It receives the most rainfall; more than annually in the far east. This is due to the gulf currents that carry humid air to the region, where it condenses and precipitates out in the vicinity of sea breeze fronts as well as when extratropical cyclones move by. While coastal sections see the most cloudy days statewide and year-round, northern sections see the most clear days during the summer. The wettest months of the year are April and May. The area is prone to severe thunderstorms and tornadoes when the proper conditions exist, generally in the springtime. Hurricanes also strike the region, the most disastrous of which was the Galveston Hurricane of 1900. More recently Hurricane Rita pummeled the Golden Triangle of southeast Texas. The higher humidity of the region amplifies the feeling of heat during the summer. During winter and spring along the immediate coast, temperatures are kept cool by relatively cool gulf waters. Dense advection fog can form when warm air moves over the cool shelf waters during February and March, stopping ship traffic for days.

Considered to be the southernmost tip of the American Great Plains region, the inland region has rainfall that is similar to that of the Northern Plains. The coastal areas are nearly warm most of the year due to currents of the Gulf of Mexico. Summers are hot and humid. Rain in the coastal region is more abundant than in the inland region, and subtropical forests line the Rio Grande. The wettest months of the year are April and May in western areas, but approaching the Gulf Coast, September becomes the year's wettest month on average. This owes to the threat from tropical weather systems, including hurricanes, which can bring torrential rains of 5-10+ inches in one or two days. The resulting September monthly rainfall maximum prevails, for example, at Corpus Christi, South Padre Island and Brownsville. Inland, where it is drier, ranches dominate the landscape, characterized by thick spiny brush and grasslands. The winters in the inland region are variable, but usually mild. Snow is a rare occurrence due to the lack of humidity in winter, and the summers are for the most part hot and dry, but at times can be humid when winds come off the Gulf of Mexico. Tornadoes can occur in this region, but are less frequent than in other parts of the state. The southernmost part of the state falls just within the tropical climate classification. Occasional years of above average temperatures result in an abundance of tropical flora in the lower Rio Grande Valley, typical of a Tropical savanna climate. International areas with comparable climate: India; Vietnam; Thailand Cold and snow 2004 Christmas Eve Snowstorm in South Texas Northern and western sections of the state average snowfall annually due to their colder average readings each winter. For one week in February 1956, a snow storm of historic proportions struck northern Texas. The maximum amount measured was at Vega with Plainview receiving in one day. El Paso, in Far West Texas, received 22.4 in (57 cm) of snow during a 24-hour period December 13‚Äì14, 1987. For central and southern sections, snowfall is considerably more unusual. In February 1895, a large area of southeastern Texas received over of snow, with peak amounts near at Port Arthur. More recently around Christmas of 2004, up to of snow fell along the middle coast, with the maximum occurring at Victoria. The worst cold snap to occur statewide occurred during the last half of December in 1983. Four stations recorded their longest continuous readings at or below on record. At Austin, the temperature remained at or below freezing for 139 hours. At Abilene, the period at or below freezing totaled 202 hours. Lubbock saw temperatures at or below freezing for 207 hours. The Dallas-Fort Worth airport measured temperatures at or below freezing for a total of 296 consecutive hours. Snow which fell on December 14 and 15 across northern Texas stayed on the ground until New Year's Day of 1984. Severe weather Thunderstorms are very common in Texas, especially the eastern and northern portion. Texas is part of the Tornado Alley section of the country. The state experiences the most tornadoes in the Union, an average of 139 a year. These strike most frequently in North Texas and the Panhandle. Tornadoes in Texas generally occur in April, May, and June. Accessed July 22, 2008 =Hurricanes= Damage from the 1900 Galveston hurricane, the deadliest natural disaster in U.S. history, was extensive. Texas's position at the northwestern end of the Gulf of Mexico makes it vulnerable to hurricanes. Some of the most destructive hurricanes in U.S. history have impacted Texas. A hurricane in 1875 killed approximately 400 people in Indianola, followed by another hurricane in 1886 that destroyed the town, which was at the time the most important port city in the state. This allowed Galveston to take over as the chief port city, but it was subsequently devastated by a hurricane in 1900 that killed approximately 8,000 people (possibly as many as 12,000), making it the deadliest natural disaster in U.S. history. Other devastating Texan hurricanes include the 1915 Galveston Hurricane, Hurricane Carla in 1961, Hurricane Beulah in 1967, Hurricane Alicia in 1983, Hurricane Rita in 2005, and Hurricane Ike in 2008. The climatology of where tropical cyclone strikes are most likely within the state appears to be changing. In the early 1980s, the most favored region during the previous century was the middle coast. However, that region of the coastline has been rarely impacted since the 1960s, and a recent study indicates that the most vulnerable location to a tropical cyclone strike since 1851 is the upper coast, which has received 56 percent of all tropical cyclone landfalls, of which 66 percent originate from the Gulf of Mexico. This is in contrast with Louisiana and the lower Texan coast, where only 39 percent of the landfalls are from tropical cyclones of Gulf of Mexico origin. =Flooding= Annual average precipitation across Texas The most serious threat from tropical cyclones for Texans is from flooding. The worst aspect about tropical cyclones is that the weaker they are, the more efficient they can be at producing heavy rains and catastrophic flooding. Systems with sprawling circulations, such as Hurricane Beulah, also tend to make good rainmakers. Slow moving systems, such as Tropical Storm Amelia (1978) and Hurricane Harvey (2017) can produce significant rainfall. Tropical cyclones from the eastern Pacific and Atlantic Basins can impact the Lone Star State. In general, flooding across Texas is more common during the spring and early autumn months, and it can also be due to nearby stationary fronts interacting with strong upper level cyclones. The most likely location for floods statewide is the Balcones Escarpment, an area of steep elevation gradient in central Texas at the boundary between the Edwards Plateau and the coastal plain. =Extreme temperatures= The highest temperature ever measured in Texas was , recorded on August 12, 1936 in Seymour, during the 1936 North American Heatwave, and again on June 28, 1994 in Monahans. The lowest temperature ever measured in Texas was , recorded on February 8, 1933 in Seminole. El Ni√±o‚ÄìSouthern Oscillation The El Ni√±o‚ÄìSouthern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle is a huge impact on the weather in Texas. During the El Ni√±o phase, the jet stream is located west-to-east across the southern portion of the United States. Therefore, winters in Texas are colder and receive more snowfall than normal. Texas is also less likely to get impacted by hurricanes due to the increased wind shear across the Atlantic. Spring to early summer yields increased rainfall especially where a low pressure system is located over the Four Corners region or northern Mexico which yields monsoon-like climate (which was exacerbated during the 2015 and 2016 spring season where the City of Houston was the hardest hit as if the climate was similar to Mumbai or Kolkata, India with heavy rainfall usually from moisture from the Gulf of Mexico). During the opposite phase, La Ni√±a, the jet stream is much further north, therefore winter is milder and drier than normal. Hurricanes are more likely to impact Texas during La Ni√±a due to decreased wind shear in the Atlantic. Droughts in Texas are much more likely during La Ni√±a. The 2010-11 La Ni√±a is mostly to blame for one of the worst droughts in Texas history.

Ritz (August 1, 1891 ‚Äì July 11, 1976) was a French hotelier and fly fishing specialist. Biography Charles Ritz was the first of two sonsCharles, born 1891, and Ren√© (1896-1918), who chose not to continue in the family hotel business born to Swiss hotelier C√©sar Ritz (born 1850) and Marie- Louise Beck (born 1867, whose family also owned and ran a hotel in Menton). He did not know his itinerant father well, and C√©sar died when Charles was 27 years old. Charles Ritz emigrated to the United States in 1916 where he became a soldier in the US Army. When World War I ended, Ritz returned to the US, and soon spent considerable time mastering the art of fly-fishing in the American West. He married Elisabeth Pierce. Ritz remarried in 1971 and retired from the hotel presidency in 1976, three months before his death. He is buried in P√®re Lachaise Cemetery alongside his first wife. Career Ritz returned to France in the 1930s. His experience with fly fishing made him one of the foremost specialists on the subject. Ernest Hemingway called him, \\"One of the finest fly fisherman I know\\".Ritz, Charles (1972). A Fly Fisher's: Revised and Enlarged Edition. New York, New York: Crown Publishers, Inc.. Ritz wrote a book, A Fly Fisher's Life, which has been read by anglers around the world.Schwiebert, Ernest (1984). Trout. New York, New York: E.P. Dutton. It has been regarded as one of the landmarks of fly fishing literature. He invented the parabolic fly-rod, a term coined by Everett Garrison, a famous bamboo fly rod maker. Fly rods of this type were commercially produced by Paul H. Young, Abu Garcia, Pezon et Michel, Jim Payne and Paul H. Young among others. He was a publicist for the High speed - high line style of fly casting (HSHL). He founded the \\"Fario Club\\", which was the most select fishing club in the world during the later part of the twentieth century. Charles Ritz spent several years assisting his mother managing the Ritz Hotel, and assumed presidency of the empire in 1953, when his mother Marie-Louise retired. Marie- Louise returned to her husband's village (Niederwald) during the summer and set up the Ritz Foundation specifically for Niederwald's youth. The foundation pays for scholarships and apprenticeship programs. Marie-Louis passed away in 1961. He attempted to introduce his progressive ideas when he opened le bar Vend√¥me and the l'Espadon restaurant but found himself hampered by the board of directors. His father died in 1918.

He was one of the first composers in writing polyphony to distinguish between passages for solo and multiple voices on each part.Wright, Grove online Life and music Nothing is known about his early life, but his real name (Lemacherier) suggests a French origin. His first appearance in church records is in 1405, when he was a singer at Bourges. In 1407 he became a chaplain there, and he remained in Bourges until 1410. The next eight years contain no record of his activities, but he was in Rome by October 1418, at which time he entered the papal chapel as a singer, at that time under Pope Martin V; he stayed there until 1421. While no musical activity of his has been documented in France, he had been given benefices there, in the diocese of Rouen. Since he kept at least one until 1449 he is presumed to have still been alive then. Legrant's music is collected in Volume 11 of the Corpus mensurabilis musicae. Seven pieces survive, of which three are sacred, and the rest secular. The sacred music includes two settings of the Credo of the Mass, and one setting of the Gloria; these are the pieces in which he makes a distinction between solo and full chorus in the polyphonic parts. All of his surviving secular works are in the form of the virelai, one of the formes fixes. Most of the composers of the period wrote in another of formes fixes, the rondeau, but Legrant seems to have preferred the virelai, which had been set widely the century before. By 1420 few composers are known to have been writing virelais, suggesting that Legrant's compositions may predate 1420 (the virelai was to return to favor later in the 15th century, in the music of Antoine Busnois and Johannes Ockeghem).Wilkins, Grove online Works Virelais (all for three voices) *Pour l'amour de mon bel amy *Ma chiere mestresse et amye *Or avant, gentilz fillettes *La doulce flour (rendered in CMM as an instrumental piece) Mass movements (all for three voices) *Gloria *Credo (I) *Credo (II) References * Craig Wright: \\"Guillaume Legrant\\", Grove Music Online, ed.

The Polish‚ÄìLithuanian force was more than 12,000 strong and consisted mostly of cavalry, while the Swedes numbered around 7,000 artillery, infantry and cavalry. The Swedes achieved a tactical victory in that they escaped destruction by the Poles, who were unable to get to the Swedish army entrenched behind the Welnianka River, and various ditches and swamps. Swedish army lost 428 dead, while the Polish army sustained 70 dead and wounded, 2,000 dead or 3,000 dead (depending on sources), including 40 companions dead (both hetman Czarniecki and Polish hussar companion Kochowski (who was fighting in this battle) quote this number of Polish losses).  Background  In the spring of 1656, Hetmans Stefan Czarniecki and Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski were sent with their forces to Greater Poland, in order to support anti-Swedish insurrection, which had begun there. King Charles X Gustav, who had just managed to escape encirclement in the confluence of the Vistula and the San river, decided to head to Greater Poland, with 10,000 soldiers. Charles Gustav left Warsaw on April 17, 1656, reaching Pako≈õƒá on April 28. There, he split his forces into two groups. The King himself left with 2,000 soldiers towards the besieged Gda≈Ñsk, while the remaining 8,000 under Gustav' brother, Adolph John I, Count Palatine of Kleeburg, continued to chase the Poles. Polish army, which camped along northern bank of the Noteƒá river, concentrated on May 3 in Pila. On the next day, the Poles crossed the Noteƒá near Uj≈õcie, and marched towards Oborniki Wielkopolskie. After bypassing Pozna≈Ñ, the Poles reached Gniezno (May 5), while on the next day, Adolph John with his army arrived at the village of Jablkowo near K≈Çecko, 15 kilometers northeast of Gniezno. When news of Charles Gustav's departure to Royal Prussia reached Polish commandants, they decided to face the Swedes in an open field. The battle Polish army had 12,000 soldiers, mostly cavalry, while Swedes had 7,000 men with strong artillery units. According to the battle plan of Czarniecki, two Polish cavalry regiments (under Mariusz Stanislaw Jaskolski and Jacek Szemberk) were to engage the Swedes on a dike across a swampy stream called Welnianka, near the village of Brzozogaj. The dike was a trap, behind which four experienced Polish regiments awaited the enemy. The plan initially was a success, as after an exchange of fire, the Poles organized a mock retreat towards the dike. Swedish soldiers began to chase them, but the trap failed, when the four awaiting regiments entered the fray too soon. The Swedes retreated to their well-prepared positions, preventing the destruction of their army. Due to strong Swedish fire, the Poles did not attack their camp, and the battle ended after five hours. According to the Swedish description of the battle, the Polish forces were chased out and pursued. The Polish losses in the battle are highly disputed: Stefan Czarniecki, the Polish commander, claimed he had sustained about 70 dead and wounded. John Thurloe, secretary to the council of state in England, wrote about 600 killed in the battle itself, with another 1,400 more killed during the pursuit. German historian Samuel von Pufendorf made a similar estimation of 600 killed on the field, but with as many as 2,500 killed during the pursuit. 21 Polish standards were also lost. The Swedish losses in the battle were about 428 killed, and perhaps twice as many, or more, wounded.  Aftermath  The battle once again confirmed the notion that Polish cavalry was unable to defeat well-positioned Swedish infantry. Czarniecki himself later admitted, that without infantry and artillery, it was impossible to win battles with Swedish forces. After the battle, Polish army marched towards Pleszew and Uniej√≥w, where it camped on May 16. The situation of Swedes deteriorated, as by the end of May, Poles recaptured Leszno, Ko≈õcian and Sieradz.

SAPS is responsible for investigating crime and security throughout the country. The \\"national police force is crucial for the safety of South Africa's citizens\\" and was established in accordance with the provisions of Section 205 of the Constitution of South Africa.  History  = European Colonization (1652-1910) = The mid-seventeenth century marked the beginning of European interest in the Western Cape, in what is currently South Africa. In its earliest stages, the colony was run by the Dutch East India Company. During their occupation, and well into British colonization of the area, there were a variety of policing units throughout the various areas of the vast colony.  Cape of Good Hope  From 1652 until 1840, the primary law enforcement agency in Cape Town was the Fiscal's law enforcement officers who maintained law and order in the area. They worked in conjunction with the Night Watch (1686-1840), which was responsible for the nighttime surveillance of Cape Town. These two units were merged in 1825 into the Police Office, which was later replaced by the Town Police (also known as the Cape Peninsula Urban Police) in 1840.Ordinance 12 of 1825 (Cape of Good Hope)Ordinance 2 of 1840 (Cape of Good Hope) In addition to urban policing, there were other units that were in charge of the rural areas of the Cape. From 1686 until 1848, the Magistrate's Law Enforcement Officers were responsible for policing the rural areas of the Cape; each district had a magistrate, and each magistrate had its own officers. The Rural Police (1848-1913) came to replace the Magistrate's Law Enforcement Officers.Ordinance 25 of 1847 (Cape of Good Hope) Under this agency, each district had its own chief constable and a small force that were commanded by a resident magistrate. In 1855, the Cape Colonial Forces (CCF) were established as the official paramilitary organization of the Cape. They were formed after the British took over the Cape Colony from the Dutch and granted the colony representative government. The organization was made up of a variety of units that patrolled and operated in various areas of the Cape. The organization was made up of the Frontier Armed and Mounted Police, the Burgher Force, and the Volunteer Force. The Burgher and Volunteer forces were district-based militias that could be mobilized in their respective areas; the Volunteer Force was made up of privately organized and financed units that provided services at the government's disposal. The organization operated until 1912, when it was disbanded and replaced by the Union Defence Forces. The Cape of Good Hope also had units policing borders and points of trade. The Frontier Armed and Mounted Police (1855-1878) and the Northern Border Police (1868-1873 and 1879-1884) were forces responsible for maintaining order along the borders of the colony and to protect the colony from neighboring indigenous kingdoms. The Cape Government Railways police were hired by the government to maintain order on the railways. The Dock and Harbour Police (1860-1913) were established with the intent to enforce the law in the Table Bay harbor. = Union of South Africa (1910-1961) = After the establishment of the Union of South Africa, the union inherited the Cape Colonial Forces, but eventually replaced that agency with the Union Defence Forces in 1912 with the passing of the Defence Act (No. 13 of 1912). Because this force was primarily used as a standing army, the Union required the formation of a formal police agency. In 1913, the South African Police (SAP) was created by Proclamation 18 to function as the national police force and law enforcement agency in South Africa. SAP was an amalgamation of the four police forces of the colonies (Cape, Natal, Orange River, Transvaal). It originally only policed urban areas and cities, while the South African Mounted Rifleman (a part of the Union Defence Force) policed the rural areas. After the first World War, SAP took over the role of the Riflemen‚Äîwho were later disbanded‚Äîand had the task of policing the vast territory that made up the union. SAP also had the task of policing South West Africa, which was under the South African government.  Relevant Laws to the Operation of SAP in the Union  * Criminal Procedure and Evidence Act (No. 31): Established that the Union's Criminal Justice system would be modelled on the criminal laws of the English system (accusatory in nature). * Native Land Act 1913: The act aimed to regulate the acquisition of land, stating that natives were not allowed to purchase lands from whites, and vice versa. SAP ensured that certain land transactions were not occurring and followed the law. * Immorality Act of 1927: The act prohibited sexual relations between black and white people. = Apartheid (1948-1994) = With the rise and subsequent election of the conservative National Party in 1948, the new government began passing legislation that allowed for a closer relationship between the police and military. There were moves to militarize the police force and SAP became heavily armed, most notably for its interactions with crowds that were deemed unruly and hostile. Police Act (No. 7) of 1958 outlined the functions of the police. Most importantly, Section 5 (now repealed) of the act read as follows: > \\"The functions of the South African Police shall be inter alia: (a) the > preservation of the internal security of the Republic; (b) the maintenance > of law and order; (c) the investigation of any offence or alleged offence; > and (d) the prevention of crime.\\"\\\\-- Police Act (No. 7), Section 5 This Act broadened the function of the SAP beyond the standard police operations of maintaining law and order, investigating and preventing crimes. The SAP had unprecedented power to combat counterinsurgency and opposition to the Apartheid government. The Police Amendment Act (No. 70) of 1965 introduced search and seizure zones. This empowered police with the ability to search without warrant any person, receptacle, vehicle, aircraft, or premise within one mile of any national border as well as the ability to seize anything found during the search. These zones were gradually expanded in 1979 and 1983; ultimately, the SAP were permitted to conduct a search and seizure within South Africa without restriction. These broad police powers created a very powerful and volatile force in the Apartheid regime. The SAP were taking many liberties in their interactions with the population of South Africa and instances of abuse and human rights violations were abundant. In 1977, the government passed the Indemnity Act (No. 13) to retroactively protect the government and the SAP from civil and criminal litigation due to acts committed between June 16, 1976, and March 16, 1977. The act placed police and government action during this period beyond public and legal scrutiny and prevented victims from seeking criminal or civil claims.  Homeland Law Enforcement  The Black Local Authorities Act of 1982 provided the establishment of local government structures in the Bantustans, similar to those present in white areas; the Apartheid government claimed that this would create a sense of autonomy in black communities and would allow them some local township power. However, the formation of these separate living areas for blacks systematically segregated black people from white communities as well as kept Black Africans from acquiring full citizenship. Included in this act was the creation of Homeland Police. While the police presence in the homelands were legally independent of the SAP, they were still very much an extension of the national organization in action. The SAP presence was mostly focused on a counterinsurgency approach that aimed to diminish the amount of retaliation and revolt in the homelands. In an effort to aid this counterinsurgency, homeland security forces were established by Proclamations R400 and R413. These proclamations stipulated that a local department of justice and security force would be established in the Transkei and they would be under the jurisdiction of SAP, with equipment, training, and modes of operation being decided by SAP forces. In the Transkei, the 543 members (in 1975) were commanded by five white officers, reflecting a redundancy in policing, as the homelands were subject to an overlap of policing and security forces. Very frequently, security forces in the homelands played ‚Äúkingmaker‚Äù and assumed the legislative and governing roles. Homeland police were usually used to support particular regimes; the judiciary was weakened, focusing the police functions in upholding the interests of ruling elites, and not in the law.  Other Relevant Laws to the Operation of SAP during Apartheid  * Group Areas Act, 1950: Racial groups were assigned different residential and business sections in urban areas. People usually had one year to relocate once notified that they were living in the wrong section; once that year was up, their occupation of their homes and land became a criminal act, punishable by a fine and two years' imprisonment. * Prevention of Illegal Squatting Act, 1951: Allowed for the forcible removal of squatting communities, eviction and destruction of homes of squatters by landowners, local authorities and government officials. * Suppression of Communism Act, 1950: Labeled communism as any act that aimed at change‚Äîeconomic, social, political or industrial change‚Äîby promotion of disturbance or disorder or the encouragement of hostilities between Europeans and non-Europeans. * Bantu Authorities Act, 1951: Established different homelands (bantustans) for the various indigenous black South Africans, as well as \\"independent\\" government structures within those homelands. * Pass Laws Act: Pass system used to maintain racial segregation and manage urbanization and allocate migrant labor. It required black people to use passes when moving outside of their homelands or designated areas. * Public Safety Act: The act empowered government to declare states of emergency and increased penalties for protesting against or supporting the repeal of a law, mostly in response to the civil disobedience demonstrated by the ANC. Allowed for a declaration of a state of emergency and whatever laws issued during this period could be made retrospective for four days to cover any emergency action by police. During this state of emergency, the minister of law and order, the commissioner of SAP, a magistrate or commissioned officer could detain any person for reasons of public safety, providing for further detention without trial for any dissent. * Unlawful Organization Act: Made any organization that was anti-apartheid unlawful. Was later replaced by the Internal Security Act. * General Amendment Act: The act allowed SAP officers to detain without a warrant a person that was suspected of a politically motivated crime for up to 90 days without access to a lawyer. Usually, suspects were detained multiple times in succession. It also included the Sobukwe Clause, which allowed for the detaining for up to 12 months of individuals who had already been convicted of a political offense. It further defined political crimes under apartheid, including the receiving of training that could further the objectives of communism or advocate for change in South Africa by violent means and/or foreign intervention‚Äîa capital crime. It was expanded in 1964 which allowed the minister of justice to extend the Sobukwe Clause. It was repealed by the Internal Security Act of 1982‚Äîwhich still gave the government similar powers of detention. * Terrorism Act, 1967: Section 6 of the Act allowed for detention of someone who was suspected of terrorism or being involved in terrorism (defined as anything that might endanger the maintenance of law and order), for a 60-day period that could be renewed, without trial on the authority of a senior police officer. In addition, there was no requirement to notify who was being held under the act, resulting in many disappearances. The Act also implemented the South African Bureau for State Security, a homeland security/secret police organization. * Prohibition of Political Interference Act, 1968: The Act sought to prevent racial groups from collaborating with one another for political purposes. The Liberal Party of South Africa was especially targeted, which was made up of South Africans of different races who were collectively against the racially divisive policies of South Africa‚Äôs apartheid regime. * Aliens Control Act, 1973: Exempted the racial group of Indians from needing to obtain permits to travel between provinces. However, Indians were not allowed to reside in the Orange Free State and parts of Natal. * Indemnity Act (No. 13) 1977: Was an act that absolved and protected the government from any repercussions following the Sharpeville massacre and other violent events. It prevented the courts from hearing criminal charges brought against the government and its employees‚Äîincluding police officers. It protected actions, orders given and information provided that was conducted under ‚Äúgood faith‚Äù to protect public order, essential services, life or property. * Internal Security Act, 1982: Replaced parts of the Suppression of Communism Act, Riotous Assemblies Act, Unlawful Organizations Act, and the Terrorism Act. Gave government broad powers to ban and restrict organizations, publications, people and public gatherings and to detain people without trial. = South African Police Service (1994-present) = The South African Police Service (SAPS) is the current national police force of South Africa, formed after the end of Apartheid and during Transformation in the late 1990s. The SAPS came to replace the Apartheid national police force, the South African Police in 1994. The Constitution of South Africa states that the SAPS' responsibilities are to prevent, combat and investigate crime; maintain and protect the public, their property and the overall security and safety of the Republic; uphold and enforce the law; and maintain. Furthermore, the South African Police Service Act (No. 68) of 1995 states that the SAPS is \\"to provide for the establishment, organisation, regulation and control of the South African Police Service; and to provide for matters in connection therewith.\\" Despite the vision of a new South Africa with a security force that upholds the ideals of serving and protecting the entire public, unlike the previous law enforcement agencies, there have been numerous accounts and accusations of police brutality. = Municipality Police Units (1994-present) = Some municipalities also maintain their own Municipal Police units, which are tasked mainly with traffic policing and the enforcement of municipal bylaws. Municipal Police have fewer powers than the South African Police Service, and do not investigate major crimes.Municipal Policing in South Africa: Development and Challenges , Chapter 3 Municipal Police forces exist in a number of major cities, including Cape Town, Johannesburg and Durban. = Special Units (1994-present) = In addition to general policing units, some municipalities maintain their own specialized units that focus on particular issues. The Anti-Land Invasion Unit was established in 2009 by the City of Cape Town to prevent the illegal occupation of land and the erection of \\"unauthorized\\" dwellings throughout the city. It was reported that the unit demolished over 300 shacks in the past year. See also *Law of South Africa *South African Police Service *List of law enforcement agencies in South Africa.

It is commanded by Deputy Inspector-General (DIG) who reports to the Inspector-General of the National Police Service, fields about 65,000 officers. The General Service Unit (GSU) is a paramilitary wing of KPS and has around 10,000 personnel. This regular police service is backed up in rural areas by the Kenya Police Reserve (KPR). Administration Police Service The Administration Police (AP) 25,000 strong, report to the Deputy Inspector General- APS. The AP started out as the native police who reported to the local village headman. In 1929 this was formalised by the Tribal Police Ordinance which also provided for their training under the oversight of the regional agents. Today the Administration Police is tasked with protective and border security as well as combating cattle theft and containing banditry.  Directorate of Criminal Investigations Directorate of Criminal Investigation is a semi autonomous directorate of the National Police Service responsible for investigating complex cases. It is commonly referred to by the initials CID. It is headed by a Director who reports to the Inspector General of Police. Due to the sensitivity of the position, the Director of the CID is appointed by the President of Kenya. The current Director is George Maingi Kinoti who was appointed by President Uhuru Kenyatta on 5 January 2018 to replace Ndegwa Muhoro. Before his appointment he was previously the National Police Spokesman based in the office of the Inspector General of Police. The CID headquarters are located on Kiambu Road, Nairobi. General Service Unit The General Service Unit (GSU) initially known as the Kenya Police Emergency Company, was established by the colonial government to battle Mau Mau freedom fighters (rebels) during the fight for Kenya's independence. It now has around 11,000 paramilitary of which 2,000 are trained by Israelis (Recce group) that forms most of the Presidential guard, VVIP and Diplomatic protection. Departmental Agencies Inspectorate Vehicle Machakos County Kenya Wildlife Service Kenya Wildlife Service is a state corporation with a paramilitary wing is responsible with wildlife conservation and general protection. It consists of the trap unit, air wing unit, anti-poaching unit, scout unit, wildlife intelligence unit, wildlife protection unit and of late dog unit. It is headed by the Director of the Kenya Wildlife Service. During Richard Leakey's tenure as director in the early 1990s poaching was almost eliminated, but gradually enforcement relaxed and poaching again became a problem with significant killings of endangered species beginning about 2001, especially affected were the black rhinos. The Kenya Forest Service Kenya Forest Service (KFS) employs rangers to protect the forests and enforce revenue measures. Among their duties the rangers enforce the eviction of squatters from the forests. National Youth Service (NYS) Finally, the National Youth Service, which is administered by the Office of the President, provides some paramilitary training to young job trainees and numbers about 15,000. Kenya Prisons Service Kenya Prisons Service (KPS) is a department within the Ministry of Interior and Coordination of National Government. As a uniformed and disciplined entity, KPS is established under the Prisons Act Cap 90 and Borstal Institutions Act Cap 92 Laws of Kenya. KPS is headed by the Commissioner General of Prisons (CGP). Kenya Prisons Service contributes to public safety and security by ensuring there is safe custody of all persons who are lawfully committed to prison facilities, as well as facilitating the rehabilitation of custodial sentenced offenders for community reintegration. The current prisoners‚Äô population stands at 54,000 of whom 48% are pre-trial detainees whilst the remaining ones are sentenced prisoners. The staff establishment stands at approximately 22,000, consisting of uniformed officers. National Intelligence Service National Intelligence Service (Kenya) (NIS) was previously known as the National Security Intelligence Service (NSIS) http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/?articleID=2000059031&pageNo;=3 which had its origins in \\"Special Branch\\" a department of the national police that was created in 1952 under the British administration. Among other things it provided intelligence during the Mau Mau Uprising. In 1963 with independence approaching Special Branch was made independent from the police and in 1969 it was given a new charter. It wasn't until 1986 that it was transformed into the Directorate of Security Intelligence (DSI). In 1998, a new act of Parliament in Kenya established the National Security Intelligence Service (NSIS) to replace the former Directorate of Security Intelligence which at the time was still colloquially known as \\"Special Branch\\". The first director general (DG) of the new service was retired Brigadier Wilson A.C. Boinett who served until 2006, when he was replaced with Major-General Michael Gichangi. In January 2011 Gichangi was appointed to a second five-year term. NSIS's intelligence gathering work includes: internal, external and strategic intelligence. The NSIS is charged with identifying conditions that threaten Kenya's political, economic and social stability. It develops techniques and strategies to neutralise such threats. The NSIS director is the national security advisor to the president of Kenya. The NSIS was relocated from the notorious offices of Special Branch at Nyati House to new headquarters on the outskirts of the city, near the Windsor Golf and Country Hotel. In April 1999, the Moi government appointed Mrs Pamela Mboya, the former Permanent representative to the Habitat, to head a Committee that was charged with formulating a scheme of service for NSIS officers. Security of tenure given the director general of NSIS is designed to protect him from such abuse by members of the governing elite. He has the opportunity to say 'no' to any unlawful or sectarian instructions from his bosses without fear of losing his job. NSIS is divided into seven sections: *1. Administration under the director of administration, *2. Information technology under the director of information technology *3. Internal intelligence under the director of internal intelligence *4.

He was the locomotive, carriage and wagon superintendent of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway from 1847 until his resignation in 1870. He died in 1887. Early career Little is known of Craven's parentage and there is also some confusion over his early career, but all sources agree that he was born 11 September 1813 at Hunslet a suburb of Leeds. According to John Marshall, Craven began an apprenticeship with Robert Stephenson and Company of Newcastle, later transferring to Fenton, Murray and Jackson of Leeds at the age of fourteen. Bradley states that he began his apprenticeship Fenton Murray and Jackson. He appears to have left Fenton, Murray and Jackson in 1837, and worked briefly for Carrett, Marshall and Company of the Sun Foundry, followed by a year working for Maudslay and Company of Westminster.Bradley (1969), p.8 and Marshall (1978), p.59. He then returned to Leeds to become works manager either for Todd, Kitson & Laird followed by Shepherd and ToddMarshall (1978), p.59. or else Shepherd and Todd.Bradley (1969), p.8. He spent three years at Leeds working with David Joy and John Gray, before he was appointed Locomotive Foreman of the Manchester and Leeds Railway. In 1845 he became Locomotive Engineer for the Eastern Counties Railway at Stratford Works but little is known of his work there. In December 1847 he took up his principal post as Locomotive, Carriage and Wagon Superintendent of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway following the dismissal of John Gray. Brighton Craven re-organised and greatly enlarged Brighton railway works, and recruited skilled engineers from Leeds thereby enabling locomotives to be built there for the first time. He built useful and reliable locomotives but believed that standardisation of locomotive design held back progress.Bradley (1969), p.9. Instead he followed a policy of producing classes of one or two locomotives designed for specific duties. This proved to be expensive and eventually created a chaotic maintenance situation on the railway. By the time he left office there were seventy-two different designs of locomotive in use. When the directors pressed him to reduce the number of new classes in 1869, Craven offered his resignation. This was accepted by the directors and he was succeeded by William Stroudley. Following his resignation Craven was frequently employed as a consultant on engineering projects. He was also active in local politics. He died at Brighton in 1887. Four carriages of Craven's design survive, Nosd. 35, 94, 221 and 204 all on the Bluebell Railway awaiting restoration. See also * List of Craven locomotives.

He was the son of surgeon Heinrich Adolf von Bardeleben (1819‚Äì1895). He received his education at the Universities of Greifswald, Heidelberg, Berlin and Leipzig. In 1874 he became a Privatdozent at the University of Jena, where he later served as an associate professor (from 1878) and full professor (from 1898). Bardeleben specialized in the fields of topographic and comparative anatomy. In 1886 Bardeleben was founder of the Anatomischer Anzeiger (Annals of Anatomy), a journal that is considered to be one of the better publications on anatomical morphology. The journal contains many original treatises on topographic and clinical anatomy, embryology, cell and tissue research, as well as microscopic and \\"submicroscopic\\" biology. In 1892 he published the collected anatomical writings of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, titled \\"Goethe als Anatom\\".

Career Eves was educated at Wolverhampton Grammar School from 1968 to 1975 when he represented England as a Schoolboy International before joining Wolves. He eventually made his debut on 26 November 1977 against Ipswich Town at Molineux in the First Division. His first goal was at Chelsea in 1978, followed by the winner against Manchester United in the following game and a goal in victory over Aston Villa afterwards. Such a run saw him earn a spot in the England B's summer tour of 1978, managed by Sir Bobby Robson, where he made three appearances and scored one goal (in a record 8-0 success over Singapore's full team). Eves played in Wolves' 1980 League Cup final triumph over then-European Cup holders Nottingham Forest at Wembley. He was top goalscorer in 1981/82 (seven goals) as Wolves slumped out of the top flight, but his 18 league goal haul the following year, not only earned him the top goalscorer award again, but saw the team immediately return to Division One. Mel Eves played in a total of 214 games for Wolves scoring 53 goals in all competitions. He is the last Wolves player to score in a European competition for Wolves, scoring the winner against PSV in the second leg 1-0 victory in the UEFA Cup tie at Molineux in 1980 (Wolves went out of the competition having lost the first leg 3-1 in Eindhoven) Financial problems then struck Wolves and saw many players, including Eves, leave after relegation. After a period of time training at Manchester City, recovering from a ruptured Achilles tendon sustained in his last game for Wolves in May 1984, Eves was signed by Sheffield United in December 1984. Here, he played until May 1986 and was also voted 'Player of the Year' by fans. Eves then moved to Gillingham and played two further seasons in the third tier. He retired through injury in May 1989 after a six- month spell at Walsall, aged 32. Upon leaving the game, Eves became an independent financial advisor (IFA), often dealing with advising young footballers. He became a licensed FA agent in the mid-1990s and became more involved with the agency work, although also running an IFA business. In the 2000s, though, he has focused more on his agency commitments, representing players such as Enzo Maresca, Benito Carbone, Fabrizio Ravanelli, Robert Earnshaw and Gareth McAuley. Eves also had a short stint as manager of part- time non-league Willenhall Town from March 2006 until November 2007 when he resigned through work commitments. He won the Birmingham Senior Cup for the first time in the 125-year history of the competition and reached the play-off final in the 2006-07 season eventually losing out in extra time to Bromsgrove Rovers. Mel Eves now works as a football pundit on the radio and in newspapers. He contributes his thoughts on the BBC Radio WM radio commentaries for Wolves games.

He also served as US Attorney for Kentucky and, prior to that, as Kentucky Secretary of State and Attorney General, the first to be elected to the latter office statewide. Early life, education and career Born in Mercer County, Kentucky, Harlan descended from George Harlan (1651‚Äì1714) of County Durham, England and Elizabeth Duck (1660‚Äì1712) of County Armagh, Ireland who were married in a Quaker ceremony in 1678 in County Down. Harlan attended school before working as a clerk in a dry goods store from 1817 to 1821. Deciding to embark upon a legal career, he read law under the guidance of a local judge before gaining admission to the bar in 1823. Harlan commenced practice in Harrodsburg, Kentucky, and enjoyed a busy but not especially remunerative legal career. He served as a Commonwealth's Attorney from 1829 until 1835. Political career A follower of Henry Clay, Harlan was soon involved in local and state politics. In 1833, he managed the reelection campaign of Congressman Robert P. Letcher. When Letcher decided not to run for another term, Harlan ran successfully to replace him. Harlan was elected as an Anti-Jacksonian to the Twenty-fourth Congress and reelected as a Whig to the Twenty-fifth Congress (serving March 4, 1835 ‚Äì March 4, 1839). In 1840, Letcher, who had won election as governor of Kentucky, appointed Harlan as Secretary of State of Kentucky, an office he held for the duration of Letcher's term. In 1845, Harlan was elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives, serving three terms until 1851. He was elected Attorney General of Kentucky in 1850, the first man elected statewide as attorney general. He served until 1859 as the state's attorney general (during which time he wrote The Code of Practice in Civil and Criminal Cases). Two years later, Harlan was appointed U.S. Attorney for Kentucky by President Abraham Lincoln, and he served in that capacity until his death in Frankfort on February 18, 1863. Marriage and family James Harlan married Eliza Shannon Davenport (1805‚Äì70) on December 23, 1822. The couple had six sons and three daughters. One of their sons, John Marshall Harlan (1833‚Äì1911), followed his father into the law, becoming an attorney and a judge. Ultimately he was appointed as a justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, where he dissented in the important Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) civil rights case, standing up for equal rights under the law. He was also a great-grandfather of another Supreme Court justice, John Marshall Harlan II (1899‚Äì1971). In addition, Harlan may have had a relationship with a mulatto slave and a son by her, Robert James Harlan, born in 1816. He raised the mixed-race boy in his household, where Robert was tutored by two older half-brothers. After having a successful businesses in Harrodsburg and Lexington, Robert went to California during the Gold Rush and earned a fortune of $90,000. He returned to the Midwest, settling in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1851 and investing in real estate. He was elected as a state legislator in 1886.Deborah McNally, \\"Col.

Minuteman III guidance ring on display at the National Air and Space Museum. The D37D Minuteman III flight computer was initially supplied with the LGM-30G missile, as part of the NS-20 navigation system. The NS-20 D37D flight computer is a miniaturized general purpose (serial transmission) digital computer. The new NS-50 missile guidance computer (MGC) is built around a 16-bit high-speed microprocessor chip set. They are both designed to solve real-time positional error problems under the adverse conditions encountered in airborne weapon systems. They accept and process data and generate steering signals with sufficient accuracy and speed to meet the requirements of the inertial guidance and flight control systems of the Minuteman ICBMs. Computer operation is controlled by an internally stored program which is loaded from a magnetic tape cartridge at the launch facility (LF). Both the D37D computer and the MGC are designed and programmed to control the Minuteman III missile throughout the powered portion of flight. After thrust termination they also control the PBV for the reentry vehicle (RV) deployment phase. In addition, they control the alignment of the inertial platform and test/monitor the guidance & control (G&C;) system and other components to determine continued readiness while missiles are in alert status. The D37D computer began to be replaced by the MGC in 2000 as part of the Guidance Replacement Program (GRP), with fielding planned through 2008. The MGC incorporates the amplifier assembly functions. When a launch is commanded, a complete retesting of the G&C; system is made prior to entering the flight program. During flight, the computer uses missile attitude, change of attitude rate, and velocity signal inputs to solve a series of guidance, steering, and control equations. It also generates missile steering commands and controls staging and thrust termination. Finally, the computer determines whether or not to provide pre-arm signals to the warhead. The pre-arm decision is based on flight safety checks made during powered flight. Missile Guidance Set (MGS) Autonetics D37D digital computer, part of the NS20 Navigation System. The Autonetics Division of Rockwell International produced all three generations of the Minuteman Missile Guidance Set (MGS). The MGS includes the Gyro Stabilized Platform (GSP), Digital Control Unit (DCU), Missile Guidance Set Control (MGSC) and the Amplifier Assembly. The MGS is an inertial guidance system which directs the flight of the missiles. The guidance system operates while the missile is in alert status, thus enabling the missile to be launched in less than one minute. Once the missile is launched, the guidance system cannot be changed or affected from the ground, a feature which prevents enemy interference with the planned trajectory of the missile. During first-stage flight, the computer in the guidance and control (G&C;) section sends commands to the nozzle control unit (NCU) to keep the missile on the precise course required for the reentry vehicles (RVs) to reach their designated targets. At the proper instant, the computer sends commands which separate an almost exhausted motor from the missile, and ignites the next-stage motor. The G&C; section then sends steering commands to the thrust vector control (TVC) unit of each succeeding motor stage to keep the rocket on course. The incorporation of current- technology electronics with each generation of the guidance system has resulted in a smaller, more capable, and less vulnerable system.

The term 'Bulling' is a reference to any form of cleaning, shining, polishing or such that has no other practical application other than to present an image of exemplary turn out or cleanliness. The term 'Bulling' is an acknowledgment that this is an undertaking intended to 'Bullshit' the inspector of a cleaned item in regard to its normal state of presentation. It is commonly used in the military as a traditional method of presenting leather accessories (such as a Sam Browne belt) and boots for inspection. The finished effect should leave the surface of the leather highly reflective, similar to a patent leather finish. It is not unusual for soldiers to maintain a separate and unique pair of boots intended only for use for inspection or very special ceremonial occasions. Ultimately, the process involves polishing the applied thin layers of polish, not the leather itself. The process can be lengthy and is best learned and perfected with practice. Soldiers are highly competitive in producing the smoothest, shiniest and most durable finish possible normally to their 'Drill' or 'Parade' boots. The down side to this method is that the slightest touch to the laminated layers of brittle dry polish could end up with them cracking or even shattering like glass or even the leather breaking up as the nourishment supplied by the oils in the polish never actually reach the leather.  Method  There is great debate as to the best method for bull polishing, to a point where a lore may be said to exist. Among techniques advocated are melting the polish, the addition of cigar ash to the polish, and substituting coffee or aftershave for water or spit. However, the basic principles remain the same: * Wear the item a few times to establish any natural creases that occur during use. This is particularly important if the leather has been \\"burnt down\\" with beeswax (a process that gives the leather a smoother finish). * Polish the item in the normal way with a brush a few times to get a decent, regular polish. This is best achieved by applying a liberal amount of polish with one brush and using another brush to spread and smooth out the polish, as well as getting rid of any excess. * Apply thin layers of polish to the item in small circular motions with a cloth (e.g. a yellow duster) until a dull, smooth shine appears. * Polish the final layer of polish with the damp cloth or cotton wool until the desired shine appears. * Use small amounts of water, keeping the shoe rag damp. * Do not use too much polish. Using too much polish will cause it to take a long time to polish and not give a very good shine.

The greenfield station was developed by Odakyu Railway in 1974 as a purpose built station to hold trains for expresses to overtake local trains, and as a temporary holding spot for large numbers of passengers as the closer stations and rails towards central Tokyo were a chokepoint and had land acquisition issues and protracted legal filings with residents for decades, particularly in Setagaya ward. There was no room for six parallel platforms closer to Tokyo. Due to these lawsuits, the congested Odaky≈´ Odawara Line was even unable to acquire land by year 2000 for quad tracking on the Odawara line north of the station (in/out of Tokyo), finally resorting to phased expensive fixes to lack of land such as stacking rails vertically using tunnels and grade separation, finally finished in March 2018. Along with the station, an attached masterplanned community was coordinated by Odakyu to support the railway. The station had been planned to connect to the Yokohama subway and proposed Kawasaki Municipal Subway lines, but those plans have been shelved or postponed, leaving the station as merely an Odakyu junction.

Although it never reached Spain, the order was diverted to China where the aircraft briefly saw service. Later, a new batch destined for Spain ended up in Mexico. Design and development The Bellanca 28-70 air racer built by Giuseppe Mario Bellanca for the 1934 MacRobertson Race was shipped to Great Britain but was unable to participate in the race due to a lack of time to adequately prepare the aircraft. It went back to the US to finish its tests, but was badly damaged in a landing accident. In 1936 the aircraft was rebuilt with a 900 hp P&W; \\"Twin Wasp\\" and redesignated the 28‚Äì90. After being purchased by British long-distance air racer James Mollison, he renamed the aircraft Dorothy after actress friend Dorothy Ward. Mollison used the Bellanca 28-90 for a new transatlantic speed record on 29‚Äì30 October 1936 and later in the year made an attempt to set a long-distance London-Cape Town record that was aborted. In 1937 Mollison flew to Madrid and sold the aircraft to the Republican government in Spain.Underwood 1975, p. 62. Operational history The Spanish Republican government, in desperate need of modern military aircraft, placed an order for 20 aircraft in 1936 through an \\"arms length\\" deal with Air France.Underwood 1975, p. 62. In order to circumvent US government export restrictions in the Neutrality Acts aimed at stopping exports to combatants in Europe, the Bellanca 28-90s were marked with spurious Air France livery and declared by Bellanca to be mailplanes.Underwood 1975, p. 62. The truth was discovered, however, and export permission was denied. Nevertheless, the Chinese government managed to secure permission to buy the aircraft and they were shipped there instead. Fitted with bomb racks and machine guns mounted in the fuselage at Hangkow, this first batch of machines saw brief service, although seven of them were destroyed on the ground in Japanese raids without having seen combat.Underwood 1975, pp. 62‚Äì63. The remainder were destroyed in testing. Undaunted, the Spanish government tried again, ordering 22 examples as \\"trainers\\" with full payment in advance, with the aircraft this time being exported to a Greek civil reservist flying school.Underwood 1975, p. 67. Once again, however, the truth was found out and export permission denied. They were eventually successfully purchased for export to Mexico, but with their true destination again Spain. However, before the aircraft could be supplied, the Spanish Civil War was over. After languishing for over a year in a warehouse in Veracruz, they were indeed purchased by the Mexican Air Force, with which they served from 1939 to 1940 until grounded due to safety concerns. In 1946, the surviving 19 airframes were acquired by the Charles E. Babb Company and shipped to Glendale, California.Underwood 1975, p. 67.

Wrestlers are promoted and demoted within and between these divisions based on the merit of their win/loss records in official tournaments. For more information see kachi-koshi and make-koshi. Wrestlers are also ranked within each division. The higher a wrestler's rank within a division is, the stronger the general level of opponents he will have to face becomes. According to tradition, each rank is further subdivided into East and West, with East being slightly more prestigious, and ranked slightly higher than its West counterpart. The divisions, ranked in order of hierarchy from highest to lowest, are as follows: Makuuchi Makuuchi dohy≈ç-iri , or , is the top division. It is fixed at 42 wrestlers who are ranked according to their performance in previous tournaments. At the top of the division are the \\"titleholders\\", or \\"champions\\" called the san'yaku comprising yokozuna, ≈çzeki, sekiwake and komusubi. There are typically 8‚Äì12 wrestlers in these ranks with the remainder, called maegashira, ranked in numerical order from 1 downwards. This is the only division that is featured on standard NHK's live coverage of sumo tournaments and is broadcast bilingually. The latter part of the lower divisions is shown on satellite coverage. The name makuuchi literally means \\"inside the curtain\\", a reference to the early period of professional sumo, when the top ranked wrestlers were able to sit in a curtained off area prior to appearing for their bouts. Makuuchi can also refer to the top two divisions makuuchi and j≈´ry≈ç as a whole, as the wrestlers in these divisions are fully salaried professionals as opposed to \\"in training.\\" J≈´ry≈ç J≈´ry≈ç dohy≈ç-iri , is the second highest division, and is fixed at 28 wrestlers. The name literally means \\"ten ry≈ç\\"', which was at one time the income a wrestler ranked in this division could expect to receive. The official name of the second division is actually , meaning \\"tenth placing\\" and can be heard in official announcements and seen in some publications, but within and outside the sumo world it is almost universally known as j≈´ry≈ç. Wrestlers in the j≈´ry≈ç and the makuuchi division above are known as sekitori. J≈´ry≈ç wrestlers, like those in the top makuuchi division, receive a regular monthly salary as well as other perks associated with having become a sekitori, or a member of the two upper divisions in sumo. Sumo wrestlers ranked in the divisions below j≈´ry≈ç are considered to be in training and receive a small allowance instead of a salary. J≈´ry≈ç wrestlers, along with their makuuchi counterparts, are the only professional sumo wrestlers who compete in a full fifteen bouts per official tournament. In the case of injuries with makuuchi wrestlers pulling out, j≈´ry≈ç wrestlers near the top of the division may find themselves in the occasional matchup with a top-division wrestler. Such j≈´ry≈ç-makuuchi matchups are also not uncommon towards the end of a sumo tournament, in order to better establish promotion and relegation of individuals between the two divisions. Once a wrestler is promoted to j≈´ry≈ç, he is considered a professional with significant salary and privileges. As such, promotions to j≈´ry≈ç are announced just a few days after a preceding tournament, whereas other rankings are not announced for several weeks. Makushita Makushita bout is the third highest division. Prior to the creation of the j≈´ry≈ç division, this division was only one below the topmost makuuchi division (meaning inside the curtain). Makushita, literally means \\"below (shita) the curtain (maku).\\" In the current system, there are 120 wrestlers in the division (60 ranked on the East and 60 on the West side of the banzuke). Unlike the sekitori ranks above them, wrestlers compete only seven times during a tournament. It is often considered that holding the rank of makushita is the first step toward becoming a professional (sekitori ranked) sumo wrestler. Furthermore, it can be regarded as the most heavily contested division, with younger sumo wrestlers on their way up competing with those older sumo wrestlers who have dropped from j≈´ry≈ç and are determined to regain the higher rank. A key incentive is the difference between being ranked in the topmost makushita slot versus the lowest j≈´ry≈ç rank, which has been likened to being that between heaven and hell: A wrestler ranked at makushita or lower is expected to carry out chores for the stable and any sekitori within it, whereas the j≈´ry≈ç wrestler will be served upon. Similarly, the j≈´ry≈ç wrestler receives a comfortable monthly salary, whereas a wrestler below makushita still only receives a small living allowance. Winning all seven matches in a tournament grants an unconditional advance to the j≈´ry≈ç division if one is ranked within the top thirty wrestlers of the division. For any other member of the division a 7‚Äì0 record will guarantee promotion to within the top thirty members, so two successive 7‚Äì0 records will allow a makushita wrestler to advance to j≈´ry≈ç. Those in the uppermost ranks of the division and thus slated for a possible advancement may have a match with those in j≈´ry≈ç, either as one of the seven matches they are expected to compete in, or occasionally in addition to the matches they have already had. This eighth match is sometimes required as a result of tournament withdrawals due to injury of sekitori, and is usually given to makushita wrestler who have achieved a 3‚Äì4 or worse record in their regular seven bouts. It is ignored if one loses and counted if one wins, making it a true bonus bout for a makushita wrestler. In such a match-up the makushita wrestler will have his hair fashioned into a full oicho-mage as sekitori do but continues to wear his plain cotton mawashi. The term makushita can also be used to refer to all four divisions as a whole that are below j≈´ry≈ç, as these four divisions are considered wrestlers that are still in training. Sandanme Sandanme bout is the fourth highest division. This level represents the first break point in the treatment a wrestler receives as he rises up the ranks. From sandanme he is allowed a better quality of dress, most notably he no longer needs to wear geta on his feet and can wear a form of overcoat over his yukata. However, the wrestlers are still considered to be in training, receiving only an allowance rather than a salary. There is typically a set number of 200 wrestlers in sandanme and as with the other divisions below j≈´ry≈ç, wrestlers only compete in seven bouts, held roughly every other day. Jonidan Jonidan bout is the fifth highest division. Unlike the divisions above it, there is no fixed number of wrestlers in the division although it is usually the largest division in any given tournament, with commonly around 200‚Äì250 wrestlers ranked within it. As a result of the numbers, and the fact that, as with the other lower divisions, the wrestlers fight only seven times during a tournament, a play-off tournament on the last day is normally required to determine the division champion. Wrestlers in this division are forbidden from wearing overcoats over their thin cotton yukata, even in winter, and must wear geta on their feet. They often also pick up many of the more mundane chores within the training stable in which they live. Jonokuchi Jonokuchi bout is the lowest division. All wrestlers, apart from those who have had successful amateur careers and are given special dispensation to enter makushita or sandanme directly, start in this division. In addition to the new wrestlers the division tends to consist of other recent recruits to sumo wrestling as well as some older wrestlers who have fallen to the bottom of the ranks due to prolonged injury. A new wrestler's initial position in the jonokuchi division is determined by his performance in maezum≈ç, a tournament held among new wrestlers at the time of the grand tournament before they are ranked for the first time. The jonokuchi division varies in size and typically includes between 40 and 90 wrestlers, with the high mark being reached for each May tournament as the number of recruits appearing in maezum≈ç is generally largest during the preceding March tournament, when the Japanese school year ends. As with the other lower divisions, wrestlers only compete in seven bouts over the course of the tournament. Jonokuchi is the only division in which wrestlers are semi- regularly promoted even with a losing record; promotions to the next highest jonidan division with a losing record are especially common for the May tournament when there is the large influx of new recruits. The word jonokuchi is also used as an expression to describe when something has just begun.

The battle ended in Swedish victory. In the early stages of the Siege of Krakow, Polish royal units of Hetman Lanckoronski decided to abandon the city, as the situation of the defenders was hopeless. Together with king Jan Kazimierz, the Poles headed eastwards, to Tarn√≥w. At some point, the king with the royal court turned southwards, to Nowy Wisnicz and Nowy Sacz, while the army of Lanckoronski joined units under Hetman Potocki. Swedish king Charles Gustav, who commanded the siege of Krakow, decided to chase the Poles, leaving Arvid Wittenberg with 8,000 soldiers in Krakow. Charles Gustav had app. 5,000 soldiers, mostly infantry, while Polish units were more numerous, including the hussars under Stanislaw Koniecpolski. The Poles camped among the hills in the vicinity of the town of Wojnicz, near the Dunajec river. Due to poor visibility, the Swedes sent two cavalry regiments for reconnaissance purposes. The regiments clashed with Polish cavalry, which was sent for the same purpose. The skirmish turned into a full-scale battle, which took place in the Polish camp, among tents. Charles Gustav quickly sent reinforcements, attacking wings of the Polish cavalry. Under pressure of disciplined Swedish musketeers and their firepower, the hussars, who were elite force of the Polish army, had to retreat behind the Dunajec. Stanislaw Lanckoronski narrowly escaped death. The battle, yet another Polish failure resonated profoundly across the Commonwealth. In nearby Tarnow, where the Poles fled, thousands of soldiers switched sides and joined Charles Gustav. Among them were Dymitr Wisniowiecki, Aleksander Koniecpolski and Jan Sobieski, the future king, who hoped that the Swedes would help Poland in the never-ending wars in the east. Swedish units *1.

This novel is Gregory's debut, and the first in the Wideacre trilogy that includes The Favoured Child (1989) and Meridon (1990). Set in the second half of the 18th century, it follows Beatrice Lacey's destructive lifelong attempts to gain control of the Wideacre estate. Plot summary Beatrice Lacey is the daughter of the Squire of Wideacre, an estate situated on the South Downs, centred around Wideacre Hall. Devoted to her father, at the age of five years she falls in love with the estate and decides to stay there forever. At 11, her dreams are shattered when she learns that her absent brother Harry will inherit the estate, and that she be married off and leave. Young Beatrice begins an affair with Ralph, the gamekeeper's son, who lives with his mother, Meg, a village witch, in a cottage on the estate. Harry returns and discovers them entwined, ending the relationship. Threatened by Harry's presence, Beatrice agrees without thinking to a plan Ralph reveals to take the estate for the two of them. She realises too late what it is Ralph has planned, but before she can stop him Ralph murders her father and makes it look like a riding accident. Enraged by the sight of her father's corpse whom she loved so much, she feels guilty, and is afraid that if Ralph were caught he would associate with her. Beatrice decides she cannot allow him to continue living on Wideacre. She lures him over a mantrap and leaves him for dead. To her dismay, she later discovers that he has escaped‚Äîmaimed but alive‚Äîwith his mother's help. Knowing he will someday seek revenge, Beatrice becomes more callous, manipulative and ruthless. Beatrice teaches Harry how to run Wideacre, but soon her position is threatened by Harry's attraction to their neighbour's stepdaughter, Lady Celia Havering. Beatrice handily seduces Harry to gain control of him, and befriends the sweet and innocent Celia. Harry marries Celia with the blessing of Beatrice, who accompanies them on their honeymoon to France. Beatrice discovers she is pregnant with Harry's child, lying to Celia that the child is the product of a rape. Celia decides to pass the child off as her own, sending Harry back to England and later writing to him with the \\"good news\\". Beatrice gives birth to a girl, whom Celia names Julia. Beatrice is disgusted it is not a boy, for he would inherite Wideacre, and withdraws responsibility of the child. Despite a newly assertive Celia taking her place as Harry's wife and Lady of Wideacre, Beatrice secures her hold once again over her brother. At the peak of her power, Beatrice is attracted to the intelligent and provocative young Dr John MacAndrew. Determined to stay on Wideacre, she refuses his marriage proposal; finding herself pregnant again by Harry, she agrees to marry John, who in turn agrees to live at Wideacre. Beatrice gives birth to a boy whom she names Richard, and intends to pass off as John's child. John is away, so Beatrice plans for him to be gone long enough for the baby to look the correct number of months. John comes home too early, and as a doctor he can see immediately that the baby is not premature. Disillusioned, John refuses to believe Beatrice when she says that she was raped but that her love for him is not a lie. He begins to drink to forget her betrayal. Harry seduces Beatrice in the parlor and their mother discovers them. She faints from the shock, and in a catatonic state she mutters over and over \\"I only came to get my book ... Harry, Beatrice, no!\\" Beatrice knows her mother will ultimately reveal her secret, so she manipulates Celia into inadvertently overdosing her mother on the laudanum John has prescribed. John is blamed as it is told he himself prescribed the wrong amount, and what was left of his reputation is destroyed. Beatrice and Harry's mother dies; John realises what Beatrice has done, and also now suspects her perverted relationship with Harry. Before John can come through on his threats to ruin her, Beatrice uses his drinking to have him dragged off to an insane asylum, he screams that she is an incestuous whore and a murderess fall on deaf ears. With John out of the way and his ¬£200,000 fortune under her control, Beatrice coerces Harry to go along with her scheme to marry \\"cousins\\" Julia and Richard to each other legally and make them joint heirs to the Wideacre estate. In need of more money to complete their plan, Beatrice and Harry mortgage the estate and begin to enclose the common land. As this strips the villagers of places to graze their animals and raise their own vegetables, it incites anger and resentment on the estate. Beatrice, intent on her plans, does not care. Realising what is happening, Celia frees John from the asylum, bringing him back to Wideacre and managing to restore his medical reputation. John and Celia do their best to help alleviate the villagers' poverty and deprivation, in contrast to the increasingly corrupt and ruthless Beatrice and Harry. Word comes that \\"The Culler\\", a shadowy outlaw who is against enclosure and the aristocracy, is heading for Wideacre. Knowing that the Culler is her first love Ralph, Beatrice is both afraid and desirous of his vengeance. Harry discovers that Julia is Beatrice's daughter (though not that he is the father of Julia or Richard). Finally recognising the enormity of Beatrice's crimes and destructive nature, Celia calls her out and leaves, with Harry and Julia in tow. John takes Richard and leaves as well, his only remaining desire being to save Celia and the children from the corruptive influence of Beatrice's wickedness. Harry dies of a heart attack en route. Left alone, Beatrice knows that the arriving villagers have to come to burn down the Hall and kill her, but she does not care. She is overjoyed to see Ralph, though the last thing she sees is the knife in his hand. She welcomes her death, understanding that it is justice and her only hope of redemption. Characters Beatrice Lacey: Daughter of the Squire of Wideacre and sister to Harry Lacey. She is considered by the villagers as the true master of Wideacre after her father's death. Unable to retain Wideacre, Beatrice stops at nothing to achieve her goal of staying on the land forever, even going as far as to committing incest and murder. As a teenager, she falls in love with Ralph and remains in love with him, despite her affair with Harry and her marriage to John. With Harry, she gives birth to a daughter, Julia, and a son, Richard. Her affair with Harry is purely out of greed and passion for the land, and her marriage with John deteriorates when he learns about her secrets. Her attempts to gain the land cause it to go bankrupt and ruined. At the end of the novel, she is remorseful of her actions and dies at Ralph's hands, knowing only he can end her sinful legacy. Harry Lacey: Beatrice's older brother who is the new Squire of Wideacre. He is easily seduced by Beatrice, even though he knows what they're doing is wrong. Unlike the headstrong and stubborn Beatrice, Harry is timid and weak. He is also very dense, even though he was sent away to a private school for lessons. He is sexually attracted to Beatrice and has a sexual relationship with her throughout the novel, resulting in the birth of two children, Julia and Richard. He marries Celia, whom he grows to love and respect, and raises Julia without knowing she (and Richard) are his imbred offspring with Beatrice. He has a weak heart, which he dies from at the end. Ralph Megson: The gamekeeper's son who falls in love with Beatrice. Together they plot to seize Wideacre for themselves. Their plan does not come into fruition, however, because Beatrice turns on Ralph and attempts to murder him. He later returns as 'The Culler' who revolts against the Quality. He kills Beatrice at the end of Wideacre, but stays by the land to help watch over Julia and Richard in The Favoured Child. He kills Richard at the end of The Favoured Child. Dr. John MacAndrew: A bright and quick witted doctor from Edinburgh, Scotland who falls in love with and marries Beatrice. They become estranged after he discovers the truth about Beatrice and Harry's incestuous relationship, as well as Beatrice's murderous attempts to give the land to her children. To get revenge against her and save the children, he later starts plotting their downfall. He eventually falls in love with Celia, though they do not have an affair. At the end of the novel, they leave the house together. He travels to India to earn more money for the family and comes back to raise the children with Celia in The Favoured Child. He is murdered by Richard. Celia Lacey: Harry's wife, who later becomes the moral force for good against Beatrice's manipulative schemes. Her marriage to Harry is arranged, but she grows to love him for his gentleness. She is thrilled to accept Julia as her own daughter, as it is later discovered that she is unable to have children. When she becomes estranged from Harry, she falls in love with John, with whom she leaves and raises the children until they are murdered by Richard in The Favoured Child. Julia Lacey: Daughter of Beatrice and Harry. She is passed off as Celia's daughter and later raised by her and John. Although less timid and na√Øve as Harry, her sheltered upbringing causes her to have less confidence and accept Richard's abuse. While she describes Richard as her childhood friend, bully, and betrothed, she has no feelings for him and attempts to escape from him by marrying the first man she falls in love with. However, Richard rapes and impregnates her to stop the engagement, and then forces her to marry him. She gives birth to a girl, whom she names Sarah, before she dies from a fever during afterbirth complications. Richard MacAndrew: Son of Beatrice and Harry. He is passed off as John's son by Beatrice and later raised by John and Celia. As deceptive and sociopathic as his mother, Richard is determined to fulfill Beatrice's wish of claiming Wideacre by marrying Julia. When his position is threatened by Julia and others, he murders those who stand in his way, and rapes Julia, resulting in a pregnancy and birth of a daughter, Sarah. The night of his child's birth, Richard is murdered by Ralph. Sarah Lacey (AKA Meridon): Daughter of Julia and Richard, and granddaughter of Beatrice and Harry. After the deaths of her parents, she is given to and raised by gypsies and renamed Meridon to hide her true identity. However, as she enters womanhood, she discovers that she comes from the Lacey family and is offered to inherit Wideacre if she leaves her previous family and life behind. However, she cannot reconcile the two worlds and leaves her husband and Wideacre. She never learns that her parents and grandparents were brothers and sisters. Sequels In The Favoured Child (1989), John and Celia reunite and raise young Richard and Julia, but Richard inherits his mother's destructive desire to claim Wideacre. Meridon (1990) follows young Sarah Lacey, renamed Meridon and raised by gypsies, as she discovers her past as the daughter of Richard and Julia.

At the 2016 census, Bethanga had a population of 471 and gives its name to the Bethanga Bridge. Mining History =Mining prior to 1876 = Prior to 1876 gold mining in the Bethanga district occurred to the north of the town and were known as the 'Talgarno diggings'. Reports of alluvial gold date back to 1852. Early gold fields were worked at Ruby Creek, Gold Creek and Jarvis Creek. The opening of the Bethanga goldfields began with the discovery of a gold-bearing quartz reef on New Years Day 1876. The 'Gift' mine site is located south east of Kurrajong Gap lookout to the west of Bethanga township. =Mining 1876 - 1910= Bethanga was established as a result of the discovery of gold. Gold was first reported in the Bethanga area in 1852, but it was not until 1876 that the discovery of a reef led to the development of the Bethanga goldfields. The Great Eastern Copper Smelting Works was opened in 1878. The post office opened on 22 July 1876, was renamed Granya in 1879 when a new office named Bethanga opened nearby which closed in 1952. The Bethanga Lower office was renamed Bethanga in 1984. Due to the nature of the gold-bearing quartz reef, the gold was difficult to extract and the discovery of copper led to a change in focus. It was not until the early 1890s that an efficient technique for extracting the gold from the ore was discovered, and once again gold became the primary focus, with copper a by-product. Bethanga was removed from the list of goldfields in 1912, however some mining activity has taken place since. Portion of parish of Berringa, Bethanga gold field, county of Benambra / geologically and topographically surveyed by J.P.L Kenny, B. C. E Assistant Field Geologist, 1908. Geology and Natural History = Geology = The Bethanga township is located in the Lachlan orogen. Compression and folding of Ordovician sediments during the Benambram orogeny, resulted in the creation of the gneisses and schists found in the Bethanga area. Bethanga gneisses are found on the hilltops and ridges around the Bethanga area. The sulphides of Iead, copper, iron, zinc, together with gold and silver, have been found associated with the gneissic rocks, both in lodes and disseminated. Auriferous quartz reefs which occur through the gneiss were mined over a period from 1875 to about 1911. = Vegetation = Bethanga township The vegetation surrounding Bethanga is dominated by two vegetation classes, Valley Grassy Forest and Grassy Woodland. The Box Gum vegetation on the hillocks around the Bethanga townships were extensively cleared during the 19th century as part of the mining operations. Today The town is located close to Lake Hume, attracting both retired people and commuters to nearby Albury-Wodonga. = Facilities =  Bethanga Primary School  Bethanga Primary School The Bethanga Primary School was first established in 1876 after a petition was sent to the Education Department of Victoria by the mining community of Bethanga.  Bethanga General Store  Services from the Bethanga general store include take away food, fresh and dry store consumables, household goods, and great company from the locals. Bethanga Soldiers Memorial Hall  Bethanga Soldiers Memorial Hall  The Bethanga Soldiers Memorial Hall is the venue for the ANZAC day remembrance ceremony each year and displays the Bethanga honour role and serviceman record. The hall and supper room is used for functions and meetings.  Churches  Bethanga has two churches. Holy Trinity Anglican Church in Church St, Bethanga and the Catholic Church of St Francis in Bridge Road.  Bethanga Post Office  The Bethanga Post Office provides postal services and PO box rentals and is a Commonwealth Bank agent. Bethanga Courthouse Hotel  Courthouse Hotel  Established in 1878 the Courthouse Hotel serves beer and food and has a shaded beer garden. = Emergency services =  Victorian Police  The Victoria police force have a police station in Bethanga.  Bethanga and District Rural Fire Brigade  The Bethanga Bush Fire Brigade was formed in 1938 and at the formation of the Country Fire Authority (1945) was affiliated as the Bethanga and District Rural Fire Brigade. The Brigade has a satellite station in the nearby Bellbridge township, and is part of the Tallangatta group in district 24 of Hume Region. In 2015, the brigade celebrated the 70th anniversary of affiliation with the Country Fire Authority.  Community Emergency Response Team  The Bethanga Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) consist of ambulance volunteers who function as ‚Äòfirst responders' and provide basic emergency care until the ambulance arrives. = Sport and recreation =  Bethanga Golf Club  Golfers play at the Bethanga and District Golf Club (a seasonal club open only April to September) on Bethanga-Tallangatta Road.  Bethanga Saints Football Club  The Bethanga Saints Football Club, were based at Bethanga from their formation in 1907, with a number of years spent either in recess or part of the merged \\"Bethanga-Granya FC\\". In 2001 the club relocated to Wodonga, Victoria and changed the club name to Wodonga Saints. The relocation aimed to attracted new players and membership in an effort to prevent the club from folding. Commencing in 2013, Wodonga Saints played one home match per season at the Bethanga Recreation Reserve as its annual Back To Bethanga match.  Bethanga Saints Cricket Club  There is a cricket club that currently has an A and B grade team in the Albury - Wodonga Cricket competition.  Bethanga Recreation Reserve  The Bethanga Recreation Reserve is a parcel of crown land which has been zoned for public recreation. Facilities at the reserve include sports oval, tennis courts, netball courts, and horse paddocks. The reserve also has club rooms with and kiosk.

Hume Soccer Club  The Hume soccer club provides an opportunity for young soccer player to meet and train during the Autumn and Winter months.  Bethanga Pony Club  The Bethanga Pony club is a designated Pony Club have monthly training meetings. = Telecommunications =  Mobile phone coverage  Bethanga was nominated in the Federal Government's Mobile Blackspot Program and has been allocated funding to receive a mobile phone tower in the town.  Internet services  Internet services in Bethanga are delivered through the ADSL1 network with some residents using satellite internet services. The township has been nominated to receive the National Broadband Network via a fixed wireless tower. Many residents have objected to the wireless tower and the development is being reviewed by the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal.http://www.bethanga.com.au References External links Category:Towns in Victoria (Australia) Category:Mining towns in Victoria (Australia) ","title":"Bethanga, Victoria"},{"id":"11805166","text":"Carduus crispus, the curly plumeless thistle or welted thistle, is a biennial herb in the daisy family Asteraceae.

These œÉ1 receptors play a key role in the modulation of Ca2+ release and apoptosis. Cutamesine's activation of the œÉ1 receptor is tied to a variety of physiological phenomena in the CNS, including activation of dopamine-releasing neurons and repression of the MAPK/ERK pathway.  Structure  The molecular formula for cutamesine is C23H32N2O2. This particular agonist is a piperazine, meaning that its core functional group is a six-membered heterocycle with two oppositely-placed nitrogen atoms. Two phenalkyl groups act as substituents for the two nitrogen atoms. The phenethyl group has methoxy groups on the 3 and 4 locations of the aromatic ring, while the phenpropyl group has no additional functional groups attached.left  Affinity  = Causes of Affinity = The 3,4-methoxy groups located on the phenethyl group play an important role in œÉ receptor binding affinity, with alterations made to these groups leading to changes in affinity to œÉ1. Replacement side groups that possess the most steric bulk have the lowest binding affinity for the œÉ1 receptor. The nitrogen atoms in the molecule play a central role in its affinity, as removal of these nitrogen atoms results in a lack of affinity to œÉ1. N(b) - the nitrogen in the piperazine attached to the longest substituent - plays a much greater role in binding affinity than N(a). Sigma receptors are defined by the presence of one amine binding site and three hydrophobic binding sites nearby in the ligand- binding region. Thus, the N(b) atom in the central piperazine ring serves to interact with the amine binding site and the two phenethyl groups serve to fill two out of the three hydrophobic pockets. = Binding Trends = Cutamesine exhibits high binding affinity for the œÉ1 receptor, with greatly reduced affinity for the œÉ2 receptor. It acts as a competitive inhibitor for (+)-[3H]pentazocine. Haloperidol and NE-100 antagonize cutamesine-induced cholinergic (acetylcholine) facilitation. Cutamesine likely does not interact directly with cholinergic receptors, as its binding affinity for them is nearly non-existent. It can also bind to vertebral emopamil binding protein (EBP). Although EBP exists at a lower density in the brain than œÉ1 receptors, cutamesine exhibits higher affinity for the former.  Physiological Effects  = Memory and Amnesia = It has been shown that cutamesine has anti- amnesic properties and could be used to reduce the effects of amnesia caused by REM sleep deprivation. Decreases in the memory function of rats caused by the presence of scopolamine has been shown to be mitigated by the introduction of SA 4503. The activation of the MAPK/ERK (mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase) pathway in neurons is repressed by SA 4503, which in turn leads to reduced stress-related cell death. The presence of SA 4503 has a positive impact on the number of active dopaminergic neurons in the frontal cortex, which is linked to improved memory function.184x184px = Depression = œÉ1 receptors are of interest to scientists studying the neurology of depression, as antidepressants (ADs) exhibit high affinity for these receptors and œÉ1 receptor agonists such as SA 4503 have displayed activity similar to that of ADs in non-human trials. The function of dopaminergic systems has been linked to the effectiveness of ADs, and many experiments involving cutamesine have revolved around dopamine. The presence of SA 4503 has been linked to increases in the concentration of dopamine and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (a metabolite of dopamine) in the frontal cortex. Cutamesine may assist with the release of dopamine from presynaptic neurons in the frontal cortex. For rodents, there was a negative correlation between SA 4503 levels and immobility time during a forced swimming test. = Heart = The administration of cutamesine has been shown to mitigate the effects of cardiac hypertrophy. Angiotension II-induced hypertrophy results in lower ATP production and smaller mitochondrial size in cardiomyocytes, and introduction of SA 4503 returns both ATP production and mitochondrial size to baseline. = Hearing = The presence of cutamesine is positively correlated with the presence of hippocampal brain‚Äêderived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Due to the relationship between the presence of BDNF and ciliary neurotrophic factor and the preservation of auditory nerves, it is thought that cutamesine may have a positive effect on the health of the cochlea. Despite the apparent auditory benefits of cutamesine treatment, it does not prevent hearing loss that is a result of aging.

Looney Tunes animated cartoon, directed by Chuck Jones. The short was released on June 11, 1955, and stars Bugs Bunny. It is a spiritual successor to the 1953 cartoon Duck Amuck, in which Daffy Duck was teased by an off-screen animator, revealed at the end to be Bugs Bunny. In Rabbit Rampage, Bugs is similarly teased by another off-screen animator, who is revealed at the end to be Elmer Fudd. The cartoon inspired a 1993 video game for the Super NES, Bugs Bunny Rabbit Rampage, which allows the player to control Bugs, following a similar plot. A few clips from this short were shown in a trailer for the Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 1 DVD set (seen on the Looney Tunes: Back in Action DVD), but was not included as part of that set. The complete short was released on the Volume 6 set of the series as an unrestored \\"bonus\\" cartoon.cartoonbrew.com Plot The short opens to Bugs Bunny's hole being drawn by the animator in the ground; the animator abruptly erases and redraws the hole in the sky. A sleepy Bugs climbs out and falls to the ground. When Bugs realizes who is in charge of the feature, he makes his desire plain to not be a victim of an animator who plans on making him look bad. With that said, Bugs is about to get back into his rabbit hole, but the animator erases it, causing Bugs to jump headfirst into the ground. After Bugs stands up, he restates his desire to not work with the animator, who paints a yellow streak on Bugs' back, implying that Bugs is a coward. Bugs then grabs the brush and breaks it in half. Bugs emphatically states he will report the animator to Warner Bros. and calls the animator \\"a menace to society\\", while the animator draws a picket sign (\\"I won't work\\") in Bugs's left hand. When Bugs sees the sign, he panics, and throws it on the ground, off-screen. Bugs asks if the animator is trying to get him fired, before explaining that he has become a good asset to the studio, which gives the animator time to draw another picket sign (\\"I refuse to live up to my contract\\"). After panicking and throwing away the last sign off-screen, Bugs returns, wiping off the yellow paint with a towel. Afterwards, Bugs grudgingly agrees to work on the picture, but pauses once he sees the animator has drawn a hat on his head, prompting Bugs to throw it on the ground, stating the animator knows he is not supposed to wear a hat. In response, the animator draws a big pink women's hat, and Bugs throws it on the ground too, revealing another hat beneath it, with another hat revealed under that one when Bugs throws it on the ground as well. The cycle continues with various ridiculous hats and wigs until Bugs announces that he gives up, after which he finally gets the endless line of hats off his head and walks away. The animator draws a rotated forest, and finding himself in it, Bugs tries to get in his hole by climbing down a nearby tree. The animator draws an anvil on Bugs' tail, causing Bugs to fall on a street, later rolling into an empty area. Angry, Bugs incoherently yells at the animator, which the animator responds to by erasing Bugs's head. When Bugs realizes this, he taps one foot impatiently and points at the spot where his head existed. The animator then draws a Jack-o'-lantern on Bugs' body. Realizing this, Bugs demands it be corrected, which the animator supplies by simply adding rabbit ears to the existing head, infuriating Bugs even further. The animator erases the pumpkin head and then draws a tiny version of Bugs' head. Bugs does not realize what has happened until he pulls a carrot out of his pocket, stopping short when he sees that something else is wrong and that the carrot is now huge. He then takes notice of his high-pitched voice. He smacks his hand against his face and realizes that his head is now small. He angrily requests that the animator draw his head back in properly, which he does, except he does not apply the ears. Bugs requests the ears, to which the animator puts in human ears. Bugs requests that he has long rabbit ears, to which the animator then draws long, droopy rabbit ears, only to revert them back when Bugs snaps at him to not \\"be so danged literal!\\" Now with his ears back, Bugs walks away again, only to have his tail erased. When Bugs orders that his tail be put back, it is replaced with a horse's tail, and when Bugs states a horse's tail belongs on a horse, the animator erases Bugs's body and redraws him as a horse. Bugs, while standing on two hind legs and eating a carrot, points out to the animator that this misinterpretation will not make his employers happy, seeing that his contract clearly says he is to be drawn as a rabbit, allowing the animator to pretend to comply with what Bugs is telling him by erasing Bugs's horse body and redrawing him as a more abstract, simplified rabbit with big cheeks and feet. Bugs warns the animator that this latest bit of teasing can lead to serious consequences for both of them, which leads the animator to draw him back to normal. When Bugs sardonically asks the animator if he wants to paint him into a grasshopper, the animator takes out a brush and Bugs quickly takes it back. Bugs attempts to make friends with the animator, promising that they could do something popular. While he is doing this, the animator draws two clones of Bugs, prompting Bugs to shove the clones out of the picture. As Bugs states he has finally had enough and he will not leave the spot until the animator gets the boss, the animator paints Bugs on a railroad track with a train coming out of a tunnel behind him. Bugs leans on a rock to avoid the train as it passes by, and he says he still knows one way out and that the animator cannot stop him. He jumps up and pulls down a card with the words \\"The End.\\" The camera pulls back to the animator, who is revealed to be Elmer Fudd, in a cameo appearance, who laughs and states his delight to the audience by saying, \\"Well anyway, I finawwy got even with that scwewy wabbit!\\" Cast * Mel Blanc as Bugs Bunny * Arthur Q. Bryan as Elmer Fudd Legacy A similar plot was also included in the episode \\"Duck's Reflucks\\" of Baby Looney Tunes, in which Bugs was the victim, Daffy was the animator, and it was made on a computer instead of a pencil and paper. It is done once again with Daffy tormenting Bugs in the New Looney Tunes episode \\"One Carroter in Search of an Artist\\", with the technology updated and the pencil and paintbrush replaced by a digital pen. In issue #94 of the Looney Tunes comic, Bugs Bunny gets back at Daffy Duck by making him the victim, in switching various movie roles, from Duck Twacy in Who Killed Daffy Duck,\\" a video game character, and a talk show host, and they always wind up with Daffy starring in Moby Dick (the story's running gag).

Founded in 1996 by Drago»ô \\"Puya\\" GƒÉrdescu and Tudor Si»ôu, they have been widely regarded as pioneers of the gangsta rap subgenre in their native Romania. Mentored by fellow gangsta rap group B.U.G. Mafia, they quickly emerged as one of Romania's most popular rap acts in the late 1990s and early 2000s. In 2003, group member Tudor Si»ôu was sentenced to three years in prison after being arrested by Romanian authorities in a widely publicized drug-trafficking case.

Historically the home to the city's Italian population, Little Italy was the source for much of Omaha's bootlegging during Prohibition, many laborers for the Union Pacific railroad, and the Santa Lucia Procession, which started in 1924 and continues annually.Larsen, L. and Cotrell, B. (1997) The Gate City: A history of Omaha. University of Nebraska Press. p. 161. The community is bounded by Pacific Street on the north, Center Street on the south, South 10th Street on the west and the Missouri River on the east. It is located immediately south of the Burlington Train Station and the Omaha Rail and Commerce Historic District. In June 2008, the City of Omaha has announced plans to revitalize the area because of its proximity to Nebraska's top two tourist attractions, the Old Market District and the Henry Doorly Zoo. The plan calls for 10th Street to be improved with a streetcar line, treelines, parks, fountains and sculpture.Press Release from the Office of the Mayor, City of Omaha (June 2, 2008) City and Neighbors Partner to Preserve and Enhance South Omaha Corridors History Omaha's first Italian enclave developed during the 1890s near the intersection of South 24th Street and Poppleton Street. It was formed by immigrants from southern Italy and migrants from eastern American cities. Two brothers, Joseph and Sebastiano Salerno, are credited with creating Little Italy, located further north near the Union Pacific yards in downtown. When Sebastiano took a job as an agent for a steamship company in 1904, he encouraged friends from Sicily to emigrate. Joseph then secured boarding and jobs for the immigrants, particularly in downtown Omaha's Union Pacific shops.Omaha City Planning Department. (nd) A Comprehensive Program for Historic Preservation in Omaha. p. 51. In 1905, Sicilian immigrants settled along South 6th Street in the hills south of downtown. Additional waves of Sicilians arrived between 1912 and 1913 and following World War I.Federal Writers' Project. (1936) Omaha: A Guide to the City and Environs. American Guide Series. p. 161. South 10th Street was also particularly important to the Italian community. Originally Little Italy had a small commercial area on South 6th Street extending west along Pierce Street, including a grocery store, clothing and shoe stores, and the Bank of Sicily, established by the Salerno brothers in 1908.Omaha City Planning Department. (nd) p. 51 The Immigration Act of 1924 was largely responsible for ending large-scale immigration of Italians to Omaha. During the Prohibition era, much of the Omaha's bootleg liquor was produced in Little Italy. In 1930, Omaha city boss Tom Dennison placed Frank Calamia, a Sicilian living in the neighborhood, in charge of liquor syndicate operations in Omaha's south side. Later, from 1946 to 1951, Calamia controlled the local outlet of a national race wire service, distributed racing results received from the mob-controlled Harmony News Service in Kansas City. According to one expert, Little Italy native Tony Biase was the \\"leading Mafioso in Omaha\\" through the 1970s.Reid, E. (1970) The Grim Reapers. Bantam Books. p. 124.Heinen, R.

Biography  He began his training in Paris with Jacques-Fran√ßois Blondel at l'√âcole des Arts, where he met Giovanni Niccolo Servandoni and formed a lifelong friendship with Charles De Wailly. He won the Prix de Rome for architecture in 1751 and was a pensionnaire at the French Academy in Rome from 1753, where he was soon joined by De Wailly, the following year's winner, who brought with him Pierre-Louis Moreau-Desproux, whose sister Peyre eventually married. Peyre stayed in Rome until early in 1756, during the years when the students at the Academy were creating temporary projects in the new Neoclassical manner. In 1762 he built a villa for Mme Lepr√™tre de Neubourg in the southwest suburbs of Paris near the Gobelins; demolished in 1909, it is known only through the engravings in his Oeuvres d'architecture and two photographs taken in 1900 by Eug√®ne Atget. It was an exercise in a purely Palladian manner, (Eriksen 1974:212, and pl. 48) quite unlike anything else done in France at that time. In 1765 he produced a volume of Oeuvres d'Architecture de Marie-Joseph Peyre,A facsimile of the 1765 edition was published in 1967. which he dedicated, as \\"the fruit of my studies in Italy\\", to the marquis de Marigny, Pompadour's brother, who had been carefully trained for his opposition as Directeur des B√¢timents du Roi, and was attuned to the new classicism in the arts. Peyre interspersed his own work with carefully drawn views and sections of Roman monuments, such as a reconstruction of the tomb of Caecilia Metella, not as it was to be seen in Rome, but as it had originally been constructed.(Getty Library) illustration Peyre included grand designs for an academy and for a cathedral that was quickly identifiable as a \\"purified\\" neoclassical rendering of St. Peter's. Peyre's volume added to the repertory of architectural design that fed Neoclassicism. A mark of its continued usefulness was its reissue in 1795, after his death, with a Supplement, compos√© d'un Discours sur les monuments des anciensNoted in Hanno-Walter Kruft, A History of Architectural Theory: From Vitruvius to the Present 1994, ch. 13, note 154. and its use by the English architect John Soane.David Adhead, \\"'Like a Roman sepulchre': John Soane's design for a Castello d'acqua at Wimpole, Cambridgeshire, and its Italian origins\\", Apollo, (April 2003)(on-line text) Partly on the credibility the publication lent him, Peyre was named architect at Fontainebleau in 1772, jointly with his friend Charles De Wailly. Th√©√¢tre de l'Od√©on, Paris From 1767 he worked with De Wailly on a project for the new Th√©√¢tre-Fran√ßais, the present Th√©√¢tre de l'Od√©on, Paris, which was at the heart of a complicated urbanistic scheme battered by many conflicting interests.The definitive account of the complicated proceedings is Monica Steinhauser and Daniel Rabeau, \\"Le Th√©√¢tre de l'Od√©on de Charles de Wailly et Marie-Joseph Peyre\\" Revue de l'Art 19 (1973) pp 8-49; a summary is in Allan Braham, \\"Charles de Wailly and Early Neo-Classicism\\" The Burlington Magazine 114 No. 835 (October 1972), p 682f. De Wailly and Peyre were commissioned in 1767 to begin designs the project on the orders of Marigny, on the momentum gained by their joint success at the Op√©ra of Versailles. First designs were approved by the kind at the end of 1769, and revised designs the following spring; an arr√™t in council, 26 March 1770, authorising the project's execution in the gardens of the former H√¥tel de Cond√©. Further delays in acquiring additional land for the project, jointly financed by the King and the City of Paris, were partly occasioned by a long absence of Cond√© from 1771. De Wailly returned ti Italy and in his absence Marigny resigned; his successor, the abb√© de Terray, championed a rival project urged by the City of Paris, that was the design, awkwardly enough, of Peyre's brother-in-law and De Wailly's friend from Roman days, Pierre-Louis Moreau-Desproux, now architect to the City of Paris. Thanks to the efforts of Monsieur, the Comte de Provence, brother of the king, the Peyre-De Wailly project was finally confirmed in 1778 with a slight modification to its planned orientation, to bring it into accord with the comte de Provence's residence, the Palais du Luxembourg. Work, on foundations already constructed by Moreau, began in May 1779, paid for by Monsieur, and by 16 February 1782, the players of the Com√©die Fran√ßaise, who had objected to the project from the start, were installed in the new theatre, which was inaugurated by Marie-Antoinette, 9 April 1782, with a performance of Racine's Iphig√©nie. Peyre was the architect of the H√¥tel de Nivernais, rue de Tournon, which was praised by his former master BlondelBlondel, Cours d'architecture I,:110, noted in Robin Middleton, \\"Jacques Fran√ßois Blondel and the 'Cours d'Architecture'\\", The Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians 18.4 (December 1959, pp. 140-148) p 147, and note. Blondel also praised the Od√©on, I:110 and II;270. and the H√¥tel de Luzy, rue F√©rou. His portrait was painted by Marie-Suzanne Roslin, 1771.Illustrated; sold at auction, 25 June 2003 Among his pupils were Charles Percier and Pierre-Fran√ßois-L√©onard Fontaine and Jules de M√©rindol. Peyre's younger brother, Antoine-Joseph Peyre (1739‚Äì1823),Winner of the Prix de Rome, 1762. and his son Antoine-Marie Peyre (1770‚Äì1843) were also architects.Russell Sturgis, A Dictionary of Architecture and Building  Notes   References  * Eriksen, Svend, (Peter K.

A vaginal delivery is the birth of offspring in mammals (babies in humans) through the vagina (also called the \\"birth canal\\"). It is the natural method of birth for all mammals except monotremes, which lay eggs. For humans, the average length of a hospital stay for a normal vaginal delivery is 36‚Äì48 hours. Surgery extends that stay. With an episiotomy (a surgical cut to widen the vaginal canal) to enable vaginal birth, the stay is 48‚Äì60 hours. The length of stay for a Caesarean section (C-section), a common form of nonvaginal birth, is 72‚Äì108 hours.  Types of vaginal delivery  Different types of vaginal deliveries have different terms: * A spontaneous vaginal delivery (SVD) occurs when a pregnant female goes into labor without the use of drugs or techniques to induce labor, and delivers her baby in the normal manner, without forceps, vacuum extraction, or a cesarean section. * An assisted vaginal delivery (AVD) or instrumental vaginal delivery occurs when a pregnant female goes into labor (with or without the use of drugs or techniques to induce labor), and requires the use of special instruments such as forceps or a vacuum extractor to deliver her baby vaginally. * An induced vaginal delivery is a delivery involving labor induction, where drugs or manual techniques are used to initiate the process of labor. Use of the term \\"IVD\\" in this context is less common than for instrumental vaginal delivery. * A normal vaginal delivery (NVD) is a vaginal delivery, whether or not assisted or induced, usually used in statistics or studies to contrast with a delivery by cesarean section. Note: Use of the term IVD for instrumental vaginal delivery is best avoided because of its duplicate meanings.

He was especially associated with performances of the works of Fr√©d√©ric Chopin, though he also played works by Franz Schubert, Robert Schumann, and Franz Liszt. His was among the earliest recordings of Schubert's Sonata in G major, D 894, made for English Columbia around 1928.  Childhood and early studies  Pyshnov, born into an aristocratic Russian family in either Kiev or Odessa, was drawn to the piano as a young child, and, having acquired some aptitude before the age of ten, gave two public concerts. His parents, not wishing him to be exploited, discouraged this, but after his father's death (when Leff was 9), financial constraints led to his accepting concert engagements, and he rapidly gained a reputation. Special arrangements were made for his schooling, where he had a particular interest in chemistry. At the age of 14 he joined the State Opera Company orchestra, but a chance meeting with Feodor Chaliapin persuaded him to pursue his piano studies. Formal study and training He studied at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory under Anna Yesipova (piano), with instruction from Rimsky-Korsakov, Liadov and Glazunov (composition) and Nikolai Tcherepnin (conducting). He was one of the most brilliant students of his time, and emerged in 1910 with a first class diploma, a Gold Medal, and a cash prize equivalent to ¬£120 for a voyage to Europe. In that year he competed for the St Petersburg Rubinstein Prize against Arthur Rubinstein, Alexander Borovsky, Julius Isserlis, Edwin Fischer and Alfred Hoehn (the winner). However, instead of embarking at once on a high-profile recital career, he chose instead to make a musical tour through various European countries, studying their music and meeting their musicians, which greatly broadened his experience. Returning to Russia, he made a recital tour with the distinguished Hungarian violinist Leopold Auer, and followed this with a solo tour giving piano recitals, which resulted in many offers of engagements in the major European centres. His international reputation was growing when World War I interrupted his progress. Owing to short-sightedness, he was exempt from military service but, being confined to Russia, he played in military camps and gave a series of concerts for wounded and convalescent men in hospitals.  Career in the West  He remained in Russia through the Russian Revolution, suffering considerable want, and in 1919 had the opportunity to make a concert tour in Persia (Iran), the first eminent European pianist to do so. After his successful completion of it he returned and soon afterwards escaped across the Russian frontier and made his way to Paris. In 1920 he moved on to London, where he was unknown, but gave his first and highly acclaimed recital at the Wigmore Hall on 2 February 1921, where he was greatly admired by Ernest Newman. From this point he made his home in Britain. His career now burst upon the European scene. He made numerous orchestral appearances in Britain, in London at the Queen's Hall and Royal Albert Hall, with the Hall√© Orchestra in Manchester and with the Scottish Orchestra. His many compositions for orchestra, violin and piano were still in MS in 1924, but his piano pieces were by then being published. He began to make regular visits to the principal cities of France, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands, and was in the United States in the seasons of 1924-5 and 1925-6, when he toured major cities. His career eventually became worldwide. In summer 1926 he devoted a whole week of recitals to playing over seventy of the principal works of Chopin, and repeated this in 1927 to much acclaim. In recordings he is heard around 1930 as an extremely articulate and intelligent accompanist to Frank Titterton in Schubert song repertoire. He was among the earliest pianists to broadcast from Savoy Hill in 1925, and in 1938 he became the first to be broadcast on television, from Alexandra Palace. During World War II he gave concerts to factory workers, miners and dockers, and made extensive tours among the forces in the Middle East. Pyshnov made a substantial number of recordings, especially of Chopin and Liszt. He had a very extensive technique, and a delicacy and sensitivity of nuance without effeminacy which won extremely high praise from some critics. He ended his own life, in London. His widow Dorothy (n√©e Hildreth), a former pupil, died only three weeks after he did.  Sources  *D. Brook, Masters of the Keyboard (Rockliff, London 1946) *A.

The film premiered at Sundance Film Festival and was shown on Cinemax and the Sundance Channel. It is narrated by Martin Sheen and features cameo appearances by activist-priest Daniel Berrigan and political folksinger Pete Seeger. Plot After the house was seized, the couple and their daughter refuse to move out and Kehler is arrested on December 3, 1991, by US Marshals and IRS agents. Community supporters move in, helping them to occupy the house. On February 12, 1992, the still-occupied house‚Äîbut not the land, which belongs to the Valley Community Land Trust‚Äîis sold at auction to Danny Franklin and Terry Charnesky for $5400; the IRS had failed to receive any monetary bids at an earlier auction. The sale results in suits and countersuits between the Franklin-Charnesky family and the Land Trust. Despite the sale of the house, the Kehler-Corner occupiers refuse to leave. However, on April 15, 1992, while Kehler, Corner, and their supporters are away, Franklin, Charnesky, and their supporters move-in and occupy the house. Kehler, Corner, and their supporters begin a lively protest and round-the-clock vigil just outside the house, eventually even building a small wooden structure to shelter the protesters. On May 28, 1993, the Franklin County Superior court issues an injunction against the Kehler-Corner protests and, subsequently, several protesters are arrested and jailed after violating the injunction. Still, the protest continues until September, when they are finally discontinued. The battle over the house is ended on December 31, 1993, when an out-of-court settlement is reached between the Land Trust and the Franklin-Charnesky family, who agree to leave the house and deed it and the land-lease to the land trust in exchange for an undisclosed sum of money.

History = Founding Young D.C.= Launched in 1991, Young D.C. (YDC) has its roots in the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial study Captive Voices: the Report of the Commission of Inquiry into High School Journalism (1974). Vigilance, it said, on the part of educators and established media was essential to ensure young people‚Äôs understanding of their Constitutional rights. Equally important, those educators and members of the media needed to commit to inclusion of minorities in journalism education programs. Commissioner Ann Therese Heintz and RFK fellow Craig Trygstad became leaders of Youth Communication, a youth journalism movement. Joining them was George Curry, the journalist who originated minority student journalism workshops in 1977. Youth Communication grew to a network of ten independent teen-produced newspapers (including Young D.C.) and the 13-bureau Youth News Service. All the newspapers associated with Youth Communication lost financial ground during the recession of the early 1990s. Four did not survive. By the end of the recession, Youth News Service suspended activities. Surviving programs elected to give up the common, national identity. =Death by Cheeseburger= In 1994, The Freedom Forum produced Death by Cheeseburger: High School Journalism in the 1990s and Beyond. It explored best and worst practices in scholastic and independent youth-produced newspapers. The study said, ‚ÄúAround the country, independent youth newspapers are a strong presence, including New Expression in Chicago, Young D.C. in Washington, D.C., VOX in Atlanta and NYC (New Youth Connection) in New York City.‚Äù Because four of YDC teens were research and editorial assistants for this Freedom Forum project, it was a high point for the program and the newspaper. A nadir followed. Trygstad accepted an offer to teach overseas. Economic pressures forced three years of retrenching. Stalwart supporters (The Freedom Forum, the Bureau of National Affairs, National Press Club and the Children‚Äôs Charities Foundation) helped YDC through this first bout with hard times. As widely reported, the aftermath of September 11, 2001, included reduced funding for many nonprofit organizations. The new millennium delivered a new recession, but YDC management knew how to cope. Budgets were balanced. Teen participation was stable. =The Future of the First Amendment= The next big study came in 2005. The Future of the First Amendment: What America‚Äôs High School Students Think about Their Freedoms, a report by the University of Connecticut‚Äôs Public Policy and the Center for Survey Research & Analysis funded by the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation was a two-year, $1 million study that delivered sobering news: * More than a third of student‚Äôs think the First Amendment goes too far; * Forty percent of high schools that do not have student newspapers eliminated them within the past five years; * Nearly three-quarters of all students either don‚Äôt know how they feel about the First Amendment, or take it for granted. This study is cited because Young D.C. has been vigilant as Captive Voices charged. It never abandoned the sound practices described in Death by Cheeseburger. Young D.C. is connected to an optimistic finding in The Future of the First Amendment: youth who care about journalism find a way to practice it. Across the board ‚Äî urban, suburban, rural ‚Äî seven percent of teens found ways to gain experience in journalism when their schools had meager or no opportunities for learning about the free press through hands-on education. In the metropolitan D.C. area few public high schools have a publishing schedule as rigorous as the YDC schedule. Statistically, in the metropolitan area, more than 10,000 teens should be taking advantage of journalism education. Much fewer are doing so. Current events The Al Neuharth Free Spirit Scholarship program selected co-editor of entertainment Asha Johnson and sports editor Hojung Lee as, respectively, D.C. and Maryland Free Spirit Scholars of 2010. Pre-2010, there were two scholars per state and D.C., one boy and one girl.

He represented two federal electorates, more than and 21 years apart. Early life and war service Nott was born at Windermere, a sugar-plantation located near Bundaberg, Queensland. He was the son of Frederick Lewis Nott, a Planter, and Jean Blair. His older brother Frederick Lancelot was later a member of the Legislative Assembly of Queensland. Lewis Nott was educated at Maryborough Grammar School, Queensland. He then studied assaying at the School of Mines and Industries, Ballarat, Victoria before undertaking a medical degree at the University of Sydney. In 1913, he married Doris Ashbury in the Sydney suburb of Woolwich. Ashbury was the granddaughter of John Ingham Aspinall, a member of the well-known Aspinall family. They travelled to Scotland where he continued studying medicine at the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, and the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow. At the outbreak of World War One he enlisted in the Royal Scots and rose captain and made adjutant. In 1916 he was wounded and twice mentioned in dispatches. He resigned his commission and resumed his medical training in December 1916. On graduation in 1918 he joined the Royal Army Medical Corps and in 1919 worked at the Pilkington Special (Orthopaedic) Hospital, St Helens, Lancashire. Medical practitioner and politician Nott returned to Australia and took part in the campaign against hookworm and then was appointed medical superintendent of Mackay District Hospital. From 1924 to 1927 he was mayor of Mackay. In 1925 he won the seat of Herbert, then including Mackay and Townsville, in Federal Parliament for the Nationalist Party. In this contest he unexpectedly defeated the Australian Labor Party candidate Ted Theodore, who had resigned as Premier of Queensland in order to enter federal politics (he had to wait for a by-election in 1927 in a Sydney seat before he was successful). In 1928 Nott lost the seat to the Labor candidate, George Martens. He ran unsuccessfully as a Nationalist in North Sydney (1929) and as a member of the Nationalists' successor, the United Australia Party, in Calare (1934) and East Sydney (1940). Nott moved to Canberra in 1927, the year that it became the national capital. In 1929 he was appointed Medical Superintendent of the Canberra Hospital and held this position until 1934 and from 1941 to 1949. He was also a private practitioner throughout this period. He campaigned for the creation of an advisory council for the Federal Capital Territory (in 1938 renamed the Australian Capital Territory, ACT) and was elected as a member of the council from 1935 to 1949. In 1949, he was elected as an independent as the first representative of the Division of Australian Capital Territory in the Federal Parliament, where he had unlimited speaking rights but could only vote on matters affecting the ACT. His break in parliamentary service of 21 years (1928‚Äì1949) is a record for the Australian parliament. He was one of the few people who have represented more than one state or territory in the Parliament, and the only one to represent both a state and a territory. He was defeated by the Labor candidate Jim Fraser in the 1951 election. He was subsequently appointed as medical officer at the Newborough Clinic, Yallourn, Victoria, but collapsed on the flight to Melbourne and died the next day of leukemia in Royal Melbourne Hospital and is buried in the Presbyterian Section of the Woden Cemetery, Canberra. Family Lewis and Doris Nott had three sons and two daughters. Their first two sons, born overseas, died young, at ages 11 years and 10 years respectively, in Sydney, NSW. They were followed by two daughters born in Queensland. The older daughter moved to Canada where she married. The second daughter, Lyndal, who was an ice skater, died in a laboratory accident on 10 April 1966 in Canberra. Their third son was born in Canberra. One of his grandchildren, Matthew Nott, is a surgeon and environmentalist.

Designing the national flag of Bangladesh As desired by the then NUCLEUS (Shadhin Bangla Biplobi Parishad) by a match stick and yellow colored paint, he marked the map of Bangladesh over the red circle of the proposed flag in the room numbered 108 of the then Iqbal Hall of Dhaka University (DU) from deep mid-night of June 6 up to the dawn of June 7 in 1970. A. S. M.

It is classified as a medullary cystic kidney disease. The disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion and, although rare, is the most common genetic cause of childhood kidney failure. It is a form of ciliopathy. Its incidence has been estimated to be 0.9 cases per million people in the United States, and 1 in 50,000 births in Canada.page 831, Chapter 35, in: (stating the incidence in the United States as 9 per 8.3 million people. Signs and symptoms Infantile, juvenile, and adolescent forms of nephronophthisis have been identified. Although the range of characterizations is broad, people affected by nephronophthisis typically present with polyuria (production of a large volume of urine), polydipsia (excessive liquid intake), and after several months to years, end-stage kidney disease, a condition necessitating either dialysis or a kidney transplant in order to survive. Some individuals that suffer from nephronophthisis also have so-called \\"extra-renal symptoms\\" which can include tapetoretinal degeneration, liver problems, ocularmotor apraxia, and cone-shaped epiphysis (Saldino-Mainzer syndrome).  Cause  Nephronophthisis is characterized by fibrosis and the formation of cysts at the cortico-medullary junction, it is an autosomal recessive disorder which eventually leads to terminal kidney failure.  Pathophysiology  Ciliopathy (eukaryotic cilium diagram) Mechanism of nephronophthisis indicates that all proteins mutated in cystic kidney diseases express themselves in primary cilia. NPHP gene mutations cause defects in signaling resulting in flaws of planar cell polarity. The ciliary theory indicates that multiple organs are involved in NPHP (retinal degeneration, cerebellar hypoplasia, liver fibrosis, and intellectual disability). = Related rare genetic disorders = Nephronophthisis is a ciliopathy. Other known ciliopathies include primary ciliary dyskinesia, Bardet‚ÄìBiedl syndrome, polycystic kidney and liver disease, Alstr√∂m syndrome, Meckel‚ÄìGruber syndrome and some forms of retinal degeneration. NPHP2 is infantile type of nephropthisis and sometimes associated with situs inversus this can be explained by its relation with inversin gene. NPHP1, NPHP3, NPHP4, NPHP5, and NPHP6 are sometimes seen with retinitis pigmentosa, this particular association has a name, Senior-Loken syndrome. Diagnosis Ultrasound The diagnosis of nephronophthisis can be obtained via a kidney ultrasound, family history and clinical history of the affected individual according to Stockman, et al.update 2016 =Types= * Infantile NPH * Juvenile NPH * Adult NPH Management The management of this condition can be done via-improvement of any electrolyte imbalance, as well as, high blood pressure and low red blood cell counts (anemia) treatment as the individual's condition warrants. Epidemiology Nephronophthisis occurs equally in both sexes and has an estimate 9 in about 8 million rate in individuals. Nephronophthisis is the leading monogenic cause of end-stage kidney disease.

Both neighborhoods are historically linked to the once vast U.S. Steel plant of the Duluth Works which was once located outside of Gary and in between Morgan Park.

Abraham Louis Niedermeyer (27 April 180214 March 1861) was a composer chiefly of church music but also of a few operas, and a teacher who took over the √âcole Choron, duly renamed √âcole Niedermeyer, a school for the study and practice of church music, where several eminent French musicians studied including Gabriel Faur√© and Andr√© Messager. Life and career Scene from the 4th act of La Fronde, an opera by Louis Niedermeyer. Born in Nyon, Switzerland, Niedermeyer studied piano in Vienna with Ignaz Moscheles and composition with Emanuel Aloys F√∂rster. He studied further in Rome with Vincenzo Fioravanti (1819) and in Naples with Niccol√≤ Antonio Zingarelli. While in Rome, he had the luck to meet Gioachino Rossini, who befriended him and urged the production of some of Niedermeyer's operas. His first opera, Il reo per amore (\\"Guilty for love\\"), was put on in Naples in 1820 with some success. Like Rossini, Niedermeyer settled in Paris (at the age of 21, in 1823); and there, in later years, four more of his operas were staged, though with little success: La casa nel bosco (\\"The House in the woods\\"' 28 May 1828), Stradella (3 March 1837), Marie Stuart (6 December 1844) and La Fronde (\\"The Fronde\\"' 2 May 1853). Niedermeyer also collaborated with his friend Rossini on the assembly of Robert Bruce (1846), Rossini's third and last pastiche; Niedermeyer \\"provided the all- important French texts with their characteristic tone color and harmonies\\".Records international note on Robert Bruce on Records International.com; accessed 21 July 2012. After these attempts at an operatic career Niedermeyer devoted himself primarily to sacred and secular vocal music. In October 1853, he reorganized and re-opened the school then known as the Ecole Choron (after Alexandre-√âtienne Choron, who had died in 1834). It was renamed the √âcole Niedermeyer. Although it has had further name changes, the school is still open. His church music remained in use in France and elsewhere into the 20th century. Although he was born in Switzerland and studied in Austria and Italy, he is generally described today as a French composer because of his chosen country of residence. He died in Paris.

It became the member of the International Carrom Federation on 15 October 1988 and played a pivotal role in the formation of the International Federation. In 1991, the Government of India included the game of carrom in its list for the purpose of recruitment under sports quota in Government offices/ organizations. The Asian Carrom Confederation became affiliated with the AICF in September 1995. The All-India Carrom Federation and the game of carrom was recognized by the Indian Olympic Association on 26 October 1997. The game of carrom was also recognized by the School Games Federation of India in 1996. The organisation at present has 31 Indian state/UT associations and 15 Institutions as its affiliates. The Working Committee of the Federation is elected for a term of four years. The last elections to the Federation were held in August 2003 at Goa. AICF regularly conducts national championships for sub-junior, junior, and senior (older adult) divisions. It also conducts institutional national championships., the All-India Federation Cup, and various other all-India ranking and prize-money tournaments every year. It has so far conducted 96 national championships for sub-junior, junior and senior players, and has introduced cadet (under 12 years of age) and youth (under 21 years of age) national championships. The Federation has also made bilateral arrangements with various countries for organizing \\"Test Series\\" competitions. India and Sri Lanka are playing Test Series on regular basis.

The Falls League was affiliated to the Dublin-based Football Association of Ireland, which had been formed in 1921 as a breakaway from the Belfast-based Irish Football Association. The Falls Road was a largely Roman Catholic Nationalist area, and some football fans there regarded the IFA as a Unionist-dominated body. Belfast Celtic, the best Catholic-supported club, had withdrawn from the Irish League in 1920, during the instability of the Irish War of Independence, and many of its players turned out for Falls League sides, including Alton United. The high point of Alton United's existence came when they played Shelbourne in the 1923 Irish Free State Cup Final at Dalymount Park. United were heavy underdogs going into the game and bookies had stopped taken bets on Shelbourne to win the game. United surprisingly beat Shelbourne 1-0 with the single goal scored by Andy McSherry. In late 1923, the FAI was admitted to FIFA on condition that it confine its operation to the Irish Free State. Thus, the Falls League was disaffiliated.

The main area of breeding lay between the northern Hotzenwald to the south and the Kinzigtal to the north. Breeding was concentrated round the monasteries of St. Peter and of St. M√§rgen; for this reason it was formerly known as the St. M√§rgener Fuchs. A breed association, the Schwarzw√§lder Pferdezuchtgenossenschaft, was started in Sankt M√§rgen in 1896, and a stud-book was begun in the same year. In 1935, in the Nazi period, it was merged into the general stud-book for Baden. This was restarted after the War, in 1947, under the French administration. The Schwarzw√§lder Pferdezuchtgenossenschaft was re-founded in the 1990s. After the end of the Second World War, there were more than 1200 breeding mares registered. With the mechanisation of agriculture and of transport, demand for working horses fell rapidly, and by 1977 the number of mares had fallen below 160. In 2007 its conservation status was reported by the FAO as \\"endangered\\". In 2017 a population of 88 stallions and 1077 mares was reported; in 2019 the breed was listed by the Gesellschaft zur Erhaltung alter und gef√§hrdeter Haustierrassen in its category III, gef√§hrdet, \\"endangered\\". A number of stallions stand at stud at Marbach Stud, where artificial insemination is also available.  Characteristics  The Black Forest Horse is always chestnut with a flaxen mane and tail; no other color may be registered. The coat varies from pale to very dark, sometimes almost black; this, with a pale or silvery mane, is the coloring called in German , \\"dark fox\\". Intentional selection for flaxen chestnut coloring began in 1875. In a study of 250 horses of the breed published in 2013, two were found to carry silver genes, but because they were chestnut, the silver was not expressed; it was thought to have been introduced by outcrossing to some other breed in the past. The Black Forest Horse is a draft horse of light to medium weight, well muscled and with a short and powerful neck. The head is short and dry, the shoulders sloped, and the croup broad and muscular. The legs are clean, without feathering, and the hooves broad and strong.  Uses  The Black Forest Horse was originally bred for work in agriculture and forestry; it is now used in harness and, more and more often, as a riding horse.

History The state of Qi was founded when the first king of the Shang Dynasty enfeoffed the direct descendants of the royal family of the deposed Xia Dynasty in the area that is now Qi County in Kaifeng, eastern Henan Province. This practice was referred to as ‰∫åÁéã‰∏âÊÅ™. The state of Qi gradually moved eastward to the area of Xintai in Shandong Province until it was finally destroyed by King Hui of Chu. The state of Qi was apparently very small in scale, as it is rarely mentioned in ancient Chinese documents except to say that \\"its affairs are not worth mentioning.\\" Records of the Grand Historian, Vol.36. It is perhaps best known as the inspiration for the popular Chinese idiom, Êùû‰∫∫ÂøßÂ§© (Êùû‰∫∫ÊÜÇÂ§©) (Q«ê r√©n y≈çu tiƒÅn, literally, \\"Qi people lament heaven\\" or \\"the people of Qi worry about the sky\\"), which is said to refer to the fact that the people of Qi often talked anxiously about the sky falling down on their heads. The idiom is used when mocking a person's needless anxiety over an impossible, inconsequential, or inevitable matter. That being said, its ruler also belonged to the highest feudal rank below king‚Äîa duke (ÂÖ¨). It is one of the few duchies actually erected by royal edict, compared to the many that were self-declared. In terms of culture, however, the state of Qi - being descended from the royal house of the Xia Dynasty - held considerable importance, for it followed the ancient rituals of the Xia. Confucius, being interested in ancient rites, visited Qi to see them for himself. However, his verdict sounded not quite approvingly: \\"I could discuss the ritual of the Xia, but the Qi [kingdom] does not sufficiently attest to my words\\" (Analects 3:9).

He married a Sherbro woman and had two sons with her before his early death. The sons also became merchant traders and developed a family dynasty that became prominent among the Sherbro people and British colonists, in the area now known as the Moyamba District, Southern Province, Sierra Leone. As paramount chiefs, they dominated the Bumpe and Kagboro chiefdoms into the 20th century. Descendants live primarily in Bonthe and Shenge of that District. Early life and education Born at Falmouth, Cornwall, Thomas Corker was the younger of two sons of Thomas Corker, a ship's doctor from County Meath, Ireland. His father had settled in Ireland from Manchester, England. Corker married Jane Newman, a local woman of Falmouth. Thomas was baptized on 4 February 1669. His older brother was Robert Corker. They had two younger sisters, Jane and Anne. After their father died young, their maternal uncle John Newman, Jr. acted as guardian. The boys were expected to earn their own way. Career At the age of 14, Thomas entered the Royal African Company as an apprentice. He was assigned to the Guinea Coast, where he served traders on the rivers. He eventually became a chief agent on York Island, Sherbro. This was a slave trading center on the Sherbro River. While working in the Sherbro region, he married a daughter of a Sherbro chief. By Sherbro family accounts, she was known to the English as Seniora Doll or Senora Doll, and was of the house of Ya Kumba. Her father ruled on the shore of the Yawry Bay (according to Bulom oral tradition). The couple had two sons, Robin and Stephen. Thomas Corker was transferred by the Royal African Company to The Gambia in April 1699 and left his Sherbro family behind. On a business trip to England, he died at his birthplace of Falmouth in 1700 and was buried there. His sons, Robin and Stephen Corker, inherited their mother's chiefdom; they used their English ancestry to build influence with other early traders in the region. The Crown opened up the slave trade beyond the RAC, and the family became influential in and wealthy from it well into the nineteenth century. The family may have intermarried in the eighteenth century and later with descendants of Skinner Caulker, an English man known to have settled in the region in the mid-eighteenth century, as did James Cleveland. Both also married local women and had descendants who competed for power in the region. By the nineteenth century, the family was known as the Caulkers. They dominated the Bumpe Chiefdom in the colony of Sierra Leone and were a major slave trading Afro-European clan in West Africa. Descendants Today most of the Caulker descendants live in the towns of Bonthe and Shenge in the Moyamba District, where the Sherbro are concentrated. The clan still maintains its oral and written testimony about its English ancestor, Thomas Corker. Honors Corker was memorialized by a Baroque marble and freestone monument at the Church of King Charles the Martyr, Falmouth, where he had been baptized as a child. \\"MONUMENTS: include Baroque marble and freestone monument to Thomas Corker, d.1709 aged 31.\\" His brother Robert Corker had made his life in the town and was five times elected as mayor.

The narrator lists the names of the rivers that the Red Army crosses as they march west: Volga, Don, Desna, Dnieper, Bug, Dvina, Neman, Vistula, and finally, Oder. The Soviet arrival at the Oder river is shown, along with the broken bridges across it. The undeterred men of the Red Army are shown as they cross the river while under German fire. The use of missile artillery by the Soviet forces is showcased. After the Oder is crossed, the assault on Berlin itself begins. Footage of the actual battle is shown, as the Red Army fights German troops, street by street and building by building. This is interspersed with shots of Nazi propaganda films showing parades in the same areas, providing a sense of irony. A dramatic sequence follows a detachment of the Red Army in the assault on the Reichstag, which ends with the famous photograph, raising the Red Flag over the Reichstag. When the Soviet troops entered Berlin, they began to push forward to the Reichstag. There were soldiers from every available battalion, with flame throwers, rifles, sniper rifles, automatic weapons, like the PPSh-41, and others. There were over 40 Soviet T-34 tanks that were pushing the German soldiers back. The battle for Berlin was one of the longest battles for a city in the years 1900‚Äì2000.

Arbor Street / 88th Avenue West serves as a main route in the community. Grand Avenue is nearby. The area was first developed for worker housing to support the US Steel plant known as the Duluth Works. It was developed along the Saint Louis River. Background The Morgan Park neighborhood is also known as a planned community built by U.S. Steel to serve its Duluth Works steel plant in the early 1900s. Originally named \\"Model City\\" during its designing phase in 1913 and renamed in honor of U.S. Steel's founder J. P. Morgan in June 1914, the town of Morgan Park was built and run by the U.S. Steel Corporation until 1933, when it was all deeded to the City of Duluth. The community thrived with recreational facilities, community clubs, the Lake View Store, billed as America's first indoor mall, a K-12 school, and its own police and fire department. Eventually, the steel plant declined and was shut down in phases, the last facilities closing in 1981. The historic nature of the community is still present. History At the time of its completion, Morgan Park stood as one of the crowning achievements of company town conception. Connected to the city of Duluth by an East and West road link, the town was somewhat isolated from the rest of the city, and until the 1930s, only employees of the U.S. Steel Corporation and its subsidiaries could live there. After the properties had been transferred to the city, residential housing was opened to any qualified candidate. Minnesota Steel Company operated the steel plant. The town proprietor, known as the Morgan Park Company, was set up as its direct subsidiary. The Morgan Park Company served as a kind of private community government, responsible for trash pickup, lawn and house care, police and fire protection, health care (until the hospital closed in the 1920s), and snow removal. Residents of the town were expected to keep their homes up in a generally conservative suburban manner. If they failed to do so, the Morgan Park Company would do the work and deduct the costs from the employee's paycheck. =Morgan Park's Industry ‚Äì The Duluth Works= At the start of the 20th century, an industrial empire was developing and expanding along the Great Lakes, based on the great natural resources that supported iron and steel manufacturing. During the early 1900s, the Minnesota Legislature gave thought of imposing a hefty ore tax on every ton of ore that was shipped from the vast deposits on the Iron Range. No other company would be hurt more by this than the newly incorporated U.S. Steel. To persuade the legislature to give up the ore tax, US Steel agreed to build a manufacturing complex in Duluth, and produce some finished materials and products within the state that supplied the most iron ore to the company. US Steel carried coal and other raw materials in their ships up the Great Lakes to Duluth in their otherwise empty cargo holds; they filled the freighters with iron ore to return to the mills on the lower lakes, especially in Illinois and Ohio. Many speculators thought that Duluth would become a massive manufacturing center, second only to Pittsburgh or Chicago, but these ambitions never came close to being realized. The Minnesota Steel Company, which was incorporated by U.S. Steel in 1907, was the subsidiary operating unit of U.S. Steel in Duluth. The steel plant was under construction in 1908 and poured its first ingot of steel on December 11, 1916. It was the largest integrated steel works west of Chicago until Geneva Steel was constructed in 1943. Minnesota Steel Company was the largest employer in the city of Duluth from its inception to its closing, to include the steel and cement plants, and was the fourth-largest industrial manufacturing facility in the State of Minnesota. Minnesota Steel was the holding company for the steel plant (and for Morgan Park itself) until it was leased to the American Steel and Wire Division (AS&W;) of U.S. Steel in June 1932. This was part of a restructuring effort by the parent company to deal with the Great Depression and associated market problems. AS&W; would remain the plant's main operating parent under the U.S. Steel imperial umbrella until 1964, when more restructuring move by U.S. Steel placed several of its smaller operations under one division. (At this point forward, the steel plant was known simply within the Corporation and the market as USS Duluth Works.) The Duluth Works was primarily a wire product manufacturer, taking raw materials such as iron ore and coke, and converting them into iron and, later, steel for the production of blooms, bars, billets and rods. The Duluth Works shipped many of its semi-finished products to other U.S. Steel mills for finishing. The merchant and wire mills used its own steel to furnish various types of nails, wire, barbed wire, fencing and fence posts, highway mesh, and sign posts and other various products. As an act of pride, the Duluth Works nail department left out the fourth barb, used in holding the wire and then striking the top of it to make a head, leaving an obvious omission on the side of the nail to signify that this nail was made in Duluth. It was used in promotions in the Twin Ports area to entice consumers to \\"Look for the missing fourth barb\\" on the nail to see if it was made at Duluth Works. In the late 1930s until its closing, Duluth Works fence posts, steel wool and barbed wire, were produced within the U.S. Steel empire only at the Duluth Works. The wire mesh product, created in 1954, and the US Steel's Universal Atlas Cement plant were instrumental to building the ICBM missile silos of the Midwest for the Strategic Air Command of the United States Air Force. =Closing and Fate= Duluth Works was caught up in industrial restructuring during the early 1970s to the mid-1980s, as was other heavy industry in the Midwest. The story was the same as at other plants all over the country; Youngstown. Homestead. Duquesne. Fairless. McKeesport. Many plants that were once powerhouses within U.S. Steel and the industry as a whole, were demolished by cutting torches. The dumping of artificially low-priced foreign steel in the United States was partly to blame, but the Duluth Works and many other plants had not been modernized with the Basic Oxygen Furnaces (BOF) to replace its outdated open hearth technology. This has been introduced when the plant was first built. Duluth Works was located in a market where other plants could meet its own output and demand. The Duluth Works, despite being an integrated steel maker, used only 20% of its own steel for products that it made for its own market area, an area that was sparsely populated and small in demand. The rest of its semi-finished steel material was sent to Joliet Works, Chicago, and Gary. In the 1960s and 1970s, there were rising demands for industry to clean up its effect on the environment. In June 1970 the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency gave U.S. Steel three years to conduct a study of its harmful emissions at the Duluth Works and a two-year follow-up window to implement corrective actions. Instead, U.S. Steel decided in September 1971 to close the \\"hot side\\" of the Duluth Works. It ended all iron and steel-making productions of the blast furnaces, pig iron casters and open hearths would cease. 1,600 steel workers were out of their jobs. The cold side operations were to continue, using steel brought in from Gary or other U.S Steel plants, to make rod and wire products. In October 1973, the company also shut down the cold side, leaving only the coke plant, the cement plant and several other smaller operations going in Morgan Park. The cement plant (operated by Universal Atlas Cement Company - another subsidiary of U.S. Steel) closed in 1976, leaving only the coke plant still operating. Only 200 employees remained as residents of Morgan Park. Finally in 1979, the MPCA clamped down on the emissions of the coke plant as well, and in 1981 US Steel closed the coke plant and ended its association with Duluth. The government held U.S. Steel to its responsibilities as a land tenant. The land occupied by the former plant and the surrounding area was polluted after almost 70 years of heavy industry. So polluted, that the Pollution Control Agency placed the site on the Environmental Protection Agency's Superfund list in 1984, requiring a plan and actions for hazard containment and environmental remediation. That year, buildings were inspected and harmful materials removed. In 1988, US Steel contracted for the razing and demolition of the once massive complex; the last of the buildings was brought down in 1997. Today the land of the former steel and cement plants sit primarily vacant, a brownfield available for development. The cement plant has been deemed as \\"cleaned\\" by U.S. Steel and the city of Duluth. The former steel plant site still has areas affected with pollution, which are areas of concern for area residents and prospective new tenants of the property. The MPCA, EPA and U.S. Steel continue to monitor and treat the site and surrounding areas. The Duluth company Ikonics Corporation, in April 2008, has expressed intent to build a warehouse facility on the former cement plant site. With the City of Duluth's Duluth Economic and Development Authority, or DEDA, it has begun land preparation to use up to of the former industrial plant. After almost 30 years, some activity will return to Morgan Parks industrial plain.

Post-War net laying assignments  USS Butternut departed Leyte Gulf in convoy on 24 February 1947 and shaped a course for the Marianas. She arrived at Guam on 9 March and began three years of service in the Trust Territories of the Pacific Ocean Islands. Based at Apra Harbor on Guam, she carried passengers and cargo among the islands as well as laying and tending nets at various islands. The ship also performed several assignments off Iwo Jima laying mooring buoys and assisting in the recovery, repair and replacement of submarine lines. the ship departed Guam on 19 June 1950 for repairs at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard. The net laying ship completed repairs and put to sea on 15 September. Steaming via Guam and Iwo Jima, she arrived in Sasebo, Japan, on 28 October. The ship conducted operations at Sasebo and Yokosuka, Japan, until 7 July 1951 when she set sail for Guam to resume her former duties in the Trust Territories. On 12 December 1951, USS Butternut arrived in Pearl Harbor for regular overhaul. She completed repairs almost eight months later, putting to sea for the west coast of the United States. The net laying ship reached San Francisco, California, on 15 August 1952 but moved south to San Diego, California, soon thereafter. Assigned to the 11th Naval District, USS Butternut spent a little more than five years operating in and around San Diego tending nets and buoys as well as serving as a training platform for students at the Naval Net School, Tiburon, California, and for members of the U.S. Naval Reserve.  Pacific missile test support  In 1957, however, her mission changed significantly with the de-emphasis of nets in harbor defense in favor of more sophisticated techniques. On 14 December 1957, the Naval Ordnance Test Station (NOTS), China Lake, California, assumed operational control of USS Butternut. Administrative control remained with the commandant, 11th Naval District. For the next seven years, the ship provided support services for the Polaris missile test and development program. In addition to serving as a monitoring platform for the scientists and engineers engaged in the program, USS Butternut towed hardware and support craft to and from the San Clemente Island test site, conducted surveys of the ocean bottom at the site, carried missiles to the site, and performed a myriad of other support services. In 1964, the U.S. Navy concluded its Polaris missile tests at San Clemente Island and closed the facility there. China Lake, however, retained operational control over Butternut for the purpose of testing the Mark 46 anti-submarine warfare (ASW) torpedo and its first modification. That duty, punctuated by repair periods, occupied her until the summer of 1969.  Decommissioning  Found to be excess to the needs of the U.S. Navy late in June 1969, USS Butternut was decommissioned at San Diego, California, on 18 July 1969, and her name was struck from the navy list that same day.  Post- decommissioning activity  Almost immediately, however, she was reinstated on the list of service craft as YAG-60 for service on the Pacific Missile Range. That assignment lasted for about two years until June 1971. On 1 July 1971, her service craft designation was struck from the navy list. Early in 1972, she became a salvage training hulk for Service Squadron (ServRon) 5 at Maui in the Hawaiian Islands. She was so employed until June 1977 at which time she was destroyed as a target.  Awards  USS Butternut received one battle star for World War II service.

Beach Haven on Long Beach Island is not a member municipality. The Headquarters branch is in Toms River. It also offers Outreach services to life care centers, Books by Mail and Home Borrowers services for the homebound, and a volunteer program. There are active Friends of the Library groups associated with individual branches. There are approximately 380,000 registered borrowers, and 290,000 bibliographic records in the catalog. Annual circulation was near 4.4 million in 2014. All library locations have free wireless access to the Internet and internet terminals for public use. History The Ocean County Library opened its doors to the public on September 19, 1925. Its location was a small cottage, known as the Lonan Building, on the grounds of the County Courthouse. The service area encompassed 30 of the 33 county municipalities. Dover and Lakewood Townships, and Beach Haven Borough, having municipal libraries, were excluded. The cottage was open to the public one day a week, while a Model T panelled truck took library service to the rural portion of the 28,000 population by stopping at schools and ‚Äústations‚Äù which were located in post offices, stores and enclosed porches of private homes. During World War II, there was even a station at a Coast Guard Station. A Dover Township referendum vote in 1976 increased the Library's geographical service area to 31 municipalities. Bishop Memorial Library on Washington Street in Toms River became part of the Ocean County Library, but continued to serve Dover residents until both floors were converted to use by the Children's Services Department in 1978. Needing more space, the library was moved to temporary quarters in the Robbins Street Firehouse before moving to the East Wing of the Ocean County Courthouse in 1950. In 1962, the Library moved to 15 Hooper Avenue, a building that had been a gymnasium for St. Joseph's School, and is now the Ocean County Probation Office. From this location, the Library expanded into the \\"White House\\" on the corner of Hooper Avenue and Water Street and, in 1978, into the Bishop Building. On October 13, 1981, the Ocean County Library opened the doors of a building at 101 Washington Street, facing the County Courthouse. This building surrounded and included the former Presbyterian Church of Toms River as a meeting room. The church cornerstone was laid in 1853. The church moved to a new location in 1970 leaving the building empty. The building was purchased by Dover Township and was incorporated into the library in 1981. The church steeple was badly damaged over the years and was removed as part of the expansion of the Toms River Branch in 2005. The former church with a newly constructed steeple is now a coffee shop open during most library hours. \\"Freeholders dedicate library's new steeple.\\" Asbury Park Press, May 12, 2007. The new Hugh B. Wheeler reading room contains an extensive genealogy collection, along with other materials and a reading area. The Bishop Building, named after the writer and adventurer Nathaniel Holmes Bishop, was re-dedicated in October, 1984 to house a non- circulating local history and research collection. On September 18, 1997, a new computer training lab was dedicated in the Bishop Building. In 2006, all services formerly available in the Bishop Building were moved to the main building. The genealogical and historical research collection was moved to the Wheeler Room and the computer training lab was expanded and re-established as the Technology Lab with all new equipment.

Kreider, a 16-year-old high school student at the time, murdered classmate and friend Kevin Haines, his father Thomas Haines, and mother Lisa Haines in their home at night before fleeing. Kreider was arrested a month later on 16 June 2007, charged with three counts of first degree murder, pleaded guilty to all charges, and was subsequently convicted on all three counts and sentenced to three consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole. Kreider later became eligible for a re-sentencing hearing following the United States Supreme Court's 2012 decision in Miller v. Alabama, which held that mandatory sentences of life without the possibility of parole are unconstitutional for juvenile offenders. On 20 January 2017, Kreider committed suicide by hanging himself in his prison cell, before the resentencing hearing was scheduled.  Background  = Alec Kreider = Alec Devon Kreider was born on February 4, 1991, to Timothy Scot Kreider and Angela Parsons Kreider. Kreider lived with his mother and was a sophomore student at Manheim Township High School. = Haines family = Thomas Alan Haines (age 50), an industrial-supplies salesman who worked in Lancaster, Lisa Ann Haines (n√©e Brown, age 47), a preschool teacher at Lancaster Brethren Preschool, their daughter Maggie (age 20), a student at Bucknell University, and their son Kevin (age 16), a high school sophomore, lived in Manheim Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. Kevin Haines was also a sophomore student at Manheim Township High School, where he was classmates with Kreider in German class, and according to a fellow student the two were \\"close buddies\\". Alec attended the family's memorial service on May 19, 2007.  Murders, police response, and investigation  On morning of May 12, 2007, Maggie Haines, who was awakened by a noise in the middle of the night and \\"smelled blood\\", ran from the home and across the street to a neighbor who called 911 for help. Alec Kreider (then age 16) had entered the Haines' home without force, stabbing Thomas and Lisa in their sleep, killing Thomas and severely wounding Lisa. Alec then went to Kevin's room and, after a struggle, stabbed him to death before returning to slit Lisa's throat, killing her, then escaping before the police could arrive. Communication between the Haines' neighbor, the call-taker at 911, and the dispatcher caused extreme unnecessary delay in police response to the \\"unknown disturbance\\". The official timeline notes that it took the first responding officer nearly twelve minutes to arrive from a distance of four miles in the middle of the night with no traffic barriers. Police say this delay had no bearing on the survival of the victims. The parents were found dead in their bedroom and Kevin was found at the opposite end of the upstairs hallway on the floor outside his bedroom. According to police reports, bloody shoe prints led away from Kevin's body and into the parents' bedroom, and from there to the common upstairs bathroom, where a shoe print was found on the linoleum in front of the sink. Police presume the murderer attempted to clean up at the sink as blood was also found there. Bloody shoe prints appeared on lower carpeted steps as the perpetrator exited the house. Blood transfer was also found on the rear sliding glass door. Maggie Haines was not killed because Alec did not know that she was home from college at the time of the murders. The law enforcement investigation began around 2:40 a.m. on May 12, 2007. The victims were declared dead shortly after 5 a.m. by deputy county coroners, and autopsies were performed two days later. The day after the murders, bloodhounds tracked \\"a strong scent of fear\\" along a path that led down the hill to PA Route 501 and north to an ice cream/fast food restaurant, where the trail vanished. Police presumed the perpetrator had a vehicle waiting and used it to escape. Upon Kreider's arrest, all information associated with the bloodhounds was dismissed, as it did not match law enforcement's new theory. The police explanation was simple: \\"the dogs made a mistake\\".  Arrest, trial, and aftermath  After a month of intense national and regional media coverage and speculation, including tracking by bloodhounds and an intensive search by Pennsylvania State Police cadets, Kreider was arrested on June 16, 2007. Kreider's father, Timothy Scot Kreider, informed authorities that his son had confessed to the killings two days earlier. Kreider pled guilty to three counts of first degree murder and was sentenced to three consecutive life sentences without parole on June 17, 2008. His age at the time of the crime prevented him from being sentenced to death due to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling, Roper v. Simmons (2005). Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas Judge David Ashworth denied Kreider's post-sentence challenge to his consecutive sentences, and the Pennsylvania Superior Court affirmed Ashworth's denial. On December 8, 2009, Kreider filed a petition under Pennsylvania's Post- Conviction Collateral Relief Act, which Judge Ashworth denied on June 15, 2010. An appeal to Pennsylvania Superior Court was later discontinued by Kreider. Kreider's motive for the killings was unclear, although according to an entry investigators found in his journal, he claims to have \\"despised happy people\\". A financial reward offered on behalf of the Haines family remained unclaimed.  Death  On January 20, 2017 (15 days shy of his 26th birthday), Kreider committed suicide by passive hanging in his prison cell at SCI Camp Hill in Cumberland County, Pennsylvania. At the time of his death, Kreider was among a group of Lancaster County juvenile offenders eligible for a resentencing hearing in view of the United States Supreme Court's 2012 decision in Miller v. Alabama that mandatory sentences of life in prison without the possibility of parole are unconstitutional for juvenile offenders, and the 2016 decision in Montgomery v. Louisiana that made Miller apply retroactively. The county had delayed scheduling these hearings, pending a Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling in Commonwealth v. Batts.  In media  The murder of the Haines family was the subject of the Season 3 premiere of Investigation Discovery's Unusual Suspects; the network revisited the case in a 2014 episode of its Nightmare Next Door series; and again in 2019 in an episode of its Evil Lives Here series. Author Michael W. Cuneo also wrote about the case in his true crime book A Need to Kill: Confessions of a Teen Killer. Alec Kreider's father, Tim Kreider, also wrote a book, Refuse to Drown, concerning his son's involvement in the killings and the emotional turmoil the Kreider family went through in the aftermath. The story was also covered in the A&E; series Killer Kids in 2014.  References   Further reading  * Kreider, Tim. Refuse to Drown.

She sat on the UAT student council between 1989 and 1991 and taught there between 1995 and 2004. Political career Hern√°ndez got her start in the Secretariat of Finances of Tlaxcala, working her way up to be the secretary. She also worked on gubernatorial and deputy campaigns in the state, and for a time in the state secretariat of health. In 1999, Hern√°ndez joined the Party of the Democratic Revolution. In 2003, she was elected to the Chamber of Deputies as a proportional representation deputy for the LIX Legislature. She sat on the commissions for Budget and Public Accounts and Strengthening of Federalism.

She ultimately dropped out of the race and urged her supporters to vote for the PAN candidate, Adriana D√°vila Fern√°ndez, in order to prevent the PRI from winning the elections. Months later, Hern√°ndez left the PRD to join the PAN, the second defection of a PRD senator in a short span. In 2015, the PAN returned Hern√°ndez to the Chamber of Deputies by placing her on their list from the fifth electoral region, representing the State of Mexico. She presides over the Bicameral Commission on Financial Discipline and sits on four others, mostly financial in nature. Despite not representing her home state of Tlaxcala, she still mentioned in her first annual report of activities, delivered in Tlaxcala City, that she primarily sought funds for projects in such cities as Chiautempan, Nanacamilpa and her hometown of San Dami√°n Texoloc.

It was directed by the Canadian-American director, Edward Dmytryk, from an adaptation by Emmet Lavery of Gregor Ziemer's book Education for Death.Crowther, Bosley. \\"Review: 'Hitler's Children', fictionalized version of 'Education for Death,' makes its appearance at the Paramount Theatre.\\" The New York Times, February 25, 1943. Hitler's Children stars Tim Holt, Bonita Granville, and Kent Smith. One of the most financially successful films of RKO Studios, the film is known for portrayal of brutalities associated with the Hitler Youth, represented particularly by two young participants. A line from one of the movement's songs is featured in the film: \\"For Hitler we will live and for Hitler we will die\\" (translated from German). Plot In 1933 Berlin, Professor Nichols runs the American Colony School. It is next to the Horst Wessel School, where young Germans are indoctrinated into Nazism. During a brawl between the student bodies, Karl Bruner, a German youth born in the United States, objects when Anna Muller, a US citizen born in Germany, smacks him with her baseball bat. The students are attracted to each other despite this beginning. Anna's parents had sent her to Germany to be educated, although they allowed her to go to the American school. Soon, the professor, Anna, and Karl become good friends, though they do not agree politically. After a while though, they lose touch with each other. Six years later, as war looms in Europe, Karl Bruner, now a lieutenant in the Gestapo, removes students of the \\"wrong\\" nationalities from the American School. Anna is taken out although by then she is working as an assistant teacher. As she was born in Germany to German parents, the German government classifies her as German despite her US citizenship. Nichols tries to find Muller, but the U.S. consulate has no power and Anna's German grandparents are too frightened to help. Nichols' friend Franz Erhart suggests that the professor get permission from the Ministry of Education to inspect a certain labor camp, where Muller is likely being held. Nichols happens to meet Gestapo Colonel Henkel and his aide and prot√©g√© Bruner. Henkel approves Nichols' request to visit Muller but, in private, the young Bruner tries to dissuade Nichols. He says that Muller has become \\"a model German.\\" Nichols cannot believe this and finds he is right when he speaks privately with Muller at the camp. She discourages Nichols from trying to rescue her, as it would be too dangerous and stands little chance of success. Bruner recommends Muller for an advanced \\"Geopolitik\\" course at a German university but, when interviewed by Henkel and Dr. Graf of the education department, Anna turns down the opportunity, fearing they intend her to become a spy against the US. She is sent back to the camp and demoted from the staff to a laborer. Learning that she has engaged in anti-Nazi behavior, Henkel orders her to be sterilized. When Bruner learns of this, he tries to persuade Anna to pretend to be a good Nazi and bear his child to prove her usefulness to Germany, but she refuses. She runs away from the camp and reaches Berlin, where she hides in a Roman Catholic church. A search party finds her and takes her away over the protests of the bishop. Henkel orders her to receive ten lashes and sends Bruner to witness her punishment. After she is whipped the second time, Bruner stops the action, although he knows he has doomed himself and Anna. Bruner pretends to have realized his mistake and recants. Henkel however arranges for a national radio broadcast of the trial of Bruner and Muller. He promises Karl full honors at his funeral. Professor Nichols is ordered to leave Germany immediately or he will be arrested as an accessory to treason. At the airport, Nichols hears Karl use his opening statement to denounce Hitler's Germany before the young man is shot and killed. Anna is shot and killed as she rushes to Karl. Cast Production Tim Holt was given the lead. Then when he seemed he would be unavailable Kent Smith was assigned instead.¬£Metro Making Film Tests of Canada Lee, Negro Actor, for Role in Two Movies: PICTURES COMING TODAY ' Tish,' With Marjorie Main, to Open at State -- 'Spitfire' Comedy Bill at Palace\\" By Telephone to THE NEW YORK TIMES..

The director, however, got into a spat with the producer, Edward A. Golden, and expected RKO to back him up. He was surprised by being released and replaced by Edward Dmytryk.Stafford, Jeff. \\"Articles: 'Hitler's Children'.\\" Turner Classic Movies.

Reception Hitler's Children was reviewed in The New York Times, where reviewer Bosley Crowther considered the melodrama to be \\"obvious, conventional\\". He further noted,\\"Edward Dmytryk, who directed, has set the whole thing in an oratorical style and has given it the quality of a philippic rather than a credible story from life.\\" Despite lukewarm critical reviews, Hitler's Children was a massive hit and earned RKO a profit of $1.21 million.Jewell 2016 It was the fourth-highest grossing film of the year and RKO's most successful film of the year. The writer and director were each given $5,000 bonuses for their work.Jewell and Harbin 1982, p. 181. The film is also one of Granville's most recognized performances other than her Nancy Drew films. So successful was this film that RKO used Edward Dmytryk to direct other war films. He directed Back to Bataan, starring John Wayne; The Young Lions, and the smash hit of the 1950s, The Caine Mutiny. The last war film he made was Anzio (1968).

Youth The son of Galician immigrants, at the age of 13, Iglesias began to work in a factory, where, at age 21, he was appointed as a union shop steward. Political career Henceforward a supporter of the Peronist Party, Iglesias was elected as the Mayor of Avellaneda in the Province of Buenos Aires upon Juan Domingo Per√≥n's 1973 return from exile and subsequent election to his final turn at the Argentine Presidency. Aligning himself with Per√≥n's most right-wing adviser, Jos√© L√≥pez Rega, during the internal strife that followed Per√≥n's 1974 passing, he was dismissed from this post following the 1976 military coup headed by General Jorge Videla. Cardboard coffin controversy In 1983, Iglesias was the Peronist candidate for Governor of the Province of Buenos Aires. However, at a \\"victory rally\\" towards the end of the election campaign, his followers approached him with a cardboard coffin with the inscription \\"UCR\\" (representing their main opposition), which he set on fire. This episode was broadcast by national TV channels. For many observers, this act was perceived by public opinion as a recall of the country's recent violent past, and was decisive in the victory of the UCR in the general elections and in his own loss to UCR gubernatorial candidate Alejandro Armend√°riz. After this incident, he significantly lost his political prestige while quemar el caj√≥n became political jargon for insensitive faux pas. Legislative branch Between 1985 and 1989, Iglesias occupied a seat in the Argentine Chamber of Deputies. In the 1990s, he was a Councillor in the Municipality of Avellaneda.

Bootle was one of the Labour Party's safest seats, having held the seat since 1945. May by-election The first by-election was caused by the death of Labour MP Allan Roberts, on 21 March 1990. Roberts had held the seat since the 1979 general election, and his majority had remained over 15,000 votes; even at the 1983 general election, which was a landslide victory for the Conservative Party. At the 1987 general election, Roberts' majority had increased to almost 25,000 votes. For the by- election, Labour selected Michael Carr, a full-time official for the Transport and General Workers Union, and a former Labour Party councillor. The Conservatives, who had consistently taken second place in the seat but was struggling in the national polls, nominated James Clappison, a barrister from Yorkshire. He had unsuccessfully contested Barnsley East for the Conservative Party in 1987, and the South Yorkshire constituency at the 1989 European Parliament election. The newly named Liberal Democrats had suffered in the national polls since their formation by a merger of the Liberal Party and the Social Democratic Party (SDP), and in Bootle they were challenged by both David Owen's continuing Social Democratic Party and Michael Meadowcroft's continuing Liberal Party, each consisting of members of the former Alliance parties who had rejected their merger. The Green Party also nominated a candidate. Screaming Lord Sutch of the Official Monster Raving Loony Party and an independent rounded out the field. The Loonies gained publicity after the Labour Party election agent unsuccessfully tried to get Sutch charged with having a public house as an election campaign headquarters. This had not been illegal since 1987. The election was held on 24 May. Despite having to contend with a large field of candidates, Carr increased the Labour vote, to win with more than three-quarters of all the votes cast. The Conservative vote halved, although they retained second place, as the Liberal Democrat vote could not match that of the SDP-Liberal Alliance in 1987. The Greens polled 3.6%, while the continuing Liberals fared poorly, and the continuing Social Democrats were beaten even by the Monster Raving Loonies. Sutch jokingly offered to form a coalition with them, and the party was wound up soon afterwards, but Holmes formed yet another Social Democratic Party of members who wished to continue. November by-election Carr died on 20 July, only 57 days after his by- election victory. A second by-election was called for 8 November. Labour nominated Joe Benton, the leader of Sefton Borough Council, a local Justice of the Peace and a personnel manager with Girobank. All the other parties nominated the same candidates as in May, except for the Social Democratic Party which did not participate (neither did the independent Schofield). The only addition to the field was David Black, a candidate in the previous year's Vauxhall and Vale of Glamorgan by-elections, standing as \\"Christian Alliance\\". On a low turnout of 39.7%, Benton increased the Labour Party majority again, taking 78.2% of the vote. The Conservative vote held steady, while all the other parties fell back. This allowed the Loonies to overtake the continuing Liberal Party. Benton remained as the Member of Parliament for Bootle until he retired in 2015, while Clappison was elected in 1992 for Hertsmere; he too retired in 2015.

In 1895, Rothrock was appointed the first forestry commissioner to lead the newly formed Division of Forestry in the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture. Two of his major accomplishments as commissioner were his land acquisition program and the creation of a forest academy to train foresters for state service. Biography =Early life= Joseph Rothrock was born in McVeytown in Mifflin County, Pennsylvania in the United States to a German farming family. He was often ill as a child and spent many hours hiking the woods of Mifflin County for exercise to combat his illnesses. It was while on these walks that Rothrock developed a love for the outdoors. He went on to become a pioneering environmentalist in Pennsylvania, helping preserve and re-establish the forests that he so loved. =Education and early career= Joseph Rothrock studied under Asa Gray, a renowned botanist at Harvard University. Rothrock received a bachelor of science in botany from Harvard in 1862 (possibly 1864). He enlisted in the Union Army the following year, saw action during the American Civil War and was seriously wounded at the Battle of Fredericksburg. Rothrock was discharged from the Army on June 6, 1864, having reached the rank of captain in the 20th Pennsylvania Cavalry. He furthered his education at the University of Pennsylvania, receiving a doctor of medicine degree in 1867. Rothrock began practice in Centre County, Pennsylvania, but in 1870 moved to Wilkes-Barre, making a specialty of diseases of the eye and ear. He was one of the founders of Wilkes-Barre Hospital, and served on the faculty of Penn State University from 1867 to 1869, where he taught botany, human anatomy and physiology. Rothrock was associated with the exploring party of the Western Union extension telegraph in British Columbia 1865-1866. He served as a surgeon and botanist for the geographical and geological exploration and survey west of the 100th meridian under Lieut. George M. Wheeler, the Wheeler Survey, 1873-1875. In 1876, he established the North Mountain School of Physical Culture in Luzerne County, also during the same year he was appointed by the American Philosophical Society lecturer on forestry in execution of the Michaux legacy. He studied botany in Alsace at the University of Strassburg in 1880. It was while Rothrock was in Europe that he began to study forest management, which led him to be a pioneer in forest management in Pennsylvania and the United States. =Later career= Plaque in McVeytown, Pennsylvania dedicated in 1924 to Rothrock Dr. Joseph Rothrock served as the first president of the Pennsylvania Forestry Association (PFA) in 1886. The PFA was formed to promote conservation and to support the creation of state parks and state forests in Pennsylvania. Rothrock was a member of the PFA for most of the rest of his life. He used it as a pulpit to \\"incite the interest of people throughout the state on forestry -- to preserve, protect and propagate the forest.\\" Rothrock was appointed Commissioner of Forestry in Pennsylvania in 1895. He led the drive to purchase land from lumber companies to create many of the state forests that are spread throughout Pennsylvania. Rothrock used his medical expertise to open a sanatorium at what is now Mont Alto State Park. The sanatorium treated those afflicted with tuberculosis and other respiratory illnesses. He also opened the Pennsylvania State Forestry Academy, now Penn State Mont Alto, in 1903 under the authorization of Pennsylvania Governor, Samuel W. Pennypacker. Rothrock resigned as Commissioner of Forestry in 1904, but continued to serve on the Commission until 1914. Legacy Joseph Trimble Rothrock died in 1922 at West Chester, Pennsylvania, leaving behind a legacy of environmental restoration and conservation. In his position as Pennsylvania Commissioner of Forestry he was able to begin the process of acquiring land for the creation of the many state forests and parks that now dot Pennsylvania's landscape. As a voice for environmental protection, he inspired succeeding generations to conserve and manage the use of Pennsylvania's extensive forests. Rothrock pioneered the treatment of tuberculosis in sanatoriums, established a hospital in Wilkes-Barre and helped explore the Canadian frontier. In a speech given in 1915, Rothrock recalled the forests of his youth: \\"Sixty years ago I walked from Clearfield to St. Marys; thence to Smethport -- 60 miles; most of the way through glorious white pine and hemlock forests. Now these forests are gone.\\" In describing the forest conditions of 1915 he said, \\"6,400 square miles; more than 4 million acres [16,000 km¬≤] of the state are desolated, cut and unprotected from fire.\\" He compared Pennsylvania's forests to similar forest destruction in China. He worried that, \\"unless we reforest, Pennsylvania's highlands will wash into the oceans.\\" Thanks to men like Joseph Rothrock, Jacob Nolde, Maurice Goddard and Gifford Pinchot, Pennsylvania has thriving second growth forests that have recovered from the ravages of the lumber era that swept across its hills and valleys in the late 19th century.

Background He was a 5th-generation cattle rancher in the Flores Department. He was intendente (intendant) and council member of Flores. And in 1967 was elected as a congressman of the national assembly. Agricultural activities In the 1950s he joined Alberto Gallinal, Carlos Frick and Carlos Pereira Iraola in the creation of the Sociedad de Praderas, an honorary association whose objective was to improve the productivity of Uruguay's natural grassland. In the 1960s with the support of the World Bank he created and directed the Plan Agropecuario with the objective of improving the productivity of Uruguay's natural pastures using New Zealand technology . The program was very successful until 1972 when the UK joined the EEC and stopped buying Uruguayan beef, which caused prices to fall and the cost of new technology become unprofitable. This pioneer effort grew like wildfire, bringing new ideas and technology that had a profound impact in the following generation of agronomists and ranchers. It also had a long-term impact which helped the excellent export performance of the dairy and cattle industries 30 years later. Today the New Zealanders are buying land in Uruguay, improving pastures, increasing dairy yields and export prices have doubled. The seed sown by Alberto Gallinal and his dicipules was not lost, the dream has become a reality.

Published in 1999, when he was a physician practicing internal medicine in El Paso, Texas, this is an autobiographical memoir, and Abraham Verghese writes of his experience moving to El Paso in the midst of an unraveling marriage. Once there, he meets and eventually becomes a mentor to David Smith, a medical resident at the hospital where Verghese worked and a brilliant tennis player recovering from drug addiction. Because of his own love for the game and as part of his effort to reach out to the troubled resident, Verghese begins to play singles tennis regularly during their free time outside the hospital. What starts as a casual game between the two men eventually develops into a complex ritual that allows them to develop a deep friendship and understanding of the pressures they each face. In the hospital, Verghese is the teacher and Smith the student. On the court, however, Smith, the one-time professional player, becomes the teacher. The story tells of their all too brief friendship as Smith battles and eventually succumbs to his disease, and Verghese's helpless attempts to intervene. While cited as fiction, The Tennis Partner is heavily autobiographical.

Notice the sleeves, fastened to the timber forms before the concrete is cast. improper sleeving in a drywall assembly. In construction, a sleeve is used both by the electrical and mechanical trades to create a penetration. Purpose * For cables we provide wall/deck penetration sleeve to avoid any damage to cable from material shifting on deck. * Deck penetrations on offshore platform provided to avoid water/chemical dripping to lower deck in case of spillage. * Acts as toe guard. * For wall penetrations it can be a type of strengthening. * Together with packing it helps to protect from fire spread from one room to other. Materials Sleeves can be made of: * sections of steel pipe * plastic * sheet metal * proprietary devices that are listed firestop components Requirements * Sleeves must be sized such as to adequately allow the passage of the intended penetrant(s) plus enough room to permit the practical installation and mounting of the penetrants as well as adequate room for firestops. A general practice is to size the sleeve two NPS (pipe sizes) up from the diameter of the penetrant. For example, a 4\\" pipe, with 1\\" of thermal insulation makes a 6\\" penetrant (1\\" pipe covering on each side of the pipe), plus two pipe sizes = an 8\\" sleeve, creating a 1\\" annulus. * In case of insulated piping, the size of the insulation must be taken into account for the intended firestop certification listing. Hazards * Metallic sleeves are heatsinks in the firestop that follows the mounting of the penetrants. Maximum and minimum tolerances for wall thicknesses must be taken into account prior to casting. Heatsinks can affect T-ratings. Organic sealants used for topcaulking in firestops may let go of the sleeve if it has conducted too much heat through to the unexposed side (as in the case of the fire test article, this picture). *Plastic sleeves are usually removed after the concrete forms are stripped, as they contribute fuel to an accidental fire.

It stars Philip Baker Hall. The film is a dystopian view of the near then- future of 2009. Plot Following the death of his wife, Arthur Pratt (Philip Baker Hall) is on the verge of taking his own life. However, after he has finished burying his wife's ashes at a nearby park, a duckling crosses his path. Noticing that the duckling is all alone, Arthur decides to help it find its brace. Unfortunately, they find its brace has been killed while crossing a road. In sympathy, Arthur then takes the surviving duckling to his apartment, where he bathes and feeds it. No longer on the verge of suicide, Arthur commits himself to raising and taking care of the duckling, whom he names ‚ÄúJoe.‚Äù After falling behind on his rent and because his retirement home doesn't allow pets, Arthur is evicted from his apartment and banned from the premises. Arthur returns with Joe to the park where they first met and is \\"transformed\\" into a full-grown duck. There, Arthur picks up the litter he finds and offers it to a garbage collector (Noel Gugliemi), who informs him that the park is used as a landfill and will soon become a construction site for a shopping mall. Workers from a septic and sewage service arrive to drain the pond on which they are living. They try to chase Joe away, but Joe hasn't learned to fly. The workers then start throwing rocks etc. at Joe, and Arthur comes to his rescue. Following a quarrel with the workers, the fire department, members of a psychological evaluation team, the city's animal control and finally the police, Arthur and Joe leave the park for good and set out on a new journey. During their wandering, Arthur and Joe cross paths with a variety of Los Angeles denizens, including: Norman (Bill Cobbs), a blind man on his way to the beach and his guide dog Trisha; Leopold (Bill Brochtrup), a homeless man to whom Arthur gives a pair of socks; a man (French Stewart) who is also on the verge of suicide because he knows his girlfriend is having an affair with his best friend; and a pedicurist (Amy Hill) whose husband was killed in Vietnam and who has moved to the US looking for a better life for herself and her daughter. Joe and Arthur make their way to a bridge where Arthur decides it may be best that they go their separate ways. Joe doesn't want to part from Arthur, but Arthur leaves him anyway. Joe then jumps off the bridge, and quacks in fright upon landing on the creek. Noticing the creek is full of toxic waste, Arthur once again rescues Joe. Arthur apologizes to Joe for abandoning him, telling him \\"I'd die without you, Joe.\\" Arthur and Joe finally arrive at the beach and are reunited with their acquaintances Norman and Trisha. The film ends as the four of them walk companionably along the shore. Cast * Philip Baker Hall as Arthur Pratt * Bill Brochtrup as Leopold * Amy Hill as Pedicurist * Noel Gugliemi as Lord of the Garbage * Larry Cedar as Mr. Janney * French Stewart as Jumper * Bill Cobbs as Norman According to The Boston Globe, Joe is portrayed by the Aflac duck. Reception Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 50% of 18 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 5.3/10. Metacritic rated it 53/100 based on seven reviews. Lisa Nesselson of Variety called it \\"a small, affecting road movie peopled with sharp vignettes\\". Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \\"Bettauer has a lot of serious things to put across about survival in the big, unfeeling metropolis, and while her modern-day fable obviously has Capra-esque intentions, the maudlin results cry out for a better focused, more sharply executed plan of attack.\\" Gary Goldstein at reel.com rated it 1.5 stars, saying \\"Duck is a turkey\\" and \\"Bettauer's made a tedious, groan-worthy picture notable only for the bigger issues it attempts‚Äîand fails‚Äîto successfully explore than for any real entertainment value.\\" The New York Times said \\"it tries too hard\\" and \\"ducks aren't all that endearing\\". Mark Feeney in the Boston Globe said that Bettauer \\"strikes a very uneasy balance\\" between playing for tears or laughs.

First foundation The foundation by Count Ricdag of the first religious house at Lamspringe for canonesses is conventionally dated at 847. This Augustinian priory became Lutheran during the Reformation and was destroyed during the Thirty Years' War in 1626. Second foundation The former abbey church, now the parish church In 1628 English Benedictine monks in exile approached the Bursfelde Congregation with a request for premises and in 1630 were granted the derelict buildings at Lamspringe, although they were unable to take possession and begin work on the monastery until the early 1640s, after the end of the Thirty Years' War. The English Benedictines rebuilt the abbey, dedicated to St Adrian of Corinth, a 3rd-century martyr, and St. Denis, and from 1671 ran a school here for English Catholic boys, mostly from Yorkshire and the north, which became a centre for Catholic education for, and influence on, Great Britain. Unlike the other English monasteries in exile, Lamspringe was a large abbey rather than a small priory, and was wealthy, with wide estates, and the community's wealth and status were reflected in the quality of the building works undertaken. The abbey church, serious work on which began in 1691 under abbot Maurus Corker, and the remaining monastery buildings, executed in rather grand style by abbot Joseph Rokeby up to 1731, still remain virtually intact. Lamspringe Abbey housed the relics of St Oliver Plunkett, taken there in 1684 by the later Abbot of Lamspringe, Corker, who had been with him in prison in London,the relics are now in Downside Abbey as well as the head of St Thomas of Hereford. The abbey was secularised in 1803 by the Kingdom of Prussia, and the monks returned to England. The library was dispersed; it had contained as its most famous item the St. Albans Psalter. The school was transferred to the then newly established Ampleforth Abbey and formed the basis of the present Ampleforth College. The monks, after a period of dispersal, reformed as a community at Broadway in Worcestershire between 1828 and 1841, after which they were spread among other houses, although the community was never formally disbanded. The last surviving members joined the abbey at Fort Augustus (1876-1998) at its foundation. Buildings The church still serves as the parish church, and the still impressive monastic buildings are put to a variety of parish and community uses. The abbey garden also survives and is one of the attractions of Lamspringe.

He intended for it to be built in Tokyo Bay, 2 km offshore from Tokyo, Japan. Design The design calls for a cone-shaped pyramid 840 meters high, with a base about as big as the Tokyo Olympic Stadium and glass sides for natural lighting. It is intended to be constructed on water, with boat and bridge access. Since the tower was planned for an area with frequent earthquakes and hurricane-strength winds, the shape is aerodynamic to reduce wind stress, and helical bands are wrapped around the tower for structural support. Steel tanks at the top of the tower are filled with water, and can be rotated as a counterweight against wind. The tower is a self-contained arcology containing one million square meters of commercial development and housing for 60,000 people, split into sections. Offices and light or clean industries are in the lower levels, apartments above, and the top section houses communications systems and wind or solar generators. Restaurants and viewing platforms would be interspersed through all sections. Horizontal and vertical high-speed metro lines provide long-distance travel, with cars designed to carry 160 people stopping at intermediate five-story 'sky centers' on every thirtieth floor. Each 'sky center' is decorated by gardens and mezzanines, and provides a particular service such as hotels or restaurants. Short-distance travel is by elevators or escalators. History The tower design was commissioned by the Obayashi Corporation as an arcology, intended to address land shortage and overpopulation in Tokyo. The design firm's web site states that \\"the project demonstrates that high-density or high-rise living does not mean overcrowding or hardship; it can lead to an improved quality of life, where housing, work and leisure facilities are all close at hand\\".

He served as a member of the church's First Council of the Seventy from 1945 until his death in 1975. Of Scottish descent, Hunter was born in Holden, Utah, the son of John Edward and Margaret Teeples Hunter. He attended Brigham Young High School, and Brigham Young University, receiving a bachelor's degree in 1929 and a master's degree in 1931. He married Ferne Gardner in Logan, Utah, in 1931, and the couple had six children. For several years Hunter worked as a public school administrator in Nevada and Utah. His first education job was as principal of a school in St. Thomas, Nevada, a city since flooded by Lake Mead.Leon R. Hartshorn. Outstanding Stories by General Authorities. (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Book, 1975) vol. 3, p. 153. He later taught LDS seminary courses while living in Provo, Utah. In 1935, Hunter earned Ph.D. in history from the University of California, Berkeley. Although his professors in Berkeley encouraged him to take a university position in history, he chose to continue as a teacher of religion and moved to Logan, Utah, to teach at the Institute of Religion. Hunter spent the next 17 years as a seminary teacher. Hunter was called to serve on the LDS Church's First Council of the Seventy and was sustained on April 6, 1945. Assignments as a general authority took him to many parts of the world, including trips to Mexico, Central America, and South America to study archaeological ruins in the context of accounts found within the Book of Mormon. Hunter was a cofounder of the New World Archaeological Foundation, and is the co-author of the book Ancient America and the Book of Mormon. First published in 1950, the book focuses on the writings of an Aztec historian Ixtlilxochitl who, in written accounts of Mesoamerican history provided to the newly arrived Europeans, appears to corroborate a number of claims made in the Book of Mormon. Hunter also served as national president of Delta Phi Kappa, a fraternity for former Mormon missionaries. Publications During his career as a teacher and church leader, Hunter wrote 23 books, principally on religious and history oriented topics. His book Brigham Young, the Colonizer, published in 1940, was based on his dissertation. Utah in Her Western Setting was enthusiastically reviewed and was used as a text in Utah schools. However, the revised edition, published as The Utah Story, was not as well received. He also produced history and church related articles, reviews, and papers. Although Hunter's work was well researched and clearly written, he wrote for a popular local audience and from a Mormon point of view. Utah historians Dale Morgan and Brigham D. Madsen were at times highly critical of Hunter's editing of material, his selective use of sources, and his avoidance of material detrimental to the reputation of the LDS Church. Geographer Wayne Wahlquist, in a review of literature relating to the settlement of the Utah area, noted Hunter's strengths and weaknesses as a scholar in Brigham Young, the Colonizer. Wahlquist praised Hunter for his accurate and comprehensive use of material, but noted his \\"superficial treatment of the colonization process, on such issues as land titles and distribution, and the types of lands settled, and for failing to recognize that the colonization process did not end with Brigham Young\\" (Walquist, p. 6‚Äì7). Historiographer Gary Topping, in 2003, noted that Hunter's \\"myopic cultural vision\\" was clearly apparent in his work: \\"Fully imbued with the patriotism, the chin-up optimism, and the faith in progress held by Mormons and other Americans during the World War II period, the books promote unrestrained industrial development and exploitation of natural resources\\" (Topping, p. 35). Topping also notes that Hunter's work ignores cultural diversity in the region, and portrays Native Americans in a disparaging manner. Notes References * * Topping, Gary.

The history of the Jews in the territory of modern Saudi Arabia begins in Biblical times. Early history The first mention of Jews in the areas of modern-day Saudi Arabia dates back, by some accounts, to the time of the First Temple. Immigration to the Arabian Peninsula began in earnest in the 2nd century CE, and by the 6th and 7th centuries there was a considerable Jewish population in Hejaz, mostly in and around Medina. This was in part due to the embrace of Judaism by such leaders as Dhu Nuwas; who was very aggressive about converting his subjects to Judaism. Nuwas persecuted Christians in his kingdom as a reaction to the Christian persecution of Jews by the local Christians and Abu Karib Asad.Ha-Redeye, O.: \\"Rescuing the Oppressed Doesn't Just Spoil War\\" , The Journal of Scriptural Reasoning, (2009) 8(1). In 523, the Himyarite king Dhu Nuwas (Dunaan), who had converted to Judaism, massacred the Christians there.Najran Jews at Beit Hatfutsot websites.

Banu Nadir was hostile to Muhammad's new religion. Other Jewish tribes lived relatively peacefully under Muslim rule. Banu Nadir, the Banu Qainuqa, and the Banu Qurayza lived in northern Arabia, at the oasis of Yathribu until the 7th century, when the men were sentenced to death and women and children enslaved after betraying the pact made with the Muslims following the Invasion of Banu Qurayza by Muslim forces under Muhammad.Kister, \\"The Massacre of the Banu Quraiza\\", p. 95f.Rodinson, Muhammad: Prophet of Islam, p. 213. =Other Arabian Jewish tribes= * Banu Alfageer * Banu Awf * Banu Harith or Bnei Chorath * Banu Jusham * Banu Quda'a * Banu Shutayba The journey of Benjamin of Tudela Map of the route. A historical journey to visit far-flung Jewish communities was undertaken by Rabbi Benjamin of Tudela from 1165 to 1173 that crossed and tracked some of the areas that are located in present-day Saudi Arabia. One map of his travels shows that he stopped at Jewish communities living in Tayma and Khaybar:Image:Benjamin of Tudela route.jpg two places that are known to have a longer significant historic Jewish presence in them, the Battle of Khaybar was fought between Muhammad and his followers against the centuries-long established Jewish community of Khaybar in 629. Tudela's trek began as a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. He may have hoped to settle there, but there is controversy about the reasons for his travels. It has been suggested he may have had a commercial motive as well as a religious one. On the other hand, he may have intended to catalogue the Jewish communities on the route to the Holy Land so as to provide a guide to where hospitality may have been found for Jews travelling to the Holy Land. He took the \\"long road\\" stopping frequently, meeting people, visiting places, describing occupations and giving a demographic count of Jews in every town and country. One of the known towns that Benjamin of Tudela reported as having a Jewish community was \\"El Katif\\" located in the area of the modern-day city of Hofuf in the northern part of the Arabian Peninsula. Al-Hofuf also Hofuf or Al-Hufuf () is the major urban center in the huge al-Ahsa Oasis in Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia. The city has a population of 287,841 (2004 census) and is part of a larger populated oasis area of towns and villages of around 600,000. It is located inland, southwest of Abqaiq and the Dhahran-Dammam-Al- Khobar metropolitan area on the road south to Haradh. Najran community Rabbi Salomon Halevi (Last Rabbi of Madras Synagogue) and his wife Rebecca Cohen(Najran Jew), Paradesi Jews of Madras There was a small Jewish community, mostly members of Bnei Chorath, in one border city from 1934 until 1950. The Yemeni city of Najran was conquered by Saudi forces in 1934, absorbing its Jewish community, which dates to pre-Islamic times.Gilbert, Martin, \\"In Ishmael's House\\", 2000, (p. 5) With increased persecution, the Jews of Najran made plans to evacuate. The local governor at the time, Amir Turki ben Mahdi, allowed the 600 Najrani JewsAhroni, Reuben \\"Jewish emigration from the Yemen, 1951-98\\", 2001 (p. 27) a single day on which to either evacuate or never leave again. Saudi soldiers accompanied them to the Yemeni border. These Jews arrived in Saada,Shulewitz, Malka Hillel \\"The Forgotten Millions\\", 2000 (p.86) and some 200 continued south to Aden between September and October 1949. The Saudi King Abdulaziz demanded their return, but the Yemeni king, Ahmad bin Yahya refused, because these refugees were Yemenite Jews. After settling in the Hashid Camp (also called Mahane Geula) they were airlifted to Israel as part of the larger Operation Magic Carpet.Gilbert, Martin, \\"In Ishmael's House\\", 2000, (p. 271) Some groups of Najran Jews escaped to Cochin, as they had very good relationship with the rulers of Cochin and maintained trade connections with Paradesi Jews.http://www.madrasmusings.com/vol-27-no-20/the- last-family-of-pardesi-jews-in-madras/ According to Yemenite Jewish tradition, the Jews of Najran traced their origin to the Ten Tribes. Modern era There has been virtually no Jewish activity in Saudi Arabia since the beginning of the 21st century. Jewish (as well as Christian and other non-Muslim) religious services are prohibited from being held in Saudi Arabia. When American military personnel were stationed in Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War, permission for small Christian worship services was eventually granted, but Jewish services were only permitted on US warships. Census data does not identify any Jews as residing within Saudi Arabian territory. Persons with an Israeli stamp in their passport or who are openly religious (and not Islamic) are generally not permitted to enter the Kingdom. In the 1970s, foreigners wishing to work in the kingdom had to sign an affidavit stating that they were not Jewish and official government forms granting foreigners permission to enter or exit the country do ask for religious affiliation. During the first Gulf War, there were allegations that some United States military authorities were encouraging Jewish military personnel to avoid listing their religions on their ID tags.www.ajcarchives, pages 178‚Äì179.

It has been affirmed that alternative \\"Protestant B\\" dog tags were created, in the event that a Jewish serviceman or woman was taken prisoner in Iraq. The story was included in one civilian writer's anthology of military stories she had been told by others, and then that one story was reprinted or quoted in many other in-print or online locations including Hadassah Magazine).

In late December 2014, the newspaper Al-Watan reported that the Saudi Labor ministry website permits foreign workers of a variety of different faiths, including Judaism, to live and work in Saudi Arabia. A source within the ministry said, in effect, that Israelis were not allowed to enter Saudi Arabia, but Jews of other nationalities would not have the entry ban applied to them.

Dunn, M.D. (1896‚Äì1975) was the leading figure in establishing a national vital statistics system in the United States and is known as the \\"father of the wellness movement\\". Early life Born in New Paris, Ohio, he attended the University of Minnesota where he earned his M.D. in 1922 and his Ph.D. in 1923. He served as an assistant in medicine at Presbyterian Hospital of New York City 1923-1924 and as fellow in medicine at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota (1924‚Äì1925). Work in statistics In 1929, he was the first biostatistician hired by the Mayo Clinic and established its computer coding system for deriving medical statistics. He was Chief of the National Office of Vital Statistics from 1935 through 1960, first as part of the Bureau of the Census and later under the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, where it eventually became the National Center for Health Statistics in 1960. In his final year with the U.S. Public Health Service he was Assistant Surgeon General for aging. He was one of the founders of the National Association for Public Health Statistics and Information Systems (NAPHSIS) and of the Inter- American Statistics Institute (IASI). He was Secretary General of the IASI from 1941 to 1952. The Halbert L. Dunn Award, named in his honor, has been presented since 1981 by NAPHSIS in recognition of outstanding and lasting contributions to the field of vital and health statistics. Wellness Dunn is known as the \\"father\\" of the wellness movement. He distinguished between good health‚Äînot being ill‚Äîand what he termed high-level wellness, which he defined as \\"a condition of change in which the individual moves forward, climbing toward a higher potential of functioning\\". He introduced the concept in a series of twenty-nine lectures at the Unitarian Church in Arlington County, Virginia in the late 1950s, which provided the basis for his book, High Level Wellness, published in 1961. The book was reissued in a number of editions but did not have a great deal of immediate impact. It did, however, come into the hands of a number of the future leaders of wellness and holistic health movement that bloomed more than a decade later, such as Don B. Ardell, Robert Russell, John Travis, and Elizabeth Neilson. Four events in the mid-1970s broadened the impact of Dunn's ideas. First, John Travis opened the first US wellness center (Mill Valley, CA, 1975). This center and other organizations were then described in Don Ardell's 1977 book, using Dunn's title (giving Dunn due credit for his origination of the title and concept). Then Elizabeth Neilson founded the journal Health Values: Achieving High Level Wellness (renamed the American Journal of Health Promotion in 1996), which was dedicated to Dunn and reprinted one of his papers in its first edition. Lastly, the publisher of Health Values, Charles B. Slack, Inc., published a reprint edition of Dunn's High Level Wellness that achieved a wider distribution and impact.

Synopsis  Ma Yoo Hee (Han Ga-in) is the executive of an advertising company. She would never be caught dead wearing make-up and only dresses in black. Her hairstyle and glasses are very business like looks, her only enjoyment in life appears to be the times when she's criticizing everything and anyone. All of her employees and co-workers fear her and she is constantly talked about when she's not around. Her stern and harsh nature has earned her the nickname 'witch' When it comes to romance she is hopeless. No matter how many blind dates she has, not one has ever led to a second. The reason for this is her negativity and her inability to loosen up and express herself. She is, however, completely oblivious of her faults and cannot comprehend why she is so bad when it comes to love. Chae Mu-Ryong (Jae Hee) is an aspiring chef with a passion for French cuisine. He has an innate ability when it comes to taste and perfection. Every piece of food and every plate he prepares must be perfect. However this tends to get him into a lot of trouble because when working in a kitchen every moment counts and there is not possibly enough time to take so much care in preparation and decoration of meals. His criticism of a head chef's cooking causes him to lose his job. His parents have never really approved of his aspirations and dreams to be a famous chef and insist he return to medical school. He decides to enroll back into medical school but changes his mind at the last minute and decides not to. Mu-Ryong discusses everything with his best friend and ends up going on a blind date to pretend to be someone else who backed out at the last minute. He declines at first since he already has a girlfriend, but his friend offers him money, and warns him however that the woman he will be meeting is rather different. The woman he meets is Yoo Hee, and while under normal circumstances she would be rude, brash and boring, she tries to be nice and happy in an attempt to succeed on the date. However, her pretending is not very convincing and Mu-Ryong figures that it would be a matter of time before she loses it. The date ends when Mu-Ryong falls asleep for a moment, resulting in Yoo Hee throwing a glass of water at his face and calling him rude. He retorts back to her also, telling her to take care of her appearance the next time she goes on a blind date. The two then leave on bad terms. While delivering food from his father's Chinese restaurant, Mu-Ryong becomes involved in a car accident, coincidentally with Yoo Hee. They exchange insurance information and Yoo Hee learns that he lied to her on their date, realizing that he is 1 year younger than her, and that he met her only as a favor to a friend. Yoo Hee demands the money for the damage to her car to be paid within a week. However, Mu-Ryong doesn't have any money, and yet Yoo Hee is unwilling to compromise with him. He decides to use his school tuition, which was given to him by his parents, to pay for her car. However, he loses the money after being mugged on the way to pay her. Mu-Ryong tells Yoo Hee he doesn't have the money but is willing to work it off, no matter how long it takes or what he must do for her to pay her back. Yoo Hee decides that Mu-Ryong could repay her by working as her house keeper, since she continuously loses her previous keepers. Meanwhile, Mu- Ryongs girlfriend Seung Mi who works at her father's restaurant, is expecting a new head chef: Johnny Kruger (Dennis Oh), a world-renowned chef who also happens to be Mu-Ryong's idol and an acquaintance of Yoo Hee as well. Also her first love (Yoo Joon Ha) comes back from studying abroad and is now a renowned doctor. She sees him at a college reunion but is completely embarrassed when her friend (Sae Ra) pulls down her skirt and Yoo Hee is wearing Minnie Mouse boxers. As Moo Ryung is working as housekeeper he realizes that Yoo Hee has not been on dates for a while and is continuously being rejected on her blind dates. One night while drinking Moo Ryung doesn't understand why Yoo Hee get so upset when she's dumped when she shows up on dinner dates dressed like a spy. She then challenges him to fix her love life and if he is successful she will forget about the debt. He agrees. They agree to a contract. He begins by changing her entire wardrobe then her cold manner. He repeats in his lessons, \\"smile\\", \\"be kind and gentle\\" and \\"be polite\\". She gradually changes but completely blows a good date when she flips him on his back for putting his hands on her hip in an effort to keep her from falling. She tries to be more feminine and gets much better response from men but she realizes finding love is easier said than done. She asks him if he can continue to be her pretend boyfriend unless he can find her a lover. He again agrees but thinks Johnny could be the possible candidate. Yoo Hee continues to take the dating tips and Moo Ryung continues to be her pretend boyfriend, but since Moo Ryung already has a girlfriend(Seung Mi) there are a lot of misunderstandings. Seung Mi is uncomfortable with him living in Yoo Hee's house: part jealousy and pride and part insecurities. Yoo Hee also continues to fall in love with her first love, who is engaged. She keeps her distance until Sae Ra tells her he broke off the engagement. Joon Ha invites her to dinner where Yoo Hee's feelings for him grow. She invites him to a drink and she asks if they can date but he walks out on her because he has made a deal with her father, just like before. Yoo Hee's father made a deal with Joon Ha when Yoo Hee and him were both in college. If Joon Ha stop seeing his daughter he would fund Joon Ha's studies abroad. Feeling for each other(Yoo Hee and Joon Ha) grow deeper, but soon she learns that Joon Ha only loves her because of her father and his financial gains from the relationship. She leaves him on the altar and runs away to the country, but they are found by Yoo Hee's manager. She returns to her father, but confesses her love for Moo Ryung. For some period they seem to have a good and honest relationship. It's romantic and sweet. Moo Ryung tells her often how much he loves her unlike Joon Ha who thinks saying \\"love you\\" is childish. He continuously interrupts the relationship by wanting to see Yoo Hee. He threatens Moo Ryung while Yoo Hee's father ruins his own daughter by destroying her advertising company and cancelling her credit cards. Because of the constant phone calls and run ins, she ultimately meet with Joon Ha. He tells her that he loves her, but she's disgusted and leaves because she know it's a lie. He ends up getting into an \\"accident\\" and can never use his hand again: meaning the end of his career as a surgeon. She then leaves Moo Ryung and goes to his bedside. The engagement and wedding is back on even though it is clear that she does not love him nor does he. In celebration they (Joon Ha, Yoo Hee, and Yoo Hee's father) go to lunch. Joon Ha could not pick up his knife to cut because of his hand so Yoo Hee cuts for him. Then she gets a call from Johnny. She leaves the table to answer it. Johnny tells her that he's leaving for New York the next day and that Moo Ryung is going too. She hangs up but is devastated. She hears her father from behind the curtain telling Joon Ha to give up the hospital before Yoo Hee gets suspicious and to not mess up this time. Joon Ha has no objection but grabs the cup of water with his \\"broken hand\\". Yoo Hee goes to the hospital the next day to confirm what she saw at the restaurant. She sees Joon Ha walking across the hall ready to go do a surgery. His cast is gone and his hand is fine. She catches him and her father both in a lie together. She walks away disgusted but her father has a heart attack and decides to stay. Moo Ryung is at the airport with Johnny waiting, wishing that Yoo Hee comes to see him. When Yoo Hee's father wakes up he is embarrassed by what he has done and tells her to leave. Then Joon Ha waiting outside the door and tries to make one last attempt to make her stay with him but she tells that she has to see Moo Ryung and he offers her a ride. She meets Moo Ryung. He did not get on the plane because of her and they embrace and kiss.

The abdomen is raised until its tip points at the sun, minimizing the surface area exposed to solar radiation. When the sun is close to directly overhead, the vertical alignment of the insect's body suggests an obelisk. Function and occurrence Dragonflies may also raise their abdomens for other reasons. For instance, male Blue Dashers (Pachydiplax longipennis) assume an obelisk-like posture while guarding their territories or during conflicts with other males, displaying the blue pruinescence on their abdomens to best advantage.Corbet, 285-287.Clifford, 192-193. However, both females and males will raise their abdomens at high temperature and lower them again if shaded. This behavior can be demonstrated in the laboratory by heating captive Blue Dashers with a 250 watt lamp, and has been shown to be effective in stopping or slowing the rise in their body temperature. Halloween-pennant-obelisk.jpgCelithemis eponina in the obelisk posture Dropwing (Trithemis selika) young male obelisk composite.jpgyoung male T. selika moving into obelisk posture Pachydiplax longipennis Blue Dasher 1500px.jpgBlue Dasher: a raised abdomen may be either a response to heat or a threat display The obelisk posture has been observed in about 30 species in the Demoiselle, Clubtail, and Skimmer families. All are \\"perchers\\"‚Äîsit-and-wait predators that fly up from a perch to take prey and perch again to eat it. Since they spend most of their time stationary, perchers have the most opportunity to thermoregulate by adjusting their position. Other forms of postural thermoregulation When the sun is low but the air is still hot, dragonflies may adopt a modified obelisk position with the abdomen only partially raised.May, 5-7. Some species, including the Dragonhunter (Hagenius brevistylus), reduce exposure to the sun by perching with the abdomen pointed downward, rather than upward. The tropical skimmer dragonfly Diastatops intensa, whose wings are mostly black, points its wings rather than its abdomen at the sun, apparently to reduce the heat they absorb. While flying, some Saddlebags Gliders (genus Tramea) lower their abdomens into the shade provided by dark patches at the bases of their hindwings. The same behavior has been observed in Pseudothemis zonata, which has a similar hindwing patch. Dragonflies also use postural thermoregulation to increase body temperature. Keeping the flight muscles in the thorax warm is especially important, since otherwise the insect cannot fly. Dragonflies may position their wings to reflect sun onto themselves, or, if they are perched on a warm surface, to form a \\"greenhouse\\" over the thorax. When the sun is low in the sky, they may raise or lower their abdomens so that their bodies are perpendicular to the sun's rays, maximizing the surface area that receives direct sun; although this can resemble the obelisk posture, the purpose is opposite.

His publisher attributes inspiration for many of his books to \\"the world's mythologies\\". The Iron Ring, About the Author, p. [285]. Plot The narrative is 36 chapters in four parts. = Part I: The Iron Ring = Tamar, the king of the fictional realm of Sundari, is rudely awoken by the procession of a passing maharajah named Jaya. Jaya, disobeying the unwritten rules of courtesy, intrudes upon Tamar's house demanding an audience with Tamar for Jaya's own amusement. They play a fictional dice game called aksha, increasing the wagers placed on each successive roll. Finally Jaya calls the wager \\"life against life.\\" Tamar loses the roll; therefore, his life is Jaya's to do with as Jaya sees fit. Jaya places a black iron ring on Tamar's finger as a sign of his bondage. Jaya says that he has pressing matters to which to attend, so Tamar should come to Jaya's palace in Mahapura. Furious and screaming, Tamar lunges for the king, but because of the ring, he falls to the ground. Tamar is woken by his sage mentor Rajaswami, a brahmana, and quickly discovers that none of his courtiers remember Jaya's ever having been there at all. He has no proof, save the iron ring on his finger, that the encounter was any more than a dream. As a kshatriya, Tamar is honor-bound to make good on the debt he owes to Jaya because to him, dharma is the most important thing in the world. He sets out with Rajaswami, leaving his kingdom in the hands of his military commander, Darshan. The pair ride north through the Danda-Vana forest. They happen upon an enormous talking monkey being attacked by a large river-snake. The monkey, Hashkat, king of the monkeys, has attempted to steal the sapphire atop the head of the snake prince Shesha. Tamar wrestles Shesha in the water and is dragged under then saves Shesha from the weeds in which the serpent is entangled. Shesha pulls Tamar to the realm of the Naga Raja (snake king), where Tamar is given his choice of any of the thousands of precious jewels within the king's hall. He chooses a tiny ruby called the Fire Flower. When Tamar surfaces, he is no longer in the part of the river whence he had left Rajaswami. Instead he is standing naked before a group of beautiful cowgirls called gopis. The most beautiful, Mirri, brings Tamar clothing out of pity, and Tamar is told eventually of the village's traditional \\"Choosing,\\" where young men compete in games of strength and skill for maidens' affections. Mirri has until this point elected not to take part in the Choosing, but when Tamar arrives, she announces she will choose a man. Rajaswami, after finding Tamar, reminds him that he should never challenge a lesser opponent; therefore, they leave at first light without Tamar being part of the Choosing. On the road through the forest, they reunite with Hashkat and are saved by Mirri when she discovers them stuck in thornbushes' cement-like sap. Mirri joins the party and travels north. Another companion is found in Garuda, a pessimistic eagle whose nests Tamar has accidentally destroyed twice. Garuda was once the messenger of a King Jaya whose job it was to retrieve a ruby with a lotus carved on it. This is the same jewel Tamar carries! Garuda agrees to come with the group to look after the ruby because he is in no shape to fly well (he is referred to as a buzzard before his true species is known). They continue north to a clearing where they meet Kana, a ruthless general of the kingdom of Ranapura who obeys no code of conduct. He and his men set upon Tamar in an unfair matchup, but the group is saved by Ashwara, exiled king of Ranapura. Ashwara tells how his cousin Nahusha has usurped the throne and exiled Ashwara and his brothers. Suddenly a suta (royal crier) named Adi-Kavi emerges from an anthill and joins the party. They decide to travel north to Muktara to plead with the king, Bala, for intervention. Tamar declares that this mission is more important than his mission to Mahapura because treachery is a matter of supreme dishonor. = Part II: In The Forest = The party arrives in Muktara to engage in durbar with King Bala, only to find that Nahusha is already there. There is nearly a violent confrontation between Ashwara and Nahusha before Bala restores order to the durbar. Nahusha is a hateful man with no respect for anyone save himself, not even for the revered brahmana. He reveals that one of Hashkat's faithful subjects, Akka, has been captured and cruelly enslaved for Nahusha's amusement. Finally Bala reaches the decision that he will take neither side in the struggle, giving neither military support to Nahusha nor protection to Ashwara. They leave the city cautiously, as Bala has warned Ashwara that Nahusha will only be unable to harm him inside Muktara, and are charged by a large talking elephant named Arvati, who ran into them while fleeing from her captors. Adi-Kavi has a plan for dealing with the approaching soldiers who are trying to recapture Arvati. He ties up Hashkat and paints him with mud. When the hunters arrive, Adi-Kavi claims that the elephant was actually a demonic rakshasa. He gets them to fall into a net trap to avoid being killed by the false demon. = Part III: Ranapura = = Part IV: Jaya = See also *Mythology *Indian epic poetry *Vedic mythology *Hindu mythology *Buddhist mythology  References  External links * Category:Novels by Lloyd Alexander Category:1997 American novels Category:Children's fantasy novels Category:American fantasy novels Category:American children's novels Category:Dutton Penguin books Category:1997 children's books ","title":"The Iron Ring"},{"id":"11807851","text":"Seii (Ë•øÂ®Å) (traditional dates: 1326 - 1349) was a legendary local ruler of Okinawa Island.

In an ongoing campaign to keep from being forced to live on reservations, Chiricahua Apache warriors led by Victorio attacked Fort Tularosa north of San Francisco Plaza. Buffalo Soldiers from the United States Army's 9th Cavalry, led by Sergeant George Jordan, repulsed the attack. Background On May 13, 1880, Sergeant George Jordan marched a detachment of twenty-five soldiers from K Troop of the 9th Cavalry towards New Mexico with orders to protect Fort Tularosa from potential attack, escort provisions, establish a supply depot and protect local settlers. Halfway through the march to the Fort, the detachment received word that Apaches under Victorio were probably striking the townspeople immediately. With this, Jordan asked each of the troops whether they were willing to march hard and fast to get to the action; with no question, every one of the men replied yes. On the morning of May 14, 1880, Sergeant Jordan arrived at Fort Tularosa. After the forced march the soldiers found the town intact without strike from the Apache forces. Jordan immediately had the troops sleep in shifts, in turn building a new fort to protect the townspeople and a new stockade for their animals.Field, R. (2004) Buffalo Soldiers: 1866-1891.

Battle Jordan recorded that \\"on the evening of the 14th, while I was standing outside the fort conversing with one of the citizens, the Indians came upon us unexpectedly and attacked.\\" As soon as the attack commenced, the town's occupants dashed to the fort and stockade.

Reilly (Dearborn Real Estate, 2000) [5th edition] p. 436 If it is covered in grass, it may be referred to as a front lawn. The area behind the house, usually more private, is the back yard or back garden. Yard and garden share an etymology and have overlapping meanings. Features While the front yard's counterpart, the backyard, is often dominated by utilitarian features like vegetable gardens, tool sheds, and clothes lines, the front yard is often a combination decorative feature and recreation area.The Spaces Between Buildings by Larry Ford (JHU Press, 2000) It is more commonly landscaped for display and is the usual place for display elements such as garden gnomes,Folklore 115:1, April 2004, front-page photograph of a front garden display of garden gnomes in Llanberis, North Wales plastic flamingos,The Flamingo in the Garden: American Yard Art and the Vernacular Landscape by Colleen J.

Depending on climate, local planning regulations or size, a front yard may feature a lawn or grassed area, a driveway or footpath or both and gardens or a vegetable patch or potted plants. History and styles =Australia= The fenced front yard of a house in Brewarrina, Australia, with an Australiana painted-tyre-swan lawn ornament. The history of the Australian front yard is said to have begun with a regulation enacted in New South Wales in 1829 mandating that new houses be built at least 14 feet from the street to ensure adequate space in front of each house for a garden.The Front Garden: The Story of the Cottage Garden in Australia by Victor Crittenden (Mulini Press, 1979) By the early 1900s, the front yard had become an accepted, \\"buffer between the private home and the public street\\". Australians adopted the American ideal of front yards without fences to create \\"park-like\\" streets and suburb-wide efforts were undertaken to remove fences and thereby encourage good neighbourly relationships and discourage anti-social behaviour and crime.A History of European Housing in Australia by Patrick Troy (Cambridge University Press, 2000) Daceyville in Sydney was the first suburb where fencing was systematically removed and soon public housing organisations in other states followed the trend. Some even encouraged front yard beautification by running competitions with cash prizes. During the construction of Australia's planned capital, Canberra, (in the late 1920s) the Federal Capital Commission provided government subsidies to encourage new residents to regularly maintain their front yards. By the 1950s, there was a clear delineation between front and back yards. There was also, by then, a very clear street-view approach to garden design with the house fa√ßade and front yard considered in unison; to \\"view the whole effect from the street\\".Australia's quarter acre: the story of the ordinary suburban garden by Peter Timms (Miegunyah Press, 2006) =Canada= A 1970s-built home with cedar panelling and a front yard with a large section of lawn and a tall-tree border in Richmond, British Columbia. The development and history of Canadian front yards generally followed early American trends but diverged in the early 1900s. In the 1920s and 30s, zoning laws were introduced for growing cities like Ottawa and Vancouver. The regulations stipulated minimum front yard \\"depth\\" for new houses and ensured home builders shunned the \\"tenement house evil\\" of New York City and London.Canadian City: Essays in Urban and Social History by Gilbert Stelter, Alan Fran√ßis Joseph Artibise (McGill-Queen's University Press, 1984) In many parts of Canada, lower average temperatures and a more pronounced want for privacy led to the increased popularity of tall trees at the side borders of housing blocks, framing the house and front yard. These provided wind breaks in winter and shade in the summer.A History of Domestic Space: Privacy and the Canadian Home by Peter Ward (UBC Press, 1999) Lawn ornaments were less common in pre and post-war Canada than in the United States and a large well-kept tract of \\"featureless\\" lawn was popular with many middle-class Canadians. In the post-war era, suburban Canada gained its own distinctive architectural styles and this extended to front yards and gardens. Rather than the stark white fa√ßades of stately American houses, wealthy Canadians of the 60s and 70s showed a preference for wood, in particular \\"diagonal cedar panelling\\". To match that trend, front yards of such houses were often paved to match the entrances of modern city buildings; \\"no elite home of the 1970s was complete without a front yard of interlocking brick\\".The Canadian Home: From Cave to Electronic Cocoon by Marc Denhez (Dundurn, 1994) As in other cultures, Canadian front yards became areas of socialisation between the public street and the private home; a space for street parties, family barbecues and neighbourly conversation. =Europe= Danish island of Bornholm. In many parts of Europe, the space in question is referred to as a front garden. The earliest form of front garden was the open courtyard popular with Spanish and Italian nobility. As housing evolved, so too did gardens and fa√ßades. Enclosed courtyards were surpassed in popularity by the large manicured gardens of French, German and Dutch palaces and stately homes. These traditions were carried by the Europeans to the Americas where courtyards remained popular among Spanish settlers in Florida while productive cottage gardens became commonplace among Dutch settlers and English pilgrims in Massachusetts.The Front Garden: New Approaches to Landscape Design by Mary Riley Smith (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2001) As suburbs developed around major European cities, the attitude to privacy, and by extension to front gardens, was decidedly different from that of the British. As one Dutch commentator highlighted (in the 1950s):Informalization: Manners and Emotions Since 1890 by Cas Wouters (SAGE, 2007) In older cities and townships (with houses built several centuries earlier) front gardens are far less common, with front doors providing residents with access direct to the street. In these cases, planter boxes and micro-gardens have become popular as a way of \\"greening\\" fa√ßades that would otherwise be without plants; elements that make a, \\"significant contribution to the quality of the environment\\".Home zones: a planning and design handbook by Mike Biddulph (The Policy Press, 2001) =United Kingdom= The densely planted front gardens of terrace cottages in Norfolk, England. In British English, the space in question is referred to as a front garden. Urban housing in the United Kingdom originally had no separation between the house front and the street. The introduction of the byelaw terraced house, a type of dwelling built to comply with the Public Health Act 1875, raised the standards of accommodation. The provision of a front garden in new houses became common practice during the second half of the 19th century as part of the Domestic Revival style within Victorian architecture: \\"to provide for the majority of new, even fairly modest, houses, a small front garden or paved forecourt, and a garden or yard at the back\\".The Edwardian House: The Middle-class Home in Britain, 1880‚Äì1914 by Helen Long (Manchester University Press, 1993)The English Terraced House by Stefan Muthesius (Yale University Press, 1982), pp. 247-78. Front gardens were \\"commonplace\\" for new residences by the 1870s.City Trees: A Historical Geography from the Renaissance Through the Nineteenth Century by Henry W. Lawrence (University of Virginia Press, 2008) The front garden was \\"largely ornamental\\" and initially more important than the back, which was sometimes eliminated to allow more space for service areas.Muthesius, pp. 77, 144. A fairly standard layout was adopted with a stone or brick wall to emulate the \\"grandeur of approach and walled privacy of large houses\\" and a straight path from the gate to the front door. Early in the 20th century, housing developments influenced by the garden city movement, initiated by Ebenezer Howard in 1898, featured detached houses with undivided \\"communal grass areas\\" in front of them.Britain's New Towns: Garden Cities to Sustainable Communities by Anthony Alexander (Routledge, 2009) In essence, the houses shared a front garden. However, outside these developments the dominant form of new housing in the United Kingdom until after World War II, especially in London, was the semi-detached, which superseded the previous dominant terraced house and where a garden was part of the ideal.Semi-Detached London: Suburban Development, Life and Transport, 1900-39 by Alan A. Jackson (George Allen & Unwin, 1973) pp. 149-50. The front garden, smaller than the back, was separated from the street by a lower wall than in the Victorian house; some developers planted hedges and provided instructions on their care.Jackson, pp. 128, 150. Gardening was a widely shared hobby and source of pride; developers sometimes prepared the front garden (almost never the back) as an inducement to buy, and sometimes held contests for the best front garden.Jackson, p. 211. However, since the houses were not always provided with garages, as motor vehicles became more common, the front garden was increasingly often used as a car parking area or enclosed by a garage. During the Great Depression, local authorities encouraged families to grow produce in their own front gardens, thereby increasing community food supplies. Gardening was introduced in some schools, and towns introduced competitions and awards for attractive and productive front gardens.Working Class Cultures in Britain, 1890‚Äì1960: Gender, Class and Ethnicity by Joanna Bourke (Routledge, 2002) (See Dig for victory.) In the post-war era of the 1950s and 60s, many of those front garden areas used for parking were paved over and became mini-driveways. This trend also became more common as professional gardeners became less common, thus increasing the need for home owners to maintain what was often a very small section of lawn or planted garden.This is Britain by Coralyn Bradshaw (Taylor & Francis, 1962) =United States= The front yard of the 1909-built, Greene and Greene-designed Spinks house, California. As residential areas were subdivided and developed during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the \\"suburban ideal\\" demanded large front yards, \\"dominated\\" by the facades of the houses they bounded. The size of new front yards gradually decreased during the second half of the 20th century as houses were built closer and closer to the front of housing blocks. In the 1870s, lawn ornaments became a popular front yard feature, with wrought iron sculpture, bird baths and gazebos being particularly popular. Throughout the 1880s and 90s, wicker lawn furniture became popular before being replaced in the early 1900s by nursery rhyme character and animal ornaments.The guide to United States popular culture by Ray B. Browne & Pat Browne (BGSU Popular Press, 2001) [with Fred E. H. Schroeder] In the post-war period, kitsch ornaments including plastic flamingoes and garden gnomes became popular. During the 1930s a new American Style took hold, inspired by the architectural designs of Frank Lloyd Wright, Bernard Maybeck and Greene and Greene; \\"informality, naturalness, interlocking indoor-outdoor design, greatly reduced flower-beds, privacy for outdoor recreation and leisure...\\".Front yard America: the evolution and meanings of a vernacular domestic landscape by Fred E.H. Schroeder (BGSU Popular Press, 1993) Local ordinances determine what owners and residents can and can't do in their front yards. In recent times, sustainability enthusiasts and practitioners have attempted to use their front yards to grow organic produce, in violation of existing codes. In Orlando, Florida, for example, city codes set standards for front yard ground covering and prescribe lawns only. Residents there have received citations for breaching the code by growing vegetable gardens and are currently fighting to have the ordinances amended.The Battlefront in the Front Yard by Steven Kurtz (New York Times, 19 December 2012) The illegality of growing vegetables in the front yard first received public attention due to the Oak Park incident in 2011. The \\"Urban Farming Guidebook - Planning for the Business of Growing Food in BC‚Äôs Towns & Cities\\" provides an explanation to this recurring phenomenon \\"The Garden City model embraced food production and its systems as key elements of community design. However, the race to the single use zoned suburbs did not include food production as part of the design of suburbs....urban farming was excluded from our lists of permitted uses and such farming became non-conforming or simply illegal uses which, if they were lucky, avoided bylaw attention\\" Since the early 2000s, once-common front yard \\"accoutrements\\" (like basketball rings on garages) are becoming less common; many now prohibited by local government ordinances.

Written separately during the last decades of the composer's life and with different origins and purposes, they were nevertheless published together in 1898 by Casa Ricordi. They are often performed as a cycle, not in chronological sequence of their composition, but in the sequence used in the Ricordi publication: * Ave Maria, a setting of the Latin Ave Maria for four solo voices a cappella composed in 1889 * Stabat Mater, a setting of the Latin Stabat Mater for chorus and orchestra composed in 1896 and 1897 * Laudi alla Vergine Maria, a setting of a prayer in Canto XXXIII of Dante's Paradiso for four female voices a cappella composed between 1886 and 1888 * Te Deum, a setting of the Latin Te Deum for double chorus and orchestra composed in 1895 and 1896. They were first performed together (without the Ave Maria) in a concert by the Paris Opera on April 7, 1898.  History  After Verdi finished his opera Aida and in 1874 the Messa da Requiem, he retired from composing for years, writing only minor sacred compositions such as a Pater Noster and an Ave Maria in 1880. The earliest of the Quattro pezzi sacri in terms of its composition date is what came to be known as Laudi alla Vergine Maria (although Verdi himself did not give it that title). It was composed between 1886 and 1888, during which time he was also working on his penultimate opera, Otello, which premiered in 1887. The second of the Pezzi to be composed was the Ave Maria, whose setting is built on an enigmatic scale. He originally composed it in 1889 and revised it for publication in 1897. The Te Deum was begun in 1895 two years after the premiere of his last opera, Falstaff. It was finished in the summer of 1896. The Stabat Mater followed, and all four pieces were sent to Verdi's publisher, Casa Ricordi, in June 1897.  Music  At the end of his life Verdi returned to his beginnings as a church musician. He studied Bach's Mass in B minor and compositions by Palestrina, whose influence is apparent in the Laudi alla Vergine Maria. The publisher Schott gives the total performance time as 37 minutes.Four Sacred Pieces Schott. Retrieved 9 October 2013. = Ave Maria = Enigmatic scale on C, base for Verdi's Ave Maria Verdi was inspired in 1889 to compose Ave Maria by the enigmatic scale C ‚Äì D-flat ‚Äì E ‚Äì F-sharp ‚Äì G-sharp ‚Äì A-sharp ‚Äì B ‚Äì C which Adolfo Crescentini (1854‚Äì1921) had published in Ricordi's magazine Gazetta musicale di Milano, inviting composers to harmonise it. Verdi composed a setting for four unaccompanied voices, with the bass singing the scale first, followed by alto, tenor and soprano, whereas the three remaining voices supply harmonic texture. He commented: \\"An Ave Maria. It will be my fourth! Perhaps I shall be beatified by the Holy Father.\\" Verdi revised the work in June 1897 for the publication. The music publisher Schott renders the subtitle as \\"Scala enigmatica armonizzata a 4 voci miste\\" (Enigmatic scale harmonised for four mixed voices). It takes about six minutes to perform. = Stabat Mater = While Ave Maria is set for soloists, Verdi scored the Stabat Mater for a four-part mixed chorus (SATB) and a large orchestra of three flutes, two oboes, two clarinets. four bassoons, four horns, three trumpets, four trombones, percussion (timpani and bass drum), harp and strings. The work is through-composed, without repetition of text. It is full of chromaticism. Melodic parts, similar to arias, contrast with a cappella passages and dramatic outbursts. The music reaches a climax on the text \\"Paradisi gloria\\" (glory of paradise), then dies down in the lowest registers of the strings. A performance takes about 12 minutes. = Laudi alla Vergine Maria = Laudi alla Vergine Maria is another a cappella work, set for four solo female voices. It is based on a short prayer from in Canto XXXIII of Dantes's Paradiso, the third part of his Divina Commedia. Verdi alludes on the counterpoint of Renaissance music. Each stanza is introduced by a new motif. Biographer Budden describes the piece as \\"with the subtlest of harmonic and rhythmic inflexions, unashamedly modern in character\\". The audience requested a repetition when it was first performed. Publisher Schott renders the subtitle as \\"Tolte dall' ultimo canto del \\"Paradiso\\" di Dante per 4 voci feminili, sole\\" (Taken from the ultimate song of \\"Paradiso\\" by Dante for 4 female voices, solo). It takes about six minutes to perform. = Te Deum = The Ambrosian Hymn Te Deum is scored for two four-part choirs, a short soprano solo and large orchestra, adding cor anglais and bass clarinet to the orchestra of the Stabat Mater, but without harp. Verdi wrote to Giovanni Tebaldini, director of music in Padua: \\"It is usually sung during grand, solemn and noisy ceremonies for a victory or a coronation etc. ... Humanity believes in the Judex Venturus, invokes Him in the Salvum fac and ends with a prayer, 'Dignare Domine die isto', which is moving, melancholy and sad even to the point of terror.\\" The music begins with the Gregorian chant Te deum laudamus, te Dominum confitemur, continued responsorially by the whole male choir in unison. The full choir and orchestra enter in partly dramatic scenes, reminiscent of the Messa da Requiem, interspersed by Gregorian chant. The final line in te speravi is first rendered by a single soprano voice from the choir, representing the \\"[voice of] mankind\\", as Verdi requested. The line is repeated by the choir, followed by a reticent postlude, similar to the conclusion of the Requiem. A performance takes about 15 minutes. Verdi himself suggested 12 minutes.  Performances  Verdi did not want the Ave Maria to be performed with the other pieces. According to his wish, three pieces were first performed on 7 and 8 April 1898 at the Paris Opera as part of a concert series of the Soci√©t√© des Concerts du Conservatoire, conducted by Paul Taffanel (1844‚Äì1908). Verdi was not present, because he had suffered a mild stroke, but sent Arrigo Boito with several requests, partly in writing, for performance details. The first performance in Italy, again without the Ave Maria, was conducted in Turin on 26 May 1898 by Arturo Toscanini who had talked to Verdi. The first performance in Austria on 13 November 1898 in Vienna was conducted by Richard von Perger and included the Ave Maria, but the two a cappella works were performed by the choir, not by solo voices as Verdi had intended. Verdi liked the Te Deum best of the four works and reputedly wanted to be buried with the score.

GWASs typically focus on associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and traits like major human diseases, but can equally be applied to any other genetic variants and any other organisms. An illustration of a alt=Manhattan plot of a GWAS When applied to human data, GWA studies compare the DNA of participants having varying phenotypes for a particular trait or disease. These participants may be people with a disease (cases) and similar people without the disease (controls), or they may be people with different phenotypes for a particular trait, for example blood pressure. This approach is known as phenotype-first, in which the participants are classified first by their clinical manifestation(s), as opposed to genotype-first. Each person gives a sample of DNA, from which millions of genetic variants are read using SNP arrays. If one type of the variant (one allele) is more frequent in people with the disease, the variant is said to be associated with the disease. The associated SNPs are then considered to mark a region of the human genome that may influence the risk of disease. GWA studies investigate the entire genome, in contrast to methods that specifically test a small number of pre-specified genetic regions. Hence, GWAS is a non-candidate-driven approach, in contrast to gene- specific candidate-driven studies. GWA studies identify SNPs and other variants in DNA associated with a disease, but they cannot on their own specify which genes are causal. The first successful GWAS published in 2002 studied myocardial infarction. This study design was then implemented in the landmark GWA 2005 study investigating patients with age-related macular degeneration, and found two SNPs with significantly altered allele frequency compared to healthy controls. , over 3,000 human GWA studies have examined over 1,800 diseases and traits, and thousands of SNP associations have been found. Except in the case of rare genetic diseases, these associations are very weak, but while they may not explain much of the risk, they provide insight into genes and pathways that can be important. Background GWA studies typically identify common variants with small effect sizes (lower right). Any two human genomes differ in millions of different ways. There are small variations in the individual nucleotides of the genomes (SNPs) as well as many larger variations, such as deletions, insertions and copy number variations. Any of these may cause alterations in an individual's traits, or phenotype, which can be anything from disease risk to physical properties such as height. Around the year 2000, prior to the introduction of GWA studies, the primary method of investigation was through inheritance studies of genetic linkage in families. This approach had proven highly useful towards single gene disorders. However, for common and complex diseases the results of genetic linkage studies proved hard to reproduce. A suggested alternative to linkage studies was the genetic association study. This study type asks if the allele of a genetic variant is found more often than expected in individuals with the phenotype of interest (e.g. with the disease being studied). Early calculations on statistical power indicated that this approach could be better than linkage studies at detecting weak genetic effects. In addition to the conceptual framework several additional factors enabled the GWA studies. One was the advent of biobanks, which are repositories of human genetic material that greatly reduced the cost and difficulty of collecting sufficient numbers of biological specimens for study. Another was the International HapMap Project, which, from 2003 identified a majority of the common SNPs interrogated in a GWA study. The haploblock structure identified by HapMap project also allowed the focus on the subset of SNPs that would describe most of the variation. Also the development of the methods to genotype all these SNPs using genotyping arrays was an important prerequisite. Methods Example calculation illustrating the methodology of a case-control GWA study. The allele count of each measured SNP is evaluated‚Äîin this case with a chi- squared test‚Äîto identify variants associated with the trait in question. The numbers in this example are taken from a 2007 study of coronary artery disease (CAD) that showed that the individuals with the G-allele of SNP1 (rs1333049) were overrepresented amongst CAD-patients. The most common approach of GWA studies is the case-control setup, which compares two large groups of individuals, one healthy control group and one case group affected by a disease. All individuals in each group are genotyped for the majority of common known SNPs. The exact number of SNPs depends on the genotyping technology, but are typically one million or more. For each of these SNPs it is then investigated if the allele frequency is significantly altered between the case and the control group. In such setups, the fundamental unit for reporting effect sizes is the odds ratio. The odds ratio is the ratio of two odds, which in the context of GWA studies are the odds of case for individuals having a specific allele and the odds of case for individuals who do not have that same allele. As an example, suppose that there are two alleles, T and C. The number of individuals in the case group having allele T is represented by 'A' and the number of individuals in the control group having allele T is represented by 'B'. Similarly, the number of individuals in the case group having allele C is represented by 'X' and the number of individuals in the control group having allele C is represented by 'Y'. In this case the odds ratio for allele T is A:B (meaning 'A to B', in standard odds terminology) divided by X:Y, which in mathematical notation is simply (A/B)/(X/Y). When the allele frequency in the case group is much higher than in the control group, the odds ratio is higher than 1, and vice versa for lower allele frequency. Additionally, a P-value for the significance of the odds ratio is typically calculated using a simple chi-squared test. Finding odds ratios that are significantly different from 1 is the objective of the GWA study because this shows that a SNP is associated with disease. Because so many variants are tested, it is standard practice to require the p-value to be lower than to consider a variant significant. There are several variations to this case- control approach. A common alternative to case-control GWA studies is the analysis of quantitative phenotypic data, e.g. height or biomarker concentrations or even gene expression. Likewise, alternative statistics designed for dominance or recessive penetrance patterns can be used. Calculations are typically done using bioinformatics software such as SNPTEST and PLINK, which also include support for many of these alternative statistics. GWAS focuses on the effect of individual SNPs. However, it is also possible that complex interactions among two or more SNPs, epistasis, might contribute to complex diseases. Due to the potentially exponential number of interactions, detecting statistically significant interactions in GWAS data is both computationally and statistically challenging. This task has been tackled in existing publications that use algorithms inspired from data mining. Moreover, the researchers try to integrate GWA data with other biological data such as protein-protein interaction network to extract more informative results. A key step in the majority of GWA studies is the imputation of genotypes at SNPs not on the genotype chip used in the study. This process greatly increases the number of SNPs that can be tested for association, increases the power of the study, and facilitates meta-analysis of GWAS across distinct cohorts. Genotype imputation is carried out by statistical methods that combine the GWAS data together with a reference panel of haplotypes. These methods take advantage of sharing of haplotypes between individuals over short stretches of sequence to impute alleles. Existing software packages for genotype imputation include IMPUTE2, Minimac, Beagle and MaCH. In addition to the calculation of association, it is common to take into account any variables that could potentially confound the results. Sex and age are common examples of confounding variables. Moreover, it is also known that many genetic variations are associated with the geographical and historical populations in which the mutations first arose. Because of this association, studies must take account of the geographic and ethnic background of participants by controlling for what is called population stratification. If they fail to do so, these studies can produce false positive results. After odds ratios and P-values have been calculated for all SNPs, a common approach is to create a Manhattan plot. In the context of GWA studies, this plot shows the negative logarithm of the P-value as a function of genomic location. Thus the SNPs with the most significant association stand out on the plot, usually as stacks of points because of haploblock structure. Importantly, the P-value threshold for significance is corrected for multiple testing issues. The exact threshold varies by study, but the conventional threshold is to be significant in the face of hundreds of thousands to millions of tested SNPs. GWA studies typically perform the first analysis in a discovery cohort, followed by validation of the most significant SNPs in an independent validation cohort. Results Regional association plot, showing individual SNPs in the LDL receptor region and their association to LDL-cholesterol levels. This type of plot is similar to the Manhattan plot in the lead section, but for a more limited section of the genome. The haploblock structure is visualized with colour scale and the association level is given by the left Y-axis. The dot representing the rs73015013 SNP (in the top-middle) has a high Y-axis location because this SNP explains some of the variation in LDL-cholesterol. Attempts have been made at creating comprehensive catalogues of SNPs that have been identified from GWA studies. As of 2009, SNPs associated with diseases are numbered in the thousands. The first GWA study, conducted in 2005, compared 96 patients with age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) with 50 healthy controls. It identified two SNPs with significantly altered allele frequency between the two groups. These SNPs were located in the gene encoding complement factor H, which was an unexpected finding in the research of ARMD. The findings from these first GWA studies have subsequently prompted further functional research towards therapeutical manipulation of the complement system in ARMD. Another landmark publication in the history of GWA studies was the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) study, the largest GWA study ever conducted at the time of its publication in 2007. The WTCCC included 14,000 cases of seven common diseases (~2,000 individuals for each of coronary heart disease, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, bipolar disorder, and hypertension) and 3,000 shared controls. This study was successful in uncovering many new disease genes underlying these diseases. Since these first landmark GWA studies, there have been two general trends. One has been towards larger and larger sample sizes. In 2018, several genome-wide association studies are reaching a total sample size of over 1 million participants, including 1.1 million in a genome- wide study of educational attainment and a study of insomnia containing 1.3 million individuals. The reason is the drive towards reliably detecting risk- SNPs that have smaller odds ratios and lower allele frequency. Another trend has been towards the use of more narrowly defined phenotypes, such as blood lipids, proinsulin or similar biomarkers. These are called intermediate phenotypes, and their analyses may be of value to functional research into biomarkers. A variation of GWAS uses participants that are first-degree relatives of people with a disease. This type of study has been named genome- wide association study by proxy (GWAX). A central point of debate on GWA studies has been that most of the SNP variations found by GWA studies are associated with only a small increased risk of the disease, and have only a small predictive value. The median odds ratio is 1.33 per risk-SNP, with only a few showing odds ratios above 3.0. These magnitudes are considered small because they do not explain much of the heritable variation. This heritable variation is estimated from heritability studies based on monozygotic twins. For example, it is known that 80-90% of variance in height can be explained by hereditary differences, but GWA studies only account for a minority of this variance. Clinical applications A challenge for future successful GWA study is to apply the findings in a way that accelerates drug and diagnostics development, including better integration of genetic studies into the drug- development process and a focus on the role of genetic variation in maintaining health as a blueprint for designing new drugs and diagnostics. Several studies have looked into the use of risk-SNP markers as a means of directly improving the accuracy of prognosis. Some have found that the accuracy of prognosis improves, while others report only minor benefits from this use. Generally, a problem with this direct approach is the small magnitudes of the effects observed. A small effect ultimately translates into a poor separation of cases and controls and thus only a small improvement of prognosis accuracy. An alternative application is therefore the potential for GWA studies to elucidate pathophysiology. One such success is related to identifying the genetic variant associated with response to anti-hepatitis C virus treatment. For genotype 1 hepatitis C treated with Pegylated interferon- alpha-2a or Pegylated interferon-alpha-2b combined with ribavirin, a GWA study has shown that SNPs near the human IL28B gene, encoding interferon lambda 3, are associated with significant differences in response to the treatment. A later report demonstrated that the same genetic variants are also associated with the natural clearance of the genotype 1 hepatitis C virus. These major findings facilitated the development of personalized medicine and allowed physicians to customize medical decisions based on the patient's genotype. The goal of elucidating pathophysiology has also led to increased interest in the association between risk-SNPs and the gene expression of nearby genes, the so- called expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies. The reason is that GWAS studies identify risk-SNPs, but not risk-genes, and specification of genes is one step closer towards actionable drug targets. As a result, major GWA studies by 2011 typically included extensive eQTL analysis. One of the strongest eQTL effects observed for a GWA-identified risk SNP is the SORT1 locus. Functional follow up studies of this locus using small interfering RNA and gene knock-out mice have shed light on the metabolism of low-density lipoproteins, which have important clinical implications for cardiovascular disease. = Atrial fibrillation = For example, a meta-analysis accomplished in 2018 revealed the discovery of 70 new loci associated with atrial fibrillation. It has been identified different variants associated with transcription factor coding-genes, such as TBX3 and TBX5, NKX2-5 o PITX2, which are involved in cardiac conduction regulation, in ionic channel modulation and cardiac development. It was also identified new genes involved in tachycardia (CASQ2) or associated with alteration of cardiac muscle cell communication (PKP2). = Schizophrenia = While there is some research using a High-Precision Protein Interaction Prediction (HiPPIP) computational model that discovered 504 new protein-protein interactions (PPIs) associated with genes linked to schizophrenia, the evidence supporting the genetic basis of schizophrenia is actually controversial and may suffer from some of the limitation of this method of study. Limitations GWA studies have several issues and limitations that can be taken care of through proper quality control and study setup. Lack of well defined case and control groups, insufficient sample size, control for multiple testing and control for population stratification are common problems. Particularly the statistical issue of multiple testing wherein it has been noted that \\"the GWA approach can be problematic because the massive number of statistical tests performed presents an unprecedented potential for false-positive results\\". Ignoring these correctible issues has been cited as contributing to a general sense of problems with the GWA methodology. In addition to easily correctible problems such as these, some more subtle but important issues have surfaced. A high- profile GWA study that investigated individuals with very long life spans to identify SNPs associated with longevity is an example of this. The publication came under scrutiny because of a discrepancy between the type of genotyping array in the case and control group, which caused several SNPs to be falsely highlighted as associated with longevity. The study was subsequently retracted, but a modified manuscript was later published. In addition to these preventable issues, GWA studies have attracted more fundamental criticism, mainly because of their assumption that common genetic variation plays a large role in explaining the heritable variation of common disease. Indeed, it has been estimated that for most conditions the SNP heritability attributable to common SNPs is <0.05. This aspect of GWA studies has attracted the criticism that, although it could not have been known prospectively, GWA studies were ultimately not worth the expenditure. GWA studies also face criticism that the broad variation of individual responses or compensatory mechanisms to a disease state cancel out and mask potential genes or causal variants associated with the disease. Additionally, GWA studies identify candidate risk variants for the population from which their analysis is performed, and with most GWA studies stemming from European databases, there is a lack of translation of the identified risk variants to other non-European populations. Alternative strategies suggested involve linkage analysis. More recently, the rapidly decreasing price of complete genome sequencing have also provided a realistic alternative to genotyping array-based GWA studies. It can be discussed if the use of this new technique is still referred to as a GWA study, but high-throughput sequencing does have potential to side-step some of the shortcomings of non-sequencing GWA. Fine-mapping Genotyping arrays designed for GWAS rely on linkage disequilibrium to provide coverage of the entire genome by genotyping a subset of variants. Because of this, the reported associated variants are unlikely to be the actual causal variants. Associated regions can contain hundreds of variants spanning large regions and encompassing many different genes, making the biological interpretation of GWAS loci more difficult. Fine-mapping is a process to refine these lists of associated variants to a credible set most likely to include the causal variant. Fine-mapping requires all variants in the associated region to have been genotyped or imputed (dense coverage), very stringent quality control resulting in high-quality genotypes, and large sample sizes sufficient in separating out highly correlated signals. There are several different methods to perform fine-mapping, and all methods produce a posterior probability that a variant in that locus is causal. Because the requirements are often difficult to satisfy, there are still limited examples of these methods being more generally applied.

Early life  Emanuel Aloys F√∂rster was born in Niedersteine bei Glatz, County of Glatz (Kingdom of Prussia). Almost nothing is known of his family or parents except that his father was an administrator in an economics office. From his early youth, Emanuel composed several concertos and many sonatas purely from his correct musical ear. He acquired only later a copy of a theoretical work by Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach (probably Versuch √ºber die wahre Art das Klavier zu spielen, \\"Essay on the true art of keyboard playing\\"), which he copied out. When he had left school he went to work for some years in his father's office, and then he was called up into the Prussian army and spent the last two years of the Seven Years' War as an oboist in the \\"Fouquet'schen Regiment\\". After that (around 1763) he went to Mittelwalde where he lived in the intimate circle of, and studied with, the (at that time) famous organist Johann Georg Pausewang. Probably through his agency, F√∂rster went to Prague from 1776‚Äì79, after which he settled in Vienna, where he worked as a composer and music teacher. Through his marriage to Eleonore von Reczka, he developed contacts to the Viennese aristocracy, which furthered his reputation. In Vienna, he became friends with Mozart and Haydn, while his students included Louis Niedermeyer and Franz Pech√°ƒçek. Through Prince Karl Lichnowsky, he met Ludwig van Beethoven; the composer, 22 years his junior, appreciated his talents and recommended students to him, including Andreas Rasumofsky and Charles Neate. F√∂rster's compositions were often played, along with those of Beethoven and Haydn, by the legendary Schuppanzigh Quartet. In addition to his compositions, he wrote an \\"Introduction to the Figured Bass,\\" a treatise for composition students. F√∂rster and Eleonore had five children. Their daughter Eleonore (b. 1799) became a renowned pianist who herself composed variations for piano, violin, viola and cello; she married a Count Conti in 1823. Her brother Joseph, a year younger, was also a pianist and cellist. F√∂rster's daughter Michaelina married the violinist Pietro Rovelli (1793‚Äì1838).

I-177 was a KD7 subclass boat, commissioned on 28 December 1942 and sunk by on 3 October 1944, with no survivors.  War crimes  Following the end of the Pacific War, Australian war crimes investigators investigated whether the I-177 and its Commander Nakagawa were responsible for sinking the Australian Hospital Ship Centaur. The Centaur was torpedoed off the Australian east coast on 14 May 1943. The torpedo ignited a fuel tank, setting the ship ablaze. It rolled to port and sank within 3 minutes. Of the 332 crew, patients, medical staff, and passengers on board, 268 died ‚Äì only 64 were rescued. Commander Hajime Nakagawa survived the war because he had been transferred from the I-177 before it was sunk. Several of the investigators suspected that Nakagawa and I-177 were most likely responsible, but they were unable to establish this beyond reasonable doubt. However, Nakagawa was charged with ordering the machine-gunning of survivors from torpedoed ships on three different dates in February, 1944. He was convicted and sentenced to four years imprisonment at Sugamo Prison as a Class B war criminal.Jenkins, Battle Surface, pp. 284‚Äì5 Nakagawa refused to ever speak on the subject of the sinking of the Centaur, even to defend himself.

Michael Gear & Kathleen O'Neal Gear. The series, which began with 1990's People of the Wolf, explores various civilizations and cultures in prehistoric North America. It is comparable to Jean M. Auel's Earth's Children series, set in prehistoric Europe, but each of its books focuses on a different time period, location, and set of characters. The first four novels form a coherent, more or less linear narrative, from the initial migration of Siberian peoples into what is now Canada and Alaska (People of the Wolf) through the florescence of the Mississippian semi-urban mound-building culture, considered the \\"high-water mark\\" of North American pre-Columbian civilization, around 1000 AD. The remaining novels cover a wide variety of times and settings, most standalone stories in no particular order, ranging from tropical Florida in the 6th millennium BC to the Chaco Empire of the Southwest in the 13th century AD. The novels take into account new developments in North American archaeology such as the discovery of Kennewick Man and the development of the coastal-route model as a possible alternative or supplement to overland migration across Beringia. The novels generally have a prologue set in modern times, in which archaeologists or others discover ancient artifacts and other remnants of prehistoric North American civilization. The main body of the novel then details the individual lives of those who left the artifacts behind. Although generally well regarded for their accuracy and attention to detail (both of the writers are professional archaeologists) the novels usually contain mystic elements, focusing on shamanistic visions. Protagonists of early novels sometimes appear as dream guides or figures of legend in subsequent volumes. According to the author's website, future titles in the series will include novels dealing with the Pacific Northwest in British Columbia; the high cultures of the Southeast, including Moundville, Alabama, and the Etowah Indian Mounds, Georgia; the Hohokam in southern Arizona; the Mimbres in New Mexico; and the Salado in the Salt River basin.

Novels =People of the Wolf= People of the Wolf (), the first book in the series, the story explores the migration of humans into pre-historic North America. The plot concerns a man and woman contemplating having a child. Then a band of Siberian hunters pursues game across Beringia during the last Ice Age. Spurred by a vision he had while on a hunt, a young tribesman named Runs in Light, later called Wolf Dreamer, leads a handful of tribes people, in rebellion against the tribal shaman, south down the Yukon River valley into what is now Canada and the Pacific Northwest. =People of the Fire= People of the Fire (, 1991) dramatizes the transition of Native American culture from Paleo-Indian to Archaic as a result of climatic warming, set in the High Plains and Western Rockies region. It is the second book in North America's Forgotten Past series. Amid disastrous climate changes, the Red Hand and Short Buffalo tribes struggle for survival, and against each other. In order to survive in the changing world, they must change with it, but to do that, they need the guidance of a new Dreamer, and the Red Hand's sacred Wolf Bundle must be renewed. =People of the Sea= People of the Sea () dramatizes the initial development of the California Native American culture and the imminent extinction of mammoths and mastodons as a result of climatic warming ca. 8000 BC. It is the fifth book in the series. =People of the Lakes= People of the Lakes () is the sixth book in the series. The title is a reference to the location and type of natives portrayed in the book, following the naming convention set forth by previous books in the series. The book is set in the North American continent during the Iron Age (c. 100 CE) and follows the plight of a group of natives trying to save their clan from a great evil and avoid a rival clan. Clan fighting over a powerful totemic mask has brought the Mound Builder people of the Great Lakes region to the edge of destruction. It is up to Star Shell, daughter of a Hopewell chief, to rid her people of this curse. Along with her companions: Otter, a trader; Pearl, a runaway; and Green Spider, either prophet or madman, she braves the stormy waters of the lakes to reach the majestic waterfall known as Roaring Water. She is determined to banish the mask forever to a watery grave. But vengeful clan members are close on her heels, and they have a similar fate planned for her.

Until 2016 Lakeside was a \\"dry neighborhood\\". No alcohol was sold in store or available for purchase and restaurants. There were no laws against residents consuming alcohol in their own home or at private events. The ban was ended by popular vote in 2016. Historical structures Along the Lester River in the Lakeside‚ÄìLester Park neighborhood, are two structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places. They are: *Lester River Bridge‚ÄìBridge No. 5772 *Lester River Fish Hatchery: Built in 1882, the complex is located at the mouth of the Lester River. It is owned by University of Minnesota Duluth, and temporarily housed the Great Lakes Aquarium administrative offices at the beginning of the aquarium's operations. The complex consists of the Hatchery/Bunk-room Building, Boat House, Pump House, Supervisor's Cabin on the south side of Congdon Boulevard, and a Superintendent's House on the north side of Congdon Boulevard. Other historic structures include: * 5217 London Road. The house was originally built in 1889 at the former New London School, a four room schoolhouse located at Regent Street and 46th Avenue East. It was deconstructed in 1900, moved to its current location, and rebuilt as a house for Bradford C. Church, then President of the Imperial Milling Company in Duluth. Festival The Lester River Rendezvous festival takes place every September in the neighborhood. This annual event draws people from all over since 1998. It also is a time of neighborhood and community togetherness. The event is sponsored by the Lakeside‚ÄìLester Park Business Association and the Duluth Parks and Recreation Department. This fall tradition in Lester Park features food, crafts, and entertainment. A special feature of the Lester River Rendezvous is the Voyageur Village, where members play out the day in the life of a voyageurs camp from the late 18th century in northern Minnesota. This re-enactment by local residents includes dressing up as voyageurs in the fur trading era, demonstrating outdoor cooking techniques, as well as telling stories of their historic adventures. There are also games by the Duluth Children's Museum and pony rides. Musicians perform either at the park stage, strolling the park, or at the entrance gates.  Hawk Ridge  Located just above Lakeside, is Hawk Ridge, a popular place in the fall for \\"Hawk Watch\\", which many do all year round. It looks over lakeside towards Lake Superior, and if you travel down the road you will cross Seven Bridges road, taking a scenic way through Lakeside.

Introduced in July 1976, the XC was the first model to comply with the new pollution regulations specified under Australian Design Rule 27A. The response to the 1 July 1976, mandatory anti-pollution laws (ADR 27A), was to redevelop the Falcon six cylinder engines with a cross- flow head for greater efficiency. Visually, the XC Falcon was given a restyle treatment. The XC had a less aggressive nose which incorporated two round headlights on Falcon models and two rectangular headlights on Fairmont models. Ford also addressed the vision problems of the XA and XB by utilizing the rear doors from the contemporary model FAIRLANE which had the effect of removing the coke bottle look., along with installing an all-new dash and installing higher front seats. The preceding XA and XB series were the last model Falcons to use coke bottle styling. It was succeeded in 1979 by the XD Falcon which utilised similar styling to Ford's European GRANADA models. Total production of the XC range reached 171,082 vehicles Tony Davis, Aussie Cars, 1987, page 146 prior to the replacement of the XC by the XD Falcon in March 1979.Tony Davis, Aussie Cars, 1987, page 156  Model range  The XC Falcon range of passenger vehicles consisted of nine models:Ford Cars - All Model Catalogue May 1978, page 64 * Falcon Sedan * Falcon Wagon * Falcon 500 Sedan * Falcon 500 Wagon * Falcon GS Hardtop * Fairmont Sedan * Fairmont Wagon * Fairmont Hardtop * Fairmont GXL Sedan The Fairmont models were not badged or marketed as Falcons.
