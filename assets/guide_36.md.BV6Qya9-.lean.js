After the expiry of his sentence, he became the first ex- convict in Western Australia to be appointed a teacher. Life John Hislop was a clerk in the British Army before being sentenced to seven years transportation for an unknown crime. He arrived in Western Australia on board the Pyrenees in June 1851 and received his ticket of leave on arrival in the colony. In October 1853 he married Bridget Mulqueen, with whom he would have twelve children. Hislop was officially appointed the government schoolteacher at Bunbury in 1853, but it is said that he was already conducting the school before then. He ran the school for nine years, during which time he taught John and Alexander Forrest. He was considered a poor teacher by the Board of Education, which wrote that the \\"school had not progressed as satisfactorily as the Board would wish\\". In 1862, Hislop was charged with obtaining money by false pretences. He was acquitted, but still dismissed from his teaching post for \\"improper conduct\\". He then became the proprietor of the Wellington Hotel, and later a councillor. He died in Bunbury on 23 October 1909.

It is native to Australia, New Guinea, New Caledonia, and insular Southeast Asia.Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant FamiliesCooke, D. A. (1986). Patersonia. Flora of Australia 46: 13-26. Australian Government Publishing Service, Canberra. The genus name is a tribute to the first Lieutenant Governor of New South Wales in Australia, William Paterson. They are perennials with basal leaves growing from a woody rhizome that in some species extends above ground to form a short trunk. The leaves are tough and fibrous, often with adaptations for conserving moisture, such as stomata sunk in grooves, a thickened cross-section, marginal hairs, and thickened margins. The flowers appear from between a pair of bracts on a leafless stem. They have three large outer tepals that are usually blue to violet, and three tiny inner tepals. There are three stamens fused at the base to form a tube around the longer style, which bears a flattened stigma.Goldblatt, P. (2011). Systematics of Patersonia (Iridaceae, Patersonioideae) in the Malesian archipelago. Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden 98: 514-523. Several Patersonia species are grown as garden plants.

The Yukian languages may be, along with Chumashan and perhaps languages of southern Baja such as Waikuri, one of the oldest language families established in California, before the arrival of speakers of Penutian, Uto-Aztecan, and perhaps even Hokan languages. All three are spoken in areas with long- established populations of a distinct physical type.Golla, Victor. (2011). California Indian Languages. Berkeley: University of California Press. Family division The family consists of : 1. Yuki : 2. Wappo Yuki consisted of three dialects: Yuki, Coast Yuki, and Huchnom. Wappo was spoken in four dialects in the Napa Valley, with a fifth dialect spoken in an enclave on Clear Lake. Wappo and Yuki are quite divergent grammatically and lexically (Goddard 1996: 83), which has led to contested theories about their relationship. Additionally, the Wappo and Yuki people were quite distinct culturally and even in physical type (Goddard 1996: 83). The Yuki‚ÄìWappo languages appear to belong to the very earliest strata of languages in California, even predating Hokan (Goddard 1996: 84). Yuki is associated with the Mendocino Complex around Clear Lake (3000 BCE), while Wappo of the Napa Valley is associated with the St. Helena Aspect of the Augustine Pattern. Proto-Yukian peoples may be of the Post Pattern (9000 BCE). Some evidence suggests the two languages separated around 2000‚Äì1000 . Wappo speakers may have separated from Yuki due to migrations of Pomoan peoples. Alternatively, the Yuki and Wappo may have entered Northern California as distinct communities that settled in different areas, or Wappo speakers may have migrated south from the Yuki‚ÄìWappo heartland in the upper reaches of the Eel River. The Wappo migration to Alexander Valley in the 19th century was due to a war with the Southern Pomo. Genetic relations The relationship between Yuki and Wappo was contested by Jesse Sawyer who believes that the similarities are due to linguistic borrowing and shared areal features. However, William Elmendorf has presented some persuasive evidence in favor of the relationship, noting that they are as close as two branches of Indo- European. Campbell (1997) considers Elmendorf's evidence to be conclusive. Mithun (1999) reports that the relationship remains open to question, Golla (2011) that it is securely demonstrated. Yuki‚ÄìWappo has been linked to a number of hypothetical relationships: * under Penutian including a connection to Yokutsan and also to a California Penutian sub-group * under Hokan (including under Edward Sapir's Hokan‚ÄìSiouan) * connected to Siouan * in Morris Swadesh's Hokogian family with Hokan, Muskogean, and other Gulf languages, grouped together with Coahuiltecan and Chitimacha (and not with Hokan, pace Sapir) To date, none of these proposals have been successfully demonstrated.

In October 1999 Acclaim Entertainment released the Re-Volt Car Editor which allowed players to export and edit, or create new cars for the PC version using 3D studio. The editor was simply discovered in the Acclaim Studios London office and as such was released as an unapproved and unsupported piece of code. In early 2000, a sequel titled Re-Volt 2 was announced and later changed to RC Revenge, and was released in August 2000 for the PlayStation, followed by an enhanced port of the game a few months later called RC Revenge Pro for PlayStation 2. Ports and Re-releases =Xbox beta version= An Xbox version called Re-Volt Live was in development with a very limited beta version distributed to closed beta testers. This stripped- down version of Re-Volt was issued to beta testers of the Xbox Live service prior to the launch of the service on the original Xbox system, but much to the disappointment of fans - a more complete version was never released on the Microsoft console. The full game was cancelled close to being finished. Even though it was not officially released, the full development version is available and can be played on a modified Xbox that is capable of running games from a storage device. =Arcade version= In September 2004, a modified version of Re-Volt was released for the arcade machines by Tsunami Visual Technologies. This port of the game featured a few changes in gameplay and graphics. It ran on Microsoft Windows 98 and came in two versions: the TsuMo Standard Non-Motion Sit Down Re-Volt and a deluxe model. Similar to the Dreamcast version's Time Trial mode and many other arcade racers, there is a global timer. This version also featured additional tracks, among those the fan-made Venice by Gabor and a new track created by Kurt Arnlund, an ex- Tsunami employee. = Mobile device ports = In July 2010, WeGo Interactive Co., Ltd., located in Seoul, South Korea, purchased all IP related with Re- Volt, RC Revenge Pro, and RC de Go (developed and owned by Taito), from Toronto-based Throwback Entertainment. In July 2012, Re-Volt was announced for iOS and Android mobile platforms. In October 2012, Re-Volt was released for iOS as Re-Volt Classic. An Android version of the game was released on April 24, 2013 to the Korean T-Store and later to the Play Store. =PC re- release= On October 3, 2013, the PC version of Re-Volt was re-released through digital distribution on GOG.com.Release Re-Volt on GOG.com (October 3, 2013) The release was based on the community developed 1.2 Beta patch, with additional support for the original CD tracks as MP3 files. On January 14, 2014, the game was pulled on request from the developers of the 1.2 Beta patch due to a misunderstanding with publishers WeGo Interactive, in which the company used parts of the code written by the community without due consent.Do not buy Re-Volt on GOG (January 13, 2014)Re-Volt Has Been Pulled from GOG (January 14, 2014)Re-Volt temporarily de-listed on GOG.com (January 14, 2014) Legacy Although Acclaim Entertainment has been defunct since 2004, fans continued to support and extend the game by producing fan-made vehicles and courses, and by operating multiplayer servers. Fans have created an open- source, cross-platform chat/lobby client called \\"RV House\\" that allows players to connect and play online. This platform is directly interconnected to the website \\"Revolt Race\\", in which, among other features, a monthly set of tracks is chosen to serve as the base for time trialing. Additionally, more recently the community has set up a Discord channel that serves as the major hub to talk about the game, host, advertise and join races, share content/mods or even help develop new tools and updates for the game - which the latest iteration consists of RVGL, a cross-platform rewrite/port of Re-Volts source code that runs natively on both Windows and GNU/Linux. While new players may experience a significant learning curve, the community remains active with records of fastest laps and new courses and cars still being added. The fan- base have gone on to maintain the PC version with alpha and beta updates.Of All Things, Re-Volt Is Still Being Patched by Alex Walker on Kotaku (Oct 27, 2015) The game was also ported by the fan community to multiple platforms such as Linux, macOS, ODROID,Linux Gaming: RVGL ‚Äì Re-Volt on OpenGL on ODROID (2016) and OpenPandora based on the available source code.Downloads  Re-Volt I/O on re-volt.io (2017)  Reception  In the United States alone, Re-Volts computer version sold 16,528 copies during 1999. Upon its initial release, the Dreamcast and PC versions of Re-Volt received critical acclaim. Mark Clarkson of Computer Gaming World gave the game 4/5 stars praising the game's graphics and environments, and realistic RC-like handling, although noted that the in- game map editor was poor. Vincent Lopez of IGN gave the PC version an 8.8, praising the game's graphics, the gameplay and interface, but criticised the game's techno music and track editor. Rick Sanchez reviewed the PC version of the game for Next Generation, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"It's a fun romp, but if it had taken its toy inspiration over the top, this could have been excellent. Maybe in Re-Volt 2...\\" Jeremy Williams also reviewed the PC version of the game for Next Generation, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"Rumors to the contrary have been greatly exaggerated. Really, this is quite a good game. So there.\\" The editors of PC Gamer US awarded Re-Volt their 1999 \\"Best Racing Game\\" prize, and praised the game as \\"an exceptional balance of realism and arcade thrills\\". It received a special achievement prize for \\"Sleeper Hit of the Year\\" from Computer Gaming World, whose editors wrote that it \\"surprised the hell out of us when it was released this past Fall\\". Re-Volt was also nominated for Computer Gaming Worlds \\"Racing Game of the Year\\" award, but lost in this category to Need for Speed: High Stakes. It was also nominated for CNET Gamecenter's \\"Best Arcade Game\\" award, which went to Rayman 2: The Great Escape. Greg Orlando reviewed the Dreamcast version of the game for Next Generation, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"An excellent, albeit lighthearted, racing game, Re-Volt is best experienced with a group\\". Unlike the Dreamcast and PC versions, the PlayStation and N64 versions of Re-Volt were less positively received. Official PlayStation Magazine US gave the game a 40%, criticising the framerate and glitches. All Game Guide reviewed the Nintendo 64 version and gave it a 40%, criticising the poor frame rate and the large environments.

It is in the micro-region of the lower-middle S√£o Francisco River. This major river passes by the city where it is crossed by a recently constructed bridge. Ibotirama covers , and has a population of 27,405 with a population density of 16 inhabitants per square kilometer. The municipality lies along the S√£o Francisco River, a major inland water route and the fourth-longest river in Brazil. Geography Its area is and it is limited on the north by the municipality of Morpar√°, on the south with the municipality of Paratinga, on the east with the municipality of Oliveira dos Brejinhos and on the west with the municipality of Muqu√©m do S√£o Francisco. Ibotirama is crossed by Br-242, which connects Bras√≠lia to Salvador and Ba 162, connecting with Bom Jesus da Lapa. The distance between the city and the state capital is . The average distance between neighboring cities is 100 km. The average time taken to go from the villages to the municipal center is 20 with people coming by bus, automobile, truck, boat, cart, horse, bicycle, and on foot. Climate Ibotirama is hot and semi-arid with dry winds during the dry season becoming aggravated during the months of August and September. The rainy season is from November to March. In this season the climate is wet and hot, and feels uncomfortable. The average temperature varies between 35¬∞ and 45¬∞. Due to the soft breeze that comes with the dry season the climate becomes more agreeable, especially at night. The average rainfall varies between 500 and 600 mm. The flora of the region is known as Caatinga, which is characterized by sparse, stunted, thorny and drought-resistant vegetation. Trees, leafless for long periods and able to resist drought, also are characteristic, particularly in the basin of the S√£o Francisco River. There is also Cerrado in some parts of the municipality, which is characterised by low-lying vegetation and trees like the umbuzeiro, the aroeira, the xique-xique, the juruma preta, the umburana de cheiro, the mandacaru, the palma e other cacti that store water in their leaves and stems, which serve as food for the cattle and also for the population, mainly in the dry season. The fauna of the region is made up mainly of parakeets and doves. There are also parrots, owls, hawks, and emas. Mammals are rare but there are still wildcats, wilddogs, sagui monkeys, sloths, skunks, deer, capivara and bats. The on√ßa, or jaguar, is also still found in reduced numbers. Economy The first industries began with sugar mills to produce molasses and stills to produce rum. There were also small factories making manioc flour, cheese, carnauba wax, baba√ßa palm oil, bricks and roof tiles. Present-day Ibotirama has five brick factories, two rice mills, one quarry, five small ironworks, five sawmills, a broom factory, a mineral water bottler, and three furniture factories. Agriculture is the main economic activity. Main crops planted during the rainy season are: tobacco, beans, corn, manioc, pumpkin, sesame, sugarcane and grass. The plants develop quickly due to the constant heat of the region. There is also fishing on the river with over six thousand fishermen registered with the government. History The area was once inhabited by Tupi-Guarani Indians who had their fishing camp here. In the eighteenth century settlers began to arrive to start cattle ranching. A settlement was formed to supply muleteers and cattle drivers and fishermen began to settle to take advantage of the vast fishing in the river. In 1911, the village was elevated to the district of Piratinga and in 1931 it became a vila with the name of Jardin√≥polis. In 1943, the name was changed to Ibotirama. It was only in 1958 that it became a city. Economic growth occurred when the important Bras√≠lia-Salvador highway was built, making Ibotirama an obligatory stopover for travelers and truck drivers on the long and tiring journey.

On 2 February 1998, the 31-year-old McDonnell Douglas DC-9-32 crashed on the slopes of Mount Sumagaya in Gingoog City, Misamis Oriental. The incident resulted in the deaths of all 104 passengers and crew on board the aircraft. Background Route of the flight =Aircraft= The aircraft involved in the accident was a McDonnell Douglas DC-9 (registration number RP-C1507) and was delivered to Air Canada in September 1967 before acquired by Cebu Pacific in March 1997. =Passengers and crew= The plane carried five crew members and 94 Filipino passengers, including five children. Five passengers were from Australia, Austria, Japan, Switzerland and Canada. Additionally, a surgeon on a medical mission was from the United States. Accident The plane left Manila at 0100 GMT and was scheduled to arrive at 0303 GMT in Cagayan de Oro. The plane made a stopover at Tacloban on 0220 GMT, though sources differ about whether it was a scheduled or unscheduled stop. According to one source, the flight made an unscheduled stop at Tacloban to deliver a needed airplane tire for another Cebu Pacific aircraft in Tacloban. The last contact was 15 minutes before the plane was due to land, with the airport's ATC. In that transmission, the pilot said he was from the airport and was starting to descend. There was no indication that the plane was in trouble. The plane crashed away from the airport. Cause The cause of the crash is still a source of controversy in the Philippines. Colonel Jacinto Ligot was the chief of the Philippine Air Force rescue team, which faced difficulties due to the deep ravines and dense vegetation on the slopes of the mountain. The pilots were flying visually, not instrumentally, when the plane vanished from radar. While the skies were clear at the airport, the mountains may have been covered by fog. Chief of Staff General Clemente Mariano speculated that the plane \\"almost cleared the top of the mountain, but it may have suffered a down-draft, causing it to hit the mountain.\\" Jesus Dureza, the crisis manager during the rescue and retrieval operations, said he found out the Air Transportation Office maps used by the pilots listed the elevation of Mt. Sumagaya at 5,000 feet above sea level, while the mountain actually is 6,000 feet above sea level. This error might have misled the pilots to believe that they were clear of terrain, while in fact they were flying dangerously low. The ATO, on the other hand, pointed out in its official report deficiencies in the training of the pilots.

It is based on an eponymous 1996 novel by Hallgr√≠mur Helgason,Hallgr√≠mur Helgason, 101 Reykjav√≠k (Reykjav√≠k: M√°l og menning, 1996). ; 9979315768; 9789979314769 and both are set in Reykjav√≠k, Iceland. The title is taken from the √çslandsp√≥stur postal code for the Mi√∞borg district of central Reykjav√≠k. The film won nine B-class film awards and received ten nominations most notably winning the Discovery Film Award at the Toronto International Film Festival. Plot Geek Hlynur is approaching 30 years old, still lives with his mother who is divorced from his alcoholic father, downloads porn, and wanders around Reykjav√≠k half-heartedly searching for a job while spending much time in Kaffibarinn, the central Reykjav√≠k bar (the bar is owned in real life by writer/director Baltasar Korm√°kur and his soundtrack composer Damon Albarn, a long-standing Icelandophile). The cramped, dark and oddly furnished house in which Hlynur and his mother live features a bath which transfigures into a sofa as Hlynur steps naked out of it, in the middle of the lounge with his mother watching. Hlynur's isolated world ‚Äì no small metaphor for his home country ‚Äì is going along rather blissfully ignorant of the greater joys involved with engaging in life until his mother's friend Lola Milagros arrives to stay at the house for a while. Lola is a Spanish flamenco instructor with a seductive smile, a sultry voice and a carpe-diem attitude. Unknown to Hlynur, she is also bisexual and in a physical relationship with his mother, Berglind. An enigmatic character, Lola quickly becomes the center of the household dynamic when, after a night of heavy drinking while Berglind is away, she and Hlynur sleep together. The fling remains a secret between Hlynur and Lola. (Throughout the film, the song Lola often plays as background music.) As Hlynur gradually learns of their lesbian relationship, he becomes jealous of it, realizing that he was simply a momentary fling for Lola, but he is also the dutiful son who wants to accept his mother's newfound lesbianism and be happy for her. He also has occasional seeming oedipal / incestuous dreams about his mother. Lola wants Hlynur to get out of the house and find himself something to do because she recognizes from the start that that's what he needs most, but Hlynur prefers to pass the time in a true slacker fashion with plenty of excess and not an iota of effort. He sees no real future for himself, rather an entire life supported by the Icelandic welfare state. \\"It's a great system.\\" he says. When asked what he does, Hlynur responds with, \\"Nothing.\\" Pushed further with, \\"What kind of nothing?\\" he replies the only way he can: \\"A nothing kind of nothing.\\" Not even death is a serious topic for Hlynur ‚Äì intoxicating, out-all-night weekends inspire, \\"Each weekend I drop dead.\\" He says this while lighting up a Lucky atop a snow-capped mountain, where he lies down as the snow gradually covers him up, but his plans are scuppered by rainfall melting his would-be tomb. His mixed up thoughts include musings about suicide: \\"The worst thing about AIDS as a method of suicide is that it takes so long to die from it.\\" On the other hand, Hlynur's fantasy life is alive with passion and glimpses of his subconscious show us a deeply conflicted sense of self. Flashbacks of an alcoholic father mix with sexual fantasies of the lovely Lola but quickly reveal that mom's in bed, too. During a quick trip to the suburbs for a dinner with extended family, Hlynur, so comically disturbed by the mundane family ritual (they actually gather to watch a video of last year's family dinner), imagines a bloodbath scene killing everyone at close range with a shotgun. When brought back to reality, Hlynur's blank slate and effortless personality come back into the fore: \\"I was thinking what a nice couch you have\\", he explains to the previously slaughtered family. Hlynur's confusion over the whole situation is expressed in his rather profound and imaginative musings: > There they are...my mother the lesbian, and my father the boozer. What am I > then? The offspring of a lesbian and a boozer? It's like two birds of > different species. The lesbian bird and the boozer bird. The boozer is a > wetland bird. He's rather heavy...and needs a good run-up to get off the > ground. He can fly for a long time and has good stamina. Several weeks may > pass by before he gets back on the ground. In between he lies low and goes > on the defensive. Especially for the first days after landing. The lesbian. > Unlike the boozer...the lesbian is a relative newcomer to Icelandic nature. > She is thought to have migrated from Denmark and Britain. Her only contact > with the male bird is during conception. In recent years we have witnessed > cases of male birds...who are unable to fly at all. The offspring of a > boozer and a lesbian is the Hlynur...an unusually slow developer that can't > fly... and remains with his mother for the first 30 years. The Hlynur is > defensive by nature, but harmless. The film progresses as Hlynur comes to terms with his mother's love for Lola and his own feelings of inadequacy with her. The announcement that Lola is pregnant pushes him to the brink, making living under the same roof next to impossible for all three; but after a lot of acting out and flippant commentary, Hlynur begins to see life little differently. Hlynur also begins engaging in more activities outside his home and eventually finds himself a fitting job as well as the affections of a woman his age who has broken up with her unfaithful boyfriend. The infant's arrival also symbolically coincides neatly with Hlynur's homecoming to the world outside his bedroom and a newfound contentedness. The strong possibility that he is the father of Lola's child has been a secret between Lola and Hlynur, and this is more than hinted at in the closing scenes of the happy household composed of mother, son, Lola, and Lola's baby who calls him Papa.

He studied at the University of Al- Qarawiyyin. For many years, his professor and mentor was Abdeslam Serghini. He founded the nationalist Istiqlal party which was a driving force after the Moroccan Army of Liberation (jaish at-tahreer), with many Berbers, in the Moroccan struggle for independence from French colonial rule. He broke with the party in the mid-1950s, siding with armed revolutionaries and urban guerrillas who waged a violent campaign against French rule, whereas most the nationalist mainstream preferred a diplomatic solution. In 1956, as Morocco gained independence, he reentered the party, and famously presented his case for reclaiming territories that have once been Moroccan in the newspaper al- Alam. In 1959, after the left-wing UNFP split off from Istiqlal, he became head of the party. In 1962, he briefly served as Morocco's Minister of Islamic Affairs. He was elected to the Parliament of Morocco in 1963, and served there as an Istiqlal deputy. He then went on to become a main leader within the opposition during the 1960s and the start of the 1970s.

They are found in mountainous part of the island. They are one of the largest Malagasy ethnic groups and their population estimates range between 700,000 and over 1.2 million. This estimation places them as the fourth-largest ethnicity in Madagascar. Distribution of Tsimihety people (light yellow in north), compared to other Malagasy ethnic groups. Alternate distribution has been reported by Tofanelli et al. Ethnic identity The Tsimihety trace their origins back to the eastern coast, having migrated with their cattle to the Mandritsara plain in the 18th century as leaderless refugees fleeing the slave wars ongoing in their homeland. Soon afterward they accepted the rule of the Volafotsy, a clan associated with the Maroserana who had migrated north from Sakalava territory. Peter Wilson ‚Äì a professor of Anthropology specializing on Madagascar, states that Tsimihety people do not fit the normal assumptions of anthropologists, for these people \\"didn't create symbols or rituals or tribal rules\\" like tribes do, but they can \\"only be described negatively\\" by what they didn't and don't do. They are thus not a tribe, because they lack tribal ties, lack social compact and have no hierarchical power structure within the ethnic group. Their relationships are centered around biological family and kin. History Philibert Tsiranana, from the Tsimihety ethnic group, was the first president of post-colonial era Madagascar. The anarchist system prevailed among the Tsimihety people before the 19th century. However, in 1823, Radama I, the Merina king, brought the entire island under one rule, including the Tsimihety, and abolished the international slave trade. The French colonial rule absorbed the Tsimihety in 1896, as a part of French Madagascar. The Tsimihety have been an active part of Madagascar politics ever since. Philibert Tsiranana, a Tsimihety from near Mandritsara, was the first president of the Malagasy Republic, when it became a semi-autonomous region within the French Union in 1959, and remained president for 10 years after it gained independence from France in 1960. Society David Graeber, an anthropologist specializing in the study of Anarchy systems, states the Tsimihety people exemplify one of the few historic social systems that accepted no authority and practiced anarchy: The Tsimihety represent one of the rare examples where the culture was innately anti-government, where states Graeber, all forms of government had effectively been withdrawn even from countryside and communities. Informal consensus was the basis of local decisions, anyone behaving like a leader was considered suspicious, giving orders was wrong, expecting anyone to be responsible for or would actually do something was wrong, and even concepts such as working for a wage was morally shunned. Graeber states that ultimately, the Tsimihety were \\"eventually gobbled up by the state\\", gave up the utopia, as they sought economic opportunities and infrastructure. =Family affiliation= The Tsimihety people are patrilineal, and kin relationships with the male ancestors and descendants are most important to both men and women. Their cultural conventions require extended exogamy, which coupled with high birth rates have led to their migration and high diffusion among neighboring ethnic groups. The society is also notable for the social roles expected by a Tsimihety family from a maternal uncle. Language The language of the Tsimihety people is a dialect of the Malagasy language, a branch of the Malayo-Polynesian language group derived from the Barito languages spoken in the Austronesian region.Malagasy, Tsimihety, EthnologueDm Albro (2005), Language: Tsimihety Malagasy, Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History Economy Tsimihety society and economy, as in much of Madagascar, is primarily focused on agriculture. Rice is the staple crop, and the Tsimihety raise cattle. Working on crop land on Tuesday is fady ‚Äì a taboo ‚Äì among the Tsimihety. The main economic center among the Tsimihety is in Mandritsara.

Mass Rapid Transit (MRT)  The underground Bukit Bintang MRT station , part of the Sungai Buloh-Kajang MRT line, opened on 17 July 2017 as part of Phase 2 of the system. Early proposals envisioned two stations- Bukit Bintang East and Bukit Bintang West (alternately Bukit Bintang 1 and Bukit Bintang 2) which were later combined into one, and made into a connecting station (without paid zone integration) with the eponymous Monorail station. The MRT station features five exits, serving the nearby shopping malls. Bukit Bintang's skyline = Other access = In 2011, Petronas spent RM100 million under its social contribution programme to build an elevated, air-conditioned walkway from Suria KLCC shopping centre to Pavilion shopping centre in Bukit Bintang. The walkway includes a 562m long and five-metre wide elevated walkway that traverses through the busy areas of Pinang Road, Perak Road and Raja Chulan Road with escalator and staircase entry and exit points at strategic and convenient locations as well as security guards for the safety of the pedestrians. The walkway is also linked to the Raja Chulan Monorail station, Impiana Hotel and Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre. An average walk from Suria KLCC to Pavilion through the elevated walkway would take approximately 15 minutes.

It was designed and developed by the German aircraft engineer Franz Kruckenberg in 1929. Propulsion was by means of a pusher propeller located at the rear: it accelerated the railcar to setting the land speed record for a petrol powered rail vehicle. Only a single example was ever built, which due to safety concerns remained out of service and was finally dismantled in 1939. The Schienenzeppelin would become the basis for the Thomas and Friends character Hugo, voiced by Rob Rackstraw.  History  Anticipating the design of the Schienenzeppelin, the earlier Aerowagon, an experimental Russian high-speed railcar, was also equipped with an aircraft engine and a propeller. The railcar was built at the beginning of 1930 in the Hannover-Leinhausen works of the German Imperial Railway Company (Deutsche Reichsbahn). The work was completed by autumn of the same year. The vehicle was long and had just two axles, with a wheelbase of . The height was . As originally built it had two conjoined BMW IV 6-cylinder petrol aircraft engines (later a single BMW VI 12-cylinder of ) driving a four-bladed (later two-bladed), fixed pitch ash propeller. The driveshaft was raised seven- degrees above the horizontal to give the vehicle some downwards thrust. The body of the Schienenzeppelin was streamlined, having some resemblance to the era's popular Zeppelin airships, and it was built of aluminum in aircraft style to reduce weight. The railcar could carry up to 40 passengers; its interior was spartan and designed in Bauhaus-style. On 10 May 1931, the Schienenzeppelin exceeded a speed of for the first time. Afterwards, it was exhibited to the general public throughout Germany. On 21 June 1931, it set a new world railway speed record of on the Berlin‚ÄìHamburg line between Karst√§dt and Dergenthin, which was not surpassed by any other rail vehicle until 1954. The railcar still holds the land speed record for a petrol powered rail vehicle. This high speed was attributable, amongst other things, to its low weight, which was only . Front view of the Schienenzeppelin in its original form; at Berlin on the morning of the record-breaking run, 21 June 1931 In 1932 Kruckenberg began a new project with the rail car involving significant modifications. It was cut just behind the forward wheels and received a complete new front end with a two-axle bogie, resembling the later 137 155 railcar. The rear single axle remained as it was. The modifications were completed by November 1932. The aircraft engine was still used; however, the power transmission was hydraulic through two F√∂ttinger Fluid Drives for both directions of travel, fitted on the forward bogie. A pointed fairing was installed in place of the propeller. The resulting vehicle was a B-1 with a powered front bogie. This version of the vehicle reached at the beginning of 1933. Due to many problems with the Schienenzeppelin prototype, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft decided to go their own way in developing a high-speed railcar, leading to the Fliegender Hamburger (Flying Hamburger) in 1933. This new design was suitable for regular service and served also as the basis for later railcar developments. However, many of the Kruckenberg ideas, based on the experiments with Schienenzeppelin and high-speed rail travel, found their way into later DRG railcar designs. At the beginning of 1934 the Schienenzeppelin was rebuilt for the last time, and a Maybach GO 5 engine was installed. In July 1934 it was sold to Deutsche Reichsbahn (German Imperial Railway) for 10,000 Reichsmarks. Five years later, in 1939 the rail zeppelin was finally dismantled because its material was needed by the German army.  Disadvantages  The failure of Schienenzeppelin has been attributed to everything from the dangers of using an open propeller in crowded railway stations to fierce competition between Kruckenberg's company and the Deutsche Reichsbahn's separate efforts to build high-speed railcars. One disadvantage of the rail zeppelin was the inherent difficulty of pulling additional wagons to form a train, because of its construction. Furthermore, the vehicle could not use its propeller to climb steep gradients, as the flow would separate when full power was applied. Thus an additional means of propulsion was needed for such circumstances. Safety concerns have been associated with running high-speed railcars on old track network, with the inadvisability of reversing the vehicle, and with operating a propeller close to passengers.

Playing career Jim Provett came through Hartlepool United's youth development programme, the same programme that developed players such as Adam Boyd and Antony Sweeney. It was there where he developed into a good shot- stopper and he was offered a professional contract by the then manager Chris Turner in 2001. Provett's professional contract saw the departure of Martin Hollund who was released. In 2002, Provett made his debut against Tranmere Rovers in the Football League Trophy. However, during his debut he conceded five goals. For the remainder of the season Provett struggled to dislodge Anthony Williams who played in all of Hartlepool's league games. During the following 2003‚Äì04 season Provett was handed his opportunity to impress in the League Cup against Sheffield Wednesday. During this match he made a save during a penalty shoot out to win Hartlepool the match. He kept his place in the team for the remainder of the season and was named the Hartlepool's Players' Player and Fans' Player of the Season. For the start of the 2004‚Äì05 season Provett was given the number one goalkeepers shirt. He started the first few games of the season but soon faced stiff competition from Dimitrious Konstantopolous who eventually overtook him as Hartlepool's first choice keeper. As the season approached its final quarter Provett handed in a transfer request due to lack of first team appearances. However, he withdrew this request the week before Hartlepool played the second leg of the play-off semi-final. After failing to make the first team for the following two seasons, Provett stalled on a new contract. However, before he resigned Hartlepool withdrew their offer and he left the club. In July 2007, he joined Bury on trial. After passing a medical, Provett joined Bury and was their new number one keeper. He was released by Bury FC after making 41 appearances for the club at the end of the 2007‚Äì08 season. On 3 July 2008, Harrogate Town released the news that Provett had signed for them. He became the number 1 for Harrogate Town and made a reputation for producing great save after great save. However, due to cost-cutting measures the entire Harrogate squad was put up for sale. Provett was transferred to Gateshead on 11 February 2009. After making 19 appearances (including 1 game in 2009 against Chester City, whose record was expunged that season), Gateshead released Provett after the 2009‚Äì10 season. Provett went on to join Norton and Stockton Ancients of the Northern League. In addition to playing football, he went on to train budding goalkeepers for 'Just4Keepers', founded by former Everton goalkeeper Ray Newland. In the summer of 2013 he left Norton to rejoin Hartlepool United, this time as goalkeeper coach, taking over from Andy Collett, who left to take up the same role with York City. In the 2014 close season, he joined Darlington as goalkeeping player-coach. Provett left Darlington in 2016.

The community is named for the many beluga whales which congregate off the coast. Many of the inhabitants hunt these whales every fall and use their by-products for their oil and food. Whale Cove, initially settled by three distinct Inuit groups (one inland and two coastal), is a relatively traditional community: 99% Inuit, who still wear fur, hunt, fish, eat raw meat and fish. Several bowhead whales may appear in the area as well.http://www.nwmb.com/en/public-hearings/2008/mar-06-2008-level-of-tah-for- bowhead-whales/552-tab16-arctic-2000/file Whale Cove is on the polar bear migration route. Local Inuit regularly travel by snowmobile in the winter or by boat in summer months between the hamlet of Rankin Inlet and Whale Cove, a distance of . The terrain is Arctic tundra, this consists mostly of rocks, mosses and lichens. As of the 2016 census, the population was 435, an increase of 6.9% from the 2011 census. History Inuit in the Whale Cove area traded whale oil, baleen, furs, leather and walrus tusks with the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) since the mid-18th century when the HBC established their trading post at Churchill, Manitoba. =Relocations 1950s= In the 1950s and 1960s Inuit were relocated in a series of moves from one hamlet to another, some of them arriving in Whale Cove, a hamlet created by the federal government for these Inuit groups. Some came from Ennadai Lake via Arviat to Whale Cove, other came from Back River via Garry Lake then Baker Lake to Whale Cove. By the 1970s Inuit living in Whale Cove represented boast coastal Inuit from Rankin Inlet and Arviat and different Caribou Inuit, from the Barren Grounds west of Hudson Bay, including the Ihalmiut (\\"people from beyond\\"), or Ahiarmiut (\\"the out-of-the-way dwellers\\") on the banks of the Kazan River, Ennadai Lake, Little Dubawnt Lake (Kamilikuak), and north of Thlewiaza (Kugjuaq; \\"Big River\\"), had been relocated in the 1950s Whale Cove and Henik Lake. by the Department of Northern Affairs and Natural Resources (now Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada). Their hunting experience was based almost entirely on \\"inland caribou herds that had thinned by the 1950s and left many families hungry. Coastal dwelling Inuit from Rankin Inlet and Arviat were relocated to Whale Cove from nearby coastal communities in order to aid the inlanders in adapting to a marine subsistence economy.\\" Ennadai Lake relocations 1950‚Äì1960s Whale Cove In the late 1960s a famine swept the land. Inuit were forced to walk towards places like Arviat to escape the desperation. Survivors who couldn't walk were airlifted to Whale Cove, Baker Lake and Rankin Inlet. Self-government In 1971 in Toronto, at the first meeting of what would become the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, Celestino Makpah, a traditional tool maker, who makes harpoons, ice chisels etc. but specializes in uluit,Rankin Inlet profilesCelestino instructs students at the Maani Ulujuk High School. the representative from Whale Cove described a number of ways in which the affairs of the Inuit of the Keewatin were managed by the government and non-Inuit. Celestino recounted how, \\"a non-Native southerner started a private fishing enterprise on two lakes near Whale Cove without consulting the local people. At the time, the federal government decided what projects would or would not happen in the Northwest Territories.\\" \\"In our area, in Keewatin, there is no one managing the affairs of the Inuit other than the government. It is all government. I will give you an example: Near the surroundings of Whale Cove we have a large lake with plenty of fish. The white people control that lake just like they own it. There is a man, who is a tourist, who is probably one of the richest men there and he controls that lake. I don't mind at all if anyone is a tourist comes into our communities and fishes. The only thing I don't like about it is the government is the channel through which these private enterpriser go of course, because it is their land! So far there have been two large lakes which have been taken by private enterpriser with the help of the government, and this is one of the examples I really dislike. Since they are the government, even though they are aware of the rights of the native people they will not come and tell you \\"Do you know what your rights are? Do you know what you should do?\\" I think we, the Inuits, are just waiting for something to come up. \\" \\"These should have been under our control,\\" Makpah said, \\"[the lakes] should never have been given to the American enterpriser.\\" In 1973, the Inuit Tapirisat of Canada (now Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami) initiated the Inuit Land Use and Occupancy Project and anthropologist David Hoffman conducted fieldwork in Whale Cove as part of a team of experts contributing to this project. The project under Milton Freeman, \\"documented the total Inuit land use area of the Northwest Territories, then stretching from the Mackenzie River to east Baffin Island,\\" to provide, in Freeman's words, \\"information in support of the fact that Inuit have used and occupied this vast northern land since time immemorial and that they still use and occupy it to this day.\\" Hoffmann admired the \\"precision with which Inuit ‚Äì who did not ordinarily use maps and who often could not read English ‚Äì were able to recall specific areas of use and the \\"incredible encyclopedic knowledge of the land,\\" formed by generations of dependence on its living bounty.\\" Economic development Tikirarjuaq/Whale Cove companies and organizations, community and government services, the Kivalliq Inuit Association, First Air, Kivalliq Air, Arctic Co-operative, Nunavut Arctic College, Calm Air, Service Canada, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Sakku Development Corp., Nunavut Development Corp, Agnico-Eagle, The North West Company, Kivalliq Partners in Development and ED&T.; made presentations at the first Economic Development Day held at the Inuglak School gymnasium, in Tikirarjuaq/Whale Cove on 20 September 2011.

Summers are usually cool, wet, and rainy, but can be warm; with a record high of . Summers typically last four months. Notable people from Whale Cove John Adjuk (1913 Back River -2006 Whale Cove) moved with his family to Whale Cove in March 1964 from the Baker Lake area. Originally from the Back River area (Chantrey Inlet) north of Baker Lake, living the traditional way of life on the land, he moved to the Garry Lake area. Following famine in the Garry Lake area, he was evacuated to Baker (Lake Qamanittuaq) in 1955. In 1955 they returned to Garry Lake but in early 1958 the family of five was evacuated to the community of Baker Lake when famine struck the land. The Hanningajurmiut, or Hanningaruqmiut, or Hanningajulinmiut {\\"the people of the place that lies across\\"} lived at Garry Lake, south of the Utkuhiksalingmiut. Many Hanningajurmiut starved in 1958 when the caribou bypassed their traditional hunting grounds, but the 31 who survived were relocated to Baker. Most never returned permanently to Garry Lake.First generation Inuit artists such as Jessie Oonark, Marion Tuu'luq and camp leader Luke Anguhadluq (1895-1982) were also born in the Back River area of Nunavut and were evacuated to Baker Lake because of starvation in 1967. In March, 1964, the Adjuk family, which now included six daughters, moved to Whale Cove because it was thought the hunting and fishing was better.

Helvering, 293 U.S. 465 (1935), was a landmark decision by the United States Supreme Court concerned with U.S. income tax law.. The case is cited as part of the basis for two legal doctrines: the business purpose doctrine and the doctrine of substance over form. The business purpose doctrine is essentially that if a transaction has no substantial business purpose other than the avoidance or reduction of Federal tax, the tax law will not regard the transaction. The doctrine of substance over form is essentially that for Federal tax purposes, a taxpayer is bound by the economic substance of a transaction if the economic substance varies from its legal form. Facts Evelyn Gregory was the owner of all the shares of a company called United Mortgage Company (\\"United\\"). United Mortgage in turn owned 1,000 shares of stock of a company called Monitor Securities Corporation (\\"Monitor\\"). On September 18, 1928, she created Averill Corp and, three days after, transferred the 1000 shares in Monitor to Averill. On September 24, she dissolved Averill and distributed the 1000 shares in Monitor to herself, and on the same day sold the shares for $133,333.33. She claimed there was a cost of $57,325.45, and she should be taxed on a capital net gain on $76,007.88. On her 1928 federal income tax return, Gregory treated the transaction as a tax free corporate reorganization, under the Revenue Act of 1928 section 112. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Guy T. Helvering, argued in economic substance there was no business reorganization, that Gregory owned all three corporations and was simply following a legal form to make it appear like a reorganization so she could dispose of the Monitor shares without paying substantial income tax. Accordingly, she understated her liability by $10,000. Judgment In the ensuing litigation, the Board of Tax Appeals (a predecessor to today's United States Tax Court) ruled in favor of the taxpayer. See Gregory v. Commissioner, 27 B.T.A. 223 (1932). =Second Circuit= On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the Board of Tax Appeals, ruling in favor of the Commissioner. Learned Hand J said the following in the course of his judgment. =Supreme Court= The Supreme Court of the United States also ruled in favor of the Commissioner. Although the letter of the law might arguably have been complied with, the intention of the Act was not to allow reorganizations merely for the purpose of tax avoidance. In the course of its judgment, the Court said the following.Gregory v.

Robinson was born in what is now Hamilton County, Indiana in c. 1791. He was a lawyer and partnered with future U.S. President, William Henry Harrison. He married Mary Isdell in 1820, but abandoned his first wife and five children when he left for Arkansas in 1828. His wife later obtained a divorce. Robinson moved with Sarah K. Snyder or Snider, to Kentucky in 1828. She was born c. 1810. They later moved to Arkansas around 1830 where they were married. They had one son, William N. born c. 1840.  Texas Republic  Robinson moved to Nacogdoches, Texas in 1833 and received a land grant for a league of land. Robinson was elected Lieutenant Governor of the provisional Texas government in 1835. Robinson was provisional Governor of Texas in 1836 after Governor Henry Smith was deposed, but Smith claimed it was invalid as there was no quorum present. Robinson served in the Texas Army during the Texas War of Independence in 1836 and fought at the Battle of San Jacinto. In 1835, he served as a delegate to the Texas 1835 Consultation of 1835 as a representative of the District of Nacogdoches. In 1836 he was elected District Judge, which automatically made him a Judge of the Texas Supreme Court, and served until 1840. In 1842 he was captured and carried to Mexico, but arranged his release from Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna in 1843. California Robinson moved to San Diego in the Spring of 1850 and was one of the few lawyers there, and was fluent in Spanish, so specialized in land law. Robinson expressed frustration at the Byzantine Spanish and Mexican land grant system, and the large size of the land grants. Robinson was one of the few Americans to speak out against U.S. recognition of Mexican land grants in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. He said: > These acts of national robbery, desperate like a vampire, draining the last > dollar from the impoverished inhabitants of our State, without law and > contrary to law. The land grants were huge and given to a few favored people by local Mexican officials. Contrary to Mexican law, they were often not approved by the central Mexican government, and other procedures weren't followed (such as a land survey). Robinson was City Treasurer in 1851, School Commissioner in 1854, and District Attorney in 1852-1855, President of the Board of Trustees for San Diego during 1853-1855\\\\. Robinson helped establish the Democratic Party in San Diego, and was its early leader. Robinson built an adobe house in Old Town San Diego. The first floor was leased out as a store. At various times, The adobe also served as a schoolroom, office building, Railroad Building, at times. In 1856, Robinson built porches around the first and second floors, causing the local newspaper to call it \\"the most pleasant in the City.\\" This adobe has been reconstructed and serves as Old Town State Historic Park headquarters, and is open to the public. Robinson realized that transportation would be important to San Diego. With his associate Louis Rose, Robinson founded the San Diego and Gila Railroad and was elected its president in 1855. The railroad was never built. Around 1855 Robinson begin to have serious health problems. Robinson Died 1857 in San Diego, California. His obituary in the San Diego Herald said that he was: > the most prominent man during the last six years, in every enterprise which > relate to our prosperity and advancement.

History =Predecessors= The first station to broadcast on channel 2 in Lima came about in 1957, when Eduardo Cavero, owner of a network of radio stations, acquired a license for that frequency. On May 27, 1962, the channel launched, with an emphasis on variety shows and musical programs. However, the competition up the dial between Am√©rica Televisi√≥n and Panamericana Televisi√≥n, on channels 4 and 5, would take its toll on the ratings at channel 2, and in 1966, the station was sold to Tele 2 S.A., a joint venture between the Spanish company Movierecord and the American Metromedia, which renamed the station Tele 2 and turned it into the first movie-focused station in Latin America; Tele 2 would broadcast movies in the afternoon and repeat them at night, plus a 15-minute newscast at the start of its broadcast day. With changes in Peru's military government in 1974, the station's license was revoked, and channel 2 in Lima would go dark. =1982‚Äì87: Frecuencia 2= In 1982, Compa√±√≠a Latinoamericana de Radiodifusi√≥n (Latin American Broadcasting Company) was founded by Bernardo Batievsky, a publicist and filmmaker, with Baruch Ivcher (Israeli-born owner of mattress maker Paraiso) and brothers Samuel and Mendel Winter (owners of Winter's chocolate factory) as his financial backers. On January 23, 1983, their new station, named Frecuencia 2 (Frequency 2), took to the air; the inaugural broadcast was headlined by then-president Fernando Bela√∫nde Terry. The original station building was located in Miraflores Ward, Lima. The programming mix of Frecuencia 2 blended a style patterned after the American superstation format with next to nothing in terms of national production, as it did not have any studio facilities available to produce major national shows. The station's approach to news was equally unusual: 90 Segundos, a 90-second newscast broadcast throughout the day (and supplemented with a main, longer edition in 1984). =1987‚Äì93: National expansion and a terrorist attack= The Frecuencia 2 signal covered Lima well, from Huacho in the north to Chincha in the south, but management wanted to think bigger. The sign-on of a retransmitter in Ica in 1987 was the first of many in the years to come, capped by the 1990 acquisition of a transponder on the PanAmSat satellite to cover the entire country, motivated by a desire to be the first to cover all of Peru. The channel grew, in staffing, programming and local production, but most of the new programs were still filmed in theaters because there were still no dedicated studios available. One of the new shows, Contrapunto, a weekly news show, would remain on the air for 13 years. Finally, the first drama program launched in 1989, the series Matalach√©, based on a 1928 novel by Enrique L√≥pez Alb√∫jar aired, though it was still produced by a subcontractor. The launch of studio facilities in a larger lot at San Felipe Avenue in Jes√∫s Mar√≠a Ward, acquired in 1989, was a major boon. However, as things were looking up, a sudden turn of fortune came on June 5, 1992. A Shining Path car bomb left the new facilities mostly in ruins and three Frecuencia 2 employees dead. The facilities were reconstructed, and upon its reopening had become one of the nation's most modern, ending years of outside production for most of its programs, as the channel had by 1993 reached all corners of the country via satellite. =1993‚Äì97: Frecuencia Latina, first Ivcher administration= With the changing programming, national reach and elevated status, Frecuencia 2 changed names to Frecuencia Latina on October 31, 1993. At this time, Baruch Ivcher, new minor owner of the network, signed a contract with director Luis Llosa and his Iguana Producciones, a production company that helped lead to a wave of new and nationally produced dramas and fiction programs, headed by new stars that would go on to make their mark in many other programs. =1997‚Äì2000: The Winter brothers= Contrapunto was one of the most important programs at Frecuencia Latina, and when it exposed government corruption against Alberto Fujimori's administration in 1996, Baruch Ivcher, who had acquired Peruvian citizenship in keeping with a law that prohibited foreigners from owning radio or television stations in the country, had it stripped. Because of this, he lost control of Frecuencia Latina. Mendel and Samuel Winter, who had been minor owners of Compa√±√≠a Latinoamericana de Radiodifusi√≥n since 1983, took control, bringing with them an update to the channel's logo. Among the successes of the Winter years were the talk show Maritere, hosted by Maritere Braschi (who had come from Contrapunto) and Magaly Medina's program ' (1998‚Äì2000). =2000‚Äì2009: Second Ivcher administration= The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights heard Ivcher's case and called for the government to reinstate his citizenship and ownership of Frecuencia Latina, cease harassing him and indemnify him for the false accusations made against him. On December 6, 2000, Ivcher triumphantly returned to Frecuencia Latina, Peruvian flag in hand. With the Winter brothers out, Magaly (and many other personalities) left due to expiring contracts and the change in management. In the early 2000s, Beto Ortiz and Gisela Valc√°rcel also had programs on the channel; Beto's Vidas secretas (Secret Lives) was a gossip program that revealed facts about TV personalities, including those from Frecuencia Latina. While Gisela's remake of Big Brother, La casa de Gisela (Gisela's House), attained high ratings, she was fired after facts were revealed on Vidas secretas. =2009‚Äì2012: The Urrutia era= After director Javier Carmona resigned in 2009, Ivcher appointed the Chilean Javier Urrutia as the new general executive of Frecuencia Latina. The decision was met with concern, as it was suspected that Urrutia had ties to Vladimiro Montesinos and was a spy for Chile's intelligence service. However, Urrutia clashed with key personalities. Philips Butters, a sports journalist who had been named \\"best sports journalist\\" in 2007 and 2008, was sacked after Urrutia wanted to change his program El Especialista, which covered sports. Even El Especial del Humor, a weekend fixture at Frecuencia Latina, was axed in 2010 when Urrutia objected to some of the content. Programs left the air as Urrutia and the hosts of Frecuencia Latina's programs butted heads. Eventually, Ivcher's patience ran out, and Urrutia was fired. On September 14, 2010, Frecuencia Latina's HDTV feed signed on, using the ISDB-T system. =2012‚Äìpresent: New shareholders= On June 26, 2012, Ivcher announced that a controlling stake in Frecuencia Latina was being sold to Enfoca Inversiones, a Peruvian investment company headed by Jesus Zamora. In September, he acquired the shares that belonged to the Winter brothers in a liquidation resulting from a long judicial process, and immediately afterwards Enfoca Inversiones exercised a call option to acquire them thus controlling all the outstanding shares of the company. In 2013, he stepped down from the board of Frecuencia Latina, ceding full control to the new board of directors headed by Jes√∫s Zamora. =2014: as Latina= On the night of November 28, 2014, during the program La Voz Peru, the logo and the slogan of the channel changed, going from Frecuencia Latina to call simply \\"Latina\\" and its slogan changed from \\"Think Big\\" to \\"always more\\" respectively. The new logo was a big departure from the logo first used in 2010, it now featured a big letter L on a blue square background. By 2017, the blue L was changed to a green logo, the vertical line now changed to that of 8 power buttons.

Noted as an early entrant into the folk-rock boom of the early 2000s, the group has had many personnel changes but revolves around singer/songwriter Eric D. Johnson. History In 2000, Eric D. Johnson was an instructor at The Old Town School of Folk Music, led his own space-rock band called I Rowboat, and was a guitarist in various groups, including Califone and The Shins. He also had a four-track solo outlet called Fruit Bats, which he had been working on since 1997. Fruit Bats had begun to evolve into a band with the inclusion of I Rowboat members Dan Strack and Brian Belval and in 2001, their debut record Echolocation was released on Califone's imprint, Perishable Records. Tours followed with the likes of Modest Mouse and The Shins. Fruit Bats signed with Sub Pop in 2002 and have released four albums with the label including Mouthfuls in 2003, Spelled in Bones in 2005, The Ruminant Band in 2009 and Tripper in 2011. Johnson also joined The Shins in 2009. Their song \\"Humbug Mountain Song\\" spurred new fan activity. In an interview with Reverb Magazines Nick Milligan (Australia), Eric D. Johnson has said of The Ruminant Band: \\"I shouldn't say I had any strong ideas about how I wanted The Ruminant Band to differ from our other records, but I knew that I definitely wanted it to. Previously, when I did those other albums, I think I set rules for myself. This time I didn't try to go by the book so much. I also let the other [band members] play, rather than me being in charge. I played very little on this record ‚Äì I wrote the songs and the vocal arrangements, and played some piano, but for the most part everything else is the band. That trust is something that comes with time. I had four years to sit and think about it. It can get lonely when you're doing the ‚Äì quote unquote ‚Äì solo thing. My band is really talented, so I wanted their voices to be heard.\\" The song \\"When U Love Somebody\\" from the album Mouthfuls can be heard in the 2010 film Youth in Revolt. The music video for \\"The Ruminant Band\\" from the album The Ruminant Band was shot in El Monte, California and directed by The General Assembly. Eric D. Johnson is the only member of the Fruit Bats to appear in the video. He is backed by a fictitious band that includes legendary guitarist, Willie Chambers of The Chambers Brothers. In June 2011, Johnson appeared in the music video for \\"You're Too Weird\\" from the album Tripper. The video was shot in Hollywood, California and directed by The General Assembly. In November 2013, Johnson announced the demise of the Fruit Bats on the band's website. The band played a handful of live shows, which also marked the 10th anniversary of their album Mouthfuls, in the Pacific Northwest, with their final show in Portland on November 16, 2013. Johnson announced via Twitter in May 2015, \\"I'm doing Fruit Bats again\\", and linked an Instagram photo of a handwritten letter, indicating that an album will be released in 2016. Additionally, they performed with My Morning Jacket on their 2015 tour. The album Absolute Loser was released in 2016. Johnson is also the cofounder of the Huichica Musical Festival, in Sonoma, California, along with Jeff Bundschu, owner of Gundlach Bundschu winery. Johnson started this festival in 2009 to give him and his friends a place to play. Musical influences According to an article in The Aspen Times, lead singer Eric D. Johnson's musical influences include 70s AM radio, which he listened to while growing up in Naperville, Illinois, and The Grateful Dead. One writer described the band's fourth album, The Ruminant Band, as one that ...\\"revels in early ‚Äò70s SoCal bliss and other alt-country permutations,\\" with elements reflective of classic rock icons including Neil Young, Fleetwood Mac and Three Dog Night. In a music blog entry in the Chicago Sun-Times from 2010, the band's influences include The Byrds, The Kinks' album The Village Green Preservation Society, pop radio from the late '70s and early '80s, and Supertramp. According to the same blog post, lead singer Johnson said of his musical style, \\"I started out a hippie, but I've always had that pop jones -- and that's been plenty revolutionary, at least for me.\\" Discography =Albums= *Echolocation (2001) *Mouthfuls (2003) *Tragedy + Time = Fruit Bats (2004) *Spelled in Bones (2005) *The Ruminant Band (2009) *Tripper (2011) *Absolute Loser (2016) *Gold Past Life (2019) =Other Appearances= * You Be My Heart (2013) * Fruit Bats & Vetiver 'In Real Life (Live at Spacebomb Studios)' References External links * *Fruit Bats history at SubPop *Interview with Centerstage Chicago (December 2006) *Interview with Eric Johnson at Jambands.ca (March 2010) Category:Indie rock musical groups from Illinois Category:Musical groups from Chicago Category:American indie folk groups Category:Merge Records artists Category:Spacebomb Records artists ","title":"Fruit Bats (band)"},{"id":"3681041","text":"The following is a list of the 17 cantons of the Ard√®che department, in France, following the French canton reorganisation which came into effect in March 2015:D√©cret n¬∞ 2014-148 du 13 f√©vrier 2014 portant d√©limitation des cantons dans le d√©partement de l'Ard√®cheD√©cret n¬∞ 2016-1319 du 5 octobre 2016 * Annonay-1 * Annonay-2 * Aubenas-1 * Aubenas-2 * Berg-Helvie * Bourg-Saint- And√©ol * Les C√©vennes ard√©choises * Guilherand-Granges * Haute-Ard√®che * Haut- Eyrieux * Haut-Vivarais * Le Pouzin * Privas * Rh√¥ne-Eyrieux * Sarras * Tournon-sur-Rh√¥ne * Vallon-Pont-d'Arc References ","title":"Cantons of the Ard√®che department"},{"id":"3681044","text":"Bobet may refer to: in people: *Jean Bobet (born 1930), French cyclist *Louison Bobet (1925-1983), French cyclist in other: *A flag which monitors which way the wind is blowing, like a weather vane *Louison Bobet (bicycles), line of bicycles produced by Louison Bobet ","title":"Bobet"},{"id":"3681049","text":"Rumblefish were a UK indie pop group, formed in Birmingham in 1986.

Produced at the height of the Second World War, the film was intended as a morale booster for American troops and their families. Plot The film is essentially a two-part program. The first half consists of a romantic comedy storyline involving an aerialist, played by Gene Kelly, who is drafted into the US Army but really wants to join the air force. During training, he falls in love with Kathryn (played by Kathryn Grayson), the daughter of his commanding officer, who has similarly put her singing career on hold in order to serve by providing entertainment for the troops. Unusually for this type of a film (and for this era of Hollywood), the character Kathryn has only recently met her father for the first time since she was a baby, her parents having divorced. A related subplot has Kathryn conniving to get her parents (played by John Boles and Mary Astor) to reconcile. During the first part of the film, Grayson sings several numbers and Kelly performs one of his most famous routines, dancing with a mop as a partner. The secondary plot involves preparations for a major live show for the soldiers which will feature many MGM musical and comedy stars. For the second half of the film, all pretenses of a storyline are effectively abandoned as the film instead becomes a variety showcase of comedy, song, and dance, with all of the performers (save Kelly and Grayson) appearing as themselves. The show portion is hosted by Mickey Rooney. Cast * Kathryn Grayson as Kathryn Jones * Gene Kelly as Private Eddie Marsh * Mary Astor as Hyllary Jones * John Boles as Colonel Bill Jones * Ben Blue as Chuck Polansky * Frances Rafferty as Marie Corbino * Mary Elliott as Helen Corbino * Frank Jenks as Sergeant Koslack * Frank Sully as Alan * Dick Simmons as Captain Fred Avery * Ben Lessy as Silent Monk * Sara Haden as Second Nurse Guest stars Performing as \\"guest stars\\" in the film's show segment were: Judy Garland, Lena Horne, Red Skelton, Ann Sothern, Lucille Ball, Frank Morgan, Virginia O'Brien, Eleanor Powell, Marilyn Maxwell, June Allyson, Gloria DeHaven, Donna Reed, Margaret O'Brien, the Kay Kyser Orchestra and others. Pianist-conductor Jos√© Iturbi appears as himself in both segments of the film; this was his first acting role in a film and he would go on to make several more appearances (usually playing himself) in MGM musicals. Musical numbers Highlights included a performance of \\"Let Me Call You Sweetheart\\" by Kelly and a mop, \\"Honeysuckle Rose\\" by Horne and Benny Carter's band, a tap dance solo by Powell (making her first color film and her final MGM movie until 1950's Duchess of Idaho), Kay Kyser's band delivering a frantic and humorous medley of \\"I Dug a Ditch in Wichita\\"/\\"Should I?\\", and a Garland performance (with classical pianist Jose Iturbi) of Roger Edens' \\"The Joint is Really Jumpin' in Carnegie Hall\\" which includes an early use of the word \\"rock\\" in a musical sense. In the phone scene with Grayson, Iturbi performs an excerpt from Franz Liszt's Rhapsodie #11. \\"I Dug a Ditch in Wichita\\", a song told from the point of view of a soldier who used to dig ditches, is the movie's underlying theme song, performed several times in the film with different arrangements and approaches, climaxing in the above-mentioned Kay Kyser performance which runs four and a half minutes and showcases several of his featured performers and including a few verses of another song, \\"Would I?\\". Grayson also sings a version, using an exaggerated (and out-of-character) \\"cowboy\\" accent, and Kelly dances to an instrumental version, using a mop as a partner. After a brief resumption (and resolution) of the earlier storyline, the film ends with Grayson leading an international chorus of men (the United Nations Chorus) in a song pleading for world peace. The song, entitled \\"United Nations on the March\\", actually predates the establishment of the United Nations political body by two years, but not the Declaration by United Nations which was made on 1 January 1942. The song used music by Dmitri Shostakovich from his famous \\"Song of the Counterplan\\" (the title song for the 1932 movie Counterplan), but an English-language text had nothing to do with the original Russian lyrics. Due to misinterpretation of the name of the song's American version, some popular Russian media (e.g. Lenta.ru) reported that Shostakovich composed \\"the official UN Anthem\\". Reception According to MGM records the film earned $3,751,000 in the US and Canada and $2,135,000 elsewhere resulting in a profit of $2,228,000. The New York Times : \\"a veritable grab-bag of delights. Musically there is something for all tastes, from Jose Iturbi to boogie-woogie, from Kathryn Grayson and Sempra Libera to Judy Garland and The Joint is Really Jumping!. It would have been easy for Metro's labour to result in a top-heavy production under a less resourceful producer than Joe Pasternak. His steadying hand is quite evident.\\" The New York Herald Tribune : \\"a prodigal and sumptuous picture. It is [Gene] Kelly who saves the picture from being merely a parade of personalities - Judy Garland is attractive as she gets Iturbi to bang out some swing rhythms on the piano. - George Sidney has staged it expansively.\\"Films of Judy Garland, pp. 115-116, Joe Morella and Edward Epstein, Cadillac publishing, 1969 Awards The film was nominated for three Academy Awards; Best Cinematography, Best Score and Best Art Direction (Cedric Gibbons, Daniel B.

Early years Echevarr√≠a was born and raised in the small town of Pe√±uelas, Puerto Rico. She became interested in sports during her primary and secondary educational years. She was an active participant in the sports of track and field during her high school years and established several school records. However, she did not know how to play and never participated in the game that in the future would gave her fame and glory in Puerto Rico, softball. Echevarr√≠a received a scholarship from the Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico, located in the neighboring city of Ponce and joined that institution's track and field team. She studied physical education and took a course on softball.

History The traditional representative system in Morocco was organized through traditional structures such as the ulema assembly by cities and regions, or the Jemaa assembly within the tribes. These structures were not elected, but nominated through a cooptation system. From 1880, Morocco began a range of reforms to adapt its institutions to modern standards. Among these reforms the creation of the position of grand vizier, having a structured and durable cabinet, with six ministries, including foreign affairs, finance, defense etc. In the process, the Sultan Abdelaziz decided to create a consultative assembly in 1904, which he named Majlis el Aayane (). It is this assembly that summoned the international conference of Algeciras, and that drafted the constitution of 1908, which never entered into force because of the political unrests. The Majlis el Ayane was dissolved in 1913, as a result of the Treaty of Fes, which established the French Protectorate. But since 1947, on impulse Erik Labonne, Resident General of France in Morocco, and the Sultan Muhammad V, the protectorate creates consultative chambers reserved for Moroccans, Jews and Muslims. These elected chambers, through the elections of 1947 and 1951, were in reality only a weak response of the protectorate system to the nationalists claims expressed en 1944 manifesto of independence. The Istiqlal who accept to participate in the 1947 elections, earning three elected representatives, eventually boycott the 1951 elections. At the end of 1955, and after the return from exile of Sultan Mohammed V, November 16, and the victory of nationalists, Morocco adopted in a first step, a non-elected parliament, resulting from consultations with the main political parties to lay the foundations for future elections. The first chamber was chaired by Mehdi Ben Barka. The first Moroccan Constitution adopted in 1963 created a bicameral parliament consisting of the House of Representatives and House of Councillors. The 1970 Constitution abandon bicameralism and opts for a single room. The 1992 Constitution allows elected to create committees of inquiries. Under the state of emergency, the Head of State (in this case the King of Morocco) may dissolve Parliament, \\"the state of exception does not cause the dissolution of parliament\\" ( Article 35, paragraph 2 of the 1972 constitution revised in 1996). During the years of lead - under the reign of Hassan II - the right was quite improperly invoked, since the first and only state of emergency that gripped the Morocco lasted five years, from June 1965 to July 1970. However, constitutions adopted after that date contained many restrictions of public freedoms, close to the state of emergency. Until 1977, no elected parliament has completed its term. Composition Since 1996, the national legislature has become bicameral and has therefore two parliamentary chambers: * The House of Representatives or the lower house. 395 members elected directly for a five-year term. * The House of Councillorss 120 members are elected indirectly for a six-year term by two sets of electoral colleges. The Members of Parliament come from Morocco and the Moroccan-held parts of Western Sahara (under Moroccan law treated as the Southern Provinces). Reserve power Part of the reserve powers, the head of State (in this case the King of Morocco) has the right to dissolve the Parliament. In the past, during the \\"years of lead\\" under King Hassan II, this right was used extensively, along with suspensions and extensions of terms. Thus, until 1997, not a single elected Parliament was able to complete its term under normal circumstances. Role The role of Parliament, and the respect of the monarchy for its integrity, has increased considerably since 1999, when Mohammed VI took the throne. However, the power of Parliament is still being limited as it is the King who appoints the prime minister and on proposition from the latter, the members of government.

An interrogation scene is a form of BDSM roleplay in which the participants act out the parts of torturer and victim. As in real life torture chambers throughout the world over, the \\"torturer\\" uses threats, humiliation and physical pain to extract whatever information he/she believes the \\"victim\\" possesses. The game is over when the victim has broken and divulged the secret. The length and severity of the scene will vary according to the temperament of the players. Dedicated players attempt to replicate the atmosphere of a real torture session and, as in real life, the \\"victim\\" can expect to be stripped naked, tied up, mocked and abused. Popular methods of play in interrogation scenes include tickle torture, where the victim will be tied up and tickled continuously without relief (particularly in areas that are quite sensitive; such as the belly, underarms, feet, toes, nipples and genitalia) until the victim submits and reveals the information. One form of torture is orgasm control or erotic sexual denial, where the submissive victim is sexually stimulated to the brink of orgasm by the torturer. The torturer may then reduce the stimulation and keep the victim in a state of extended arousal for a long period of time. By varying the pace of the stimulation, the victim may be forced to undergo cycles of \\"up\\" and \\"down\\" arousal by the torturer. When satisfied with the experience, the victim may divulge the secret in order to be brought to the desired orgasm by the torturer. The interrogation may be continued past the orgasm, particularly if the victim orgasms without divulging the secret. Generally, the glans becomes very sensitive after orgasm, and continued stimulation may manifest more as an extreme tickling sensation. This can become quite uncomfortable for the victim, or perhaps even painful, providing them with an incentive to comply with the torturer's demands. In at least one legal case, interrogation fantasies have been raised as a defense to a civil lawsuit.Strip search prank call scam  References  Category:BDSM terminology ","title":"Interrogation scene"},{"id":"3681130","text":"The dorsal longitudinal fasciculus (DLF) (not to be confused with the medial longitudinal fasciculus, nor the superior longitudinal fasciculus) is a white matter fiber tract located within the brain stem, specifically in the dorsal brainstem tegmentum.

The DLF, carries both ascending and descending fibers, and conveys visceral motor and sensory signals. Ascending fibers The DLF ascending tract has its origins in nuclei of the reticular formation. These fibers synapse onto the hypothalamus and carry visceral information to the brain. Brainstem afferents in DLF include fibers coming from the parabrachial area, which conveys taste & general visceral sensation to the hypothalamus from the nucleus of the tractus solitarius in the medulla. Afferents distribute to the posterior nucleus and periventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus. Descending fibers The descending portion of the DLF originates in the hypothalamus. These fibers then descend through the brain stem periaqueductal gray matter along the base of the fourth ventricle. These fibers continue on into the spinal cord where they synapse with preganglionic autonomic neurons. Hypothalamic efferents in DLF arise from the paraventricular nucleus, supraoptic nucleus and periventricular nucleus, and send information to multiple areas, including: :1) midbrain central gray for pain modulation, :2) the medullary autonomic centers for heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration, :3) the ventral tegmental area, :4) brainstem parasympathetic nuclei (dorsal motor nucleus of the Vagus and salivatory nuclei for the eyes), :5) thoraco-lumbar preganglionic sympathetic neurons, and :6) lumbo-sacral preganglionic parasympathetic neurons. Note that at least some of the output from the hypothalamus lies outside of the DLF, within a set of Descending Hypothalamic Fibers running next to the spinothalamic tract; lesions of this area canonically lead to ipsilateral Horner's syndrome.

The film stars Scott Bakula, H√©ctor Elizondo, Robert Loggia, and Harley Jane Kozak. Co-stars include Larry Miller, Sinbad, Jason Bateman, Kathy Ireland, Rob Schneider, and Fred Dalton Thompson. The film touches on an up-and-coming season at the fictional higher learning institution of Texas State University and its football team nicknamed the Fightin' Armadillos. (At the time the film was made, there was no Texas State University, but in 2003, Southwest Texas State University changed its name to Texas State University, nicknamed the Bobcats, which coincidentally was the \\"season opener\\" opponent of the fictional Texas State Armadillos.) The once- powerful Armadillos are forced to start the season with a host of new coaches and players after the previous staff and all but one players are banned following a scandal. This predicament is based on the \\"death penalty\\" handed out to the Southern Methodist University football team for violations very similar to the ones found at the fictional Texas State. Plot The Texas State University Fightin' Armadillos were once one of the most powerful teams in college football. After winning consecutive conference and national championships, massive NCAA violations resulted in the program having to forfeit years' worth of victories. All of the coaches were fired and all of the players are banned from returning and expelled from college except Charlie Banks, the only \\"clean\\" player, who never got to play despite having \\"heart\\". This move forces new head coach Ed \\"Straight Arrow\\" Gennero (Elizondo) to build an almost entirely new team with little assistance. No athletic scholarships are available, forcing them to hold tryouts. Along with this, they must worry about Dean Phillip Elias (Miller), who wants the team to fail so he can scrap it due to the corruption the football program has caused over the years, and funnel the funding into his own pocket. The coaches soon have a makeshift team in place. Due to Dean Elias declaring many prospective players ineligible, only 17 players are allowed on the team‚Äînot enough for separate offensive and defensive squads. The Armadillos are thus forced to play ironman football. The team lacks experience and talent in all areas, especially at quarterback, placekicker, and the defensive line. Assistant coach Wally \\"Rig\\" Riggendorf (Loggia) finds Paul Blake (Bakula), a 34-year-old high school star who never attended college due to his father's death. Rig convinces him to enroll and become the Armadillos' quarterback. Blake arrives on campus and catches everyone's attention due to his age, especially Professor Carter (Kozak). Blake then recruits a graduate student teaching assistant named Andre Krimm (Sinbad), who is also enrolled at the school and still has some eligibility remaining. Blake convinces him to join, and he is positioned on the defensive line, where he excelled years earlier. Even with the new members, the team is unable to win. Carter tells Blake that she knows him from years earlier. Carter's ex-boyfriend was a high school football star, but Blake and his team humiliated him and his team in a championship game. This episode actually caused Carter to become infatuated with Blake. Now, years after the fact, the two begin a romantic relationship which Dean Elias opposes due to their student-teacher dynamic‚Äînot to mention Elias' own lascivious interest in Carter. Coach Rig makes one more recruiting move to secure a kicker. He shocks everybody by selecting Lucy Draper (Ireland) from the school's women's soccer team. When she is brought on board, the team has its first taste of success, as Draper kicks a field goal in a driving rainstorm to forge a 3‚Äì3 tie with Kansas (in real life, Kansas holds the all-time NCAA Division I-A record for number of tie games with 57Total Football Stats.com Division I-A All-Time Wins). After this game, Blake quits the team after arguments with Gennero and Carter, but convinces himself to come back after a teammate Edison, who is also quitting, inadvertently changes his mind and both come back. Dean Elias barges into Carter's office after end-of-term exams, first coming onto her as a distraction from him tampering with the team's grades (to sabotage their eligibility for the final game), but she plays along momentarily before warning him that if one grade changes, she'll report him to the University President. With the coaches and players now on the same page, the team plays their last game of the season against the number one ranked team in the state of Texas, the University of Texas Colts, with whom the Armadillos were involved in a barroom brawl earlier in the season. They head into the game as huge underdogs, and without Gennero, who is hospitalized just before the game for a potential heart attack, leaving Coach Rig in charge. After a horrible first half, they rally in the second half to cut the deficit to one, and Gennero returns to the sideline, having only suffered from indigestion, though he lets Coach Rig call the final play. Minutes before the final touchdown, after learning about his scheme to get rid of the football program (and his sexual harassment of Carter), TSU president Purcell fires Dean Elias, though not before the entire Armadillo defensive line runs him down. The team decides to try to win it all with a two-point conversion. They fake a point after attempt and pass for two. Blake scrambles and finally finds Banks in the end zone to win the game.

Azle, Dallas, Fort Worth, and Denton were the primary locations used for filming. The University of North Texas in Denton, specifically Fouts Field, which was then UNT's football stadium, was a major location for filming football and college scenes. Texas State's green and white uniforms in the movie are exactly the same colors worn by North Texas. Texas State's helmet logo, a large \\"T\\" flanked by a smaller \\"s\\" and \\"u\\", is a nod to the Texas Southern University Tigers, whose helmet logo is a large \\"T\\" flanked by a smaller \\"s\\" and \\"u\\". During one scene, when the team takes part in a scrimmage game with a team of convicts, cameos are made by several NFL players. These players included Jerry Rice, Roger Craig, Earl Campbell, Dick Butkus, Ben Davidson, Tony Dorsett, Ed 'Too Tall' Jones, Herschel Walker, Jim Kelly, and Randy White. The film also has some cameo appearances from Chris Berman and Evander Holyfield. Reception The film was released on September 27, 1991, and went on to gross over $26 million at the box office. The film earned an approval rating of 33% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 30 reviews. The consensus states: \\"This likable, goofy football comedy has its moments, but it ultimately adheres too closely to the sports movie playbook to overcome the cliches in the script.\\" The film was released in the United Kingdom on March 27, 1992, and failed to reach the Top 10. The Los Angeles Times called it \\"a genial, slight, entirely predictable football comedy\\". Roger Ebert wrote a more positive review, giving the film three out of four stars. Ebert stated that the film is predictable but does not pretend to be anything more than entertainment. Legacy In an unusual coincidence, Southwest Texas State University, the real team that is the fictional Texas State's first opponent in the film, was renamed Texas State University several years after the film was released. Prior to the renaming a \\"Texas State University\\" did not exist. The real Texas State's Bobcats (as opposed to the fictional Fighting Armadillos) now compete at the FBS (Div 1) level, the same level as the fictional Texas State.

It runs north-south between the northern elevated roundabout junction with the western end of Westway (A40) and the southern Holland Park Roundabout. It opened in 1970, together with Westway. The WCR was formerly the M41 motorway. Its status was downgraded to an A-road in 2000 when responsibility for trunk roads in Greater London was transferred from the Highways Agency to the Greater London Authority. Approximately halfway along the road's length a new junction was built to serve the Westfield London shopping development. The WCR was originally the designation for the western section of Ringway 1, the innermost circuit of the London Ringways network, a complex and comprehensive plan for a network of high-speed roads circling central London designed to manage and control the flow of traffic within the capital. The road would have run from Battersea to Harlesden and would have paralleled the National Rail West London Line as an elevated road. Although the road no longer has motorway status, pedal cycles are prohibited by a sign at Holland Park roundabout. Context :See London Ringways for a detailed history The WCR and the other roads planned in the 1960s for central London had developed from early schemes prior to the Second World War through Sir Patrick Abercrombie's County of London Plan, 1943 and Greater London Plan, 1944 to a 1960s Greater London Council (GLC) scheme that would have involved the construction of many miles of motorway-standard roads across the city and demolition on a massive scale. Due to the huge construction costs and widespread public opposition, most of the scheme was cancelled in 1973 and the WCR, Westway and the East Cross Route in east London were the only significant parts to be built. At the northern end, had the road been built in full, the entry and exit ramps to and from the elevated roundabout with the Westway would have been slip roads. The main route would have continued north beneath the roundabout into North Kensington and on to the junction with the North Cross Route at Harlesden. The alignment of the slip roads leaves a wide space between for the unbuilt carriageway. On the north side of the roundabout, two short stubs indicate the starting point of the slip roads that would have been provided for traffic joining or leaving the northern section of the WCR. South of the Holland Park roundabout, which the WCR would have passed above on a flyover, the route would have continued along the alignment of the West London Line passing over Kensington (Olympia) station to a westbound-only interchange with the A4 at Talgarth Road. It would then have been elevated over Earls Court Exhibition Centre, skirted the western edge of Brompton Cemetery, and passed by Stamford Bridge stadium before an eastbound-only interchange along Lots Road to meet Cheyne Walk. Next the WCR would have crossed the River Thames on a new bridge and entered Battersea where it would have had a junction with the South Cross Route. Plan of the London Motorway Box scheme from mid-1960s showing the West Cross Route as built and as planned Reclaim the Streets street party On 13 July 1996, around 6,000 protesters took over part of the elevated motorway for over eight hours from around midday, played sound-systems and danced in a protest organised by the direct action collective Reclaim the Streets. Sand was placed on the motorway for young children to play on, and a banner carrying the Situationist International slogan \\"The Society That Abolishes Every Adventure Makes Its Own Abolition the Only Possible Adventure\\" was raised. Hidden underneath dancers walking on stilts and wearing huge, wire-supported dresses, environmental activists drilled holes in the tarmac and planted trees.RTS: Street Party '96 See also *Homes before Roads References Bibliography * Asher, Wayne. 2018.

The structure was generally associated with the Burnett of Leys family. The property itself was owned by the Barclay family from the 13th century, at which time a tower house structure was erected. In 1593, the Laird was James Strachan, and thence it passed into the Irvine family and thereafter the Burnetts of Leys. There is a notable datestone adornment on the structure with the arms of Irvine impaling the arms of Douglas with initials R.E. and I.E. and dated 1635, representing the 17th- century couple who reconstructed the house, Robert Ervine (sic) and Ilizabeth Ervine (sic). Monboddo House, with its crow-stepped gable design, is situated in the Howe of Mearns near the village of Auchenblae approximately nine miles (14 km) from the North Sea. The original landholding of the Monboddo Estate was approximately 200 km¬≤. In 1714 the well known judge and philosopher James Burnett, Lord Monboddo was born in Monboddo House. Lord Monboddo is renowned for his service as a member of the Court of Session, an author of several works during the Scottish Enlightenment and a precursive contributor to the theory of evolution. When he was appointed to the Court of Sessions, Burnett took the title of his father's estate, Monboddo House. In 1773 the author Samuel Johnson, accompanied by James Boswell, visited Monboddo House to call upon James Burnett. It is a category B listed building.  Interior detail  Lord Monboddo's original inkwell circa 1760 preserved intact to present day Monboddo House fell into a state of disrepair as of the 1960s; nevertheless, a number of notable features remain. With repairs made during the latter part of the 20th century and the good maintenance of the owner as of 2006, the structure is in excellent condition. A well proportioned Hall is on the first floor (second floor in American vernacular), which has relics of early panelling. The Hall is provided with two garderobes. While the basement has no vaulting, the westernmost basement chamber is the old kitchen, containing a very large fireplace arch. An interior stone spiral staircase is found in an ascending clockwise manner characteristic of defensive designs of towerhouses of the 14th century. Two eight centimeter diameter gun loops are found within the 80 centimeter thick Old Red Sandstone exterior walls (Hogan, 2006). The front porch is extant, known for the location where Lord Monboddo would take his early morning cold water bath in the open air in the mid-18th century. Other nearby famous noble homes in northeast Scotland built by the Burnetts of Leys are Crathes Castle and Muchalls Castle. There is extant considerable genealogical data concerning the Burnett of Leys family (see particularly G. Burnett, 1901, and Bailey et al., 2005).  Setting details  The surrounding countryside is fertile agricultural land producing grains and providing grazing for cattle. Topographically the region is composed of very gently rolling terrain quite suitable for agriculture. In the 18th century the estate would have amounted to approximately 190 square kilometres. While there were numerous smaller residences on the estate from the 18th century on, in the 19th and 20th century more development has taken place closer to Monboddo House in the form of several single family residences. The estate has a peaceful setting being several kilometres from the nearest dual carriageway, the A90. Sound levels were measured at the estate to be in the range of 48 to 53 dBA.  Twentieth century  In 1930 a postcard of Monboddo House was created by G. Arthur Dixon. After Burnett ownership ceased in the early 1960s the estate fell into disrepair, a situation that has been reversed. As of 2006 the home is in a good state of conservation and repair. The owner reported that there is considerable current interest in the house from people around the world with an interest in Lord Monboddo; particular interest derives not only from researchers in the United Kingdom but also Japan and the United States. Monboddo House is less frequently referred to as Monboddo Castle. James Malcolm Burnett, the last laird of Monboddo, had no children of his own, but had one stepson, who now lives in Canada.

Life  The son of James the Gross, 7th Earl of Douglas, by his wife Lady Beatrice Sinclair, daughter to Henry II Sinclair, Earl of Orkney; Douglas was a twin, the older by a few minutes, the younger being Archibald Douglas, Earl of Moray. He succeeded to the earldom on the murder of his brother William Douglas, 8th Earl of Douglas by King James II and his entourage. He denounced his brother's murderers and took up arms against the king, and he and his brothers attacked Stirling, driving a horse through the town with the safe conduct given to William attached to its tail. He was forced to back down when some allies deserted him. He obtained a papal dispensation to marry his brother's widow, Margaret Douglas, Fair Maid of Galloway, in order to keep the family estates together. (It is not entirely clear that this marriage ever took place, but it was certainly planned.) He was involved in intrigues with the English court, and in 1455 rebelled against James II once more. Meanwhile, another branch of the Douglas family, known as the Red Douglases, had risen into importance, and George Douglas, 4th Earl of Angus, great-grandson of the first earl of Douglas, took sides with the king against the Earl of Douglas. Douglas, again deserted by his chief allies, fled to England, and his three younger brothers, Hugh Douglas, Earl of Ormonde, Archibald Douglas, Earl of Moray, and John Douglas, Lord of Balvenie, were defeated at the Battle of Arkinholm, near Langholm on the Esk, possibly by Angus. Moray was killed, Ormonde taken prisoner and executed, and Balvenie escaped to England. Their last stronghold, Threave Castle in Galloway, fell. James Douglas was attainted in 1455, and his lands and estates were forfeit to the crown. The lands of the Douglases were divided among their rivals, the lordship of Douglas falling to the Red Douglas 4th earl of Angus. From England, the Earl of Douglas continued to intrigue against James III of Scotland; he was employed by Edward IV in 1461 to negotiate a league at Ardtornish with the western highlanders to take the nine-year old's kingdom for England. At some point he was made a Knight of the Garter. Following his attainder his first wife divorced him (if they ever married) so he married again to Anne Holland, daughter of John Holland, 2nd Duke of Exeter. In 1484 he was taken prisoner at the battle of Lochmaben Fair, and was relegated to Lindores Abbey, where he died in or after 1491.

The garden is home to over 100 roses and hosts over a dozen weddings annually. All roses are organically maintained. In the winter and spring of 2006 the City of SeaTac and the State of Washington funded the relocation of the historic Seike Japanese Garden to the Highline Botanical Garden site. The Seike Garden, built in 1961 as a war memorial to a fallen son, was designed by Shintaro Okada of Hiroshima. Over $350,000 was spent relocating the garden's bridges, massive stones, and hand-candled pines. The Seike Garden was re-dedicated in June 2006. The Sensory Garden, designed by Barker Landscape Architects from a concept by Greg Butler, was added in 2008. This garden is planned to delight all the senses, and contains a rain garden, tunnels of vines, and an exotic array of fragrant, tactile, and textural plantings. Currently (as of August, 2008) in the design and discussion phase are a Natural Yard Care Garden based on King County's Natural Yard Care program and designed by Doug Rice, and a display bed for the Puget Sound Fuchsia Society. Long term plans include a Children's Garden, a Pea Patch, and more.

Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF or NNMF), also non-negative matrix approximation is a group of algorithms in multivariate analysis and linear algebra where a matrix is factorized into (usually) two matrices and , with the property that all three matrices have no negative elements. This non-negativity makes the resulting matrices easier to inspect. Also, in applications such as processing of audio spectrograms or muscular activity, non-negativity is inherent to the data being considered. Since the problem is not exactly solvable in general, it is commonly approximated numerically. NMF finds applications in such fields as astronomy, computer vision, document clustering, missing data imputation, chemometrics, audio signal processing, recommender systems, and bioinformatics.  History  In chemometrics non-negative matrix factorization has a long history under the name \\"self modeling curve resolution\\". In this framework the vectors in the right matrix are continuous curves rather than discrete vectors. Also early work on non-negative matrix factorizations was performed by a Finnish group of researchers in the 1990s under the name positive matrix factorization. It became more widely known as non-negative matrix factorization after Lee and Seung investigated the properties of the algorithm and published some simple and useful algorithms for two types of factorizations.  Background  Let matrix be the product of the matrices and , :\\\\mathbf{V} = \\\\mathbf{W} \\\\mathbf{H} \\\\,. Matrix multiplication can be implemented as computing the column vectors of as linear combinations of the column vectors in using coefficients supplied by columns of . That is, each column of can be computed as follows: :\\\\mathbf{v}_i = \\\\mathbf{W} \\\\mathbf{h}_{i} \\\\,, where is the -th column vector of the product matrix and is the -th column vector of the matrix . When multiplying matrices, the dimensions of the factor matrices may be significantly lower than those of the product matrix and it is this property that forms the basis of NMF. NMF generates factors with significantly reduced dimensions compared to the original matrix. For example, if is an matrix, is an matrix, and is a matrix then can be significantly less than both and . Here is an example based on a text-mining application: * Let the input matrix (the matrix to be factored) be with 10000 rows and 500 columns where words are in rows and documents are in columns. That is, we have 500 documents indexed by 10000 words. It follows that a column vector in represents a document. * Assume we ask the algorithm to find 10 features in order to generate a features matrix with 10000 rows and 10 columns and a coefficients matrix with 10 rows and 500 columns. * The product of and is a matrix with 10000 rows and 500 columns, the same shape as the input matrix and, if the factorization worked, it is a reasonable approximation to the input matrix . * From the treatment of matrix multiplication above it follows that each column in the product matrix is a linear combination of the 10 column vectors in the features matrix with coefficients supplied by the coefficients matrix . This last point is the basis of NMF because we can consider each original document in our example as being built from a small set of hidden features. NMF generates these features. It is useful to think of each feature (column vector) in the features matrix as a document archetype comprising a set of words where each word's cell value defines the word's rank in the feature: The higher a word's cell value the higher the word's rank in the feature. A column in the coefficients matrix represents an original document with a cell value defining the document's rank for a feature. We can now reconstruct a document (column vector) from our input matrix by a linear combination of our features (column vectors in ) where each feature is weighted by the feature's cell value from the document's column in .  Clustering property  NMF has an inherent clustering property, i.e., it automatically clusters the columns of input data \\\\mathbf{V} = (v_1, \\\\cdots, v_n) . More specifically, the approximation of \\\\mathbf{V} by \\\\mathbf{V} \\\\simeq \\\\mathbf{W}\\\\mathbf{H} is achieved by finding W and H that minimize the error function  V - WH _F, subject to W \\\\geq 0, H \\\\geq 0. If we furthermore impose an orthogonality constraint on \\\\mathbf{H} , i.e. \\\\mathbf{H}\\\\mathbf{H}^T = I , then the above minimization is mathematically equivalent to the minimization of K-means clustering . Furthermore, the computed H gives the cluster membership, i.e., if \\\\mathbf{H}_{kj} > \\\\mathbf{H}_{ij} for all i ‚â† k, this suggests that the input data v_j belongs to k^{th} cluster. The computed W gives the cluster centroids, i.e., the k^{th} column gives the cluster centroid of k^{th} cluster. This centroid's representation can be significantly enhanced by convex NMF. When the orthogonality constraint \\\\mathbf{H}\\\\mathbf{H}^T = I is not explicitly imposed, the orthogonality holds to a large extent, and the clustering property holds too. Clustering is the main objective of most data mining applications of NMF. When the error function to be used is Kullback‚ÄìLeibler divergence, NMF is identical to the Probabilistic latent semantic analysis, a popular document clustering method.C Ding, T Li, W Peng, \\" On the equivalence between non-negative matrix factorization and probabilistic latent semantic indexing\\" Computational Statistics & Data Analysis 52, 3913-3927  Types  = Approximate non-negative matrix factorization = Usually the number of columns of and the number of rows of in NMF are selected so the product will become an approximation to . The full decomposition of then amounts to the two non-negative matrices and as well as a residual , such that: . The elements of the residual matrix can either be negative or positive. When and are smaller than they become easier to store and manipulate. Another reason for factorizing into smaller matrices and , is that if one is able to approximately represent the elements of by significantly less data, then one has to infer some latent structure in the data. = Convex non-negative matrix factorization = In standard NMF, matrix factor Ôºå i.e., can be anything in that space. Convex NMFC Ding, T Li, MI Jordan, Convex and semi-nonnegative matrix factorizations, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 32, 45-55, 2010 restricts the columns of to convex combinations of the input data vectors (v_1, \\\\cdots, v_n) . This greatly improves the quality of data representation of . Furthermore, the resulting matrix factor becomes more sparse and orthogonal. = Nonnegative rank factorization = In case the nonnegative rank of is equal to its actual rank, is called a nonnegative rank factorization. The problem of finding the NRF of , if it exists, is known to be NP-hard. = Different cost functions and regularizations = There are different types of non-negative matrix factorizations. The different types arise from using different cost functions for measuring the divergence between and and possibly by regularization of the and/or matrices. Two simple divergence functions studied by Lee and Seung are the squared error (or Frobenius norm) and an extension of the Kullback‚ÄìLeibler divergence to positive matrices (the original Kullback‚ÄìLeibler divergence is defined on probability distributions). Each divergence leads to a different NMF algorithm, usually minimizing the divergence using iterative update rules. The factorization problem in the squared error version of NMF may be stated as: Given a matrix \\\\mathbf{V} find nonnegative matrices W and H that minimize the function : F(\\\\mathbf{W},\\\\mathbf{H}) = \\\\\\\\mathbf{V} - \\\\mathbf{WH}\\\\^2_F Another type of NMF for images is based on the total variation norm. When L1 regularization (akin to Lasso) is added to NMF with the mean squared error cost function, the resulting problem may be called non-negative sparse coding due to the similarity to the sparse coding problem, although it may also still be referred to as NMF. =Online NMF= Many standard NMF algorithms analyze all the data together; i.e., the whole matrix is available from the start. This may be unsatisfactory in applications where there are too many data to fit into memory or where the data are provided in streaming fashion. One such use is for collaborative filtering in recommendation systems, where there may be many users and many items to recommend, and it would be inefficient to recalculate everything when one user or one item is added to the system. The cost function for optimization in these cases may or may not be the same as for standard NMF, but the algorithms need to be rather different.http://www.ijcai.org/papers07/Papers/IJCAI07-432.pdf  Algorithms  There are several ways in which the and may be found: Lee and Seung's multiplicative update rule has been a popular method due to the simplicity of implementation. This algorithm is: :initialize: and non negative. :Then update the values in and by computing the following, with n as an index of the iteration. : \\\\mathbf{H}_{[i,j]}^{n+1} \\\\leftarrow \\\\mathbf{H}_{[i,j]}^n \\\\frac{((\\\\mathbf{W}^n)^T\\\\mathbf{V})_{[i,j]}}{((\\\\mathbf{W}^n)^T\\\\mathbf{W}^n\\\\mathbf{H}^n)_{[i,j]}} :and : \\\\mathbf{W}_{[i,j]}^{n+1} \\\\leftarrow \\\\mathbf{W}_{[i,j]}^n \\\\frac{(\\\\mathbf{V}(\\\\mathbf{H}^{n+1})^T)_{[i,j]}}{(\\\\mathbf{W}^n\\\\mathbf{H}^{n+1}(\\\\mathbf{H}^{n+1})^T)_{[i,j]}} :Until and are stable. Note that the updates are done on an element by element basis not matrix multiplication. We note that the multiplicative factors for and , i.e. the \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{W}^\\\\mathsf{T} \\\\mathbf{V}}{\\\\mathbf{W}^\\\\mathsf{T} \\\\mathbf{W} \\\\mathbf{H}} and {\\\\textstyle {\\\\frac {\\\\mathbf {V} \\\\mathbf {H} ^{\\\\mathsf {T}} }{\\\\mathbf {W} \\\\mathbf {H} \\\\mathbf {H} ^{\\\\mathsf {T}}}}} terms, are matrices of ones when \\\\mathbf{V} = \\\\mathbf{W} \\\\mathbf{H}. More recently other algorithms have been developed. Some approaches are based on alternating non-negative least squares: in each step of such an algorithm, first is fixed and found by a non-negative least squares solver, then is fixed and is found analogously. The procedures used to solve for and may be the same or different, as some NMF variants regularize one of and . Specific approaches include the projected gradient descent methods, the active set method, the optimal gradient method, and the block principal pivoting method among several others. Current algorithms are sub-optimal in that they only guarantee finding a local minimum, rather than a global minimum of the cost function. A provably optimal algorithm is unlikely in the near future as the problem has been shown to generalize the k-means clustering problem which is known to be NP-complete. However, as in many other data mining applications, a local minimum may still prove to be useful. Fractional residual variance (FRV) plots for PCA and sequential NMF; for PCA, the theoretical values are the contribution from the residual eigenvalues. In comparison, the FRV curves for PCA reaches a flat plateau where no signal are captured effectively; while the NMF FRV curves are declining continuously, indicating a better ability to capture signal. The FRV curves for NMF also converges to higher levels than PCA, indicating the less- overfitting property of NMF. = Sequential NMF = The sequential construction of NMF components ( and ) was firstly used to relate NMF with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in astronomy. The contribution from the PCA components are ranked by the magnitude of their corresponding eigenvalues; for NMF, its components can be ranked empirically when they are constructed one by one (sequentially), i.e., learn the (n+1)-th component with the first n components constructed. The contribution of the sequential NMF components can be compared with the Karhunen‚ÄìLo√®ve theorem, an application of PCA, using the plot of eigenvalues. A typical choice of the number of components with PCA is based on the \\"elbow\\" point, then the existence of the flat plateau is indicating that PCA is not capturing the data efficiently, and at last there exists a sudden drop reflecting the capture of random noise and falls into the regime of overfitting. For sequential NMF, the plot of eigenvalues is approximated by the plot of the fractional residual variance curves, where the curves decreases continuously, and converge to a higher level than PCA, which is the indication of less over-fitting of sequential NMF. = Exact NMF = Exact solutions for the variants of NMF can be expected (in polynomial time) when additional constraints hold for matrix . A polynomial time algorithm for solving nonnegative rank factorization if contains a monomial sub matrix of rank equal to its rank was given by Campbell and Poole in 1981. Kalofolias and Gallopoulos (2012) solved the symmetric counterpart of this problem, where is symmetric and contains a diagonal principal sub matrix of rank r. Their algorithm runs in time in the dense case. Arora, Ge, Halpern, Mimno, Moitra, Sontag, Wu, & Zhu (2013) give a polynomial time algorithm for exact NMF that works for the case where one of the factors W satisfies a separability condition.  Relation to other techniques  In Learning the parts of objects by non-negative matrix factorization Lee and Seung proposed NMF mainly for parts-based decomposition of images. It compares NMF to vector quantization and principal component analysis, and shows that although the three techniques may be written as factorizations, they implement different constraints and therefore produce different results. generated from a probability distribution with mean \\\\sum_a W_{ia}h_a. It was later shown that some types of NMF are an instance of a more general probabilistic model called \\"multinomial PCA\\". When NMF is obtained by minimizing the Kullback‚ÄìLeibler divergence, it is in fact equivalent to another instance of multinomial PCA, probabilistic latent semantic analysis, trained by maximum likelihood estimation. That method is commonly used for analyzing and clustering textual data and is also related to the latent class model. NMF with the least-squares objective is equivalent to a relaxed form of K-means clustering: the matrix factor contains cluster centroids and contains cluster membership indicators.C. Ding, X. He, H.D. Simon (2005). \\"On the Equivalence of Nonnegative Matrix Factorization and Spectral Clustering\\". Proc. SIAM Int'l Conf. Data Mining, pp. 606-610. May 2005Ron Zass and Amnon Shashua (2005). \\"A Unifying Approach to Hard and Probabilistic Clustering\\". International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) Beijing, China, Oct., 2005. This provides a theoretical foundation for using NMF for data clustering. However, k-means does not enforce non-negativity on its centroids, so the closest analogy is in fact with \\"semi-NMF\\". NMF can be seen as a two-layer directed graphical model with one layer of observed random variables and one layer of hidden random variables. NMF extends beyond matrices to tensors of arbitrary order. This extension may be viewed as a non- negative counterpart to, e.g., the PARAFAC model. Other extensions of NMF include joint factorization of several data matrices and tensors where some factors are shared. Such models are useful for sensor fusion and relational learning. NMF is an instance of nonnegative quadratic programming (NQP), just like the support vector machine (SVM). However, SVM and NMF are related at a more intimate level than that of NQP, which allows direct application of the solution algorithms developed for either of the two methods to problems in both domains.  Uniqueness  The factorization is not unique: A matrix and its inverse can be used to transform the two factorization matrices by, e.g., : \\\\mathbf{WH} = \\\\mathbf{WBB}^{-1}\\\\mathbf{H} If the two new matrices \\\\mathbf{\\\\tilde{W} = WB} and \\\\mathbf{\\\\tilde{H}}=\\\\mathbf{B}^{-1}\\\\mathbf{H} are non-negative they form another parametrization of the factorization. The non- negativity of \\\\mathbf{\\\\tilde{W}} and \\\\mathbf{\\\\tilde{H}} applies at least if is a non-negative monomial matrix. In this simple case it will just correspond to a scaling and a permutation. More control over the non-uniqueness of NMF is obtained with sparsity constraints.  Applications  = Astronomy = In astronomy, NMF is a promising method for dimension reduction in the sense that astrophysical signals are non-negative. NMF has been applied to the spectroscopic observations and the direct imaging observations as a method to study the common properties of astronomical objects and post-process the astronomical observations. The advances in the spectroscopic observations by Blanton & Roweis (2007) takes into account of the uncertainties of astronomical observations, which is later improved by Zhu (2016) where missing data are also considered and parallel computing is enabled. Their method is then adopted by Ren et al. (2018) to the direct imaging field as one of the methods of detecting exoplanets, especially for the direct imaging of circumstellar disks. Ren et al. (2018) are able to prove the stability of NMF components when they are constructed sequentially (i.e., one by one), which enables the linearity of the NMF modeling process; the linearity property is used to separate the stellar light and the light scattered from the exoplanets and circumstellar disks. In direct imaging, to reveal the faint exoplanets and circumstellar disks from bright the surrounding stellar lights, which has a typical contrast from 10‚Åµ to 10¬π‚Å∞, various statistical methods have been adopted, however the light from the exoplanets or circumstellar disks are usually over-fitted, where forward modeling have to be adopted to recover the true flux. Forward modeling is currently optimized for point sources, however not for extended sources, especially for irregularly shaped structures such as circumstellar disks. In this situation, NMF has been an excellent method, being less over-fitting in the sense of the non-negativity and sparsity of the NMF modeling coefficients, therefore forward modeling can be performed with a few scaling factors, rather than a computationally intensive data re-reduction on generated models. = Data imputation = To impute missing data in statistics, NMF can take missing data while minimizing its cost function, rather than treating these missing data as zeros. This makes it a mathematically proven method for data imputation in statistics. By first proving that the missing data are ignored in the cost function, then proving that the impact from missing data can be as small as a second order effect, Ren et al. (2020) studied and applied such an approach for the field of astronomy. Their work focuses on two-dimensional matrices, specifically, it includes mathematical derivation, simulated data imputation, and application to on-sky data. The data imputation procedure with NMF can be composed of two steps. First, when the NMF components are known, Ren et al. (2020) proved that impact from missing data during data imputation (\\"target modeling\\" in their study) is a second order effect. Second, when the NMF components are unknown, the authors proved that the impact from missing data during component construction is a first-to-second order effect. Depending on the way that the NMF components are obtained, the former step above can be either independent or dependent from the latter. In addition, the imputation quality can be increased when the more NMF components are used, see Figure 4 of Ren et al. (2020) for their illustration. = Text mining = NMF can be used for text mining applications. In this process, a document-term matrix is constructed with the weights of various terms (typically weighted word frequency information) from a set of documents. This matrix is factored into a term- feature and a feature-document matrix. The features are derived from the contents of the documents, and the feature-document matrix describes data clusters of related documents. One specific application used hierarchical NMF on a small subset of scientific abstracts from PubMed. Another research group clustered parts of the Enron email dataset with 65,033 messages and 91,133 terms into 50 clusters. NMF has also been applied to citations data, with one example clustering English wikipedia articles and scientific journals based on the outbound scientific citations in English wikipedia. Arora, Ge, Halpern, Mimno, Moitra, Sontag, Wu, & Zhu (2013) have given polynomial-time algorithms to learn topic models using NMF. The algorithm assumes that the topic matrix satisfies a separability condition that is often found to hold in these settings. Hassani, Iranmanesh and Mansouri (2019) proposed a feature agglomeration method for term-document matrices which operates using NMF. The algorithm reduces the term-document matrix into a smaller matrix more suitable for text clustering. = Spectral data analysis = NMF is also used to analyze spectral data; one such use is in the classification of space objects and debris. = Scalable Internet distance prediction = NMF is applied in scalable Internet distance (round-trip time) prediction. For a network with N hosts, with the help of NMF, the distances of all the N^2 end-to-end links can be predicted after conducting only O(N) measurements. This kind of method was firstly introduced in Internet Distance Estimation Service (IDES). Afterwards, as a fully decentralized approach, Phoenix network coordinate system is proposed. It achieves better overall prediction accuracy by introducing the concept of weight. = Non-stationary speech denoising = Speech denoising has been a long lasting problem in audio signal processing. There are many algorithms for denoising if the noise is stationary. For example, the Wiener filter is suitable for additive Gaussian noise. However, if the noise is non- stationary, the classical denoising algorithms usually have poor performance because the statistical information of the non-stationary noise is difficult to estimate. Schmidt et al.Schmidt, M.N., J. Larsen, and F.T. Hsiao. (2007). \\"Wind noise reduction using non-negative sparse coding\\", Machine Learning for Signal Processing, IEEE Workshop on, 431‚Äì436 use NMF to do speech denoising under non-stationary noise, which is completely different from classical statistical approaches. The key idea is that clean speech signal can be sparsely represented by a speech dictionary, but non-stationary noise cannot. Similarly, non-stationary noise can also be sparsely represented by a noise dictionary, but speech cannot. The algorithm for NMF denoising goes as follows. Two dictionaries, one for speech and one for noise, need to be trained offline. Once a noisy speech is given, we first calculate the magnitude of the Short-Time-Fourier-Transform. Second, separate it into two parts via NMF, one can be sparsely represented by the speech dictionary, and the other part can be sparsely represented by the noise dictionary. Third, the part that is represented by the speech dictionary will be the estimated clean speech. = Population Genetics = Sparse NMF is used in Population genetics for estimating individual admixture coefficients, detecting genetic clusters of individuals in a population sample or evaluating genetic admixture in sampled genomes. In human genetic clustering, NMF algorithms provide estimates similar to those of the computer program STRUCTURE, but the algorithms are more efficient computationally and allow analysis of large population genomic data sets. = Bioinformatics = NMF has been successfully applied in bioinformatics for clustering gene expression and DNA methylation data and finding the genes most representative of the clusters. In the analysis of cancer mutations it has been used to identify common patterns of mutations that occur in many cancers and that probably have distinct causes. NMF techniques can identify sources of variation such as cell types, disease subtypes, population stratification, tissue composition, and tumor clonality. = Nuclear imaging = NMF, also referred in this field as factor analysis, has been used since the 1980s to analyze sequences of images in SPECT and PET dynamic medical imaging. Non-uniqueness of NMF was addressed using sparsity constraints.  Current research  Current research (since 2010) in nonnegative matrix factorization includes, but is not limited to, # Algorithmic: searching for global minima of the factors and factor initialization. # Scalability: how to factorize million-by-billion matrices, which are commonplace in Web-scale data mining, e.g., see Distributed Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (DNMF), Scalable Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (ScalableNMF), Distributed Stochastic Singular Value Decomposition. # Online: how to update the factorization when new data comes in without recomputing from scratch, e.g., see online CNSC # Collective (joint) factorization: factorizing multiple interrelated matrices for multiple-view learning, e.g. multi-view clustering, see CoNMF and MultiNMF # Cohen and Rothblum 1993 problem: whether a rational matrix always has an NMF of minimal inner dimension whose factors are also rational. Recently, this problem has been answered negatively.

M. Forster. The film stars James Wilby as Maurice, Hugh Grant as Clive and Rupert Graves as Alec. The supporting cast includes Denholm Elliott as Dr Barry, Simon Callow as Mr Ducie, Billie Whitelaw as Mrs Hall, and Ben Kingsley as Lasker-Jones. The film was produced by Ismail Merchant via Merchant Ivory Productions and Film Four International, and written by Ivory and Kit Hesketh-Harvey, with cinematography by Pierre Lhomme. It is a tale of gay love in the restrictive and repressed culture of Edwardian England. The story follows its main character, Maurice Hall, through university, a tumultuous relationship, struggling to fit into society, and ultimately being united with his life partner. Plot During a trip to a windswept beach, Maurice Hall, an 11-year-old schoolboy, receives instructions about the \\"sacred mysteries\\" of sex from his teacher, who wants to explain to the fatherless boy the changes he would experience in puberty. Years later, in 1909, Maurice is attending Cambridge, where he strikes up a friendship with two fellow students: the aristocratic Lord Risley and the rich and handsome Clive Durham. Durham falls in love with his friend and surprises Maurice by confessing his feelings. At first, Maurice reacts with horror. He soon realizes that he reciprocates Durham's feelings. The two friends embark on a passionate love affair but, at Clive's insistence, their relationship remains non-sexual. To go further, in Durham's opinion, would diminish them both. Clive, a member of the upper class, has a promising future ahead of him and does not want to risk losing his social position. Their close relationship continues after Maurice is expelled from Cambridge and begins a new career as a stockbroker in London. The two friends keep their feelings secret but are frightened when Lord Risley is arrested and sentenced to six months at hard labor after soliciting sex from a soldier. Clive, afraid of being exposed as a homosexual, breaks with Maurice. After his return from a trip to Greece, Clive, under pressure from his widowed mother, marries a naive rich girl named Anne and settles into a life of rural domesticity. Heartbroken, Maurice seeks the help of his family physician, Dr. Barry, who dismisses Maurice's doubts as \\"rubbish\\". Maurice then turns to Dr. Lasker-Jones, who tries to cure his homosexual longings with hypnosis. During his visits to Clive's estate of Pendersleigh, Maurice attracts the attention of Alec Scudder, the under- gamekeeper who is due to emigrate with his brother to Argentina. Maurice not only fails to notice Scudder's interest in him, but initially treats him with contempt. This does not discourage Scudder, who spies on Maurice at night. Simcox, the butler at Pendersleigh, suspecting the true nature of Maurice and Clive's past relationship, has hinted to Scudder about Maurice's nature. On a rainy night, Scudder boldly climbs a ladder and enters Maurice's bedroom through an open window. Scudder kisses Maurice, who is completely taken by surprise, but does not resist his advances. After their first night together, Maurice receives a letter from Scudder proposing they meet at the Pendersleigh boathouse. Maurice wrongly believes that Scudder is blackmailing him. Maurice returns to Lasker-Jones, who warns Maurice that England is a country which \\"has always been disinclined to accept human nature\\" and advises he emigrate to a country where homosexuality is no longer criminal, like France or Italy. When Maurice fails to appear at the boathouse, Scudder travels to London and visits him at his offices. Maurice and Scudder meet at the British Museum and the blackmail misunderstanding is resolved. Maurice begins to call Scudder by his first name, Alec. They spend the night together in a hotel room, and as Alec departs in the morning he explains that his departure for Argentina is imminent and they will not see each other again. Maurice goes to the port to give Alec a parting gift only to discover that Alec has missed the sailing. Maurice goes to Pendersleigh and confesses to Clive his love for Alec. Clive, who was hoping that Maurice would marry, is bewildered at Maurice's account of his encounters with Alec. The two friends separate and Maurice goes to the boathouse looking for Alec, who is there waiting for him. Scudder tells him that he sent a telegram to Maurice stating that he was to come to the boathouse. Alec has left his family and abandoned his plans to emigrate in order to stay with Maurice, telling him, \\"Now we shan't never be parted.\\" Meanwhile, Clive is getting ready for bed and briefly reminisces his time with Maurice.

M. Forster wrote Maurice in 1913‚Äì14, and revised it in 1932 and again in 1959‚Äì1960. Written as a traditional Bildungsroman, or novel of character formation, the plot follows the title character as he deals with the problem of coming of age as a homosexual in the restrictive society of the Edwardian era. Forster, who had based his characters on real people, was keen that his novel should have a happy ending.Tomalin, Maurice Film Review, Sight & Sound. Autumn 1987, p. 290 The author did not intend to publish the novel while his mother was alive, but he showed the manuscript to selected friends, such as Christopher Isherwood. Forster resisted publication during his lifetime because of public and legal attitudes to homosexuality. He was also ambivalent about the literary merits of his novel. A note found on the manuscript read: \\"Publishable, but worth it?\\" The novel was only published in 1971 after Forster's death. It is considered one of his minor works, in comparison with his novels Howards End (1910) and A Passage to India (1924). James Ivory was interested in making a screen adaptation after the critical and box office success he achieved with another of Forster's novels, A Room with a View. While involved in this earlier project Ivory had read all of Forster's books, and eventually came to Maurice. \\"I thought,\\" Ivory said, \\"that it was interesting material and would be enjoyable to make ‚Äì and also something we could make in that it wouldn't require too much organization and wouldn't cost all that much.\\" The situation it explores seemed to him to be still relevant: \\"People's turmoil and having to decide for themselves how they want to live and what their true feelings are and whether they're going to live honestly with them or deny them. That's no different. Nothing's any easier, for young people. I felt it was quite relevant.\\"Long, The Films of Merchant Ivory, p. 147 In his will, Forster left the rights to his books to King's College, Cambridge, which has a self-governing board of fellows of the college.Long, James Ivory in Conversation, p. 211 They were initially reluctant to give permission to film Maurice, not because of the subject matter of the novel, but because it was considered an inferior work, and a film that called attention to it would not enhance Forster‚Äôs literary reputation.Long, The Films of Merchant Ivory, p. 150 Ismail Merchant, the producer of the film, conferred with them and was very persuasive. They were favourably impressed with the adaptation by Merchant Ivory Productions of A Room with a View and relented.Long, The Films of Merchant Ivory, p. 151 =Writing= Ivory's usual writing partner, Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, was unavailable because she was busy writing her novel Three Continents. Ivory wrote the screenplay with Kit Hesketh-Harvey, who had become connected with Merchant Ivory Productions through his sister, journalist and author Sarah Sands (born Sarah Harvey), who was then the wife of Julian Sands, the leading man in A Room with a View. Hesketh-Harvey had previously written documentaries for the BBC. He had attended Tonbridge School and Cambridge University, where Forster was educated, and knew the background. Ivory later said, \\"What Kit brought to the script was his social background. He went to Cambridge and a fancy prep school. His knowledge of the British upper middle class, that was incredibly useful ‚Äì the dialect, the speech, the slang, and so many other things. As an American, I could not have possibly written the script without him.\\" Jhabvala reviewed the script and suggested changes.Long, James Ivory in Conversation, p. 212 On her advice, Clive Durham's unconvincing conversion to heterosexuality during a trip to Greece was justified by creating an episode in which Clive's university friend Risley is arrested and imprisoned after a homosexual entrapment, which frightens Clive into marrying. =Casting= Julian Sands, who had played the male lead in Merchant Ivory's previous film, A Room with a View, was originally cast in the title role, but backed out at the last minute. John Malkovich was due to take the role of Lasker-Jones. He had become a friend of Julian Sands while both were making The Killing Fields. After Sands left the project Malkovich lost interest in the film and was replaced by Ben Kingsley.Long, James Ivory in Conversation, p. 213 James Wilby had auditioned for the role of Clive Durham's brother-in-law. When Sands left the project, Ivory considered two unknown actors for the role of Maurice: James Wilby and Julian Wadham. Since he had already cast the dark-haired Hugh Grant as Clive, Ivory decided on the blond James Wilby over the dark-haired Julian Wadham, who was given a role as one of Maurice's stockbroker friends. Hugh Grant, who later found international stardom with Four Weddings and a Funeral, had appeared only in one previous film, Privileged. He was doing review comedy at the time and had lost interest in professional acting when Celestia Fox, the casting director, sent Grant to Ivory who immediately gave him the role of Clive.Long, James Ivory in Conversation, p. 214 It helped that Grant and Wilby had worked together in Grant's only previous film, made at Oxford. Rupert Graves was cast as Alec Scudder, Maurice's working-class lover. He had appeared as Lucy Honeychurch's young brother in A Room with a View, a performance with which he was unsatisfied, and so he appreciated the opportunity to deliver a better performance. The supporting cast included veterans Denholm Elliott as Dr. Barry and Simon Callow as the pedagogue Mr. Ducie, both from A Room with a View; Ben Kingsley as Lasker-Jones; Patrick Godfrey as the butler Simcox; Billie Whitelaw as Maurice's mother; and Helena Bonham Carter in an uncredited cameo as an audience member at the cricket match. =Filming= The film was made on a budget of $2.6 million that included investment by Cinecom and England's Channel 4. Maurice proved more complicated to make than Ivory had anticipated. Its fifty-four-day shooting schedule, which involved working six-day weeks, proved long and grueling. There was no rehearsal period, only a read-through before shooting began. Maurice was shot on location largely in the halls and quadrangles of King's College, Cambridge including interiors in the college's chapel, where Forster was educated and later returned as a Fellow. The other interiors were primarily shot at Wilbury Park, a Palladian house in Wiltshire. Its owner, Maria St. Just, an actress and trustee of the estate of Tennessee Williams, was a friend of Merchant and Ivory. In 1979 they had been weekend guests at Wilbury Park, which made an impression on James Ivory, who, when Maurice was being prepared, chose it to serve as Pendersleigh, the country house where Maurice visits his friend Clive. In the style of Merchant Ivory's A Room with a View, old book endpapers accompany the theme music played in minor scale at the beginning and in major scale at the end to bracket the film as a cinematographic novel. Differences from the novel At the beginning of the film, Maurice is age 11, rather than 14. The film omits almost all of the novel's philosophical dialogue and many subplots, such as Maurice's desire for the schoolboy Dickie. The scenes dealing with this subplot were filmed but not included in the final cut. The film expands the Wildean character of Lord Risley, and sees him sentenced to six months at hard labour for homosexual conduct; in the novel, he is never imprisoned. In one deleted scene (first released in Cohen Media's 2002 DVD edition), Risley commits suicide. In the novel, the Durham family seat is Penge, on the border of Wiltshire and Somerset; in the film the country house is in Pendersleigh Park. The hypnotist Lasker-Jones appears in the film rather more than in the novel; he is the person most understanding of Maurice's psychological and social situation. Release The film had its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival in 1987, where Ivory was awarded a Silver Lion as Best Director, sharing the prize with Ermanno Olmi.Long, The Films of Merchant Ivory, p. 153 James Wilby and Hugh Grant were jointly awarded Best Actor, and Richard Robbins received the prize for his music.Long, The Films of Merchant Ivory, p. 154 The film received favourable reviews when it opened in New York City. Maurice received an Academy Award nomination in the Best Costume Design category. =Critical reception= Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 89% of critics gave the film a positive review based on 27 reviews; the critics' consensus reads, \\"Maurice sensitively explores the ramifications of forbidden desire with a powerful love story brought to life by the outstanding efforts of a talented cast.\\"Maurice ‚Äì Rotten Tomatoes Ken Hanke from Mountain Xpress said it was probably Merchant‚ÄìIvory's best film.https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/maurice/reviews?type=&sort;=&page;=2 In The New York Times Janet Maslin observed \\"The novel's focus is predominantly on the inner life of the title character, but the film, while faithful, is broader. Moving slowly, with a fine eye for detail, it presents the forces that shape Maurice as skillfully as it brings the character to life.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times rated the film three stars out of a possible four, commenting: Dale Winogoura in Frontiers called the film \\"Passionate yet civilized, candid yet dignified, Maurice is among the few genuinely romantic gay films ever made and a landmark of the genre\\". Claire Tomalin writing for Sight & Sound called the film \\"subtle, intelligent, moving and absorbing [...] extraordinary in the way it mixes fear and pleasure, horror and love, it's a stunning success for a team who seems to have mastered all the problems of making literary films\\". Judy Stone in the San Francisco Chronicle wrote: \\"To director James Ivory's credit, however, he has recreated that period in pre- World War I England and endowed the platonic passion between two upper-class Englishmen with singular grace in Maurice.\\" Michael Blowen in The Boston Globe commented: \\"The team of producer Ismail Merchant and director James Ivory has created another classy film of a classic novel with their stunning adaptation of E. M. Forster's Maurice.\\" Reception in the UK was different, with The Times questioning whether \\"so defiant a salute to homosexual passion should really be welcomed during a spiraling AIDS crisis\\". James Ivory has attributed the negative reviews to the reviewers being homosexual themselves, stating: =Legacy= Maurice has won abundant praise in the 30 years since its initial release, both for the quality of the film and the audacity with which it depicted a gay love story at the height of the 1980s AIDS crisis. According to the Los Angeles Times, the fact that: The New Yorker, in a retrospective on the film in 2017, stated, \\"...For many gay men coming of age in the eighties and nineties, 'Maurice' was revelatory: a first glimpse, onscreen or anywhere, of what love between men could look like\\". Director James Ivory said, \\"So many people have come up to me since 'Maurice' and pulled me aside and said, 'I just want you to know you changed my life.'\\" The Guardian, describing Maurice as \\"undervalued in 1987 and underseen in 2017\\", lamented the relatively poor reception of the film compared to its lauded predecessor A Room with a View, saying it was \\"...filed away as, if not a disappointment, a lesser diversion\\" because it was \\"put bluntly, too gay\\". LA Weekly likewise called Maurice \\"the Merchant-Ivory film the World Missed\\", stating that: \\"it seems like it‚Äôs only recently been celebrated for how groundbreaking it was, and for its importance in the development of gay cinema.\\" In May 2017, a 4K restoration of Maurice was given a limited release in the United States to celebrate the film's 30th anniversary. In March 2018, the restored version was screened in London as part of the BFI Flare: London LGBT Film Festival, with introductions by James Wilby and Hugh Grant. Home media In 2002, a special-edition DVD of the film was released with a new documentary and deleted scenes with director's commentary. It was released on Blu-ray in September 2017 by the Cohen Media Group.

Its headquarters were located in San Francisco, California and maintained offices in Livermore, California and at 44th St. and Van Buren in Phoenix, Arizona. The issuing bank was known as NextBank and was fully owned by NextCard, Inc. NextCard, Inc. was started during the Internet boom of the late 1990s. Jeremy and Molly Lent, a married couple, founded the company in 1996 as Internet Access Financial Corporation, later changing the name to NextCard in 1997. During the early 1990s, Jeremy Lent had served as CFO for Providian Financial Corporation which had relied heavily on direct mail marketing methods \\"to identify and recruit customers who made extensive use of credit cards\\". Convinced that he could adapt this marketing strategy for the Internet, Lent left Providian to form NextCard. Operations The Lents' business plan was based on two assumptions: #Since a key metric in the credit card industry is acquisition cost of a new customer, he felt that he could \\"use the internet to undercut the average acquisition cost\\" of its \\"brick-and-mortar\\" competitors and #He believed his company would have \\"significantly lower bad debt losses than conventional credit card issuers since marketing research had found that internet users were generally more affluent and, thus, better credit risks, than individuals drawn from the general population of consumers\\". Because of these assumptions, NextCard, Inc. offered credit cards at interest rates lower than its competitors'. NextCard issued MasterCard and Visa cards under its own brand, and co-branded cards with MyPoints.com, PlanetOut.com, and Amazon.com. NextCard also issued secured credit cards. NextCard was a major online advertiser at the time, as they only accepted applications online. Its website was \\"regularly named one of the top 50 financial websites by Money magazine and by 2000 attracted more online 'hits' than any other website in the financial services industry\\". The company set aggressive growth targets and went public in 1999. Following its initial public offering, the internet 'bubble' in the stock market had burst. This \\"effectively shut off the access of NextCard and thousands of other struggling Internet companies to the debt and equity markets\\" . Jeremy Lent's assumptions also proved to have flaws; the acquisition cost per-customer was higher than expected because Internet users tended to ignore NextCard's online ads (which were also very costly), and the customers were people with little creditworthiness looking for a \\"lender of last resort\\". Downfall To understate its credit losses NextCard refused to \\"provide sufficient allowances each period for expected bad debts\\" . The Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) reviewed the company's accounting records and operating policies and procedures and forced NextCard to \\"significantly increase its allowance for bad debts\\". In response to this, NextCard stated that its high bad debts were due to fraudulent schemes perpetrated by hackers and the like. On October 31, 2001, it was announced that NextCard was under- capitalized and was then investigated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The reason, as stated to employees, was that the company had been categorizing as \\"fraud losses\\" what should have been categorized as \\"credit losses\\"... meaning the company was trying to categorize as fraud some of the money lost due to issuing cards to people with very poor credit.Cardweb.com \\"NextCard Folds\\", CardWeb.com The Amazon.com Visa issued by NextCard was subsequently issued by Chase following NextCard's demise. NextCard investors soon filed a class- action lawsuit with charges that the management had engaged in insider trading and hidden the financial status of the company.

He was the son of John Tyler, the tenth president of the United States. Tyler was the 17th president of the College of William and Mary, an advocate of historical research and preservation, and a prominent critic of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln. One of his own children died in September 2020, making John Tyler the earliest U.S. president to have living grandchildren into the 2000s . Biography =Early life and career= Lyon Gardiner Tyler as a young man Tyler was the fourth son of President John Tyler and First Lady Julia Gardiner Tyler, born at Sherwood Forest Plantation. When he was eight years old, his father died shortly after the beginning of the American Civil War, which prompted the family to move north to Staten Island, where his mother's family was from. He returned to Virginia in 1869 to earn both a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in law from the University of Virginia, graduating in 1875. While at the University he was a member of Kappa Sigma and the Jefferson Literary Society, and was recognized for his contributions to the school's literary magazine. Upon graduation from the University of Virginia, Tyler spent a year teaching philosophy and literature at the College of William and Mary, but as the college was struggling financially it ceased being able to pay his salary, whereupon he resigned and moved to Memphis, Tennessee, where he spent several years as principal of a private school. In 1882 he returned to Virginia to practice law in Richmond. With the support of his mother, who lived there at the time, he began work on The Letters and Times of the Tylers, a three-volume study of the careers of his father and paternal grandfather, John Tyler Sr.. This would be published between 1884 and 1896. During his life in Richmond, Tyler became a prominent advocate for public education reform. He helped to revive the Virginia Mechanics Institute, where he served as a board member and instructor. In 1887 he was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates, which gave him the opportunity to lobby for money for the College of William and Mary; he procured $10,000 to restore the school, which had lain dormant for seven years due to lack of funding and the ravages of war. His advocacy allowed the College to reopen in 1888; Tyler was named its president. =At William and Mary= From 1888 to 1919, Tyler served as the 17th president of the College of William & Mary (W&M;); he is widely credited for restoring the college's financial condition following the deterioration which took place in the wake of the American Civil War. During his tenure he held the chairmanship of the history department, and with six other professors formed the body known as the \\"Seven Wise Men\\". He also was responsible for the creation of the William and Mary Quarterly journal. An advocate of women's suffrage, he oversaw the College when it admitted women in 1918. It was while at the College that Tyler became interested in the history of Virginia; he would eventually conduct research throughout the state, and campaigned for the preservation of local records. In 1896 he managed to persuade the Virginia General Assembly to appropriate $5,000 for the copying of 17th-century court records, an action which set a precedent for the expenditure of public monies to preserve state records. Such preservation became his mission in later years, and he traveled extensively throughout the Commonwealth to find material. In 1915 he was elected to the State Library Board, serving until his death; he was a member of the Virginia Historical Society for fifty-two years, spending forty-seven of those on its executive committee and thirty-two as a vice president. He was a prolific author, and his work spurred recognition of the significance of both Jamestown and Williamsburg to American history. He also spent much of his career attempting to rehabilitate his father's political reputation. =Retirement and death= Tyler resigned the presidency of William and Mary in June 1919; during his tenure the College had increased its enrollment to over 200 pupils. The number of faculty had grown to fourteen, and twelve buildings were either renovated or constructed. The school also became a public institution, an effort which he spearheaded himself. He retired to his farm, Lion's Den, in Charles City County. He remained active in his profession, as a writer, speaker, and researcher, until dying of pneumonia on February 12, 1935 in Richmond, where he is buried in Hollywood Cemetery. =Criticism of Abraham Lincoln= Tyler received a deal of notoriety during his career for his criticism of President Abraham Lincoln, which he expressed on numerous occasions. The first of these came in 1917 when in response to an editorial in the New York Times suggesting that Southern slaveholders were akin to the German aristocrats then causing trouble in Europe, Tyler posited that it was Lincoln who more closely resembled the Prussian nobility with his flouting of the Constitution during the Civil War. Eleven years later the issue arose again when the Virginia House of Delegates chose to adjourn in honor of Lincoln's birthday; Tyler contended that Lincoln was no hero and did not merit the honor. When Time fired back that Tyler's father, compared to the later president, was a dwarf both in stature and in accomplishments, Tyler retorted with a pamphlet claiming that it was Lincoln who was the dwarf. He would go on in retirement to continue the crusade against Lincoln, publishing many articles in his own journal, Tyler's Quarterly and Genealogical Magazine, that were highly critical of the sixteenth president. In a 12-page pamphlet, A Confederate Catechism, he states: \\"Both from the standpoint of the Constitution and sound statesmanship, it was not slavery, but the vindictive, intemperate anti-slavery movement that was at the bottom of all the troubles.\\" The text is reprinted by the Sons of Confederate Veterans and the United Daughters of the Confederacy recommends children recite it. =Personal life= Tyler was married twice. His first wife was Anne Baker Tucker of Albemarle County, with whom he had three children: John Tyler; Elizabeth Gilmer Tyler; and Julia Gardiner Tyler Wilson, one of the founders of Kappa Delta. Following Anne's death in 1921, he married Sue Ruffin, who was 35 years his junior, with whom he had three more children: Lyon Gardiner Tyler Jr. (1925-2020); Harrison Ruffin Tyler (born 1928); and Henry Tyler, who died in infancy.https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/07/us/lyon- gardiner-tyler-jr-dead.html , Harrison Ruffin Tyler is still alive, making his grandfather the earliest former President of the United States with living grandchildren. In late August 2018, Lyon, Jr. participated in a reunion of presidential descendants hosted by the White House Historical Association, and signed, along with other presidential descendants, a drawer from a copy of the Resolute Desk.

Tracking in hunting and ecology is the science and art of observing animal tracks and other signs, with the goal of gaining understanding of the landscape and the animal being tracked (the \\"quarry\\"). A further goal of tracking is the deeper understanding of the systems and patterns that make up the environment surrounding and incorporating the tracker. The practice of tracking may focus on, but is not limited to, the patterns and systems of the local animal life and ecology. Trackers must be able to recognize and follow animals through their tracks, signs, and trails, also known as spoor. Spoor may include tracks, scat, feathers, kills, scratching posts, trails, drag marks, sounds, scents, marking posts, the behavior of other animals, habitat cues, and any other clues about the identity and whereabouts of the quarry. The skilled tracker is able to discern these clues, recreate what transpired on the landscape, and make predictions about the quarry. The tracker may attempt to predict the current location of the quarry and follow the quarry's spoor to that location, in an activity known as trailing. Prehistoric hunters used tracking principally to gather food. Even in historic times, tracking has been traditionally practiced by the majority of tribal people all across the world. The military and intelligence agencies also use tracking to find enemy combatants in the bush, land, sea, and desert. Tracking as an art and science It has been suggested that the art of tracking may have been the first implementation of science, practiced by hunter-gatherers since the evolution of modern humans.Liebenberg, L.W. (2006) Persistence hunting by modern hunter-gatherers. Curr. Anthropol. 47, 1017-1025.Carruthers, P. (2002) The roots of scientific reasoning: infancy, modularity and the art of tracking, In: Carruthers, P., Stich, S., Siegal, M., (Eds.), The Cognitive Basis of Science. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.Carruthers, P. (2006) The Architecture of the Mind. Oxford: Oxford University Press.Pickering, T.R., Bunn, H.T. (2007) The endurance running hypothesis and hunting and scavenging in savanna-woodlands. J. Hum. Evol. 53, 434-438. Apart from knowledge based on direct observations of animals, trackers gain a detailed understanding of animal behavior through the interpretation of tracks and signs. In this way much information can be obtained that would otherwise remain unknown, especially on the behavior of rare or nocturnal animals that are not often seen. Tracks and signs offer information on undisturbed, natural behavior, while direct observations often influence the animal by the mere presence of the observer. Tracking is therefore a non-invasive method of information gathering, in which potential stress caused to animals can be minimized. Some of the most important applications of tracking are in hunting and trapping, as well as controlling poaching, ecotourism, environmental education, police investigation, search and rescue, and in scientific research. The modern science of animal tracking is widely practiced in the fields of wildlife biology, zoology, mammalogy, conservation, and wildlife management. Tracking enables the detection of rare, endangered, and elusive species. The science of tracking is utilized in the study of forest carnivores like the Canada Lynx (Felis lynx) and the Wolverine (Gulo gulo). Various measurements of tracks, and/or an animal's paws, and subsequent analyses of the datum, can also reveal important information about animals' physiology and their behavior. For example, measurements of lynx paws demonstrate their support capacity (on snow) to be double that of bobcat. Recognition of signs In order to recognize a specific sign, a tracker often has a preconceived image of what a typical sign looks like. Without preconceived images many signs may be overlooked. However, with a preconceived image of a specific animal's spoor in mind, trackers will tend to 'recognize' spoor in markings made by another animal, or even in random markings. Their mind will be prejudiced to see what they want to see, and in order to avoid making such errors they must be careful not to reach decisions too soon. Decisions made at a glance can often be erroneous, so when encountering new signs, trackers take their time to study signs in detail. While preconceived images may help in recognizing signs, the tracker must, however, avoid the preconditioned tendency to look for one set of things in the environment to the exclusion of all others. Trackers will always try to identify the trail positively by some distinguishing mark or mannerism in order not to lose it in any similar spoor. They will look for such features in the footprints as well as for an individual manner of walking. Often hoofs of antelope are broken or have chipped edges, or when the animal is walking it may leave a characteristic scuff mark. Experienced trackers will memorise a spoor and be able to distinguish that individual animal's spoor from others. When following a spoor, trackers will walk next to it, not on it, taking care not to spoil the trail so that it can easily be found again if the spoor is lost. The shadows cast by ridges in the spoor show up best if the spoor is kept between the tracker and the sun. With the sun shining from behind the spoor, the shadows cast by small ridges and indentations in the spoor will be clearly visible. With the sun behind the tracker, however, these shadows will be hidden by the ridges that cast them. Tracking is easiest in the morning and late afternoon, as the shadows cast by the ridges in the spoor are longer and stand out better than at or near midday. As the sun moves higher in the sky, the shadows grow shorter. At midday the spoor may cast no shadows at all, making them difficult to see in the glare of the sunlight. Trackers will never look down at their feet if they can help it, since this will slow them down. By looking up, well ahead of themselves, approximately five to ten meters (15‚Äì30 feet) depending on the terrain, they are able to track much faster and with more ease. Unless they need to study the spoor more closely, it is not necessary to examine every sign. If they see a sign ten meters ahead, those in between can be ignored while they look for spoor further on. Over difficult terrain it may not be possible to see signs well ahead, so trackers will have to look at the ground in front of them and move more slowly. Trackers must also avoid concentrating all their attention on the tracks, thereby ignoring everything around them. Tracking requires varying attention, a constant refocusing between minute details of the track and the whole pattern of the environment. Anticipation and prediction Although in principle it is possible to follow a trail by simply looking for one sign after the other, this may prove so time-consuming that the tracker will never catch up with the quarry. Instead, trackers place themselves in the position of their quarry in order to anticipate the route it may have taken. They will thereby be able to decide in advance where they can expect to find signs and thus not waste time looking for them. Trackers will often look for spoor in obvious places such as openings between bushes, where the animal would most likely have moved. In thick bushes they will look for the most accessible thruways. Where the spoor crosses an open clearing, they will look in the general direction for access ways on the other side of the clearing. If the animal was moving from shade to shade, they will look for spoor in the shade ahead. If their quarry has consistently moved in a general direction, it may be possible to follow the most likely route by focusing on the terrain, and to look for signs of spoor only occasionally. They must, however, always be alert for an abrupt change in direction. Animals usually make use of a network of paths to move from one locality to another. If it is clear that an animal was using a particular path, this can simply be followed up to the point where it forks, or to where the animal has left the path. Where one of several paths may have been used, trackers must of course determine which path that specific animal used. This may not always be easy, since many animals often use the same paths. In areas of high animal densities that have much-used animal paths which interlink, it may seem impossible to follow tracks. However, once tracks have been located on an animal path, it is often possible for a tracker to follow the path even though no further tracks are seen. By looking to either side of the path, the tracker can establish if the animal has moved away from the path, and then follow the new trail. In difficult terrain, where signs are sparse, trackers may have to rely extensively on anticipating the animal's movements. In order to move fast enough to overtake the animal, one may not be able to detect all the signs. Trackers sometimes identify themselves with the animal to such an extent that they follow an imaginary route which they think the animal would most likely have taken, only confirming their expectations with occasional signs. When trackers come to hard, stony ground, where tracks are virtually impossible to discern, apart from the odd small pebble that has been overturned, they may move around the patch of hard ground in order to find the spoor in softer ground. When the trackers lose the spoor, they first search obvious places for signs, choosing several likely access ways through the bush in the general direction of movement. When several trackers work together, they can simply fan out and quarter the ground until one of them finds it. An experienced tracker may be able to predict more or less where the animal was going, and will not waste time in one spot looking for signs, but rather look for it further ahead. Knowledge of the terrain and animal behavior allows trackers to save valuable time by predicting the animal's movements. Once the general direction of movement is established and it is known that an animal path, river or any other natural boundary lies ahead, they can leave the spoor and move to these places, cutting across the trail by sweeping back and forth across the predicted direction in order to pick up tracks a considerable distance ahead. To be able to anticipate and predict the movements of an animal, trackers must know the animal and its environment so well that they can identify themselves with that animal. They must be able to visualize how the animal was moving around, and place themselves in its position. If the animal was moving in a straight line at a steady pace, and it is known that there is a waterhole or a pan further ahead, trackers should leave the spoor to look for signs of it at the waterhole or pan. While feeding, an animal will usually move into the wind, going from one bush to another. If the trackers know the animal's favored food, and know moreover how they generally move, they need not follow its zigzag path, but leave the spoor at places, moving in a straight course to save time, and pick up the spoor further on. Since signs may be fractional or partly obliterated, it may not always be possible to make a complete reconstruction of the animal's movements and activities on the basis of spoor evidence alone. Trackers may therefore have to create a working hypothesis in which spoor evidence is supplemented with hypothetical assumptions based not only on their knowledge of animal behavior, but also on their creative ability to solve new problems and discover new information. The working hypothesis is often a reconstruction of what the animal was doing, how fast it was moving, when it was there, where it was going to and where it might be at that time. Such a working hypothesis enables the trackers to predict the animal's movements. As new information is gathered, they may have to revise their working hypothesis, creating a better reconstruction of the animal's activities. Anticipating and predicting an animal's movements, therefore, involves a continuous process of problem-solving, creating new hypotheses and discovering new information. Stealth In order to come close to an animal, trackers must remain undetected not only by the animal, but also by other animals that may alert it. Moving as quietly as possible, trackers will avoid stepping on dry leaves and twigs, and take great care when moving through dry grass. If the trackers are in close proximity to the animal, it is important that they remain downwind of it, that is, in a position where the wind is blowing away from the animal in the direction of the tracker. They must never be in a position where their scent could be carried in the wind towards the animal and thereby alert it. It is also important that the animal does not have the opportunity to cross their tracks, since the lingering human scent will alert it. Most animals prefer to keep the wind in their faces when traveling so that they can scent danger ahead of them. Trackers will therefore usually be downwind from them as they approach the animals from behind. The wind direction may, however, have changed. If the wind direction is unfavorable, the trackers may have to leave the spoor to search for their quarry from the downwind side . As the trackers get closer to the animal, they must make sure that they see it before it sees them. Some trackers maintain that an animal keeps looking back down its own trail, always on the alert for danger coming from behind. When the spoor is very fresh, trackers may have to leave the spoor so that the animal does not see them first. Animals usually rest facing downwind, so that they can see danger approaching from the downwind side, while they can smell danger coming from behind them. An animal may also double back on its spoor and circle downwind before settling down to rest. A predator following its trail will move past the resting animal on the upwind side before realizing that the animal had doubled back, and the resting animal will smell the predator in time to make its escape. When stalking an animal, trackers use the cover of bushes, going down on their hands and knees where necessary. In long grass they go down on their stomachs pulling themselves forward with their elbows. The most important thing is not to attract attention by sudden movements. Trackers take their time, moving slowly when the animal is not looking, and keeping still when the animal is looking in their direction. When stalking an animal, trackers must also be careful not to disturb other animals. A disturbed animal will give its alarm signal, thereby alerting all animals in the vicinity, including the animal being tracked down. Further reading * Brown, T.

Primitive forms were generally small (60 cm to 1 meter), but during the later part of the early Permian these animals grew progressively larger (up to 3 meters or more), to become the top predators of their environments. Sphenacodontid fossils are so far known only from North America and Europe. Characteristics Restoration of two individuals of Sphenacodon The skull is long, deep and narrow, an adaptation for strong jaw muscles. The front teeth are large and dagger-like, whereas the teeth in the sides and rear of the jaw are much smaller (hence the name of the well-known genus Dimetrodon ‚Äì \\"two-measure tooth\\", although all members of the family have this attribute). Several large (~3 meters) and advanced members of this group (Ctenospondylus, Sphenacodon, Secodontosaurus and Dimetrodon) are distinguished by a tall sail along the back, made up of elongated vertebral neural spines, which in life must have been covered with skin and blood vessels, and presumably functioned as a thermoregulatory device. However, possession of a sail does not appear to have been essential for these animals. For example, there is the case in which one genus (Sphenacodon ‚Äì fossils known from New Mexico) lacks a sail, while a very similar and closely related genus (Dimetrodon ‚Äì fossils known from Texas) has one. During the Permian, these two regions were separated by a narrow sea-way, but it is not clear why one geographically isolated group should evolve a sail, but the other group not. Classification Cutleria The family Sphenacodontidae is actually paraphyletic as originally described, defined by shared primitive synapsid characters; these animals constitute an evolutionary gradation from primitive synapsid to early therapsid. The clade Sphenacodontia is used to designate the monophyletic group that includes sphenacodontids and all their descendants (including mammals), while Sphenacodontidae in the strict sense includes only specialised pelycosaurs, and not earlier more primitive members of the family like Haptodus, Palaeohatteria, Pantelosaurus, and Cutleria (in pre-cladistic classifications all included under the genus Haptodus). The clade Sphenacodontoidea is used by Laurin and Reisz 1997 to designate the most recent common ancestor of Sphenacodontidae and Therapsida and all their descendants, and is defined by certain features of the skull.

The date of their first apparition is uncertain. Thucydides does not explain the origin of this special category. Jean Ducat, in his book Les Hoplites (1990), concludes that their statute \\"was largely inspired by the measures dictated concerning the Brasidians\\", i.e. the Helots freed after taking part to the expedition of Brasidas in 424 BC. Their existence is attested from 420 to 369 BC. They were part of Sparta's army and 2,000 of them are recorded taking part, for example, to Agesilaus II's campaign in Ionia between 396 and 394 BC.

The book combines elements of comedy, adventure, fantasy, drama, romance, and fairy tale. It is presented as an abridgment (or \\"the good parts version\\") of a longer work by the fictional S. Morgenstern, and Goldman's \\"commentary\\" asides are constant throughout. It was originally published in the United States by Harcourt Brace, then later by Random House, while in the United Kingdom it was later published by Bloomsbury. The book was adapted into a 1987 feature film directed by Rob Reiner from a screenplay written by Goldman himself. William Goldman said, \\"I've gotten more responses on The Princess Bride than on everything else I've done put together‚Äîall kinds of strange outpouring letters. Something in The Princess Bride affects people.\\". A segment of the book was published as \\"Duel Scene (From The Princess Bride)\\" in the anthology The Best of All Possible Worlds (1980), which was edited by Spider Robinson. In 2015, a collection of essays on the novel and the film adaptation was published entitled The Princess Bride and Philosophy. Plot Map of Florin and Guilder In a Renaissance-era world, a young woman named Buttercup lives on a farm in the country of Florin. She abuses the farm hand Westley, calling him \\"farm boy\\" and demands that he perform chores for her. Westley's response to her demands is always \\"As you wish.\\" She eventually realizes that what he is saying is, \\"I love you.\\" After Buttercup realizes that she loves him and confesses her feelings, Westley leaves to seek his fortune so they can marry. Buttercup later receives a letter that the Dread Pirate Roberts attacked his ship at sea. Believing Westley dead, Buttercup sinks into despair. Later she reluctantly agrees to marry Prince Humperdinck, heir to the throne of Florin. Before the wedding, a trio of outlaws‚Äîthe Sicilian criminal genius Vizzini, the Spanish fencing master Inigo Montoya, and the enormous and mighty Turkish wrestler Fezzik‚Äîkidnap Buttercup. A masked man in black follows them across the sea and up the Cliffs of Insanity, whereupon Vizzini orders Inigo to stop him. Before the man in black reaches the top of the cliff, a flashback of Inigo's past reveals that he is seeking revenge on a six-fingered man who killed his father. When the man in black arrives, Inigo challenges him to a duel. The man in black wins the duel, but leaves the Spaniard alive. Vizzini then orders Fezzik to kill the man in black. His flashback showed Fezzik as a lonely boy who was \\"accepted\\" by Vizzini. His conscience compelling him, Fezzik throws a rock as a warning and challenges the man to a wrestling match. The man in black accepts the challenge and chokes Fezzik until the giant blacks out. He then catches up with Vizzini and proposes a Battle of the Wits, guessing which cup of wine is poisoned with iocane powder. They drink, and Vizzini dies. With Prince Humperdinck's rescue party in hot pursuit, the man in black flees with Buttercup. He taunts Buttercup, claiming that women cannot be trusted and that she must have felt nothing when her true love and sweetheart had died. She shoves him into a gorge, yelling, \\"You can die, too, for all I care!\\", and hears him call, \\"As you wish!\\" from the bottom of the ravine. She realizes he is Westley, and follows him down into the gorge, to find him battered but largely unhurt. They travel through the Fire Swamp to evade Humperdinck's party. At Buttercup's insisting, Westley tells Buttercup about his experience with the Dread Pirate Roberts and how he secretly became the latest in a line of men to use that identity. The Fire Swamp has many obstacles, such as Snow Sand and Rodents of Unusual Size (R.O.U.S., , ). Westley and Buttercup successfully navigate the Fire Swamp, but they are captured by Prince Humperdinck and his cruel six-fingered assistant, Count Tyrone Rugen. Buttercup negotiates for Westley's release and returns with Humperdinck to the palace to await their wedding. Rugen follows Humperdinck's secret instructions not to release Westley, but to take him to his underground hunting arena, the \\"Zoo of Death\\". Here, Rugen tortures and weakens Westley with his life-sucking invention, The Machine. Meanwhile, Buttercup has nightmares regarding her marriage to the prince. She expresses her unhappiness to Humperdinck, who proposes a deal wherein he will send ships to locate Westley, but if they fail to find him, Buttercup will marry him. The novel reveals that, to start a war with the neighboring country of Guilder, Humperdinck himself had arranged Buttercup's kidnapping and murder, but that he now believes that Buttercup dying on her wedding night will inspire his subjects to fight more effectively. On the day of the wedding, Inigo meets again with Fezzik, who tells him that Count Rugen is the six-fingered man who killed his father. Knowing that Vizzini is dead, they seek out the man in black hoping that his wits will help them plan a successful attack on the castle to find and kill Count Rugen. Buttercup learns that Humperdinck never sent any ships, and taunts him with her enduring love for Westley. Enraged, Humperdinck tortures Westley to death via The Machine. Westley's screams echo across the land, drawing Inigo and Fezzik to the Zoo of Death. Finding Westley's body, they enlist the help of a magician named Miracle Max who was fired by Humperdinck. Max pronounces Westley to be merely \\"mostly dead\\", and returns him to life (out of a desire to get back at Humperdinck), though Westley remains partially paralyzed and weak. Westley devises a plan to invade the castle during the wedding, and the commotion caused by this prompts Humperdinck to cut the wedding short. Buttercup decides to commit suicide when she reaches the honeymoon suite. Inigo pursues Rugen through the castle and kills him in a sword fight. Westley reaches Buttercup before she commits suicide. Still partially paralyzed, Westley bluffs his way out of a sword fight with Humperdinck, who shows himself to be a coward. Instead of killing his rival, Westley decides to leave him alive. The party then rides off into the sunset on four of the prince's purebred white horses. The story ends with a series of mishaps and the prince's men closing in, but the author indicates that he believes that the group got away. Context This novel includes several narrative techniques or literary devices including a fictional frame story about how Goldman came to know about and decided to adapt S. Morgenstern's The Princess Bride. In Goldman's \\"footnotes,\\" he describes how his father used to read The Princess Bride aloud to him; thus the book became Goldman's favorite without him ever actually reading the text. As a father, Goldman looked forward to sharing the story with his own son, going to great lengths to locate a copy for his son's birthday, only to be crushed when his son stops reading after the first chapter. When Goldman revisits the book himself, he discovers that what he believed was a straightforward adventure novel was in fact a bitter satire of politics in Morgenstern's native Florin, and that his father had been skipping all the political commentary and leaving in only \\"the good parts.\\" This moves Goldman to abridge the book to a version resembling the one his father had read to him, while adding notes to summarize material he had \\"removed.\\" Morgenstern and the \\"original version\\" are fictitious and used as a literary device to comment on the nature of adaptation and to draw a contrast between the love and adventure of the main story and the mundane aspects of everyday life. The nations of Guilder and Florin are likewise pure fiction. The narrator of The Princess Bride, while named William Goldman, is persona or author surrogate that mixes fictional elements with some biographical details that match the author's life. Goldman's personal life, as described in the introduction and commentary in the novel, is fictional. In The Princess Bride, Goldman claimed to have one son with his wife, Helen, a psychiatrist. In reality, Goldman married Ilene Jones, a photographer, in 1961. They had two daughters named Jenny and Susanna, and they divorced in 1991. Goldman's commentary contains references to his real-life Hollywood career (including the observation that the famous cliff scene in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid was likely inspired by the Cliffs of Insanity from The Princess Bride). While Goldman did write the screenplay for Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid in 1969, it is unclear if all the career references have a basis in truth. The commentary is extensive, continuing through the text until the end. The book's actual roots are in stories Goldman told to his daughters (aged 7 and 4), one of whom had requested a story about \\"princesses\\" and the other \\"brides\\". Goldman describes the earliest character names from the \\"kid's saga\\" as \\"silly names: Buttercup, Humperdinck\\". The countries are both named after coins. The florin was originally an Italian gold coin minted in Florence, and later the name of various currencies and denominations. The guilder was originally a Dutch gold coin, and later the name of various currencies used mainly in the Netherlands and its territories. The two names are often interchangeable. Goldman said he wrote the first chapter about Buttercup which ran for about 20 pages. Then, he wrote the second chapter, \\"The Groom\\", about the man she was going to marry; Goldman only managed to write four pages before running dry. Then he got the idea to write an abridged novel: Goldman said he was particularly moved writing the scene where Westley dies. =Reunion scene= In the novel's commentary, Goldman writes that he added nothing to the \\"original\\" Morgenstern text. He did write one original scene, a loving reunion between Buttercup and Westley, but, he said, his publisher objected to this addition. He invites any reader who wants to read the \\"Reunion Scene\\" to write to the publisher (formerly Harcourt Brace Jovanovich; now Random House) and request a copy. Many readers wrote in to the publisher and did receive a letter, but instead of an extra scene, the letter detailed the (obviously fictitious) legal problems that Goldman and his publishers encountered with the Morgenstern estate and its lawyer, Kermit Shog. This letter was revised and updated periodically; the 1987 revision mentioned the movie, while the 25th Anniversary Edition published the letter with an addendum about Kermit's lawyer granddaughter Carly. The 30th Anniversary Edition has a footnote that the three pages of the reunion scene were now available online.. However, the website itself contained nothing but the text of the original three letters. This website has since been taken down and superseded by the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt product page for the book, which provides the 2003 version of the Reunion Scene letter as a digital download.  Buttercup's Baby  The epilogue to some later editions of the novel, notably the 25th anniversary edition, mentions a sequel, Buttercup's Baby, that was \\"having trouble getting published because of legal difficulties with S. Morgenstern's estate\\". Later editions actually reprint Goldman's \\"sample chapter\\". The chapter consists of a disjointed assemblage of stories about the quartet's escape to \\"One Tree Island\\", and the eventual kidnapping of Waverly (Westley and Buttercup's daughter) by a skinless-faced \\"madman\\" who eventually throws her off a mountainside. The chapter ends with Fezzik, Waverly's appointed babysitter, leaping off the mountain to save her, and then cradling her to preserve her from the impact that seems certain to spell at least Fezzik's doom. Also noteworthy is a flashback to Inigo's past, his training as a swordsman, and his one-time romantic love interest. The chapter also continues the author's extensive footnotes after he is outraged to learn that the fiercely protective Morgenstern estate had finally relented to an abridgment of Buttercup's Baby done not by Goldman but by author Stephen King. The footnotes detail Goldman's visit to the fictional nation of Florin, which houses a popular museum devoted to the \\"real\\" story of The Princess Bride and contains such artifacts as Inigo's six-fingered sword. The 30th anniversary edition of The Princess Bride included hints to the sequel's plot, and a promise to have the full version completed before a 50th anniversary edition (2023). In a January 2007 interview, Goldman admitted he was having difficulty coming up with ideas for the story:  Adaptations  In 1982 Ray Harryhausen was approached by British producer Milton Subotsky, who had written a script based on the novel. Harryhausen liked the book, but found too many problems with the screenplay. He and Subotsky worked together in an attempt to create a new script, but eventually gave up.5 Unmade Ray Harryhausen Films We Wish Existed - Bloody Disgusting The book was adapted into a 1987 feature film directed by Rob Reiner from a screenplay written by Goldman himself. Goldman partnered with Adam Guettel to create a musical version of the story with Goldman writing the book and Guettel writing the music, but the two parted ways on the project when Goldman demanded 75% of the author's royalties, though Guettel was writing both the music and the lyrics. Guettel's score was nearly complete, but it is unlikely to be heard beyond an orchestral suite performed at the Hollywood Bowl in 2006. In November 2013, Disney Theatrical announced that it will be staging a new stage musical version, based on the novel and film screenplay. In 2008, Toy Vault, Inc. announced it was working on a Princess Bride‚Äìbased card game due for release in the second quarter of 2008. It also announced that it is working on a board game, the second ever produced for this movie, after a simple board game included with some VHS releases. Also in 2008, the production company Worldwide Biggies released a computer game, The Princess Bride Game. Several actors from the movie provided voices for their video game counterparts, including Mandy Patinkin as Inigo Montoya, Wallace Shawn as Vizzini, and Robin Wright as Buttercup. Sierra Online parodied the title of the novel in their computer game King's Quest VII: The Princeless Bride. In 2014, Game Salute licensed the tabletop game adaptation publishing rights to the Princess Bride; a series of board and card games were released later that year. In 2019, Toy Vault produced a Role Playing Game written by Steffan O'Sullivan. On September 13, 2020, the surviving members of the original cast participated in a live script reading that was a fundraiser for the Wisconsin Democratic Party.

Derived from renditions of the story of Judith from the Old Testament Apocrypha, the Russian libretto, though credited to the composer, has a complicated history (see below). The premiere took place in 1863 in Saint Petersburg. This stage debut, supplemented with his next opera Rogneda, made Serov the most important Russian opera composer of the 1860s. Composition history Fyodor Shalyapin as Holofernes (1898) The Italian play Giuditta by Paolo Giacometti, produced in Saint Petersburg in 1860, first inspired the Serov to work on the project as a vehicle for the Italian opera troupe in Saint Petersburg. Using Serov's scenario, Ivan Antonovich Giustiniani wrote a libretto in Italian. When an Italian production of the proposed opera proved legally impossible, the Italian libretto was translated into Russian by Konstantin Zvantsov and Dmitry Lobanov, and some verses were added by the poet Apollon Maykov; in the meantime, the composer was writing the music without having the words ahead of time. Performance history The world premiere was given on 16 May 1863 at the Mariinsky Theatre, St. Petersburg, conducted by Konstantin Lyadov and starring Mikhail Sariotti as Holofernes and Valentina Bianki as Judith. The Moscow premiere took place in 1865 at the Bolshoy Theatre in Moscow under Shramek.

The elders Ozias and Charmi report that all the roads are now cut off, and the last source of water has dried up. The high priest Eliachim, however, hopes for a miracle, but the people want to surrender the city to end their suffering. The elders ask them to wait five more days and nights; after that time, if God does not deliver them, the city will let the enemy in. Jewish warriors then come through the gates holding Achior. He tried to persuade Holofernes to stop the siege and follow the God of the Jews; as punishment, Holofernes had him bound and left near the city to share in the Jews' destruction by the Assyrians. Everyone then prays to God for deliverance. =Act 2= Judith, alone in her room, decides that, instead of waiting five days, something must be done now. She devises a plan to use the beauty God gave her in order to trick Holofernes and save her people. To her summons the elders arrive. She expresses her pro-active intentions and asks for permission to go to the enemy camp with her slave Avra. They grant permission and leave. When Avra then tries to talk her out of going to the camp, Judith remains steadfast. =Act 3= In Holofernes' camp, odalisques perform songs and dances. Holofernes sends them away, intent on his plan to make a full attack on Bethulia the next day. Judith is let into the camp and presented to Holofernes, who is enchanted by her beauty (as are all the Assyrians). When he inquires as to her purpose, she pretends that she will show him a secret way to enter and take Bethulia and Jerusalem as long as he allows her to move freely. Holofernes believes her ruse, even to the point of asking her to be queen. The camp then celebrates the power of Babylon. =Act 4= Dances and songs once more resound in the camp. Amidst praise of comely Judith, Asfaneses makes an unfortunate remark about her coldness, and is immediately stabbed to death by Holofernes. Just then Judith comes out and is horrified by the grisly act, but remains resolved in her plan. He informs her that the city will be attacked the next day. In a drunken stupor Holofernes falls to the ground unconscious at Judith's feet. After he is placed on his bed, she remains with him as everyone else leaves. Within the tent she takes his sword and decapitates him. After asking Avra to put the head into a sack, the two of them leave quickly. =Act 5= In Bethulia the people, awaiting the dawn of the sixth day, are ready to open the gates to the Assyrians, despite pleadings from the high priest. Suddenly Judith is heard outside the gates, and she shows them the head of Holofernes. The sounds of the fleeing Assyrian troops are confirmed by Ozias' report. All sing praise to God for answering their prayers.

Rao previously served as the president of Central Michigan University in Mount Pleasant, Michigan and Mission College in Santa Clara, California. Additionally, he served as the Chancellor of Montana State University‚ÄìNorthern.  Early life and education  Rao, the son of a physician from Mumbai, India, was born in Boston, Massachusetts. At age eight, he moved with his mother to rural Pasco County, Florida, after the early death of his father, Suresh Rao. He received his bachelor's degree in Chemistry from the University of South Florida and his doctorate in Higher Education Administration from the University of Florida. Academic career Rao has been an administrator for more than 20 years. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Rao served in the private sector as a higher education academic program planner. In this role, he created master plans for the University of Washington system and the University of California. He also served as assistant to the president at the University of Florida, a member of the Association of American Universities (AAU). In 1992, Rao became a dean at Mission College in Santa Clara, California, and became president of the college two years later. This move gave him the distinction of being the youngest college president in the country at that time. In 1998, he became chancellor of Montana State University‚ÄìNorthern, in Havre. Rao was chosen to be president of Central Michigan University (CMU), a large public, research university in the year 2000. His work at Central Michigan University focused on interdisciplinary academic program development, economic development through commercialization of research, fundraising for the university, and outreach to the Central Michigan region. During his tenure and despite state budget cuts, CMU significantly increased faculty positions and research productivity, developed academic programs and improved performance. Under Rao's leadership, CMU gained approval to establish a medical school and M.D. degree program, partnering with large healthcare systems. When he left CMU in 2009, Rao was one of the three longest-serving presidents among Michigan's 15 public universities. Virginia Commonwealth University presidency Rao was selected to be the president of Virginia Commonwealth University in 2009. =Inauguration= Michael Rao was officially installed as VCU's fifth president on October 14, 2011 in an inauguration ceremony at the Siegel Center. The event was marked with two weeks of activities designed to highlight the urban university's commitment to student success, academic excellence, research and human health. VCU hosted a Presidential Inauguration Research Lecture Series, a university-wide food drive, and events highlighting VCU's commitment to sustainability. VCU also launched a new tradition recognizing the inaugural class of ‚ÄúUniversity Scholars,‚Äù undergraduate students who have completed 54-84 credits and have attained outstanding academic achievement. In December 2011, VCU extended Michael Rao's contract through June 30, 2017, with automatic renewals allowing for a possible extension until 2020. Rao's VCU salary is the highest among all employees of the State of Virginia, at $1,020,828 for the 2018-2019 fiscal year, a 109% increase from his 2009 annual salary of $488,500. = Protests = While president, Rao overlooked a series of protests by adjunct faculty at VCU. The coalition behind the protests critiqued Rao's salary while many adjuncts made poverty level wages. Ahead of the 2018-19 budget, $4.2 million was allocated to increase adjunct faculty funding from $800 to $1,000 per credit hour, about $1,000 less than what the coalition was demanding. = Ghostwriting scandal = In September 2019, it was reported that Rao had signed as the sole author of an opinion piece that he had not written. The January 2019 op-ed, printed in the Richmond Times-Dispatch, supported a private development in that city but had been ghostwritten by an employee of the private development. The executive editor of the Richmond Times-Dispatch stated that the newspaper would not have published the piece if it has known of its true origin. Rao's actions were also criticized by independent ethics experts. Personal life Rao is married to Monica Rao, a professional watercolorist and graphic designer from Bangalore. They have two sons. His grandmother was from Mangalore. Monica Rao is a graduate of Nirmala Niketan Polytechnic Institute in India with a diploma in commercial art/design. She has also received a bachelor's in art/graphic design with a minor in business administration and a master's in leadership from Central Michigan University.

See List of Gentlemen Ushers for a list of office-holders. Gentlemen Ushers as servants =Historical= The funeral procession of Queen Elizabeth I, 1603; William Camden, Clarenceux King of Arms bearing the tabard or \\"coate\\", between two gentleman ushers. Inscription: \\"A Gentleman Usher wth a white Rodd\\" Gentlemen Ushers were originally a class of servants found not only in the Royal Household, but in lesser establishments as well. They were regularly found in the households of Tudor noblemen, and were prescribed by Richard Brathwait, in his Household of an Earle, as one of the \\"officers and Servants the state of an Earle requireth to have\\". The Gentlemen Ushers occupied a level intermediate between the steward, the usual head, and the ordinary servants; they were responsible for overseeing the work of the servants \\"above stairs\\", particularly those who cooked and waited upon the nobleman at meals, and saw to it the great chamber was kept clean by the lesser servants. He was also responsible for overseeing other miscellaneous service, such as the care of the nobleman's chapel and bed-chambers. It was traditionally the gentleman usher who swore in new members of the nobleman's service. The duties of a gentleman usher, not unlike those of a contemporary butler, made him quite important in Tudor and 17th-century households. George Chapman's play The Gentleman Usher has as its title character the pompous but easily fooled Bassiolo, Gentleman Usher to Lord Lasso. The Gentlemen Ushers of the Royal Household, in order of precedence, were originally the four Gentlemen Ushers of the Privy Chamber (who attended the Sovereign in the Privy Chamber), the four Gentlemen Ushers Daily Waiters, and the eight Gentlemen Ushers Quarter(ly) Waiters. The latter two originally served different terms of service, but the distinction later became only nominal, as the role of the Gentlemen Ushers became increasingly ceremonial and they exercised less supervision over the staff. In 1901, King Edward VII abolished the three classes and began to appoint simply Gentlemen Ushers in Ordinary. =Contemporary= An establishment of ten Gentlemen Ushers is maintained. Gentlemen Ushers to The Queen are generally appointed from retired military officers (and occasionally civilians) for irregular and infrequent attendance at royal events. When on duty they generally wear either service uniform or morning or evening dress, depending on the occasion, with a brassard, displaying the royal cypher, in addition. They act as ushers at Royal Garden Parties and Investitures, as well as on state occasions. At royal weddings, funerals and other large services they may be called upon to lead royal and other guests in procession before conducting them to their seats. Occasionally they may be called upon to attend an event (e.g. a memorial service) as the monarch's representative. Ushers, who are unpaid, retire at 70, when they may become Extra Gentlemen Ushers. They are, in some respects, the equivalent to the Military Social Aides to the US President, who attend on some 2 to 4 afternoons a month to assist visitors to the White House. Particular Gentlemen Ushers Certain Gentlemen Ushers have duties outside of the Royal Household, usually attached either as officers of an order of knighthood or to a House of Parliament. These are, in order of antiquity: *The Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod, established c.1361 as an officer of the Order of the Garter, who also serves as secretary to the Lord Great Chamberlain and Doorkeeper of the House of Lords and (since 1971) Serjeant-at-Arms of the House of Lords. During the Tudor period, he was usually one of the senior members of the Royal Household, such as the Groom of the Stool; from the Restoration until 1765, Black Rod was the senior of the existing Gentleman Usher Daily Waiter, after which a new Daily Waiter was appointed to succeed the previous Black Rod. The present Black Rod is Sarah Clarke. *The Gentleman Usher of the White Rod, established as a hereditary dignity c.1373, who attended the Parliament of Scotland before its abolition in 1707. The heritable office was pronounced to be adjudgeable in 1758, and has been bought and sold several times since then. The position was revived to some degree in connection with the Parliament of Great Britain, and is now held by the Walker Trustees. * The Gentleman Usher of the Green Rod, established 1714, is the usher for the Scottish Order of the Thistle, currently Rear Admiral Christopher Hope Layman. * The Irish Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod, established 1783, is the usher for the Irish Order of St Patrick; there have been no appointees to the office since 1933. * The Gentleman Usher of the Scarlet Rod, established in 1725, is the usher for the British Order of the Bath. The present Scarlet Rod is Major General James Gordon. * The Gentleman Usher to the Sword of State, established c.1842, is the usher who bears the Sword of State in ceremonial processions, currently General Kevin O'Donoghue. * The Gentleman Usher of the Blue Rod, established as 1882 as an \\"Officer of Arms\\" and made an usher in 1911, is the usher for the British Order of St Michael and St George, currently Dame DeAnne Julius. * The Gentleman Usher of the Purple Rod, established in 1918, is the usher for the Order of the British Empire, currently Dame Amelia Fawcett. Gentlemen Ushers of the Black Rod also exist for New Zealand, Australia and its states, and Canada.

Little is known of his reign, which may have begun in 779, according to later sources, and very few of the coins he issued have been discovered. It is known from the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle that he was killed on the orders of Offa of Mercia in 794. √Üthelberht was locally canonised and became the focus of cults in East Anglia and at Hereford, where the shrine of the saintly king once existed. In the absence of historical facts, mediaeval chroniclers provided their own details for his ancestry, life as king and death at the hands of Offa. His feast day is 20 May. There are churches in Norfolk, Suffolk and the west of England dedicated to him, and he is a joint patron of Hereford Cathedral.  Life and reign  The kingdom of East Anglia √Üthelberht's name in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle Little is known of √Üthelberht's life or reign, as few East Anglian records have survived from this period. Mediaeval chroniclers have provided dubious accounts of his life, in the absence of any real details. According to Richard of Cirencester, writing in the fifteenth century, √Üthelberht's parents were √Üthelred I of East Anglia and Leofrana of Mercia. Richard narrates in detail a story of √Üthelberht's piety, election as king and wise rule. Urged to marry against his will, he apparently agreed to wed Eadburh, the daughter of Offa of Mercia, and set out to visit her, despite his mother's forebodings and his experiences of terrifying events (an earthquake, a solar eclipse and a vision).Internet Archive ‚Äì The Catholic Encyclopedia (Ethelbert) √Üthelberht's reign may have begun in 779, the date provided on the uncertain authority of a much later saint's life. The absence of any East Anglian charters prevents it from being known whether he ruled as king, or a sub-king under the power of another ruler. Offa stopped √Üthelberht from minting his own coins, of which only four examples have ever been found. One of these, a 'light' penny, said to have been discovered in 1908 at Tivoli, near Rome, is similar in type to the coinage of Offa. On one side is the word REX, with an image of Romulus and Remus suckling a wolf: the obverse names the king and his moneyer, Lul, who also struck coins for Offa and Coenwulf of Mercia. The author Andy Hutcheson has suggested that the use of runes on the coin may signify \\"continuing strong control by local leaders\\". According to the numismatist Marion Archibald, the issuing of \\"flattering\\" coins of this type, with the intention to win friends in Rome, probably indicated that as a sub-king, √Üthelberht was assuming \\"a greater degree of independence than (Offa) was prepared to tolerate\\". In 793 the vulnerability of the English east coast was exposed when the monastery at Lindisfarne was looted by Vikings, and a year later Jarrow was also attacked, which the historian Steven Plunkett reasons would ensure that East Anglia was governed firmly. √Üthelberht's claim to belong to the ruling Wuffingas dynasty, suggested by the use of a Roman she-wolf and the title REX on his coins, arose from the need for strong kingship in response to the Viking attacks.  Death and canonisation  √Üthelberht was put to death by Offa under unclear circumstances, apparently at the royal vill at Sutton Walls. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, he was beheaded.Her Offa Myrcena cining het √Ü√∞elbrihte √æet heafod ofslean (from an online version of the Chronicle.) Mediaeval sources tell how he was captured while visiting his future bride √Ülfthyth and was then murdered and buried. In Richard of Cirencester's account, which cannot be substantiated, Offa's evil queen Cynethryth persuaded her husband to kill his guest, who was then was bound and beheaded by a certain Grimbert, and his body disposed of. The mediaeval historian John Brompton's Chronicon describes how the king's detached head fell off a cart into a ditch where it was found, before it restored a blind man's sight. According to the Chronicon, √Ülfthyth became a recluse at Crowland and her remorseful father founded monasteries, gave land to the Church and travelled on a pilgrimage to Rome. The execution of an Anglo-Saxon king on the orders of another ruler was very rare, although criminals were hanged and beheaded, as has been discovered at Sutton Hoo. √Üthelberht's death made the possibility of any peaceful union between the Anglian peoples, including Mercia, less likely than before. It led to Mercia's domination of East Anglia for over three decades. In 2014, metal-detectorist Darrin Simpson found a coin minted by √Üthelbert in a Sussex field. Such coins, struck as a sign of independence, may have led to √Üthelbert's death. Christopher Webb, head of coins at auctioneers Dix Noonan Webb, said, \\"This new discovery is an important and unexpected addition to the numismatic history of 8th Century England\\". It sold at auction on 11 June 2014 for ¬£78,000.  Legacy  = Veneration = Alby, Norfolk After his death, √Üthelberht was locally canonised by the Church. (Local canonisation took place before official papal canonisation had been established. The individual was 'locally venerated') He became the subject of a series of vitae dating from the eleventh century, and he was venerated in religious cults in both East Anglia and at Hereford. The Anglo-Saxon church of the episcopal estate at Hoxne was one of several dedicated to him in Suffolk,The church is mentioned in the will of Theodreusus, Bishop of London and Hoxne (c. 938 ‚Äì c. 951) a possible indication of the existence of a religious cult devoted to the saintly king. Only three dedications for √Üthelberht are near where he died ‚Äì Marden, Hereford Cathedral and Littledean ‚Äì the other eleven being in Norfolk or Suffolk. The historian Lawrence Butler has argued that this unusual pattern may be explained by the existence of a royal cult in East Anglia, which represented a \\"revival of Christianity after the Danish settlement by commemorating a politically 'safe' and corporeally distant local ruler\\". = Christian buildings dedicated to √Üthelberht = The Blessed Virgin Mary and St. Ethelbert are joint patrons of Hereford Cathedral, where the music for the Office of St Ethelbert survives in the thirteenth-century Hereford Breviary. St. Ethelbert's Gate is one of the two main entrances to the precinct of Norwich Cathedral. The chapel at Albrightestone, at a location near an important excavated Anglo-Saxon cemetery at Boss Hall in Ipswich, was dedicated to √Üthelberht. In Wiltshire, the Church of England parish church at Luckington is dedicated to St Mary and St Ethelbert. In Norfolk, the Church of England parish churches at Alby, East Wretham, Larling, Thurton, Mundham and Burnham Sutton (where there are remains of the ruined church) and the Suffolk churches at Falkenham, Hessett, Herringswell and Tannington are all dedicated to the saint. In neighbouring Essex, the parish church at Belchamp Otten is dedicated to St Ethelbert and All Saints, and the church at Stanway, originally an Anglo-Saxon chapel, is dedicated to St Albright, which is believed to be the same saint. In 1937, St Ethelbert's name was added to the parish church of St George in East Ham, Essex (now London), at the behest of Hereford Cathedral which had funded the rebuilding of the church, previously a temporary wooden structure.

This allows the use of small displacement internal combustion engines to turn aircraft propellers within an efficient speed range. History and operation The Wright brothers recognised the need for propeller reduction gearing in 1903, but it was not generally used on aircraft engines until larger engines were designed in the 1920s. Large engines with high crankshaft speeds and power outputs demanded propeller reduction, pilots noted the increase in performance of similar aircraft fitted with reduction gearing. =Types= Simple spur gear reduction Types of propeller speed reduction units include: *Chain drive *Single reduction or spur gear *Internal spur gear *Farman or bevel planetary type *Fixed sun gear *Fixed internal gear *Belt drive *Epicyclic gearing =Design variations= The Rolls-Royce Falcon engine of 1915 featured epicyclic propeller reduction gearing which contained a clutch designed to limit the maximum torque, thus protecting the reduction gears.Guttery 1969, p.27. The later Merlin engine from the same company used opposite rotation reduction gears to provide counter-rotating propellers for twin-engined aircraft, a much cheaper method than designing and building the engines to run in opposite directions.Flight 1946, pp. 92‚Äì94. The challenge with coupling gearboxes to internal combustion engines is primarily the torsional resonance that can develop at certain speeds. The load of a propeller and reduction unit can alter the resonant frequencies of the crankshaft, allowing torsional vibration to increase rapidly to high levels at certain rotational speeds. Measures taken by the designer to mitigate torsional resonances in the original design of the engine can be rendered ineffective if the resonant frequency is altered by the use of a reduction unit. Clutches and/or flexible couplings are sometimes used to prevent torsional resonance from reaching damaging levels. The Continental Tiara series engines used a single gearset to drive both the propeller and the camshaft, this allowed the propeller to run at half the engine speed.Gunston 2006, p. 191. Applications The use of propeller reduction gearing was very common during the height of piston engine use in aviation (the 1930s through the 1940s), with essentially all of the most powerful piston engines ever built for use in aircraft being designed to make use of reduction gearing. The use of a reduction unit is common in the construction of experimental homebuilt aircraft when automotive engines may be used. These engines, in addition to their lower cost, typically have less displacement than purpose- built light aircraft engines and develop peak power at high revolutions per minute (rpm), typically above 4,000 rpm. Traditional aircraft engines, where the propeller is most commonly fastened directly to the engine crankshaft, develop peak power near the peak safe and efficient speed for the propeller‚Äî2,500 to 3,000 rpm. This speed is considered the typical maximum rpm for a single-engine aircraft propeller due to the need to keep the propeller tip speed below the speed of sound. Factory-certified aircraft engines have also used reduction units integral to their design. The Cessna 175 used a geared unit which is part of the Continental GO-300 engine while the Helio Courier and several Beechcraft twins, among others, used the geared Lycoming GO-435 and GO-480. Many light sport aircraft use engines from Rotax such as the Rotax 912 which incorporates a geared reducer.

It was ported to the Atari 8-bit family, and Commodore 64. Gameplay The player controls a fighter ship sent to stop a fleet of invading aliens from building an attack base on the planet Repton. The ship is equipped with lasers and a limited number of nukes that can destroy all enemies on the screen. The player can use an invulnerable shield for defense, but cannot steer or fire while it is up. If the player puts the shield up while moving, the ship will coast to a stop. In addition, a radar screen indicates the location of enemies on the planet surface. Each level of the game is played in two parts. During the surface attack, the player fights enemies in order to delay the construction of the base. \\"Warning\\" messages indicate that a fresh wave of enemies is arriving, while an \\"Alert\\" tells of an attempt to siphon energy from the planet. If the player can fly through the enemy's energy beam in time, then pass through a charging station, the energy will be returned to the planet; otherwise, it will go into building the base. Once the base is completed, the planet's defenses trigger a bomb that destroys the entire surface and the action shifts to the caverns, where the radar does not function. Here, the player must dodge enemy attacks and eventually destroy the base's power core, after which the next level begins with increased difficulty. Reception Softline in 1983 called Repton \\"the latest in ultra-fast action arcade games\\", praising its \\"faultless animation\\". Video reviewed the Apple II version of the game in its \\"Arcade Alley\\" column where it was described as \\"pure excitement from start to finish‚Äìan involving and satisfying battle game loaded with extra features to enhance gaming pleasure.\\" Reviewers praised the game's \\"finely detailed graphics\\" and noted that \\"action is [its] hallmark\\". Ahoy! in 1984 gave Repton grades of B for graphics and C+ for gameplay. The magazine stated that the game \\"offered nothing new\\", and to only buy it if looking for \\"a definitive Defender-like shoot-em-up\\". Jerry Pournelle wrote in BYTE that despite disliking the Apple version of Repton, \\"I find myself wasting more time than I should on the Atari version\\". The Commodore 64 Home Companion stated that the game had \\"excellent visuals\\". Repton received a Certificate of Merit in the \\"1984 Computer Game of the Year\\" category at the 5th annual Arkie Awards. Legacy In 2011 Kaluzniacki released a version of Repton for the iPhone. It uses high-resolution visuals instead of pixel art, which Jeff Minter criticized for losing the flavor of the original.

Along with the Siglo XX mine, it is part of a mining complex in the area. Apart from the Catavi-Siglo XX mining complex; it refers as well to a residential area, to a mill processing ore and to an administrative office of the Corporaci√≥n Minera de Bolivia (COMIBOL).Mindat History It was acquired in the 1900s by Sim√≥n Iturri Pati√±o, who was dubbed the \\"King of Tin.\\" It was the site of continual labor strife, and many of its workers were active in the Union Federation of Bolivian Mine Workers (FSTMB). The mining camp kept the largely indigenous workforce in rigidly segregated conditions, away from the American managerial staff; housing, water supplies, shops, transport, entertainment, and bathrooms were all segregated.\\"En los campamentos de Siglo XX y Catavi se gener√≥ un modelo m√°s pr√≥ximo al apharteid que a la cuasi natural diferenciaci√≥n econ√≥mica y social entre barrios residenciales, pues se impuso la segregaci√≥n √©tnico-social como pr√°ctica cotidiana en todos los √°mbitos de la infraestructura de bienes y servicios, ya sean de tipo social, cultural, entretenimiento y de salubridad; inclusive en los servicios b√°sicos de agua potable, pulper√≠a, medios de transporte y servicios higi√©nicos.\\" This division in daily life contributed to a climate of tension between Bolivian workers and foreign management. During a labor dispute between miners and management in December 1942, the striking miners at Pati√±o's Catavi mine were massacred by government troops in the Catavi Massacre. The mine was nationalized following the \\"Bolivian National Revolution\\" of 1952, when the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (MNR) and its allies overthrew the military junta. Catavi and other mines were placed under the control of a new state agency, the Corporaci√≥n Minera de Bolivia (COMIBOL). The Catavi-Siglo XX complex became the largest component of COMIBOL, employing some 5,000 workers. On June 24, 1967, government troops under the orders of General Ren√© Barrientos and a new military junta marched on the mine and committed the largest massacre of workers in Bolivian history. The massacre occurred on St John the Baptist's Day, an indigenous winter solstice holiday, hence it became known as the San Juan Massacre. Over the following decades, the tin deposits in the mine become exhausted. In 1987, as part of an economic restructuring deal with the IMF and World Bank, the government shut down production at Catavi. References * Klein, Herbert S. (1971). \\"Prelude to the Revolution\\".

He played a key role in promoting varietal labelling of wine, was a masterful salesman of wine, and owned Ch√¢teau Prieur√©-Lichine and a share of Ch√¢teau Lascombes in the M√©doc. He was married to actress Arlene Dahl from 1965 to 1968. Biography Lichine was born in Moscow in 1913. His family fled to France during the Russian Revolution of 1917, going on to the United States in 1919. He studied economics at the University of Pennsylvania but dropped out because he felt he wasn't learning anything. In 1932 Lichine moved back to Paris and accepted a sales position with The New York Herald Tribune. In 1933 he continued in sales for The New York Herald Tribune in Algiers, and in 1934 moved back to New York as Prohibition ended. He attempted to start his own import wine company but failed, and in 1935 worked for the Cork and Bottle retail store in New York, and became a US citizen. He then went to work for Saccone and Speed, a New York wine importer, and in 1938 he was hired by wine merchant Frank Schoonmaker as his national sales manager. On the outbreak of World War II, Lichine caught the last American ocean liner out of Bordeaux, the S.S. Manhattan. During the war he served in the United States Army Military Intelligence, in Europe and North Africa and was discharged as a Major. He was given the rank of Major by the commanding headquarters of the Delta Bar Section of the US Military Intelligence. He was released at Fort Dix, New Jersey on April 18, 1946. He was awarded the Order of Leopold, the Belgium Bronze Star and the World War II recognition from the French Legion of Honor.The Pope of Wine On his return from the war, Lichine asked for full partnership in the company. Schoonmaker declined and Lichine left. In 1946 he went to work for the import wine division of United Distillers of America. In 1947 he purchased a cotton farm in Jacks Bay in St. Croix. In the same year he married the Countess Renee de Villeneuve in New York. In July 1948 he was hired by Claude Phillipe of the Waldorf Astoria New York hotel to buy wines in Europe for them. The same year he was divorced from the Countess. In 1949 Alexis hired Pierre de Wilde (from Ch√¢teau du Tertre) as his assistant wine buyer. In 1950 Lichine became the export manager for Ch√¢teau Haut-Brion. In 1955 Lichine founded Alexis Lichine Negociants in Long Island City, New York. He moved to Margaux to set up a shipping organization, Lichine & Cie., which became a leading exporter of first quality wines. In 1951 Lichine purchased Ch√¢teau Prieur√©-Lichine and in 1952 also became part owner and manager of Ch√¢teau Lascombes. In the same year he started billboard advertising of his wine tasting room at the Prieure. This was the first time in the wine industry that professional wine tasting rooms were set up for the general public. In 1953 he purchased parcels in Latricieres in Chambertin and Bonnes Mares in Chambolle-Musigny. In 1955 Alexis Lichine married Gisele Edenbourgh. Their first child Alexandra was born in 1957. Their second child Alexis Andrew Serge (Sacha) was born in 1960. In 1959 Lichine was a member of a committee that unsuccessfully launched a bid to revise the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855. Undeterred, Lichine published his own Classification des Grands Crus Rouges de Bordeaux in 1962 and made several revisions in the following years while campaigning for changes to a classification he contended was outdated. His efforts led him to be referred to as \\"the doyen of unofficial classification compilers\\". Lichine served as an expert taster in the New York Wine Tasting of 1973. In 1987, Lichine was chosen the \\"Man of the Year\\" by the wine magazine Decanter. Alexis Lichine died of cancer at Ch√¢teau Prieur√©-Lichine on June 1, 1989, aged 76. He was succeeded by his son Sacha (then aged 28), who later moved to Switzerland and sold Prieure-Lichine in August 1999. In 2008, he was posthumously inducted into the Wine Writers' Hall of Fame by the Wine Media Guild of New York. Varietal Labeling Starting around 1940, Lichine and Schoonmaker promoted the idea that California producers should label their wines by the grape variety or varieties from which they were made. The standard practice among New World producers was to give their wines semi-generic labels. That is, they named them after the regions whose wines they resembled. For example, full-bodied red varieties might be labeled \\"Burgundy\\", whereas crisp whites might be labeled \\"Chablis\\". California's Wente Vineyards was the first winery to adopt the practice. After calling its Sauvignon blanc by its varietal name rather than labeling it \\"Graves,\\" Lichine and Schoonmaker found its sales volume to increase several- fold. More importantly, they were able to sell it in the important east coast U.S. market. Others, such as Robert Mondavi, soon adopted the practice, which has become the standard for New World (and, increasingly, some Old World) wines.

Los Amigos High School is located at the southeast corner of Newhope St. and Heil Ave. - one block east of Mile Square Park. School history Los Amigos High School first opened its doors to students in 1968. The first classes of 1968-69 were sophomores who had been freshmen at La Quinta High School (Westminster, California) and new freshmen from Fitz Intermediate School, so there were only two classes (freshmen and sophomores) during that first school year. As the years progressed, freshmen were added. The second year (1969‚Äì70) had three classes‚Äîfreshmen, sophomores, and juniors. It would be the academic year 1970-71 before the school had all four classes‚Äîfreshmen through seniors. The first graduating class was 1971. The class of 1972 collected enough money to paint Los Amigos High School and the school mascot, the Lobo (wolf), across the front of the gymnasium as shown in the photo above. Hal Butler was the principal during these early years. Conceived at a time when \\"open education\\" was the movement of the day in public education, Los Amigos was constructed in a rather unconventional manner for the warm climate of Southern California. Not only were both of the school's primary classroom buildings - the \\"L\\" and \\"M\\" buildings - built with interior corridors, all classrooms were built without doors. It would not be until the late 1990s before all classrooms at Los Amigos were provided with doors. Recently the school installed several new classrooms the \\"A\\",\\"B\\",\\"C\\" and \\"D\\" portables to accommodate the increasing number of freshmen each year. The school has now remodeled their \\"M\\" and \\"L\\" buildings with new modifications to the classrooms. The \\"L\\" building has been dubbed the 100 Building and the \\"M\\" building has been named the 200 building. Since opening its doors in 1968, Los Amigos has been led by the following Principals: 1968 - ?: Hal Butler, 199? - 1998: George Wilson, 1998 - 2009: Connie Van Luit, 2009 - 2014: Robin Patterson 2014‚Äì2019: Vicky Braddock 2019-present: Amy Avina Best High Schools- Silver Medal.http://education.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/listings/high- schools/california/los_amigos_high_school Academics Los Amigos is a Title 1 School.

It has smooth bark, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of three or seven, white flowers and cup-shaped, bell-shaped or hemispherical fruit.flower budsimmature fruit Description Eucalyptus dalrympleana is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth white to yellowish bark, sometimes with a short stocking of rough bark. Young plants and coppice regrowth have leaves arranged in opposite pairs and are egg-shaped or heart-shaped to more or less round, long and wide. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, lance-shaped to curved, the same colour on both sides, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of three or seven in leaf axils on a peduncle long, the individual buds sessile or on a pedicel up to long. Mature buds are oval, green to yellow, long and wide with a conical to rounded operculum. Flowering mainly occurs between March and June and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody cup-shaped, bell-shaped or hemispherical capsule long and wide. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus dalrympleana was first formally described in 1920 by Joseph Maiden from a specimen collected by Wilfred de Beuzeville near Yarrangobilly. The description was published in Maiden's book, The Forest Flora of New South Wales. The specific epithet (dalrympleana) honours the forester, Richard Dalrymple Hay. In 1962, Lawrie Johnson described two subspecies and the names have been accepted by the Australian Plant Census: * Eucalyptus dalrympleana Maiden subsp. dalrympleana has flower buds arranged in groups of three; * Eucalyptus dalrympleana subsp. heptantha L.A.S.Johnson has flower buds and flowers in groups of seven. Distribution and habitat Mountain gum grows in woodland and forest at higher elevations in far south-eastern Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. Subspecies heptantha is only found in far south-eastern Queensland and on the northern tablelands of New South Wales. Subspecies dalrympleana occurs south from the central and southern tablelands of New South Wales. The species is rare in South Australia where it only occurs in the Mount Lofty Ranges. Use in horticulture In cultivation in the UK, E. dalrympleana is fully hardy down to but prefers some shelter. It grows best in full sun. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. References * Holliday, I.

Founded in 1904, t is located in the upper part of the alpine village in the area of Surmulins. There are around 300 pupils , including 220 in the boarding school. The boarders originate from over 30 countries, such as Italy, Russia, Germany and the U.S.  History  Founded in 1904 Lyceum Alpinum is one of the oldest private boarding schools in Switzerland. It is located above sea level on the Swiss Alps of Zuoz, near the alpine village of St. Moritz, Switzerland. The school was founded by a group of locals from the Engadine as an institution for ailing boys, whose parents were spending their vacation in St.Moritz, so that they could benefit from the mountain air and did not fall behind in any of their subjects. It was at the time called the \\"Institut Engiadina\\", and had 22 students in its first year and was run by a director and two teachers. However, it very soon developed into a fully-fledged secondary school for boys, later on girls were also admitted and the school attained its international reputation. It is attended by around 200 boarders and 100 day pupils from the region. The pupils are between 11 and 21 years old. It is known for its cultural diversity and extensive sports programme; the pupils themselves come from over 30 different countries. Most frequently from Switzerland, Germany, Russia, China and Austria.  Academic curriculum  Students at the school can study for internationally recognised higher education entrance qualifications. On offer are the Swiss Matura (German or German/English), the German Abitur and, exclusively in English, the International Baccalaureate. About three hundred students between 12 and 18 years of age from around the world follow programmes leading to the International Baccalaureate Diploma (IB), the Swiss Matura (German) or the bilingual Swiss Matura (German/English) and German Abitur.

In the former case it may be called necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum (NLD). NLD occurs in approximately 0.3% of the diabetic population, with the majority of sufferers being women (approximately 3:1 females to males affected). The severity or control of diabetes in an individual does not affect who will or will not get NLD. Better maintenance of diabetes after being diagnosed with NLD will not change how quickly the NLD will resolve.  Signs and symptoms  NL/NLD most frequently appears on the patient's shins, often on both legs, although it may also occur on forearms, hands, trunk, and, rarely, nipple, penis, and surgical sites. The lesions are often asymptomatic but may become tender and ulcerate when injured. The first symptom of NL is often a \\"bruised\\" appearance (erythema) that is not necessarily associated with a known injury. The extent to which NL is inherited is unknown. NLD appears as a hardened, raised area of the skin. The center of the affected area usually has a yellowish tint while the area surrounding it is a dark pink. It is possible for the affected area to spread or turn into an open sore. When this happens the patient is at greater risk of developing ulcers. If an injury to the skin occurs on the affected area, it may not heal properly or it will leave a dark scar. Pathophysiology Although the exact cause of this condition is not known, it is an inflammatory disorder characterised by collagen degeneration, combined with a granulomatous response. It always involves the dermis diffusely, and sometimes also involves the deeper fat layer. Commonly, dermal blood vessels are thickened (microangiopathy). It can be precipitated by local trauma, though it often occurs without any injury.  Diagnosis  Micrograph showing necrobiosis lipoidica in a punch biopsy. NL is diagnosed by a skin biopsy, demonstrating superficial and deep perivascular and interstitial mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate (including lymphocytes, plasma cells, mononucleated and multinucleated histiocytes, and eosinophils) in the dermis and subcutis, as well as necrotising vasculitis with adjacent necrobiosis and necrosis of adnexal structures. Areas of necrobiosis are often more extensive and less well defined than in granuloma annulare. Presence of lipid in necrobiotic areas may be demonstrated by Sudan stains. Cholesterol clefts, fibrin, and mucin may also be present in areas of necrobiosis. Depending on the severity of the necrobiosis, certain cell types may be more predominant. When a lesion is in its early stages, neutrophils may be present, whereas in later stages of development lymphocytes and histiocytes may be more predominant. Treatment There is no clearly defined cure for necrobiosis.AOCD Website NLD may be treated with PUVA therapy and improved therapeutic control. Although there are some techniques that can be used to diminish the signs of necrobiosis such as low dose aspirin orally, a steroid cream or injection into the affected area, this process may be effective for only a small percentage of those treated.

Hot Dog Days are informal events that are celebrated in communities throughout the hotdog-eating world, including the United States, Canada and Australia. Their origin is obscure. As the name suggests, the festivals revolve around eating hot dogs, but usually there are many other activities such as wiener dog races, root beer chugging contests, and face painting. Often the proceeds from a hot dog day are given to charity. Industry groups, such as National Hot Dog and Sausage Council in the USA, encourage, sponsor, and support the events. The Council designates July as National Hot Dog Month; National Hot Dog Day varies year to year. It's usually the 3rd Wednesday of July, but in 2020 it falls on Wednesday, July 22 ‚Äì based on when the North American Meat Institute hosts its annual Hot Dog Lunch on Capitol Hill. The council also gives advice on hot-dog eating etiquette, which aren't considered strict, as most Hot Dog Day style events do not adhere to them. Notable Hot Dog Festivals =Alfred Village Hot Dog Day= A crowd at Hot Dog Day 2007. Alfred University's Howell Hall and statue of King Alfred are visible on the left. Hot Dog Day is celebrated in the spring in the village of Alfred, New York. It has been celebrated since 1971, when students first proposed it. The event is focused on the hot dog, a food popular among college students for its cheapness and ease of preparation. In the early years, festival-goers could buy a hot dog and a drink for a quarter. Hot Dog Day itself is usually the third Saturday in April, although many students celebrate the entire \\"hot dog week\\", running from that Wednesday to that Sunday. Hot Dog Day, which is organized primarily by students from Alfred University and Alfred State College, raises money for local charities and community organizations such as Alfred Fire Department (A.E. Crandall Hook & Ladder Co.) and Alfred Montessori School. Events typically include a parade, ice cream social, \\"fun run\\", mud Olympics, hot dog eating contests, carnival, live music, a chicken barbecue and numerous hot dog stands. Main Street is closed to traffic during the parade and originally hosted most of these activities. In recent years, the carnival and arts & crafts fair have been held on the campuses, alternating between them each year. Hot Dog Day is often the time chosen for alumni reunions for Alfred's two colleges. =Annual Hot Dog Lunch on Capitol Hill= The Annual Hot Dog Lunch in Washington, D.C., is one of the most popular social events on Capitol Hill. Sponsored by the North American Meat Institute for the past 40 years, more than 1,000 members of Congress, Administration officials, journalists and lobbyists gather in a courtyard for a huge hot dog picnic. At the lunch, hot dog companies serve their franks from traditional hot dog carts and popular retired major league baseball players sign autographs for attendees. =Boston Hot Dog Safari= The Boston Hot Dog Safari is an annual charity benefit founded by Boston sports radio host Eddie Andelman. The charity began in 1990 to help find a cure for cystic fibrosis by raising money for the Joey Fund, named after a friend of his who died of the disease in 1986 at the age of twelve. One of Andelman's all-time favorite foods are hot dogs, which is why the charity is called the Hot Dog Safari. The Hot Dog Safari is one of the most popular charity events in Boston today. Over the years, it has a gained a steady flow of participants as well as money for charity. In one single day, an estimated $150,000 dollars was raised to help find a cure for cystic fibrosis. Medical experts said that a cure for the disease is close to being found in only a few years' time. The Safari is an all-you-eat supply of hot dogs, sausages, and ice cream sundaes. Money is earned from tickets (sold either at the door or in advance) and raffles. Entertainment is also provided. =West Virginia Hot Dog Festival= The West Virginia Hot Dog Festival has been held in Huntington, West Virginia, on the last Saturday in July since 2005. A charitable event, the festival may raise $10,000 or more for the children's cancer unit at the Edwards' Comprehensive Cancer Center. Activities include a bun run (or walk), a weiner dog race, the owner-dog look-alike contest, a car and truck show, a hotdog eating contest, and a harmonica championship.

The film revolves around Jake Huard, a young man who dreams of one day attending the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. It was released January 27, 2006 in the United States. As of February 12, 2006, the film grossed an approximate total of US$17.2 million in the United States, and was produced for a $26-million budget. Annapolis scored mostly negative reviews from critics but found an audience on DVD selling over 4 million copies and staying on top 10 rental lists around the U.S. Summary Jake Huard wakes up after being knocked down during a boxing match. After beating his opponent, he returns to the home he shares with his distant father, who is also his employer at a naval shipyard, building vessels for the Navy and doubts Jake's ability to amount to anything. Huard is visited by Lieutenant Commander Burton, telling Jake that his application to the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland has been recently accepted. At a bar where Huard and his friends are celebrating, his friends introduce him to a young woman named Ali, whom they claim is a prostitute hired as a going-away present. Huard's attempts to seduce Ali are unsuccessful, and his farewell with his father leaves him frustrated. On his first day at the Academy, Huard discovers that one of his instructors is Ali, a Midshipman 2nd Class (an upperclassman) is the same woman that his friends introduced him to. She and her fellow instructor, Whitaker, begin hazing Huard's class of plebes, and that Huard in particular is behind academically. Their company commander, Midshipman Lieutenant Cole, had been an enlisted Marine prior to joining the Academy; announces his intent to run out any midshipman he deems unfit to be an officer.Gal Perl Finkel, A NEW STRATEGY AGAINST ISIS, The Jerusalem Post, March 7, 2017. Retrieved October 20, 2020. Huard's roommates include overweight Nance (nicknamed Twins), Loo, and Estrada, who is being singled out by Whitaker because of his ethnicity. Ordered by Whitaker to take multiple showers per day due to a perceived stench, Estrada one day fails to complete his task but nevertheless reports to Whitaker that the orders were fully executed. Loo informs Cole of Estrada's dishonor, and Estrada is processed out of the Naval Academy. Meanwhile, Huard's class becomes increasingly frustrated from suffering due to his failures, as evidenced by Loo moving out of the room. Nance explains his refusal to leave by noting that the instructors are so focused on Huard that they are leaving him alone. While home on winter leave, Huard intends not to return until he discovers that his father made a wager, expecting Huard to fail. Upon his return, the class begins instruction in boxing, and it is announced that a midshipman tournament; the Brigades, will occur at the end of the year. After Huard angers the boxing instructor with some unsportsmanlike conduct toward Cole in the ring, he is forced to train by himself. During an after-hours match with Burton, Huard swallows his pride and admits he needs help training; enlisting Ali and Burton for physical training, and Nance to gain enough weight to be in Cole's weight class. In his match with Loo, he endures some taunting and returns with a single-punch knockout, earning him Loo's respect and support. Huard also begins to excel in his classes, gaining respect with the rest of his class when he proves capable of performing academically. During the tournament, Jake progresses and defeats Whitaker in the semifinals, leaving him and Cole for the final match. After Nance fails by just four seconds to successfully complete the obstacle course, Cole informs Nance that he will be kicked out from the Academy. Nance attempts suicide, prompting Huard to tackle Cole in anger. Expecting to be kicked out as well, Huard begins to pack up and leave, until Cole approaches him and informs him that he has requested more time from the disciplinary board; delaying the hearing until after the final Brigades match. After some encouragement from the recovering Nance, Huard steps into the ring to fight Cole, lasting a full three rounds. Although Cole wins by decision, Huard's boxing ability earns him the respect of the entire Academy, as well as his father, who has come to see the fight. At his hearing, the disciplinary board decides to retain Huard, based on Cole's recommendation. The Class of 2008 celebrates the end of their Plebe year, while Huard and Ali finally express their mutual attraction openly. Huard approaches newly-commissioned Second Lieutenant Cole to ask who would have won if the fight had continued, to which Cole challenges Huard to join the Marines to find out.

It received mostly negative reviews from critics, and holds a 10% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 111 reviews. Controversy Upon reviewing the script, the Chief of Naval Information commented: :This picture was made without the support of the Department of the Navy and the Department of Defense ... the story depicted in the script did not accurately portray the Academy, its standards for training, and its methods of shaping midshipmen mentally, morally and physically for service in the U.S. Navy. Based on this, the producers were not allowed further access to the Academy grounds or provided with any other support for the filming. :Navy personnel should avoid the appearance of support to the film as members of the Department of the Navy. Anyone attending a screening or promotional activity for the film should not attend in uniform. Because of the lack of access to Annapolis Naval Academy, the movie was filmed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at Girard College and at the decommissioned Philadelphia Naval Shipyard.

Its primary purpose is to convert scanned bitmaps into vector artwork. Streamline is similar in function to competitors, such as Corel Trace, but was advertised as a standalone rather than an additional utility within a full drawing suite. Streamline was discontinued after Adobe Illustrator CS2 introduced a new tracing tool entitled Live Trace, which provides fast tracing, fine control, as well as a \\"live link\\" to the bitmap being traced.Adobe StreamLine 4.0 A test of the native Illustrator 9 auto- trace function by Creative Pro in 2002 concluded: \\"The premier tracing utility is StreamLine, which is infinitely controllable and very accurate.\\" http://www.creativepro.com/story/feature/18132.html?cprose=3-46 History In 1989, at the MacWorld Exposition in San Francisco, Adobe introduced Adobe Streamline. They demonstrated it as a program that could reproduce hardcopy graphics onscreen, converting bit-mapped images to high-quality PostScript artwork. Later, Adobe released Streamline for IBM computers and the Windows operating system.http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/adobe- systems-inc-history/ Adobe Streamline 4.0 was priced at $199.00 for a new user and $69.00 as an upgrade. After Adobe Streamline 4.0, the most popular tools in the program, those relating to line conversion, were incorporated into Adobe Illustrator CS2's Live Trace tool. Uses of Adobe Streamline Adobe Streamline is advertised as a way to convert images into line art (bitmap into vectors). In the User Guide for Streamline 3.0, Adobe gives many examples of what the program can be used for. Besides creating a line drawing from a photo, Adobe suggests posterizing a photo and editing color, colorizing greyscale images, and using other special line effects. They also show users creating movie posters, business logos, architectural sketches, brochures, legal forms, newsletters, stamp blocks, and illustrations. Users can then export their work from Adobe Streamline and edit it in other ways in Adobe Illustrator. Features Features new to Version 3.0 * One can now convert color photographic images or color drawings into PostScript language artwork containing up to 256 colors. Users have the ability to create and save custom colors and import custom color styles from Adobe Illustrator files. * Adobe added interactive editing, meaning when a user edits and paints the image, the effects are shown immediately. * Users can edit an image in Preview Mode, allowing him or her to see colors and illustration features as edits are taking place. Users can also preview only selected parts of the image, reducing the time it takes to redraw the screen during editing. * Adobe added the ability to save images in Aldus Freehand format (in addition to Adobe Illustrator, PICT, and DXF). * Users can now instantly save and retrieve conversion options. * In 3.0 Adobe introduced support for acquiring images directly from a scanner. * Users have an expanded palette of editing tools (including the magic wand tool). * Users can now cut and paste PostScript language artwork on the Clipboard, allowing interaction with other programs such as Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop. * Adobe added support for copying line art into Adobe Photoshop 2.5 file format. Features new to Version 4.0 *Scan images and sketches into Adobe Streamline, or import line art, logos, color photos, and other art files. Begin by using predetermined settings for ease of learning, then experiment with custom conversion settings, such as outline, centerline, line recognition, and more. Save them for reuse, minimizing the work for later conversions. *Convert without gaps, overlapping paths, or other inaccuracies. Streamline compensates for improper alignment of scanned images and straightens horizontal and vertical lines. *Let Adobe Streamline select the appropriate colors up to an unlimited number, or specify a custom color list (spot colors).Simulate duotones, tritones, and quadtones with tints of custom colors. *Designate separate settings specific to different areas of the same image. If you have multiple images to convert - such as a set of logos - you can batch process all the files. Compatibility Adobe Streamline was integrated with many other Adobe products such as Adobe Photoshop, Adobe PageMaker, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Dimensions, and Adobe PageMill.

In theatre Tiller had noticed the overall effect of a chorus of dancers was often spoiled by lack of discipline. Tiller found that by linking arms the dancers could dance as one; he is credited with inventing precision dance. Possibly most famous for their high-kicking routines, the Tiller Girls were highly trained and precise. John Tiller's first dancers performed as 'Les Jolies Petites'. He originally formed the group for the pantomime 'Robinson Crusoe', subtitled 'The Good Friday That Came on a Saturday', in 1890 at the Prince of Wales Theatre, Liverpool. From this were founded the Tiller School of Dancing and the Tiller Girl troupes. The number of troupes grew to dozens, and their fame spread around the world. The troupes were all slightly different, but within each troupe the girls were matched very precisely by height and weight. Individuality within the troupes was discouraged in favour of a strong group ethic. The Tillers performed as resident dancers at the Folies Berg√®re in Paris, the London Palladium, the Palace Theatres in Manchester and in London (as the Palace Girls or Sunshine Girls), the Blackpool Winter Gardens, on New York's Broadway, where Tiller had a dance school, and at hundreds of other theatres throughout Europe and the United States. One Tiller group, the Pony Ballet, earned success in the U.S. in musical comedy and vaudeville, performing from 1899 to 1914. The leader of the Pony Ballet, Beatrice Liddell, in a 1911 newspaper interview described the Tiller school of the late 1890s as having a boarding school facility in Limehouse, Manchester where girls aged five to ten were taught academic subjects as well as dance, to gauge their aptitude for dancing. Promising students graduated to Tiller's Covent Garden, London facility. Tiller routines and line-ups The Tiller Girls performed a 'Tap and Kick' routine, which was originally called 'Fancy-Dancing' but today is known as 'Precision Dancing'. The routines may consist of straight lines or geometric figures. Siegfried Kracauer stated in 1923, \\"These 76 energetic women dance about in geometric shapes: the regularity of their patterns is cheered by the masses, themselves arranged by the stands in tier upon ordered tier.\\"Siegfried Kracauer, \\"The Mass Ornament,\\" The Mass Ornament: Weimar Essays, trans. Thomas Y. Levin (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2005), 74-75. In certain shows a Tiller line-up could be as many as 32 girls who were selected for uniform height and weight. In 1923 the stage play Nifties of 1923 featured twelve Tiller Girls. After John Tiller After John Tiller's death in 1925, the Tiller schools in the U.K. were kept alive first by his wife Jennie Tiller, then by some of the head girls. The U.S. Tiller school in New York City was continued under the leadership of Mary Read until 1935.Boltz family archives By the 1940s The John Tiller Schools of Dancing were managed by its 3 directors. Mr John Smith, Miss Doris Alloway and Miss Barbara Aitken (also choreographer and a former Tiller Girl). During the 1940s the Tiller Girls were popular, appearing in summer seasons, pantomimes, variety tours, London West End shows, and cabaret. 1950s heyday During the 50s, as travel became easier after World War II, Tiller Troupes began to work abroad again. The Tiller Girls' popularity continued to increase. They were invited to make several appearances at the Royal Variety Performance, notably in 1953 at the London Coliseum when there were 40 girls in the line-up. As far as is known, neither before or since, has there been a longer line of girls performing a kicking routine (the Rockettes have 36). On Sept 24th 1955 a Tiller Troupe appeared in the first Saturday night variety show transmitted on the new ITV channel which had been launched 2 days earlier. During the remainder of the 1950s and during the 1960s the Tiller Girls established themselves as the premier dance troupe on British commercial television, being associated particularly with the iconic Sunday Night at the London Palladium. During the 1970s, management of the troupes was taken over by the impresario Robert Luff and also around that time dance troupes with different styles were emerging. For the first time since their inception the popularity of Tillers went into decline until the formation of the Sixties Tiller Girls. The 60s Tiller Girls  Towards the end of 1988 a former Tiller Girl, Sandy Jones, received a surprise call from a friend, George May, who was working on a production named Joy to the World, to be staged at the Albert Hall in London. He wanted the Tiller Girls to take part in \\"The Twelve Days of Christmas\\" song as the \\"nine ladies dancing.\\" Sandy made eight phone calls to original Tiller Girls from the 50s and 60s, and all eight immediately agreed, with her making the nine needed. The ladies truly enjoyed the experience, made especially poignant as none expected to be Tiller Girls again after so many years. Then, in later 1988, there was a news bulletin on the actor Terry-Thomas who was suffering with Parkinson's. Jack Douglas, the Carry On comedian was putting on a charity show at the Drury Lane Theatre to aid both Terry and Parkinson's UK, a research and support charity. Bruce Vincent, husband of June Vincent (n√©e Labbett), herself a former Tiller girl from 1958 to 1969, phoned Jack Douglas and asked if he would like a troupe of Tiller Girls in the show, to which the answer was a resounding \\"Yes\\". From there on in, a busy four months started to get a full troupe of sixteen girls together (all bona fide former Tiller Girls), together with full costumes, music and of course rehearsals. Wendy Clarke, a former Head Girl took up the responsibility of the choreography and when the troupe of sixteen girls performed on the stage that night the response from the audience was electric and The 60s Tiller Girls were quite literally born. This original troupe of ladies, ages ranging from early 40s to late 50s, carried on kicking in shows for over a twenty-year period in over 180 shows under Bruce Vincent's stewardship. This re-formed troupe were fortunate enough to appear in many different shows, mainly for charity, and ranged from appearances from Sevenoaks School to Buckingham Palace, Westcliff- on-Sea to the West End's London Palladium. The shows at the London Palladium were always the ladies' favourite shows as they considered the Palladium their \\"spiritual\\" home. To this day, some of the original 1960s Tiller Girls do backstage tours at the London Palladium in full costume, as arranged by the Palladium's box office. After many prestigious charitable events all over the UK, including 40 Glorious Years, for H.M. The Queen, and being semi-adopted by Lily Savage, aka Paul O'Grady, for his shows and videos in the 1990s. The 1960s Tiller Girls formally announced their retirement and final show in April 2011, a cabaret show in aid of Vera Lynn's Children's Charity. The ladies were then in their late 60s and early 70s, a fantastic achievement for any dancer, and the joy and pride of bearing the Tiller Girl name was thus passed on into its third century, with the baton being firmly and happily passed to the relaunched Tiller Girls. Re-launch World Dance Management re-launched the Tiller Girls on 16 May 2012, having been awarded worldwide rights and an exclusive trademark licence agreement to Bernard Tiller, great grandson of John Tiller, founder of the original troupe. He owns the exclusive rights to the name. Marina Blore, director of World Dance Management said: \\"As an ex dancer and choreographer, I remember The Tiller Girls of the late 60s and 70s and professional dancers everywhere held them in very high regard. Being a Tiller always commanded respect. It is a huge honour to be handed the reins to re-launch The Tiller Girls and whilst we plan to make the look and choreography relevant to today‚Äôs audience, the original traditions and disciplines of precision dance will be an integral part of the new look Tiller Girls.\\" Plans World Dance Management plan to launch The Tiller Girls and they already have interest from television in following the reformation of the dance troupe and the appointment of a choreographer/artistic director, costume designer and nationwide auditions of the dancers. Bernard Tiller explains: \\"For a number of years I have been looking for a partner who can revive the Tiller Girls. World Dance Management is without doubt the best company to take the Tiller Girl name forward. This is something that I have been working on and dreaming for over thirty years and hope this will again see 'The Tiller Girls' name up in lights and the tradition of the past dancers carried forward to a new generation.\\"Bernard Tiller http://www.worlddancemanagement.com/the- tiller-girls/ The Radio City Rockettes connection The Radio City Music Hall Rockettes, an American dance troupe, follow and keep alive the Tiller Girls' tradition of high-kicking precision dancing. Russell Markert, founder of The Rockettes, reminisced: \\"I had seen the Tiller girls in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1922. If I ever got a chance to get a group of American girls who would be taller and have longer legs and could do really complicated tap routines and eye-high kicks, they'd knock your socks off!\\" The Rockettes first came to life in 1925 as the \\"Missouri Rockets\\" and made their show business debut in St. Louis, the realisation of a long-time dream of their creator, Russell Markert. Some of the Tiller Girls and American girls who trained with Mary Read also danced in the Rockettes. Lily Smart who trained with the Tiller School of Dance in Manchester and was with the 1922 troupe in the Ziegfeld Follies, settled in America and joined the Rockettes after leaving the Tiller Girls, performing with them for many years. She was then involved with the training of new dancers, Lily was in constant contact with Bernard Tiller until her death in 2010, aged 106. Lily explained how Russell Markert added his own style to the Precision Dance routines; this found its way back to the Tiller girls in the United Kingdom.http://www.tillergirls.com/Tiller_Page_3.htm Lily Smart and Joan Johannes Girls who had visited the United States during the late 1930s and 1940s danced for the troops and liked the American style of dancing and the costumes with headdresses that they saw. American films also featured showgirls and had a big impact on the British audience. From the late 1940s through the 1970s the Tiller girls adopted a lot of American showgirl styles that could trace their roots back to the Folies Berg√®re in the late 1890s.

He uses his powerful connections to control his mother who is attempting to sway the Assembly otherwise. The book begins with Roca, in hiding, trying to get to the Assembly meeting. During her voyage, she ends up stranded on a planet known as Skyfall. There, on a planet once part of the Ruby Empire but now antiquated in its technology, she meets Eldrinson Valdoria, and due to extreme weather and lack of incoming ships, she is stranded there for approximately one year. During that time she falls in love with Eldrinson and becomes pregnant. The novel also periodically shifts to describe the perspective of Kurj, a Primary (top ranking) Jagernaut (most feared warriors of the Skolian Empire) and grandson of the ruling couple of Skolian Empire, Pharaoh Lahaylia and Imperator Jarac. Kurj is obsessed with stopping the slave-driven empire of the Traders. But when his mother escapes his clutches, he fears the worst, and spends much of the novel obsessing over finding her instead. We also learn of some of the horrors from his past, giving meaning to his stoic nature. Back on the planet of Skyfall, Roca and her new husband come under siege by a rival who claims the title that Eldrinson possesses. At the point of his final breach into the castle, Kurj arrives with his much superior technology, and ceases hostilities. Roca gives birth to her child which she names Eldrin. The remainder of the novel revolves around the forced separation of Eldrinson from Roca and his child.

In 1969, President Richard Nixon appointed California's Lieutenant Governor Robert Finch to be the U.S. Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare. To fill the vacancy, Governor Ronald Reagan appointed then- Congressman Reinecke as Lieutenant Governor on January 9, 1969. He was re- elected in 1970. In 1974, Reinecke ran for the Republican nomination for Governor of California to succeed Reagan, who chose not to seek a third term. As part of the conservative wing of the Republican Party in contrast with the more moderate State Controller Houston Flournoy, he could expect a strong conservative turnout for the primary election. Early in the race, he held a lead over Flournoy. He had just earned the endorsement of the California Republican Assembly, a leading conservative group, when a Federal grand jury indicted him for perjury on April 3, 1974. Indictment and Conviction Reinecke's indictment was an offshoot of the investigation into the Watergate scandal. In 1972, he testified before the Senate during a confirmation hearing of Richard Kleindienst, the nominee for Attorney General. He was asked about an offer by Sheraton Hotels, a division of ITT Inc., which was the subject of a Federal antitrust investigation, to underwrite the 1972 Republican National Convention. Specifically, the committee wanted to know if he discussed the offer with the Watergate figure and former Attorney General John N. Mitchell (R) before of after ITT settled its case with the government. He told Senator Hiram Fong that the conversation took place after the settlement despite his earlier comment to a reporter that the conversation had taken place several months earlier. Reinecke stayed in the race for governor, but was defeated by Flournoy, who went on to lose to Jerry Brown (D) in the general election. He was convicted of perjury in July 1974, but refused to resign until the state law required him to do so. California law barred anyone convicted of perjury from holding office in the state; but the state attorney general ruled that this provision would not take effect until sentencing. On October 2, 1974, he was sentenced to an 18-month suspended term and resigned from office the same day. On December 8, 1975, an appeals court overturned the ruling because \\"the Senate Judiciary Committee before which he was accused of perjuring himself had failed to publish its rule permitting a one-man quorum.\\" Ronald J.

They were the first ranchers to import and breed Charolais cattle in El Dorado County, California.

His lab was located in the basement of Sterling Hall. He was in the process of cooling down his dewar with liquid nitrogen when the explosion occurred. Rescuers found him face down in about a foot of water. The cause of death, determined from the autopsy, was internal trauma. As a protest against the Vietnam War, the bomb was built and planted by Karleton \\"Karl\\" Armstrong, Dwight Armstrong, David Fine, and Leo Burt.

They first appear during the Early Pennsylvanian epoch (i.e.: Archaeothyris, and perhaps an even earlier genus, Protoclepsydrops), and represent just one of the many stages in the acquiring of mammal-like characteristics (Kemp 1982), in contrast to their earlier amniote ancestors. The defining characteristics which separate these animals from the Caseasauria (also pelycosaurs) are based on details of proportion of certain bones of the skull. These include a long, narrow supratemporal bone (in contrast to caseasaurs where this bone is almost as wide as it is long), and a frontal bone with a wider connection to the upper margin of the orbit (Laurin and Reisz 1997). Evolution Many non-therapsid eupelycosaurs were the dominant land animals from the latest Carboniferous to the end of the Early Permian epoch. Ophiacodontids were common from their appearance in the late Carboniferous (Pennsylvanian) to the early Permian, but they became progressively smaller as the early Permian progressed. The edaphosaurids, along with the caseids, were the dominant herbivores in the early part of the Permian, ranging from the size of a pig to the size of a rhinoceros. The most renowned edaphosaurid is Edaphosaurus, a large [] herbivore which had a sail on its back, probably used for thermoregulation and mating. Sphenacodontids, a family of carnivorous eupelycosaurs, included the famous Dimetrodon, which is sometimes mistaken for a dinosaur, and was the largest predator of the period. Like Edaphosaurus, Dimetrodon also had a distinctive sail on its back, and it probably served the same purpose - regulating heat. The varanopid family passingly resembled today's monitor lizards and may have had the same lifestyle.Paleos Synapsida Therapsids descended from a clade closely related to the sphenacodontids. They became the succeeding dominant land animals for the rest of the Permian, and in the latter part of the Triassic, therapsids gave rise to the first true mammals. All non-therapsid pelycosaurs, as well as many other life forms, became extinct at the end of Permian period.

Buron Rogers Fitts (March 22, 1895 ‚Äì March 29, 1973) was the 29th lieutenant governor of California, from 1927 to 1928, and Los Angeles County district attorney thereafter until 1940. Early life Born in Belcherville, Texas, Fitts received his law degree in 1916 from the University of Southern California, and while a student there worked as a clerk for the prominent attorney Earl Rogers. Fitts was a severely injured veteran of World War I whose base of political support lay in the American Legion organization of war veterans. He had been shot in the knee in the Battle of Argonne and limped for the rest of his life. Career He was appointed deputy district attorney for Los Angeles County in 1920 during the term of Thomas Lee Woolwine and chief deputy in 1924 under Asa Keyes. He was elected lieutenant governor in 1926 and served in the administration of Governor C.C. Young. Fitts's term as lieutenant governor was from January 4, 1927, to November 30, 1928. Governor Young appointed H. L. Carnahan as lieutenant governor on December 4, 1928, to succeed Fitts. In 1928, Keyes was indicted for bribery (in connection with the Julian Petroleum Company scandal), and Fitts resigned effective November 30 of that year to become a special prosecutor in that case. He was elected district attorney (the county's chief law officer) as well. Fitts was elected for a second term in 1932, and he investigated the death of Hollywood producer-director- screenwriter Paul Bern, the husband of actress Jean Harlow. Samuel Marx, in his book Deadly Illusions (1990) accuses Fitts of having been bribed by MGM studio officials to accept a fabricated version of Bern's suicide to avoid scandal in Hollywood. Fitts was also indicted for bribery and perjury in 1934 for allegedly taking a bribe to drop a statutory rape charge against a millionaire real-estate promoter. He was acquitted two years later. He was also accused of using his position to block action against the rapist of Patricia Douglas at the MGM Sales Convention in 1937, a case that was the subject of David Stenn's 2007 documentary film Girl 27. Fitts was elected to a third term as district attorney in 1936 and remained until 1940, when he was defeated by a reform candidate, John F. Dockweiler. Fitts, J.D. Fredricks (1903‚Äì1915), and Steve Cooley (2000-2012) are only Los Angeles County District Attorneys to serve three complete terms. On March 7, 1937, Fitts was wounded by a volley of shots fired through the windshield of his car. Nobody was ever arrested in that case. He joined the Army Air Corps in 1942 with the rank of major. He was chief, intelligence, Pacific Overseas Air Technical Services. Death Fitts' last residence was in Three Rivers, in Tulare County, California, where he committed suicide by a pistol shot to the head on March 29, 1973, one week after his 78th birthday.

The result of the campaign was the surrender of the British Army force of General Charles Earl Cornwallis, an event that led directly to the beginning of serious peace negotiations and the eventual end of the war. The campaign was marked by disagreements, indecision, and miscommunication on the part of British leaders, and by a remarkable set of cooperative decisions, at times in violation of orders, by the French and Americans. The campaign involved land and naval forces of Great Britain and France, and land forces of the United States. British forces were sent to Virginia between January and April 1781 and joined with Cornwallis's army in May, which came north from an extended campaign through the southern states. These forces were first opposed weakly by Virginia militia, but General George Washington sent first Marquis de Lafayette and then \\"Mad\\" Anthony Wayne with Continental Army troops to oppose the raiding and economic havoc the British were wreaking. The combined American forces, however, were insufficient in number to oppose the combined British forces, and it was only after a series of controversially confusing orders by General Sir Henry Clinton, the British commander-in-chief, that Cornwallis moved to Yorktown in July and built a defensive position that was strong against the land forces he then faced, but was vulnerable to naval blockade and siege. British naval forces in North America and the West Indies were weaker than the combined fleets of France and Spain, and, after some critical decisions and tactical missteps by British naval commanders, the French fleet of Paul de Grasse gained control over Chesapeake Bay, blockading Cornwallis from naval support and delivering additional land forces to blockade him on land. The Royal Navy attempted to dispute this control, but Admiral Thomas Graves was defeated in the key Battle of the Chesapeake on September 5. American and French armies that had massed outside New York City began moving south in late August, and arrived near Yorktown in mid-September. Deceptions about their movement successfully delayed attempts by Clinton to send more troops to Cornwallis. The Siege of Yorktown began on September 28, 1781. In a step that probably shortened the siege, Cornwallis decided to abandon parts of his outer defenses, and the besiegers successfully stormed two of his redoubts. When it became clear that his position was untenable, Cornwallis opened negotiations on October 17 and surrendered two days later. When the news reached London, the government of Lord North fell, and the following Rockingham ministry entered into peace negotiations. These culminated in the Treaty of Paris in 1783, in which King George III recognized the independent United States of America. Clinton and Cornwallis engaged in a public war of words defending their roles in the campaign, and British naval command also discussed the navy's shortcomings that led to the defeat. Background By December 1780, the American Revolutionary War's North American theatres had reached a critical point. The Continental Army had suffered major defeats earlier in the year, with its southern armies either captured or dispersed in the loss of Charleston and the Battle of Camden in the south, while the armies of George Washington and the British commander-in-chief for North America, Sir Henry Clinton watched each other around New York City in the north.Ketchum, p. 92 The national currency was virtually worthless, public support for the war, about to enter its sixth year, was waning, and army troops were becoming mutinous over pay and conditions.Ketchum, pp. 8,12 In the Americans' favor, Loyalist recruiting in the south had been checked with a severe blow at Kings Mountain in October.Ketchum, p. 99 =French and American planning for 1781= Virginia had largely escaped military notice before 1779, when a raid destroyed much of the state's shipbuilding capacity and seized or destroyed large amounts of tobacco, which was a significant trade item for the Americans.Ward, p. 867 Virginia's only defenses consisted of locally raised militia companies, and a naval force that had been virtually wiped out in the 1779 raid. The militia were under the overall direction of Continental Army General Baron von Steuben, a prickly Prussian taskmaster who, although he was an excellent drillmaster, alienated not only his subordinates, but also had a difficult relationship with the state's governor, Thomas Jefferson. Steuben had established a training center in Chesterfield for new Continental Army recruits, and a \\"factory\\" in Westham for the manufacture and repair of weapons and ammunition.Lockhart, p. 238 French military planners had to balance competing demands for the 1781 campaign. After a series of unsuccessful attempts at cooperation with the Americans (leading to failed assaults on Newport, Rhode Island and Savannah, Georgia), they realized more active participation in North America was needed. However, they also needed to coordinate their actions with Spain, where there was potential interest in making an assault on the British stronghold of Jamaica. It turned out that the Spanish were not interested in operations against Jamaica until after they had dealt with an expected British attempt to reinforce besieged Gibraltar, and merely wanted to be informed of the movements of the West Indies fleet.Dull, pp. 220‚Äì221 Comte de Grasse As the French fleet was preparing to depart Brest in March, several important decisions were made. The West Indies fleet, led by the Comte de Grasse, after operations in the Windward Islands, was directed to go to Cap-Fran√ßais (present-day Cap-Ha√Øtien) to determine what resources would be required to assist Spanish operations. Due to a lack of transports, France also promised six million livres to support the American war effort instead of providing additional troops. The French fleet at Newport was given a new commander, the Comte de Barras. De Barras was ordered to take the Newport fleet to harass British shipping off Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, and the French army at Newport was ordered to combine with Washington's army outside New York.Carrington, p. 614 In orders that were deliberately not fully shared with General Washington, De Grasse was instructed to assist in North American operations after his stop at Cap-Fran√ßais. The French general, the Comte de Rochambeau was instructed to tell Washington that de Grasse might be able to assist, without making any commitment.Dull, p. 241 (Washington learned from John Laurens, stationed in Paris, that de Grasse had discretion to come north.)Grainger, p. 40 The French fleet sailed from Brest on March 22. The British fleet was busy with preparations to resupply Gibraltar, and did not attempt to oppose the departure.Dull, p. 242 After the French fleet sailed, the packet ship Concorde sailed for Newport, carrying the Comte de Barras, Rochambeau's orders, and credits for the six million livres.Dull, p. 329 In a separate dispatch sent later, de Grasse also made two important requests. The first was that he be notified at Cap-Fran√ßais of the situation in North America so that he could decide how he might be able to assist in operations there, and the second was that he be supplied with 30 pilots familiar with North American waters. =British planning for 1781= General Sir Henry Clinton General Clinton never articulated a coherent vision for what the goals for British operations of the coming campaign season should be in the early months of 1781.Grainger, p. 29 Part of his problem lay in a difficult relationship with his naval counterpart in New York, the aging Vice Admiral Marriot Arbuthnot. Both men were stubborn, prone to temper, and had prickly personalities; due to repeated clashes, their working relationship had completely broken down. In the fall of 1780 Clinton had requested that either he or Arbuthnot be recalled; however, orders recalling Arbuthnot did not arrive until June. Until then, according to historian George Billias, \\"The two men could not act alone, and would not act together\\".Billias, pp. 267‚Äì275 Arbuthnot was replaced by Sir Thomas Graves, with whom Clinton had a somewhat better working relationship.Billias, p. 277 The British presence in the south consisted of the strongly fortified ports of Savannah, Georgia and Charleston, South Carolina, and a string of outposts in the interior of those two states.Ketchum, p. 95 Although the strongest outposts were relatively immune to attack from the Patriot militia that were their only formal opposition in those states, the smaller outposts, as well as supply convoys and messengers, were often the target of militia commanders like Thomas Sumter and Francis Marion.Ward, pp. 661‚Äì662 Portsmouth had most recently been occupied in October 1780 by a force under the command of Major General Alexander Leslie, but Lieutenant General Charles, Earl Cornwallis, commanding the British southern army, had ordered them to South Carolina in November.Lockhart, p. 236 To replace General Leslie at Portsmouth, General Clinton sent 1,600 troops under General Benedict Arnold (recently commissioned into the British Army as a brigadier) to Virginia in late December.Ward, p. 868 British raiding in Virginia Benedict Arnold Part of the fleet carrying General Arnold and his troops arrived in Chesapeake Bay on December 30, 1780.Ketchum, p. 126 Without waiting for the rest of the transports to arrive, Arnold sailed up the James River and disembarked 900 troops at Westover, Virginia, on January 4.Randall, p. 582Lockhart, p. 239 After an overnight forced march, he raided Richmond, the state capital, the next day, encountering only minimal militia resistance. After two more days of raiding in the area, they returned to their boats, and made sail for Portsmouth.Randall, pp. 582‚Äì583 Arnold established fortifications there, and sent his men out on raiding and foraging expeditions. The local militia were called out, but they were in such small numbers that the British presence could not be disputed. This did not prevent raiding expeditions from running into opposition, as some did in skirmishing at Waters Creek in March.Maxwell, pp. 24‚Äì27, 200 When news of Arnold's activities reached George Washington, he decided that a response was necessary. He wanted the French to send a naval expedition from their base in Newport, but the commanding admiral, Chevalier Destouches, refused any assistance until he received reports of serious storm damage to part of the British fleet on January 22.Carrington, p. 584 On February 9, Captain Arnaud de Gardeur de Tilley sailed from Newport with three ships (ship of the line Eveille and frigates Surveillante and Gentile).Linder, p. 10Campbell, p. 717 When he arrived off Portsmouth four days later, Arnold withdrew his ships, which had shallower drafts than those of the French, up the Elizabeth River, where de Tilley could not follow.Linder, p. 11 De Tilley, after determining that the local militia were \\"completely insufficient\\" to attack Arnold's position, returned to Newport.Lockhart, p. 245 On the way he captured HMS Romulus, a frigate sent by the British from New York to investigate his movements. Marquis de Lafayette Congress authorised a detachment of Continental forces to Virginia on February 20. Washington assigned command of the expedition to the Marquis de Lafayette, who left Peekskill, New York the same day.Carrington, pp. 584‚Äì585 His troops, numbering about 1,200, were three light regiments drawn from troops assigned to Continental regiments from New Jersey and New England; these regiments were led by Joseph Vose, Francis Barber, and Jean-Joseph Sourbader de Gimat.Ward, p. 780 Lafayette's force reached Head of Elk (present-day Elkton, Maryland, the northern navigable limit of Chesapeake Bay) on March 3.Carrington, p. 585 While awaiting transportation for his troops at Annapolis, Lafayette traveled south, reaching Yorktown on March 14, to assess the situation.Clary, p. 295 =American attempts at defense= De Tilley's expedition, and the strong encouragement of General Washington, who traveled to Newport to press the case, convinced Destouches to make a larger commitment. On March 8 he sailed with his entire fleet (7 ships of the line and several frigates, including the recently captured Romulus), carrying French troops to join with Lafayette's in Virginia. Admiral Arbuthnot, alerted to his departure, sailed on March 10 after sending Arnold a dispatch warning of the French movement. Arbuthnot, whose copper-clad ships could sail faster than those of Destouches, reached Cape Henry on March 16, just ahead of the French fleet. The ensuing battle was largely indecisive, but left Arbuthnot free to enter Lynnhaven Bay and control access to Chesapeake Bay; Destouches returned to Newport.Ward, p. 870 Lafayette saw the British fleet, and pursuant to orders, made preparations to return his troops to the New York area. By early April he had returned to Head of Elk, where he received orders from Washington to stay in Virginia.Clary, p. 296Carrington, p. 586 Admiral Marriot Arbuthnot The departure of Destouches' fleet from Newport had prompted General Clinton to send Arnold reinforcements.Fortescue, p. 353 In the wake of Arbuthnot's sailing he sent transports carrying about 2,000 men under the command of General William Phillips to the Chesapeake. These joined Arnold at Portsmouth on March 27.Lockhart, p. 247 Phillips, as senior commander, took over the force and resumed raiding, targeting Petersburg and Richmond. By this time, Baron von Steuben and Peter Muhlenberg, the militia commanders in Virginia, felt they had to make a stand to maintain morale despite the inferior strength of their troops. They established a defensive line in Blandford, near Petersburg (Blandford is now a part of the city of Petersburg), and fought a disciplined but losing action on April 25. Von Steuben and Muhlenberg retreated before the advance of Phillips, who hoped to again raid Richmond. However, Lafayette made a series of forced marches, and reached Richmond on April 29, just hours before Phillips.Russell, pp. 254‚Äì255 Cornwallis and Lafayette General Charles, Earl Cornwallis To counter the British threat in the Carolinas, Washington had sent Major General Nathanael Greene, one of his best strategists, to rebuild the American army in North Carolina after the defeat at Camden.Ketchum, p. 73 General Cornwallis, leading the British troops in the south, wanted to deal with him and gain control over the state.Ketchum, pp. 119‚Äì125 Greene divided his inferior force, sending part of his army under Daniel Morgan to threaten the British post at Ninety Six, South Carolina. Cornwallis sent Banastre Tarleton after Morgan, who almost wiped out Tarleton's command in the January Battle of Cowpens, and almost captured Tarleton in the process.Wickwire, pp. 254‚Äì268 This action was followed by what has been called the \\"race to the Dan,\\" in which Cornwallis gave chase to Morgan and Greene in an attempt to catch them before they reunited their forces. When Greene successfully crossed the Dan River and entered Virginia, Cornwallis, who had stripped his army of most of its baggage, gave up the pursuit.Wickwire, pp. 274‚Äì284 However, Greene received reinforcements and supplies, recrossed the Dan, and returned to Greensboro, North Carolina to do battle with Cornwallis.Wickwire, pp. 285‚Äì291 The earl won the battle, but Greene was able to withdraw with his army intact, and the British suffered enough casualties that Cornwallis was forced to retreat to Wilmington for reinforcement and resupply.Ketchum, p. 129Wickwire, pp. 311‚Äì315 Greene then went on to regain control over most of South Carolina and Georgia.Russell, pp. 232‚Äì250 Cornwallis, in violation of orders but also in the absence of significant strategic direction by General Clinton, decided to take his army, now numbering just 1,400 men, into Virginia on April 25; it was the same day that Phillips and von Steuben fought at Blandford.Wickwire, pp. 321‚Äì325 Phillips, after Lafayette beat him to Richmond, turned back east, continuing to destroy military and economic targets in the area.Russell, p. 255 On May 7, Phillips received a dispatch from Cornwallis, ordering him to Petersburg to effect a junction of their forces; three days later, Phillips arrived in Petersburg.Johnston, p. 34 Lafayette briefly cannonaded the British position there, but did not feel strong enough to actually make an attack.Campbell, p. 721 On May 13, Phillips died of a fever, and Arnold retook control of the force.Campbell, p. 722 This caused some grumbling amongst the men, since Arnold was not particularly well respected. While waiting for Cornwallis, the forces of Arnold and Lafayette watched each other. Arnold attempted to open communications with the marquis (who had orders from Washington to summarily hang Arnold), but the marquis returned his letters unopened.Clary, p. 302 Cornwallis arrived in Petersburg on May 19, prompting Lafayette, who commanded under 1,000 Continentals and about 2,000 militia, to retreat to Richmond.Clary, p. 305Campbell, p. 726 Further British reinforcements led by the Ansbacher Colonel von Voigt arrived from New York shortly after, raising the size of Cornwallis's army to more than 7,000.Wickwire, p. 326Report on American Manuscripts, p. 273 Lieutenant Colonel Banastre Tarleton Cornwallis, after dispatching General Arnold back to New York, then set out to follow General Clinton's most recent orders to Phillips.Russell, p. 256Carrington, p. 595 These instructions were to establish a fortified base and raid rebel military and economic targets in Virginia. Cornwallis decided that he had to first deal with the threat posed by Lafayette, so he set out in pursuit of the marquis. Lafayette, clearly outnumbered, retreated rapidly toward Fredericksburg to protect an important supply depot there,Clary, p. 306 while von Steuben retreated to Point of Fork (present-day Columbia, Virginia), where militia and Continental Army trainees had gathered with supplies pulled back before the raiding British. Cornwallis reached the Hanover County courthouse on June 1, and, rather than send his whole army after Lafayette, detached Banastre Tarleton and John Graves Simcoe on separate raiding expeditions.Morrissey, p. 39 Tarleton, his British Legion reduced by the debacle at Cowpens, rode rapidly with a small force to Charlottesville, where he captured several members of the Virginia legislature. He almost captured Governor Jefferson as well, but had to content himself with several bottles of wine from Jefferson's estate at Monticello. Simcoe went to Point of Fork to deal with von Steuben and the supply depot. In a brief skirmish on June 5, von Steuben's forces, numbering about 1,000, suffered 30 casualties, but they had withdrawn most of the supplies across the river. Simcoe, who only had about 300 men, then exaggerated the size of his force by lighting a large number of campfires; this prompted von Steuben to withdraw from Point of Fork, leaving the supplies to be destroyed by Simcoe the next day.Clary, p. 307 Lafayette, in the meantime, was expecting the imminent arrival of long-delayed reinforcements. Several battalions of Pennsylvania Continentals under Brigadier General Anthony Wayne had also been authorised by Congress for service in Virginia in February. However, Wayne had to deal with the aftereffects of a mutiny in January that nearly wiped out the Pennsylvania Line as a fighting force, and it was May before he had rebuilt the line and begun the march to Virginia. Even then, there was a great deal of mistrust between Wayne and his men; Wayne had to keep his ammunition and bayonets under lock and key except when they were needed.Nelson, p. 133 Although Wayne was ready to march on May 19, the force's departure was delayed by a day because of a renewed threat of mutiny after the units were paid with devalued Continental dollars.Spears, 178 Lafayette and Wayne's 800 men joined forces at Raccoon Ford on the Rappahannock River on June 10.Clary, p. 308Wickwire, p. 334 A few days later, Lafayette was further reinforced by 1,000 militia under the command of William Campbell.Ward, p. 874 Lieutenant Colonel John Graves Simcoe After the successful raids of Simcoe and Tarleton, Cornwallis began to make his way east toward Richmond and Williamsburg, almost contemptuously ignoring Lafayette in his movements. Lafayette, his force grown to about 4,500, was buoyed in confidence, and began to edge closer to the earl's army. By the time Cornwallis reached Williamsburg on June 25, Lafayette was away, at Bird's Tavern. That day, Lafayette learned that Simcoe's Queen's Rangers were at some remove from the main British force, so Lafayette sent some cavalry and light infantry to intercept them. This precipitated a skirmish at Spencer's Ordinary where each side believed the other to be within range of its main army.Hallahan, p. 135 Allied decisions While Lafayette, Arnold, and Phillips manoeuvred in Virginia, the allied leaders, Washington and Rochambeau, considered their options. On May 6 the Concorde arrived in Boston, and two days later Washington and Rochambeau were informed of the arrival of de Barras as well as the vital dispatches and funding.Ketchum pp. 138‚Äì139 On May 23 and 24, Washington and Rochambeau held a conference at Wethersfield, Connecticut where they discussed what steps to take next.Grainger, p. 38 They agreed that, pursuant to his orders, Rochambeau would move his army from Newport to the Continental Army camp at White Plains, New York. They also decided to send dispatches to de Grasse outlining two possible courses of action. Washington favored the idea of attacking New York, while Rochambeau favored action in Virginia, where the British were less well established. Washington's letter to de Grasse outlined these two options; Rochambeau, in a private note, informed de Grasse of his preference.Ketchum, p. 139 Lastly, Rochambeau convinced de Barras to hold his fleet in readiness to assist in either operation, rather than taking it out on expeditions to the north as he had been ordered.Grainger, p. 41 The Concorde sailed from Newport on June 20, carrying dispatches from Washington, Rochambeau, and de Barras, as well as the pilots de Grasse had requested.Dull, p. 242 The French army left Newport in June, and joined Washington's army at Dobb's Ferry, New York on July 7.Ketchum, p. 146 From there, Washington and Rochambeau embarked on an inspection tour of the British defenses around New York while they awaited word from de Grasse.Ketchum, p. 148 The Comte de Rochambeau De Grasse had a somewhat successful campaign in the West Indies. His forces successfully captured Tobago in June after a minor engagement with the British fleet.Larrabee, p. 150 Beyond that, he and British Admiral George Brydges Rodney avoided significant engagement.de Grasse, pp. 50‚Äì56 De Grasse arrived at Cap-Fran√ßais on July 16, where the Concorde awaited him.Linder, p. 14 He immediately engaged in negotiations with the Spanish. He informed them of his intent to sail north, but promised to return by November to assist in Spanish operations in exchange for critical Spanish cover while he sailed north. From them he secured the promise to protect French commerce and territories so that he could bring north his entire fleet, 28 ships of the line.Larrabee, p. 156 In addition to his fleet, he took on 3,500 troops under the command of the Marquis de St. Simon, and appealed to the Spanish in Havana for funds needed to pay Rochambeau's troops.Dull, pp. 243‚Äì244Grainger, p. 46 On July 28, he sent the Concorde back to Newport, informing Washington, Rochambeau, and de Barras that he expected to arrive in the Chesapeake at the end of August, and would need to leave by mid-October. He sailed from Cap-Fran√ßais on August 5, beginning a deliberately slow route north through a little-used channel in the Bahamas.Ketchum, p. 177Dull, p. 245 British decisions The movement of the French army to the New York area caused General Clinton a great deal of concern; letters written by Washington that Clinton had intercepted suggested that the allies were planning an attack on New York. Beginning in June he wrote a series of letters to Cornwallis containing a confusing and controversial set of ruminations, suggestions, and recommendations, that only sometimes contained concrete and direct orders.Wickwire, p. 337Grainger, p. 44 Some of these letters were significantly delayed in reaching Cornwallis, complicating the exchange between the two. On June 11 and 15, apparently in reaction to the threat to New York, Clinton requested Cornwallis to fortify either Yorktown or Williamsburg, and send any troops he could spare back to New York.Grainger, p. 43 Cornwallis received these letters at Williamsburg on June 26. He and an engineer inspected Yorktown, which he found to be defensively inadequate. He wrote a letter to Clinton indicating that he would move to Portsmouth in order to send troops north with transports available there.Wickwire, pp. 339‚Äì340 Brigadier General Anthony Wayne On July 4 Cornwallis began moving his army toward the Jamestown ferry, to cross the broad James River and march to Portsmouth. Lafayette's scouts observed the motion, and he realised the British force would be vulnerable during the crossing. He advanced his army to the Green Spring Plantation, and, based on intelligence that only the British rear guard was left at the crossing, sent General Wayne forward to attack them on July 6. In reality, the earl had laid a clever trap. Crossing only his baggage and some troops to guard them, he sent \\"deserters\\" to falsely inform Lafayette of the situation. In the Battle of Green Spring, General Wayne managed to escape the trap, but with significant casualties and the loss of two field pieces. Cornwallis then crossed the river, and marched his army to Suffolk.Clary, pp. 309‚Äì312 Cornwallis again detached Tarleton on a raid into central Virginia. Tarleton's raid was based on intelligence that supplies might be intercepted that were en route to General Greene. The raid, in which Tarleton's force rode in four days, was a failure, since supplies had already been moved.Clary, p. 321 (During this raid, some of Tarleton's men were supposedly in a minor skirmish with Peter Francisco, one of the American heroes of Guilford Court House.)Francisco, p. 217 Cornwallis received another letter from General Clinton while at Suffolk, dated June 20, stating that the forces to be embarked were to be used for an attack against Philadelphia.Wickwire, p. 347 Detail from a 1781 French map prepared for Lafayette depicting the Williamsburg/Jamestown area and the movements of Lafayette and Cornwallis. The clash at Spencer's is marked by \\"le 26 Juin\\", and that at Green Spring is labelled \\"le 6 Juillet\\". When Cornwallis reached Portsmouth, he began embarking troops pursuant to Clinton's orders. On July 20, with some transports almost ready to sail, new orders arrived that countermanded the previous ones. In the most direct terms, Clinton ordered him to establish a fortified deep-water port, using as much of his army as he thought necessary. Clinton took this decision because the navy had long been dissatisfied with New York as a naval base, firstly because sand bars obstructed the entrance to the Hudson River, damaging the hulls of the larger ships; and secondly because the river often froze in winter, imprisoning vessels inside the harbour. Arbuthnot had recently been replaced and to show his satisfaction at this development, Clinton now acceded to the Navy's request, despite Cornwallis's warning that the Chesapeake's open bays and navigable rivers meant that any base there \\"will always be exposed to sudden French attack.\\" It was to prove a fatal error of judgement by Clinton, since the need to defend the new facility denied Cornwallis any freedom of movement . Nevertheless, having inspected Portsmouth and found it less favourable than Yorktown, Cornwallis wrote to Clinton informing him that he would fortify Yorktown.Middleton, War of American Independence, pp. 279-81. Wickwire, pp. 349‚Äì351 Lafayette was alerted on July 26 that Cornwallis was embarking his troops, but lacked intelligence about their eventual destination, and began manoeuvring his troops to cover some possible landing points.Clary, p. 319 On August 6 he learned that Cornwallis had landed at Yorktown and was fortifying it and Gloucester Point just across the York River. Convergence on Yorktown Admiral Rodney had been warned that de Grasse was planning to take at least part of his fleet north.Morrill, p. 179 Although he had some clues that he might take his whole fleet (he was aware of the number of pilots de Grasse had requested, for example), he assumed that de Grasse would not leave the French convoy at Cap- Fran√ßais, and that part of his fleet would escort it to France as Admiral Guichen had done the previous year.Larrabee, p. 174 Rodney made his dispositions accordingly, balancing the likely requirements of the fleet in North America with the need to protect Britain's own trade convoys. Sixteen of his twenty-one battleships, therefore, were to sail with Hood in pursuit of de Grasse to the Chesapeake before proceeding to New York. Rodney, who was ill, meanwhile took three other battleships back to England, two as merchant escorts, leaving his remaining two in dock for repairs. Hood was well satisfied with these arrangements, telling a colleague that his fleet was \\"equal fully to defeat any designs of the enemy, let de Grasse bring or send what number of ships he might in aid of Barras.\\" What neither Rodney or Hood knew was de Grasse's last minute decision to take his entire fleet to North America, thus ensuring a French superiority of three to two in battleship strength. Blissfully unaware of this development, Hood eventually sailed from Antigua on August 10, five days after de Grasse.He had at this point, however, only fourteen of his allotted sixteen battleships, the Torbay and Prince William having been diverted by Rodney to protect a Jamaica trade convoy. They only joined Hood five week after the battle off the Virginia Capes, Middleton, \\"Naval Resources,\\" pp, 31-37. Grainger, p. 45 During the voyage, one of his smaller ships carrying intelligence about the American pilots was captured by a privateer, thus further depriving the British in New York of valuable information.Middleton, \\"Naval Resources,\\" p. 38. Larrabee, p. 177 Hood himself, following the direct route, reached the Chesapeake on August 25, and found the entrance to the bay empty. He then sailed on to New York to meet with Admiral Sir Thomas Graves, in command of the New York station following Arbuthnot's departure. George Washington On August 14 General Washington learned of de Grasse's decision to sail for the Chesapeake. The next day he reluctantly abandoned the idea of assaulting New York, writing that \\"[m]atters having now come to a crisis and a decisive plan to be determined on, I was obliged ... to give up all idea of attacking New York...\\"Ketchum, p. 151 The combined Franco-American army began moving south on August 19, engaging in several tactics designed to fool Clinton about their intentions. Some forces were sent on a route along the New Jersey shore, and ordered to make camp preparations as if preparing for an attack on Staten Island.Morrill, p. 178 The army also carried landing craft to lend verisimilitude to the idea. Washington sent orders to Lafayette to prevent Cornwallis from returning to North Carolina; he did not learn that Cornwallis was entrenching at Yorktown until August 30.Ketchum, pp. 151, 159 Two days later the army was passing through Philadelphia; another mutiny was averted there when funds were procured for troops that threatened to stay until they were paid.Ketchum, p. 163 The Battle of the Chesapeake Admiral de Barras sailed with his fleet from Newport, carrying the French siege equipment, on August 25.Linder, p. 15 He sailed a route that deliberately took him away from the coast to avoid encounters with the British.Larrabee, p. 221 De Grasse reached the Chesapeake on August 30, five days after Hood. He immediately debarked the troops from his fleet to assist Lafayette in blockading Cornwallis, and stationed some his ships to blockade the York and James Rivers.Clary, p. 326 News of de Barras' sailing reached New York on August 28, where Graves, Clinton, and Hood were meetingLarrabee, p. 182 to discuss the possibility of making an attack on the French fleet in Newport, since the French army was no longer there to defend it.Billias, p. 279 Clinton had still not realized that Washington was marching south, something he did not have confirmed until September 2.Larrabee, p. 254 When they learned of de Barras' departure they immediately concluded that de Grasse must be headed for the Chesapeake (but still did not know of his strength). Graves sailed from New York on August 31 with 19 ships of the line;Wickwire, p. 358 Clinton wrote Cornwallis to warn him that Washington was coming, and that he would send 4,000 reinforcements.Ketchum, p. 204 Painting by Auguste Couder depicting Washington and Rochambeau giving instructions before the Siege of Yorktown On September 5, the British fleet arrived at the mouth of the Chesapeake to see the French fleet anchored there. De Grasse, who had men ashore, was forced to cut his cables and scramble to get his fleet out to meet the British. In the Battle of the Chesapeake, de Grasse won a narrow tactical victory.Linder, pp. 15‚Äì17 After the battle, the two fleets drifted to the southeast for several days, with the British avoiding battle and both fleets making repairs. This was apparently in part a ploy by de Grasse to ensure the British would not interfere with de Barras' arrival.Hallahan, pp. 159‚Äì160 A fleet was spotted off in the distance on September 9 making for the bay; de Grasse followed the next day.de Grasse, p. 158 Graves, forced to scuttle one of his ships, returned to New York for repairs.Hallahan, p. 160 Smaller ships from the French fleet then assisted in transporting the Franco- American army down the Chesapeake to Yorktown, completing the encirclement of Cornwallis.Johnston, p. 101 Yorktown The Continental Army at the time of the Yorktown campaign. On September 6, General Clinton wrote a letter to Cornwallis, telling him to expect reinforcements. Received by Cornwallis on September 14, this letter may have been instrumental in the decision by Cornwallis to remain at Yorktown and not try to fight his way out,Wickwire, p. 362 despite the urging of Banastre Tarleton to break out against the comparatively weak Lafayette.Ketchum, p. 205 General Washington, after spending a few days at Mount Vernon for the first time in years, arrived in the camps outside Yorktown on September 17.Ketchum, pp. 181‚Äì185 That same day, the British military leadership in New York held a council, in which they agreed that Cornwallis could not be reinforced until they had regained control of the Chesapeake. Historian Richard Ketchum describes the decision of the council as leaving Cornwallis \\"dangling in the wind.\\"Ketchum, p. 209 One day earlier, Cornwallis wrote a desperate plea for help: \\"I am of the opinion that you can do me no effectual service but by coming directly to this place.\\"Ketchum, p. 208 Before dispatching the letter on the 17th, Cornwallis added, \\"If you cannot relieve me very soon, you must prepare to hear the worst.\\" Map of the eastern seaboard showing naval movements prior to the siege Washington, Rochambeau, and de Grasse then held council aboard de Grasse's flagship Ville de Paris to finalize preparations for the siege; de Grasse agreed to provide about 2,000 marines and some cannons to the effort.Ketchum, p. 210 During the meeting, de Grasse was convinced to delay his departure (originally planned for mid-October) until the end of October.Hallahan, p. 164 Upon the return of the generals to Williamsburg, they heard rumors that British naval reinforcements had arrived at New York, and the French fleet might again be threatened. De Grasse wanted to pull his fleet out of the bay as a precaution, and it took the pleas of Washington and Rochambeau, delivered to de Grasse by Lafayette, to convince him to remain.Hallahan, p. 165 The siege formally got underway on September 28.Ketchum, p. 214 Despite a late attempt by Cornwallis to escape via Gloucester Point, the siege lines closed in on his positions and the allied cannons wrought havoc in the British camps, and on October 17 he opened negotiations to surrender.Ketchum, p. 239 On that very day, the British fleet again sailed from New York, carrying 6,000 troops. Still outnumbered by the combined French fleets, they eventually turned back.Ketchum, p. 241 A French naval officer, noting the British fleet's departure on October 29, wrote, \\"They were too late. The fowl had been eaten.\\"Larrabee, p. 235 Aftermath =Disposition of the British army= The negotiations for surrender were complicated by two issues. When American forces surrendered at Charleston in 1780, they were not granted customary terms of capitulation that included flying colors and the playing of an enemy tune. Washington insisted that these terms be applied to the surrender of the British army at Yorktown, his negotiators pointing out that the defenders had in both instances acted with valor.Larrabee, p. 269 The second issue concerned the disposition of Loyalists in the British camp. This issue was finessed with the addition of a clause to the terms that allowed one British vessel, the sloop Bonetta, to be sent without any sort of inspection to carry dispatches from Cornwallis to New York;Greene, p. 288 Americans, suspecting that either runaway slaves or Loyalists might be aboard, were prevented from searching the vessel.Greene, p. 306 When the British garrison marched out of their positions on October 19 to surrender, it was with colors cased, possibly playing the British tune \\"The World Turned Upside Down\\".Definitive reference that this tune was played only first appeared in secondary accounts of the surrender in the 1820s. Greene, p. 296 Cornwallis, claiming illness, did not attend the ceremony, sending his deputy General O'Hara to deliver his sword. O'Hara at first sought to deliver it to a French officer, but he was finally directed to one of Washington's officers, Benjamin Lincoln, the defeated commander at Charleston. Lincoln briefly held the proferred sword and then returned it to O'Hara.Greene, p. 296 French engraving depicting the surrender Over the following weeks, the army was marched under guard to camps in Virginia and Maryland.Johnston, p. 157 Cornwallis and other officers were returned to New York and allowed to return to England on parole. The ship on which Cornwallis sailed in December 1781 also carried Benedict Arnold and his family.Randall, p. 585 =Disposition of the allies= The local militia that supported the siege were dismissed from service. Some of the American Continental forces were returned to the New York City region, where Washington continued to stand against the British presence until the end of the war; others were sent south to assist in General Greene's efforts in the Carolinas.Ketchum, p. 259 Issues of pay and condition were an ongoing problem until the war ended,Ketchum, p. 276 but Washington fought no more battles.Larrabee, p. 267 The French forces that came with de Grasse were reembarked, and he sailed for the West Indies, with the fleet of de Barras, in early November.Ketchum, p. 271 After recapturing a number of British-held targets there, de Grasse was preparing to join with the Spanish for an assault on Jamaica when Admiral Rodney defeated him in the April 1782 Battle of the Saintes, capturing him and his flagship. The forces of General Rochambeau wintered in Virginia, and marched back to Rhode Island the next summer.Ketchum, p. 275 =Reactions= General Washington's aide, Lieutenant Tench Tilghman, was dispatched to deliver the news to Congress. Arriving in Philadelphia on October 22, he was two days behind the first notice of the surrender, which had been expressed from Baltimore ahead of him.Hallahan, pp. 215‚Äì216 The news electrified Congress and the populace. Church bells pealed, and the Liberty Bell was reportedly rung,Hallahan, p. 217 actions that were repeated as the news traveled through the colonies.Hallahan, pp. 245‚Äì246 Some Congressmen introduced a resolution calling on General Washington to arrest and hang General Cornwallis; after \\"[t]he debate continue'd several Day's\\", the resolution was voted down.Hallahan, p. 218 The news put British-occupied New York City into mourning. At first met with some skepticism, the news was finally confirmed on October 27, although the city still awaited news of Clinton's abortive relief effort.Hallahan, p. 233 Clinton was recalled to London, and left the city in March 1782.Hallahan, p. 245 He was replaced by General Guy Carleton, who was under orders to suspend offensive operations.Greene, p. 325 British Prime Minister Lord North When the news reached London on November 25, Lord Germain described the reaction of Lord North to the news: \\"he would have taken a ball on his breast. For he opened his arms exclaiming wildly as he paced up and down the apartment, during the few minutes, 'Oh God! It is all over!'\\"Hallahan, p. 249 King George was reported to receive the news with calmness and dignity,Hallahan, p. 250 although he later became depressed as the news sank in, and even considered abdication. The king's supporters in Parliament were depressed, and the opposition elated. A resolution calling for an end to the war was introduced on December 12, and failed to pass by a single vote.Hallahan, p. 251 Lord Germain was dismissed in early 1782, and the North administration fell shortly afterward.Larrabee, pp. 279‚Äì280 Peace negotiations followed, and the war was formally ended with the signing of the Treaty of Paris on September 3, 1783. General Cornwallis, despite being the commander who surrendered, was not blamed for the defeat. He was well-received on his return to London, and one writer echoed a common sentiment that \\"Lord Cornwallis's army was sold.\\"Larrabee, p. 278 General Clinton spent the rest of his life defending his own reputation; he was \\"laughed at by the rebels, despised by the British, and cursed by the loyalists.\\" In 1783, he published a Narrative of the Campaign of 1781 in North America in which he attempted to lay the blame for the 1781 campaign failures on General Cornwallis. This was met with a public response by Cornwallis, who leveled his own criticisms at Clinton. The highly public debate included the publication of much of their correspondence.Greene, p. 322 Admiral Graves also did not suffer due to his defeat by de Grasse; he was eventually promoted to full admiral and given a peerage.Larrabee, p. 274 However, many aspects of the Battle of the Chesapeake have been the subject of both contemporary and historical debate, beginning right after the battle. On 6 September, Admiral Graves issued a memorandum justifying a confusing use of signals, indicating that \\"[when] the signal for the line of battle ahead is out at the same time with the signal for battle, it is not to be understood that the latter signal shall be rendered ineffectual by a too strict adherence to the former.\\"Larrabee, p. 275 Hood, in commentary written on the reverse of his copy, observed that this eliminated any possibility of engaging an enemy who was disordered, since it would require the British line to also be disordered. Instead, he maintained, \\"the British fleet should be as compact as possible, in order to take the critical moment of an advantage opening ...\\" Others criticise Hood because he \\"did not wholeheartedly aid his chief\\", and that a lesser officer \\"would have been court-martialled for not doing his utmost to engage the enemy.\\"Larrabee, p. 276 The Comte de Rochambeau dispatched two messengers to deliver the news to Paris in a move that had unusual consequences in French military politics. The Duc de Lauzun and the Comte de Deux-Pontes, both of whom had distinguished themselves in the siege, were sent on separate ships to bring the news.Hallahan, p. 210 Deux-Pontes was accompanied by a favorite of the French naval minister the Marquis de Castries, the Comte de Charlus, who Lauzun had urged Rochambeau to send in his stead for political reasons.Hallahan, pp. 210, 252 King Louis XVI and his ministers received the news warmly, but Castries and the snubbed Charlus ensured that Lauzun and Rochambeau were denied or delayed in the receipt of rewards for the success.Hallahan, p. 253 Deux-Ponts was rewarded with the Order of Saint Louis and command of a regiment.Hallahan, p. 252 Analysis French Marine Minister the Marquis de Castries made important strategic decisions before the campaign began. Historian John Pancake describes the later stages of the campaign as \\"British blundering\\" and that the \\"allied operations proceeded with clockwork precision.\\"Pancake, p. 226 Naval historian Jonathan Dull has described de Grasse's 1781 naval campaign, which encompassed, in addition to Yorktown, successful contributions to the French capture of Tobago and the Spanish siege of Pensacola, as the \\"most perfectly executed naval campaign of the age of sail\\", and compared the string of French successes favorably with the British Annus Mirabilis of 1759.Dull, p. 247 He also observes that a significant number of individual decisions, at times against orders or previous agreements, contributed to the success of the campaign:Dull, pp. 247-248 #French ministers Montmorin and Vergennes convinced the French establishment that decisive action was needed in North America in order to end the war. #The French naval minister Castries wrote orders for de Grasse that gave the latter sufficient flexibility to assist in the campaign. #Spanish Louisiana Governor Bernardo de G√°lvez released ships and troops to cover French territories while de Grasse sailed north with most of the French military establishment in the West Indies. #Spanish Cuban colonial official Francisco Saavedra cooperated in the decision-making that enabled de Grasse's northward expedition. #General Rochambeau and Chevalier Luzerne both urged de Grasse to decide on the Chesapeake. #Admiral de Barras violated his orders to operate off Newfoundland, making possible the timely delivery of the French siege train to Yorktown. #George Washington decided against an attack on New York and instead embarked on a risky march to Virginia. #Admiral De Grasse agreed to overstay his planned time in the Chesapeake, understanding the importance of the undertaking there. Of de Grasse's negotiations with the Spanish that secured the use of his fleet and his order to the economic fleet to remain in the West Indies, Royal Navy Captain Thomas White, in his 1830 analysis of the 1781 campaign, wrote that \\"[i]f the British government had sanctioned, or a British admiral had adopted such a measure, [...] the one would have been turned out, and the other would have been hung: no wonder they succeeded and we failed.\\" Legacy The principal points of commemoration of the events of this campaign are managed by the National Park Service in the Colonial National Historical Park. In addition to the battlefield at Yorktown, the park includes the Cape Henry Memorial, where the French naval victory by de Grasse is remembered.

Though the Polish forces were victorious over the Russians, the outcome was not decisive, and was inconclusive in the scope of the larger Russo-Polish War.  Historical context  On November 29, 1830, a group of young, non-commissioned officers in the Imperial Russian Army's military academy in Warsaw revolted against the rule of the Russian Empire in Poland and Lithuania. The following day, armed Polish civilians forced the Russian troops to withdraw north from Warsaw. The Russo-Polish War officially began in early February 1831, a 115,000-strong Russian army crossed Polish borders, led by Field Marshal Hans Karl von Diebitsch. The first major battle took place on February 14, 1831 near the village of Stoczek near ≈Åuk√≥w, where Polish cavalry under the command of Brigadier J√≥zef Dwernicki defeated the Russian division of Teodor Geismar. The victory had psychological rather than militaristic significance, as it did little to slow the Russian advance towards Warsaw. Subsequent inconclusive victories at Dobre on February 17 and Wawer on February 19 and 20 bolstered Polish spirits, but were inconclusive. Bia≈Ço≈Çƒôka was a small town located North of Warsaw. The road to the capital passed through Bia≈Ço≈Çƒôka, continued south through the villages of Br√≥dno and Praga, and then crossed the Vistula into Warsaw.  Combatants  The Russian forces, under the command of Ivan Shakhovskiy, included 11,000 men and 56 cannons. Their orders were to march through Bia≈Ço≈Çƒôka and to continue to Brodno. Polish forces under the command of Jan Krukowiecki, Antoni Gie≈Çgud and Kazimierz Ma≈Çachowski were in fortified positions to protect the entrance to the capital city. Their combined forces included 13,000 men and 22 cannons. These forces included 2,700 cavalry and 1,200 infantry under the command of Antoni Jankowski.  Battle  The Battle of Bia≈Ço≈Çƒôka lasted two days. After the first day, the Polish had lost 450 men, while the Russians had suffered 650 losses. During the second day, Polish forces suffered 320 losses, while the Russians suffered 430. In total, 670 Polish soldiers were killed or wounded, compared to 1,070 Russians. Fighting commenced on February 24 at approximately 09:00 AM. Russian troops attacked the combined forces of General Kazimierz Ma≈Çachowski (4,200 infantry, 6 cannons) and Antoni Jankowski (2,700 cavalry, 1,200 infantry), who had taken positions within the town and surrounding woods. Russian forces attacked the Hussars who were entrenched in the forest, and suffered heavy losses. After many hours of fierce fighting, the Polish forces were pushed back from their position and into the countryside. The Polish high command sent Antoni Gie≈Çgud to reinforce Ma≈Çachowski and Jankowski, and ordered Jan Krukowiecki to take charge of the Polish forces at Bia≈Ço≈Çƒôka. The reinforcements arrived at the battlefield just before sunset, and skirmishing continued through the night. Suspecting that Krukowiecki's forces were vastly outnumbered, Polish military authorities ordered their forces to hold their positions, and to only retaliate in the event that the Russians attempted to press on towards Warsaw. Ironically, Shakhovskiy received similar orders from Field Marshal von Diebitsch: if attacked by Polish forces, he was to withdraw immediately. Shakhovskiy withdrew to the town of Marki directly to the east, and was pursued by Krukowiecki, whose flanking maneuver threw the Russian forces into disorder. The Polish forces were able to take back Bia≈Ço≈Çƒôka, but the disorganization of the Russian forces made it impossible to strike a decisive blow.  Aftermath  By February 24, the Russian Army had reached the outskirts of Warsaw in two columns: one from the North under the command of General Shakhovskiy, and one from the East under the command of General Grigoriy Vladimirovich Rosen. Field Marshal von Diebitsch initially planned a full frontal assault on Warsaw to take place on February 26. The successful Polish counter-attack at Bia≈Ço≈Çƒôka, however, prompted von Diebitsch to change his plans and attack earlier. On February 25, General Rosen received orders to attack, resulting in the Battle of Olszynka Grochowska. His forces were joined later that day by the remnants of Shakhovskiy's defeated column.

A mixture of these chemicals is known as embalming fluid and is used to preserve bodies of deceased persons for both funeral purposes and in medical research in anatomical laboratories. The period for which a body is embalmed is dependent on time, expertise of the embalmer and factors regarding duration of stay and purpose. Typically, embalming fluid contains a mixture of formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, methanol, and other solvents. The formaldehyde content generally ranges from 5 to 37 percent and the methanol content may range from 9 to 56 percent. In the United States alone, about 20 million liters (roughly 5.3 million gallons) of embalming fluid are used every year.Sehee, Joe (2007). Green Burial: It's Only Natural, PERC Reports, Winter 2007. Retrieved on 2013-11-06.  How they work  Embalming fluid acts to fix (denature) cellular proteins, meaning that they cannot act as a nutrient source for bacteria; embalming fluid also kills the bacteria themselves. Formaldehyde or glutaraldehyde fixes tissue or cells by irreversibly connecting a primary amine group in a protein molecule with a nearby nitrogen in a protein or DNA molecule through a -CH2\\\\- linkage called a Schiff base. The end result also creates the simulation, via color changes, of the appearance of blood flowing under the skin. Modern embalming is not done with a single fixative. Instead, various chemicals are used to create a mixture, called an arterial solution, which is uniquely generated for the needs of each case. For example, a body needing to be repatriated overseas needs a higher index (percentage of diluted preservative chemical) than one simply for viewing (known in the United States and Canada as a funeral visitation) at a funeral home before cremation or burial. Process Tank containing embalming fluid Embalming fluid is injected into the arterial system of the deceased. Many other bodily fluids may also be displaced and removed from the body using the arterial system and in the case of cavity treatment aspirated from the body and replaced with a specialty fluid known as cavity fluid. Chemicals and additives It is important to distinguish between an arterial chemical (or fluid), which is generally taken to be the product in its original composition, and an arterial solution, which is a diluted mixture of chemicals and made to order for each body. Non-preservative chemicals in an arterial solution are generally called \\"accessory chemicals\\" or co/pre-injectants, depending on their time of utilization. Potential ingredients in an arterial solution include: *Preservative (Arterial) Chemical. These are commonly a percentage (normally 18‚Äì37%) based mixture of formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde or in some cases phenol which are then diluted to gain the final index of the arterial solution. Methanol is used to hold the formaldehyde in solution. Formalin refers specifically to 37% aqueous formaldehyde and is not commonly used in funeral embalming but rather in the preservation of anatomical specimens. *Water Conditioner. These are designed to balance the \\"hardness\\" of water (the presence of other trace chemicals that change the water's pH or neutrality) and to help reduce the deceased's acidity, a by-product of decomposition, as formaldehyde works best in an alkaline environment. Additionally, water conditioners may be used to help inactivate chemotherapy drugs and antibiotics, which may bind to and render ineffectual the preservative chemical. *Cell Conditioner. These chemicals act to prepare cells for absorption of arterial fluid and help break up clots in the bloodstream. *Dyes. Active dyes are used to restore the body's natural colouration and counterstain against conditions such as jaundice as well as to indicate distribution of arterial fluid. Inactive dyes are used by the manufacturer of the arterial fluid to give a pleasant color to the fluid in the bottle but do nothing for the appearance of the embalmed body. *Humectants. These are added to dehydrated and emaciated bodies to help restore tissue to a more natural and hydrated appearance. *Anti-Edemic Chemicals. The opposite of humectants, these are designed to draw excessive fluid (edema) from a body. *Additional Disinfectants. For certain cases, such as tissue gas, speciality chemicals such as Omega Decomp Factor, Triton-28, STOP or Dispray (Topical) can be arterially injected to kill tissue gas. *Water. Most arterial solutions are a mix of some of the preceding chemicals with tepid water. Cases done without the addition of water are referred to as \\"waterless.\\" Waterless embalming is more common in difficult cases or those requiring a very high degree of preservation, such as instances of an extended delay between death and final disposition. *Cavity Fluid. This is a generally a very high-index formaldehyde or glutaraldehyde solution injected undiluted directly via the trocar incision into the body cavities to treat the viscera. In cases of tissue gas, phenol based products are often used instead. History Prior to the advent of the modern range of embalming chemicals a variety of alternative additives have been used by embalmers, including epsom salts for edema cases and milk in cases of jaundice, but these are of limited effectiveness and can be chalked up as \\"embalmer tricks\\", as the validity of their use has never been demonstrated by professional embalmers or mortuary science programs. During the American Civil War, the Union Army, wanting to transport slain soldiers from the battlefields back home for burial, consulted with Dr. Thomas Holmes, who developed a technique that involved draining a corpse's blood and embalming it with a fluid made with arsenic for preservation. Embalming chemicals are generally produced by specialist manufacturers, The oldest embalming fluid company is the Champion Company, which was founded in 1878, followed by the Frigid Fluid Company in 1892, Dodge Company in 1893, with other companies include Egyptian, now U.S. Chemical, as well as Kelco Supply Company (formerly L H Kellogg), Pierce Chemical Company (now owned by The Wilbert Company), Bondol Chemical Company, and Hydrol Chemical Company. There are many smaller and regional producers as well. Some funeral homes produce their own embalming fluids, although this practice has declined in recent decades as commercially available products have become of better quality and more readily available. Following the EU Biocides Legislation some pressure was brought to reduce the use of formaldehyde. IARC Classes Formaldehyde as a Class 1 Carcinogen. There are alternatives to formaldehyde and phenol-based fluids, but these are technically not preservatives but rather sanitising agents and are not widely accepted. However, The Champion Company has always been aware of the safety of the embalmer and created and distributed lower exposure fluids with less HCHO and by the 1990s Champion was the first to create and distribute HCHO Free Fluids. Only The Champion and The Dodge Company sell those fluids. Environmental effects Despite genuine concerns formaldehyde is a naturally occurring substance, of which human beings produce approximately 1.5 oz a day as a normal part of a healthy metabolism. Formaldehyde also occurs naturally in many fruits, such as bananas, apples, and carrots, and does not bioaccumulate in either plants or animals. https://formaldehyde.americanchemistry.com/Formaldehyde-Occurs-Naturally-and- Is-All-Around-Us.pdf Formaldehyde works to fixate the tissue of the deceased. This is the characteristic that also makes concentrated formaldehyde a hazardous when not handled using appropriate personal protective equipment. The carbon atom in formaldehyde, CH2O, carries a slight positive charge due to the high electronegativity of the oxygen double bonded with the carbon. The electropositive carbon will react with a negatively charged molecule and other electron-rich species. As a result, the carbon in the formaldehyde molecule bonds with electron-rich nitrogen groups called amines found in plant and animal tissue. This leads to formaldehyde cross-linking, bonding proteins with other proteins and DNA, rendering them dysfunctional or no longer useful. This is the reason for usage of formaldehyde as a preservative, as it thus prevents cellular decay and renders the tissue unsuitable for use as a nutrient source for bacteria. Formaldehyde is carcinogenic in humans and animals at excessive levels because the cross-linking can cause DNA to keep cells from halting the replication process. This unwarranted replication of cells can lead to cancer. Unicellular organisms found in the soil and groundwater are also quite sensitive to cross-linking, experiencing damage at a concentration of 0.3 mg to 22 mg per liter. Formaldehyde also affects aquatic invertebrates, with crustaceans being the most sensitive type. The range of concentration damaging them is 0.4 mg to 20 mg per liter. Formaldehyde released from the cremation of embalmed bodies enters the atmosphere and can remain suspended for up to 250 hours. It is readily soluble in water so it will bond with moisture in the atmosphere and rain down onto plants, animals, and water supplies below. As a result, formaldehyde content in precipitation can range from 110 Œºg to 1380 Œºg per liter. These concerns notwithstanding formaldehyde, as a ubiquitous chemical produced by living beings, is eminently biodegradable by both sunlight in air and bacteria in soil and water. https://www.americanchemistry.com/Media/PressReleasesTranscripts/ACC-news- releases/Formaldehyde-Is-Biodegradable.html The growth of the environment movement has caused some people to consider green burials where there are either no aldehyde-based chemicals used in the embalming process, or there is no embalming process at all. Embalming fluid meeting specific criteria for such burials is commercially available, and although it is not as effective as aldehyde-based solutions, is approved by the Green Burial Association of America.

Invented in the early 19th century, the tramp chair was a cage made of bent and riveted metal straps in the shape of a chair. An individual could be placed inside the chair and locked up securely, the chair thus acting as a jail cell, particularly in towns too small to build a jail. It was sometimes placed on a wheeled platform so it could be moved around easily. As its name suggests, the tramp chair was often used for vagrants who could be left inside it for a day or two as encouragement to move along. Made of iron, it would heat up or cool down uncomfortably depending on the weather, and town residents could jeer at and harass the occupant. It left no room to move around, so it would be very uncomfortable to sit in for a prolonged stretch of time. The American Police Hall of Fame and Police Museum in Miami states that \\"often the prisoner was stripped naked and the kids from the area would poke him with sticks.\\" The tramp chair was invented and made by Sanford Baker of Oakland, Maine. An original chair is in the Smithsonian and another is in the Bangor (Maine) Police Museum. The first person ever known to escape from this device was escapologist Theodore Hardeen, the brother of Harry Houdini.

He later served as a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives from North Carolina for one term.  Early life and education  Funderburk was born at Langley Field in Hampton, Virginia as the son of a pastor and school teacher. He grew up in Aberdeen, North Carolina and attended Wake Forest University from 1962 to 1967, earning a B.A. and M.A. He received his Ph.D. in 1974 from the University of South Carolina, with a thesis titled \\"British policy towards Romania, 1938‚Äì1940: A Study in Economic and Political Strategy\\".  Career  Prior to entering politics, Funderburk worked as a professor of history. He initially taught at Wingate University and then later at the University of South Carolina, Hardin‚ÄìSimmons University, and Campbell University. He was a Fulbright Scholar who later received Romania's highest award to a foreigner. The University of Bucharest and Campbell University gave him honorary doctorates. In 1981, Funderburk was chosen as the U.S. Ambassador to the Socialist Republic of Romania, and served until 1985. In Pinstripes and Reds, a book published in 1987, he described the process by which he was nominated and confirmed to be ambassador, as well as aspects of life in Romania during the administration of Nicolae Ceau»ôescu. In 1986, Funderburk ran for the U.S. Senate, but was defeated in the Republican primary by incumbent Jim Broyhill. Funderburk became a professional lecturer and writer in 1988 and was elected as a Republican to the 104th Congress in 1994, coming in as a part of the Republican Revolution. Funderburk was the first Republican to represent his district since 1901. Funderburk was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection to the 105th Congress.

This was enabled by changing the standard office air conditioner temperature to 28 ¬∞C (or about 82 ¬∞F) and introducing a liberal summer dress code in the bureaucracy of the Japanese government so staff could work in the warmer temperature. The campaign then spread to the private sector. This idea was proposed by the then-Minister Yuriko Koike under the cabinet of Prime Minister Junichir≈ç Koizumi. Initially the campaign was from June to September, but from 2011, when there were electricity shortages after the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami it was lengthened. It now runs from May to October.'Cool Biz' casual work attire campaign kicks off May 1, 2015 Mainichi Shimbun Retrieved May 4, 2015 Plan According to the Ministry of the Environment, central government ministries were to set air conditioner temperatures at 28 ¬∞C until September. The Cool Biz dress code advises workers to starch collars so they stand up and to wear trousers made from materials that breathe and absorb moisture. Additionally, workers are encouraged to wear short-sleeved shirts without jackets or ties. Many workers, though, were confused about whether they should follow the new stipulations‚Äîmany came to work with their jackets in hand and their ties in their pockets. Even those who liked the idea of dressing more casually sometimes became self-conscious during their commutes when they were surrounded by non-government employees who were all wearing standard business suits. Many government workers said they felt it was impolite not to wear a tie when meeting counterparts from the private sector. All of the government leaders took part in Cool Biz. Prime Minister Koizumi was frequently interviewed without a tie or jacket, and this produced a significantly raised profile of the campaign. Result of Cool Biz Campaign On October 28, 2005, the Ministry of Environment announced results of the Cool Biz campaign. The MOE conducted a web-based questionnaire survey on the Cool Biz campaign on September 30, 2005, covering some 1,200 men and women randomly extracted from an Internet panel recruited by a research company. Survey results indicate that 95.8% of respondents knew Cool Biz, and 32.7% of 562 respondents answered that their offices set the air conditioner thermostat higher than in previous years. Based on these figures, the Ministry estimated that the campaign resulted in a 460,000-ton reduction in CO2 emission, the equivalent volume of CO2 emitted by about 1 million households for one month. Some companies including Toyota request their employees not to wear jackets and ties even when meeting with business partners. The results for 2006 were even better, resulting in an estimated 1.14 million-ton reduction in CO2 emission, equivalent to the CO2 emissions by about 2.5 million households for one month. The Ministry also stated that it intends to continue encouraging people to set summer office temperatures at no lower than 28 ¬∞C as well as to work to have the Cool Biz concept take permanent root in society. In July 2009, the Cabinet Office announced results of a new questionnaire survey, which indicates that 91.8% of respondents knew about the Cool Biz campaign, and 57% of them put the campaign into practice. Economic results While Cool Biz spread energy savings to all businesses, the necktie business suffered. They claimed that their summer sales dropped drastically (an estimated 36%), and asked the Environment Minister to end the campaign. On the other hand, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) analyzed that the Cool Biz campaign increases replacement demand for clothing and generates positive macroeconomic effects on the GDP by 18 billion yen in summer 2005. Dai-Ichi Life Research Institute announced that the total economic effect was more than 100 billion yen in 2005. Warm Biz During winter 2005, there was talk on many of the major news networks of promoting a \\"Warm Biz\\" style for winter, suggesting that people wear waistcoats, knit sweaters, and lap blankets. Warm Biz was not endorsed by the Japanese government at first. The food industry eagerly promoted this campaign by selling foods that warm people up, such as nabemono. However, the electric utility industry had little enthusiasm for the campaign. Since fossil fuel heating is popular in northern Japan, Warm Biz had little effect on electric consumption. Thus, Warm Biz is more often referred in an environmental conservation context since fossil fuel heating releases more carbon dioxide than air conditioners do. Super Cool Biz Following the T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami in March 2011, the shutdown of many nuclear power plants for safety reasons led to energy shortages. To conserve energy, the government recommended setting air conditioners at 28 degrees Celsius, switching off computers not in use, and called for shifting work hours to the morning and taking more summer vacation than usual. The government then launched a \\"Super Cool Biz\\" campaign to encourage workers to wear outfits appropriate for the office yet cool enough to endure the summer heat. Polo shirts and trainers were allowed, while jeans and sandals were also acceptable under certain circumstances. June 1 marked the start of the Ministry of the Environment's Super Cool Biz campaign, with \\"full-page newspaper ads and photos of ministry workers smiling rather self-consciously at their desks wearing polo shirts and colorful Okinawa kariyushi shirts.\\" The campaign was repeated in 2012. Cool Biz outside Japan The South Korean Ministry of Environment and the British Trades Union Congress have promoted their own Cool Biz campaigns since summer 2006. The concept also inspired the United Nations to launch the \\"Cool UN\\" initiative in 2008.

The film stars Robert Stack, Sonny Bono and Farrah Fawcett-Majors, along with an all-star ensemble television cast in supporting roles.NBC to Premiere 3 for Money Show Los Angeles Times 4 Sep 1975: f14. It was inspired by the success of the Airport films.Tempo/People-Music: Tower Ticker Gold, Aaron. Chicago Tribune 30 Oct 1975: b2. Plot TOA airlines flight 502 - a Boeing 747-100, takes off from New York City to London. At the airport, a bomb threat in the airline's first- class passenger lounge turns out to be just an elaborate prank smoke bomb disguised as a more sinister explosive time bomb. In relief that the incident is just a prank Donaldson complains how this needlessly caused him stress on his weekend off work, to which the bomb technician derisively states how much more stressful the call to the bomb scare was for him because he was at a motel when he was called and thought it was his wife calling trying to reach him, implying he thought he had been caught in tryst with someone other than his wife. As the stress has momentarily passed this leads the assistant to Head of Security, Robert Davenport, to fortuitously presenting him with a letter found in his desk in-box he would not have received until the next morning. The letter explains that a series of murders will take place on Flight 502 before it lands. Robert Davenport notifies Captain Larkin, via the airline's direct radio channel. Donaldson and his team go over the backgrounds of all the passengers to find possible suspects, which irritates Larkin for the lack of details, causing him to be terse with an equally aggravated Donaldson who is none the happier for being talked down to while nursing a painful toothache. In the air, Captain Larkin, off duty Police Officer Daniel Myerson, and flight attendant Karen White look for suspicious passengers. At first teenage passenger Millard Kensington is suspected because he has a history with the airline as a known prankster who clogged a previous flight's toilets with 13 sponges he carried aboard. He is suspected of placing the fake bomb in the first class passenger lobby in New York is now on Flight 502. After confronting the teenager regarding the seriousness of his actions and getting him to admit he did place the fake bomb in the airline passenger lobby, he is nevertheless apparently clueless about the serious nature of the found letter. Realizing the teenager's lack of malice Captain Larkin demonstrates he too means no harm to the boy and successfully defuses the moment when he invites him to visit the cockpit later so he can show him \\"How this thing practically flies itself.\\" which the boy cheerfully accepts. He then relays a message back to Davenport that he thinks this is a red herring and requests further detailed backgrounds on the passengers as he only has names and addresses to go on from the flight manifest. Relationships develop on board between elderly singles Charlie Parkins and Ida Goldman, who acts as a comic relief with her Yiddish sense of humour, rock star Jack Marshall, and Marilyn Stonehurst, mystery writer Mona Briarly, and suave passenger Paul Barons. Briarly suspects Barons is actually a criminal who got away with stealing seven million dollars from a bank, but Barons denies it. The investigations on the ground and in the air produce several leads. It is discovered that the wife of passenger Otto Gruenwaldt who died because fellow passenger Dr. Kenyon Walker was not available to help. Then Gruenwaldt suffers a heart attack on board. Dr. Walker rushes to aid the dying man. Captain Larkin voices his apprehension at allowing Dr. Walker to treat Gruenwaldt and Myerson concurs openly stating \\"it wouldn't be the first time\\" implying someone in his position could take advantage of the situation to eliminate Gruenwaldt. Dr. Walker turns the tables on Larkin regarding whether he should apply the life saving drug or not, telling him \\"Alright you make the decision.\\". This puts the weight of life and death on Larkin's shoulders for this patient. Larkin clearly realizes he now may be to blame for stopping Dr. Walker from administering a life-saving medical treatment. He reverses his decision and allows Dr. Walker to go ahead and inject the life saving drug. While doing so, Dr. Walker brazenly states to Larkin and Myerson that they wouldn't even know if he gave Gruenwaldt \\"too much or too little\\" of the drug demonstrating to Larkin and Myerson how far they are beyond their depth of knowledge regarding medical expertise. Once the drug is administered via syringe Captain Larkin again attempts to assert his authority over Dr. Walker again by demanding he surrender the used syringe, implying it may be needed as evidence. Dr. Walker stands his ground and refuses to surrender the syringe in question and states that he is only answerable to \\"my peers and my profession\\" implying his Hippocratic Oath supersedes the Captain and Myerson's legal authority. Larkin sharply replies that while Dr. Walker may be responsible for just this one life but as Captain of the airplane he is responsible for over 250 passenger's lives. Dr. Walker again immediately cuts him short when he pointedly draws the line by stating to the Captain \\"we each have our jobs to do, you do yours and I'll do mine\\". Finally someone ventures to ask how long before they know about Gruenwaldt's survival, which he states will be in just few minutes and goes back to attending to Gruenwaldt who momentarily gains consciousness and begins to get upset that he has come to, realizing he might be expected to thank the same man responsible for his wife's death. He perceives this as dereliction of duty because Dr. Walker failed to receive the call, being at a party, missing the delicate operation he could have provided. Dr. Walker cuts him short and explains that he doesn't expect anything from Gruenwaldt but only asks he try to understand that life and death situations occur daily to the extent that he can't remember them all. Gruentwaldt eventually gives grudging thanks for the saving of his life but makes it clear that he will still carry a hatred of his saviour for the loss of his wife, which Dr. Walker sagely replies \\"then that is something which we will both have to live with.\\" Ray Garwood attacks Marshall, blaming him for the death of his daughter due to an overdose. Garwood denies leaving the note, and Captain Larkin and Myerson believe him. Then an apparent break in the investigation comes when Briarly tells the captain that a priest on board may be an imposter, because he did nothing when it appeared Gruenwaldt was near death. Donaldson checks the priest out and discovers he is indeed an imposter and a known thief, thereby placing him under suspicion. Myerson looks for the priest, but finds him dead in the dumbwaiter. At this point the threatening letter's contents are revealed to the passengers. Briarly again notices that Barons seems the most fazed by the priest's death, and wonders if the two men knew each other. Soon a second murder occurs; flight attendant Vera Franklin is found dead by the co-pilot, meaning the real murderer is still lurking. Concerned that he may be at risk now, Barons confesses to Myerson that he committed the bank robbery, and that the priest and Franklin were both involved in smuggling the money out of the country on the aircraft. Barons says he is the next target. Myerson agrees and pulls out a gun, proving he is the killer, having snapped when Barons escaped justice for his crime after no proof was found. Myerson takes the passengers hostage and explains he murdered the priest and looked through the luggage of the crew and found the money in Franklin's bag. Captain Larkin makes a drastic move to distract Myerson by releasing the oxygen masks and going for the gun. In the ensuing struggle, Barons is killed, the cabin catches on fire, and Myerson is badly burned. The passengers extinguish the fire just as the crisis ends. Coincidentally, Donaldson belatedly calls to warn Larkin about the danger of Myerson being reported by his superiors as unstable, much to the Captain's irritation regarding the timeliness of the message. Larkin voices his frustration with Donaldson's slow methods as the flight lands safely in London. On the ground, flight attendant White is alone with Captain Larkin in the cockpit and comes to say a final good bye and expresses her gratitude for Larkin saving the passengers but in a turnabout Larkin reveals his realization that White has conspired as the money smuggler of the stolen money. He explains how before the aircraft took off Franklin had dropped her bag, which had no money inside. Therefore, the money was put in the bag by the real guilty smuggler, Karen White. Larkin, in an ironic statement, tells White that in fact this will definitely be her last flight but not because of her originally expected honorable resignation. She will have to soon face the authorities in London to face responsibility for her actions that lead to the death of the innocent flight attendant Vera Franklin. Garwood still visibly frustrated about the circumstances of his daughter's death apologizes to Marshall. Dr. Walker and Gruenwaldt reconcile and form a new relationship with a promise to meet in the future for a game of chess. Charlie Perkins and Ida Goldman decide to share a hotel room. The elder man, Perkins, expresses his concerns of a potentially scandalous social appearance of the unmarried seniors sharing a room and how that will come across by asking \\"What will they think of us?\\" to which a typically unshakable Ida shrugs and responds \\"So they'll call us swingers\\". In the final scene, as Larkin accompanies Myerson down an escalator to hand him off to the waiting British police. Myerson demonstrates he is clearly delusional. He states that he and Larkin are in the \\"same business of protecting people\\". He further attempts to justify his actions, claiming he will be commended for protecting the people from criminals because he brought a thief to justice when the law would not. Mired in the delusional belief that he will be vindicated he shouts back to Larkin that he will put in a good word to the authorities for the Captain to get a commendation.

Murder on Flight 502 took place primarily on a Boeing 747, purportedly flying out of John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, but the opening title credits and first scenes are shot at Los Angeles International Airport. The \\"tacky production values\\" were evident throughout. Two different 747s with different liveries were shown at the airport, the aircraft takes off with a fake jet sound, then they show a different aircraft type landing, then the 747 is in flight. Despite having two flight attendants assigned to First Class, no one is served a drink except for Polly Bergen and the passenger next to her and maybe one other in the first row, and dinner is never served. Robert Stack, then mainly shooting in Europe, was still a television icon and was in demand for the movie-of-the-week features that were common in the 1970s.Maltin 1994, p. 834. In later interviews, Stack revealed that one of the prime incentives to sign on for Murder on Flight 502 was the opportunity to work with his wife Rosemarie and daughter Elizabeth.Stack and Evans 1980, p. 275.

The matchup features two long-tenured and media savvy coaches generally acknowledged among the top five ever in their sport, over two dozen players who went on to play in the WNBA, and two programs that have combined for 19 national championships. Their head-to-head matchups were consistently the top-rated games in the college women's field. Until the 2006-07 season, the two programs met annually in winter at one or both of the schools, but the rivalry is unique for having a third of its games occurring in the women's NCAA tournament. Four times, the national championship has been on the line. The schools started playing each other in 1995. At the end of 2016, UConn led the series 13-9, including 5-2 in the tournament and 4-0 for the title. However, the Lady Vols won the last three against UConn. On the day of every meeting during the rivalry series, both schools were ranked in the top 15 in the Associated Press rankings. In AP Poll history, Tennessee and UConn have the two longest appearance streaks in women's college basketball. Tennessee had a 565-week run spanning 32 years and UConn currently has a more than 500-week run covering almost 30 years. In addition, UConn has the most No. 1 appearances with 247 with Tennessee in second at 112. The two schools discontinued the regular-season series after the 2006-2007 season, and have not played each other since. The next season, both teams made the 2008 Final Four, but Stanford defeated UConn in the semifinals. Tennessee won the championship. In 2018, a home and home series was announced with the next meeting scheduled at UConn on January 23, 2020. Thirteen years after the series ended, UConn beat Tennessee in the rivalry rematch, 60-45. The coaches In its heyday, the rivalry was notable among team sports in that it almost unerringly focused on the sidelines rather than the floor. The two coaches were far and away the best known and best paid in their sport, with both being in the Basketball Hall of Fame and Women's Basketball Hall of Fame. Between them, they account for over 2,000 wins. On the Tennessee side was Pat Summitt, the all-time winningest NCAA Division I college basketball coach, male or female. Summitt won eight NCAA women's tournaments. She was the acknowledged dean of women's college basketball in the modern era. She was the Naismith College Coach of the Year six times. On the UConn side is Geno Auriemma, who has won eleven of the last twenty-four NCAA women's tournaments, four at the expense of Summitt in the finals. A media firebrand in the heart of ESPN country, Auriemma has become the most accomplished coach in the last decade, which included a record-breaking 111-game winning streak which began in the fall of 2014 and ended during the Final Four of 2017 NCAA women's tournament. He has seven Naismith awards to Summitt's six. The two poured gasoline on the fire in press conferences, with Auriemma at one point calling Tennessee the \\"Evil Empire\\". The two apparently mended fences after some sparring, as Auriemma noted in his autobiography, Geno. The games The two schools first met on January 16, 1995, when televised women's basketball was a rarity. At this high point, with dominant players such as Rebecca Lobo, Kara Wolters and Jennifer Rizzotti, UConn's program was on the rise, beating Tennessee during the regular season and again for the title and an undefeated regular season. They would win another rivalry game in 1996. The next three years belonged to Summitt, as the Lady Vols won four of the next five meetings with the Huskies en route to three straight national championships. The \\"Meeks\\"‚ÄîChamique Holdsclaw, Semeka Randall, and Tamika Catchings‚Äîand point guard Michelle Marciniak powered Tennessee past all rivals, including UConn. On the horizon, though, were Auriemma's most dominant classes yet, and possibly the strongest lineup ever in the women's game. The starting five of Sue Bird, Asjha Jones, Swin Cash, Tamika Williams, and (for the latter part of the run) Diana Taurasi gave UConn four of the next five national championships. In that run of 2000 to 2004, UConn crushed Tennessee in the rivalry, winning nine of the next eleven meetings, including the 2000, 2003, and 2004 championship games. In the three seasons after Taurasi went to the WNBA, Summitt rebounded with strong new players like Candace Parker, and won each meeting. UConn's program lacked a dominant scorer like Taurasi, and Tennessee made the most of this vulnerability. With these results, the rivalry continues to be top-of-mind in the women's game, even years after its discontinuation. A matchup in the 2002 Final Four at the Alamodome in San Antonio was in front of the largest crowd in women's history (29,619). The 2006 regular-season game at Thompson‚ÄìBoling Arena in Knoxville drew the largest crowd ever for a regular-season women's game (24,653). After the 2007 game, Auriemma noted that the rivalry, while still intense, lost some of its edge because of increasing parity in the women's game. As an illustration, 2006 was the first time since 1999 that neither UConn nor Tennessee had made the Final Four. He remarked, \\"In some sense, a small sense, it's still the Red Sox and the Yankees. It still is. But there's still a lot more good things going on in college basketball now. That's just the reality of it.\\" Thirteen years after the series ended, the rivalry resumed. With both programs in a rebuild‚ÄîUConn ranked #3 and Tennessee ranked #23‚Äîthe two met in Hartford in 2020 where UConn won 60-45. The two will meet again in Knoxville during the 2020‚Äì21 season. Results Other sports The rivalry has now begun to spread into other sports as the two schools have agreed to play each other in other matchups in the future. On September 4, 2008, UConn and Tennessee agreed to a home and home series in football for the 2015 and 2016 seasons, but in order to play Virginia Tech at Bristol Motor Speedway in 2016, the series has been postponed. Furthermore, because of UConn's \\"Gang of Five\\" status while Tennessee was in the \\"Power Five,\\" the series may not be held. Nearly a year later on July 22, 2009, Huskies men's basketball head coach Jim Calhoun and Vols men's basketball head coach Bruce Pearl agreed to a home and home basketball series in the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 seasons. Summitt's son Tyler was on the Volunteers' roster for both games, which the two schools split. During the 2012-13 season, Tyler Summitt joined Marquette's coaching staff for the women's team, the final year of the pre-split Big East. The Huskies won against the Golden Eagles in both games. The Summitt family's rivalry is now at Connecticut 16, Summitts 10‚ÄîPat was 9-13 during the rivalry, while Tyler was 1-1 at Tennessee against Connecticut as a men's basketball player, and 0-2 as Marquette's assistant coach.

The island is long (north/south), and is wide (east/west). The most famous building on the island is the Basilica di San Giulio close to which is the monumental old seminary (1840s). Since 1976 it has been transformed into a Benedictine monastery. The little island, just west of the lakeshore village of Orta San Giulio, has very picturesque buildings, and takes its name from a local patron saint (Julius of Novara), who lived in the second half of the 4th century. The church of San Giulio, Castellanza, which is located in Castellanza, Varese, northern Italy, was named after the island.  History  In the 5th century, a small chapel (oratorium) was erected on the island, probably to commemorate the evangelizer Saint Julius, who had died there. From archaeological finds it is known that a new, larger church already existed in the 6th century: here Filacrio, the bishop of Novara, asked to be buried. Around the same time, an octagonal building - probably a baptistery - was erected in the middle of the island. Every trace of it disappeared in the 19th century when the massive building of the seminary was built. In the 12th century a new romanesque basilica was built, thus altering the previous one to some extent.

History The MLO site was first developed in 1954 as Mount Lemmon Air Force Station, a radar installation of the Air Defense Command. Upon transfer to the Steward Observatory 1970, the site was converted to an infrared observatory. Until 2003, a radar tower operated from Fort Huachuca was used to track launches from the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico and Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Telescopes Below are the 8 telescopes currently operating at the observatory. * The Steward Observatory Telescope is a Cassegrain reflector used for the Mount Lemmon Survey (MLS), which is part of the Catalina Sky Survey (CSS). It was built in the late 1960s and first installed at Catalina Station on Mount Bigelow, which is nearby in the Santa Catalina Mountains. It was moved to Mt. Lemmon in 1972, and then re-housed in its current location in 1975. Its original metal primary mirror performed poorly and was replaced in 1977 with a glass mirror made of Cer-Vit. It is one of the telescopes used by students at Astronomy Camp. It discovered 2011 AG5, an asteroid which achieved 1 on the Torino Scale.Asteroid 2011 AG5 - A Reality Check (NASA) * The UMN-MLOF (University of Minnesota Mount Lemmon Observing Facility) telescope began operating in 1970. It is a Dall-Kirkham optical/near infrared and is of the same general design as the 1.5 m Steward telescope and another at San Pedro M√°rtir. The original metal mirror performed poorly and was replaced with a Cer-Vit mirror in 1974. The University of California, San Diego (UCSD) was originally a partner of UMN in operating the telescope. * The CSS (Catalina Sky Survey) reflecting telescope is an unusual Pressman-Camichel design and is used to provide automated follow up observations of newly discovered near-Earth objects. It was originally located at Catalina Station and was moved to MLO in 1975. It was refurbished in 2008 and placed in a new dome in 2009 before being integrated into CSS operations. * The KASI robotic telescope was installed in 2003 and is the only instrument of the Mt.

History Broadmoor is low-lying ground in New Orleans, and was only substantially developed beginning in the early 20th century after improved drainage was initiated (see: Drainage in New Orleans). Before being developed, the area was a large marsh and was a fishing spot for Uptowners. Early construction were mostly high raised houses for fear of repeats of historic floods, but after decades with little problem more low lying residential structures were built in Broadmoor. The first area drainage canals were built in 1885. In 1903 a pumping station at Broad Street and Washington within the Broadmoor boundaries opened in 1903. In 1915, pumps more powerful than previous ones were established at that pumping station. After 1915, smaller groups of people began settling the area.Seidman, p. 61. During the early 1920s a sharp population increase occurred in Broadmoor. Over one third of Broadmoor's houses and the Wilson School, the first public school in Broadmoor, were built during that decade.

History JCPenney was an original anchor store, along with Watson's (later Peebles), and Leggett (now Belk). A food court, called \\"Cafe Commons\\", and a Walmart store were added to the eastern end of the mall in 1991. In 2003, Walmart's relocation to the new Harrisonburg Crossing shopping center left the Valley Mall with a large amount of vacant space. This space remained vacant through 2003 and 2004. In early 2005, the former Walmart, as well as the food court, were demolished to make way for new retail tenants. Target, Old Navy, and rue21 were constructed on the site in an outdoor format, with the enclosed mall reconfigured to end at the former food court entrance. A Harrisonburg police officer is assigned to the Valley Mall and another local shopping center. In addition, the mall and some individual stores have their own security personnel. As is typical with shopping malls in the United States, the busiest time of the year for the Valley Mall is between Thanksgiving and Christmas, with the day after Thanksgiving being particularly busy. In January 1999, after a controversy about fundraising by charities, the mall allocated a kiosk for charities to use.

Officially formed in 1798, the church has a rich German history.  History  The first evidence of a congregation on the current site is 1765, but the official land grant was bestowed upon the congregation in 1798. The founders of the church were largely Pennsylvania Germans (deutsch). The early records of the church have been lost partly as the result of two fires‚Äîthe first in 1950, the second in 2001. However, in both fires, the church's bell tower, which boasts a distinct blue neon sign in the shape of a cross, has remained intact. The church buildings have, at different times, been used by the Reformed Church in America and various Lutheran synods. The members of St. John's were instrumental in the founding of two Lutheran colleges‚Äîthe early but now non-existent Concordia College of Conover and Lenoir-Rhyne College (now Lenoir-Rhyne University).

Early models were usually powered by a gasoline engine, with either a mechanical drive train or a generator providing electricity to traction motors (\\"gas-electrics\\"). After a number of years of service, it was common for doodlebugs to be repowered with a diesel engine. Doodlebugs sometimes pulled an unpowered trailer car, but were more often used singly. They were popular with some railroads during the first part of the 20th century to provide passenger and mail service on lightly used branch lines at less expense than with a train consisting of a locomotive and coaches. Several railroads, mostly small regional and local networks, provided their main passenger services through doodlebugs in a cost- cutting effort. History The development of gasoline engines led railroads to seek it as a higher efficiency alternative to steam power for low-volume branch line services at the start of the 20th century. The McKeen railmotor was a line of self-propelled gasoline-driven railcars produced between 1905 and 1917. The 200 HP motor on the 55-foot long or 70-foot long units drove only one set of wheels, and the lack of power and traction, the unreliability of their transmissions, and an inability to reverse, were major limitations. General Electric (‚ÄúGE‚Äù) was the pioneer of gas-electric railcars: GE in February, 1906 rebuilt a wood passenger coach into a gas-electric unit which was placed in trial service on the Delaware and Hudson Railroad. The St. Louis‚ÄìSan Francisco Railway was an early adopter of this technology, placing an initial order for ten gas-electric units in 1910 and seven additional by 1913, giving it the distinction of having the largest fleet of gas-electric motor cars in the country. The petroleum-electric drive control system invented in 1914 by Hermann Lemp, an engineer with GE, became the technological foundation of self-propelled gasoline railcars in the 1920s. In 1923 the Electro-Motive Company began production of self-propelled railcars, subcontracting bodies to the St. Louis Car Company, prime movers to the Winton Engine Company, and electrical equipment to General Electric. The Pullman Company was subsequently added as a subcontractor for car bodies. Improvements to railcars were sought by The Pullman Company, who experimented with lightweight designs in partnership with the Ford Motor Company in 1925, then enlisted the services of pioneering all-metal aircraft designer William Bushnell Stout in 1931 to adapt airplane fuselage design concepts to railcars. In 1931 the Budd Company entered a partnership with the French tire company Michelin to produce lightweight stainless steel Budd-Michelin railcars in the US. Those advances in lightweight railcar design were an important step in the development of the lightweight diesel-electric streamliners of the 1930s. Production of self-propelled railcars dropped off with the onset of the Great Depression, which hurt the market for branch line services. But production was revived in 1949 with introduction of the Budd Rail Diesel Car. The variant name hoodelbug was largely limited to the mid-Atlantic states, particularly Pennsylvania.Shawmut Line's Famous Hoodlebug A major hiking trail in Indiana County, Pa., is named Hoodlebug Trail.Parks and Rec: Hoodlebug Trail The last remaining Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe (ATSF) Gas-Electric Doodlebug, M.177, is on display at the City of Los Angeles \\"Travel Town Museum\\" in Griffith Park.

Hindi Speaking town, and also there is a holy shiva temple its seems like amarnath cave, it's situated at pipaliya haat mughalsarah road. Transport It is quite easy to reach Sironj from Bhopal than from Vidisha due to better roads and frequent buses plying between Bhopal and Sironj than Vidisha and Sironj. It takes about three hours by a public transport bus to reach Sironj from Bhopal, connected with State Highway 23. These buses are available at ISBT Habibganj & Putli Ghar bus stand (earlier Berasia bus stand), Bhopal. The nearest railway station is Ganj Basoda, 45 kilometres east of Sironj, which lies on the main Mumbai-Delhi, Delhi-Chennai railway route.  History  Historically, Sironj was a part of the Malwa region, on the fringes of Bundelkhand, and has been a Jain pilgrimage ( Digambar Jain Nasiyaji Jinoday Teerth. As a part of the kingdom of the Nawabs of Tonk, it bordered Gwalior State under the Scindhias. At the time of independence of India, Sironj was a part of the Tonk state of Rajasthan. Thus, it became a land-locked district of Rajasthan surrounded from all four sides by Madhya Pradesh. Under the State Reorganization Act of 1956, Sironj was made a part of Madhya Pradesh. However, it lost its status of a district and became a block (sub-district) under the Vidisha district of MP. Being very close to the medieval trade route between Delhi and Gujarat, Sironj was full of traders. The most famous of such traders were the Maheshwaris, who later left Sironj taking offence on the actions of the Nawab of Sironj. Their deserted palaces still dominate the skyline of Sironj, which was famous for its three tiered market. In a single building, there were shops that were partly underground and partly on the surface (meant for customers on feet), shops that were slightly raised (for the customers on the horseback) and shops on the first floor (for the customers on elephant -back). Many of these shops survive. Sironj is one of the oldest cities of India. It was also known for Moughal district during the time of Mughals and was a big trade centre connected directly to ship port of Gujarat. Water cooling pots and woven mats were exported to outside countries. To know more about Sironj, one can read the book Aasar e Malwa describing brief history of area. It also has a famous Madan Mohan temple said to be constructed centuries ago whose sibling is said be situated in Vrindavan. The Jama Masjid said to be Built By Aurangzeb. During the 18th century, great Trigonometric Survey is organised by Sir George Everest to measure the height of Mount Everest in which Sironj is one of the three observatories in India. This survey was later completed by Radhanath Sikdar using a theodolite. The ruins of these observatories still exist near Sironj, in a village called BHOORI TORI on Guna road. One can find there a good English architecture. The Girdhari Temple situated in the town is assigned to the 11th century AD. It is known for its sculptures and fine carvings. The temples of Jatashankar and Mahamai are said to be old and sacred. It is said that Tatya Tope of 1857-fame has halted here for some time. More information about Tatya tope's Sironj Hault is available in the book Operation Red Lotus by Parag Tope. You can also find a graveyard of colonial infantry on northern part of Sironj, dates embossed on the headstones with names of soldiers who died there during 1857 rebellion. The Mahamai temple is 5 km to the southwest of Sironj. It is situated on a hill.

Biography Tchaikovsky was born in Vyatka. He spent the first part of his life on his mother's estate, and studied at a public school at Vyatka and later on in St. Petersburg. In 1868, he entered the St. Petersburg University, and got his degree in chemistry in 1872. While studying in St. Petersburg, he joined a radical student group which would later be known as the Circle of Tchaikovsky after its most famous member. The group advocated revolutionary socialist ideals which formed the basis of the Narodnik movement. But under the political r√©gime of Russia in the 1870s, no public body or society could act freely if its activity was not fully approved by the government. Much effort was expended to suppress the promoters of the Narodnik movement, and Tchaikovsky was twice arrested. Under these conditions the new party soon lost its educational character and became a revolutionary and terrorist association. Tchaikovsky did not approve of this new tendency and joined a social-religious group, which received the name of ‚ÄúGod-men‚Äù because its members tried to find in themselves a reflection of God. However, they were still followers of Russian Orthodoxy. In 1874 Tchaikovsky left Russia, and a year later he went to the United States with a small party of men and women who shared his political views and religious feelings. They founded a communistic settlement at ‚ÄúCedar Vale,‚Äù near Wichita, Kansas, and tried to work out their new religious and social teaching. The experiment proved a failure. After two years of hard experience, Tchaikovsky and his friends were obliged to recognize that mankind was not yet ready for the communistic life which they believed to be an imminent development of the future. They regarded communistic life as senseless without a constant feeling of the presence of God in the case of each member of the community, and this essential condition could not be achieved. Therefore, they returned to the ‚Äúold world of antagonism.‚Äù The awakening was especially hard for Tchaikovsky, who not only found it necessary to reconstruct his conception of the world, but had a family to keep and no means of livelihood. He worked for some time as an ordinary workman in a shipbuilding yard and in a sugar factory near Philadelphia. His health broke down and with his family he joined the religious community of the Shakers, where he remained for a year. In 1879 he returned to Europe, and in 1880 took up his residence in England, renewing his active participation in the Russian revolutionary organizations abroad. He met Peter Kropotkin, a former member of the Tschaikovsky Circle, in London in 1881, and together they attempted to organize English workers. He was a member of the ‚ÄúRed Cross of the Narodnaia Volia,‚Äù and organized the supply of revolutionary literature to Russia. In 1905, during the first Russian revolution, he made a tour of America, lecturing on the subject and collecting funds for the struggle against the Imperial regime. In 1907 he returned to Russia. There he was arrested on a charge of conspiracy against the Government and spent 11 months in the St. Peter and St. Paul Fortress at St. Petersburg. He was released on bail, ¬£5,000 having been collected by his friends, chiefly in England and the United States. In 1910 he was brought to trial, but discharged for lack of proof. He remained in Russia and took a great interest in the work of cooperative organizations. During World War I, he was very active under the flag of the Russian Red Cross, supplying food to the population of the fighting area. After the February Revolution of 1917, he was elected member of the Petrograd Soviet, where he used his influence to oppose Bolshevik propaganda. After the Bolshevik October revolution of 1917, He was elected member of the short-lived Constituent Assembly. As a member of the ‚ÄúCommittee for the Salvation of the Motherland and of the Revolution,‚Äù and of the ‚ÄúCommittee for the Defence of the Constituent Assembly,‚Äù he helped organize the struggle against the Bolsheviks in the ensuing Russian Civil War. In 1918 Tchaikovsky was one of the founders of the ‚ÄúUnion of the reconstruction of Russia,‚Äù an anti-Bolshevik organization of the left parties of Moscow. He was also elected member of the Ufa directorate. On his way to Siberia, he came to Vyatka, where he took the lead in an insurrection against the Bolsheviks and entered into negotiations with the Allied force at Archangel. He took part in the coup d'√©tat of August 2 at Archangel and became president of the Supreme Administrative Board of the North Region. After the break-up of a conspiracy of monarchist officers, he organized the Provisional Government of the Northern Region under his own leadership. Tchaikovsky was sent by his government to Paris, where he represented the interests of the North Region before the Versailles Conference. He was a member of the ‚ÄúRussian Political Delegation‚Äù in Paris until its dissolution in February 1921. He was an active member of the irregular freemasonic lodge, the Grand Orient of Russia‚Äôs Peoples. Tchaikovsky died in Harrow, England in 1926.

From his home in Jefferson County, New York, Osborn raised a company for light artillery service which became known as Company (or Battery) D, First Regiment, New York Light Artillery. Osborn's company served with the Army of the Potomac earning high marks and he was promoted to captain, major and colonel. As major, Osborn served under Major General Oliver O. Howard in the XI Corps leading in exemplary fashion (although the XI Corps was routed in both the Battle of Chancellorsville and Battle of Gettysburg). Osborn commanded the corps' artillery brigade at Gettysburg, and he was involved in the defense of Cemetery Hill on July 2, 1863, when the position was attacked by troops of Maj. Gen. Jubal Early. Osborn transferred to the Western theater with Howard. He served as inspector general when Howard became commander of the Army of the Tennessee. He left a detailed account of Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman's March to the Sea. Reconstruction and politics After Osborn's military service ended, he was appointed assistant commissioner for the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands as part of Reconstruction in Florida in 1865 and 1866. He also practiced law while living in Tallahassee, Florida. Osborn was a member of the State constitutional convention which created The 1868 Florida Constitution. He then moved to Pensacola, Florida and was elected to the Florida Senate. Shortly thereafter, Florida was reinstated to the U.S. Congress. While still only in his mid-30s, Osborn was elected to the United States Senate as a Republican and served from 1868 to 1873. He is credited with being instrumental in passing legislation to complete construction of the Washington Monument\\"Tribute to the Late Senator Thomas Ward Osborn,\\" Congressional Record, V. 150, Pt. 6, April 20, 2004 to May 4 2004, S4291-S4292 (which had been halted since before the Civil War). Retirement Osborn did not run for reelection in 1872. He served as the U.S. commissioner at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1876, the first official world's fair in the United States. In his retirement, Osborn engaged in law and literature in New York City where he died in 1898. Thomas Osborn is interred at Hillside Cemetery in North Adams, Massachusetts.

Established in Randwick in 1984, International Grammar focuses its curriculum on languages, and to a lesser extent music, and currently caters for approximately 1,200 students from early learning to Year 12. The school provides an alternative to a denominational independent school education. International Grammar School is affiliated with the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia (AHISA), the Junior School Heads Association of Australia (JSHAA), and the Association of Independent Schools of New South Wales (AIS NSW). History International Grammar School was established on 3 February 1984 at Stanley Street, Randwick, formerly the premises of the Little Sisters of the Poor. At its foundation the school's educational objective was to provide bilingual education from preschool onwards, and to promote internationalism, music and racial tolerance. By 1985 the school had an enrolment of around 120 students, however by the following year the school's future was in doubt due to its failure to gain NSW Government recognition, thus making its students ineligible to sit Year 10 and NSW Higher School Certificate (HSC) examinations. IGS was subsequently forced to battle through eight court cases. The school was also facing crippling losses of money and enrolments had fallen by 60 per cent to around 40 students. In May 1986, the school won its registration appeal. By the end of the school year of 1988, enrolments had grown to 130. As student numbers continued to increase and the need for specialised High School teaching facilities was identified, it was determined that an additional site was required for the school. From 1990 to 1994, new premises in Balmain were utilised as a Senior High School, accommodating Years 11 and 12. In 1994, leasing arrangements were negotiated with South Sydney Council in terms of which the school was to move progressively to a new site in Ultimo. During this time, temporary accommodation was provided for years 7 to 12 in a refurbished woolstore. This arrangement with Council was for a new school to be constructed on the historical site of the Dalgety Woolstore in Kelly Street, Ultimo. The school was officially established on this, its current site, in July 1997. Curriculum The school's main emphasis is on languages and it offers a wide range of language courses for study from Preschool through to the HSC. Students are required to learn a second language from when they start at the school until the end of Year 10, and in Years 7 and 8 are required to learn a third language. Either of these may be continued to HSC level. The school also offers to students in Years 10 and 11 an exchange program to its overseas sister schools in Italy, France, Germany and Japan, as well as exchanges to Spain and China for Years 8 and 9. The creative arts, including music, design and drama, also play an important role in the school's curriculum. Campus International Grammar School is situated on two main campus in Ultimo ‚Äì one on Kelly St and another nearby on Mountain St. The Kelly St Campus is made up of three buildings, The recently renamed Reg St Leon Building (formally Kelly St), the Wright Building and the Kerrie Murphy Building. Due to increasing demand for space, the roofs of the main campus are opened for playing; one as a basketball court; the other with primary school equipment.

A plasmid preparation is a method of DNA extraction and purification for plasmid DNA. Many methods have been developed to purify plasmid DNA from bacteria. These methods invariably involve three steps: * Growth of the bacterial culture * Harvesting and lysis of the bacteria * Purification of plasmid DNA  Growth of the bacterial culture  Plasmids are almost always purified from liquid bacteria cultures, usually E. coli, which have been transformed and isolated. Virtually all plasmid vectors in common use encode one or more antibiotic resistance genes as a selectable marker, for example a gene encoding ampicillin or kanamycin resistance, which allows bacteria that have been successfully transformed to multiply uninhibited. Bacteria that have not taken up the plasmid vector are assumed to lack the resistance gene, and thus only colonies representing successful transformations are expected to grow. Bacteria are grown under favourable conditions.  Harvesting and lysis of the bacteria  When bacteria are lysed under alkaline conditions (pH 12.0‚Äì12.5) both chromosomal DNA and protein are denatured; the plasmid DNA however, remains stable. Some scientists reduce the concentration of NaOH used to 0.1M in order to reduce the occurrence of ssDNA. After the addition of acetate- containing neutralization buffer the large and less supercoiled chromosomal DNA and proteins precipitate, but the small bacterial DNA plasmids stay in solution.  Preparations by size  Kits are available from varying manufacturers to purify plasmid DNA, which are named by size of bacterial culture and corresponding plasmid yield. In increasing order, these are the miniprep, midiprep, maxiprep, megaprep, and gigaprep. The plasmid DNA yield will vary depending on the plasmid copy number, type and size, the bacterial strain, the growth conditions, and the kit. = Minipreparation = Minipreparation of plasmid DNA is a rapid, small-scale isolation of plasmid DNA from bacteria. It is based on the alkaline lysis method. The extracted plasmid DNA resulting from performing a miniprep is itself often called a \\"miniprep\\". Minipreps are used in the process of molecular cloning to analyze bacterial clones. A typical plasmid DNA yield of a miniprep is 5 to 50 ¬µg depending on the cell strain. Miniprep of a large number of plasmids can also be done conveniently on filter paper by lysing the cell and eluting the plasmid on to filter paper. = Midipreparation = The starting E. coli culture volume is 15-25 mL of Lysogeny broth (LB) and the expected DNA yield is 100-350 ¬µg. = Maxipreparation = The starting E. coli culture volume is 100-200 mL of LB and the expected DNA yield is 500-850 ¬µg. = Megapreparation = The starting E. coli culture volume is 500 mL ‚Äì 2.5 L of LB and the expected DNA yield is 1.5-2.5 mg. = Gigapreparation = The starting E. coli culture volume is 2.5-5 L of LB and the expected DNA yield is 7.5‚Äì10 mg.  Purification of plasmid DNA  Multiple methods of nucleic acid purification exist. All work on the principle of generating conditions where either only the nucleic acid precipitates, or only other biomolecules precipitate, allowing the nucleic acid to be separated. = Ethanol precipitation = Ethanol precipitation works by using ethanol as an antisolvent of DNA, causing it to precipitate out of solution. The soluble fraction is discarded to remove other biomolecules. = Spin column = Spin column-based nucleic acid purification precipitates nucleic acid such that it binds a solid matrix and other components flow through. The conditions are then changed to elute the purified nucleic acid. = Phenol‚Äìchloroform extraction = In a phenol‚Äìchloroform extraction, addition of a phenol/chloroform mixture will dissolve protein and lipid contaminants, leaving the nucleic acids in the aqueous phase. It also denatures proteins, like DNase, which is especially important if the plasmids are to be used for enzyme digestion. Otherwise, smearing may occur in enzyme restricted form of plasmid DNA.

He served in the Mexican-American War as a private. After the war he studied law, passed the bar and set up practice in Mineral Point, Wisconsin. He was a district attorney from 1850 to 1854, then was elected to the Wisconsin State Senate in 1855, serving until 1856. During his term, he was also the adjutant general of Wisconsin from 1855 to 1858. He became a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly in 1860 and served as speaker in 1861.Amasa Cobb, Wisconsin Historical Society At the outset of the Civil War, on July 12, 1861, he joined the Union army as Colonel of the 5th Wisconsin Infantry Regiment, serving in the Army of the Potomac in several campaigns and battles. Most notably, Cobb succeeded Brigadier General Winfield S. Hancock in command of a brigade in second division VI Corps at the Battle of Antietam, after Hancock was transferred to command the first division II Corps. In the fall of 1862, he was elected to the 38th Congress from Wisconsin's 3rd congressional district for a two-year term. Cobb was reelected to the 39th, 40th, and 41st Congresses, serving until 1871. His last action with 5th Wisconsin Infantry was the Battle of Fredericksburg. Despite being a sitting Representative in the United States House of Representatives, he resumed his military career on September 29, 1864, when he was named as Colonel of the newly raised 43rd Wisconsin Infantry Regiment. After arriving at Nashville, Tennessee, in October, Cobb and his regiment guarded the important supply and railroad depot at Johnsonville in Benton County, Tennessee, on the Tennessee River. On November 4, Cobb's men fought off an attack by John Bell Hood's Confederates led by Major General Nathan Bedford Forrest in the Battle of Johnsonville. For the rest of the war, the regiment was positioned in various parts of Tennessee to guard railroads and supply routes, and Cobb briefly commanded a brigade under Major General Robert H. Milroy. He and his men were mustered out of the service on June 24, 1865 in Nashville before returning to Wisconsin and civilian life. On January 13, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Cobb for appointment to the grade of brevet brigadier general of volunteers to rank from March 13, 1865, for his distinguished services at the Battles of Williamsburg, Golding's Farm, Virginia, during the Seven Days Battles and Antietam, and the United States Senate confirmed the appointment on March 12, 1866.Eicher, 2001, p. 742. After the war, Cobb became a member of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States. In 1871, Cobb moved to Lincoln, Nebraska, where he started to practice law again. He was appointed mayor of Lincoln in 1873, and then became associate justice of the Nebraska Supreme Court in 1878 to 1892. The last four years, from 1888 to 1892, he served as Nebraska's chief justice. Amasa Cobb died in Los Angeles, California, on July 5, 1905. He was buried in Wyuka Cemetery, Lincoln, Nebraska.

They can be found from mid-Queensland to south of Sydney. It is associated with the coast and inland, and is distributed as far west in New South Wales to the SA border.  Description  Litoria latopalmata spawn The broad-palmed frog is pale to dark brown on it dorsal surface; it can have darker blotches or variegations. Its skin is smooth, with the occasional wart on its back. A black band runs from the snout, through the eye and tympanum, and breaks into blotches down the side. A white line breaks the black band in front of the eye, and runs under the eye. The thighs are marbled yellow and black and the armpit is yellow. The lower lip is normally marbled black and white. The belly is white.  Ecology and behaviour  The broad-palmed frog will call in a large chorus during mating season, around a still water source, normally a dam, but may be a roadside ditch, temporary puddle or still area of a stream. The call is a short \\"quark\\" repeated continuously. This species of frog can be found great distances from the breeding area and tends to inhabit open country or forest. Up to 350 eggs are laid in mass either floating or attached to vegetation. This egg mass will often sink once disturbed. Hatching occurs 3‚Äì6 days after laying, depending on temperature. Tadpoles are sandy gold and reach a maximum size of 49mm. The developmental period is short, as eggs are often laid in very temporary water. Metamorph frogs resemble the adult and measure from 14-17mm in length.  Sources  Pale coloured Broad Palmed Frog * Anstis, M. 2002. Tadpoles of South-eastern Australia.

He said that the responsibility of this generation of Bhutanese was to ensure the success of democracy. He traveled extensively to explain and discuss the Draft Constitution of Bhutan with the people and to encourage participation in the upcoming democratic exercises.

Many government initiatives were undertaken by the new King with a view to strengthen the system in preparation for the democratic changes in 2008.

A variation of land reform focuses on improving the lives of people living in remote and difficult areas, with the Rehabilitation Project.

The project saw tremendous success, and similar projects are in the pipeline in other parts of Bhutan. =Kidu= One of the most important and ongoing works of the King involves Kidu, a tradition based on the rule of a Dharma King whose sacred duty is to care for his people. The people can access Kidu in several ways: by applying to the Office of the Royal Chamberlain, which accepts applications during working hours; by sending applications through Dzongkhag Kidu Officers in every district, whose responsibility is to collect such applications as well as identify people who need help; and by appealing to the King directly. To give the people the opportunity for direct appeal, the King on his numerous road trips across the country stops for every potential appellant along the road. There are several Kidu schemes designed to help certain groups of people, such as students unable to afford even the free education available in the country, elderly citizens, and those requiring medical treatment. The King has also continued the tradition of giving state land to landless farmers around the country. The ongoing project takes him to remote villages and communities. Kidu includes providing immediate assistance to victims of natural disasters. The King personally supervised the rebuilding efforts following major earthquakes and floods in 2009 and 2011. In 2012, the King granted Nu.100 million from the Armed Forces to the Zhung Dratshang for the Dzong Reconstruction Fund, as on 24 June, the historic Wangduephodrang Dzong was destroyed by fire.

The King himself rushed to the scene within hours. =DeSuung Training Programme= The King initiated military-style training for volunteers known as the DeSuung Training Programme in 2011, on the request of the youth. The programme aims to equip volunteers with the skill to provide assistance during emergencies, and has been hugely successful, with over 3000 volunteers having completed their training and volunteering for public events and emergencies. =Amnesty= The Constitution of Bhutan empowers the King to grant amnesty to prisoners. In 2014 he pardoned 45 prisoners who had been imprisoned for possessing an excessive amount of tobacco, following an amendment of the Tobacco Control Act of Bhutan 2010 by the Parliament of Bhutan, since the amended law could not be enforced retroactively, and previous offenders who would not be liable now would still be tried under previous laws. The Royal Pardon was granted to those who were not repeat offenders and had good prison records. Public perception and popularity abroad The \\"People's King\\", like his father, enjoys exceptionally warm relations with India. He has visited India on several occasions, and was invited as the Chief Guest for India's 64th Republic Day celebrations in 2013. Following his 2006 visit to Thailand as Crown Prince, the King has been immensely popular in Thailand. The number of Thai tourists visiting Bhutan has increased steadily since the visit. In November 2011, the King and Queen Jetsun Pema made a state visit to Japan; they were the first state guests to Japan since the 2011 earthquake. It was reported that the Japanese were infatuated with the King and Queen of Bhutan. In March 2015, the King and Queen were among the foreign dignitaries who attended the funeral of Singapore's former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew.Straitstimes Also, the King and the Queen attended the funeral of King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand in October 2017 and the enthronement ceremony of Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako of Japan in October 2019.

David was working full-scale promoting the circumstances of his life for the benefit of the pottery exhibitions of his and his wife's work, and magazine editors found the thick patina of past grandeur as presented to them by David irresistible and pages of glory adorned the 1955 magazines and newspaper articles. From here on, in the family's history no members could think of themselves again as quite so elite or socially removed although in the popular sense as an artistic family the notoriety was never greater. The generations that followed (including those born before 1955) grew up in this imposed social and cultural circumstance. See also *Nasturtiums (E. Phillips Fox) . . . Edith Anderson, as model to E.

The man wears a top hat, long coat, tall collar, and striped trousers with straps under his shoes. 1822. During the 1820s in European and European-influenced countries, fashionable women's clothing styles transitioned away from the classically influenced \\"Empire\\"/\\"Regency\\" styles of c. 1795‚Äì1820 (with their relatively unconfining empire silhouette) and re- adopted elements that had been characteristic of most of the 18th century (and were to be characteristic of the remainder of the 19th century), such as full skirts and clearly visible corseting of the natural waist. The silhouette of men's fashion changed in similar ways: by the mid-1820s coats featured broad shoulders with puffed sleeves, a narrow waist, and full skirts. Trousers were worn for smart day wear, while breeches continued in use at court and in the country. Women's fashions =Overview= Evening dress of 1823 features short puffed sleeves and is worn with a patterned shawl Ruffled collar and sheer linen cap, 1823 During the first half of the 1820s, there were slight gradual modifications of Regency styles, with the position of the waistline trending successively lower than the high waistline of the Regency (just below the breasts), and also further development of the trends of the late 1810s towards giving skirts a somewhat conical silhouette (as opposed to earlier more clinging and free-flowing styles), and in having various types of decoration (sometimes large and ornate) applied horizontally around the dress near the hem. Sleeves also began increasing in size, foreshadowing the styles of the 1830s. However, there was still no radical break with the Empire/Regency aesthetic. Skirts became even wider at the bottom during the 1820s, with more ornamentation and definition toward the bottom of the skirt such as tucks, pleats, ruffles, or loops of silk or fur. During the second half of the 1820s, this neoclassical aesthetic was decisively repudiated, preparing the way for the main fashion features of the next ten to fifteen years (large sleeves, somewhat strict corseting of the natural waist, full skirts, elaborate large-circumference hats, and visual emphasis on wide sloping shoulders). Rich colors such as chrome yellow and Turkey red became popular, and fabrics with large bold checkerboard or plaid patterns became fashionable,Tozer and Levitt (1983), p. 29Takeda and Spilker (2010), p. 69 (another contrast with the previous fashion period, which had favored small delicate pastel prints). A bustle was sometimes also worn. Belts accentuated the new defined waist. Dresses were often worn with a round ruffled linen collar similar to a soft Elizabethan ruff. =Hairstyles and headgear= Early in the decade, hair was parted in the center front and styled into tight curls over the temples. As the decade progressed, these curls became more elaborate and expansive. The bun on the back became a looped knot worn high on top of the head. Wide-brimmed hats and hat-like bonnets with masses of feathers and ribbon trims were worn by mid-decade. Conservative married or older women wore indoor caps of fine linen descended from the earlier mob cap; these had a pleated or gathered caul on the back to cover the hair, and a narrow brim at the front that widened to cover the ears and often tied under the chin. These caps were worn under bonnets for street-wear. Women also began to wear caps known as a cornette around 1816. These caps were tied under the chin and worn indoors. They also tended to be greatly adorned with plumes, ribbons, flowers, and jewels. Another alternative to the cornette was the turban, also often bejeweled and adorned, which shows the great interest in exotic cultures. =Outerwear= Shawls remained popular. Cloaks and full-length coats were worn in cold or wet weather. =Shoes= The fashionable shoe was a flat slipper. In the late 1820s, the first high shoe appeared and became vogue for both men and women. The shoe typically consisted of a three-inch high cloth top that laced on the inner side and a leather vamp that supported a long, narrow, and squared toe. =Style gallery 1820‚Äì25= Image:Ingres Mademoiselle Jeanne Suzanne Catherine Gonin.jpg1 ‚Äì 1821 Image:Collettte versavel 1822.jpg2 ‚Äì 1822 Image:Francesco Hayez 032.jpg3 ‚Äì 1823 Image:1823-Ball-Gown-Diaphanous-Overskirt.jpg4 ‚Äì 1823 Image:1824 laver coral.jpg5 ‚Äì 1824 Image:Marchesa Marianna Florenzi, by Heinrich Maria von Hess, 1824.jpg6 ‚Äì 1824 File:Leybold Portrait of a Young Lady 1824.jpg7 - 1824 Image:Berry, Marie-Caroline duchesse de - 1.jpg8 ‚Äì 1825 #Mademoiselle Gonin wears a dark dress with small puffed sleeves, with a ruffled collar and a blue plaid ribbon at the neck.

His sleeves have puffs at the shoulder and taper to the wrist. He wears light brown trousers, 1828. =Overview= By the mid-1820s, men's fashion plates show a shapely ideal silhouette with broad shoulders emphasized with puffs at the sleevehead, a narrow waist, and very curvy hips. A corset was required to achieve the tiny waistline shown in fashion plates. Already de rigueur in the wardrobes of military officers, men of all middle and upper classes began wearing them, out of the necessity to fit in with the fashionable gentry. Usually referred to as \\"girdles\\", \\"belts\\" or \\"vests\\" (as \\"corsets\\" and \\"stays\\" were considered feminine terms) they were used to cinch the waist to sometimes tiny proportions, although sometimes they were simply whalebone-stiffened waistcoats with lacing in the back. Many contemporary cartoonists of the time poked fun at the repressed nature of the tightlaced gentlemen, although the style grew in popularity nonetheless. This was the case especially amidst middle-class men, who often used their wardrobe to promote themselves, at least in their minds, to a higher class ‚Äî hence the dandy was born. The emergence of wool as a primary fabric choice for men's outer garments led to a revolution in tailoring that allowed fit and finish to be of the utmost importance as opposed to ornamentation. This revolution allowed for an idealized classical silhouette to be materialized in men's fashion. =Shirts and cravats= Shirts of linen or cotton featured tall standing collars and were worn with wide cravats tied in a soft bow. =Coats and waistcoats= Around 1820, coats began to be made in an entirely new way. The tails and lapels were cut separately and subsequently attached to the coat. This ensured a better fit, a greater following of the body's contours, and more consistent positioning, even when the coat was unbuttoned. The tails themselves were narrow, pointed, and fell just below the knee. The shoulders were broad and the coat stood of the chest, yet was snug at the waist. Coats also were padded at the chest and waist. The collars and lapels were also padded in order to stiffen them. The collars were high and shawl-like in order to frame the face. Coats were cut straight across the waist. Waistcoats were buttoned high on the chest. Cutaway coats were worn as in the previous period for formal daywear, but the skirts might almost meet at the front waist. Frock coats had the same nipped-in waist and full skirts. Very fashionable sleeves were gathered or pleated into a slightly puffed \\"leg of mutton\\" shape. Coats could be made of wool or velvet, and jewel colors like bottle green and midnight blue were high style. Double-breasted coats were very much in fashion throughout the decade. =Trousers and breeches= Trousers underwent a notable change in the 1820s. The new fit was a product of the French Revolution as it was considered uncouth to wear attire that looked wealthy. The length of the pant changed from below the knee to below the ankle and the fit of the pant loosened slightly from the first decade of the 19th century. The pants featured a small waistline and flared out slightly at the hip with small pleats, creating the image of fullness in the hip region. The introduction of straps that went under the foot, known as stirrup pants, also changed the shape and fit of these trousers.B. Payne, \\"Men's Wear in the Nineteenth Century\\", History of Costume: From the Ancient Egyptians to the Twentieth Century (1965) Full-length light-colored trousers were worn for day; these were cut full through the hips and thighs, tapering to the ankles. They were held smoothly in place by straps fastened under the square-toed shoes. Dark trousers were worn for evening wear, and breeches were worn for formal functions at the British court (as they would be throughout the century). Breeches were also worn for horseback riding and other country pursuits, especially in Britain, with tall fitted boots. =Hats and hairstyles= Tall, silk hats again came into style. They were seen as a comfortable and light way to protect against sun and rain and were adequate for travelling and hunting. The crowns of tall hats also became curvy in keeping with the new style, and began to flare from the headband to the top. Curled hair and sideburns were fashionable. =Shoes= Rubber was introduced to Europe and America and created a shift in shoes from the pattens and clogs to the galosh. The galosh was soft and gummy in warm weather and hard and stiff in the cold. The style of men's shoes closely mirrored that of women's, as they were narrow, heelless slippers with low-cut vamps. They were very flimsy looking, as though they were held on by suction cups, for the leather barely covered the toes and hardly gripped the heel.Kemper, Rachel H: \\"Costume\\", 1992, pp. 121 =Style gallery= Image:GSJamesMonroe.jpg1 ‚Äì 1820‚Äì22 Image:Richard Dighton aviewontheroyalexchange.jpg2 ‚Äì 1823 Image:Fashion Plate Manteau 1823.jpg3 ‚Äì 1823 Image:Francesco Hayez 043.jpg4 ‚Äì 1825 Image:Vicente L√≥pez Porta√±a - el pintor Francisco de Goya.jpg5 ‚Äì 1826 Image:Eug√®ne Delacroix - Louis-Auguste Schwiter.jpg6 ‚Äì 1827 Image:Kiprensky Pushkin.jpg7 - 1827 Image:Goethe (Stieler 1828).jpg8 ‚Äì 1828 Image:Ferdinand-Georg-Waldm√ºller-1828.jpg9 ‚Äì 1828 #President James Monroe wears a high shirt collar and white cravat tied in a wide bow.

He often portrayed hard-ball businessmen.  Early career (1964‚Äì1976)  Beck grew up in Chicago. His childhood ambition was to become a veterinarian. However, following his performance in a school play at the age of sixteen, which he had been asked to take part in as a means of overcoming profound shyness, his tutors encouraged him to try to get into drama school. He moved to California in 1962 at the age of nineteen and made his living by appearing in television commercials. In 1963/1964, he attended Joliet Junior College and was in an acting class. A year later, he made his first television appearance as an actor in his own right in a 1965 episode of I Dream of Jeannie (entitled 'Russian Roulette') at the age of 21. Beck had a regular supporting role as Ketcham in the weekly series Nichols (also known as James Garner as Nichols) which ran for one season on NBC from 1971 to 1972. His numerous credits as a supporting actor over the years include guest slots in series such as Death Valley Days, Diagnosis: Murder, Dan August, Baywatch (Beck was a good friend of Baywatch star David Hasselhoff during the 1980s), Tales from the Crypt, Bonanza, Gunsmoke, Mod Squad, Mission: Impossible, Hawaii Five-O and Matlock. Already a household name in the United States by this point, Beck first came to the attention of international audiences in 1973 when he played an underground leader named Erno who leads a revolt against a fascist government in the Woody Allen sci-fi comedy Sleeper. The same year, he appeared as John W. Poe in the Sam Peckinpah western Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid, and in 1975, he appeared opposite James Caan as Moonpie in the original Rollerball.  Commercial peak (1977‚Äì1986)  In the film The Other Side of Midnight in 1977, Beck played the male lead. A year later, Beck starred in an adaptation of H.G. Wells's The Time Machine (with future Three's Company actress Priscilla Barnes), and appeared in the TV miniseries Wheels. He appeared as Dorian Blake in 1985's Peyton Place: The Next Generation, a proposed revival of 1960s' Peyton Place. After 15 years of being cast in supporting roles and bit-parts in various American drama and comedy series and low-budget films, he landed his first major starring role playing Sam Curtis in the early 1980s television series Flamingo Road, followed by the role of Mark Graison on Dallas from 1983 to 1986. Although his character was killed off in 1984, he later returned after having faked his death to seek an alternative cure for a disease from which he was suffering. However, in 1986, former star Patrick Duffy was asked to return to Dallas. To accommodate this, the producers made the entire 1985‚Äì1986 season a dream of character Pamela Ewing. As a result, Beck's character was written out of the show as if he had never returned from the dead.  Later work (1989‚Äì2009)  Over 1991 and 1992, Beck had a leading role on Santa Barbara, playing David Raymond in over 100 episodes. He returned to this genre in 2001, with a recurring role in Passions. Beck took a brief turn at voice acting, providing the voice of the Punisher in three episodes of Spider-Man: The Animated Series. Beck also guest-starred as the character Raymond Boone in the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine extended episode \\"Tribunal\\" in 1994. A year later, he appeared in the film Black Day Blue Night. After his third appearance on the Walker: Texas Ranger series in 1997, Beck began to wind down his acting schedule due to \\"exhaustion\\". In 2009, he retired from acting. Personal life Beck was born in Chicago and raised in nearby Joliet, Illinois. He married Tina Carter on April 24, 1971. The couple have four children. Beck was a proficient boxer in the 1970, winning several amateur titles, most notably the heavyweight Golden Gloves of Chicago in 1973. Also a one-time champion roller-skater, he performed many of his own stunts in the film Rollerball without the need for a stunt double.

His significance is mainly that one of his letters home to family in England is extant. Biography Nothing is known of Abraham Jennison's early life, but in July 1848 he was 44 years old, married with ten children, and working as a blacksmith. In that month, he and two companions were convicted of stealing items including a gun and a pig, and Jennison was sentenced to seven years' transportation. He arrived in Western Australia on board the Pyrenees in June 1851, and was immediately issued with a ticket of leave. He received a conditional pardon in December 1854. Thereafter, he worked for a number of years at Tibradden, John Sydney Davis' Champion Bay station. In November 1861, Jennison received letters from his children telling him that his wife Hannah had died, and enquiring about joining him in Australia. Jennison's reply, in which he stated that \\"A person can do very well if he is a mind to work\\", was kept by his family for generations, and is extant today. Jennison's family did not emigrate to Australia and this letter is apparently the last letter that he wrote to his children. Nothing is known of Jennison's later life.

The mall's anchor stores are Dunham's Sports, and Dave's Furniture.  History  Holly Hill Mall opened in 1969, in reference to the nearby neighborhood where it was located. At the time, the mall's anchor stores included J. C. Penney, Belk, Sears, and Woolworth, which eventually became Goody's. It also featured an Aladdin‚Äôs Castle arcade where many local youths Dance Danced their Revolution. Its name was changed to Colonial Mall Burlington in 1999 after being bought out by Colonial Properties Trust. A major renovation of the mall's interior and exterior took place in 2004, adding skylights, new floor tiles, and new stores such as Hibbett Sports. Colonial sold the mall in 2005 to Prime Retail, at which point the mall's name was changed to Burlington Square Mall. In 2007, Alamance Crossing, a lifestyle center complex opened less than two miles away. Both Belk and J. C. Penney left for the new mall, along with a number of smaller retailers. On July 8, 2008, it was announced that the mall was in foreclosure proceedings. The current owners purchased Holly Hill Mall from the bank. On October 30, 2008, Goody's announced that its store would be closing all of their stores, including the one at Burlington Square Mall.http://www.fayobserver.com/article?id=308930 Books-A-Million closed afterward. Trailhead ChurchTrailhead Church of Burlington moved into what was the facility for a Gold's Gym in November 2009. Trailhead moved out of Holly Hill Mall in July 2010 after merging with Victory Worship Center in Graham, NC. Retaining the title Trailhead Church, the group now meets at 554 West Moore St. in Graham. In May 2010 the mall was purchased by a group of local investors. To go along with the theme of 'going back to its roots,' the new owners renamed the mall Holly Hill Mall & Business Center. A number of local and national businesses have signed leases since the mall was sold in 2010. Also in 2011, Hamrick's clothing store opened in the former J. C. Penney, while Dave's Discount Furniture replaced the former Goody's. In 2012, Dunham's Sports opened in the former Belk. This store is both the first in North Carolina and the largest in the chain. Hamrick's closed in 2014.http://www.thetimesnews.com/article/20140327/News/303279853 On December 4, 2019, it was announced that Sears would be closing on January 15, 2020.

Matthew Robert Cooper and Miniatures In April 2008 it was announced that Cooper would release a \\"solo album\\" under the name Matthew Robert Cooper. Writing on the Temporary Residence message boards Cooper explained the change \\"this is not far from something \\"eluvium\\" would release‚Äîbut since I began writing them‚ÄîI felt that they were somehow disconnected from eluvium‚Äîperhaps a different personality took shape‚Äîthus, the use of a different name - this work is very dear to me.\\" Miniatures was issued in 2008 on a limited vinyl release on the fledgling Portland label, Gaarden Records. The album was limited to 2,000 copies with the first 1,000 on colored vinyl.

Fleener, a major in the United States Army Reserve, has been appointed to serve as a defense lawyer in the Guantanamo military commissions. He has been appointed to serve as the defense lawyer for Ali Hamza Ahmed Sulayman al Bahlul. Career and noteworthy cases In his civilian capacity, Fleener is an attorney in his own law firm in Wyoming. A former Federal Public Defender, Fleener continues to serve in the Reserves as a Judge Advocate with the 22d Legal Support Organization, Trial Defense Service, defending soldiers accused of misconduct. He is a member of the bars of Iowa and Wyoming. Prior to becoming a Federal Public Defender, Fleener served on active duty as an Army Judge Advocate for nearly eight years in both the United States and Europe. Prior to attending college and law school in Arkansas, Fleener also served on active duty as an enlisted soldier.

Academic background Spruyt grew up in Rotterdam, and studied history, theology and law at the Utrecht University and Leiden University. He is a practising Christian of the Hersteld Hervormde Kerk denomination (Restored Reformed Church). Spruyt obtained his M.A. in Renaissance and Reformation History in 1990 from Utrecht with the highest honors. Spruyt was a graduate student at Leiden University from February 1991 through February 1994 and obtained a doctorate in February 1996 on an English-language dissertation entitled 'Cornelius Henrici Hoen (Honius) and his Epistle on the Eucharist (1525): Medieval Heresy, Erasmian Humanism, and Reform in the Early Sixteenth-Century Low Countries', which was supervised by Prof. Posthumus Meyjes (Leiden) and the late Prof. Heiko A. Oberman (Arizona). A book version of this dissertation was published in 2006 by E. J. Brill in their series 'Studies in Medieval and Reformation Traditions: History, Culture, Religion, Ideas'. Spruyt published scholarly papers in such journals as the Dutch Review of Church History, Sixteenth Century Journal, Wolfenb√ºtteler Renaissance Mitteilungen, English Historical Review, Quaerendo, and Reformatorica. He's currently an assistant professor at the Free University of Amsterdam, where he teaches ecclesiastical history. Journalist From 1994 to 2002 Spruyt worked as a journalist for the Reformatorisch Dagblad, the sixth largest Dutch daily newspaper, with a mainly Protestant readership and an explicitly Calvinist editorial line. He covered Dutch politics and the foreign desk. His last position was from 2000 to 2002 as chief political editor and commentator of the newspaper, working from The Hague. In the second half of 2006, he picked up his journalistic work again. Think tank director As one of the leading voices of intellectual conservatism, Spruyt was instrumental in founding the Edmund Burke Foundation, the Dutch conservative group, in the second half of 2000. Together with conservative activist Joshua Livestro, Spruyt became the Foundation's director when the Foundation opened up its own offices in The Hague. Livestro soon left the Foundation and Spruyt was managing director for three years. In that period, he openly sought to emulate the American conservative movement‚Äîtaking the Intercollegiate Studies Institute, the Heritage Foundation and the American Enterprise Institute as his leading examples. Under his leadership, the Foundation worked to make the legacy of such conservative politicians as Ronald Reagan relevant to the Dutch political climate. To that end, the Burke Foundation called for significant budget cuts, tax cuts (especially of income tax) including the implementation of a flat tax, health care reform, and welfare reform. The Foundation also defended the Bush administration's war on terror, argued for increased defence spending, stronger American-European links, and played a major role in the Dutch campaign against the European Constitution in June 2005. The Foundation also had a more philosophical and student-focused program. During parts of 2004 and 2005 Spruyt, among other prominent Dutch intellectuals, had to hire private security services, given the bad political climate in the Netherlands following the murder of Theo van Gogh. Politics When Dutch politician Geert Wilders started a conservative party in 2004, Spruyt supported that move, hoping that it could spur a movement inspired on the basis of American conservatism. From January through August 2006 Spruyt advised Wilders on political strategy. In August, however, he announced that he was disappointed with the development of the nascent Wilders party and would not stand as a parliamentary candidate on the Wilders slate. Spruyt believed that Wilders should have formed a broad conservative front with other politicians like Marco Pastors (of Leefbaar Rotterdam) and Joost Eerdmans (of the LPF). But Wilders did not want to cooperate, the Dutch right splintered, and Spruyt decided to end his brief political career after six months. Spruyt has since criticized Wilders for being too radical. Policy entrepreneur and freelance journalist After leaving politics, Spruyt entered a life as an independent consultant, journalist, teacher, writer and speaker. Spruyt continues to contribute widely to Dutch magazines and newspapers on a broad array of topics. In April 2006 Spruyt delivered the second Roosevelt Study Centre Lecture in Transatlantic Relations in Middelburg on the topic \\"The Defence of the West: Neoconservatism and the continuing need for new Churchills.\\" He blogs at Bart J. Spruyt Blog.Bart J. Spruyt Blog He regularly writes for such publications as HP De Tijd and Binnenlands Bestuur. In 2008, he was named the successor of Pim Fortuyn as the columnist for a prominent Dutch weekly news magazine, Elsevier. He continues to be chairman of the Edmund Burke Stichting.  Teacher  Since September 2009, Spruyt has been teaching civics and history at Wartburg College, location Guido de Br√®s in Rotterdam.

Early life Abendroth was born on 19 January 1883, at Frankfurt, the son of a bookseller. Several other members of the family were artists in diverse disciplines. After finishing his school studies at the Frankfort Gymnasium, Abendroth traveled to Munich and at the wish of his father undertook the first year of an apprenticeship as a book dealer, but he then switched to studying music at the conservatory of Munich, the M√ºnchner Konservatorium, from 1900 to 1903, studying theory and composition with Ludwig Thuille, piano with Anna Hirtzel-Langenham, and developing his conducting skills working with Felix Mottl.[ Hermann Abendroth], at AllMusic Initial career Hermann Abendroth Still an undergraduate, Hermann Abendroth's first stable assignment of conducting was from 1903 to 1904, for the Orchestral Society of Munich. From 1905 to 1911, he moved to L√ºbeck, highlighting as the Kapellmeister of the Theater L√ºbeck. From 1911 to 1914, he was the Generalmusikdirektor (General music director) of the city of Essen. From 1915 to 1934 he was the Kapellmeister of the G√ºrzenich Orchestra Cologne, and then also director of the Cologne Conservatory (1925‚Äì1934), which was reformed with his help, to become the Cologne Musikhochschule. He also became the general music director of Cologne in 1918, and was a professor in 1919. He also was the general music director of Bonn, from 1930 to 1933. In 1922, Abendroth was the director of the Lower Rhenish Music Festival. He was invited to conduct in other countries as well, and visited the USSR and conducted the USSR-State Symphony Orchestra in 1925, 1927 and 1928. From 1926 to 1937, he visited England and regularly conducted the London Symphony Orchestra. Abendroth is known for performing classical and romantic compositions, including Beethoven, Brahms, and Bruckner. Nonetheless, he conducted other contemporary pieces in their premieres, for instance for Bartok and Stravinsky. Nazi Germany In 1934, the Nazi Party seized the city council of Cologne, and the liberally minded Abendroth was promptly removed from the public function and detained. Nonetheless, other personalities of the arts interceded, and Abendroth was restituted into the public function, to head the department of education of the Nazi Reichsmusikkammer. Accepting such charge, Abendroth was criticized for relinquishing his ideals. Nevertheless, he formally joined the Nazi Party in 1937. In 1934, Hermann Abendroth was appointed Kapellmeister of the Gewandhausorchester Leipzig, replacing Bruno Walter, who was dismissed by the newly installed Nazi authorities because he refused the nazi dictature and of being Jewish. From 1934 to 1945, Abendroth also was professor of the Leipzig conservatory (1941-1945 Leipzig Musikhochschule). In 1943 and 1944, he took part in the traditional Bayreuth Festival, conducting Die Meistersinger, its only opera for those two years. Adolf Hitler officialized and organized the festivity. East Germany After World War II, the Communist new authorities of Saxony rescinded all Abendroth's contracts of Leipzig, and so - with his past of the Nazi Party - he wouldn't manage to get a new stable position anywhere else in Germany either. Abendroth then claimed that he had never attended any political meeting, and his fortune then would change at Thuringia, whose government appointed Abendroth for music director of Weimar from 1945 to 1956. In 1950 and 1954, Abendroth was elected the People's Chamber of the GDR for a four-year mandate ending in 1954 as a representative of the Cultural Association of the GDR. Such opportunity would help cleansing Abendroth's name, about his Nazi past, and so he returned to Leipzig, in charge of its Radio Symphony Orchestra, from 1949 to 1956. As Abendroth, a heavy smoker, was becoming a prominent artist of East Germany, he was the only person allowed to smoke within the building of the radio station of Leipzig, by the Communist authorities. Abendroth toured throughout the Communist Europe. He was the first German, invited to conduct in the Soviet Union after the war-, and also toured Finland and Switzerland. In 1951, he conducted for the Prague Spring International Music Festival. From 1953 to 1956 he conducted Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra (East Berlin). Ironically, such new celebrity status of Abendroth awoke suspicion about his new political affinity, and some locations of West Germany banned his presentations -such as in D√ºsseldorf- and the release of Abendroth's records on the Eterna label was quite limited in Western Europe. Death Hermann Abendroth died of a stroke, during a surgical procedure, in Jena, on 29 May 1956. A state funeral was then granted for him. Records Abendroth was amongst the first German music directors who released studio records regularly. His production spanned from mid-1920s, until his death. Nowadays, Abendroth is being successfully rediscovered by a collection of CDs, published since mid-1990s, consisting mainly of his works for the Radio Symphony Orchestra of Leipzig of since 1953.

He played in Major League Baseball in 2005 for the Pittsburgh Pirates. Sadler bats and throws right-handed, is tall, and weighs . His cousin Donnie Sadler, has also played Major League Baseball. Professional career Sadler played baseball at Clifton High School, and in 1999 the Chicago Cubs selected him with the 920th pick of the June draft, as part of the 30th round. The Cubs did so with the intention of treating him as a \\"draft and follow\\" player, and he signed with the Cubs after 2 seasons at Hill College, a junior college in Hillsboro, Texas. Sadler was traded from the Cubs to the Pittsburgh Pirates on August 17, 2003, in a deadline deal for Randall Simon. When outfielder Craig Wilson injured a tendon in his hand on May 8, 2005, the Pirates turned to Sadler as an emergency replacement, purchasing his contract from the Altoona Curve. He had no time to prepare, but reported immediately to the Pirates' clubhouse, where he was mistaken for a construction worker by surprised manager Lloyd McClendon. Sadler made his major league debut that night, and three days later, he collected his first major league hit: a home run to left field against Giants starter Noah Lowry. After playing three games in left field, Sadler was optioned back down to the minors on May 13, and he was designated for assignment on September 16. This was the first outright assignment of Sadler's career, so he remained with the Pirates organization after clearing waivers. After the 2006 season, Sadler was acquired by the Houston Astros organization. He played the entire 2007 season as a member of the Corpus Christi Hooks, Houston's AA affiliate, leading the team in home runs and runs batted in while earning Team MVP honors.

The style of the plan was Defence Scheme No. 1. What is much less well known are Brown's substantial contributions in the area of planning and logistics during his service as a senior staff officer in the Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF) on the Western Front during the First World War.  Family background and education  Brown was born in Simcoe, Ontario, the eldest son among four children.Atholl Sutherland Brown. Buster: A Canadian Patriot and Imperialist. Victoria, BC: Trafford Publishing, 2004. His father, Frank August Brown, was a successful merchant in agricultural products who had close trading ties with the United States, was active in municipal politics and generally supported the reform policies of the Liberal Party. His grandfather, William Brown, had emigrated to Canada from Northamptonshire in 1842. James, however, became an outspoken Tory supporter of Canada's role within the British Empire and had a deep mistrust of the influence and intentions of the United States towards Canada. In 1895 at the age of 14, Brown joined the 39th Norfolk Rifles, a local militia regiment, as a boy bugler. When the Anglo-Boer War started in 1899 he was a corporal and wished to join the Canadian Contingent in South Africa, but was persuaded to complete his education as a teacher. He continued his service in the militia after he had begun his career as a teacher, and by February 1901 was gazetted a lieutenant. As a result of further courses as well as training at Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Brown qualified as a Permanent Force Officer. In June 1906 he was gazetted as a lieutenant in The Royal Canadian Regiment (The RCR) in the Permanent Force. James Sutherland Brown and Clare Temple Brown (n√©e Corsan) had three sons. Lieutenant Colonel Malcolm C. Sutherland-Brown graduated from the Royal Military College of Canada in 1934 and served in the Royal Canadian Engineers overseas. Athol Sutherland-Brown, who was in the Royal Canadian Air Force, wrote ‚ÄòBuster Buster: A Canadian Patriot and Imperialist‚Äô. Victoria, BC: Trafford Publishing, 2004. A third son Flying Officer Ian Mcdonnell Sutherland-Brown (RMC 1937) graduated from Royal Military College of Canada and was Killed In Action at 21 years of age in Royal Canadian Air Force on August 14, 1941. Ian Sutherland-Brown is commemorated on Page 24 of the Second World War Book of Remembrance.http://www.vac- acc.gc.ca/remembers/sub.cfm?source=collections/virtualmem/Results Flying Officer Ian Mcdonnell Sutherland-Brown  Service during the First World War  When the British Empire declared war on the Central Powers on August 4, 1914, Brown was a captain in The RCR attending the Staff College in Camberley, England. Twenty days later, he was ordered back to Canada to assist in the massive logistical challenge of organizing, supplying and then transporting to England the 1st Canadian Division of the newly created CEF. On September 25 he was appointed to be Deputy Assistant and Quarter Master General of the Division. The First Contingent of the CEF, comprising over 31,500 men and officers along with guns, vehicles and over 7600 horses, embarked on September 26 for England in a convoy comprising 28 ocean liners that had been located and retained largely by Brown. Brown served with distinction as a logistics staff officer in the CEF for the duration of the First World War, reaching the rank of Temporary Lieutenant Colonel in May 1916 in The RCR. While attached to the 1st Canadian Division he participated in most of the major Canadian military operations on the Western Front, including the Second Battle of Ypres, the Battle of the Somme, the Battle of Vimy Ridge, Third Battle of Ypres, and the Hundred Days Offensive that ultimately ended the First World War. Serious illness required him to withdraw to England for recuperation during the later half of 1916 and the first months of 1917. His military service continued during the Allied occupation of Germany after the Armistice was signed in November 1918. As a result of his service he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (14 January 1916), was mentioned in dispatches five times (1 January 1916, 28 May 1917, 18 May 1918, 31 December 1918 and 11 July 1919) and was made a Companion of Order of St Michael and St George (6 March 1918).  Director of Military Operations and Intelligence  After the war, as a lieutenant-colonel, Brown remained a professional officer in the greatly shrunken Canadian Army. In 1920 he was appointed Director of Military Operations and Intelligence in Ottawa. In this capacity he was responsible for developing a series of contingency war plans for a variety of possible scenarios. One of those scenarios was the possibility that hostilities might break out between the United States and the British Empire. It was as part of this work that Defence Scheme No. 1 was developed. The plan adopted the strategy that, even in a position of much smaller size versus an adversary, it was best to seize the initiative in order to buy time. A number of armed thrusts across the border to seize strategic cities, followed by a staged withdrawal were envisaged. In the Canadian context it was assumed that the British Empire would rally to the defense of its North American dominion, but that this mobilization would likely require some time to become effective. It then followed that the Canadian Army must do its best to buy time.There are similarities between this strategy and the strategy that the Boer Republics adopted in their struggle against the British Empire in South Africa. In the case of the Anglo-Boer War, however, no European power chose to intervene in support of the Boers, and they were ultimately overwhelmed by the much larger Empire forces once these were greatly reinforced and brought to bear competently on the Boers. The Boers were eventually defeated in 1902 despite their initially successful thrusts into British territory at Mafeking, Kimberley and Ladysmith in the fall of 1899. Defence Scheme No. 1 is actually very close to an earlier plan that Brown developed as part of a planning exercise in 1913. Defence Scheme No. 1 was abandoned in 1928 by Chief of the General Staff General Andrew McNaughton and most records of it were destroyed. When the existence of the plan was disclosed publicly in the early 1960s, the plan and its author were the subject of considerable ridicule. It is the function of all military planners to consider all possible contingencies, and that the planning process itself serves a useful training function for those involved. Also, the plan was developed at a time when a group of officers, including Sutherland Brown, were lobbying the government for a much larger Permanent Force. The plan may have assumed much larger available forces. However, the political realities in Canada in the early 1920s dashed any possibility of a Canadian army that would be sufficiently large and well equipped to have any realistic hope of succeeding in any surprise pre-emptive assault across the border, no matter how well planned and executed. Brown, as a strong supporter of both Canada and British Empire and as somebody who mistrusted the intentions of the United States, evidently took the plan quite seriously, to the point where he and several of his subordinates risked a diplomatic incident by carrying out reconnaissance trips across the border into New York State and Vermont wearing civilian clothing. Two years after the Canadian plan was rejected, the United States developed War Plan Red, which described an invasion of Canada.  Service as DOC in British Columbia  In July 1928, Brown was made a Temporary Brigadier on the General List. At the start of the next year he took up his final position, that of District Officer Commanding, Military District No. 11. This large district covered the province of British Columbia, including the Pacific coastal defense system, and the Yukon Territory. Brown's talents in logistics were applied again in the early 1930s during the Depression, when he was active in setting up and expanding an army-sponsored work camp system for unemployed men in British Columbia. He became increasingly critical of the federal government's response to the plight of the large numbers of unemployed men in British Columbia, whose resource-based economy was especially badly affected by the economic bad times. While Brown was very critical of socialism and organized labor movements, he strongly felt that the authorities in charge had an obligation to provide basic services, including modest cash wages, to the unemployed in a way that matched the seriousness of the situation in the short term while avoiding dependence in the longer term.  Retirement and service as Aide-de- Camp  Brown retired in Victoria in June 1936 following years of escalating tensions with the national military command in Ottawa, most notably with McNaughton, his First World War colleague and former friend.McNaughton, although widely respected for his intelligence and engineering expertise, had difficult relations with both his subordinates and superiors. Tensions with his British Army superiors and, ultimately, with Canadian Minister of Defence James Ralston, led to his resignation as commander of the Canadian Army overseas in 1943. McNaughton's career quickly recovered, however, when Ralston lost a cabinet battle with Prime Minister Mackenzie King over the issue of conscription. After pro-conscription Ralston resigned in November 1944 he was replaced as Minister of Defence by Gen. McNaughton, whose support for purely volunteer armed forces aligned with the Prime Minister's views. A formal written offer to serve his country after the outbreak of the Second World War was declined. In his retirement, Sutherland Brown enjoyed warm relations with the local military establishment and with other veterans of the CEF and, especially, veterans of the RCR. In 1937, he was appointed Senior Aide-de-Camp to the Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia, and served in that position for three successive representatives of King George VI in British Columbia. An outspoken Conservative, Sutherland Brown secured the nomination of the National Government (Conservative Party) ticket for the riding of Victoria in the federal general election of 1940, but he failed to unseat the popular Liberal Party incumbent Robert Wellington Mayhew. Brig. Sutherland Brown died peacefully in Victoria on April 14, 1951, and was buried there with full military honours.

History Originally named Bovianum, it was settled by the 7th century BC. As the capital of the Pentri, a tribe of the Samnites, it played a major role in the Samnite Wars, as well as in the Social War, when it was a temporary capital (89 BC). It was sacked by Sulla. It was colonized under both the triumvirates, and by Vespasian, who settled veterans of Legio XI Claudia (whence the name Bovianum Undecumanorum, to distinguish it from Bovianum Vetus), and remained an important centre into late antiquity. After the Lombard conquest, the deserted area was given to a group of Bulgars, who circa 662 fled from the Avars and sought refuge with the Lombards. Bojano became a seat of a gastaldate. The Bulgars also settled in nearby Sepino and Isernia. Paul the Deacon in his Historia Langobardorum writing after the year 787 says that in his time Bulgars still inhabited the area, and that even though they speak \\"Latin\\", \\"they have not forsaken the use of their own tongue\\". In later times they had evidently become completely assimilated. After two centuries marked by Saracen attacks, in the mid-11th century Bojano was conquered by the Hauteville Normans, becoming a fief of Raoul de Moulins, a companion to Robert Guiscard. The city became a county capital. The city was destroyed by a long series of earthquakes, the last occurring in 1913. Main sights The remains of Cyclopean walls can be seen on the heights above the modern town. Other attractions include: *The Cathedral of St. Bartholomew (11th century), several times damaged by earthquakes. The apse is still in Norman style. *The church of Sts. Erasmus and Marinus, with a noteworthy Gothic portal. *The Hermitage of St. Egidius, on a mountain in the neighbourhood. *The remains of the Norman Castle.

Peter is currently residing in Perth.  Claremont, West Coast and North Melbourne  Mann was drafted from Claremont Football Club in the West Australian Football League to the West Coast Eagles as a pre-draft priority selection in the 1989 VFL Draft after playing 22 senior games in his debut season for Claremont, including their WAFL Grand Final winning side. He remained on the Eagle's list for just the 1990 season, but did not make his AFL debut. He was then traded to North Melbourne prior to the 1990 AFL Draft, in return for the 9th selection, which the Eagles used to draft Matt Clape. Playing mainly at centre half back, he played 39 games for the Kangaroos between 1991 and 1994, kicking 12 goals.  Fremantle  With the entry of the second WA team in 1995 he was lured home to join many of his ex-Claremont teammates at the Fremantle Dockers. Peter Mann played the centre half forward position for most of the 1995 season. His achievements in that season, 22 games, 33 goals, 159 marks and the Club Champion Award was especially noteworthy. He was the main forward marking target with limited support from John Hutton (13 games, 27 goals), Craig Burrows (19 games, 23 goals), Todd Ridley (18 games, 15 goals), Chris Groom (7 games, 18 goals) Nor did Fremantle's chip and draw style often allow for swift, direct delivery into the forward area. Mann was again productive, if inaccurate, on the Fremantle forward line in 1996, 18 games delivered 25.27 and 98 marks. The introduction of Kingsley Hunter as full forward provided an alternative marking target. His fourth in the Club Champion Award was a credible achievement given a torn foot tendon prevented him training between games.  Captaincy  Peter Mann was appointed captain of Fremantle when Ben Allan resigned the captaincy in March 1997 due to a chronic knee injury. In 40 games as captain, Mann never again achieved the high standards of his first two seasons, often due to a variety of injuries. With the exception of successive dominant 1997 games against the Western Bulldogs at Subiaco in round 16 (13 marks, 4 goals) and Hawthorn at Waverley in round 17 (6 marks, 3 goals), both of which earned two Brownlow medal votes. Another frustrating year followed in 1998. In a team desperate for leadership and marking forwards, Mann was again sporadic. So poor was his form by round 9 that he was dropped from the team for three weeks. His comeback match, Fremantle's 8-point victory against Carlton in round 13, was his best for the season, with 12 marks and 2 goals. By round 16, with form again wavering, Mann was shifted to defence and remained there until his season, and spell as captain, ended when he broke down in the warm-up at the MCG in round 20 against North Melbourne. Relieved of the captaincy, Mann played 7 games in 1999. His final match was Fremantle's record-breaking loss against Brisbane at the Gabba in round 20. Delisted in the major list changes at the end of Damian Drum's disastrous first season, Mann nominated for the 2000 preseason draft but was not selected. He played 77 AFL games for Fremantle, kicking 88 goals. Overall, he played 116 games.

He broadcast on New York City's 92.3 K-Rock and is a former regular guest on The Howard Stern Show. Mroszak previously worked for two radio stations in the Twin Cities, spending time as part of the 92 KQRS Morning Show. Mroszak was fired from KQRS after he faked a segment implying that Brett Favre was staying in a Minneapolis hotel with a woman other than his wife. Mroszak began his radio career as a frequent caller known as \\"Cabbie\\" on The Andy Savage Show, airing on Minneapolis' 93.7 The Edge. When Howard Stern's show came to town, Mroszak moved to the KQRS Morning Show, the highest rated morning drive show in Minneapolis.  KQRS hijinks Mroszak raised his visibility at KQRS as a street reporter who took some listeners on a tour of the city's crack cocaine market. In one attempt to be outrageous, Mroszak did a \\"remote report\\" in which he claimed to have knocked on NFL star Brett Favre's hotel room door when the NFL's Green Bay Packers were in town for a Monday night game. Mroszak claimed that he intended to offer Favre some Vicodin and a six-pack of beer, but that he instead discovered the quarterback with a naked female who was not his wife. The report ended abruptly, but the press contacted the station for further information. Mroszak was forced into hiding, but eventually admitted that the story was completely fabricated. With his credibility shattered, Mroszak was fired by KQRS and the station apologized to Favre. Mroszak was not forgotten by old friend Cane (from his 93.7 The Edge days), who brought Mroszak to 92.3 K-Rock (WXRK) New York to produce his afternoon show. Mroszak used his new job to appear on The Howard Stern Show. The Howard Stern Show On The Howard Stern Show, Mroszak would often discuss his service in the 82nd Airborne Division. He would talk about deployment during Gulf War, and events that occurred during his stint as a DJ for K-Rock radio in NYC, and many incidents in his personal life. On the March 23, 2001 show, The Howard Stern Show paid Mroszak $3,000 to confirm the details of his honorable discharge from the Army. Mroszak revealed that he and several other men had sex with the daughter of a Delta Force Sergeant Major. The interview shifted to Stern interrogating Mroszak about his involvement in a sexual situation that involved the presence of several men. Mroszak confirmed that he has engaged in homosexual sex in his youth but contends that he is not attracted to men. Mroszak fought two boxing matches during his association with The Howard Stern Show. On April 27, 2001, he fought Wack Pack member Angry Black to a five- round draw and on May 31, 2002 he was defeated by Stuttering John by unanimous decision. On September 11, 2001, Mroszak called into The Howard Stern Show; from his rooftop in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. By then the Stern Show was one of only a couple of local broadcasts still on the air. Cabbie helped explain that airplanes that people witnessed in Manhattan were United States Air Force fighters sent to patrol Manhattan airspace. He described the action of that horrific morning to the listening audience. He received numerous plaudits for his live coverage and description of the unfolding events. On the January 6, 2003 show, Mroszak had an on-air reunion with his biological mother, who claimed to have given him up as a newborn for adoption because she could not afford to raise him. On July 27, 2006, Mroszak was released from prison after serving a one-year sentence for tax evasion, and immediately went to Sirius Satellite Radio to visit Howard Stern. On August 15, 2006, Mroszak substituted for Sirius radio host Scott Ferrall, who was on vacation. In 2001, Cabbie filmed a porno featuring Ron Jeremy. He had previously asked for Howards permission on the air. Howards reply was; \\"You want to film a porno in my studio? Yeah, I'd let you do that. I don't think Tom Chiusano [station manager at New York's K-Rock] will let it. You could do the foreplay and stuff here, and then go shoot the rest in a hotel.\\" Cabbie went ahead and shot the explicit footage with porn stars Ron Jeremy, Taylor Wane, Tabitha Stevens, Christi Lake and others. The very existence of the footage was questioned until Jeremy documented the production in his autobiography, \\"Ron Jeremy: The Hardest (Working) Man in Showbiz\\" Ron Jeremy went on the show in 2006 to promote his book. He had written about the film. When confronted by Stern and crew in 2006, Mroszak contended that he directed the film but did not directly participate, but rather played \\"a Steven Spielberg type role\\" and that the film had been destroyed. On February 8, 2007, Stern questioned whether Mroszak could ever again be trusted, while Fred described the porn antics as \\"a sign of disrespect.\\" In 2009, Jeremy confirmed that Mroszak acted in the movie. On June 28, 2007, Mroszak was fired by Sirius Satellite Radio after claiming on his website and on the Opie and Anthony radio show YouTube that he was in possession of a Howard Stern sex tape. In a 2015 interview on a podcast, Mroszak stated that he had retired from radio since he was fired from Sirius.  Tax trouble Mroszak spent one year in federal prison for tax evasion. He was arrested after saying on the November 9, 2004 Howard Stern Show that he did not file a tax return in many years and would not resume filing until the U.S. government cured his Gulf War Syndrome. An IRS employee happened to be listening and reported him. Mroszak pleaded guilty to tax evasion in federal court in December 2004, and was sentenced to one year in prison and ordered to pay his outstanding taxes. On July 29, 2005, Mroszak was imprisoned at the Federal Correctional Institution in Fort Dix, New Jersey. On February 27, 2006, it was reported on The Howard Stern Show that he was \\"recently\\" moved to Federal Medical Center (FMC) Devens in Ayer, Massachusetts. Mroszak was released from prison on July 27, 2006 and appeared on The Howard Stern Show that same day to discuss his prison experiences.

He also served in the Wisconsin State Senate and was a Union Army officer in the American Civil War. Early life and career Born in Cornish, New Hampshire, the son of Clement Chase (1776‚Äì1867) and his second wife, Olive Spalding (1790‚Äì1823), of Plainfield, New Hampshire, he was named after his maternal grandfather, Champion Spalding. He grew up in Cornish, on his father's farm, and later attended the Kimball Union Academy in Meriden, New Hampshire. He started teaching in Cornish as an adolescent during the winter and moved later in 1840 to continue his teaching in New York. In New York, he taught at the Academy in Amsterdam, New York from 1841 to 1842. By 1843 he had moved to Otsego County to be the vice principal of the West Hartwick Seminary. He resided in New York until the end of the 1840s and studied law in Buffalo. In 1848 he was admitted to the bar at Canandaigua and, in 1849, he moved to Racine, Wisconsin. Wisconsin public office In Wisconsin, Chase became involved in politics. He attended the first Republican National Convention in 1856 as part of the delegation from Wisconsin. The convention nominated John C. Fr√©mont as the Republican candidate for the presidency in the 1856 election. The same year, Chase ran for the Wisconsin State Senate and was elected to a two year term, representing Racine County. During his second year in the Senate, he served as chairman of the judiciary committee and supervised the revision of the statutes of the state. In 1859, he was elected Prosecuting Attorney for the 1st judicial district in Wisconsin. That same year, he was elected President of the Board of Education for the city of Racine. Also in 1859, Chase was appointed Brigadier General of the Wisconsin State Militia, by Governor Alexander Randall. Civil War service In 1862, with the assistance of his cousin, Salmon P.

Chases listed here are the same man He served four years in the Union Army and during this time he was on special duty in the West and Southwest. He was at the sieges of Knoxville, Mobile, and Vicksburg, and in the later part of the war he was headquartered at New Orleans for nearly two years and would receive a brevet to Lieutenant Colonel from President Andrew Johnson late in 1865, for his meritorious services in the Gulf Campaign. In January 1866 he was honorably discharged. Nebraska After mustering out of the Army in 1866, Chase moved to Omaha, in the Nebraska Territory, and resumed his law practice. He also became an investor in the incorporation of the Omaha Street Railway Co. In 1867, Nebraska would be admitted to the Union as the 37th state, and in the state's first general election, Chase was elected to a two-year term as the first Attorney General of Nebraska. In 1869, he was appointed to a six- year term as regent of the State University of Nebraska, by Governor David Butler. Chase was elected Mayor of Omaha in 1874, after losing an earlier attempt. He was re-elected in 1875 to a two-year term--this was the first term after Omaha's mayoralty was changed by statute from a one-year term to a two- year term. He was elected to two additional two-year terms in 1879 and 1883, but was impeached and removed from office in June 1884, due to drunkenness impairing his abilities. His wife Mary died to cancer in 1882 and many think this may have contributed to his ill health. Chase later launched quo warranto proceedings in 1887 stating that he had been illegally removed from office, and was unlawfully deprived of the salary of the mayor. The jury rendered a verdict in his favor which gave him some measure of closure. During his terms as Mayor it was recorded of him as having \\"favoured extensive public improvements\\" such as parks and boulevards, and direct and gravitational powered waterworks. As mayor, Colonel Chase received and officially entertained a large number of distinguished people--KalƒÅkaua, King of Hawai'i; Peter II, Emperor of Brazil; the Governor General of Canada; U.S. President and Mrs. Rutherford B. Hayes; President and Mrs. Ulysses S. Grant; Generals William Tecumseh Sherman, Philip Sheridan, George Armstrong Custer, and others. In 1871, he was elected Grand Senior Warden in the Nebraska Commandary of Knights Templar. In 1886, he was unanimously chosen president of the Nebraska State Humane Society. Champion Chase was identified as being past commander of the U.S. Grant Post of the Grand Army of the Republic and the Sons of the American Revolution. In 1891 he was an organiser of the Omaha Real Estate Owner's Association. He was selected as the chairman of the International Pan-Republic Congress on Plan and Scope in the mid 1890s. He was appointed a Collector of Customs for the Port of Omaha and held that office until his death in 1898. Family and personal life After arriving in Racine in 1849, Chase married Mary Sophronia Butterfield. Their only son, Champion Clement Chase, was born in 1860, and would eventually become a well-known newspaper publisher in Omaha. Mary Chase died of cancer in 1882, in Omaha, leaving Chase a widower. Chase died as the result of a fall on November 3, 1898, at the age of 78. He was devoted to the memories of his native town, often expressed his loyalty and love for it. He was buried alongside his wife at the Prospect Hills Cemetery in Omaha, Nebraska. Legacy Chase County, Nebraska, and the unincorporated community of Champion in Chase County, are named after him as a complimentary act on the part of the Legislature of Nebraska.

Usually credited as being the first to use a knee-sitting figure, he is known as \\"The Father of Modern Ventriloquism\\". Biography Russell was born in London, and began his career as a journalist, but from 1882 began performing his hobby of ventriloquism in public. In 1886, when he was editor of the Hackney and Kingsland Gazette, he was offered a professional engagement at London's Palace Theatre and took up his stage career permanently. His act, based on the cheeky-boy dummy \\"Coster Joe\\", broke from the prevailing format of a family of dummies, establishing a precedent for performers such as Edgar Bergen and Paul Winchell. According to The Times obituary, he changed his name because of the political flavour of \\"Parnell\\". In 1910, Russell published a book on his craft entitled Ventriloquism and Kindred Arts. His act remained popular for several decades, involving prolonged tours of Britain, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, as well as visits to the United States and Ceylon. In 1938 he appeared at the Royal Command Performance. He was active in promoting the variety show genre and was an early and leading member of the Grand Order of Water Rats. He was a founder of the Variety Artistes' Federation. In 1948 he was awarded an OBE for his long services to the profession. He continued to perform late in life, giving televised music hall performances in 1952, billed as \\"the oldest ventriloquist in the world\\". He died in Wembley, aged 95.

The famous quote from Mae West, \\"Is that a gun in your pocket or are you just excited to see me?\\" (alluding to an erection) is cited as an example of a penis joke. The \\"dick joke\\" has been described as \\"often used as a metaphor for the male-defined nature of stand-up comedy\\".Joanne R.

As a Canadian comedian Ricky Blue puts it: \\"The trick is being able to speak the unspeakable and somehow get away with it.\\" Comedian Bill Hicks satirized the popularity of dick jokes in his own act: However, due to their prurient nature, comedians who rely on explicit humor must find less controversial subject matter if they wish to expand their presence to more restrictive venues like network television and family films.

He played in college for Oregon State University and was selected by the Boston Celtics in the 1964 NBA draft. The Celtics won the NBA Championship in 1965 and 1966 with Counts on the team as Bill Russell's backup, but he was traded for the 1967 season to the Baltimore Bullets. Halfway through that season he was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers, who made it to the playoffs that year. The next three seasons Counts' Lakers made it to the NBA Finals, where they would play in and ultimately lose three years in a row. In the 1969 NBA Finals, Counts indirectly played a role in one of the most controversial coaching decisions in NBA history. In game 7, starting Laker center Wilt Chamberlain, who had never fouled out of a game, picked up his 5th foul with 6 minutes to play. A minute later, Wilt came off the floor limping and was replaced by Counts with the Lakers trailing the Celtics by nine points. The Lakers cut the deficit to one point on a shot by Counts, with coach Butch van Breda Kolff refusing to reinsert Chamberlain into the game in the final minutes even though Wilt said his knee felt good enough to play. The Lakers lost the game, 108‚Äì106, and the series, 4‚Äì3. Counts played one more season with the Lakers before being traded to the Phoenix Suns with the Lakers gaining the return of hall of famer Gail Goodrich (he started with the Lakers but went to Phoenix in the 1967 expansion draft). After several more stops around the league, including a return to the Lakers in 1973, Counts ended his career with the New Orleans Jazz in 1976.

A machine shop is a room, building, or company where machining, a form of subtractive manufacturing, is done. In a machine shop, machinists use machine tools and cutting tools to make parts, usually of metal or plastic (but sometimes of other materials such as glass or wood). A machine shop can be a small business (such as a job shop) or a portion of a factory, whether a toolroom or a production area for manufacturing. The building construction and the layout of the place and equipment vary, and are specific to the shop; for instance, the flooring in one shop may be concrete, or even compacted dirt, and another shop may have asphalt floors. A shop may be air-conditioned or not; but in other shops it may be necessary to maintain a controlled climate. Each shop has its own tools and machinery which differ from other shops in quantity, capability and focus of expertise. The parts produced can be the end product of the factory, to be sold to customers in the machine industry, the car industry, the aircraft industry, or others. It may encompass the frequent machining of customized components. In other cases, companies in those fields have their own machine shops. The production can consist of cutting, shaping, drilling, finishing, and other processes, frequently those related to metalworking. The machine tools typically include metal lathes, milling machines, machining centers, multitasking machines, drill presses, or grinding machines, many controlled with computer numerical control (CNC). Other processes, such as heat treating, electroplating, or painting of the parts before or after machining, are often done in a separate facility. A machine shop can contain some raw materials (such as bar stock for machining) and an inventory of finished parts. These items are often stored in a warehouse. The control and traceability of the materials usually depend on the company's management and the industries that are served, standard certification of the establishment, and stewardship. A machine shop can be a capital intensive business, because the purchase of equipment can require large investments. A machine shop can also be labour- intensive, especially if it is specialized in repairing machinery on a job production basis, but production machining (both batch production and mass production) is much more automated than it was before the development of CNC, programmable logic control (PLC), microcomputers, and robotics. It no longer requires masses of workers, although the jobs that remain tend to require high talent and skill. Training and experience in a machine shop can both be scarce and valuable. Methodology, such as the practice of 5S, the level of compliance over safety practices and the use of personal protective equipment by the personnel, as well as the frequency of maintenance to the machines and how stringent housekeeping is performed in a shop, may vary widely from one place to another business.  History  = Until the 19th century = The first machine shops started to appear in the 19th century when the Industrial Revolution was already long underway. Before the industrial revolution parts and tools were produced in workshops in local villages and cities on small- scale often for a local market. The first machinery that made possible the Industrial Revolution were also developed in similar workshops. The production machines in the first factories were built on site, where every part was still individually made to fit. After some time those factories started their own workshops, where parts of the existing machinery were repaired or modified. In those days textiles were the dominant industry, and these industries started to further develop their own machine tools. = 19th century = Late 19th- century machine shop Gates Iron Works, Drafting Room, 1896 Planning department bulletin, showing how the work for each man or each machine in the machine shop is mapped out in advance, 1911. Machinists and toolmakers making experimental engine parts at the Aircraft Engine Research Laboratory, 1946. Further development early in the 19th century in England, Germany and Scotland of machine tools and cheaper methods for the production of steel, such as the Bessemer steel, triggered the Second Industrial Revolution, which culminated in early factory electrification, mass production and the production line. The machine shop emerged as Burghardt called, a \\"place in which metal parts are cut to the size required and put together to form mechanical units or machines, the machines so made to be used directly or indirectly in the production of the necessities and luxuries of civilization.\\"Henry D. Burghardt (1919). Machine Tool Operation. p. 4 The rise of machine shops and their specific manufacturing and organizational problems triggered the early job shop management pioneers, whose theories became known as scientific management. One of the earliest publications in this field was Horace Lucian Arnold, who in 1896 wrote a first series of articles about \\"Modern Machine- Shop Economics.\\"Arnold, Horace L. \\"Modern Machine-Shop Economics.\\" in Engineering Magazine 11. 1896: Part I, Part II, Part III, Part IV, Part V, and Part VI This work stretched out from production technology, production methods and factory lay out to time studies, production planning, and machine shop management. A series of publications on these topics would follow. In 1899 Joshua Rose published the book Modern machine-shop practice, about the operation, construction, and principles of shop machinery, steam engines, and electrical machinery. = 20th century = In 1903 the Cyclopedia of Modern Shop Practice was published with Howard Monroe Raymond as Editor-in-Chief, and in the same year Frederick Winslow Taylor published his Shop management; a paper read before the American society of mechanical engineers. New York. Taylor had started his workmanship as a machine-shop laborer at Midvale Steel Works in 1878, and worked his way up to machine shop foreman, research director, and finally chief engineer of the works. As an independent consulting engineer one of his first major assignments was in 1898 at Bethlehem Steel was to solve an expensive machine-shop capacity problem. In 1906 Oscar E. Perrigo published the popular book Modern machine shop, construction the equipment and management of machine shops. The first part of Modern machine shop, Perrigo (1906) focussed on the physical construction of the building and presented a model machine shop. With this model machine shop, Perrigo explored the way the space in factories could be organized.Anna Vemer Andrzejewski (2008). Building Power: Architecture and Surveillance in Victorian America. p. 77 This was not uncommon in his days. Many industrial engineers, like Alexander Hamilton Church, J. Slater Lewis, Hugo Diemer etc., published plans for some new industrial complex. These works among others cumulated in the scientific management movement on which Taylor in 1911 wrote his famous The Principles of Scientific Management, a seminal text of modern organization and decision theory, with a significant part dedicated to the organization of machine shops.Frederick Winslow Taylor. Scientific Management. Routledge, 1911/1 jun. 2004; This work the term \\"machine shop\\" is mentioned 31 times during the book. The introduction of new cutting materials as high-speed steel, and better organization of the production by implementing new scientific management methods such as planning boards (see image), significantly improved machine shop productivity and efficiency of machine shops. In the course of the 20th century, these further increased with the further development of technology. In the early 20th century, the power for the machine tools was still supplied by a mechanical belt, which was powered by a central steam engine. In the course of the 20th-century electric motors took over the power supply of the machine tools. As materials and chemical substances, including cutting oil, become more sophisticated, the awareness of the impact on the environment slowly grew. In parallel to the acknowledgment of the ever-present reality of accidents and potential occupational injury, the sorting of scrap materials for recycling and the disposal of refuse evolved in an area related to the environment, safety, and health. In regulated machine shops this would turn into a constant practice supported by what would be a discipline known as EHS (for environment, health, and safety), or of a similar name, such as HQSE that would include quality assurance. In the second part of the 20th century, automation started with numerical control (NC) automation, and computer numerical control (CNC). Digital instruments for quality control and inspection become widely available, and the utilization of lasers for precision measurements became more common for the larger shops that can afford the equipment. Further integration of information technology into machine tools lead to the beginning of computer-integrated manufacturing. Production design and production became integrated into CAD/CAM, and production control became integrated in enterprise resource planning. A trainee machinist and his supervisor work in a machine shop in 1917. Note the \\"professional\\" dress, which would likely be superseded by more practical clothing in a modern setting due to the risk of entanglement within machinery. = 21st century = The introduction of industrial robots in the second part of the 20th century further increased factory automation. Typical applications of robots include welding, painting, assembly, pick and place (such as packaging, palletizing and SMT), product inspection, and testing. As a result of this introduction the machine shop also \\"has been modernized to the extent that robotics and electronic controls have been introduced into the operation and control of machines.Rex Miller, Mark Richard Miller (2004). AudelMachine Shop Tools and Operations. p. 389 For small machine shops, though, having robots is more of an exception.  Machine shop topics  = Machines = A machine is a tool containing one or more parts that uses energy to perform an intended action. Machines are usually powered by mechanical, chemical, thermal, or electrical means, and are often motorized. Historically, a power tool also required moving parts to classify as a machine. However, the advent of electronics has led to the development of power tools without moving parts that are considered machines.The American Heritage Dictionary, Second College Edition. Houghton Mifflin Co., 1985. = Machining = Machining is any of the various processes in which a piece of raw material is cut into a desired final shape and size by a controlled material-removal process. The many processes that have this common theme, controlled material removal, are today collectively known as subtractive manufacturing, in distinction from processes of controlled material addition, which are known as additive manufacturing. Exactly what the \\"controlled\\" part of the definition implies can vary, but it almost always implies the use of machine tools (in addition to just power tools and hand tools). Though not all machine shops may have a CNC milling center, commonly, they may have access to a manual milling machine. = Machine tools = A machine tool is a machine for shaping or machining metal or other rigid materials, usually by cutting, boring, grinding, shearing, or other forms of deformation. Machine tools employ some sort of tool that does the cutting or shaping. All machine tools use some means of constraining the workpiece and provide a guided movement of the parts of the machine. Thus the relative movement between the workpiece and the cutting tool is controlled or constrained by the machine to at least some extent, rather than being entirely \\"offhand\\" or \\"freehand\\".  Cutting tools  Milling cutters of different sizes and profiles. Professional management of the inventory of cutting tools occurs mainly in larger operations. Smaller machine shops may have a more limited assortment of endmills, keyseat cutters, inserts, and other cutting tools. The choice in the sophistication of the design of the cutting tool, including material and finish, commonly depends on the job and the price of the cutting tool. In some instances, the cost of custom-made tools could be prohibitive for a small shop. Depending on the industry and demands of the job, a cutting tool may only be used on a certain type of material, that is, a cutting tool may not contact another workpiece made of different chemical composition. Not all machine shops are equipped with a mill and not all machine shops are aimed to do milling work. = Housekeeping = Some machine shops are better organized than others, and some places are kept cleaner than other establishments. In some instances, the shop is swept minutes before the end of every shift, and in other cases, there‚Äôs no schedule or routine, or the cycle for sweeping and cleaning is more relaxed. When it comes to machines, in some places the care and maintenance of the equipment are paramount, and the swarf (commonly known as chips) produced after parts have been machined, are removed daily, and then the machine is air-blown and wiped clean; while in other machine shops, the chips are left in the machines until is an absolute necessity to remove them; the second instance is not advisable.  Recycling  The remanent or residue of materials used, such as aluminum, steel, and oil, among others, can be gathered and recycled, and commonly, it may be sold. However, not all machine shops practice recycling, and not all have personnel dedicated to enforcing the habit of separating and keeping materials separated. In larger and organized operations, such responsibility may be delegated to the Health, Safety, Environment, and Quality (HSEQ) department. = Inspection = :See :Category:Metalworking measuring instruments Quality assurance, quality control and inspection, are terms commonly used interchangeably. The accuracy and precision to be attained depends on several determining factors. Since not all machines have the same level of reliability and capability to execute predictable finished results within certain tolerances, nor all manufacturing processes achieve the same range of exactness, the machine shop is then limited to its own dependability in delivering the desire outcomes. Subsequently, subject to the rigor declared by the customer, the machine shop may be required to undergo a verification and validation even prior to the issuance and acknowledgment of an order. The machine shop may have a specific area established for measuring and inspecting the parts in order to confirm compliance, while other shops only rely on the inspections performed by the machinists and fabricators. For instance, in some shops, a granite, calibrated surface plate may be shared by different departments, and in other shops, the lathes, the mills, etc, may have their own, or may not have one at all.  Calibration  A set of Imperial gauge blocks. The standards followed, the industry served, quality control, and mainly the type of practices in the machine shop, will denote the utilization of precision inspection instruments, and the accuracy of metrology employed. This means that not all machine shops implement a periodic interval for calibrating measuring devices. Not all machine shops have the same type of measuring instruments, though it is common to find micrometers, Vernier calipers, granite surface plates, among others. The frequency and precision for calibrating metrology instruments may vary and it may require hiring the services of a specialized third-party. Also, in some instances, maintaining all instruments existent in the shop calibrated may be a necessary requirement to not fall out of compliance. = Layout = The location and orientation of the machines are important. Preferably, some prior thought has been given in the positioning of the equipment; likely not as meticulously as in a plant layout study, the closeness of the machines, the types of machines, were the raw material are received and kept, as well as other factors, including ventilation, are taken in account to establish the initial layout of the machine shop. A routing diagram and daily operations may dictate the need to rearrange. Profitability is commonly a driving consideration in regards to maximizing production, and thus aligning the machines in an effective manner; however, other critical factors must be considered, such as the preventive maintenace of the equipment and safety in the workplace. For instance, allowing room for a technician to maneuver behind the machining center to inspect connections, and not placing the machine where it would block the emergency exit. = Storage rooms and tool cribs = Some shops have cages or rooms dedicated to keeping certain tools or supplies; for instance, a room may be dedicated to only welding supplies, gas tanks, etcetera; or where janitorial supplies or other consumables such as grinding disks are stored. Depending on the size of the operation, management, and controls, these areas may be restricted and locked, or these could be manned by an employee, as by a tool crib attendant; in other instances, the storage rooms or cages are accessible to all personnel. Not all shops have a tool crib or storage room(s) though, and in many cases, a large cabinet suffices. = Hand tools = Also, the way hand tools are stored and are made available to the fabricator or operators depends on how the shop functions or is managed. In many cases, common hand tools are visible in the work area and at reach for anyone. In many cases, the workers do not need to provide their own tools since the daily tools are available and provided, but in many other cases, the workers bring their own tools and toolboxes to their workplace = Safety = Safety is a consideration that needs to be observed and enforced daily and constantly; however, a shop may vary from other shops in strictness and thoroughness when it comes to the actual practice, policies implemented and overall seriousness ascertained by the personnel and management. In an effort to standardize some common guidelines, in the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) issues didactic material and enforces precautions with the goal of preventing accidents. Fire extinguishers are a common requirement in a machine shop, and need to be inspected regularly. In a machine shop usually, there are numerous practices that are known in relation to working safely with machines. Some of the common practices include: *Wear appropriate personal, protective equipment (PPE) - such as safety glasses. *Wear appropriate attire and shoes - like steel-toe shoes and short sleeves when working with machines that have a powered rotational feature such as a lathe. *Do not wear jewelry, including rings. *Do not sport unrestrained long hair. *Consult operations and service manuals of machines *Lock-out Tag-out (LOTO). *Correct use of fire extinguisher; types of fires and regular inspections. *Ergonomics. Rubber floor mats for support at the workstations. *Escape routes must be clear of obstacles and emergency exits must not be blocked. *Other. Safety precautions in a machine shop are aimed to avoid injuries and tragedies, for example, to eliminate the possibility of a worker being fatally harmed by being entangled in a lathe. Many machines have safety measurements as built-in parts of their design; for example, an operator must press two buttons which are out of the way for a press or punch to function, and thus not pinch the operator‚Äôs hands.

It has been considered one of the few electrical devices on the market that has performed independent trials to determine the effectiveness at deterring shark attacks, noting the Shark Shield Technology does not work in all situations. History The original wave-form used in the shark repelling technology was devised by three inventors, Graeme Charter, Sherman Ripley, and Norman Starkey, and released in 1995 by POD Holdings Ltd, a joint venture company partly owned by the Natal Sharks Board and the South African government. In the late 1990s the KwaZulu-Natal Sharks Board developed the first electrical shark deterrent, the SharkPOD (protective oceanic device or simply POD). In 2001, the KwaZulu-Natal Sharks Board ceased distribution of the SharkPOD. All rights to the intellectual property were licensed to a South Australian-based company, SeaChange Technology Holdings, which developed various new application patents resulting in a commercial product line under the brand name Shark Shield in April 2002. In 2007, Shark Shield introduced the third generation of products to replace the original FREEDOM4 and DIVE01, expanding the range of products offered to include the SCUBA7 (replaced the DIVE01) and introducing two new designs: the FREEDOM7 (replaced the FREEDOM4), a versatile option that can be used by a broad range of ocean-users, including scuba divers, spearfishers, boaters, and kayakers; and the SURF7, designed to be fitted onto a surfboard or stand-up paddleboard to offer surfers protection from sharks. The Shark Shield Technology was further developed by the Australian company SeaChange Technology Holdings Pty Ltd, and commercialized by its trading company Shark Shield Pty Ltd established in October 2006. SeaChange Technology Holdings Pty Ltd changed its name to Ocean Guardian Holdings Limited in 2018 with Shark Shield Pty Ltd trading as Ocean Guardian. In 2016, with research and development funding from the Western Australian government, Ocean Guardian announced the FREEDOM+ Surf a product designed in partnership with two times World Champion surfer Tom Carroll specifically designed for surfers. The new design removed the trailing antenna of the older SURF7 being replaced with a sticker-thin antenna on the underside of the surfboard, with the fully transferable power module located in the kicker of the tail pad. In January 2019 the company announced the world's first handheld electrical shark deterrent based on Shark Shield Technology called the eSPEAR. The eSPEAR is designed primarily for spearfishermen, divers and snorkelers. The Ocean Guardian product line was further expanded to include the BOAT01 to create a safe swimming area around vessels, and the FISH01 to assist ocean fishermen land their catch without being taken by sharks. On May 26, 2017 the Western Australian government implemented a $200 consumer rebate for scientifically proven electrical shark deterrents. The Ocean Guardian FREEDOM7 and FREEDOM+ Surf are the only products approved. In addition to traditional ocean sports, Ocean Guardian products are in use with various government bodies including police and navies, and were used by production members in the filming of both The Shallows and USS Indianapolis: Men of Courage. Long- distance swimmer, Diana Nyad, in her record-breaking swim crossing from Cuba to Florida without a cage, was completed with help from Shark Shield. Functionality All chondrichthyans have highly sensitive electrical receptors called the \\"ampullae of Lorenzini\\" located in their snouts. These tiny gel-filled sacs sense electric current from prey at very close distances, typically less than one meter. The jelly is highly conductive and allows the electrical potential at the opening of the pore to be transferred to the ampulla. They use these short-range sensors when feeding or searching for food. They do not use electrical receptors to track animate objects over long distances; other senses such as audition and olfaction are the primary drivers. Ocean Guardian devices create an electrical field that creates an unpleasant sensation impacting the shark's ampullae of Lorenzini. When the shark comes into the range of the field, it experiences uncontrollable muscular spasms, causing it to flee the area. The field is projected from two electrodes, which create an elliptical field that surrounds the user. Both electrodes must be immersed in the water for the field to be created. Research conducted by the South African National Space Agency in 2012 estimated the Shark Shield electrical field to be about 4‚Äì5 m in diameter. While sharks are attracted to electromagnetic pulses produced by potential prey animals, the electronic field emitted by the Shark Shield does not attract sharks to the device, so would not increase the risk of attracting sharks to the vicinity of the user. A shark's sensory organs are acutely sensitive to low-voltage gradients (> 5 nVcm), enabling them to detect very low-frequency electronic fields between 1 and 8 Hz at short range, after which the other senses (sight, chemoreception, and mechanoreception) aid the shark in capturing its prey. The range at which an electronic shark deterrent emits a field that is the equivalent of a prey-like stimulus (about 1‚Äì100 nV/cm) is much further than their short-range detection facilitates. Should a shark approach the device, the strength of the electric field gets stronger the closer it gets, and soon causes the shark extreme discomfort, forcing it to turn away. Scientific studies modelling this effect show that the output produced at a 3-m distance is far greater than that produced by prey, and drops off significantly beyond a 6-m radius, where it is beyond the short-range detection ability of a shark. Testing and research The original \\"SharkPOD\\" was tested for eight years off Dyer Island with mainly great white sharks, and was the first electronic device that was proven successful in deterring sharks when tested by Ron Taylor and Valerie Taylor in 1997 against great white sharks, tiger sharks, hammerhead sharks, and other shark species in Australia and South Africa with positive results; they made a documentary about it called \\"Shark POD\\". In 2003, C F Smit, Department of Statistics, University of Pretoria, South Africa and V Peddemors, Department of Zoology, University of Durban-Westville, South Africa (Peddemors was employed by the Natal Sharks Board at the time) researched \\"Estimating the Probability of a Shark Attack when using an Electric Repellent\\". In two series of tests of the SharkPOD, data were collected on the time needed to attack the bait, under power-off and power-on (active) conditions. Conclusions were separately drawn after completion of the first experiment (in which 8 attacks were successful in 98 five-minute active periods), and after completion of the second experiment (in which no successful attacks were recorded in 24 ten-minute active periods). In general, the probability of an attack in at most 5 minutes was reduced from about 0.70 in power-off mode to about 0.08 in power-on mode and in a period of at most 10 minutes from 0.90 to 0.16. In 2010, SafeWork South Australia, the government agency responsible for administering occupational health, safety, and welfare laws in South Australia, commissioned the South Australian Research and Development Institute to conduct a study into the effectiveness of the Shark Shield FREEDOM7 product. The research team conducted field experiments testing white shark response to both a static bait (natural prey) and a dynamically towed seal decoy at Neptune Islands, South Australia, and Seal Island, South Africa, respectively, documenting their findings in a research report titled: \\"Effects of the Shark Shield electric deterrent on the behaviour of white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias)\\". A total of 116 trials using a static bait were undertaken at the Neptune Islands, South Australia, and 189 tows were conducted using a seal decoy near Seal Island, South Africa. The proportion of baits taken during static bait trials was not affected by the deterrent. The deterrent increased the time it took to take a static bait, and the number of interactions per approach. The effect of the Shark ShieldTM was not uniform across all sharks. The number of interactions within 2 m of the deterrent decreased when it was activated. No breaches and only two surface interactions were observed during the dynamic seal decoy tows when the deterrent was activated, compared to 16 breaches and 27 surface interactions when the deterrent was not activated. Although the fine-scale positioning and presence/absence data collected to assess the potential of the device to attract white sharks was limited to one trip, our results did not suggest that sharks were attracted to the deterrent. The deterrent had an effect on the behaviour of white sharks, but did not deter or repel them in all situations. In July 2016, shark researchers from the Neuroecology Group at the University of Western Australia had published a study into the effectiveness of the Shark Shield shark deterrent on PLOS ONE \\"How Close is too Close? The Effect of a Non-Lethal Electric Shark Deterrent on White Shark Behaviour\\". The research team was funded by the Western Australian government and included UWA Oceans Institute Director Professor Shaun Collin, Associate Professor Nathan Hart and Dr Ryan Kempster. Using a modified stereo-camera system, the research quantified behavioral interactions between white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) and a baited target in the presence of a commercially available, personal electric shark deterrent (Shark Shield Freedom7). The stereo-camera system enabled an assessment of the behavioral responses of C.carcharias when encountering a non-lethal electric field many times stronger than what they would naturally experience. Upon their first observed encounter, all C. carcharias were repelled at a mean (¬± std. error) proximity of 131 (¬± 10.3) cm, which corresponded to a mean voltage gradient of 9.7 (¬± 0.9) V/m. With each subsequent encounter, their proximity decreased by an average of 11.6 cm, which corresponded to an increase in tolerance to the electric field by an average of 2.6 (¬± 0.5) V/m per encounter. Despite the increase in tolerance, sharks continued to be deterred from interacting for the duration of each trial in the presence of an active Shark Shield. Furthermore, the findings provide no support to the theory that electric deterrents attract sharks. The results of this study provide quantitative evidence of the effectiveness of a non-lethal electric shark deterrent, its influence on the behaviour of C.carcharias, and an accurate method for testing other shark deterrent technologies. In reviewing the 2016 University of Western Australia research, the Australian Geographic magazine published an article titled ‚ÄúGreat White Shark Deterrent almost 100 Per Cent Effective‚Äù. In 2016, in a study conducted by the Australian consumer advocacy group, Choice magazine found that Ocean Guardian (Shark Shield) was the only independently tested shark repellent to be effective. In 2018 the New South Wales state government funded research conducted by Flinders University to test the Effectiveness of five personal shark deterrents for surfers. Flinders tested five personal shark deterrents developed for surfers Ocean Guardian FREEDOM+ Surf, Rpela, SharkBanz bracelet, SharkBanz surf leash, and Chillax Wax) by comparing the percentage of baits taken, distance to the bait, number of passes, and whether a shark reaction could be observed. A total of 297 successful trials at the Neptune Islands Group Marine Park in South Australia, during which 44 different white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) interacted with the bait, making a total of 1413 passes. The effectiveness of the deterrents was variable, with the FREEDOM+ Surf affecting shark behaviour the most and reducing the percentage of bait taken from 96% (relative to the control board) to 40%. The mean distance of sharks to the board increased from 1.6 ¬± 0.1 m (control board) to 2.6 ¬± 0.1 m when the FREEDOM Surf+ was active. The other deterrents had limited or no measureable effect on white shark behaviour. Based on the power analyses, the smallest effect size that could be reliably detected was ‚àº15%, which for the first time provides information about the effect size that a deterrent study can reliably detect. Shark attacks involving Shark Shield Technology There have been three known fatalities involving Shark Shield Technology; Paul Buckland (2002), Peter Clarkson (2011) and Garry Johnson (2020). Paul Buckland was wearing the Shark POD device which was the first version of the product developed in South Africa. The coroner concluded that the device was incorrectly worn and made the following recommendation; ‚ÄúI therefore recommend, pursuant to Section 25(2) of the Coroners Act, that commercial and recreational divers, when operating in waters where there is a risk of the presence of sharks, should wear a shark repellent device of the ‚ÄòShark Pod‚Äô or ‚ÄòShark Shield‚Äô type, provided that the equipment should be used in accordance with the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions, and should be turned on for the entire duration of time in the water.‚Äù Peter Clarkson always wore a shark shield, which was confirmed by the presence of small floats from the tail of the device on the surface of water after the attack. In the coroners findings the main reference to Shark Shield Technology was: ‚ÄúMr. Clarkson always wore a Shark Shield which he attached to his belt. It is a battery operated device which can be switched on and off and is designed to repel any sharks as they approach. Mr. Rodd said that sometimes Mr. Clarkson would turn the Shark Shield off when he was on the bottom but most of the time he would switch it on when he entered the water and then switch it off again when he got to the surface. Mr. Rodd did not know whether Mr Clarkson had the Shark Shield turned on at the time of the incident that occurred on 17 February 2011.‚Äù Garry Johnson was wearing a FREEDOM7 device at the time of the incident, it is believed that the device was off at the time to reduce the risk of a shock while checking the anchor. This has not been verified as no body was recovered and the coroner inquiry has not concluded as of March 2020.

Four armed men from the terrorist groups Japanese Red Army and Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine attacked the Shell oil refinery complex on Pulau Bukom and later hijacked the ferryboat Laju and took its five crew members hostage. The crisis was resolved after the Singapore government provided the terrorists safe passage to the Middle East in exchange for the release of the hostages. Background The group behind the attack-plan originally intended to attack an Esso oil refinery at Slagentangen outside T√∏nsberg in Norway but changed their plans after Norwegian authorities raised a public terror-alarm in 1973, causing the group to retract and change their plans. Attacks on Pulau Bukom On 31 January 1974, a group of four men armed with submachine guns and explosives launched a terrorist attack on the Shell oil refinery complex located at Pulau Bukom, a small island lying to the south of mainland Singapore. Two of the terrorists were members of the Japanese Red Army (JRA) and the other two were from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). Their goal was to seek the disruption of the large oil supply from Singapore to other countries, especially South Vietnam. On 1 February 1974, a PFLP spokesman made a statement in Beirut that the attack was to serve as a warning to all monopolistic oil companies on one hand and imperialism in general on the other, especially the resulting perceived oppression of the Arabs in the Middle East. At the beginning of their operation, the terrorists' boat ran aground on a nearby coral reef. They managed to reach the shore of Pulau Bukom after convincing an unsuspecting passing boatman to tow them towards the island. As they headed towards a gate of an oil-tank installation, they fired shots at two passing vehicles but no one was injured. A sentry at a security post managed to escape and raise the alarm and set off a warning. The terrorists were able to detonate 3 of the 12 explosives which they were carrying but they only managed to cause little damage. Hijacking of Laju In their attempt to escape after their botched attack-plan was carried out, the terrorists then hijacked the ferry-boat Laju at the island's main jetty and took all of its five crew-members hostage. It soon led to a chase after the Singapore authorities were aware of the hijacking and raised the alarm and the ferry-boat was quickly surrounded by gunboats from the Singapore Navy and patrol-boats from the Marine Police at the Eastern Anchorage, just outside Marina Bay. This was followed by 7 days of intense negotiations between the Singapore government and the terrorists and during this same period of time, two of the hostages managed to escape from their captors by jumping overboard in the middle of the night and were swiftly rescued. The terrorists later agreed to release the remaining crew members in exchange for a group of so- called \\"guarantors\\" for their safe passage to the Middle East. This group of 13 consisted of four commandos from the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) and eight other local government officials and was led by S. R. Nathan, the then- Director of the Security and Intelligence Division (SID) at the Ministry of Defence. Crisis resolution and consequences On the night of 7 February, the group was transferred from Laju to the Marine Police Headquarters and then to Paya Lebar Airport, where the terrorists surrendered their weapons and freed the remaining hostages. After they had done so, the four terrorists left Singapore on 8 February at 0125 hours, accompanied by S. R. Nathan's team on a specially arranged Japan Airlines flight to Kuwait. After reaching Kuwait, the 13-men party flew back and reached Singapore on the following day. The hijackers were later accepted and flown to South Yemen. All members of the negotiating team received honours on National Day, 9 August 1974. S. R. Nathan later became the sixth President of Singapore and served for two terms from 1999 to 2011. The incident was Singapore's first encounter with international terrorism. It also directly contributed to the beginning of the establishment of full-time National Service for the country's police force in 1975, one year after the incident, referred to as Police National Service (PNS), which was aimed at, initially, raising a sizeable source of manpower for the police in the event of another terrorist incident on vital installations and the provision of protection and security for the latter against the former.

Pencer was born in Montreal, Quebec into a Jewish family. His parents met as students in Aberdeen school in Montreal and married very young. Gerald was born on April 26, 1945 at the Jewish General Hospital in Montreal. He and his family lived on a walk-up on Dolland Avenue out in Outremont. He grew up learning Judaism. When Gerald went to school he was always told he was a very good listener and was a very bright and smart student. By grade 7, he never had to study for any of his tests because he had the ability to remember and to model what he learned in class. When Gerry was separated from his best friend in Grade School they were desperate to talk to each other. Day by day, Gerry took a spoon and carved layers from the wall and eventually created a hole in the wall. It was a great success until he got caught. His father was furious and had to pay a fee to repair the wall. Let's just say, his dad never lived that one off. As a boy, Gerald Pencer was not very fit. Growing up he ate 4‚Äì5 meals a day and a bunch of snacks in between. Since he always ate that much, he was nicknamed Round Little Gerry. He hated that nickname but liked and kept the name Gerry. Gerry Pencer had a lot of perseverance. He believed it came from his mother. When his mother was 42, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. Gerry's father was very supportive with her and was always taking her places. The doctor said that she would only survive about 4‚Äì5 years. She had a long struggle and managed to survive 17 years. When Gerry was 44 he took over a business called Cott, at the time it was an unknown soft drink manufacturer. Now, it is the world's largest producer of retailer brand pop and it is worth over $1 billion. It's made a lot of people very rich. Gerry says, \\"Even if you've never heard of Cott, you have probably seen or tasted one of our products. But what Cott did was bigger than money, we grew very fast and made Coke, Coca- Cola, and Pepsi blink.\\" Gerry Pencer took Cott to its biggest high. He made it a fast selling company and helped it with its publicity and money making. Unfortunately, 8 years after Gerry took over Cott (1997), he was diagnosed with cancer. 1 year after that, Gerry died a slow death at his house with his wife Nancy Pencer, and his children. Gerry will always be remembered for his great perseverance and for what he did to make Cott what it is today. On May 23, 1997, Gerry Pencer was diagnosed with a grade 4 glioblastoma multiforme, an advanced-stage extremely aggressive cancerous brain tumour. Thereafter he and his wife Nancy became significant philanthropists of brain tumor medicine and research, including founding The Gerry & Nancy Pencer Brain Trust, which seeks to a difference in the quality of life of those with brain tumors. Gerry Pencer died in Toronto, Ontario, Canada at the age of 52. He was buried in the Holy Blossom Section of the Pardes Shalom Cemetery in Toronto, Ontario.

Handbook of British Chronology p. 241 a Lotharingian and the first Prince-bishop (appointed by the King, not the Pope). He was the first non- Englishman to hold that see and an appointee of William the Conqueror following the Harrying of the North.Williams English and the Norman Conquest p. 66 He was murdered in 1080, which led William to send an army into Northumbria to harry the region again. Career Walcher was a priest in Lotharingia from Liege and a secular clerk. He was invited by William I to fill the post of Bishop of Durham, and he was consecrated bishop in 1071 and probably enthroned on 3 April 1071.Greenway Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300: Volume 2: Monastic Cathedrals (Northern and Southern Provinces): Durham: Bishops During the first part of his term as bishop, he was on friendly terms with Waltheof earl of Northumbria, so much so that Waltheof sat with the clergy when Walcher held synods.Barlow English Church p. 152 After Waltheof rebelled and lost his earldom, Walcher was allowed to buy the earldom of Northumbria.Douglas William the Conqueror p. 240 Walcher planned to introduce monks into his cathedral chapter, and was remembered as encouraging monasticism in his diocese.Barlow English Church p. 62 Particularly, he was known as the patron of Aldwine, who attempted to re-establish monasticism at Whitby. Eventually, the group settled at Durham under Walcher's successor William de St-Calais.Douglas William the Conqueror p. 328 The medieval chronicler Symeon of Durham stated that Walcher had begun construction of monastic buildings at Durham as part of his plan to introduce monks into Durham.Snape \\"Documentary Evidence\\" Medieval Art and Architecture at Durham Cathedral p. 22 One of Walcher's councillors was Ligulf of Lumley, who was connected by birth to the old Northumbrian line and was married to the daughter of Ealdred, Earl of Bernicia.Sadler Battle for Northumbria p. 51 Ligulf's presence in the bishop's council provided a link with the local aristocracy. There was a Scottish invasion in 1079, which Walcher was unable or unwilling to deal with effectively.Barlow Feudal Kingdom of England p. 94 The Scots, under Malcolm III, were able to plunder Northumberland for about three weeks unopposed before returning to Scotland with slaves and booty.Kapelle Norman Conquest of the North p. 139 Ligulf was very critical of Walcher's conduct. A feud ensued between Ligulf and two of Walcher's henchmen, his chaplain Leobwin and his kinsman Gilbert. Gilbert attacked Ligulf's hall in the middle of the night and Ligulf and most of his household were killed. The Northumbrians were enraged at the murder of one of their leaders and there was a real threat of rebellion. In order to calm the situation Walcher agreed to travel from Durham and meet Ligulf's kinsmen at Gateshead. He travelled with at least one hundred retainers for safety.

The novel is set over a period of forty years (from the early part of the 20th century to the 1960s) in two regions of Peru: Piura, a dusty town near the coast in the north, and Peruvian Amazonia, specifically the jungle region near the Mara√±√≥n river. Background The novel was inspired by memories of the author's youth in Piura and a journey through the jungle he made in 1958. Vargas Llosa has described the novel as \\"a fusion of very different experiences\\" that had impressed him.Luis Harrs, Barbara Dohmann Into the mainstream; conversations with Latin-American writers Harper & Row, 1967, page 365 The oldest of the stories that compose the book dates back to Piura: ‚Ä≥It's a story of a brothel in Piura, which I remember vividly from when I was in fifth grade of grammar school. It was a green house ‚Äì or cabin ‚Äì in the middle of the dunes, on the outskirts of the city, right in the desert, across the river. For us children there was something fascinating about it. Of course I never dared go anywhere near it. Still it left quite an impression on me.‚Ä≥ Six years later Vargas Llosa visited the place and found out that \\"it had a very strange atmosphere‚Ä≥; ‚Ä≥It was nothing but a single huge room, where the women were, and where there was a three-man combo made up of an old blind man, playing the harp, a guitarist known as ‚Ä≤el Joven‚Ä≤ (The Young One), and a lumbering giant who looked like a catch-wrestler or a truckdriver, who played the drums and cymbals and was known as Bolas (Balls). Because they're almost mythical characters to me, I've kept their names intact in the book. So the clients used to come in there and take the women out to make love in the dunes, under the stars. It's something I've never been able to forget.\\" The author also picked up several stories during his trip through the jungle in 1958 that was used in the novel, including the story about one of the main characters, Fushia.Luis Harrs, Barbara Dohmann Into the mainstream; conversations with Latin-American writers Harper & Row, 1967, page 366 Structure The story is broken into five parts, each of which begins with an impressionistic narrative without paragraph breaks. Each part is then broken into chapters (Parts One and Three have four chapters each; Parts Two and Four, three). Each chapter is further divided into five separate narratives: 1) Bonifacia in the jungle region, 2) Fushia and Aquilino on the Mara√±√≥n, 3) Anselmo in Piura, 4) various characters involved in power struggles in the jungle, and 5) Lituma and Bonifacia in Piura. The novel concludes with a five-chapter epilogue. Vargas Llosa adds to this narrative complexity by referring to characters obliquely (\\"the lieutenant\\", \\"the native\\", etc.) and by telling the story non- chronologically (parallel narratives may be decades apart). He also creates double narratives within chapters without clear demarcation. The effect is to interweave past and present and to suggest an omnipresent and continuing corruption and brutality. Plot synopsis In the desert: During the early years of the 20th century, a mysterious stranger named Anselmo, whose origins and motives are never explained, builds a popular brothel, the Green House, in the desert on the outskirts of Piura. Antonia (Tonita) is left for dead after her adoptive parents are killed by bandits; her eyes and tongue are plucked out by vultures, but she survives and is raised by a poor villager, Juana Barra, until Anselmo abducts and keeps her in a room in a tower of the Green House as his wife. She dies giving birth to a daughter, Chunga. Outraged, the village priest, Father Garcia, leads the townspeople to burn down the Green House. Grief-stricken, Anselmo becomes a homeless drunkard, supporting himself by playing the harp in the town's bars and brothels. His daughter, Chunga, grows up in this environment and eventually builds a new Green House, where Anselmo plays his music. In the 1930s, a Piruan native, Lituma, joins the military (in a drunken burst of patriotism after the Piruan born colonel, Luis Miguel S√°nchez Cerro, becomes President of Peru through a military coup). Lituma serves in the Amazon region, where he meets his future bride, Bonifacia. They return to Piura and live together until Lituma takes part in a fatal game of Russian roulette and is sentenced to ten years in jail. While he is away, his friends rape Bonifacia, who then becomes a prostitute at the Green House. At novel's end, Lituma has returned to Piura and is living off his wife's income from prostitution. In the jungle: During the 1920s, after escaping from prison in Brazil (he had been arrested for accounting theft), Fushia flees to Peru, where he meets a poor water vendor, Aquilino. Together, they trade goods by boat to rubber and timber workers and gold prospectors. Meanwhile, an infant girl, an Aguaruna native (later named Bonifacia), is taken from her father, Jum, to be raised in a mission in Santa Mar√≠a de Nieva. (The nuns \\"civilize\\" the native girls and sell them as house servants.) Fushia is once again forced to flee because of his thieving ways, and after encountering Huambisa natives, ends up in Iquitos, where with Julio Reategui he takes part in the illegal rubber trade (it is the early 1940s and there is a renewed demand for rubber; since Peru officially is trading rubber only to the Allies, there is a thriving black market). While in Iquitos, Fushia seduces fifteen-year-old Lalita. After his role in the black market is discovered, he arranges to trade Lalita to Reategui for a boat and provisions, but Lalita escapes upriver with Fushia. They live on an island on the Santiago River deep within the jungle. Jum, after being educated by two political organizers, creates native co-ops for trading rubber, thus interrupting the system of kickbacks that has enriched Reategui. With a military force led by Reategui, Jum is caught, tortured, and publicly shorn of his hair, an emasculating act to the Aguarauna. Aided by the Huambisa, Fushia assaults native villages, stealing rubber and hides, and abducting barely pubescent girls for his concubines. He is assisted by the humiliated Jum, Aquilino, and Adrian Nieves. Lalita, tired of Fushia's abusive ways, escapes with Nieves to Santa Maria de Nieva, where they take in Bonifacia after she has been expelled from the mission for helping newly abducted native girls escape. There she meets and marries Sergeant Lituma. Nieves is eventually sent to jail. Lalita marries one of Lituma's former comrades. And Fushia, who has contracted leprosy, spends his fortune to covertly enter the leper colony at San Pablo. He lives a lonely life there, visited once a year by his aging friend Aquilino.

The term refers to a range of earthen tubes, or pots without bottoms, fitted one over another, and diminishing as they advance towards the top. The lowest is adapted to a pot, placed in a furnace, wherein the matter to be sublimed is placed. At the top is a head to retain the flowers, or condensation, which ascends. An aludel was used as a condenser in the sublimation process and thus came to signify the end-stages of transformation and the symbol of creation. Also called the Hermetic Vase, the Philosopher's Egg, and the Vase of the Philosophy.  Description  The contrivance serves to sublimate mercury (zaybak), sulfur, orpiment (zarnƒ´ _kh_ ) and the like. It is made of glass or clay (fa _kh_ _kh_ ƒÅr) and consists of two tubes (zi·∏≥·∏≥, actually hoses) fitted together. The mineral is put in the lower tube, the two tubes are fitted together with clay and the whole is put on the fire.

Gingery (; December 19, 1932 ‚Äì May 3, 2004) was an inventor, writer, and machinist, best known for his series of books on how to build machine tools. Gingery is most famous for his Build Your Own Metal Working Shop From Scrap series, which details how to build a reasonably complete machine shop at low cost, often from scrap metal and other items. The hobbyist starts by constructing a small foundry capable of melting silicon-aluminum and zinc alloys from recycled automotive parts. Then green sand castings are used to make a metal lathe. The lathe is the first machine built since it can be used to help build itself. The lathe and foundry are then used to make more complicated machine tools. The books in the series are, in the suggested sequence of construction: * The Charcoal Foundry * The Metal Lathe * The Metal Shaper * The Milling Machine * The Drill Press * The Dividing Head & Deluxe Accessories * Designing & Building The Sheet Metal Brake There is another book by Gingery, not usually counted as part of the series, entitled Building a Gas Fired Crucible Furnace, which can be substituted for that describing the charcoal foundry. The dominant themes of the series are recycling, using inexpensive and free materials, and bootstrapping the shop's capabilities. Gingery is noted for using basic methods, seldom used today, in order to make it possible for a skilled hobbyist to build the machines in the book series, usually without the aid of power tools or other expensive instruments. In addition to the Build Your Own Metal Working Shop From Scrap series, Dave Gingery and his son Vincent have published a large number of booklets on shop practices, engine construction and mechanical miscellanea. He was also a devoted amateur musician (primarily tenor banjo) and vocalist performing the music of the Great American Songbook and classic country. He told the story of practicing yodelling out in the middle of a field at his farm, before finally realizing he couldn't do it as well as he wanted.

There are two types of alligation: alligation medial, used to find the quantity of a mixture given the quantities of its ingredients, and alligation alternate, used to find the amount of each ingredient needed to make a mixture of a given quantity. Alligation medial is merely a matter of finding a weighted mean. Alligation alternate is more complicated and involves organizing the ingredients into high and low pairs which are then traded off. Two further variations on Alligation occur : Alligation Partial and Alligation Total (see John King's Arithmetic Book 1795 which includes worked examples.) The technique is not used in schools although it is used still in pharmacies for quick calculation of quantities. Examples =Alligation medial= Suppose you make a cocktail drink combination out of 1/2 Coke, 1/4 Sprite, and 1/4 orange soda. The Coke has 120 grams of sugar per liter, the Sprite has 100 grams of sugar per liter, and the orange soda has 150 grams of sugar per liter. How much sugar does the drink have? This is an example of alligation medial because you want to find the amount of sugar in the mixture given the amounts of sugar in its ingredients. The solution is just to find the weighted average by composition: :{1\\\\over2}\\\\times 120 + {1\\\\over4}\\\\times 100 + {1\\\\over4}\\\\times 150 = 122.5 grams per liter =Alligation alternate= Suppose you like 1% milk, but you have only 3% whole milk and ¬Ω% low fat milk. How much of each should you mix to make an 8-ounce cup of 1% milk? This is an example of alligation alternate because you want to find the amount of two ingredients to mix to form a mixture with a given amount of fat. Since there are only two ingredients, there is only one possible way to form a pair. The difference of 3% from the desired 1%, 2%, is assigned to the low fat milk, and the difference of ¬Ω% from the desired 1%, ¬Ω%, is assigned alternately to the whole milk. The total amount, 8 ounces, is then divided by the sum 2 + {1\\\\over2} = {5\\\\over2} to yield 16\\\\over 5, and the amounts of the two ingredients are :{16\\\\over 5}\\\\times{1\\\\over 2} = {8\\\\over 5} ounces whole milk and {16\\\\over 5}\\\\times 2 = {32\\\\over 5} ounces low fat milk. A general formula that works for both alligation \\"alternate\\" and alligation \\"medial\\" is the following: Aa + Bb = Cc. In this formula, A is the volume of ingredient A and a is its mixture coefficient (i.e. a= 3%); B is volume of ingredient B and b is its mixture coefficient; and C is the desired volume C, and c is its mixture coefficient. So in the above example we get: A(0.03) + B(0.005) = 8oz(0.01). We know B = (8oz-A), and so can easily solve for A and B to get 1.6 and 6.4oz, respectively. Using this formula you can solve for any of the 6 variables A,a,B,b,C,c, regardless of whether you're dealing with medial, alternate, etc. =Repeated Dilutions= 8 liters are drawn from a cask full of pure wine and is then filled with water. This operation is performed three more times. The ratio of the quantity of wine now left in cask to that of water is 16: 65. How much wine did the cask hold originally? This is an example of a problem that involves repeated dilutions of a given solution. https://learningpundits.com/module-view/42-mixtures-and-alligations/1-tips-on- mixtures-and-alligations/ * Let Vw be the volume of wine in the cask originally. * Let Vt be the total volume of liquid in the cask. * Let X be the percentage of wine in the cask originally. X = original volume of wine/ total volume of liquid in the cask = Vw / Vt When 8 liters are drawn out, the volume of wine is reduced by 8 X liters while the total volume of liquid remains unchanged as it is re-filled with water. Let X‚Äô be the new percentage of wine in the cask after this operation X‚Äô = (original volume of wine ‚Äì 8 X) / total volume of liquid in the cask X‚Äô = [Vw ‚Äì 8 (Vw/ Vt)] / Vt X‚Äô = X (Vt ‚Äì 8) / Vt After 4 such replacement operations, X‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô = X [(Vt ‚Äì 8)/ Vt] ^ 4 From the problem, X‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô = 16/ (16 + 65) = 16/ 81 Also, since originally the cask was full of pure wine, X = 1 [(Vt ‚Äì 8)/ Vt] ^ 4 = 16/ 81 => Vt = 24 liters References * \\"Alligation, Forerunner of Linear Programming\\", Frederick V.

Negotiations for the return of the ships were protracted, but on 16 October 1949 the Soviet Union finally returned EK-12 to the US Navy at Yokosuka, Japan. =Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, 1953‚Äì1968= Reverting to her former name, Pasco lay idle in the Pacific Reserve Fleet at Yokosuka until loaned to Japan in 1953, entering service in the Japan Maritime Self- Defense Force as . Kashi was redesignated PF-283 on 1 September 1957. The United States struck the ship from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 December 1961, and transferred her to Japan outright in 1964. Kashi was decommissioned on 30 June 1967, reclassified as an \\"auxiliary stock craft\\" (YAC), and renamed YAC-12. She was returned to US custody on 18 March 1968. =Republic of Korea Navy, 1969= The United States transferred the ship to South Korea in 1969, and the Republic of Korea Navy cannibalized her for spare parts for its other Tacoma-class patrol frigates. In April 1969, the ship was converted to a floating pier. Her final disposition is unknown.

It consisted of a reservoir to hold oil, and a means to distribute the oil onto the hog, often via grooved wheels or cylinders. Hogs seeking relief would rub up against a wheel (or cylinder) causing it to rotate and dispense oil onto their bodies. History In the late 1800s and early 1900s hog lice and hog cholera could prove devastating to livestock producers and the hog oiler was seen as one way to combat the problem. The first known patent for a hog oiler device was issued in 1902 by the U.S. Patent Office, however the era of innovation for this device was mainly the years 1913-1923. According to Goodbye Mr. Louse, a book by Robert Rauhauser, there may have been as many as 157 different patented models of hog oilers, but collectors today estimate there could have been as many as 600 manufacturers, most going unpatented. Prices for hog oilers would range anywhere from four dollars for a small model to twelve dollars and even higher for larger ones with more features. The same companies that manufactured the oilers would often sell special medicated oil to be used with the device, offering further protection. Many farmers however simply chose to use recycled oil or made their own cheaper versions. The U.S. government, while being willing to issue patents, suggested that the oilers might be less than effective, according to collector Bob Coates in Farm Collector magazine. \\"They (the government) recommended mopping or dipping (the hogs) instead\\" said Coats. Companies throughout the midwestern U.S., such as Lisle Manufacturing of Clarinda, Iowa, offered farmers and hog producers a variety of styles and sizes including fence-mounted, stand-alone, walk-through and ratchet-governed. However the most common were double-wheel models known as Colubians and Sipes. Often made of cast iron, the early hog oilers could be quite heavy, with some models weighing as much as 150 pounds. Later models from the 1920s onward would mostly be constructed of cheaper, lighter steel and sheet metal. Other known manufacturers of hog oilers included the National Oiler Company of Richmond, Indiana, Rowe Manufacturing, Galesburg, Illinois, and Starbuck Manufacturing, Illinois Implement Company, and O.H.C.Manufacturing, all of Peoria, Illinois.Encyclopedia of American farm implements and antiques by Charles H. Wendel. Krause Publications, 2004. Collectibles World War II led to a small but growing collectors market for hog oilers today. The cast iron models are considered the most desirable antiques since many originals were gathered up in war scrap iron drives and destroyed. Hog oiler collectors come from all locations and ages, some as young as 11 years old. Generally the \\"hog belt\\" of the upper midwest provides the majority of hog oiler finds today‚Äîstates such as Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Nebraska and parts of Kansas and Missouri. Prices paid by collectors can vary widely, based on size, functions, and condition of the machine. Smaller hog oilers can be purchased for sometimes thirty dollars or less, while the rarest models can have asking prices in the many thousands of dollars. A small cast iron \\"wheel\\" type hog oiler that appeared nearly unused was featured on the History Channel program Pawn Stars on August 8, 2011. It sold for $100.

The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 - 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation.

In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus.Nutrition Standards for Competitive Foods in Pennsylvania Schools for the School Nutrition Incentive, Pennsylvania Department of Education ‚Äî Division of Food and Nutrition.

In December 2009, the district administration reported that 1,514 pupils or 15% of the district's pupils received Special Education services. The district engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Instructional Support Team or Student Assistance Team. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the district seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the district or contact the Special Education Department. Students who have an Individual Education Plan (IEP) may take the PSSA-M an alternative math exam rather than the PSSA.Eleanor Chute., Modified PSSA test in math offered for 1st time, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, April 18, 2010 Some special education students may take the PASA (Pennsylvania Alternate System of Assessment), rather than the PSSA. Schools are permitted to provide accommodations to some students. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for special education services. The funds were distributed to districts based on a state policy which estimates that 16% of the district's pupils are receiving special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Special Education funding structure is through the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funds and state appropriations. IDEA funds are appropriated to the state on an annual basis and distributed through intermediate units (IUs) to school districts, while state funds are distributed directly to the districts. Total funds that are received by school districts are calculated through a formula. The Pennsylvania Department of Education oversees four appropriations used to fund students with special needs: Special Education; Approved Private Schools; Pennsylvania Chartered Schools for the Deaf and Blind; and Early Intervention. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs.Browne, Patrick., Senate Education Committee Hearing on Special Education Funding & Accountability testimony, November 1, 2011 Over identification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education.Kintisch, Baruch., Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Education Law Center, November 11, 2011 The state requires each public school district and charter school to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students.Amy Morton, Executive Deputy Secretary, Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Pennsylvania Department of Education, November 11, 2011 In 2012, the Obama Administration's US Department of Education issued a directive requiring schools include students with disabilities in extracurricular activities, including sports.

This approach permits such specialized instructional strategies as tiered assignments, curriculum compacting, flexible grouping, learning stations, independent projects and independent contracts. Students identified as gifted attending the High School have access to honors and advanced placement courses, and dual enrollment with local colleges. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist.

After the review of the information, the district was not required to implement the recommended cost savings changes. =Real estate taxes= In June 2015, Central Dauphin School Board raised property taxes rate to 14.8622 mills for the 2015-2016 school year. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. According to state tax policy, unlike other states, natural gas and oil pipelines are exempted from property taxes. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six of the ten exceptions to the Act 1 Index. Several exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate. *2014-15 - 14.6008 millsPennlive.com, Central Dauphin passes 2015-2016 budget with 1.98 percent tax hike, June 23, 2014 *2013-14 - 14.3200 mills *2012-13 - 14.3200 mills *2011-12 - 13.8600 mills *2010-11 - 13.8600 mills *2009-10 - 13.8600 mills. *2008-09 - 13.5480 mills. *2007-08 - 13.5480 mills. *2006-07 - 12.9680 mills. *2005-06 - 11.9870 mills. Rather than paying property taxes like other business owners, Pinnacle Health Hospitals pay Central Dauphin School District, Lower Paxton Township and Dauphin County $663,923 annually under the terms of a 66-month payment-in-lieu-of-taxes agreement approved by Central Dauphin School Board. Central Dauphin School District receives $412,000 annually. The property is assessed at $62.6 million, of which $55.6 million is tax exempt. If the whole property were taxed at Central Dauphin's 2014-2015 tax rate of 14.6 mills, the district would collect about $913,000 annually in property taxes. Additionally, the district is paid $62,000 per year on the non-exempt portion of the Community General property.Marijon Shearer., Central Dauphin School Board signs payment- in-lieu-of-taxes pact with Pinnacle Health, Pennlive.com, May 19, 2015 According to a report prepared by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, the total real estate taxes collected by all school districts in Pennsylvania rose from $6,474,133,936 in 1999-00 to $10,438,463,356 in 2008-09. The average yearly property tax paid by Dauphin County residents amounts to about 3.48% of their yearly income. Dauphin County is ranked 382nd of the 3143 United States counties for property taxes as a percentage of median income.Dauphin County Property Taxes 2012, Tax-rates.org, 2012 Act 1 Adjusted index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2010-2011 school year is 2.9 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six of the ten exceptions to the Act 1 Index. Several exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate.

Property tax relief In 2013, Central Dauphin School District approved 24,269 homestead properties to receive $107 each. The decline in amount was related to more residents applying for tax relief and a decline in table games tax revenues. The amount received by the district must be divided equally among all approved residences. In 2009, the Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief from gambling for the Central Dauphin School District was $111 per approved permanent primary residence. In the district, 23,303 property owners applied for the tax relief. In Dauphin County, the highest amount of tax relief in 2009, went to Harrisburg City School District at $446.Tax Relief per Homestead 2009, Pennsylvania Department of Education Report May 1, 2009 The tax relief was subtracted from the total annual school property tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. In Dauphin County, 68.71% of eligible property owners applied for property tax relief in 2009.Special Report Pennsylvania Property Tax Relief, Auditor General Office, February 23, 2010.

Extracurriculars The schools offer a variety of clubs, activities and sports. Eligibility to participate is determined by school board policies. In 2010, the school board established a task force that examined spending in extracurriculars. The committee found substantial redundancy which added to costs. Discussions included the four middle schools, which each have a varsity and junior varsity basketball team, and combining the middle-school teams from four individual schools to two combined teams/schools. By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those homeschooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs, including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools.Home- Schooled, Charter School Children Can Participate in School District Extracurricular Activities, Pennsylvania Office of the Governor Press Release, November 10, 2005 References External links * Category:Education in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania Category:1954 establishments in Pennsylvania Category:School districts established in 1954 Category:Susquehanna Valley Category:School districts in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania ","title":"Central Dauphin School District"},{"id":"3683265","text":"Freddy Demetrius \\"Fred\\" McCrary (born September 19, 1972) is a former American football fullback who played in the NFL.

The first large-scale comics convention, and one of the largest gatherings of its kind until the Comic-Con International in San Diego, California, it grew into a major trade and fan convention. It was founded by Phil Seuling, a Brooklyn, New York City, teacher, who later developed the concept of comic-book direct marketing, which led to the rise to the modern comic book store. The New York Comic Art Convention's growth in popularity coincided with the increasing media attention on comics that had been building since the mid-1960s, feeding off the then novel notions of comics being a subject worthy of serious critical study and collectibility. History Circa 1961, enterprising fans including Jerry Bails, Shel Dorf, Bernie Bubnis, and future Marvel Comics editor-in-chief Roy Thomas began following the pattern of the long-established science fiction fandom by publishing fanzines, corresponding with one another and with comic-book editors (most notably DC Comics' Julius Schwartz), and eventually arranging informal and later professional, commercial conventions.Schelly, Bill. \\"Jerry Bails' Ten Building Blocks of Fandom,\\" Alter Ego vol. 3, #25 (June 2003) pp. 5-8.

As Seuling described his convention's genesis, \\"In 1964, about a hundred people found themselves in a New York City union meeting hall, a large open room with wooden folding chairs, looking around at each other oddly, surprised, not really knowing what they were there for, a bit sheepish, waiting for whatever was going to take place to begin. ...

In 1973, Seuling persuaded Dr. Fredric Wertham, author of the industry-changing 1954 book Seduction of the Innocent, to attend what would be Wertham's only panel with an audience of comics fans. The 1974 show featured a panel on the role of women in comics, with Marie Severin, Flo Steinberg, Jean Thomas (sometime-collaborator with then-husband Roy Thomas), Linda Fite (writer of The Claws of the Cat), and fan representative Irene Vartanoff. By 1984, as his comic-book distribution business occupied more time, and as other comics conventions, most notably in San Diego and Chicago, became larger, more prominent, and more commercial- rather than fan-driven, Seuling segued the Independence Day-centered Comic Art Convention into the smaller Manhattan Con, which took place in mid-June.Grant, Steven. \\"Permanent Damage: Issue #43,\\" Comic Book Resources (July 10, 2002). Seuling died unexpectedly in August 1984, and the Comic Art Convention/Manhattan Con died with him.

The Comic Art Conventions provided the primary nexus for fans and the largely New York City-based industry during the Silver Age and the Bronze Age of comic books. As well, many of the Golden Age creators were still alive and in attendance at panels and for interviews, which helped lay the groundwork for the medium's historical scholarship. The reputation of the Convention spread throughout fandom via an annual write-up published in The Buyer's Guide to Comics Fandom by columnist Murray Bishoff. Besides reporting on convention events, Bishoff also provided fans around the country with a benchmark market report by surveying attending dealers regarding what was selling and whether prices realized were above or below those quoted in the de facto standard, The Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide. Will Eisner, creator of the Spirit in 1940, credited the 1971 Comic Art Con for his return to comics. In a 1983 interview with Seuling, he said, \\"I came back into the field because of you. I remember you calling me in New London, [Connecticut], where I was sitting there as chairman of the board of Croft Publishing Co. My secretary said, 'There's a Mr. Seuling on the phone and he's talking about a comics convention. What is that?' She said, 'I didn't know you were a cartoonist, Mr. Eisner.' 'Oh, yes,' I said, 'secretly; I'm a closet cartoonist.' I came down and was stunned at the existence of the whole world. ... That was a world that I had left, and I found it very exciting, very stimulating\\".Groth, Gary. \\"Will Eisner: Chairman of the Board\\" , The Comics Journal #267, May 2005. Eisner later elaborated about meeting underground comics creators and publishers, including Denis Kitchen 1974 program book featuring Joe Simon's original 1940 sketch of Captain America  Successors  Following Seuling's death in 1984 and continuing until 1988, Creation Entertainment continued producing large annual conventions in New York City, usually taking place over the weekend following Thanksgiving (Creation had begun hosting New York shows in 1971, and sometimes put on as many as a half-dozen New York City shows per year). From 1993‚Äì1995, promoter Fred Greenberg hosted two Great Eastern Conventions annually at venues including the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center and the New York Coliseum. Other companies, including Dynamic Forces, held New York City conventions but all were on a smaller scale than the Seuling shows. Changes in the industry, popular culture, and the resurgent city itself since the troubled 1960s and '70s made large-scale comic-book conventions difficult to hold profitably. Jonah Weiland of ComicBookResources.com also noted that \\"...dealing with the various convention unions made it difficult for most groups to get a show off the ground.\\" (Requires scroll down) In 1996, Greenberg, at a very late point, cancelled what had been advertised as a larger-than-usual Great Eastern Conventions show, which the fan press had suggested\\"Newswatch: NYC Comics Convention Cancelled, Fans Irate,\\" The Comics Journal #185 (Mar. 1996), pp. 18-19. might herald a successor to the Comic Art Con. As a substitute event, promoter Michael Carbonaro and others on the spur of the moment mounted the first Big Apple Convention in the basement of Manhattan's Church of St. Paul the Apostle.Pate, Brian \\"Mike Carbonaro Retiring From Convention Promoting with Final 2012 NYCBM Show,\\" Convention Scene (Mar. 30, 2012). These small shows nonetheless attracted many comics creators and pop-culture figures, and by 2000 the convention had moved to the Metropolitan Pavilion on West 18th Street in Manhattan, and by the mid-2000s were taking place at the Penn Plaza Pavilion at the Hotel Pennsylvania ‚Äî the same location of the original Comic Art Conventions. In 2002, the first MoCCA Art Festival, focused on alternative comics and the small press, was held at New York City‚Äôs Puck Building; it has been held annually since.

Since then, Scandinavia has been a mostly non-Catholic (Lutheran) region and the position of Nordic Catholics for many centuries after the Reformation was very difficult due to legislation outlawing Catholicism. However, the Catholic population of the Nordic countries has seen some growth in the region in recent years, particularly in Norway, in large part due to immigration and to a lesser extent conversions among the native population. History In Sweden, a patent letter of tolerance rescinded anti-Catholic laws and Catholics were once again allowed to settle and practice their religion in 1781 under Gustavus III. The Vicariate Apostolic of Sweden was founded in 1783. It was elevated to a diocese in 1953. The Norwegian Constitution of 1814 denied Jews and Catholics (particularly Jesuits) entrance in Norway. It also stated that attendance in a Lutheran church was compulsory. The ban on Catholics was lifted in 1842, and the ban on Jews was lifted in 1851. At first, there were multiple restrictions on the practice of Catholicism; only foreign citizens were allowed to practice, and after the first post- reformation parish was founded in 1843, Catholics were only allowed to celebrate Mass in this one parish. In 1845 most restrictions on non-Lutheran Christian denominations were lifted, and Catholics were now allowed to practice their religion freely and invite most religious orders to settle in the country. However, members of the Society of Jesus would not be allowed to enter Norway until 1956.

The reading of the name is contested and the man may instead have simply been called Su. The events in which Irsu (or Su) participated likely took place outside of the Nile Valley, in the Asiatic territories of Egypt's empire. Debate on Irsu's activities =In Egypt= Irsu's rise to power is closely related to the situation in Egypt proper at the end of the Nineteenth Dynasty, which saw a civil war between Amenmesse and Seti II followed by economic decline. Modern understanding of the events occurring at the time is heavily dependent on the translation of Papyrus Harris I, a task which has proven difficult. In his 1906 translation of the document James Henry Breasted writes :Hear ye that I may inform you of my benefactions which I did while I was king of the people. The land of Egypt was overthrown from without, and every man was (thrown out) of his right; they had no chief mouth for many years formerly until other times. The land of Egypt was in the hands of chiefs and of rulers of towns; one slew his neighbor, great and small. Other times having come after it, with empty years, Yarsu, a certain Syrian was with them as chief. He set the whole land tributary before him together; he united his companions and plundered their possessions. They made the gods like men, and no offerings were presented in the temples.James H. Breasted, Ancient Records of Egypt, Vol No.4,(1906), pp.198-199 This translation leaves open the possibility that Irsu acted in Egypt proper and consequently Chancellor Bay was considered a plausible candidate for this Irsu until 2000. However, an IFAO Ostracon no. 1864 found at Deir el-Medina and dated Siptah's fifth regnal year records that \\"Pharaoh, life health prosperity, has killed the great enemy, Bay\\".Pierre Grandet, \\"L'execution du chancelier Bay O. IFAO 1864,\\" BIFAO 100 (2000), pp.339-356 Because chancellor Bay died years before Irsu, he is no longer considered a plausible candidate for this historical figure. =In Egyptian territories in Canaan= In 1979 the Egyptologist Hans Goedicke produced a second translation based on a detailed grammatical analysis of the document: :The land belonging to Egypt was abandoned abroad and every man in his loyalty, he did not have a chief- spokesman [i.e. a pharaoh] for many years first until the times of others when the land belonging to Egypt was among chiefs and city-rulers ‚Äî one was killed [the pharaoh], his replacement was a dignitary of wretches [a second pharaoh]. Another of the family happened after him in the empty years [a third pharaoh], when Su, a Kharu with them, acted as chief and he made the entire land serviceable to him alone. He joined his dependant in seizing their property, when the gods were treated just like men, as one did not perform offerings inside the temples. Goedicke suggests that Irsu rose to power in Egypt's territories abroad, in Canaan, following years of neglect on behalf of the last three pharaohs of the Nineteenth Dynasty, Seti II, Siptah and Twosret. According to this translation of the document, the earliest of these pharaohs, Seti II, is responsible for not asserting his power and control over the region; the second was held in low regard; while the last, Twosret, is said to have made an alliance with Irsu who had de facto authority over the territories. The end of Irsu What happened to Irsu is made clear on the papyrus, which tells of Setnakht's rise and the end of the rebellion: :But when the gods inclined themselves to peace, to set the land (in) its right according to its accustomed manner, they established their son, who came forth from their limbs, to be Ruler, L. P. H., of every land, upon their great throne, (even) Userkhare-Setepnere-Meriamon, L. P. H., Son of Re, Setnakht- Mererre-Meriamon, L. P. H. He was Khepri-Set, when he is enraged; he set in order the entire land which had been rebellious; he slew the rebels who were in the land of Egypt; he cleansed the great throne of Egypt; he was Ruler, L. P. H., of the Two Lands, on the throne of Atum. He gave ready faces, which had been turned away. Every man knew his brother who had been walled in. He established the temples in possession of divine offerings, to offer.James H. Breasted, Ancient Records of Egypt, Vol No.4,(1906), pp.198-199 Twosret's successor Setnakhte's Elephantine steleR. Drenkhahn, Die Elephantine-Stele des Setnakht und ihr historischer Hintergrund, Wiesbaden 1980 records how he expelled these Asiatic rebels who, on their flight from Egypt, abandoned much of the gold, silver and copper which they had stolen from Egypt, and with which they had intended to hire reinforcements among the Asiatics. His pacification of Egypt is also referred to in the Great Harris Papyrus.Breasted, ¬ß 399 Setnakht's Elephantine stele is described further: His Majesty, life, prosperity, health, was like his father Seth who stretched out his arms in order to remove from Egypt those who led it astray, his strength surrounding (him) with protection.\\"Joan Shanley, God of Confusion?: An Examination of the Egyptian God Seth in New Kingdom Expressions of Royal Ideology, Section 287.

In 1756 he was promoted to ensign and was immediately active in two campaigns in the Seven Years' War. In 1757 he had relocated to the western forts and partnered with Louis-Joseph Gaultier de La V√©rendrye who was ending a three-year leasing arrangement of these forts. In 1758 - 1760, he took over the financial burden of the fur monopoly as the last of the western commanders, Louis-Joseph being his predecessor. This was a time of war and six of the eight French posts were either destroyed by Indians loyal to the English or abandoned by the Canadiens. The two main centres, Fort Dauphin and Fort La Reine, survived and had new occupants after 1760. Dejordy left the west when travel permitted in 1760 before the end of his term.

He was the director of the MIT Center for Civic Media, and Associate Professor of the Practice in Media Arts and Sciences at MIT until May 2020, and the author of the book Rewire: Digital Cosmopolitans in the Age of Connection, which won the Z√≥calo Book Prize. He is now an associate professor of public policy, communication and information at the University of Massachusetts. Education Zuckerman is a graduate of Williams College, where he received a B.A. in Philosophy in 1993. He then spent a year on a Fulbright scholarship at the University of Legon, Ghana and the National Theatre of Ghana in Accra, where he studied ethnomusicology and percussion. Career Zuckerman was one of the first staff members of Tripod.com, one of the first successful \\"dot com\\" enterprises, where he worked from 1994 to 1999. There, he was in charge of the design and the implementation of the website which, at that time, marketed content and services to recent college graduates. The business model of this website was exclusively based on advertising. After one of the website's major advertisers complained that one of their banner advertisements had appeared on a page that celebrated anal sex, Zuckerman imagined a way to associate an ad with a user‚Äôs page without putting it directly on the page. His solution was to open a new dedicated window with only the ad in it. The popup ad was born. While he claims having only written the code to open a new window, since then, he is considered as the inventor of the pop-up ad. In 2000, he founded Geekcorps and 2004, Global Voices Online. He won the MIT Technology Review \\"Technology in the Service of Humanity\\" award in 2002 for his work on Geekcorps. Zuckerman has been a senior researcher at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society, where he is also a long-time fellow. His work at the Berkman Center has included research into global media attention, as well as the co-founding of Global Voices in collaboration with Rebecca MacKinnon. For some years he was also a contributing writer for Worldchanging.com, where he served as president of the board of directors. In January 2007, he joined the inaugural Wikimedia Foundation Advisory Board. In 2008, he coined the cute cat theory of digital activism. In 2011, he was named by Foreign Policy magazine to its list of top global thinkers, in which he stated the Best idea is \\"The world isn't flat and globalization is only beginning, which means we have time to change what we're doing and get it right\\". Also in September of that year, he became the director of the MIT Center for Civic Media. Zuckerman was an Open Society Global Board member, and also sits on the board of directors of Ushahidi, Global Voices, and the Ghanaian journalism training nonprofit, PenPlusBytes. He was interviewed in the 2015 web documentary about internet privacy, Do Not Track. On July 1, 2016, Zuckerman was appointed Associate Professor of the Practice in Media Arts and Sciences at MIT. In 2019, revelations of Media Lab director Joi Ito's connections with Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender, shed light on the extent of monetary gifts from Epstein to the Media Lab and Ito's startups outside of MIT. Zuckerman resigned from his position as director of the MIT Center for Civic Media, in protest of the Media Lab's involvement with Epstein.Boston Globe article on push for Ito to resign He joined the faculty of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst in April 2020.

As well as being a competent fighter, it was also an accomplished racer, winning several air races in 1925. Avia B.21.96, nicknamed \\"Red devil\\", which flew Czechoslovak acrobatic flyer Franti≈°ek Malkovsk√Ω. He died in its cockpit after the crash in Karlovy Vary on 8 June 1930 Development The Avia BH-17, a conventional biplane which was the predecessor of the BH-21, was designed by Pavel Bene≈° and Miroslav Hajn in 1922 as a response to a Czechoslovak Defense Department requirement for a new fighter aircraft. The BH-17 was one of three biplanes amongst the five Avia designs submitted to the Defense Department, along with competing designs from the Letov Kbely and Aero companies. After an extensive review, the BH-17 was chosen and limited production initiated for evaluative purposes. Testing revealed some deficiencies in the BH-17 and a subsequent redesign in 1924 morphed the BH-17 into its final form as the BH-21, which included straightened interplane bracing and allowed for a better field of view for the pilot. A special training version, designated the BH-22, was also created. Both versions utilized Hispano-Suiza V8 engines, the BH-22 the less powerful 180 HP version, the BH-21 the 224 kW (300 hp) Hispano-Suiza 8fb , built under license by ≈†koda. The BH-21 was put into production by Avia in 1925, giving one hundred and thirty-nine aircraft for the Czechoslovak Air Force. In June 1925 it was successful in trials staged by the Belgian Air Force. One was built for Belgium by Avia, another thirty-nine were produced under license by the Belgian company, Soci√©t√© Anonyme Belge de Constructions A√©ronautiques SABCA and five by the Soci√©t√© d'Etudes G√©n√©ral d'Aviation SEGA. While in service, the BH-21 saw no combat as it was retired long before the outbreak of World War II. In spite of this, it served as an important stepping stone to the more advanced BH-33 and B-34 types. There were also two experimental variants: the BH-21J with Jupiter engine (predecessor of BH-33) and a race plane, the BH-21R, with a boosted HS-8Fb engine (298 kW/400 hp). The latter won several national air race competitions in 1925. Variants * BH-21 : Single-seat fighter aircraft. * BH-21J : One BH-21 fitted with a Bristol Jupiter radial piston engine.

Nelson. Japanese-English Character Dictionary. Page 635, 942 was a and the eighth in a class of twenty-four vessels built for the Imperial Japanese Navy following World War I. When introduced into service, these ships were the most powerful destroyers in the world. They served as first-line destroyers through the 1930s, and remained formidable weapons systems well into the Pacific War. History Construction of the advanced Fubuki-class destroyers was authorized as part of the Imperial Japanese Navy's expansion program from fiscal 1923, intended to give Japan a qualitative edge with the world's most modern ships.Fitzsimons, Illustrated Encyclopedia of 20th Century Weapons and Warfare p.1040 The Fubuki class had performance that was a quantum leap over previous destroyer designs, so much so that they were designated . The large size, powerful engines, high speed, large radius of action and unprecedented armament gave these destroyers the firepower similar to many light cruisers in other navies.Peattie & Evans, Kaigun page 221-222. Shirakumo, built at the Fujinagata Shipyards in Osaka was laid down on 27 October 1926, launched on 27 December 1927 and commissioned on 28 July 1928. Originally assigned hull designation ‚ÄúDestroyer No. 42‚Äù, she was completed as Shirakumo. Operational history On completion, Shirakumo was assigned to Destroyer Division 11 under the IJN 2nd Fleet. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, Shirakumo was assigned to patrols of the southern China coast, and participated in the Invasion of French Indochina in 1940. =World War II history= At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Shirakumo was assigned to Destroyer Division 12 of Destroyer Squadron 3 of the IJN 1st Fleet, and had deployed from Kure Naval District to the port of Samah on Hainan Island. From 4 December 1941 to the end of the year, Shirakumo covered the landings of Japanese troops in Malaya and in \\"Operation B\\" (the invasion of British Borneo). She rescued survivors from the torpedoed destroyer on 23 December. In February 1942, Shirakumo was part of the escort for the heavy cruiser during \\"Operation L\\" (the invasion of Banka and Palembang in the Netherlands East Indies. On 14 February she sank a British cable-laying ship off Singapore. Subsequently, Shirakumo was assigned to \\"Operation J\\" (the invasion of Java) and on 1 March at the Battle of Sunda Strait she assisted in the sinking of the Australian cruiser the American cruiser and the Dutch destroyer HNLMS Evertsen. On 10 March, Shirakumo was reassigned to Destroyer Division 20 of Destroyer Squadron 3 of the IJN 1st Fleet, and subsequently was involved in \\"Operation T\\" (the invasion of northern Sumatra) on 12 March and \\"Operation D\\" (the invasion of the Andaman Islands on 23 March. On 6 April during the Indian Ocean raids, Shirakumo, together with and sank the British steamships Silksworth, Autolycus, Malda and Shinkuang and the American steamship Exmoor. From 13‚Äì22 April Shirakumo returned via Singapore and Camranh Bay to Kure Naval Arsenal, for maintenance. During the Battle of Midway, Shirakumo was part of \\"Operation AL\\" - the diversionary invasion of the Aleutian islands. In July 1942, Shirakumo sailed from Amami-≈åshima to Mako Guard District, Singapore, Sabang and Mergui for a projected second Indian Ocean raid. The operation was cancelled due to the Guadalcanal campaign, and Shirakumo was ordered to Truk instead. In August, Shirakumo was used for ‚ÄúTokyo Express‚Äù high speed transport missions in the Solomon Islands. On 28 August, after having aborted a troop transport mission to Guadalcanal, Shirakumo suffered heavy damage in an attack by American dive bombers, and was left dead in the water with a direct hit to her engine room, although only two crewmen were wounded. She was towed by the destroyer , followed by the minelayer to Shortland Island, and by the tanker Koa Maru back to Truk for emergency repairs, which enabled her to limp back to Kure by 8 October.D‚ÄôAlbas. Death of a Navy: Japanese Naval Action in World War II. After repairs were completed by 1 April 1943, Shirakumo was reassigned to Destroyer Division 9 of Destroyer Squadron 1 in the IJN 5th Fleet, for patrols and escort missions off Hokkaid≈ç and the Chishima Islands. On 6 June 1943, she collided with the destroyer in heavy fog off Paramushiro, and was forced to put into Hakodate for repairs, which were not completed to the end of September, when she resumed her patrol and escort duties. On 16 March 1944, after departing Kushiro in northern Hokkaid≈ç with a troop convoy for Uruppu Island, Shirakumo was torpedoed by the US submarine east of Muroran at position .

MacKinnon took a job as Professor of Chinese History at Arizona State University. Her parents' academic research careers led her to pass most of her primary school years in Delhi, India, Hong Kong, and Beijing, China, before moving back to Arizona for middle and high school. She graduated from Tempe High in 1987. She graduated magna cum laude from Harvard University in 1991 with a B.A. in Government.

In an interview, she said that she argues in the book (among other things) that: :We cannot assume that the Internet will evolve automatically in a direction that is going to be compatible with democracy. It depends on how the technology is structured, governed, and used. Governments and corporations are working actively to shape the Internet to fit their own needs. The most insidious situations arise when both government and corporations combine their efforts to exercise power over the same people at the same time, in largely unconstrained and unaccountable ways. This is why I argue that if we the people do not wake up and fight for the protection of our own rights and interests on the Internet, we should not be surprised to wake up one day to find that they have been programmed, legislated, and sold away.

Dillon discovered in 1826‚Äì27 the fate of the La P√©rouse expedition. Early career Peter Dillon was born in Martinique, the son and namesake of an Irish immigrant. Not much is known of his early life. He claimed to have joined the Royal Navy at one point and to have served at Trafalgar. He left the Royal Navy and made his way to Calcutta as a young man, eventually becoming a trader in the South Seas. In 1813 he sailed to Fiji as third mate in the Hunter under Captain James Robson to look for sandalwood. While there, tensions between the Europeans and the Fijians escalated into violence; many people on both sides of the conflict lost their lives. Dillon recounted the events of this battle in his Narrative and Successful Result of a Voyage to the South Seas (1829). In it he describes holding out with five other people, including Charles Savage, on a rock that was later called \\"Dillon's Rock\\" while native Fijians prepared a cannibal feast at which they devoured Dillon's fallen comrades. During his time as a trader at least two ships of his were wrecked: on 9 July 1821 Phatisalam, and on 10 June 1825 .Lloyd's List ‚Ññ6052.  Discovery of La P√©rouse Wrecks  In 1826, Dillon had command of the St. Patrick and was attempting to get to Fiji when he happened upon Tikopia, one of the Santa Cruz Islands. There he found many of the inhabitants in possession of items of European manufacture such as sword guards, teacups, knives, and glass beads. He learned from the Tikopians that the items had come from two ships wrecked some years before on the neighbouring island of Vanikoro. Dillon was convinced he'd happened on the wreckage of La Boussole and L'Astrolabe, the two French frigates of the La P√©rouse expedition. The ships had disappeared in the Pacific after calling at Botany Bay in 1788, and their fate had been a mystery for nearly 40 years. Dillon sailed to Calcutta to report his discovery and garner support for an exploration of Vanikoro. The British government in India of Lord Amherst commissioned him and gave him command of the British East India Company's survey vessel . In January 1827 Dillon sailed for Vanikoro. After a long and difficult journey he reached Vanikoro in September 1827. While there he recovered items from the wrecks, including a ship's bell of French make. He also tried to learn more about the fate of the French explorers from the older inhabitants of the island. According to Dillon's account in his Narrative and Successful Result, he learned that both ships had been wrecked on the reefs during a storm, that some of the survivors had built a boat from the wreckage and sailed off in it, and that two survivors had remained on the island but had since died. Dillon eventually made his way to France, where he met Barth√©lemy de Lesseps, the only living survivor of the La P√©rouse expedition. De Lesseps had served the expedition as a Russian interpreter; he'd left the expedition in Petropavlovsk, Siberia and made his way overland back to Europe. He identified the items brought back by Dillon as items that had been carried on the French ships. In 1829 Dillon published his Narrative and Successful Result. He also received a knighthood and pension from the French government. Much of the remainder of his life was spent in a disappointing search for greater recognition for his achievements. Although generally not recalled, he was one of the character witnesses called by Sir Fitzroy Kelly in the defence of John Tawell for the poison murder of Sarah Hart in March 1845. By all accounts a passionate and complex individual, Peter Dillon by turns charmed and alienated the people he encountered. He died in Paris on 9 February 1847.

Located in the city of Logan, Utah, it was the second temple built in the Rocky Mountains, after the St. George Temple, which remains the only LDS temple that has been in operation longer than the Logan Temple. The temple in Logan was announced on October 6, 1876, with its groundbreaking taking place on May 18, 1877. The groundbreaking was shortly after dedication of the St. George Temple on April 6, 1877. The site of the Logan Temple had been held in reserve for many years. It was used as a park and public grounds before being dedicated as the site for the temple. The Salt Lake Temple had been announced in 1847, but construction was still underway and would not be completed until 1893, so the Logan and St. George temples were built to satisfy the church's need for temples. More than 25,000 people worked on the Logan Temple. Timber used for the temple was hauled from the Temple Fork area of Logan Canyon. Lime and quartzite was quarried out of nearby Green Canyon. Most materials were extracted during winter when farm duties were low and because transporting material was easier on sled than wagon. A combination of hired hands and volunteers were used with wards providing quotas of volunteers. As completion of the temple neared, women in the area were asked to make carpets for the temple, since commercially made carpet could not be bought in Utah at that time. The women spent two months working to hand make 2,144 square yards of carpet. The Logan Temple was the second temple to be completed in the Utah area and is the church's sixth largest temple. It was built on a plot selected by Brigham Young and has 4 ordinance rooms and 11 sealing rooms, with a total floor area of .The design by the church's head architect, Truman O. Angell, had two towers and was based on the same pattern as the Salt Lake Temple, with a large assembly hall and other similar rooms. On May 17, 1884 the Logan Temple was dedicated by LDS Church president John Taylor. The design incorporates an unusual amount of Gothic detailing compared with other temples, which are more Renaissance or Byzantine-inspired. In 1917, a fire destroyed much of the southeast stairway of the Logan Temple. Forty thousand dollars was spent to repair it within three months. In 1949, the temple was remodeled and received updated lighting, heating, air conditioning, elevators, and other modern conveniences. In 1977, more remodeling was undertaken and the interior was completely gutted and redone. After remodeling, the temple was rededicated on March 13, 1979 by church president Spencer W. Kimball. The Logan Temple was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 20, 1975. Temple presidents Notable temple presidents have included: Marriner W. Merrill (1884‚Äì1906); William Budge (1906‚Äì18); ElRay L. Christiansen (1943‚Äì52); Vaughn J. Featherstone (2002‚Äì05); and W. Rolfe Kerr (2008‚Äì11). The current temple president is Jerry L.

Erik moved to Boston and under the name Mister E he achieved some fame as both a historian and a vigilante who sought out and destroyed what he perceived to be evil. His forte was the supernatural, and he battled many magical beings over the years. At one point, he met \\"the Superman\\".The Books of Magic #4 He hired a young woman recently emigrated from Dublin named Kelly O'Toole to be his assistant after she helped him defeat her former employer, Judge Kobold, who was both a werewolf and a vampire who had sentenced numerous alleged witches to hang. He fought with false zombies, creatures built from corpses by mad scientists, and a leprechaun who had allowed Kelly's mother the financial opportunity to visit her in Boston. He assisted a young man, David Neu (Neu is Rozakis's wife's surname), who was researching manuscripts by Cotton Mather, to kill a hound that allegedly belonged to Salem witches, and also hired him on as an assistant. He guided the two into hanging another hound out the window. The three also fought a descendant of Mathew Maule who claimed to be Maule himself. Mister E joined Doctor Occult, John Constantine and the Phantom Stranger to teach young Tim Hunter about magic. Tim was destined to become a powerful sorcerer, but Mister E believed that he would one day pose a threat to humanity. Mister E journeyed into the future with Tim, showing him a timeline in which Tim led the forces of evil against the world. Mister E then tried to kill Tim at the end of the universe, but was interrupted by Destiny and Death. Death sent Tim back to his own time, but did not help Mister E, so he had to go back in time one step at a time. Mister E was determined to return and kill Tim, but he was sidetracked in time by the Temptress and the Shadower. These two mystic beings represented repressed parts of Mister E's own mind. In the end Mister E and the Shadower destroyed the Temptress. On his walk back from the end of time E encountered Pyotr Konstantin, who tagged along with him back to the present day. Mister E made the difficult decision to let Tim Hunter live in peace, thus breaking the cycle of abuse started by E's own father. =Attempt at normalcy= E attempted to live a normal life in New York City, going so far as to make friends and talk to women. He suffered from visions of a world eaten up by the Cancer God M'Nagalah, and knew that Pyotr Konstantin somehow caused it. In the dead of night E broke into the homes of Russian immigrants in an attempt to find Pyotr, and threatened them with his hammer and stakes. E's nighttime activities made the news, and John Constantine knew it had to be E, so he summoned the other members of the Trenchcoat Brigade to have a chat with him. E took the Trenchcoat Brigade on a trip to the possible future of his vision, where the only person left alive was Pyotr. E staked Pyotr through the chest, but it didn't kill him, and Pyotr summoned the Whining Ones to attack the Brigade. The Brigade won the fight and Pyotr told them they could avert the tragedy he caused if they took him back in time to the 17th century, so E complied. In the past Pyotr cast a spell to force the Brigade to confront and deal with each other's past failures and guilt while he set off to prevent his past self from setting off the chain of events that unleashed M'nagalah. The Brigade conquered each other's guilt and found Pyotr, who'd failed to stop his past self. E took the Brigade to the time of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, when Pyotr's past self and Elliana of the Leshy, whose people had been destroyed by mankind, would bring M'nagalah to Earth. E took M'nagalah, who needed a mortal filled with guilt to allow him corporal existence on Earth, and allowed him into his body. E conquered his guilt and M'nagalah, preventing his vision of a cancer destroyed world from occurring. Timothy Hunter would later magically try to contact Constantine, Stranger and Occult. His power sent the message to everyone, including E. He showed up with the others and tried to apologize to Tim for what had happened earlier. =The New 52= In The New 52, E has cast an unknown spell that caused his eyes to bleed out. He appears as an enemy of Constantine. Constantine has described him as one of the most cruel and insane mages in the world. He speaks with a Southern accent and dresses in white.

He often carried weapons for fighting supernatural creatures (silver bullets, wooden stakes, crucifixes, etc.). Hints of his psychological disturbance were implied when he justified the executions of the Salem Witch Trials.Secrets of Haunted House #39-40 In the Books of Magic storyline Mister E was blinded as a child, when his deranged father gouged out his eyeballs for gazing at a woman of low moral character (his mother). He still has the mystical ability to see \\"what needs to be seen\\", but can now see the good and evil in the souls of others. He learned the ability to walk through time from his older self. Mister E also suffers from dissociative identity disorder (formerly known as multiple personality disorder), swinging from a mild personality to a psychotic fundamentalist Christian. In the New 52, E also has a staff that can tear a person's soul from their body.

It is located south of Scotia, at an elevation of 322 feet (98 m), from the Pacific Ocean in the Lost Coast, near the King Range. It has a general store, elementary school, post office, and a few houses nearby. Many of the locals live in the hills surrounding the Mattole valley, named after the Mattole River which runs through the valley. The ZIP code is 95545 and the community is inside area code 707. History The first post office at Honeydew opened in 1926. Honeydew, Petrolia and Capetown were originally stagecoach and mail stops in the 1800s. Transportation The steepness and related geotechnical challenges of the coastal mountains made this stretch of coastline too costly for state highway or county road builders to establish routes through the area, leaving it the most undeveloped portion of the California coast. California State Route 1, which runs very close along the coast for most of the route's length, stops at Leggett and merges with U.S. Route 101, which runs several miles inland. There are three roads leading to Honeydew: one comes from neighboring Southern Humboldt town of Garberville, which follows Wilder Ridge Road, another off U.S. Route 101 (State Highway) that runs through the Redwood forest, and another from Ferndale in the north. The Ferndale route, over what is locally known as \\"the Wildcat\\" (in reference to bobcats that reside in the area) offers scenic views of the Pacific Ocean and the neighboring town of Petrolia. All three routes traverse over twisting mountain roads, which can be treacherous in bad weather, especially during coastal fog conditions. The valley itself is at a confluence of climates. Just a few miles away to the west weather is often foggy and cool, while the interior valleys can reach summer temperatures of 100 ¬∞F (38 ¬∞C) and of rain per year. It is wise for travelers in the area to prepare for quickly changing weather in all seasons, as there is very limited cell phone coverage, being primarily nearest the Honeydew General Store and the river valley flats nearby, should emergency help be required. Electricity and access to the area can be interrupted in inclement weather. People visiting the area are strongly encouraged to check local road reports should conditions change. Fuel is generally ‚Äì but not always ‚Äì available at the General Store, and at Petrolia, to the west. Schools There are three schools in the area: Honeydew Elementary School, Mattole Valley Triple Junction High School and Honeydew Charter School #159.  Culture  Because of its isolated location, Honeydew retains a small town atmosphere. There are no motels in the town, but there are several campgrounds nearby. The local firefighters, Honeydew Volunteer Fire Company, organize the \\"Roll on the Mattole\\" every summer to raise operating funds for the fire company. The region has a long history of sheep and cattle ranching. The Mattole Grange is the main gathering place for community events. A locally owned development including a hardware store and other shops about from the town center, submitted for approval in 2009, was approved by the Humboldt County Board of Supervisors in July 2013.Stansburry, Linda, Honeydew's Hangout: Plans for new businesses could mean big changes for a one-store town, North Coast Journal, , accessed September 13, 2013 Climate The K√∂ppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is \\"Csb\\".

He sought to expand the Beneventos' influence into areas of Italy that were still under Byzantine control, but he also had to defend against Charlemagne, who had conquered northern Italy.  Genealogy  Arechis was descended from the Lombards, who had invaded the Italian peninsula in the late sixth century. The Lombards established their kingdom in northern Italy. Its capital was at Pavia, and it also included two independent southern duchies--the Spoleto and Benevento. Arechis was the son of Duke Liutprand, whom he succeeded in 756. Arechis continued to use the title duke of Benevento until the Lombard kingdom fell to Charlemagne in 774. Arechis adopted the title prince of Benevento after the fall of the kingdom-- probably as a gesture of independence--and continued to use it until his death in 787.  Family  Around 757, Arechis married Adelperga, a daughter of the northern Lombard king Desiderius. Arechis established friendly--but largely independent--relations with Desiderius. This lasted until 774, when the Lombard kingdom fell to the Franks and Desiderius was deposed. The Beneventan couple produced five children: three boys and two girls.  Cultural contributions  Ruins of the Castello di Arechi, a fortress augmented by Arechis after moving his capital to Salerno By eighth century standards, Adelperga and Arechis were notable patrons of culture. Adelperga commissioned the major Lombard writer Paul the Deacon to produce his Historia Romana, a textbook of Roman history which was widely used during the rest of the Middle Ages. Some historians also argue that they commissioned Paul's more famous Historia gentis Langobardorum although this is uncertain. Arechis arranged for the transfer of saints' relics to the newly commissioned church of Santa Sofia in Benevento. The church still survives, albeit heavily restored. It is decorated with rare eighth-century frescoes. Arechis also put resources into building projects in Salerno, including a new palace and castle. Salerno became an increasingly important port city during Arechis' reign. Major southern monasteries, such as Montecassino and San Vincenzo al Volturno also received substantial donations from him.  Political activities  Arechis was duke when Charlemagne conquered the north Italian Lombard kingdom in 774. Although Arechis refused to submit when Charlemagne made himself king of the Lombards, Benevento was left largely unmolested. In the same year Arechis adopted the title of \\"prince of Benevento\\". He also issued a handful of laws. Both these acts were probably intended as a gesture of defiance against Charlemagne--until this time only the Lombard kings had enacted laws. Since Charlemagne now styled himself king of the Lombards, Arechis was effectively rejecting Charlemagne's right to this title. In 776, Arechis was probably involved in a Lombard conspiracy to throw off Frankish domination. Charlemagne successfully crushed this revolt, which was mostly focused in northeastern Friuli. Arechis does not seem to have provided much practical support for the rebellion and Charlemagne was forced to hurry back north of the Alps, rather than dealing with Arechis. Once again, geographical distance had protected Arechis from the Franks. Arechis' Beneventan state continued to skirmish with and try to seize territory from the neighbouring Byzantine duchy of Naples. At some point, however, perhaps in the mid-780s, Arechis reached an agreement with the duke of Naples set out in a document called a pactum. This agreement sets forth detailed provisions dealing with landholding and dispute settlement. It may have been intended to relieve Benevento, which was facing the looming Frankish threat. This crystallised in 787, when Charlemagne advanced into south Italy and besieged Capua, an important town in the principality of Benevento. Arechis left Benevento itself and retreated to his new centre, the port of Salerno. Under pressure, Arechis apparently submitted to Frankish suzerainty. As Einhard, Charlemagne's biographer, describes it in his Vita Caroli Magni: Another tremissis of Arechis Superficially, Charlemagne seemed to have imposed himself on Benevento. Arechis had paid tribute and one of his sons was being held hostage as a guarantee of Benevento's loyalty. Frankish influence was also given formal expression. Traditionally Benevento had produced and used gold coinage, but from 787 the Beneventan mint began to strike silver coins too. The new coins were similar to those issued by Charlemagne's Frankish kingdom. Both the new silver and the traditional gold coins, as well as Beneventan legal documents, all started to include Charlemagne's name and title alongside those of Arechis. The inclusion of titles on coins and in charters was considered an important marker of political authority. However, Einhard overstates Charlemagne's success. Frankish influence in Benevento proved to be very short-lived. In 788, both Grimoald's elder brother, Romuald, and Arechis himself died. Grimoald III, who was being held hostage by Charlemagne, succeeded as prince of Benevento. Unwisely, Charlemagne released Grimoald in return for an oath of loyalty. Grimoald did not keep his promise; by c. 791, he had effectively proclaimed himself independent and successfully resisted the Franks. Grimoald later tried to throw off Frankish suzerainty, but Charlemagne's sons, Pepin of Italy and Charles the Younger, forced him to submit in 792. References *Einhard. The Life of Charlemagne.

Born in Perthshire, Scotland around 1820, Brand married Isabella Duncan in January 1840. Over the next seven years they had three sons and one daughter. Brand was working as a carter in 1852 when he was convicted of theft at Edinburgh. Erickson (1983) claims \\"Brand's occupation as a carter presented opportunities for picking up stray articles. He succumbed to temptation....\\" Brand was sentenced to 14 years' transportation, and arrived in Western Australia on board the Stag in June 1855. He received his ticket of leave the following year, and took up employment in the Greenough area. By the time he received his conditional pardon in August 1859, his wife and children had emigrated to the colony to join him. A fifth child was born in 1861. In 1867 Brand bought of land at Bootenal Reserve near Dongara. The family worked to establish a farm there, and later became active in the district's civic affairs. George Brand died in 1872.

De Savoye is the leading decision of the Supreme Court of Canada on the enforcement of extraprovincial judgments. The Court held that the standard for enforcing a default judgment from a different province is not the same as if it were from another country; rather the Court adopts the test from Indyka v Indyka, [1969] 1 AC 33 (HL) and the Moran v Pyle National (Canada) Ltd, [1975] 1 SCR 393 where there must be a \\"real and substantial connection\\" between the petitioner and the country or territory exercising jurisdiction. Background De Savoye, the appellant, was the mortgagor of a property in Alberta and resided in British Columbia. The mortgage defaulted and the respondents brought action in Alberta, for the land they had mortgaged in that same province. The appellant chose not to appear or defend his actions. The respondents obtained judgment ex juris in the foreclosure action, and then obtained orders for the judicial sale of the properties. They then initiated separate action in the British Columbia Supreme Court to enforce the Alberta judgments for the shortfall. Issue The main question placed before the court was the degree of recognition that should be accorded by the courts of one province to the judgments of another for a personal action brought forward in the second province when the defendant did not reside there. Reasons of the court Justice La Forest wrote the unanimous reasons of court for dismissing the appeal. After surveying the case law in both England and the United States he noted that the old common law rules, based on territoriality, sovereignty, independence and attornment, were outdated. La Forest argued that a modern approach based on the principle of comity (\\"the deference and respect due by other states to the actions of a state legitimately taken within its territory\\") and reciprocity were needed a basis of recognizing foreign judgments. The infringement on the nation's sovereignty is justified where there is mutual convenience between states. The earlier views of distrusting the justice system of other countries, he argued, was outdated. Instead, he emphasized that the business community operates on a world economy and so the law must accommodate \\"the flow of wealth, skills and people across state lines\\". On the basis of Canada's federal system comity should be even stronger between provinces, which share a much deeper bond than nations, based on shared citizenship and a common market. In that regard, For La Forest, the concern was to define an outer limit of comity.at 1104 The solution was to limit the jurisdiction to where there is a \\"real and substantial connection\\" between the action and the province.at 1109. Note that he used different phrasing of the principle in the decision. At 1108 he said the connection was between \\"the damages suffered and the jurisdiction\\", while elsewhere at 1106 he said it was a \\"connection between the jurisdiction and the wrongdoing\\". He intentionally left the meaning of \\"real and substantial connection\\" open, stating: Aftermath The test established in this case was later elaborated on by the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Muscutt v Courcelles,Muscutt v Courcelles (2002), 60 OR (3d) 20 (CA) where a list of eight factors was given to be considered when determining whether a real and substantial connection exists: # the connection between the forum and the plaintiff's claim; # the connection between the forum and the defendant; # unfairness to the defendant in assuming jurisdiction; # unfairness to the plaintiff in not assuming jurisdiction; # the involvement of other parties to the suit; # the court's willingness to recognize and enforce an extraprovincial judgment rendered on the same jurisdictional basis; # whether the case is interprovincial or international in nature; and # comity and the standards of jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement prevailing elsewhere. The Morguard principles were elaborated upon in subsequent cases, notably in: * Hunt v T&N; plc (where the Morguard principles were held to apply to constitutional challenges as well), and * Beals v Saldanha (where the \\"real and substantial connection\\" test was applied in an international setting) See also * List of Supreme Court of Canada cases References Category:Conflict of laws case law Category:Canadian civil procedure case law Category:Supreme Court of Canada cases Category:1990 in Canadian case law ","title":"Morguard Investments Ltd v De Savoye"},{"id":"3683562","text":"Nora Brockstedt (20 January 1923 - 5 November 2015) was a Norwegian singer.

A member of the Burgundian school, he was known mainly for his secular songs which were in a lyrical and graceful style.  Life  He may have come from Kortrijk, since an Oliver Joye, possibly his father, has been identified there in 1420. Gilles seems to have had an excellent musical education, probably at either Kortrijk or Bruges, where he was hired as a singer in 1449. Documents from the cathedral archives show that he was often in trouble: engaging in street brawls, frequenting brothels, refusing to take part in regular singing events, and in particular visiting a notorious prostitute of the town named \\"Rosabelle\\". In spite of these activities, he was made a priest, and became a canon at Cleves in 1453 and at St. Donatian in 1459.Fallows, Grove online Between 1454 and 1459 no record of his activities survives in the Low Countries; based on his composition of an Italian ballata on a poem by a contemporary Florentine, it has been suggested that he spent some time in Italy, as did so many other Franco-Flemish composers of his and succeeding generations. By 1459 he was back at St. Donatian in Bruges.Fallows, Grove online In 1462 he was hired as a singer by the Burgundian court chapel, a position he retained officially until 1471, although he had ceased to perform his duties in 1468. Between 1465 and 1473 he was also a rector at Delft. After 1471 he most likely returned to St. Donatian. He died in Bruges, and was buried in the church of St. Donatian.Fallows, Grove online A portrait of Joye has survived, possibly painted by Hans Memling in 1472.Fallows, Grove online Currently it is in the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Massachusetts.  Music  All of Joye's surviving music is vocal and secular, and for three voices only. Four of his works are rondeaux, in French (though the text for one rondeau is lost), and one is an Italian ballata, probably written between 1454 and 1459 when he may have been in Italy. Joye's songs are typical of the Burgundian secular music of the period; they are melodic, clear, and lyrical in style. One of them, Ce qu'on fait, is frankly obscene.Fallows, Grove online No sacred music is known for certain to have been written by Joye, but two anonymous masses based on the contemporary lyric O rosa bella have been attributed to Joye for stylistic reasons; in addition, the similarity of O rosa bella to the name of his favorite prostitute, along with the general irreverent character evident in his life and other work, may support this hypothesis.Fallows, Grove online Joye is one of the composers mentioned in Guillaume Cr√©tin's famous poem D√©ploration sur le tr√©pas de Jean Ockeghem written on the death of Johannes Ockeghem in 1497; in it he is one of the angels welcoming Ockeghem into Heaven. The composers mentioned by Cr√©tin have long been used as a list of those considered most famous in the late 15th century, thus indicating Joye's reputation, in spite of the small number of his works which have survived.Reese, p. 115  Works  # Ce qu'on fait a catimini (3 voices, rondeau, in French) # Mercy mon dueil je ne supplied (3 voices, rondeau, in French) # Non pas que je veuille penser (3 voices, rondeau, in French) # Textless rondeau, also for three voices # Poy ch√© crudel Fortuna et rio Distino (3 voices, ballata, in Italian) Notes  References  * * \\"Gilles Joye,\\" The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, ed.

(Note: Reese makes the claim that Joye was also a theologian and poet; this derives from the biographical compilation by J. F. Foppens in 1731, Compendium chronologicum episcoporum brugensium (Bruges, 1731), but a more recent study by F. Van Molle (1960) refutes this, showing that Foppens confused Joye with someone else.)

Domino has collaborated with musicians such as Matt Johnson of The The, Stephin Merritt The Sixths, Blaine L. Reininger and Steven Brown of Tuxedomoon, Virginia Astley, Luc van Acker and Ultramarine. She is also one half of the duo Snakefarm. Her stage name was borrowed from the Domino Sugar company in NY and is also a play on the term Anno Domini.Anna Domino 2015 Background Domino was born in an American military hospital in Tokyo, Japan in 1955. Her father, James J. P. Taylor, was a private in the U.S. army translating for Voice of America, stationed in Yokohama, who went on to become a videographer documenting the performing arts in Washington, D.C. area. Her mother, Mimi Cazort, was a Curator Emerita at the National Gallery of Canada. Her brother, Alan Taylor, is a film and television director based in New York City. During her childhood and adolescence the family moved frequently, starting in Tokyo, Japan and winding up in Ottawa, Canada. Her mother studied art history at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and then moved with her children to live first in Florence, Italy, while she did research for her dissertation, and then to Ottawa, Canada, where she worked for the National Gallery as curator of the Department of Prints and Drawings. Though quite shy as a child, Anna was also a bit of a show off and her hobby of memorizing and reciting comedy records in high school led to her expulsion shortly before graduation. Leaving high school, Anna and her best friend Shelley McCready set off for several years of unsupervised exploration. Their adventures hitch-hiking across the US and down through Mexico, left her with a stubborn conviction in the basic decency of humanity. Anna followed up with several years of study at Toronto's Ontario College of Art and Design where she focused on sound recording, video editing and hologram photography. In 1977 Anna travelled to New York City for a two-week visit and stayed for 20 years. =Solo= Early in her career Domino played with a number of New York City bands but she was determined to find an outlet for her own song writing. In 1982, a cassette of original songs recorded by Anna in her bedroom was picked up by the Belgian record label Les Disques du Cr√©puscule, who brought her to Brussels to work in an actual recording studio. Cr√©puscule released a single in 1983 titled ‚ÄúTrust In Love‚Äù, followed by the EP ‚ÄúEast and West‚Äù and a 12‚Äù single ‚Äú‚ÄòRythm‚Äô‚Äù, in 1984. In 1986, her first full-length album ‚ÄúAnna Domino‚Äù was released. In the summer of 1986 she put together a band and headed off on a three-month tour of Europe. During this tour Anna got to know Michel Delory, guitarist for Bel Canto and Univers Z√©ro, and they collaborated on her second album ‚ÄúThis Time‚Äù, which garnered further positive critical attention and airplay. In 1989, Domino released another EP called ‚ÄúColouring In the Edge and the Outline‚Äù, followed by her third album ‚ÄúMysteries of America‚Äù in 1990, her last with the Crepuscule label. Domino then returned to New York full-time And was joined by Michel Delory. They were married in 1992. In 2010 Anna Domino released two new songs on a compilation that included a number of her Crepuscule colleagues. The album was called \\"After Twilight\\" and the songs were ‚ÄúThe Light Downtown‚Äù and ‚ÄúWonderkey‚Äù as well as a new version of her song ‚Äú‚ÄòRythm‚Äô‚Äù. A short tour of Europe in early 2013 sparked new interest in Domino's work and some welcome encouragement to finish unreleased material dear to her heart. Anna Domino is working on an album of new songs as well as another volume of traditional American ballads for Snakefarm (see below). =Snakefarm= In 1999 Domino and Delory formed the folk rock alternative outfit Snakefarm, with the idea of subjecting traditional American ballads to updated arrangements. They released an album, ‚ÄúSongs From My Funeral‚Äù in 1999, on Kneeling Elephant/BMG in the US, available on LTM UK. Their second album ‚ÄúMy Halo At Half-Light‚Äù was released in 2011 on the Fledg‚Äôling label in the UK.

National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map , accessed May 13, 2011 tributary of the Mississippi River in northeastern Missouri in the United States. It is formed near its mouth by the confluence of the North Fabius River and the South Fabius River. The North Fabius River also flows through southeastern Iowa. The Middle Fabius River joins the North Fabius upstream of that river's mouth. Each of the three rivers have been subjected to substantial straightening and channelization. According to tradition, the Fabius River is named for the Roman consul Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus. However, the State Historical Society of Missouri suggests Fabius actually was the name of a French pioneer in the area. Course =North Fabius River= The North Fabius River, about long, is the longest of the three forks and rises near Moulton in southwestern Appanoose County, Iowa. It flows generally southeastwardly through Davis County in Iowa and Schuyler, Scotland, Knox, Clark, Lewis and Marion counties in Missouri, past the towns of Memphis and Monticello, both in Missouri. In its upper course it collects two short tributaries known as the North Fork North Fabius River and the South Fork North Fabius River.

The South Fabius flows generally south-southeastwardly through Knox, Lewis, Shelby and Marion counties, past the town of Newark. Near Newark it collects the Little Fabius River, which rises near Hurdland and flows for its entire length in Knox County.

The natural confluence of the rivers was about upstream of the Fabius River's mouth at the Mississippi River, but the North Fabius River has been re-routed by channelization, and now joins the South Fabius River about upstream of the Mississippi. The Fabius flows into the Mississippi River about three miles downstream of Quincy, Illinois. The Fabius River averages approximately 907 cubic feet per second at the junction of the North and South Fabius rivers.

Boil-up traditionally includes a balanced combination of meat and bones (e.g. pork), greens such as puha, watercress or cabbage, and k≈´mara or potatoes, boiled together.  Origins  Boil up In Polynesian cuisine, food was boiled in wooden bowls into which a red-hot stone was dropped. This was sufficient for heating liquids and pastes, but was insufficient to cook taro or pork; those foods were usually baked in an earth oven. The ancestors of MƒÅori carried these traditions to Aotearoa, making puddings of mashed k≈´mara (called roroi) or mashed kiekie flower bracts in large wooden bowls. When PƒÅkehƒÅ settlers arrived from Europe, they brought with them new foods and iron cooking pots. Pigs and potatoes from Europe were rapidly adopted by MƒÅori, who produced large quantities for trading with the settlers. As settler housing did not have the built-in coal ranges and ovens of Regency Britain, most cooking was done on a hearth, in a cast iron three-legged cauldron or camp oven. Camp ovens were imported in their hundreds from the 1850s, and were popular with MƒÅori: they could be transported by canoe or carried, and could stand on three feet in the embers or be hung by a chain. Camp ovens were used for making flour-and-sugar puddings, baking traditional rƒìwana bread, and for the first pork-and-potato boil ups.

Her career has included works with quadraphonic sound. She has been nominated for a Grammy Award for Best New Age Album five times. Her success with electronic music has her dubbed \\"Diva of the Diode\\" and \\"America's first female synth hero\\". Early life Ciani was born in an army hospital in Indiana. She was raised in Quincy, Massachusetts, a southern suburb of Boston. She has four sisters and Italian roots. Her father was a physician and she started to play the piano at six. From 1964 to 1968, Ciani studied traditional liberal arts at Wellesley College in nearby Wellesley where she received classical music training. She also took evening classes, one of which was at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology which is where she first learned about music technology. One artist she cites as a big influence is German photographer Ilse Bing, who provided lyrics and drawings to her track \\"Lumi√®re\\", along with classical music composers and pianist Glenn Gould. A Buchla 200 modular synthesizer Ciani studied for a master's degree in composition at University of California, Berkeley from 1968 to 1970. In her first year, she met synthesizer inventor and pioneer Don Buchla through her boyfriend at the time, and became highly influenced by his analog modular synthesizer, the Buchla, then a competitor of the Moog synthesizer by Bob Moog. She spent time with a Buchla synthesizer in a rented studio at the tape music center at Mills College in Oakland, paying $5 for each visit. She took a summer course in computer music at Stanford University where she was taught by Max Mathews the father of computer music, John Chowning and Leland Smith at the Artificial Intelligence Lab. After graduating from Berkeley, Ciani took up work at Buchla and Associates to earn enough money for a Buchla synthesizer of her own, the Buchla 200. There she \\"Sat and soldered joints and drilled holes for three dollars an hour. When the synthesizers were finished, tested and shipped off, I felt as though I were losing children\\". Her first paid job in composing was in 1969, producing for 10 Macy*s Christmas advertisements. Around this time she worked on sound installations at galleries, exhibitions, and dance performances, composed at San Francisco Tape Music Center, which was housed at Mills College, composed for films, and recorded experimental pieces in her garage studio. Ciani also started a furniture company, but ceased after six months after two \\"unsaleable\\" designs, theft, fire, and vandalism. She realised that she was not doing what she liked and decided to make her living at music. In 1970, she released her debut record, Voices of Packaged Souls (1970), a collaboration with sculptor Harold Paris, put together using music concr√®te techniques at the KPFA radio station in Berkeley during the night shift. The album had an initial release of 50 copies. Career =1970s= In April 1974, Ciani began a nineteen-year stay in New York City, travelling only with clothes and her Buchla synthesizer. Among her first activities was a solo performance at the Bonino Gallery in conjunction with the opening of a Ronald Mallory exhibition. Ciani became a session musician, but soon struggled to maintain a steady income. She once accepted a concert performance at the Lincoln Center in Manhattan, but when she was denied a four-speaker quadraphonic sound setup, she refused to perform. She also spent three years on the venue's renovation, but \\"that didn't work\\". At a solo show in April 1975, Ciani learned that Vladimir Ussachevsky had attended and recommended her to a grant. She later wrote that she was \\"homeless and happy\\" at this time and moved from the loft of art critic Robert Hughes to the floor of Philip Glass's basement recording studio. By 1976, Ciani had secured a National Endowment for the Arts grant. In 1978 Ciani founded Ciani/Musica. Inc. to produce jingles for advertisements for companies such as Coca-Cola, Merrill Lynch, AT&T; and General Electric. She enjoyed the opportunity to work for such companies and enjoyed the creative freedom because few people understood what the Buchla could do as it lacked a keyboard. The sound of a bottle of Coca-Cola being opened and poured was one of Ciani's most widely recognized works and was used in radio and television commercials in the late 1970s. She is also responsible for \\"logo\\" sounds pertaining to Energizer and ABC.Pinch 2004, p. 778. Such was the demand for her services, that at one point she was doing up to 10 sessions a week. Ciani performed as a guest artist on various albums from 1976. The first was the same-titled album by the Starland Vocal Band, including the \\"swoosh\\" sound to \\"Afternoon Delight\\". At the time, Ciani thought the work was just a \\"song about spaceships\\". In the following year, Ciani provided sound effects for Star Wars and Other Galactic Funk, a disco version of the Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope soundtrack by Meco. Ciani scored Lloyd Williams's 1975 experimental film Rainbow's Children, a 1986 documentary about Mother Teresa, and for the soap opera One Life to Live. She also composed the 1976 Columbia Pictures and Columbia Pictures Television theme logos. In 1979, Ciani was commissioned to provide sounds to the pinball machine game Xenon, which featured her own voice fed through a vocoder.Xenon at the Internet Pinball Database This marked the first female voice heard in a pinball game and Ciani had never played pinball before the project arose. In 2013, she was inducted into The Pinball Expo Hall of Fame for her work on the game. Ciani then sampled her voice onto a sound chip with the aim of selling it for use in other applications, including elevator announcements. The US federal government approached her to design sounds for flight simulators. =1980s= In 1980, Ciani demonstrated several of her sound effects on national television with an appearance on The David Letterman Show. The producers agreed for her to perform her own music with the show's house band, but they cut to a commercial break when they started to play. That same year, she also appeared on the syndicated PBS Children's TV show [3-2-1 Contact] demonstrating her synthesizer. Ciani's television work in the 1980s included an Atari commercial and work on a proposed \\"negative vocoder\\" with Harald Bode, but development ceased following Bode's death in 1987. Ciani scored the soundtrack to Lily Tomlin's film The Incredible Shrinking Woman which marked the first solo female composer of a Hollywood film. In 1982, Ciani released her first studio album characterised by electronic and new-age music. She later said that making albums was something that she had always wanted to do, calling it \\"my destiny\\". She started on her first, Seven Waves, in 1979 which saw an initial Japanese only release. Ciani reasoned this to the difficulty American record labels had in selling an electronic album by a female artist that lacked vocals. In 1984, it was released in the US by Atlantic Records, thanks to Ilhan Mimaroglu who was an executive at the Finnadar label. The album was produced using an MC-8 and MC-4 sequencer, a Prophet 5 synthesizer, a Roland TR-808 drum machinedb: The Sound Engineering Magazine, July 1972, pages 28-32the Buchla 200, Bode Vocoder, Lyricon, Synclavier, Polymoog, and Arp and Eventide Processing. In 1985, Ciani received a Bronze Lion award at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. Ciani's 1986 album The Velocity of Love, released by RCA Records, features the title track which became her best known song. It marks her first piano recordings for many years since focusing her work on the Buchla. In July and August 1987, Ciani performed her first live solo concerts in 15 years. In 1987, Ciani signed a deal with Private Music, which released a number of albums from 1988 to 1992, including re-issues of her first two albums. =1990s= Although emphasizing electronic music in her recordings, her solo piano album Pianissimo, from 1990, became her best-selling album. Ciani ended her contract with Private Music with the compilation The Private Music of Suzanne Ciani, in 1992. In 1991, Ciani released Hotel Luna, the music for which was inspired by her travels to Italy to learn more about her Italian ancestry. In 1994, Ciani founded her own independent record label, Seventh Wave. Her husband became the label's president. All of her subsequent albums have been released on the label. Her 1994 album Dream Suite was recorded in Moscow with the Young Russia Orchestra, and was Grammy-nominated. 1999's Turning featured her first composition with lyrics, in the title track, sung by Taiwanese artist Chyi Yu. =2000s‚Äìpresent= In early 2006, Ciani's Silver Ship won in The 5th Annual Independent Music Awards for Best New Age Album.Independent Music Awards ‚Äì 5th Annual Winners Ciani was also an inaugural member of the Independent Music Awards' judging panel to support independent artists.Independent Music Awards ‚Äì Past Judges Ciani performs in a new-age jazz group, The Wave. In 2012, Ciani is inducted into the Keyboard Magazine Hall of Fame In 2014, she started a Kickstarter campaign to fund a documentary movie on her life as an electronic music pioneer. The campaign was successful, and the award-winning film, titled A Life in Waves, had its premiere on March 12, 2017 at the South by Southwest Festival, did the festival rounds and is now released on DVD. In February 2015, Ciani was one of three Wellesly College alumni to receive an Alumnae Achievement Award. In 2016, Ciani released Buchla Concerts 1975, formed of two live performances in New York City in April 1975. She was asked to release some archived material and following its release and \\"All of a sudden I was in the public eye with the electronics again! I wasn't aware at all about what was going on; it felt strange. [...] There was this whole renaissance going on when I came out\\". Buchla then convinced Ciani to purchase a Buchla synthesizer from him following his decision to sell his company, but she left it for a year before she started to use it. In 2016, Ciani released Sunergy, a collaboration using Buchla synthesizers with the musician Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith, as part of the RVNG Intl. FRKWYS Series. In March, 2017, \\"A Life in Waves\\" is released, documentary about Ciani, produced by Brett Whitcomb and Bradford Thomason of Window Pictures. In May 2017, Ciani became the first female to receive a Moog Music Innovation Award at the annual electronic festival Moogfest. In June 2018, Ciani and producer KamranV released LIVE Quadraphonic, a live album documenting her first solo performance on a Buchla synthesizer in 40 years. The show took place at Gray Area in San Francisco on March 5, 2016, presented in four channel quadraphonic sound. It marked one of the first quadraphonic vinyl releases in over 30 years and used a matrix recording system developed by Involve Audio in Melbourne, Australia, based partially on the QS matrix system. The vinyl LP saw a limited physical release of 227 copies, each costing $227 with a custom designed QS- compatible quadraphonic decoder, also developed by Involve Audio, included in the package. In June 2019, Finders Keepers Records released a previously unreleased album by Ciani that she recorded in 1969 entitled Flowers of Evil. It features a recital of √âl√©vation by French poet Charles Baudelaire with Ciani performing on a Buchla synthesizer. Personal life In 1992, Ciani was diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer which she recovered from after successful radiation treatments and surgery. The news prompted her relocation from New York City to California and she has resided in the coastal community of Bolinas since. From 1994 to 2000, Ciani was married to producer and entertainment attorney Joseph Anderson. The marriage ended in divorce.

Life and career Osmond was born in Ogden, Utah, the son of Olive May (n√©e Davis; 1925 - 2004) and George Virl Osmond (1917 - 2007). Wayne has been performing since he was six years old. He made his national television debut on NBC's The Andy Williams Show, with brothers Alan, Merrill, and Jay. The four remained with Andy Williams for seven years. Alan, Merrill, Jay, and Wayne Osmond were also cast in nine episodes of the 1963-1964 ABC Western series, The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters, with Wayne in the role of young Leviticus Kissel. The series is the story of a wagon train to the American West as seen from the eyes of 12-year-old Jaime McPheeters, played by Kurt Russell, with other roles for Dan O'Herlihy, Michael Witney, and Charles Bronson.

Different games based on the film were also released for the SNES and various personal computers. Gameplay The player must face off against various doodles in Cool World. The player controls Detective Frank Harris, who must retrieve five pieces of a tunnel map bridging the real world with a cartoonish dimension known as Cool World, which is populated by cartoons known as doodles. Along the way, he must face off against the henchmen of Holli Would, a cartoon woman who seeks the Spike of Power, an artifact keeping the real world and Cool World in balance. Frank must also contend with members of the Popper Police (who were actually his allies in the film) and their police cruiser. As Detective Harris, the player must navigate through four different levels and stop Holli Would while collecting coins and shooting at rogue doodles. These levels include the streets of Cool World, the road that separates Cool World from the place where the playful characters of Sweet Place live, the town of Sweet Place and its surrounding countryside. While four of them can be selected, a fifth one can only be unlocked by properly finishing all four levels. Each level holds an important piece of a map that makes it possible for Detective Harris to travel to the Real World and back.

Located in the city of Manti, Utah, it was the third LDS temple built west of the Mississippi River, after the Mormons' trek westward. (The St. George and Logan Utah temples preceded it.) The Manti Temple was designed by William Harrison Folsom, who moved to Manti while the temple was under construction. The temple dominates the Sanpete Valley, and can be seen from many miles. Like all LDS temples, only church members in good standing may enter. It is one of only two remaining LDS temples in the world where live actors are used in the endowment ceremonies (the other is the Salt Lake Temple); all other temples use films in the presentation of the endowment. It is an early pioneering example of four rooms representing the journey of life.Boyd K. Packer. The Holy Temple, p. 35 History Brigham Young announced the decision to build an LDS temple in Manti on June 25, 1875, and dedicated the site on April 25, 1877. On the day of the dedication, Young took Warren S. Snow to the southeast corner of the temple site and told him, \\"Here is the spot where the Prophet Moroni stood and dedicated this piece of land for a Temple site, and that is the reason why the location is made here, and we can't move it from this spot.\\" The Salt Lake Temple had been announced in 1847, but construction was still underway and not finished until 1893. The Manti Temple was built, along with the St. George and Logan temples, to satisfy the church's immediate need for these structures. The site for the temple was the Manti Stone Quarry, a large hill immediately northeast of town. Early Mormon settlers in the area had prophesied that this would be the site of a temple. When Young announced the building of the temple, he also announced that the plot would then be known as \\"Temple Hill.\\" Manti Temple dedication admission, signed by Wilford Woodruff The temple was completed in 1888, and a private dedication was held on May 17, 1888, with a prayer written by Wilford Woodruff. Three public dedications were held on May 21-23, 1888, and were directed by Lorenzo Snow. The Manti Temple was the location of the Holy of Holies until the Salt Lake Temple was dedicated. The room was then used for sealings until it was closed in the late 1970s. A 1966 study found that 52 percent of temple work was being done in either the Salt Lake, Logan, or Manti temples, even though there were 13 operating temples by that time. This led to the building of the Ogden and Provo temples to relieve the strain on the older pioneer-era temples. Renovations The Manti Temple has undergone various remodeling and renovations. Construction of a great stone stairway leading up the hill to the west temple doors began in 1907. In 1935, the temple was fully lit at night for the first time. In 1940 the stone stairs were removed and work began to beautify the grounds. Between 1944 and 1945 the annex, chapel, kitchen, Garden Room, and men's and women's areas were remodeled. There was once a tunnel beneath the east tower of the temple through which wagons and cars could pass, but it was closed off in the 1960s. In 1981 church officials decided that the interior of the temple needed extensive remodeling. The renovation took four years, during which murals and original furniture were restored, offices were enlarged and remodeled, a separate door was made to the baptistry, water and weather damage were repaired, an elevator was installed, and locker rooms were improved among many other projects. In June 1985, Gordon B. Hinckley directed the rededication ceremonies. Exterior preservation efforts have also occurred since that time. Style The Manti Temple combines the Gothic Revival, French Renaissance Revival, Second French Empire, and Colonial architectural styles. The temple has of floor space, eight sealing rooms, four ordinance rooms, and a Celestial room. The exterior is made of fine-textured, cream- colored oolite limestone from quarries in the hill on which the temple now stands. The two towers of the temple are tall, and the open center spiral staircases inside the towers are marvels of pioneer ingenuity. Temple presidents Notable temple presidents have included: Daniel H. Wells (1888‚Äì91); Anthon H. Lund (1891‚Äì93); John D. T. McAllister (1893‚Äì1906); Robert D. Young (1933‚Äì43); Jack H. Goaslind Jr. (2000‚Äì03); and Ed J.

The first helicons observed were atmospheric whistlers,Storey, L. R. O. (9 July 1953) \\"An investigation of whistling atmospherics\\".

The electric field in the waves is dominated by the Hall effect, and is nearly at right angles to the electric current (rather than parallel as it would be without the magnetic field); so that the propagating component of the waves is corkscrew-shaped (helical) - hence the term ‚Äúhelicon,‚Äù coined by Aigrain. Aigrain, P. (1961) Proceedings of the International Conference on Semiconductor Physics (Publishing House of the Czechoslovak Academy of Science, Prague, 1961) p. 224. Helicons have the special ability to propagate through pure metals, given conditions of low temperature and high magnetic fields. Most electromagnetic waves in a normal conductor are not able to do this, since the high conductivity of metals (due to their free electrons) acts to screen out the electromagnetic field. Indeed, normally an electromagnetic wave would experience a very thin skin depth in a metal: the electric or magnetic fields are quickly reflected upon trying to enter the metal. (Hence the shine of metals.) However, skin depth depends on an inverse proportionality to the square root of angular frequency. Thus a low frequency electromagnetic wave may be able to overcome the skin depth problem, and thereby propagate throughout the material. One property of the helicon waves (readily demonstrated by a rudimentary calculation, using only the Hall effect terms and a resistivity term) is that at places where the sample surface runs parallel to the magnetic field, one of the modes contains electric currents that ‚Äúgo to infinity\\" in the limit of perfect conductivity; so that the Joule heating loss in such surface regions tends to a non-zero limit.Leg√©ndy, C.

The difference between a helicon plasma source and an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) is the presence of a magnetic field directed along the axis of the antenna. The presence of this magnetic field creates a helicon mode of operation with higher ionization efficiency and greater electron density than a typical ICP. The Australian National University, in Canberra, Australia, is currently researching applications for this technology. A commercially developed magnetoplasmadynamic engine called VASIMR also uses helicon discharge for generation of plasma in its engine. Potentially, Helicon Double Layer Thruster plasma based rockets are suitable for interplanetary travel.  Experiment  A simple experiment can be conducted with fairly affordable equipment, and may be found in university-level undergraduate advanced physics laboratory courses. A metal such as 99.999% pure indium is commonly used: it is cooled using liquid helium to reach the conditions of low temperature, while the high magnetic field is accomplished using a superconducting solenoid. Ultimately, the experiment characterizes the resonance frequency and resonance width of the helicon standing waves. It can also be used to measure the magnetoresistance and Hall coefficients of the pure metal.

Borden, 48 U.S. (7 How.) 1 (1849), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States established the political question doctrine in controversies arising under the Guarantee Clause of Article Four of the United States Constitution (Art. IV, ¬ß 4). Martin Luther was part of the Dorr Rebellion, an attempt to overthrow the charter government of Rhode Island that had stymied the efforts of those who wished to broaden the voting rights of state residents. The rebellion began as a political effort but turned violent. Martin Luther was arrested by Luther M. Borden, a state official, who searched his home and allegedly damaged his property. Luther contended that the charter government was not \\"republican\\" in nature because it restricted the electorate to only the most propertied classes; because Article Four states that \\"the United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government,\\" Luther argued that the Supreme Court should find that Borden acted without proper authority. In doing so, the Court would necessarily find that the \\"Dorrite\\" alternative republican government was the lawful government of Rhode Island, superseding the charter government. Court's decision The Supreme Court found that it was up to the President and Congress to enforce this clause and that, as an inherently political question, it was outside the purview of the Court. The case was cited as justification for Congress' actions towards southern states in the post-Civil War Reconstruction Era.Hubbs, Todd. 2006. \\"Luther v. Borden\\". Federalism in America: An Encyclopedia. The ruling established that the \\"republican form of government\\" clause of Article Four was non-justiciable, a ruling that still holds today. However, two decades after Luther v. Borden was decided, the Fourteenth Amendment, which included the Equal Protection Clause, was added to the Constitution. Baker v. Carr, in which the Court found that the Court could examine Tennessee's apportionment of legislative districts, was based on the Equal Protection Clause, and many subsequent cases that covered much of the same ground as Luther v. Borden followed suit.

Background Ship Ahoy was the first of two films in which Powell and Skelton co-starred. It is considered a lesser effort on both actors' behalf, however the film is chiefly remembered today for including Frank Sinatra, who appears in an uncredited performance as a singer with the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra. The movie also is credited with one of the most unusual displays of dance on screen for a sequence in which Powell's character, needing to communicate a message to a (real) US agent in the audience of one of her shows, manages to tap out the message in morse code. (Reportedly, Powell taps genuine code during the performance.) Skelton and Powell next paired up in 1943's I Dood It. In that film, they appeared with Jimmy Dorsey, Tommy's brother. Plot Tallulah Winters is a dancing star who is hired to perform on an ocean liner. Before she leaves, she is recruited by what she believes is a branch of the American government and asked to smuggle a prototype explosive mine out of the country. In fact, she is unknowingly working for Nazi agents who have stolen the mine. Meanwhile, Merton Kibble (Red Skelton), a writer of pulp fiction adventure stories but suffering from severe writer's block, is on the same ship and soon he finds himself embroiled in Tallulah's real-life adventure. Also appearing in the film were Bert Lahr, Tommy Dorsey, Buddy Rich, and Virginia O'Brien. Cast * Eleanor Powell as Tallulah Winters * Red Skelton as Merton K.

He died in 1999 and was succeeded by his son, Sir David de Villiers Graaff, 3rd Baronet. He was the leader of the centrist United Party which was the official opposition in the then all-white South African Parliament from 1956 to 1977. Early life Graaff succeeded his father as baronet in 1931. This baronetcy is one of twelve conferred on South Africans between 1841 and 1924. Graaff studied law at the University of Cape Town and Oxford. He was decorated for his military service in World War II. In 1932 he was noted for playing two first-class cricket matches for Western Province. His youngest brother was Johannes de Villiers Graaff, a noted South African Welfare Economist. Political career Graaff became a member of the House of Assembly, the lower house of Parliament, in 1948, the year his United Party was ousted from government by the conservative National Party, which promised to enact a de jure system of apartheid. Victory in De Villiers' constituency (Hottentots-Holland) was the only UP pickup in the election; nevertheless, Graaff took over leadership of the United Party in 1956 from J.G.N. Strauss. He led the opposition to the governments of three apartheid prime ministers, Johannes Strijdom, Hendrik Verwoerd, and B.J. Vorster. He led the opposition to a republic in the 1960 referendum, and stated that South Africa's membership of the Commonwealth was under threat, and the declaration of a republic would lead to South Africa being isolated internationally.Decision to quit was \\"inevitable\\", The Sun-Herald, March 19, 1961 In 1977, the United Party was dissolved and the New Republic Party was founded, of which Graaff briefly served as interim leader before retiring. During his time as leader of the United Party it had split four times and been defeated in five general elections. Sir De Villiers Graaff, 1960 Legacy The M1 highway, which was originally part of a ring road around the southern end of the Central Business District of Johannesburg to the affluent northern suburbs, was named the De Villiers Graaff Motorway in his honour.

The nation launched a $38 billion economic stimulus package in January 2009, with over 80% of the total earmarked for green investment. The Framework Act for Low Carbon Green Growth, passed by Korea's National Assembly in 2010, increased this to $83.6 billion spanning five years. Under this initiative, the Songdo IBD is being developed as a sustainable city with more than 40% of its area reserved for green space, including the park of , of bicycling lanes, numerous charging stations for electric vehicles and a waste collection system that eliminates the need for trash trucks. Also, it is the first district in Korea to have all of its major buildings on par or beyond LEED's requirements. Three additional foreign university campuses opened in 2014, for a total of four total universities located within an international business district some from Seoul, including the first overseas university that opened in Korea, the State University of New York, Stony Brook. The schools will be funded by the Ministry of Knowledge Economy, the Incheon Free Economic Zone and the Incheon Metropolitan Government. The development is part of a $35 billion effort by the Korean government to form an international business district that houses competitive universities from around the world. In spring 2014, George Mason University (Fairfax, Virginia) opened its Korean campus in Songdo to support undergraduate academic interests and professional development programming for local corporations. Additionally, University of Utah anticipated opening a satellite campus in March 2014 with several American bachelor's degrees offered in Social Sciences, along with an M.A. in Applied Linguistics Sustainability Though the city is not yet complete, Songdo IBD is home to 106 LEED certified buildings that fall under 12 projects, or 22 million sq ft of LEED-certified space. This number includes several ‚Äòfirsts‚Äô for LEED in Korea and Asia, including the first LEED- certified hotel in Korea (the Sheraton Incheon), the first certified residential tower in Korea (Central Park 1), and the first certified convention hall in Asia (Convensia). The 50,000 sq ft clubhouse for the Jack Nicklaus Golf Club Korea which hosted the Presidents Cup in 2015 is also certified. Songdo IBD alone represents 40% of all LEED-certified space in South Korea. In addition, Songdo IBD utilizes a pneumatic waste disposal system. This means no garbage cans on street corners, and no garbage trucks. Instead, garbage is thrown into pipes that will suck the garbage underground, disposing of waste, and recycling what can be recycled. There are also 25 km of bike paths and charging stations for electric vehicles throughout the city. \\"Ubiquitous City\\" (Smart City) Songdo IBD was designed and created to be a \\"ubiquitous city\\", a smart city with \\"ubiquitous\\" technology: computers are built into the buildings and streets, while sensors gather information on things like traffic flow and energy use. This kind of information can be converted into alerts that tell citizens when a bus will arrive, or notify the authorities when a crime is taking place. The water pipes are designed to prevent drinkable water from being wasted in showers and toilets. UN Green Climate Fund In October 2012, Songdo IBD was selected to become the home to the United Nations Green Climate Fund (GCF). One of the reasons for selection is the environmental-friendly practices that were incorporated into the city's foundation. Being selected for the GCF marked the first time a large global environmental agency would be hosted in Asia.http://www.korea.net/NewsFocus/Policies/view?articleId=103244 A parallel between The GCF and the World Bank can be drawn, as The GCF offers financial aid to developing countries in their quest to combat climate change. South Korea beat out 5 other competitors for this opportunity, as part of former South Korean President Lee Myung-Bak's initiative for green growth in Korea. The other competing countries were Germany, Switzerland, Mexico, Namibia, and Poland. According to Chief Secretary Kim Sang-hyup, the win for selection came at only 10 days before the decision was due, and mainly because the United States decided to lend its support to Korea. Transportation Songdo IBD has atypically wide roads and has a higher number of bicycle paths and walkways. The district is served by buses and by Incheon Metro Line 1, with six(will add one more station in 2021) stations, some with elegant interiors and interior sky-lit vistas. Although travel to Incheon International Airport is quick with the 12.3 km Incheon Bridge, transportation via subway to Seoul is less direct and requires multiple transfers but two Red classhttp://www.ifez.go.kr/global/biz/contents/CTS_0000000000000190/getContents.do commuter buses offer direct routes to the capital city. Reception In 2003, Birds Korea called for a halt to the reclamation project due to concerns of potential losses of important tidal flats. Prior to reclamation, the Songdo tidal flats had supported several threatened waterbird species, and provided a staging ground for migratory waders as they traveled between the Northern and Southern hemispheres.Last call for Songdo Birds Korea Popular culture Songdo International Business District was heavily featured in episodes 68 and 81 of the South Korean variety show Running Man filmed in 2011 and 2012 respectively. It also provided the backdrop for the music video for \\"Gangnam Style\\" and \\"Right Now\\", by Korean pop star Psy.

It is based on the novel of the same name by Nora Johnson, who co-wrote the screenplay with her father, Nunnally Johnson. The original story was inspired in part by Nora Johnson's own experiences as a schoolgirl, as well as by a real-life incident involving singer Tony Bennett and two teenaged fans. Plot In early 1960s New York City, concert pianist Henry Orient (Peter Sellers) pursues an affair with a married woman, Stella Dunnworthy (Paula Prentiss), while two adolescent private-school girls, Valerie \\"Val\\" Boyd (Tippy Walker) and Marian \\"Gil\\" Gilbert (Merrie Spaeth), stalk him and write their fantasies about him in a diary. Orient's paranoia leads him to believe that the two girls, who seem to pop up everywhere he goes, are spies sent by his would-be mistress's husband. In reality, fourteen-year-old Val, the bright and imaginative daughter of wealthy international trade expert Frank Boyd (Tom Bosley) and his unfaithful, snobbish wife Isabel (Angela Lansbury), has developed a teenage crush on Henry after seeing him in concert, and involved her best friend Marian. Although Marian's parents are divorced, Marian lives a relatively happy and stable life in a townhouse in the city with her mother and her mother's also-divorced female friend, while Val, whose parents are still married (albeit unhappily), sees a psychiatrist daily and lives with paid caretakers while her parents travel the world. Val's parents return for Christmas, and Val becomes concerned that her mother Isabel is having an extramarital affair with a young pianist. Val's interference leads her mother to find and read Val's diary. Isabel chastises Val and seeks out Henry, ostensibly to tell him to stay away from her underage daughter. The cheating Isabel and the womanizing Henry are quickly attracted to each other and begin an affair, which Val and Marian accidentally discover while stalking Henry outside his apartment. Val's devastation and Isabel's attempts to cover up her own behavior cause Frank to figure out what happened. Frank and Isabel separate, while the paranoid Henry flees the country. However, positive changes for Val result as Frank, who unlike Isabel genuinely cares about his daughter, resolves to stop traveling so much and establish a real home where he and Val can spend more time together. In the end, Val and Marian have matured and moved on from fantasy play to makeup, fashion and boys their own age.

By Nora Johnson. 214 pp. Boston: Atlantic-Little, Brown. $3.75. JEAN CAMPBELL JONES. New York Times 10 Aug 1958: BR18. The pianist's unusual surname, \\"Orient\\", came about because Nora Johnson based the character on Oscar Levant, a real- life concert pianist, raconteur, and film actor on whom she had a crush as a teenager. Since the word \\"levant\\" means Orient in French (literally the direction from which the sun rises), the name is a play on words. In the film, several allusions to the pianist's unusual name occur when his two teenage fans put on Chinese conical hats, address their idol as \\"Oriental Henry,\\" kowtow to an Asian-style altar, and adopt vaguely Japanese-sounding names for themselves. Nora Johnson's father Nunally was a noted screenwriter but he said for three years \\"it never occurred to me that it could be filmed, because I couldn't think of two girls to do it. \\"Johnson p 451 Johnson said his point of view changed when he saw Hayley Mills in the film and felt it could be done with Mills and Patty Duke. Johnson decided to write the script on \\"spec\\" and gave it to his agent to sell - one of the rare times in his career he had done this. In April 1962 Nunally Johnson said he wanted to adapt the book into a screenplay for 20th Century Fox.Looking at Hollywood: Nunnally Johnson Wants to Film Daughter's Story Hopper, Hedda. Chicago Daily Tribune 7 Apr 1962: a6. Johnson says his daughter had written a script herself but felt it did not work as she was too inexperienced as a dramatist and too faithful to the book. He purchased the screen rights from her and they agreed to split the screenplay fee fifty-fifty.Johnson p 452-453 United Artists were interested in buying the script. Henry Koster, who had directed several comedies written by Johnson at Fox, read the script and loved it and pressured Richard Zanuck at Fox to buy it; Zanuck was keen but wanted his father Daryl to read it first. Daryl did not get around to reading it and Johnson decided to sell to United Artists. This upset Daryl Zanuck who felt he had been misled and ended the formerly close relationship between him and Johnson.Johnson p 370-371 In April 1963 George Roy Hill announced that he and producer Jerome Hellman had bought the screen rights and would film it for their Pan Arts company which had a deal with United Artists.BY WAY OF REPORT: 'Orient' in Manhattan --Other Film Matters Of 'Charlemagne' By A.

The World of Henry Orient is Spaeth's only film appearance, as she shortly thereafter left acting.

Los Angeles Times 4 Aug 1963: d8. According to a 2012 article in The New Yorker by John Colapinto, director George Roy Hill handpicked Walker from hundreds of actresses who auditioned for the role of \\"Val\\". The filmmakers were so impressed with her performance that they reshaped the film during editing to focus more on her character, and shot the scene of her walking through a snowy Central Park months after production had wrapped. According to Colapinto, in the 2000s Walker revealed through a series of posts on IMDb that she and Hill fell in love during the filming, and that the relationship lasted throughout most of Walker's senior year in high school, despite the fact that Hill was married with children and, at age 44, was nearly 30 years older than Walker. Walker claimed that the resulting Hollywood gossip made others reluctant to cast her and contributed to her decision to stop acting in the early 1970s. Eddie Duchin's son Peter made his acting debut in the film.Peter Duchin Gets Film Role In 'World of Henry Orient' New York Times 28 June 1963: 18. =Shooting= Filming started on July 29, 1963 at the Long Island studios at Roosevelt Field. It wrapped that October. Johnson said Hill made some notable contributions to the film including \\"those runs through the park. He used trampolines and some kind of slow motion, and it gave it a real quality of soaring childhood, released, all the way through. He's one of these dedicated directors, one that takes trouble. I thought he did it beautifully, and I appreciated it.\\"Johnson p 454 Reception The World of Henry Orient premiered at Radio City Music Hall on March 19, 1964. =Awards= It was the official U.S. entry at the 1964 Cannes Film Festival. In 1965 it was nominated for the Golden Globe Award in the category \\"Best Motion Picture, Musical or Comedy\\" and for a Writers Guild of America Award for \\"Best Written American Comedy.\\" =Critical= The film was well-received by critics and has an 88% rating at Rotten Tomatoes. In his review for The New York Times, Bosley Crowther wrote that it was \\"one of the most joyous and comforting movies about teenagers that we've had in a long time\\". It was voted one of the Year's Ten Best Films by the National Board of Review in 1964. Johnson said \\"when I saw the picture, I was just delighted with it.\\" =Box Office= Johnson says the film performed strongly at the box office in New York but struggled elsewhere and failed to return its costs. He and Hill felt that \\"the title was very bad though he didn't realize it then. It conveyed nothing to anybody.\\" Johnson felt that this may have turned children off from going into the film. Johnson also thought Peter Sellers, while funny, played the role too broadly, and that the film would have worked better with Rex Harrison. Musical adaptation A Broadway musical adaptation of The World of Henry Orient called Henry, Sweet Henry, with music and lyrics by Bob Merrill, book by Nunnally Johnson (the father of Nora Johnson), direction by George Roy Hill and choreography by Michael Bennett, opened at the Palace Theatre on October 23, 1967. It starred Don Ameche as Henry Orient, Neva Small as Marian Gilbert, Robin Wilson as Valerie Boyd, Milo Bouton as Mr Boyd, Carol Bruce as Mrs. Boyd and Louise Lasser as Stella. Pia Zadora also appeared in the role of a student. The show ran for 80 performances and closed on December 31, 1967, receiving less than stellar reviews. William Goldman, in his study of the 1967-68 theater year \\"The Season\\", claimed that the musical was of high quality but was old fashioned, and \\"had the misfortune\\" to open just a week after all the critics \\"were overcome by Hair,\\" which had a modern sound. Although the show was not a success, one of its performers, Alice Playten, received a 1968 Theatre World Award, and was nominated for a Tony Award for \\"Best Featured Actress in a Musical\\" for playing the role of Kafritz, which was enlarged substantially for the play. In addition, Michael Bennett was nominated for a Tony for \\"Best Choreography.\\"IBDB Awards See also *List of American films of 1964 References Notes *  External links   * * MGM site with stills, samples from the soundtrack and soundbites of dialogue * Category:1964 films Category:1960s coming-of-age comedy-drama films Category:Adultery in films Category:American coming-of-age comedy-drama films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Films about pianos and pianists Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films directed by George Roy Hill Category:Films scored by Elmer Bernstein Category:Films set in New York City Category:Films shot in New York City Category:Films with screenplays by Nunnally Johnson Category:United Artists films Category:1964 comedy films Category:1964 drama films ","title":"The World of Henry Orient"},{"id":"3683850","text":"The Cardston Alberta Temple (formerly the Alberta Temple) is the eighth constructed and sixth of the still-operating temples of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).

State College Area School District, 240 F.3d 200 (3d Cir. 2001), was a case decided by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit that ruled that the State College Area School District's policy restricting \\"unwelcome\\" and \\"offensive\\" speech on public school grounds violates the First Amendment‚Äôs Free Speech Clause.  Background  The guardian for two students challenged a Pennsylvania school district's anti-harassment policy, contending it violated their First Amendment rights. From a free speech perspective, the guardian held that the policy prohibited students and other citizens from voicing opinions that were constitutionally protected. Fearing that the directors of the State College Area School Board would not listen to their concerns about the Board's proposed anti-harassment policy, a group of local parents approached David Saxe, a Member of the Pennsylvania State Board of Education, to present their objections. The School Board, however, did not respond. Three months later, the School Board scheduled a \\"town meeting\\" to attend to the growing dissent over the proposed policy. Dr. Saxe again attempted to persuade the School Board to revise the policy. He was, however, denied the opportunity when the School Board removed his name from the official speakers list claiming that the list of speakers was too long. In order to limit the number of speakers, the Board held a lottery; Dr. Saxe was not selected as a speaker. Setting the stage for a legal challenge, a month later the School Board passed the policy without revision or recognition of the policy's Constitutional flaws as suggested by Dr. Saxe in his initial presentation to the Board or in subsequent media presentations. In specific, the policy provided several examples of harassment, including: \\"any unwelcome verbal, written or physical conduct which offends, denigrates or belittles an individual\\" because of \\"race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or other personal characteristics.\\" Essentially, any comment/action that was deemed offensive could invoke penalties. The policy protected all individuals in the school and also applied to comments/action of any individual directed at students or school personnel on or outside of school property. The broad and sweeping character of the policy attracted the attention of Constitutional specialists from the legal department of the American Family Association. Believing they had found an ideal test case to expose unconstitutional attempts to curb student speech, AFA lawyers visited State College to discuss legal options with parents. Aligned to the case's First Amendment concerns, David Saxe agreed to take the lead position with the litigation. The District Court in Williamsport supported the School Board's policy. Saxe then appealed to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals seated in Philadelphia. =Panel= *Samuel Alito *Marjorie O. Rendell *John Malcolm Duh√©, Jr.  Decision  In a 3-0 decision, the panel held that such a broadly worded policy prohibits too much speech and violates the First Amendment. The court held that the policy prohibits a substantial amount of speech that is neither vulgar within the meaning of the Fraser standard nor school-sponsored within the meaning of the Hazelwood standard. It even prohibits speech that harasses someone based on \\"clothing, physical appearance, social skills, peer group, intellect, educational program, hobbies, or values.\\" The policy must be judged under the Tinker \\"substantial disruption\\" test. This policy could essentially be applied to any speech that another might find offensive. \\"This could include much 'core' political and religious speech,\\" the panel wrote. \\"The policy, then, appears to cover substantially more speech than could be prohibited under Tinker‚Äôs substantial disruption test.\\" No college, under this legal decision, could successfully be sued for failing to prohibit such speech. Indeed, public campuses are subject to legal liability for failing to protect the First Amendment rights of students. Private campuses that claimed that they believed in free speech but were forced, by law, to restrict it, now can honor their commitment. In short, all campuses now have a strong incentive to abolish such codes. This decision is consistent with the holdings of virtually every other federal appellate court faced with a similar question. The Third Circuit went farther than any other court, however, in drawing the line between legally sanctionable true \\"harassment\\" and speech that, because of its unpopularity, is deemed \\"harassment\\" by school administrators. Although \\"non-expressive, physically harassing conduct is entirely outside the gambit of the free speech clause,\\" the Court held, \\"there is also no question that the free speech clause protects a wide variety of speech that listeners may consider deeply offensive, including statements that impugn another's race or national origin or that denigrate religious beliefs.\\" Warning school authorities against the use of \\"harassment\\" codes to silence speech, the Court noted that \\"where pure expression is involved, anti-discrimination laws steer into the territory of the First Amendment.\\" The Court made clear that harassment laws purporting to prohibit verbal activity \\"that objectively denies a student equal access to a school's educational resources\\"‚Äîthe purpose claimed by proponents of academic speech codes‚Äîare not constitutional when what they actually do is prohibit speech seen as offensive by those who disagree with or are annoyed by it. Furthermore, the claim that the government has the power to curtail speech when it is likely to produce \\"a specific and significant fear of disruption\\" cannot justify the banning of offensive speech in a free society that is protected by the First Amendment. As the Court ruled: \\"The Supreme Court has held time and again, both within and outside the school context, that the mere fact that someone might take offense at the content of speech is not sufficient justification for prohibiting it.\\" =Alito's opinion= \\"No court or legislature has ever suggested that unwelcome speech directed at another's 'values' may be prohibited under the rubric of anti-discrimination. \\"... \\"The plaintiffs in this case challenge the constitutionality of a public school district's 'anti-harassment' policy, arguing that it violates the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech. The District Court, concluding that the policy prohibited no more speech than was already unlawful under federal and state anti-discrimination laws, held that the policy is constitutional and entered judgment for the school district. We reverse.\\" =Rendell's opinion= \\"I write separately only to note my strong disagreement with the notion, espoused by the District Court and discussed at length in Part II.B of the majority opinion, that the judicial analysis of permissible restrictions on speech in a given setting should be affected‚Äîlet alone dictated‚Äîby legislative enactments intended to proscribe activity that could be classified as 'harassment.' Our attempt at reasoning through this postulate should demonstrate its futility, given the numerous variables that impact on any determination regarding the limits of permissible speech and the rigorous analysis that we must follow in every First Amendment case‚Äîthe analysis that our opinion does in fact follow in reaching the result in this case. \\"Perhaps the only way, or time, that such legislation could be a guide would be if its provisions were identical to the policy at issue, or if in a case involving an as-applied challenge to a policy, the legislative provisions addressed every aspect of the particular factual setting at issue. Even then, I submit that it would be the reasoning by a court upholding its constitutionality, rather than the legislation itself, that would provide the necessary guidance. I view the use of harassment legislation as an especially inappropriate barometer here because this case is not a harassment case. Rather, it is framed by appellants as a First Amendment speech case. Moreover, it is a school speech case. While reliance on provisions of harassment laws or policies might be an easy way to resolve difficult cases such as this one, therein lies the rub‚Äîthere are no easy ways in the complex area of First Amendment jurisprudence.\\"  External links  * * Category:United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit cases Category:2001 in United States case law Category:Overbreadth case law Category:2001 in education Category:Education in Centre County, Pennsylvania Category:American Family Association Category:State College, Pennsylvania Category:Student rights case law in the United States ","title":"Saxe v.

It was founded in 1917 and it is the only independent, co-educational primary and secondary school in New Zealand's South Island. Although now a fully co-educational school, it was formerly an all-boys school. It became fully co-educational in 2001. The current rector of St Andrew's College is Christine Leighton. History St Andrew's College was founded by Rev. Alexander Thomas Thompson in 1917 in the Scottish Presbyterian tradition of the Christian faith. St Andrew's College gate column The school began in a humble fashion with 19 boys and four teachers, driven by the determination of the Reverend Thompson, whose driving ambition was to ‚Äòeducate the sons of the Presbyterian and Scottish community of Canterbury.‚Äô StAC had three boarding houses for the 165 boarders of years 9 to 13: MacGibbon (years 9 to 11) and Rutherford (years 11 to 13) for boys, and Thompson (years 9 to 13) for girls. Boarding facilities were damaged in the 2011 Christchurch earthquake; as a result, the boarders have lived in local motels until the new boarding houses were opened at the start of 2013. Thompson and Rutherford houses have been demolished and replaced with brand new state of art boarding facilities while McGibbon House has been refurbished and strengthened. Boarding used to be available for year 7 and 8 students, but is no longer provided. St Andrew's College has four houses: Rutherford, MacGibbon, Thompson and Erwin. On 31 October 2008, the students and teachers of St Andrew's College set a world record for the largest school mass dance with a recital of the YMCA. In 2017, St Andrew's College celebrated its 100th anniversary. In 2020, students of the school reported that a teacher tore down posters and verbally abused them for promoting the Black Lives Matter movement. The school conducted an investigation but did not publish the outcome. Plans The 22 February 2011 Christchurch earthquake severely damaged the school chapel and forced the closure of the school arts block and Strowan house, which both sustained some structural damage, however, most of the schools buildings were relatively undamaged, and the arts block has since been repaired and strengthened. Strowan house has now re-opened, and a new chapel has been built which incorporates design features from the original chapel. In late 2014 Erwin house was demolished to make room for a second gymnasium.

It was introduced by Arnold Sch√∂nhage in his 1982 paper The fundamental theorem of algebra in terms of computational complexity (Technical report, Mathematisches Institut der Universit√§t T√ºbingen). A revised algorithm was presented by Victor Pan in 1998. An implementation was provided by Xavier Gourdon in 1996 for the Magma and PARI/GP computer algebra systems. General description The fundamental idea of the splitting circle method is to use methods of complex analysis, more precisely the residue theorem, to construct factors of polynomials. With those methods it is possible to construct a factor of a given polynomial p(x)=x^n+p_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\\\\cdots+p_0 for any region of the complex plane with a piecewise smooth boundary. Most of those factors will be trivial, that is constant polynomials. Only regions that contain roots of p(x) result in nontrivial factors that have exactly those roots of p(x) as their own roots, preserving multiplicity. In the numerical realization of this method one uses disks D(c,r) (center c, radius r) in the complex plane as regions. The boundary circle of a disk splits the set of roots of p(x) in two parts, hence the name of the method. To a given disk one computes approximate factors following the analytical theory and refines them using Newton's method. To avoid numerical instability one has to demand that all roots are well separated from the boundary circle of the disk. So to obtain a good splitting circle it should be embedded in a root free annulus A(c,r,R) (center c, inner radius r, outer radius R) with a large relative width R/r. Repeating this process for the factors found, one finally arrives at an approximative factorization of the polynomial at a required precision. The factors are either linear polynomials representing well isolated zeros or higher order polynomials representing clusters of zeros. Details of the analytical construction Newton's identities are a bijective relation between the elementary symmetric polynomials of a tuple of complex numbers and its sums of powers. Therefore, it is possible to compute the coefficients of a polynomial :p(x)=x^n+p_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\\\\cdots+p_0=(x-z_1)\\\\cdots(x-z_n) (or of a factor of it) from the sums of powers of its zeros :t_m=z_1^m+\\\\cdots+z_n^m, m=0,1,\\\\dots,n by solving the triangular system that is obtained by comparing the powers of u in the following identity of formal power series : a_{n-1}+2\\\\,a_{n-2}\\\\,u+\\\\cdots+(n-1)\\\\,a_1\\\\,u^{n-2}+n\\\\,a_0\\\\,u^{n-1} : = -(1+a_{n-1}\\\\,u+\\\\cdots+a_1\\\\,u^{n-1}+a_0\\\\,u^n)\\\\cdot(t_1+t_2\\\\,u+t_3\\\\,u^2+\\\\dots+t_n\\\\,u^{n-1}+\\\\cdots). If G\\\\subset\\\\mathbb C is a domain with piecewise smooth boundary C and if the zeros of p(x) are pairwise distinct and not on the boundary C, then from the residue theorem of residual calculus one gets : \\\\frac1{2\\\\pi\\\\,i}\\\\oint_C \\\\frac{p'(z)}{p(z)}z^m\\\\,dz =\\\\sum_{z\\\\in G:\\\\,p(z)=0}\\\\frac{p'(z)z^m}{p'(z)} =\\\\sum_{z\\\\in G:\\\\,p(z)=0}z^m. The identity of the left to the right side of this equation also holds for zeros with multiplicities. By using the Newton identities one is able to compute from those sums of powers the factor :f(x):=\\\\prod_{z\\\\in G:\\\\,p(z)=0}(x-z) of p(x) corresponding to the zeros of p(x) inside G. By polynomial division one also obtains the second factor g(x) in p(x) = f(x)g(x). The commonly used regions are circles in the complex plane. Each circle gives raise to a split of the polynomial p(x) in factors f(x) and g(x). Repeating this procedure on the factors using different circles yields finer and finer factorizations. This recursion stops after a finite number of proper splits with all factors being nontrivial powers of linear polynomials. The challenge now consists in the conversion of this analytical procedure into a numerical algorithm with good running time. The integration is approximated by a finite sum of a numerical integration method, making use of the fast Fourier transform for the evaluation of the polynomials p(x) and p'(x). The polynomial f(x) that results will only be an approximate factor. To ensure that its zeros are close to the zeros of p inside G and only to those, one must demand that all zeros of p are far away from the boundary C of the region G. Basic numerical observation (Sch√∂nhage 1982) Let p\\\\in\\\\mathbb C[X] be a polynomial of degree n which has k zeros inside the circle of radius 1/2 and the remaining n-k zeros outside the circle of radius 2. With N=O(k) large enough, the approximation of the contour integrals using N points results in an approximation f_0 of the factor f with error :\\\\f-f_0\\\\\\\\le 2^{2k-N}\\\\,nk\\\\,100/98, where the norm of a polynomial is the sum of the moduli of its coefficients. Since the zeros of a polynomial are continuous in its coefficients, one can make the zeros of f_0 as close as wanted to the zeros of f by choosing N large enough. However, one can improve this approximation faster using a Newton method. Division of p with remainder yields an approximation g_0 of the remaining factor g. Now :p-f_0g_0=(f-f_0)g_0+(g-g_0)f_0+(f-f_0)(g-g_0), so discarding the last second order term one has to solve p-f_0g_0=f_0\\\\Delta g+g_0\\\\Delta f using any variant of the extended Euclidean algorithm to obtain the incremented approximations f_1=f_0+\\\\Delta f and g_1=g_0+\\\\Delta g. This is repeated until the increments are zero relative to the chosen precision. Graeffe iteration The crucial step in this method is to find an annulus of relative width 4 in the complex plane that contains no zeros of p and contains approximately as many zeros of p inside as outside of it. Any annulus of this characteristic can be transformed, by translation and scaling of the polynomial, into the annulus between the radii 1/2 and 2 around the origin. But, not every polynomial admits such a splitting annulus. To remedy this situation, the Graeffe iteration is applied. It computes a sequence of polynomials :p_0=p,\\\\qquad p_{j+1}(x)=(-1)^{\\\\deg p}p_j(\\\\sqrt x)\\\\,p_j(-\\\\sqrt x), where the roots of p_j(x) are the 2^j-th dyadic powers of the roots of the initial polynomial p. By splitting p_j(x)=e(x^2)+x\\\\,o(x^2) into even and odd parts, the succeeding polynomial is obtained by purely arithmetic operations as p_{j+1}(x)=(-1)^{\\\\deg p}(e(x)^2-x\\\\,o(x)^2). The ratios of the absolute moduli of the roots increase by the same power 2^j and thus tend to infinity. Choosing j large enough one finally finds a splitting annulus of relative width 4 around the origin. The approximate factorization of p_j(x)\\\\approx f_j(x)\\\\,g_j(x) is now to be lifted back to the original polynomial. To this end an alternation of Newton steps and Pad√© approximations is used. It is easy to check that :\\\\frac{p_{j-1}(x)}{g_j(x^2)}\\\\approx \\\\frac{f_{j-1}(x)}{g_{j-1}(-x)} holds. The polynomials on the left side are known in step j, the polynomials on the right side can be obtained as Pad√© approximants of the corresponding degrees for the power series expansion of the fraction on the left side. Finding a good circle Making use of the Graeffe iteration and any known estimate for the absolute value of the largest root one can find estimates R of this absolute value of any precision. Now one computes estimates for the largest and smallest distances R_j>r_j>0 of any root of p(x) to any of the five center points 0, 2R, ‚àí2R, 2Ri, ‚àí2Ri and selects the one with the largest ratio R_j/r_j between the two. By this construction it can be guaranteed that R_j/r_j>e^{0{.}3}\\\\approx 1.35 for at least one center. For such a center there has to be a root-free annulus of relative width \\\\textstyle e^{0{.}3/n}\\\\approx 1+\\\\frac{0{.}3}{n}. After \\\\textstyle 3+\\\\log_2(n) Graeffe iterations, the corresponding annulus of the iterated polynomial has a relative width greater than 11 > 4, as required for the initial splitting described above (see Sch√∂nhage (1982)). After \\\\textstyle 4+\\\\log_2(n)+\\\\log_2(2+\\\\log_2(n)) Graeffe iterations, the corresponding annulus has a relative width greater than \\\\textstyle 2^{13{.}8}\\\\cdot n^{6{.}9}>(64\\\\cdot n^3)^2, allowing a much simplified initial splitting (see Malajovich/Zubelli (1997)) To locate the best root-free annulus one uses a consequence of the Rouch√© theorem: For k = 1, ..., n ‚àí 1 the polynomial equation :\\\\,0=\\\\sum_{j e k}p_ju^j-p_ku^k, u > 0, has, by Descartes' rule of signs zero or two positive roots u_k. In the latter case, there are exactly k roots inside the (closed) disk D(0,u_k) and A(0,u_k,v_k) is a root-free (open) annulus.

John Hodiak plays a villain in this production, just his third movie role. Jimmy Dorsey and his Orchestra provide musical interludes. Plot Skelton plays an \\"average Joe\\" who is madly in love with Constance Shaw (Eleanor Powell), a big Broadway musical star. Much to his surprise, Constance agrees to marry him, thinking he's a rich mining tycoon, and much of the film deals with the consequences of this misunderstanding.

Powell, in her introduction to the book Gotta Sing, Gotta Dance, recalled that she knocked herself unconscious while rehearsing a stunt for this sequence involving a rope and ultimately had to don a football helmet to protect herself. The final dance scene with Powell was taken from Born to Dance (1936). Many of the physical gags were done by Buster Keaton in the film Spite Marriage (1929). Keaton had an uncredited role in writing gags for some of Skelton's early MGM films. Skelton and Powell had previously worked together in Ship Ahoy (1942). In that film, they appeared with Tommy Dorsey, Jimmy's brother. This was Powell's final starring role at MGM. After this, she would make a cameo appearance in Thousands Cheer, play a lead role in the United Artists film Sensations of 1945, and return to MGM for a cameo in Duchess of Idaho (1950) before retiring from the screen for good. The rather ungrammatical title was from one of Red Skelton's radio catchphrases of the day. In 1942 Jack Owens, The Cruising Crooner, wrote a song for Skelton based on it: \\"I Dood It! (If I Do, I Get a Whippin')\\", but that song does not appear in this film. The film opens with the Jimmy Dorsey orchestra performing Count Basie's \\"One O'Clock Jump\\". As the tempo and energy of the music increases several couples can be seen dancing in the confined space in front of their theater seats, and other fans leave their seats to stand in front of the band stage. Dance direction in the film was by Bobby Connolly, and the \\"Western Rope Dance,\\" assisted by Bob Eberly and Jimmy Dorsey's Orchestra, is the second scene in the film. Box office According to MGM records the film earned $1,615,000 in the US and Canada and $542,000 elsewhere resulting in a profit of $319,000.

Synopsis  While passing through the town of Caoqiao, the famous Song Dynasty official Bao Zheng is stopped by a villager on behalf of his blind mother. Bao discovers that the blind woman was Consort Li, a concubine of the late Emperor Zhenzong. Twenty years ago, right after Li gave birth to a son, a jealous rival Consort Liu conspired with eunuch Guo Huai to have the infant swapped with a dead civet. She then ordered her maid Kou Zhu to throw the baby into the river. At the Jinshui Bridge, a hesitant Kou was approached by eunuch Chen Lin. Chen was able to carry the infant to Eighth Imperial Prince, one of Zhenzong's brothers, who raised the baby as one of his own. Eventually the baby became crown prince as Zhenzong had no other sons. As a result of giving birth to a monster, Li was banished to Yu Chen Palace, while Liu was elevated to the status of Empress. One day, the 10-year-old crown prince wandered to the forbidden palace and met Li. Liu came upon them and became suspicious. She convinced Zhenzong that Li was cursed and needed to be burned to death along with her palace. Kou ran off to warn Li and was interrogated harshly when she returned. After Kou killed herself by slamming into a pillar, Guo and the soldiers went to Yu Chen Palace to carry out the burning order, when they saw a hanged body with Li's clothing. Unbeknownst to them, eunuch Yu Zhong had sacrificed himself, allowing Li to escape. The crown prince had become Emperor Renzong, and Bao uses the Lantern Festival for an opportunity to tell him the story. Then, Bao tricks Guo to the Kaifeng court but Guo stubbornly refuses to confess. Playing on Guo's fear of the supernatural, Bao invokes the \\"Ghost of Kou Zhu\\" to finally get a confession. Liu is ordered to commit suicide while Renzong welcomes his mother back to the palace.

She served as a supply ship from 1897 to 1941, and gave her name to the shore station HMS Tamar in Hong Kong (1897 to 1997). History The 1863 incarnation of HMS Tamar was the fourth to bear that name, which is derived from the River Tamar, in Cornwall, and the ship's crest is based on its coat of arms. Built in Cubitt Town in East London, she was launched in June 1863, and began her maiden voyage on 12 January 1864 as a troopship to the Cape and China.Eric Cavaliero, Harbour bed holds memories , The Standard, 13 November 1997 On 13 December 1866, Tamar ran aground off Haulbowline, County Cork. Tamar was refloated on 17 December. Tamar was dual-powered with masts and a steam engine, giving a speed of . She originally had two funnels, but she was re-equipped with a more advanced boiler and reduced to one funnel. In 1874, she formed part of the Naval Brigade that helped to defeat the Ashanti in West Africa, during the Ashanti War. Tamar took part in the bombardment of Alexandria in 1882. In 1879, The British Medical Journal reported a group of sailors aboard Tamar were poisoned by a bad pigeon pie which spawned an Admiralty investigation. HMS Tamar (white vessel) anchored off the Naval Dockyard (1905) The purported anchor of HMS Tamar, located at the Hong Kong Museum of Coastal Defence In 1897 Tamar was hulked as a base ship and relieved HMS Victor Emmanuel as the Hong Kong receiving ship. She was used as a base ship until replaced by the shore station, which was named HMS Tamar, after the ship. Tamar had been towed out to a buoy on 8 December during the Battle of Hong Kong during World War II. Amidst a curfew of darkness and bombardment by the Imperial Japanese forces, the orders came at 2100 hours on 11 December to scuttle her. She was scuttled at the buoy on 12 December 1941 once it was clear that the advance could not be arrested, to avoid being used by the invading Japanese forces. As the ship's superstructure became airlocked, the ship refused to sink for some time, until the Royal Artillery was called in to administer the coup de gr√¢ce. Over the years, legends state that a mast from the ship was erected outside Murray House in Stanley, and that wood planks salvaged from the ship were turned into the main doors of St. John's Cathedral in the city's Central district. The veracity of both legends, however, has been challenged. In late 2014, during dredging work for the Central‚ÄìWan Chai Bypass, the remains of what strongly appears to be Tamar were discovered at the location of the old Wan Chai Ferry Pier where she is believed to have been scuttled. A government report, completed in September 2015 but released on the government's website in February 2017, finds strong evidence that the remains are those of Tamar.

This resolution marked the earliest attempt to establish a Government of Canada policy requesting the sovereign not to grant knighthoods, baronetcies, and peerages to Canadians and set the precedent for later policies restricting Canadians from accepting titles from foreign countries. Dissatisfaction with the British honours system led to the gradual creation of a separate system for Canada. The Nickle Resolution The Nickle Resolution was a motion brought forward in 1917 by Conservative M.P. William Folger Nickle in the House of Commons of Canada. There had been controversy before the end of World War I over the honouring of Canadians‚Äîespecially the appointment of Sam Hughes as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (a non-hereditary honour) in 1915 and the elevation of Hugh Graham as the Baron Atholstan (a hereditary honour)‚Äîand the qualifications of recipients. Prime Minister Sir Robert Borden disapproved of the process by which Canadians were nominated for honours and in March 1917 drafted a policy stating that all names had to be vetted by the prime minister before the list was sent to Westminster. Nickle, however, at the same time, alleged that the granting of hereditary titles to Canadians was itself inconsistent with democratic values. Nickle's detractors, however, charged him with being motivated more by spite and chagrin over his failed attempt to obtain a knighthood for his father-in-law, Daniel Gordon, the principal of Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. Regardless, Nickle successfully moved a resolution through the House calling for an address to be made to King George V requesting that he no longer grant hereditary peerages and knighthoods to Canadians and that all such titles held by Canadians become extinct upon the death of the incumbent. The motion was carried by the House of Commons, though Nickle himself voted against the version passed; it was not advanced to the Senate, and no address to the King was ever made. Beginning in 1919, the press reported on the selling of honours in the United Kingdom and there was a fear that the British government would honour a large number of Canadians for their service in the First World War by appointing them to titled classes in the newly created Order of the British Empire. In that context, Nickle again put a motion forward in the lower house of parliament, calling on the King to \\"hereafter be graciously pleased to refrain from conferring any titles upon your subjects domiciled or living in Canada\\", thus expanding the earlier resolution of 1917 to include even non-hereditary titles. The Commons voted to create a special committee to look at the question of honours and it concluded that the King should be asked to cease conferring \\"any title of honour or titular distinction ... save such appellations as are of a professional or vocational character or which appertain to an office\\". Titular honours from foreign governments were also to be banned. However, bravery and valour decorations, such as the Victoria Cross and Military Cross, were exempt. Although the second Nickle Resolution was adopted by the House of Commons, it was also not forwarded to the Senate, where it was expected to be defeated, as it touched on the royal prerogative, a constitutional matter outside the competence of the House of Commons alone. As a resolution, rather than an Act of Parliament or Order in Council, the Nickle Resolution would not have been legally binding on the government. It nonetheless established a policy precedent (with a varying degree of enforcement), that has not been challenged by the Senate of Canada. After the resolution Continentalist and nationalist forces in Canada's political life grew in strength through the 1920s. The government led by William Lyon Mackenzie King insisted on an end to imperial practices, such as the British government ultimately appointing Canadian governors general, and demanded practical recognition of the equality between Britain and the Dominions and the latter's autonomy, as set out by the Balfour Declaration of 1926. The Nickle Resolution was recognized as policy during Mackenzie King's tenure as prime minister and was entrenched in government practice by the time Mackenzie King retired in 1948. However, in February 1929, another debate was held in the House of Commons on the question of titular honours, specifically on the question of whether the Nickle Resolution ought to be reconsidered. Mackenzie King, on 12 February 1929, stated in the Commons: > If we are to have no titles, titular distinctions or honours in Canada, let > us hold to the principle and have none, let us abolish them altogether; but > if the sovereigns or heads of other countries are to be permitted to bestow > honours on Canadians, for my part I think we owe it to our own sovereign to > give him that prerogative before all others. The motion was defeated on 14 February 1929.  Granting of honours resumed  On 30 January 1934, Prime Minister R. B. Bennett said, when speaking about the Nickle Resolution and the shelf-life of Canadian parliamentary resolutions (Canadian Hansard): Moreover, as a matter touching the royal prerogative, R. B. Bennett had already reported to the House of Commons the previous year, on 17 May 1933 (Hansard, p. 5126) that the Nickle Resolution was of no force or of null effect, stating: On 30 January 1934, in speaking about his responsibility as Prime Minister to advise the King as the King's first minister, and about his own advice to the King that as prime minister he wished to continue the custom of advising the King to bestow royal honours on Canadian subjects (which Conservative and Liberal administrations had chosen not to exercise for almost 15 years), Prime Minister Bennett said: To these official statements of Prime Minister R. B. Bennett can be added what he wrote in a 1934 letter to J. R. MacNicol, MP when he stated his view that: Moreover, as Bennett stated to Parliament about the Nickle Resolution (see Hansard): R. B. Bennett's government submitted honours lists to the King every year from 1933 until its defeat in 1935, recommending that various prominent Canadians receive knighthoods, including the Chief Justice of Canada, Sir Lyman Poore Duff, Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Commissioner Sir James Howden MacBrien, Sir Frederick Banting, the discoverer of insulin, and Sir Ernest MacMillan, composer and conductor.Listed at http://www.blatherwick.net/british%20orders%20to%20canadians/ \\"#02 -- Index to Canadians who have been Knighted\\" When a vote was called on 14 March 1934, on a private member's (Humphrey Mitchell, Labour, East Hamilton) resolution to require the prime minister to cease making recommendations to the King for titles, this renewed Nickle-like Resolution was defeated 113 to 94. The House of Commons of Canada, by this vote, refused to reaffirm or reinstate the Nickle Resolution or its attempts to prevent the Prime Minister's involvement in the exercise of the royal prerogative of granting titles to Canadians. This is the last time that the lower house of Parliament ever voted on the issue. Mackenzie King reaffirms ban When William Lyon Mackenzie King returned to power in 1935, he ignored the precedent set by Bennett's government, and resumed the former policy. The no-honours policy of successive Canadian governments has been in effect ever since. However, no attempt was made to forbid the use of the titular honours by those who had been granted them by the King at Bennett's recommendation. In 1938 Bennett moved to England, and in 1941 he was elevated to the British House of Lords, as the first \\"Viscount Bennett, of Mickleham in the County of Surrey and of Hopewell and Calgary in Canada\\". London Gazette, 22 July 1941. Modern policy In 1968, Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson's government published Regulations respecting the acceptance and wearing by Canadians of Commonwealth and foreign orders, decorations and medals. These policies were again affirmed in 1988 when the government of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney published Policy Respecting the Awarding of an Order, Decoration or Medal by a Commonwealth or Foreign Government. Conrad Black vs Jean Chr√©tien The best-known modern application of the Nickle Resolution occurred when Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien attempted to use it to prevent Canadian publishing mogul Conrad Black from becoming a British life peer. Chr√©tien held that, in spite of the fact that the British government was honouring Black as a British citizen, and that Black then held dual citizenship of Canada and Britain (allowed since 1977), he as Prime Minister of Canada had the right to keep Black from becoming a British life peer because he was also a Canadian citizen. The Ontario Court of Appeal ruled in favour of Chr√©tien ‚Äì but Ontario courts have no jurisdiction outside of Ontario, and no Canadian courts have any jurisdiction in the United Kingdom or any other nation. In the end, Black resolved the matter by renouncing his Canadian citizenship. This made him a British citizen only, so there was no question that Canada had no voice in denying him a British honour. Exceptions and anomalies Even in the immediate aftermath of the Nickle Resolution, titular honours were granted to subjects of the King who remained residents of Canada, and such honours were passed on to their legal inheritors. The Nickle Resolution was not an effective instrument to establish Canada's desire to end the granting of titular honours to Canadians. It would take later prime ministers to do that. The prime minister at the time of the resolution, Sir Robert Laird Borden, GCMG, had been knighted in 1914, five years before the adoption of the resolution: but he was away from Canada (attending the Versailles Peace Conference) when the House of Commons considered Nickle's resolution in 1919. Canadian steel magnate Sir James Hamet Dunn was created a baronet by King George V, Emperor of India, on 13 January 1921, and his son Sir Philip Dunn, 2nd Baronet, inherited his father's baronetcy. At the time, the same parliament that had adopted the Nickle Resolution was still in session. It follows that such a resolution, had it had any binding nature, would have been in effect at least until the dissolution of the 13th parliament on 14 October 1921. The Government of Canada made no objection when, near the end of the Second World War, British prime minister, Winston Churchill, recommended that the King bestow a knighthood on Sir William Stephenson. Churchill described the honour he sought from the King for Stephenson as \\"one dear to my heart\\", such was Churchill's sense of gratitude for Stephenson's wartime intelligence work. Years later, Sir William was given Canada's then highest honour in being made a Companion of the Order of Canada in 1979. Also honoured with knighthood following the Nickle Resolution was Sir Frederick Banting, the Canadian medical doctor who co-won the Nobel Prize for Medicine for the discovery of insulin. This knighthood was awarded by King George V in 1934. Another significant example of government indecision over the matter of titular honours involves former Canadian governor general Vincent Massey. While on a visit to Canada in August 1954, The Duke of Edinburgh told Massey the Queen wished to make him a Knight of the Garter, the most senior of the orders of chivalry she could bestow. Massey would have been the first non-Briton and non-Irish person to receive the Garter, other than foreign heads of state and foreign royalty. Then-prime minister Louis St. Laurent was cool to the proposal, but agreed to take the matter under advisement. Shortly after coming to power in 1957, John Diefenbaker was initially receptive, but ultimately changed his mind and so informed the Queen in 1960. Just weeks later, the Queen honoured Massey with the rarer (but non- titular) Royal Victorian Chain. A different example was that of Sir Ted Leather, KCMG, KCVO, LLD, the Toronto-born Governor of Bermuda. He arrived in Britain with the Canadian Army in 1940, and stayed on after World War II to become a Conservative Member of Parliament. After the murder of Sir Richard Sharples, the Bermudian viceroy, Sir Ted was appointed to the vacant colonial governorship at the recommendation of the government of British Prime Minister Edward Heath. When Sir Ted was knighted in 1962, since he had not lived in Canada since 1940 (and Canadian citizenship was not defined as distinct from British until the Canadian Citizenship Act 1946) he was not made to renounce his citizenship in his native country. In addition to this extraterritorial anomaly, even today the Governor General of Canada is actively involved in the creation of knights and dames via presiding over the Canadian branch of the Order of St John, conferring knighthoods and damehoods on some of its members in ceremonies at which the governor general performs the act of investing new recipients with their honour. However, this honour does not use the usual knightly accolade of Sir or Dame followed by their personal and family names and the claim is made that the honour of knighthood or damehood is conferred without the Queen or her governor general's concession of any appellative accolade, thus avoiding the bestowal of any titular honour. During the premiership of Tony Blair, at least two persons holding British citizenship were granted titular honours by the Crown before the Black peerage issue, which brought the matter to the Canadian prime minister's attention. On 2 November 1999, Canadian Senator Anne Cools brought to the Senate of Canada's notice the discrepancy in policy on orders for English Canadians and orders for French Canadians: In addition, on 4 November 1999, she brought to the Senate's notice the fact that in the first decade alone after the Nickle Resolution was debated, there were In February 2004, the Department of International Trade announced the impending visit to Sydney of Sir Terry Matthews, dual citizen of the United Kingdom and Canada, with a press release that included the following passage: \\"Sir Terry is the Chairman of Mitel Networks. ... In 1994, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire and was awarded a knighthood in the Queen's Birthday Honours, 2001.\\" Some Canadian title holders do not employ their British- or French-derived titles in Canada. One such example being Kenneth Thomson, who, from his father's death in 1976 until his own death in 2006, held the hereditary peerage Baron Thomson of Fleet. Thomson once stated in an interview \\"In London I'm Lord Thomson, in Toronto I'm Ken. I have two sets of Christmas cards and two sets of stationery. You might say I'm having my cake and eating it too. I'm honouring a promise to my father by being Lord Thomson, and at the same time I can just be Ken.\\" Other Commonwealth countries Commonwealth countries such as the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Jamaica, and Papua New Guinea still confer titular honours. In recent years, however, the latter two have generally opted to bestow national orders of similar standing, offering membership in the Order of the National Hero of Jamaica and Order of the Logohu as alternatives which come with their own styles of Right Excellent and Chief or Grand Chief, respectively. Appointment to the highest rank of the New Zealand Order of Merit grants members the right to use the titles sir or dame. However, between 2000 and 2009, during the premiership of Helen Clark, the conferral of knighthoods and damehoods was temporarily discontinued, with the two higher grades of the order being replaced with postnominals to indicate membership, more like the one-grade Order of New Zealand. In March 2009, John Key requested to Elizabeth II that the order be resumed at the pre-2000 grades and granting of knighthoods and damehoods was continued. As in Australia, the Queen continues to make titular awards in the Royal Victorian Order, the Order of the Thistle, and the Order of the Garter, since these orders are within the sovereign's prerogative. New Zealanders who received New Zealand's former titular honours prior to 2000 may continue to employ them and those New Zealanders who received the equivalent postnominals between 2000 and 2008 were allowed to exchange them for the restored titles if they so chose. Australia retained access to the Imperial (British) honours system until October 1992 with the 1983 New Year Honours being the last awards recommended by the federal government. The last awards recommended by state governments were in 1989. The Order of Australia (analogous to the Order of Canada) was established in 1975 without knighthoods and damehoods. Knighthoods and damehoods were introduced in 1976 and discontinued in 1983, re-established in 2014, and discontinued again in 2015. The Queen of Australia, in her personal capacity, retains the ability to appoint Australian citizens as knights or dames of the Order of the Garter, the Order of the Thistle, and the Royal Victorian Order, an act solely within the sovereign's personal discretion, her Australian ministers having no involvement. The Australian Order of Wear states that awards conferred by the Sovereign in exercise of the Royal Prerogative are treated as Australian and not foreign awards.

The 6'7\\" shooting guard from Dolton, Illinois played with five different NBA teams over a 10-year span and has had a 20-year international basketball career. College After starring at Thornridge High School, Mack signed with Iowa State, where he started and averaged 11.8 points as a freshman for a Cyclones team that would make the 1989 NCAA tournament before losing to UCLA. Mack was arrested and charged with armed robbery in Ames, Iowa in March 1989 when he participated in a holdup at a Burger King. Mack was shot in the foot and hip as he tried to flee police. He was later acquitted when a jury decided that Iowa State football player Levin White, a transfer from USC, had forced him at gunpoint to be his accomplice. Cyclone coach Johnny Orr did not renew Mack's basketball scholarship and he transferred to Arizona State as one of coach Bill Frieder's first recruits. In November 1989, he was suspended from the ASU team during his redshirt season after being investigated in connection with a sexual assault. No charges were filed after the Maricopa County attorney's office found insufficient evidence to pursue a woman's claim that Mack raped her in a university dormitory. in March 1990 Mack and a former Arizona State football player, Fedel Underwood, were arrested and charged with credit card fraud after trying to buy jewelry with a stolen card. Frieder dismissed Mack from the team before he ever played in a game for the Sun Devils.http://articles.latimes.com/1991-12-06/sports/sp-682_1_sam-mack After Mack's dismissal from ASU, assistant George McQuarn recommended him to Roy Thomas, the coach at Tyler Junior College. Finally with Thomas, a noted disciplinarian, and in relative obscurity in East Texas Mack was a good fit. He averaged 24.6 points and 8.7 rebounds for the Apaches in '90-'91, hitting 62% from the field and 42% from three-point range. More importantly, after two years marked by serious run-ins with the law, Mack stayed out of trouble and was recommended to Houston coach Pat Foster. Because of Mack's checkered past, Foster had Mack vetted by both the UH athletic director and university president, who both interviewed Mack and gave their approval. Mack's final collegiate season was a huge success, as he averaged 17.5 points in 31 games for the Cougars 1991-92 and, along with Bo Outlaw and Anthony Goldwire, led them to a 25-6 record and an NCAA Tournament appearance. For his efforts, Mack was named the SWC Newcomer of the Year. Professional career After going undrafted in 1992, Mack played in the USBL with the New Haven Skyhawks in 1992. He signed as a free agent by the San Antonio Spurs in September 1992 and played in 40 games as a reserve (6.7 mpg) during the '92-'93 season before being waived. He spent the next three years playing in the CBA and being named to the 1995‚Äì96 CBA All-League Second Team. Mack appeared in 119 career CBA games, averaging 16.1 ppg, 3.5 rpg and 2.0 apg. Mack got his big chance to show what he could do at the NBA level in 1996 when he began the year in the CBA playing for the Rockford Lightning, averaging 20.7 points and 4.3 rebounds. This performance attracted the attention of the back-to-back NBA Champion Houston Rockets, who had recently lost Clyde Drexler to injury and signed Mack to two 10-day contracts in February 1996. Mack came through for the Rockets by averaging 10.8 points and 3.2 rebounds, playing in 31 games and making 20 starts. His first career NBA start came on February 27 against Toronto and he scored 11 points in 34 minutes. Mack scored in double figures 13 times, including four games of 20 points or more. He scored a career-high 38 points against Golden State on April 2, and also had games of 26 points vs. Phoenix on April 21 and 25 points at Seattle on April 3. He shot 54-for-135 from three-point range (40%). Mack appeared in six of Houston's eight playoff games, helping them beat the Los Angeles Lakers in the first round. Mack was traded by the Rockets to the Vancouver Grizzlies for a second-round draft pick in October 1997. He became the Grizzlies' starting shooting guard, averaging 10.8 ppg in '97-'98 and 12.7 pg in '98-'99. Mack was ranked 8th in the NBA in three-pointers made (87), 14th in three-pointers attempted (214) and 17th in three-point percentage (.397) in 1999. Set Grizzlies' franchise records with 8 three-pointers in 13 attempts, scoring a game-high 26 points, in a 96-92 win over the Dallas Mavericks on 2/14/99. Led the Grizzlies in 1997-98 and established career-highs in three-pointers made (110) and attempted (269). Because of his prolific shooting, Mack was invited to compete in the AT&T; Shootout during the 1998 NBA All-Star Weekend in New York. Mack was traded back to the Rockets by the Grizzlies for Rodrick Rhodes in March 1999 but would never be a regular NBA starter again. He signed as a free agent by the Golden State Warriors in January 2000 but was waived in late March of that season. Played in the CBA and IBL with the Grand Rapids Hoops in 2000‚Äì01 before signing as a free agent by the Miami Heat on 9/14/01. He played in 12 games for Miami and made one start. Mack started in 105 of the 259 NBA games in which he appeared. He averaged 8 points, 2.1 rebounds, and 1.3 assists in his NBA career. Over the next 10 years Mack played for several teams both in the US and abroad, having success well into his late 30s. Mack currently plays for the ABA's Chicago Steam. He was named to the ABA's all-star team in 2010 and 2011, at the age of 40.

It is owned by the Church of Scientology and was built principally to deliver the Super Power Rundown, a high-level Scientology training course intended to train Scientologists to use all of their 57 \\"perceptics\\" or senses. The interior of the building contains training suites, course rooms, theaters and various devices intended to test \\"perceptics,\\" including a \\"time machine\\", an anti-gravity simulator, an \\"infinite\\" pit, and a pain station. The complex occupies a city block at 215 South Fort Harrison Avenue. It includes a 15-story tower topped by a bronze Scientology cross visible from much of Clearwater. Construction began in 1998, was halted in 2003, and was ultimately resumed to reach substantial completion during 2011. The long delay in construction led to substantial fines being levied by the city authorities. The building is valued at $80 million and at least $145 million was raised by Church fundraising towards the project. The church denies accusations that the Flag Building's completion was deliberately delayed so that it could serve as a cash cow. The Church of Scientology announced in August 2013 that the building would be opened to the public on October 6, 2013, with a dedication ceremony that the church estimated would attract approximately 10,000 Scientologists. However, a month later it emerged that the Church had canceled the ceremony and postponed the opening of the building. The building finally opened on November 17, 2013. Purpose The Church states the Super Power Building provides a dedicated center for delivering the Super Power Rundown, a high-level Scientology training course that has not yet been released. The Super Power Rundown was described by Scientology's founder, L. Ron Hubbard, as Hubbard wrote that \\"Super Power is the answer to a sick, a dying and dead society. With it, we literally revive the dead.\\" A Church of Scientology statement says that \\"Super Power is a series of spiritual counseling processes designed to give a person back his own viewpoint, increase his perception, exercise his power of choice, and greatly enhance other spiritual abilities.\\" The St. Petersburg Times reports that Scientologist Matt Feshbach, a multimillion-dollar donor who is one of the few who has done Super Power, now feels that he \\"senses danger faster than most people. He appreciates beauty more deeply than he used to. He says he outperforms his peers in the money management industry.\\" Feshbach says that he has become \\"a more competent spiritual being. I'm not dependent on my physical body to perceive things.\\" =Perceptics= The Church of Scientology's in- house magazine Source has promoted the program as being aimed \\"to shift the creation of a new civilization into overdrive\\". According to Source, \\"this is the powerful series of rundowns that will move every Scientologist, at any level of The Bridge, into an entirely new realm of ability. It's here one will progress through the drilling stations of the Perceptic Rundown. And when it comes to the future, here's the likes of which has never even been conceived of on this planet.\\" The 57 \\"perceptics\\" (senses) covered by the rundown are: Artist's rendering of training equipment to be used for delivering Super Power rundowns.\\"An entirely new universe - ideal in every detail\\", Source magazine, issue 194, September 2007, pp. 40-41. According to the Church of Scientology, the building will contain specially developed equipment which \\"expand[s] on technology developed by NASA to train astronauts\\" designed to exercise and enhance an individual's \\"perceptics\\". These machines will include such things as an antigravity simulator, a gyroscope-like apparatus that spins a person around while blindfolded to improve perception of compass direction, and a video screen that moves forward and backward while flashing images to hone a viewer's ability to identify subliminal messages. According to Marc Headley, who worked on developing the \\"perceptics\\", Scientologists will have to undergo testing on each of them. For Smell, for example, there are \\"hundreds and hundreds of vials of distinct smells that did not evaporate. You name it, bananas, peppermint, sunflowers, any smell that you can think of, they had it in a vial. Some of the smells were very similar, like oranges, tangerines, orange peel, orange juice, you had to tell the difference and until you could name each and every one correctly, you did not finish this perceptic.\\" Leaked blueprints of the building's interior include facilities such as a \\"time machine\\", an \\"oiliness table\\", a \\"pain station\\" and an \\"infinite pit\\". Scientologists undergoing Super Power training in the building will be \\"spun on a gyroscope-like wheel, spend time in a sound chamber, sniff vials emitting fragrances and experience changes in gravitational pull.\\" According to Headley, the \\"insanely loud\\" anti-gravity simulator was nicknamed the \\"Barfitron\\".Headley, p. 190 Design Front entrance of Flag Building At , the building is the largest property in Clearwater. It was originally budgeted to cost $24 million, but the cost has more than doubled to an estimated $50 million after repeated redesigns of the interior. According to the building plans, the Super Power Building will feature a grand lobby lined with sculptures depicting aspects of Scientology; theaters for training and introductory films; a museum honoring the Sea Org; and a separate museum honoring Scientology's founder, L. Ron Hubbard. The sixth floor will house an indoor running track for Scientologists undergoing the Purification Rundown detoxification program. The Mediterranean Revival-style building will also contain a bookstore, a library, and hundreds of course and study rooms; with a total of 889 rooms, 447 windows, and 42 bathrooms, plus an 1,140-seat dining room and two kitchens. A 124-foot (38 m) bridge connects the Super Power Building to the Scientology-owned Fort Harrison Hotel on the other side of S. Fort Harrison Avenue. In January 2012, Tony Ortega of the Village Voice published leaked blueprints of the Super Power Building that revealed architectural features including a recreation of a deck on the Apollo, L. Ron Hubbard's flagship in the 1960s. Fundraising The building was financed through a fundraising effort called the \\"Super Power Expansion Project.\\" A fundraising letter sent to Scientologists in March 2002 described the purpose of the project: Contributions to the project are on a sliding scale with \\"titles\\" that are fancied among adherents awarded as prizes according to the level of donations. These range from the starting level, \\"Flag Supporter\\" (a $1,000 donation), to the mid-ranking \\"Master Builder of Merit\\" ($500,000) and so on up to the \\"Legion of OT Meritorious\\" ($7,500,000).\\"Super Power Expansion Project Gift Form\\". Church of Scientology Religious Trust, 2006 According to a Scientology magazine published in September 2007, Scientologist actress Kirstie Alley is ranked as a \\"Founding Member\\" of the project, indicating a $250,000 donation.\\"FLAG Experience\\". Source Magazine, issue 193, Pages 36-37, September 2007 The actress Catherine Bell has also contributed and is ranked as a \\"Double Cornerstone Member\\" (twice the normal \\"cornerstone\\" donation of $35,000 - i.e., $70,000).\\"People at Flag\\". Source Magazine, Issue 196, December 2007, pages 24-25 The project's July 2004 \\"Cornerstone Newsletter\\", lists 1,218 members contributing a total of just under $89 million;\\"Cornerstone Newsletter\\", Church of Scientology Religious Trust, July 2004 by 2007, the total had risen to over $142 million.\\"Cornerstone Newsletter\\", Church of Scientology Religious Trust, undated but published 2007 Some individual Scientologists have given up to $5 million each. Scientologists contributing to the project are given a number of benefits depending on the level of their contributions, including \\"gold validation pins\\" and \\"Super Power rings\\", \\"exclusive membership to the Key Contributor Lounge in the new mecca building created specially for these stellar contributors\\", and fee reductions or priority status for Super Power courses.\\"Super Power Expansion Project Statuses and Benefits\\", Church of Scientology Religious Trust, 2007 \\"Cornerstone Members\\" have been promised a 40 percent discount and that their names will be engraved on a plaque inside the building. A 2011 investigation by the St. Petersburg Times newspaper found that the Church of Scientology had raised at least $145 million from its members for the Super Power Building project, vastly more than the building's ostensible cost. In one week alone, $23 million was raised ‚Äì almost half the entire cost that had been stated in 2009. Ex-members have complained of being subjected to intensive demands for funds and have suggested that the Church purposefully delayed completing the project so that it would remain a \\"cash cow\\", though church spokesmen have strongly denied this. In January 2013, a Californian couple who had donated more than $420,000 to the project sued the Church of Scientology for fraud and deception, charging that the Church had kept the building incomplete \\"to use it as a shill to induce further payments from members, just as they did the plaintiffs.\\" Project history Opening of the Super Power Building on November 17, 2013 Plans for the Super Power Building project were unveiled in 1993 by the Los Angeles-based Church of Scientology Religious Trust. The site was formerly occupied by the Gray Moss Inn, a turn-of-the-century building across the street from the Scientology- owned Fort Harrison Hotel. The inn had stood empty since being damaged in a 1989 arson fire and the Church of Scientology acquired the land in 1991 after it had been purchased by local property developer Terence J. McCarthy, the owner of T.J.M. Holding and president of Graymoss, Inc. The architectural firm HOK was hired to deliver the project. Construction officially began by Skanska USA in November 1998 and was slated for completion by late 2003. However, work was reported to have fallen well behind schedule and stopped in 2003. The cost of construction was reported to have more than doubled due to rises in the price of steel and labor, with the Church repeatedly issuing fundraising requests to its members. The revised cost was not disclosed but in 2000 it was reported that the cost had risen from the initial estimate of $24 million to $45 million, and a doubling of this figure would put the total cost at over $90 million. The Church also stated that the building had undergone two major redesigns due to its requirement to \\"keep pace with the quality of construction at other new facilities\\". In mid-February 2006, the Church hired Gensler, the world's largest architectural firm, to take over the project. The erratic progress of the project prompted criticism from local government officials and residents. In 2005, the city's code enforcement board ordered the exterior, including landscaping and sidewalks, to be completed by early summer. Frank Hibbard, the Mayor of Clearwater, noted that \\"the building had become an eyesore, surrounded by dirt and a chain-link fence.\\" The deadline was not met and daily fines of $250 ‚Äî totalling over $40,000 by the end of 2006 ‚Äî were levied against the Church. A Church spokesman announced in April 2006 that the building would be completed by the end of 2007 but this date has slipped repeatedly. Press reports at the time indicated that the Church was aiming to complete the building by March 2008. In November 2006 the city of Clearwater served the Church with a development order to complete the exterior of the building. but by December 2006 construction had not yet resumed and Church officials indicated that \\"mid 2008\\" was now the target date. The prolonged delay has adversely impacted other proposed developments that intended to capitalize on the promised increased economic activity from Scientologists visiting Clearwater. Church officials have offered no public explanation of the delays other than \\"a recurring need to revise interior design schemes in an effort to get it just right.\\" Work on the building was still at a standstill by March 2009; the daily fines levied by the city then totaled $245,000. Construction work was restarted in July 2009 after the completion of renovation of the nearby Fort Harrison Hotel. Scientology officials stated that the building had cost about $40 million up to that point and that completing the interior was expected to increase the total cost to $50 million. No new completion dates were announced, but \\"as soon as we get the go-ahead from the city, we'll begin\\". In September 2009, Church spokesperson Peter Mansell estimated the Super Power Building would be ready for occupancy by fall of 2010. This date passed without the building opening, though the exterior was completed by 2011. In June 2011, the St. Petersburg Times reported that the building had passed inspection and its Certificate of Occupancy had been obtained. The Church sought to seek a reduction in the fine levied by the city at the Code Enforcement Board's July or August meeting. Church spokeswoman Pat Harney said, \\"We are simply following the standard procedures to close out any remaining permit issues.\\" According to city assistant planning director Gina Clayton, since 2000 the Church has paid the city, county and state $2.2 million in permit, plan review, impact and other fees. The Church said its redesigns needed time. \\"We build for eternity,\\" former spokesman Ben Shaw told the Times. \\"When we do that, we want it perfect.\\" The Church said it would host a ribbon-cutting and dedication ceremony there later in 2011. It asked the city to reduce its fine by 90 percent, to reflect its \\"good faith\\" effort in bringing the building to code, but the city's resident-led Code Enforcement Board, which has a record of leniency and decimating fines, voted unanimously to keep the fines mostly untouched, saying the Church had long ignored the city's rules. The fine was set at $413,500, allowing for a reduction to account for months when the Church's plans were paused by city review. Over 14 years after construction began and nearly a decade after it had been supposed to open, the Super Power Building had still not been opened. It has been valued at $80 million by county assessors. In August 2013 the Church disclosed that it was planning to open the building on October 6, 2013 with a dedication ceremony expected to draw in an estimated 10,000 Scientologists in attendance. Only a month later, however, the Church told city authorities that it had decided to cancel the ceremony and postpone the opening of the building to an unspecified date, for undisclosed reasons. The building was finally opened on November 17, 2013 with Scientologist stars such as Tom Cruise, John Travolta and Kelly Preston in attendance for a ceremony presided over by Scientology leader David Miscavige. The number of Scientologists attending the ceremony was reported by the local media to have been far lower than the Church had forecast in advance, perhaps below 6,000 people, though the Church asserted in a press release that it had been \\"slightly over the expected 10,000 people\\".

The Christian Munsee were also known as the Moravian Munsee or the Moravian Indians or, in context, simply the Christian Indians. History =Pennsylvania= The Munsee were the Wolf clan of the Lenape, occupying the area where present-day Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York meet. The first recorded European contact occurred in 1524, when Giovanni da Verrazzano sailed into what is now New York Harbor. Like most native peoples of the Atlantic coast, the Munsee were quickly devastated by European diseases such as smallpox and influenza, and those who survived were forced inland. By the mid-18th century, one group of Lenape people began to follow the teachings of the Moravian missionaries. The Moravians, a Protestant denomination from Herrnhut, Saxony, now in Germany, Which were descended from the exiled protestants from Morava, now Czech Republic, sought to protect their converts by creating separate mission villages in the frontier, apart from both European settlers and from other native people. The most prominent missionary among the Munsee was David Zeisberger. In 1772, he led his group of Christian Munsee to the Ohio Country, which he hoped would isolate them from the hostilities of the approaching American Revolution. However, in 1782, a force of Pennsylvania militiamen, in search of Indians who had been raiding settlements in western Pennsylvania, happened upon a group of ninety-six of Zeisberger's Christian Munsee and rounded them up in the village of Gnadenh√ºtten. Although the Munsee truthfully pleaded their innocence, the militia took a vote and decided to kill them all, including the women and children. =Ontario= After ten more years of strife, most of the Christian Munsee followed Zeisberger to Ontario, Canada, where they established a new home at Fairfield, commonly known as Moraviantown, along the Thames River. There they lived in relative peace for twenty years, supporting themselves with their farming and industry. However, once again they became unwitting victims of war, when American soldiers burned their village to the ground during the War of 1812 Battle of the Thames. The battle is well known historically as a victory for General William Henry Harrison, and for the death of the Shawnee chief Tecumseh, but the destruction of Moraviantown is little more than a footnote. The Munsee fled into the wilderness for safe haven until hostilities had ceased, then returned to build a new Fairfield across the Thames River to the south, which is now known as Moraviantown. =Wisconsin= By the 1830s, a faction of the Christian Munsee favored a move to the American West. In 1837, some of the Munsee from Fairfield journeyed to Wisconsin to join another Christian band of Indians, the Stockbridge Mahican, whence the two tribes became known collectively as the Stockbridge-Munsee. They are now the Stockbridge-Munsee Community in Shawano County, Wisconsin. However, most of the Munsee eventually returned to Canada. The Christian Munsee in southern Ontario remain today as the Moravian of the Thames and the Munsee-Delaware Nation. =Kansas Territory= A small band of Christian Munsee decided to migrate again, this time to Kansas Territory, to join their non-Christian Lenape kinsmen. They settled first in Wyandotte County, then Leavenworth County. A few families settled near Fort Scott in Bourbon County. By 1857, most of the other Lenape (of Kansas) were removed to Indian Territory. The Christian Munsee, who now numbered less than one hundred, chose to purchase a new reservation in Franklin County from a small band of Ojibwa (Chippewa) that had migrated from Michigan. The Treaty of 1859 officially combined the Swan Creek and Black River Band Chippewa and the Christian Munsee on a reservation of twelve square miles along the Marais des Cygnes River near the town of Ottawa. Signing the treaty for the Munsee were Henry Donohoe, Ignatius Caleb, and John Williams. Although the two tribes shared a reservation and were considered one tribe by the United States government in all dealings, they maintained their separate identities in cultural and religious practices. The Moravian church continued to send missionaries to the Munsee. Under the Dawes Act, the Chippewa-Christian Indian Reservation, as it was known in the 1859 treaty, was allotted to the individual members and descendants of the tribes in separate 160-acre plots. The people eventually accepted assimilation. In 1900, the final disbursement of federal funds was paid, and all benefits and official recognition as Native Americans were dissolved.

The CICC was established in 2001 and enacted by the Cayman Islands Cadet Corps Law of 2003. The First Commandant of the CICC, now retired, was Colonel Philip Hyre. In 2013, Lieutenant Colonel Bobeth O‚ÄôGarro was confirmed as the Commandant for the CICC, thus becoming the first female Commandant to lead a Corps in the Caribbean region.http://www.caymannewsservice.com/local- news/2013/07/18/first-female-commandant-caribbean  Syllabus  The Organisation has been modeled on the UK Army Cadet Force organisation (ACF). The organisation aims to provide citizenship training via military-style activities, including instruction in military knowledge, drills, leadership, public speaking, field craft, land and sea navigation, signaling, physical fitness, first aid, arms skills, and music. Cayman Islands The Cayman Islands is a British Overseas Territory and uses the same school curriculum as the UK. In September 2005 the CICC began working with the Cadet Vocational Qualification Organisation (CVQO) in the UK to add a vocational training element that has resulted in qualified cadets gaining the BTEC First Diploma in Public Services, which is equivalent to passes in four subjects at GCSE. The CICC became the first Cadet Corps in the Caribbean to offer such a diploma. The CICC has an overseas exchange program with UK, Canada and other Caribbean Islands.

It was renamed as NIT Patna, by the Government of India on 28 January 2004. It is an autonomous institute functioning directly under Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India. It is one of the best National Institutes of Technology in India in terms of placement. History NIT Patna Main building NIT Patna origin can be traced to 1886 with the establishment of a survey training school and subsequent renaming it to Bihar college of Engineering in 1900. A graduate level curriculum was introduced in 1924. It was renamed Bihar College of Engineering in 1932. In 2004 the government of India upgraded the college to National Institute of Technology (NIT) status, as the state of Bihar had lost its only Regional Engineering College (REC), located at Jamshedpur, when Jharkhand was carved out of Bihar in 2000. By 2002, the Indian government decided to upgrade all RECs to NITs, with the aim of having at least one NIT per state. Bihar College of Engineering was the first institute to be directly upgraded to NIT status. In 2007, it was granted Institute of National Importance status in accordance with the National Institutes of Technology Act, 2007. Campus Aerial view of NIT Patna Main Building (Rear view) NIT Patna functions from a campus along Ashok Rajpath, geographically which lies on the southern bank of the river Ganges exactly opposite the point of its confluence with river Gandak. The campus lies alongside Gandhi Ghat where students usually enjoy scenic views of river Ganges. Land for a new campus, a plot, has been assigned at Sikandarpur village in Bihta, around 40 km from Patna. Earlier it was assigned at Dumri village in Bihta. Once NIT-Patna shifts to its new campus in Bihta, it will run some management courses on the present campus at Ashok Rajpath.

In 1968, the War Lords were involved in the formation of Youth Organizations United, a national coalition of street gangs, which included the Black Knights from Memphis, the Black Egyptians from East St. Louis, the Vice Lords from Chicago, the Thugs United from New Orleans and many others. At sometime in 1969, the War Lords joined with the Black Egyptians and possibly Black Culture Inc. as well to form the United Front of East St. Louis. There are few references to the War Lords after that, although in one late press release, Charles Jeffries stated that membership had been opened to whites. The War Lord's transition to mixed race membership lead to other endeavors and the formation of Warlords MC (Motorcycle Club), the nation's first interracial 3 piece patch MC.

When he returned from London, he became active in the National Party and joined its mouthpiece, Die Burger, as a journalist. He left journalism in 1927 and practised law. Career Running for parliament, he was unsuccessful in his first attempt in 1938 before obtaining a seat in 1941. When the National Party won power in 1948, he joined the cabinet as Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. As Minister of the Interior, from 1948 to 1961, he was one of the so-called \\"architects\\" of apartheid, introducing race-based population registration, and removing Coloured voters from the common voters' roll as a prelude to disenfranchising them altogether. During his tenure as Minister of the Interior, D√∂nges believed that apartheid would continue only for the next two generations. In November 1953, after DF Malan resigned as Cape Provincial leader, D√∂nges defeated Eric Louw to become the new provincial leader. In the 1958 National Party leadership election following the death of Prime Minister J. G. Strijdom, D√∂nges ran for the party leadership and lost to Hendrik Verwoerd in the final round of voting between the two candidates. Despite this, Verwoerd included D√∂nges in the new cabinet as Minister of Finance from 1958 to 1966. After Verwoerd's assassination, D√∂nges, as senior member of the Cabinet, became acting Prime Minister on 6 September 1966 until a National Party congress named B. J.

He was one of the leading sculptors of the Art Deco period. Early life Ferdinand Preisshttp://www.artnet.com/artists/lotdetailpage.aspx?lot_id=A859D421CAFBC47E070750A727A350A3 was born in Erbach im Odenwald as one of six children to Karl Daniel Heinrich Preiss and his wife Katharine Preiss n√©e Elisabetham. He attended schools in Michelstadt and had aspirations to become an engineer. Both of his parents died within a short time span when he was 15 and shortly thereafter he was apprenticed to the ivory carver Philipp Willmann and lived with his family. In 1901 he traveled to Rome and Paris. He became a friend and acquaintance of Arthur Kassler in Baden-Baden, which led to the founding of the company Preiss & Kassler operating from Berlin. Kassler became the business-minded partner and Preiss controlled artistic production. Career and marriage In 1907 he married Margarethe Hilme, producing two children, Harry and Lucie. Initially the company created small ivory carvings of children and statuettes of classical form, often carved from old ivory billiard balls. From 1910 the firm grew to specialize in limited edition Art Deco cabinet sculptures that used painted bronze with ivory on plinths of onyx and marble, with an occasional foray into mantelpiece clocks and lampstands. He revolutionized the production of chryselephantine statues with his use of a dental drill for more precise and expeditious carving of the ivory. Preiss designed nearly all the firm's models and many of his most famous works depict modern, naturalistic 20th- century women from the sports and theatrical world. Casting of the pieces was initially done by the Aktien-Gesellschaft Gladenbeck foundry in Berlin and later by their own Preiss & Kassler foundry. With the outbreak of World War I in 1914 the company was employing six extremely skilled ivory carvers from Erbach and exporting regularly to England and the United States. A small factory was set up in England to assemble the sculptures from parts manufactured in Germany which also avoided taxes on imports.Shayo, Alberto: Ferdinand Preiss: Art Deco Sculptor--The Fire and the Flame Ferdinand Preiss has sometimes been incorrectly called Fritz Preiss. His works, along with those of Demetre H. Chiparus, are regarded as the pinnacle of Art Deco sculpture and are greatly valued by modern collectors.http://www.preiss.de/engl/pkbiographie.htm Death and legacy The firm closed with Preiss's death from a brain tumor on July 29, 1943. The old workshop in Ritterstra√üe in Berlin, which was housing the stock of samples, was gutted by a fire resulting from a bomb attack shortly before the end of World War II. Preiss is remembered as one of the greatest sculptors of the Art Deco era.

Early life Prince Christian was born on 14 April 1867, at Windsor Castle. His father was Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein, the third son of Christian, Duke of Augustenborg, and Countess Louise Sophie of Danneskiold-Sams√∏e. His mother was Princess Helena, the fifth child and third daughter of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and Prince Albert. His parents resided in the United Kingdom, at Cumberland Lodge, and the Prince was considered a member of the British royal family. Under letters patent of 1866, he was styled His Highness Prince Christian Victor of Schleswig-Holstein. He was baptised in the private chapel at Windsor Castle. His godparents were Queen Victoria (his maternal grandmother), the Duke of Augustenburg (his paternal grandfather; represented by Prince Arthur), the Prince of Wales (his maternal uncle), the Crown Princess of Prussia (his maternal aunt; represented by Princess Louise), the Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (his maternal great-uncle; represented by the Duke of Edinburgh), and the Dowager Princess of Hohenlohe-Langenburg (his maternal half-great-aunt; represented by Lady Churchill).Queen Victoria's Journals ‚Äì Tuesday 21st May 1867 Education The Prince, who was educated at Lambrook, Wellington College, Magdalen College, Oxford, and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, was commissioned in the 60th King's Royal Rifles in 1888 and served later in the 4th King's Royal Rifle Corps. \\"Christle\\", as the prince was known in the family, was the first member of the Royal Family to attend school instead of being educated by a tutor at home. That he studied at Wellington College made Queen Victoria very happy, as Prince Albert had helped to establish the institution many years before. At Wellington he played for the college First Eleven in 1883 and was captain of the cricket team in 1885. He was also captain of the cricket team while at Magdalen College and at Sandhurst, and made a single first-class appearance, for I Zingari against Gentlemen of England in 1887.

Moving to West Africa, in 1895 he participated in the Ashanti Expedition in the Gold Coast, now Ghana. Upon his return, he was elevated to the rank of Major and then served under Lord Kitchener in 1898 when British and Egyptian troops defeated the Dervishes at Omdurman near Khartoum and recovered the Sudan. The following year he served as a staff officer in the Second Boer War, being involved in the relief of LadysmithArmy of Natal under General Sir Redvers Buller and later was with Lord Roberts in Pretoria.

Color superconducting phases are to be contrasted with the normal phase of quark matter, which is just a weakly interacting Fermi liquid of quarks. In theoretical terms, a color superconducting phase is a state in which the quarks near the Fermi surface become correlated in Cooper pairs, which condense. In phenomenological terms, a color superconducting phase breaks some of the symmetries of the underlying theory, and has a very different spectrum of excitations and very different transport properties from the normal phase.  Description  = Analogy with superconducting metals = It is well known that at low temperature many metals become superconductors. A metal can be viewed as a Fermi liquid of electrons, and below a critical temperature, an attractive phonon-mediated interaction between the electrons near the Fermi surface causes them to pair up and form a condensate of Cooper pairs, which via the Anderson-Higgs mechanism makes the photon massive, leading to the characteristic behaviors of a superconductor; infinite conductivity and the exclusion of magnetic fields (Meissner effect). The crucial ingredients for this to occur are: # a liquid of charged fermions. # an attractive interaction between the fermions # low temperature (below the critical temperature) These ingredients are also present in sufficiently dense quark matter, leading physicists to expect that something similar will happen in that context: # quarks carry both electric charge and color charge; # the strong interaction between two quarks is powerfully attractive; # the critical temperature is expected to be given by the QCD scale, which is of order 100 MeV, or 1012 kelvins, the temperature of the universe a few minutes after the Big Bang, so quark matter that we may currently observe in compact stars or other natural settings will be below this temperature. The fact that a Cooper pair of quarks carries a net color charge, as well as a net electric charge, means that some of the gluons (which mediate the strong interaction just as photons mediate electromagnetism) become massive in a phase with a condensate of quark Cooper pairs, so such a phase is called a \\"color superconductor\\". Actually, in many color superconducting phases the photon itself does not become massive, but mixes with one of the gluons to yield a new massless \\"rotated photon\\". This is an MeV-scale echo of the mixing of the hypercharge and W3 bosons that originally yielded the photon at the TeV scale of electroweak symmetry breaking. = Diversity of color superconducting phases = Unlike an electrical superconductor, color-superconducting quark matter comes in many varieties, each of which is a separate phase of matter. This is because quarks, unlike electrons, come in many species. There are three different colors (red, green, blue) and in the core of a compact star we expect three different flavors (up, down, strange), making nine species in all. Thus in forming the Cooper pairs there is a 9√ó9 color-flavor matrix of possible pairing patterns. The differences between these patterns are very physically significant: different patterns break different symmetries of the underlying theory, leading to different excitation spectra and different transport properties. It is very hard to predict which pairing patterns will be favored in nature. In principle this question could be decided by a QCD calculation, since QCD is the theory that fully describes the strong interaction. In the limit of infinite density, where the strong interaction becomes weak because of asymptotic freedom, controlled calculations can be performed, and it is known that the favored phase in three-flavor quark matter is the color-flavor- locked phase. But at the densities that exist in nature these calculations are unreliable, and the only known alternative is the brute-force computational approach of lattice QCD, which unfortunately has a technical difficulty (the \\"sign problem\\") that renders it useless for calculations at high quark density and low temperature. Physicists are currently pursuing the following lines of research on color superconductivity: * Performing calculations in the infinite density limit, to get some idea of the behavior at one edge of the phase diagram. * Performing calculations of the phase structure down to medium density using a highly simplified model of QCD, the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model, which is not a controlled approximation, but is expected to yield semi- quantitative insights. * Writing down an effective theory for the excitations of a given phase, and using it to calculate the physical properties of that phase. * Performing astrophysical calculations, using NJL models or effective theories, to see if there are observable signatures by which one could confirm or rule out the presence of specific color superconducting phases in nature (i.e. in compact stars: see next section).  Possible occurrence in nature  The only known place in the universe where the baryon density might possibly be high enough to produce quark matter, and the temperature is low enough for color superconductivity to occur, is the core of a compact star (often called a \\"neutron star\\", a term which prejudges the question of its actual makeup). There are many open questions here: * We do not know the critical density at which there would be a phase transition from nuclear matter to some form of quark matter, so we do not know whether compact stars have quark matter cores or not. * On the other extreme, it is conceivable that nuclear matter in bulk is actually metastable, and decays into quark matter (the \\"stable strange matter hypothesis\\"). In this case, compact stars would consist completely of quark matter all the way to their surface. * Assuming that compact stars do contain quark matter, we do not know whether that quark matter is in a color superconducting phase or not. At infinite density one expects color superconductivity, and the attractive nature of the dominant strong quark- quark interaction leads one to expect that it will survive down to lower densities, but there may be a transition to some strongly coupled phase (e.g. a Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensate of spatially bound di- or hexaquarks).

Carroll was a reporter for the Christian Science Monitor at the time of her kidnapping. After finishing a fellowship at Harvard University's Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy she returned to work for the Monitor. After her release, Carroll wrote a series of articles on her recollection of her experiences in Iraq. Overview Carroll became an international cause c√©l√®bre when she was kidnapped in Baghdad on January 7, 2006. Carroll was freed on March 30, 2006. Carroll was reporting in Iraq for the Christian Science Monitor. She has also worked as a commentator for news networks such as MSNBC. She had been in Iraq since October 2003. Before covering the Middle East, Carroll was a reporting assistant in Washington, D.C., for the Wall Street Journal and worked for States News Service. According to an Associated Press report on August 9, 2006, U.S. Marines arrested four Iraqi men for participating in Carroll's kidnapping. Carroll was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan. She attended Huron High School in Ann Arbor and graduated from the University of Massachusetts Amherst with a bachelor's degree in journalism in 1999. Abduction On January 7, 2006, Carroll, along with an interpreter and driver, traveled to the Adel district of Baghdad to interview Adnan al-Dulaimi, a Sunni politician and leader of the Iraqi People's Conference. After discovering that al-Dulaimi was not at his office, they left and soon after were ambushed by masked gunmen. The driver, Adnan Abbas, managed to escape, but Carroll was kidnapped and her interpreter, Alan Enwiyah, 32, was shot dead and his body abandoned nearby by the kidnappers during the abduction. Carroll's driver, quoted in a story posted on the Monitor's website, said gunmen jumped in front of the car, pulled him from it, and drove off with their two captives all within 15 seconds. Enwiyah, also known as Alan John Ghazi, was formerly a well-known music retailer in Baghdad.Helping Jill interpret Iraq, The Christian Science Monitor. According to the New York Times, Carroll was the 36th foreign journalist to be kidnapped in Iraq since the Iraq War began in March 2003. Among the many kidnappings in Iraq, Carroll's kidnapping evoked one of the most widespread outcries. \\"We are urgently seeking information about Ms. Carroll and are pursuing every avenue to secure her release,\\" Monitor editor Richard Bergenheim said in January. \\"I, her father and her sister are appealing directly to her captors to release this young woman who has worked so hard to show the sufferings of Iraqis to the world,\\" Mary Beth Carroll told CNN's American Morning on January 19, 2006. In efforts to locate and rescue Carroll, U.S. forces initially raided a mosque in the west of the capital after a tip that \\"activities related to the kidnapping were being carried out inside,\\" triggering angry protests from Sunni Muslim citizens. =Video= On January 17, 2006, Qatar-based news network Al-Jazeera aired a silent 20-second video-tape that showed Carroll, and indicated that, in an accompanying message, an as-yet unidentified group was giving the United States 72 hours to release all female prisoners in Iraq. If that demand were not met, the group says it would kill Carroll. The silent video showed Carroll speaking in front of a white background. The Qatar-based station said the kidnappers identified themselves as members of a previously unknown armed group calling itself the \\"Brigades of Vengeance\\". =Adnan al- Dulaimi= Sunni political leader Adnan al-Dulaimi, whom Carroll was attempting to visit when she was kidnapped, gave a press conference on January 20, 2006, and gave the following statements. > This act has hurt me and makes me sad because the journalist was trying to > meet me when she was kidnapped. After she left my office because she was > unable to meet me, she was kidnapped 300 meters from my office. We are > against violence by any group, and we call the government and U.S. forces to > stop raiding houses, arresting women. I call upon the kidnappers to > immediately release this reporter who came here to cover Iraq's news and > defending our rights. =Iraqi prisoners released= On January 27, 2006, five female Iraqi prisoners were released from U.S. custody. The U.S. military claimed the releases were already planned and had nothing to do with Carroll's kidnapper's initial threat to kill her within 72 hours unless all female detainees in Iraqi prisons were released. =Second video= On January 30, 2006, a second video appeared on Al Jazeera showing Carroll wearing a headscarf and crying. The footage was timestamped with a date of January 28, 2006 and also featured the logo of the \\"Brigades of Vengeance\\" a militant group. Although the initial airing of the video did not include audio, Carroll is said to repeat earlier pleas to release all female hostages under American custody. =Third video= On February 9, 2006, a third video appeared on private Kuwaiti TV channel Alrai TV. The 22-second video showed Carroll sitting in a chair behind a large floral pattern, in full Islamic dress. She is pleading for supporters to do whatever it takes to release her. Unlike the previous two videos, both audio and video is included. Carroll mentions that the date of the tape is February 2, 2006. In the tape, she mentions letters that she has written as evidence for the authenticity of the tape. A letter accompanied the tape that was written by Carroll, but no previous letters have been found. The contents of the letter have not been disclosed. The following is a transcript from the video: > Today is Thursday, February 6-[corrects herself]-February 2, 2006. I'm with > the mujahideen.

Please, just do whatever they want, > give them whatever they want as quickly as possible. There is very short > time; please do it fast. That's all. =February 26 deadline= A Kuwaiti television station reported February 10, 2006 that the kidnappers had communicated to them a deadline set for February 26 for their demands to be met, or Carroll would be killed.Kidnapped Journalist: Time Is Short, CBS. Earlier, people close to the kidnappers told Al Rai TV that Carroll is \\"in a safe house owned by one of the kidnappers in downtown Baghdad with a group of women.\\" On February 14, 2006 Iraqi TV began airing a Public Service Announcement appealing for her release. =February 26 passes= Iraqi Interior Minister Bayan Jabr al Zubaidi believed Carroll to still be alive although the deadline for her execution has passed, according to ABC News. =Release= On March 30, 2006, Carroll entered the Sunni Iraqi Islamic Party offices in western Baghdad around midday and handed office personnel a letter, thought to be from her kidnappers, asking for help, a party official later said. At that time, Carroll said she had just been freed unharmed and was treated humanely during her captivity. =Post-release video= Within days of Carroll's release, a video of Carroll criticizing the occupation of Iraq and praising the insurgents as \\"good people fighting an honorable fight\\" appeared on an Islamist website. While counterterrorism expert Laura Mansfield, who had neither met nor interviewed Carroll, posited on CNN that Carroll's actions \\"may indicate she was experiencing a touch of Stockholm syndrome\\".Carroll takes shot at her kidnappers, cnn.com, April 1, 2006. The Christian Science Monitor, Carroll's paper, reported: On April 1, 2006, Carroll released a statement through the website of the Christian Science Monitor, stating she had participated in the video critical of the United States and praiseworthy of her abductors only because she feared for her life and because her captors said they would let her go if she participated to their satisfaction. \\"Things that I was forced to say while captive are now being taken by some as an accurate reflection of my personal views.

In previous months, similar efforts were shown by hanging photographs of other kidnapped individuals from the same spot. In Paris, on February 7, 2006, 30 white balloons were released to mark the 30 days of Carroll's captivity (in actuality 32 days at that point). French actress Juliette Binoche appeared to show her support. Both the Rome and Paris efforts were coordinated by Reporters Without Borders.

Pyles is also one of the founding fathers of Southwestern cuisine. His creative dishes blend elements of Southern homestyle cooking, sophisticated Southwestern fare, Mexican food and Tex-Mex food, as well as Cajun cuisine and Creole cookery. Pyles, along with his colleagues, Dean Fearing, Robert Del Grande, and Anne Lindsay Greer contributed to changes in the cuisine of the U.S. states of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. Pyles spent more than 25 years in the Dallas‚Äô restaurant circuit, and was further the main creator of New Texas Cuisine. His first two restaurants were the business casual Routh Street Cafe which was founded in 1983 as well as a miniature version of said restaurant called Baby Routh. These restaurants are known for being the flagship of the Southwestern Cuisine explosion of the 1980s and 1990s. Since opening Routh Street Cafe, Pyles has opened some 15 restaurants, including Samar in the fall of 2009. Pyles, a fifth-generation Texan, has received numerous awards as well as nationwide recognition. Bon App√©tit credited Pyles with almost single-handedly changing the cooking scene in Texas. The New York Times called Pyles \\"an absolute genius in the kitchen.\\" The Dallas Morning News further stated,\\"If anyone can lead this town to its next level of culinary evolution, it‚Äôs Stephan Pyles.\\" Among his awards are the AAA Five Diamond Award; Nation's Restaurant News‚Äô Fine Dining Hall of Fame Award; Restaurants and Institutions‚Äô 'Ivy Award' and the American Academy of Achievement Award. He was the first person from the Southwest to win a James Beard Award for 'Best Chef.' He was further the first Texas native inducted into 'Who‚Äôs Who of Food and Wine in America.' On top of all this he was awarded, 'Outstanding Restaurateur of the Year' by both the Minnesota Restaurant Association and Texas Restaurant Association. . Stephan Pyles is the author of five cookbooks on Texan and Southwestern Cuisine. In addition to his many achievements, he also hosted the Emmy Award winning PBS television series \\"New Tastes From Texas With Chef Stephan Pyles.\\" This series ran during 1998 and 1999 and included a number of guest Celebrity chefs, including Diana Kennedy, Rick Bayless, Patricia Quintana, Zarela Martinez, Americo Circuit and David Garrido . Early life Born in Big Spring, Texas in 1952, Pyles received classical training in voice and piano. Nonetheless, he much preferred to apprentice in the kitchen of his family's West Texas truck stop. This was followed by classic training in fine French Cuisine and a 200 plus recipe book entitled \\"The New Texas Cuisine\\" which made him nationally recognized by his early thirties. One of the main purposes of Pyles' first book was to demonstrate that there's much more to Lone Star cooking than Tex-Mex and barbecue; in this wide-ranging book, the award-winning chef of Routh Street Cafe presents eclectic and sophisticated Texas recipes. Pyles owned and operated the Dallas restaurants of Routh Street Cafe and Baby Routh from 1983‚Äì1993. He further owned and operated the restaurants of Goodfellow's and Tejas in Minneapolis 1987‚Äì1993. In 1994 Pyles opened Star Canyon which would prove to be the restaurant to make Stephan Pyle's career skyrocket. The James Beard Foundation dubbed it one of the top five new restaurants in America and it got raving reviews from Bon Apetit, Esquire Magazine, Town and Country, Playboy and other publications. The September 1998 issue of Food and Wine Magazine listed Star Canyon as the \\"quintessential Dallas restaurant. Career In 1997, Pyles opened AquaKnox, a global seafood restaurant, It too was named a best new restaurant by Food and Wine. In 1998, Pyles sold Star Canyon and AquaKnox to Carlson Restaurants WorldWide and during the next two years opened new versions of Star Canyon in Las Vegas, Nevada at The Venetian, Las Vegas Hotel and Resort, and another at the Stephen F. Austin Hotel in Austin, Texas. Back in Dallas he opened \\"FishBowl,\\" a new concept in an Asian- themed restaurant, and a casual Mexican restaurant called Taqueria Ca√±onita, which was later replicated in several cities around the U.S.A. Throughout his career, Pyles has cooked for dignitaries and celebrities, from HRH Queen Elizabeth II and Mikhail Gorbachev, to rock star Mick Jagger and actress Sharon Stone. He has also appeared around the world as a guest celebrity chef and was one of five chefs worldwide invited to prepare dinner for Jimmy Carter‚Äôs 70th birthday. In addition to his first cookbook, The New Texas Cuisine, Pyles has also co-authored \\"Tamales,\\" and written \\"New Tastes from Texas,\\" and Southwestern Vegetarian.\\" He further worked full-time on the PBS T.V. show \\"New Tastes from Texas. Pyles was also a cuisine consultant for a number of hotel and resort companies as well as for American Airlines. Change & New Discoveries In 2001 Pyles took a five year ‚Äúsiesta‚Äù from the restaurant world; he used the time to travel, educate, teach, and write. During this hiatus, he spent significant time in Latin America, the Eastern Mediterranean including the Levant, Spain and India. These places would all provide cultural influences for his new restaurant ventures. In 2006, Pyles opened in Dallas a new restaurant named after himself. The \\"Stephan Pyles\\" Restaurant is located in the Dallas Arts District and serves an ever newer and more cutting-edge genre of cuisine, \\"New Millenium Southwestern Cuisine.\\" This is a global tapestry of tastes, flavors, aromas and textures from Texas, South America, Spain, the Middle East and the Mediterranean. On November 22, 2009 a second new Dallas Arts District restaurant by Chef Pyles was opened, \\"Samar by Stephan Pyles\\". The word \\"Samar\\" is a concept designed on combining three cultures, Spain, Eastern Mediterranean and India. Philanthropy, consulting, and scholarship fund Stephan Pyles is a founding board member of Share Our Strength, America‚Äôs largest hunger relief organization. In 1998, Share Our Strength presented Pyles the Humanitarian of the Year Award for his outstanding patronage. Pyles founded Dallas‚Äô Taste of the Nation event for the organization in 1988, raising over $1,500,000 for local ministries and food pantries. He also serves as a life board member of The North Texas Food Bank (NTFB), an organization which ‚Äúseeks to eliminate hunger by distributing food and grocery products through a network of nonprofits while providing education and increasing community awareness‚Äù. Since its inception in 1982, NTFB has procured and locally distributed more than 293 million pounds of food. In 1986, Pyles co-founded NTFB's perishable food program The Hunger Link, which connects Dallas restaurants and hotels with shelters and meal programs. In addition to running two top-scale and demanding restaurants and his charity work, Pyles serves as a cuisine consultant to Gaylord Texan Resort & Convention Center in Grapevine, Texas, where he developed the restaurant's menu and continues to provide culinary direction. He also has returned to work as a cuisine consultant for American Airlines and is also a chief chef consultant for Dallas-based Art Institutes International.

He played jazz, pop, rock, country, Motown, and classical music. Career Brisbois was born in Edina, Minnesota and began studying the trumpet at age 12. He was mainly self-taught, and reportedly had most of his range before leaving high school. He briefly attended University of Minnesota before moving to Los Angeles, where he would live most of his life, when not touring. In September 1958 he joined Stan Kenton's orchestra, where he took over the \\"scream\\" parts written for Maynard Ferguson, in addition to playing much of the lead trumpet. Brisbois toured with Kenton's band until the early 60's, recording over 30 albums. Around 1963 he left Kenton to work in the Los Angeles recording studios. Brisbois worked as a studio musician in Los Angeles from around 1963 to 1975, recording over a hundred albums. He worked with Herb Alpert, Tony Bennett, Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Rosemary Clooney, Nat King Cole, Bobby Darin, Neil Diamond, Duke Ellington, The 5th Dimension, The Four Freshmen, Lionel Hampton, Herbie Hancock, Harry James, Henry Mancini, Dean Martin, Onzy Matthews, Billy May, The Monkees, Bonnie Raitt, Lou Rawls, Lalo Schifrin, Bud Shank, Frank Sinatra, Nancy Sinatra, and Nancy Wilson. He played lead trumpet on the theme songs to Hawaii Five-O and The Jetsons. In early 1973 Brisbois formed the rock group Butane, featuring himself as singer and trumpeter. They recorded a demo and played regular gigs over the next two years, at one point performing on the hit television show The Midnight Special but never secured a record contract and eventually disbanded. In 1975, after the breakup of his second marriage, Brisbois had problems with manic depression from which he had suffered all his life. He quit the music business and moved to Beverly Hills, where for a time he worked as a Porsche salesman. In 1976 or 1977, he moved to Scottsdale, Arizona to be near his sister. Eventually he began playing again. When asked what inspired him, he replied, \\"I was driving down a freeway in LA and heard Claus Ogerman's Gate of Dreams album.\\" Brisbois began teaching privately and worked with Grant Wolf and the Mesa Community College Jazz Band. In addition, he taught the trumpeters of the Musicians Union sponsored Young Sounds band. He performed in bands in Phoenix. In late May or early June 1978, he appeared as a guest with the jazz-rock group \\"Matrix\\" and commented, \\"I played as well as I have ever played.\\" Less than a week later he committed suicide.

Some freestyle events are judged competitions, while others are merely exhibitions, similar to that of Skateboarding. History and development The earliest monster truck competitions were rudimentary freestyle events. Drivers would crush cars and perform wheelies and would typically be judged by the audience in a \\"cheer-off\\", where the truck that got the most applause was determined to be the winner. As monster truck racing developed in the mid 1980s, freestyle was relegated to an exhibition exclusive event and was almost non-existent for a portion of the early 1990s. Freestyle entered back into the sport as some drivers, notably Dennis Anderson and Mike Welch began asking promoters if they could bring their trucks out for an extra freestyle exhibition for the fans when they were eliminated from racing in early rounds from breakage. They were given permission to do so often and the positive crowd response was noted by the promoters, who then decided it would be a good addition to all shows. In the middle of the 1990s, freestyle was added to most monster truck events as an exhibition segment for all trucks. The segment served two purposes: first, it gave the crowd the wheelies, long jumps, and donuts that they wanted and were not usually a part of racing; second, it brought the trucks out for a longer period of time in front of the audience, allowing for shows with fewer trucks and fewer rounds of racing. By the end of the 1990s, freestyle had become an anticipated part of shows and the drivers had begun to develop their own individual tricks, as well as informally competing to put on the best show for bragging rights. This, combined with the Motor Madness television show format of one event spread out over two episodes, influenced the USHRA's decision to turn freestyle into a judged competition that would also count toward a championship. Currently, while not every promoter runs a championship for it, most promoters run freestyle as a competitive event at shows in conjunction with racing. Rules and format Freestyle competitions butt run in conjunction with racing events, and typically share the same basic track setup. Modifications can be made to the racing obstacles, however, to make them more suitable for freestyle. This usually involves removing ramps to give the trucks a more vertical take-off from the cars, and even stacking cars or adding vans to a set of vehicles used in racing. Separate freestyle obstacles are also usually placed in the competition area outside the boundaries of the race course. These obstacles can include dirt hills, extra rows of cars, recreational vehicles or trailer homes to drive through, or what are termed as \\"pyramids\\" - an obstacle that uses vehicles of increasing sizes to form a kind of stair set for trucks to climb up. A typical \\"pyramid\\" is known as a car-van-bus-van-car pyramid, called such because the trucks climb over the vehicles in that order. There are several variations on the judging of freestyle (depending on the promoter), but they all share a common thread in that they usually involve the spectators having some say in who the winner is. Some promoters still use the applause-based \\"cheer-off\\" method, however scorecard based judging, as is done in the USHRA, is increasing in use. In this method, a set of judges is chosen to score runs individually on a scale from one to ten, one being the worst score and ten being the best. These individual scores are then added up to give the total score. At most events, three judges are used and the best possible score is thirty; at the Monster Jam World Finals six judges (all from within the industry and not fans) are used and the lowest and highest scores are thrown out for a maximum total of forty. Basic judging criteria includes: *Amount of allotted time used *Amount of speed maintained during run *Aggression in hitting obstacles *Height, length, and verticality of jumps *Use of specific tricks (slap wheelies, donuts, etc.) *Getting the truck out of situations which would otherwise result in a crash (\\"saves\\") *Spectacular moments (can often add significantly to the score of an otherwise unimpressive run) At smaller events, if the scored judging ends in a tie, a \\"cheer-off\\" is often used between the tied competitors. At larger events, the tie is broken by a secret judge called the \\"tie breaking judge\\". Criticisms Freestyle is not universally popular among those in the industry, notably Everett Jasmer (notable for USA-1). There are several criticisms of the competition. Among them is that, as a judged competition, freestyle is not a legitimate motor sport because it is not racing, and that it adds to the reputation of the sport being more of a show than a competition, similar to professional wrestling. The legitimacy of the competition is also criticized because, in the case of fan-judged events, inexperienced or biased fans can judge inconsistently or poorly. Many also feel that pressure from both fans and promoters has forced drivers to push their trucks beyond their limits and too often is a breeding ground for crashes and excessively risky maneuvers. Branching from this is the criticism that freestyle is exclusively to create the crashes and roll-overs that casual fans enjoy, and events like the World Finals tend to reinforce the argument with multiple roll-overs and even trucks driving over each other. However, recent emphasis on using the full allotted time and scoring bonuses for making saves rather than crashing are reducing the trend.

It is endemic to Australia where it is found along the eastern sub-tropical to tropical coast, usually on the margins of rainforests, in Queensland and New South Wales. The genus was originally described by French naturalist Adrien- Henri de Jussieu in 1830. The only species recognized is Synoum glandulosum, known commonly as scentless rosewood. It resembles the related Toona, except that the leaves have 5-9 leaflets, whereas Toona has 8-20. Its fruit matures December to January and is a reddish three-lobed capsule that contains two or three seeds surrounded by a red aril. Germination from fresh seed is reliable and relatively fast. The timber of Synoum is used in local construction as sawn timber for general house framing, flooring, mouldings and joinery. It is also used for furniture, shop and office fixtures, panelling, turnery, carving, as structural plywood, scaffold planks, wood wool, paper products, particleboard, and medium density fibreboard.

H. Jackson for operation on New Zealand's national rail network.  Introduction and design  Built to a similar but vastly improved design to the Q class of 1901, they had a wheel arrangement of 4-6-2 and were suited to hauling freight services in the North Island (Originally they were to be classed QB but as they were to supplement the A class, given their aforementioned designation.) The United States built locomotives were an urgent order needed due to heavy demand with both New Zealand and British workshops unable to supply as the First World War was draining resources and manpower for the war effort. Construction was completed less than two months after the order was placed and all ten entered service in New Zealand in June 1915. Bar frames were used by the American builders instead of NZR's preferred plate frames, and the class had superheaters as built. Water capacity was double that of the A class and coal a quarter more.  Service  They were worked hard for four decades being supplanted by the more powerful \\"K\\" and \\"J\\" class families. In 1919 No. 654 was used for a very short experiment in the use of pulverized coal. Only one trip is known to have been made before the engine was converted back. They were initially equipped with grates smaller than either the A or AB class. Not an issue with hard coal, increasing use of soft Waikato coal meant a larger grate was desirable. Thus the entire class had their boilers replaced with AB class types starting in 1940 giving the reliable locomotives more life. This soon became a blessing when they were worked hard through the Second World War. They were used extensively on the steeply graded central NIMT, Wanganui and Gisborne sections. In the mid-1950s most of the class were still in reasonable condition and the engines were regarded as a very successful class, capable of taking somewhat heavier loads than an Ab. Serious consideration was given to a major refit of the class rather than rebuilding 9 of the mid 1930s K class which were essentially worn out, and very expensive to run and repair, after being run hard and fast to cope with heavier freight traffic in the early 1950s and the attempts of enthusiastic drivers to outrun the new diesel competition. The option of modernising the Aa class was rejected on account of their age, and due to the fact the cultural importance of K's made them impossible to withdraw in 1956. The first withdrawals occurred in December 1955, when six were taken out of service with their boilers returned to the AB class boiler repair pool. The remaining four continued to operate until February 1957. None are preserved.

(1820 - 1897) was an Italian-born priest of the Society of Jesus. He was a founder of the University of San Francisco and Saint Ignatius College Preparatory as well as the first pastor of Saint Ignatius Church in San Francisco, California. Born in Piedmont, Italy, in 1820, Maraschi entered the Society of Jesus in Chieti. He began his scholastic career in Nice and was ordained a priest there in 1849. Maraschi left for the United States soon thereafter, and he completed a theology degree at Georgetown University before becoming a member of its faculty. Maraschi was also assigned to teach at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, and Loyola College in Baltimore, Maryland. In 1854, Maraschi left for San Francisco. Upon arrival, he served as an assistant pastor for both St. Francis of Assisi and St. Patrick's churches while planning the establishment of a Jesuit church and school in the City. With the approval of Archbishop Joseph Alemany and the assistance of fellow Jesuits Michael Accolti, S.J. and Joseph Bixio, S.J., Saint Ignatius Church and College were established in 1855. Saint Ignatius College was recognized by the Society of Jesus in 1859 and chartered by the State of California that same year. During the early years, Father Maraschi served as not only the church's pastor but also the college's president and treasurer, as well as an instructor in Latin, Greek, and Spanish. While he turned over the college's presidency to Nicholas Congiato, S.J. in 1862, Father Maraschi continued to supervise its financial affairs. He also continued to serve as Saint Ignatius Church's parish priest until a dispute with Archbishop Alemany in 1863 resulted in the church's parish status being rescinded. Much later on, Saint Ignatius College would split into Saint Ignatius College and Saint Ignatius High School, with the former becoming the University of San Francisco and the latter becoming Saint Ignatius College Preparatory. Anthony Maraschi died in San Francisco in 1897 and was buried in Mission Santa Clara's cemetery. Bust by Harriet G. Moore A bronze bust of Maraschi resides on the campus and in the collection the University of San Francisco. The bust, sculpted by Harriet G. Moore and founded by Artworks Foundry, was cast in 1985. It is 22 1/2 x 21 x 13 in. and sits on a concrete base that is 47 x 47 1/2 x 47 1/2 in. The sculpture is signed and dated by Moore. It is a portrait bust of Maraschi and shows him wearing a priest's hat and robe. A plaque on the front of the base reads: :REV. ANTHONY JOSEPH MARASCHI, S. J. :(1820-1897) :FIRST PRESIDENT OF ST.

His students included Woldemar Bargiel, Salomon Jadassohn, Arthur O'Leary, and (by far the most celebrated) Sir Arthur Sullivan. He also edited many works by Felix Mendelssohn for publication. Biography Rietz studied the cello under Bernhard Romberg. At 16, he joined the orchestra of Berlin's K√∂nigst√§dter Theater, for which he wrote the music to Karl Eduard von Holtei's play Lorbeerbaum und Bettelstab. In 1834, he was appointed assistant conductor at the D√ºsseldorf Opera under Mendelssohn, whom he succeeded the following year. He moved in 1847 to Leipzig, where he served as kapellmeister and conductor of the Singakademie. During 1848, a year after Mendelssohn's death, Rietz took over Mendelssohn's former role as conductor of the Gewandhaus concerts in the same city, and as teacher of composition at the conservatoire there. He was called to Dresden in 1860 to succeed Carl Gottlieb Reissiger as court kapellmeister. Here he spent the rest of his life, frequently appearing as an opera conductor, and also undertaking the direction of the royal conservatoire. Compositions In terms of his own composing, Rietz belonged to the classically inclined school (Mendelssohn's output, as might be expected, had a big influence upon him) and he was strongly opposed to the musical radicalism of Liszt and Wagner. Among his works are the operas, three symphonies, several overtures to plays, flute sonatas, violin sonatas, motets, masses, psalms, and a quantity of other church music. = Operas = * Jery und B√§tely (1839) * Das M√§dchen aus der Fremde (1839) * Der Korsar (1850) * Georg Neumann und die Gambe (1859) = Symphonies= * Symphony No. 1 in G minor, Op. 13 (1843) * Symphony No. 2 in A major, Op. 23 (1846?) * Symphony No. 3 in E-flat major, Op. 31 (1855) = Overtures = * Concert Overture in A major, Op. 7 * Hero und Leander, Op. 11 * Lustspielouvert√ºre, Op. 53 = Concertos = * Clarinet Concerto, Op. 29 * Concert Piece for Oboe and Orchestra, Op. 33 * Cello Concerto, Op. 16 Legacy The Louisville Orchestra First Edition series contained, besides many works mostly by modern composers (usually American), Rietz' Concert Overture, opus 7 (coupled with the second symphony of Max Bruch), and recorded around 1970.\\"Louisville Orchestra LS 703\\", 1970 series, number 3: with Jorge Mester conducting the orchestra.

The Avenue stretches four blocks from Lake Worth to the Atlantic Ocean. Worth Avenue also includes smaller, architecturally significant \\"vias\\" off the main avenue. These pedestrian areas distinguish Worth Avenue from other shopping streets.  History  In 1913 the street was named after General William Jenkins Worth. The first steps to become fashionable started with the construction in 1918 of the Everglades Club at the west end of a dirt road. Rising rents at the then-fashionable Beaux Arts Building on Lake Trail, north of the Biltmore Hotel, caused merchants to move south to what became Worth Avenue. The first stores were built near the Everglades Club on Via Mizner and Via Parigi, named for Worth Avenue's original developers, architect Addison Mizner and Paris Singer. The area became known for its high-quality merchandise in the 1920s. Recognizing the value of the undeveloped street, the merchants formed the Worth Avenue Association in 1938. This organization maintains guidelines for the appearance, parking, etc. of the stores and the street. 347 Worth Ave In 1942, Mary Duggett Benson opened the Worth Avenue Gallery, eventually located at 347 Worth Avenue. Benson's gallery was an integral part of the visual arts in Palm Beach until Benson retired and closed the gallery in 1965. Contrary to a few assumptions, Benson owned the gallery, not her friend Alice De Lamar. According to documents filed with the state of Florida, Benson owned it at first with a relative and then 100% on her own. De Lamar's other friend, Emily Rayner, sister of the New York artist/art dealer Betty Parsons, co-directed the gallery with Mary Benson. While it was Benson's gallery, De Lamar's artist friends often exhibited there.Pollack, Deborah, Palm Beach Visual Arts, Pelican Publishing Co., 2016, 93-95, 138. Worth Avenue sidewalk Worth Avenue was lined with coconut palms that succumbed to lethal yellowing blight in the 1970s. Adonidia or \\"Christmas palms\\" replaced them, but they were not in proportion to the buildings on the street. The street was renovated in 1983, but major makeover was completed in 2010. The $15.8 million Worth Avenue Improvement Project was conducted during the off-season and lasted two years, with the Town of Palm Beach and City of West Palm Beach responsible for $1.25 million of the cost and $14.77 million from the issuance of public improvement revenue bonds. This major streetscape redesign included planting of 200 mature coconut palms, each from tall, installing tabby concrete sidewalks that are typically used for expensive residences, and building a clock tower on the beach side.  Retailers  The avenue's oldest store, , has been in business since 1923. Reflecting the lifestyle of Palm Beach market, the street has approximately 250 high-end shops, boutiques, restaurants, and art galleries, that include Trillion, Giorgio Armani, Neiman Marcus, Cartier, Louis Vuitton, Tiffany & Co., Tourneau, Herm√®s, Ralph Lauren, Gucci, Chanel, Vineyard Vines, Brooks Brothers, Salvatore Ferragamo, Island Company, St. John, Valentino, and many more. An open-air mall, 150 Worth (formerly The Esplanade, and built by Murray H. Goodman), lies at the eastern end of Worth Avenue, and offers a variety of upscale shops anchored by department stores Saks Fifth Avenue.

Etymology Major Tufail Muhammad Shaheed (Nishan e Haider) The exact origin of Burewala's name is unknown; however, there are different theories. One theory is that the city is named after a person named \\"Burha.\\" He was, according to some people, 'Sikh'. The village is also called \\"Old Bura\\" or \\"Purana Boora.\\" The people of this villages constructed a well with a diameter of 8 feet and named it after their ancestor so it was called \\"Chah Boorhay wala\\" (Well of Burha). This well is now included in the P.I. Link canal. Due to this well the new city was named Burewala. In July 1976, Burewala was upgraded as a subdivision.

The entire administration is done via a webbrowser and is possible from all computers having access to the m23 server. m23 is developed predominantly by Hauke Goos-Habermann since the end of 2002. m23 differentiates between servers and clients. An m23 server is used for software distribution and the management of the clients. Computers which are administered (e.g. software is installed) through the m23 server are the clients. The client is booted over the network during the installation of the operating system. It is possible to start the client with a bootrom on its network card, a boot disk or a boot CD. The client's hardware is detected and set up. The gathered hardware and partition information is sent to the m23 server. Afterwards, this information is shown in the m23 administration interface. Now the administrator has to choose how to partition and format the client. There are other settings, too, e.g. the distribution to be installed on the client. The m23 clients can be installed as workstation with the graphical user interfaces KDE 5.x, GNOME 3.x, Xfce, Unity, LXDE and pure X11 or as a server without graphical subsystem. In most server setups, the server does not need a user interface because most of the server software runs in text mode. M23 is released under the GNU GPL. Some features (The complete and topical list of all features is available at ) * Three steps to a complete client: To install a client via m23 is rather simple. Only three steps are needed for a completely installed client. * Integration of existing clients into m23: Existing Debian-based systems can be assimilated into the m23 system easily and administered like a normal client (installed with m23). * Group functions: The group functions allows the management of a large number of clients that need to be updated or to install new software or if other routine jobs need to be done. E.g. a new software package can be installed on all clients or be removed from all clients of a group. * Mass installation: The mass installation tools allow to install many clients with similar requirements at once. A virtual client, that holds the basic settings (such as the default gateway or the group name), is defined. This virtual client can be used to derive and install an arbitrary number of (real) clients. * Imaging: Installation using image files: An image file of a partition or entire harddisk can be used to install other clients. These image files are taken from installed clients with all their software packages and settings. * Support for software RAIDs: Partitions or entire harddrives can be combined into software RAIDs. m23 supports the RAID levels 0, 1, 4, 5, 6 and 10. RAIDs can be used like normal partitions to install operating systems to or to use them as swap or storage space. * User management with LDAP: User accounts can be stored on a central LDAP server. This increases the ease of use in environments with many clients and a lot of users. The OpenLDAP server is shipped with the m23 server and can be administered via the highly integrated phpLDAPadmin. * Pool builder: The pool builder makes it possible to combine software packages from different media (CD, DVD, internet) on the m23 server and convert them to a local package source. These package sources can be used to install clients. This can be done without an internet connection or if the internet connection is rather slow. It is possible, too, to add selfmade packages to the pool.

It was founded in 1975, when it was renamed from Bayero University College and upgraded from university college to university. It is the first university in Kano State. History Bayero University initially bore the name Ahmadu Bello College, the college was named after Premier of Northern Nigeria, Ahmadu Bello. It was founded in January 1960 by the Northern Nigeria Ministry of Education headed by Isa Kaita to prepare senior secondary certificate holders for G.C.E. and A-level in Arabic, Hausa, Islamic History, Islamic studies and English Literature. Upon the establishment of Ahmadu Bello University in Zaria, Kaduna State, Ahmadu Bello College was renamed to Abdullahi Bayero College, after Abdullahi Bayero, Emir of Kano and soon thereafter it became a faculty of the new university. Initially located on the grounds of the School of Arabic Studies near the palace of the Emir, the college moved to a location at the old Kano Airport Hotel, where it remained until March 1968, when it moved to Western Kano to make way for a military hospital (the Nigerian Civil War having started the previous year). The first students began their studies in February 1964, and they graduated in July 1966. In 1975, the college became a university college, and was renamed Bayero University College, with Mahmud Tukur as principal. In 1977, the status was again changed, to that of university, and Bayero University became the name; Tukur became vice-chancellor. In 1980 the university ceased functioning as a faculty of its Zaria counterpart. Academic sections Bayero University has Faculties of Allied Health Sciences, Agriculture, Arts and Islamic Studies , Basic Medical Sciences, Clinical Sciences, Education, Engineering, Communications, Dentistry, Law, Physical Sciences, Life Sciences, Pharmaceutical Sciences, Earth and Environmental Sciences, Social, Management Science and Faculty of Computer Science & Information Technology. Research Centers include: Center for Advanced Medical Research, Center for Infectious Diseases, Center for Gender Studies, Center for Islamic Studies, Center for Dryland Agriculture, Center for Biotechnology Research, Center for Renewable Energy and Center for the Study of Nigerian Languages among others. The university also houses the International Institute of Islamic Banking and Finance (IIIBF), the only of its kind in the country. The university is located approximately 12.8 kilometers (roughly 8 miles) from the city along the Kano-Gwarzo Road.

Chitharal hills are locally known as Chokkanthoongi Hills. History left There are two monuments. The earlier rock-cut Jain structure of beads with inscriptions and drip-ledges is the earliest Jain monument in the southernmost part of India which was from first century BC to sixth century AD. The temple monuments were likely built by Digambara Jains in the ninth century when the region was under influence of Jainism. Jain influence in this region was due to the King Mahendravarman I (610-640). According to T. A. Gopinatha Rao who visited the monuments in 1920-21, the inscription on the southern side says a Jain priestess called Gunandagi- kurattigal, the disciple of Arattanemi - Bhatariyar of Peravakkudi, presented Bhatariyar of Tiruchchanam malai with a metallic lamp stand and a golden flower during the 28th year of reign of Vikramaditya Varaguna Pandya. It was a Jain training centre for both males and females in past. The inscription is in old Tamil script known as Vatteluthu. The Travancore Archaeological Series says that Tiruchcharanattu malai, the name of the hills, means the hill of the Charanas. Charanas means Jain ascetics which were living on the hills. The votive images on the rock with inscription under each of it names an ascetic or person who carved it. It is a centrally protected monument (N-TN-T2) maintained by Thrissur Circle of Archaeological Survey of India since 1964. It is inscribed as Bhagawati temple and Jaina bas-relief.  Description  A natural cavern formed by overhanging rock has a bas-relief sculptures of Jain Tirthankaras which were carved in later phase. The relief of Parshwanatha and Padmavati is standing figures canopied by multi-hooded cobra and with attendant figures of Yaksha. The figures seated in ardha- padmasana pose in each niches with three tiered parasol is that of other Tirthankaras (possibly of all 24 Tithankaras). there are three standing figures of Tirthankara in on of the left corner. The central niche has a figure of Mahavira with three tiered parasol, chhatratrayi chaitya with a tree above it and attendant figures. There is another female figure of Ambika in a niche next to it. It has attendant figures including two children and a lion mount. All major niches has flying figures of Vidyadharas or worshippers. Each of this figures has a short inscription below the seat mentioning a name of donor and place in Vatteluthu Tamil script. Based on these inscription, it is known that the site was under control of Jains at least till middle of thirteenth century.http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-YrAUaXmP6q8/URNs5F8uoUI/AAAAAAAAELU/9tW_MqcIdfY/s1600/krishnasepages.blogspot.com_14ChitharalRockcutTemple.JPG The monuments are reached by roughly hewn steps in rocks and the narrow entrance between them. On the top of the hill, there in a cave temple with mandapa, a varandah corridor and a balipeetham with a kitchen (madappalli) which is carved into a natural overhanging rock facing the west. It has three sanctums which houses the Tirthankara (possibly Mahavira) in middle, goddess in the right and Parshwanatha on the left. The gopuram of the central shrine is destroyed possibly due to lightning. The temple was built in medieval period. There is another temple-like structure (Vimana) on the top of the hill which is reached by climbing few steps. There is a natural pond few steps downwards. Around 13th century, the cave temple was converted into Hindu temple of Bhagavati. It is known by the Tamil script inscription on the entrance of the mandapa dated to 475 KE (1300 AD) which says Narayanan, Tamil Appalla Varaiyan of Rajavallapuram in the Kil Vembanadu donated some money for the expense of Bhagavati temple.

This can be implemented by transferring assets, that is, selling investments of an asset class that is overweight and using the money to buy investments in a class that is underweight, but it also applies to adding or removing money from a portfolio, that is, putting new money into an underweight class, or making withdrawals from an overweight class. Rebalancing of investment is a concave trading strategy; as opposed to constant proportion portfolio insurance (CPPI), which has convex payoff characteristic. Rebalancing to control risk The investments in a portfolio will perform according to the market. As time goes on, a portfolio's current asset allocation will drift away from an investor's original target asset allocation (i.e., their preferred level of risk exposure). If left unadjusted, the portfolio will either become too risky, or too conservative. If it becomes too risky, that will tend to increase long-term returns, which is desirable. But when the excessive risks show up in the short term, the investor might have a tendency to do the worst possible thing at the worst possible time (i.e., sell at the bottom), thus dramatically diminishing their ending wealth. If the portfolio is allowed to drift to a too conservative status, then excessive short-term risk is less likely, which is desirable. However, long- term returns would also tend to be lower than desired. It is best to maintain a portfolio's risk profile reasonably close to an investor's level of risk tolerance. The goal of rebalancing is to move the current asset allocation back in line to the originally planned asset allocation (i.e., their preferred level of risk exposure). This rebalancing strategy is specifically known as a Constant-Mix Strategy and is one of the four main dynamic strategies for asset allocation. The other three strategies are 1) Buy-and-Hold, 2) Constant- Proportion and 3) Option-Based Portfolio Insurance. Rebalancing bonus The promise of higher returns from rebalancing to a static asset allocation was introduced by William J. Bernstein in 1996. It has since been shown to only exist under certain situations that investors are not able to predict. At other times rebalancing can reduce returns. Most agree that: * A potential rebalancing bonus is determined by two assets' relative variances and covariance. These metrics are developed by averaging historical returns, which are no guarantee of future results in the short term or long term. E.g. debt is traditionally thought to be negatively correlated to equities, but during the 'Great Moderation' they were positively correlated. * The bonus would be maximized by a 50:50 weighting between the two assets. But that is not to say any particular portfolio should have that weighting. * The bonus is greater when each asset's price swings widely, so that each rebalancing creates an entry point at a very low cost relative to the trend. But that is not to say price volatility is a desirable attribute of any asset. * The bonus is greater when the prices of both assets are increasing at roughly the same trend rate of return. If one asset's growth is much lower, each rebalancing would push money from the winning asset into the losing (or lesser return) asset. * The bonus is greater when returns are negatively correlated and revert to their mean on the same cycle as the rebalancing takes place. The Constant-Mix rebalancing strategy will outperform all other strategies in oscillating markets. The Buy-and-Hold rebalancing strategy will outperform in up-trending markets. Rebalancing strategies There are several rebalancing strategies: *Buy and hold *Constant proportion portfolio insurance *Constant mix * Maximizing Sharpe ratio Some say that the exact choice is probably not too important, as long as the rebalancing is performed consistently. Some say otherwise, such as: * Rebalancing every year: : Rebalancing at exactly the same time each year is easy to remember. * Rebalancing every 15 months: : The hope is to make a sale qualify for long term capital gain in the United States. * Rebalancing when current allocation is 5% off from target asset allocation: : Touch nothing except when allocation is off noticeably. * Rebalance using contributions or withdrawals: : Buy underweighted assets when contributing and sell overweighted assets when withdrawing. This minimizes transaction costs. The contributed or withdrawn amount can be divided across assets in an optimal way that avoids overshooting and minimizes deviation from the target allocation. Also * Rebalance Symmetrically whereby allocations across assets or asset categories are traded back to target. * Rebalance Asymmetrically whereby allocations are only traded where Assets or categories breach tolerances around a target - this is a Transaction Cost Sensitive approach.

This policy is also said to have been adopted because in the age of typewriter-based printing, more complicated Kanji could not be clearly printed. This newspaper also is currently the only publication using this simplification practice. These simplifications are not used in other publications by the Asahi Shimbun company. Some of these Asahi simplifications have been included in the JIS X 0208 and above character sets, and even more (although lesser supported) are included in Unicode.

He competed at the 1936 Summer Olympics and the 1948 Summer Olympics. Career Podhajsky was born in Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and was an officer in the Austrian Army, rising to the rank of Colonel. In 1939, Podhajsky became chief of the Academy of Classical Horsemanship, better known as the Spanish Riding School of Vienna, Austria. Founded in 1572, the school's main focus was the training of Lipizzan horses in the art of Classical dressage. Podhajsky was director of the school throughout World War II and continued in the position until his retirement in 1965. Following his retirement, he continued to teach classical horsemanship, and wrote a number of books on the topic. Podhajsky died following a stroke in 1973, in Vienna, Austria. Relocation during World War II During World War II, worried for the safety of the school and the horses due to bombing raids on Vienna, Podhajsky evacuated most of the stallions out of the city to Sankt Martin im Innkreis in Upper Austria. A number of mares from the Piber Federal Stud, the breeding farm that supplied horses for the school, were also evacuated. Though the horses were in relative safety, there were still harsh challenges; there was little food for human or animals, and starving refugees sometimes attempted to steal the horses, viewing them as a source of meat. As American General George Patton was leading his troops through Austria, he was alerted to the presence of the Lipizzans in Sankt Martin im M√ºhlkreis.Letts, Elizabeth. 2016. The Perfect Horse: The Daring U.S. Mission to Rescue the Priceless Stallions Kidnapped by the Nazis. Ballantine Books. Patton and Podhajsky had each competed in equestrian events at the Olympic Games. The two men renewed their acquaintance, and after Podhajsky orchestrated an impressive performance by the remaining horses and riders of the school in front of Patton (a lifelong horseman) and Undersecretary of War Robert P. Patterson, the Americans agreed to place the stallions under the protection of the United States for the duration of the war. Podhajsky later wrote about these events, an account which was made into a motion picture Miracle of the White Stallions by Walt Disney studios, with actor Robert Taylor playing Colonel Podhajsky. Podhajsky alerted Patton to the location of additional Lipizzan bloodstock. Many Lipizzan mares and some stallions had been appropriated by the Germans from the Austrian breeding farm at Piber and sent to Hostau, to a Nazi-run stud farm in Czechoslovakia (now the Czech Republic). When Hostau fell behind Soviet lines, captured German officers, under interrogation by U.S. Army Captain Ferdinand Sperl, provided details on the Lipizzans' location and asked the Americans to rescue the horses before they fell into Soviet hands, because it was feared they would be slaughtered for horsemeat. Patton issued orders, and on April 28, 1945, Colonel Charles H. Reed, with members of Troops A, C and F of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, conducted a raid behind Soviet lines, accepted the surrender of the Germans at Hostau, and evacuated the horses. The Lipizzans were relocated to Wels, then to Wimsbach, Upper Austria. After the war, the Lipizzan stallions finally returned to Vienna in the autumn of 1955. Legacy Podhajsky is remembered most for saving the Lipizzans, preserving their history following the war, as well as for his dedication to the advancement of Classical dressage, and his contributions to the Spanish Riding School. He was awarded Order of Saint Sava. See also *Classical dressage *Spanish Riding School *Lipizzan *Equestrian at the Summer Olympics *George S.

Schuch first studied law but then turned to music, trained at first by E. Stolz. He studied in Graz and later in Vienna, briefly with Felix Otto Dessoff, and started his conducting career in 1867 as Kapellmeister at Lobe's Theatre in Breslau while the Breslau Opera was out of action following a fire. Coincidentally, a father and son with the same family name Schuch had built and run the first opera theatre in Breslau 120 years earlier:Erika Fischer-Lichte History of European Drama and Theatre Page 150 2002 \\"After Schuch was brutally rejected by the city council in the merchant city, Frankfurt, because of bitter controversy between religious leaders, he succeeded in gaining citizen's rights in Breslau in 1754. He built a theatre there on his own land, and performed regularly from 1755 to 1764.\\"North German Opera in the Age of Goethe - Page 83 Thomas Bauman - 1985 \\"Breslau in Silesia offered German companies an attractive alternative to Leipzig or Berlin. Like them, it could support a company from autumn ... the charming name Theater on the Cold Ashes. Schuch brought the first Hiller operas to Breslau in 1770, and his successor Johann Christian Waser introduced many more. In addition, Breslau saw the premieres of three new operas of its own in 1771 and 1772. \\" There followed engagements in W√ºrzburg (1868‚Äì1870), Graz (1870/1871) and Basle, until he was employed in 1872 by Pollini's Italian Opera for Dresden. There in 1872 he became Music director at the Court Opera, from 1873 Royal Kapellmeister with Julius Rietz, later with Franz W√ºllner. In 1878, he was appointed Royal Professor. In 1882 he undertook the direction of the Court Opera with the title of privy councillor, and in 1889 became its general music director. From 1882 onward, he lived in Niederl√∂√ünitz in the Weintraubenstra√üe (in 1883 renamed at his own suggestion as Schuchstra√üe 15/17). In 1898, he was ennobled by the Austrian emperor and in 1899 was appointed to the Saxon Confidential Privy Council. His period of influence is known as the Schuch era in operatic performing history. Tours as guest conductor in Berlin, Munich, Vienna and Paris aside, he remained committed to Dresden until 1914, and made its opera house there into one of the leading musical stages of Europe. He created a surpassing ensemble and enlarged the orchestra to make it one of the greatest in the world. Specializing in the music-dramas of Wagner, he also led the original productions of the Richard Strauss operas Feuersnot (1901), Salome (1905), Elektra (1909) and Der Rosenkavalier (1911) as well as the first German productions of operas by Puccini and Mascagni, and the Dresden premi√®re of Wagner's Parsifal on 24 March 1914, his last new production before his death on 10 May. Also highly valued as a nonoperatic conductor, he was particularly known in the concert hall for his renditions of the orchestral works of Felix Draeseke and Strauss. He married coloratura soprano Clementine von Schuch-Proska (Klementine Proch√°zka) (1850-1932), who became an honorary member of Dresden's Royal Theatre Company.

He led the premieres of Richard Wagner's operas Das Rheingold and Die Walk√ºre, but was much criticized by Wagner himself, who greatly preferred the more celebrated conductors Hans von B√ºlow and Hermann Levi. Biography W√ºllner was born in M√ºnster and studied in his native place, and at Frankfurt, Berlin, Brussels, and Munich. Among his teachers was Anton Schindler, who styled himself Beethoven's amanuensis carrying on the true traditions of the master's style, a claim disputed by Beethoven's pupil Carl Czerny. In 1856 W√ºllner became instructor in piano at the Munich Conservatory. He held the position of town musical director at Aix-la-Chapelle from 1858 to 1864. In 1867 he became director of the choral classes in the reorganized School of Music at Munich and wrote for them Chor√ºbungen der M√ºnchener Musikschule, text of score reading and singing (Solfege).New International Encyclopedia He succeeded the temperamental B√ºlow in 1869 as conductor of the Court Opera and the Academy Courts. Here he conducted the first performances of Rheingold and Walk√ºre (1869, 1870) before the production of the entire Ring cycle at the first Bayreuth Festival of 1876. It is for these renditions that he is usually remembered now. He became court kapellmeister at Dresden and artistic director of the conservatory in 1877, and director of the Cologne conservatory and conductor of the G√ºrzenich concerts in 1884. After 1864 he appeared frequently as conductor of the Lower Rhenish Music Festival. He died in Braunfels. Among his notable pupils were Volkmar Andreae, Fritz Brun, Lothar Kempter, Bruno Klein, Jan van Gilse, Hans von Koessler, Karl Aagard √òstvig, Ernst von Schuch, and the conductor Willem Mengelberg. Mengelberg controversially claimed that his teacher's ties with Schindler gave Mengelberg a direct connection with Beethoven performance tradition. Among his works are: Heinrich der Finkler, a cantata for solo, male chorus, and orchestra; additional recitatives to Weber's Oberon, accepted by many of Germany's principal theatres; Psalm 125, for chorus and orchestra; Miserere for double choir; and Stabat Mater for double choir; besides masses, motets, songs, chamber music, and piano pieces. W√ºllner was one of the editors of the Bach- Gesellschaft-Ausgabe, the first complete edition of the works of Johann Sebastian Bach. Recording There is a recording fragment in the Thomas Edison National Historical Park archive from 1890 featuring W√ºllner at the piano accompanying the singer Karl Mayer in Schubert's 'Wohin?'. This makes W√ºllner the earliest-born person whose piano playing has been recorded acoustically (Saint-Sa√´ns is usually credited with that, although he was born 3 years after W√ºllner, and Carl Reinecke (b.1824) left some piano rolls and not acoustic recordings). Unfortunately, the recording quality of the W√ºllner cylinder is now so degraded that almost nothing can be discerned about the piano playing at all.

A consul is distinguished from an ambassador, the latter being a representative from one head of state to another, but both have a form of immunity. There can be only one ambassador from one country to another, representing the first country's head of state to that of the second, and their duties revolve around diplomatic relations between the two countries; however, there may be several consuls, one in each of several major cities, providing assistance with bureaucratic issues to both the citizens of the consul's own country traveling or living abroad and to the citizens of the country in which the consul resides who wish to travel to or trade with the consul's country. A less common usage is an administrative consul, who takes a governing role and is appointed by a country that has colonised or occupied another. Lu√≠s de Cam√µes Square in Lisbon, Portugal was the site of the Consulate-General of Brazil for more than a century._new Brazilian Consulate address, Lisbon, 2015, Rua Ant√≥nio Maria Cardoso, n¬∫ 39.  Antecedent: the classical Greek proxenos  In classical Greece, some of the functions of the modern consul were fulfilled by a proxenos. Unlike the modern position, this was a citizen of the host polity (in Greece, a city-state). The proxenos was usually a wealthy merchant who had socio-economic ties with another city and who helped its citizens when they were in trouble in his own city. The position of proxenos was often hereditary in a particular family. Modern honorary consuls fulfill a function that is to a degree similar to that of the ancient Greek institution. Historical development of the terms Consuls were the highest magistrates of the Roman Republic and Roman Empire. The term was revived by the Republic of Genoa, which, unlike Rome, bestowed it on various state officials, not necessarily restricted to the highest. Among these were Genoese officials stationed in various Mediterranean ports, whose role included duties similar to those of the modern consul, i. e. helping Genoese merchants and sailors in difficulties with the local authorities. The consolat de mar was an institution established under the reign of Peter IV of Aragon in the fourteenth century, and spread to 47 locations throughout the Mediterranean. It was primarily a judicial body, administering maritime and commercial law as Lex Mercatoria. Although the consolat de mar was established by the Corts General (parliament) of the Crown of Aragon, the consuls were independent from the King. This distinction between consular and diplomatic functions remains (at least formally) to this day. Modern consuls retain limited judicial powers to settle disputes on ships from their country (notably regarding the payment of wages to sailors). The consulado de mercaderes was set up in 1543 in Seville as a merchant guild to control trade with Latin America. As such, it had branches in the principal cities of the Spanish colonies. The connection of \\"consul\\" with trade and commercial law is retained in French. In Francophone countries, a juge consulaire (consular judge) is a non-professional judge elected by the chamber of commerce to settle commercial disputes in the first instance (in France, sitting in panels of three; in Belgium, in conjunction with a professional magistrate). Consulates and embassies Consulate-General of Indonesia in Houston is Indonesia's representation in Houston, Texas, United States. Consulate of Kazakhstan in Omsk, Russia Consulate of Denmark in Hamburg The office of a consul is a consulate and is usually subordinate to the state's main representation in the capital of that foreign country (host state), usually an embassy or ‚Äì between Commonwealth countries ‚Äì high commission. Like the terms embassy or high commission, consulate may refer not only to the office of consul, but also to the building occupied by the consul and their staff. The consulate may share premises with the embassy itself. =Consular rank= A consul of the highest rank is termed a consul-general, and is appointed to a consulate-general. There are typically one or more deputy consuls-general, consuls, vice-consuls, and consular agents working under the consul-general. A country may appoint more than one consul-general to another nation. =Authority and activities= Consuls of various ranks may have specific legal authority for certain activities, such as notarizing documents. As such, diplomatic personnel with other responsibilities may receive consular letters patent (commissions). Aside from those outlined in the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, there are few formal requirements outlining what a consular official must do. For example, for some countries, consular officials may be responsible for the issue of visas; other countries may limit \\"consular services\\" to providing assistance to compatriots, legalization of documents, etc. Nonetheless, consulates proper will be headed by consuls of various ranks, even if such officials have little or no connection with the more limited sense of consular service. Activities of a consulate include protecting the interests of their citizens temporarily or permanently resident in the host country, issuing passports; issuing visas to foreigners and public diplomacy. However, the principal role of a consulate lies traditionally in promoting trade‚Äîassisting companies to invest and to import and export goods and services both inwardly to their home country and outward to their host country. Although it is not admitted publicly, consulates, like embassies, may also gather intelligence information from the assigned country. Consular districts =Role in diplomatic missions= Contrary to popular belief, many of the staff of consulates may be career diplomats, but they do not generally have diplomatic immunity unless they are also accredited as such. Immunities and privileges for consuls and accredited staff of consulates (consular immunity) are generally limited to actions undertaken in their official capacity and, with respect to the consulate itself, to those required for official duties. In practice, the extension and application of consular privileges and immunities can differ widely from country to country. Consulates are more numerous than diplomatic missions, such as embassies. Ambassadors are posted only in a foreign nation's capital (but exceptionally outside the country, as in the case of a multiple mandate; e.g., a minor power may accredit a single ambassador with several neighbouring states of modest relative importance that are not considered important allies). Consuls are posted in a nation's capital, and in other cities throughout that country, especially centres of economic activity and cities where large populations of citizens from the consul's home country reside (expatriates). In the United States, for example, most countries have a consulate-general in New York City, (the home of the United Nations), and some have consulates-general in several major cities, such as Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, or San Francisco. Many countries have multiple consular offices in nations such as Germany, Russia, Canada, Brazil, and Australia. Consulates are subordinate posts of their home country's diplomatic mission (typically an embassy, in the capital city of the host country). Diplomatic missions are established in international law under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, while consulates-general and consulates are established in international law under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. Formally, at least within the US system, the consular career (ranking in descending order: consul-general, consul, vice-consul, honorary consul) forms a different hierarchy from the diplomats in the strict sense. However, it is common for individuals to be transferred from one hierarchy to the other, and for consular officials to serve in a capital carrying out strictly consular duties within the consular section of a diplomatic post; e.g., within an embassy. Between Commonwealth countries, both diplomatic and consular activities may be undertaken by a High Commission in the capital, although larger Commonwealth nations generally also have consulates and consulates-general in major cities. For example, Toronto in Canada, Sydney in Australia and Auckland, New Zealand, are of greater economic importance than their respective national capitals, hence the need for consulates there.

Marut Appointed as Director of the Taipei Office of the American Institute in Taiwan, American Institute in Taiwan, 8 May 2012 Consul general A consul general is an official who heads a consulate general and is a consul of the highest rank serving at a particular location. A consul general may also be responsible for consular districts which contain other, subordinate consular offices within a country. The consul general serves as a representative who speaks on behalf of their state in the country where they are located, although ultimate jurisdiction over the right to speak on behalf of a home country within another country ultimately belongs to the single ambassador. Another definition is the leader of the consular section of an embassy. This consul general is a diplomat and a member of the ambassador's country team. Consul General is abbreviated \\"CG\\", and the plural form is 'consuls general'. Honorary consul Honorary consulate of Poland in Jerusalem Honorary consulate of Portugal in Mindelo, Cape Verde Some consuls are not career officials of the represented state. They may be local people with the nationality of the sending country,See Chapter 1, Section 1, Article 22 of convention and in smaller cities, or in cities that are very distant from full-time diplomatic missions, a foreign government which feels that some form of representation is nevertheless desirable may appoint a person who has not hitherto been part of their diplomatic service to fulfill this role. Such a consul may well combine the job with their own (often commercial) private activities, and in some instances may not even be a citizen of the sending country. Such consular appointments are usually given the title of honorary consul or consul ad honorem. In addition, the U.S. Secretary of State (in a memo issued on 6 August 2003) states the following concerning honorary consuls in the USA: As a matter of U.S. policy, honorary consular officers recognized by the U.S. Government are American citizens, or permanent resident aliens who perform consular services on a part-time basis. The limited immunity afforded honorary consular officers is specified in Article 71 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (VCCR). Such individuals do not enjoy personal inviolability, and may be arrested pending trial if circumstances should otherwise warrant. However, appropriate steps are provided to accord to such officers the protection required by virtue of their official position. In addition, the consular archives and documents of a consular post headed by an honorary consular officer are inviolable at all times, and wherever they may be, provided they are kept separate from other papers and documents of a private or commercial nature relating to other activities of an honorary consular officer or persons working with that consular officer. Despite their other roles, honorary consular officers (in the widest use of the term) in some instances also have responsibility for the welfare of citizens of the appointing country within their bailiwick. For example, the Embassy of Finland states that the tasks of Finland's Honorary Consulate include monitoring the rights of Finns and permanent residents of Finland residing in the area in which the consulate is located, providing advice and guidance for distressed Finnish citizens and permanent residents traveling abroad to that area, and assisting them in their contacts with local authorities or the nearest Finnish embassy or consulate. Certain types of notarized certificates can be acquired through an honorary consul. Together with diplomatic missions, an honorary consul promotes economic and cultural relations between Finland and the country in question, and takes part in strengthening Finland's image abroad. An honorary consul can advise Finnish companies, for instance, in obtaining information about local business culture and in finding cooperation partners. Historical role =L√ºbeck= In the social life of 19th-century L√ºbeck as depicted in Thomas Mann's novel Buddenbrooks ‚Äì based on Mann's thorough personal knowledge of his own birthplace ‚Äì an appointment as the consul of a foreign country was a source of considerable social prestige among the city's merchant elite. As depicted in the book, the position of a consul for a particular country was in practice hereditary in a specific family, whose mansion bore the represented country's coat of arms, and with that country confirming the consul's son or other heir in the position on the death of the previous consul. As repeatedly referenced by Mann, a consul's wife was known as \\"Consulin\\" and continued to bear that title even on the death of her husband. Characters in the book are mentioned as consuls for Denmark, the Netherlands and Portugal. =Colonial and similar roles= =Concessions and extraterritoriality= =European consuls in the Ottoman Empire= See also *Consul *Administrative consul *Agent general *Capitulation (treaty) *Consular corps *Diplomacy Footnotes References   * * External links *Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (1963) *Conditions of the Ahd-name granted by Mehmed II to the Genoese of Galata * Category:Diplomats by role Category:Gubernatorial titles !

Overview It is about inland from the city centre at an elevation of 1800 feet (600 m ASL). Although Durban is semi-tropical and very humid, Gillitts is above the humidity and is not humid, except when it is in the clouds, which generally occurs in summer. It is in the mist belt area, so this area gets a fair amount of mist which many of the residents complain about. It is positioned near the currently burgeoning Hillcrest and Kloof. The whole area is known as the Upper Highway Area as the M13 highway intersects it. While some residents do seem to complain about the mist, it does usually come as a welcome relief to the intense humidity of the area. Gillitts has remained fairly stable while Kloof and Hillcrest in the surrounding areas are growing quite rapidly. This can be attributable to the fact that there is very little area for Gillitts to grow. Gillitts originated as an extensive farm that extended over the whole of the Upper Highway area, but over time, the farm was sold off and now only the 100-year-old farmhouse remains inside the Gillitts Driving Range and 9-hole, mashie golf course. This golf course is one of the best designed courses of its size in KZN. The area of Gillitts extends along either side of the M13 highway which stretches from Durban to Pietermaritzburg. The M13 replaced the Old Main Road between the two cities, and a section of Old Main Road is now the major road through the south side of Gillitts. Off of Stockville Road ‚Äì one of the other main roads in Gillitts suburb ‚Äì a large ethnic Indian population lives, and over the traditional Indian festivals, fireworks are very prominent as part of their celebrations, especially over Dipvali and New Years. On the northern side of the M13, known as Gillitts Park, the old train line from Durban to Pietermaritzburg winds through the residential areas. This train line is no longer in regular use, and is only used by the Umgeni Steam Railway, who runs a tourist service of carriages through from Kloof Train Station to Cato Ridge on the last Sunday of every month. This train is pulled by 'Maureen', a restored Class 3BR No. 1486 steam engine built in 1912 and the sound of the train whistle echoing through the neighbourhood on a Sunday morning is a reminder of a quieter time of life. The Gillitts Train Station on the line in the middle of Gillitts is derelict and currently not used, but is a beautiful example of 1900-era architecture. Dating back to the Boer War in the first decade of the 20th century, the train station was a stop for British soldiers transiting from Durban through to the Midland battlefields as well as returning wounded soldiers. During the Boer War, the Gillitts family farm held a garrison of British troops, who built a small dam for water and a camp in what is now Camp Road. The dam still exists in a picturesque natural park amongst the houses on what is now Ashley Drive and contains bass, barbel and other fish species as well as supporting a variety of other waterfowl. The Gillitts Conservancy is a very active organisation who manages the Iphithi Nature Reserve in the middle of northern Gillitts. This nature reserve is a success story. Situated in a valley between two roads, it was a stand of invader species Blue Gum trees for 50 years until 2001. The residents bordering the valley organised a committee and contracted a logger to fell the Blue Gums. As the wood was valuable as timber, the committee was paid a lump sum which it used to found the nature reserve, fence off the additional entrances and pay for the laying of paths, building of viewing decks and planting of indigenous species. Today the Iphithi Nature Reserve is a 15 Hectare stand of indigenous forest, wetland and grasslands and home to many species of birds, small mammals and even a dam has been built which is populated with fish. The walks and park benches are popular with the residents and the park is quite heavily used on weekends. With plot sizes of minimum half-an-acre, very few cluster developments, no commercial or industrial development and this very active environmentalist population, Gillitts still houses hundreds of birds and indigenous wildlife including small buck, duiker, Iphithi and porcupine. In the first six months of 2009, we have seen an upsurge in housebreakings in the area. Traditionally an out-of-the-way neighbourhood, Gillitts Park has been largely spared the crime problems that the rest of the country has experienced. The recent upsurge in incidents has led to the formation of a neighbourhood watch association. Called the Gillitts Park Streetwatch, this organisation is composed of residents who have contracted a service provider to provide cellphone communications links between members. By watching out for each other and working with local law enforcement, the 860-home neighbourhood saw nine arrests of housebreakers in four weeks. The crime rate has since dropped off. Gillitts Park Gillitts Park is a small residential suburb of Durban, South Africa. Comprising the northern half of the suburb of Gillitts, Gillitts Park is a green belt residential area with almost no commercial development and no industrial development. In its entirety, Gillitts Park consists of about 900 homes in freehold, residential sites with a minimum plot size of . There are also about 200 cluster developmentunits scattered through the neighbourhood, the most prominent being Augusta Golf Estate. Situated about inland from the Durban and at an altitude of above sea level, Gillitts Park experiences a warm year-round climate, with no frost or snow in winter and drastically reduced humidity when compared with the coastal suburbs. Commercial development is limited to home- offices, a small, single-storey office building and the Emberton Mashie Golf Course, 9-hole course as well as a driving range and coffee shop. Having experienced an upsurge in residential housebreakings during the first half of 2009, residents banded together to form the Gillitts Park Streetwatch. This organisation is a 'Neighbourhood Watch'-type structure, with the additional function of re-creating a sense of community and maintaining the beautiful environment of the area.

Busch was born in Siegen, Westphalia, to a musical family, and studied at the Cologne Conservatory. After army service in the First World War, he was appointed to senior posts in two German opera houses. At the Stuttgart Opera (1918 to 1922) he modernised the repertory, and at the Dresden State Opera (1922 to 1933) he presented world premieres of operas by Richard Strauss, Ferruccio Busoni, Paul Hindemith and Kurt Weill among others. He also conducted at the Bayreuth and Salzburg Festivals. A strong anti-Nazi, Busch was dismissed from his post as director at Dresden in 1933, and made most of his later career outside Germany. He conducted in New York and London, but his main bases were Buenos Aires, where he was in charge at the Teatro Col√≥n for several opera seasons in the 1930s and 1940s; Copenhagen and Stockholm, conducting the Danish Radio Symphony Orchestra and the Stockholm Philharmonic; and Glyndebourne in England, where he was the founding musical director of Glyndebourne Festival Opera working together with the stage director Carl Ebert. Busch disliked showmanship, and was known as a scrupulous musician who strove to do justice to the composers whose works he conducted. He died suddenly in London aged 61. Life and career =Early years= Busch was born on 13 March 1890 in Siegen, Westphalia, the eldest of eight children of Wilhelm Busch and his wife Henriette. Wilhelm was a carpenter, violin-maker and music-shop keeper; his wife was an embroiderer. It was a musical family; Wilhelm and Henriette supplemented their incomes by performing dance music at weekends. Among their other children were the violinist Adolf Busch and the cellist Hermann Busch. As a boy, Busch took music lessons with his father and others, and in 1906 he entered the Cologne Conservatory, studying harmony and counterpoint with , piano with Karl Boettcher (his future father-in-law) and later Lazzaro Uzielli, and conducting with the principal, Fritz Steinbach. His relations with Steinbach were edgy, but he acknowledged the older man's influence on him. Steinbach was highly regarded by conductors as different as Arturo Toscanini and Adrian Boult; Busch thought him outstanding as an interpreter of Beethoven, Boult admired his Bach and all three put him at the top of Brahms conductors. In 1909 Busch spent a season as conductor at the Deutsches Theater, Riga, and in 1911 and 1912 he toured as a pianist. He was then appointed director of music for the city of Aachen with responsibility for the Municipal Opera and the city's celebrated choral society. Among those whose works he premiered there were Donald Tovey, who became a close friend of Busch and his brothers. In 1911 Busch married Margarete Boettcher; their first son, Hans, later a stage director, was born in 1914. Busch remained at Aachen until the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, when he enlisted in the German army, rising from the ranks to become a junior officer.\\"Dr Fritz Busch\\", The Times, 17 September 1951, p. 6 =Stuttgart and Dresden= alt=young white man, clean shaven, with full head of dark hair, neatly cut, sitting at a desk and looking at a musical score In 1918 Busch successfully applied for the vacant post of W√ºrttemberg Court Kapellmeister ‚Äì musical director of the Stuttgart Opera ‚Äì in succession to Max von Schillings. The conservative tradition of the house, until then the court opera of the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg within the German Empire, was swept away in the November Revolution of 1918, and Busch took advantage of the freedom to widen the repertoire, introducing new works by composers including Hindemith and Pfitzner, and presenting modern stagings such as Adolphe Appia's for Wagner's Ring. In 1922, Busch was appointed musical director of the Dresden State Opera. In the words of The Musical Times: > This was success indeed: a musician in his early thirties raised to the post > where Ernst von Schuch himself had conducted the premieres of [Richard > Strauss's] Salome, Elektra and Der Rosenkavalier. No opera house in Germany > held greater repute. Under Fritz Busch Dresden maintained its lead. To Dresden's series of Strauss premieres Busch added Intermezzo (1924) and Die √§gyptische Helena (1928)). He presented the world premieres of works by Ferruccio Busoni (Doktor Faust, 1925), Paul Hindemith (Cardillac, 1926) and Kurt Weill (Der Protagonist, 1926), and others, and the German premiere of Puccini's Turandot (1926). During his eleven-year tenure he kept the Dresden house at the highest level, mounting innovative, provocative stagings with the help of prominent costume and set designers. In 1924 Busch conducted Die Meistersinger at the first post-war Bayreuth Festival. The production was not a success. The cast was second-rate and there were mixed reviews for the quality of the orchestral playing.\\"Bayreuth Festival\\", The Times, 26 July 1924, p. 10; and Busch refused subsequent requests to conduct at the festival. In 1927, at the invitation of Walter Damrosch, he made his American debut, conducting the New York Symphony Orchestra: the climax of the programme was the nine-year-old Yehudi Menuhin's first performance of the Beethoven Violin Concerto. Busch was so impressed that he arranged for Menuhin to come to Dresden, where he played the Beethoven concerto, the Bach E major and the Brahms. alt= young man sitting with older, balding moustached man In 1932 Busch was invited to conduct Mozart's Die Entf√ºhrung aus dem Serail at the Salzburg Festival. Having recently been much impressed by Carl Ebert's staging of that opera in Berlin, Busch accepted the invitation on condition that Ebert should be engaged as director. The success of the production led Ebert to invite Busch to Berlin to conduct a new staging of Verdi's Un ballo in maschera, a celebrated and long-remembered production. Though not generally concerned with national or international politics, Busch had watched the rise of the Nazi Party with dismay and disgust. Not himself Jewish, he counted many Jews among his friends, valued democracy and hated dictatorship. He made no secret of his contempt for the Nazis, and after Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933, Busch was dismissed by the Nazi-dominated Saxon Landtag. Among those outraged by the affair was Strauss, whose new opera Arabella, dedicated to Busch, was to have been premiered at the Dresden opera under its dedicatee. Busch was replaced by Karl B√∂hm, a more congenial figure to the r√©gime. Although Busch was forced out of Dresden by the local Nazis, the historian Michael Kater writes that senior party figures in Berlin, notably Hermann G√∂ring, had a high regard for Busch and hoped to secure him as general director of the Staatsoper. According to Kater, Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler, chief conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic, did not want so eminent a rival as Busch in the city; as Furtw√§ngler had the backing of Hitler, the post went instead to Clemens Krauss. The last offer from the Nazis was a return to Bayreuth to replace Toscanini, who refused to work under the r√©gime. Busch too refused. =Buenos Aires, Copenhagen, Stockholm and Glyndebourne= From 1933 Busch's career was mostly outside Germany. In May of that year he accepted the musical directorship of the Teatro Col√≥n in Buenos Aires for a season. Returning to Europe at the end of the year he began a long association with the Danish Radio Symphony Orchestra and the Stockholm Philharmonic. Glyndebourne exterior (2006 photograph) In the early 1930s an English landowner, John Christie, and his wife, the singer Audrey Mildmay, conceived the idea of staging country house opera in a purpose-built opera house on the Christie estate at Glyndebourne in Sussex. In November 1933 Christie sounded Busch out about becoming his musical director; Busch was by then contractually committed in Buenos Aires, but a financial crisis in Argentina shortly afterwards enabled him to reconsider Christie's invitation. As at Salzburg, he arranged for Ebert to join him to direct productions. Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians sums up the success of the Glyndebourne enterprise: > The level achieved by the carefully chosen and rehearsed ensemble at the > summer festivals, 1934‚Äì1939, is part of operatic history. The repertory was > based on Mozart but included Donizetti's Don Pasquale and the first staging > by a British company of Verdi's Macbeth. Ironically, it was at patrician > Glyndebourne rather than at Dresden that the democratically minded Busch > came nearest to his ideal of being able \\"to build up an opera production in > the smallest detail and with ... complete respect for the work'\\". Glyndebourne's productions were enthusiastically received by reviewers and public; Busch and his forces made pioneering recordings of Le nozze di Figaro, Don Giovanni and Cos√¨ fan tutte for Fred Gaisberg and the Gramophone Company. Both at the time and later two musical idiosyncrasies were commented on: Busch's use of a piano rather than a harpsichord to accompany recitatives and the avoidance of appoggiaturas ‚Äì in both respects German musical practice being old-fashioned by international standards of the day. Busch remained musical director at Glyndebourne until the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, when the festival was suspended.Sadie, Stanley. \\"Glyndebourne\\", Grove Music Online, Oxford University Press, 2001. Retrieved 24 May 2020 He made his London debut in 1938, conducting the London Symphony Orchestra at the Queen's Hall in a programme of Mozart, Beethoven and Brahms.\\"London Symphony Orchestra\\", The Times, 29 November 1938, p. 12 Busch continued to conduct at the Teatro Col√≥n (1934‚Äì1936 and 1940‚Äì1947). Until 1940 he worked in Scandinavia during the winter months. According to Grove he grew so attached to Copenhagen that he turned down the offer to become chief conductor of the New York Philharmonic. From June 1940 to 1945 he conducted mostly in South America, except for a not wholly successful Broadway experiment on Glyndebourne lines (the New Opera Company) and guest appearances with the New York Philharmonic, both in 1942. In 1945 he conducted at the Metropolitan Opera, making his debut there with Lohengrin, and toured with the company for four seasons. New York was not to his taste: one concert promoter observed, \\"he was not a showman\\". In 1950 Busch returned to Glyndebourne when the main festival resumed there after the war. Early in 1951 he revisited Germany, conducting in Cologne and Hamburg. He returned to Glyndebourne later in the year for an all-Mozart festival ‚Äì Cos√¨ fan tutte, Figaro and Don Giovanni, and the first professional production in England of Idomeneo. Howard Taubman of The New York Times praised Ebert's \\"unflaggingly imaginative and alive\\" staging and Busch's \\"loving hand, fusing the orchestra with the singers on the stage into a laughing, glowing entity\\".Taubman, Howard. \\"3rd Mozart Opera at Glyndebourne\\", The New York Times, 28 June 1951, p. 36 In the early post-war years the Glyndebourne company appeared regularly at the Edinburgh Festival, and in August 1951 Busch was in Edinburgh to conduct his first post-war Verdi opera for the company, La forza del destino. Critics praised his \\"percipient direction\\" and \\"inspired\\" conducting.\\"Glyndebourne Opera\\", The Times, 22 August 1951, p. 2; and \\"Edinburgh Festival\\", The Stage, 30 August 1951, p. 10 On 14 September, five days after the last Edinburgh performance, Busch died suddenly of a heart attack in London at the age of 61. Reputation In the opinion of Grove, Busch was \\"the soundest type of German musician: not markedly original or spectacular, but thorough, strong-minded, decisive in intention and execution, with idealism and practical sense nicely balanced\\". The Times called him \\"a virile, faithful and extremely skilful interpreter of Mozart\\" and continued, \\"His beat like his bearing was one of quiet authority; his interpretations were fully alive without fuss or idiosyncrasy but devoted wholly to the projection of the music as he conceived the composer to have intended it\\".

They have also been referred as Beir by the Dinka and as Jebe by the Luo and Nuer, among others. The Murle speak the Murle language, which is part of the Surmic language family. The language cluster includes some adjoining groups in Sudan, as well as some non-contiguous Surmic populations in southwestern Ethiopia.  Culture  Murle in most cases practice a blend of animism and Christianity. Elders and witches often function as trouble fixers. But they are pastoralists in a country where localized and unpredictable shortages occur in rain, drinking water, bush fruits and cattle grass. This necessitates a partly nomadic lifestyle over large distances. As a result, in times of shortages they have frequently come into conflict with numerically larger groups, including the Dinka and Nuer. The Murle (like the Dinka and Nuer) have a tradition in which men can only marry when they pay a bride wealth of several dozens of cows. Education and jobs are almost absent and there are very few possibilities to earn money by producing for domestic or foreign markets. As a result, the only way to acquire cows for marriage, quicker than through breeding them, is by stealing. With roads absent and normal policing almost impossible in a vast territory, Murle, Dinka and Nuer raid each other equally, unlike the more widespread notion by the Dinka and Nuer in the Government that only the Murle are the offenders.[no cite, and the contrary has been held true by at least one anthropologist who has studied the Murle] The Murle have a historical tradition of migrating over the years in a clockwise direction around Lake Turkana (Arensen 1983). In the 1930s, they negotiated small pockets of 'homeland' in Pibor, where they are always allowed to graze their cattle and grow crops, even when in conflict with neighbors. This homeland is far too small for their survival, so they have a common interest in maintaining peace with Dinka and Nuer so that they can graze their cattle over wider areas. But the small size of their homeland and the near absence of police protection make them very vulnerable when conflicts do occur. When doubts arise that there will be peace and sufficient water and grazing rights, survival instincts align with 'bride hunger', sometimes driving the young men into risky cattle rustling adventures against their larger neighbors. In the north-south war since, the Murle were mainly underrepresented and neglected by the SPLA. They sought protection by forming an armed group to protect themselves from the former rebel SPLA and the Northern Sudanese Militias. Massacres In most South-Sudanese cattle cultures, the bride-wealth system, and illegal taxing by some unscrupulous local leaders stimulates young men to find excuses to steal cows from their own cousins. Local leaders then sometimes try to quell or prevent intra-tribal fighting, by directing that aggression outward, to other tribes. Also, Murle are feared and seen by surrounding larger tribes as having strong magical powers, and therefore they are often blamed for outbreak of diseases, theft and arson. With the country still awash with machine guns from the north-south war, 'cattle rustling' quickly runs out of control, killing dozens or hundreds of people in tit for tat escalations. Many Nuer reason that Murle are the grand children of immigrants with much less rights to use land and graze cattle. So Murle cattle, argue some Nuer, were raised on stolen grass, so most of their cattle actually belong to the Nuer. Many Murle elders argue that often if the Dinka and Nuer are facing hunger or drought, they sell their children to the Murle in exchange for cattle, then later report to the authorities that their children have been kidnapped by the Murle. In December 2011, about 6,000 Nuer Youths Army marched on the remote town of Pibor in Jonglei state, home to the rival Murle people, burning homes and looting facilities after overtaking a small South Sudan Army unit. The Lou-Nuer blame the Murle for cattle raiding and have vowed to wipe out the entire Murle Tribe on the face of the Earth. An estimated 3,000 people were killed, mainly children, women and the elderly. More than 1,000 people were killed in ethnic clashes within South Sudan in 2012, with Jonglei being one of the states worst affected by the violence. Thousands more civilians have been displaced from their homes. Along South Sudan's border with Ethiopia, a rebellion is smouldering among the Murle, with civilians caught in the conflict. Civilians alleging torture by the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) claim fingernails being torn out, burning plastic bags dripped on children to make their parents hand over weapons and the villages of Laor and the Tanyang people burned alive in their huts because rebels were suspected of spending the night in the village. On August 18, 2011, to retaliate and retrieve cattle stolen from previous conflict, several young Murle sacked and burned the air strip village of Pierri and a dozen surrounding hamlets, killing over a hundred people, abducting dozens or hundreds of children and stealing up to tens of thousands of cattle. One explanation might also be the drought: Pierri has one of the very few functioning dry season drinking water wells, often with thousands of people queuing for its water. Nuer have often excluded Murle from using this water. Because of the Dinka and Nuer domination in the South Sudan government and as well as in the State level, most problems are blamed on Murle; therefore it is difficult for journalists and researchers to check any claims against the Murle. Some conflicts could be prevented by sinking more wells. Also, a national conference on drinking water, land use rights and land redistribution, might help, if Murle survival needs and all their arguments are taken seriously. State intervention in bride wealth culture (moving it away from virtual slave trade to an exchange of intentions and nominal tokens) and strong state action against illegal taxation by local leaders in Nuer, Dinka and Murle society is also needed. Also, South Sudan, with its enormous agricultural potential during the rainy season, needs to be connected to regional and world markets, so that through agriculture and cattle breeding, the economy can be based on something else than tit for tat theft.

Although many dwellings belonging to all prehistoric periods and also some clay models of dwellings have been uncovered enabling the creation of faithful reconstructions, they seldom included elements that may relate them to art. Some exceptions are provided by wall decorations and by finds that equally apply to Neolithic and Chalcolithic rites and art. In South and Southwest Asia, Neolithic cultures appear soon after 10,000 BC, initially in the Levant (Pre-Pottery Neolithic A and Pre-Pottery Neolithic B) and from there spread eastwards and westwards. There are early Neolithic cultures in Southeast Anatolia, Syria and Iraq by 8000 BC, and food-producing societies first appear in southeast Europe by 7000 BC, and Central Europe by c. 5500 BC (of which the earliest cultural complexes include the Starƒçevo-Koros (Cris), Linearbandkeramic, and Vinƒça). Neolithic settlements and \\"cities\\" include: * G√∂bekli Tepe in Turkey, ca. 9,000 BC * Jericho in the Levant, Neolithic from around 8,350 BC, arising from the earlier Epipaleolithic Natufian culture * Nevali Cori in Turkey, ca. 8,000 BC * √áatalh√∂y√ºk in Turkey, 7,500 BC * Mehrgarh in Pakistan, 7,000 BC * Knap of Howar and Skara Brae, the Orkney Islands, Scotland, from 3,500 BC * over 3,000 settlements of the Cucuteni- Trypillian culture, some with populations up to 15,000 residents, flourished in present-day Romania, Moldova and Ukraine from 5,400‚Äì2,800 BC. The Neolithic people in the Levant, Anatolia, Syria, northern Mesopotamia and Central Asia were great builders, utilizing mud-brick to construct houses and villages. At √áatalh√∂y√ºk, houses were plastered and painted with elaborate scenes of humans and animals. The Mediterranean Neolithic cultures of Malta worshiped in megalithic temples. In Europe, long houses built from wattle and daub were constructed. Elaborate tombs for the dead were also built. These tombs are particularly numerous in Ireland, where there are many thousands still in existence. Neolithic people in the British Isles built long barrows and chamber tombs for their dead and causewayed camps, henges flint mines and cursus monuments.

The mound was no doubt to elevate the temple to a commanding position in what was otherwise a flat river valley. The great city of Uruk had a number of religious precincts, containing many temples larger and more ambitious than any buildings previously known. The word ziggurat is an anglicized form of the Akkadian word ziqqurratum, the name given to the solid stepped towers of mud brick. It derives from the verb zaqaru, (\\"to be high\\"). The buildings are described as being like mountains linking Earth and heaven. The Ziggurat of Ur, excavated by Leonard Woolley, is 64 by 46 meters at base and originally some 12 meters in height with three stories. It was built under Ur-Nammu (circa 2100 B.C.) and rebuilt under Nabonidus (555‚Äì539 B.C.), when it was increased in height to probably seven stories. Assyrian palaces had a large public court with a suite of apartments on the east side and a series of large banqueting halls on the south side. This was to become the traditional plan of Assyrian palaces, built and adorned for the glorification of the king. Massive amounts of ivory furniture pieces were found in some palaces.

Harvests for example were seen as the benevolence of fertility deities. Thus, the founding and ordering of the city and her most important buildings (the palace and temple) were often executed by priests or even the ruler himself and the construction was accompanied by rituals intended to enter human activity into continued divine benediction. Ancient architecture is characterized by this tension between the divine and mortal world. Cities would mark a contained sacred space over the wilderness of nature outside, and the temple or palace continued this order by acting as a house for the gods. The architect, be he priest or king, was not the sole important figure, he was merely part of a continuing tradition.

Minoan buildings often had flat, tiled roofs; plaster, wood or flagstone floors, and stood two to three stories high. Lower walls were typically constructed of stone and rubble, and the upper walls of mudbrick. Ceiling timbers held up the roofs. The main colors used in Minoan frescos were black (carbonaceous shale), white (hydrate of lime), red (hematite), yellow (ochre), blue (silicate of cooper) and green (yellow and blue mixed together). The most iconic Minoan building is the Palace of Knossos, being connected to the mythological story of The Bull of Minos, since it is in this palace where it was written that the labyrinth existed. The Lion Gate, built in circa 1250 BC, an iconic Mycenaean building A common characteristic of the Minoan architecture were flat roofs. The rooms of villas didn't have windows to the streets, the light arriving from courtyards. In the 2nd millennium BC, the villas had one or two floors, and the palaces even three. One of the most notable Minoan contributions to architecture is their inverted column, wider at the top than the base (unlike most Greek columns, which are wider at the bottom to give an impression of height). The columns were made of wood (not stone) and were generally painted red. Mounted on a simple stone base, they were topped with a pillow-like, round capital.Benton and DiYanni 1998, p. 67.Bourbon 1998, p 34 Aegean art reached its peak in circa 1650-1450 BC and was at first dominated by the Minoans. However, at the height of its influence, the Minoan civilization fell and its position was quickly inherited by the Mycenaeans, a race of warriors who flourished in Greece from 1600 to 1200 BC. Although Cretan artisans may have been employed on the reworking of Mycenaean citadels, the two styles remained distinct. Mycenaean buildings were carefully planned and focused on the megaron (central unit), while the Minoans favoured complex, labyrinthine forms. Mycenaean columns, like the Minoan examples, were slender and tapered sharply downwords. File:Minoan Room (35142219872).jpgQueen's Megaron from the Palace of Knossos, with the Dolphin fresco.

Civic life gained importance for all members of the community. In the time of the ancients religious matters were only handled by the ruling class; by the time of the Greeks, religious mystery had skipped the confines of the temple-palace compounds and was the subject of the people or polis. Ancient Greek architecture was fundamentally a representation of timber post and lintel, or \\"trabeated\\" construction in stone, and most surviving buildings are temples. Rows of tall columns supported a lintel, which in turn supported a pitched roof structure running the length of the building. The triangular gable formed at either end of the pitched roof was often heavily decorated and was a key feature of the style. Today we think of Classical and Hellenist Greek architecture as being characterized by the use of plain white marble, but originally it would have been brightly painted in gaudy colors. For example, Doric order capitals were painted with geometric and leaf patterns. Doric (left three), Ionic (middle three) and Corinthian (right two) columns Greek civic life was sustained by new, open spaces called the agora, which were surrounded by public buildings, stores and temples. The agora embodied the newfound respect for social justice received through open debate rather than imperial mandate. Though divine wisdom still presided over human affairs, the living rituals of ancient civilizations had become inscribed in space, in the paths that wound towards the acropolis for example. Each place had its own nature, set within a world refracted through myth, thus temples were sited atop mountains all the better to touch the heavens. Greek architecture was typically made of stone. Most surviving buildings are temples, based on strict rules of proportion. These temples typically included a peristyle (outer area with (typically Doric) columns), and three-sections in the middle, being 1. the pronaus (entrance), 2. the main cella or naos chamber (where a statue of the god or goddess and an altar was built), and 3. the opisthodomos behind the cella. The most iconic element of Hellenistic architecture is of course the column. The Doric order, sober and severe, was dominant in Peloponnese and Magna Graecia (Sicily and South Italy), being named the masculine order of Hellenistic architecture. Meanwhile, the Ionic order is graceful and more ornamented, being the feminine order. Because of Ionic's proportions, it is used especially for monumental buildings. The third of the Greek orders was also the last to be developed. The earliest documented examples of the use of the Corinthian order are (internally) at the Temple of Apollo Epicurius, Bassae (429-390 BC) and (externally) at the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates (335-334 BC). Corinthian was not, like the Doric and Ionic orders, a structural system. It was purely decorative, its effect due almost wholly to its elaborate floral capital. This, according to Vitruvius, was designed by the Athenian sculptor Callimachus, and may originally have been worked in bronze. Apart from this capital, all the constituent parts were borrowed from the Ionic order. Gradually, in Hellenistic times (after the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC), Corinthian did begin to develop, but it was left to the Romans to blend the elements together and make it perfect.

The Etruscans probably originated in Asia Minor and settled in west-central Italy (Etruria), between the rivers Arno and Tiber. From the late 7th century BC their power grew, and for a while Rome itself was ruled by Etruscan kings. But with the establishment of a republic in 509 BC, Etruscan civilization began to decline and its various city states were conquered. Nonetheless, the Etruscans did not cease their architectural activity, which retained its distinct character until the 1st century BC. Few buildings survived, but those that do are extremely fine, especially the tombs, which were located mainly in specific necropolis sites. The Etruscans, as we know from the writings of Vitruvius, a Roman architect and engineer of the 1st century BC, developed a style of temple building which, though inspired by Greek and Oriental examples, was quite distinctive in its own right. It conformed to specific rules, referred to as tuscanicae dispositiones by Vitruvius. Temples were usually of mud-brick and timber, though stone was used later, and seem to have been built to face south. They were placed at the centre of towns and fronted on to squares, in which altars were placed. Temples were lavishly decorated with painted terracotta, which served partly to protect the wooden elements of the structure. For example, the sides of the roof bore ante-fixae (slabs used to close the end of a row of tiles), and there were statues over the pediment and within the pronaos. Many of the temples were divided into three cellas (sanctuaries), the central one being the most important and sometimes the largest.

Fannius Synistor at Boscoreale (Italy), circa 50-40 BC, fresco, dimensions of the room: 265.4 x 334 x 583.9 cm, in the Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York City) The Romans conquered the Greek cities in Italy around three hundred years BCE and much of the Western world after that. The Roman problem of rulership involved the unity of disparity ‚Äì from Spanish to Greek, Macedonian to Carthaginian ‚Äì Roman rule had extended itself across the breadth of the known world and the myriad pacified cultures forming this ecumene presented a new challenge for justice. Roman architecture, especially Roman temple architecture, shared many basic characteristics with Greek temple architecture, including the prominent portico, use of the Classical orders (mainly Corinthian and Composite), and the stepped podium. However, it tended to be more ornate and elaborate overall. The Corinthian order was the most widely used order in Roman architecture. It differed from the Greek Corinthian in its more ornate entablature and capital, but more particularly in the introduction of modillions (horizontal consoles that supported a deeper cornice). Sometimes coffering was introduced between these to create a greater impression from the ground. Early Roman Corinthian capitals tended to be squatter than later examples, with fleshier acanthus leaves and larger flowers on the abacus. One way to look at the unity of Roman architecture is through a new-found realization of theory derived from practice, and embodied spatially. Civically, we find this happening in the Roman forum (sibling of the Greek agora), where public participation is increasingly removed from the concrete performance of rituals and represented in the decor of the architecture. Thus, we finally see the beginnings of the contemporary public square in the Forum Iulium, begun by Julius Caesar, where the buildings present themselves through their facades as representations within the space. As the Romans chose representations of sanctity over actual sacred spaces to participate in society, the communicative nature of space was opened to human manipulation. None of which would have been possible without the advances of Roman engineering and construction or the newly found marble quarries, which were the spoils of war; inventions like the arch and concrete gave a whole new form to Roman architecture, fluidly enclosing space in taut domes and colonnades, clothing the grounds for imperial rulership and civic order. This was also a response to the changing social climate which demanded new buildings of increasing complexity: the Colosseum, the residential block, bigger hospitals and academies. General civil construction such as roads and bridges began to be built. The Romans widely employed, and further developed, the arch, vault and dome, all of which were little used before, particularly in Europe.The Romans were the first builders in Europe, perhaps the first in the world, fully to appreciate the advantages of the arch, the vault and the dome.(Robertson, D.S.: Greek and Roman Architecture, 2nd edn., Cambridge 1943, p.231) Their innovative use of Roman concrete facilitated the building of the many public buildings of often unprecedented size throughout the Roman empire. These include temples, thermae, bridges, aqueducts, harbours, triumphal arches, amphitheatres, circuses palaces, mausolea and in the late empire also churches. Two widely used motifs were the bucranium (ox skulls) and the festoon (a wreath or hanging from two points). Roman domes permitted construction of vaulted ceilings and enabled huge covered public spaces such as the public baths like Baths of Diocletian or the monumental Pantheon in the city of Rome. Art historians such as Gottfried Richter in the 1920s identified the Roman architectural innovation as being the triumphal arch and it is poignant to see how this symbol of power on earth was transformed and utilized within the Christian basilicas when the Roman Empire of the West was on its last legs: The arch was set before the altar to symbolize the triumph of Christ and the after life. It is in their impressive aqueducts that we see the arch triumphant, especially in the many surviving examples, such as the Pont du Gard, the Aqueduct of Segovia, and the remains of the Aqueducts of Rome itself. Their survival is testimony to the durability of their materials and design.

The Islamic architecture of Iran in turn, draws ideas from its pre-Islamic predecessor, and has geometrical and repetitive forms, as well as surfaces that are richly decorated with glazed tiles, carved stucco, patterned brickwork, floral motifs, and calligraphy. Iran is recognized by UNESCO as being one of the cradles of civilization. Each of the periods of Elamites, Achaemenids, Parthians, and Sassanids were creators of great architecture that over the ages has spread wide and far to other cultures being adopted. Although Iran has suffered its share of destruction, including Alexander The Great's decision to burn Persepolis, there are sufficient remains to form a picture of its classical architecture. The Achaemenids built on a grand scale. The artists and materials they used were brought in from practically all territories of what was then the largest state in the world. Pasargadae set the standard: its city was laid out in an extensive park with bridges, gardens, colonnaded palaces and open column pavilions. Pasargadae along with Susa and Persepolis expressed the authority of The King of Kings, the staircases of the latter recording in relief sculpture the vast extent of the imperial frontier. With the emergence of the Parthians and Sassanids there was an appearance of new forms. Parthian innovations fully flowered during the Sassanid period with massive barrel- vaulted chambers, solid masonry domes, and tall columns. This influence was to remain for years to come. The roundness of the city of Baghdad in the Abbasid era for example, points to its Persian precedents such as Firouzabad in Fars.Islam Art and Architecture. Markus Hattstein, Peter Delius. 2000. p96.

Both the religious and secular designs have influenced the design and construction of buildings and structures within and outside the sphere of Islamic culture. Islamic architecture is typically based on the idea of relating to the secular or the religious. Some distinctive structures in Islamic architecture are mosques, tombs, palaces, baths, and forts, although Islamic architects have of course also applied their distinctive design precepts to domestic architecture. The wide and long history of Islam has given rise to many local architectural styles, including Abbasid, Persian, Moorish, Timurid, Ottoman, Fatimid, Mamluk, Mughal, Indo- Islamic, Sino-Islamic and Afro-Islamic architecture. Notable Islamic architectural types include the early Abbasid buildings, T-type mosques, and the central-dome mosques of Anatolia. Islam does not encourage the worship of idols; therefore the architecture tends to be decorated with Arabic calligraphy from the Quran rather than illustrations of scenes from it.

Styles incorporated more wood and rounder structures in domestic architecture in the center of the country and the south, and these stylistic influences were manifested in the construction of churches and monasteries. Throughout the medieval period, Aksumite architecture and influences and its monolithic tradition persisted, with its influence strongest in the early medieval (Late Aksumite) and Zagwe periods (when the rock-cut monolithic churches of Lalibela were carved). Throughout the medieval period, and especially from the 10th to 12th centuries, churches were hewn out of rock throughout Ethiopia, especially during the northernmost region of Tigray, which was the heart of the Aksumite Empire. However, rock-hewn churches have been found as far south as Adadi Maryam (15th century), about 100 km south of Addis Abeba. The most famous example of Ethiopian rock-hewn architecture are the eleven monolithic churches of Lalibela, carved out of the red volcanic tuff found around the town. Though later medieval hagiographies attribute all eleven structures to the eponymous King Lalibela (the town was called Roha and Adefa before his reign), new evidence indicates that they may have been built separately over a period of a few centuries, with only a few of the more recent churches having been built under his reign. Archaeologist and Ethiopisant David Phillipson postulates, for instance, that Bete Gebriel-Rufa'el was actually built in the very early medieval period, some time between 600 and 800 A.D., originally as a fortress but was later turned into a church.David Keys: Medieval Houses of God, or Ancient Fortresses? During the early modern period, the absorption of new diverse influences such as Baroque, Arab, Turkish and Gujarati Indian style began with the arrival of Portuguese Jesuit missionaries in the 16th and 17th centuries. Portuguese soldiers had initially come in the mid-16th century as allies to aid Ethiopia in its fight against Adal, and later Jesuits came hoping to convert the country. Some Turkish influence may have entered the country during the late 16th century during its war with the Ottoman Empire (see Habesh), which resulted in an increased building of fortresses and castles. Ethiopia, naturally easily defensible because of its numerous ambas or flat-topped mountains and rugged terrain, yielded little tactical use from the structures in contrast to their advantages in the flat terrain of Europe and other areas, and so had until this point little developed the tradition. Castles were built especially beginning with the reign of Sarsa Dengel around the Lake Tana region, and subsequent Emperors maintained the tradition, eventually resulting in the creation of the Fasil Ghebbi (royal enclosure of castles) in the newly founded capital (1635), Gondar. Emperor Susenyos (r.1606-1632) converted to Catholicism in 1622 and attempted to make it the state religion, declaring it as such from 1624 until his abdication; during this time, he employed Arab, Gujarati (brought by the Jesuits), and Jesuit masons and their styles, as well as local masons, some of whom were Beta Israel. With the reign of his son Fasilides, most of these foreigners were expelled, although some of their architectural styles were absorbed into the prevailing Ethiopian architectural style. This style of the Gondarine dynasty would persist throughout the 17th and 18th centuries especially and also influenced modern 19th-century and later styles. The conical tower inside the Great Enclosure in Great Zimbabwe, a medieval city built by a prosperous culture. Great Zimbabwe is the largest medieval city in sub-Saharan Africa. By the late nineteenth century, most buildings reflected the fashionable European eclecticism and pastisched Mediterranean, or even Northern European, styles. In the Western Sahel region, Islamic influence was a major contributing factor to architectural development from the later ages of the Kingdom of Ghana. At Kumbi Saleh, locals lived in domed-shaped dwellings in the king's section of the city, surrounded by a great enclosure. Traders lived in stone houses in a section which possessed 12 beautiful mosques, as described by al-bakri, with one centered on Friday prayer.Historical Society of Ghana. Transactions of the Historical Society of Ghana, The Society, 1957, pp81 The king is said to have owned several mansions, one of which was sixty-six feet long, forty-two feet wide, contained seven rooms, was two stories high, and had a staircase; with the walls and chambers filled with sculpture and painting.Davidson, Basil. The Lost Cities of Africa. Boston: Little Brown, 1959, pp86 Sahelian architecture initially grew from the two cities of Djenn√© and Timbuktu. The Sankore Mosque in Timbuktu, constructed from mud on timber, was similar in style to the Great Mosque of Djenn√©. The rise of kingdoms in the West African coastal region produced architecture which drew on indigenous traditions, utilizing wood. The famed Benin City, destroyed by the Punitive Expedition, was a large complex of homes in coursed clay, with hipped roofs of shingles or palm leaves. The Palace had a sequence of ceremonial rooms, and was decorated with brass plaques. A common type of houses in Sub-Saharian Africa were the beehive houses, made from a circle of stones topped with a domed roof. The ancient Bantu used this type of house, which was made with mud, poles, and cow dung.

The result is an evolving range of architectural production that, although it is difficult to identify a single representative style, nonetheless retains a certain amount of continuity across history. The diversity of Indian culture is represented in its architecture. It is a blend of ancient and varied native traditions, with building types, forms and technologies from West and Central Asia, as well as Europe. Architectural styles range from Hindu temple architecture to Islamic architecture to western classical architecture to modern and post-modern architecture. India's Urban Civilization is traceable originally to Mohenjodaro and Harappa, now in Pakistan. From then on, Indian architecture and civil engineering continued to develop, manifesting in temples, palaces and forts across the Indian subcontinent and neighbouring regions. Architecture and civil engineering was known as sthapatya-kala, literally \\"the art of constructing\\". The Hall of Private Audience at Fatehpur Sikri in Uttar Pradesh (India), an early example of the architecture of the Mughal Empire Indian rock-cut architecture provides the earliest complete survivals of Buddhist, Jain and Hindu temples. The temples of Aihole and Pattadakal are well-known early examples of Hindu temple architecture, when the temple was taking on its final form. This was more or less set out in the Sulbasutras, appendices to the Vedas giving rules for constructing altars, with detailed geometrical and ritual requirements. \\"They contained quite an amount of geometrical knowledge, but the mathematics was being developed, not for its own sake, but purely for practical religious purposes.\\"O'Connor, J. J. and E. F. Robertson, Overview of Indian Mathematics, School of Mathematics, University of St Andrew, Scotland. Nonetheless, there is great variety in the details and decoration of regional and period styles, for example in Hoysala architecture, Vijayanagara architecture and Western Chalukya architecture. During the Mauryan Empire and Kushan Empire, Indian architecture and civil engineering reached regions like Baluchistan and Afghanistan. Statues of Buddha were cut out, covering entire mountain cliffs, like in Buddhas of Bamyan, Afghanistan. Over a period of time, the ancient Indian art of construction blended with Greek styles and spread to Central Asia. The rule of the Delhi Sultanate, Deccan Sultanates and Mughal Empire led to the development of Indo-Islamic architecture, a style that combined Islamic influences with traditional Indian styles. During the British Raj, a new style of architecture known as the Indo-Saracenic revival style developed, which incorporated varying degrees of Indian elements into the British style. The Churches and convents of Goa which is cast in the Indian Baroque Architectural style under the orientation of the most eminent architects of the time. It is a prime example of the blending of traditional Indian styles with western European architectural styles.

Three types of structures are associated with the religious architecture of early Buddhism: monasteries (vihƒÅras), places to venerate relics (stupas), and shrines or prayer halls (chaityas, also called chaitya grihas), which later came to be called temples in some places. The initial function of a stupa was the veneration and safe-guarding of the relics of Gautama Buddha. The earliest surviving example of a stupa is in Sanchi (Madhya Pradesh). When Buddhism came to China, Buddhist architecture came along with it. There were many monasteries built, equalling about 45,000. These monasteries were filled with examples of Buddhist architecture, and because of this, they hold a very prominent place in Chinese architecture. One of the earliest surviving examples is the brick pagoda at the Songyue Monastery in Dengfeng County.

They were usually surrounded by enclosures to protect them from evil powers but confusion has often arisen as to which is a temple enclosure and which is that of the town of which the temple was a part. \\"Ancient Angkor guide book\\", by Michael Freeman and Claude Jacques, published in 2003. Angkor Wat temple is a great example of Khmer architectural masterpiece, was built by king Suryavarman II in the 12th century.

The geographic position of Indonesia means a transition between the culture of Asian Hindu-Buddhism architecture and animistic architecture of Oceania. Indonesian wide range of vernacular styles is the legacy of an Austronesian architectural tradition characterized by wooden pile dwellings, high pitched roofs and extended roof ridges. The temples of Java, on the other hand, share an Indian Hindu-Buddhist ancestry, typical of Southeast Asia; though indigenous influences have led to the creation of a distinctly Indonesian style of monumental architecture. Gradual spread of Islam through the region from the 12th century onwards creates an Islamic architecture which betray a mixture of local and exotic elements. Arrival of the European merchant, especially the Dutch, shows incorporation of many Indonesian features into the architecture of the native Netherlands to produce an eclectic synthesis of Eastern and Western forms apparent in the early 18th-century Indies Style and modern New Indies Style. The years that followed independence saw the adoption of Modernist agenda on the part of Indonesian architects apparent in the architecture of the 1970s and 1980s.

Art and architecture have often been closely connected‚Äîfor example, storehouses and meetinghouses are often decorated with elaborate carvings‚Äîand so they are presented together in this discussion. The architecture of the Pacific Islands was varied and sometimes large in scale. Buildings reflected the structure and preoccupations of the societies that constructed them, with considerable symbolic detail. Technically, most buildings in Oceania were no more than simple assemblages of poles held together with cane lashings; only in the Caroline Islands were complex methods of joining and pegging known. An important Oceanic archaeological site is Nan Madol from the Federated States of Micronesia. Nan Madol was the ceremonial and political seat of the Saudeleur Dynasty, which united Pohnpei's estimated 25,000 people until about 1628.Nan Madol, Madolenihmw, Pohnpei William Ayres, Department of Anthropology University Of Oregon, Accessed 26 September 2007 Set apart between the main island of Pohnpei and Temwen Island, it was a scene of human activity as early as the first or second century AD.

Especially Japan, Korea, Vietnam and Ryukyu. The structural principles of Chinese architecture have remained largely unchanged, the main changes being only the decorative details. Since the Tang Dynasty, Chinese architecture has had a major influence on the architectural styles of Korea, Vietnam, and Japan. From the Neolithic era Longshan Culture and Bronze Age era Erlitou culture, the earliest rammed earth fortifications exist, with evidence of timber architecture. The subterranean ruins of the palace at Yinxu dates back to the Shang Dynasty (c. 1600 BC-1046 BC). In historic China, architectural emphasis was laid upon the horizontal axis, in particular the construction of a heavy platform and a large roof that floats over this base, with the vertical walls not as well emphasized. This contrasts Western architecture, which tends to grow in height and depth. Chinese architecture stresses the visual impact of the width of the buildings. The deviation from this standard is the tower architecture of the Chinese tradition, which began as a native tradition and was eventually influenced by the Buddhist building for housing religious sutras ‚Äî the stupa ‚Äî which came from Nepal. Ancient Chinese tomb model representations of multiple story residential towers and watchtowers date to the Han Dynasty (202 BC-220 AD). However, the earliest extant Buddhist Chinese pagoda is the Songyue Pagoda, a 40 m (131 ft) tall circular-based brick tower built in Henan province in the year 523 AD. From the 6th century onwards, stone-based structures become more common, while the earliest are from stone and brick arches found in Han Dynasty tombs. The Zhaozhou Bridge built from 595 to 605 AD is China's oldest extant stone bridge, as well as the world's oldest fully stone open-spandrel segmental arch bridge. Inside the Forbidden City, an example of Chinese architecture from the 15th century The vocational trade of architect, craftsman, and engineer was not as highly respected in premodern Chinese society as the scholar-bureaucrats who were drafted into the government by the civil service examination system. Much of the knowledge about early Chinese architecture was passed on from one tradesman to his son or associative apprentice. However, there were several early treatises on architecture in China, with encyclopedic information on architecture dating back to the Han Dynasty. The height of the classical Chinese architectural tradition in writing and illustration can be found in the Yingzao Fashi, a building manual written by 1100 and published by Li Jie (1065-1110) in 1103. In it there are numerous and meticulous illustrations and diagrams showing the assembly of halls and building components, as well as classifying structure types and building components. There were certain architectural features that were reserved solely for buildings built for the Emperor of China. One example is the use of yellow roof tiles; yellow having been the Imperial color, yellow roof tiles still adorn most of the buildings within the Forbidden City. The Temple of Heaven, however, uses blue roof tiles to symbolize the sky. The roofs are almost invariably supported by brackets, a feature shared only with the largest of religious buildings. The wooden columns of the buildings, as well as the surface of the walls, tend to be red in colour. Many current Chinese architectural designs follow post-modern and western styles.

From a technical point of view, buildings are structured vertically and horizontally. A construction usually rises from a stone subfoundation to a curved roof covered with tiles, held by a console structure and supported on posts; walls are made of earth (adobe) or are sometimes totally composed of movable wooden doors. Architecture is built according to the unit, the distance between two posts (about 3.7 meters), and is designed so that there is always a transitional space between the \\"inside\\" and the \\"outside.\\" The console, or bracket structure, is a specific architectonic element that has been designed in various ways through time. If the simple bracket system was already in use under the Goguryeo kingdom (37 BCE‚Äì668 CE)‚Äîin palaces in Pyongyang, for instance‚Äîa curved version, with brackets placed only on the column heads of the building, was elaborated during the early Koryo dynasty (918‚Äì1392). The Amita Hall of the Pusok temple in Antong is a good example. Later on (from the mid-Koryo period to the early Choson dynasty), a multiple- bracket system, or an inter-columnar-bracket set system, was developed under the influence of Mongol's Yuan dynasty (1279‚Äì1368). In this system, the consoles were also placed on the transverse horizontal beams. Seoul's Namtaemun Gate Namdaemun, Korea's foremost national treasure, is perhaps the most symbolic example of this type of structure. In the mid-Choson period, the winglike bracket form appeared (one example is the Yongnyongjon Hall of Jongmyo, Seoul), which is interpreted by many scholars as an example of heavy Confucian influence in Joseon Korea, which emphasized simplicity and modesty in such shrine buildings. Only in buildings of importance like palaces or sometimes temples (Tongdosa, for instance) were the multicluster brackets still used. Confucianism also led to more sober and simple solutions.

It also shows a number of important differences and aspects which are uniquely Japanese. Two new forms of architecture were developed in medieval Japan in response to the militaristic climate of the times: the castle, a defensive structure built to house a feudal lord and his soldiers in times of trouble; and the shoin, a reception hall and private study area designed to reflect the relationships of lord and vassal within a feudal society. Because of the need to rebuild Japan after World War II, major Japanese cities contain numerous examples of modern architecture. Japan played some role in modern skyscraper design, because of its long familiarity with the cantilever principle to support the weight of heavy tiled temple roofs. New city planning ideas based on the principle of layering or cocooning around an inner space (oku), a Japanese spatial concept that was adapted to urban needs, were adapted during reconstruction.

The distinctive features of Mesoamerican architecture encompass a number of different regional and historical styles, which however are significantly interrelated. These styles developed throughout the different phases of Mesoamerican history as a result of the intensive cultural exchange between the different cultures of the Mesoamerican culture area through thousands of years. Mesoamerican architecture is mostly noted for its pyramids which are the largest such structures outside of Ancient Egypt. The Mezcala culture (700‚Äì200 BC) is known for its temple shaped sculptures, usually with an anthropomorphic person in the middle.

The Incas developed an extensive road system spanning most of the western length of the continent. Inca rope bridges could be considered the world's first suspension bridges. Because the Incas used no wheels (It would have been impractical for the terrain) or horses, they built their roads and bridges for foot and pack-llama traffic. Much of present-day architecture at the former Inca capital Cuzco shows both Incan and Spanish influences. The famous lost city Machu Picchu is the best surviving example of Incan architecture. Another significant site is Ollantaytambo. The Inca were sophisticated stone cutters whose masonry used no mortar.

Impermanent buildings, which were often architecturally unique from region to region, continue to influence American architecture today. In his summary, \\"The World of Textiles\\", North Carolina State's Tushar Ghosh provides one example: the Denver International Airport's roof is a fabric structure that was influenced by and/or resembles the tipis of local cultures. In writing about Evergreen State College, Lloyd Vaughn lists an example of very different native architecture that also influenced contemporary building: the Native American Studies program is housed in a modern-day longhouse derived from pre-Columbian Pacific Northwest architecture.

Castles and fortified walls provide the most notable remaining non-religious examples of medieval architecture. Windows gained a cross-shape for more than decorative purposes: they provided a perfect fit for a crossbowman to safely shoot at invaders from inside. Crenellation walls (battlements) provided shelters for archers on the roofs to hide behind when not shooting. Byzantine The Byzantine Empire gradually emerged as a distinct artistic and cultural entity from the Roman Empire after AD 330, when the Roman Emperor Constantine the Great moved the capital of the Roman Empire east from Rome to Byzantium (later renamed Constantinople and now called Istanbul). The empire endured for more than a millennium, dramatically influencing Medieval and Renaissance-era architecture in Europe and, following the capture of Constantinople by the Ottoman Turks in 1453, leading directly to the architecture of the Ottoman Empire. Early Byzantine architecture was built as a continuation of Roman architecture. Stylistic drift, technological advancement, and political and territorial changes meant that a distinct style gradually emerged, which imbued certain influences from the Near East and used the Greek cross plan in church architecture. Buildings increased in geometric complexity, brick and plaster were used in addition to stone in the decoration of important public structures, classical orders were used more freely, mosaics replaced carved decoration, complex domes rested upon massive piers, and windows filtered light through thin sheets of alabaster to softly illuminate interiors. This Byzantine style, with increasingly exotic domes and ever-richer mosaics, traveled west to Ravenna and Venice and as far north as Moscow. Most of the churches and basilicas have high-riding domes. As result, they created vast open spaces at the centres of churches, heightening the sense of grace and light. The round arch is a fundamental of Byzantine style. Magnificent golden mosaics with their graphic simplicity and immense power brought light and warmth into the heart of churches. Byzantine capitals break away from the Classical conventions of ancient Greece and Rome. Sinuous lines and naturalistic forms are precursors to the Gothic style. According to descriptions, interiors were plated with marble or stone. Some of the columns were also made of marble. Other widely used materials were bricks and stone, not just marble like in Classical antiquity. Mural paintings or mosaics made of shiny little stones were also elements of interior architecture. Precious wood furniture like beds, chairs, stools, tables, bookshelves and silver or golden cups with beautiful reliefs, decorated Byzantine interiors.

While these terms are problematic, they nonetheless serve adequately as entries into the era. Considerations that enter into histories of each period include Trachtenberg's \\"historicising\\" and \\"modernising\\" elements, Italian versus northern, Spanish, and Byzantine elements, and especially the religious and political maneuverings between kings, popes, and various ecclesiastic officials. Romanesque, prevalent in medieval Europe during the 11th and 12th centuries, was the first pan-European style since Roman Imperial architecture and examples are found in every part of the continent. The term was not contemporary with the art it describes, but rather, is an invention of modern scholarship based on its similarity to Roman architecture in forms and materials. Romanesque is characterized by a use of round or slightly pointed arches, barrel vaults, and cruciform piers supporting vaults.

Verticality is emphasized in Gothic architecture, which features almost skeletal stone structures with great expanses of glass, pared-down wall surfaces supported by external flying buttresses, pointed arches using the ogive shape, ribbed vaults, clustered columns, pinnacles and sharply pointed spires and spirelets. Windows contain beautiful stained glass, showing stories from the Bible and from lives of saints. Such advances in design allowed cathedrals to rise taller than ever, and it became something of an inter- regional contest to build a church as high as possible.

It has experienced from time to time westernising movements that culminated in the comprehensive reforms of Peter the Great (around 1700). From prehistoric times the material of vernacular Russian architecture was wood. Byzantine churches and the architecture of Kievan Rus were characterized by broader, flatter domes without a special framework erected above the drum. In contrast to this ancient form, each drum of a Russian church is surmounted by a special structure of metal or timber, which is lined with sheet iron or tiles. Some characteristics taken from the Slavic pagan temples are the exterior galleries and the plurality of towers. The Saint Basil's Cathedral is one of Russia's most distinctive sights. Built by Tsar Ivan IV (also known as Ivan the Terrible) to commemorate his defeat of the Mongols at the battle Kazan in 1552, it stands just outside the Kremlin in the Red Square, in the heart of Moscow. Its extraordinary onion-shaped domes, painted in bright colours, create a memorable skyline, making St. Basil's Cathedral a symbol both of Moscow and Russia as a whole. Each of the domes has its own dazzling form of decoration, ranging from prisms and spirals to chevrons and stripes, all emphasised with brilliant colours. Their colours are unusual, most of the Russian domes being either plain or gilded. Originally, the dome at St. Basil's Cathedral had a gold finish, with some blue and green ceramic decoration. The bright, painted colours were added at various times from the 17th to the 19th century.

This period of cultural rebirth is often credited with the restoration of scholarship in the Classical antiquities and the absorption of new scientific and philosophical knowledge that fed the arts. The Ch√¢teau de Chantilly from Chantilly (France), built around 1560 The development from Medieval architecture concerned the way geometry mediated between the intangibility of light and the tangibility of the material as a way of relating divine creation to mortal existence. This relationship was changed in some measure by the invention of perspective, which brought a sense of infinity into the realm of human comprehension through the new representations of the horizon, evidenced in the expanses of space opened up in Renaissance art, and helped shape new humanist thought. Perspective represented a new understanding of space as a universal, a priori fact, understood and controllable through human reason. Renaissance buildings therefore show a different sense of conceptual clarity, where spaces were designed to be understood in their entirety from a specific fixed viewpoint. The power of perspective to universally represent reality was not limited to describing experiences, but also allowed it to anticipate experience itself by projecting the image back into reality. The Renaissance spread to France in the late 15th century, when Charles VIII returned in 1496 with several Italian artists from his conquest of Naples. Renaissance chateaux were built in the Loire Valley, the earliest example being the Ch√¢teau d'Amboise, and the style became dominant under Francis I (1515‚Äì47). (See Ch√¢teaux of the Loire Valley). The Ch√¢teau de Chambord is a combination of Gothic structure and Italianate ornament, a style which progressed under architects such as Sebastiano Serlio, who was engaged after 1540 in work at the Ch√¢teau de Fontainebleau. Architects such as Philibert Delorme, Androuet du Cerceau, Giacomo Vignola, and Pierre Lescot, were inspired by the new ideas. The southwest interior facade of the Cour Carr√©e of the Louvre in Paris was designed by Lescot and covered with exterior carvings by Jean Goujon. Architecture continued to thrive in the reigns of Henry II and Henry III. In England, the first great exponent of Renaissance architecture was Inigo Jones (1573‚Äì1652), who had studied architecture in Italy where the influence of Andrea Palladio was very strong. Jones returned to England full of enthusiasm for the new movement and immediately began to design such buildings as the Queen's House at Greenwich in 1616 and the Banqueting House at Whitehall three years later. These works with their clean lines and symmetry, were revolutionary in a country still enamoured with mullion windows, crenellations and turrets.

Dominating more than two centuries of art and architecture in Europe, Latin America and beyond from circa 1580 to circa 1800, they were the first to focus so intensely on their impact on the viewer, and they owed much of their popularity and global scope to this visual allure. Born in the painting studios of Bologna and Rome in the 1580s and 1590s, and in Roman sculptural and architectural ateliers in the second and third decades of the 17th century, the Baroque spread swiftly throughout Italy, Spain and Portugal, Flanders, France, the Netherlands, England, Scandinavia, and Russia, as well as to central and eastern European centres from Munich (Germany) to Vilnius (Lithuania). Baroque architecture originated in 17th century Rome, where it developed as an expression on the newly triumphant Catholic Church. The Counter-Reformation stated that architecture, painting and sculpture would play an important role in transforming Rome into a truly Catholic city. The streets radiating from St. Peters Cathedral were soon dotted with reminders of the victorious faith. Breaking with the somewhat static intellectual formulas of the Renaissance, Baroque architecture was first and foremost an art of persuasion. The periods of Mannerism and the Baroque that followed it signalled an increasing anxiety over meaning and representation. Important developments in science and philosophy had separated mathematical representations of reality from the rest of culture, fundamentally changing the way humans related to their world through architecture. It would reach its most extreme and embellished development under the decorative tastes of Rococo. Baroque architects took the basic elements of Renaissance architecture, including domes and colonnades, and made them higher, grander, more decorated, and more dramatic. The interior effects were often achieved with the use of quadratura, or trompe-l'oeil painting combined with sculpture: the eye is drawn upward, giving the illusion that one is looking into the heavens. Clusters of sculpted angels and painted figures crowd the ceiling. Light was also used for dramatic effect; it streamed down from cupolas and was reflected from an abundance of gilding. Solomonic columns were often used, to give an illusion of upwards motion and other decorative elements occupied every available space. In Baroque palaces, grand stairways became a central element.Ducher (1988), Flammarion, pg. 102 A characteristically Baroque form of ornamentation, the cartouche is an oval panel with crested or scrolled borders, used on palace, house and church fa√ßades as a framing device for a monogram (of the owner, the architect or the person to whom it is dedicated), cresting or coat of arms, but also as a purely decorative infill motif. It usually features inside a broken pediment, over an entrance or in the axis from the one to the other.

Although the style originated in the rich decoration at the Palace of Versailles, it was also a reaction to the formality of the royal palace. Juste-Aur√®le Meissonnier, Gilles-Marie Oppenordt, Nicolas Pineau and Germain Boffrand were among the designers who succeeded in reflecting the more intimate scale and comfortable arrangement of rooms by decorating them with light, frivolous and colourful schemes in which panels and door-frames dissolved and walls merged with the ceiling. The repertoire of motifs, including Rocaille arabesques and chinoiseries, was infinitely varied. Characteristic of the style were Rocaille motifs derived from the shells, icicles and rockwork or grotto decoration. Rocaille arabesques were mostly abstract forms, laid out symmetrically over and around architectural frames. A favourite motif was the scallop shell, whose top scrolls echoed the basic S and C framework scrolls of the arabesques and whose sinuous ridges echoed the general curvilinearity of the room decoration. While few Rococo exteriors were built in France, a number of Rococo churches are found in southern Germany. Other widely-user motifs in decorative arts and interior architecture include: asymmetrical shells, acanthus and other leaves, birds, bouquets of flowers, fruits, angels and Far Eastern elements. Rococo features exuberant decoration, with an abundance of curves, counter-curves, undulations and elements modeled on nature. The exteriors of Rococo buildings are often simple, while the interiors are entirely dominated by their ornament. The style was highly theatrical, designed to impress and awe at first sight. Floor plans of churches were often complex, featuring interlocking ovals; In palaces, grand stairways became centrepieces, and offered different points of view of the decoration. The style often integrated painting, molded stucco and wood carving, and quadratura, or illusionist ceiling paintings, which were designed to give the impression that those entering the room were looking up at the sky, where putti and other figures were gazing down at them. Materials used included stucco, either painted or left white; combinations of different colored woods; lacquered wood in the Japanese style, and ornament of gilded bronze. The intent was to create an impression of surprise, awe and wonder on first view. Rococo was also influenced by chinoiserie and was sometimes in association with Chinese figures and pagodas.Riley, No√´l. \\"The Age of Rococo.\\" World Furniture.

This Palladian architecture and continued classical imagery would in turn go on to influence Thomas Jefferson and other early architects of the United States in their search for a new national architecture. By the mid-18th century, there tended to be more restrained decoration and usage of authentic classical forms than in the Baroque, informed by increased visitation to classical ruins as part of the Grand Tour, coupled with the excavations of Pompeii and Herculaneum. The shift to Neoclassical architecture is conventionally dated to the 1750s. It first gained influence in England and France; in England, Sir William Hamilton's excavations at Pompeii and other sites, the influence of the Grand Tour and the work of William Chambers and Robert Adam, was pivotal in this regard. In France, the movement was propelled by a generation of French art students trained in Rome, and was influenced by the writings of Johann Joachim Winckelmann. The style was also adopted by progressive circles in other countries such as Sweden and Russia. Federal-style architecture is the name for the classicizing architecture built in North America between c. 1780 and 1830, and particularly from 1785 to 1815. This style shares its name with its era, the Federal Period. The term is also used in association with furniture design in the United States of the same time period. The style broadly corresponds to the middle-class classicism of Biedermeier style in the German- speaking lands, Regency style in Britain and to the French Empire style. In Central and Eastern Europe, the style is usually referred to as Classicism (, ), while the newer Revival styles of the 19th century until today are called neoclassical.

Berindey and built in the French Neoclassic between 1906 and 1914 =Revivalism and Orientalism= The 19th century was dominated by a wide variety of stylistic revivals, variations, and interpretations. Revivalism in architecture is the use of visual styles that consciously echo the style of a previous architectural era. Modern-day Revival styles can be summarized within New Classical architecture, and sometimes under the umbrella term traditional architecture. In art and architecture history, the term Orientalism refers to the works of the Western artists who specialized in Oriental subjects, produced from their travels in Western Asia, during the 19th century. In that time, artists and scholars were described as Orientalists, especially in France. Some of the most popular revivalist styles are neo-Byzantine (mainly in Orthodox countries like Romania, Russia or Serbia), neo-Gothic, neo-Baroque (mainly for administrative buildings, palaces and mansions) and neo- Renaissance.

The Beaux-Arts style is above all the cumulative product of two and a half centuries of instruction under the authority, first of the Acad√©mie royale d'architecture, then, following the Revolution, of the Architecture section of the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts. The organization under the Ancien R√©gime of the competition for the Grand Prix de Rome in architecture, offering a chance to study in Rome, imprinted its codes and aesthetic on the course of instruction, which culminated during the Second Empire (1850‚Äì1870) and the Third Republic that followed. The style of instruction that produced Beaux-Arts architecture continued without a major renovation until 1968.Robin Middleton, Editor. The Beaux-Arts and Nineteenth- century French Architecture.

Colonists frequently built settlements that synthesized the architecture of their countries of origin with the design characteristics of their new lands, creating hybrid designs. Countries born out of colonialism hold these houses in a national status.

The work of Victor Horta and Henry van de Velde in Brussels, Antoni Gaud√≠ in Barcelona, Otto Wagner in Vienna and Charles Rennie Mackintosh in Glasgow, among many others, can be seen as a common struggle between old and new. Art Nouveau architecture was a reaction against the eclectic styles that dominated European architecture in the second half of the 19th century. It was expressed through decoration: either ornamental (based on flowers and plants, e.g. thistles,Thistle ‚Äì Art Nouveau World irises,Iris ‚Äì Art Nouveau World cyclamens, orchids, water lilies, etc.) or sculptural (see the respective section below). While faces of people (or mascarons) are referred to ornament, the use of people in different forms of sculpture (statues and reliefs: see the respective section below) were also typical for Art Nouveau. Before Vienna Secession, Jugendstil and National romantic style fa√ßades were asymmetrical, and often decorated with polychrome ceramic tiles. The decoration usually suggested movement; there was no distinction between the structure and the ornament.Renault and Laz√©, Les styles de l'architecture et du mobilier (2006), pp. 107-111 The whiplash motif, adapted from vegetal forms, was widely used.

By the 1940s these styles had largely consolidated and been identified as the International Style. The exact characteristics and origins of modern architecture are still open to interpretation and debate. An important trigger appears to have been the maxim credited to Louis Sullivan: \\"form follows function\\". Functionalism in architecture, is the principle that architects should design a building based on the purpose of that building. This statement is less self-evident than it first appears, and is a matter of confusion and controversy within the profession, particularly in regard to modern architecture. =Expressionist= Goetheanum by Rudolf Steiner in 1923 Expressionist architecture was an architectural movement that developed in Northern Europe during the first decades of the 20th century in parallel with the expressionist visual and performing arts. The style was characterised by an early-modernist adoption of novel materials, formal innovation, and very unusual massing, sometimes inspired by natural biomorphic forms, sometimes by the new technical possibilities offered by the mass production of brick, steel and especially glass. Many expressionist architects fought in World War I and their experiences, combined with the political turmoil and social upheaval that followed the German Revolution of 1919, resulted in a utopian outlook and a romantic socialist agenda.Jencks, p.59 Economic conditions severely limited the number of built commissions between 1914 and the mid-1920s,Sharp, p.68 resulting in many of the most important Expressionist works remaining as projects on paper, such as Bruno Taut's Alpine Architecture and Hermann Finsterlin's Casa Nova. Zukunftsarchitektur ‚Äì Formenspiel und Feinbau. Ephemeral exhibition buildings were numerous and highly significant during this period. Scenography for theatre and films provided another outlet for the Expressionist imagination,Pehnt, p.163 and provided supplemental incomes for designers attempting to challenge conventions in a harsh economic climate. =Art Deco= The Art Deco Chrysler Building in New York City (1930) The Art Deco style in architecture emerged in Paris just before World War I with the Th√©√¢tre des Champs-√âlys√©es by Auguste Perret (1911‚Äì1913) and the Majorelle Building by Henri Sauvage (1913). Its revolutionary use of reinforced concrete, geometric forms, straight lines, and decorative sculpture applied to the outside of the building in plaques of marble, ceramics and stucco, and later in stainless steel, were a departure from Art Nouveau. The style reached its peak in the 1920s and 1930s, and took its name from the International Exhibition of Modern Industrial and Decorative Arts in Paris in 1925. Art Deco became especially popular in the United States in the late 1920s, where the style was used for skyscrapers including the Chrysler Building (1930) and Empire State Building (1931), and for lavish motion picture palaces including Radio City Music Hall (1932) in New York City and the Paramount Theater in Oakland, California. In the 1930s a stripped-down variation called Streamline Moderne emerged, which was inspired by the curving aerodynamic forms of ocean liners, airplanes and trains. Art Deco was used for office buildings, government buildings, train stations and movie theaters around the world in the 1930s, but declined rapidly at the end of the decade due to the Great Depression and intense criticism of the style by modernist architects such as Le Corbusier, who denounced what he felt was its excessive ornament. By 1939, the style was largely out of fashion and was replaced by the more austere International Style. =International Style= Glass Palace, a celebration of transparency, in Heerlen, Netherlands (1935) The International style was a major architectural trend of the 1920s and 1930s. The term usually refers to the buildings and architects of the formative decades of modernism, before World War II. The term had its origin from the name of a book by Henry-Russell Hitchcock and Philip Johnson which identified, categorised and expanded upon characteristics common to modernism across the world. As a result, the focus was more on the stylistic aspects of modernism. The basic design principles of the International Style thus constitute part of modernism. The ideas of Modernism were developed especially in what was taught at the German Bauhaus School in Weimar (from 1919), Dessau (between 1926 and 1932) and finally Berlin between 1932 and 1933, under the leadership first of its founder Walter Gropius, then Hannes Meyer, and finally Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. Modernist theory in architecture resided in the attempt to bypass the question of what style a building should be built in, a concern that had overshadowed 19th- century architecture, and the wish to reduce form to its most minimal expression of structure and function. In the United States, Philip Johnson and Henry-Russell Hitchcock treated this new phenomenon in 1931 as if it represented a new style ‚Äì the International Style, thereby misrepresenting its primary mission as merely a matter of eliminating traditional ornament. The core effort to pursue Modern architecture as an abstract, scientific programme was more faithfully carried forward in Europe, but issues of style always overshadowed its stricter and more puritan goals, not least in the work of Le Corbusier. =Contemporary= Manggha Museum of Japanese Art and Technology in Cracow, Poland, by Arata Isozaki and Krzysztof Ingarden (1994) =Modern= Modern architecture is generally characterized by simplification of form and creation of ornament from the structure and theme of the building. It is a term applied to an overarching movement, with its exact definition and scope varying widely. Modern architecture has continued into the 21st century as a contemporary style, especially for corporate office buildings. In a broader sense, modern architecture began at the turn of the 20th century with efforts to reconcile the principles underlying architectural design with rapid technological advancement and the modernization of society. It would take the form of numerous movements, schools of design, and architectural styles, some in tension with one another, and often equally defying such classification. =Critical regionalism= The Sydney Opera House, designed to evoke the sails of yachts in the Sydney harbor Critical regionalism is an approach to architecture that strives to counter the placelessness and lack of meaning in Modern architecture by using contextual forces to give a sense of place and meaning. The term critical regionalism was first used by Alexander Tzonis and Liane Lefaivre and later more famously by Kenneth Frampton. Frampton put forth his views in \\"Towards a Critical Regionalism: Six points of an architecture of resistance.\\" He evokes Paul Ric≈ìur's question of \\"how to become modern and to return to sources; how to revive an old, dormant civilization and take part in universal civilization\\". According to Frampton, critical regionalism should adopt modern architecture critically for its universal progressive qualities but at the same time should value responses particular to the context. Emphasis should be on topography, climate, light, tectonic form rather than scenography and the tactile sense rather than the visual. Frampton draws from phenomenology to supplement his arguments. =Postmodern= 1000 de La Gaucheti√®re, with ornamented and strongly defined top, middle and bottom. Contrast with the modernist Seagram Building and Torre Picasso. Postmodern architecture is an international style whose first examples are generally cited as being from the 1950s, and which continues to influence present-day architecture. Postmodernity in architecture is generally thought to be heralded by the return of \\"wit, ornament and reference\\" to architecture in response to the formalism of the International Style of modernism. As with many cultural movements, some of postmodernism's most pronounced and visible ideas can be seen in architecture. The functional and formalized shapes and spaces of the modernist movement are replaced by unapologetically diverse aesthetics: styles collide, form is adopted for its own sake, and new ways of viewing familiar styles and space abound. Classic examples of modern architecture are the Lever House and the Seagram Building in commercial space, and the architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright or the Bauhaus movement in private or communal spaces. Transitional examples of postmodern architecture are the Portland Building in Portland and the Sony Building (New York City) (originally AT&T; Building) in New York City, which borrows elements and references from the past and reintroduces color and symbolism to architecture. A prime example of inspiration for postmodern architecture lies along the Las Vegas Strip, which was studied by Robert Venturi in his 1972 book Learning from Las Vegas celebrating the strip's ordinary and common architecture. Venturi opined that \\"Less is a bore\\", inverting Mies Van Der Rohe's dictum that \\"Less is more\\". Following the postmodern movement, a renaissance of pre- modernist urban and architectural ideals established itself, with New Urbanism and New Classical architecture being prominent movements. =Deconstructivist= The Imperial War Museum North in Manchester comprises three apparently intersecting curved volumes. Deconstructivism in architecture is a development of postmodern architecture that began in the late 1980s. It is characterized by ideas of fragmentation, non-linear processes of design, an interest in manipulating ideas of a structure's surface or skin, and apparent non-Euclidean geometry,Husserl, Origins of Geometry, Introduction by Jacques Derrida (i.e., non-rectilinear shapes) which serve to distort and dislocate some of the elements of architecture, such as structure and envelope. The finished visual appearance of buildings that exhibit the many deconstructivist \\"styles\\" is characterised by a stimulating unpredictability and a controlled chaos. Important events in the history of the Deconstructivist movement include the 1982 Parc de la Villette architectural design competition (especially the entry from the French philosopher Jacques Derrida and the American architect Peter EisenmanJacques Derrida and Peter Eisenman, Chora L Works (New York: Monacelli Press, 1997) and Bernard Tschumi's winning entry), the Museum of Modern Art's 1988 Deconstructivist Architecture exhibition in New York, organized by Philip Johnson and Mark Wigley, and the 1989 opening of the Wexner Center for the Arts in Columbus, designed by Peter Eisenman. The New York exhibition featured works by Frank Gehry, Daniel Libeskind, Rem Koolhaas, Peter Eisenman, Zaha Hadid, Coop Himmelblau, and Bernard Tschumi. Since the exhibition, many of the architects who were associated with Deconstructivism have distanced themselves from the term. Nonetheless, the term has stuck and has now, in fact, come to embrace a general trend within contemporary architecture. The Schermerhorn Symphony Center in Nashville (USA), opened in 2006 The 21st century On January 21, 2013 architects began preparations for constructing the world's first 3D-printed building. An industrial-scale 3D printer used high strength artificial marble. Companies around the world have 3D-printed numerous buildings, many only taking a few hours to be completed. 3D-printed buildings have been shown to be practical, cost effective, and environmentally friendly. The technology is being expanded to other frameworks. Sustainable architecture is an important topic in contemporary architecture, including the trends of New Urbanism, New Classical architecture and Eco-cities.

Botanical science has recorded about eighty species in this genus, growing widely across the regions of Malesia, the western Pacific ocean, Australia and south & southeastern Asia; centred on the tropics between the Pacific and Indian Oceans. They grow naturally in New Guinea, eastern and northern Australia, New Caledonia, Fiji, SE Asia, southern China, the Indian subcontinent, the Philippines, Taiwan, and in the western Pacific Ocean their most easterly occurrences, in the Caroline Islands, New Zealand and Niue. The etymology of its name Dysoxylum derives from the Greek word ‚ÄòDys‚Äô meaning \\"bad\\" referring to \\"ill-smelling\\" and ‚ÄòXylon‚Äô meaning \\"wood\\".  Distribution  New Guinea has records of twenty eight species growing naturally, sixteen of them endemic. New Caledonia has recorded nine, eight of them endemic. Fiji has recorded nine, seven of them endemic. In northern and eastern coastal regions of Australia fifteen recorded species grow naturally, known as \\"rosewoods\\", though they are not closely related to the true rosewoods (Dalbergia) which are legumes. In Australia, Dysoxylum fraserianum is the original rose wood. The name rosewood was given for the odour of its freshly cut bark like a fragrance of roses. The species was named ‚Äòfraserianum‚Äô after Charles Fraser, the first colonial botanist of New South Wales. Fourteen more species are reported in Australia, distributed from within New South Wales, north through the humid east coast regions to the diversity of species in the wet tropics rainforests region of northeastern Queensland, on to Cape York Peninsula, northern parts of the Northern Territory and Western Australia. New Zealand has one endemic species D. spectabile, while Niue (island), further east at the global eastern limit of records of the genus, has a single species, the widespread (non-endemic) D. mollissimum subsp molle. On the remote oceanic islands within Australia's territorial waters, Lord Howe Island has one endemic species D. pachyphyllum; Norfolk Island shares the restricted, but not locally endemic, D. bijugum with New Caledonia and Fiji; and Christmas Island shares a single widespread species D. gaudichaudianum with Australia, Malesia and SE Asia. In the southern half of China eleven recorded species grow naturally, one of them endemic. In Sri Lanka, India and nearby Bhutan and Nepal (Indian subcontinent) large trees of the genus Dysoxylum grow naturally in forests from lowlands to mid altitude mountains. About ten to twelve recognised species grow naturally in this region. Endemic Indian species: D. beddomei, D. binectariferum, D. ficiforme and D. malabaricum. Endemic Sri Lankan species: D. championii. Species occurring in India, Sri Lanka, nearby and more widely: D. excelsum, D. gotadhora, D. grande, D. mollissimum and D. pallens. In the Indonesian Rain Forest Area of Java, the plant species reported is Dysoxylum caulostachyum.  Habitats  These trees are important components of the native tropical forests of their range, such as New Guinea, the lowland New Caledonia rain forests and the tropical forests of northern Australia. In this region more than forty different species grow naturally, from the lowlands to the mountains. In New Guinea D. enantiophyllum and an undescribed taxon have records of growing up to about altitude. In the forests of the region of China, India, Sri Lanka and the adjacent Himalayas including Bhutan and Nepal, about fourteen recorded different species grow naturally from the lowlands to the mountains up to altitude. In the region of southern China, Burma, Thailand, Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Java, Lesser Sunda Islands, Borneo (Sarawak, Sabah, east Kalimantan), Philippines and Sulawesi, the Dysoxylum species most widely distributed is known as Dysoxylum densiflorum (meaning in Latin:\\"densely flowered\\"). It is found in elevation up to elevation in alluvial soil conditions (clay and sand) and along rivers and streams and also in limestone formation in undisturbed mixed dipterocarp and sub-montane forests types. In India, it is also known by many other names such as, Indian white cedar, Bili devdari, Bombay white cedar, Velley agil, Porapa, Vella agil and Devagarige and in the evergreen forest regions of Western Ghats, North Kanara, Coorg, Anamalais, and Travancore regions.  Cultural connections  Dysoxylum densiflorum, locally known as majegau, is the plant \\"mascot\\" or floral emblem of Bali. It is found in Bali's Botanic Garden located about 50 km to north of at Denpasar, the capital city of Bali. A postage stamp was proposed to be issued by Indonesia on the rich flora and fauna of its provinces. It was proposed to issue 33 stamps in succession between 2008 and 2011. In 2008 the series issued represented the province of Bali with the stamp depicting floral species of Dysoxylum densiflorum, known as Majegau in Indonesian language. The stamp issue described the qualities of this species as \\"one of woods commonly used for Balinese carving material thanks to its strength and beautiful colour and pattern\\". Majegau (Dysoxylum densiflorum) and Bali starling (Leucopsar rothschildi) of Bali are also part of this series.  Ecological connections  The tooth-billed pigeon (Didunculus strigirostris) feeds mainly on the fruits of the Dysoxylum trees growing in its native Samoa. Foliage of D. mollissimum provides food for caterpillars of the Hercules moth (Coscinocera hercules). Among the better- known pathogens affecting this genus is Pseudomonas syringae pv. dysoxylis which often initiates frost damage in Kohekohe. The bio cultural studies initiated in the villages of Kerala indicated that nearly 50% of the seeds of Dysoxylum malabaricum could be raised as seedlings. Dysoxylum malabaricum known as white cedar belongs to the plant family Meliaceae, is called as Vella akil in Malayalam language, Vellayagil in Tamil language and Bilibudlige in Kannada language, all names attributing to the white colour of the species. The tree grows to height of 40 m height, has bark which is greyish-yellow in colour with inner bark in creamy yellow colour. Its leaves alternate or sub opposite, abruptly pinnate with angular rachis. Flowers which mature during February‚ÄìApril are greenish yellow in colour and bisexual. Fruits that ripen during June‚ÄìJuly are capsules. While natural regeneration process is common, artificial regeneration of seeds is also done by storing them in wet bags. The seeds are then sown in nursery beds of sand and soil at the rate of 3:1, and germination has been noted to occur within 70 days. Its chemical composition is known by the name ‚Äúashtagandha‚Äù, which means a fragrant smell, which is used for making incense sticks commonly used for worship. It is used for fumigation and also for Hindu ritual of fire sacrifice called yagna. Its wide therapeutic use, after making a decoction of the bark is for curing arthritis, anorexia, cardiac debility, to remove intestinal worms, inflammation, leprosy and rheumatism. Its oil is used for curing ear ache and eye diseases.  Uses  The Australian species were prized for their wood which is a rich red in colour and was widely used in the furniture trade. The common timber name for the Australian species is the rose mahogany. The New Zealand species, Kohekohe (D. spectabile), is sometimes known as New Zealand mahogany, because its wood is light, strong and polishes to a fine red colour. Rohitukine (C16H19O5N), a chromane alkaloid, was first reported from Amoora rohituka (Roxb.) Wight & Arn. (Meliaceae) and then from D. binectariferum . Rohitukine exhibits both anti-inflammatory as well as immuno-modulatory properties besides acting as an anticancer compound. Rohitukine is an important precursor for the semi- synthetic derivative, flavopiridol (C21H20Cl NO5). In India, apart from its economic importance for building and furniture making, it is an important ingredient in Ayurvedic Medicine as many species have curative qualities taken independtly or as an ingredient of a medicinal mixture. Some of the uses in Ayurveda reported are; Wood decoction of D. malabaricum to cure rheumatism and its oil is used to cure eye and ear diseases; a few species are used to cure inflammation, cardio-disorder, CNS disorder and also tumor. In Indian tradition and culture oil is extracted from the seeds Dysoxylum malabaricum, which has wide beneficial application.  Species  The majority of this listing draws from the 1995 Flora Malesiana genus treatment by David Mabberley, with further sourcing from his 2008 Flora of China genus treatment. Then the Dec 2010 Australian Tropical Rainforest Plants identification system and the carefully cross-checked species from the older 1985 Flora Vitiensis (Fiji) add a minority number of different species. * Dysoxylum acutangulum ** subsp. acutangulum ‚Äì Peninsular Thailand, Malesia: Sumatra, Malay Peninsula, Borneo, Philippines ** subsp. foveolatum ‚Äì New Guinea, Solomon Is., Queensland, NT, N.

It was designed by Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works for the United States Air Force Force Protection Airborne Surveillance System (FPASS) Program on a quick-reaction contract issued late in the winter of 2002, with the first system delivered in the early summer. It was designed quickly, because the program leveraged technology and design studies developed for the MicroStar MAVs. The program was run by Electronic Systems Center. In 2007, the U.S. Air Force FPASS office switched all of their UAV systems over to the RQ-11B Raven. It is made mostly of plastic foam, resembling hobby grade model airplanes, and uses an electric motor driving a pusher propeller as a powerplant, making it very quiet. It is launched with a bungee cord, carries three small CCD cameras, has an endurance of about an hour. It flies mostly under autonomous control, with the operator keeping track of its activity with a laptop computer. The Desert Hawk is also used by the 32nd Regiment Royal Artillery of the British Army as a tactical surveillance system, and has been used in Afghanistan and Mali.http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceNews/EquipmentAndLogistics/RoyalArtilleryToTakeUavToAfghanistan.htm Desert Hawk has since been replaced with the more capable and rugged Desert Hawk III.

The leaves are simple or pinnate, and the flowers bisexual with four sepals, four petals and eight stamens. They have a broad distribution including in India, Malesia, Australia and the islands of the western Pacific Ocean. About twenty species are endemic to Australia. Description Plants in the genus Acronychia are shrubs or trees with simple or trifoliate leaves arranged in opposite pairs and with oil glands in the leaves. The flowers are arranged in leaf axils either singly or in cymes or panicles. The flowers are bisexual, with four sepals, four petals and eight stamens. The petals are free from each other, as are the stamens. The stigma is small, not differentiated from the style, the fruit is a drupe and the seeds are black. Taxonomy and naming The genus Acronychia was first formally described in 1775 by Johann Reinhold Forster and Georg Forster in their book Characteres Generum Plantarum. The first species they described, the type was Acronychia laevis.

One of the first railways in New Zealand, it opened in 1867 and is still operating. Presently, it essentially functions as an elongated industrial siding. Construction In the early days of New Zealand's colonisation, transport between Bluff and Invercargill was through sometimes impassable swampy terrain. Construction of a road to Bluff (called Campbelltown until March 1917) was approved in 1859, but the swamp defeated the builders and by 1861, a railway was being considered as an alternative. On 8 August 1863 \\"Lady Barkly\\", arguably the first locomotive to steam in New Zealand, ran on a small section of track on Invercargill Jetty, and the same year construction of a line to Bluff began. In 1863 the failure of the wooden rails used on the Invercargill-Makarewa section of what became the Kingston Branch became apparent, and the decision was made to use iron rails to Bluff. Originally thought to be of reasonable cost to construct, the line soon proved otherwise. =Well built but costly and troublesome= Built to the international standard gauge of , the railway followed standard British method of keeping the line on a level grade as much as possible. Construction from the Invercargill Harbour and Wharf area soon became troublesome with the direct route across the New River estuary proving difficult due to the deep swampy mud needing to be piled up with rocks and hardwood poles. The line made it to Clifton and easier ground as the raised formation skirted the banks of the east arm of the estuary passing over the Waimatua Creek. At start of the Awarua plains, yet again swampy ground caused delays as large embankments and a sizeable bridge were needed to cross the tidal Mokotua Stream at Wards Crossing. Spoil taken from a large cutting at Woodend, to keep the line level, assisted in creating the embankments. After Awarua the line had it easy going until the upper reaches of Bluff Harbour where costly large stone causeways were constructed to take the line around the Ocean Beach neck and onto the Bluff peninsular. A quarry nearby was used for material needed. Helping with the construction, a small branch line was laid to the Mokomoko inlet jetty with coastal shipping off-loading supplies. (see below) =Controversial opening= The line opened on 5 February 1867 after delay caused by the Southland Provincial Council going bankrupt due to the high cost of building both this line and a wooden railway northwards to Makarewa (later part of the Kingston Branch). During the last phases of building, the line was blocked at Greenhills by angry contractors who were still to be paid for work done on the large causeways that carried the line down the upper Bluff harbour. The local Sheriff seized all assets on the line, a form of receivership enacted, allowing the finishing off work to continue. The situation was resolved when the Otago Provincial as well as Central Government absorbed the debts which amounted to approximately $120 million in 2010 currency. =Kew diversion= The formation and bridges that crossed the upper New River estuary continued to cause trouble with the line formation sinking and making the journey uncomfortable for travellers. It was decided to divert the line around the estuary foreshore from what is today the Crinnan St level crossing, paralleling the Bluff Highway around past the Kew Bush area and meeting up with the line at Clifton. This was completed 1872. This route would later be of benefit to the future Seaward Bush/Tokanui branch line that had its Invercargill junction points south of Clyde St station. Little remains of the harbour crossing and Invercargill Wharf due to draining and substantial land reclamation over 100 years, some bridge piles are still visible. =Regauged= In 1870, the central government took effective control of railway development from the provinces of New Zealand. To unify all rail systems operating in the colony, and to ease cost of construction, the national rail gauge was set at a narrow gauge of . The Bluff Branch was converted to this gauge in a single day, 18 December 1875. The original standard gauge locomotives retreating to the Bluff wharf and then loaded onto ships and sent to New South Wales. The rolling stock was converted for use on the new gauge. Mokomoko Harbour Branch During the construction phase of the Bluff Branch, contractors found that landing urgent supplies at the Invercargill wharf could prove difficult due to the worsening danger of the New River estuary silting up dangerous sand bars. Contractors were having a difficult time building over and around the upper reaches of the estuary and getting equipment into the area proved troublesome. At the mouth of the estuary was the moderately deep and weather sheltered entry to the Mokomoko inlet. A Jetty already existed at the eastern side of the inlet entrance for the local settlers and at one point was promoted as an alternative to both Campbelltown and Invercargill's port ambitions. It was decided to lay a spur line off the still incomplete Bluff mainline to the jetty which consisted of a large curve that required deep drains on each side. The junction points faced Awarua with a small flag station controlling the points. The branch was only ever useful as a supply line and few passengers were carried, mainly from the small coastal steamers that would land at the jetty instead of risking the voyage up to Invercargill. When the new wharf at Bluff Harbour opened, the Mokomoko jetty fell into disuse. The railway remained until change of gauge day on 18 December 1875 when it was decided to close the line instead of re- gauging it. The rails were taken up and used elsewhere. Thanks to the well built drain canals on each side of the formation, the original route is still visible and easily traced on Google Earth as a large curve leading to the old jetty, in which piles still remain. Operation Bluff established itself as the port of Southland and the line has always been busy with both inbound and outbound freight. Major railway facilities were built around the original Town wharf site with most servicing equipment moving to the new and substantial Island Harbour port built in 1956. When containerisation was introduced and freight transportation trends changed, Bluff was not selected to be developed as a container port, but it and the railway have remained busy with traffic such as frozen meat, wool, and wood chips. In more recent years a degree of containerisation has taken place with the port investing in mobile crane and straddler facilities, rail playing a predominant role in moving containers from the large private container distribution centre located at Clifton. In 2016 a new port owned multimodal distribution centre was completed on an unused area of the Invercargill railway yards next to the Bluff Line entrance. The port company favouring rail as its wharf to centre transportation solution. =Station= As with all colonial transport facilities over time, Bluff station started with a rudimentary class 5 station until growing into an impressive two-story Gordon Troup designed edifice befitting of the southernmost railway station in the British empire. For many years, passenger traffic on the line was heavy, with 12,000 fares travelling in a single day to a regatta in Bluff on 1 January 1900. However, the development of modern road networks and private cars caused passenger numbers to decline. The 1950 public timetable showed seven weekday services each way, with an eighth on Fridays; five on Saturdays; and one on Sundays. This declined starkly over the following years, and by 1964, only one passenger train ran each way on weekdays and none at weekends. The remaining service was operated for school children, running from Bluff to Invercargill in the morning and returning in the late afternoon. In 1967, all services were cancelled. The impressive station was rundown and used as surplus storage until a fire damaged it in 1970, promptly demolished after. Passenger trains briefly returned when the Kingston Flyer operated some services to Bluff between 1979 and 1982. =Locomotives= Steam Locomotives used on the line were mainly restricted to the lightweight U and Q class along with smaller tank locomotives such as Wa, Wf, F and D classes. The reason being the only turning facilities at Bluff was the \\"Wye\\" layout that was part of the wharf's lighter rail access bridges. Only the tank locomotives could use the wharf trackage and they were assisted by a capstan winch system that could pull wagons into position under ship's cranes, Bluff town wharf never having cranes. The small shunters would also assist with handling rakes of wagons to and from the Ocean Beach freezing works. Locomotives were serviced at a modest two road depot located at the northern end of the station yard although, apart from the wharf shunters, only one mainline locomotive remained overnight to head the first early 5 am mixed train to Invercargill. Island Harbour In the early 1950s, New Zealand was basking in a large economic boom period and modernisation around the country was taking place. Southland was at the forefront of a major agricultural export boom and the now ageing town wharf simply couldn't cope with the heavy demands of rail traffic and busy shipping causing it. The Harbour Board decided to build and island harbour facility that could handle the then latest bulk meat loading methods. This new island construction was begun in 1955. The island would have a substantial rail network built on it. =Station and working yards= After the construction of the Island Harbour in 1957, the larger Ab, J and Ja mainline locomotives were used as the new facility was solid ground. The junction points to the new port facility faced Invercargill to allow direct access for mainline train movements. A small signal box controlled the junction handling trains from the original town station. A new Bluff Station crew and loco depot with a turning Wye was built (instead of a turntable) on the island. This also housed the diesel powered Hunslett DSA class shunters, which also shunted the town side railyards and what was now called the Town Wharf. Mainline locomotives returned to Invercargill with the last train everyday. The huge Ocean Beach freezing works was also shunted by the Bluff-based shunters. Frozen meat from other works around the region were also handled through the port, creating substantial rail traffic for the branch. A then unique all-weather meat loading facility allowed for trains to be shunted directly into a large five-bay shed with overhead conveyor loaders carrying frozen carcasses out of wagons and directly into the ship's hold. Rationalisation When the Ocean Beach freezing works closed in 1989 and bulk shipping of frozen meat methods changed to containerisation in the 1990s, most of the town side rail yards and sidings, including the old wharf rails were lifted. The last of many level crossings into warehouses along Gore Street, Bluff's main street, were removed in 1990. A substantial drop in rail traffic has resulted as Southland moved from sheep meat based farming to dairy. Shipping patterns also changed, with bulk commodities taking over. Minimal trackage on the town's station site remains to serve the substantial cool stores located along Gore Street. This also includes the southern tip of the KiwiRail network. Beautification work along the old railway yards has created a park-like setting. The only substantial structures are now the station goods shed and a re-positioned wagon turntable to represent the numerous former level crossings on Gore Street. Some rails to warehouses remain in situ at old entrances. The Island Harbour's loco depot was closed in 1999, with all shunting and train handling controlled from Invercargill. The locomotive turning wye was taken out of use shortly after. Rail facilities were rationalised to suit log and container handling after the all-weather meat loading facilities were decommissioned in 2000. All pier-side rail activity was ended in 2010 because of new government safety laws. Rail access to the old Ocean Beach freezing works was removed in 2016, eliminating the level crossing over State Highway 1. =Modern locomotive power= Mainline diesel power arrived on the Bluff Branch in the mid-1960s, sharing the line with steam power until 1970. After a trial with the heavy DG class diesel locomotives, services were operated by DJ class locomotives after their introduction in 1968 on account of their lower axle-load. The DE class heavy shunting locomotive also worked the line on lighter transfer work. Following the withdrawal of the DJ class in the late 1980s and after structural strengthening of bridges, both DBR and DC class locomotives were used. The DF and DX classes were occasional visitors with larger trains. Shunting power remained the preserve of the DSA class until the larger, twin engine, DSC class shunters arrived in 1988. In recent years the predominant motive power has been the Invercargill-based high powered DSG class shunters, which also serve the large Balance Agri-Nutri phosphate works at Awarua's Wards Crossing. =2000s‚Äì2010s= In 2000 the line was downgraded to industrial shunt status to save day-to-day operating administration costs. One-train-at-a-time operations are the norm south of Clifton, although the crossing loop at Wards Crossing allows for two train operation on Traffic Warrant Control. The level crossing into the Phosphate Works at Wards Crossing is still active with regular shunting services. It is the southernmost level crossing on State Highway 1. The new inland South Port multimodal container terminal located on a portion of the Invercargill railway yard has returned considerable tonnage to the line. Regular maintenance of the line including sleeper replacement has allowed for heavier tare weight wagons to now operate over it. Passenger excursions still are a regular feature on the line, although passenger handling facilities are non-existent and tender forward operations are necessary for steam locomotives as they are unable to be turned. Apart from wayside stations closing, the line has needed no major reconstruction work mainly because of the legacy of its excellent, if somewhat costly, 19th century British railway construction methods.

Zebrawood is characterized by a striped figure that is reminiscent of a zebra. The name originally applied to the wood of Astronium graveolens, a large tree native to Central America. In the 20th century, the most important source of zebrawood was Microberlinia brazzavillensis, also called zebrano, a tree native to Central Africa. Other sources include Brazilian Astronium fraxinifolium, African Brachystegia spiciformis, Pacific Guettarda speciosa, and Asian Pistacia integerrima. History Zebrawood was first recorded in the British Customs returns for 1773, when 180 pieces of zebrawood were imported from the Mosquito Coast, a British colony (now Republic of Honduras and Nicaragua).The National Archives (United Kingdom), Cust. 3. In his History of Jamaica (1774), Edward Long relates, \\"The species of zebra wood at present in esteem among the cabinet-makers is brought to Jamaica from the Mosquito shore; it is of a most lovely tint, and richly veined...\\"Edward Long, History of Jamaica, 3 Vols, London (1774), III, pp. 837-8. The Mosquito Coast thereafter exported zebrawood regularly until the Convention of London (1786) and the consequent expulsion of British settlers from this part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain. Zebrawood table An alternative name which occurs in 18th century British sources is palmaletto or palmalatta, from palo mulatto, which was the local name for the wood. At the beginning of the 19th century, another source of zebrawood was found in Brazil. This species, Astronium fraxinifolium, is native to northern South America, especially north-eastern Brazil. It is now traded as goncalo alves, a Portuguese name used in Brazil. On the European and American markets, however, it was still called zebrawood, and commonly used in British furniture-making between about 1810 and 1860. For most of the 19th century, the botanical identity of zebrawood was unknown. For many years, it was thought to be the product of Omphalobium lambertii DC., later reclassified as Connarus guianensis Lamb ex DC., and finally as Connarus lambertii (DC.) Britton. Despite similarities between the timbers of Connarus and Astronium, the former has yet to be identified on surviving furniture. \\"Published statements that certain species [of Connarus] supply furniture woods are undoubtedly incorrect.\\"Samuel J. Record & Robert W. Hess, Timbers of the New World, New York (1972), p. 135. In the 20th century, the name zebrawood, as applied to Astronium species, went out of use. The word now usually refers to wood of the very different African tree Microberlinia brazzavillensis, but may be applied to other woods, mostly belonging to the same family Fabaceae, but not exclusively so, for example: Brachystegia spiciformis Goncalo alves.  Zebrawood proper  The wood of Microberlinia (also known as Zebrano) is imported from central Africa, (Gabon, Cameroon, and Congo). The heartwood is a pale golden yellow, distinct from the very pale color of the sapwood and features narrow streaks of dark brown to black. Zebrawood can also be a pale brown with regular or irregular marks of dark brown in varying widths. It is almost always quartersawn to get the exciting alternating color pattern. It is a heavy, hard wood with a somewhat coarse texture, often with an interlocked or wavy grain. The interlocked grain of this wood, like that of many tropical woods, can make it difficult to work. It is also a decorative exotic wood, used in a limited way for veneer, wall paneling, custom furniture, furniture trim, inlay bandings, marquetry, specialty items and turnery. It is also sometimes seen as stocks of shotguns and rifles or in exotic guitars. In the past, it was used in Cadillac and Mercedes-Benz automobiles. Because of its hardness, it can also be used for skis and tool handles.

Miguel de Pedrorena took him into custody, but Commodore Robert F. Stockton finally gave Felipa and her husband a pass through the lines, to go to their rancho. With their children they walked all the way to San Luis Rey Mission, where another band of Californios seized them and threatened to shoot Marr√≥n for having collaborated with the Americans. They released him but stripped his Agua Hedionda Rancho of horses and cattle. Later Rancho Agua Hedionda was acquired and held by the Kelly family for many years. The adobe home of Marr√≥n still stands, although modernized in the 1960s. Marr√≥n died in 1853 and is buried in El Campo Santo Catholic Cemetery in Old Town San Diego. His wife Juliana (is not his wife, but his mother-in-law, Felipa's own mother) died in 1871 (Juliana, born Lopez, is next to her own husband, Juan Maria Osuna, the Alcalde) both are buried nearby him. I'd have to recheck if Felipa is buried there; she lived a long life, passed years after JMM. Note: Whomever thought Juliana was JMM's wife, please don't edit without having sourced info to in fact know; others then copy or assume and then have incorrect info placed elsewhere.

The specific spices vary somewhat from one region to another but typically include: garam masala, garlic, ginger, onion, cayenne pepper, and sometimes other spices and additives. The spices are often ground together with a pestle and mortar. Tandoori masala is used extensively with dishes such as tandoori chicken. In this dish, the chicken is covered with a mixture of plain yogurt and tandoori masala. The chicken is then roasted in the tandoor on high heat; when prepared in this fashion the chicken has a pink-colored exterior and a savory flavor. Other chicken dishes, in addition to tandoori chicken, use this masala, such as tikka or butter chicken, most of them Punjabi dishes. Meat other than chicken can be used, as can paneer (paneer tikka). If freshly prepared, the masala can be stored in airtight jars for up to two months. The spice blend is also readily available at larger supermarkets and specialty Asian stores, with varying tastes depending on the brand.

On the night of Nov. 7, 1841, Washington led 17 of his fellow slaves into rebellion; they killed one of the slave traders on board and wounded crew. Taking control of the Creole, they commanded that it be sailed to Nassau, which was a British colony. The United Kingdom had already abolished slavery in 1833 in the British Empire. Despite American protests, the British declared the slaves to be free persons under their law and refused American demands for their return. The British authorities in Nassau took Washington and his 17 conspirators into custody under charges of mutiny. A special session of the Admiralty Court heard the case, but ruled in favor of the men and freed them in April 1842. The remaining 116 slaves had achieved freedom immediately in the preceding fall. Five had remained on the ship and chose to return to the United States and slavery. As 128 slaves gained freedom resulting from this revolt, it is considered the most successful in United States history.

Plectranthus nummulariuscf. theplantlist.org: Plectranthus verticillatus (L.f.) Druce. Retrieved 13 February 2013.), Swedish ivy, Swedish begonia or whorled plectranthus) is a plant in the family Lamiaceae (Labiatae), genus Plectranthus. Despite its common name, it is not close to the ivy family of the genus Hedera.  Description  The plant has aromatic glossy, green, round leaves, which show a deep purple color in the center sometimes and tend to trail, reaching a height of between 10 to 30 cm and extends around 60 cm. This deep purple can also be found on the plant stems and on the underside of leaves. The leaves, which are widely serrated, are fleshy and rounded between 64 to 90 mm, with purple and hairy undersides with reddish sessile glands. The upright racemes appear white, pale violet or pale pink and can sprout sporadically throughout the year (but more typically in spring and late autumn), which form verticillasters of 2-4 flowers and 2-3 mm bracts. The fruits are 1 mm nuts, brown in colour and wrinkled.cf. Description and picture at PlantZAfrica.com: Plectranthus verticillatus (L.f.) Druce. Retrieved 13 February 2013. The name \\"Swedish ivy\\" is deceptive: the plant is not thigmotropic (meaning it does not cling to walls with the roots when it grows), is not native to Sweden, and is not closely related to the genus of ivy (Hedera). Some variegated, slivery plants called Swedish Ivy grown in pots and hanging baskets are Plectranthus oertendahlii from coastal river gorges of KwaZulu-Natal.  Distribution  Plectranthus verticillatus is native to southern Africa where it occurs in the Cape Provinces, KwaZulu- Natal, Swaziland, the Northern Provinces and southern Mozambique.cf. World Checklist of Selected Plant Families: Plectranthus verticillatus_id=158574. Retrieved 13 February 2013. It is found naturalized in El Salvador, Honduras, the Leeward Islands, the Venezuela Antilles, the Windward Islands, Venezuela, Puerto Rico, Hawaii as well as south-east Queensland and coastal areas of New South Wales in Australia.  Use as ornamental plant  Plectranthus verticillatus is a robust plant doing well in indirect sunlight, mostly cultivated as hanging houseplant. In frost-free areas, it is also found as groundcover in gardens or sprouting down walls. It likes to stay moist and it also responds well to pruning. It can easily be rooted with cuttings and its vulnerability is low; but a weak plant can be infested with spider mites.

They are commonly called \\"walnut\\" despite not being related to the Northern Hemisphere walnuts (Juglans spp.) which are in the family Juglandaceae. Ecology Shrubs and trees with lauroid leaves mostly, with bisexual flowers, usually with a large edible berry ovoid or globose, and seated directly on the pedicel. The seeds are dispersed by animals and birds. They have a broad distribution across South East Asia, Australia and into the western Pacific Ocean. Endiandra is a genus of evergreen trees belonging to the Laurel family, Lauraceae. Fossils show that before glaciations, when the climate was more humid and mild, species were distributed more widely. They are distributed in Asia, from India to Indochina, China, Malaysia, Australia, and Pacific islands, with 38 species endemic to Australia. In Australia, they are often used as screen trees due to the thick foliage of a number of their species. Quite a few of the Australian species are rare, such as Endiandra globosa, Endiandra muelleri subsp. bracteata and Endiandra floydii. The drying of the area during the glaciations caused that Endiandra to retreat to the mildest climate refuges, including Oceanic and southern islands and wetter mountain area. With the end of the last glacial period, Endiandra recovered some of its former range. They are mostly relicts of a type of vegetation disappeared, which originally covered much of the mainland of Australia, South America, Antarctica, South Africa, North America and other lands when their climate were more humid and warm. Although warm Cloud forests disappeared during the glaciations, they re- colonized large areas every time the weather was favorable again. Most of the Cloud forests are believed to have retreated and advanced during successive geological eras, and their species adapted to warm and wet gradually retreated and advanced, replaced by more cold-tolerant or drought-tolerant sclerophyll plant communities. Many of the then existing species became extinct because they could not cross the barriers posed by new oceans, mountains and deserts, but others found refuge as species relict in coastal areas and Islands. Some species are well adapted to Tropical dry or deciduous forests, including Monsoon forests and Dry Monsoon forest. Some Endiandra present a convergent evolution due to ecological or physical drivers toward a similar solution, including analogous structures with species adapted to different environments, for example with plants adapted to Laurel forest habitat. These Endiandra resemble other genera in the family Lauraceae, and their leaves are lauroid type with berries eaten and dispersed mostly by birds. Others are even adapted to very wet media. Some species are endangered and others have a very specialized ecological niche and consequently occupy small or specific areas. Although the majority of the species are the products of parapatric speciation, some groups have an ancient Gondwanan distribution and some groups responded to favourable climatic periods as opportunistic species and expanded across the available habitat, these last groups occur across wide distribution with close relatives and few species, indicating the recent divergence of these species. Many species are having edible fruits. Some birds and bats that are specialised frugivores tend to eat the whole fruit and regurgitate seeds intact, which functions for Biological dispersal. Others swallow the fruit and pass the seed intact through the gut. An incomplete list of birds that rely heavily on the fruit for their diet include members of the families Cotingidae, Columbidae, Trogonidae, Turdidae, and Toucan. The fruits are an important food source for Palaeognathae highly dependent. Seed dispersal of various species in the genus is also carried out by fishes and big and small mammals as Pachyderms, Bovids, monkeys, arboreal rodents, porcupines, or possums.

It is used as an architectural ornament, a religious symbol, and in other modern works of art or a logo for adornment (including tattoos),Celtic knot Tattoo: border encircling Triple knotwork Hares by \\"WildSpiritWolf\\". jewelry, and a coat of arms on an escutcheon.The \\"three hares motif from a window of the Paderborn cathedral cloister (Unity and Trinity as a symbol of the Trinity, the central mystery of faith of the Catholic Church and the whole of Christendom)\\". Coat of Arms, Bishop Paul Werner Scheele, Bischof von W√ºrzburg 1979‚Äì2003. See Ecclesiastical heraldry. It is viewed as a puzzle, a topology problem or a visual challenge, and has been rendered as sculpture, drawing, and painting. The symbol features three hares or rabbits chasing each other in a circle. Like the triskelion, the triquetra, and their antecedents (e.g., the triple spiral), the symbol of the three hares has a threefold rotational symmetry. Each of the ears is shared by two hares, so that only three ears are shown. Although its meaning is apparently not explained in contemporary written sources from any of the medieval cultures where it is found, it is thought to have a range of symbolic or mystical associations with fertility and the lunar cycle. When used in Christian churches, it is presumed to be a symbol of the Trinity. Its origins and original significance are uncertain, as are the reasons why it appears in such diverse locations. Origins in Buddhism and diffusion on the Silk Road The spread of the three hares symbol between 600 and 1500 The earliest occurrences appear to be in cave temples in China, dated to the Sui dynasty (6th to 7th centuries)./news18/idpnews_18.a4d The Travels of the Three Rabbits: Shared Iconography Across the Silk Road, International Dunhuang Project Newsletter No. 18. The iconography spread along the Silk Road,Whitfield, Susan, The Silk Road: trade, travel, war and faith, p. 290. London: The British Library. ; . and was a symbol associated with Buddhism. In other contexts the metaphor has been given different meaning. For example, Guan Youhui, a retired researcher from the Dunhuang Academy, who spent 50 years studying the decorative patterns in the Mogao Caves, believes the three rabbits‚Äî\\"like many images in Chinese folk art that carry auspicious symbolism‚Äîrepresent peace and tranquility\\". See Aurel Stein. The hares have appeared in Lotus motifs. The three hares appear on 13th century Mongol metalwork, and on a copper coin, found in Iran, dated to 1281. Another appears on an ancient Islamic-made reliquary from southern Russia. Another 13th or early 14th century box, later used as a reliquary, was made in Iran under Mongol rule, and is preserved in the treasury of the Cathedral of Trier in Germany. On its base, the casket has Islamic designs, and originally featured two images of the three hares. One was lost through damage. One theory pertaining to the spread of the motif is that it was transported from China across Asia and as far as the south west of England by merchants travelling the silk road and that the motif was transported via designs found on expensive Oriental ceramics. This view is supported by the early date of the surviving occurrences in China. However, the majority of representations of the three hares in churches occur in England and northern Germany. This supports a contrary view that the three hares occurred independently as English or early German symbols. Some claim that the Devon name, Tinners' Rabbits, is related to local tin miners adopting it. The mines generated wealth in the region and funded the building and repair of many local churches, and thus the symbol may have been used as a sign of the miners' patronage. The architectural ornament of the three hares also occurs in churches that are unrelated to the miners of South West England. Other occurrences in England include floor tiles at Chester Cathedral, stained glass at Long Melford, SuffolkAt the Holy Trinity Church, Long Melford, above the northern door, is a small stained glass roundel, only a few inches in diameter. and a ceiling in Scarborough, Yorkshire. In Western Europe The motif of the three hares is used in a number of medieval or more recent European churches, particularly in France (e.g., in the Basilica of Notre-Dame de Fourvi√®re in Lyon) and Germany. It occurs with the greatest frequency in the churches of Devon, England where it appears to be a recollection of earlier Insular Celtic design such as the triaxially symmetric triskele and other Romano-British designs which are known from early British 'Celtic' (La Tene) metalwork such as circular enamelled and openwork triskel brooches (fibulae). The motif appears in illuminated manuscripts amongst similar devices such as the anthropomorphic \\"beard pullers\\" seen in manuscripts such as the Book of Kells, architectural wood carving, stone carving, window tracery and stained glass. In South Western England there are over thirty recorded examples of the three hares appearing on 'roof bosses' (carved wooden knobs) on the ceilings in medieval churches in Devon, (particularly Dartmoor). There is a good example of a roof boss of the three hares at Widecombe-in-the- Moor, Dartmoor, with another in the town of Tavistock on the edge of the moor. The motif occurs with similar central placement in Synagogues. Another occurrence is on the ossuary that by tradition contained the bones of St. Lazarus. Where it occurs in England, the three hares motif usually appears in a prominent place in the church, such as the central rib of the chancel roof, or on a central rib of the nave. This suggests that the symbol held significance to the church, and casts doubt on the theory that they may have been a masons' or carpenters' signature marks. There are two possible and perhaps concurrent reasons why the three hares may have found popularity as a symbol within the church. Firstly, it was widely believed that the hare was hermaphrodite and could reproduce without loss of virginity. This led to an association with the Virgin Mary, with hares sometimes occurring in illuminated manuscripts and Northern European paintings of the Virgin and Christ Child. The other Christian association may have been with the Holy Trinity, representing the \\"One in Three and Three in One\\" of which the triangle or three interlocking shapes such as rings are common symbols. In many locations the three hares are positioned adjacent to the Green Man, a symbol commonly believed to be associated with the continuance of Anglo-Saxon or Celtic paganism. These juxtapositions may have been created to imply the contrast of the Divine with man's sinful, earthly nature. In Judaism In Judaism, the \\"shafan\\" in Hebrew has symbolic meaning.In Hebrew, the rock hyrax is called ◊©◊§◊ü ◊°◊ú◊¢ (shafan sela), meaning rock \\"shafan\\", where the meaning of shafan is obscure, but is colloquially used as a synonym for rabbit in modern Hebrew. . Although rabbits are listed as a non-kosher animal in the Biblethey at least arguably chew their cud lacking cloven hoovesrabbits can carry very positive symbolic connotations, like lions and eagles. 16th century German scholar Rabbi Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi, saw the rabbits as a symbol of the Jewish diaspora. The replica of the Chodorow Synagogue from Poland (on display at the Museum of the Jewish Diaspora in Tel Aviv) has a ceiling with a large central painting which depicts a double-headed eagle holds two brown rabbits in its claws without harming them. The painting is surrounded by a citation from the end of Deuteronomy: This may be translated: \\"As an eagle that stirreth up her nest, hovereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her pinions (...thus is God to the Jewish people).\\" The hare frequently appears in the form of the symbol of the \\"rotating rabbits\\". An ancient German riddle describes this graphic thus: This curious graphic riddle can be found in all of the famous wooden synagogues from the period of the 17th and 18th century in the Ashknaz region (in Germany) that are on museum display in Beth Hatefutsoth Museum in Tel Aviv, the Jewish Museum Berlin and The Israel Museum in Jerusalem. They also appear in the Synagogue from Horb am Neckar (donated to the Israel Museum). The three animals adorn the wooden panels of the prayer room from Unterlimpurg near Schw√§bisch Hall, which may be seen in replica in the Jewish Museum Berlin. They also are seen in a main exhibit of the Diaspora Museum in Tel Aviv. Israeli art historian Ida Uberman wrote about this house of worship: \\"... Here we find depictions of three kinds of animals, all organized in circles: eagles, fishes and hares. These three represent the Kabbalistic elements of the world: earth, water and fire/heavens... The fact that they are always three is important, for that number . . . is important in the Kabbalistic context\\". Not only do they appear among floral and animal ornaments, but they are often in a distinguished location, directly above the Torah ark, the place where the holy scriptures repose. They appear on headstones in Sataniv (–°–∞—Ç–∞–Ω—ñ–≤), Khmelnytsky Oblast, western Ukraine. As an optical illusion or puzzle The logo presents a problem in topology.

Juan Mar√≠a Osuna was District elector in 1830 and took part in the Mexican Revolution of 1831. After retiring as a corporal, Osuna and his family were the first to build on the plain outside the Presidio of San Diego. He built a three-room adobe with his sons and a dispensary. In 1833, with five other male citizens, Osuna urged the governor to establish a pueblo (town) government for San Diego, to replace 60-some years of military rule. On January 1, 1835, this came to reality and Osuna was elected the first Alcade of San Diego pueblo. Lt. Santiago Arg√ºello, the last Commandant of San Diego Presidio gave Osuna his staff of office, symbolizing the transfer of government from the military to civilian self-rule. He defeated P√≠o Pico by 13 votes. Pico later became the last Mexican governor of Alta California. Osuna also served as juez de pas (justice of the peace) 1839‚Äì40 and 1846. On February 15, 1806 Juan Mar√≠a Osuna married Mar√≠a Juliana Josepha Lopez, who was born March 16, 1791 to Juan Francisco Lopez, of the Portol√† Expedition) and Mar√≠a Feliciana Arballo de Gutierrez. Their daughter Felipa married Juan Mar√≠a Marr√≥n, their daughter Luguarda married Jos√© Mar√≠a Alvarado, and their two sons were Leandro and Ramon. Juan Mar√≠a Osuna was granted Rancho San Dieguito, 25 miles (40 km.) north of San Diego along the coast, during 1836‚Äì1845. He raised cattle and horses on the ranch. Osuna had a weakness in gambling and had to sell some of his land to pay off his debts. Today Rancho San Dieguito is known as Rancho Santa Fe, an exclusive residential area. Juan Mar√≠a Osuna's adobe, overlooking the San Dieguito River Valley, has been restored and is part of The Inn at Rancho Santa Fe. During the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War Juan Mar√≠a Osuna remained loyal to Mexico. In 1846, U.S. troops occupied his San Diego home and his youngest son Santiago was killed. His last years were difficult under U.S. rule as he didn't speak English and was unfamiliar with U.S. law and customs. Osuna died 1851, and is buried in El Campo Santo Catholic Cemetery in Old Town San Diego. A modern headstone reads \\"Juan Maria Osuna Died 1851 First Alcalde Of San Diego\\".

College career Simmons played college football at the University of Southern California. He is famous at USC for intercepting a pass by catching the ball with his legs during a game against UCLA in 2001, returning the interception 34 yards for a touchdown. Near the end of the 1999 college football season, Simmons suffered a back injury which required him to sit out at the end of the season. While undergoing an MRI on his back in the summer of 2000, a series of tests determined that there were tumors in his chest and near his kidneys. As a result, Simmons spent six weeks in the hospital and underwent three surgeries. Simmons survived a near ordeal with death and lost forty pounds.

This primate is found on three of the Nicobar Islands‚ÄîGreat Nicobar, Little Nicobar and Katchal‚Äîin biome regions consisting of tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests. Morphology The Nicobar long-tailed macaque has brownish to grey fur, with lighter colouration on its undersides. Its face is pinkish- brown, with white colour spots on its eyelids. Infants are born with a dark natal coating, which lightens as they reach maturity, which occurs at about one year of age. The gestational period is five-and-a-half months. Adult males are roughly one-and-a-half times larger than the females, and can measure up to in height, and weigh up to . The males also have larger canine teeth than the females. The tail is longer than the head-to-rump height. Like other macaques it possesses cheek pouches in which it can store food temporarily, and transport it away from the foraging site to be eaten in shelter and safety. In captivity it can have a lifespan of up to approximately thirty years, however in the wild this is much shorter.Cawthorn Lang 2006 Distribution The Nicobar Islands, three of which‚ÄîGreat Nicobar, Little Nicobar, and Katchal Island‚Äîprovide the natural habitat for these macaques A 2003 study identified some 788 groups of this subspecies in the wild across the three islands, in group sizes averaging 36 individuals, although groups of up to 56 were recorded. The groups are composed of multiple adult males and females, together with their immature offspring. Adult females in a group outnumbered the adult males by a general ratio of 4:1, with the ratio of immature young macaques to adult females being near-equal, indicative of a healthy population replenishment. Apart from these populations in the wild, only a single group (as of 2002) of some 17 individuals is held in an Indian zoo for captivity breeding and research purposes.Walker & Molur 2001 Populations of this subspecies are particularly noted in the Great Nicobar Biosphere Reserve, and its two constituent National parks of India, Campbell Bay National Park and Galathea National Park. Although these regions are protected areas, and the animal is classified as a Schedule I animal under India's 1972 Wildlife (Protection) Act, the increasing encroachment of settlements and farmlands in adjoining areas of the southeastern part of the island has led to some problems with the local inhabitants. Bands of Nicobar long-tailed macaques have been reported as damaging the settlers' crops, and a few macaques have been illegally killed. In particular, they are sometimes hunted or trapped to protect coconut plantations. crab-eating macaques on Great Nicobar have long been hunted for subsistence by the indigenous Shompen peoples of Great Nicobar, although they do not form a substantial part of their diet. As with other primates whose habitats overlap with or are encroached upon by human settlement activities, there is some risk of zoonotic disease transference to individuals who come into close contact with them. One 1984 study has identified their susceptibility to malarial parasites.Sinha & Gajana 1984:567 (abstract) Habitat Its preferred habitat includes mangroves, other coastal forests and riverine environments; however it is also found in inland forests at altitudes of up to above mean sea level The highest point in the Nicobars, Mount Thullier on Great Nicobar, is some high. In particular, areas of forest with trees of sp. Pandanus are favoured.Umapathy et al. 2003 Bands of these macaques living in coastal zones tend towards a more terrestrial existence and spend less time living in the trees than do the more arboreal populations of the inland forest zones. Each band has a favoured territory, preferentially close to a water source, over which they roam; this territory measures some on average. Behaviour The Nicobar long-tailed macaque is a frugivore, with its principal diet consisting of fruits and nuts. In common with other crab-eating macaques it turns to other sources of food‚Äîtypically in the dry and early rainy tropical seasons‚Äîwhen the preferred fruits are unavailable. This alternate diet includes young leaves, insects, flowers, seeds, and bark; it is also known to eat small crabs, frogs and other creatures taken from the shorelines and mangroves when foraging in these environments.Cawthorn Long 2006; Walker & Molur 2003:29 Macaque populations which live in areas close to human settlements and farms frequently raid the croplands for food, and have even entered dwellings in search of sustenance if not actively discouraged by human presence. Like all primates, it is a social animal, and spends a good deal of time interacting and grooming with other group members. It typically forages for food in the morning, resting in groups during the midday hours and then a subsequent period of foraging in the early evening before returning to designated roosting trees to sleep for the night. It moves quadrupedally on the ground as well as in the canopy, and it is capable of leaping distances of up to from tree to tree. Like other long- tailed macaques, it is also a proficient swimmer and may use this ability when threatened to avoid arboreal or terrestrial predators. Conservation status Their conservation status as documented by the IUCN Red List is listed as vulnerable, having been amended in 2004 from the taxon's previous status as data deficient following some more extensive studies. This reflects the likely increase in disturbances to their habitat caused by human activities, in particular on the island of Katchal. The Wildlife Institute of India however registered their status in 2002 as critically endangered, reflecting also their concerns that conservation efforts with regards to a defined captive breeding programme were deficient.

A TPMS reports real-time tire-pressure information to the driver of the vehicle, either via a gauge, a pictogram display, or a simple low-pressure warning light. TPMS can be divided into two different types ‚Äì direct (dTPMS) and indirect (iTPMS). TPMS are provided both at an OEM (factory) level as well as an aftermarket solution. The goal of a TPMS is avoiding traffic accidents, poor fuel economy, and increased tire wear due to under-inflated tires through early recognition of a hazardous state of the tires. This functionality first appeared in luxury vehicles in Europe in the 1980s, while mass-market adoption followed the USA passing the 2000 TREAD Act after the Firestone and Ford tire controversy. Mandates for TPMS technology in new cars have continued to proliferate in the 21st century in Russia, the EU, Japan, South Korea and many other Asian countries. As of November 2014, fitment rate stands at 54% of passenger cars. History =Initial adoption= Due to the influence tire pressure has on vehicle safety and efficiency, tire-pressure monitoring (TPM) was first adopted by the European market as an optional feature for luxury passenger vehicles in the 1980s. The first passenger vehicle to adopt TPM was the Porsche 959 in 1986, using a hollow spoke wheel system developed by PSK. In 1996 Renault used the Michelin PAX system PAX system description on Michelinman site for the Scenic and in 1999 the PSA Peugeot Citro√´n decided to adopt TPM as a standard feature on the Peugeot 607. The following year (2000), Renault launched the Laguna II, the first high volume mid-size passenger vehicle in the world to be equipped with TPM as a standard feature. In the United States, TPM was introduced by General Motors for the 1991 model year for the Corvette in conjunction with Goodyear run-flat tires. The system uses sensors in the wheels and a driver display which can show tire pressure at any wheel, plus warnings for both high and low pressure. It has been standard on Corvettes ever since. =Firestone recall and legal mandates= The Firestone recall in the late 1990s (which was linked to more than 100 deaths from rollovers following tire tread-separation), pushed the United States Congress to legislate the TREAD Act. The Act mandated the use of a suitable TPMS technology in all light motor vehicles (under 10,000 pounds), to help alert drivers of under-inflation events. This act affects all light motor vehicles sold after September 1, 2007. Phase-in started in October 2005 at 20%, and reached 100% for models produced after September 2007. In the United States, as of 2008 and the European Union, as of November 1, 2012, all new passenger car models (M1) released must be equipped with a TPMS. From November 1, 2014, all new passenger cars sold in the European Union must be equipped with a TPMS. For N1 vehicles, TPMS are not mandatory, but if a TPMS is fitted, it must comply with the regulation. On July 13, 2010, the South Korean Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs announced a pending partial-revision to the Korea Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (KMVSS), specifying that \\"TPMS shall be installed to passenger vehicles and vehicles of GVW 3.5 tons or less, ... [effective] on January 1, 2013 for new models and on June 30, 2014 for existing models\\". Japan is expected to adopt European Union legislation approximately one year after European Union implementation. Further countries to make TPMS mandatory include Russia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Israel, Malaysia and Turkey. After the TREAD Act was passed, many companies responded to the market opportunity by releasing TPMS products using battery-powered radio transmitter wheel modules. =Run-flat tires= The introduction of run- flat tires and emergency spare tires by several tire and vehicle manufacturers has motivated to make at least some basic TPMS mandatory when using run-flat tires. With run-flat tires, the driver will most likely not notice that a tire is running flat, hence the so-called \\"run-flat warning systems\\" were introduced. These are most often first generation, purely roll-radius based iTPMS, which ensure that run-flat tires are not used beyond their limitations, usually 80 km/h (50 mph) and 80 km (50 miles) driving distance. The iTPMS market has progressed as well. Indirect TPMS are able to detect under- inflation through combined use of roll radius and spectrum analysis and hence four-wheel monitoring has become feasible. With this breakthrough, meeting the legal requirements is possible also with iTPMS.  Direct versus indirect  = Indirect TPMS = Indirect TPMS do not use physical pressure sensors but measure air pressures using software-based systems, which by evaluating and combining existing sensor signals like wheel speeds, accelerometers, driveline data, etc. estimate and monitor the tire pressure without physical pressure sensors in the wheels. First-generation iTPMS systems are based on the principle that under-inflated tires have a slightly smaller diameter (and hence higher angular velocity) than a correctly inflated one. These differences are measurable through the wheel speed sensors of ABS/ESC systems. Second generation iTPMS can also detect simultaneous under-inflation in up to all four tires using spectrum analysis of individual wheels, which can be realized in software using advanced signal processing techniques. iTPMS cannot measure or display absolute pressure values; they are relative by nature and have to be reset by the driver once the tires are checked and all pressures adjusted correctly. The reset is normally done either by a physical button or in a menu of the on-board computer. iTPMS are, compared to dTPMS, more sensitive to the influences of different tires and external influences like road surfaces and driving speed or style. The reset procedure, followed by an automatic learning phase of typically 20 to 60 minutes of driving under which the iTPMS learns and stores the reference parameters before it becomes fully active, cancels out many, but not all of these. As iTPMS do not involve any additional hardware, spare parts, electronic/toxic waste, or service (beyond the regular reset), they are regarded as easy to handle and customer friendly.http://www.elektronikpraxis.vogel.de/sensorik/articles/172243/ Reifendruck voll unter Kontrolle Since factory installation of TPMS became mandatory in November 2014 for all new passenger vehicles in the EU, various iTPMS have been type-approved according to UN Regulation R64. Examples for this are most of the VW group models, but also numerous Honda, Volvo, Opel, Ford, Mazda, PSA, FIAT and Renault models. iTPMS are quickly gaining market shares in the EU and are expected to become the dominating TPMS technology in the near future. iTPMS are regarded as less accurate by some due to their nature‚Äîgiven that simple ambient temperature variations can lead to pressure variations of the same magnitude as the legal detection thresholds‚Äî but many vehicle manufacturers and customers value the ease of use. = Direct TPMS = VDO A damaged direct TPMS sensor being removed Direct TPMS directly measures tire pressure using hardware sensors. In each wheel, most often on the inside of the valve, there is a battery-driven pressure sensor which transfers pressure information to a central control unit which reports it to the vehicle's onboard computer. Some units also measure and alert temperatures of the tire as well. These systems can identify under-inflation for each individual tire. Although the systems vary in transmitting options, many TPMS products (both OEM and aftermarket) can display realtime, individual tire pressures whether the vehicle is moving or parked. There are many different solutions, but all of them have to face the problems of exposure to hostile environments. The majority are powered by batteries which limit their useful life. Some sensors utilise a wireless power system similar to that used in RFID tag reading which solves the problem of limited battery life. This also increases the frequency of data transmission up to 40 Hz and reduces the sensor weight which can be important in motorsport applications. If the sensors are mounted on the outside of the wheel, as are some aftermarket systems, they are subject to mechanical damage, aggressive fluids, as well as theft. When mounted on the inside of the rim, they are no longer easily accessible for battery change and the RF link must overcome the attenuating effects of the tire which increases the energy need. A direct TPMS sensor consists of the following main functions requiring only a few external components ‚Äî e.g. battery, housing, PCB ‚Äî to get the sensor module that is mounted to the valve stem inside the tire: * pressure sensor; * analog-digital converter; * microcontroller; * system controller; * oscillator; * radio frequency transmitter; * low frequency receiver, and * voltage regulator (battery management). Most originally fitted dTPMS have the sensor mounted on the inside of the rim and the batteries are not exchangeable. A discharged battery means that the tire must be dismounted in order to replace it, so long battery life is desireable. To save energy and prolong battery life, many dTPMS sensors do not transmit information when parked (which eliminates spare tire monitoring) or apply a more expensive two-way communication which enables wake-up of the sensor. For OEM auto dTPMS units to work properly, they need to recognize the sensor positions and must ignore the signals from other vehicles. Aftermarket dTPMS units not only transmit while vehicles are moving or parked, but also provide users with some advanced monitoring options including data logging, remote monitoring options and more. They are available for all types of vehicles, from motorcycles to heavy equipment, and can monitor up to 64 tires at a time, which is important for commercial vehicles. Many aftermarket dTPMS units do not require specialized tools to program or reset, making them much simpler to use. Maintenance issues =Valve-stem corrosion= First-generation of TPMS sensors that are integral with the valve stem have suffered from corrosion. Metallic valve caps can become seized to the valve stem because of galvanic corrosion of dissimilar metals, and efforts to remove it can break the stem, destroying the sensor. A similar fate may befall an after-market brass valve core inside the stem that may have been installed by unwary technician, replacing the original specialized nickel- coated cores. (They can be distinguished by the yellowish colour of the brass.) Seizure of the valve can complicate repair of a tire leak, possibly requiring replacement of the entire sensor. =Tire sealant compatibility= There is controversy regarding the compatibility of after-market tire sealants with dTPMS that employ sensors mounted inside the tire. Some manufacturers of sealants assert that their products are indeed compatible, but others warned that the \\"sealant may come in contact with the sensor in a way that renders the sensor TEMPORARILY inoperable until it is properly cleaned, inspected and re-installed by a tire care professional\\". Such doubts are also reported by others. Use of such sealants may void the TPMS sensor warranty. Benefits of TPMS The dynamic behavior of a pneumatic tire is closely connected to its inflation pressure. Key factors like braking distance and lateral stability require the inflation pressures to be adjusted and kept as specified by the vehicle manufacturer. Extreme under-inflation can even lead to thermal and mechanical overload caused by overheating and subsequent, sudden destruction of the tire itself. Additionally, fuel efficiency and tire wear are severely affected by under-inflation. Tires do not only leak air if punctured, they also leak air naturally, and over a year, even a typical new, properly mounted tire can lose from 20 to 60 kPa (3 to 9 psi), roughly 10% or even more of its initial pressure. The significant advantages of TPMS are summarized as follows: * Fuel savings: According to the GITI, for every 10% of under- inflation on each tire on a vehicle, a 1% reduction in fuel economy will occur. In the United States alone, the Department of Transportation estimates that under inflated tires waste of fuel each year. * Extended tire life: Under inflated tires are the number one cause of tire failure and contribute to tire disintegration, heat buildup, ply separation and sidewall/casing breakdowns. Further, a difference of in pressure on a set of duals literally drags the lower pressured tire 2.5 metres per kilometre (13 feet per mile). Moreover, running a tire even briefly on inadequate pressure breaks down the casing and prevents the ability to retread. It is important to note that not all sudden tire failures are caused by under-inflation. Structural damages caused, for example, by hitting sharp curbs or potholes, can also lead to sudden tire failures, even a certain time after the damaging incident. These cannot be proactively detected by any TPMS. * Improved safety: Under-inflated tires lead to tread separation and tire failure, resulting in 40,000 accidents, 33,000 injuries and over 650 deaths per year. Further, tires properly inflated add greater stability, handling and braking efficiencies and provide greater safety for the driver, the vehicle, the loads and others on the road. * Environmental efficiency: Under-inflated tires, as estimated by the US Department of Transportation, release over 26 billion kilograms (57.5 billion pounds) of unnecessary carbon-monoxide pollutants into the atmosphere each year in the United States alone. Further statistics include: The French S√©curit√© Routi√®re, a road safety organization, estimates that 9% of all road accidents involving fatalities are attributable to tire under-inflation, and the German DEKRA, a product safety organization, estimated that 41% of accidents with physical injuries are linked to tire problems. The European Union reports that an average under-inflation of 40 kPa produces an increase of fuel consumption of 2% and a decrease of tire life of 25%. The European Union concludes that tire under-inflation today is responsible for over 20 million liters of unnecessarily-burned fuel, dumping over 2 million tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere, and for 200 million tires being prematurely wasted worldwide. In 2018, a field study on TPMS and tire inflation pressure was published on the UN ECE Working Party on Brakes and Running Gear (GRRF) homepage.https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/doc/2018/wp29grrf/GRRF-86-17e.pdf It covered 1,470 randomly selected vehicles in three EU countries with dTPMS, iTPMS and without TPMS. Main findings are that TPMS fitment reliably prevents severe and dangerous underinflation and hence yields the desired effects for traffic safety, fuel consumption and emissions. The study also showed that there is no difference in effectiveness between dTPMS and iTPMS and that the TPMS reset function does not present a safety risk.  Privacy concerns with direct TPMS  Because each tire transmits a unique identifier, vehicles may be easily tracked using existing sensors along the roadway. This concern could be addressed by encrypting the radio communications from the sensors but such privacy provisions were not stipulated by the NHTSA. Heavy-duty vehicles U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration regulations49 CFR, Ch. V., FMVSS No. 138, 2006 only apply to vehicles under 10,000 pounds. For heavy-duty vehicles (Classes 7 and 8, gross vehicle weight greater than 26,000 pounds), most of the above-mentioned systems don't work well, requiring the development of other systems. The US Department of Transportation has commissioned several studies to find systems that work on the heavy-duty market specifying some goals that were needed in this market. The SAE has tried to disseminate best practices since legal regulations for heavy vehicles has been lagging.Daniel, S. 2005. Status of TPMS Rulemaking, SAE Government/Industry Meeting - May 10, 2005 One problem is lack of standardization. Tires are often purchased in bulk and moved between tractors over time, so a given TPMS system can only work with compatible sensors in the tires, creating logistic problems. RF systems for these units must also work over much longer ranges, which may force repeater systems to be installed on the tractor or trailer. It is expected that battery lives on these systems should be in the five- to seven-year range, since the cost of breaking down a tire can be so much more expensive. The U.S. Department of Transportation's maximum-loading requirements force trailer manufacturers to spread loads over multiple axles, giving rise to trailers with typically 8 to 12 tires, but as many as 96 tires on specialty haulers. Tire casings can have typical lifetimes of ten or more years, through multiple retreading processes. This has given rise to a specialized industry that focuses solely on issues found in the trucking industry. Central inflation systems originally claimed to eliminate the need for pressure- monitoring systems. Some major inflation systems are Meritor PSI, Hendrickson International, Stemco AERIS and Vagia (used mostly in South America). They have not yielded a complete solution, since they do not solve all the issues (i.e., no support for the steerable axle), and they bring new issues with maintenance of the rotary couplings in the hub caps. Inflation systems can sometimes shorten the life of tires by concealing slow leaks caused by embedded objects, which drivers would otherwise remove after inspecting the problem tire. For a tire-pressure sensor to be completely effective, it must have several capabilities to allow for the various maintenance personnel groups to use them. First, each driver is required to do a pre-trip inspection, so it is beneficial if the tire-pressure monitor has an indicator that can be read without tools. Second, it usually should have the ability to cover dual sets of tires in some fashion. It is also beneficial if the fill points can be centralized so that inflation can be accomplished easily without reaching through the small hand holes in the rims. Third, it needs to have a wireless communication system that has an appropriate range and battery life. It is important that sensors regularly communicate an \\"I'm alive\\" condition, since having a dead sensor can be worse than having no sensor at all. Fourth, these systems should have the capability to adapt to the changing of tires and trailers with minimal operator intervention. It is important to use a system having a longer range, since a repeater increases cost. These requirements can be met by systems with external pressure sensors that connect to the valve stem on each tire. When tires are replaced, the sensor is moved to the new tire. Although these systems can alert a driver to a hazardous blowout condition, they may not help fleets deal with slow-leaking tires, unless the driver reports them to fleet-maintenance personnel before it is too late. This has given rise in recent years to monitoring solutions that track the tire condition and send alerts to fleet-maintenance personnel. This allows them to schedule maintenance on a slow-leaking tire on an exception basis, instead of having to check each tire manually. Many fleets today admit that tire-pressure checking is a major problem in enforcement. Most have policies in place requiring the regular check of every tire, however, the practice is not terribly effective because of the sheer scope of the issue, and the fact that it is hard to get a complete record of all tire checking. Today, the best systems employ automated data collection. Some of these use gate readers that automate the collection of tire data to a database, or to a web portal, that allows maintenance operators to see data for the entire fleet at a glance. For long-haul fleets that may not see their vehicles for long periods of time, a centralized reading system may not work, but there are emerging systems that aggregate the tire-pressure-sensor data back to the asset-tracking system so that alerts can be sent back to the main office when an issue arises. For small fleets, handheld devices exist that allow a person checking tires to simply walk around vehicles and collect data for downloading to a central database, allowing enforcement and trending to be done without errors. Some automotive manufacturers have attempted to broaden their scope into the heavy- duty markets, a few manufacturers have focused solely on this market.

Established in 1986, the college currently caters for approximately 800 students in Year 7 through to Year 12.  History  Nazareth was established in 1986 through the collaboration of four local parish primary-level schools: St Elizabeth's in Noble Park North, St Gerard's in Dandenong North, St Justin's in Wheelers Hill and St Simon's in Rowville. At the time, it was seen that there was a need for a local regional college following the Catholic tradition and hence, Nazareth College was formed to cater to students from the four parishes. A majority of the students at Nazareth College are graduates of one of the parish schools listed above. Nazareth college has a day to celebrate the school called \\"Naz Day\\" in September. Each pastoral room hosts an activity and hires food trucks or a ride. For the whole school day, the school is transformed into a fun fair. Toward the end, around 1:00, founding members return to the school for a full assembly and give a speech. Then the school talent show, consisting mostly of musical performances, begins. After that, school is dismissed. Nazareth College's past principals have been: *Paul D'Astoli (1986‚Äì1996) *Gregory Clarke (1997‚Äì2006) *Anne McDonald (2007‚Äì2016) *Sam Cosentino (2017‚Äìpresent)  Structure  Nazareth College comprises a Middle School and Senior School. Middle School caters for the students in Years 7-9 and the Senior School caters for the students in 10-12. In the Middle School, students must complete the core subjects (subjects compulsory to all students including English, Science, Mathematics, Arts, Technology, and a Language subject) such as English, Mathematics, etc. At Year 9, students are given the opportunity to select subjects including a language (either Italian or Japanese) and a variety of other subjects. In the Senior School, focus is placed upon the completion of the primarily academic VCE, or the more trade orientated VCAL. Academics Nazareth College senior students study for the Victorian Certificate of Education (Nazareth does not offer the International Baccalaureate), achieved after graduating from Year 12. While this is usually undertaken over a period of two years the school recently instituted an acceleration program that allows gifted students to do, at most, one Year 11 subject in Year 10. A Monash University bursary is also awarded to the top student in Year 11 at each campus to help pay for the cost of Year 12 studies. International students Nazareth College has fostered a large international student program, with at least twenty international students studying in each of Years 11 & 12, these students come from primarily China, Japan and Vietnam. To continue to foster its international links the school regularly hosts students from overseas to study at Nazareth College.  Student leadership  Students of every age have the opportunity to take up a position of leadership. Students may become a Class Captain or SRC (Years 7 - 11), a House Captain (Years 8, 10 and 12) and Middle School Captain (Year 9). In Year 12, students have a variety of leadership opportunities: There are 12 positions on the Student Representative Council (SRC); 4 House Captain positions, 4 Arts Captain positions & 4 College Captain positions. These captain positions are broken up into: *College Captain (2 people) *College Vice-Captain (2 people) *House Captains (12 people, 2 for each house) Notable alumni *Joanne Accom, dance, pop singer-songwriter and ARIA award winner *Jonathon Patton, AFL player for and the number 1 draft pick in 2011 See also * List of high schools in Victoria * List of schools in Victoria, Australia * Victorian Certificate of Education References External links * Category:Gippsland Independent Schools Category:Educational institutions established in 1986 Category:Catholic secondary schools in Melbourne Category:1986 establishments in Australia ","title":"Nazareth College (Australia)"},{"id":"3685002","text":"The Piano Trio No. 2 in E minor, for violin, cello and piano, Op. 67, by Dmitri Shostakovich was written in 1944, during World War II.

It is used in medicine for treating certain cancers of the islets of Langerhans and used in medical research to produce an animal model for hyperglycemia and Alzheimer's in a large dose, as well as type 2 diabetes or type 1 diabetes with multiple low doses. Usage Streptozotocin is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating metastatic cancer of the pancreatic islet cells. Since it carries a substantial risk of toxicity and rarely cures the cancer, its use is generally limited to patients whose cancer cannot be removed by surgery. In these patients, streptozotocin can reduce the tumor size and reduce symptoms (especially hypoglycemia due to excessive insulin secretion by insulinomas). A typical dose is 500 mg/m2/day by intravenous injection, for 5 days, repeated every 4‚Äì6 weeks. Due to its high toxicity to beta cells, in scientific research, streptozotocin has also been long used for inducing insulitis and diabetes on experimental animals. Streptozotocin has also been used for modeling Alzheimer's disease through memory loss in mice. Mechanism Streptozotocin is a glucosamine-nitrosourea compound. As with other alkylating agents in the nitrosourea class, it is toxic to cells by causing damage to the DNA, though other mechanisms may also contribute. DNA damage induces activation of PARP which is likely more important for diabetes induction than the DNA damage itself. Streptozotocin is similar enough to glucose to be transported into the cell by the glucose transport protein GLUT2, but is not recognized by the other glucose transporters. This explains its relative toxicity to beta cells, since these cells have relatively high levels of GLUT2. History Streptozotocin was originally identified in the late 1950s as an antibiotic. The drug was discovered in a strain of the soil microbe Streptomyces achromogenes by scientists at the drug company Upjohn (now part of Pfizer) in Kalamazoo, Michigan. The soil sample in which the microbe turned up had been taken from Blue Rapids, Kansas, which can therefore be considered the birthplace of streptozotocin. Upjohn filed for patent protection for the drug in August 1958 and was granted in March 1962. Recent advancements in understanding the biosynthesis of this natural product have been made by Balskus et al. In short, the authors found the gene cluster responsible for production of Streptozotocin in Streptomyces achromogenes and identified novel function of a non-heme iron enzyme, SznF, which forms the N-N bond in the N-nitrosourea pharmacophore by oxidative rearrangement. In the mid-1960s, streptozotocin was found to be selectively toxic to the beta cells of the pancreatic islets, the cells that normally regulate blood glucose levels by producing the hormone insulin. This suggested the drug's use as an animal model of diabetes, and as a medical treatment for cancers of the beta cells. In the 1960s and 1970s, the National Cancer Institute investigated streptozotocin's use in cancer chemotherapy. Upjohn filed for FDA approval of streptozotocin as a treatment for pancreatic islet cell cancer in November 1976, and approval was granted in July 1982. The drug was subsequently marketed as Zanosar. Streptozotocin is now long off patent and many generic formulations are available.

S√∏sterkirkene p√• Granavollen (Norske Kirkebygg) History According to local folklore, the churches were commissioned by two sisters who had fallen out and therefore would not be seen in the same church. It is, however, not uncommon for medieval churches with different functions to be built close to one another.  Nikolaikirken  The larger of the churches is called Nikolaikirken (St. Nicholas Church). This church probably acted as a church for Hadeland rural parish and can seat around 250 people. Because of later rebuilding it is difficult to establish an exact date of construction. Based on stylistic evidence, however, it is thought that the church was built sometime between 1150 and 1200. The church is built as a basilica church with solid Roman columns and plastered walls. Much of the original interior has been lost in fires and in subsequent rebuilding. More disappeared from the church during the modernization of the 1860s. Originally, the tower had a high spire, but it disappeared by a fire in 1799. The choir was changed by development in the 13th century.  Mariakirken  The smaller of the churches is Mariakirken (St. Mary Church), a single nave church, which either acted as a monastic church or a church for the local Gran parish. It was built sometime before 1150, and contains Romanesque and Gothic elements. A fire in 1813 gutted the church and it was not rebuilt until 1859. Until recently it was used as a chapel, but is now open for normal services. It can seat around 150 people. The church was restored in 1912-15 and in 1990-92.  Churchyard  In the south-eastern part of the churchyard there is a medieval stone tower, Klokket√•rnet, the original function of which is unknown. It is possible that the tower, which from the mid-19th century was used as a bell-tower, was originally used as a defence tower or refuge. The 11th century Granavollen Runestone can be found behind Nikolaikirken. The towers of the S√∏sterkirkene form the base coat of arms to Gran municipality. Noted poet and journalist, Aasmund Olafsson Vinje, is buried in the cemetery of S√∏sterkirkene. A monument with a bust of Vinjes by sculptor Brynjulf Bergslien was erected at the site.

He was also a member of the Orange Order in Canada. Born in Sussex, England, he emigrated in the 1820s to Virginia. He later moved to Ancaster in Upper Canada, where he founded his first local paper, The Gore Gazette, and finally to York in 1829, where he founded the Tory paper The Courier of Upper Canada. He sold The Courier in 1837. When York was incorporated in May 1834 as the city of Toronto, Gurnett was elected to the city council as the representative for St. George's Ward. During his 17 years on the city council he served as mayor four times, in 1837, 1848, 1849, and 1850. Due to his long service on council and his years as mayor he is often considered to be one of the founders of the city of Toronto. Gurnett held many positions while on Council. In 1837 he was appointed as the city's first Tory mayor, as magistrate of the Home District, and district clerk of the peace. He held positions on committees that dealt with harbour and wharves, gas and waterworks, and education. He was chairman of the board of health during the 1847 typhus epidemic Gurnett resigned from the city council at the end of 1850, after having been appointed the first police magistrate of Toronto.

He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Haltemprice in the East Riding of Yorkshire and subsequently for Beverley. He was a leading figure in the Conservative Monday Club, and a parliamentary consultant to the Western Goals Institute. In the last decade of his life, he was President of the British UFO Research Association (BUFORA). Education and military career The son of Henry Benedict Wall, Patrick Wall was educated at Downside School. He was commissioned into the Royal Marines in 1935 and qualified as a naval gunnery instructor. During the Second World War, he served in the Iron Duke, Valiant, and Malaya, followed by a spell at HMS Turtle, the landing craft base. In 1945, he was patrol officer and second-in- command 48 Commando RM in the British Army on the Rhine, where he was wounded. Wall's exploits in action drew the highest commendation: \\"An outstanding character whose industry and devotion to duty are beyond praise. He is a very devout man, and draws real inspiration from his Roman Catholic religion. In battle and behind the line, he is an example of energy and the aggressive spirit. His aim appears to be to do as much as possible\\", stated his report. He was awarded the Military Cross in the North-West Europe campaign, and was awarded the US Legion of Merit the same year, for his services during the invasion operations in northern Italy and the south of France. He taught at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich in 1946, and the Joint Services Staff College from 1947 to 1948. He spent a further two years on the staff of the Commandant-General, RM. He was promoted to the rank of major in 1949, and decided to leave the Royal Marines the following year in order to enter politics. He continued his naval connection as Commander of 47 Commando Royal Marines Voluntary Reserve from 1951 to 1957, and from 1950 to 1966, was Commissioner of the Sea Scouts for London. In 1953, Wall married Sheila Elizabeth, daughter of James Putnam, of Broadstone, Dorset. Political career Wall was a councillor on the City of Westminster Council from 1953 to 1963. In the 1951 General Election and a subsequent by-election in 1952, he stood unsuccessfully for the parliamentary seat of Cleveland, Yorkshire. He was later elected Conservative Party Member of Parliament for Haltemprice 1954‚Äì1983, and for Beverley, Yorkshire 1983‚Äì1987. He was Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food 1955‚Äì57, and to the Chancellor of the Exchequer 1958‚Äì59. He was UK delegate to the United Nations General Assembly in 1962, Vice-Chairman of the Parliamentary Select Committee on Defence 1965‚Äì1977, Chairman of the British-South Africa Parliamentary Group 1970‚Äì1987, on the British-Portuguese Parliamentary Group 1979‚Äì1987, and leader of the British delegation to the North Atlantic Assembly 1979‚Äì1987, of which he was President, 1983‚Äì1985. In February 1972, in the House of Commons he called for government intervention in the miners' strike, saying that \\"initimidation and even violence by picketing miners has given rise to widespread anxiety\\". During the Thatcher years, Wall reflected that Britain had \\"moved rapidly to the Left under Labour governments, and more slowly to the Left under successive Conservative governments\\". During this period, he sat on numerous parliamentary committees, one of which recommended building a strategic airfield in the Falkland Islands after the war. Views on Africa and communism Wall chaired several party committees concerned with Africa. He defended the British colonial record and was convinced of the benefits of white rule in Rhodesia and South Africa. In 1960, he claimed that the colonial problem arose not from differences in colour, but from differences in standards. \\"What we have to do is to work as hard as we can by raising the standards of the black Africans to ensure that we level up and do not take the easy way out by levelling down. Progress in Central Africa depends on the maintenance of standards and I believe we owe it, not only to our kith and kin, but to the vast mass of as yet uneducated black Africans for whom we are trustees, to see that the existing standards in Central Africa are not debased.\\" (cf. Reeves, p. 116). He was a friend of the Rhodesian Prime Minister, Ian Smith, and fully supported him. After Rhodesia's UDI in 1965, he joined forces with Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 5th Marquess of Salisbury, to lead the Tory revolt against their party's support for the Labour administration's sanctions policy. Wall believed that white rule in Southern Africa was the last bulwark against the spread of communism in the region, which he described as \\"this evil virus\\". He argued that this, in turn, would mean that the West would lose vital mineral supplies and that the oil route round the Cape would come under threat. In 1974, Wall attacked the Labour government's pull-out from the Simonstown naval base in South Africa, and stated in the House of Commons that \\"they\\" (the government) \\"must be insane. This is the only link NATO has with the Cape. British interests in Africa as a strategic part of the world should be maintained.\\" In 1975, writing in the journal To The Point, Patrick Wall said \\"the basic philosophy of the Communist powers is to detach Southern Africa from the Western World.\\" A committed supporter of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), he was leader of the British delegation to the North Atlantic Assembly from 1979 to 1987. Wall was especially suspicious of the Foreign Office, which he believed had contributed to Britain's decline. He would quote an African minister's remark: \\"We never trust you British because you never protect your own tribe.\\" Monday Club Wall was an early member (1963) of the Conservative Monday Club, sat on several of its committees, served on its Executive Council, and was National Club Chairman 1978‚Äì80. He collaborated on many papers and publications for the Club, and spoke for Club policies and concerns in the House of Commons. On May Day 1970, the Club held a 'Law and Liberty' rally in Trafalgar Square where he, and several other of the Club's MPs were principal speakers. In November 1971, he and John Biggs-Davison, joined, as observers, British troops in action in Northern Ireland against the Irish Republican Army (IRA). As University Groups Parliamentary Liaison Officer, he was active in supporting the 55 Monday Club groups formed in universities and colleges. He became a target for the Left and was denounced by the Marxist-led National Union of Students. In 1968, he was attacked at Leeds University and Mrs. Wall was knocked to the ground and kicked. Speaking at Portsmouth Polytechnic in December 1972, his meeting was broken up by a shouting group of students who pelted Wall with missiles. In May 1974, Wall, John Biggs-Davison, and Robert Taylor tabled a motion in the House of Commons deploring the Labour government's decision to cancel the visit of the Royal Yacht Britannia to Cape Town, describing it as \\"vindictive and selective spite.\\" In August Commander Anthony Courtney and Wall issued a Monday Club Paper attacking the \\"high proportion of official Communist representatives in London, who are known to be engaged in 'legal' espionage under diplomatic cover.\\" They warned also that Britain would become increasingly vulnerable following the opening of a Soviet Embassy in Dublin as the IRA was Marxist. In a letter published in the Daily Telegraph in November 1974, Patrick Wall wrote \\"Conservatism has lost millions of votes because the man in the street no longer believes that they stand primarily for Britain's interests.\\" He added: \\"to the man in the street the Conservative leadership has been more intent on crushing the Rhodesians than the IRA; more interested in the Ugandan Asians than in maintaining the rights of Britons living abroad; more worried about Enoch Powell than Messrs. Hugh Scanlon and Arthur Scargill\\". Wall was presented with a Fellowship Certificate of the Chartered Institute of Journalists at a formal reception for the occasion, held at the National Liberal Club, London, on Wednesday 12 July 1989. Connection to offshore and citizens' band (CB) radio Wall was one of a number of Tory MPs associated with Radio 270, an offshore radio station broadcasting off the Yorkshire coast in the 1960s. On 11 May 1967 the station gave Conservative candidates in local elections at Scarborough airtime which the candidates had paid for themselves, and on 14 May it broadcast a programme made by the York University branch of the Monday Club, in which Wall spoke on Rhodesia. Labour MP Andrew Faulds called (perhaps not entirely seriously) for the results of some municipal elections to be declared invalid because an \\"illegal broadcast\\" had been made, and Postmaster-General Edward Short stated that \\"It is the first time in peacetime that this country has been subjected to a stream of misleading propaganda from outside our territorial waters and I do not think this is a matter for joking\\". (ref. The Times, 12 and 15 May 1967) Shortly before the Marine Broadcasting Offences Act became law later that year, Radio 270 carried a broadcast, also sponsored by the University of York Monday Club, attacking the government for closing down the pirate stations. Wall, Ronald Bell and John Biggs-Davison, all prominent members of the Monday Club, took part. John Biggs-Davison stated that he felt that many Labour supporters would also regret the Act, claiming that \\"concern for freedom is not confined to one party and a voice of freedom will have been silenced when Radio 270 goes off the air\\". Wall said that \\"I think it is monstrous that private enterprise radio stations are being closed, and even more monstrous that the Government are not setting up an adequate alternative to cater for the amusement that many people want to hear. Indeed, I have had more letters on this subject than on any other in the 13 years I have been MP for Haltemprice\\". (ref. The Times, 11 August 1967) Eventually, the Tory party would bring about deregulation of the media (through the Broadcasting Act 1990) such as was being called for. From 1976 until its success in 1981, Wall was also a strong supporter of the campaign for the legalisation of Citizens' Band Radio in the UK, and was one of the most influential members of the House of Commons ad hoc Committee on CB.

Adults are medium- sized to small and usually have mainly dark body and leg colours. Males congregate in characteristic dancing swarms beneath trees; females are more retiring in habit. Larvae are characterised by their flattened bodies with striking lateral protuberances, and live as scavengers in various kinds of decaying organic matter. The lesser housefly Fannia canicularis is a worldwide synanthropic species. Fanniidae are indicators useful in forensic entomology. Identifying characteristics The Fanniidae were once a subfamily of Muscidae from which they may be distinguished by: *A (strictly) dorsal bristle is on the hind tibia below the middle and in addition to the dorsal preapical. *The axillary vein is strongly curved towards the wingtip, so if extended, the axillary and anal veins would meet before reaching the wing tip. *In males, the middle tibia has an erect pubescence beneath; in females, the frontalia is without crossed bristles, the frontal orbits are broad, and convex towards median line of frons, and two pairs of strong upper orbital bristles are present, with the anterior pair turned outwards.

He released a follow-up album, Girls of the Future, in 1981, although it was not as successful. After a few years without a new album, Anthem dropped Gabor from its roster. He subsequently moved to Vancouver, British Columbia (estranging himself from his wife and son in the process), where he attempted to revive his career by working with producer Todd Rundgren, at Rundgren's compound in Woodstock, New York in 1985. These sessions, however, did not result in a new album, and he eventually moved back to Toronto. On January 17, 1990, Gabor's body was found by police at his Toronto apartment. His death was ruled a suicide. Both of his Anthem albums were re-released on a single CD by the Canadian record label Pacemaker Entertainment in 2001. While Ralph Alfonso was helping Pacemaker with the CD, he asked Gabor's widow if she knew what had happened with the Rundgren sessions, and she brought out some cassettes which were only marked \\"Produced by Todd Rundgren.\\" Alfonso mastered the instrumental \\"Celtic Cross\\" directly from one of these cassettes and included it on the 2002 compilation CD Driving in the Rain:3 AM - Songs to Get Lost With on his Bongo Beat label. In the liner notes, he notes that the song might not actually be a Rundgren production. Discography * BB Gabor (1980) * Girls of the Future (1981) References External links * B.B.

It was the botanist Arthur Tansley who pleaded for organised nature conservation on the double ground of scientific value and beauty. He had advanced the concept of the ecosystem in 1935, and a number of key ideas of relevance to nature conservation stem from this. In the immediate post-war years, he hoped for an 'Ecological Research Council', and a 'National Wildlife Service'. In this context, the idea of national standards of conservation management can be traced to the formation of the Nature Conservancy Council (NCC), and its great survey of habitats and species, the Nature Conservation Review, published in 1977. From this time there was general agreement that the common purpose of conservation management systems was to transform situations of ecological confrontation between humans and non-humans into a system of mutual accommodation. The NCC's first guidelines for managing its national resource was a pro forma to accommodate a description of the site, the goals of management, and a prescriptive section, in which the objectives of management were to be interpreted in a practical manner. Central to the latter section were lists of codified jobs to help wardens abide by best practice. The major shortcoming of the guidelines was the lack of a business philosophy to track value for the inputs of effort and resources. Britain's first proper conservation management system (CMS), which tied objectives to practical interventions with feedback from monitoring outcomes, coalesced around Mike Alexander (Warden of Skomer Island National Nature Reserve), Tim Read (staff member of the Joint Nature Conservation Committee) and James Perrins (an environmental/IT graduate of York University). This initiative in the 1980s led to the setting up of the CMS Consortium by the UK's main conservation agencies, which produced a relational database for linking management objectives with scheduled on-site operational inputs. See the CMS website for more information. The database recorded all actions, particularly the results of monitoring against performance indicators. Over the years the software has improved greatly with respect to the user/screen interface, but the data model is still very much the same as in the original programme, which was produced with 'Advanced Revelation' (Arev). Although the NCC has been replaced by four country agencies, in terms of the widespread uptake of the CMS across the UK, the current version, mounted on MS Access, is now, de facto, a national conservation management system. As its use becomes more widespread CMS plans are beginning to function as an evidence-based library of best practice for exchanging practical know- how between users. Data model of a conservation management system (CMS) A CMS is simply a recording and filing tool that aids and improves the way in which heritage green assets are managed and kept in a favourable condition. Its prime function is to keep track of the inputs, outputs and outcomes of projects to meet measurable objectives. The aim is to promote efficient and effective operations, and allow recording of the work that was done and reporting on whether or not the objective was achieved. A CMS also enables the exchange of information about methods and achievements within and between organisations. These are essential components of a CMS of any scale, whether a national park, or a village pond. > Technically, a CMS is a project-based planning and recording system aimed at > managing conservation features within acceptable limits of variation. A > feature is any component of the environment that has to be managed e.g. a > footpath or a species. A 'project' is simply a programme of work leading to > an output e.g. 'construct a footpath', 'patrol an area' or 'record a > species'. Projects are work plans that control specific factors that help or > impede the attainment of management objectives. Each project includes a > description of a process, e.g. the work to be done, when and where it is to > be done and the inputs of resources required. When a project is completed, > what was actually done is recorded. This is an output. The outcome of a CMS > is the state of the feature at the end of the project and is measured by > performance indicators. Performance indicators are quantitative or > qualitative attributes of the features e.g. numbers of a species, and they > are measured by special monitoring-projects in order to gauge success in > reaching the management objectives. Copies of all projects with their > inputs, outputs and outcomes are retained in the CMS to provide a progress- > register, and an archive to support managerial continuity. In summary, the prime function of a CMS is to enable conservation managers to control the operational functions of a management plan as a feedback system or work-cycle by: *identifying and describing, in a standard way, all the tasks required to control the key factors (positive or negative), which influence the condition of the features, and thereby maintain the features in a favourable condition; *producing and budgeting various work programmes to control the factors, for example, five-year plans, rolling- plans, annual schedules, financial schedules, and work schedules for specified categories of staff; *providing a site/species monitoring system to check the effectiveness of the plan against the specified objectives; *facilitating the exchange of management information by reporting, within, and between, sites and organisations; *using feedback from monitoring to improve the management system. The sequence of identifying features, setting objectives, and then selecting the factors to be controlled by projects with scheduled work plans, comprises a management plan. The most effective way of organising a CMS is to assemble it as a set of interlinked forms as a relational database. However, it is also possible to operate a management plan with a spread sheet or a collection of hyperlinked 'to-do' lists. Planning cycle of a CMS Image:Datamodel.jpeg Scope of conservation management Conservation management implies the control of environmental and socioeconomic factors in order: *to make more efficient use of materials, *to recycle materials and energy that are vital to human survival, *to restore derelict land *and to maintain the capacity of ecosystems, which are the basis of all economies, to renew and grow. This is a vast area of applied science and technology, which is developing alongside new social attitudes towards the values of natural resources. Over the years, particularly at a governmental level, conservation management has come to focus on biological resources such as: *Agriculture and pastoralism *Fisheries *Forestry *Water *Tourism and recreation *Wildlife *Genetic resources From this perspective the aim is to foster attitudes in community and industry to the use of biological resources, changing from the 'maximum yield' approach to one of ecologically sustainable yield. This new attitude recognises the need for conservation of biodiversity and maintenance of ecological integrity. Since the first Global Environment Summit in 1992, national strategies are now commonly in place to integrate regimes of conservation management within and between industry sectors and communities to meet appropriate environmental, economic and social objectives. The practical aim is now to turn these strategies into operational systems and so balance exploitative management of natural resources with their conservation management. The goal is to provide the principles and tools to soften the clash between Earth's ability to sustain life and the character of its human occupancy. This means developing methods for biological conservation management alongside softer technological organisations for production (natural economy) and 'green' legislative actions for the organisation of people for production (political economy). The global educational topic- framework, which links conservation management with exploitative management, has been defined as 'cultural ecology'. It is within this area of knowledge that conservation management systems can be seen to require more than the scientific input of conservation biology. The essential feature of conservation management programmes is that they are part of the linkages between environmental, social and economic progress; between peace and security; between productivity of environment and community; and between sustainability and the renewal and extension of democracy. This is a roundabout way of saying that conservation management is about working on behalf of the wild to restore a culture, where people live and think as if they were totally engaged with their place on the planet for the long future. Fundamental scientific questions It is commonplace to hear conservation managers stress that they are really naturalists who do their best to apply good science to ecosystems that are unique in each case history. No two nature sites share the same history and factors limiting their biodiversity. They will differ with respect to time lags and non-linear responses to a given intervention. From this point of view conservation systems have much in common with the management systems of farmers and gardeners with regards uncertainties of the effects of inputs. Because of the internal complexity of ecosystems, science has yet to answer fundamental questions that were posed by Darwin regarding the factors that control relative abundance of species, with respect to space, time, pattern, food chains and population dynamics. Every nature reserve is likely to have some or all of the following questions unanswered. They are fundamental questions in ecological science that underpin all conservation management systems. *How do organisms change with space? **What constitutes and adequate size and shape of a reserve? *How do organisms change with time? **To what extent is the site a successional process? *How do organisms exist in patterns? **How many states or 'ways to be' are there for a particular compositional state of a habitat? *How do organisms exist in food chains? **What is the importance of keystone resources in maintaining community structure? *How do organisms exist in populations? **What is a sustainable population size for a particular species? Answers to these questions are embedded in the management system. All environmental systems are open systems with throughputs of matter and energy whilst maintaining structure and permanence in the medium term. A conservation management system will become part of this ecosystem with linkages to several feedback mechanisms, some positive and some negative, so that feedback loops can be unpredictable. This situation makes it virtually impossible to map the system as a whole, and usually the feedback is only revealed as an unexpected response, once management has commenced. It is in this sense that a management plan can be considered as the first stage of a research project, and the plan is changed in response to its outcomes.

Some of its production models were in a streamlined casing. The firm's first plan was to develop spacesuit kit. The dot com crash in early 2000 prevented Cis-Lunar from financing mass production of the MK5 rebreather. The MK5 included design elements aimed at preventing system and mission failures. The word cis-lunar came from Latin and means \\"on this side of the moon\\" or \\"not beyond the moon\\", and may refer to the scuba sets described here, or it may refer generically to space travel or astronomy. In 2005, Poseidon, a Swedish diving equipment manufacturer that is a wholly owned subsidiary of DP Scandinavia, acquired Cis-Lunar's technology and retained its founder, Bill Stone of Stone Aerospace, to lead an international engineering team to design a new closed circuit rebreather, the Cis-Lunar Mark VI Discovery. The Cis-Lunar Mark VI rebreather employs many revolutionary design elements, such as discarding the customary three oxygen sensors and their voting logic in favor of a primary oxygen sensor with constant auto-cell validation and auto-calibration through the entire dive envelope, with a secondary oxygen sensor for redundancy. The Mark VI also uses a four computer design that correlates data over its digital communications network to its controlling resource algorithm to monitor such data like exact values, gas cylinder low or excessive consumption or metabolic rates, sensor values, calculated derivative sensor values, calculated response data values, etc. Bill Stone of Cis-Lunar and Richard Pyle have been interviewed by ScubaMagazine to explain the design philosophy behind the Mark VI and its operation; the interview was made available as a downloadable video.

It lies on the banks of the River Thames between the villages of Wolvercote to the east and Wytham to the west. The ruins of Godstow Abbey, also known as Godstow Nunnery, are here. A bridge spans the Thames and the Trout Inn is at the foot of the bridge across the river from the abbey ruins. There is also a weir and Godstow lock. History Godstow Abbey (see detailed history below) was built here, starting in 1133. It housed an order of Benedictine nuns. Rosamund Clifford, the mistress of King Henry II, retired here and died at 30. Her grave is somewhere in the grounds but now lost. The abbey was suppressed in 1539 under the Second Act of Dissolution. The abbey was then converted into Godstow House by George Owen. It was occupied by his family until 1645, when the building was badly damaged in the English Civil War. After this damage, the building fell into disrepair and was used by the locals as a source of stone for their buildings. This stone bridge was in existence in 1692 and an earlier one was probably that held by the Royalists against Parliamentarians in 1644, during the Civil War. Godstow House itself was fortified as part of the defences of Royalist Oxford against the Parliamentary army at the Siege of Oxford. By the Thames at Lower Wolvercote and Godstow is a 17th-century public house, The Trout Inn, close to Godstow Bridge. The bridge, in two spans, was built in 1792, the southern span being rebuilt in 1892. Godstow Lock was built here in 1790. In Victorian times, Charles Dodgson (aka Lewis Carroll) brought Alice Liddell (aka Alice in Wonderland) and her sisters, Edith and Lorina, for river trips and picnics at Godstow. The ruins of Godstow Abbey were used as a backdrop in the film Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again during the musical number \\"When I Kissed The Teacher\\". The Trout public house from Godstow bridge  History of Godstow Abbey  Godstow Abbey was built on what was then an island between streams running into the River Thames. The site was given to the founder Edith de Launceline, in 1133 by John of St. John Edith was the widow of William and she had been living alone in Binsey in Oxfordshire, before deciding to found a group of nuns. The abbey was built in local limestone in honour of St Mary and St John the Baptist for Benedictine nuns; with a further gift of land from him, the site was later enlarged. The church was consecrated in 1139. The Bishop of Lincoln confirms that it was Edith's money and will that created the community although she had enjoyed support from Henry I of England. The abbey was again enlarged between 1176 and 1188 when Henry II gave the establishment ¬£258 (which included ¬£100 for the church), 40,000 shingles, 4,000 laths, and a large quantity of timber. Because the abbey was the burial place of his mistress Rosamund Clifford, Henry, who received patronal rights from the nuns, paid special favour to the Abbey. In 1446 Alice Henley became the abbess and she served until 1470. She is remembered because a \\"poor brother and admirer\\" of the abbess created the \\"English Register\\". Its purpose was to explain the accounts, in English, to the nuns but it contained other descriptive material and today it illustrates \\"keeping and understanding records\\" in English in the 15th century. = Suppression of the Abbey = The last abbess was Lady Katherine Bulkeley, who had been elected in 1535 at the age of around 35. Katherine was one of three nuns whose promotion to the headship of rich nunneries in the mid 1530s had been engineered (or substantially supported) by Thomas Cromwell; all three having brothers who were closely allied to Cromwell, and who represented leading families in important localities. Katherine's brother, Sir Richard Bulkeley, was acting chamberlain for North Wales; and the Bulkeley family had long dominated Anglesey as constables of Beaumaris. Surviving letters from Katherine to Cromwell show her to have been a supporter of the reform of religious houses, while also sending him suitable gifts and delicacies. At the visitation of the monasteries of 1535, John Tregonwell commended the house, saying that all was well and in good order. But in late October 1538, the abbey at Godstow was visited by Cromwell's suppression commissioner, Dr John London who demanded access to the (enclosed) nuns to question them; and pressure them into leaving the religious life. What followed can be tracked in the letters that both Lady Katherine and John London then dispatched to Cromwell; the abbess alleging that Dr London and a body of his henchmen had been applying threats of force against her and her sisters to compel her surrender of the house, and were now refusing to leave until she had done so. Dr London's rejoinder was that it was Lady Katherine who had assaulted him and his party in the proper execution of their commission; she being supported by Thomas Powell, rector of Godstow and \\"naturally a rough fellow\\". Cromwell's letter in reply was sent back via Sir Richard Bulkeley, clearly supporting Lady Katherine. In response, Lady Katherine assured Cromwell that \\"there is neither pope nor purgatory, image nor pilgrimage nor praying to dead saints used or regarded amongst us.\\" But Cromwell was unable to stay the process of dissolution for ever; as it became clear that the King would not allow the continuation of any religious houses, however well run and reformed in religious life and practice. The abbey was suppressed in November 1539 under the Second Act of Dissolution; although Cromwell was able to ensure that Lady Katherine received a generous pension of fifty pounds a year. = Site = The site consisted of a guest house; a nunnery; an outer court containing a range of buildings; lodging for a priest; St Thomas's chapel, which appears to have been used as a church by the Abbey's servants; and the Abbey church, which contained cloisters along with associated buildings. The precincts were entered from the Wolvercote‚ÄìWytham road, which ran through the outer court. Here there was a two-storey main gatehouse with a large gate for carts and a second smaller one beside it for foot traffic. George Price Boyce, the Victorian watercolour painter associated with the Pre-Raphaelite art movement, visited and painted the nunnery in 1862.Godstow Nunnery, Oxfordshire by George Price Boyce, 1862. (Sold at Sotheby's, London, 2001.) During the 19th and 20th centuries, the ruined abbey was used for collecting livestock during the annual rounding up of animals on Port Meadow. =Rosamund Clifford's death and grave= The abbey was the final burial place of the famed beauty Rosamund Clifford (died c. 1176), a long-term mistress of Henry II. Henry's liaison with Rosamund became known throughout court in 1174; it ended when she retired to the nunnery at Godstow in 1176, shortly before her death. Henry and the Clifford family paid for her tomb in the choir of the convent's church at Godstow, and gave an endowment for it to be tended by the nuns. It became a popular local shrine until 1191, two years after Henry's death. Hugh of Lincoln, Bishop of Lincoln, while visiting Godstow, noticed Rosamund's tomb right in front of the high altar. The tomb was laden with flowers and candles, demonstrating that the local people were still praying there. Calling Rosamund a harlot, the bishop ordered her remains removed from the church. Her tomb was moved outside the abbey church to the cemetery at the nuns' chapter house next to it, where it could still be visited; but it was destroyed in the Dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry VIII. Paul Hentzner, a German traveller who visited England c.1599, records that her faded tombstone inscription read in part: > ... Adorent, Utque tibi detur requies Rosamunda precamur. > (\\"Let them adore ... and we pray that rest be given to you, Rosamund.\\") Followed by a punning epitaph: > Hic jacet in tumba Rosamundi non Rosamunda > Non redolet sed olet, quae redolere solet. > (\\"Here in the tomb lies a rose of the world, not a pure rose; She who used > to smell sweet, still smells ‚Äî but not sweet.\\") =Other burials= *Walter de Clifford (died 1190) *Walter de Clifford (died 1221) *Isabella de Braose Gallery File:Godstow Abbey ruins.jpgGodstow Abbey ruins from the east File:Godstow Nunnery ruin 20050326.jpgGodstow Abbey ruins from the south File:The window of Godstow Nunnery.

Before the printing press was invented, word of mouth was the primary source of news. Returning merchants, sailors and travelers brought news back to the mainland, and this was then picked up by pedlars and travelling players and spread from town to town. Ancient scribes often wrote this information down. This transmission of news was highly unreliable, and died out with the invention of the printing press. Newspapers (and to a lesser extent magazines) have always been the primary medium of journalists since the 18th century, radio and television in the 20th century, and the Internet in the 21st century.Shannon E. Martin and David A. Copeland, eds. \\"The Function of Newspapers in Society: A Global Perspective (Praeger, 2003) p. 2 Early and basic journalism =Europe= In 1556, the government of Venice first published the monthly Notizie scritte (\\"Written notices\\") which cost one gazzetta,Wan-Press.org , A Newspaper Timeline, World Association of Newspapers a Venetian coin of the time, the name of which eventually came to mean \\"newspaper\\". These avvisi were handwritten newsletters and used to convey political, military, and economic news quickly and efficiently throughout Europe, more specifically Italy, during the early modern era (1500-1800)‚Äîsharing some characteristics of newspapers though usually not considered true newspapers.Infelise, Mario. \\"Roman Avvisi: Information and Politics in the Seventeenth Century.\\" Court and Politics in Papal Rome, 1492-1700. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002. pp. 212, 214, 216-217. However, none of these publications fully met the modern criteria for proper newspapers, as they were typically not intended for the general public and restricted to a certain range of topics. Early publications played into the development of what would today be recognized as the newspaper, which came about around 1601. Around the 15th and 16th centuries, in England and France, long news accounts called \\"relations\\" were published; in Spain they were called \\"relaciones\\". Single event news publications were printed in the broadsheet format, which was often posted. These publications also appeared as pamphlets and small booklets (for longer narratives, often written in a letter format), often containing woodcut illustrations. Literacy rates were low in comparison to today, and these news publications were often read aloud (literacy and oral culture were, in a sense, existing side by side in this scenario).Carmen Espejo, \\"European communication networks in the early modern age: A new framework of interpretation for the birth of journalism.\\" Media history 17.2 (2011): 189-202. Relation from 1609, the earliest newspaper By 1400, businessmen in Italian and German cities were compiling hand written chronicles of important news events, and circulating them to their business connections. The idea of using a printing press for this material first appeared in Germany around 1600. The first gazettes appeared in German cities, notably the weekly Relation aller Fuernemmen und gedenckw√ºrdigen Historien (\\"Collection of all distinguished and memorable news\\") in Strasbourg starting in 1605. The Avisa Relation oder Zeitung was published in Wolfenb√ºttel from 1609, and gazettes soon were established in Frankfurt (1615), Berlin (1617) and Hamburg (1618). By 1650, 30 German cities had active gazettes.Thomas Schroeder, \\"The Origins of the German Press,\\" in The Politics of Information in Early Modern Europe edited by Brendan Dooley and Sabrina Baron. (2001) pp. 123-50, especially p. 123. A semi-yearly news chronicle, in Latin, the Mercurius Gallobelgicus, was published at Cologne between 1594 and 1635, but it was not the model for other publications. The news circulated between newsletters through well-established channels in 17th century Europe. Antwerp was the hub of two networks, one linking France, Britain, Germany, and the Netherlands; the other linking Italy Spain and Portugal. Favorite topics included wars, military affairs, diplomacy, and court business and gossip.Paul Arblaster, Posts, Newsletters, Newspapers: England in a European system of communications,\\" Media History (2005) 11#1-2, pp. 21-36. After 1600 the national governments in France and England began printing official newsletters.Carmen Espejo, \\"European Communication Networks in the Early Modern Age: A new framework of interpretation for the birth of journalism,\\" Media History (2011) 17#2, pp. 189-202. In 1622 the first English-language weekly magazine, \\"A current of General News\\" was published and distributed in England in an 8- to 24-page quarto format.  Revolutionary changes in the 19th century  Newspapers in all major countries became much more important in the 19th century because of a series of technical, business, political, and cultural changes. High-speed presses and cheap wood-based newsprint made large circulations possible. The rapid expansion of elementary education meant a vast increase in the number of potential readers. Political parties sponsored newspapers at the local and national level. Toward the end of the century, advertising became well-established and became the main source of revenue for newspaper owners. This led to a race to obtain the largest possible circulation, often followed by downplaying partisanship so that members of all parties would buy a paper. The number of newspapers in Europe in the 1860s and 1870s was steady at about 6,000; then it doubled to 12,000 in 1900. In the 1860s and 1870s, most newspapers were four pages of editorials, reprinted speeches, excerpts from novels and poetry and a few small local ads. They were expensive, and most readers went to a caf√© to look over the latest issue. There were major national papers in each capital city, such as the London Times, the London Post, the Paris Temps and so on. They were expensive and directed to the National political elite. Every decade the presses became faster, and the invention of automatic typesetting in the 1880s made feasible the overnight printing of a large morning newspaper. Cheap wood pulp replaced the much more expensive rag paper. A major cultural innovation was the professionalization of news gathering, handled by specialist reporters. Liberalism led to freedom of the press, and ended newspaper taxes, along with a sharp reduction to government censorship. Entrepreneurs interested in profit increasingly replaced politicians interested in shaping party positions, so there was dramatic outreach to a larger subscription base. The price fell to a penny. In New York, \\"Yellow Journalism\\" used sensationalism, comics (they were colored yellow), a strong emphasis on team sports, reduced coverage of political details and speeches, a new emphasis on crime, and a vastly expanded advertising section featuring especially major department stores. Women had previously been ignored, but now they were given multiple advice columns on family and household and fashion issues, and the advertising was increasingly pitched to them. Carlton J. H. Hayes, A Generation of Materialism, 1871-1900 (1941) pp 176-80.Rose F. Collins, and E. M. Palmegiano, eds. The Rise of Western Journalism 1815‚Äì1914: Essays on the Press in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Great Britain and the United States (2007) France =1632 to 1815= The first newspaper in France, the Gazette de France, was established in 1632 by the king's physician Theophrastus Renaudot (1586-1653), with the patronage of Louis XIII.G√©rard Jubert, P√®re des Journalistes et M√©decin des Pauvres (2008) All newspapers were subject to prepublication censorship, and served as instruments of propaganda for the monarchy. La Gazette, 26 December 1786 Under the ancien regime, the most prominent magazines were Mercure de France, Journal des s√ßavans, founded in 1665 for scientists, and Gazette de France, founded in 1631. Jean Loret was one of France's first journalists. He disseminated the weekly news of music, dance and Parisian society from 1650 until 1665 in verse, in what he called a gazette burlesque, assembled in three volumes of La Muse historique (1650, 1660, 1665). The French press lagged a generation behind the British, for they catered to the needs the aristocracy, while the newer British counterparts were oriented toward the middle and working classes.Stephen Botein, Jack R. Censer, and Harriet Ritvo, \\"The periodical press in eighteenth-century English and French society: a cross-cultural approach.\\" Comparative Studies in Society and History 23#3 (1981): 464-490. Periodicals were censored by the central government in Paris. They were not totally quiescent politically‚Äîoften they criticized Church abuses and bureaucratic ineptitude. They supported the monarchy and they played at most a small role in stimulating the revolution.Jack Censer, The French press in the age of Enlightenment (2002). During the Revolution new periodicals played central roles as propaganda organs for various factions. Jean-Paul Marat (1743‚Äì1793) was the most prominent editor. His L'Ami du peuple advocated vigorously for the rights of the lower classes against the enemies of the people Marat hated; it closed when he was assassinated. After 1800 Napoleon reimposed strict censorship.Robert Darnton and Daniel Roche, eds., Revolution in Print: the Press in France, 1775‚Äì1800 (1989). =1815 to 1914= Magazines flourished after Napoleon left in 1815. Most were based in Paris and most emphasized literature, poetry and stories. They served religious, cultural and political communities. In times of political crisis they expressed and helped shape the views of their readership and thereby were major elements in the changing political culture.Keith Michael Baker, et al., The French Revolution and the Creation of Modern Political Culture: The transformation of the political culture, 1789‚Äì1848 (1989). For example, there were eight Catholic periodicals in 1830 in Paris. None were officially owned or sponsored by the Church and they reflected a range of opinion among educated Catholics about current issues, such as the 1830 July Revolution that overthrew the Bourbon monarchy. Several were strong supporters of the Bourbon kings, but all eight ultimately urged support for the new government, putting their appeals in terms of preserving civil order. They often discussed the relationship between church and state. Generally they urged priests to focus on spiritual matters and not engage in politics. Historian M. Patricia Dougherty says this process created a distance between the Church and the new monarch and enabled Catholics to develop a new understanding of church-state relationships and the source of political authority.M. Patricia Dougherty, \\"The French Catholic press and the July Revolution.\\" French History 12#4 (1998): 403-428. =20th century= The press was handicapped during the war by shortages of newsprint and young journalists, and by an abundance of censorship designed to maintain home front morale by minimizing bad war news. The Parisian newspapers were largely stagnant after the war; circulation inched up to 6 million a day from 5 million in 1910. The major postwar success story was Paris Soir; which lacked any political agenda and was dedicated to providing a mix of sensational reporting to aid circulation, and serious articles to build prestige. By 1939 its circulation was over 1.7 million, double that of its nearest rival the tabloid Le Petit Parisien. In addition to its daily paper Paris Soir sponsored a highly successful women's magazine Marie-Claire. Another magazine Match was modeled after the photojournalism of the American magazine Life. Hutton 2:692-94 John Gunther wrote in 1940 that of the more than 100 daily newspapers in Paris, two (L'Humanit√© and Action Fran√ßaises publication) were honest; \\"Most of the others, from top to bottom, have news columns for sale\\". He reported that Bec et Ongles was simultaneously subsidized by the French government, German government, and Alexandre Stavisky, and that Italy allegedly paid 65 million francs to French newspapers in 1935. France was a democratic society in the 1930s, but the people were kept in the dark about critical issues of foreign policy. The government tightly controlled all of the media to promulgate propaganda to support the government's foreign policy of appeasement to the aggressions of Italy and especially Nazi Germany. There were 253 daily newspapers, all owned separately. The five major national papers based in Paris were all under the control of special interests, especially right-wing political and business interests that supported appeasement. They were all venal, taking large secret subsidies to promote the policies of various special interests. Many leading journalists were secretly on the government payroll. The regional and local newspapers were heavily dependent on government advertising and published news and editorials to suit Paris. Most of the international news was distributed through the Havas agency, which was largely controlled by the government.Anthony Adamthwaite, Grandeur and Misery: France‚Äôs Bid for Power in Europe 1914-1940 (1995) pp. 175-92. Britain =20th century= By 1900 popular journalism in Britain aimed at the largest possible audience, including the working class, had proven a success and made its profits through advertising. Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe (1865‚Äì1922), \\"More than anyone... shaped the modern press. Developments he introduced or harnessed remain central: broad contents, exploitation of advertising revenue to subsidize prices, aggressive marketing, subordinate regional markets, independence from party control.P.P. Catterall and Colin Seymour-Ure, \\"Northcliffe, Viscount.\\" in John Ramsden, ed. The Oxford Companion to Twentieth-Century British Politics (2002), p. 475. His Daily Mail held the world record for daily circulation until his death. Prime Minister Lord Salisbury quipped it was \\"written by office boys for office boys\\".Oxford Dictionary of Quotations (1975). Socialist and labour newspapers also proliferated and in 1912 the Daily Herald was launched as the first daily newspaper of the trade union and labour movement. Newspapers reached their peak of importance during the First World War, in part because wartime issues were so urgent and newsworthy, while members of Parliament were constrained by the all-party coalition government from attacking the government. By 1914 Northcliffe controlled 40 per cent of the morning newspaper circulation in Britain, 45 per cent of the evening and 15 per cent of the Sunday circulation.J. Lee. Thompson, \\"Fleet Street Colossus: The Rise and Fall of Northcliffe, 1896-1922.\\" Parliamentary History 25.1 (2006): 115-138. online p 115. He eagerly tried to turn it into political power, especially in attacking the government in the Shell Crisis of 1915. Lord Beaverbrook said he was, \\"the greatest figure who ever strode down Fleet Street.\\" Lord Beaverbrook, Politicians and the War, 1914-1916 (1928) 1:93. A.J.P. Taylor, however, says, \\"Northcliffe could destroy when he used the news properly. He could not step into the vacant place. He aspired to power instead of influence, and as a result forfeited both.\\"A.J.P. Taylor, English History 1914-1945 (1965) p 27. Other powerful editors included C. P. Scott of the Manchester Guardian, James Louis Garvin of The Observer and Henry William Massingham of the highly influential weekly magazine of opinion, The Nation.A.J.P. Taylor, English History 1914-1945 (1965), pp. 26-27.  Germany  Denmark Danish news media first appeared in the 1540s, when handwritten fly sheets reported on the news. In 1666, Anders Bording, the father of Danish journalism, began a state paper. The royal privilege to bring out a newspaper was issued to Joachim Wielandt in 1720. University officials handled the censorship, but in 1770 Denmark became one of the first nations of the world to provide for press freedom; it ended in 1799. The press in 1795‚Äì1814, led by intellectuals and civil servants, called out for a more just and modern society, and spoke out for the oppressed tenant farmers against the power of the old aristocracy.Thorkild Kj√¶rgaard, \\"The rise of press and public opinion in eighteenth‚Äêcentury Denmark‚ÄîNorway.\\" Scandinavian journal of History 14.4 (1989): 215-230. In 1834, the first liberal newspaper appeared, one that gave much more emphasis to actual news content rather than opinions. The newspapers championed the Revolution of 1848 in Denmark. The new constitution of 1849 liberated the Danish press. Newspapers flourished in the second half of the 19th century, usually tied to one or another political party or labor union. Modernization, bringing in new features and mechanical techniques, appeared after 1900. The total circulation was 500,000 daily in 1901, more than doubling to 1.2 million in 1925. The German occupation brought informal censorship; some offending newspaper buildings were simply blown up by the Nazis. During the war, the underground produced 550 newspapers‚Äîsmall, surreptitiously printed sheets that encouraged sabotage and resistance.Kenneth E. Olson, The history makers: The press of Europe from its beginnings through 1965 (LSU Press, 1966) pp 50 ‚Äì 64, 433 The appearance of a dozen editorial cartoons ridiculing Mohammed set off Muslim outrage and violent threats around the world. (see: Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy) The Muslim community decided the caricatures in the Copenhagen newspaper Jyllands-Posten in September 2005 represented another instance of Western animosity toward Islam, and were so sacriligious that the perpetrators deserved severe punishment.Jytte Klausen, The Cartoons That Shook the World (Yale UP, 2009).Ana Belen Soage, \\"The Danish caricatures seen from the Arab world.\\" Totalitarian Movements and Political Religions 7.3 (2006): 363-369. online The historiography of the Danish press is rich with scholarly studies. Historians have made insights into Danish political, social and cultural history, finding that individual newspapers are valid analytical entities, which can be studied in terms of source, content, audience, media, and effect.Niels Thomsen, \\"Why Study Press History? A reexamination of its purpose and of Danish contributions.\\" Scandinavian Journal of History 7.1-4 (1982): 1-13. Russia United States Asia =China= Journalism in China before 1910 primarily served the international community. The main national newspapers in Chinese were published by Protestant missionary societies in order to reach the literate. Hard news was not their specialty, but they did train the first generation of Chinese journalists in Western standards of news gathering. editorials, and advertising.Zhang Tao, \\"Protestant missionary publishing and the birth of Chinese elite journalism.\\" Journalism Studies 8.6 (2007): 879-897. Demands for reform and revolution was impossible for papers based inside China. Instead such demands appeared in polemical papers based in Japan, for example those edited by Liang Qichao (1873-1929). Natascha Vittinghoff, \\"Unity vs. uniformity: Liang Qichao and the invention of a\\" new journalism\\" for China.\\" Late Imperial China 23.1 (2002): 91-143. The overthrow of the old imperial regime in 1911 produced a surge in Chinese nationalism, an end to censorship, and a demand for professional, nation-wide journalism.Stephen MacKinnon, ‚ÄúToward a History of the Chinese Press in the Republican Period,‚Äù Modern China 23#1 (1997) pp. 3-32 All the major cities launched such efforts. Special attention was paid to China's role in the World War. to the disappointing Paris Peace Conference of 1919, and to the aggressive demands and actions of Japan against Chinese interests. Journalists created professional organizations, and aspired to separate news from commentary. At the Press Congress of the World conference in Honolulu in 1921, the Chinese delegates were among the most Westernized and self-consciously professional journalists from the developing world. By the late 1920s, however, there was a much greater emphasis on advertising and expanding circulation, and much less interest in the sort of advocacy journalism that had inspired the revolutionaries.Timothy B. Weston, \\"China, professional journalism, and liberal internationalism in the era of the First World War.\\" Pacific Affairs 83.2 (2010): 327-347. = India = The first newspaper in India was circulated in 1780 under the editorship of James Augustus Hicky, named Bengal Gazette. On May 30, 1826 Udant Martand (The Rising Sun), the first Hindi-language newspaper published in India, started from Calcutta (now Kolkata), published every Tuesday by Pt. Jugal Kishore Shukla. Maulawi Muhammad Baqir in 1836 founded the first Urdu-language newspaper the Delhi Urdu Akhbar. India's press in the 1840s was a motley collection of small- circulation daily or weekly sheets printed on rickety presses. Few extended beyond their small communities and seldom tried to unite the many castes, tribes, and regional subcultures of India. The Anglo-Indian papers promoted purely British interests. Englishman Robert Knight (1825‚Äì1890) founded two important English-language newspapers that reached a broad Indian audience, The Times of India and The Statesman. They promoted nationalism in India, as Knight introduced the people to the power of the press and made them familiar with political issues and the political process.Edwin Hirschmann, \\"An Editor Speaks for the Natives: Robert Knight in 19th Century India,\\" Journalism Quarterly (1986) 63#2 pp. 260-267. Latin America and the Caribbean British influence extended globally through its colonies and its informal business relationships with merchants in major cities. They needed up-to-date market and political information. The Diario de Pernambuco was founded in Recife, Brazil, in 1825.Pernambuco.com, O IN√çCIO DA HIST√ìRIA. El Mercurio was founded in Valparaiso, Chile, in 1827. The most influential newspaper in Peru, El Comercio, first appeared in 1839. The Jornal do Commercio was established in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1827. Much later Argentina founded its newspapers in Buenos Aires: La Prensa in 1869 and La Nacion in 1870. In Jamaica, there were a number of newspapers that represented the views of the white planters who owned slaves. These newspapers included titles such as the Royal Gazette, The Diary and Kingston Daily Advertiser, Cornwall Chronicle, Cornwall Gazette, and Jamaica Courant.Michael Siva, After the Treaties: A Social, Economic and Demographic History of Maroon Society in Jamaica, 1739-1842, PhD Dissertation (Southampton: Southampton University, 2018), p. 279. In 1826, two free coloureds, Edward Jordan and Robert Osborn, founded The Watchman, which openly campaigned for the rights of free coloureds, and became Jamaica's first anti- slavery newspaper. In 1830, the criticism of the slave-owning hierarchy was too much, and the Jamaican colonial authorities arrested Jordan, the editor, and charged him with constructive treason. However, Jordan was eventually acquitted, and he eventually became Mayor of Kingston in post-Emancipation Jamaica. On the abolition of slavery in the 1830s, Gleaner Company was founded by two Jamaican Jewish brothers, Joshua and Jacob De Cordova, budding businessmen who represented the new class of light-skinned Jamaicans taking over post-Emancipation Jamaica. While the Gleaner represented the new establishment for the next century, there was a growing black, nationalist movement that campaigned for increased political representation and rights in the early twentieth century. To this end, Osmond Theodore Fairclough founded Public Opinion in 1937. O.T. Fairclough was supported by radical journalists Frank Hill and H.P. Jacobs, and the first editorial of this new newspaper tried to galvanise public opinion around a new nationalism. Strongly aligned to the People's National Party (PNP), Public Opinion counted among its journalists progressive figures such as Roger Mais, Una Marson, Amy Bailey, Louis Marriott, Peter Abrahams, and future prime minister Michael Manley, among others.Ewart Walters, We Come From Jamaica: The National Movement, 1937-1962 (Ottawa: Boyd McRubie, 2014), pp. 65-69. While Public Opinion campaigned for self-government, British prime minister Winston Churchill made it known he had no intention of presiding \\"over the liquidation of the British Empire\\", and consequently the Jamaican nationalists in the PNP were disappointed with the watered-down constitution that was handed down to Jamaica in 1944. Mais wrote an article saying \\"Now we know why the draft of the new constitution has not been published before,\\" because the underlings of Churchill were \\"all over the British Empire implementing the real imperial policy implicit in the statement by the Prime Minister\\". The British colonial police raided the offices of Public Opinion, seized Mais's manuscript, arrested Mais himself, and convicted him of seditious libel, jailing him for six months.Walters, We Come From Jamaica, pp. 69-70. Radio and television The history of radio broadcasting begins in the 1920s, and reached its apogee in the 1930s and 1940s. Experimental television was being studied before the 2nd world war, became operational in the late 1940s, and became widespread in the 1950s and 1960s, largely but not entirely displacing radio. Internet journalism The rapidly growing impact of the Internet, especially after 2000, brought \\"free\\" news and classified advertising to audiences that no longer cared for paid subscriptions. The Internet undercut the business model of many daily newspapers. Bankruptcy loomed across the U.S. and did hit such major papers as the Rocky Mountain news (Denver), the Chicago Tribune and the Los Angeles Times, among many others. Chapman and Nuttall find that proposed solutions, such as multiplatforms, paywalls, PR-dominated news gathering, and shrinking staffs have not resolved the challenge. The result, they argue, is that journalism today is characterized by four themes: personalization, globalization, localization, and pauperization.Jane L. Chapman and Nick Nuttall, Journalism Today: A Themed History (Wiley-Blackwell, 2011), pp. 299, 313-314.  Historiography  Journalism historian David Nord has argued that in the 1960s and 1970s: : \\"In journalism history and media history, a new generation of scholars . . . criticised traditional histories of the media for being too insular, too decontextualised, too uncritical, too captive to the needs of professional training, and too enamoured of the biographies of men and media organizations.\\"David Paul Nord, \\"The History of Journalism and the History of the Book,\\" in Explorations in Communications and History, edited by Barbie Zelizer. (London: Routledge, 2008) p 164 In 1974, James W. Carey identified the 'Problem of Journalism History'. The field was dominated by a Whig interpretation of journalism history. :\\"This views journalism history as the slow, steady expansion of freedom and knowledge from the political press to the commercial press, the setbacks into sensationalism and yellow journalism, the forward thrust into muck raking and social responsibility....the entire story is framed by those large impersonal forces buffeting the press: industrialisation, urbanisation and mass democracy.James Carey, \\"The Problem of Journalism History,\\" Journalism History (1974) 1#1, pp. 3, 4. O'Malley says the criticism went too far, because there was much of value in the deep scholarship of the earlier period.Tom O'Malley, \\"History, Historians and the Writing Newspaper History in the UK c.1945‚Äì1962,\\" Media History, (2012) 18#3, pp. 289-310.

He became best known for winning not only the Prix du Jockey Club (French Derby), but also the Irish Derby Stakes in 1998 ‚Äì a classic double which until that year was only completed by Assert and Old Vic in the 1980s. Background Dream Well's dam was Soul Dream, herself the daughter of the dual Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe winner Alleged. Sired by Champion Sadler's Wells, himself the winner of Irish 2,000 Guineas and the Eclipse Stakes. Dream Well's ancestors through his great grand dam Mia Pola can be traced back to U.S. Triple Crown champion War Admiral, and also his pedigree carries a double cross of world-renowned sire Northern Dancer, through his dam and sire. Racing career As a three-year- old, trained by Pascal Bary and ridden by Cash Asmussen, Dream Well won the Prix du Jockey Club (French Derby) on only his fourth ever outing, beating Croco Rouge by ¬Ω length. One month later in magnificent style, quickly leaving his rivals for dead, Dream Well completed the double by winning the Irish Derby and so beating City Honours by 4¬Ω lengths. This led to Dream Well being voted the 1998 Irish Horse of the Year and 1998 European Horse of the Year. Stud record Dream Well was retired from racing at the end of the 1999 season and was sent to stud in Japan and, for one season, New Zealand. He returned to France in 2004 to stand at Haras de Fresnay-le-Buffard, where he now stands. Dream Well now has his own BLOG.

The town has a population of 36,478 (2003 census). It is located 303 km (189 mi) north of the country's capital, Bangui. The Ouham River passes through Bossangoa and on through a number of waterfalls east of the city before turning north to join the Chari River in Chad. The Mandjia, the third most populous ethnic group in the Central African Republic, are concentrated in Bossangoa. Along with the Baya, a closely related group, the Mandjia are important historically for their resistance to invasion by various Muslim powers to the north. From 1901 to 1905 Bossangoa and the surrounding area was in rebellion against French colonial authorities. Bossangoa became a center of Protestant missionary activity during the 1920s. In 1959, the city was made the seat of the Apostolic Prefecture of Bossangoa from the Diocese of Berb√©rati. In 1964, it was promoted as the Diocese of Bossangoa. In June 1980 the city was the scene of clashes between police and farmers over government food policies. The next year French troops were called in to suppress rioting in the aftermath of elections.

It has a population of 54,551 (2012 census), making it the fourth largest city in CAR by population, and the second largest city of the prefecture after Berb√©rati. The city takes its name as a tribute to the assassinated French President Sadi Carnot. The city is situated on the eastern bank of the Mamb√©r√© river, and is served by Carnot Airport. Yams, cassava, and cotton are cultivated, and cattle are reared in the area. The region lacks a functioning health service and is affected by an extremely high mortality rate and a high disease burden of malaria, HIV and tuberculosis.  History  In 1894, Fran√ßois Joseph Clozel founded a French military post near the village of Tendira. The locality was given the name Carnot in homage to the French president assassinated in 1894: Sadi Carnot (1837-1894). In 1902, the town became home to the 5th company of the 1st RTS (Senegalese Rifle Regiment), a corps of colonial infantry in the French army. On 04 November 1911, as part of the Franco-German Accord, an agreement that ended the Agadir Crisis, Carnot was ceded to the German Cameroon (Kamerun). While claimed by Germany, the region became known as Neukamerun. During the First World War, the Kamerun Campaign (1914), saw the departure of the German occupiers. As a result of this, France then re-claimed the region. By decree on 12 December 1920, Carnot became the capital of a subdivision of the district of Haute-Sangha, then the capital of the district of Mamb√©r√©-Lobaye, in French Congo (Colonie du Moyen-Congo). The city was involved in the rubber trade. From the middle of the 1920s onward, cars and roads were introduced to the area. A ferry across the Mamb√©r√© was commissioned in 1926. The region was struck by an earthquake in 1934. The following year a Protestant mission was built in Carnot. French soldiers departed from the city in 1937. In 1938, Berbers and Fulani peoples arrived from North Africa and settled in the area. The first mosque was built in Carnot in 1940, and a bridge over the river Mamb√©r√© was constructed in 1944. The city is the seat of the Roman Catholic parish of Notre-Dame de la Mamb√©r√© de Carnot founded in 1945; it depends on the diocese of Berb√©rati. The collapse of the mining industry in 2009, and resulting impoverishment of much of the population in Carnot, exacerbated the already poor health situation resulting in high levels of malnutrition and mortality.

Description The Dynna Stone, listed as N 68 under Rundata, is a roughly 3-meter-tall, triangular slab of pinkish-red sandstone with runic inscriptions running down one of its edges, and with carved images on the front. The stone was erected ca. AD 1040 ‚Äì 1050, and its imagery is considered among the first Christian pictorial art in Norway. The rather crude images on the front of the stone slab depict the nativity scene of Matthew 2:1‚Äì12, including the infant Jesus, the Star of Bethlehem and the three wise men on horseback.Gr√§slund 2003:490-492. The two women mentioned in the runic inscription were likely familiar with the story of the Epiphany. It has been suggested that the use of the term \\"handiest\\" (or \\"most skilled\\") in the runic text for the dead girl was a reference to her textile or embroidery designs, and that the images on the stone may represent these designs.Page 1995:170, citing Str√∂mb√§ck 1970. The Stone's inscription is in the younger futhark, although their use is inconsistent with long-branch and short-twig runes used in some places.Spurkland 2001:103‚Äì105. Sometimes the carver used both the long-branch and short-twig forms of the same rune within the same word. The reference to bridge-building in the runic text is fairly common in rune stones during this time period. Some are Christian references related to passing the bridge into the afterlife. At this time, the Catholic Church sponsored the building of roads and bridges through the use of indulgences in return for intercession for the soul. There are many examples of these bridge stones dated from the eleventh century, including runic inscriptions S√∂ 101, U 489, and U 617. Although the Dynna Stone uses Christian imagery and text, the stone was raised among the old family grave mounds, an indication of cultic continuity even after the conversion to Christianity. The Dynna stone shows that Hadeland was closely connected to countries abroad such as Scotland as stones similar to this one are found in Scotland.Eikeset 2008:84-85. In one of the twin churches at Gran (Nicolai church) a stone similar to the Dynna stone was found in the wall above the door between the top of the door and ceiling. It was seen in 1823 and last in 1828.Eikeset 2008:191‚Äì192. The Dynna stone was acquired by the Norwegian Museum of Cultural History in Oslo in 1879. Until then it had been used as a salt lick for cattle at the Nordre Dynna farm near Gran. The stone is still part of the museum‚Äôs permanent medieval exhibition. A copy of the stone can be found atop a Viking Age grave mound at the Hadeland Folkemuseum in Gran. Inscription Detail of Dynna Stone image. A transliteration of the runic inscription reads: :√ó kunuur √ó kir√æi √ó bru √ó √æririks tutir √ó iftir osri√æi √ó tutur √ó sina √ó su uas mar hanarst √ó o ha√æalanti Translated to English, the inscription reads: \\"Gunnv√¥r, √ûry√∞r√≠kr's daughter, made the bridge in memory of her daughter √Åstr√≠√∞r.

Tangyuan can be either small or large and filled or unfilled. They are traditionally eaten during Yuanxiao in the Lantern Festival, but also served as a dessert on a Chinese wedding day, Winter Solstice Festival (), and any occasions such as a family reunion, because of a homophone for union (). Historical development Historically, a number of different names were used to refer to this food. During the Yongle era of the Ming Dynasty, the name was officially fixed as yuanxiao (derived from the Yuanxiao Festival), which is used in northern China. This name literally means \\"first evening\\", being the first full moon following Chinese New Year, which is always a new moon. In southern China, however, they are called tangyuan. Legend has it that during Yuan Shikai's rule from 1912 to 1916, he disliked the name yuanxiao () because it sounded identical to \\"remove Yuan\\" (); thus he gave orders to change the name to tangyuan. This new moniker literally means \\"round balls in soup\\" or \\"round dumplings in soup\\". In the Hakka and Cantonese varieties of Chinese, tangyuan is pronounced as \\"tong rhen\\" or \\"tong jyun\\". The term tangtuan (Hakka: tong ton, Cantonese: tong tyun) is not as commonly used in these varieties as tangyuan. Nowadays however, \\"tangyuan\\" usually refers to the southern style, while \\"yuanxiao\\" refers to the northern style, differentiated by their method of preparation. = Geographical differences = This type of glutinous rice flour dumpling is eaten in both northern and southern China. Sweet fillings such as sugar, sesame, osmanthus flowers, sweet bean paste and sweetened tangerine peel are used. In northern China, \\"yuanxiao\\" is made by rolling small pieces of hardened filling in dry glutinous rice flour, adding water slowly, until it becomes a ball with a diameter of roughly 2 centimeters. Where as the southern \\"tangyuan\\", is made by wrapping soft filling in a glutinous rice \\"dough\\" similar to making a dumpling. In the South, it is common to have tang yuan plain in a savory soup made with Chinese (daikon) radish and home made fish cake. =Cultural significance= For many Chinese families in mainland China as well as overseas, tangyuan is typically eaten together with family. The round shape of the balls and the bowls in which they are served symbolize family cohesion. Ingredients Nowadays, tangyuan (ÊπØÂúì) often come in rainbow-like colors, and filled with many flavors such as fruit preserves Traditional tangyuan with sweet sesame filling While tangyuan was originally a food eaten during festivals, it has become a dessert consumed year-round rather than simply a festival food. For instance, tangyuan is traditionally in white color. Yet, in order to cater to consumers‚Äô needs and changing tastes, dessert specialty shops create new flavors or colors of tangyuan by substituting the traditional filling with chocolate, mashed potato and pumpkin paste. Thus, tangyuan has already evolved into a dessert that is consumed by Chinese from time to time throughout the year and is no longer limited to festivals. In both filled and unfilled tangyuan, the main ingredient is glutinous rice flour. A filled tangyuan's filling can be either sweet or savory. Northern variations mix sesame, peanuts, sweet bean paste and place them into bamboo baskets with rice flour, sprinkle water continuously on the rice flour to form the fillings and form round balls. Southern variations are typically larger, and are made by wrapping the filling into sticky rice flour wrapping and scrunching them into balls. Sweet fillings can be: * Chocolate paste (softened butter mixed with cocoa powder and stirred until blended) * A piece of cut sugarcane rock candy * Fruit preserves * Sesame paste (ground black sesame seeds mixed with sugar and lard) - the most common filling * Red bean paste (Azuki bean paste) * Chopped peanuts (or peanut butter) and sugar * Lotus seed paste Serving Tangyuan is first cooked in boiling water. Once cooked, the savory tangyuan is served in a clear soup broth, while sweet tangyuan is served in a ginger- infused syrup. Nowadays, deep-fried tangyuan have gained popularity in the Southern part of China. Filled tangyuan are put into hot oil to make its surface crispy (this is for deep-fried tangyuan). Unfilled tangyuan are served as part of a sweet dessert soup known in Cantonese cuisine as tong sui (literally:\\"sugar water\\"). Common types include: * Red bean soup * Black sesame soup * Ginger and rock sugar * Fermented glutinous rice (), Sweet Osmanthus and rock sugar. Availability The most renowned varieties come from Ningbo in Zhejiang Province. However, they are traditionally eaten throughout China. Tangyuan has also come to be associated with the Winter Solstice and Chinese New Year in various regions. Today, the food is eaten all year round. Mass-produced tangyuan is commonly found in the frozen food section of Asian supermarkets in China and overseas. Related dishes in Southeast Asia Mont lone yay paw, served with shredded coconut, is a popular festive dish served in Myanmar during Thingyan. In Indonesia, an adapted version, called Wedang Ronde (Wedang in Javanese means beverage, and Ronde means round ball), is a popular food eaten during cold temperatures. The round colored balls of glutinous rice can be filled with crushed peanuts and sugar, or left plain and is served in a sweetened, mild ginger broth often boiled in fragrant pandan leaves. Crushed, toasted peanuts, tapioca pearls, and slices of coconut can also be added. In Myanmar (Burma), mont lone yay baw (·Äô·ÄØ·Äî·Ä∑·Ä∫·Äú·ÄØ·Ä∂·Ä∏·Äõ·Ä±·Äï·Ä±·Ä´·Ä∫) is a traditional festive dish, served during Thingyan, and filled with pieces of jaggery and served with coconut shavings.

Early life and career Rendel was the son of the surveyor James Rendel or Rendle and his wife Jane, daughter of the architect John Meadows (died 1791); he was born near Okehampton, Devon, in 1799. He was initiated into the operations of a millwright under an uncle at Teignmouth, while from his father he learnt some civil engineering. At an early age he went to London as a surveyor under Thomas Telford, by whom he was employed on the surveys for the proposed suspension bridge across the Mersey at Runcorn. About 1822 he settled at Plymouth, and commenced the construction of roads in the north of Devon. One of his smaller projects, still surviving, was an 1826 bridge over Bowcombe Creek on the Kingsbridge Estuary. In August 1824 he was employed by the Earl of Morley in making a bridge across the Catwater, an estuary of the Plym within the harbour of Plymouth at Laira. To guard against the undermining effects of the current, he formed an artificial bottom. The bridge, which cost ¬£27,126, was opened on 14 July 1827. With the exception of John Rennie's 1819 Southwark Bridge over the Thames, it was the largest iron structure then existing, and in 1836 Rendel received a Telford Medal from the Institution of Civil Engineers for a paper describing its construction. Plymouth partnership He soon entered into partnership at Plymouth with Nathaniel Beardmore, and his practice rapidly grew. In 1826 he erected Bowcombe Bridge, near Kingsbridge, Devon, when hydraulic power was first applied to the machinery for making swing bridges. In 1831 he introduced a new system of crossing rivers by means of chain ferries worked by steam, and in 1832 he constructed a floating bridge on this principle, crossing the Dart at Dartmouth. Between 1832 and 1834 similar floating bridges were erected at Torpoint and Saltash across the Tamar, which greatly facilitated the intercourse between Devon and Cornwall. For these achievements a second Telford medal was awarded to Rendel in 1838. The Torpoint Ferry still operates, albeit much updated. A similar floating bridge was implemented as the Woolston ferry between Woolston, Hampshire and Southampton in 1836. During this period Rendel was also engaged in reporting on harbours and rivers in the southwest of England, and thus acquired that mastery of hydraulic engineering on which his fame chiefly rests. In 1829 he designed the harbour which was afterwards executed at Par in Cornwall; in 1835 he carried out works on the Bude harbour, dock, and canal, and in 1836 he designed Brixham harbour and the breakwater at Torquay. In 1836-37 he designed, as a terminus to the Great Western Railway, the Millbay Docks, Plymouth, afterwards executed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel. In 1843-44 he constructed canals in Devon, and was engaged on the Colchester and Arundel navigation; and in 1844 he designed harbour improvements for Newhaven and Littlehampton in Sussex. At the same time he was largely employed on marine works by the Admiralty and other government departments, as well as by public companies. The Exchequer Loan Commissioners engaged him in 1835-37 in the repair of the Montrose suspension bridge after its fall. There he introduced the principle of trussing the framing of the roadway. This system of preventing the undulation, by which so many structures of the kind have been destroyed, was quickly acknowledged to be essential to their safety. London practice About 1838 Rendel dissolved his partnership with Beardmore at Plymouth, and settled in London, but still was chiefly employed on work for his native county. In 1841 he constructed the Millbay Pier, Plymouth ‚Äì a work of considerable difficulty owing to the depth of water in which it was built. Here he first introduced the method of construction since employed in Holyhead and Portland harbours. In 1839 he was engaged in preparing schemes for a railway between Exeter and Plymouth, running over Dartmoor. At the time sufficient funds could not be raised, but an alternative coastal line was afterwards carried out by I. K. Brunel. In 1843 he made plans for docks at Birkenhead, which he defended before parliamentary committees against hostile local influence. The contest was long protracted, and the incessant labour served to shorten Rendel's life; his published evidence forms a valuable record of engineering practice of the period. In 1844-53 he constructed docks at Grimsby; in 1848-53 extensions of the docks at Leith; in 1850-53 docks at Garston on the Mersey, with extensions of the East and West India and the London docks. As constructor of the Grimsby docks he was one of the first to apply W. G. Armstrong's system of hydraulic machinery for working the lock gates, sluices, cranes, etc. For this work he received a grand medal of honour at the Paris Exhibition of 1855. For the Admiralty he planned in 1845, and afterwards constructed, the packet and refuge harbour at Holyhead, and in 1847 he constructed the harbour of refuge at Portland. In the making of these great harbours he contrived, by means of elevated timber staging, to let down masses of stone vertically from railway trucks, and, by building up the masonry with unexampled rapidity to a point above sea level, contrived to reduce to comparative insignificance the force of the sea during building operations. As many as 24,000 tons (24 kt) of stone were deposited in one week. In 1850 he commenced making a new harbour at St. Peter Port, Guernsey. River improvements Rendel was much occupied in the improvement of rivers. In 1852, in conjunction with Sir William Cubitt and Richard John Griffith, he examined and reported to the treasury upon the arterial drainage works in Ireland, and in 1855 he completed the suspension bridge across the Ness at Inverness for the Commissioners of Highland Roads and Bridges. His aid was also sought by foreign countries. In 1852-53 he designed docks for Genoa; in 1853-55 he reported on the harbour of Rio de Janeiro; in 1854 he reported to the Prussian government on a naval establishment at Heppens on the river Jade; and in 1854-55, by direction of the Hamburg senate, he inspected the Elbe from Hamburg to Cuxhaven. For the Spanish, he devised a system of railways between Madrid and Oviedo, as well as improvements of the river Ebro. In England his railway work was somewhat restricted, but he executed the Birkenhead, Lancashire and Cheshire Junction Railway and in India he directed the construction of the East Indian and the Madras railways. In 1856 he reported on the new Westminster Bridge. His last work was a design for the suspension bridge across the ornamental water in St. James's Park, London. In 1852 and 1853 Rendel served as president of the Institution of Civil Engineers, which he joined in 1824. He became a fellow of the Royal Society on 23 February 1843 and was elected a member of the council. He died at 10 Kensington Palace Gardens, London, on 21 November 1856 and is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery. Legacy Rendel was a man of great energy, and implicit confidence was felt in his efficiency, tact, and honesty. His greatest enterprises were the construction of the harbours at Holyhead and Portland works, which go some way to justify the linking of his name with Smeaton, Rennie, and Telford. Rendel contributed several valuable papers to the Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers. He married Catherine Jane Harris, who died on 18 July 1884, aged 87. His third son, Stuart Rendel, at one time managing partner in London of Sir William Armstrong's engineering firm, was MP for Montgomeryshire from 1880‚Äì94, and was raised to the peerage as Lord Rendel in 1895.

In Spain it is sold as \\"Pato WC\\", in Portugal as \\"WC Pato\\", and in Italy as \\"Anitra WC\\". In Indonesia, it is one of the \\"Bebek\\" (duck) line of products, such as Bebek Kloset, Bebek Semerbak, Bebek Semerbak Flush, Bebek In Tank, and Bebek Kamar Mandi. The \\"Toilet\\" moniker has been dropped from the name in the UK and Ireland, and the product is now called \\"Duck\\".  Ingredients  The following ingredients are part of all Duck toilet-cleaning products: * L-lactic acid * Water * Ethoxylated alcohol * Xanthan gum * Sodium laureth sulfate Depending on variant, various dyes and fragrances are used, such as: * Liquid Marine: Liquitint Blue Dye, Liquitint Pink AL Dye, 2,6-dimethyl-7-octen-2-ol, 2-methoxy-4-propylphenol, 3,7-dimethyloct-6-enenitrile, coumarin, dipropylene glycol, eucalyptol, geraniol, isobornyl acetate, isobutyl salicylate, linalool. * Liquid Citrus: Liquitint Orange 157, 2-t-butylcyclohexyl acetate, 3,7-dimethylnona-2,6-dienenitrile, allyl 3-cyclohexylpropionate, decanal, dipropylene glycol, ethyl 2-methylvalerate, gamma-undecalactone, methylbenzyl acetate, tricyclo(5.2.1.02,6)dec-4-en-8-yl acetate, triethyl citrate. * Liquid Mint: Acid Blue 93, dipropylene glycol, mentha arvensis oil. * Liquid Pine: Acid Blue #9, FD&C; Yellow #5, 2,4-dimethyl-3-cyclohexene carboxaldehyde, 2,6-dimethyl-7-octen-2-ol, 2-methylundecanal, borneol, coumarin, dipropylene glycol, eucalyptol, isobornyl acetate, lauraldehyde, pogostemon cablin oil.

It was a heavily political weekly paper that was constantly on the verge of being suppressed by the Royalist government, from the time of its establishment in 1770 to 1776, during the runup to the American Revolution. In 1771-1773 the Spy featured the essays of several anonymous political commentators who called themselves \\"Centinel,\\" \\"Mucius Scaevola\\" and \\"Leonidas.\\" They spoke in the same terms about similar issues, kept Patriot polemics on the front page, and supported each other against attacks in pro- government papers. Rhetorical combat was a Patriot tactic that explained the issues of the day and fostered cohesiveness without advocating outright rebellion. The columnists spoke to the colonists as an independent people tied to Britain only by voluntary legal compact. The Spy soon carried radicalism to its logical conclusion. When articles from the Spy were reprinted in other papers, as the country as a whole was ready for Thomas Paine's Common Sense (1776).Neil L.

Fremantle career  Bandy was an original Fremantle Docker and made his AFL debut in 1995. For a player of 200 centimetres, he was extraordinarily mobile, which appealed to then Fremantle coach Gerard Neesham who recruited Bandy as a ruckman from the Perth Demons with a priority selection in 1995. In his time with Freo he became a fan favourite and dominated the ruck and forward line at certain stages during his 6 years at the club. He played 105 matches with Fremantle, kicked 80 goals, and finished third in its club best-and-fairest award in 1999.  Western Bulldogs career  At the end of the 2001 season, Bandy was traded to the Western Bulldogs where he played 45 matches. He made his first appearance for the Bulldogs in 2002 and played all 22 matches that season and kicked 30 goals. Regarded as one of the fittest players at the Bulldogs, Bandy suffered several injuries in the following which ultimately restricted his playing ability and he only played 11 games in his last two seasons.

Notably, they were the only unitary authorities created by the local government reforms of the 1970s in Great Britain; which otherwise applied a two-tier structure. They did not form districts within the regions of Scotland because their remoteness made it unviable.Hampton, W., Local Government and Urban Politics, (1991) Single-tier council areas were not created throughout the rest of Scotland until 1996, under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994, which came into force in 1996. In most of Scotland, from 1975 to 1996, local government areas consisted of regions and districts. The islands areas still exist, but have no special status.

It begins at a trumpet interchange with the Southern State Parkway in the village of North Massapequa and serves Boundary Avenue, NY 24, and Central Avenue before terminating at a traffic circle with Plainview Road and a local park road in Bethpage State Park. The parkway is designated as New York State Route 907E (NY 907E), an unsigned reference route. It is also ceremoniously designated as the Philip B. Healey Memorial Parkway for Assemblyman Philip B. Healey (1921‚Äì1996). The Bethpage State Parkway was first proposed by Robert Moses and the Long Island State Park Commission in 1924 to help get people from New York City to parks in Nassau and Suffolk counties. Construction of the parkway began in 1934, and the highway opened on November 14, 1936, along with the Laurelton Parkway (part of the Belt Parkway system) in Queens. The new parkway cost $1.04 million (1936 USD) to construct. Moses proposed extending the Bethpage in both directions, south to Merrick Road via Massapequa State Park and north to Caumsett State Park, via an extended Bethpage and the new Caumsett State Parkway, respectively. Both proposals were not constructed; however, bike paths leading away from both directions of the parkway have been constructed or are under construction. Several scaled-back proposals to extend the Bethpage north have been proposed, including an extension to NY 25A in Cold Spring Harbor and another to NY 135 (the Seaford‚ÄìOyster Bay Expressway) in Bethpage. A bike path was constructed along the Bethpage State Parkway in the 1970s using the alignment once reserved for the southern extension and land along the east side of the current parkway. The Bethpage Bikeway, was extended from its original northern terminus to the Long Island Rail Road station in Syosset. The extension also uses part of the former Long Island Motor Parkway.  Route description  The Bethpage State Parkway northbound approaching the Long Island Rail Road tracks and exit B4 in Bethpage The Bethpage State Parkway begins at Southern State Parkway exit 31, a trumpet interchange located within the Massapequa Preserve in the hamlet of North Massapequa. On the southbound Bethpage Parkway, the junction is signed as exit B1. From the Southern State Parkway, the Bethpage proceeds northward through North Massapequa and the town of Oyster Bay as a two-lane highway, traversing the northwesternmost part of the Massapequa Preserve. The forests of the preserve serve as a buffer between the highway and the dense neighborhoods of North Massapequa, and this setup follows the parkway to exit B2, a northbound- only exit for Boundary Avenue. Heading northbound, the stretch prior to the exit gore is two lanes wide. After passing under Boundary Avenue, the Bethpage Parkway bends to the northwest, leaving the Massapequa Preserve but continuing to run across a wooded strip of land in an otherwise heavily developed area. The highway passes through South Farmingdale on its way into the Farmingdale section of Oyster Bay, where it briefly widens to four lanes and begins to curve northward ahead of exit B3, a partial cloverleaf interchange with NY 24 (Hempstead Turnpike). The southbound cloverleaf ramps connect directly to NY 24, while the northbound ramps use a short section of Beach Street to reach the state route. Continuing northward, the Bethpage State Parkway passes under the Main Line of the Long Island Rail Road tracks and enters Bethpage, where the highway meets Central Avenue at exit B4 just north of the tracks. While Central Avenue heads west to Bethpage's commercial center, the parkway bends northeastward into Bethpage State Park and connects to Plainview Road and a local park road by way of unsigned exit B5, a traffic circle. The Bethpage State Parkway ends here while Plainview Road connects to the nearby Seaford‚ÄìOyster Bay Expressway (NY 135) and the Bethpage State Golf Course. The entire parkway corridor is served by a bike path that runs along the east side of the Bethpage Parkway, and the path continues northwest from exit B5 along the east side of Plainview Road. The Bethpage Parkway was ceremoniously designated February 27, 1997 as the Philip B. Healey Memorial Parkway for Philip B. Healey, a State Assemblyman from Massapequa who died in May 1996. Healey had served the Massapequa area in the Assembly since 1971. History = Design and construction = 222x222px The Bethpage State Parkway was developed as part of a plan proposed by Robert Moses in 1924 that would help people travel in private automobiles from New York City to state parks proposed by the Long Island State Park Commission (LISPC). Moses, president of the LISPC, saw this as a personal mission, having owned a residence in Babylon. While the LISPC was formed to get more state parks, Moses was more focused on building roadways to get to them. Development throughout Nassau County had become common: with a 441% increase in population from 1900 to 1930, it was becoming more urgent to secure open land for parks. The agency was given the right to condemn land for these parks, which led to conflict with locals and other agencies who felt it isolated them from getting money in the development craze. Bethpage State Park was created from land originally owned by Benjamin Yoakum, a railroad executive. In 1923, Yoakum opened a golf course on the land with 18 holes and a country club. Eight years later, in 1931, the LISPC leased the property from Yoakum. It was made into public land a year later, at which point the property was renamed the Bethpage Golf Club. On May 24, 1934, the land which had become Bethpage State Park was sold to the LISPC. In similarity to parkways designed to access Jones Beach State Park, Moses designed the Bethpage State Parkway as a road that would have a rustic environment. This would include the use of wooden light posts instead of steel, wooden guide rails, and concrete overpasses designed with a stone face. Along with these designs, Moses also confirmed that the parkways would remain free of commercial vehicles and truck traffic. The parkway was designed with a line of woodlands alongside both lanes. Construction began on the parkway in 1934 even though a date of completion for the rest of the Long Island parkway system‚Äîwhich the Bethpage was intended to connect to‚Äîhad yet to be established. On November 14, 1936, the recreational parkway was opened to traffic along with the Laurelton Parkway in Queens. Automobiles lined up at the Southern State Parkway in North Massapequa to travel the new parkway, which cost a total of $1.05 million (1936 USD). The ceremonial ribbon was cut at noon, after which Moses spoke praise to the federal government for its assistance and discussed how Bethpage State Park was previously inaccessible. The event was followed by a luncheon at the park. = Extensions = { \\"type\\": \\"FeatureCollection\\", \\"features\\": [ { \\"type\\": \\"Feature\\", \\"properties\\": { \\"stroke\\": \\"#000000\\",

The right-of-way for this new parkway was to cross Massapequa State Park, and as a result, Moses saw no trouble in acquiring the right-of-way. Moses proposed building interchanges at Merrick Road, which would have been a trumpet interchange, and NY 27, which would have been a full cloverleaf. The interchange with the Southern State Parkway would have been upgraded to a full cloverleaf. The design of the extension would be different than that of the original Bethpage Parkway, however, as the designs were refined in the 1950s to make the current parkway and extension a four-lane divided highway instead of the two-lane undivided design used in the 1930s. In the 1970s, a new bike path was constructed alongside the entire length of the Bethpage State Parkway. The path also continued south to Merrick Road by way of the right-of-way formerly proposed for the Bethpage Parkway's southern extension. On May 20, 1961, a new parkway was proposed by the LISPC to connect the Northern State Parkway to the proposed Caumsett State Park, the site of a wildlife refuge and arboretum. The parkway would be constructed as a northern extension of the Bethpage State Parkway, using filled land to traverse Cold Spring Harbor. It also required the condemning of a Standard Oil Company tank farm to avoid demolishing high- priced homes, which were to be taken via the three alternate routes proposed. In 1965, the LISPC proposed that the four-lane parkway wind through Cold Spring Harbor and enter the village of Lloyd Harbor. Three years later, however, the LISPC said all they proposed was a scenic and landscaped two-lane road in the future. Conservationists of the Caumsett estate worried that the plans were too vague; furthermore, they believed that Caumsett should not be turned into a major-use facility like that of Jones Beach State Park on the southern shore. Extending the Bethpage northward was a requirement for building the new parkway, and four new interchanges were proposed for the Bethpage Parkway. The first, exit B5, would be at NY 135 (the Seaford‚ÄìOyster Bay Expressway). With this new interchange, the traffic circle with Plainview Road in Bethpage State Park would be eliminated. Other junctions included a diamond interchange for Plainview Avenue and Bethpage State Park, a full cloverleaf interchange with Old Country Road, and a partial cloverleaf interchange with the Long Island Expressway (then-NY 495). North of there, the new Caumsett exits would be a full cloverleaf interchange with the Northern State Parkway, a diamond interchange with NY 25 (Jericho Turnpike) and an interchange with NY 25A and NY 108. After the NY 25A interchange, the parkway would continue north into Caumsett State Park and end at a traffic circle at the southern end of the park. In 1990, the Long Island Regional Planning Board proposed a new parkway extension to NY 25A in Cold Spring Harbor as part of a 20-year highway improvement program. However, funding sources were not specified. As part of the Long Island Transportation Plan 2000, the New York State Department of Transportation proposed that the Bethpage be extended northwest to NY 135 in Bethpage. In 1987, however, the Long Island Greenbelt Trail Conference proposed that the right-of-way for the Caumsett become part of a new Greenbelt trail. In September 2002, Governor George Pataki announced the opening of Trail View State Park, a new, linear state park using the former Bethpage and Caumsett right-of-way. The park also included a trail. The New York State Department of Transportation is currently constructing the Bethpage Bikeway, a multi-use trail extending northward from Bethpage State Park to the Syosset station on the Long Island Rail Road. Part of the path will use a former alignment of the Long Island Motor Parkway. The proposed bike trail will cost $6.49 million (2012 USD) and was expected to be completed on July 3, 2012. The contract is slated to expire on December 30, 2012.

But the genial Edwards kept his spirits up and was a popular tourist. He returned for three home Tests against India in 1980‚Äì81 where he chipped in with useful runs, but the emergence of Ian Smith signalled the end of his international career. Edwards played first-class and List A cricket for Central Districts from 1973-74 to 1984-85. His highest first-class score was 177 not out against Wellington in 1980-81, which was also his most successful season, with 812 runs at an average of 47.76. He was also a prominent player in the Hawke Cup for Nelson for many years, scoring 236 against North Canterbury in his last match, including six sixes and 29 fours.

It was published in 2000 as part of the first set of books in the Canongate Myth Series where contemporary authors rewrite ancient myths. In The Penelopiad, Penelope reminisces on the events of the Odyssey, life in Hades, Odysseus, Helen of Troy, and her relationships with her parents. A Greek chorus of the twelve maids, whom Odysseus believed were disloyal and whom Telemachus hanged, interrupt Penelope's narrative to express their view on events. The maids' interludes use a new genre each time, including a jump-rope rhyme, a lament, an idyll, a ballad, a lecture, a court trial and several types of songs. The novella's central themes include the effects of story-telling perspectives, double standards between the sexes and the classes, and the fairness of justice. Atwood had previously used characters and storylines from Greek mythology in fiction such as her novel The Robber Bride, short story The Elysium Lifestyle Mansions, and poems \\"Circe: Mud Poems\\" and \\"Helen of Troy Does Countertop Dancing.\\" She used Robert Graves' The Greek Myths and E. V. Rieu and D. C. H. Rieu's version of the Odyssey to prepare for this novella. The book was translated into 28 languages and released simultaneously around the world by 33 publishers. In the Canadian market, it peaked on the best seller lists at number one in Maclean's and number two in The Globe and Mail, but did not place on the New York Times Best Seller List in the American market. Some critics found the writing to be typical of Atwood or even one of her finest works, while others found some aspects, like the chorus of maids, disagreeable. A theatrical version was co-produced by the Canadian National Arts Centre and the British Royal Shakespeare Company. The play was performed at the Swan Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon and the National Arts Centre in Ottawa during the summer and fall of 2007 by an all-female cast led by director Josette Bushell-Mingo. In January 2012, the show opened in Toronto at Nightwood Theatre, with an all-female cast led by director Kelly Thornton and starring Megan Follows as Penelope.Hoile, Chrostopher. \\"The Penelopiad.\\" Reviews 2012: Stage Door, 18 Jan 2012. http://www.stage- door.com/Theatre/2012/Entries/2012/1/18_The_Penelopiad.html Thornton reprised the production in January and February 2013.\\"The Penelopiad.\\" Nightwood Theatre. http://www.nightwoodtheatre.net/index.php/whats_on/the_penelopiad  Background  Publisher Jamie Byng of Canongate Books solicited author Margaret Atwood to write a novella re-telling a classic myth of her choice. Byng explained it would be published simultaneously in several languages as part of an international project called the Canongate Myth Series. Atwood agreed to help the rising young publisher by participating in the project.. From her home in Toronto, the 64-year-old author made attempts at writing the Norse creation myth and a Native American story but struggled.. After speaking with her British literary agent about canceling her contract, Atwood began thinking about the Odyssey. She had first read it as a teenager and remembered finding the imagery of Penelope's twelve maids being hanged in the denouement disturbing. Atwood believed the roles of Penelope and her maids during Odysseus' absence had been a largely neglected scholarly topic and that she could help address it with this project.  Plot  Penelope in the Vatican Museums The novel recaps Penelope's life in hindsight from 21st century Hades; she recalls her family life in Sparta, her marriage to Odysseus, her dealing with suitors during his absence, and the aftermath of Odysseus' return. The relationship with her parents was challenging: her father became overly affectionate after attempting to murder her, and her mother was absent-minded and negligent. At fifteen, Penelope married Odysseus, who had rigged the contest that decided which suitor would marry her. Penelope was happy with him, even though he was mocked behind his back by Helen and some maids for his short stature and lesser developed home, Ithaca. The couple broke with tradition by moving to the husband's kingdom. In Ithaca, neither Odysseus' mother Anticleia, nor his nurse Eurycleia, liked Penelope but eventually Eurycleia helped Penelope settle into her new role and became friendly, but often patronising. Shortly after the birth of their son, Telemachus, Odysseus was called to war, leaving Penelope to run the kingdom and raise Telemachus alone. News of the war and rumours of Odysseus' journey back sporadically reached Ithaca and with the growing possibility that Odysseus was not returning an increasing number of suitors moved in to court Penelope. Convinced the suitors were more interested in controlling her kingdom than loving her, she stalled them. The suitors pressured her by consuming and wasting much of the kingdom's resources. She feared violence if she outright denied their offer of marriage so she announced she would make her decision on which to marry once she finished her father-in-law's shroud. She enlisted twelve maids to help her unravel the shroud at night and spy on the suitors. Odysseus eventually returned but in disguise. Penelope recognised him immediately and instructed her maids not to reveal his identity. After the suitors were massacred, Odysseus instructed Telemachus to execute the maids who he believed were in league with them. Twelve were hanged while Penelope slept. Afterwards, Penelope and Odysseus told each other stories of their time apart, but on the issue of the maids Penelope remained silent to avoid the appearance of sympathy for those already judged and condemned as traitors.. During her narrative, Penelope expresses opinions on several people, addresses historical misconceptions, and comments on life in Hades. She is most critical of Helen whom Penelope blames for ruining her life. Penelope identifies Odysseus' specialty as making people look like fools and wonders why his stories have survived so long, despite being an admitted liar. She dispels the rumour that she slept with Amphinomus and the rumour that she slept with all the suitors and consequently gave birth to Pan.Though not linguistically related, Pan's name (Œ†Œ¨ŒΩ) is virtually identical to the ancient Greek word œÄ·æ∂ŒΩ, meaning \\"all\\"; the apparent equivalence between the two words seems to have inspired the myth that Penelope slept with \\"all\\" the suitors, resulting in the god's birth. Between chapters in which Penelope is narrating, the twelve maids speak on topics from their point-of-view. They lament their childhood as slaves with no parents or playtime, sing of freedom, and dream of being princesses. They contrast their lives to Telemachus' and wonder if they would have killed him as a child if they knew he would kill them as a young man. They blame Penelope and Eurycleia for allowing them to unjustly die. In Hades, they haunt both Penelope and Odysseus.  Style  The novella is divided into 29 chapters with introduction, notes, and acknowledgments sections. Structured similarly to a classical Greek drama, the storytelling alternates between Penelope's narrative and the choral commentary of the twelve maids. Penelope narrates 18 chapters with the Chorus contributing 11 chapters dispersed throughout the book. The Chorus uses a new narrative style in each of their chapters, beginning with a jump-rope rhyme and ending in a 17-line iambic dimeter poem. Other narrative styles used by the Chorus include a lament, a folk song, an idyll, a sea shanty, a ballad, a drama, an anthropology lecture, a court trial, and a love song. Penelope's story uses simple and deliberately naive prose.. The tone is described as casual, wandering, and street-wise with Atwood's dry humour and characteristic bittersweet and melancholic feminist voice.. The book uses the first-person narrative, though Penelope sometimes addresses the reader through the second person pronoun.. One reviewer noted that Penelope is portrayed as \\"an intelligent woman who knows better than to exhibit her intelligence\\".. Because she contrasts past events as they occurred from her perspective with the elaborations of Odysseus and with what is recorded in myths today, she is described as a metafictional narrator..  Major themes  = Perspectives = The novella illustrates the differences perspectives can make. The stories told in the Odyssey by Nestor and Menelaus to Telemachus, and Odysseus to a Scherian court make Odysseus into a hero as he fights monsters and seduces goddesses. According to Penelope in The Penelopiad, Odysseus was a liar who drunkenly fought a one-eyed bartender then boasted it was a giant cannibalistic cyclops. Homer portrays Penelope as loyal, patient, and the ideal wife, as he contrasts her to Clytemnestra who killed Agamemnon upon his return from Troy.. In The Penelopiad, Penelope feels compelled to tell her story because she is unsatisfied with Homer's portrayal of her and the other myths about her sleeping with the suitors and giving birth to Pan. She rejects the role of the ideal wife and admits she was just trying to survive. The Odyssey makes the maids into traitors who consort with the suitors. From the maids' perspective, they were innocent victims, used by Penelope to spy, raped and abused by the suitors, and then murdered by Odysseus and Telemachus. Atwood shows the truth occupies a third position between the myths and the biased points of view. = Feminism and double standards = The book has been called \\"feminist\\", and more specifically \\"vintage Atwood-feminist\\", but Atwood disagrees, saying, \\"I wouldn't even call it feminist. Every time you write something from the point of view of a woman, people say that it's feminist.\\". The Penelopiad's antagonistic relationship between Penelope and Helen is similar to the relationships of women in Atwood's previous novels: Elaine and Cordelia in Cat's Eye, and Iris and Laura in The Blind Assassin, and follows Atwood's doubt of an amicable universal sisterhood. The story does endorse some feminist reassessments of the Odyssey, like Penelope recognizing Odysseus while disguised and that the geese slaughtered by the eagle in Penelope's dream were her maids and not the suitors. Using the maids' lecture on anthropology, Atwood satirizes Robert Graves' theory of a matriarchal lunar cult in Greek myth. The lecture makes a series of connections, concluding that the rape and execution of the maids by men represent the overthrow of the matriarchal society in favor of patriarchy. The lecture ends with lines from anthropologist Claude L√©vi-Strauss' Elementary Structures of Kinship: \\"Consider us pure symbol. We're no more real than money.\\". Double standards between genders and classes are exposed throughout the novella. Odysseus commits adultery with Circe while expecting Penelope to remain loyal to him. The maids' relations with the suitors are seen as treasonous and earn them an execution. Penelope condemns Helen for her involvement in getting men killed at Troy. At the same time, Penelope excuses her involvement in getting the maids killed even though, as Atwood reveals, Penelope enlisted the maids to spy on the suitors and even encouraged them to continue after some were raped. = Narrative justice = Penelope's story is an attempt at narrative justice to retribute Helen for her erroneously idealised image in the Odyssey as the archetypal female.. Penelope acts like a judicial arbiter, a position she held in Ithaca as the head of state and, during Odysseus' absence, as head of the household. The ancient form of justice and punishment, which was swift and simple due to the lack of courts, prisons, and currency, is tempered by more modern concepts of balanced distributions of social benefits and burdens. Penelope's chosen form of punishment for Helen is to correct the historical records with her own bias by portraying her as vain and superficial, as someone who measures her worth by the number of men who died fighting for her. The maids also deliver their version of narrative justice on Odysseus and Telemachus, who ordered and carried out their execution, and on Penelope who was complicit in their killing. The maids do not have the same sanctioned voice as Penelope and are relegated to unauthoritative genres, though their persistence eventually leads to more valued cultural forms. Their testimony, contrasted with Penelope's excuses while condemning Helen, demonstrates the tendency of judicial processes to not act upon the whole truth. When compared with the historical record, dominated by the stories in the Odyssey, the conclusion, as one academic states, is that the concepts of justice and penalties are established by \\"who has the power to say who is punished, whose ideas count\\", and that \\"justice is underwritten by social inequalities and inequitable power dynamics\\".  Influences  Atwood's use of myths follows archetypal literary criticism and specifically the work of Northrop Frye and his Anatomy of Criticism. According to this literary theory, contemporary works are not independent but are part of an underlying pattern that re- invents and adapts a finite number of timeless concepts and structures of meaning. In The Penelopiad, Atwood re-writes archetypes of female passivity and victimization while using contemporary ideas of justice and a variety of genres. The edition of the Odyssey that Atwood read was the E. V. Rieu and D. C. H. Rieu's translation. For research she consulted Robert Graves' The Greek Myths.. Graves, an adherent to Samuel Butler's theory that the Odyssey was written by a woman, also wrote The White Goddess, which formed the basis of the Maid's anthropology lecture.. Atwood seems to have been unaware of A D Hope's earlier intense moral questioning of the story of Odysseus hanging the maids. In Hope's 1960s poem \\"The End of the Journey\\" Penelope and Odysseus pass an unhappy night after the slaughter of the suitors and the maids, and wake to a scene of horror: \\"Each with her broken neck, each with a blank,/Small strangled face, the dead girls in a row /Swung as the cold airs moved them to and fro\\".The poem is on line at https://www.poetrylibrary.edu.au/poets/hope-a-d/the-end-of-a-journey-0146001 Atwood had previously written using themes and characters from ancient Greek myths. She wrote a short story in Ovid Metamorphosed called The Elysium Lifestyle Mansions re-telling a myth with Apollo and the immortal prophet the Sibyl from the perspective of the latter living in the modern age. Her 1993 novel The Robber Bride roughly parallels the Iliad but is set in Toronto. In that novel the characters Tony and Zenia share the same animosity and competition as Penelope and Helen in The Penelopiad. Her poem \\"Circe: Mud Poems\\", published in 1976, casts doubt on Penelope's honourable image: : She's up to something, she's weaving : histories, they are never right, : she has to do them over, : she is weaving her version[...]. Atwood published \\"Helen of Troy Does Counter Dancing\\" in her 1996 collection Morning in the Burned House in which Helen appears in a contemporary setting as an erotic dancer and justifies her exploitation as men fantasize over her: : You think I'm not a goddess? : Try me. : This is a torch song. : Touch me and you'll burn..  Publication  The hardcover version of The Penelopiad was published on 21 October 2005 as a part of the launch of Canongate Myth Series, which also included A History of Myth by Karen Armstrong and a third title chosen by each publisher (most chose Weight by Jeanette Winterson).. The Penelopiad was translated into 28 languages and released simultaneously around the world by 33 publishers, including Canongate Books in the UK, Knopf in Canada, Grove/Atlantic Inc. in the US, and Text Publishing in Australia and New Zealand. The French translation was published in Canada by √âditions du Bor√©al and in France by Groupe Flammarion.. The trade paperback was released in 2006. Laural Merlington narrated the 3-hour unabridged audiobook which was published by Brilliance Audio and released alongside the hardcover. Merlington's narration was positively received, though sometimes upstaged by the unnamed actresses voicing the maids..  Reception  On best seller lists in the Canadian market, the hardcover peaked at number one in MacLean's and number two in The Globe and Mail in the fiction category... In the American market the book did not place on the New York Times Best Seller list but was listed as an \\"Editors' Choice\\".. The book was nominated for the 2006 Mythopoeic Fantasy Award for Adult Literature and long-listed for the 2007 International Dublin Literary Award... The book's French translation was nominated at the 2006 Governor General's Literary Awards for best English to French translation. Some reviewers like Christopher Tayler and David Flusfeder, both writing for The Daily Telegraph, praised the book as \\"enjoyable [and] intelligent\\". with \\"Atwood at her finest\\".. Robert Wiersema echoed that sentiment, adding that the book shows Atwood as \\"fierce and ambitious, clever and thoughtful\\".. The review in the National Post called the book \\"a brilliant tour de force\\".. Specifically singled out as being good are the book's wit, rhythm, structure, and story.. Mary Beard found the book to be \\"brilliant\\" except for the chapter entitled \\"An Anthropology Lecture\\" which she called \\"complete rubbish\\".. Others criticised the book as being \\"merely a riff on a better story that comes dangerously close to being a spoof\\". and saying it \\"does not fare well [as a] colloquial feminist retelling\\".. Specifically, the scenes with the chorus of maidservants are said to be \\"mere outlines of characters\\" with Elizabeth Hand writing in The Washington Post that they have \\"the air of a failed Monty Python sketch\\".. In the journal English Studies, Odin Dekkers and L. R. Leavis described the book as \\"a piece of deliberate self-indulgence\\" that reads like \\"over-the-top W. S. Gilbert\\", comparing it to Wendy Cope's limericks reducing T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land to five lines..  Theatrical adaptation  Following a successful dramatic reading directed by Phyllida Lloyd at St James's Church, Piccadilly on 26 October 2005, Atwood finished a draft theatrical script.. The Canadian National Arts Centre and the British Royal Shakespeare Company expressed interest and both agreed to co- produce. Funding was raised mostly from nine Canadian women, dubbed the \\"Penelope Circle\\", who each donated CAD$50,000 to the National Arts Centre.. An all-female cast was selected consisting of seven Canadian and six British actors, with Josette Bushell-Mingo directing and Veronica Tennant as the choreographer. For music a trio, consisting of percussions, keyboard, and cello, were positioned above the stage. They assembled in Stratford-upon-Avon and rehearsed in June and July 2007.. The 100-minute play was staged at the Swan Theatre between 27 July and 18 August at the National Arts Centre in Ottawa between 17 September and 6 October. Atwood's script gave little stage direction allowing Bushell-Mingo to develop the action. Critics in both countries lauded Penny Downie's performance as Penelope, but found the play had too much narration of story rather than dramatisation... Adjustments made between productions resulted in the Canadian performance having emotional depth that was lacking in Bushell-Mingo's direction of the twelve maids... The play subsequently had runs in Vancouver at the Stanley Industrial Alliance Stage between October 26 and November 20, 2011,. and in Toronto, produced by the Nightwood Theatre and staged at Buddies in Bad Times Theatre between January 10‚Äì29, 2012.. The Nightwood Theatre show was directed by Kelly Thornton with choreography by Monica Dottor and starring Megan Follows. A review in The Globe and Mail gave the play 3.5 of 4 stars..

He was five times an Olympic Gold Medalist. He remained active in the sport after his retirement from competition. He served as vice president of the Japan Gymnastic Association. Tsukahara competed throughout the late 1960s and 1970s, retiring from gymnastics competition in 1978 after the World Championships. Winning five gold, one silver and three bronze medals, Tsukahara was an important contributor in Japan's win at the team competition in three consecutive Olympic Games: in 1968, 1972 and 1976. He married fellow gymnast Chieko Oda. He has remained connected to the gymnastics world, partly through his son Naoya Tsukahara, who was also a multi-medalist at the World Championships and Olympic Games throughout the late 1990s and who still competed as of 2014.Mitsuo Tsukahara. sports- reference.com Skills Tsukahara's name is one of the most famous in gymnastics due to its association with two widely performed skills. The first is the full-twisting double salto in the tuck position (with the full twist in the first salto). The Men's Gymnastics Code of Points credits Tsukahara for premiering this skill on floor exercise and horizontal bar, and he regularly performed it on these events throughout his career. In fact, in many nations, it is customary to call a full-twisting double salto tumble or dismount a \\"Tsukahara\\" on all apparatus, both for men and women. This skill is sometimes called a \\"Moon Somersault\\" or \\"Moon Salto\\". Tsukahara is also credited with having invented a vaulting technique called the \\"Tsukahara vault\\". This vault is generally described as a roundoff over the horse/table into a backward salto, with or without twist. However, until 2005, when the horse was replaced with a table, females usually performed Tsukahara-type vaults on the side horse with a half-twist entry onto the horse rather than a quarter twist entry. Tsukahara himself did this vault in a stretched position, generally without twist. The name \\"Tsukahara\\" is so strongly associated with the 1/4-on entry, that it is routinely misapplied to the more commonly used Kasamatsu- style vault, in which the 1/4 turn off the horse \\"untwists\\" so that the salto is initiated forwards or sideways. In fact, Tsukahara himself, who entered the horse on his left side but also twisted to the left, would have done a Kasamatsu vault if he had tried to twist. However, the Tsukahara style is certainly still very popular among gymnasts who: * do the basic vault in tucked, piked, or stretched position * twist the opposite direction of their entry side, e.g. Gervasio Deferr, who repeated as Olympic Vault Champion in 2004 by premiering the Tsukahara with 2.5 twists * do two saltos instead of just one, e.g. Leszek Blanik, the 2008 Olympic Vault Champion, who is one of many gymnasts to perform a Tsukahara double pike. Honors In November 2009, Tsukahara was awarded with a Medal of Honour with purple ribbon by the Government of Japan.

Saint Petersburg, 1892 Riccardo Eugenio Drigo (ru. –†–∏–∫–∫–∞—Ä–¥–æ –≠—É–¥–∂–µ–Ω—å–æ –î—Ä–∏–≥–æ) (30 June 18461 October 1930) was an Italian composer of ballet music and Italian opera, a theatrical conductor, and a pianist. Drigo is most noted for his long career as kapellmeister and Director of Music of the Imperial Ballet of Saint Petersburg, Russia, for which he composed music for the original works and revivals of the choreographers Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov. Drigo also served as Chef d'orchestre for Italian opera performances of the orchestra of the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre. During his career in Saint Petersburg, Drigo conducted the premieres and regular performances of nearly every ballet and Italian opera performed on the Tsarist stage. Drigo is equally noted for his original full-length compositions for the ballet as well as his large catalog of supplemental music written ad hoc for insertion into already-existing works. Drigo is also noted for his adaptations of already-existing scores, such as his 1895 edition of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's score for Swan Lake. Many pieces set to the music of Drigo are still performed today, and are considered cornerstones of the classical ballet repertory.  Life  Riccardo Eugenio Drigo was born in Padua, Italy on 30 June 1846. His father Silvio Drigo was a barrister and his mother, a noble Lupati, was active in politics. None of Drigo's family was distinguished in music, but at the age of five he began taking his first piano lessons from a family friend, the Hungarian Antonio Jorich. Drigo excelled quickly, and by his early teens he attained some local celebrity as a pianist. His father eventually agreed to allow Drigo to attend the prestigious Venice Conservatory, where he studied under Antonio Buzzolla, a student of Gaetano Donizetti. Drigo scored his first compositions in his early teens, which were primarily romances and waltzes. In 1862 he was allowed to perform some of his pieces with the local amateur orchestra in Padua. Through this performance, the young Drigo began to show interest in conducting. Drigo obtained his earliest position in an opera house as a rehearsal pianist and copyist to the Garibaldi Theatre, Padua in 1866. His first major opportunity as a theatrical conductor occurred in 1867 when the Garibaldi Theatre's kapellmeister fell ill on the eve of the premiere of Costantino Dall'Argine's three act opera bouffe I Due Orsi (The Two Bears). When the concertmaster refused to conduct the performance, he recommended Drigo, if only because the rehearsal pianist would know the score intimately. Drigo's conducting was successful, and soon he was named second kapellmeister. In 1878 during the opera season in Padua the director of the Saint Petersburg Imperial Theatres, Baron Karl Karlovich Kister, attended a performance of Donizetti's L'elisir d'amore which Drigo conducted. Kister was much impressed with Drigo's conducting talent, which was done without the aid of a score. Drigo then presented Kister with some of his own compositions, which prompted Kister to offer Drigo a six-month contract to conduct the Saint Petersburg Imperial Italian Opera.  Russia  Caricature of Riccardo Drigo from the book The Russian Ballet in Caricatures (–†—É—Å–∫—ñ–π –±–∞–ª–µ—Ç—ä –≤—ä –∫–∞—Ä–∏–∫–∞—Ç—É—Ä–∞—Ö—ä) by the brothers Œùikolai and Sergei Legat. Almost immediately after arriving in Saint Petersburg, Drigo was conducting the entire repertory of the Imperial Italian Opera, which at that time performed at the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre. He impressed the management a great deal, conducting such works as Verdi's Aida and Un ballo in maschera from memory. It was custom in Imperial Russia for all theatrical performances to be reported in detail in the newspapers, and Drigo's performances were always reported with praise ‚Äî \\" ... the young gentleman will stay here a long time ...\\" commented one columnist after attending an opera which Drigo conducted.  Composer and conductor  The Imperial Italian Opera was disbanded by Emperor Alexander III in 1884 in an effort to solidify the art of Russian operetta. This left Drigo, the company's kapellmeister, without a position. In 1886 the Saint Petersburg Imperial Ballet's kapellmeister, Alexei Papkov, retired after thirty-four years of service, leaving the company without a principal conductor. Drigo took over the position before the beginning of the 1886‚Äì1887 season, making his debut as ballet conductor on with a performance of the old grand ballet The Pharaoh's Daughter, set to the score of Cesare Pugni, which was the most popular work in the repertory of the Imperial Ballet. In attendance for the performance was the Emperor and the Empress Maria Fyodorovna, both of whom were fanatic balletomanes and maintained the Imperial Theatres lavishly. So impressed was the Emperor by Drigo's conducting that during the final curtain calls he gave the conductor a standing ovation, and ordered the rest of the house to follow suit. The Imperial Theatre's official composer of ballet music, the Austrian Ludwig Minkus, retired from his post in 1886. The director of the Saint Peterbsurg Imperial Theatres, Ivan Vsevolozhsky then abolished the position of staff ballet composer in an effort to diversify the music supplied for new works. Since Drigo was well known as a composer, Vsevolozhsky employed him in the dual capacity of kapellmeister and Director of Music, a position which would require Drigo to fulfill all of the duties of the staff composer with regard to adapting and correcting scores at the behest of the Ballet Master. The Imperial Theatre's renowned Premier Ma√Ætre de Ballet, the Frenchman Marius Petipa, revived Jules Perrot's 1841 romantic masterpiece La Esmeralda for the visiting Italian ballerina Virginia Zucchi in 1886. For the revival Drigo was assigned the task of refurbishing the old score of Cesare Pugni. Drigo was commissioned to compose a four-part Pas d'action to showcase the dramatic gifts of the ballerina Zucchi that also included virtuoso solos for violin and cello, with the violin solo crafted especially for the great Leopold Auer, principal violinist in the Imperial Theatre's orchestra. The revival of La Esmeralda premiered to great success on with the Imperial family in attendance. Drigo's Pas d'action remains part of the performance score for La Esmeralda to the present day, and is often extracted from the full-length work as La Esmeralda Pas de Six. Photograph of Drigo (person to right wearing white) and orchestra of Imperial Mariinsky Theatre from the Yearbook of the Imperial Theatres. Saint Petersburg, ca. 1905 With the success of his work on the score of La Esmeralda, the director Vsevolozhsky gave Drigo his first commission to compose for a complete ballet score. This was La For√™t enchant√©e (The Enchanted Forest), which was not only Drigo's first full-length ballet but also the first original work choreographed by the Imperial Theatre's newly appointed second Ma√Ætre de Ballet Lev Ivanov. La For√™t enchant√©e was staged especially for the annual graduation performance of the Imperial Ballet School, with the top graduates in the leading roles. The work premiered on on the stage of the school's theatre, and was subsequently transferred to the stage of the Mariinsky Theatre, where it premiered on with the Italian ballerina Emma Bessone in the lead role of Ilka. Although Ivanov's choreography was not well-received, Drigo's score was highly praised. A critic from the Saint Petersburg newspaper The New Time reviewed that In 1888 Marius Petipa was preparing his next work, La Vestale, set in the ancient Roman Empire. The score was written by the music critic Mikhail Ivanov, who provided what was at that time considered to be a highly symphonic score for ballet. The work was produced for the Italian Elena Cornalba, who appealed to Petipa for additional, more dansante music for her solo numbers. Having just witnessed a performance of La For√™t enchant√©e, she requested that Drigo should be the composer responsible for the supplemental dances she required. Drigo composed two additional variations for Cornalba known as L'echo (The Echo), which was written as a canon; and a Valse mignonne (Sweet Waltz). Drigo also wrote an extra variation for the character of Cupid known as L'amour, and a variation for the ballerina Maria Gorshenkova. Three of these pieces were later published. =Le Talisman= Vaslav Nijinsky costumed as the God Vayou in Nikolai Legat's revival of the Drigo/Petipa Le Talisman. Saint Petersburg, 1909 When plans were made for the next ballet starring Elena Cornalba, the ballerina requested that Drigo should be the composer responsible for the entire score. This was Le Talisman (The Talisman), a work which told the story of a Hindu Goddess who descends from heaven in order to test her heart against the temptations of earthly love. The ballet premiered on on the occasion of Cornalba's benefit performance. Despite a sumptuous production with many inspired choreographic episodes, the ballet's plot was something that critics and audiences alike found tedious. Nevertheless, Drigo's score was hailed as a masterwork of ballet music by contemporary critics. The artist Alexander Benois told in his memoirs of his extreme delight with Drigo's score, which he said inspired a \\"short infatuation\\" in him as a young student at Saint Petersburg State University: In the ensuing years, Drigo repeatedly received commissions from both Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov to compose supplemental variations, pas and incidental dances for insertion into older ballets. By the time Drigo left Russia in 1919, nearly every ballet in the repertory of the Saint Petersburg Imperial Theatres contained many of the composer's own additional pieces. Drigo later commented in his memoirs that he composed about 80 such pieces, and rarely received any additional payment for them. During the late 19th century, Petipa began to mount revivals of older ballets with increasing frequency, and the ballet master invariably called upon Drigo to revise and supplement the scores accordingly. Drigo took up residence in the Saint Petersburg Grand Hotel in 1889, which was to remain his home for the next thirty years. It was at this time that Drigo developed a close friendship with Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, who was in the process of composing the score for Petipa's The Sleeping Beauty. On the eve of the general rehearsal of the ballet Drigo fell ill, and asked Tchaikovsky if he could conduct the orchestra himself. To Drigo's astonishment Tchaikovsky insisted that if he conducted the orchestra he would ruin his score, and so Drigo, still ill, consented to conduct the rehearsal. The shy and reserved Tchaikovsky was ever after grateful to Drigo for his exceptional conducting, particularly after the premiere on . Drigo eventually conducted nearly 300 performances of The Sleeping Beauty at the Mariinsky Theatre. Two years later Drigo conducted the premiere of Tchaikovsky's next work, The Nutcracker, on . =La Fl√ªte magique and Le R√©veil de Flore= Drigo composed another score for the annual graduation performance of the Imperial Ballet school in 1893. This was the one-act ballet La Fl√ªte magique (The Magic Flute), which told the story of an enchanted instrument that compelled all within earshot to dance when it was played. The ballet was staged by Lev Ivanov, and premiered on to great success on the stage of the ballet school's theatre. Among the cast was a young Mikhail Fokine in the lead role of Luc. Due to the success of the student performance, La Fl√ªte magique was transferred to the Mariinsky Theatre, where it was presented in an expanded staging on . Drigo's score was highly praised by critics: Drigo's next score was written for Petipa's ballet Le R√©veil de Flore (The Awakening of Flora), an anacreontic ballet in one-act that was produced especially for the celebrations held at Peterhof Palace in honor of the wedding of the Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna to the Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich. The premiere on was a grand occasion, with an audience composed of the whole of the Imperial court. For his score for Le R√©veil de Flore, Emperor Alexander III granted Drigo the Order of St. Anna. Page from the illustrated libretto for Riccardo Drigo's ballet La Perle, taken from the program for the celebrations held at the Imperial Bolshoi Theatre of Moscow in honor of the coronation of Tsar Nicholas II and Empress Alexandra Fyodorovna. As with La Fl√ªte magique, Le R√©veil de Flore was transferred to the stage of the Mariinsky Theatre, where it was given for the first time on . The ballet soon became a favorite of the ballerinas of the era, among them Mathilde Kschessinska (who created the principal role of Flora), Tamara Karsavina and particularly Anna Pavlova, who included an abridged version of the work on her legendary world tours. = Swan Lake= In late 1894 Drigo prepared an important revision of Tchaikovsky's score for Swan Lake, originally produced at the Imperial Bolshoi Theatre of Moscow in 1877. Following the success of The Sleeping Beauty and The Nutcracker, Ivan Vsevolozhsky‚Äîdirector of the Saint Petersburg Theatres‚Äîexpressed interest in reviving the ballet. Drigo later recalled: Tchaikovsky died on just as plans to revive Swan Lake were beginning to come to fruition. A revival of the complete work was then planned for the Imperial Ballet's 1894‚Äì1895 season, in a staging by Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov. Tchaikovsky's brother Modest approved that Drigo should be entrusted with the task of revising the score, which the composer did in accordance with Petipa's instructions. In his memoirs Drigo touched on his revision to the score: The revival premiered on at the Mariinsky Theatre with the Prima ballerina assoluta Pierina Legnani in the dual role of Odette/Odile. Drigo's version of Tchaikovsky's score has remained the definitive performance edition of Swan Lake, and is still used to one degree or another by ballet companies throughout the world. Nevertheless, Drigo is rarely given credit when his revisions are performed. =La Perle= Drigo's next score for the ballet was the grand piece d'occasion La Perle (sometimes known in Russian as –ü—Ä–µ–ª–µ—Å—Ç–Ω–∞—è –∂–µ–º—á—É–∂–∏–Ω–∞ ‚Äî Pretty Pearl), produced especially for the gala held at the Imperial Bolshoi Theatre of Moscow in honor of the coronation of Tsar Nicholas II and Empress Alexandra Fyodorovna. The ballet premiered on after a performance of Glinka's A Life for the Tsar. Alexander Shiryaev costumed as Harlequin in the Drigo/Petipa Les millions d'Arlequin. Here, Shiryaev is holding a prop guitar from the ballet's famous S√©r√©nade. Saint Petersburg, circa 1905 =Les Millions d'Arl√©quin= In 1899 Petipa began work on the scenario for a ballet based on episodes from the Italian commedia dell‚Äôarte, which he called Les Millions d'Arl√©quin (The Millions of Harlequin). The ballet premiered at the Imperial Theatre of the Hermitage on with Mathilde Kschessinska in the role of Columbine and the danseur Gyorgy Kyaksht in the role of Harlequin. The audience included the Emperor and Empress as well as the whole of the Imperial court. Within moments of the final curtain, the typically subdued courtly audience erupted into thunderous applause. The composer received a tumultuous reception as he went before the curtain and was mobbed by several Grand Dukes who tripped over one another in their enthusiasm to congratulate him for his music. Due to her delight in Drigo's score, the Empress commanded two additional court performances of Les Millions d'Arl√©quin on the stage of the Mariinsky Theatre, the first given on . When plans were under way to publish Drigo's score in piano reduction by the publisher Zimmermann, many of Drigo's colleagues urged the composer to dedicate his score to the Empress. Drigo's request was then submitted to the Minister of the Imperial Court, which brought about a lengthy correspondence by a commission set up to investigate whether or not Drigo's character, background and music were worthy of his offering a dedication to a Russian Empress. The response was favorable and the dedication was graciously accepted.  Later years in Russia  In the spring of 1902, Drigo and a group of dancers from the Imperial Ballet were invited by Raoul Gunsbourg, director of the Op√©ra de Monte-Carlo, to produce a ballet in Monaco. Drigo composed the music for the ballet-divertissement titled La C√¥te d'Azur (The French Riviera), set to a libretto by Prince Albert I. The ballet premiered at the Salle Garnier on 30 March 1902, and featured the Prima ballerina Olga Preobrajenska. Drigo's final original full-length ballet score was also Marius Petipa's final work ‚Äî the fantastical La Romance d'un Bouton de rose et d'un Papillon (The Romance of a Rosebud and a Butterfly). The ballet was to have had its premiere at the Imperial Theatre of the Hermitage on but was abruptly canceled, the official reason given being the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War. Maestro Riccardo Eugenio Drigo. Saint Petersburg, 1903 Drigo was vacationing in his native Italy during the outbreak of World War I in 1914, which prevented him from returning to Russia for another two years. Soon after his arrival in Petrograd he was evicted from his home at the Grand Hotel, which was converted to offices for the newly established Soviet government. For a time Drigo was forced to live in considerable poverty in a camp with a group of his fellow Italian √©migr√©s. He later recalled in his memoirs of the many cold evenings he spent with his close friend and colleague Alexander Glazunov waiting for hours in bread lines and subsequently carrying their rations home through the snow on a sled. Upon his first engagement as conductor after his return to the former Imperial Mariinsky Theatre, Drigo received a fifteen-minute standing ovation from the audience.  Drigo returns to Italy  In 1919 Drigo was finally repatriated to his native Italy. For his farewell gala at the former Imperial Mariinsky Theatre, the Ballet Master Fyodor Lopukhov mounted a new version of Drigo and Petipa's final collaboration, the ballet La Romance d'un Bouton de rose et d'un Papillon which Lopukhov staged under the title Le Conte du bouton (The Tale of the Rosebud). At the close of the gala, the renowned bass Feodor Chaliapin read an emotional farewell speech in both Italian and Russian. Allowed to take only 60 kilograms with him, Drigo left all of his belongings in Russia with the exception of a collection of his manuscript scores, which he used as a pillow during his two-month journey to Padua via Odessa and Constantinople. In 1920 Drigo accepted the post of kapellmeister to the Teatro Garibaldi in Padua where he had begun his career many years before. In 1926 he composed the comic opera Flaffy Raffles for the Opera company of Padua's Teatro Verdi, and in 1929 his last work was given, the opera Il garofano bianco (The White Carnation) at the Teatro Garibaldi. He spent the remainder of his life conducting and composing masses and various songs. Riccardo Drigo died on 1 October 1930 at the age of 84, in his birthplace, Padua. There is now a street in Padua which is named Via Riccardo Drigo in his honor.

They grow naturally in New Guinea, New Caledonia, Australia, Torres Strait Islands, Fiji, Samoa, Sulawesi, Micronesia. Many species have been threatened with extinction globally or nationally, with official recognition by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and several national and state governments. Tuckeroo is a common name suffix for some species in Australia. C. anacardioides has been introduced into the United States, where in some parts they are invasive plants, primarily in Florida and Hawaii, where the common name Carrotwood applies. Conservation At global, national and government regional scales, many Cupaniopsis species have been threatened with extinction, as officially recognised by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), governments of Australia, New Caledonia and so on. Globally, the New Caledonian endemic species C. crassivalvis has become extinct according to the IUCN's 1998 assessment. Seven species endemic to New Caledonia have become endangered with global extinction according to the IUCN's 1998 assessments. Five species endemic to New Guinea, one endemic to New Caledonia and one endemic to Sulawesi have become vulnerable to global extinction according to the IUCN's 1998 and 2010 assessments. In Australia, C. shirleyana and C. tomentella, small trees endemic to small areas of southeastern Queensland (Qld), have obtained the \\"vulnerable\\" species Australian government's national conservation status and together also with C. cooperorum, the Qld government's \\"vulnerable\\" species state conservation status. C. newmannii small trees in eastern Qld have obtained the Qld government's \\"near threatened\\" species state conservation status. C. serrata small trees in northeastern New South Wales (NSW) have obtained the NSW government's \\"endangered\\" species state conservation status.

It is owned by Newhouse Newspapers, a division of Advance Publications. During the 19th century the paper, once the largest circulating daily in New England, played a key role in the United States Republican Party's founding, Charles Dow's career, and the invention of the honorific \\"Ms.\\" Despite the decline of printed media, The Republican was the 69th largest newspaper in 2017 with a circulation of 76,353, and has seen marked growth in its digital platform affiliate MassLive, with a record 6 million unique monthly visitors in June 2019. Beginning Established by Samuel Bowles II in 1824 as a rural weekly, it was converted into a daily in 1844. From the beginning it had a focus on local news. As rapidly as possible its news-gathering was extended until within a few years its columns contained departments of items from every town and hamlet along the Connecticut Valley, as well as from Springfield. It achieved national renown in the 19th century under the tenure of Samuel Bowles III, a legacy that was passed to his son, Samuel Bowles IV. Politics Samuel Bowles, transformed the paper into the largest circulating daily in New England by the mid-19th century, and is remembered for his influence on abolitionism and the Republican Party, as well as his mantra for journalists‚Äî\\"Put it all in the first sentence.\\" The historic Republican Block was home to The Republican from 1858 to 1867 The Springfield Republican as it appeared during the Reconstruction era, 1865 In 1855, Bowles III called for the founding of a new party that would abolish slavery. He suggested the name \\"Republican\\". Once abolitionists founded a party by this name, The Republican became one if its most unrelenting supporters. Bowles III believed that the newspaper should be a power in the moral, religious, and literary, as well as the political life of the community, and he tried to make his paper fulfill those functions. With the aid of J. G. Holland and others who joined the staff the paper attained excellent literary quality and a high moral tone. Its opinions soon reached all New England, and after the formation of the Republican party they extended far beyond the limits of any section. During the controversies affecting slavery and resulting in the American Civil War, Bowles supported, in general, the Whig and Republican parties, but in the period of Reconstruction under President Ulysses S. Grant, his paper represented anti-administration or Liberal Republican opinions, while in the disputed election of 1876 it favored the claims of Samuel J. Tilden, and subsequently became independent in politics. Its editorial board endorsed the Democratic candidate for president in every modern election except the 2008 election, in which it endorsed John McCain, but subsequently endorsed Barack Obama in the 2012 election. Other During Bowles' lifetime, and subsequently, the Republican office was a sort of school for young journalists, especially in the matter of pungency and conciseness of style, one of his maxims being: \\"put it all in the first paragraph\\". Bowles was an acquaintance of Emily Dickinson, and he published a handful of the very few poems by the poet printed in her lifetime, including \\"A narrow fellow in the grass\\" and \\"Safe in their alabaster chambers\\". Bowles was succeeded as publisher and editor-in-chief of the Republican by his son Samuel Bowles (b. 1851). Charles Dow, founder of Dow Jones and The Wall Street Journal, started his career as a business reporter for the Springfield Daily Republican, as an apprentice to the newspaper's then-owner, Samuel Bowles III. The title \\"Ms.\\" was first suggested by an anonymous 1901 letter to The Republican. The letter read, in part, \\"To call a maiden Mrs. is only a shade worse than to insult a matron with the inferior title Miss. Yet it is not always easy to know the facts... The abbreviation 'Ms.' is simple, it is easy to write, and the person concerned can translate it properly according to the circumstances.\\" The second half of the 20th century saw the consolidation of Springfield's newspapers. The Republican became part of two other local papers. The Springfield Daily News and the Morning Union merged in the 1970s, briefly operating as separate papers, even endorsing different candidates for the same offices. Eventually the two editions were combined into The Union- News (a morning paper) in 1988, with The Sunday Republican being published on Sundays. An organization called the Springfield Newspapers became the local division of the Newhouse family empire. The newspaper was formerly known as The Springfield Union News & Sunday Republican. The Republican launched the careers of several prominent journalists and novelists. I. E. \\"Sy\\" Sanborn, longtime Chicago sportswriter and one of the original organizers of the Baseball Writers' Association of America in 1908, began his career at The Republican. Radio's \\"poet laureate\\" Norman Corwin was a reporter for The Republican in the 1930s. Novelist Tom Wolfe was a reporter for The Springfield Union in the late 1950s. The newspaper reverted to its historical, pre-Union-News name of The Republican around 2001. George Arwady became publisher of The Republican on December 31, 2009; he was previously publisher of The Newark Star-Ledger. In 2019, the New England Newspaper Association awarded The Republican, the \\"Newspaper of the Year\\" title as a daily, and among Sunday newspapers, for its investigative reporting on the Springfield Police Department controversies earlier that year. Cynthia G. Simison was named the newspaper's first woman executive editor in 2020.

They were founding members of the Northamptonshire League in 1895, and played in the United Counties League Division One until 2011‚Äì12. History The club was formed as Rothwell Town Swifts in 1895 and the club were founder members of the Northamptonshire League. The club's nickname, the Bones, derives from the bone crypt in the town‚Äôs Holy Trinity Church, one of only two medieval ossuaries in the country; the other being at St Leonards, Hythe, Kent. Although financial difficulties led to the club switching between senior and junior football on several occasions, they did manage to achieve several runners-up positions during their stay in the Northants League. In 1933 the club dropped down to the Kettering League, which they won in 1937. In 1948 they returned to senior football, spending two seasons in the Leicestershire Senior League before becoming founder members of the United Counties League in 1950. The club's home stadium During their time in the United Counties League Rothwell achieved five runners-up finishes and finally claimed the league title in 1992‚Äì1993, a feat which they repeated the following year. Following their second title win, the club stepped up to the Southern League. In 1997 Rothwell finished second in the Midland Division and were promoted to the Premier Division, where they spent three seasons. Since their relegation from the Premier Division in 2000 they played in the Eastern Division, the Western Division, and from 2006 the newly formed Division One Midlands, until resigning from the League at the end of the 2009‚Äì2010 season. They rejoined the United Counties League in Division One. The club appointed former Corby Town manager Rob Dunion as their new manager in June 2008. Season 2009‚Äì2010 saw Rothwell struggle both on and off the pitch. In the league they finished in the bottom four and financial crisis kicked in with the club's main stream of revenue‚Äîthe social club becoming unavailable for public use. In the summer of 2010 Rothwell resigned from the Southern League and applied to join the United Counties League in which they were successful.

He was the lead singer for The Heptones in the 1960s and 1970s. In addition to his work with The Heptones, Sibbles was a session bassist and arranger at Clement \\"Coxsone\\" Dodd's Jamaica Recording and Publishing Studio and the associated Studio One label during the prolific late 1960s, and was described as \\"the greatest all-round talent in reggae history\\" by Kevin O'Brien Chang and Wayne Chen in their 1998 book Reggae Routes.Chang & Chen, p. 181. Biography The son of a grocer, Sibbles began singing in the 1950s and also played guitar, having been taught by Trench Town Rastas Brother Huntley and \\"Carrot\\". Barry Llewellyn and Earl Morgan had formed The Heptones in 1958, and Sibbles was in a rival group along with two friends. Sibbles joined The Heptones in 1965 after the two groups competed in a street-corner contest.Thompson, p. 114. The trio made their first recordings for Ken Lack in 1966 with \\"School Girls\\" and \\"Gun Man Coming to Town\\", the latter the A-side of their d√©but single. Though the songs did not achieve hit status, the latter composition made the playlists at Radio Jamaica Rediffusion (RJR). They moved on to Clement \\"Coxsone\\" Dodd's Studio One where they stayed until 1971. The Heptones were among the most influential groups of the rock steady era,Chang & Chen, p. 39.Kenner, 1997. along with The Pioneers, The Gaylads, The Paragons, The Uniques, and The Techniques. Signature Heptones songs included \\"Baby\\", \\"Get in the Groove\\", \\"Ting a Ling\\", \\"Fattie Fattie\\", \\"Got to Fight On (To the Top)\\", \\"Party Time\\", and \\"Sweet Talking\\".Cooke, 2006. The group's Studio One output has been collected on albums The Heptones, On Top, Ting a Ling, Freedom Line, and the Heartbeat Records anthology, Sea of Love. =Studio One= Beyond his work as a singer-songwriter, Sibbles contributed to the collective output of Studio One as a bass player during the late 1960s.Walker, p. 158. Keyboardist and arranger Jackie Mittoo encouraged Sibbles to play the bass when he needed a bassist for his Jazz trio.Barrow & Dalton, p. 68. When Mittoo left full-time duties at Studio One, Sibbles auditioned singers, arranged sessions, sang harmony, and played bass as a part of the studio group variously known as the Sound Dimension and Soul Vendors.Bradley, p. 217. These musicians, with engineering supervision Sylvan Morris, played backing tracks used by vocalists Bob Andy, Alton Ellis, Horace Andy, Carlton Manning, The Abyssinians, The Gladiators, Willi Williams, Ken Boothe, John Holt, Burning Spear, Dennis Brown, Slim Smith, and scores of others. Sibbles was a contributor to tracks including \\"Freedom Blues\\" (which evolved into the Jamaican rhythm known as \\"MPLA\\") by Roy Richards, \\"Love Me Forever\\" by Carlton & The Shoes, \\"Satta Massagana\\" and \\"Declaration of Rights\\" by the Abyssinians, \\"Stars\\" and \\"Queen of the Minstrels\\" by The Eternals, \\"Ten to One\\" by the Mad Lads,Keyes, p. 54. \\"Door Peep (Shall Not Enter)\\" by Burning Spear, and the instrumental \\"Full Up\\", which was used by Musical Youth for their huge worldwide hit \\"Pass the Dutchie\\". Because of the Jamaican process of versioning and the liberal recycling of rhythms in subsequent years, many of the songs, rhythms, and melodies written and recorded during the rocksteady era, the aforementioned in particular, continue to be referenced today. The most frequently referenced of Sibbles' bass lines is that found on the instrumental \\"Full Up\\", popularised internationally by Musical Youth's recording of \\"Pass the Dutchie\\", an adaptation of Mighty Diamonds' \\"Pass the Kouchie\\". Sibbles' legacy also endures in Horace Andy's tribute to him, \\"Mr. Bassie\\". (While Sibbles has been credited with the original \\"Real Rock\\" bassline, this was more likely performed by Boris Gardiner). The bass parts Sibbles and others developed in rocksteady used a rhythmic space found in later roots reggae, where the notes were not necessarily played or sustained on each downbeat of a 4/4 measure. Sibbles has explained that his style was to lag the downbeat slightly. Other musicians involved in the Studio One rock steady sessions included Richard Ace and Robbie Lyn on keyboards; Bunny Williams, Joe Isaacs, and Fil Callendar on drums; Eric Frater and Ernest Ranglin on guitar; and the horn section of Felix \\"Deadly Headley\\" Bennett on saxophone and Vin Gordon (a.k.a. \\"Don D. Jr.\\") on trombone. =Work with other producers= After Studio One, Sibbles and the Heptones recorded for other producers including Lee Perry,Bradley, p. 327. Harry J, JoJo Hoo Kim, Niney The Observer, Clive Chin, Gussie Clarke, Lloyd Campbell, Prince Buster, Ossie Hibbert, Phil Pratt, Harry Mudie, Geoffrey Chung, Danny Holloway, Rupie Edwards, and Joe Gibbs.Thompson, p. 115 Other Heptones releases from the early 1970s were Book of Rules (Trojan Records) and the Harry Johnson-produced album Cool Rasta (Trojan), recorded just before the group benefited from the internationalisation of reggae via Island Records. Danny Holloway produced Night Food and Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry-produced Party Time were the fruit of the association with Island. As a solo artist, Sibbles worked with Lloyd \\"Bullwackie\\" Barnes,Barrow & Dalton, p. 426. Lloyd Parks, Sly & Robbie, Augustus Pablo, Bruce Cockburn, and Lee Perry, but primarily produced himself. Sibbles moved to Canada in 1973, where he married and remained for twenty years, and won a U-Know Award for best male vocalist in 1983, and a Juno Award for best reggae album in 1987.Katz, pp. 262‚Äì63.Quill, 2009. He left the Heptones in 1976, midway through a US tour. Also in Canada, he recorded an album for A&M; and licensed several albums to Pete Weston's Micron label, including Now and Strictly Roots. In 1990 he collaborated on the one-off single \\"Can't Repress the Cause\\", a plea for greater inclusion of hip hop music in the Canadian music scene, with Dance Appeal, a supergroup of Toronto- area musicians that included Devon, Maestro Fresh Wes, Dream Warriors, B-Kool, Michie Mee, Lillian Allen, Eria Fachin, HDV, Dionne, Thando Hyman, Carla Marshall, Messenjah, Jillian Mendez, Lorraine Scott, Lorraine Segato, Self Defense, Zama and Thyron Lee White.\\"Urban Music\\" . The Canadian Encyclopedia. Sibbles continued to visit Jamaica, and performed at Reggae Sunsplash in 1980, 1981, 1983, 1986, and 1990. He returned to the Heptones in 1991. In 1996 he recorded \\"Original Full Up\\" with Beenie Man. Sibbles is featured in the 2009 documentary Rocksteady: The Roots of Reggae.

Osler was a founder and benefactor of the Royal Ontario Museum  Early life  Osler was born at Bond Head, Upper Canada near Tecumseh Township, Simcoe County, Canada West in 1845. He was the fourth son of Featherstone Lake Osler, a former lieutenant in the Royal Navy turned Anglican Reverend, and Ellen Free Pickton. Osler attended grammar school in Dundas, Upper Canada. Unlike his elder brothers he did not attend university.  Financial career  In the late 1850s, Osler began his career as a clerk at the Bank of Upper Canada. The bank failed in 1866. Osler became business partners with his colleague Henry Pellat and together they launched their own firm specializing in stockbroking, investment, and insurance services. Osler often served as a financier in numerous business ventures. Throughout the 1880s to 1890s, Osler greatly increased his financial influence through a combination of investments, westward railway expansions, and western land grants. Osler was an early shareholder of the Dominion Bank and gained a directorship with the bank in 1881. He would become the bank‚Äôs president in 1901. Beginning in the 1880s, Osler began working in the transportation industry through railways. Osler was the founder and managing director of the Ontario and Qu'Appelle Land Company Limited. His business expertise and connections led to his presidency of the Ontario and Quebec Railway followed by a directorship with the Canadian Pacific Railway. In 1896, Osler became the president of the Board of Trade. Osler was also the president of the Toronto Ferry Company.  Political career  Due to his financial success, many believed that Osler should enter politics. Osler began his political career in the 1892 mayoralty race. He lost to R.J. Fleming despite having the support of the Toronto establishment. Osler ran in the 1896 federal election and was elected to the House of Commons of Canada as the Conservative representative of West Toronto. He served as an MP until 1917. Osler was knighted in 1912.  Later life  After his political retirement, Osler continued to have an active involvement in Canadian business. By 1921, Osler concurrently held directorships in eight companies, presidencies in another three, and vice-presidency in one. Osler died in 1924 at the age of 78. At the time of his death, his estate was valued at nearly $4 million. In the years prior to his death, Osler had promised money to his friends to support various funds and causes which were posthumously covered by his estate.  Philanthropy  Beginning in the 1870s Osler became involved with philanthropy. His expertise as a successful businessman helped fund and support important causes related to arts, cultures, and health in the city of Toronto. Osler became a trustee for the Hospital for Sick Children in 1878. He also helped fund the new Toronto General Hospital. Osler lived in the Toronto neighbourhood of Rosedale at his estate Craigleigh. The Osler family donated the estate to the City of Toronto government after Osler's death; today the site of Craigleigh Gardens. Osler was a founder and generous benefactor to the Royal Ontario Museum. Together with George Agnew Reid, Byron Edmund Walker and others, Osler participated in the campaign to found an art museum in Toronto in the early 1900s. Osler began his involvement on a trip to Egypt from 1906 to 1907 where he met Charles T. Currelly, archaeologist and future director of the Royal Ontario Museum. In 1909 Osler personally pledged $50 000 over five years to assist with the collection of artefacts for the future museum. Osler would further contribute in 1912 by donating a large collection of paintings by Paul Kane to the cause. Through Osler‚Äôs and others influence, the Crown passed the Royal Ontario Museum Act in 1912 which led to the opening of the Royal Ontario Museum in 1914. Osler's descendants, the Matthews family, continue to support the museum to the present day. The museum‚Äôs Sir Edmund Osler Gate to the wing of the Matthews Family Court of Chinese Sculpture is named after him.  Personal life  Osler was born at Tecumseh Township, Simcoe County, Canada West and grew up in the area of present-day Hamilton, Ontario. His brothers were Britton Bath Osler (founder of Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt), and doctor Sir William Osler. Osler was married twice. He married his first wife, Isabella Lammond Smith, in 1868. Smith and Osler had two children who died in infancy and Smith died in 1871. In 1873, Osler married Annie Farquarson (1848 ‚Äì 1910). The couple had six children; three daughters and three sons. Osler‚Äôs grandson, Edmund Boyd Osler (1919-1987), was a Liberal member of the Canadian House of Commons for Winnipeg South Centre and his granddaughter, Anne Wilkinson (1910-1961), was a highly regarded Canadian poet. Osler descended from a British family with a long naval tradition. Edmund's great grandfather, Edward Osler, was variously described as either a merchant seaman or a pirate. One of Edmund's uncles served as a medical officer in the Navy and wrote the Life of Lord Exmouth and the poem The Voyage. Osler‚Äôs father was Featherstone Lake Osler (1805‚Äì1895). Featherstone was the son of a ship owner from Falmouth, Cornwall. Featherstone formerly served in the Royal Navy as a Lieutenant on the H.M.S. Victory. In 1831 Featherstone Osler was invited to serve on H.M.S. Beagle as the science officer on Charles Darwin's historic voyage to the Gal√°pagos Islands, but turned it down as his father was dying. Featherstone retired from the navy in 1837 and emigrated to Canada. Featherstone married Ellen Free Pickton and they had four sons, Edmund was their youngest. In Canada, Featherstone became an Anglican Reverend.

Life Altick was born in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, an area he would later recall in Of a Place and a Time (1991). He graduated from Franklin and Marshall College in 1936 and received a Ph.D. in English from the University of Pennsylvania in 1941 with a dissertation on the 18th-century poet Richard Owen Cambridge. He returned to Franklin and Marshall in 1941 to teach, but in 1945 joined the English faculty of Ohio State University, where he would remain until his retirement in 1982. Altick's graduate course in bibliography and research methods, English 980, became known for the strenuous demands he made upon his students. Many of the materials developed for that course found their way into The Art of Literary Research, published in 1963. Ohio State would ultimately bestow upon Altick the title of Regents Professor of English, the only member of the English department to be so honored. Despite infirmities that made writing difficult in his last years, he persisted in reviewing books for such papers as the Times Literary Supplement, maintaining correspondence, and assisted other scholars with their work. Works One of Altick's most enduringly popular books was written during his first years at Ohio State: The Scholar Adventurers (1950), a title he coined to describe the literary detectives whose work was resulting in new discoveries about James Boswell, Christopher Marlowe, and other major figures in English literature. When Altick began writing about Victorian Britain in the 1950s, the subject had received scant scholarly attention. But the postwar period saw a revival of interest in the Victorians, as signaled by the founding of the journal Victorian Studies at Indiana University at Bloomington in 1957, a journal to which Altick was an adviser and contributor from that first issue. Published that same year, his study, The English Common Reader (1957), showcased what his research methods could achieve. It brought together information about what sorts of books, magazines, newspapers, and ephemera ordinary Britons were reading during the first age of industrialized publishing, and presented it in a clear and thoughtful way. In his subsequent books, curiosity led him to explore a wide variety of subjects, most but not all Victorian, ranging from literary biography to the literary contexts of paintings to London panoramas to sensational murders. Among these, The Shows of London (1978), a study of public entertainments from 1600 to 1862, stands out as a major feat of research. The slender book, Victorian People and Ideas (1980), remains one of the best introductions to the period for undergraduates and general readers. Writers, Readers, and Occasions (1989) brought together essays he had published in various journals over the years. The concluding essay in that volume, \\"'Tis Forty Years Since,\\" offers a retrospective on the evolution of scholarly interest in the Victorians in the twentieth century, from the perspective of a \\"scholar adventurer\\" who had played a major role in fostering that interest. In retirement, Altick continued to indulge what he called his \\"incurable itch to set pen to paper\\" with personal reminiscences as well as major books on the literary uses of paintings, the journalistic contexts of Victorian novels, the Victorian origins of \\"sensational\\" crime stories, and the first ten years of Punch, the British magazine.

They were established in 1886 and were founder members of the Kent League. They have reached the 2nd round of the FA Cup twice in their history. They are currently playing in the . History Although an earlier Sittingbourne United club had been playing since as early as 1881, Sittingbourne F.C. traces its lineage to 1886 when the club was reorganised under the new name. The club moved to a field behind the Bull pub in 1892, where they were to remain for nearly 100 years. Senior status was acquired in 1893, and the following year the club joined the first incarnation of the Kent League, before withdrawing to enter the South Eastern League in 1905. After World War I the club rejoined the Kent League, where they played until 1927 when they joined the Southern League. In 1930 they left this league and it is unclear where they played next. After World War II the Brickies rejoined the Kent League once again, where they were champions in 1957‚Äì58 and 1958‚Äì59. After the second title win they rejoined the Southern League, but after a promising start their performances declined and in 1966‚Äì67, after finishing bottom, they dropped out to join the Kent Premier League which had changed its name from the Thames & Medway Combination. This lasted for one season and the league folded. In 1968 a new Kent league was formed which the club joined. During season 1961‚Äì62 Accrington Stanley left the football league. This created a vacancy and 25 clubs applied to join, of which Sittingbourne were one. They did not obtain any votes and Oxford United were elected with 39 votes. Sittingbourne were Kent League champions in 1975‚Äì76, 1983‚Äì84 and 1990‚Äì91, the third title win earning them a place back in the Southern League. In 1992‚Äì93, by now playing at the new Central Park ground, they won promotion to the Southern League Premier Division, however a financial crisis led to relegation two years later. Although the team bounced back, winning the Southern Division title at the first attempt, they were relegated again in 1998 as the club hovered on the brink of being wound up completely. A move out of Central Park and a drastic reduction in the playing budget saw the Brickies through their troubles, but they flirted with relegation back to the Kent League for a number of years, only finishing in the top half of the table on one occasion in the next eight seasons. In 2006 a re-organisation of the English football league system saw Sittingbourne moved into the Isthmian League, starting in Division One South. The 2009‚Äì10 season ended with Sittingbourne winning the Kent Senior Cup for the first time in 52 years. Gary Abbott left his position as manager in May 2011 and was replaced by his assistant Richard Brady. He brought in ex-brickie Jamie Coyle as his assistant. In September 2011 after a brief spell in charge they were offered management positions at Leatherhead and indicated that the positions were too good to turn down. Long serving player, Joe Dowley took over the caretaker position of manager with the assistance of players Bradley Spice (assistant manager) and Bryan Glover (coach). In November 2011 the committee were impressed with what had been achieved that they made their positions permanent. Joe Dowley resigned as manager after the last game of the 2011‚Äì12 season stating that he wished to return to his playing career. in May 2012 the club employed the Scottish brothers Jim & Danny Ward as joint managers. They were previously with Ramsgate who they left in April 2012. The Ward brothers left their position in September 2013 by mutual consent . In September 2013 after a brief successful spell as caretaker managers, Matt Wyatt and current player and captain Nick Davis were appointed joint managers. In July 2014 Nick Davis resigned as joint manager and Matt Wyatt continued as manager on his own for a short period and then resigned himself in October 2014. His replacement was his previous joint manager Nick Davis. Season 2017-18 started with only two players remaining from the previous season. A new squad was recruited and the season started on a positive note and at one point saw them reach the top of the table. However this did not last and a succession of poor results saw the team drop down the table. In January 2018 Nick Davis resigned and was replaced by one of the coaches, Aslan √ñdev, as an interim manager for the rest of the season. After much success, in April 2018 Aslan √ñdev was awarded the role of manager and will continue for the 2018-19 season. The 2018-19 season started well for the Brickies but then started to go downhill with a string of poor results. In January 2019 Aslan Odev left his position and was replaced by Chris Lynch the Dover Athletic head of youth development. Stadium Central Park Stadium, the former home of Sittingbourne Sittingbourne played at the Bull Ground until 1990 when they sold the site for ¬£4.5 million and built a new state of the art stadium on the outskirts of the town named Central Park Stadium. However, overspending on the new ground caused the club financial difficulties and they were forced to sell the ground to the local council and lease it back. The ground was eventually leased to a company which ran greyhound racing events, who allowed the football club to sign a seven-year lease (a requirement of the Southern League). The club found it hard to guarantee the availability of the stadium due to the racing, however, and agreed to start playing their games on part of the complex where they used to train. This was built in 2002 and named Bourne Park. The ground was shared with Maidstone United between 2002 and 2009, and again for the 2011‚Äì12 season, until Maidstone moved into the Gallagher Stadium in July 2012. In March 2013 it was announced that they would leave Bourne Park at the end of the season for financial reasons and move to the Woodstock Park complex to share with Southern Counties East League side Woodstock Sports who themselves are now defunct. *1881‚Äì1890 Sittingbourne Recreation Ground *1890‚Äì1892 Gore Court *1892‚Äì1990 The Bull Ground *1990‚Äì2002 Central Park *2002‚Äì2013 Bourne Park *2013‚Äìcurrent The Martin & Conley Stadium, Woodstock Park Coaching and medical staff *Manager: Darren Blackburn *Assistant Manager: Darren Pont *Coach: Jay Allen *Head of Medical: Marc Wheeler *Soft Tissue Therapist: Harry Chambers *Team Assistant: Warren Chambers Previous managers *Arthur Banner *John Finch *Walter Rickett *Ray King *Ike Clarke (1957‚Äì61) *Charles Rutter *Tony Oakley *1975 to 1977 Gorden Burden *1977 to 1978 Mike Harrington *1978 to 1985 Peter Laraman *1985 to 1987 Arthur Ervine *1987 to 1988 Ray Parker *1988 to Jan-92 Hugh Stinson *Jan-92 to Mar-92 Andy Woolford (caretaker) *Mar-92 to Feb-95 John Ryan *Feb-95 to Sep-96 Steve Lovell *Sep-96 to Mar-99 Alan Walker *Mar-99 to Jan-01 Hugh Stinson *Jan-01 to Sep-01 John Roles *Oct-01 to Nov-04 Mark Beeney *Nov-04 to Mar-05 Steve Nolan *Mar-05 to Oct-07 Steve Lovell *Nov-07 to Jul-11 Gary Abbott *Jul-11 to Sep-11 Richard Brady *Sep-11 to Apr-12 Joe Dowley *May-12 to Sep-13 Jim & Danny Ward *Sep-13 to Jul-14 Matt Wyatt & Nick Davis *Jul-14 to Oct-14 Matt Wyatt *Oct-14 to Jan-18 Nick Davis *Jan-18 to Jan-19 Aslan √ñdev *Jan-19 to Feb-20 Chris Lynch *Feb-20. to Present.

Its crews and maintainers often called it the \\"Spark-Vark\\", a play on the F-111's \\"Aardvark\\" nickname. The USAF contracted with Grumman in 1974 to convert some existing General Dynamics F-111As into electronic warfare/electronic countermeasures (ECM) aircraft. The USAF had considered the Navy / Marine Corps Grumman EA-6B Prowler, but desired a penetrating aircraft with supersonic speed. The EF-111 entered service in 1983 and served until its retirement in 1998. Design and development In the late 1960s, the U.S. Air Force sought to replace its aging EB-66 and EB-57 electronic warfare aircraft. The Air Force studied the use of Navy EA-6B Prowlers during 1967‚Äì1968.Gunston 1983, p. 55. However, the Air Force desired a penetrating electronic jamming aircraft with supersonic speed, and, in 1972, decided to modify F-111As into electronic warfare aircraft as a cost-effective option.Logan 1998, p. 89. In January 1974, the Air Force awarded electronic warfare study contracts to Grumman and General Dynamics. Grumman was selected as the EF-111 prime contractor in December 1974, then was awarded a contract to modify two F-111As into EF-111 prototypes in January 1975. The first fully equipped model, known then as the \\"Electric Fox\\", flew on 10 March 1977. A total of 42 airframes were converted at a total cost of US$1.5 billion. The first EF-111s were deployed in November 1981 to the 388th Tactical Electronic Squadron, Mountain Home AFB, Idaho. The last was delivered in 1985. An EF-111A Raven in the foreground with a tail-mounted receiving pod and an underside-mounted transmitting pod, accompanied by an F-111F The Raven retained the F-111A's navigation systems, with a revised AN/APQ-160 radar primarily for ground mapping. The primary feature of the Raven, however, was the AN/ALQ-99E jamming system, developed from the Navy's ALQ-99 on the Prowler. The aircraft also utilized the ALR-62 Countermeasures Receiving System (CRS) as a Radar Homing and Warning (RHAW) System, the same system carried by all F-111 fighter/bomber models in the United States and Australia. The ALQ-99E primary electronics were installed in the weapons bay, with transmitters fitted in a long ventral \\"canoe\\" radome; the complete installation weighed some . Receivers were installed in a fin-tip pod, or \\"football\\", similar to that of the EA-6B. The aircraft's electrical and cooling systems had to be extensively upgraded to support this equipment. The cockpit was also rearranged, with all flight and navigation displays relocated to the pilot's side, and flight controls except throttles being removed from the other seat, where the electronic warfare officer's instrumentation and controls were installed. The EF-111 was unarmed. Its speed and acceleration were its main means of self-defense. It was not capable of firing anti-radiation missiles in the Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) role, which was a tactical limitation. The Raven's engines were upgraded to the more powerful TF30-P-9 of the D-model, with dry and afterburning thrustLogan 1998, pp. 17, 92, 303. in 1986.Baugher, Joe. \\"Grumman EF-111A Raven\\". USAAC/USAAF/USAF Fighters, 20 December 1999. From 1987 to 1994 the \\"Spark 'Vark\\" underwent an Avionics Modernization Program (AMP), similar to the Pacer Strike program for the F-model. This added a dual AN/ASN-41 ring laser gyroscope INS, AN/APN-218 Doppler radar, and an updated AN/APQ-146 terrain-following radar. Cockpit displays were upgraded with multi-function displays. Operational history An EF-111 flies over the Alps during Operation Deny Flight The EF-111A achieved initial operational capability in 1983.Gunston 1983, p. 59. The EF-111A received the official popular name Raven, although in service it acquired the nickname \\"Spark 'Vark\\". EF-111s first saw combat use with the 20th Tactical Fighter Wing at RAF Upper Heyford during Operation El Dorado Canyon against Libya in 1986, and Operation Just Cause in Panama during late 1989.\\"366tg Fighter Wing History\\" . US Air Force The Raven served in the Gulf War during Operation Desert Storm in 1991. On 17 January 1991, a USAF EF-111 crew of Captain James Denton and Captain Brent Brandon achieved an unofficial kill against an Iraqi Dassault Mirage F1, which they managed to maneuver into the ground, making it the only member of the F-111/FB-111/EF-111 family to achieve an aerial victory over another aircraft. However, a recent article has cast doubt on this as the only Iraqi Mirage F1 in the air that night returned safely to base and its pilot reported that he shot down the EF-111, the same EF-111 that crashed later on 13 February 1991. No Coalition aircraft were lost to a radar-guided missile during Desert Storm while an EF-111 Raven was on station. On 13 February 1991, EF-111A, AF Ser. No. 66-0023, call sign Ratchet 75, crashed into terrain while maneuvering to evade a perceived threat.https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/153060 killing the pilot, Capt Douglas L.

It was the only EF-111A lost during combat, the only loss killing its crew, and one of just three EF-111s lost during the aircraft's service.YF-111A / F-111A / RF-111A / GF-111A tail no.

However, it is disputed whether there was an enemy present at the time, as two F-15Es watched Ratchet 75 make violent evasive maneuvers and crash into the ground, with no hostile aircraft in the area. =Later action= EF-111s were deployed to Aviano Air Base, Italy in support of Operation Deliberate Force during the mid-1990s. The Raven also flew missions in Operation Provide Comfort, Operation Northern Watch and Operation Southern Watch.Logan 1998, pp. 89‚Äì90. The last deployment of the Raven was a detachment of EF-111s stationed at Al Kharj/Prince Sultan Air Base in Saudi Arabia until April 1998. Shortly afterward, the USAF began withdrawing the final EF-111As from service, and placed them in storage at the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center (AMARC) at Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona. The last EF-111s were retired on 2 May 1998, at Cannon AFB, New Mexico. These were the final USAF F-111s in service.

He was killed in a battle with forces sent by Ahmad Qavam, the prime minister at the time.Stephanie Cronin, \\"PESYƒÄN, MO·∏§AMMAD-TAQI KHAN\\" Encyclop√¶dia Iranica, online edition, 2016, available at http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/pesyan-mohammad-taqi-khan (accessed on 16 May 2016).http://www.iranicaonline.org/pages/chronology-2 Biography Pessian was born into an aristocratic Azerbaijani family in Tabriz originating in the Caucasus. Pessian's family possessed strong military traditions, his uncle General Hamzeh Khan Pessian was a commander in the Persian Cossack Brigade, his cousins Heydar Qoli Khan Pessian ‚Äì father of Iranian author and journalist, Mahtalad Pessian, and grandfather of Anglo- Iranian journalist and author, Cherry Mosteshar ‚Äì Ali Qoli Khan Pessian, Gholam Reza Khan Pessian and he himself served in Gendarmerie. In Tabriz Mohammad Taqi was educated in sciences, Persian, Arabic and foreign languages. In 1907 he left for Tehran to continue his education. After 5 years he took up the rank of Second Lieutenant in the Gendarmerie, within two years he was promoted to Captain. After that he held a variety of posts such as Second Commander in a battalion in Qazvin, served in Hamedan and Yazd and also was an instructor and interpreter at Gendarmerie school in Yusef Abad, Tehran. He was promoted to Major when World War I broke out. In November 1915 as commander of the Gendarmerie in Hamedan he launched an attack on the pro-Russian Persian Cossack Brigade at the Battle of Musalla. His gendarmes managed to disarm the Persian Cossacks and Mohammad Taqi managed to convince some of the cossacks to join his forces in a patriotic speech he made to them after their defeat. Mohammad Taqi and Major Azizollah Khan Zarghami as Gendarmerie commanders could not defend Hamedan against an advancing Russian Caucasus Army which was superior in numbers and weapons. The gendarmes retreated to Kermanshah where they were defeated by the Russians, with many fleeing to the Ottoman Empire. August 1916 saw the return of gendarmes to Kermanshah but again were defeated and this time many went to live in exile in Istanbul while Mohammad Taqi returned to live in exile in Berlin. Colonel Pessian in Germany During his time in Berlin, he was trained as a pilot in the German Airforce and was rewarded with the Eisernes Kreuz Medal for shooting down more than 25 enemy aircraft during World War I. He also translated many works from Persian to/from French, German and English, some of these included Alphonse de Lamartine and Rabindranath Tagore. He also wrote two books in Persian, Sargozasht-e yek javan-e vatandoust and Jang-e Moqaddas az Baghdad ta Iran. In 1920 Mohammad Taqi returned to Iran and joined the Gendarmerie. In June 1920 he was promoted to the rank of Colonel and in September 1920 he became commander of Gendarmerie of Khorasan. On 3 April 1921 in a military coup with his small force of only 200 gendarmes, he had Ahmad Qavam, the Governor- general of Khorasan, arrested and sent him to Tehran where he was imprisoned. He then became head of the provincial Autonomous Government of Khorasan. In June, Ahmad Qavam was released from prison and became Premier of Iran. He was determined to take revenge & suppress Pessian. He did so by gaining the approval of Reza Khan & dispatching the Cossack forces to Khorasan. Having previously been the governor of that province, Qavam had developed a strong relationship with the local chieftains and dispatched them to confront Pessian also. Sardar Mo‚Äôazez Khan Bojnurdi succeeded in gaining the cooperation of the Shirvan chieftains in mobilizing the kurds in Quchan. To combat this, Pessian gathered his scant forces to face the insurgency in Ja‚Äôfarabad (near Quchan). This occurred on 3 October 1921 when Pessian and his small force of 150 gendarmes faced a force of strong 1,000 plus mounted Kurdish tribesmen. In the fight that ensued some of the Gendarmes left the battle field. Many of Pessian's comrades were killed and he was eventually surrounded and beheaded. His head was brought to Tehran to prove that he had been killed. For five continuous years after his death, on 3 October people of Khorasan mourned his death. He is buried in Mashhad, Khorasan in the same garden that contains Nader Shah's tomb.Naderi garden  Iranian.com  Achievements in Germany  Some Persian sources claim that Mohammad Taqi shot down either 25 or 28 aircraft on a purported trip that he made to Germany during the war. In an article in 1985 his Great Niece, Cherry Mosteshar, reported being given Pessian's Iron Cross for safe keeping by her grandmother. Despite this though, he can only be seen in pictures wearing an Eisernes Kreuz or no medals at all. Along with this, he cannot be found on any German World War I lists of aces, where he would have been ranked between 36th and 40th in kills from the entire German air force, during the whole war; or 50th to 52nd if he shot down 25 aircraft. In Germany, he continued his military training, first in the German air force and then in the infantry. He also engaged in a variety of intellectual, cultural and political activities. He wrote an account of his own life, Sarguzasht-i Yak Javan-i Vatandust, and of his experiences in western during the war, Jang-i Muqaddas Az Baghdad Ta Iran. He translated widely between Persian and various European languages, including German, French and English. His love of poetry, especially that which was politically committed, was particularly evident and his choice of works for translation, for example of Alphonse de Lamartine and Rabindranath Tagore, illustrated his own romantic nationalism.

Ethnography  The Pijao or Pijaos formed a loose federation of Amerindians and were living in the present-day department of Tolima, Colombia. In pre-Columbian times, they inhabited the Central Ranges of the Colombian Andes; between the snowy mountains of Huila, Tolima and Quind√≠o, the upper valley of the Magdalena River and the upper Valle del Cauca in Colombia. They did not have a strict hierarchy and did not create an empire. The chiefdom was based on an extended family clan with ancestral lineage. The people did not live in separate households gathered in villages; instead, they lived in carefully built large communal houses made of bahareque, which were placed at distances. They used bonfires to communicate with smoke signs, and these were used to convene different community events. Like many ancient peoples, they relied on waterways for routes of transportation; and due to their navigation skills and knowledge, could get around much of their territory fairly rapidly. They called their best navigators boha (boga). Their boats were called kanoha (canoes), and were carved from a single piece of Saman wood. The Pijao were experts in metallurgy, manufacturing gold articles and clothing. Their work has been seen in gold artifacts from the Tolima, Quimbaya, Calima, and Cauca cultures. They used techniques such as \\"lost wax\\" casting, rolled gold, filigree and other methods to make their balacas (ornaments) and other items for ceremonial use, such as the poporos (bowl with lid). Like some other ancient cultures, the Pijao practiced skull modification and facial alterations, as well as a variety of body modifications, perhaps to identify or distinguish elites. They tied slats on male babies' heads to alter their frontal and occipital regions, perhaps to give them a look of ferocity. They also modified the shape of their upper and lower extremities using adjusted ropes (Interlaced fiber ropes). They changed the appearance of the nose by fracturing the nasal septum. They pierced the nose and the ear lobes to wear gold ornaments and decorations symbolic of their religion. They called these body ornaments Wua-La-ka (Balak). The crowns of the elite were made of several precious materials; in addition, they wore ceremonial masks, feather crowns, bracelets, nose ornaments and other items. They painted their bodies for communal events with a red color powder known as achiote (Bi-Cha or Bija). Their assemblies, also known as Mingas, were held under the broad shade of the Ceiba trees. The Ceiba was considered a symbol of the Great Home of a rich, generous and motherly nature. Here they carried out war ceremonies, crowning of chiefs, wedding rituals and other major events. Most were accompanied by dancing to the beat of maracas, fotuto, yaporojas and drums. Young single women (virgins) were decorated with flowers. Agriculturalists, the Pijao lived close to the earth in homes made of wood and rammed earth. Due to the tropical climate and excellent soil in the highlands, they were able to grow, harvest and cultivate many crops including potatoes, yucca, maize, mangoes, papayas, guavas and many other fruits and vegetables. They also fished and hunted for meats. They wore, as a custom dress, beautifully decorated golden clothes which did not cover their genitals. They painted their bodies with dyed tops of bija. The Spanish conquerors initially called them Bipxaus (Bija), the same name as one of the Paez chiefdoms. Later they referred to the people as the Pijao, which came to be considered a pejorative. The Pijao practiced ritual cannibalism of their enemies. The Spanish captain Diego de Bocanegra (one of many military leaders who battled against the Pijao) accused them of having cannibalized up to 100,000 Spaniards in approximately 50 years. Despite regularly driving back the invading Spaniards, the Pijao population kept decreasing and they were pushed further south in the highlands. They began to clash with neighboring tribes such as the Coconuco, P√°ez, Puruh√°, and Cana. By the mid-18th century, the Pijao people had suffered drastic losses, mostly due to new infectious diseases, to which they had no immunity. Missionary Christians had also taken a toll through conversion and re-education of many natives. The Spanish followed their invasions with colonization of most of the central highlands and the Andes mountain ranges. Through these measures they established the New Kingdom of Granada.  Language  The Pijao language is extinct since the 1950s and has not been classified. It is not listed in Kaufman (1994).  References  = Further reading = * (1997).

Philip Pullman called it \\"one of the clearest and most elegant accounts\\" he had seen of the topic.\\"Sea, sand and the rustle of a turning page...\\", The Observer, 7 July 2002. __TOC__ Synopsis Part 1 reviews the strengths and weaknesses of all currently dominant theories of consciousness, in a form suitable for undergraduates, postgraduates and researchers, focusing mainly on dualism, physicalism, functionalism and consciousness in machines. Part 2 gives a new analysis of consciousness, grounded in its everyday phenomenology, which challenges presuppositions that form the basis of the dualism versus reductionist debate. It also examines the consequences for realism versus idealism, subjectivity, intersubjectivity and objectivity, and the relation of consciousness to brain processing. Part 3 gives a new synthesis, with a novel approach to understanding what consciousness is, and a novel approach to what consciousness does that pays particular attention to the paradoxes surrounding the causal interactions of consciousness with the brain. It also introduces reflexive monism, an alternative to dualism and reductionism that aims to be consistent with the findings of science and with common sense. Both reductionism and dualism are guilty, Velmans asserts, of not paying enough attention to the phenomenology of consciousness, the condition of being aware of something. Reductionism, for example, attempts to reduce consciousness to being a state of the brain; thus consciousness is nothing more than its neural causes and correlates. This, Velmans says, is guilty of breaking Leibniz's assertion that, in order for A to be identical to B (that is, for consciousness to be a state of the brain), the properties of A must also be the properties of B. Velmans here argues that the subjective, phenomenal experience of consciousness is entirely unlike the neural states of the brain, and thus may not be reduced to them; that is, the phenomenal properties of consciousness are not identifiable with the physical brain states that arguably cause them.

The film was an Italian-French-Turkish co- production based on the Argentinian comic Yor the Hunter. Though the film was one of Margheriti's most financially successful films, it received poor reviews from Variety and The New York Times and drew three nominations at the 1983 Golden Raspberry Awards. Plot Yor, a roving hunter and barbarian, jogs through a seemingly prehistoric desert landscape, past the stone towers of Cappadocia, Turkey. In a nearby village, Kala, a seemingly primitive cavewoman, and her mentor and protector Pag are hunting. They were hunting a small pig-like Polacanthus. Suddenly, they are attacked by a \\"stegoceratops,\\" (a cross-breed of a Stegosaurus and a Triceratops). Yor appears and kills the dinosaur with his axe, drinking some of its blood immediately afterwards. Yor is befriended by the village, and together, the villagers cut the choice meats to be feasted upon in celebration. While Yor rests, a band of cavemen with bluish skin attack the village. Only Yor and Pag escape. Yor immediately swears to get Kala back. Yor and Pag track the blue cavemen to their lair, where Yor shoots a giant bat with his bow and arrow. He uses the dead bat like a hang glider to storm the lair and starts flooding sections of the cave, the diversion helping his escape out the back with Kala. The flood kills everyone inside the cave, including the other kidnapped villagers (who had been locked in cages) as well as the blue cavemen. Kala and Pag decide to follow Yor in his adventure to find his origins. Along the way, they find a mysterious society of sand mummies led by a blonde woman named Roah with an amulet similar to Yor's own. Yor proceeds to kill everyone except Roah, deciding that she will be important for their journey. Kala tries to kill Roah at one point, but they are both suddenly attacked by more blue cavemen. Yor and Pag come to the rescue, but a caveman strikes Roah down from behind and she dies in Yor's arms. Yor, Pag, and Kala make friends with another tribe after saving some children from a dimetrodon, but this tribe is killed by (unseen) flying saucers shooting lasers. Yor and company use a boat to make their way to an island surrounded by storms. There Yor discovers, to his initial disbelief, that his parents were from a small band of nuclear holocaust survivors, thereby revealing the \\"twist\\" that Yor's world is actually post-apocalyptic Earth after a nuclear holocaust. A ruthless tyrant called the Overlord has taken control of the remaining nuclear technology with his android army. Yor finds allies in a group of rebels led by the scientist, Ena and the mysterious blind Elder, who have been plotting to overthrow the Overlord for years. Yor and the rebels join forces and attack the Overlord and his androids. Ena leads them to the fortress's atomic stockpile, where they plant explosives powerful enough to destroy it and the fortress. The Elder remains behind and slowly deactivates the android army, buying time for the others to escape. The Overlord pursues them in an attempt to stop the stockpile's destruction and briefly engages Yor in combat, overwhelming him temporarily. As the Overlord enters a nearby elevator, Yor grabs a nearby pole and hurls it through the window, impaling the villain. Mortally wounded, the Overlord struggles onward toward the stockpile as Yor and Ena continue to lead the others to safety. Pag orders them to keep going while he fends off the androids, but he loses his weapon and ends up getting cornered by them. Ena and the rebels quickly rush to his aid, but just as the androids are about to kill Pag, the Elder deactivates them as well. The group quickly boards one of the Overlord's ships just as the Overlord himself reaches the stockpile control room. But before he can stop the bomb, it explodes and he succumbs to his injuries and slowly dies. At the same moment, the Overlord's spacecraft, carrying Yor, Kala, Pag and the rebels flies out of the hangar to safety, while the Overlord's facility explodes behind them. As the movie ends and the ship flies off into the distance, the narrator intones: \\"...Yor returns to the primitive tribes on the mainland. He is determined to use his superior knowledge to prevent them making the same mistakes as their forefathers. Will he succeed?\\" Cast *Reb Brown as Yor *Corinne Cl√©ry as Kala *Luciano Pigozzi as Pag (as Alan Collins) *Carole Andr√© as Ena *John Steiner as Overlord *Ayshe Gul as Rea of the Sand- People *Aytekin Akkaya as Leader of the Sand-People *Ayshe Gul as Roah *Sergio Nicolai as Kay Production Yor, the Hunter from the Future is an adaptation of the Argentinian comic book Yor, created in 1974 by writer Eugenio Juan Zappietro and artist Juan Zanotto. The comic appeared in the Italian magazine Lanciostory in 1975. Director Antonio Margheriti later told an interviewer that the comic was fascinating to him. The film was part of a wave of sword- and-sorcery themed films that appeared after the success of John Milius's 1982 film version of Conan the Barbarian. Other Italian productions that appeared in 1983 in its wake along with Yor, including Lucio Fulci's Conquest and Franco Prosperi's The Throne of Fire (both 1983). The film differs from the comics where the second part of the film begins to resemble Star Wars. Yor, the Hunter from the Future was shot in Turkey, including scenes shot in Cappadocia. Along with co-writing and directing the film, Margheriti supervised the films special effects with his son Edoardo. The film was originally planned as a four part miniseries, with four 50-minute segments to be broadcast on Italy's RAI television. Release Yor, the Hunter from the Future was released in Italy on February 10, 1983. Running time of the Italian feature version of the film was 98 minutes, while the version released August 19, 1983 in United States theaters ran 89 minutes. The film was distributed in the States by Columbia Pictures. Margheriti stated that Columbia distributed 1400 prints of the film in the United States and that it was \\"one of the most successful pictures of my life.\\" Yor, the Hunter from the Future grossed a total of $2,810,199 in the United States. The film was released on DVD as part of Sony's on-demand manufacturing service on September 6, 2011. A blu-ray of the film was released by Mill Creek Entertainment in January 2018 with an audio commentary with actor Reb Brown. The Blu-ray features the American theatrical cut, not the longer Italian version. Reception In a contemporary reviews, Variety referred to the film as \\"one of the cheesiest pics to bear a major studio imprimatur recently, and will have to grab the under-12 crowd on opening weekend or two to pay off. Nobody older than that will buy it.\\" Janet Maslin of the New York Times admitted to not having finished watching the film for her review, noting that she could not imagine who would want to finish the film. The film was nominated for three Golden Raspberry Awards in 1983, for Worst New Star (Reb Brown), Worst Musical Score, and Worst Original Song (\\"Yor's World\\"). The Washington Post opined, \\"Even gluttons for dumbness may find it easy to refrain from second helpings.\\" The Globe and Mail described it as \\"even worse than you think\\" and suggested that it was a rip-off of Star Wars and Quest for Fire. In Leonard Maltin's Movie and Video Guide a review commented that the film was \\"Humorously tacky at first, then just plain boring.\\" The film's director Margheriti commented on the film years after its release that the extended television version of the film was \\"even more hilarious\\" and that the film was \\"a fun project made with almost zero budget. It was a party film and I sometimes enjoy looking at it again.\\" See also * List of Italian films of 1983 * List of films based on comics References =Footnotes= =Sources=  External links  *Yor website Category:1983 films Category:1980s science fiction films Category:Films about cloning Category:Columbia Pictures films Category:Dinosaur films Category:Films scored by Guido & Maurizio De Angelis Category:Films scored by John Scott (composer) Category:Films based on Argentine comics Category:Films directed by Antonio Margheriti Category:Films shot in Turkey Category:French fantasy adventure films Category:French science fiction films Category:Italian films Category:Italian science fiction films Category:Italian fantasy adventure films Category:Live-action films based on comics Category:Post-apocalyptic films Category:Turkish films Category:French films Category:Sword and sandal films ","title":"Yor, the Hunter from the Future"},{"id":"3685715","text":"Mame Younousse Dieng (1939 ‚Äì 1 April 2016) was a Senegalese writer born in Tivaouane who lived in Dakar.

They were established in 1871 and are one of the oldest clubs in the South of England. They were founding members of the Southern League Division Two in 1894 and have reached the 2nd round of the FA Cup once; in the 1873‚Äì74 season. The club is affiliated to the Middlesex County Football Association and is a FA chartered standard club. They are currently members of the . History Uxbridge Football Club was founded in 1871 and the team started playing friendly games, until they made their debut in the FA Cup in 1873. The club folded in 1874, due to financial difficulty and was reformed five years later in 1879. The next 10 years of the club were successful, with the Heron brothers gaining full international caps for England, while playing for the club. In 1886 Uxbridge FC amalgamated with Uxbridge Crescents, and played under this name in the 1886-87 season, but changing back to Uxbridge the following season. The amalgamation also saw the club wear red shirts for the first time, which are still the colours worn today, and the nickname \\"The Reds\\" first used. The club became founder members of the Southern League in 1894, finishing in mid-table in Division Two and reached the final of the FA Amateur Cup in the 1897‚Äì98 season, losing to Middlesbrough at Crystal Palace. The club stayed in the Southern league for five seasons, before dropping out for financial reasons to join the Middlesex league. However, they only survived a single season in the Middlesex league before folding again with a debt of ¬£130. After two seasons the club was reformed and they joined the West Middlesex league, two seasons later they joined the Great Western Combination League and remained there until The Great War. After the First world War they joined the Athenian League. At the end of the 1919‚Äì20 season Uxbridge finished second from bottom and were relegated to the Great Western Combination League. The club returned to the Athenian league 4 seasons later and stayed in the Athenian league until the 1936‚Äì37 season when they failed to be re-elected after finishing bottom of the league twice. The club then moved to the Spartan League, and finished top of the league. However, they were denied the championship, as it was discovered the club had played an ineligible player, so they finished third when six points were deducted. The club then joined the London League the season afterwards and then rejoined the Great Western Combination League during World War II. After the war the club rejoined the London League in the 1945‚Äì46 season. The following season the club joined the Corinthian League. In 1948 land for a ground was bought in Cleveland Road, Cowley for ¬£5,800, which is now part of Brunel University. The ground was named \\"Honeycroft\\" after the large house that had stood there. The 1959‚Äì60 season was a particularly successful season with the club being Champions of the Corinthian League. The club remained in the Corinthian league, until the end of the 1962‚Äì63 season, when as a result of a restructuring of Non-league football the league was disbanded, and were placed in Division one of the Athenian League. At the end of the 1966‚Äì67 season the club was relegated to Division two, which led to the club facing financial difficulties again and the ground was mortgaged, but they still continued and gained national prominence in 1976 when they met a full strength England side at Wembley Stadium as part of World Cup preparations. The score: England 8 Uxbridge 0. In 1978 the club bought its current ground in Yiewsley and also called the ground \\"Honeycroft\\". The club spent over ¬£170,000 on ground improvements and a 1‚Äì1 draw with Arsenal in 1981 saw the official opening of the new floodlights. The 1981‚Äì82 season saw the club finish third in the Athenian League and achieve election into the Isthmian League. The club finished second in Division Two South in 1984‚Äì85 and gained promotion to Division One, where they remained for twenty years. The first season in Division One was good with the team finishing in 7th place and also reaching the 1st Round proper of the FA Trophy and the Final of the AC Delco Cup in its inaugural year, losing 1‚Äì3 to Sutton United. Throughout this period of the late 1960s to late 1980s the club was managed by Ron Clack. The early 1990s saw George Talbot take to the helm as manager, and over the 15 years under his control the club had varying degrees of success, especially in cup competitions. The first major success during this period was winning the London Challenge Cup in 1994, when, after despatching Southall, Leyton Orient (at Brisbane Road) and Football Conference sides Dagenham & Redbridge and Welling United, the club collected their first major trophy for 12 years. Three years later the London Challenge Cup was lifted again following victories over Collier Row & Romford, St. Albans City, Barking and Leyton Pennant by 1‚Äì0 in a final replay after a 3‚Äì3 draw at Fulham's Craven Cottage ground. A year later in 1998 the club reached the London Challenge Cup Final again and also the final of the Middlesex Senior Cup, losing to Boreham Wood and Enfield respectively. 1999 saw another appearance in the final of the London Challenge Cup, this time the club losing to Dulwich Hamlet after extra time at Charlton Athletic's ground, and a year later the club made their fourth consecutive appearance in the London Challenge Cup Final, and this time the \\"Reds\\" gained their revenge over Dulwich Hamlet, with a 5‚Äì4 win on penalties following a 2‚Äì2 draw at Dagenham & Redbridge. 2001 saw the club lose their stranglehold on the London Challenge Cup but they were victorious in the Middlesex Senior Cup for the first time in 50 years as they defeated Isthmian Premier neighbours Harrow Borough. The 2003‚Äì04 season saw another cup final reached, resulting in a defeat to holders Hendon in the Middlesex Senior Cup. The 2004‚Äì05 season, saw the club moved from the Isthmian league to the Southern league, in the Eastern Division. Their debut in the new league saw them finish in fourth place and a play-off competition for the final promotion place, which Uxbridge lost in the final on penalties at Maldon Town. Before the 2005‚Äì06 season the club installed a brand new floodlighting system (up to Football Conference standard). However, poor performances on the pitch saw the departure of George Talbot. Former Uxbridge player and Northwood manager Tony Choules was appointed as George Talbot's successor. Under his stewardship the club reached the Play-off final in the 2007‚Äì08 season where they lost to Oxford City 1‚Äì0 in the Play-off Final. The club then switched to Division One Central in the Southern League at the start of the 2010‚Äì11 season and in the 2011‚Äì12 season they finished Fourth qualifying for the Play-offs, but lost 2‚Äì1 to Bedworth United in the semi-final.The club did, however, win back to back Middlesex Charity Cup's in 2013 and 2014. After thirteen years in charge of the club, Choules stepped aside in May 2019. His replacement was former Chalfont St Peter boss Danny Edwards.http://www.uxbridgefc.com/news/uxbridge- appoint-new-manager-2428792.html Ground Uxbridge play their games at Honeycroft, Horton Road, Yiewsley, West Drayton UB7 8HX.

It was the first of the few Commonwealth Statutes enacted by the reigning Monarch.  Flags Act 1953  Flag of Australia The legislation specifies the colours and construction details for the Australian National Flag and the Australian Red Ensign (also known as the Australian Merchant Flag). Sections 5 & 6 confer statutory powers on the Governor-General to appoint 'flags and ensigns of Australia', and authorise warrants and make rules as to use of flags. Section 8 ensures that the 'right or privilege' of a person to fly the Union Jack is not affected by the Act. The Act originally contained a serious drafting error in Table A of the Act. The outer diameter of the Commonwealth Star was recorded as being three-eighths of the width of the flag, instead of the true value of three-tenths of the width of the flag. The Act was amended to correct the error in 1954. Upon introducing the legislation in the House of Representatives on 20 November 1953, Prime Minister Robert Menzies stated: \\"The bill is very largely a formal measure which puts into legislative form what has become almost the established practice in Australia.\\"https://www.anfa-national.org.au/history-of-our- flag/flag-acts-1953-statute/robert-menzies-speech/  Flags Amendment Act 1998  The Flags Amendment Act was passed after the 1996 Australian federal election, during a period where the republican movement was influential, and both the government and opposition parties were committed to bringing the issue to a head as a matter of policy. The Flags Amendment Act 1998 added to section 3 of the Flags Act and provided that the present Australian National Flag could only be replaced if a majority of State and Territory electors qualified to vote for the House of Representatives agree.

It was authorized by the U.S. Congress and signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on 30July 1942. Its purpose was to release officers and men for combat, and to replace them with women in U.S. shore stations for the duration of the war, plus six months. Ruth Cheney Streeter was appointed the first director. The Reserve did not have an official nickname, as did the other World WarII women's military services. Young women were keen on serving in the military during WWII, and the Marine Corps desired only the best. The standards set for women who wished to volunteer for the Reserve were demanding. The Reserve did not accept African American or Japanese American women during World WarII, but did accept Native American women. The officer candidates first trained at the Navy's Midshipmen School for women officers at Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Massachusetts. The initial training site for the enlisted women was at the Naval Training School at Hunter College in the Bronx, New York City. In due course, the Marine Corps discovered the advantages of having its own training centers. So on 1July 1943, all Reserve training was shifted to Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. The members served at shore and air stations across the continental United States. The incorporated territory of Hawaii was the only overseas duty station where members were assigned. They served in occupations classified as professional, semi-professional, clerical, skilled trades, services, and sales. The peak strength of the Reserve was about 19,000. With the end of World War II in sight, the corps began to demobilize the members. By December 1945, the Reserve was down to 12,300, and by August 1946 it had about 300 members. Early on, the male members of the Marine Corps subjected the women to a degree of resentment and crude language. The women overcame these indignities with their accomplishments in the workplace and the poise with which they performed. In time, most of their detractors became their supporters. For her stewardship of the Reserve, the Marine Corps presented Ruth Cheney Streeter with the Legion of Merit. On the occasion of the first anniversary of its establishment, the Reserve received a message from President Franklin D. Roosevelt, in which he observed, \\"You have quickly and efficiently taken over scores of different kinds of duties that not long ago were considered strictly masculine assignments, and in doing so, you have freed a large number of well trained, battle ready men of the corps for action.\\" Initially, General Thomas Holcomb, Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps, had been opposed to having women serve in the Marine Corps. Before the end of 1943, however, he reversed himself, saying, \\"Like most Marines, when the matter first came up I didn't believe women could serve any useful purpose in the Marine Corps ... Since then I've changed my mind.\\"Stremlow, p. 40 Background thumbalt=Six members of the United States Congress speaking among themselves ‚Äì one woman and five men ‚Äì in 1939 Representative Edith Nourse Rogers of Massachusetts pictured with other representatives in 1939 At the outbreak of World War II, the notion of women serving in the Navy or Marine Corps (both under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Navy) was not widely supported by the Congress or by the branches of the military services. Nevertheless, some believed that women would eventually be needed in the military. The most notable was Edith Nourse Rogers, Representative of Massachusetts, and Eleanor Roosevelt, wife of the president, who helped pave the way for its reality. When President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed what would become Public Law689 on 30July 1942, it established a Women's Reserve as a branch of the Naval Reserve for the Navy and Marine Corps.Stremlow, pp. 1‚Äì2 The idea behind the law was to free up officers and men for combat, with women standing in for them at shore stations on the home front. Women could now serve in the Reserve as an officer or at an enlisted level, with ranks or ratings consistent with those of men. Reserve volunteers could only serve for the duration of the war, plus six months.Ebert and Hall, pp. 36‚Äì37 The Marine Corps delayed formation of the Reserve until 13February 1943.Stremlow, pp. 1‚Äì2 It was the last service branch to accept women into its ranks, and there was considerable unhappiness about making the Marine Corps anything but a club for white men.National Archives, p. 51 In fact, General Thomas Holcomb, Commandant of the Marine Corps, was a well-known opponent of women serving in the corps.Stremlow, p. 1 By the end of 1943, however, he had reversed himself, saying, \\"there's hardly any work at our Marine stations that women can't do as well as men. They do some work far better than men. ... What is more, they're real Marines. They don't have a nickname, and they don't need one.\\"National Archives, p. 51 Holcomb rejected all acronyms or monikers for the Reserve; he did not believe they were compulsory. Despite Holcomb‚Äôs dislike for nicknames, several of them surfaced for the Reserve, including: Femarines, WAMS, BAMS, Dainty Devil-Dogs, Glamarines, Women's Leatherneck-Aides, MARS, and Sub- Marines. By the summer of 1943, attempts to pressure the Reserve into a nickname had diminished. \\"WR\\" was as far as Holcomb would move in that direction.Soderbergh, p. 21 Leadership Ruth Cheney Streeter, the first director of the Marine Corps Women's Reserve during World WarII Ruth Cheney Streeter was named the first director of the Reserve; commissioned a major and sworn in by the Secretary of the Navy on 29January 1943.Stremlow, pp. 2‚Äì3 A year later, Streeter was promoted to colonel.Soderbergh, p. 23 She was not the first woman to see active duty in the Marine Corps during World WarII. Weeks earlier, Mrs. Anne A. Lentz, a civilian clothing expert who had helped design the Reserve uniforms, was commissioned a captain. Lentz came to the corps on a 30-day assignment from the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC) and stayed on.Stremlow, pp. 2‚Äì3 Streeter was born in Brookline, Massachusetts, in 1895Soderbergh, p. 20 and attended Bryn Mawr College for two years. She was the wife of a prominent (Morristown, NJ) lawyer and businessman, and the mother of four children, three sons in the military during World WarII, and one younger daughter. Although Streeter had 20 years' of active civic work, she had never held a paying job. She was selected from a field of twelve outstanding women, all recommended to the corps by Dean Virginia C. Gildersleeve of Barnard College, who had earlier recommended Mildred McAfee for the director of the Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service (WAVES). Streeter was 47 years of age when selected to head the Reserve. In the Free a Marine to Fight publication, Colonel Mary V. Stremlow (Ret. MCWR) described her as confident, spirited, patriotic, and a principled person. In 1940, Streeter believed the United States would be drawn into World WarII. Intending to be part of the war effort, she learned to fly and earned a commercial pilot's license. She then purchased a small airplane, and in the summer of 1941 joined the Civil Air Patrol. Her plane was used to fly missions, Streeter recalled, but she was unhappy, relegated to doing \\"all the dirty work\\". Then, when the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP) was formed, though Streeter was twelve years over the age limit, she applied five times and was rejected five times. In January 1943, when she inquired about service with the WAVES, she was told that flying was out of the question, but that she could be a ground instructor. Streeter turned it down, and a month later became the director of the Reserve.Stremlow, pp. 3‚Äì4 During her tenure as the director, she sent an open letter to all women recruits, saying, \\"It is not easy to Free a Marine to Fight (a recruiting slogan of the Reserve). It takes couragethe courage to embark on a new and an alien way of life... Your spirit is a source of constant inspiration to all who work with you.\\"National Archives, pp. 51‚Äì52 Colonel Streeter resigned her commission from the Reserve on 7December 1945. (She was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Katherine A. Towle.) A few months later, the Marine Corps presented Streeter with the Legion of Merit. It was the highest award ever made to a woman marine as a result of World WarII service. The Marine Corps also dedicated the headquarters building of the Fourth Recruit Training Battalion at Parris Island, South Carolina, to her. Streeter died on 9September 1990, two days before her 95th birthday.Soderbergh, pp. 141‚Äì142 Recruiting A Marine Corps Women's Reserve recruiting poster during World WarII The qualifications for women who wished to become members of the Reserve were stringent. The eligibility requirements for officer candidates and enlisted women were similar: United States citizenship; not married to a marine; either single or married but with no children under 18; height not less than ; weight not less than ; good vision and good teeth. For enlisted members, the age limits were from 20 to 35, and an applicant was required to have at least two years' of high school. For officer candidates, the age limits were from 20 to 49, and they had to either be a college graduate, or have a combination of two years' of college and two years' of work experience. Later, the wives of enlisted Marines were allowed to join, and enlisted women could marry after boot camp.Stremlow, p. 5 Women enlistees being sworn into the Marine Corps Women's Reserve in the New York area, 1943. Official USMC photograph By way of agreement, the Navy and the Marine Corps designated the Navy's procurement offices as recruiting centers for both the WAVES and the Reserve. This helped to avoid competition in the recruiting of women for either naval service. Women applicants for either service would go to one office to enlist and to receive physical examinations. (Later on, the Reserve established its own recruiting capability.) When reservations surfaced about whether male Marine recruiters could properly select female applicants for the Reserve, the call went out for women recruiters. Nineteen WAVE officer candidates volunteered; they were transferred and assigned to procurement offices. Still in WAVE uniforms, they began recruiting the first members of the Reserve. Lucile E. McClarren of Nemacolin, Pennsylvania, appears to have been the first enlisted woman recruited on 13 February 1943.Stremlow, p. 5 The Reserve did not accept African American women or Japanese American women during the war years.National Archives, p. 346 The first Native American woman to enlist in the Reserve was Minnie Spotted-Wolf of Heart Butte, Montana; she did so in July 1943.Parkinson, pp. 1‚Äì2 Early recruiting was brisk, so much so that in some cases women were sworn in and put to work in procurement offices, delaying their training until later.Stremlow, p. 5 The slogan \\"Free a Marine to Fight\\" proved to be a strong drawing card for the Reserve, stronger than any fashioned by the WAC, WAVES, or SPARS.Soderbergh, p. 21 Young women were eager to serve in the military during World WarII, often in defiance of their family's wishes. Marian Bauer's parents were so upset when she joined the corps that they did not see her off. Jane Taylor's father, a World War I veteran, gave her this advice: \\"Don't ever complain to me. You're doing this of your own free will. You weren't drafted or forced. Now, golearn, travel, and do your job to the best of your ability.\\" There were those parents who asked for special consideration for daughters who were too young to enlist. The minimum age of 20 years, set by law, remained the same throughout the war for the Reserve. Some parents wondered why 18-year-boys were sent into combat, and 18-year-old girls could not serve.Stremlow, pp. 5‚Äì6 The Corps' recruiting scheme of forming platoons of about 40women each to be recruited from the same area and sending them as a unit to Reserve training together caught on quickly. The first platoon was from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, then Washington, D.C., and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, followed by Albany, Buffalo, and Central New York; Johnstown and Fayette County, Pennsylvania; Dallas and Houston, Texas; Miami, Florida; Saint Paul, Minnesota; Green Bay, Wisconsin; the state of Alabama; and northern and southern New England.Stremlow, p. 12 Aside from patriotism, Colonel Streeter was interested to learn the reasons why young women joined the Reserve. A survey of 1,000 new enlistees was conducted at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, which asked this question. The results of this survey showed that 750 enlistees had had positive reasons for enlisting. Some had male relatives or friends in the armed forces, and some wanted revenge against the enemy, while others wanted the experience it would bring to their lives. The remaining 250 acknowledged they were trying to escape from something: a bad home life, a broken marriage, boredom, or some personal disappointment. Indications were that Streeter was not displeased with the findings.Soderbergh, p. 23 The Reserve met its recruitment goal by 1June 1944 and then stopped all recruiting. It began again on 20September 1944 but on a limited basis.Stremlow, p. 7 Its peak strength was about 19,000 officers and enlisted women.Soderbergh, p. 147 The first group of six officers recruited was given direct commissions in the Reserve. They were recruited for their abilities and civilian experiences, considered key to the success of the fledgling program. Assignments were: public relations, First Lieutenant E. Louise Stewart; training, Captain Charlotte D. Gower; classification and detail, Captain Cornelia D.T. Williams; West Coast activities, Captain Lillian O'Malley Daly (who had been a marine in WWl); Recruit Depot, Captain Katherine Towle; and Assistant to the Director, Captain Helen C. O'Neill. These women were assigned to active duty immediately, without any military training or formal indoctrination in the corps.Stremlow, pp. 4‚Äì5 To capitalize on the enlisted women's experience, commission status was open to them beginning in July 1943. To be eligible, the applicant had to have completed six months' of service, be recommended by her commanding officer, and be selected by a board of male and female officers. After October 1943, the majority of women officers came from the ranks; only civilian women with specialized skills or exceptional leadership qualities were accepted for officer training.Stremlow, p. 13 Uniforms In her winter uniform, Private Eleanora Julia Csanady stands sentry duty at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, in 1943. Official USMC photograph The uniforms of the Reserve were a matter of importance to the Marine Corps, so much so that a circular released in late 1943 stated the following: > The Marine Corps wants you to look your best at all times. The uniforms you > will wear have been designed to be comfortable, practical and extremely > attractive. When you don them you will know the pride of wearing a uniform > that is a symbol of valor and bravery everywhere.Soderbergh p. 104 Reserve recruits were promised uniforms upon reaching boot camp, but that was not always the case. In fact, during the summer of 1943, some recruits had to train in civilian clothing until summer uniforms were available. When the new uniforms arrived, they turned out to be winter uniforms instead of the summer uniforms expected. The seersucker summer uniforms had yet to be designed. Disputes about fabric, cut, and production had a delaying effect upon delivery. In time, these issues were resolved, and most Reserve members felt their uniforms were much better looking than those of the other women's military organizations.Soderbergh, pp. 104‚Äì105 The winter uniform for both Reserve officers and enlisted members resembled the men's uniform in some respects. It was a forest green and consisted of a skirt, no higher than the bottom of the kneecap, an unbelted jacket with three bronze buttons, and a green cap trimmed with a scarlet cord. Marine Corps emblems were placed on the cap and the uniform lapels; scarlet chevrons were sewn on the jacket's sleeves. Under the jacket, a khaki shirt and matching field scarf were worn. Added to the ensemble were dark brown gloves, shoulder bag, and shoes.Soderbergh, p. 105 For inclement weather, there was a green overcoat or a khaki trench coat, a red muffler, and black boots, or rubbers. Neither officers nor enlisted members had winter dress uniforms. However, officers were able to modify their winter service uniform into a dress uniform by substituting a white shirt and forest green tie in place of the regular khaki. The enlisted members were without such freedom.Stremlow, p. 18 The summer uniform was a two-piece green and white outfit made of washable seersucker material. It had two pieces, a skirt and a short-sleeve jacket with a V-neck. The cap was green and decorated with a white cord, buttons were white, chevrons green, and emblems bronze. The shoes were brown, the gloves white, and the handbags light green.Soderbergh, p. 105 The summer dress uniform was made of white twill. It had short sleeves and a V-neck, worn with gilt buttons on the jacket and cap, with dress emblems and white pumps. The officers could choose between three summer dress uniforms. The first was the white one worn by enlisted women, but with added green shoulder straps. The other two were made of white twill or a similar material. One was a short-sleeve blouse, and the other was long sleeved and collarless.Stremlow, pp. 18‚Äì19 Slacks of covert material were worn for certain duties, although the most common work uniform was the olive-drab, cotton utility outfit, worn with high topped shoes. The trousers had a bib-front and crossed straps, and were worn over a short sleeve, matching shirt, and topped by a long-sleeve jacket. For recreation, field nights, and physical conditioning, women Marines wore the peanut suit, so named because of its colored appearance. It was a tan, seersucker, one- piece bloomer outfit, with ties at the bottom of the shorts. In keeping with the propriety of the times, the women covered their legs with a front-buttoned A-line skirt when not actively engaged in sports, exercises, or work details.Stremlow, p. 19 Training =Mount Holyoke College= First group of Marine Corps Women's Reserve officer candidates arrive at Mount Holyoke College in 1943. Official USMC photograph The Reserve officer candidates trained at Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Massachusetts, a branch of the Navy‚Äôs Midshipmen‚Äôs School for women officers at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts. On 13March 1943, the first group of 71 officer candidates arrived at the Midshipmen's School, Mount Holyoke College. Officer candidates joined as privates and after four weeks, if successful, became officer cadets. Those who did not meet the requirements had two choices: transfer to enlisted basic training or await discharge. Cadets who completed the eight-week course but were not recommended for a commission were asked to resign. They were eventually discharged and allowed to join the enlisted ranks. The curriculum for officer candidates was the same as for the WAVES, except for drill. This was taught by male Marine drill instructors (non- commissioned officers who provided instruction and indoctrination for officer candidates and enlisted recruits), who were openly hostile to the women because they had become part of the formerly all-male Marine Corps. Candidates studied the following naval subjects: organization; administration; personnel; history; strategy; law; justice; ships and aircraft. The second part of the training was specifically on Marine Corps subjects taught by male Marines. It included the following: administration; courtesy; map reading; interior guard (to preserve order, protect property, and enforce regulations within the command); safeguarding military information; and physical conditioning. On 4May 1943, members of the first class received their commissions in the Marine Corps. A total of 214women officers completed training at Mount Holyoke College.Stremlow, pp. 7‚Äì9 =Hunter College= Shortly after the first officer class reported to Mount Holyoke College, enlisted women of the Reserve were ordered to the US Naval Training School at Hunter College in the Bronx, New York City. 722recruits arrived for training between 24March and 26March. On 26March, 21platoons of women began training with the WAVES and graduated on 25April 1943. Because the school was designated for WAVE instruction, the curriculum was geared for the Navy. Some subjects were not relevant for Marines, so modifications were made and male Marine drill instructors were added to the staff. The training sessions included: drill; physical training; customs; courtesies; history; organization; administration; naval law; map reading; defense against air attack; identification of aircraft, and safeguarding military information. In the process, the male marines did not hide their resentment toward the women for being a part of the corps. Between March and July, 3,346women trained at Hunter College, 3,280 of whom graduated.Stremlow, p. 9 =Camp Lejeune= Three Native American Marine Corps Women's Reserve members, Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. Left to right: Minnie Spotted-Wolf (Blackfoot), Celia Mix (Potawatomi), and Viola Eastman (Chippewa) on 16 October 1943 Originally, the Marine Corps planned to use existing Navy facilities for all of the Reserve training, but it soon realized the advantage of having its own training schools. Although joint training with the Navy proved satisfactory, it did not engender the Marine esprit decorps that was expected. Consequently, Marine Headquarters decided to consolidate all Reserve training at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. The Marine Corps opened its own schools for officer candidates and recruit training at Camp Lejeune in July 1943, under the command of Colonel John M. Arthur. Officer candidates and recruits in training at Navy facilities were transferred to Camp Lejeune, where over 15,000 women became Marines during the remainder of World WarII.Stremlow, pp. 10‚Äì11 The new camp was named for John A. Lejeune (1867‚Äì1942), a distinguished Marine officer. The area was completed in 1943, with a headquarters building and facilities for transient and permanent Marine Corps personnel.Soderbergh, p. 45 At Lejeune, the curriculum for both officer candidates and enlisted recruits moved beyond classroom lectures on combat weapons to actual weapon demonstrations. Reserve personnel observed demonstrations in hand-to-hand combat, use of mortars, bazookas, flame- throwers, an assortment of guns, and landing craft. However, they were not trained to use these weapons themselves.Stremlow, p. 11 Leaving the college campuses for the Camp Lejeune training center was a change, but it introduced the officer candidates and recruits to the real Marine Corps military environment. What did not change from the time at Mount Holyoke and Hunter was the hostile behavior of the drill instructors towards the women. At Lejeune they did not try to hide their resentment, often referring to the women as BAMS (Broad Assed Marines) and using other crude references.Stremlow, p. 11Soderbergh, p. 47 In the early days of the Reserve, the women were subjected to considerable verbal and psychological abuse.Soderbergh, p. 56 This took a toll on the Reserve and its director, causing General Holcomb (Commandant of the Marine Corps) to take steps to end it. In time, the open hostilities subsided, and before long the women's competence, self-assurance, sharp appearance, and pride won over most of their detractors.Stremlow, p. 12 Assignments Private Marion Pillsbury assembles a .50caliber machine gun at the Marine Corps Base at San Diego, California, during World WarII. Official USMC photograph Assigning jobs in occupations that women had never held before was a daunting task for placement personnel. By social custom, working women did not work in the trades and they rarely supervised men. Women had worked mainly in offices, classrooms, hospitals, retail stores, libraries, and beauty shops.Stremlow, pp. 20‚Äì21 In 1943, Marine Corps manpower was in short supply, but members of the Reserve were available to pick up the slack. However, the corps had to select, train, classify, and assign the women to jobs where they could contribute and do so in the shortest amount of time.Stremlow, pp. 20‚Äì21 After completing their Marine Corps basic training, selected women received advanced schooling in a variety of specialties. By the end of the war, 9,641 members of the Reserve had attended more than 30 specialist schools run by higher educational institutions and departments of the U.S. military.Stremlow, p. 14 Colonel Streeter's philosophy was to let them try anything, except heavy lifting and combat.Stremlow, p. 21 The Reserve strength on 1June 1945 was 17,672, of which 1,342 were engaged in occupations classified as professional or semi-professional; 10,279 in clerical; 741 in sales; 587 in services; 344 in skilled trades; 1,305 as semi-skilled; 14 as unskilled; 35 as students; and six unaccounted for.Stremlow, p. 25 Marine Corps recruiting literature indicated there were over 200 types of jobs available in the Reserve. While this may have been correct, the fact was that well over half the women were assigned to and worked in clerical fields.Soderbergh, p. 55 The first duty posts and stations for the Reserve included places such as Washington, D.C.; New York; Philadelphia; Chicago; San Diego; and Quantico, Virginia.Soderbergh, p. 54 Marine aviation was the fastest-growing unit of the Corps. Both officers and enlisted women served at Marine Corps Air Stations including Cherry Point and Edenton, North Carolina; Parris Island, South Carolina; El Centro, El Toro, Mojave, and Santa Barbara, California.Soderbergh, p. 55 Private First Class Priscilla Goodrich (left) and Private Elaine Munsinger (right) doing engine repair at the Cherry Point, North Carolina, Marine Corps Air Station during World WarII. Official USMC photograph Reserve members were prohibited from serving outside the continental United States, however, this impediment changed on 27September 1944 when Public Law 441 amended 689 to allow Reserve members to serve in the Territory of Hawaii.Stremlow, p. 31 Some thought the enactment of Public Law 441 was anticlimactic. Colonel Streeter believed that sending Reserve members to Hawaii \\"was not worth all the trouble and cost.\\" Nevertheless, the Marine Corps did deploy women to Hawaii.Soderbergh, p. 122 Hawaiian duty was on a volunteer basis. Many members applied, but only the very best of them were accepted. The applicants were subject to the following requirements: had to have been on active duty for at least six months; commit to an 18-month tour; have a clean record; be in excellent mental and physical health; agree not to request leave to visit the mainland, and verify they had no dependents whose care might necessitate a trip back to the mainland.Soderbergh, p. 125 In addition, members were expected to have a stable personality, sufficient skill to fill one of the billets for which women had been requested, and motivation to do a good job. San Diego, California, became the staging area, where a short yet intense physical conditioning course was given.Stremlow, p. 32 The first contingent of women arrived in Hawaii on 28January 1945. At mid-year, there were about 1,000 women serving in Hawaii. By January 1946, they were all back on the mainland.Stremlow, p. 34 Fatal accidents Between February 1943 and September 1946, eighteen women reserve members were killed, the majority of them in off-duty automobile accidents. Only three members were killed while in the performance of their duties.Soderbergh, pp. 88‚Äì89 On 1 October 1945, four members from the ElToro Air Station died when the automobile they were riding in was hit by a train near Irvine, California.Soderbergh, p. 146 Corporal Nancy Engwall and Anna McDougall (rate unknown) were killed instantly, while Corporal Virginia Ruth Spalding and Private Shirley Kilian died later at the Long Beach Naval Hospital.Ferris, p. 290 Second Lieutenant Mary Rita Palowitch and Corporal Germaine C. Laville, Aerial Gunnery Instructors, were teaching at the Cherry Point Air station, when a civilian cleaning crew accidentally started a fire in their building. Initially, Laville escaped, but returned to the blaze after she heard others scream for help. Both Palowitch and Laville perished in the fire. Laville was cited posthumously for her bravery.Lacy, p. 63 Demobilization At the end of the war, the task of demobilization fell to Colonel Katherine A. Towle, the second director of the Reserve.Stremlow, p. 37 In December 1945, the Reserve was down to about 12,300 members, with expectations of reducing this number by 2,000 each month thereafter.Soderbergh, p. 147 The demobilization plan called for mandatory resignation or discharge of all Reserve members by 1September 1946.Stremlow, p. 37 Separation centers were set up at San Diego, San Francisco, ElToro, Parris Island, and Lejeune.Soderbergh, p. 147 In early 1946, there was speculation that legislation to give women permanent status in the military was being considered, which prompted the Marine Corps to relax its demobilization policy. Then on 15June 1946, the wartime office of the Reserve was closed when Colonel Towle returned to work at the University of California. The outgoing director proposed that Julia E. Hamblet replace her.Stremlow, pp. 37‚Äì38 Three months later, Hamblet was appointed as the third and final director of the wartime Reserve.Soderbergh, p. 147 When August 1946 came around, some 300 women had been asked by the Marine Corps to stay on, even as the last of the Reserve's barracks was being closed.Stremlow, p. 39 For the next two years, these women served the Marine Corps in an undetermined status. But on 30July 1948, the Women's Armed Services Act (Public Law 625) was signed into law, which allowed these and other women to serve in the regular Marine Corps.Soderbergh, p. 147 Recognition On its first anniversary, 13 February 1944, the Reserve received a congratulatory message from President Franklin D. Roosevelt:Stremlow, p. 40 General Thomas Holcomb, Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps, had initially been opposed to having women serve in the Marine Corps. However, before the end of 1943, he had reversed himself, saying:Stremlow, p. 40 See also * Women in the Air Force (WAF) * Women in the United States Navy * Women's Army Corps (United States Army) * Women's Auxiliary Air Force (British) * Women's Royal Canadian Naval Service * Women's Royal Naval Service (British) \\"Wrens\\" * Women's Royal Australian Naval Service References =Citations= =Bibliography=    * Further reading * External links * * Women Marines in World War I *USMCWR history and WWII women's uniforms in color ‚Äî World War II US women's service organizations (WAC, WAVES, ANC, NNC, USMCWR, PHS, SPARS, ARC and WASP).

Ofelia Su√°rez grew up in Cuba with three siblings. She published several books of poetry, and at the age of 29, she married businessman Martin Fox. Her husband became owner of the legendary Tropicana Club in Havana. It was there that Ofelia Fox first met many Hollywood stars and celebrities, such as Ava Gardner, Nat King Cole, Ernest Hemingway, Carmen Miranda and Tyrone Power. In Cuba of the 1950s, Ofelia Fox became a well-known nightlife personality, as she was often by her husband's side at the nightclub. Under Martin Fox's ownership, the Tropicana Club flourished and became one of the most well-known entertainment venues in the world. Revolutionary forces, under the command of Fidel Castro, took over the club in 1959, prompting Martin and Ofelia to move to Miami. The couple, who had no children, lived for five years in Miami, where Ofelia became friends with Rosa S√°nchez. When Martin died of a stroke in 1964, Ofelia and Rosa moved to Glendale, California, near Los Angeles. Their house became a meeting place for Cubans living in California, and domino parties were common. In 2003, author Rosa Lowinger approached Ofelia about working together to write a book about the Tropicana Nightclub. Tropicana Nights: The Life and Times of the Legendary Cuban Nightclub (Harcourt, 2005) was written by Lowinger with the assistance of Fox. The book incorporates hours of interviews with Fox and many former Tropicana employees. By the time of publication, Fox was battling both cancer and diabetes. She died at the age of 82 from cancer and complications from diabetes, at the St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, California. In 2007 Rosa S√°nchez published Ofelia Fox's Cuba, Patria en Lagrimas y el Mensaje de Liansu, a collection of her 1961-64 broadcasts on Miami's WMIE. Fox was the first female Cuban radio personality in Miami, and she was a public lecturer as well. The book includes excerpts and notes from her speeches.

It was released in arcades in February 1991, then ported to the Sega Saturn in December 1994 under the name A similar game with a two-seat cabinet was also released in 1991 as . Rad Mobile was Sega's first 32-bit game, using Sega's System 32 arcade system board. It was also the first appearance of Sonic the Hedgehog, who appears as an ornament hanging from the driver's rearview mirror, five months before his debut in Sonic the Hedgehog. Rad Mobile received mixed reviews, praising its 3D visuals but criticizing its gameplay. Gameplay and development Gameplay screenshot showing the 32-bit sprite graphics of the game. Sonic the Hedgehog makes his first appearance, hanging above the rear view mirror. Similar to Out Run, the concept behind Rad Mobile is a race against opponents across the United States. Players must race across the country while also avoiding police cars. At certain points in the race, the road forks, allowing players to skip several stages. The game's weather and time of day changes, sometimes requiring players to turn on windshield wipers or headlights. Rad Mobile was also the first appearance of Sonic the Hedgehog, appearing as a decorative item hanging from the driver's rearview mirror. Sonic's appearance in the game predated his debut in Sonic the Hedgehog for the Sega Genesis by five months. Interested in getting their new character visible to the public, Sonic Team approved of his appearance in the game. Credit is usually given to Yu Suzuki and his Sega AM2 division, the developers of Out Run, which established the formula of Rad Mobile's gameplay. However, Suzuki has not listed it in any of his official lists of works. Zach Whalen, an associate professor with the University of Mary Washington, located a segment of text in the game's source code suggesting that Sega AM3 was the actual developer of the game. In a 1991 interview, AM3 head Hisao Oguchi made mention of AM3's involvement in Rad Mobile's development. Sega's AM4 division, at the time a designer of arcade cabinets, had involvement with constructing the game's deluxe cabinet that would bank and turn, and featured functioning brake lights, while the game was also released in an upright cabinet. Rad Mobile was Sega's debut of its System 32 arcade system board, Sega's last arcade board to utilize sprites in place of 3D polygons. The game premiered at the Amusement Trade Exhibition in the United Kingdom in January 1991. Its release was in February 1991. A version of Rad Mobile was demonstrated at Japanese trade shows operating in Sega's R360 cabinet, but no record of a release has been found. Later the same year, Sega released Rad Rally, based on Rad Mobile but with changes and the addition of two-player multiplayer. Rad Rally was released in a two-seat arcade cabinet. In 1994 a port of Rad Mobile was released only in Japan for the Sega Saturn, as Gale Racer. Its release was much later than the arcade version due to the Genesis' hardware being insufficient to play the game. Gale Racer was directed by Tomohiro Kondo, who had worked on the Panzer Dragoon series, and designed by Takashi Yuda, responsible for the design of The Revenge of Shinobi. As part of the port, designs of the cars were changed to polygons in place of the original sprites. Reception and legacy At the time of its release, Rad Mobile was generally praised for its graphics but criticized for its gameplay. Sinclair User stated that Sega \\"concentrated on the technology and forgot about the gameplay\\". Reviewer John Cook called the gameplay \\"dull\\" and stated there was little to do in the game other than stare at the visuals. John Cook also reviewed Rad Mobile in The One, stating that it employs \\"some astonishing effects, but little or no gameplay\\" and suggests GP Rider as an alternative, stating that \\"Some will enjoy [Rad Mobile] because it's loud and colourful, but afficionados [sic] will stick to GP Rider.\\" Computer and Video Games gave a review stating that the game is \\"technically superb\\" and has \\"exceptionally realistic 3D\\" but lacks anything to stimulate addictive gameplay. In a March 1991 review, Ace described Rad Mobile as \\"high on visuals and low on gameplay\\". Beep! MegaDrive praised the way the car used the windshield wiper in the rain, and headlights at night. Gale Racer received a negative reception, with Horowitz stating that based on the talent behind the Saturn port, \\"one would have expected nothing short of the best home racing game ever made.\\" Computer and Video Games detested Gale Racer, criticizing the gameplay, visuals, and hypothesizing that it was rushed out to shelves to tie in with the Saturn's release. Retrospectively, video game historian Ken Horowitz has stated that Rad Mobile has struggled to be recognized as an influential racing game, though he reinforces that the game deserves at least some recognition as Sega's first 32-bit racing game and as the first appearance of Sonic the Hedgehog. Martin Dodd of Retro Gamer compared the game's graphics to Power Drift and called the game \\"very good for the time with it being 32-bit\\". Writing for AllGame, Anthony Baize gave a positive retrospective review, calling the graphics \\"better than any racing game that preceded it\\".

The viewpoint can be located directly from a minor road leading south from Earlston just off the A68 and by travelling north from the village of St. Boswells up the slope of Bemersyde Hill. The view is around 3 miles east of Melrose. The view is to the west, and is dominated by the three peaks of the Eildon Hills. To the south west the view is extensive and open, taking in rolling farmland beyond the village of Newtown St Boswells. Immediately below the viewer is a meander of the Tweed itself, enclosing a peninsular of land on which stood the ancient monastery of Old Melrose, referred to in Bede,Ven Bede, The Ecclesiastical History of the English People, IV.27 where St Boisil welcomed the young St Cuthbert to train following his vision of St Aidan of Lindisfarne in 651ad. Often a fly fisherman can be seen fishing the river. To the north west the viewer looks along the Tweed valley to Melrose. Towards the north-west the viewer can see the Black Hill, a Marilyn near Earlston. Immediately below the view point, on the cliffs above the River Tweed, is one of the few remaining fragments of semi-natural woodland in the area. The oak trees that remain are the descendants of trees used to supply wood for the manufacture of coffins in the area.

One Europe, Many Nations: A Historical Dictionary of European National Groups. Greenwood Publishing Group, Ltd., 2000. p. 650. The name is ultimately derived from the medieval Duchy of Swabia, one of the German stem duchies, representing the territory of Alemannia, whose inhabitants were interchangeably called Alemanni or Suebi. This territory would include all of the Alemannic German areal, but the modern concept of Swabia is more restricted, due to the collapse of the duchy of Swabia in the 13th century. Swabia as understood in modern ethnography roughly coincides with the Swabian Circle of the Holy Roman Empire as it stood during the Early Modern period.  Culture  Swabian culture, as distinct from its Alemannic neighbours, evolved in the later medieval and early modern period. After the disintegration of the Duchy of Swabia, a Swabian cultural identity and sense of cultural unity survived, expressed in the formation of the Swabian League of Cities in the 14th century, the Swabian League of 1488, and the establishment of the Swabian Circle in 1512. During this time, a division of culture and identity developed between Swabia and both the Margraviate of Baden to the west and the Swiss Confederacy to the south. Swabian culture retains many elements common to Alemannic tradition, notably the carnival traditions forming the Swabian-Alemannic Fastnacht. A public relations campaign by the state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg, translated \\"We can do everything‚Äîexcept speak Standard German.\\" (see article text) As the national cultural consensus surrounding German unification was built during the 18th and 19th century, Germany was politically dominated by the northern Kingdom of Prussia, and Weimar Classicism in the Duchy of Saxe-Weimar became the expression of German national high culture (Christoph Martin Wieland and Friedrich Schiller, while born and raised in Swabia, moved to Weimar and became two of the \\"four luminaries\\" (Viergestirn) of Weimar Classicism). As a consequence, southern Germany and by extension both the Swabians and the Bavarians came to be seen as marked deviations from generic Standard German, and a number of clich√©s or stereotypes developed. These portrayed the Swabians as stingy, overly serious or prudish petty bourgeois simpletons, as reflected in \\"The Seven Swabians\\" (Die sieben Schwaben), one of the Kinder- und Hausm√§rchen published by the Brothers Grimm. On the positive side, the same stereotype may be expressed in portraying the Swabians as frugal, clever, entrepreneurial and hard-working. The economic recovery of Germany after the Second World War, known as the Wirtschaftswunder, was praised by songwriter Ralf Bendix in his 1964 Schaffe, schaffe H√§usle baue / Und net nach de M√§dle schaue (\\"[let's] work and work, and build a house / and not look out for girls\\" in Swabian dialect). The first line of his song has since become a common summary of Swabian stereotypes known throughout Germany. In a widely noted publicity campaign on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of Baden- W√ºrttemberg, economically the most successful state in modern Germany, the Swabians famously embraced their stereotyping, \\"We can do everything‚Äîexcept speak Standard German\\" (Wir k√∂nnen alles. Au√üer Hochdeutsch). Swabian stereotypes persist in contemporary Germany, as expressed e.g. in the \\"Schwabenhass\\" conflict (surrounding gentrification in Berlin due to the large number of well-to-do Swabians moving to the capital), or a remark by chancellor Angela Merkel in praise of the \\"thrifty Swabian housewife\\" (recommending Swabian, and by extension German economic prudence as a model for Europe during the financial crisis).  Swabian German Swabia within modern Germany (shown in yellow is Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis, situated at the transitional area between the Swabian, Upper Rhenish and Lake Constance dialects within Alemannic) The ethno-linguistic group of Swabians speak Swabian German, a branch of the Alemannic group of German dialects. Swabian is cited as \\"40 percent intelligible\\" to speakers of Standard German.James Minahan. One Europe, Many Nations: A Historical Dictionary of European National Groups. Greenwood Publishing Group, Ltd., 2000. p. 650. As an ethno- linguistic group, Swabians are closely related to other speakers of Alemannic German, i.e. Badeners, Alsatians, and German-speaking Swiss.James Minahan. One Europe, Many Nations: A Historical Dictionary of European National Groups. Greenwood Publishing Group, Ltd., 2000. p. 650. Swabian German is traditionally spoken in the upper Neckar basin (upstream of Heilbronn), along the upper Danube between Tuttlingen and Donauw√∂rth, and on the left bank of the Lech, in an areal centered on the Swabian Alps roughly stretching from Stuttgart to Augsburg. SIL Ethnologue cites an estimate of 819,000 Swabian speakers as of 2006.  Emigration  =Hollandg√§nger= During the 17th and 18th century the Dutch Republic was known for its wealth and religious tolerance, and substantial numbers of Swabians moved there in search of either work or religious freedom. Those with large debts ended up conscripted as sailors and soldiers for the Dutch East India Company (DEIC), eventually settling in the Dutch Cape Colony, Dutch East Indies or Ceylon. Besides individual Swabians, the Duke Charles Eugene of W√ºrttemberg concluded an agreement with the DEIC in 1786 to furnish a regiment of 2000 men to the DEIC for the sum of 300 000 guilders. This became known as the W√ºrttemberg Cape Regiment (). Their presence among the Dutch at the Cape contributed to the Dutch term swaapstreek (literally: \\"Swabian shenanigans\\"), likely referencing the Seven Swabians tale. =Ostsiedlung= During the 18th century East Colonisation, many Swabians were attracted by the Austrian Empire's offer of settling in East European lands which had been left sparsely populated by the wars with Turkey. These ethnic German communities came to be known collectively as the Danube Swabians, subdivided into such groups as the Banat Swabians, Satu Mare Swabians and others (although the name \\"Danube Swabians\\" was applied also to German settlers of non-Swabian background). Swabians settled also in eastern Croatia (Slavonia and Syrmia), and southern and western Hungary,Christian Promitzer, Klaus-J√ºrgen Hermanik, Eduard Staudinger. Hidden Minorities: Language and Ethnic Identity Between Central Europe. LIT Verlag M√ºnster, 2009. p. 196. including part of what is now Serbia and Romania (the Danube Swabians, Satu Mare Swabians, Banat Swabians and Swabian Turkey) in the 18th century, where they were invited as pioneers to repopulate some areas. They also settled in Russia, Bessarabia, and Kazakhstan. They were well-respected as farmers. Almost all of the several million Swabians were expelled from Hungary, Romania, and Yugoslavia during the period 1944‚Äì1950, as part of the ethnic cleansing against their German minorities. There still are Swabians living near the city of Satu Mare in Romania, who are known as Satu Mare Swabians.Agnieszka Barszczewska ‚Äì Lehel Peti. Integrating minorities: traditional communities and modernization. Editura ISPMN, 2011. p. 148. =Overseas= Because of overpopulation and increasingly smaller land- holdings, many Swabians sought land in the Western Hemisphere, especially in the 19th century. Swabian settlements can be found in Brazil, Canada, and the United States. Among the Germans who emigrated to the United States in the 19th century, Swabians in some areas maintained their regional identity and formed organizations for mutual support. =Recent migration within Germany= Schwaben, Go home to Berlin, Leipzig graffiti Significant numbers of Swabians moved to Berlin following the city's being re-instated as German capital in 2000. By the 2010s, their number was estimated as close to 300,000. As the Swabians in Berlin tended to be wealthier than the local Berliner, this resulted in a gentrification conflict, covered under the term Schwabenhass (literally \\"hatred of Swabians\\") by the German press in 2012-2013.Berlin: Polizei ermittelt wegen Anti-Schwaben-Schmiererei, Spiegel-Online, May 4, 2013 N√§chster Akt im Schwaben-Streit - Str√§√ülemacher gegen Sp√§tzlekrieg, n-tv.de, 23.2.2013 Neue Runde im Schwaben-Streit - Die Str√§sslemacher aus Prenzlauer Berg, Tagesspiegel 8.2.2013.

He subsequently lost that seat to Labour in February 1974. He was a leading member of the Conservative Monday Club. Early life Harold Soref was the son of Paul Soref, a merchant shipper of Romanian Jewish origin, and his wife Zelma (n√©e Goodman), who lived at Hampstead in London. Harold was educated at Hall School, Hampstead, and St.Paul's School, Hammersmith, before going up to Queen's College, Oxford. In World War II, he served with the Royal Scots regiment and with the Intelligence Corps, 1940‚Äì1946. Political career Soref had an early interest in colonial affairs, and was an elected delegate, in 1937, to the first All-British Africa Conference at Bulawayo in Southern Rhodesia, held with the intention of forming the Africa Defence Federation. He was a founder member of the Conservative Commonwealth Council, and a member of the governing council of the Anglo-Rhodesian Society, and the Anglo-Zanzibar Society. He was a member of Sir Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists and a standard bearer at the BUF's 1934 Olympia meeting. Comrade Newsletter of the Friends of Oswald Mosley When Mosley Men Won Elections (November 2014) In 1951, he was the Conservative Party's prospective parliamentary candidate at Dudley, and, again in 1955, at Rugby, being unsuccessful on both occasions. He was elected Conservative MP for Ormskirk in 1970 but, as it was a marginal constituency and following boundary changes, he lost it in 1974 to Labour's Robert Kilroy-Silk. Monday Club Soref was an early member (1963) of the Conservative Monday Club, served a term as National Vice-Chairman, and was for some considerable time a very active Chairman of their Africa and Rhodesia study groups and policy committees. He was several times a member of the Club's Executive Council, including 1970‚Äì1975. In July 1972, Soref had discussions, on behalf of the Monday Club, with the Home Office, on the 1500 Trotskyists camping in Essex, which included groups from North America. They were, he said, being given instruction in urban guerrilla warfare. Mr. Soref and Patrick Wall, MP, also raised the issue of 'educational kits' being distributed to secondary schools, which were said to contain information on guerrilla warfare tactics in Southern Africa. They described the kits as \\"subversive Communist propaganda\\". He attacked Idi Amin's decision to expel Ugandan Asians with British passports as \\"discriminatory racialism\\". He was a leading speaker at the Monday Club's \\"Halt Immigration Now\\" rally in Westminster Central Hall the same year, when a resolution was passed calling on the government to halt all immigration, repeal the Race Relations Act (1968), and start a full repatriation scheme. On 30 September 1972, the Daily Telegraph remarked that \\"Mr. Harold Soref is nothing if not consistent\\", commenting that when an all-party delegation began a tour of Red China, he left defiantly for Taiwan. In October 1972, Soref claimed that the Irish Republican Army (IRA) were planning a direct assault in England, and that the IRA were receiving weapons from Libya, as well as detailing their contacts with other terrorist movements. In August 1973, in the House of Commons, he told the Minister of Agriculture that it was \\"preposterous\\" that British housewives should have to pay high prices for beef when there were plentiful supplies available in Rhodesia. In September, he protested to Sir Alec Douglas-Home that Herbert Chitepo, whom Soref described as a \\"terrorist\\", had received a British passport 'in error', and said that London was being turned into an 'open house' for about 50 revolutionary movements. In 1973, Soref successfully fought against the Home Office deportation order against New Zealander Peter Wildermoth, and his intercessions, in December 1973, secured the freedom of Gerald Hawksworth, who was imprisoned in Tanzania after being kidnapped by the Zimbabwe African National Union. He subsequently gave a Monday Club dinner at Westminster Palace to celebrate Mr. Hawksworth's release. In 1974, he was appointed the Club's Vice-Chairman, and spoke at Oxford University in May that year. He had a police escort into the building, but gangs of left-wing students with masked faces howling \\"Death to Soref\\" forced their way into the hall; Soref was forced to escape violence down a back staircase and over a six-foot wall, with his pursuers close behind, jumping onto the back of his car as it drew away. Later that night, the Chairman of the Oxford University Monday Club, Andrew Bell, son of Ronald Bell, QC, MP, had his bedroom window smashed by hand-thrown missiles. Soref, as Chairman of the Club's Africa Group, often had letters in the press attacking Mr. James Callaghan's \\"biased attitudes on Rhodesia where communist- supported guerillas were in action\\". He had also said that \\"the Secretary of State during his recent safari displayed his dedication to 'Black Power'\\". Another of his protests was to Lord Ayleston of the Independent Broadcasting Authority over the Weekend World programme on Rhodesia which, he said, \\"gave more support to terrorists than to their victims.\\" Soref was an outspoken critic of the IRA, and issued a Press Statement on behalf of the Monday Club, in November 1974, calling for capital punishment \\"for traitors and those engaged in civil war\\". The previous month gunmen shot at a London businessman's chauffeur-driven car close to Soref's residence, and Scotland Yard were convinced that it was mistaken identity and the work of the IRA, because of the striking resemblance between the victim, who later died, and Soref. The shooting had taken place at the time Soref normally arrived home, but he had been delayed that night. Both victim and Soref had similar cars. Later, Soref received an anonymous telephone call saying the shots were meant for him. On 26 January 1981, Soref presided at the Club's Africa Group Dinner at St Stephen's Club, Westminster, when Nicholas Winterton, MP, was the Guest- of-Honour. Business From 1959, Soref was Managing Director of Soref Brothers Limited, becoming Chairman in 1976.

Roosevelt on 1 July; the legislative act contained a specific provision that prohibited discrimination based upon race, color, or creed. Its purpose was to help alleviate the nursing shortage that existed during World War II. The United States Public Health Service (USPHS) was named the supervisory agency; it was answerable to Thomas Parran, Jr. the surgeon general of the United States. The USPHS established a division to administer the CNC program and Parran appointed Lucile Petry, a registered nurse (RN), as its director. The program was open to all women between the ages of 17 and 35 who were in good health and had graduated from an accredited high school. The recruiting target was the high-school graduate but college women were also recruited. Nearly every type of media source advertised for the CNC. All state nursing schools in the U.S. were eligible to participate in the program; they were, however, required to be accredited by the accrediting agency in their state and be connected with a hospital that had been approved by the American College of Surgeons. The participating schools of nursing were required to compress the traditional 36-month nursing program into 30 months, and were obligated to provide the students with the clinical experiences of medicine, surgery, pediatrics, and obstetrics. The cadets came from locations across the nation and from all backgrounds. The CNC was the largest of the federal nurse- training programs; it allowed young women to serve their country in uniform while being protected by law against discrimination. Of the 1,300 schools of nursing in the country, 1,125 participated in the program. The CNC operated from 1943 until 1948; during this period 179,294 student nurses enrolled in the program and 124,065 of them graduated from participating nursing schools. The American Hospital Association credited the cadet student nurses with helping to prevent the collapse of civilian nursing in the U.S. during the war. Background The U.S. experienced a shortage of nurses long before its entry into World War II; this shortage worsened with the prewar buildup of the military and industrial upturn that this caused.Robinson p. 27 Professional nursing groups were unprepared to deal with the problem. On 10 July 1940, however, the situation changed when Isabel M. Stewart, professor of nursing at Columbia University and a member of the National League for Nursing, wrote to its president: \\"I believe we should have a committee or board that is representative of the nursing profession as a whole and it should be at work now ...\\". U.S. Public Health Service p. 2 Within three weeks, on 29 July 1940, representatives of the national nursing community gathered in New York City under the umbrella of the American Nurses Association, where they formed the Nursing Council on National Defense.U.S. Public Health Service p. 3 In its first order of business, the council concentrated on surveying nursing resources and securing federal funding to expand nursing educational opportunities.Robinson p. 29 The survey results indicated 100,000 nurses were eligible for military service, and that most nursing schools were ill-equipped to enlarge their instructional or housing facilities.Robinson p. 30 The council submitted its federal aid request for fiscal year 1 July 1941 to 30 June 1942 to the U.S. commissioner of education, who approved it and moved it on to the Bureau of the Budget.U.S. Public Health Service p. 8 The Congress enacted and funded the Nurse Training Program, which assisted in the education of 12,000 students at 309 nursing schools. Through the program, 3,800 inactive nurses received refresher courses and 4,800 graduate nurses received postgraduate training. By the end of the fiscal year, 47,500 students were enrolled in nursing schools but this did not meet the country's demands. Nurses could not be trained quickly enough to keep pace with the country's civilian and military needs. Robinson p. 34 During 1942 the Office of War Information tried to mobilize interest in the nursing profession, using prime- time radio advertisements to focus their broadcasts on interviews, dramatic sketches, and spot announcements urging young women to join the nursing profession. While these efforts were helpful, they did not meet expectations.U.S. Public Health Service p. 12 The supporters of the nurse training programs recommended doubling federal aid for basic nursing education in the fiscal year ending 30 June 1943. Representative Frances P. Bolton of Ohio, a longtime advocate of nursing, supported the proposed increase in federal aid, and informed the Congress that further aid requests for nurse training programs were likely.Robinson p. 35 Creation of the program Lucile Petry (RN) was the director of the Cadet Nurse Corps from 1943 to 1948 Bolton took the initiative and introduced H.R. 2326, a bill to create and fund a training program for nurses, on 29 March 1943. The Senate added an amendment that prohibited discrimination based upon race, color, or creed. At the bill's legislative hearings, hospital groups explained how distressed nursing care in civilian hospitals had become. Support for the bill also came in the form of letters and telegrams. The bill passed both houses of the Congress by unanimous vote on 15 June 1943 and became Public Law 74 on 1 July 1943; with the title of Nurse Training Act of 1943 but commonly referred to as the Bolton act. It provided for the training of nurses for the armed forces, government and civilian hospitals, health agencies, and war industries through grants to the institutions providing the training.Perry and Robinson p. 5 It also contained a provision requiring that those trained under the act would comprise a uniformed body but without military status.Robinson p. 41 The Division of Nurse Education was established in the USPHS to supervise the program; it was answerable to the surgeon general of the United States, Thomas Parran Jr. He appointed Lucile Petry, a registered nurse (RN), as the director.Perry and Robinson p. 7 The federal security administrator was required to appoint an advisory committee to assist in guiding the nurse- training programs. The committee consisted of people in the nursing and related fields, who were drawn from various parts of the country. U.S. Public Health Service pp. 20‚Äì21 On 25 June 1943, the committee met for the first time with government officials to establish the rules and regulations to carry out the act. As required, they were approved by the surgeon general and published in the Federal Register.U.S. Public Health Service p. 21 The surgeon general then sent telegrams that outlined the program to 1,300 nursing schools in the United States and Puerto Rico. This was followed up with applications and instructions sent by mail. Territory of Hawaii's two nursing schools were not eligible for the program because they were in a war zone and Territory of Alaska had no nursing schools at the time.U.S. Public Health Service pp. 23‚Äì24 The regulations required interested nursing schools to: *be state accredited; *be connected with a hospital approved by the American College of Surgeons or a hospital of equal standards; *maintain adequate instructional facilities and personnel; *provide adequate clinical experience in four basic services‚Äîmedicine, surgery, pediatrics, and obstetrics; *provide maintenance and a stipend of $30.00 for all senior cadet nurses, or arrange for their requested transfer to federal or other hospitals (a student nurse became a senior cadet in the last six months before graduation); * provide satisfactory living facilities and an adequate health service for students; *provide for an accelerated program; and *restrict its hours of practice.U.S. Public Health Service p. 23 The standards of the National League for Nursing were adopted to evaluate the participating schools.U.S. Public Health Service pp. 23‚Äì24 After issuing these regulations, the surgeon general said: The CNC was open to all women between the ages of 17 and 35 who were in good health and had graduated from an accredited high-school. Marriage was permissible subject to individual nursing school guidelines. Successful applicants were eligible for a government subsidy that paid for tuition, books, uniforms, and a stipend. In exchange, student cadets were required to pledge to actively serve in essential civilian or federal government services for the duration of World War II.Szecsy p.12 All state-accredited schools of nursing were eligible to participate in the program; each school, however, was required to apply individually. Of the 1,300 nursing schools in the country, 1,125 participated. For this program, the traditional 36-month nurse training was accelerated to 30 months. Senior nursing students were required to work for a six-month period in a hospital or in another health agency. In return, the federal government would pay the schools for the related tuition and fees of the students.Robinson pp. 41‚Äì42 The advisory committee was also responsible for naming the new program. The Victory Nurse Corps and the Student War Nursing Reserve were considered, but both were rejected in favor of the United States Cadet Nurse Corps (CNC).Perry and Robinson p. 6 Housing In its 1940 survey, the Nursing Council on National Defense reported that most of the nursing schools in the U.S. were ill-equipped to enlarge their housing and classroom facilities. In the following two fiscal years, federal aid was provided to nursing schools for nurse training but it did not provide any aid for housing facilities.U.S. Public Health Service p. 10 Even with the passage of the Nurse Training Act of 1943, the problem remained. Some schools were able to rent or purchase additional buildings; those that could not requested assistance from the federal government. Without funds for physical facilities, the USPHS arranged with the Federal Works Agency to allow nursing schools to share in some of the construction funds provided under the National Defense Act of 1940. The two federal agencies agreed the need for housing and other facilities in nursing schools would be based on school participation in the CNC program. The Federal Works Agency would decide where, how, and to whom the aid would be granted.U.S. Public Health Service p. 52 Under the agreement, the schools of nursing that could not otherwise accommodate classes would receive a share of the federal aid for housing. It would include aid for living quarters, library space, classrooms, and demonstration rooms. The amount allocated for construction projects was $25,657.785. The Federal Works Agency projects started in September 1943 and ended in November 1944; during this period, about 400 applications consisting of 160 for training facilities, 172 for construction, and 68 for the purchase, lease, or renovation of existing buildings, were cleared. Nursing schools in all but nine states were helped by the federal aid; the arrangement called for the nursing schools to share in the cost of the projects. Of the $25,657.785 spent on the nursing school projects, federal aid paid $17,397.002 (about 67.8 percent) and the nursing schools paid $8,260.783 (about 32.2 percent).U.S. Public Health Service p. 53  Recruitment  =General= The USPHS recruiting campaign was aimed at reaching the maximum number of potential applicants in the shortest period of time.U.S. Public Health Service p. 26 The primary target was the high-school graduate but college women were also recruited.U.S. Public Health Service p. 31 The selling point was free education in a proud profession while providing an essential service to the country. Appeals to join the CNC reached more than 7,000,000 newspaper and magazine readers, and millions of radio listeners and movie patrons around the country. Pleas were made in speeches, through billboards, and in leaflets. U.S. corporations donated $13,000,000 worth of advertising space and technical services to the program in one year. Nearly every type of media source advertised for the CNC. The Eastman Kodak Company sponsored a full-page advertisement in Life magazine (24 January 1944) touting the CNC as a way to serve the country in \\"a war job with a future\\". The advertisement said young women who could qualify as cadet nurses were \\"lucky girls\\" who were eligible for free training with pay, room and board, and gray uniforms with gray berets. The uniforms were described as one for summer and one for winter, which \\"you'll wear with pride\\". Applicants were assured they could wear something \\"frilly and feminine\\" instead of uniforms for dances, that they would have time for dating, and that many schools allowed students to marry. In the same year, a motion-picture company produced a recruiting film about the CNC called Reward Unlimited for the USPHS. Mary C. McCall Jr. wrote the story and Dorothy McGuire played the lead role of Peggy Adams, a cadet nurse. The ten-minute film shows the way that Peggy Adams decided to become a cadet nurse, along with her training and everyday nursing experiences. Reward Unlimited received awards for the best recruitment film for 1944; it was shown in 16,000 theaters and seen by an audience of 90 million.Robinson pp. 64‚Äì65 It was also likely that many young women saw a newsreel clip of the CNC program at movie theaters; one such clip showed President Franklin D. Roosevelt signing the CNC bill into law and another featured the cadet uniforms.Szecsy p. 21 The American Hospital Association established recruitment centers in all 1,125 participating nursing schools. Using recruiting booths, volunteers disseminated information about the opportunities offered by the CNC to potential candidates. State and local nursing councils, and many other organizations, associations, and volunteers aided the recruitment effort.U.S. Public Health Service pp. 27‚Äì28 In the fiscal year 1943‚Äîthe first year of enrollment‚Äî65,521 nursing students registered. In the 1944 enrollment period, 61,471 registered. In the 1945 enrollment period, 3,000 students were admitted to what would be the final class of the program.Robinson p. 68 =Minority women= African American Long before the World War II era, African Americans were confronted with more hostility than any other minority group.National Archives p. 328 African American organizations had actively advocated for discriminatory changes in the American society and in military policies.National Archives p. 334 The non-discrimination provision in the CNC legislation of 1943 had a positive effect on encouraging young African American women to enter the nursing profession. In particular, those women who could not afford to pay for a nursing education. Some 2,000 students attended 20 black institutions, while around 400 students were enrolled in 42 white schools. Tomblin p. 191 The African American press helped the CNC in its efforts to recruit black women, as did Community leaders. Some of these cadets took part in public ceremonies, and were the subject of special feature stories released to their local newspapers. USPHS p. 31 In 1940, there were 230 black-owned newspapers in the United States. They were publishing regularly in Baltimore; Washington, DC; Chicago; New York; Philadelphia, and Atlanta. National Archives p. 328 Japanese American The Japanese experience in the United States was rife with discrimination.National Archives p. 329 But the bombing attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 by the Empire of Japan caused hysteria among residents along the Pacific coast, where many Japanese Americans lived - including the Nisei generation.Robinson (2005) p. xii The U.S. intelligence found that the majority of Japanese Americans were not security threats and posed no danger to the country. The press, patriotic organizations, and others continued to fuel the fire for their removal from the Pacific coast.National Archives p. 329 On 16 February 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt (bowing to political pressure) signed Executive Order 9066; the order caused the evacuation of people of Japanese ancestry from the Pacific coast states. The order uprooted in excess of 100,000 men, women, and children from their homes and farms, jobs, and schools.Robinson (2005) pp. xii ‚Äì xiii Szecsy (2016) p. 41 Forcible removed, they were interned at ten relocation camps in seven states.National Archives p. 329 Among those interned included Nisei women students who were attending nursing schools in the coastal states of California, Oregon, and Washington.Robinson (2005) p. 109 Many of these students volunteered to staff relocation hospitals, as did other Nisei women after completing nurse‚Äôs aid training.Robinson (2005) p. xiv The non-discrimination provision in the CNC legislation of 1943 opened the door for more than 350 Japanese (Nisei) American women to become cadet nurses. However, this number belies the fact that a Japanese American women was only eligible to matriculate in the CNC program if she could first find a school of nursing that would accept her. Few nursing schools were open to Japanese American women;Robinson (2005) p. xii it was thought that hospital staff and patients would not trust then. Szecsy (2016) p. 43 Native American In 1945, the Sage Memorial Hospital School of Nursing enrolled 40 Native American women in the CNC program. They came from 12 states and represented 25 Indian Tribes. Sage is located in Ganado, Arizona, within the Navajo Nation, the largest Indian Reservation in the U.S. It was the first accredited nursing school program for Native American women in the US.Robinson (2009) p. 94-95 Uniforms The outdoor or winter uniform of the Cadet Nurse Corps The outdoor uniforms of the CNC were designed to be distinctive and to identify each cadet as a member of the corps. There was one uniform for winter and another for summer. The winter uniform was a gray, woolen, single-breasted jacket suit, a gored skirt, and a gray, velour overcoat. A gray Montgomery beret, similar to the one worn by the British officer, General Bernard Montgomery, was worn with both of the uniforms. The summer uniform consisted of a two-piece, gray-and-white-striped, cotton suit and a gray twill raincoat.Robinson p. 54 The winter uniform was one of three designs created by professional designers and introduced at a fashion show in New York City on 16 August 1943. Thirty-two fashion editors judged this uniform and the Montgomery beret as the winners.Robinson p. 53 The selected uniform style was said to be attractive enough to have provided an incentive for young women to join the CNC.Robinson p. 55 The official outdoor uniforms‚Äîwith the exception of blouse, gloves, shoes, and stockings‚Äîwere supplied to the cadets by the institution in which they were enrolled. The students paid for the excluded items.Robinson p. 56 The indoor or work uniforms varied from school to school; these were purchased by the school from federal grants.U.S. Public Health Service p. 30 Work uniforms were worn by the cadets while on duty in hospitals; the CNC patch on the sleeve of the uniform identified the wearer as a cadet.Szecsy p. 29 The insignia of the CNC was a Maltese Cross. A patch with the insignia was worn on the left shoulder of the uniforms and on the student nurse uniform of the official school of nursing. The USPHS official insignia was worn on the jacket lapels and was also present on the silver buttons. On the Montgomery beret, the USPHS insignia was worn beneath the spread eagle and the American Shield. Wearing the CNC outdoor uniforms was optional for all cadets, except when instructed to do otherwise.  Training  Cadet Nurse Peggy Adams (Dorothy McGuire) studies in the bacteriology laboratory in Reward Unlimited (1944), a promotional short film produced for the Public Health Service The participating schools of nursing were required to compress the traditional nursing program to 30 instead of 36 months and to provide students with the four clinical experiences of medicine, surgery, pediatrics, and obstetrics. The students became senior cadets in their last six months before graduation, requiring them to serve in a federal or civilian hospital, where they provided the equivalent services to those of a graduate nurse. During their first nine months of training, cadets were protected by regulation from working on the hospital wards for more than 24 hours each week. Junior cadets typically worked between 40 and 48 hours each week, including classes; senior cadets were free of classes. All state boards of nursing modified their regulations to agree with the accelerated program.U.S. Public Health Service pp. 40‚Äì41 The quality and standards of the educational systems in which cadets would be trained varied considerably. In 1943, nursing schools, hospital administrators, and government officials assured the U.S. Congress the federally subsidized training of nurses would conform to the minimum standards.U.S. Public Health Service p. 46 With his rule-making powers, the surgeon general issued these regulations: > *The school had to be accredited by the appropriate accrediting agency for > schools of nursing in the state or territory; *An institution offering a > degree in nursing had to be accredited by the appropriate accrediting agency > for universities and colleges. *The school had to be connected with a > hospital that had been approved by the American College of Surgeons, or that > maintained standards of nursing equivalent to those required by the college. > In a central school of nursing, the major hospital clinical unit had to meet > these standards. *The school had to require for admission not less than > graduation from an accredited high-school; *The school had to maintain an > educational staff adequate to provide satisfactory instruction and > supervision; *Its curriculum had to include all those units of instruction > necessary to conform with accepted practices in basic nursing education. > *The school had to provide adequate clinical experience in the four basic > services ‚Äì medicine, surgery, pediatrics, and obstetrics; *The school had to > provide well-balanced weekly schedules of organized instruction, experience > and study; *The school had to provide adequate and well-equipped class > rooms, laboratories, libraries, and other necessary facilities for carrying > out the program, and satisfactory living facilities and health service for > students. *In evaluating the adequacy of the school facilities to meet the > various requirements specified, the standards of the National League of > Nursing Education were to be used as a guide.U.S. Public Health Service pp. > 46‚Äì47 Congressional hearings on appropriations stressed all schools should be allowed to take part in the program.U.S. Public Health Service p. 47 When the standards were applied against the existing conditions, they did not seem practical for some schools to achieve. Some accommodations were made for smaller schools by lowering the standards for them. They would be judged by criteria that included the qualifications and number of instructional personnel, their clinical facilities, the curricula, the weekly schedule of hours, and the health and guidance programs. Such schools produced a small percentage of the cadet force.U.S. Public Health Service p. 48 While monitoring the standards of the 1,125 approved schools of nursing, the consultants of the Division of Nurse Education traveled thousands of miles, wrote countless letters, and provided direct and specific support services. The consultants were assigned to an area and each school was well known to them.U.S. Public Health Service p. 51 The CNC program began on 1 July 1943 and ended with the last group of graduating students on 31 December 1948Szecsy p. 16and included three enrollment periods; the first term was in 1943, the second in 1944, and the third and final term was in 1945. During this time, 179,294 students enrolled in the programRoinson p. 68 and 124,065 of them graduated from the participating nursing schoolsRobinson p. 227 and became registered nurses.Szecsy p. 20 The main cause of student withdrawals was homesickness; some married students withdrew to be with their husbands when they were released from the military; others when the hostilities ceased; some failed in their studies; others left for health reasons; and some left because of the stress of a nursing career. The CNC was the largest of the federal nurse training programs.Perry and Robinson p. 196 The federal government spent $160,326,237 on the Nurse Training Act of 1943 for administration, uniforms, maintenance, tuition, fees, and stipends. By the end of the program, the records of all participating schools of nursing had been audited. The work of the field auditors resulted in the recovery of $2,200,000 of prepaid funds.U.S. Public Health Service p. 60 Cadet nurses Cadet nurses from around the United States Cadet nurses came from every state in the U.S.; they were the daughters of farmers and mechanics, of teachers, lawyers, clerks and businessmen. Some joined because they wished to become nurses and others for the free education. In the course of their training, cadet nurses served in Army and Navy hospitals, with the Indian Health Service, with the Veterans' Administration, and in Public Health hospitals. During and after World War II, student nurses restored the diminished capacity of civilian nurses; making a major contribution to the nation's civilian and military healthcare systems. Robinson p. 112U.S. Public Health service p. 76 The American Hospital Association credited cadet student nurses with helping to prevent the collapse of civilian nursing care and commended them for replacing graduate nurses who enlisted in the armed forces during World War II.U.S. Public Health Service p. 34 In Cadet Nurse Stories, the authors noted the CNC program influenced the way in which future nurses would be educated and trained in the United States. By the time October 1945 rolled around, 10,000 CNC graduates had applied for service with the U.S. Army. It is, however, unknown how many of these applicants were accepted.

The Central Front describes either of two distinct organizations during the war. The first entity existed for just a month during the German invasion of 1941, before it was annihilated. A year and a half later, the name was revived for the second creation, which existed for about eight months in 1943, until it was incorporated into the Belorussian group of Fronts and renamed accordingly.  First formation  The first version was created on July 24, 1941 from the right wing of the forces in the Western Front, including a new designation of the 3rd Army and the headquarters of the (disbanded) 4th Army, whose former HQ formed the Front headquarters. Colonel General Fyodor I. Kuznetsov took command. The Front was a combination of the 13th and 21st Armies. * The 13th Army (Konstantin Golubev) had under command ** in the area of Mogilev, the *** 61st Rifle Corps, *** 20th Mechanised Corps, ** in the area of Krichevsky, the *** 45th Rifle corps, *** 20th Rifle Corps. * The 21st Army, under Lieutenant General Mikhail Yefremov, was the other initial component of the Front: ** 25th Mechanised Corps, ** 66th Rifle Corps, ** 63rd Rifle Corps, ** 21st Rifle Corps, ** 67th Rifle Corps. The new Front's air component was 136 aircraft (75 patched and repaired) under the command of Major General (Aviation) Grigory Vorozheikin.John Erickson (2003)[1975]. The Road to Stalingrad. Cassel Military Paperbacks edition. p. 197. The Central Front thus became the first new Front formed after the German invasion. At the time the Front was created its boundary with the Western front was along the Bryansk-Roslavl-Shklov-Minsk line (all inclusive for the Western front), and the main operational direction of the front was along the Gomel‚ÄìBobruisk‚ÄìVolkovysk axis. On August 1, 3rd Army joined the Front, and on August 7 Kuznetsov was recalled to Moscow to be given a new assignment. The command was transferred to General Mikhail Yefremov. On August 8, Heinz Guderian's Panzergruppe 2 began its attack along the 13th Army sector. Four days later the German Second Army joined the attack. On August 17, the 63rd Rifle Corps was routed at the village of Skepnya (20 km to the east of Zhlobin), and two days later elements of the Second Army occupied Gomel. On August 22, the 3rd Army fell back from Mozyr. Under these blows the Front was eventually encircled and destroyed near Chernigov, and was formally disbanded on August 25, 1941. The surviving forces transferred to the first version of the Bryansk Front.  Second formation  The second version of this Front was created on February 15, 1943 from the Don Front. Then Colonel General Konstantin K. Rokossovsky took command, and was promoted to full General in April 1943. Lieutenant General Mikhail Malinin was named as Front Chief of Staff, while Major General K.F.Telegin was made the member of the Front's Military Council. The Front incorporated the headquarters and forces of the Don Front, plus additional armies were made part of the Front : * 2nd Tank Army - Alexey Rodin, * 21st Army - Ivan Chistyakov, * 65th Army - Pavel Batov, * 70th Army (originally formed from NKVD forces) - German Tarasov * 16th Air Army - General Lieutenant Sergei Rudenko. The Front's headquarters was established around 10 km to the east of Yelets. As part of Stavka's general move to integrate and rationalise its Army Groups, the Front was renamed the 1st Belorussian Front on October 20, 1943.

This was widely well-received, and led to a further novel being published by the BBC, this time an Eighth Doctor Adventure called Halflife (BBC Books, 2004). His next published novel was the Big Finish Bernice Summerfield novel The Tree of Life (Big Finish, 2005), followed by the story \\"Let There Be Stars\\" in the Bernice Summerfield anthology Collected Works (Big Finish, 2005) and other stories for collections by the same company. A further Doctor Who novel was published in September 2007, Wetworld featuring the 10th Doctor and Martha, and a second NSA released in September 2008, Shining Darkness featuring the 10th Doctor and Donna. Since then he has contributed a story to the audio play Forty Five (Big Finish, 2009) to help celebrate the 45th anniversary of Doctor Who, as well as written the Iris Wildthyme audio The Sound of Fear (Big Finish, 2009). He has also contributed graphic design work to Obverse Books, designing the cover for their short story collection, Iris Wildthyme and the Celestial Omnibus, for which company he also contributed a story in The Panda Book of Horror. A Being Human novel, Chasers, was released in 2010, as was a short story for the Bernice Summerfield collection Secret Histories. His latest work is The Ghosts of Mercury, book #3 in the first series of Space: 1889 & Beyond, due for release late 2011.

The theatre, part of the Capitol House building, designed by US born architect Walter Burley Griffin and his wife Marion Mahony Griffin, was opened in 1924, and is renowned for its illuminated geometric ceiling. The current cinema is only the upper part of the original, saved from demolition in the 1960s, when a shopping arcade replaced the ground level foyer and stalls area. The theatre was purchased in May 1999 by RMIT University for use as a lecture theatre, and between 2014-2019 it was extensively upgraded, and the famous ceiling restored with a new LED lighting system. History = Construction = The Capitol Theatre was commissioned by a group of Melbourne businessmen, including the Greek Consul-General Anthony JJ Lucas and the US-born Phillips brothers who had previously developed Luna Park and the adjacent Palais Pictures. The architects were WB Griffin with Peck & Kempter, but the design is attributed to US born Walter Burley Griffin and his wife, who was also an architect, Marion Mahony Griffin, known for her work on interiors. Lucas had worked previously with the Griffins on the development of both the Vienna Cafe in 1916 and then his own property Yamala in Frankston, and the Phillips‚Äô had worked with them on the c1920 interior of Palais de Danse, St Kilda. The official plans for the Capitol were submitted for approval on 21 November 1921, with approval granted on 9 February 1923, and construction completed in 1924. It was officially opened on 7 November 1924.The theatre was part of a larger a mixed-use complex, known as Capitol House, incorporating shops at ground level, a basement cafe, a 10 storey office tower perched above the lobbies, with the main part of the auditorium projecting out behind. The office tower is described as Chicagoesque style, with vertical proportions and a prominent cornice. The theatre itself was considered an architectural masterpiece, and quite unique. It was described in the 1960s by the leading architect and academic Robin Boyd as \\"the best cinema that was ever built or is ever likely to be built\\".Robin Boyd, The Australian, 24 December 1965 Ceiling detail Original curtain and stage area decoration The building is noted in the Victoria context for its unusual mixed uses, and for the structural design that allowed them to co-exist, as well as for the daring cantilever of the concrete street verandah, but it is the geometric plaster ceiling of the theatre auditorium that is the most outstanding feature. Composed of angular crystalline forms in molded plaster, it was based on organic design principles from 'the natural world' and are composed in a way which is both evocative of a glittering cave, while it is also distinctly modern. The ceiling plasterwork incorporated hidden lighting of about 4000 coloured globes in red, yellow, blue and green, which could be controlled from a central point to produce different effects, used on their own and in conjunction with the original orchestral scores in the early silent film era to add drama for the spectator. The Capitol was also the home of the first large Wurlitzer Organ to come to Australia. The Wurlitzer was used to provide music and sound effects for the films, when the orchestra was not used. After \\"sound\\" films took over it was used for musical entertainment in between shows. It was frequently broadcast on the ABC and remained in regular use until the mid 1950s. Originally seating 2137 (stalls 1306, balcony 633, loges and boxes 198), it was altered during the 1930s, with the seating capacity reduced to 2115 people, and a wider proscenium. The Capitol is registered with the Australian Heritage Commission, the National Trust of Australia (Victoria) and Heritage Victoria. = Saved from demolition = After the advent of television in the late 1950s, cinema audience numbers everywhere dwindled dramatically and in the early 1960s Hoyts Theatres let their lease expire. Contemporary architecture was sweeping through Australian cities and anything considered outdated was demolished in an attempt to \\"modernise\\" the city centre-this move, considered a \\"self-conscious\\" attempt to impress international visitors, would attract much criticism in later decades. The result was that the theatre had to close. Almost immediately there was a campaign waged to 'save the Capitol' by the National Trust and a group of prominent architects notably Robin Boyd. A compromise was soon reached: after closing for extensive renovations on 17 November 1963, the street foyer and stalls area were demolished to make way for a shopping arcade, now known as the Capitol Arcade, whilst retaining the ceiling and upper half of the auditorium to create a single-level cinema seating 600. The stage was raised within the proscenium by about 6m, with the balcony seating extended down to this new level, and a new foyer created above the arcade, under a void that was part of the dress circle foyers which originally opened to the rear stalls. The dress circle foyers were retained but subdivided off and given over to new uses. The Wurlitzer organ was removed and relocated to the Dendy Cinema in Brighton in 1967. The reconfigured Capitol Theatre reopened on 16 December 1965 under the control of Village Cinemas. The opening film after the renovation was The Great Race, which had a run of two years. Other long running engagements over the years included the films Ryan's Daughter (1970), The Towering Inferno (1974), A Star Is Born (1976) and Superman: The Movie in 1978. With the opening of the Village Cinema Centre in nearby Bourke Street in 1988, Village relinquished their lease. Through the 1990s the cinema was in use by sporadically for films festivals, art house screenings, and Chinese and Indian language films. = Recent history = In 1998 Melbourne city council hired Melbourne architecture firm 'Six Degrees‚Äô to undertake a study that would explore the possibility for the theatre to be used as a festival and arts based centre. In 1999, RMIT University acquired the space in part to preserve the heritage of the building, but also to use it as a large CBD-based lecture theatre. They elected to keep ‚ÄòSix Degrees‚Äô as the project architects, and conservation architect Michael Taylor. Their purchase included the blocked off dress circle lobbies as well as the main auditorium and the 1960s foyer, and the renovation plans sought to re-connect all the foyer areas (including demolishing a concrete floor that subdivided the dress circle lobby in two), as well as giving the building an overall safety upgrade, and disabled access. The budget for this work was $2,200,000 and included audio visual installations and theatre lighting systems, some restitution of the coloured lighting of the ceiling and new lift and disabled access.Six Degrees Pty Ltd Architects - In 2005, RMIT announced that the theatre a A$190,000 grant towards further repairs to the crystalline ceiling. Free public tours were held from 2000 to 2010, ending due to dwindling participants. In 2014, the work needed to restore The Capitol Theatre became so substantial that the building closed to the public. In 2017, an appeal was launched by RMIT to reactivate the landmark. At the same time, the owners of the arcade decided to employ Six Degrees to refurbish the arcade in a complementary fashion, completed in May 2019. This was to be the first full restoration of the iconic venue, with new services, upgraded access including a disabled lift, new seating, and state of the art projection equipment for all media. All the decorative plaster in the auditorium and foyers was cleaned, repaired and repainted, carpets recreated based on original samples, and the decision was made to replace the hard to maintain coloured globe lighting of the main auditorium with LED lighting, able to be programmed in an infinite variety of configurations and sequences. The restored theatre opened on 3 June 2019 to great fanfare.

She is a former news presenter for Citytv and CNN International. At CNN, she anchored CNN Today, World One, the art programmes Art of Life and Icon, CNN NewsCenter, and TalkAsia. She worked for CNN between 2001 and 2014, first in Atlanta at the CNN Center, next in London, and finally in Hong Kong. Since leaving CNN, she blogs on her news and lifestyle blog, The Citrine Room. Career Rajpal at the Copenhagen Fashion Summit in 2016 In her second year of college, Rajpal wished to work at a part-time job, so she did a two-month contract as a switchboard operator at the CHUM-City Building. After she graduated from Ryerson University with a degree in radio and television arts in 1996, Rajpal started a six-month contract to be a receptionist at ChumCity. She responded to phone calls and led visitors on building tours. On the final day of her contract, Stephen Hurlbut, the vice president of programming, requested that she continue working for several weeks to conduct research. Rajpal became Hurlbut's assistant at CP24 as the channel was being launched in 1997. She then became a reporter and anchor for CP24 and Citytv, where she reported on stories for the \\"primetime nightly news\\" such as federal elections, teacher strikes, and homelessness in Toronto. While situated in his Toronto hotel room in February 2001, a CNN executive was browsing through the television channels and saw Rajpal. He extended an Atlanta-based CNN International anchor position to Rajpal, who accepted and started working at CNN in 2001. She worked about 12 hours daily at the CNN Center, reading news publications like The Economist and The New Yorker. While based in Atlanta, she had interviewed Ehud Barak, a former Prime Minister of Israel; Andr√©s Pastrana Arango, the then-President of Colombia; and Moses Blah, who had just taken office as President of Liberia. She covered news stories about the war on terror, Catholic Church sexual abuse cases, Liberian strife, former American president Jimmy Carter's visit to Cuba, and presidential elections in France. Rajpal moved to London in late 2004 where she anchored the European edition of CNN Today and the art programme Art of Life. In 2010, Rajpal hosted the CNN art culture programme Icon. The show's first three episodes discussed Paris fashion and art, guitarist Les Paul's legacy, and advertising. In 2011, she co-anchored World One, a daily CNN International news programme while based in London. In late 2012, Rajpal moved from London to Hong Kong. She hosted two shows that had their first broadcasts at the beginning of 2013: CNN NewsCenter and TalkAsia. CNN NewsCenter is a news programme that discusses international headlines, while TalkAsia is a weekly programme that interviews an internationally known person for 30 minutes. Notable people she has interviewed for CNN include Mikhail Gorbachev, Vicente Fox, Al Gore, Tom Ford, and I. M. Pei. Rajpal left CNN on 4 July 2014.

Rajpal grew up in Hong Kong and at age 14 immigrated with her family to North York in Toronto, Canada. She attended A. Y. Jackson Secondary School where she took part in its Amnesty International club. Upon seeing Rajpal present to a crowded assembly hall, the vice principal requested that she deliver the school's morning broadcasts. Her guidance counsellor, who knew about her broadcasting work, recommended that she submit a college application to the radio and television arts program at Ryerson University, which she attended. Her parents had wanted her to be a physician. Her uncle worked at RTHK. Her mother listened to radio news broadcasts on the radio all day which introduced Rajpal to the news business.
