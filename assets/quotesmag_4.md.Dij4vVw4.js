The genus name is derived from the nearby town of Elfridia, and the species name, E. bulbidens, is with respect to the bulbous teeth of the animal (bulbi- for 'bulbous' and -dens for 'tooth'). It is one of the oldest known 'microsaurs' and one of the few from the American southwest region.  Anatomy  The holotype of Elfridia is a left mandible.

There are nine to ten teeth on the mandible with a greatly enlarged tooth along the mid-length of the tooth row.  Relationships  Thayer placed Elridia within the Gymnarthridae, but the fragmentary nature of the material has precluded its incorporation into a phylogenetic analysis to more thoroughly test and to evaluate its relationships with other 'microsaurs.'

Its phylogenetic position within Olsoniformes has been historically debated, but it is presently considered to be a trematopid.  History of study  The holotype of Ecolsonia is a partial skull that was collected in 1963 from the VanderHoof quarry in the Early Permian Cutler Formation of New Mexico. The specimen was originally reposited at the now defunct University of California, Los Angeles Vertebrate Paleontology collections. The genus name is for the American paleontologist Everett C. Olson, and the species name is for the geologic provenance. A number of more complete specimens from the Morfin quarry in the Cutler Formation were discovered in 1983 and described by Berman et al. (1985), including a complete skull and large amounts of postcranial material. These specimens are currently reposited at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History.  Anatomy  Schoch & Milner (2014) listed seven features in the diagnosis of Ecolsonia: (1) tabular and squamosal frame otic fenestra; (2) prefrontal and postfrontal separated (shared with most other trematopids); (3) preorbital region of equal length to posterior skull table; (4) vomer with a posteromedial process meeting the pterygoid (shared with other trematopids); (5) a supratemporal that is twice as long as it is wide; (6) triangular patch of denticles on the parasphenoid (shared with other trematopids); and (7) basipterygoid region unsutured (shared with some other trematopids). Trematopid synapomorphies include the posterior process of the vomer, the denticles on the parasphenoid, and the supinator process of the humerus. A large number of small scales were also found with some specimens of Ecolsonia that probably covered the entire body, a feature similar to that seen in the trematopid Anconastes; these are distinct from the osteoderms of dissorophids that are only associated with the vertebral column.  Relationships  Ecolsonia was originally classified as a trematopid by Vaughn (1969). At this time, only one other currently recognized trematopid was known (Acheloma and its junior synonym Trematops), in comparison to 13 known dissorophids, but Vaughn noted that the proportions of the skull, the sutural patterns, and the elongate naris were all features similar to those of Acheloma. Berman et al. (1985) classified Ecolsonia as a dissorophid in part because features considered to be diagnostic of trematopids were also found in other taxa interpreted as dissorophids, Actiobates peabodyi (now a trematopid) and Longiscitula houghae (now a junior synonym of the dissorophid Dissorophus multicinctus). In general, these authors considered many of the features that now link Ecolsonia to trematopids to be convergences acquired independently in dissorophids, a hypothesis that is no longer widely accepted or supported by phylogenetic analyses.

Dutuitosaurus is a genus of metoposaurids, a group of amphibians that lived during the Late Triassic period. Dutuitosaurus was discovered in the early 1960s in Morocco and is known from the lower t5 units of the Timezgadiouine Formation exposures in the Argana Basin of the High Atlas Mountains and was first described in 1976 by French paleontologist Jean- Michel Dutuit. Material of Dutuitosaurus is currently held in the Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle (MNHN) in Paris, France. It was originally placed within Metoposaurus as M. ouazzoui but was subsequently placed in its own genus, Dutuitosaurus, by Hunt (1993), who identified a number of differences between Metoposaurus (classically a European genus) and the Moroccan metoposaurids. Features that differentiate Dutuitosaurus from other metoposaurids include relative elongate intercentra and a maxilla that enters the orbit. Although many metoposaurids are known from so-called mass death assemblages that preserve large skeletal accumulations, the deposits in which Dutuitosaurus was found are relatively unique in preserving several completely articulated skeletons (over 70 individuals are present). This is interpreted to represent a relatively in situ preservation, possibly by the drying up of a pond as was classically proposed by Romer (1939), rather than transport of large amounts of remains into another area that would have become progressively disarticulated, as is probably the case with other metoposaurid mass death assemblages. Because most other metoposaurids are only known from a collection of dissociated skeletal elements, Dutuitosaurus is frequently taken as the guide for inferring skeletal proportions and precise positions of different elements in metoposaurids.

History and discovery There was only one successful excavation of the genus Doleserpeton, which was during the initial discovery in 1969 by Bolt and his colleagues in Fort Sill, Oklahoma. The stratigraphic location of Doleserpeton was based in Fissure Fills and the Admirial Formation, which was dated back to the Upper Permian.Anderson, Jason S, and John R.

AHLBERG, and G KOENTGES. \\"The Braincase and Middle Ear Region of Dendrerpeton Acadianum (tetrapoda: Temnospondyli).\\" Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society. 143.4 (2005): 577-597. Print. =Dentition= The distinguishing synapomorphy that defines Doleserpeton are its bicuspid, pedicellate teeth. Each bicuspid, pedicellate tooth in Doleserpeton had two cusps with a separation from the root by a region of uncalcified fibrous tissue. The uncalcified regions of the bicuspid teeth in Doleserpeton were often lost and replaced during its lifetime to support a carnivorous diet. The maxilla contained 60 bicuspid, pedicellate teeth, in which 40 teeth were located in the upper jaw and 20 teeth were located in the lower jaw. Doleserpeton contained marginal teeth located on the premaxilla and palatal bones of the skull. It was hypothesized that Doleserpeton contained a range of 22-25 marginal teeth. Vertebrae Doleserpeton possessed a rhachitomous vertebrae, in which the pleurocentrum dominates in size in each vertebra compared to the intercentrum. This \\"rhachitomous\\" vertebrae is unique to amphibians and its relatives, which is one of the defining traits of Doleserpeton and its relatives. Doleserpeton contained 10 vertebrae in its cervical column, 24 presacral vertebrae, 2 sacral vertebrae, and an estimate of 15 caudal vertebrae that was concluded from fossil evidence. Rib attachment started at the second presacral vertebrae and continue throughout the length of its body until the sacral vertebrae. Rib size increased from ribs 2 through 4, and the decreased in size after the fifth presacral vertebrae. Ribs were double headed to allow a sturdy attachment for muscles to support its body mass on land. Posture Doleserpeton displayed a sprawling posture, in which locomotion was achieved on all four limbs while dragging part of its midsection on the ground. Sprawling posture is considered the most primitive trait of terrestrial locomotion, which is consistent with the evolutionary trend from aquatic to terrestrial adaptations. Sprawling posture allowed Doleserpeton to possess the stability and functionality to move on land while also being efficient and functional in aquatic environments. Pectoral girdle The development in pectoral girdle elements as well as pelvic girdle elements in Doleserpeton displayed the shift in traits that supported amphibious adaptions to aquatic and terrestrial environments. Limb structures of Doleserpeton were homologous to temnospondyli and to other derived terrestrial species.Laurin, Michel, and B K. Hall. \\"Fins into Limbs: Evolution, Development and Transformation.\\" Copeia. 2007.4 (2007): 344-1061. Print. The prominence of the scapulocoracoid in the pectoral girdle ofDoleserpeton allowed them to move efficiently on land while supporting the upper half of its body. The humerus is and attached perpendicularly to the scauplcorcoid. The carpals, metacarpals, and digits of Doleserpeton were allowed for full mobility of its forelimbs and joints to travel on land while providing adequate support for its body mass and size.Sigurdsen, Trond, and John R. Bolt. \\"The Lissamphibian Humerus and Elbow Joint, and the Origins of Modern Amphibians.\\" Journal of Morphology. 270.12 (2009): 1443-1453. Print. Pelvic girdle The pelvic girdle also displays the same characteristics as the pectoral girdle. The femur is elongated and enlarged and place perpendicularly to the pelvic girdle. The proximal end of the femur was enlarged to allow strong muscle attachment and also displayed well developed tarsals, metatarsals, and phalanges that served the same purposes for mobility and flexibility of joints in their hindlimbs. Digits The digit formula for Doleserpeton is 4 digits on the forelimbs and 5 digits on the hindlimb. This digit formula is primitive to all living amphibians with a few exceptions in Caecilian and some outlying amphibious species. Classification Parsimony-based cladistic analysis and Bayesian inference analysis were utilized to analyze 20 taxa and 51 characters to classify Doleserpeton. Finite classification of Doleserpeton still remain dubious because of the uncertainty of the phylogenetic classification of the family Amphibamidae and the subclass Lissamphibia. The classification of the family Amphibamidae is based on the notion that the origin of Lissamphibia is derived from three hypotheses, which conflicts with the evolutionary position of Doleserpeton in relation to its primitive ancestors and descendants.Ruta, Marcello, and Michael I. Coates. \\"Dates, Nodes and Character Conflict: Addressing the Lissamphibian Origin Problem.\\" Journal of Systematic Palaeontology. 5.1 (2007): 69-122. Print. Three hypotheses of Lissamphibia classification are pose three possibilities of Lissamphibia origin: # Monophyletic origin of Lissamphibia from Temnospondyli # Monophyletic origin of Lissamphibia from LepospondyliMarjanoviƒá, David, and Michel Laurin. \\"The Origin(s) of Extant Amphibians: a Review with Emphasis on the ‚Äúlepospondyl Hypothesis‚Äù.\\" Geodiversitas. 35.1 (2013): 207-272. Print. # Diphyletic(branching) origin of Lissamphibia from both Temnospondyli and Lepospondyli The most parsimonious tree showed that Doleserpeton is loosely classified as the sister group to the genus Amphimabus within the family Amphibamidae. Character traits that support this phylogenetic classification include the following synapomorphies: bicuspid teeth, morphological similarities in larval stages, and separation between the crown and base of the tooth in its pedicellate dentition. Paleobiology Physical characteristics from fossil evidence of Doleserpeton indicate that they resembled modern newts and salamanders. The overall size of Doleserpeton was relatively small, with an estimated body length of 55 mm (2.165 inches) from snout to tail. Morphological features of Doleserpeton indicated that they were quadrupedal with elongate bodies and a lizard-like appearance. Their overall body morphology included short limbs protruding from a 90-degree angle, long tails, and flattened skulls with blunt snouts. Doleserpeton may have had smooth, granular skin to adapt to the transition from aquatic to terrestrial environments. Fossil evidence and classification of Doleserpeton predicted that they transitioned through metamorphic stages throughout their life, but lived primarily on terrestrial land during juvenile and adult stages. Like their modern amphibious relatives Lissamphibia, Doleserpeton may have had to rely on the availability of a nearby water source during reproduction and larval stages. Ontogeny The skeletal elements from fossil evidence were well ossified, which supported the notion that Doleserpeton lived a primarily terrestrial life after metamorphosis. A well ossified skeletal structure in Doleserpeton indicated the lack of maturity in several Doleserpeton specimens. The ossification process in Doleserpeton deviates from typical terrestrial skeletal ossification, in which well ossified skeletal elements were indicators of maturity in terrestrial organisms. Variation in ossification in fossil specimens of Dolserpeton infer the possibility of skeletal changes in adult stages in life, concluding that the fossil evidence can only support characteristics that would define skeletal elements and characteristics only up to juvenile stages.

This taxon was one of the first metoposaurids to be discovered in North America, being discovered by Ebeneezer Emmons and briefly described by Joseph Leidy in 1856 in the Newark supergroup exposures of Chatham County, North Carolina. At the time, Leidy was uncertain of much of the anatomy of D. elegans, which is represented only by a small partial skull (now housed at the American Museum of Natural History) and made only brief descriptions and measurements of a few elements, with an estimated size based on the long-snouted trematosaur Trematosaurus. Emmons provided the first figures of the specimen the following year. Romer (1947) briefly mentioned that the specimen was indistinguishable from \\"Buettneria\\" (Koskinonodon). The taxon was not revisited in much detail until the revision of the Metoposauridae by Ned Colbert and John Imbrie in 1956. These authors pointed out that many of the features listed by Leidy to be diagnostic for D. elegans (e.g., parietals comparatively short) were too generic to either make comparisons or to prove its specific affinities. Chowdhury (1965) did not formally place D. elegans within the Metoposauridae. Subsequent authors proposed that D. elegans might represent a juvenile of a specific taxon, but uncertainty resulted from interpretations of the absence an otic notch and a tabular horn, features seen in larger metoposaurids. Joseph Gregory suggested that it specifically represented a juvenile of Metoposaurus but indicated a preference to maintain the name in a form restricted to the holotype and to designate it as a nomen vanum. Beth Davidow-Henry re-appraised the holotype in light of new material of small metoposaurids. She pointed out that if the absence of otic notches was considered to be a defining feature, then D. elegans would probably be synonymous with Anaschisma from Wyoming, but refrained from formalizing this in the absence of information regarding changes to the otic notch during development. Dictyocephalus was thus maintained as a valid genus of metoposaurids with shallow otic notches. The most recent revision of the metoposaurids by Adrian Hunt stated that the holotype was too fragmentary to be diagnostic and designated D. elegans as a nomen dubium within Temnospondyli  References  Category:Prehistoric amphibian genera Category:Prehistoric amphibians of North America Category:Triassic temnospondyls of North America ","title":"Dictyocephalus"},{"id":"21577154","text":"Dissorophus (DI-soh-ROH-fus) (meaning \\"double roof\\" for two layers of armor) is an extinct genus of temnospondyl amphibian that lived during the Early Permian Period about 273 million years ago.

He found that Dissorophus, Broiliellus texensis, Broiliellus brevis and Broiliellus olson all share a pointed snout as a common feature. Geological/Environmental Information Modern amphibians are semi-aquatic. According to DeMar, Dissorophus multicinctus had made a full transition on terrestrial land, indicated by the presence of a dermal armor that made it less dependent on water and better adapted to active life on land. His hypotheses on terrestriality include: *‚ÄúTerrestrial animals live in a medium of low density (air) thus must have stronger support in vertebral column and limbs for static stress. So it is expected that it would have features that diminish static stress such as a dorsal armor.\\" *\\"Terrestrial animals move actively on land so it would have features that assist with the activity.\\" *\\"Terrestrial animals are subject to drying so it would possess features that reduce drying.‚Äù Some functions of the dorsal armor suggested by DeMar include; *\\"Protection against predators.\\" *\\"Limit mobility of the vertebral column.\\" *\\"Reduce surface subject to drying.\\" DeMar's suggestions on terrestriality and functions of dermal armor directly correlates to the Geological location at which Dissorphus multicinctus fossils are found. According to both Williston, Schoch and information from the Paleobiology database , Dissorophus fossils are found in the Clear Fork Division of the Texas Red-beds of Arroyo formation. Description and Paleobiology Skull Dissorophus multicinctus skull in anterior view showing frontal depressions Schoch and Sues describe the skull of Dissorophus multicinctus as ‚Äúshort and broad posteriorly‚Äù. DeMar and Williston mention that the skull has two equal sides and it is flat posterior to the orbit, but curved and has depressions from anterior to margins. In addition, the skull surface shows deep circular pits or depressions situated on posterior portions of the frontals and bound by narrow ridges between them and thus difficult to distinguish sutures. According to DeMar, the skull depth increases posteriorly and decreases anteriorly when in lateral view. He points out another prominent feature of Dissorophus which is an enlarged otic notch. Measuring up to 3.5 cm in length, the otic notch of Dissorophus is relatively deeper than some members of the family Dissorophidae who possess shallow otic notches. The presence of an otic notch firmly assures that dissorophides are indeed unified with the amphibian family because this feature present in all amphibians and lost in later amniotes. DeMar also adds that the depth of the otic notch relates to the length of the skull. In this case, short skulls would have shallow otic notches and longer skulls would possess deeper otic notches. makes a similar observation as DeMar in Broiliellus brevus that has a short skull and therefore a shallow otic notch, as expected. On the other hand, Bolt makes a crucial comment, that the specimens used to describe these anatomical features by both DeMar and Carroll are based on that assumption that they are in \\"adult configurations\\". DeMar mentions that the external nares is enlarged and measures up to 1 cm long in larger specimens. On this note, Williston adds that the external naris are elongated along the skull margins, resulting to an oval shaped outline and oriented laterally and anteriorly. The orbits of Dissorophus are relatively large, circular, and oriented dorsally than laterally. As DeMar describes, the orbits are large enough to intersect with the frontals, palatines, post orbitals, lacrimals, and jugals. DeMar also makes points out a crucial feature that suggest why Dissorophus and Broileillus are closely related to one another than any other species. This feature at the region where maxillary, quadratojugal and jugal meet. In this case, he illustrates that the jugal overlaps the quadratojugal and maxillary, thus extending to the tooth rows. This feature was also observed by on Broiliellus brevis, Conjuctio and Dissorophus angustus. Thus, this feature gives another explanation to the relationship between Dissorophus and Conjunctio, keeping in mind that Dissorophus and Broiliellus are more closely related to each other because they both have a pointed snout while Conjunctio does not. Ventral view of a Temnospondyl Skull showing Interpterigoid Vicuity Another distinct feature that Dissorophus has is that the maxillary teeth extend further back ventral to the squamosal. DeMar explains this extension of teeth further back correlates with the jugal overlap on the maxillary and quadratojugal. In addition, DeMar clarifies that the contact between vomer and pterygoid is lost resulting to palatine contributing to an enlarged interpterygoid. Lower Jaw Dissorophus multicinctus skull in Lateral view including dentary Williston‚Äôs anatomical analysis on Dissorophus reveal that there are about thirty five teeth on the dentary. Additionally, DeMar's mentions that the entire lower jaw is covered by dermal pitting except for the region of coronoid process. He also mentions that the coronoid process extends anteriorly and serves as an attachment point for muscles and thus the most probable diet inferred would be a carnivore likely to prey on smaller animals such as insects and smaller animals. DeMar also comments on a distinctive feature that is only present in Dissorophus multicinctus and not any other dissorophids. He explains the presence of a ventral flange that interrupts the continuity of the lower jaw. Connecting to the ventral flange is a pitted surface of angular that ‚Äúcontinues on the ventral edge and projects medially forming a small shelf.‚Äù He concludes that this arrangement of lower jaw is not found in any other dissopophid, however, the angular projection ventral to the ventral flange is also developed in Briolielus. Limbs Williston explains that the humerus and femur of Dissorophus are solidly built and stouter. The humerus has \\"deep lateral curvatures and wide supracondicular ridges\\" while the femur is a lot stronger built compared to the humerus. He also mentions that the articular surface of Dissorophus femur is \\"flattened with sharp rims on the antero-posterior convexity\\". He adds that both femur and humerus are both \\"expanded on the inner and outer side and narrow in the middle\\". Carapace and Vertebrae The carapace is another distinctive feature present in Dissorophus. Williston describes this feature as a heavy bony covering that is not necessarily broad, but long and heavy. The dorsal section is deeply pitted and the ventral section is rather smooth. In addition, Dilkes's findings show that the osteoderm is composed of an internal section and external section that are ‚Äúexpanded laterally‚Äù. His distinction between an internal and external section is such that the internal section is associated with a flange. The flanges are deeply notched and the edges of these notches serve as attachment points to the neural spine, this explains his hardships in trying to decipher regions of the neural spine. On the other hand, the external series are positioned anterior to the internal series. He also adds that both series are likely fused together by interosteodermal ligaments. This osteoderm feature that Dilkes makes directly correlates to Bolt's interpretations that Dissorophus has a double layered osteoderm comprising both the internal series and external series. In terms of locomotion, Dilkes mentions that compared to Cacops, Dissorphus likely had a more flexible in terms of lateral flexion and axial rotation. Limitation to locomotion is solely based on anatomy of the osteoderms. As Dilkes explains, coupling between lateral flexion and axial rotation throughout the vertebrae, translates to limited locomotion. In the case of Cacops, Dilkes's interpretation on the 20 degree angle of inclination of the zygapophyses indicate that coupling between lateral flexion and axial rotation is highly limited. In addition, there is extensive overlap between internal series and external series contributes to limitation of lateral flexion.In the case of Dissorophus, Dilkes gives more detail that there is larger angle of inclinations of zygapophyses indicating that there is greater coupling between the axial rotation and lateral flexion despite of insertion of the flanges in the neural spine. In conclusion, both DeMar and Dilkes clarify that the osteoderm growth covers the first sections of the anterior vertebral column and grows posteriorly with fusion of the next posterior vertebral sections. This means that reduction of flexibility starts anteriorly and proceeds posteriorly, thus it is likely that \\"as juveniles both Cacops and Dissorophus had greater vertebral flexibility\\" as mentioned by Dilkes.

William Feilding in the Bangkok Protestant Cemetery General William Henry Adelbert Feilding (6 January 1836 ‚Äì 25 March 1895) was a British soldier of the Coldstream Guards. Feilding was a son of William Feilding, 7th Earl of Denbigh and his wife Lady Mary Elizabeth Kitty Moreton. He served in the Crimean War and was British commissioner to the French Army during the Franco-Prussian War. He was decorated in the field by General Chanzy with the Legion d'honneur for saving the wounded under fire in a burning hospital. He became a Colonel in the Coldstream Guards and was Inspector-General of the Recruiting HQ from 1891 to 1894. The town of Feilding in New Zealand was named after him. In 1871, the Directors of the Emigrants and Colonists Aid Corporation began to look at selecting a block of land so they could proceed with their proposed emigration scheme for the labouring class. Feilding, a colonel at the time, and one of the Directors of the Corporation, was selected to travel to both Australia and New Zealand looking at possibilities. During his trip his social standing gave him an entree to the people who mattered in government circles in both countries. Finding the land and conditions of sale and settlement in Australia were not in line with the expectations of the Corporation, Feilding sailed for New Zealand and arrived in Auckland on 2 December 1871. By 12 December he was in Wellington and being put up at Government House at the invitation of Sir George Bowen Governor of New Zealand. By 11.30am that same morning, he was in discussion with \\"the ministers at the Government building\\" about possible blocks of land that might suit the Corporation. Co-operation was such that Feilding was able to request a rough draft of possible conditions the New Zealand Government would be prepared to offer the Corporation by the very next day. Feilding journeyed by coach up the coast to Foxton near to mouth of the Manawatu River, where he was met by Arthur Halcombe whose job it was to escort him to view an area of inland Manawatu that the New Zealand Government had available for sale. On 15 December the two men left Foxton on horseback and rode to Palmerston North. After lunch they rode first to what is now the town of Ashhurst, then walked five miles to Manawatu Gorge where the first roadway through the gorge was being formed. On Saturday 16 December Halcombe and Feilding rode through what was to become the Manchester Block. The two men were guided by James Whisker, who with his brother-in-law John Hughey leased land from the Ngati Kawhata on the banks of the Oroua River. Feilding spent the night at \\"Westoe\\" with Sir William Fox and his wife. During his exploration of the area Feilding spent several restless and feverish nights plagued by mosquitoes which bit him even through his corduroy trousers; he had to borrow a pair of slippers to be able to hobble around as his feet were so swollen. Back in Wellington on 20 December at the negotiating table, an agreement was made to purchase the 106,000 acre (400 km¬≤) Manchester Block for the price of ¬£75,000 from the Wellington Provincial Government. Recruiting of emigrants could now begin in England. Charlotte d. of Sir Baldwyn Leighton, Fielding's wife Colonel Feilding came back to New Zealand to visit the new settlement of Feilding for the first time in 1875. Immigrants had been arriving for a year and life had been a struggle for them. A horribly wet winter had made conditions even more miserable for those who had been expecting green fields and landscape similar to what they had left behind in England. Feilding spoke to an open-air meeting of settlers from the veranda of the Corporation's office, giving practical advice on coming to terms with their life, and sympathy for those who had found the going tough. He tried to sort out any immediate grievances and problems that he could. Great progress followed and in 1895 when Feilding - by then General Feilding - made his next and last visit to the town named after him, he was able to view a thriving settlement. He stayed at Mrs Martha Hastie's Feilding Hotel, then a substantial two-storeyed wooden building with fifty rooms for guests, a sample room, a big dining room, and an adjoining assembly room. There was also a large orchard. Feilding must have felt satisfied to see the swampy clearing he had ridden though only twenty-four years before was now an established little town. Feilding died of cholera in Bangkok and is buried in the Bangkok Protestant Cemetery. Feilding married Charlotte Leighton, daughter of Sir Baldwin Leighton, 7th Baronet.

It is known from a nearly complete fossil skull that was first described by paleontologists Friedrich von Huene and M. R. Sahni in 1958 from the Panchet Formation in Raniganj Coalfield. Indobrachyops belongs to a group of mostly semi-aquatic temnospondyls called Stereospondyli, but its exact placement within the group has been uncertain since its first description. Classification Huene and Sahni considered Indobrachyops to be part of the family Brachyopidae, which includes several aquatic temnospondyls with large rounded heads. However, later studies noted several features of Indobrachyops that set it apart from brachyopids, including closely spaced nostrils and a different pattern of pits and grooves on the skull roof. In 1979, J. W. Cosgriff and J. M. Zawiskie placed Indobrachyops in a new family called Indobrachyopidae along with the poorly known temnospondyls Mahavisaurus and Rewana. The lacrimal bone in the skull is an important feature in classifying stereospondyls, but its presence has been difficult to judge in the single known skull of Indobrachyops. One study suggested that it lacked a lacrimal, which it used as evidence to reclassify Indobrachyops within the family Rhytidosteidae. In 1998 paleontologists Anne Warren and Claudia Marsicano proposed that it did have a lacrimal, albeit a very small one that suggested a primitive position for Indobrachyops within Rhytidosteidae. A phylogenetic analysis of rhytidosteids by Marsicano and S√©rgio Dias-da-Silva in 2011 supported the inclusion of Indobrachyops within Rhytidosteidae. The analysis went against Warren and Marsicano's 1998 findings by placing Indobrachyops as one of the most derived rhytidosteids. Marsicano and S√©rgio Dias-da-Silva classified the genus within a new subfamily of rhytidosteids, Derwentiinae.

Fossils have been found in Germany. While most trematosaurids existed during the Early Triassic, Hyperokynodon has been found in Late Triassic deposits, making it the youngest known trematosaurid. Hyperokyodon was known since 1852, but it was not identified as a trematosaurid until 1987. The type and only species is H. keuperinus. Description Hyperokynodon is known only from two specimens: a holotype snout and a cast of the underside of the skull roof. The holotype was found in Heilbronn, Germany, in the mid-1800s. It likely came from deposits in the Wartberg, a mountain that had several active quarries at the time. The cast, known as SMNS 55910, was found in a sandstone quarry east of the city of Heilbronn. SMNS 55910 is an impression of the underside of the skull table and includes parts of the palate and the edge of the orbit. Based on the cast, the total skull length is estimated to have been around . The total body length based on related trematosaurs is estimated to have been to . Like other trematosaurids, Hyperokynodon has a narrow skull. The back portion, however, is unusually narrow, approaching that of Cosgriffius, a lonchorhynchine trematosaurid with a very narrow skull. The snout is moderately elongated with a wide tip. The anterior palatal openings, two holes at the front of the palate, are widely spaced. The vomerine and palatal fangs, two sets of teeth on the roof of the mouth, are very large and laterally compressed. Hyperokynodon shares several characteristics with the related Tertrema, such as the absence of teeth between the choanae. Classification The fragmentary nature of specimens belonging to Hyperokynodon has led to difficulty in classification. The genus was placed in the capitosaur family Mastodonsauroidea for many decades. In 1987, it was given a more specific classification as a tertremine trematosaurid. German paleontologist Eberhard Fraas referred SMNS 55910 to the metoposaur Metopias in 1889. Schoch et al. (2002) considered the cast to belong to H. keuperinus because it was the only other trematosaurid known from Heilbronn. Schoch et al. also raised the possibility that it was a lonchorhynchine, which would imply that both the lonchorhynchine and tertremine lineages survived into the Late Triassic. Schoch et al. considered the cast to belong to a tertremine, however, because of its large size and distinctive features.

Fossils have been found in the early Permian of Oklahoma.  History of study  Hapsidopareion was named in 1973 by American paleontologist Eleanor Daly based on material collected from the early Permian South Grandfield locality in southwestern Oklahoma. The genus name is given for the Greek hapsido- ('arch') and -pareion ('cheek'). The species name, H. lepton, is given for the slightness of the animal. The taxon is known from several partial to complete skulls and possibly by some isolated postcranial material. Anatomy Hapsidopareion was originally differentiated from other microsaurs by the large temporal emargination, which produced other variable morphology of the circum-emargination bones (e.g., postorbital). It is similar to the more recently described Llistrofus pricei in this regard, but can be differentiated from L. pricei by features such as the absence of a quadratojugal and a frontal excluded from the orbit. Because all specimens of H. lepton are notably smaller than those of L. pricei, and a number of anatomical differences are likely ontogenetically variable (e.g., contact between neural arch and centrum), it has been considered that the former maybe represent a juvenile of the latter, but recent workers have maintained the separation of these taxa.  Relationships  Hapsidopareion is the sister taxon to Llistrofus pricei. Collectively, this group forms the Hapsidopareiidae (traditionally called the 'Hapsidopareiontidae') and is recognized by the greatly enlarged temporal emargination.

Armstrong held no financial interest in the company until 1864 when he left Government service, and Elswick Ordnance was re-united with the main Armstrong businesses to form Sir W.G.

This forced EOC to survive on export orders for both muzzle-loaders and breech-loaders until the 1880s when the British Government again began buying guns from EOC, this time rifled breech-loaders with more robust interrupted screw breech mechanisms such as the de Bange system and its successors.

It is the type genus of the family Lydekkerinidae. Fossils have been collected from Early Triassic deposits in South Africa and Australia. The type species is L. huxleyi, first described in 1889. While most other stereospondyls were semiaquatic, Lydekkerina was exclusively terrestrial. Description Lydekkerina huxleyi skull. Lydekkerina was a relatively small temnospondyl, growing up to around in length. Skulls range in length from in the smallest known individual to up to in larger individuals. The skull is wedge-shaped and has a parabolic outline with convex lateral margins. Shallow pits cover the surface of the skull. Teeth line the palate as well as the jaws, and some skulls even bear large ectopterygoid tusks on the underside of the skull. Lydekkerina can be distinguished from other lydekkerinids on the basis of several skull characteristics. One such feature is the presence of vomerine shagreen, tiny bumps covering the bones of the palate. An opening at the tip of the palate called the anterior palatal vacuity is divided by two projections of the skull roof, a second distinctive feature of the genus. Moreover, distinctive ridges are present on the underside of the skull roof around the eye sockets, probably to provide structural support. History and classification Lydekkerina huxleyi was first briefly described as a species of Bothriceps by Richard Lydekker in 1889. The specific name honors Thomas Henry Huxley, an English biologist who named the genus Bothriceps in 1859 from material in Australia. Robert Broom, a South African paleontologist, provided a more accurate description of the species in 1915 and reassigned it to the new genus Lydekkerina, named after Lydekker. The type specimen and a paratype specimen were described in much greater detail, particularly the lower jaw, in 2007 by R. Hewison, and a detailed account of its sacral region, pelvic girdle and hind limb. Lydekkerina is one of the most common temnospondyls found from the Permo-Triassic Karoo Basin of South Africa. Many fossils have been found from the Lystrosaurus Assemblage Zone of the Beaufort Group. Many, however, are poorly preserved, being crushed or deformed. The variable conditions of specimens has resulted in confusion in identification. Some paleontologists have proposed that variations in skull shape among specimens represent deformities rather than true morphologies. Therefore, characteristics that distinguish different lydekkerinids from one another may be the results of preservation, not taxonomic distinctness. In 2006, it was proposed that the South African lydekkerinids Limnoiketes and Broomulus were synonymous with Lydekkerina for this reason. A second species of Lydekkerina, L. putterilli, was named by Broom in 1930. Its description was based on a small partial skull from the Permian Dicynodon Assemblage Zone. It was later considered to be a juvenile rhinesuchid related to Uranocentrodon. In 2000, L. putterilli was assigned to its own genus, Broomistega. Broom described a third species, L. kitchingi, from the Dicynodon Assemblage Zone in 1950. In 1996 it was reassigned as a juvenile form of the rhinesuchid Muchocephalus. In 2003, both L. kitchingi and Muchocephalus were synonymized with Laccosaurus. Temnospondyl remains from the Early Triassic Rewan Formation of Queensland, Australia, were described in 2006 and assigned to Lydekkerina huxleyi. These remains possess characters diagnostic of Lydekkerina such as the ridges underneath the skull roof and the vomerine shagreen. Paleobiology Because the bones of Lydekkerina are more heavily ossified than other stereospondyls, it is thought to have been terrestrial. Large bony projections on the skeleton likely served as attachments for strong muscles. Joints between bones were well-developed, enabling effective locomotion on land. The sensory system of pressure- sensitive sulci across the skull is poorly developed, suggesting that Lydekkerina had little use for these organs in a land environment. The skeleton of Lydekkerina is similar to those of early stereospondyl relatives such as the archegosauroids, but bears little resemblance to those of the exclusively terrestrial Permian temnospondyls.

Discovery  Llistrofus was described by Canadian paleontologists Robert Carroll and Pamela Gaskill in 1978. The genus name is an anagram of Fort Sill, the historic name of the Richards Spur locality from which material of Llistrofus was collected. The species name, L. pricei, is given for the Brazilian paleontologist Llewellyn Price. The holotype of this taxon is currently reposited at the Field Museum of Natural History. The skull of the holotype was reappraised by Bolt & Rieppel in 2009. New material from Richards Spur was described by Gee et al. (2019).  Description  Life restoration Llistrofus is readily identified by the presence of a large temporal emargination, a feature shared with Hapsidopareion lepton that unites the Hapsidopareiidae. Carroll & Gaskill (1978) differentiated Llistrofus from Hapsidopareion by four features: (1) postorbital contacting the tabular; (2) postparietal contacting the squamosal; (3) frontals entering the orbit; and (4) presence of a quadratojugal. Bolt & Rieppel (2009) revised the diagnosis following additional preparation of the holotype's skull and list three features (only one of which is shared with the previous work): (1) skull length approximately twice that of Hapsidopareion; (2) frontals entering the orbit; and (3) cultriform process of the parasphenoid offset from the basal plate by a narrow base. Gee et al. (2019) further revised the diagnosis based on additional material from Richards Spur and listed 11 features: (1) frontals entering the orbit; (2) prefrontal entering the naris; (3) premaxilla contributing to ventral narial margin; (4) postfrontal excluded from the temporal emargination; (5) postorbital contacting the tabular; (6) denticles on the vomer; (7) teeth on the palatine smaller than the marginal teeth; (8) absence of a pterygoid-premaxilla contact; (9) a splenial that contributes to the symphysis; (10) presence of a Meckelian foramen; and (11) presence of a retroarticular process.

Fossils were found in the Sihetun locality of the western part of Liaoning province, in the lower part of the Yixian Formation, and date to approximately 124.6 Ma. Another specimen was collected near Heitizigou, south of Beipiao. The specimen has a snout‚Äìvent length of . Liaobatrachus is considered to be the most basal member of Discoglossidae based on phylogenetic analysis. As frogs are rarely found as articulated skeletons in the fossil record, the discovery of this new taxon has provided important insight into anuran evolution. The holotype, IVPP V11525, is known from a nearly complete skeleton exposed in a dorsal view on a shale slab. Its total body length (from snout to vent) is estimated at approximately 94 mm. It differs morphologically in many respects from all other discoglossoids, including the number of presacral vertebrae (9 instead of the usual 8) and other primitive characters. Although it had a mosaic of primitive and derived characters, it can be unequivocally placed as the most basal taxon of the clade. This shows that the taxon diverged early from the stem and evolved separately as a distinct lineage by the Early Cretaceous in East Asia. The skull is described as being short and wide and is well preserved. The maxillary region is less well-preserved but it can be determined that each premaxilla bears 18-20 slender and conical teeth, and the maxilla bears approximately 40-50 fine pedicellate teeth. The vertebral column consists of nine presacral vertebrae, a single sacral vertebra, and a free urostyle. Three pairs of ribs were found associated with presacrals II-IV. The hind limbs are remarkably well-preserved and are slenderly built, with an approximate total length of 116 mm. Its hind feet have the phalangeal formula 2-2-3-4-3, with its fourth digit being the longest at 27 mm.

Fossils belonging to the genus have been found in the Arcadia Formation (Rewan Group) of Queensland, Australia.  History of study  The type species and only known species is Lapillopsis nana, named in 1990 by Australian scientists Anne Warren and Mark Hutchinson. The name is derived from the Latin lapillus (pebble) and -opsis (appearance) in reference to the material of this species being collected from within small rocky nodules. There are two known specimens, both nearly complete skulls with associated mandibles and associated postcranial elements. An additional 14 specimens from the same locality were described by Australian paleontologist Adam Yates in 1999.  Anatomy  Lapillopsis was differentiated from the closely related Rotaurisaurus from Australia by several features: (1) a deep, semi-elliptical otic notch; (2) an abbreviated posterior skull table; (3) a broad shallow sulcus extending from the posterolateral corner of the quadratojugal to the posterior orbital margin; (4) a broadly flared anterior end of the cultriform process; (5) pterygoid-palatine separation, resulting in an ectopterygoid framing the interpterygoid vacuity; (6) jugal terminating at anterior orbital margin. The skull and mandible are particularly well-known, permitting a more or less complete reconstruction. Postcranial material consists largely of the pectoral and forelimb regions and a few vertebrae.  Phylogenetic relationships  When it was named, Lapillopsis was identified as a micropholid dissorophoid; dissorophoids are almost exclusively Paleozoic in occurrence with the exception of Micropholis from the Early Triassic Karoo Basin of South Africa. Because computer-assisted phylogenetics were not widely available at the time, the authors made comparisons of distinctive features with those known in other clades and found many similarities with dissorophoids. At the time, dissorophoid systematics remained partially in flux, particularly as it related to several small-bodied terrestrial forms, and Warren and Hutchinson revived Micropholidae, originally created by Watson (1919), to encompass both Micropholis and Lapillopsis, while noting that the latter lacked several apomorphies of Dissorophoidea. Yates' (1999) description of additional material of Lapillopsis and the new taxon Rotaurisaurus led him to create the family Lapillopsidae for this unusual group of small-bodied stereospondyls. Yates' phylogenetic analysis, as well as that of Yates & Warren (2000), recovered lapillopsids at the base of Stereospondyli. A supertree analysis by Ruta et al. (2003) recovered them in a vastly different position, as the sister group to eryopoids, dissorophoids (inclusive of modern amphibians), and zatracheidids. Lapillopsis was found as the sister to Rotaurisaurus in a 1999 analysis that found the Lapillopsidae as basal stereospondyls.Yates, A. M. 1999. The Lapillopsidae: a new family of small temnospondyls from the Early Triassic of Australia. Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 19: 302-320. https://doi.org/10.1080/02724634.1999.10011143 The most recent analysis of stereospondylomorphs by Eltink et al. (2019) recovered Lapillopsis within Lydekkerinidae, another small-bodied Early Triassic group, as the sister taxon of Lydekkerina, somewhat similar to the results of McHugh's 2012 dissertation. This is in contradiction to previous studies in which Lapillopsis has been recovered: outside of Lydekkerinidae but as its sister group, with dissorophoidsPardo, J. D., Small, B. J., Huttenlocker, A.

There is a general consensus that lapillopsids are at least stereospondylomorphs if not stereospondyls proper, but there is no clear agreement beyond that. Previous workers have highlighted the potential that specimens may not represent adults or that diminished body size may cause attraction with other small-bodied taxa, like lydekkerinids, in an analysis.

Fossils of Kourerpeton were discovered in a window of a barber's shop in either Bisbee or Mesa, Arizona. Kourerpeton was named in 1976, with the type and only species being K. bradyi. It was originally assigned to the monotypic family Kourerpetidae, which has been alternatively spelled Kourerpetontidae. Age and location Because it was not found in situ, the provenance and age of Kourerpeton is unknown. The fossils are rumored to have been from the Glen Rose Formation near Glen Rose, Texas. Olson and Lammers (1976) discredited this idea because they noted that the Glen Rose Formation is Cretaceous in age, and therefore not a likely source for a temnospondyl. Several studies have claimed that it is Permian or Early Triassic in age. Warren (1999) suggested that Kourerpeton is from an unknown Guadalupian (Middle Permian) to Early Triassic locality in North America, or possibly even from a locality outside North America. Milner and Sequeira (2004) have proposed that Kourerpeton may have been from the Early Permian San Angelo Formation in Texas, which has also been the source of the tupilakosaurid Slaugenhopia. The San Angelo Formation is in close proximity to the Glen Rose Formation, occurring in a north-south belt across north-central Texas about west of Glen Rose. Classification Kourerpeton is usually classified in its own dvinosaurian family, the Kourerpetidae. Milner and Sequeira (2004) suggested that Kourerpeton may be a tupilakosaurid based on similarities with the genus Slaugenhopia. Like Slaugenhopia, Kourerpeton possesses enlarged postorbitals and reduced postfrontals, bones that form the portion of the skull roof above the eye sockets. Both Kourerpeton and Slaugenhopia possess incomplete-ring intercentra, which form the cenra of vertebrae. The pleurocentra, which also comprise the centra, are slender and crescentic in both genera. Unlike Slaugenhopia, Kourerpeton lacks an incisure, or notch, on the pterygoid bone of the palate. In Slaugenhopia, this incisure appears as a deep notch in the posterior margin of the central palate. In Kourerpeton, the posterior edge of the skull table is strongly undulated, and has a medial concavity. This is unlike Slaugenhopia, which has a relatively straight skull roof margin. Based on these differences, Milner and Sequeira (2004) considered Kourerpeton to be a primitive stem-tupilakosaurid. See also * Prehistoric amphibian * List of prehistoric amphibians Notes 1.

Kaldas expressed his artistic talents since he was 4 years old by imitating actors and actresses after watching any film or a play shown on the television. Due to the restricted life that his parents were not appreciating his artistic expression when he was a child and he had to stop showing his talent for longtime. Once, he reached 16 years old, Kaldas sang one religious song in French and since then the singing career starts to open for him. His incredible talent of blending jazz, classical, pop, and world music was shown through his songs and the concerts he performed by mixing several genres and languages to create predominantly different works. He studied Classic singing for 6 years in Cairo Opera house aside the studies in Architecture. Due to the many talents, he was called by the press that he is one of the few multi-potentialists in the world who could learn and do several things. Looking at his career, it is full of different learning and works he did. Kaldas studied architecture and he worked for years aside singing as an underground singer and as an Art Director, Graphic Designer, Retoucher and Digital Marketeer; which taught him a lot about other sides of arts combining them with business and practical practices. Kaldas also used his intuition and his healing talent through studying different type of healing practices like Quantum Touch, Chakra Healing, Hypnotherapy and combining them with his knowledge in music and voice. Important to mention, his works as a Voice Over, enriched his experience through singing and acting in the Arabic versions of Disney movies and for commercial advertisements as well. He received an international recognition from Time for Peace in Brussels in 2012 representing the Middle East in an Arabic song, written by the latest Gibran Khalil Gibran, composed and performed by Kaldas himself. Early life Kaldas was born January 1984 in Cairo, Egypt, the son of an Egyptian father and a Greek mother. He displayed musical talent at a young age, performing musicals at the age of 4. His parents were resistant as they were afraid that he will not study and this will affect his life negatively. After many ways to convince his family, Kaldas failed to stand up for his talent and he blocked it instead for longtime. The self-taught musician continues to use the \\"musical shorthand\\" that he developed as a child, rather than employing traditional musical notation. However, the house was always full of different music playing throughout the day, which Kaldas believed that this was one of the important learning for him, as listening is half of the work and he was lucky to be present among a family that they like listening to different kind of music and songs. He went to the French school at 1989 College des Freres which it was a great influence on his personality and his taste of expressing that continued with him afterward. In 2003, Kaldas studied Classical Singing at Cairo Opera House in parallel with his studies in the Architecture university, he always had the example of the singer Asmahan as she was one of the Arabic singers could sing different genres and styles, and she studied classical singing for sometime. His love for Asmahan started at age 9, which everyone was astonished that a child listen to a singer died on 1944, which is 40 years before he was even born. Music career In 2000, Kaldas joined the French Christian Choir in Cairo, he displayed a great talent in singing which was a surprise for his parents in the first time they heard him. His father couldn't believe that this was his voice when he listened it on the cassette tape and he had to sing live in front of him as a proof. His music career started from that time, performing in the biggest venues in Egypt then around the world. 2012: Living Abroad After his nomination for the Peace Prize in Brussels in January 2012, and his performance in Paris afterward, he decided to live abroad in France for sometime to be able to learn new vocal techniques and start singing in different country. Kaldas lived in Paris, Lille, then moved to Cambridge and London. His travelling was more about knowing himself more than singing and performing as he intended on the first place. Influences, music and concerts Musical Influences From childhood, Kaldas accepted a wide variety of musical styles, listening to radio stations from Northern Africa, Arab countries, and Europe. His music has been said to reflect his encounters with cultures around the world. The mixture in his family was translated through the choice of songs chosen by his family, as he was raised listening to Classical singing, Arabic, Greek, French, Italian, Spanish and English songs; along with the classical music. This mixture was expressed later through his talent and voice by always mixing different genres together and being one of the first musicians and singers in the Middle East creating fusion on stage. Kaldas claims to have had a perfect pitch since childhood. Concerts Kaldas sang cover versions of songs sung by the Arabic Super-stars :Fairuz, Abdel Halim Hafez, Mohamed Abdel Wahab, Umm Kulthum, Nour el Hoda etc... and from the Worldwide he used to sing for Charles Aznavour, √âdith Piaf, Mireille Mathieu, Fr√©d√©ric Fran√ßois, Jacques Brel, Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole, etc.. *In 2005, he sang cover versions of Umm Kulthum and Asmahan many songs like: \\"Raq el habeeb, Gholbt asaleh, Fakarouny, Nawet adary alamy, Emta hataeraf, Layaly el ons, Ya layaly el bishr, etc. He also sang cover versions of the Lebanese singer Majida El Roumi many songs from her big repertoire like: Enta el mady, Matra'ak bi alby, Lawen maey el ayam, Beirut set el donya, Am yesaalouny, etc...) *In December 2006 he sang a concert of cover versions under the name of (Tony Kaldas sings Charles Aznavour) at Chateau de Ghouri in Egypt. *Also he sang in some Opera Recitals many Arias from Aria Antiche and Opera Roles Like La Traviata, Tosca, and others. *in September 2007, he sang in a Common Concert with the soprano Maysa Orensa, a big repertoire containing Arabic, French, Italian, German songs at the Cairo Opera House *In October 2007, he sang with the Egyptian singer Rania Shaalan in one of her concert in Gomhoreya Theatre ‚Äì Cairo Opera House *During 2006‚Äì2007, he did 3 religious songs and he wrote and sang a song about the Lebanese superstar Majida El Roumi as a dedication to her voice.

The spill was first identified by the European Maritime Safety Agency's CleanSeaNet satellite monitoring system on 14 February 2009. An Irish Air Corps marine patrol aircraft confirmed the slick's presence near the which was undergoing refuelling around the same time. The British Coastguard and Irish Department of Transport agreed that around 300 tonnes of oil were spilled. The Russian Navy accepted responsibility for the incident but disputed the quantity, claiming around 20-30 tonnes had been spilt either whilst washing the decks or pumping out the bilges of the carrier, the Russian Navy made no notification to any authority at the time of the spill. The oil spill drifted eastwards and there were fears that the spill would wash up on the coast of south eastern Ireland or Wales but it broke up before this.  Discovery  On 14 February 2009, the Irish Coast Guard received a European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) surveillance report indicating the presence of water pollution off the south coast of Ireland. EMSA's CleanSeaNet system made the initial detection and reported up to four separate slicks. The Coast Guard dispatched an Irish Air Corps CASA CN-235 maritime patrol aircraft to investigate which confirmed the presence of oil on the surface of the sea around a Russian Navy oil tanker and the Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier. The spill was located in international waters 80 km (50 mi) south of Fastnet Rock, Ireland's most southwesterly point, and spread over an area measuring 6.4 km (4 mi) by 8 km (5 mi). The which caused the spill (2012 photograph) On 16 February, the Russian naval attach√© in Ireland confirmed that the carrier had been carrying out replenishment of fuel at sea from a Russian supply tanker. The attach√© confirmed an internal investigation was being carried out into the cause of the incident and said that Russian aerial surveillance considered that approximately 300 tonnes of oil was on the sea surface but could not tell how this happened or whether it was from their refuelling operations. The Russian Navy offered no explanation for the presence of the oil but began an internal investigation into the matter. Admiral Korolev, the commander of the Russian ships stated that the refuelling proceeded in a routine manner and that there had been no leaks. The Russian Navy stated that it was willing to share data in an attempt to identify the origin of the spill but stated that it was \\"not catastrophic in nature and [did] not present a threat to the coastal environment\\". The Admiral Kuznetsov is normally accompanied by at least one ocean-going tug in case of breakdown, on this occasion she was also accompanied by the Admiral Chabanenko. The carrier was en route to its home port following exercises in the Mediterranean Sea where, on 6 January, it suffered a fire which resulted in the death of one sailor. The British Coastguard initially estimated the quantity of oil spilled at around 1,000 tonnes, later revised down to 522 and then to 300 tonnes, a figure with which the Irish Department of Transport agreed with. If the original 1,000 tonnes estimate had proven accurate then this oil spill would have been the biggest to have affected Great Britain and Ireland since the ran aground near Milford Haven in 1996.  Slick movement  Late on 17 February 2009, the spill was confirmed to have broken into three streams moving eastwards along Ireland's south coast, at a distance of around 48‚Äì64 km (30-40 mi) offshore. On 18 February changing wind patterns and unexpected mild weather had pushed the oil slick, which had not moved significantly since the evening before, further from shore. The Irish Coast Guard ran computer simulations of the spill and expected some oil to dissolve or evaporate. Depending on weather conditions, the spill could have washed up onto the Irish south-east coast in late February and may have hit Wales shortly thereafter. On 20 February, however, the spill was reported to be moving very slowly eastwards and the Irish Coast Guard said that it was possible that the slick may avoid the Irish coast completely, owing to favourable winds. By 23 February the spill was moving at just five nautical miles per day and was south of Cork harbour and continuing to disperse. By 25 February the slick was expected to move further away from the Irish coastline whilst continuing to disperse and break up and on 27 February the Irish Coast Guard confirmed it now expected the spill to disperse before making landfall unless there was a significant change to the expected weather. EMSA continued to monitor the spill until its complete dispersal on 8 March.  Environmental impact  The spill threatened birds, dolphins, porpoises and seals native to Ireland's south coast. The Irish Farmers' Association (IFA) Aquaculture division called on the relevant local authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency to ensure that shellfish farmers in counties Cork, Wexford and Waterford were protected, as the area accounted for over 25% of Ireland's mussels and oyster production. The Bord Iascaigh Mhara (Irish Fisheries Board) tested wild and farmed shellfish on the southern coast as a precautionary measure. Both the Irish and Russian authorities stated that the spill had not affected fishing areas or coastal habitats.  Responses   British and Irish national response  L√â Aisling Both , a British destroyer, and , an Irish Naval Service vessel responded to the scene. Samples of the oil were taken for analysis at the British Maritime and Coastguard Agency's (MCA) labs in Edinburgh, and Ireland requested samples of oils carried on board the Russian vessels via the Russian Embassy in Dublin. The Irish Coast Guard contracted a tug, the Celtic Isle, equipped with oil dispersal equipment from a Cork-based company to assist in the clean-up operation. The tug assessed and attempted to deploy skimmers on 18 February, but the Irish Coast Guard director said that international experience showed that success could be very limited. \\"unless this fuel oil can be sprayed within the first day of a spill, it is very difficult to deal with, and collection at sea has a success rate of about 1%‚Äù. The Celtic Isle was stood down by 26 February after having little success in recovering the oil. The EMSA's pollution response vessel for the Atlantic region, the Galway Fisher, also made its way to Cork to take on board anti-pollution equipment and remain on stand-by. The MCA laboratory confirmed that the oil involved was a light crude oil on 21 or 22 February and further results announced on 26 February revealed the oil to be of Russian origin.  Local authorities  It was reported that both the British and Irish governments had drafted emergency plans for the cleaning of any affected coasts. Oil washed up in Ireland was due to be recovered mechanically by local authorities using bulldozers and skimmers with the assistance and supervision of the Coast Guard. By 23 February it was reported that none of the Wexford, Waterford or Cork local authorities had in place oil pollution response plans as required by law since 1999, but Wexford's plan was almost complete.  Russian Navy  The Russian Navy vessels left the area around 18 February, having completed refuelling. On 20 February the Russian military stated that it believed that the spill might have been caused during cleaning of the deck of the Admiral Kuznetsov. They dispatched a high-level diplomatic delegation to Ireland to discuss the impact of the spill which included experts in the field and Vice-Admiral Vyacheslav Popov, the deputy commander of the Russian Navy. They met with the Irish Minister of State for the Department of Transport, Noel Ahern, and Irish Coast Guard officials on 23 February. The discussions included an assessment of the cost of recovery of the oil and the determination of liability for the spill. On 24 February, 10 days after the initial spill, the Russian delegation admitted, with extreme regret, responsibility for the incident. The high-level Russian military delegation told the Irish Coast Guard that the incident may have occurred when bilges were inadvertently pumped out 80 km southeast of Fastnet Rock. The Russian internal investigation stated that \\"technical malfunction and human error\\" were the causes of the spill. The Irish and Russian governments still disagreed over the size of the spill with Russian estimates placing it at 20 to 30 tons. The Irish Coast Guard expressed disappointment that notification of the pollution incident had not been made earlier as this would have made spraying more efficient and reduced potential risk. However, Irish Coast Guard director Chris Reynolds said he accepted the delegation's explanation. The total cost of the Irish government's monitoring operation was estimated at ‚Ç¨250,000. Bilateral discussions were held with regards a Russian contribution towards these costs.

It is known from the Arroyo Formation in Texas.  History of study  The holotype of Ostodolepis was discovered in 1909 by American paleontologist S.W. Williston in Willsbarger County, Texas. It was formally described in 1913. A second, more complete specimen was reported by Case (1929), purportedly from the same locality as the holotype, that is now the holotype of Pelodosotis elongatum. A third specimen (BPI 3839) was collected in 1965 by Kitching from the same locality as Case's specimen but is regarded as being more likely to belong to Micraroter erythrogeios. The name Ostodolepis brevispinatus is thus restricted to the holotype, which is currently reposited at the Field Museum of Natural History.  Anatomy  The holotype of Ostodolepis is represented only by seven vertebrae and their associated ribs and scales. They generally differ little from those of other 'microsaurs' except with respect to proportions and the distinctiveness of the suture between the neural arch and the centrum. Carroll & Gaskill (1978) reported an alternation in height of the neural spines that differentiates it from BPI 3839.  Relationships  The incompleteness of the holotype and the fact that it is probably not diagnostic preclude any testing of the relationships of Ostodolepis in a phylogenetic matrix. As the namesake for the family, Ostodolepidae, its placement is based largely on the similarity in overlapping skeletal regions with better known ostodolepids such as Pelodosotis.

This genus is known only from an incomplete crushed skull and associated left jaw, together given the designation UTGD (University of Tasmania Geological Department) 87795. The generic name, Rotaurisaurus, is a combination of Latin words translating to \\"circle-eared lizard\\". This references the shape of its otic notches, which acquire a circular form due to being partially enclosed by the tabular bones at the back of the skull. The specific name, contundo, references the specimen's poor level of preservation, as it is derived from the Latin word for \\"squashed\\". The skull was discovered in 1960 at the Crisp and Gunn Quarry near Hobart, Tasmania. This quarry contains rock layers from the Knocklofty Formation, which is dated to the early Triassic Period. For years this skull was believed to belong to a juvenile individual of Chomatobatrachus halei, a species of lydekkerinid common in Tasmanian quarries. It was listed as such during John Cosgriff's 1974 review of Tasmanian temnospondyls. The Rotaurisaurus specimen was contained in a collapsed block of red siltstone which originally overlaid the grey siltstone of the formation's Poets Road Member. The Poets Road Member contained such fossils as a skeleton of the early archosaur relative Tasmaniosaurus triassicus, and is believed to hail between the Early Induan and Early Olenekian ages of the early Triassic, about 250 million years ago. In 1999, Adam Yates established that the skull represented a new genus and species distinct from Chomatobatrachus. He allied it with the enigmatic Australian temnospondyl Lapillopsis, and formulated a new family (Lapillopsidae) to contain the two genera. Rotaurisaurus possessed unusually shaped tabular bones, which typically formed triangular horn-like structures along the rear edge of the skull. In Rotaurisaurus, these bones bent outwards to enclose the adjacent otic notches at the back of the head. Other unique features include the presence of a longitudinal ridge on the outer surface of each quadratojugal bone (which was situated near the skull joint), and a raised rim of bone behind the orbits (eye holes).

It is the only known member of the family Rhynchonkidae. Originally known as Goniorhynchus, it was renamed in 1981 because the name had already been given to another genus; the family, likewise, was originally named Goniorhynchidae but renamed in 1988. The type and only known species is R. stovalli, found from the Early Permian Fairmont Shale in Cleveland County, Oklahoma. Rhynchonkos shares many similarities with Eocaecilia, an early caecilian from the Early Jurassic of Arizona. Similarities between Rhynchonkos and Eocaecilia have been taken as evidence that caecilians are descendants of microsaurs. However, such a relationship is no longer widely accepted. Description Rhynchonkos has an elongated body with at least 37 presacral vertebrae. Most vertebrae have ribs. Unlike other microsaurs, the atlas of Rhynchonkos lacks ribs. Both Rhynchonkos and Euryodus have atlases that bear a strong resemblance to those of nectrideans. Like nectrideans, the arch of the atlas is attached to the centrum, although this is likely the result of convergence. The skull is triangular in dorsal view. The limbs are very small. It has a pointed, overhanging snout that extends beyond the tooth row. There are five or six premaxillary teeth and sixteen maxillary teeth, all of which are narrow and peg-shaped. The palate also has teeth, with rows on the ectopterygoid, palatine, and vomer. The bones of the skull roof are similar to those of gymnarthrids. There are two rows of teeth adjacent to one another in the lower jaw, with a marginal row on the dentary and an inner row on the coronoid. Classification Rhynchonkos was first described as Goniorhynchus by Olson (1970). However, the name Goniorhynchus was preoccupied by an Indian moth named in 1896. Because of this preoccupation, it was renamed Rhynchonkos by Schultze and Foreman (1981). Rhynchonkos was first described as a gymnarthrid, but was soon placed in its own family, which was at first called Goniorhynchidae. However, Goniorhynchidae was named before Rhynchonkos was given as a replacement name for the genus. Citing what is currently Article 39 of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, Zanon (1988) pointed out that if any family is to bear the name Goniorhynchidae, it must be based on the valid genus Goniorhynchus Hampson, 1896, not on the invalid Goniorhynchus Olson, 1970; he therefore coined the replacement name Rhynchonkidae, which has been used in some works. Relationship to caecilians Eocaecilia micropodia, an early caecilian that shares many similarities with Rhynchonkos Rhynchonkos shares many features with the early caecilian Eocaecilia, including an elongated snout, small limbs, and a similar skull. Based on these features, it has been suggested that caecilians originated from Rhynchonkos or another closely related microsaur. Carroll and Currie (1975), the first to suggest this possible relationship, noted similarities in temporal fenestration, palatal structure, braincase composition, and mandibular dentition. In the temporal region of the skulls of Rhynchonkos and caecilians, the number of bones is reduced. Both Rhynchonkos and caecilians possess a primitive combination of palatal bones, including the ectopterygoid. The two taxa also have rows of teeth on the palate in addition to the marginal rows on the maxilla and premaxilla. Carroll and Currie also mentioned that Rhynchonkos and caecilians have a pleurosphenoid that joins the otic-occipital portion of the braincase with the sphenethmoid, a characteristic which they considered unique among amphibians. The adjacent tooth rows on the coronoid and the dentary of Rhynchonkos were also considered a characteristic that linked it with caecilians. Despite these similarities, many of the characteristics that suggested a close relationship between Rhynchonkos and caecilians have since been considered primitive, convergent, or indeterminate. For example, tooth rows on the palate have evolved multiple times independently in early amphibians. The general appearance of Rhynchonkos is similar to that of caecilians, but is also similar to other amphibians that have independently developed elongated bodies. Adelospondyls, lysorophians, a√Østopods, and some salamanders all have an increased number of vertebrae that lengthen the body. Reduced limbs are seen in many aquatic or burrowing amphibians, and are not unique to microsaurs and caecilians.

Rhineceps was found in Northern Malawi (formerly Nyasaland) in Southern Africa known only from its type species R. nyasaensis. Rhineceps was a late Permian (256-258 Mya) semi-aquatic carnivore that lived in streams, rivers, lakes or lagoons. Rhineceps is an early divergent Stereopondyl within the family Rhinesuchidae, which only existed in the late Permian (Lopingian) and failed to survive the Permian-Triassic extinction unlike other stereospondyl families.  History  Rhineceps was originally discovered in the ‚ÄúUpper Bone Beds‚Äù of the Chiweta Beds, North Waller Area in Northern Malawi. The fossil was first described and named by Haughton in 1926, whereby he describes the fossil of a left mandibular ramus of R. nyasaensis as within the genus Rhinesuchus due to its similarity with the fossils of Rhinesuchus whaitsi. Watson later determined in a letter to Parrington that the original fossil was actually the anterior end of a right ramus and not a left ramus. Watson in 1962 described fossils newly found from the same locality collected by Parrington as fossils of R. nyasaensis and determined they were from the same individual. Watson also placed R. nyasaensis as part of a new genus Rhineceps that is distinct from other Rhinesuchus species.  Classification  Rhineceps belongs to the family Rhinesuchidae, which is within the clade Stereospondyli (a Temnospondyl clade). Until recently, both morphology, historical placement and phylogenetic analysis has placed Rhineceps as a sister group to Rhinesuchus within Rhinesuchinae, an early diverging group of Rhinesuchidae. In 2017, Marsicano et al. created a new phylogeny that places Rhineceps as a sister group to Uranocentrodon rather than within Rhinesuchinae (which is no longer a monophyletic group). This discrepancy in clearly describing phylogenetic relationships is likely due to the adaptive radiation of stereospondylomorphs that took place during the late Permian and early Triassic. Terrestrial temnospondyls were devastated during this period, caused by selective pressures for semi-aquatic or fully aquatic temnospondyls to acquire many new niches in a relatively short time period.  Description and paleobiology  Rhineceps was a medium-sized, semi-aquatic, carnivorous, basal stereospondyl of the Lopingian of Malawi. They lived in fresh water bodies, including rivers lakes and lagoons, where they had diets mainly of fish. Stereospondyls were historically compared with contemporary crocodilians and giant salamanders due to their similar position as freshwater predators. However, they likely existed in a niche that is unique and independent from crocodilians and giant salamanders. These niche differences are inferred from cranial stress and structural patterns along with labyrinthodont dentition (labyrinthodonty refers to infolding of enamel and dentine within a tooth). The morphology of Rhineceps thus likely restricts its ability to hunt in specific ways that crocodilians and giant salamanders such as sweeping sideways bites. Rhineceps also used its unique morphology in service of catching prey, including its strong powerful bite and its palatal tooth row to grasp and hold fish in its jaw. Many temnospondyls including Rhineceps likely shared certain physiological characteristics with modern amphibians that cannot be directly observed in the fossil record. Rhineceps likely possessed heightened phenotypic plasticity among juvenile individuals like seen in modern amphibians. This plasticity allowed physiological changes during an organism's lifetime to alter its morphology during development to specific and different environmental factors experienced. Plasticity was a means for stereospondyls to adaptively radiate to many different species and niches. Rhineceps like other temnospondyls were ecological indicator species like modern amphibians, and thus likely were sensitive to chemical changes, UV radiation and other mutagens within its ecosystem.333x333pxRhineceps like modern amphibians had obligatory aquatic young. Rhineceps like other stereospondyls was the result of evolutionary gigantism which resulted in stunted metamorphosis with few morphological differences between adults and larvae. Metamorphosis was likely lost in stereospondyls because extreme phenotypic plasticity allowed environmental acclimation through changes in morphology without needing a binary developmental life history with larval and adult stages. This eventually led to neoteny whereby the larval stage is morphologically very similar to the adult stage. Stereospondyls including Rhineceps only had gradual changes between juvenile and adult stages, and their fossils do not suggest the presence of any type of metamorphosis, major or minor. Greater ambiguity is created because stereospondyls including Rhineceps have traits traditionally associated with metamorphosis, including amphibious dermal pitting. The presence of the types of gills in temnospondyls has largely been difficult to determine because conflicting interpretation of osteological evidence. Phylogenetic information has also created uncertainty of where external gills evolved and internal gills were lost. The evolutionary explanation for this contradiction known as Bystrow's Paradox is that temnospondyls had both internal gills and external gills, with external gills only present in larvae and internal gills that are homologous with Osteichthyes (bony fish) gills that later become modern amphibian gills. Thus, Rhineceps larvae likely had external gills and adult Rhineceps had internal gills, although this is difficult to confirm given the lack of evidence for metamorphosis in stereospondyls including Rhineceps. Rhineceps as a temnospondyl, possesses diagnostic temnospondyl traits including wide vomers, large and round interpterygoid vacuities, otic notches, contact between post- pareital and exoccipital skull bones, and a stapes that articulates with the parasphenoid.Rainer R. Schoch. 2013. The evolution of major temnospondyl clades: an inclusive phylogenetic analysis, Journal of Systematic Palaeontology, 11:6, 673-705, DOI: 10.1080/14772019.2012.699006 Rhineceps fossils are differentiated from other rhinesuchids by the following traits ‚Äúpresence of a vomerine depression immediately anterior to cultriform process of the parasphenoid; ectopterygoids with enlarged tusks at their anterior end; transverse vomerine tooth row anteriorly convex; quadrate condyles projected behind the tip of the tabular horns; vomers with a continuous raised field of denticles; parasphenoid plate wider than long; well-developed transversely wide ‚Äòpockets‚Äô; internarial vacuity between nasals and premaxillae; mandible with two anterior meckelian foraminae; chordatympanic foramen located on the suture between the articular and the prearticular.‚Äù.  Geological and paleoenvironmental information  Rhineceps was found in the South African Karoo Supergroup, a group of sedimentary rocks that span from the Carboniferous period to the Jurassic period. These sedimentary layers were created from sediment shed from lakes and rivers near the Gondwanide mountains on the continent of Gondwana. Rhineceps was found in the ‚ÄúUpper Bone Beds‚Äù of the Chiweta beds in the North Waller Area in Northern Malawi, which is in South Central Africa. The sedimentary rocks from the Chiweta beds originated from mostly river sediments which often contain fossil bones surrounded by pedogenic carbonates. The lacustrine (lake derived) sediment does not contain bone, but instead contains pollen that were used to identify the age range of the Chiweta beds to be less than 263 Mya. The overlap of stratigraphic ranges of specific therapsid taxa place the Cistecephalus Assemblage Zone in the Chiweta beds (the zone where Rhineceps was found) within 256-258 Mya. Rhineceps lived during the late Permian of northern Malawi 256-258 Mya. The ecosystems of Southern Africa were mainly tropical and were dominated by many rivers and river systems. Terrestrial ecosystems are dominated by Therapsids and river ecosystems are dominated by fishes and aquatic carnivorous temnospondyls. The late Permian is also characterized by reductions in biodiversity that limited the number of existing genera and species. Most groups of temnospondyls that existed terrestrially went extinct and consequently stereospondyls were the only temnospondyls to survive into the late Permian and early Triassic by adapting to a mostly or fully aquatic lifestyle. The ecosystems that Rhineceps lived in experienced significant ecological change causing dwindling biodiversity before the traditional date for the Permian-Triassic mass extinction event (252 Mya), likely caused by global cooling and growing glaciers at the end of the Guadalupian (end of middle Permian).

The holotype, a nearly complete skull with articulated jaws, is housed at the Museum of Texas Tech University. The genus is named for Riley Miller, who allowed Chatterjee to work on the Post Quarry, and the species is named for the paleontologist John Cosgriff. Description Rileymillerus cosgriffi most closely resembles the poorly-known Latiscopus disjunctus that was described from similarly aged deposits of the Dockum Group near Otis Chalk, Texas. As was noted by Wilson (1948) and Bolt & Chatterjee (2000), both of these taxa differ substantially from the morphology seen in large, flat-skulled aquatic temnospondyls of the Late Triassic (metoposaurids in North America). Examples of their more unusual anatomy (most of which are confidently known only in R. cosgriffi) include the absence of a lacrimal bone, the presence of a lateral exposure of the palatine bone, a tall skull with laterally facing orbits, and an anteromedial inflection of the palatal ramus of the pterygoid. Both are also exceptionally small for Triassic temnospondyls, with skull lengths estimated around 3.5 cm (compared to those of metoposaurids, which exceeded 50 cm), and appear to have been relatively terrestrial (evidenced by an absence of lateral line grooves found in aquatic temnospondyls). Other than the holotype skull, only a few small, isolated, potentially diplospondylous intercentra were referred to R. cosgriffi. Classification The phylogenetic relationships of Rileymillerus have historically been unresolved. Bolt & Chatterjee (2000) immediately recognized the similarities with Latiscopus, which was placed in a monogeneric family, the Latiscopidae, but which remains poorly-resolved (and considered as a nomen dubium by Bolt & Chatterjee). Affinities with the similarly enigmatic Almasaurus habbazi from the Late Triassic of Morocco were considered but ultimately considered to be largely superficial similarities related to their shared small size; various other differences between the taxa exist. Bolt & Chatterjee considered close affinities with brachyopoids to be the most probable at the time, but they did not conclusively place Rileymillerus within the clade and did not perform a phylogenetic analysis to test this hypothesis, thus designating it as Temnospondyli incertae sedis. Subsequent analysis of Rileymillerus within a phylogenetic analysis recovered it as being close to both Almasaurus and to metoposaurids (see below). This interpretation has been predicated on the interpretation of the small bone at the anteroventral margin of the orbit. Bolt & Chatterjee (2000) identified it as a lateral exposure of the palatine, a feature typically seen in Paleozoic and not Mesozoic temnospondyls, which resulted in the interpretation of an absent lacrimal, a rare condition best seen in rhytidosteids and brachyopoids. Conversely, Schoch (2008) interpreted this bone as a lacrimal in a restricted position similar to that of Almasaurus and metoposaurids. Most recently, Rileymillerus has been shown to be closely related to brachyopoids and plagiosauroids and to Chinlestegophis jenkinsi, a similarly small Late Triassic temnospondyl interpreted as a stem caecilian.

The skull is small, less than in length, and the otic capsule (a hollow region of bone encapsulating the inner ear) is very large in comparison to the rest of the skull. The skull of Quasicaecilia superficially resembles those of extant but unrelated caecilians, hence the genus name. Quasicaecilia was assigned to the new family Brachystelechidae in 1991 along with the genera Batropetes and Carrolla.

A New Pipoid Anuran From the Late Cretaceous of South Africa. Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. 25(3): 533-547. The genus owes its name to the fact that fossils were recovered from an extinct volcanic crater lake of Late Cretaceous origin. The fossil frogs are assumed to have died following a limnic eruption (a degassing event possibly of CO2) by the volcano. The existence of fossil specimens was discovered accidentally in the late 1970s during prospecting of the volcanic kimberlite pipe for diamonds by de Beers Mining Company.

They were amphibious carnivores that lived in freshwater environments. Wellesaurus encompasses several species which were connected when the genus was named in 1971. The type species, Wellesaurus peabodyi, was originally named as Parotosaurus peabodyi in 1965. This species is based on UCMP 36058, a complete skull from the Wupatki Member of the Moenkopi Formation in Arizona. Many other skulls have been recovered from the area and referred to the species. Wellesaurus peabodyi is often considered synonymous with Stanocephalosaurus birdi, a contemporaneous capitosaur named in 1933. Another potential species, Wellesaurus africanus, is from subzone B of the Cynognathus Assemblage Zone in South Africa. Although this species was originally formulated in 1909, the fragmentary preservation of its material has prevented precise conclusions on its affinities. As a result, it has been referred to a variety of mastodonsauroid genera, including Capitosaurus, Parotosuchus, and Wellesaurus. Based on a more complete skull, the africanus species was given its own genus, Xenotosuchus, in 2002. A third potential species, Wellesaurus bussoni, was named in 1971 based on fragmentary skull material from the Lower Sandstone Member of the Zarza√Øtine Series in Algeria. This species is considered indeterminate and dubious, possibly representing remains of a juvenile heylerosaurid.

Life reconstruction of the similar genus Mastodonsaurus Description Like many mastodontosaurids, it was a large animal with a large head. Its amphibian life history meant that the distinct shape of the skull roof would change from a generalized tadpole-like skull type through to the distinct adult shape. The head bones are covered in large pits and grooves, indicating extensive dermal armour on the head. Both the upper and lower jaw had tusks, those of the upper jaw being situated on a 2nd row of teeth on the vomer and palatine bone. Contrary to related forms like Mastodonsaurus, the tusks of the lower jaw were of moderate size and did not penetrate the premaxilla.

It is known from several collections from the Middle Triassic of Germany.  History of study  The type and only species of Plagiosuchus, P. pustuliferus, was originally described as a species of Plagiosternum, with the specific epithet as 'pustuliferum' by Eberhard Fraas in 1896. The interclavicle described and figured by Fraas had originally been noted by him as Labyrinthodon sp. in an 1889 publication and before that by von Meyer and Plienenger in a 1844 publication. This interclavicle was not formalized as the holotype but is recognized as the lectotype. The taxon was reassigned to the newly named genus Plagiosuchus in 1922 by von Huene, who described new material that permitted him to differentiate it from Plagiosternum granulosum; this was also when the specific epithet was grammatically modified. Additional material was referenced and briefly figured by Hellrung (2003) and Werneburg and Witter (2005), but most of the osteology comes from the description of a complete skull, figured by Hellrung, by Damiani et al. (2009). Histology of the osteoderms and the limbs has also been analyzed.  Anatomy  Plagiosuchus has a relatively long skull for a plagiosaurid, approximately as long as it is wide. However, its most defining feature is its greatly enlarged orbit, which forms a massive orbitotemporal fenestra with the loss of several post-orbital bones, including the postfrontal and the postorbital, and the reduction of several others. This fenestra is about 80% of the total length of the skull. The subtemporal vacuity on the palate is also correspondingly long, while the tooth rows are short, confined to the anterior portion of the skull. Ornamentation varies across the skeleton, with the distinct pustules found in many other plagiosaurids found on the pectoral elements, more typical temnospondyl ridging on the mandible, and more irregular large tubercles on the skull.

History of study  Phonerpeton was first named by Dilkes (1990), with Phonerpeton pricei as the only species. The genus name comes from the Greek words 'phonos' (murderous) and 'herpeton' (creeper). The holotype of P. pricei was previously described by Olson (1941) as Acheloma pricei. Dilkes also synonymized this species with Acheloma whitei, which was also described by Olson (1941). Material referred to the taxon comes from the Archer City, Nocona, and Petrolia Formations and was collected between 1934 and 1952 by parties led by A.S. Romer, L.I. Price, and R.V Witter. Schoch & Milner (2014) separated the former 'Acheloma whitei' from P. pricei, distinguishing it by the shorter and more rounded external naris and an otic notch that was not slit-like. They restricted P. pricei to the specimens from the Archer City Formation and P. whitei to the specimens from the Petrolia Formation.  Anatomy  Phonerpeton is represented only by relatively small specimens compared to the much larger Acheloma. Dilkes (1990) diagnosed Phonerpeton by the semilunar curvature of the squamosal, doming of the parietals along the midline, a closed basicranial joint with a clear suture between the pterygoid and the basipterygoid process of the parasphenoid (the basicranial joint), an unossified sphenethmoid, long and slender mid-dorsal ribs, a radius with a semicircular cross section, and a ridge along the anterolateral edge of the ulna. He differentiated it from Acheloma by the large and posteriorly open otic notch, a posterodorsal process of the quadrate consisting of two sheets of bone separated by a poorly ossified region, a semilunar curvature of the squamosal, and an unfused basicranial joint. Schoch & Milner (2014) retained only the absence of a slit- like notch (which is found in Acheloma) in the diagnosis.  Phylogeny  Phonerpeton is typically recovered as being most closely related to the other long-snouted trematopid from North America, Acheloma.

History of study  Pariotichus was collected by Jacob Boll from the Wichita Group of Texas in 1878 and described by American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope in the same year. It is one of the first 'microsaurs' to be described from North America. The type species is Pariotichus brachyops, which remains the only presently recognized species of the genus. Other species of Pariotichus were described, mostly by Cope, that have subsequently been identified as captorhinomorph reptiles (including the well-known Captorhinus aguti) and were reassigned by Case (1911). One other species, \\"Pariotichus megalops\\" is a junior synonym of the dvinosaur temnospondyl Isodectes obtusus. The osteology and relationships of P. brachyops were subsequently reviewed by Gregory et al. (1956) and Carroll & Gaskill (1978).  Anatomy  The holotype and only specimen of Pariotichus is a partial skull currently reposited at the American Museum of Natural History. The relatively poor preservation has complicated attempts to properly characterize its anatomy relative to other early Permian gymnarthrids from Texas, particularly the smaller Cardiocephalus and the larger Euryodus. General attributes of the skull such as proportions and dental morphology conform to those of other gymnarthrids. The most recent revision by Carroll & Gaskill (1978) did not present a diagnosis for the genus or species.

Born in Dublin to John and Charlotte Doherty, she moved to England with her family and by 1891 was living in London. Norah married Charles Richard Dacre Fox in 1909. Political activity Norah was a prominent member of the Women's Social and Political Union and served as general secretary. From May to July 1914 she was imprisoned three times in Holloway Prison for \\"acts of terrorism\\"; she received a WSPU Hunger Strike Medal with three bars.http://www.spink.com/news/news_archive/6007.asp In 1918 she stood as an independent candidate in Richmond (Surrey) for election to the Parliament of the United Kingdom but was not elected.Feminine fascism: women in Britain's fascist movement by Julie V. Gottlieb p149 The same year she campaigned for the internment of enemy aliens in collaboration with the British Empire Union and the National Party. Norah Elam stated publicly in The Times that she was never a member of the Women's Freedom League (contrary to some reports). Elam claimed to be a founding member of the London and Provincial Anti-Vivisection Society (LPAVS). Documentary evidence of this has not been found, but it is known that she was a member from about the time of its inception circa 1900. In the 1930s she had published under the auspices of the LPAVS two pamphlets: \\"The MRC: What it is and How it Works\\" and \\"The Vitamin Survey\\". The pamphlets were widely distributed throughout the UK, including public libraries. By the 1930s, she had separated from her husband, and was living with Edward Descou Dudley Vallance Elam whose surname she adopted. They lived in Sussex where they were active in the local Conservative Party, however they defected to Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists (BUF) soon after its creation in 1932 and she became prominent in the women's section. During this time, she encountered Wilfred Risdon, Director of Propaganda 1933‚Äì4, who was later a colleague in the LPAVS. She was a frequent contributor to the fascist press and in 1937 was put forward as a candidate for the BUF for the Northampton constituency, but, because of the war, the election never took place. Mosley used her suffragette past to counter the criticism that National Socialism was anti-feminist saying that her prospective candidacy \\"killed for all time the suggestion that National Socialism proposed putting British women back in the home\\". In 1940 Norah and Dudley Elam were arrested as Defence Regulation 18B detainees and she was interned in Holloway Prison with several other female fascists including Diana Mosley. Family Elam had one son, Evelyn (born 1922). Her granddaughter, Angela McPherson, described in a BBC documentary that she had no idea until 2002 of the role Elam played at the centre of the fascist movement. Angela knew that Elam had been a suffragette who claimed to have been close to the Pankhursts; a sudden decision to search online for information about Norah Elam started to throw up information she had not been aware of. Angela felt that she had subconsciously blocked out disturbing memories of the stories her grandmother told her as a child, which were to affect her family. She described Elam as a \\"dreadful racist\\". They feel that she emotionally damaged her son, turning him into a \\"bullying misogynist\\" imitation of Norah's own father.https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00pk7zp/Mother_Was_A_Blackshirt/?from=r&id;=35227e69-fcbf-45d7-8295-2c78e9703b74.0 A biography, Mosley's Old Suffragette, has been written by Susan McPherson and Angela McPherson.

It is known from the Early Permian of the southwestern United States, with most fossil specimens having been found in the Texas Red Beds. The type species of Trimerorhachis, T. insignis, was named by American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope in 1878. Cope named a second species from Texas, T. mesops, in 1896. The species T. rogersi (named in 1955) and T. greggi (named in 2013) are also from Texas, and the species T. sandovalensis (named in 1980) is from New Mexico. Description Dorsal view of a skull of Trimerorhachis insignis, part of a slab containing a large death assemblage of Trimerorhachis individuals (AMNH 4569) Ventral view of several skeletons of Trimerorhachis insignis, also part of the death assemblage The length of the largest specimens of Trimerorhachis is estimated to have been almost a metre (3.3 feet) in length. Trimerorhachis has a large triangular head with upward-facing eyes positioned near the front of the skull. The trunk is long and the limbs are relatively short. The presence of a branchial apparatus indicates that Trimerorhachis had external gills in life, much like the modern axolotl. The body of Trimerorhachis is also completely covered by small and very thin osteoderms, which overlap and can be up to 20 layers thick. These osteoderms act as an armor-like covering, especially around the tail. Their weight may have helped Trimerorhachis sink to the bottom of lakes and rivers where it would feed. History Edward Drinker Cope's illustration of fossils of Trimerorhachis insignis. Trimerorhachis was first described by Edward Drinker Cope in 1878. Specimens are often preserved as masses of bones that are mixed together and densely packed in slabs of rock. Fossils are rarely found in articulation, although a slab of rock has been found with sixteen skulls and their associated vertebrae in an intact position. Most of these fossils preserve skulls and dorsal vertebrae, but rarely any other bones. Paleontologist S.W. Williston of the University of Chicago commented in 1915 that \\"it will only be by the fortunate discovery of a connected skeleton that the tail, ribs, and feet will be made known.\\" A nearly complete specimen was discovered the following year near Seymour, Texas, and Williston was able to describe the entire postcranial skeleton of Trimerorhachis. In 1955, paleontologist Edwin Harris Colbert described the scales of Trimerorhachis. He noted that they were oval-shaped and overlapping and that each had a base layer of longitudinal striations covered by another layer ring-like ridges, the growth rings of the scales. The scales were more similar to fish scales than they were to reptile scales. In 1979, paleontologist Everett C. Olson claimed that there were no such scales in Trimerorhachis, and that Colbert was incorrect in his interpretation of the body covering of Trimerorhachis. A second species called T. sandovalensis was named from New Mexico in 1980. A nearly complete skeleton from the Abo Formation near Jemez Springs has been designated the holotype, but other fossils of the species are found throughout the state, giving it a wide distribution. Paleobiology Trimerorhachis insignis life restoration Environment Trimerorhachis was probably a fully aquatic temnospondyl. Like most dvinosaurs, it had external gills. The interclavicle and clavicle of the pectoral girdle are both very large, a feature that is shared with other aquatic temnospondyls. Many bones are poorly ossified, indicating that Trimerorhachis was poorly suited for movement on land. Trimerorhachis was probably an aquatic predator that fed on fish and small vertebrates. Microanatomical data also suggest a fairly aquatic lifestyle, as shown by the obvious osteosclerosis of its femur. During the Early Permian, the area of New Mexico and Texas was a broad coastal plain that stretched from an ocean in the south to highlands in the north. Other common animals that lived alongside Trimerorhachis included lungfish and crossopterygians, the lepospondyl Diplocaulus, and the large sail-backed synapsid Dimetrodon. Brooding Small bones that likely belong to immature Trimerorhachis individuals have been found in the pharyngeal pouches of larger Trimerorhachis specimens. At first these bones were thought to be part of the branchial arches which surround the pouch, or remains of prey that had just been eaten before the animal died. If Trimerorhachis was a mouth brooder, the closest living analogue would be Darwin's Frog, which broods its young in its vocal sac. The bones in Trimerorhachis belong to juveniles that were much larger than those of Darwin's Frog, however. The young of the Gastric-brooding frog of Australia are comparable in size to those of Trimerorhachis but are brooded in the stomach rather than the throat. The number of brooded young in Darwin's Frog and the Gastric-brooding frog is also much higher than that of Trimerorhachis, as only a few individuals can be distinguished in the collection of bones. The only living amphibian that raises similarly sized young is the Golden coqu√≠, although it does so through ovovivipary rather than brooding. Another possible explanation for the small bones is that they were originally located in the throat and were pushed into the pharyngeal pouch during fossilization. If this was the case, Trimerorhachis may have eaten its young instead of brooding them. This type of cannibalism is widespread in living amphibians, and most likely occurred among some prehistoric amphibians as well.

Known from a single species, Trihecaton howardinus, this genus is distinctive compared to other microsaurs due to possessing a number of plesiomorphic (\\"primitive\\") features relative to the rest of the group. These include large intercentra (wedge-like components of the vertebrae), folded enamel, and a large coronoid process of the jaw. Its classification is controversial due to combining a long body with strong limbs, features which typically are not present at the same time in other microsaurs. Due to its distinctiveness, Trihecaton has been given its own monospecific family, Trihecatontidae.  Discovery  Trihecaton is known from well-preserved fossils discovered in Fremont County, Colorado by a UCLA field expedition in 1970. These fossils were found at a quarry near the town of Howard. The quarry preserved sediments from the Sangre de Cristo Formation, a geological formation dated to the Late Carboniferous period, specifically the Missourian subsection near the end of the Pennsylvanian subperiod. Trihecaton fossils are known from a narrow band of shale in the quarry, a layer known as \\"Interval 300\\". The generic name Trihecaton references Interval 300 while the specific name T. howardinus is named after the nearby town. The holotype fossil, originally called UCLA VP 1743, is a well-preserved skeleton lacking most of the skull and large portions of the hip, hindlimbs, and tail. However, a second fossil, UCLA VP 1744, incorporates a string of tail vertebrae and was found right next to the holotype, indicating that it was probably from the same individual. These fossils were described in 1972 as part of one of Peter Paul Vaughn's reviews of new Sangre de Cristo fauna. Vaughn also named a new family, Trihecatontidae, specifically for the new genus. In 1987, Vaughn's collections were moved to the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, with specimens UCLA VP 1743 and 1744 now known as CM 47681 and 47682.  Description  Most of the skull bones were not preserved, with the exception of both lower jaws as well as a toothed maxilla bone. All of the teeth are slender and conical, and their internal structure has shallowly folded enamel unlike almost all other microsaurs. The teeth are largest right behind the tip of the snout and diminish in size towards the back of the mouth. The complete left mandible was 2.6 centimeters (1.0 inches) in length, indicating that the skull was similar in size. The mandible would have preserved approximately nineteen teeth, further back it rises up into a pronounced coronoid process. A diagram showing vertebrae from Trihecaton. Note the large intercentra and different heights of adjacent neural spines. The body was fairly long, with about 36 vertebrae in the presacral vertebral column (i.e. the portion between the head and the hip). The holotype's presacral vertebral column was 16 cm (6.3 inches) long. The presacral vertebrae have plate-like neural spines on top which alternate in appearance. Some neural spines are low and ridge-like while others are taller towards the rear of their respective vertebrae. This switch between \\"short\\" and \\"tall\\"-type neural spines seems to alternate through most (but not all) of the backbone. The \\"tall\\"-type neural spines towards the rear of the body split longitudinally, while those towards the front stay intact. The atlas vertebra was similar to that of other microsaurs, with a central spine-like knob (known as an odontoid process), a pair of adjacent wing-like facets for the braincase, and a deep pit for the notochord visible from behind. The rest of the vertebrae are gastrocentrous, meaning that they have large main portions known as pleurocentra, as well as somewhat smaller crescent-shaped bones known as intercentra, which wedge between the pleurocentra throughout the body. Most microsaurs have diminished or absent intercentra, but Trihecaton has somewhat large ones, albeit not as large as the pleurocentra. Ribs, when preserved, contact both the intercentra and pleurocentra. The ribs are tapered towards the rear of the body and have expanded tips towards the front, although the first few ribs were missing. The referred tail vertebrae are simple, with short neural spines and haemal arches fused to the intercentra. The interclavicle (the middle element of the shoulder girdle) was broad and T-shaped, with a remarkably short rear prong. The humerus (upper arm bone) was robust and twisted, with a distinct entepicondylar foramen. Other preserved bones of the shoulder and arm were similar to those of the large microsaur Pantylus. The hip was not well preserved, but the femur (thigh bone) was present, with an S-shaped shaft constricted in the middle. The skeletal remains as a whole were covered with thin, oblong scales.  Classification  In various aspects of the general body shape, vertebral construction, and limbs, Trihecaton is clearly a member of a group of lizard-like Paleozoic amphibians called microsaurs. Although it is far from the oldest member of the group, Trihecaton possesses several plesiomorphic (\\"primitive\\") features which indicate that it had a very basal position compared to other microsaurs. For example, no other microsaurs possessed large intercentra with rib facets (in the body) or haemal spines (in the tail), though Microbrachis did have small intercentra and Pantylus did have small haemal spines. In addition, Trihecaton's folded enamel is more consistent with larger \\"labyrinthodonts\\", a paraphyletic grade of crocodile- like amphibians which the smaller and more specialized microsaurs are probably descended from. The jaw generally resembles that of the eel-like adelogyrinids considering its large coronoid process, which is small in most microsaurs. Trihecaton's relation to specific microsaur subgroups is uncertain. The elongated body and retention of intercentra is akin to the feeble-limbed microbrachids, but the robust limbs of Trihecaton resemble those of short- bodied microsaurs like pantylids and tuditanids. Carroll & Gaskill (1978) noted that the proportions and intercentra of Trihecaton were also shared with goniorhynchids. However, there is not enough shared material to provide specific comparisons, and in some aspects, such as the construction of the shoulder girdle, Trihecaton clearly differed from goniorhynchids. Carroll & Gaskill preferred not to consider Trihecaton close to any other family of microsaurs, instead considering it an independent relic of the origin of microsaurs. A series of phylogenetic analyses by Marjanovic & Laurin (2019) included Trihecaton, though with inconclusive results. Like many other studies, they concluded that microsaurs were a paraphyletic grade of amphibians, with most forming a group with a single ancestor, yet a few primitive members (i.e. Microbrachis and Hyloplesion) formed a branch with non-microsaurian holospondyls like diplocaulids and aistopods. Trihecaton jumps between these two branches based on different hypotheses for the position of lissamphibians (modern amphibians like frogs and salamanders). When all lissamphibians are considered to be descended from microsaurs, Trihecaton is equally likely to be close to the Microbrachis + Hyloplesion + Holospondyli branch, or alternatively in the main microsaur group intermediate between ostodolepidids, gymnarthrids, and Saxonerpeton. When lissamphibians are all considered to be temnospondyls unrelated to microsaurs, the structure of Microsauria alters to cement Trihecaton as closer to the Microbrachis branch. Oddly enough, re-adding caecilians to Microsauria moves Trihecaton much closer to ostodolepidids and gymnarthrids. This is also the position found by a bootstrap and bayesian analyses of Marjanovic & Laurin's data. Evidently there is still a lack of resolution for Trihecaton's position, especially considering how interpretations of lissamphibian origins differ wildly between different amphibian-oriented paleontologists.

It is known from the early Permian of North America (Oklahoma and Texas).  History of study  Tersomius was first named in 1910 by American paleontologist E.C. Case based on a partial skull collected from the Archer City Formation of Texas. The type species is T. texensis, in reference to its geographic provenance. The brief original description was supplemented by a lengthier redescription of the holotype and description of new material by Carroll (1964). At least two of these specimens do not belong to any species of Tersomius and were reassigned by Maddin et al. (2013), which has led some authors to consider it as a potential \\"wastebasket taxon.\\" Material referred to Tersomius cf. texensis was reported from the early Permian South Grandfield locality in Oklahoma by Daly (1973). A second species of Tersomius, T. mosesi, was named by Olson (1970) for Amos Moses, the property owner of the land in Oklahoma where the material was collected from. There are several dozen reported specimens for T. mosesi, but almost all of them are in poor condition and the osteology of this species remains poorly understood. Olson differentiated it from T. texensis mostly on the basis of notably fewer marginal teeth in the jaw. A third species of Tersomius, T. dolesensis, was named by Anderson & Bolt (2013) from the Richards Spur locality in Oklahoma. It is differentiated from all other amphibamiforms by the presence of enlarged teeth along the palatine ramus of the vomer and is distinguished from T. texensis by a posteriorly restricted postorbital and a posteriorly extensive jugal.  Anatomy  The most recent revision of the genus is that of Schoch & Milner (2014), who list a combination of seven features and two plesiomorphies: (1) nearly circular outline of skull with curved maxilla; (2) prefrontal and postfrontal separated; (3) preorbital region equal to skull table in length; (4) internarial fenestra present; (5) teeth variably monocuspid and bicuspid; (6) vomer with both medial and lateral fangs; (7) palatine lacking denticles; (8) long supratemporal; (9) postparietal longer than tabular. Most of these features are not unique to Tersomius (the combination being unique), as evidenced by the diagnosis of Anderson & Bolt (2013), who list an elongate tabular and a medial curvature of the maxillary arcade at the position of the quadrate (shared with Doleserpeton, T. texensis, and Micropholis) as diagnostic. The poor understanding of T. mosesi often leads it to be excluded in discussion or diagnosing of the genus.  Relationships  Like other amphibamiforms that were described early in the 20th century, Tersomius has sometimes been listed as a dissorophid, but this was often the result of a lack of distinction between amphibamiforms and dissorophids for much of the 20th century. Its position within Amphibamiformes (the traditional Amphibamidae) is well-supported by modern computer-assisted phylogenetic analyses. Tersomius texensis is usually utilized as the representative of the genus in most analyses in which it is recovered as being closely related to Micropholis and Pasawioops, forming the Micropholidae. Below is a phylogeny of dissorophoids from Schoch (2018): The placement of Tersomius dolesensis within Tersomius remains somewhat disputed because it is not recovered as the sister taxon of T. texensis in recent analyses by Anderson & Bolt (2013; the original description) and Maddin et al. (2013). In the former, T. texensis was excluded from the analysis, and T. dolesensis was recovered as the sister taxon to Plemmyradytes. In the latter, both species of Tersomius were included and were not resolved as sister taxa. Below is the result of the analysis of Maddin et al.

It is one of the oldest and possibly one of the most basal (\\"primitive\\") known lepospondyls. The genus is monotypic, including only the type species Utaherpeton franklini. Utaherpeton was named in 1991 from the Manning Canyon Shale Formation, which dates to the Mississippian-Pennsylvanian boundary. It was originally classified within Microsauria, a group of superficially lizard- and salamander-like lepospondyls that is now no longer considered to be a valid clade or evolutionary grouping, but rather an evolutionary grade consisting of the most basal lepospondyls. Utaherpeton has been proposed as both the most basal lepospondyl and the oldest \\"microsaur\\", although more derived lepospondyls are known from earlier in the Carboniferous. However, its position within Lepospondyli remains uncertain due to the incomplete preservation of the only known specimen. The inclusion of Utaherpeton in various phylogenetic analyses has resulted in multiple phylogenies (hypotheses of evolutionary relationships) that are very different from one another, making it a significant taxon in terms of understanding the interrelationships of lepospondyls. Description Like many other lepospondyls, Utaherpeton is salamander-like in appearance. It has an elongated body made up of 26 presacral (neck and back) vertebrae. The total body length excluding the tail is about . The forelimbs are markedly smaller than the hind limbs and the hind feet are unusual in that they are larger than the rest of the hind limbs. A unique anatomical feature that distinguishes Utaherpeton from other \\"microsaur\\" lepospondyls is a connection between the prefrontal and premaxilla bones at the front of the skull. Classification When Utaherpeton was first described in 1991, it was tentatively classified within a group of \\"microsaurs\\" called Microbrachomorpha, which included the better-known Microbrachis. A 2001 phylogenetic analysis found Utaherpeton to be the most basal lepospondyl, followed by the \\"microsaur\\" Hyloplesion, which has also been considered a microbrachomorph. However, Microbrachomorpha was not recognized as a true clade because Microbrachis was found to be more deeply nested within Lepospondyli, more closely related to derived lepospondyls like nectrideans and a√Østopods than to other \\"microsaurs\\". A 2004 analysis including Utaherpeton produced a very different phylogeny for lepospondyls, placing a√Østopods and nectrideans as the most basal lepospondyls, followed by a paraphyletic assemblage of \\"microsaurs\\". Utaherpeton was still recovered as one of the most basal \\"microsaurs\\", but not as the most basal lepospondyl. Tentative support for a close relationship between Utaherpeton and Microbrachis was also found. In a 2010 analysis, all \\"microsaurs\\" except Utaherpeton were recovered within a monophyletic group, but Utaherpeton was found to be the most basal member of a separate clade that included all other lepospondyls.

Through the department, Germans controlled the content of Norwegian newspapers. Both the Norwegian fascist party Nasjonal Samling and the Norwegian Ministry of Culture and Enlightenment wanted to control newspapers, but the German occupants used the press department to get the final power of decision. The department consisted of bureaus for general press policy, daily newspapers, illustrated press, culture and economy journalism, news and information. The work was based on political control of the press, meaning direct interference, closing, firing of editors and journalists, and even arrests. Oslo papers that were being published got the messages of what to print through the daily press conferences, other papers got classified daily orders by telephone or teleprinter, the latter an innovation brought to Norwegian newspapers by the Germans. Orders went into detail about how the occupant power wanted each piece of news handled, as well as what events were not to be covered at all. NS papers were also established. The largest and best known was Fritt Folk (\\"Free People\\"), which took over the offices of Arbeiderbladet after this Oslo paper was closed down in August 1940. Several papers that refused to follow guidelines were shut down for longer or shorter periods. Some were made subject to prior restraint rather than the normal censorship after the fact. However, perhaps the most effective sanction was paper rationing. The department managed to reduce the number of publications, which made its censorship work easier.

Fossils have been found from the Early Permian San Angelo Formation in Texas. The type and only species, S. texensis, was named in 1962. It may be closely related to the dvinosaur Kourerpeton. Slaugenhopia was once classified as a trimerorhachid but is now classified as a tupilakosaurid. Description and history Slaugenhopia was found from the San Angelo Formation within the Kahn Quarry of Driver Ranch in Knox County, Texas. Although it was known only from fragments, paleontologist Everett C. Olson reconstructed the entire skull when he named the genus in 1962. He placed the genus in the dvinosaur family Trimerorhachidae and thought that it was intermediate between the dvinosaurs Trimerorhachis and Dvinosaurus based on the shape of the skull. A mandible that was found earlier in Little Croton Creek was also referred to Slaugenhopia. Slaugenhopia continued to be classified as a trimerorhachid until 1999 when a new dvinosaur called Thabanchuia was named from South Africa. Thabanchuia is a member of the family Tupilakosauridae and shares many similarities with Slaugenhopia. Because of these similarities, Slaugenhopia is now considered a tupilakosaurid. Defining characteristics of Slaugenhopia include a notch in the pterygoid bone of the palate called the pterygoid incisure; the wideness of a projection of bone in the palate called the cultriform process, a wide contact between the parasphenoid and basisphenoid bones on the underside of the skull, and uniquely \\"L\\"-shaped postparietal bones at the back of the skull. Another Early Permian dvinosaur called Kourerpeton is also known from Texas and may be related to Slaugenhopia. Both dvinosaurs have an enlarged postorbital bone and a small postfrontal bone near the eye sockets. They also have similar vertebrae, with ring-like intercentra and small, crescent-shaped pleurocentra. While the posterior margin of the skull is relatively straight in Slaugenhopia, the same margin is curved and irregular in Kourerpeton. Kourerpeton also lacks the pterygoid incisure of Slaugenhopia, which is characteristic of other tupilakosaurids as well. Based on these differences, Kourerpeton is probably a basal relative of tupilakosaurids, including Slaugenhopia.

History  Scincosaurus crassus was first described by Bohemian paleontologist Anton√≠n Friƒç in volume 1875 of \\"Sitzungsberichte der k√∂niglichen B√∂hmischen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften in Prague\\", which at that time was the premiere scientific journal of Bohemia (the modern day Czech Republic). Friƒç's contribution to this volume was a list of Carboniferous animals he and his associates recently discovered at coal gas mines near the localities of N√Ω≈ôany and Kounov√°. His list included short preliminary descriptions for many new genera and species of tetrapods, including Microbrachis, Branchiosaurus, Hyloplesion (at that time called Stelliosaurus), and Sparodus. Scincosaurus crassus was among the new tetrapods from N√Ω≈ôany, and its short description (erroneously) considered it a robust lacertilian (lizard), possibly related to Sparodus. A much larger description was published in 1881 as part of one of Friƒç's personal monographs which focused entirely on the paleontology of Bohemia. Within this monograph, Friƒç identified Scincosaurus crassus as a nectridean and provided a comprehensive overview of the taxa's anatomy. He noticed a pair of prong-like bones near the back of the skull of one specimen, which he was convinced were examples of tabular horns. These horns, which form from the tabular bones at the rear of the skull, are characteristic of diplocaulids, and as a result Friƒç renamed Scincosaurus crassus to Keraterpeton crassum, a new species of the basal diplocaulid Keraterpeton. Outdated interpretation as a species of Keraterpeton, showing spikes at the back of the head. In 1895, the idea that Scincosaurus crassus was simply a species of Keraterpeton was reevaluated and subsequently refuted. While studying a specimen of Keraterpeton galvani (the type species of Keraterpeton), British paleontologist C.W. Andrews noticed that there were many differences between skulls of that species and Keraterpeton crassum (a.k.a. Scincosaurus crassus). K. galvani had fairly large eyes positioned close to each other on the skull, while K. crassum had small and widely separated eyes. The skull of K. crassum was more heavily sculptured by pits and grooves and did not possess a significant overhang of the braincase, in contrast to K. galvani. The purported tabular horns were seemingly separated from the rest of the skull by means of a ball-and-socket joint, while no such delineation existed for K. galvani, whose horns were simply rear branches of the tabular bones. As a result, he resurrected the genus Scincosaurus for \\"Keraterpeton\\" crassum, although he retained the misspelled specific name, \\"crassum\\". Subsequent authors would correct this error by referring to the species as Scincosaurus crassus as Friƒç originally did in 1876. In 1903, German paleontologist Otto Jaekel noted that he could not find any evidence of the supposed jointed tabular horns on any Scincosaurus specimens. He supposed that Friƒç may have erroneously mistaken bones of the shoulder girdle (such as a scapula, or shoulder blade) for the horns. In 1909, Jaekel placed Scincosaurus within its own family, Scincosauridae. However, he did not consider scincosaurs to be part of Nectridea, which to him was restricted to the horned diplocaulids. Instead, scincosaurids were allied with the long-tailed urocordylids and snake-like ophiderpetontids in an order he called Urosauri. Urosaurs, nectrideans, and several other groups of early tetrapods were all considered to belong to the class Microsauria. Microsauria was kept separate from traditional linnean classes such as Reptilia, Mammalia, and Amphibia, due to paleontologists of the time being generally uncertain whether they were reptile-like amphibians or amphibian-like reptiles. Following Jaekel's hypothesis, Robert Broom used Scincosaurus as a representative of microsaurs during his 1921 study on tetrapod ankle bones. As the 20th century proceeded, Scincosaurus fell into obscurity. However, by the 1960s sources which did discuss it once again considering it a member of Nectridea outside of Microsauria. During his 1963 monograph on the advanced diplocaulid Diploceraspis, J.R. Beerbower placed Scincosaurus as a basal diplocaulid closely related to Batrachiderpeton in a subfamily he called Batrachiderpetoninae. Even so, Scincosaurus was still distantly related to microsaurs, as a growing body of evidence suggested that microsaurs were not reptiles, but relatives of the nectrideans within a subgroup of amphibians called Lepospondyli. In 1982, a second species of Scincosaurus was named by C. Civet: Scincosaurus spinosus. This species, which was found in Carboniferous deposits near Montceau-les-Mines in France, is well-preserved yet poorly described. During their description of the urocordylid Montcellia in 1994, Jean-Michel Dutuit and D. Heyler considered that S. spinosus may not belong to Scincosaurus, but rather its French close relative Sauravus. Phylogenetic studies on nectrideans conducted by Andrew Milner, Angela Milner, and Marcello Ruta have consistently found Scincosaurus to be a member of the order since 1978. One of these studies, Milner & Ruta (2009), included a large redescription and reinterpretation of Scincosaurus crassus.

The genus name comes from the Greek stegos ('roof') and tretos ('perforated') to refer to a large fenestra found on the palatine bone. The species name, S. agyrus, is said to be derived from Greek agyrus ('gathering' / 'crowd') in reference to the concentration of all known specimens in a small area. The proper word in ancient Greek for 'gathering' / 'crowd' is however agora (·ºÄŒ≥ŒøœÅŒ¨), with the variant agyris (·ºÑŒ≥œÖœÅŒπœÇ) in the Aeolic dialect.Liddell, H.G. & Scott, R. (1940).

A large number of partial to complete skulls and associated postcrania are known for this taxon.  Anatomy  Despite the large number of specimens of Stegotretus, many are poorly preserved or distorted. Stegotretus is diagnosed by the presence of only two premaxillary teeth and by a large circular fenestra on the palatine. A contact between the maxilla and the quadratojugal and the absence of an entepicondylar foramen on the humerus separate it from the purportedly closely related Pantylus.

The etymology of its name most likely came from its long narrow skull when compared to other temnospondyls. Stanocephalosaurus lived an aquatic lifestyle, occpying rivers, lakes, swamps, and shores, with some species even living in salt lakes. There are currently three recognized species and another that needs further material to establish its legitimacy. The three known species are Stanocephalosaurus pronus from the Middle Triassic in Tanzania, Stanocephalosaurus amenasensis from the Lower Triassic in Algeria, and Stanocephalosaurus birdi, from the middle Triassic in Arizona. Stanocephalosaurus rajareddyi from the Middle Triassic in central India needs further evidence in order to establish its relationship among other Stanocephalosaurs. Like other temnospondyls, Stanocephalosaurus was an aquatic carnivore. Evidence of multiple species discovered in a wide range of localities proves that Stanocephalosaurus were present all across Pangea throughout the early to mid Triassic.  History of Discovery  The earliest known discovery of the genus was on November 9, 1932 by R.T. Bird while on a motorcycle trip, where he found a partial skull \\"six and six-tenths miles southwest of Winslow, Arizona, near the road to Pine and Payson along the edge of a small mesa with other fossil remains.\\" There was no bone present, but the natural impression of the skull was later brought to Barnum Brown, an American paleontologist, at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, who named the new genus and species Stanocephalosaurus birdi (Presumably honoring Bird‚Äôs name). The narrow skull and slender parasphenoid, internal nairs, as well as interpalatal vacuities were key characteristics in identifying this fossil as a new genus. Barnum did not want to designate a family without a more complete skull or a more defined impression. Other species of Stanocephalosaurus have been discovered since, in a variety of regions such as India, Tanzania, and Algeria.  Species  There are currently three known species of Stanocephalosaurus. The species S. rajareddyi is assumed to belong to this genus, but the subject is still controversial. S. birdi: The earliest discovered species of Stanocephalosaurus, found in the middle Triassic just outside of Winslow, Arizona. Like other Stanocephalosaurus, it has a narrow head, but a more obtuse snout than the S. amenasensis. Characterized by narrow posterior nares, and an increased expansion of the pterygoids and palatines. S. amenasensis: The newest species discovered. From the Triassic of the Algerian Sahara. Diagnostic characters include subtriangular external nostrils with lateral borders, small orbits, posteriorly wide postfrontals, elongate parietals, concave posterior margin of the skull table, ovoid anterior palatal vacuities, posteriorly pointed choanae, and oval interpterygoid fetestrae. Discovery of the species in a gypsum layer suggests that it was euryhaline. S. pronus: Known exclusively from the B9 locality west of Mkongoleko, an Anisian fluvial- lacustrine mudstone/sandstone in the Manda Beds Formation of Tanzania. It was named by A.A. Howie in 1970. S. rajareddyi: Currently unconfirmed species. Discovered in the P-G Basin of central India. Originally Parotosuchus rajareddyi, its vertebrate fauna and constriction of its otic notch considered it to be a member of the Mastodonsauridae, with a new combination known as S. rajareddyi. Tabular and postparietal are posteriorly extended, and the postorbital is relatively smaller than the postparietal. However, because most fossils found belonging to this species are scattered fragments, better material is needed before confidently classifying S. rajareddyi as a new species.  Description   Skull  The skull of the Stanocephalosaurus has key features characteristic to the temnospondyl order, with the most apparent being its flattened shape. The dorsal as well as ventral surfaces of the Stanocephalosaurus skull have well ornamented honeycombed patterns throughout. Palatal views of skulls in this genus show narrow interpalatal vacuities due to their thin skulls, as well as paired palatal tusks alternately functioning on the vomer and palatine, with the vomerine tusks directed backwards. Stanocephalosaurus shows an increased expansion of the pterygoids and palatines, as well as narrow posterior nares. The vomer also bears two vomerine rows: a transversal denticle row and a longitudinal denticle row that runs along the inner margin of the choana. The palatines and ectopterygoids are broader than other temnospondyls, barring other capitosaurids. Stanocephalosaurus has a long, triangular skull, which is much longer than broad, with an elongated preorbital region continuously narrowing anteriorly to an obtuse rounded snout, though this varies in species (S. amenasensis tend to have much narrower snouts than S. birdi). The Stanocephalosaurus have at least 100 straight and conical teeth on the premaxilla and maxilla combined, gradually increasing in size towards the front. Other skull regions previously inaccessible or too poorly preserved on the Stanocephalosaurus have been observed with X-ray micro-CT scans, including the otic capsule, delta groove of the exoccipital, as well as parts of the arterial and nervous system. Air pockets around the stapes of Stanocephalosaurus have been hypothesized to act as resonance chambers, meaning that the spoon-shaped inner ear bone could be related to underwater hearing. This trait is possibly associated with early tetrapod evolution, and can act as a link to Anuran tympanum evolution. Due to the cranial morphology of the Stanocephalosaurus' narrow head with an elongated preorbital region compared to other temnospondyls, stress levels during biting are slightly higher than those with a wider and shorter skull.  Vertebrae  The vertebrae of the Stanocephalosaurus are rhachitomous, with a neural arch and a bipartite centrum that is divided into a large, unpaired wedge-shaped intercentrum and smaller paired pleurocentra. In anterior and posterior views, the intercentrum is a dorsally half-ring, surrounding the persistent notochord from ventral and lateral sides. Lateral and ventral surfaces of the intercentrum are smooth, suggesting a continuation of cartilage due to the unfinished medial surface. The posterodorsal margin of the intercentrum also shows a parapophysis for articulation with the capitulum of the ribs.  Paleobiology  The lifestyle of the Stanocephalosaurus has been long contended. Historically, they have been classified as either bottom dwellers, ambushers, or active predators. Histological observations of Lines of Arrested Growth (LAGs) in the bone structure of capitosaurids suggested that they lived in semi-arid environments with strong seasonal rains, forcing them to adapt to both aquatic as well as terrestrial environments. However, the discovery of S. amenasensis proves that Stanocephalosaurs lived an aquatic lifestyle due to the present dermo-sensory canals.  Diet and feeding  Not much is known about the Stanocephalosaurus diet other than that it was a carnivore like other temnospondyls. Due to evidence suggesting that they were better adapted toward life in water, it can be assumed that their diets have shifted towards eating aquatic organisms as well. Because Stanocephalosaurus had such large flat skulls, characteristic to many large temnospondyls, they most likely lifted their entire skulls in order to open their mouths rather than lowering their jaws. Due to being largely aquatic, Stanocephalosaurs might have lain in wait for prey below the surface of the water, and lifted its massive head to open its mouth wide to suck the food inside, much like modern crocodiles. Stanocephalosaurus most likely used large muscles in the neck attached to their large pectoral girdles. The small teeth present across the genus in addition to the large surface area for neck muscle attachment could suggest suction feeding through opening their mouths quickly. It is also proposed that during the dry season, when the sebkhas these species inhabit become ponds, the adults may eat larval and juvenile individuals in the pond, indicated by the lack of juvenile specimens within the gypsum layers, where bones are very well preserved.  Aquatic Adaptations  Though there is little certainty in how Stanocephalosaurus breathed, paleontologists suggest that it had air pockets around the stapes, which have been hypothesized to act as resonance chambers, meaning that the inner ear bone could be related to underwater hearing. This trait is possibly associated with early tetrapod evolution. S. amenasensis show a circumorbital canal that runs along the prefrontal, postorbital and jugal, and a supraanarial canal that runs along the nasal and anterior half of the prefrontal. These dermo-sensory grooves suggest an aquatic lifestyle.  Paleoenvironment  Through the discovery of several distinct species throughout the continents, it can be noted that Stanocephalosaurus were relatively widespread throughout Pangea during the Triassic. The discovery of S. amenasensis in a gypsum layer, which corresponds to the infilling of a salt lake, suggests that there was an evolution of an alluvial plain under a strong seasonal climate. These species also occupied sebkhas during these seasonal shifts, seemingly staying there even as the sebkhas drained into ponds. Not only that, the S. amenasensis, like many other temnospondyls, was euryhaline, due inhabiting various salt water bodies. The gypsum crust many of these fossils were discovered under acted as a powerful preservation tool, protecting the bones from atmospheric degradation. Such a high level of gypsum suggests a relatively extreme hypersaline paleoenvironment.

Purpose in the history of education The irony of purpose-guided education, which Pattengale notes, is that it's actually reclaiming the foundational tenets of education. Socrates' mantra was that \\"The unexamined life is not worth living.\\" This examination, as outlined in The Purpose-Guided Student, needs to occur against the backdrop of questions about the human condition, similar to those raised in the classics, and in recent thoughtful works dealing with the same. This need for a knowledge base in the purpose-guided model, making the best decisions based on the best available information, in endorsed in many corners of higher education. For example, Robert Maynard Hutchins, closely associated with the Great Books movement, was leery of any social or institutional commitments fueled by zeal without knowledge, and the latter came most notably through a study of the great thinkers through the ages‚Äîthe \\"great conversation.\\" In 1970, he cautioned educators: > It is the absence of anything relevant in the current program of the > multiversity that has produced this demand for relevance on the part of the > young.

During the Middle Ages the trivium and quadrivium provided the curricular knowledge base to study Theology, \\"the Queen of the sciences.\\" Students were preparing to understand more fully their place in this world, and doing so through a deeper understanding of a higher (supernatural) power. In today's universities, as UCLA's H.E.R.I. reports on spirituality outline, the majority of students in the first decade of the 21st century place top importance on spirituality, though the shift has changed considerably from the Judeo- Christian version to a more general spirituality. Nonetheless, there is a heightened interest (like the Middle Ages) in understanding one's place in this world. Numerous studies are trying to find the place once again in education for these metaphysical questions in the curriculum, and while there is a common theme among these \\"Why\\" questions, there is a wide range of suggested solutions. Some recent studies want merely to raise the questions, like Anthony Kronman's Education's End: Why Our Colleges and Universities Have Given Up on the Meaning of Life.Kronman, A. T.

While this basic question resonates with purpose-guided education, Kronman's solutions differ drastically in not providing a format for students to find, articulate and pursue their life purpose after the questions are raised. Recent scholarly works more aligned with purpose-guided education are Christian Smith's Soul Searching: The Religious and Spiritual Lives of America's TeenagersSmith, C. A. (2005) Soul Searching: The Religious and Spiritual Lives of America's Teenagers. Oxford Press. and The Schooled Heart: Moral Formation in American Higher Education by Douglas Henry and Michael Beaty.Henry, D. & M. Beaty (2008) The Schooled Heart: Moral Formation in American Higher Education. Waco, TX: Baylor University Press. At Indiana Wesleyan University During the 1980s, considerable focus in education was placed on a student's vocation (instead of career) and aligning life goals with curricular choices instead of following traditional majors without understanding one's passions. Many schools, like Indiana Wesleyan University, began to focus on \\"whole-person development,\\" and became ripe for the research and development of a coherent educational philosophy based on the notion of purpose. The Lilly Endowment, Inc. funded a major Program for the Theological Exploration of Vocation initiative for universities to assist with helping students to understand better their life calling, or vocation.http://www.ptev.org/indexer.aspx?sect=about&tid;=-11&iid;=14 Indiana Wesleyan University was one of the recipients of these grants, and the $5 million grant helped with the intense research and development underpinning purpose-guided education, and especially with the founding of the Center for Life Calling and Leadership, a general education curriculum with \\"Becoming Worldchangers\\" as its main course, a humanities-based first-year seminar. The entire education experience at Indiana Wesleyan is based on \\"World Changing Outcomes\\", involves learning experiences involving both faculty and student development, and includes a Dean of Mentoring and a Mentor Residence Hall.Pattengale, J., D. Sprowl, R. Thompson and K. Parker (2008, January 1) The Purpose-Guided Campus‚ÄîHomework to Mentor Hall. Recruitment and Retention. Magna Publications. A longevity study of 1700 students conducted in conjunction with Indiana University's Research Center validated the value of the purpose-guided curriculum, with positive odds ratios for every cohort studied, and some as high as 12% more likely to succeed than those not in the purpose-guided track.Reynolds, P., J. Gross, B. Millard, J. Pattengale (2005). Discovering life purpose: retention success in a leadership course at Indiana Wesleyan University. Indiana Project for Academic Success Research Brief. Bloomington: Smith Center for Research, Indiana University. Today, all IWU students go through some key aspect of the purpose-guided programs. Four key purpose-guided initiatives converged to aid student success efforts, and simultaneously to garner selection among the twelve \\"founding\\" (original) institutions in the Foundations of Excellence project.Policy Center on the First Year of College, John Gardner, Director, Betsy Barefoot, Co-Director, located at Brevard College in Brevard, North Carolina. 28712. Phone: 828.966.5312, FAX: 828.883.4093, Web: http://www.brevard.edu/fyc . These included the mentoring program, the first-year seminar, the Center for Life Calling and Leadership, and most recently, the Mentoring Hall. A dean and associate dean of mentoring were added in 1999 and 2001. The first-year seminar is required of all new students, included transfers. The Center for Life Calling and Leadership, with the aid of the Lilly Endowment, has become a true local, community, and national center. It provides a variety of services, including a curriculum and advising for all pre-declared students.

Almost every surf spot has a rocky bottom with powerful waves, the winter months are particularly consistent. Madeira did not really come to the attention of foreign surfers until articles in surfing magazines in the mid-1990s. Since 1996, top Portuguese surfers from the mainland compete in the Madeira regional edition of the \\"Billabong Challenge\\".The Encyclopaedia of Surfing In 2001, the World Big Wave Championships were held in Madeira. One memorable session in the history of Madeira surfing occurred on 25 January 1995 at Jardim Do Mar. Portuguese big wave legend Jos√© Seabra and the Californian artist/rapper/surfer Ithaka rode absolutely flawless waves up to eight meters on the face by themselves, with no other surfers in the water. Photographs of the session by Jo√£o Valente have appeared in publications around the world including the cover of Surf Portugal Magazine. The conditions which were some of the cleanest and glassiest ever recorded at the classic big wave point break inspired Ithaka to write the song \\"Seabra Is Mad\\" about Seabra's performance on that day. The song was released on Ithaka's 2nd album Stellafly (1997) and was later awarded both \\"Song Of The Year\\" and \\"Video Of The Year\\" by the national newspaper P√∫blico,[://www.discogs.com/Ithaka- Stellafly/release/1103158] as well a being nominated for \\"Song Of The Year\\" at that year's annual Premios Blitz (the Portuguese equivalent of The Grammy Awards). Ithaka also wrote two other songs inspired by surfing in Madeira, \\"Eden By The Sea\\" (also from the album Stellafly) and \\"Been Four Years\\" (album Flowers And The Color Of Paint). In 2012, Paul Mandaca, a Brazilian blues rock performer used a version of \\"Eden By The Sea\\" as the title track of his debut album. Madeira's surfspots Paul do Mar beach, Madeira * Paul do Mar: this surf spot according to surf experts has the best barrelling waves (also known as tubular or tunnel waves) on the island. Both stand-up surfing and bodyboarding are practised at this spot. The ISA World Surf championships have been hosted on the islands which are better known to be held in areas such as Hawaii. Paul do Mar region of the island is respected throughout the surf community as it offers waves and fantastic tubular tunnels. The World Big Wave Championships 2001 was held at Paul do Mar.World Big Wave Championships * Ponta Pequena: another perfect right-hander. Punta Pequena is situated between Jardim do Mar and Paul do Mar * Lugar de Baixo: really hollow and fast. * S√£o Vicente: on the north coast is a calmer spot suitable for beginners and intermediate surfers. Here a surf school is based. * Jardim do Mar: the right- hander. Surfing at Jardim is only for the experienced as the waves break large. They start at around two metres and reeling right-handers can reach five metres sweeping along the rocky point. Jardim do Mar was documented in Jacob Holcomb's film Lost Jewel of the Atlantic. The film featured a song entitled Who's The Enemy?, by surfer-rappers Ithaka and Gabriel o Pensador. https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10354558/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfDhD_dZ_UY The beaches off Funchal, Madeira's capital, sometimes have fun left-handers.

It is known from a single partial skull from the Hawkesbury Sandstone formation in Australia. Discovery and naming The remains of the type specimen Subcyclotosaurus brookvalensis were discovered in the Hawkesbury Sandstone formation, Australia, which is in an Anisian lacustrine shale deposit. The genus and specific name was assigned by Watson in 1958. Description Skeletal reconstruction of related genus Paracyclotosaurus davidi The type specimen (AM F47499) is a partial skull roof, with fragments lost on the right side. The dorsal surface of the skull resembles a small Cyclotosaur skull from the Brookvale clays of the Hawkesbury Sandstone.50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons License. The specimen is from the mould of a skull broken so that the right border is lost, and is very slightly distorted by pressure so that the orbits are no longer symmetrical. The proportions of the skull resemble those of most others of Cyclotosaurus, the preorbital length being 66% of the total mid-line length. The extremes amongst Cyclotosaurus being 61% in the small Cyclotosaurus ebrachensis, and 71% in Parotosuchus helgolandicus. The skull is characterized by the small tabular without any trace of a \\"horn\\", but with a round lappet that approaches the squamosal flange lateral to the tympanic membrane, failing to meet it by about its own width. The occiput between the otic notches is proportionately wide, a reflection of the small size of the skull. The skull is otherwise of normal Parotosuchus structure, but has a small internasal vacuity between the dorsal processes of the premaxillae. Lateral lines are often shown as continuous grooves with well- defined borders. A deep groove on the maxilla begins immediately behind and lateral to the nostril and passes straight back to the lachrymal, on which bone it turns outward and forward and ends abruptly. Another groove appears to begin on the maxilla, immediately lateral to that described above. It passes back just above the insertion of the teeth for the full length of the bone. The supraorbital groove begins abruptly on the dorsal surface of the premaxilla, immediately passes on to the nasal, and extends back on that bone close to its suture with the lachrymal. It then comes on to the prefrontal, passing on to the frontal where that bone enters the orbital border. Then as a well-defined groove it surrounds the hinder part of the orbit, turns vertically on to the jugal, and then backward to cross the point where jugal, quadratojugal and squamosal meet, continuing over the squamosal to pass back on to the body. There is a canal crossing the supratemporal.

It contains elements of fantasy but also science-fiction, however it also unifies them with elements of classic Cyberpunk and overtones of Enlightenment Thought.  Plot  The story is set on a tide locked planet. The sun-facing side is inhabited by the Strefis, the illuminated ones, while the dark side is populated by the Ugeltz, the people of night. No Ugeltz has ever seen a Strefis however each civilisation remembers the other, in legends. Ugk, the sovereign of the dark realm, has summoned his two sons Rabokk and Torg to send them on a quest that solves the energy problem of the dark side. The dark society depends on a substance called Margin, that is the only energy source and also the main currency of the realm. This substance is running out, because it can't be harvested any longer. Ugk hopes to find a solution for this problem by looking for the legendary realm of light, which could be a new energy source. He offers his position to the son who will succeed in finding the Realm of Light.  History  A Second Face was scripted in Adventure Game Studio, with puzzles invented during the scripting process. Le Woltaire improvised much of this, starting with some backgrounds and characters until he got ideas for the plot and puzzles. Then the main cut-scenes were written to model the basic plot structure, and then the game was developed non- linearly. \\"Drawing, CAD-modelling, dramaturgy and scripting were mixed together which was a good way for me to make things grow together.\\" Character design began with a charcoal sketch, then coloured with watercolours. These were scanned and reduced in size to make the characters more detailed. Locations were also sketched, then used as a background reference for 3D-CAD models. These were then digitally edited to match the tone and style of the characters. Characters and locations were hand animated with photo editing software, and limited to six frames to make a compromise between economy and fluid motion. Le Woltaire was influenced by a city map of ancient Babylonia for the design for City of Ugeltz.  Gameplay  The plot develops with cinematic cutscenes and gameplay, controlled with a verb coin interface and an inventory-based action system that follows the tradition of classic point and click games.Cutscene mix at YouTube A characteristic text box makes open dialogues with other game figures possible when a single word is entered. Awards A Second Face received 15 nominations for the 2008 AGS Awards.

Heistadmoen currently provides able quarters for the Telemark and Buskerud Home Guard District (Telemark og Buskerud Heimevernsdistrikt). The camp is large and modern, most of the buildings have been recently refurbished. The camp is also used by other departments for training and shooting. History There were scattered activity on site dating from 1909 when the Telemark Infantry Regiment was based there. The earliest buildings were relocated from the Gr√•tenmoen area in Skien. The principal function was to provide better protection for the Kongsberg Weapons Factory. During World War II, Telemark Infantry Regiment capitulated to the invading German Army without a fight on 13 April 1940 due to the threat of German bombing. A number of officers and crew took arms and continued the defense in Telemark. During the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany, the German Military built up most of the camp with labor provided by Soviet prisoners of war. After the war ended in 1945, the camp housed German prisoners of war, guarded by U.S. and British soldiers. From 1946 to 1952 continued training of infantry battalions of the Tysklandsbrigaden, the Norwegian army's contribution to the Allied occupation force in Germany. In 1994, the new Battalion Telemark created Heistadmoen. The Battalion was moved to Camp Rena during August 2001. It was next occupied by His Majesty the King's Guard 6 Company, which later was also moved to Camp Rena.The Independent Norwegian Brigade Group in Germany (Tysklandsbrigaden) Telemark Regiment was laid down on 1 January 2003, and Heistadmoen camp was transferred to the Telemark and Buskerud Home Guard District The facilities are presently available for the use of all districts surrounding the Oslo Fjord. The Telemark Battalion, Krigsskolen Military Academy, National Guard and local police are the principal users.

It was formed from the organized resistance groups of Cham Albanians on 15 June 1943 and was renamed as the IV Chameria Group () in October 1943, which ceased to exist after the Liberation of Albania. It included at the time of its creation more than 500 armed troops, the vast majority of whom were Albanians from the Greek part of Chameria region and the rest from the Albanian part, and about 40 members of the Greek minority in Albania.Anamali, Sk√´nder and Prifti, Kristaq. Historia e popullit shqiptar n√´ kat√´r v√´llime. Botimet Toena, 2002, . Background On April 7, 1939, Italian troops invaded Albania. The operation was led by General Alfredo Guzzoni. Despite some stubborn resistance by some patriots, especially at Durr√´s, the Italians made short work of the Albanians.Albania: A Country Study: Italian Occupation, Library of Congress Durr√´s was captured on April 7, Tirana the following day, Shkod√´r and Gjirokast√´r on April 9, and almost the entire country by April 10. Unwilling to become an Italian puppet, King Zog, his wife, Queen Geraldine Apponyi, and their infant son Leka fled to Greece and eventually to London. On April 12, the Albanian parliament voted to depose Zog and unite the nation with Italy \\"in personal union\\" by offering the Albanian crown to Victor Emmanuel III.Fischer, B. J: Albania at War, 1939-1945, page 36. Hurst, 1999 Formation and renaming On 15 June 1943, members of unorganized resistance groups in Southern Albania and Northwestern Greece decided to create the Chameria battalion, during the meeting of the Regional Committee of the National Anti-fascist Liberation Army in Konispol. The decision was adopted on June 30, 1943, when three resistance groups were united. These groups included the Tahsini group based in Konispol, the Father Stathi Melani group based in Filiates, and the Alush Taka group based in Paramithia. Each group numbered about 170-180 members, from which only 75 were not Cham Albanians, of whom 35 were from Delvin√´ and 40 were members of the Greek minority in Albania. This battalion was the first big partisan organization in the Gjirokast√´r County (which at that time included Gjirokast√´r, Sarand√´ and Delvin√´ districts) and head as leader Haki Rushit Shehu from Konispol and as group leaders, Taho Mehmet Sejko from Filiates, Lefter Mi√ßo Talo from Ampelia (), Ali Demi from Filiates and as political commissar, Qazim Kondi from Polyneri (). On October 10, 1943, the battalion was renamed as IV Chameria Group , which had more than 2 thousand troops, about half of them were Cham Albanians, and the rest Albanians and Greeks from southern Albania. Contribution to the war Chameria battalion was one of the main contributors in resistance to Italian and German forces in southern Albania. Four major battles are recorded to this battalion. At the end of 1943, a group of Cham Albanians, led by Ali Demi, attacked a German garrison, in Vlora, Albania, killing 39 German troops and losing 12 members of the battalion, including Ali Demi himself. The second major operation was after September 8, 1943, when Italy capitulated, Chameria battalion entered Delvin√´ and disarmed the local regiment of the Italian Army, on September 12, 1943. The Italian source (G. Bonomi - Sacrificio italiano in terra albanese - La Prora; T. Scanagatta - Gli ultimi trenta giorini della divisione \\"Perugia\\" - Hoepli; and others) reports that on September 12, 1943 in Delvine there was only the 2nd battalion of 129 Infantry Regiment \\"Perugia\\". Not the whole regiment. And the battalion left Delvine, full armed, to \\"Argirocastro\\" called back from the Commander of the Division Gen. Chiminello. The same for the 3rd battalion in Giorgiokat. The third operation was in the region between Konispol and Sagiada, on the next day, when they tried to disarm the local regiment of the Italian army in Saranda. They were forced to back in Sagiada by the Italian army, but in a counter-offensive managed to seize the regiment, disarm them and take all army equipments of the regiment in Saranda. The same Italian source reports that In Saranda on September 13, 1943 there was no Regiment but 3.500 Italian soldier from many different corps. All of them left to Corf√π 09/13/1943. There was no fight with the Chameria Battalion. The fourth and final major operation occurred in the end October 1, 1943, when Chameria battalion managed to trap a squadre of German troops in the road between Filiates and Konispol and killed 12 Germans, taking their equipments. After being transformed into the IV Chameria Group, its members took part in operations of the VI, VII, VIII and XII brigades of the Albanian National Liberation Army not only in Albania, but also in Kosovo, Montenegro and current North Macedonia. Aftermath IV \\"Ali Demi\\" battalion In 1944, Greek People's Liberation Army asked Cham Albanians living in Greece to create a battalion and to enlist in its ranks. Having a good relation with the Albanian Army, ELAS's and NAFLA's officers managed to persuade Chams to create armed forces under the ELAS army.Kresti, Georgia. Verfolgung und Ged√§chtnis in Albanien: Eine Analyse postsozialistischer Erinnerungsstrategien, . In May 1944, a group of local Cham Albanians, under the lead of Chameria battalion soldiers created the battalion named after Ali Demi, in the village Milea (), which was included in the 15th regiment of Greek People's Liberation Army. At the time of its creation, it comprised 460 partisans, consisting of both Cham Albanians and Greeks. \\"Ali Demi\\" battalion was the second largest of ELAS in the area of Epirus. Being formed at the end of the war, the battalion had no considerable contribution in the liberation of Greece. More than 60 Chams were killed during a battle with German forces in Igoumenitsa. Other Cham Albanians were enlisted in VI, VII, IX and XI brigade of Greek People's Liberation Army, and fought in different mixed battalions of ELAS. After the war In an attempt to establish an ethnically pure border region, the Chams were evicted from northern Greece by guerrilla forces under the command of General Napoleon Zervas acting under the instructions of allied officers.Vickers, Miranda. The Cham Issue - Albanian National & Property Claims in Greece. Paper prepared for the British MoD, Defence Academy, 2002. Muslim Cham Albanians that fled in Albania, were organised as refugees by the communist-led Albanian government. They formed a congress in 1946, adopted a memorandum, accused Greece for their persecution, and asked the international community to react in order to return to their homeland and to acquire reparations. After their expulsion, these vets of ELAS, and the Cham Albanians from Greece, who took part in Chameria battalion formed in Albania the National Anti-Fascist Cham Committee, which was disbanded in 1947, when Cham Albanians lost their refugee status.

The Jason Foundation also aims to increase awareness of teen suicide. The organization was started in 1997, after the suicide of Jason Flatt, a 16-year-old from Nashville, Tennessee.  History  Jason's father, Clark Flatt, wrote a letter to anyone interested in learning about how to help combat youth suicide. In the letter, Clark explains that Jason was a normal 16-year-old boy who enjoyed being with his friends, playing sports and was a B-average student. On July 16, 1997, Jason killed himself. After Jason's death, his father began researching youth suicide, with the intention of finding effective methods of suicide prevention. The Jason Foundation was created to help stop teenage suicide and spread awareness about the issue. On 14 August 2017, new training modules were introduced to help those who interact with teenagers and young people to recognize what problems young people may have and how they could help teenagers.  \\"LIFE\\" System  The Jason Foundation has created a system to help prevent another person from taking their life. One part of this is the use of their \\"LIFE\\" model, which is an anagram for: ‚Ä¢ Listen to your friends when they need to talk about problems or thoughts of suicide ‚Ä¢ Insist that they be honest with you ‚Ä¢ Feelings‚Äîshare them with each other ‚Ä¢ Extend a helping hand and go with them to get a responsible adult involved to help This method's purpose was to approach an endangered teen in a non- threatening way about the teen's actions or thoughts. The Jason Foundation stresses that if someone knows about their friend thinking about suicide to never keep it to oneself, and to communicate the problem to a parent, a school guidance counselor, or a teacher about what was heard. Encouragement to Parents The Jason Foundation's belief is that there are effective ways for a parent to help a child not become another victim of youth suicide. They promote the idea of educating oneself about the problem and the signs of concern, and the tools that can be used for suicide prevention. They encourage parents to approach school systems to incorporate The Jason Foundation's ideals and methods. They also say that watching and listening to children is a large part in helping awareness of potential problems that may eventually lead to self-harm. They believe that parents who talk to their child and allow their child to express their feelings are better equipped to help with the development of healthy coping mechanisms, while also maintaining the fact that their child can always seek professional help.  Educational Programs  The Jason Foundation has created a school-based curriculum unit of study suitable for grades 7 through 12. It is set up to be used as a stand-alone program or as an objective within another topic like health and wellness. The students are given information about the problem of youth suicide and strategies to recognize and help a friend who may be at risk. The underlying lesson is that a responsible adult must be told of the concerns so that appropriate help can be found.  The Promise Program  At the end of their education about The Jason Foundation, the learner is presented with a card. This card is a promise, and on the card there is a small paragraph stating \\"I promise to be here for my friends. I will watch for any behavior that concerns me and I will TALK, LISTEN and RESPOND using the LIFE model. I won‚Äôt be silent.\\", followed by an entry for which a student then signs their name. The card also has the \\"LIFE\\" method on warning signs and how they can help. The warning signs are: * Depression * Abrupt changes in behavior * Mood swings * Crying spells * Recent grief or losses * Changes in school performance * Giving away treasured belongings * Suicidal threats * Hopelessness In general, the card's main purpose is to help and give short advice.

The requirements for an embedded hypervisor are distinct from hypervisors targeting server and desktop applications. An embedded hypervisor is designed into the embedded device from the outset, rather than loaded subsequent to device deployment. While desktop and enterprise environments use hypervisors to consolidate hardware and isolate computing environments from one another, in an embedded system, the various components typically function collectively to provide the device's functionality. Mobile virtualization overlaps with embedded system virtualization, and shares some use cases. Typical attributes of embedded virtualization include efficiency, security, communication, isolation and real-time capabilities. Virtualization for Embedded Systems  Background  Software virtualization has been a major topic in the enterprise space since the late 1960s, but only since the early 2000s has its use appeared in embedded systems. The use of virtualization and its implementation in the form of a hypervisor in embedded systems are very different from enterprise applications. An effective implementation of an embedded hypervisor must deal with a number of issues specific to such applications. These issues include the highly integrated nature of embedded systems, the requirement for isolated functional blocks within the system to communicate rapidly, the need for real-time/deterministic performance, the resource-constrained target environment and the wide range of security and reliability requirements.  Hypervisor  A hypervisor provides one or more software virtualization environments in which other software, including operating systems, can run with the appearance of full access to the underlying system hardware, where in fact such access is under the complete control of the hypervisor. These virtual environments are called virtual machines (VM)s, and a hypervisor will typically support multiple VMs managed simultaneously. = Classification = Hypervisors are generally classed as either type 1 or type 2, depending on whether the hypervisor runs exclusively in supervisor mode or privileged mode (type 1) or is itself hosted by an operating system as a regular application (type 2). Type 1 hypervisors manage key system resources required to maintain control over the virtual machines, and facilitate a minimal trusted computing base (TCB). Type 2 hypervisors typically run as an application within a more general purpose operating system, relying on services of the OS to manage system resources. Nowadays kernel extensions are often loaded to take advantage of hardware with virtualization support.  Embedded hypervisor  An embedded hypervisor is most often a type 1 hypervisor which supports the requirements of embedded systems development. See references Role of Virtualization in Embedded Systems and Virtualization and hypervisors aid embedded design for a more detailed discussion. These requirements are summarized below. * A small, fast hypervisor with support for multiple isolated VMs; * Support for lightweight but secure encapsulation of medium-grain subsystem components that interact strongly; * High-bandwidth, low-latency communication between system components, subject to a configurable, system-wide security policy; * Minimal impact on system resources and support real-time latency guarantees; * Ability to implement a scheduling policy between VMs and provide support for real-time system components;  Implementation  An embedded hypervisor typically provides multiple VMs, each of which emulates a hardware platform on which the virtualised software executes. The VM may emulate the underlying native hardware, in which case embedded code that runs on the real machine will run on the virtual machine and vice versa. An emulation of the native hardware is not always possible or desired, and a virtual platform may be defined instead. When a VM provides a virtual platform, guest software has to be ported to run in this environment, however since a virtual platform can be defined without reliance on the native hardware, guest software supporting a virtual platform can be run unmodified across various distinct hardware platforms supported by the hypervisor. Embedded hypervisors employ either paravirtualization or use virtualization features of the underlying CPU. Paravirtualization is required in cases where the hardware does not assist, and involves often extensive modifications to core architecture support core of guest kernels. Emulation of hardware at the register level is rarely seen in embedded hypervisors as this is very complex and slow. The custom nature of embedded systems means that the need to support unmodified binary-only guest software which require these techniques is rare. The size and efficiency of the implementation is also an issue for an embedded hypervisor, as embedded systems are often much more resource constrained than desktop and server platforms. It is also desirable for the hypervisor to maintain, as closely as possible, the native speed, real-time response and determinism and power efficiency of the underlying hardware platform.  Hypervisor design  Implementations for embedded systems applications have most commonly been based on small microkernel and separation kernel designs, with virtualization built-in as an integral capability. This was introduced with PikeOS in 2005. Five years of reinventing embedded systems design Examples of these approaches have been produced by companies such as Open Kernel Labs (microkernel followed by a separation kernel) and LynuxWorks (separation kernel). VirtualLogix appears to take the position that an approach based on a dedicated Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) would be even smaller and more efficient. This issue is the subject of some ongoing debate. Small kernels versus virtual-machine monitors Are Virtual Machine Monitors Microkernels Done Right? (Response to) Are Virtual-Machine Monitors Microkernels Done Right? However, the main point at issue is the same on all sides of the discussion ‚Äì the speed and size of the implementation (for a given level of functionality) are of major importance. For example: \\" ... hypervisors for embedded use must be real-time capable, as well as resource- miserly.\\"  Resource requirements  Embedded systems are typically highly resource constrained due to cost and technical limitations of the hardware. It is therefore important for an embedded hypervisor to be as efficient as possible. The microkernel and separation kernel based designs allow for small and efficient hypervisors. Thus embedded hypervisors usually have a memory footprint from several tens to several hundred kilobytes, depending on the efficiency of the implementation and the level of functionality provided. An implementation requiring several megabytes of memory (or more) is generally not acceptable. With the small TCB of a type 1 embedded hypervisor, the system can be made highly secure & reliable. Is Your System Secure? Standard software-engineering techniques, such as code inspections and systematic testing, can be used to reduce the number of bugs in such a small code base to a tiny fraction of the defects that must be expected for a hypervisor and guest OS combination that may be 100,000‚Äì300,000 lines in total. Trustworthy Computing Systems  VM communication  One of the most important functions required in an embedded hypervisor is a secure message-passing mechanism, which is needed to support real-time communication between processes. In the embedded environment, a system will typically have a number of closely coupled tasks, some of which may require secure isolation from each other. In a virtualized environment, the embedded hypervisor will support and enforce this isolation between multiple VMs. These VMs will therefore require access to a mechanism that provides low-latency communication between the tasks. An inter- process communication (IPC) mechanism can be used to provide these functions, as well as invoking all system services, and implemented in a manner which ensures that the desired level of VM isolation is maintained. Also, due to its significant impact on system performance, such an IPC mechanism should be highly optimised for minimal latency. Improving IPC by Kernel Design  Hardware requirements  An embedded hypervisor needs to be in complete control of system resources, including memory accesses, to ensure that software cannot break out of the VM. A hypervisor therefore requires the target CPU to provide memory management support (typically using an MMU). Many embedded processors including such as ARM, MIPS and PowerPC have followed desktop and server chip vendors in adding hardware support for virtualization. There are still a large proportion of embedded processors however which do not provide such support and a hypervisor supporting paravirtualization is required. ARM processors are notable in that most of their application class processor designs support a technology called ARM TrustZone, which provides essentially hardware support for one privileged and one unprivileged VM. Normally a minimal Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) OS is run in the Secure World and a native kernel running in the Non-secure World.  Use cases  Some of the most common use cases for an embedded hypervisor are: 1\\\\. OS independence Designers of embedded systems may have many hardware drivers and system services which are specific to a target platform. If support for more than one OS is required on the platform, either concurrently or consecutively using a common hardware design, an embedded hypervisor can greatly simplify the task. Such drivers and system services can be implemented just once for the virtualized environment; these services are then available to any hosted OS. This level of abstraction also allows the embedded developer to implement or change a driver or service in either hardware or software at any point, without this being apparent to the hosted OS. 2\\\\. Support for multiple operating systems on a single processor Typically this is used to run a real- time operating system (RTOS) for low-level real-time functionality (such as the communication stack) while at the same time running a general purpose OS, (GPOS) like Linux or Windows, to support user applications, such as a web browser or calendar. The objective might be to upgrade an existing design without the added complexity of a second processor, or simply to minimize the bill of materials (BoM). 3\\\\. System security An embedded hypervisor is able to provide secure encapsulation for any subsystem defined by the developer, so that a compromised subsystem cannot interfere with other subsystems. For example, an encryption subsystem needs to be strongly shielded from attack to prevent leaking the information the encryption is supposed to protect. As the embedded hypervisor can encapsulate a subsystem in a VM, it can then enforce the required security policies for communication to and from that subsystem. 4\\\\. System reliability The encapsulation of a subsystem components into a VM ensures that failure of any subsystem cannot impact other subsystems. This encapsulation keeps faults from propagating from a subsystem in one VM to a subsystem in another VM, improving reliability. This may also allow a subsystem to be automatically shut down and restarted on fault detection. This can be particularly important for embedded device drivers, as this is where the highest density of fault conditions is seen to occur, and is thus the most common cause of OS failure and system instability. It also allows the encapsulation of operating systems that were not necessarily built to the reliability standards demanded of the new system design. 5\\\\. Dynamic update of system software Subsystem software or applications can be securely updated and tested for integrity, by downloading to a secure VM before ‚Äúgoing live‚Äù in an executing system. Even if this process then fails, the system can revert to its former state by restarting the original software subsystem/application, without halting system operation. 6\\\\. Legacy code re-use Virtualization allows legacy embedded code to be used with the OS environment it has been developed and validated with, while freeing the developer to use a different OS environment in a separate VM for new services and applications. Legacy embedded code, written for a particular system configuration may assume exclusive control of all system resources of memory, I/O and processor. This code base can be re-used unchanged on alternative system configurations of I/O and memory through the use of a VM to present a resource map and functionality that is consistent with the original system configuration, effectively de- coupling the legacy code from the specifics of a new or modified hardware design. Where access to the operating system source code is available, paravirtualization is commonly used to virtualize the OS‚Äôs on processors without hardware virtualization support, and thus the applications supported by the OS can also run unmodified and without re-compilation in new hardware platform designs. Even without source access, legacy binary code can be executed in systems running on processors with hardware virtualization support such as the AMD-V, Intel VT technologies and the latest ARM processors with virtualization support. ARM Virtualization Extensions The legacy binary code could run completely unmodified in a VM with all resource mapping handled by the embedded hypervisor, assuming the system hardware provides equivalent functionality. 7\\\\. IP protection Valuable proprietary IP may need protection from theft or misuse when an embedded platform is being shipped for further development work by (for example) an OEM customer. An embedded hypervisor makes it possible to restrict access by other system software components to a specific part of the system containing IP that needs to be protected. 8\\\\. Software license segregation Software IP operating under one licensing scheme can be separated from other software IP operating under a different scheme.

Soliman (April 25, 1910 - 1972) was a Philippine Military officer who served as Superintendent of the Philippine Military Academy, Commanding General of the Philippine Army, and upon leaving Military service, chief of the National Intelligence Coordinating Agency. He is best remembered in history as the then-anonymous whistleblower who exposed the plans of ex- Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos to place the Republic of the Philippines under Martial Law.  Early life and education  Soliman was born on April 25, 1910 in Candaba, Pampanga. His parents were Candaba Police Chief Paulino Soliman and his wife Concordia Gulapa-Soliman. His paternal family line is believed to be descended from Rajah Soliman, who was one of two paramount rulers of the Rajahnate of Maynila before European colonizers arrived in the Philippines. He graduated from the Philippine Constabulary Academy in 1933, two years before it would be transformed into the Philippine Military Academy in 1935, via the Philippine Commonwealth's National Defense Act (Commonwealth Act No. 1).  Military career  After his graduation as part of the PMA class of 1933, he spent two years as a lieutenant 23rd Philippine Constabulary (PC) Company in Iloilo before being chosen to study in the Air Corps Flight School at Randolph Field, Texas. After a tour of field duty, Soliman was appointed commandant and training officer in various ROTC units, including those of the University of the Philippines, Far Eastern University, the University of Sto Tomas. When World War II broke out, Soliman initially became Executive Officer of the 81st Infantry Detachment, and later became that unit's acting Commanding Officer as they fought in Mindanao. After the surrender of Philippine forces at Bataan, Soliman refused to surrender and joined the Western Leyte guerilla forces as its Chief of Staff. Soliman joined his unit in conducting harassment action against Japanese Forces until he was captured by the Japanese on 8 January 1944. The Japanese shipped him back to Luzon, and then let them go, but he then conducted espionage work on the Japanese forces, went back into hiding, and joined Ramsys' guerilla forces as their intelligence officer. After the war Soliman's military career included the positions of Chief of Plans, Operations and Training in the Armed Forces of the Philippines; Chief of Staff and Deputy Commander of the II Military Area; Member of the SEATO Military Staff Planners; Superintendent of the Philippine Military Academy; Commanding General of the II Military Area; and Commanding General of the Philippine Army.  Role in exposing \\"Oplan Sagittarius\\" A week before Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos declare martial law in September 1972, copies of the plan for its implementation were distributed to key officials within the Armed Forces. As a way of assuring that any whistleblowers could be easily identified, the copies of the plan were distributed with codeword titles taken from the different signs of the Zodiac. The copy marked \\"Sagittarius\\" was given to General Soliman, who commanded the National Intelligence Coordinating Agency at the time. When Senator Benigno Aquino Jr. exposed the existence of \\"Oplan Sagittarius\\" a week before martial law was declared, other generals were able to deny that they had heard of any operation under the said code title, and it was easy for Marcos to pinpoint General Soliman as the whistleblower who gave the information to Aquino. Not long after the declaration of martial law, the Marcos-controlled press reported that Soliman had died of a heart attack, but it is believed that Marcos had ordered that he be killed. Marcos then dissolved the National Intelligence Coordinating Agency (NICA) and put a powerful super-agency, the National Intelligence and Security Authority (NISA) in its place, with General Fabian Ver in command.

Tophill Southwell Terraced houses and a pub in Southwell Southwell is a small coastal village in Tophill on the Isle of Portland, Dorset, between Portland Bill and the village of Easton. Like many of the other villages on Portland, Southwell has commercial industry (Southwell Business Park). The village has one Primary School, Southwell County Primary School. Easton The Square, Easton Easton is the second largest of eight villages on the Isle of Portland in Dorset, England. The village is situated on the top of the island or Tophill, in the English Channel, and was where the Easton Massacre took place. The village has a small square with many shops and shopping arcade, a Secondary school, four churches, a small park, and other amenities. Easton is also the location of Portland Young Offenders Institution. At the south end of Easton is Portland Museum. Along with Fortuneswell, Easton is the main hub of the Isle of Portland's activities. The Grove St Peter's Church, The Grove The Grove is a small village near Easton containing HMP Portland, the Young Offenders Institution. Wakeham Wakeham is a small village near the village of Easton, in Tophill on the Isle of Portland in Dorset, England. Weston Weston is a village in Tophill on the Isle of Portland, Dorset, England. It is on the outskirts of the main village Easton, and near also to the village of Southwell. Weston contains a Roman Villa - one of the few archaeological sites on the Isle of Portland, which is opposite the Royal Manor Arts College. Underhill Fortuneswell Chesil Beach from the hill above Fortuneswell, with much of the village in the foreground. Fortuneswell and Portland Harbour, seen from The Verne. The Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy is on the left. Fortuneswell is the largest of eight villages on the Isle of Portland, just off the coast of Dorset in the English Channel. The village lies on steeply sloping land on the northern edge of the island (Underhill), where Chesil Beach, the tombolo which connects the island to the mainland, joins the island. The village has a main shopping street with several shops. The nearby villages of Chiswell and Castletown almost merge into Fortuneswell, as they share the limited space on the northern slopes of the island. However, Fortuneswell occupies the steepest land far above sea level, whereas Castletown and Chiswell occupy flat land close to sea level, next to Portland Harbour and Chesil Beach respectively. Castletown Castletown is a small village in Underhill on the Isle of Portland in Dorset. It has a sandy beach and has a working port, Portland Port. The village itself is on the shores of Portland Harbour, and includes Portland Castle and the Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy. The village has a long naval history, and the Royal Navy had a base in the harbour until 1999. Now Portland Port is commercial, whilst still servicing and berthing Royal Fleet Auxiliary ships. Chiswell Cottages on Brandy Row in Chiswell Chiswell (rarely Chesilton) is a small fishing village at the southern end of Chesil Beach, in Underhill. The small bay at Chiswell is called Chesil Cove. The village itself is indistinguishable from Fortuneswell, the largest village on the island, as the two settlements are very close. However this distinction can be made: Chiswell occupies flat land close to sea level, whereas Fortuneswell's streets wind up and down the steep hills. Over the centuries Chiswell has battled with the sea and has been regularly flooded during rough winter storms which can over top the high Chesil Beach which protects the village. Flood defences were installed during the 1980s to alleviate the problems, although storms do still breach them, as in the winter months of 2014.

Generally, there is an increasing use of English observed in many other programmes. Facilities The university has buildings scattered throughout the cities of Winterthur and Zurich, as well as campus-like facilities in W√§denswil. Despite the fact that the schools and institutes are not all centrally located, students are rarely (if ever) required to relocate to other venues. 8 libraries are available for use by members of the university, as are the six on-location canteens.

The trio started out as a funk band but switched to rock after seeing a concert by The Who. Seeing Alice Cooper play was also an inspiration. Music critic Peter Margasak retrospectively wrote that David \\"pushed the group in a hard-rock direction that presaged punk, and while this certainly didn‚Äôt help them find a following in the mid-70s, today it makes them look like visionaries.\\" They are seen by many people as one of the first punk bands in the world. The band broke up in 1977 but reformed in 2009 when the Drag City label released their '70s demos for the first time. History Formation In 1964, the three young Hackney brothers (David, Bobby and Dannis) were sat down by their father to witness The Beatles' first appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show. The following day, David found a discarded guitar in an alley and set about learning to play. Brothers Bobby and Dannis soon followed suit and they began playing music together. Later, the young trio purchased the best instruments money could buy with money their mother won in a settlement. The brothers practiced and recorded early demos in a room in the family home and performed their earliest gigs from their garage....For the Whole World to See liner notes. Originally calling themselves Rock Fire Funk Express, guitarist David convinced his brothers to change the name of the band to Death after their father died in an accident. David wanted to change the meaning of the word: \\"His concept was spinning death from the negative to the positive. It was a hard sell,\\" Bobby Hackney recalled in 2010. Album recording and dissolution In 1975, Death recorded seven songs written by David and Bobby at Detroit's United Sound Studios with engineer Jim Vitt. According to the Hackney family, Columbia Records president Clive Davis funded the recording sessions but implored the band to change its name to something more commercially palatable. When the Hackneys refused, Davis ceased his support. The band only recorded seven songs instead of the planned dozen. The following year they self-released a single taken from these sessions on their label Tryangle Records. The single, \\"Politicians in My Eyes\\" b/w \\"Keep on Knocking,\\" saw a run of only 500 copies. The Hackney brothers ended the band in 1977. The brothers then moved to Burlington, Vermont and released two albums of gospel rock as The 4th Movement in the early 1980s. David moved back to Detroit in 1982, and died of lung cancer in 2000. Bobby and Dannis still reside in Vermont and lead the reggae band Lambsbread. Dannis is currently the drummer for the Vermont-based Rock/Funk band The Aerolites. Rediscovery Copies of the \\"Politicians in My Eyes\\" 12\\", and the story of Death continued to circulate in collector's circles, with some copies going up to the cost of $800 due to their extreme rarity; one source of them was Don Schwenk, a friend of the Hackney's who was originally commissioned to create the album art for the upcoming LP, and was given a box of the singles in exchange. MP3s of the two songs from the single eventually found their way to Chunklet in 2008; around this time Bobby Hackney's son Julian moved to California and heard the Death songs after a recommendation of a roommate and immediately recognized his father's voice. Once the news of the discovery and the story of Death began to spread, it eventually reached Drag City Records, who contacted the Hackney's about the possible release of the album, who provided the label with the original master tape: In 2009, Drag City released all seven Death songs from their 1975 United Sound sessions on CD and LP under the title ...For the Whole World to See. In the meantime, the sons of Bobby Hackney (Julian, Urian, and Bobby Jr.), wanting to get the word out more, started a band called Rough Francis (named after David's one time recording), covering the songs of Death after discovering the old recordings online. A New York Times article in March 2009 by Mike Rubin, covering one of Rough Francis' live shows and the history of Death introduced the band to an even wider audience. The popularity eventually reached Mickey Leigh, who invited both bands to play Joey Ramone's birthday party. In September 2009, a reformed Death played three shows with original members Bobby and Dannis Hackney, with Lambsbread guitarist Bobbie Duncan taking the place of the late David Hackney.

The route is long, and served by six tram-train sets, built by Swiss manufacturer Stadler Rail. The route from the airport to the city's business center at Part-Dieu Villette (Lyon-Part-Dieu railway station) by way of Vaulx-en-Velin ‚Äì La Soie (for transfer to Metro Line A) and Meyzieu takes roughly half an hour. Services run every 15‚Äì30 minutes. The project included building of new tracks, while the remainder of the route runs along the existing T3 tram line, on which passing tracks were built in some stations to allow express service. The service is independently run and is not a part of the TCL system, although it appears on TCL maps. The Conseil g√©n√©ral of the Rh√¥ne franchised the operation of this line for 30 years to Rh√¥nexpress, a consortium including Vinci SA (28.2%), Veolia Transport (28.2%), Vossloh Infrastructure Service (4.2%), Cegelec Centre Est (2.8%) and the Caisse des d√©p√¥ts et consignations. It opened on 9 August 2010. Background and construction During February 2001, the General Council of the Rhone and SYTRAL, the urban transport authority for Lyon metropolitan area, announced their intentions to introduce a double-deck streetcar service that would run between Lyon Part-Dieu, Meyzieu ZI and Lyon Saint Exupery. Upon completion, it would become the only public transportation system between Lyon and Saint- Exup√©ry. SYTRAL oversaw the construction of the initial line, commonly referred to as the T3 Links, which ran between Lyon Part-Dieu and Meyzieu ZI; its commissioning in December 2006 represented a major milestone for the project. During January 2007, a concession contract covering the second line of the Rh√¥nExpress was signed by both the General Council Chairman and Rh√¥nExpress consortium, the latter being responsible for the full implementation of the project, including design, financing, construction, and maintenance activities. This new link between downtown Lyon and its airport was developed under a public-private partnership (PPP). Its estimated cost was stated to be ‚Ç¨120m; it was financed by the consortium through various means, ‚Ç¨40m was received through several grants, another ‚Ç¨62m came through borrowing by Rh√¥nExpress, while the remainder was contributed by its shareholders; all debt is to be repaid with the support of the Department, which provides an annual retainer to the consortium. During July 2008, the tramway was declared to be a public utility; construction work commenced three months later. Both design and construction were managed by a variety of companies, including VINCI, Eurovia Railway Works (ETF), Cegelec Centre Est, Campenon Bernard Management, South East EJL and Roiret Transport. The completed line is also managed by a consortium, headed by VINCI, which was awarded the concession to operate it for a fixed period of 30 years. During 2009, much of the tramway's infrastructure was built, delivery of the rolling stock also took place around this timeframe. The line is electrified; to provide this electrification along the new section of line, a pair of substations were built to power the newly installed overhead catenary wire. This is energised at 750V DC, suitable for operating the tram-trains at speeds of up to . The line's support infrastructure includes a dedicated operations centre, comprising offices and maintenance facilities, along with storage sidings for the rolling stock, a sand replenishment station and vehicle cleaning facilities. Both day-to-day operations of the tramway and all maintenance activities associated with it are responsibilities of the consortium. Operations Trial operations of the new line occurred during February 2010 while commercial operations started in August of that year. Since launch, the trams have been typically run at a 15-minute interval at peak hours, which fall between 6am and 9pm. A reduced service level runs every 30 minutes between 5am and 6am, as well as between 9pm and midnight. The consortium has reportedly been allocated funds to acquire additional tram-trains in the future. In anticipation of the future growth in passenger numbers, all of the stations were constructed to accommodate double trains if required. By early 2019, the Rh√¥nexpress had reportedly carried in excess of 10 million passengers since its inauguration nine years prior; during 2018 alone, it was recorded that over 1.5 million passengers had used the line, an 8.6 percent increase from the previous year. However, the system has been criticised for its high prices, as well as for being awarded contractual rights for a monopoly along its route, the latter having been subject to legal challenges. During the 2010s, multiple petitions have been organised, calling for a reduction in the fares on the Rh√¥nexpress. During April 2019, the Lyon Metropole commenced negotiations with the consortium, intending to secure a decrease in fares; David Kimelfeld, President of the Lyon Metropole, declared that: \\"We can‚Äôt sit back and let it continue like this\\". Reportedly, if a compromise cannot be found, the existing agreement that the Rh√¥nexpress is operated under may be terminated.  Route and stations  Rh√¥nexpress uses the line T3 infrastructure built by SYTRAL from Lyon to Meyzieu (a hub for commuters with a large surface parking lot available). From there, new tracks were built specifically for Rh√¥nexpress all the way to Lyon-Saint Exup√©ry Airport. The route has a total length of , of which has been recently built, running largely between the Meyzieu ZI and the Lyon-Saint Exupery stations. There are four stations alone the line: * Part- Dieu (Metro Line B) * Vaulx-en-Velin (Metro Line A) * Meyzieu Z.I. * Lyon- Saint Exup√©ry Airport Of these four stations, Vaulx-en-Velin and Meyzieu ZI are intermediate stations. All stations have been designed with accessibility in mind, either being directly accessible from the ground level or via provided elevators. Further accessibility measures included the presence of braille signage indicating levels and locations. The information terminals that provide live train schedules include periodic audio announcements for passenger convenience. Rolling stock The six Tango 12 tram-train sets were built by Stadler Rail at its factory in Wilhelmsruh, Berlin. Rolling stock was chosen after a tender, taking into account the technical criteria (speed up to ), durability, security and compatibility with the common use of the T3 line infrastructure, economics (capacity adapted to the traffic and prospects for their development) as well as comfort and aesthetics. The interior and exterior designs of the Stadler Tango were created by RCP Design Global, who had already designed the tramways in Le Mans, Angers and Paris. All doors are automatically operated, and are designed to readily allow the movement of wheelchairs and pushchairs. Each tram-train is provisioned with two dedicated areas that provide greater stability for wheelchair-bound passengers during travel; in addition to grab bars, seat belts are also provided for the purpose of restraining the chair.

He was, by profession, a carpenter. Youth Alfonso arrived in France at the beginning of the 1930s. In 1934, he joined the Jeunesse communiste (Communist Youth) and became responsible for the Ivry-sur-Seine group. In 1936, he set out as a volunteer for republican Spain, arriving on 27 August 1936. He served as a machine-gunner with the rank of sergeant, and from 1937, the rank of lieutenant. In 1938, his right hand was wounded. He was, shortly afterward, named political commissar of the 2nd International Brigade with the rank of captain. In February 1939, he was repatriated to the camp at Saint-Cyprien, from which he escaped. Second World War In May 1942, Alfonso joined the French resistance. Arrested, he was deported to Germany, where, after six months in a camp, he succeeded in escaping and returned to Paris where he became head of a FTP-MOI resistance group. He participated in many operations in Paris and in the Orl√©ans region, notably the execution of General Ernst Von Schaumburg, commandant of Greater Paris, and on 29 September 1943 of SS officer , responsible for the STO in France. Assassination of Ritter The FTP-MOI intelligence service had noticed the strengthening of security measures on rue Saint-Dominique in Paris. A large Mercedes with swastikas on the sides regularly entered the courtyard of the Maison de la Chimie, and a Nazi official was let out. After four months of planning, the military leadership of the FTP requested Marcel Rayman, and Alfonso to plan an attack against this official. The operation was put under the authority of Missak Manouchian, the military overseer of the FTP-MOI, from late August 1943. On the morning of 28 September 1943, the Mercedes was parked for a few minutes before picking up its passenger. Alfonso fired at the SS officer as he got into the car. The windshield blocked the bullets, but the man was injured, probably by flying glass. He attempted to get out of the car through the opposite door, but Rayman hit him, fatally, with three bullets. The fighters only learned the man's identity through the German press: it was General , the assistant in France to Fritz Sauckel, who was responsible for the mobilization and deportation of labor under the German STO (Obligatory Work Service) in Nazi-occupied Europe. Ritter was the chief recruiter of slave labor in occupied France. The front-page denunciation of this \\"abominable act\\" and the official funeral at the √©glise de la Madeleine gave the operation even more impact. Arrest and execution Alfonso was arrested in October 1943, and he was shot at the fort Mont-Val√©rien on 21 February 1944, along with 21 other members of the FTP-MOI. He had a wife and a small child.

He was a close business associate of fellow printer John Wolfe. After 1591, Wolfe ceased printing the lucrative metrical psalter of Thomas Sternhold and John Hopkins, and Windet succeeded him in becoming the sole printer of the work for patent-holder Richard Day.Hoppe, 263. At some point, Windet succeeded Wolfe as London's City Printer. Wolfe passed on some of his printing ornaments to Windet after he decided to stop printing and focus solely on publishing in 1594. On Wolfe's death in 1601, Windet was appointed administrator of his estate.Hoppe, 266. In 1604, Windet printed John Dowland's influential Lachrimae, or Seaven Teares, a collection of the composer's pavans and one of the most important musical works of the era. He also printed all of composer Tobias Hume's known compositions in two compilations‚ÄîFirst Part of Ayres (1605) and Captaine Humes Poeticall Musicke (1607). Windet probably needed to use all his skills as a printer to accommodate the unconventional Hume. The First Part of Ayres contains instructions for what may be the earliest examples of pizzicato (\\"to be plaide with your fingers...your Bow ever in your hand\\") and col legno (\\"Drum this with the back of your Bow\\"), which were probably eccentricities at the time.Morrow, et al. In \\"Lesson for two to play upon one Viole\\" of First Part of Ayres, one of the players must sit in the lap of the other. Windet's other music publications included printings for Robert Jones, John Coprario and Thomas Ford. On 25 December 1590, Windet took on William Stansby as his apprentice.Gants. Six years later, Windet gave Stansby his freedom, and on 7 January 1597, Stansby was admitted as a freeman of the Stationers' Company. Probably lacking in capital, Stansby decided to stay with Windet at his shop at \\"the Crosse Keys at Powles Wharfe (St Benet Paul's Wharf)\\".Gants; Miller. Windet helped Stansby print his first book, The Policy of the Turkish Empire in April 1597. Windet continued printing until his death in either 1610 or 1611, at which point Stansby took over his Cross Keys shop; on 11 September 1611, Stansby inherited 47 of Windet's copyrights.Bracken.

It is the second online game of the Xuan- Yuan Sword series. The graphics are anime-style with various Chinese themes. This game places great emphasis on teamwork and building relationships between players. The game was taken out of service in late 2012.Hands-on with Dream of Mirror Online - Massively Domo has been closed In October 2014, SubaGames announced it was working on returning the service with crowdfunding from Kickstarter.Dream Of Mirror Online Returning - MMOGames Dream of Mirror Online Returning! In November 2014, DOMO was approved for re-release through Steam Greenlight. An official release date for the Closed Beta was given by Suba Games on February 2, 2015 for the date of February 13, 2015 at 5:00 PM EST. Plot The central story involves an artifact called the Kunlun Mirror, an ancient artifact of time capable of copying everything from the real world to keep a record of things that exist. An unknown event caused the mirror to have a flawed reflection. As a result, \\"delusions\\" from peoples minds become monsters and ordinary creatures also transform when reflected in the mirror world. There are of the twelve Mirror Kings in DOMO, rulers of the Mirror World, and some have disappeared causing the remaining kings to summon human beings from the real world (the players) to the Mirror World to help defeat these delusions.DOMO - Dream Of Mirror Online Gameplay Aeria has billed DOMO as a \\"social MMORPG\\". The gameplay encourages players to build relationships and form teams. Players can form special friendships, student- teacher, or even love relationships within the game that grant extra benefits such as abilities, fame, titles, or items;www.aeriagames.com :: DOMO - Relationships the Asian versions even currently offer in-game character marriages that grant special abilities to the lucky couple.Domo Indonesia - Marriage Some characters also have special fated ties to other players that are based on the birthday selected for the character at creation. These relationships are marked by an arched red line, or \\"love line\\" that will form between the two. The love line represents not only potential romantic matches, but also possible family relationships and rivalries. Players do not have to acknowledge these love lines in any way; most players completely ignore them. However, there is no way to turn off love lines at this time.www.aeriagames.com :: DOMO - Destined Relationships Same-sex marriage is now supported, meaning a female player can marry another female player, and likewise for the male players. Races There are 4 DOMO races: Humans, who are described as friendly and of ordinary capability; Shura, a beast-like race that can resemble both a fox (females) and dragon (males), are described as aggressive and with great physical prowess; Sylph, spirit-like creatures with great knowledge and wisdom but out of touch with their emotions; and Sprites, who are small and childlike in appearance.DOMO - Dream Of Mirror Online The official DOMO website describes each race to be uniquely proficient in skill, but this does not significantly, if at all, affect the game of the player. A Sprite, despite their small size, can be just as competent as a Mercenary Shura of the same skill level. In the original release of the game these special race-skills made a big difference (such as Shura being better at physical attributes and Sylph at mental attributes), but this was phased out before the North American version of the game was released, making the differences today mostly cosmetic.www.aeriagames.com :: View topic - Stat differences between races It also affects certain dialog with NPCs and determines the village new characters start in. Professions The job system is similar to that of Final Fantasy XI. Every character starts with the occupation Commoner, which grants no special skills. After reaching level 10 as a commoner, by completing specified tasks, the player can qualify for new tasks. Levels, attributes, and skill points are recorded separately for each job. Players may go to an NPC in any town to select a job which their level qualifies them to take. Levels, attributes, and skill points are recorded separately for each job type. There are currently 13 professions in the North American version. They are Blademaster, Dancer, Doctor, Fencer, Hunter, Martial Artist, Mercenary, Merchant, Musician, Shaman, Thief, Wizard, and Witch Doctor, the new profession as of early June, 2009.www.aeriagames.com :: DOMO - Job Classes Pets Pet tokens (which can be used in-game to get a random pet egg (level 0), including the Special Edition pets) and pet chests are available for purchase in the game's cash shop. However, existing pets can also be traded in game, making it easier for those who would rather use in- game funds to purchase one. Also a quest in game can award the participants a hibernating Metal egg. Pets have 4 stages of growth: egg, child, youth, and adult. To enable the pet to continue leveling an evolution stone is needed to evolve the pet to the next stage. At level 61 (adulthood) players can purchase pet saddles to ride the pet. Currently a pet saddle can only be bought through in-game cash shop or trading between players. Note that players can only ride Metal, Sapphire, Ruby and Rock pets. There are currently six types of pets, each with an associated element and their own strengths and weaknesses: Metal - metal element, looks like a golden bear. Jade - wood element, looks like a cactus. Sapphire - water element, looks like a long-necked turtle. Ruby - fire element, looks like a flying cat. Rock - earth element, looks like a wild boar. Love - no element, looks like a girl. There is also a special Bird pet, which can be obtained like any other pet (at a lower chance), it also follows the same evolution pattern as the other pets, but at its first stage of evolution, it either obtains a wood, water or fire element attribute at random, and as it levels up it develops skills based on that element. A Dragon pet type has also been released since. Each pet comes in a regular form and also five \\"special edition\\" versions that offer an alternate appearance. Traveling Once a character reaches level 15 in any job, they become eligible to complete a quest that grants them the ability to fly on almost any weapon (that the player can equip). The flying system is based on the sword- flying myths in Chinese legends. In addition, there have been special items only available through purchase at the cash shop that are made for flight e.g. the special flying broom released in Halloween. Each different piece of flying equipment has its own features and specific speed; however, some weapons simply cannot fly, and others will only fly after achieving a specific level. Along with moving faster than running on the ground, flying allows characters to cross geographic barriers such as mountains or oceans and perform sky stunts. Flying level is further improved by completing specific quests that improve a character's flight speed and maximum altitude. The current max flying level in the North American version is 22.www.aeriagames.com :: DOMO - Flying Another way to travel in Dream of Mirror Online is by riding a pet. When the Bird / Sapphire / Metal / Ruby / Rock pets reach level 61 and evolved into its adulthood stage, players can purchase a saddle from the cash shop and use it to ride their pets.DOMOcamp: Pets References External links *Dream of Mirror Online New NA-EU English website *Dream of Mirror Online Release DOMO release discussion Category:Massively multiplayer online role- playing games Category:2005 video games Category:Fantasy massively multiplayer online role-playing games Category:Video games developed in Taiwan Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games Category:Xuanyuan Jian ","title":"Dream of Mirror Online"},{"id":"21578136","text":"Nehmitzsee is a lake in Landkreis Oberhavel, Brandenburg, Germany.

Social sustainability has had considerably less attention in public dialogue than economic and environmental sustainability. There are several approaches to sustainability. The first, which posits a triad of environmental sustainability, economic sustainability, and social sustainability, is the most widely accepted as a model for addressing sustainability. The concept of \\"social sustainability\\" in this approach encompasses such topics as: social equity, livability, health equity, community development, social capital, social support, human rights, labour rights, placemaking, social responsibility, social justice, cultural competence, community resilience, and human adaptation. A second, more recent, approach suggests that all of the domains of sustainability are social: including ecological, economic, political and cultural sustainability. These domains of social sustainability are all dependent upon the relationship between the social and the natural, with the \\"ecological domain\\" defined as human embeddedness in the environment. In these terms, social sustainability encompasses all human activities. It is not just relevant to the focussed intersection of economics, the environment and the social. (See the Venn diagram and the Circles of Sustainability diagram). Definitions According to the Western Australia Council of Social Services (WACOSS): \\"Social sustainability occurs when the formal and informal processes; systems; structures; and relationships actively support the capacity of current and future generations to create healthy and liveable communities. Socially sustainable communities are equitable, diverse, connected and democratic and provide a good quality of life.\\" Another definition has been developed by Social Life, a UK-based social enterprise specialising in place-based innovation. They define social sustainability as \\"a process for creating sustainable, successful places that promote wellbeing, by understanding what people need from the places they live and work. Social sustainability combines design of the physical realm with design of the social world ‚Äì infrastructure to support social and cultural life, social amenities, systems for citizen engagement and space for people and places to evolve.\\"S.Woodcraft et al (2011) Design for Social Sustainability, Social Life, London Dimensions High life expectancy can be achieved with low CO2 emissions, for example in Costa Rica, a country which also ranks high on the Happy Planet Index. Social Life have developed a framework for social sustainability which has four dimensions: amenities and infrastructure, social and cultural life, voice and influence, and space to grow. Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen gives the following dimensions for social sustainability: *Equity - the community provides equitable opportunities and outcomes for all its members, particularly the poorest and most vulnerable members of the community *Diversity - the community promotes and encourages diversity *Interconnected/Social cohesions - the community provides processes, systems and structures that promote connectedness within and outside the community at the formal, informal and institutional level *Quality of life - the community ensures that basic needs are met and fosters a good quality of life for all members at the individual, group and community level (e.g. health, housing, education, employment, safety) *Democracy and governance - the community provides democratic processes and open and accountable governance structures. *Maturity - the individual accept the responsibility of consistent growth and improvement through broader social attributes (e.g. communication styles, behavioural patterns, indirect education and philosophical explorations) Also we can speak of Sustainable Human Development that can be seen as development that promotes the capabilities of present people without compromising capabilities of future generations.Sen, A.K. (2000) ‚ÄòThe ends and means of sustainability‚Äô, keynote address at the International Conference on Transition to sustainability, Tokyo, May In the human development paradigm, environment and natural resources should constitute a means of achieving better standards of living just as income represents a means of increasing social expenditure and, in the end, well-being.Anand, S. and Sen, A.K. (1996) ‚ÄòSustainable human development: concepts and priorities‚Äô, Office of Development Studies Discussion Paper, No. 1, UNDP, New York The different aspects of social sustainability are often considered in socially responsible investing (SRI).

Sustainability. https://doi.org/10.3390/su11133562  Application and Verification  The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights state that countries have the obligation to ‚Äúrespect, protect, and fulfill human rights and fundamental freedoms‚Äù and that business enterprises are required to comply with all applicable laws and respect human rights. Both production and procurement of goods and services should be documented to verify satisfaction of these international principles and laws. The UN Guiding Principles also include a reporting framework, which teaches companies how to report their interaction with human rights issues. In addition resources like Free2Work,Free2Work the Global Reporting Initiative, and Business and Human Rights Resource Centre all provide information on organizational disclosures and performance in social sustainability. Certifications from internationally recognized and accredited organizations are available to aid in verifying the social sustainability of products and services. The Forest Stewardship Council (paper and forest products), and Kimberly Process (diamonds) are examples of such organizations and initiatives.

In early life he worked for the Conservative Party, but joined the UK Independence Party (UKIP) when it was founded in 1993. As Richard Grantley, he was a member of the House of Lords from 1995 to 1999. Early life The son of John Norton, 7th Baron Grantley, Norton was born in 1956, and was the maternal grandson of William Hare, 5th Earl of Listowel. His ancestral Norton family included Sir Richard Norton, who was attainted for his role as one of the leaders of the ill-fated Rising of the North in 1569, and Sir Fletcher Norton who was Speaker of the House of Commons from 1770 to 1780 and was created Baron Grantley of Markenfield in 1782. He was educated at Garden House, Eaton House, Ampleforth College, and New College, Oxford, which he entered with an Open Scholarship in Mathematics, but graduated in Law. He was President of the Oxford Union in 1976.The Ampleforth Journal, vol. 81 (1976), p. 82. Career Norton worked in the Conservative Research Department from 1977 to 1981. In 1978 he was seconded to work for the Opposition front bench in the House of Lords. During the 1979 general election campaign he worked in Margaret Thatcher's Private Office. After the election, he became a special adviser for trade and energy and wrote The Benefits of Trade, with an introduction by the then Secretary of State for Trade, Rt. Hon. John Biffen MP. A councillor of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea from 1982 to 1986, he was the Conservative parliamentary candidate for the unwinnable Wentworth constituency at the 1983 general election.The Rt Hon the Lord Grantley, biography at debretts.com. He joined the United Kingdom Independence Party on its foundation and became one of its early patrons. On 24 June 1995 he succeeded his father, John Norton, 7th Baron Grantley,GRANTLEY at leighrayment.com. and thus became UKIP's first representative in Parliament. In 1996 he made his maiden speech in the House of Lords in the presence of his maternal grandfather, the Earl of Listowel, a member of the House of Lords since 1931, a feat unlikely ever to be repeated. In 1997 he became leader of UKIP in the House of Lords. He spoke in the House on five occasions. At the time of the reforms brought about by the House of Lords Act 1999, he did not stand for election as a continuing member, and so left the House in November 1999. He remains a member of UKIP, though he now supports the Brexit Party. In 1981 Grantley became a banker and international project financier at Morgan Grenfell, Deutsche Bank, and HSBC. He was a director of Morgan Grenfell International Limited and of HSBC Project and Export Finance. He was head of oil and gas project finance at both institutions, and retired in 2005. Grantley is chairman of Milner street Residents' Association in Chelsea. He lives at 8 Halsey Street, Cheslea SW3 2QH. He was a patron of Save Sloane Square, which campaigned to prevent the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea from turning the centre of Sloane Square into a crossroads.Our Patrons at savesloanesquare.co.uk. He also participated in the successful campaign to prevent the developers of the Chelsea Barracks site from demolishing the Garrison Church. He is a patron of the Vaughan Parents Action Group which campaigned to prevent the Cardinal Vaughan Memorial School, one of the outstanding Catholic state schools in London, from being turned into an ordinary local school. Grantley was a Knight of Honour and Devotion of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta for 38 years and served on the council of its British Association, and as a director of The Hospital of St John and St Elizabeth. For ten years he was a director of The Order of St John Care Homes Trust. He is a regular worshipper at the London Oratory and a long-standing devotee of the traditional Latin Mass. Grantley is a keen bridge player. In 1972 he reached the final of the Daily Mail National Schools Bridge Competition; he was a regular member of the House of Lords bridge team in its annual matches against the House of Commons; and he was a member of the Polish Club team which won the Devonshire Cup in 2011 and 2015.

The London and Birmingham Railway had already built a branch from Blisworth to serve Northampton and extend to Peterborough. The success of this, the Northampton and Peterborough Railway encouraged the directors to look for other ventures. They decided upon a branch from Rugby to Stamford which would link up with other new railways in the east of the country. At approximately the same time the Midland Railway was building its Syston to Peterborough line which opened in 1848. It was therefore necessary to share its line between Luffenham and Stamford. Authorisation The \\"Act to empower the London and Birmingham Railway Company to make a Branch Railway from Rugby to the Syston and Peterborough Railway near Stamford.\\" (The Rugby and Stamford Railway Act, 1846). 9 Victoria, cap. lxvii. was passed in 1846. a month before the line became part of the London and North Western Railway. Construction Like the earlier branch it was built as a single line which could be doubled at a later date if needed. From Rugby the line followed the valley of the Warwickshire Avon and then the Welland Valley. Although it eased construction with few earthworks it involved a number of river crossings. During the construction the major contractor became bankrupt in 1848. Joseph Firbank, railway contractor, lost much of his savings as a result. Opening and expansion The section from Rugby to Market Harborough, opened in 1850. Originally single track, it was doubled at the end of 1878.Preston Hendry, R., Powell Hendry, R., (1982) An historical survey of selected LMS stations : layouts and illustrations. Vol. 1 Oxford Publishing Market Harborough to Rockingham opened a month late, but the remainder to Luffenham was not completed until a year later. The line was not doubled throughout until 1878. The increased traffic into Rugby proved a problem, particularly when the Northampton Loop Line opened in 1881. The LNWR therefore applied to build a flyover at the south end of the station and a single track viaduct of some 30 arches which would bring the line in from Clifton Mill. These were completed in 1885. At Market Harborough the Midland Railway arrived in 1857 on its way to Bedford and London. The Midland arranged to share the station but traffic increased to such a degree that a flyover was planned over the LNWR lines north of the station. However instead the two companies build a new joint station which opened in 1884 although not fully completed until February 1886.Butler, P., (2007) A History of the Railways of Northamptonshire, Great Addington: Silver Link Publishing Passenger traffic was not great, with only a few trains each way on weekdays and two on Sundays.The Rugby to Stamford Line in relation to Midland lines around 1850 In order to gain a more direct route the LNWR gained permission to build a line from to the Northampton and Peterborough Railway line near Wansford. This opened for freight on 2 July 1879, and passengers on 1 November. Although the line from Seaton to Luffenham was now of little importance, it remained double and Morcott station was built as a double line station. The section was not singled until 1907. Closure Despite offering a more direct route between the Midlands and East Anglia, the line was closed on 6 June 1966 as part of the Beeching Axe in favour of the longer Birmingham to Peterborough Line which served larger population centres. In January 2019, Campaign for Better Transport released a report identifying the line which was listed as Priority 2 for reopening. Priority 2 is for those lines which require further development or a change in circumstances (such as housing developments).

The castle was built over seven years, from 1525 to 1532, by Norway's last Roman Catholic Archbishop, Olav Engelbrektsson.Olav Engelbrekktson (University of Norway Documentation) Steinvikholm castle became a powerful fortification by the time it was built, and it is the largest construction raised in the Norwegian middle age. Castle Steinvikholm on Skatval Topographic plan of Steinvikholm from 1875 The castle occupies about half of the land on the rocky island. The absence of a spring meant that fresh water had to be brought from the mainland. A wooden bridge served as the only way to the island other than boat. Although the castle design was common across Europe in 1525, its medieval design was becoming obsolete because of the improved siege firepower offered by gunpowder and cannons. History The castle was constructed at the instruction of Olav Engelbrektsson (c. 1480‚Äì 1538), Archbishop of the Diocese of Nidaros. Construction started after his return from a meeting with the Pope in Rome, presumably in anticipation of impending military-religious conflict.Steinvikholm slott (Norsk institutt for kulturminneforskning) As Archbishop Engelbrektsson's resistance to the encroachment of Danish rule escalated, first with King Frederick I of Denmark and his successor King Christian III of Denmark, Steinvikholm Castle and Nidarholm Abbey became the Roman Catholic Church's military strongholds in Norway. In April 1537, the Danish-Norwegian Reformation succeeded in driving the archbishop from the castle into exile at Lier in the Netherlands (now in Belgium), where he died on 7 February 1538. At the castle the archbishop left behind St. Olav's shrine and other treasures from Nidaros Cathedral (Trondheim). The original coffin containing St. Olav's body remained at Steinvikholm until it was returned to Nidaros Cathedral in 1564. Since 1568, the site of St. Olav's grave in Nidaros has been unknown.Olav Engelbrekktson (University of Norway Documentation) From the 17th to 19th century, the island was used as a quarry and some of its masonry was sold and removed from the site. This activity was condoned by the Danish-Norwegian authorities as a way of eliminating a monument to the opposition of the Danish‚ÄìNorwegian Union. Modern usage Steinvikholm fort is owned and operated today by The Society for the Preservation of Norwegian Ancient Monuments (Fortidsminneforeningen). The island has been the site of the midnight opera, Olav Engelbrektsson, which details the life and struggles of the archbishop. The opera is held in August annually with libretto by Edvard Hoem and music by Henning Sommerro. The opera has been organized by Steinvikholm Musikkteater (now Opera Tr√∏ndelag) since the beginning in 1993.

It was made for intaglio printing, relief printing, and lithography. It could be used either electrically or hand driven. It earned patents in the United States (U.S. Patent No. 1,069,796) and Great Britain (British Patent No. 238,946). History Dickerson earned his Master of Science in Art at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison in the mid-1950s. While considering possible subjects for his master's thesis, he began thinking about the need for a better print-making press. He had a revelation about how to design a single press that would do the work of a plate intaglio, relief block, and stone lithographic press, and would do it better. Dickerson found a European craftsman to build him a prototype of the press in his garage. After Dickerson worked on the press more, he eventually earned patents in the U.S. and Britain and began selling the printing presses to colleges and artists all over the world. From that point on, the Dickerson Combination Press was Dickerson's main source of income.Glazer, Fred. \\"Master of the Arts\\". South Haven Daily Tribune. February 10, 1995. This press design is still in production in various sizes. Intaglio printing The user is able to adjust pressure easily and rapidly to the exact degree needed for any given plate. One would bring the upper roll down to the plate by turning a single adjustment screw. The roll automatically reaches a perfect parallel position with the plate (blanket) surface. Then two end adjustment screws would be turned down to meet the top of the roll's bearing blocks. If the user needed to add pressure on one end of the roll, he could simply turn the appropriate adjustment screw. The user is able to release or reapply pressure at any time (without changing pressure adjustment) by merely raising or lowering a lever. This eliminates problems such as starting or removing paper or felts that do not run out completely from between the rolls. Relief printing The flexibility of the Dickerson Press allows numerous approaches not possible with other machines. When using the top roller, the user can adjust it so that the thickest blocks will pass under it. It is not necessary to pad the relief from below because once brought down to the surface to be printed, the roller (or scraper bar in certain techniques) holds its position before, during, and after the print is made. Since the roller can be made to cant about 15 degrees, it will conform to uneven or warped surfaces. Sensitive pressure adjustment allows a range of printing from the richest blacks to the most velvety grays. Reliefs can be printed either face up or face down, to provide perfect color registry. Lithography For use as a stone lithography press, standard size wooden scraper bars replace the upper roller. The scraper, in its holder, is suspended from a central adjustment screw which allows it to conform to the surface of the stone. Metal plate lithographs may be printed with the scraper bar or the printing roll.Dickerson, Edward Ted. Dickerson Combination Press. Pamphlet.

Membership in NAGAP provides an opportunity to network with professional colleagues at all sizes and types of institutions: large and small, public and private, secular and non-secular. The annual conference, development institutes, membership directory, email newsletter, Perspectives journal, mentor program, and chapter affiliations all help facilitate communication among members. History 25 Significant Events in the Life of NAGAP -April 15, 1987‚ÄîAfter a recruiting workshop held at Babson College, a group of graduate admissions personnel suggested the creation of a forum for networking with colleagues about their mutual concerns in the growing graduate admissions field. Also, the admissions professionals had a desire to create a unified schedule of graduate fairs for the Northeastern region. -Summer-Fall 1987‚ÄîThe group held a second meeting and NEAGAP (New England Association of Graduate Admissions Professionals) was born. Donald Shaw from Springfield College in Massachusetts was chosen the first president of the new organization. The first membership mailing garnered 32 members from New England and 15 members from outside the region. The treasury rapidly grew to $1,159.16, based mostly on the $35 membership fee. With the assistance of Peterson's Guides, Inc., the fledgling association also published and mailed its first newsletter, which became a journal three years later. -April 1988‚ÄîThe first NEAGAP conference was held at Sturbridge, Massachusetts, with approximately 100 conference participants in attendance. -April 26, 1991‚ÄîBy the fourth conference, which took place in Manchester, Vermont, the membership had grown to over 300, with more members outside the New England area than within it. Members at this conference voted to become a national organization called NAGAP‚ÄîNational Association of Graduate Admissions Professionals. -September 1993‚ÄîThe NAGAP Standards for Graduate Admissions Personnel first appeared in the NAGAP Journal; they were voted by acclamation at the 1994 conference and still guide the organization's professional practices today. -June 1993‚ÄîThe first annual Calendar of Graduate and Professional School Fairs was distributed in paper form to all NAGAP members. -Summer 1994‚ÄîNAGAP developed and administered its first biannual salary and membership survey. -Summer 1995‚ÄîFirst Professional Development Workshop for new admissions personnel was held with approximately 40 new admissions professionals in attendance. -Winter 1996‚ÄîNAGAP introduced a Listserv and a Web site for member use. -April 1996‚ÄîThe 10th anniversary was celebrated at the conference in Orlando.

VPD has four main components: *virtual product design (3D shape, 2D graphics/copy) *virtual product simulation (drop test, crush test, etc.) *virtual product staging (retail space planning, consumer research and behavior analysis) *digital manufacturing (process planning, assembly/filling virtualization, plant design). VPD typically takes place in a collaborative, web-based environment that brings together designers, customers/consumers, and value chain partners around a single source of real-time product \\"truth\\". VPD enables practitioners to arrive at the right idea more quickly, and to accurately predict its performance in both manufacturing and retail settings, ultimately minimizing time to value, market failure potential, and product development costs. Virtual process planning is a relatively new concept for manufacturing companies, although the concept has been in use for the construction industry for several years. BIM (building information modeling) is the system used by many construction, architectural and contracting firms. The detail and scheduling aspects are some of the more valuable aspects of the system. By utilizing virtual process planning, the entire production process can be designed to both maximize efficiency and avoid the trial and error method employed by most manufacturers. Various software exists with differing levels of information. The placement of work stations, inventory, personnel and equipment can be valuable for space planning. The interaction of the previously mentioned can also be investigated, allowing the user to identify potential issues from safety, quality and ergonomic standpoints. Virtual Product Development, VPD, is a result of constant efforts in a direction to overcome the limitations of conventional testing procedures. VPD allows a designer to take important design decisions at early stages based on test results, giving control over cost. ‚ÄòVirtual product development‚Äô is a strategy for coordinating technology, processes and people to enhance the established product development process. It is a gradual process that efficiently builds up a product virtually. Thus any changes to be made in its design can be reflected into its physical properties, supply chain, distribution channel and ultimately into the customer view; without physically manufacturing the product. VPD encompasses a wide variety of software tools to cover a product from the conception to the final design and even manufacturing. This path consists of various processes to be carried out at manufacturing level, testing procedures and the final design which is modified automatically based on the test results. One of the major advantages of VPD is its computer brain capability, which can simulate various complex load conditions at a time. Non- linear load conditions are not always possible to create at the testing centre where the prototypes are being tested in conventional testing methods. These complex conditions, if accommodated in the testing, can yield more reliable product form.

Life Boberina Ballerina was born in Parma. Many biographies say she was born in 1721. Recent research by Andrea Perego sourced the Parma baptismal register showing that she was actually born 27 September 1719.Andrea Perego, Barbara ‚Äì Un affare di Stato. Published by Supernova 2020 She became a student at Teatro Farnese under the instruction of Antonio Rinaldi Fossano, with whom she gave her debut at the Paris Opera in 1739, which became an immediate success. In 1740, she became well known for her talent not only as a dancer but also as an actress. People began to call her La Barbarina or \\"The Flying Goddess\\" because of her impeccable execution of entrechats. She is sometimes thought to be the reason for the early retirement of Marie Sall√©. After a tour in London she performed in Vienna before she returned to Paris in 1743. Germany She was noted by the young Prussian king Frederick the Great, who offered her a position at the newly erected Court Opera in Berlin, where she performed from 1744 onwards. She appeared in her first performance there on 13 May 1744. Before she arrived, however, she had eloped her contract to Venice with her lover James Stuart-Mackenzie, and King Frederick used political pressure arresting a Venetian envoy to have her turned over to Prussia. Jean-Jacques Rousseau who was a secretary at the French embassy at that time, was involved with her case. In Berlin, she had a privileged position, demonstrated by the fact that she negotiated her own annual salary of 7,000 Reichsthaler, which was unusually high, and five months vacation a year. The king granted her these terms as long as she stayed unmarried. There were speculations that she had an affair with King Frederick (though the king was reputed to be misogynic), as well as many other persons. She broke her contract suddenly by accepting a proposal by Carl Ludwig von Cocceji, son of the Prussian chancellor Samuel von Cocceji, onstage in 1749, causing a veritable scandal. Her fianc√© went to prison, Campanini herself once again eloped to London, but returned to Berlin and secretly married Cocceji. Her spouse was finally pardoned by the king and appointed district governor at Glogau in Silesia, where the couple lived until they were divorced in 1788. The king granted her the title of Countess von Barschau. During her last years, she was active within charity. Barbara Campanini died on her 80th birthday at her country estate in Barschau near L√ºben, Silesia. She donated her money by will to a foundation for poor noblewomen, which lasted until World War I.

A color space is a specific organization of colors. In combination with color profiling supported by various physical devices, and supports reproducible representations of color -- whether such representation entails an analog or a digital representation. A color space may be arbitrary, i.e. with physically realised colors assigned to a set of physical color swatches with corresponding assigned color names (including discrete numbers) in -- for example -- the Pantone collection), or structured with mathematical rigor (as with the NCS System, Adobe RGB and sRGB). A \\"color model\\" is an abstract mathematical model describing the way colors can be represented as tuples of numbers (e.g. triples in RGB or quadruples in CMYK); however, a color model with no associated mapping function to an absolute color space is a more or less arbitrary color system with no connection to any globally understood system of color interpretation. Adding a specific mapping function between a color model and a reference color space establishes within the reference color space a definite \\"footprint\\", known as a gamut, and for a given color model this defines a color space. For example, Adobe RGB and sRGB are two different absolute color spaces, both based on the RGB color model. When defining a color space, the usual reference standard is the CIELAB or CIEXYZ color spaces, which were specifically designed to encompass all colors the average human can see. Since \\"color space\\" identifies a particular combination of the color model and the mapping function, the word is often used informally to identify a color model. However, even though identifying a color space automatically identifies the associated color model, this usage is incorrect in a strict sense. For example, although several specific color spaces are based on the RGB color model, there is no such thing as the singular RGB color space. History Thomas Young and Hermann Helmholtz assumed that the eye's retina consists of three different kinds of light receptors for red, green and blue In 1802, Thomas Young postulated the existence of three types of photoreceptors (now known as cone cells) in the eye, each of which was sensitive to a particular range of visible light. Hermann von Helmholtz developed the Young‚ÄìHelmholtz theory further in 1850: that the three types of cone photoreceptors could be classified as short- preferring (blue), middle-preferring (green), and long-preferring (red), according to their response to the wavelengths of light striking the retina. The relative strengths of the signals detected by the three types of cones are interpreted by the brain as a visible color. But it's not clear that they thought of colors as being points in color space. The color-space concept was likely due to Hermann Grassmann, who developed it in two stages. First, he developed the idea of vector space, which allowed the algebraic representation of geometric concepts in n-dimensional space.Hermann Grassmann and the Creation of Linear Algebra Fearnley-Sander (1979) describes Grassmann's foundation of linear algebra as follows: With this conceptual background, in 1853, Grassmann published a theory of how colors mix; it and its three color laws are still taught, as Grassmann's law. Examples A comparison of CMYK and RGB color models. This image demonstrates the difference between how colors will look on a computer monitor (RGB) compared to how they will reproduce in a CMYK print process. Colors can be created in printing with color spaces based on the CMYK color model, using the subtractive primary colors of pigment (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black). To create a three- dimensional representation of a given color space, we can assign the amount of magenta color to the representation's X axis, the amount of cyan to its Y axis, and the amount of yellow to its Z axis. The resulting 3-D space provides a unique position for every possible color that can be created by combining those three pigments. Colors can be created on computer monitors with color spaces based on the RGB color model, using the additive primary colors (red, green, and blue). A three-dimensional representation would assign each of the three colors to the X, Y, and Z axes. Note that colors generated on given monitor will be limited by the reproduction medium, such as the phosphor (in a CRT monitor) or filters and backlight (LCD monitor). Another way of creating colors on a monitor is with an HSL or HSV color space, based on hue, saturation, brightness (value/brightness). With such a space, the variables are assigned to cylindrical coordinates. Many color spaces can be represented as three-dimensional values in this manner, but some have more, or fewer dimensions, and some, such as Pantone, cannot be represented in this way at all. Conversion Color space conversion is the translation of the representation of a color from one basis to another. This typically occurs in the context of converting an image that is represented in one color space to another color space, the goal being to make the translated image look as similar as possible to the original. RGB density The RGB color model is implemented in different ways, depending on the capabilities of the system used. By far the most common general-used incarnation is the 24-bit implementation, with 8 bits, or 256 discrete levels of color per channel. Any color space based on such a 24-bit RGB model is thus limited to a range of 256√ó256√ó256 ‚âà 16.7 million colors. Some implementations use 16 bits per component for 48 bits total, resulting in the same gamut with a larger number of distinct colors. This is especially important when working with wide-gamut color spaces (where most of the more common colors are located relatively close together), or when a large number of digital filtering algorithms are used consecutively. The same principle applies for any color space based on the same color model, but implemented in different bit depths. Lists CIE 1931 XYZ color space was one of the first attempts to produce a color space based on measurements of human color perception (earlier efforts were by James Clerk Maxwell, K√∂nig & Dieterici, and Abney at Imperial College)William David Wright, 50 years of the 1931 CIE Standard Observer. Die Farbe, 29:4/6 (1981). and it is the basis for almost all other color spaces. The CIERGB color space is a linearly-related companion of CIE XYZ. Additional derivatives of CIE XYZ include the CIELUV, CIEUVW, and CIELAB. Generic Additive color mixing: Three overlapping light bulbs in a vacuum, adding together to create white. Subtractive color mixing: Three splotches of paint on white paper, subtracting together to turn the paper black. RGB uses additive color mixing, because it describes what kind of light needs to be emitted to produce a given color. RGB stores individual values for red, green and blue. RGBA is RGB with an additional channel, alpha, to indicate transparency. Common color spaces based on the RGB model include sRGB, Adobe RGB, ProPhoto RGB, scRGB, and CIE RGB. CMYK uses subtractive color mixing used in the printing process, because it describes what kind of inks need to be applied so the light reflected from the substrate and through the inks produces a given color. One starts with a white substrate (canvas, page, etc.), and uses ink to subtract color from white to create an image. CMYK stores ink values for cyan, magenta, yellow and black. There are many CMYK color spaces for different sets of inks, substrates, and press characteristics (which change the dot gain or transfer function for each ink and thus change the appearance). YIQ was formerly used in NTSC (North America, Japan and elsewhere) television broadcasts for historical reasons. This system stores a luma value roughly analogous to (and sometimes incorrectly identified as)Charles Poynton, \\"YUV and 'luminance' considered harmful: a plea for precise terminology in video,\\" online, author-edited version of Appendix A of Charles Poynton, Digital Video and HDTV: Algorithms and Interfaces, Morgan‚ÄìKaufmann, 2003. onlineCharles Poynton, Constant Luminance, 2004 luminance, along with two chroma values as approximate representations of the relative amounts of blue and red in the color. It is similar to the YUV scheme used in most video capture systems and in PAL (Australia, Europe, except France, which uses SECAM) television, except that the YIQ color space is rotated 33¬∞ with respect to the YUV color space and the color axes are swapped. The YDbDr scheme used by SECAM television is rotated in another way. YPbPr is a scaled version of YUV. It is most commonly seen in its digital form, YCbCr, used widely in video and image compression schemes such as MPEG and JPEG. xvYCC is a new international digital video color space standard published by the IEC (IEC 61966-2-4). It is based on the ITU BT.601 and BT.709 standards but extends the gamut beyond the R/G/B primaries specified in those standards. HSV (hue, saturation, value), also known as HSB (hue, saturation, brightness) is often used by artists because it is often more natural to think about a color in terms of hue and saturation than in terms of additive or subtractive color components. HSV is a transformation of an RGB color space, and its components and colorimetry are relative to the RGB color space from which it was derived. HSL (hue, saturation, lightness/luminance), also known as HLS or HSI (hue, saturation, intensity) is quite similar to HSV, with \\"lightness\\" replacing \\"brightness\\". The difference is that the brightness of a pure color is equal to the brightness of white, while the lightness of a pure color is equal to the lightness of a medium gray.

Obsolete Early color spaces had two components. They largely ignored blue light because the added complexity of a 3-component process provided only a marginal increase in fidelity when compared to the jump from monochrome to 2-component color. * RG for early Technicolor film * RGK for early color printing Absolute color space In color science, there are two meanings of the term absolute color space: * A color space in which the perceptual difference between colors is directly related to distances between colors as represented by points in the color space. * A color space in which colors are unambiguous, that is, where the interpretations of colors in the space are colorimetrically defined without reference to external factors. In this article, we concentrate on the second definition. CIEXYZ, sRGB, and ICtCp are examples of absolute color spaces, as opposed to a generic RGB color space. A non-absolute color space can be made absolute by defining its relationship to absolute colorimetric quantities. For instance, if the red, green, and blue colors in a monitor are measured exactly, together with other properties of the monitor, then RGB values on that monitor can be considered as absolute. The CIE 1976 L*, a*, b* color space is sometimes referred to as absolute, though it also needs a white point specification to make it so. A popular way to make a color space like RGB into an absolute color is to define an ICC profile, which contains the attributes of the RGB. This is not the only way to express an absolute color, but it is the standard in many industries. RGB colors defined by widely accepted profiles include sRGB and Adobe RGB. The process of adding an ICC profile to a graphic or document is sometimes called tagging or embedding; tagging therefore marks the absolute meaning of colors in that graphic or document. Conversion A color in one absolute color space can be converted into another absolute color space, and back again, in general; however, some color spaces may have gamut limitations, and converting colors that lie outside that gamut will not produce correct results. There are also likely to be rounding errors, especially if the popular range of only 256 distinct values per component (8-bit color) is used. One part of the definition of an absolute color space is the viewing conditions. The same color, viewed under different natural or artificial lighting conditions, will look different. Those involved professionally with color matching may use viewing rooms, lit by standardized lighting. Occasionally, there are precise rules for converting between non-absolute color spaces. For example, HSL and HSV spaces are defined as mappings of RGB. Both are non-absolute, but the conversion between them should maintain the same color. However, in general, converting between two non-absolute color spaces (for example, RGB to CMYK) or between absolute and non-absolute color spaces (for example, RGB to L*a*b*) is almost a meaningless concept. Arbitrary spaces A different method of defining absolute color spaces is familiar to many consumers as the swatch card, used to select paint, fabrics, and the like. This is a way of agreeing a color between two parties. A more standardized method of defining absolute colors is the Pantone Matching System, a proprietary system that includes swatch cards and recipes that commercial printers can use to make inks that are a particular color.

Originally the plan had been to build a station at Husbands Bosworth but due to objections it was situated a couple of miles westward near the village of North Kilworth. Originally, the station was named \\"Welford\\" after the larger village of that name two and a half miles further south. Later the name \\"Lutterworth\\" was added in an attempt to attract custom from that town even though it was some six miles from the station. The original station was built - as was normal at that time - at ground level. Later, when a platform was added the building's windowsill facing the platform was at ankle level. This original building was of brick, but a variety of additions and extensions in different materials and styles were added over the years. A cottage was built on the opposite side of the line near to the road crossing and the box. Consequently, the signal box had to be high enough to give a view over it. There were two sidings on the up side behind the station building, with a loading dock and goods shed, and, in the opposite direction, beside the up line there were two long sidings. On the other side of the road crossing towards Stamford a further siding catered for a dairy. A milk train would arrive from Rugby at about 3.30 in the morning, returning empty at 5.00 a.m. Welford also proved handy for parking defective wagons.Preston Hendry, R., Powell Hendry, R., (1982) An historical survey of selected LMS stations : layouts and illustrations.

The press focuses on publishing books concerning the mind, the body and the spirit. The company was established in 1977 by authors Marc Allen and Shakti Gawain under the name Whatever Publishing. Total sales in 1977 were $800. The fledgling firm's first three books were written by Marc Allen; the fourth book they published, Shakti Gawain's Creative Visualization, released in December 1978, became an international bestseller, under the guidance of Sky Canyon (aka Jon Bernoff), who was President and Publisher from 1979 through 1986, selling over 3 million copies in North America to date, and another 3 million copies worldwide. The success of Shakti's book launched the new company as a source of books for the creative and New Age communities. The company's name changed from Whatever Publishing to New World Library in the mid-1980. New World Library is located in Novato, California and has 18 employees. In 2000, New World Library entered into a joint venture with H J Kramer, the publisher of Dan Millman, Sanaya Roman, and John Robbins's seminal Diet for a New America. In 2001, New World Library began publishing the works of Joseph Campbell. As of 2019, there are 18 books in the series, including a revised edition of The Hero with a Thousand Faces, which has sold over half a million copies. In 2007, New World Library acquired Inner Ocean Publishing, involving the purchase of 45 titles, including books by MoveOn, Jean Houston, and Barbara Marciniak. New World Library has worked with distributor Publishers Group West (PGW) since 1978 which makes it PGW's oldest distribution client.  Publications  New World Library publishes books in subjects such as animals, business, Celtic studies, children's books, current affairs, health, literature and writing, mythology, Native American studies, personal growth, photography, psychology, relationships, religion, Spanish language, women's studies and yoga. It has published a number of bestselling titles, including The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle (a New York Times bestseller for 100 weeks), The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success by Deepak Chopra, Way of the Peaceful Warrior by Dan Millman (through its H J Kramer imprint) and the Collected Works of Joseph Campbell series, including the acclaimed 2008 edition of Campbell's classic The Hero with a Thousand Faces.

An expert on water treatment and corrosion, Edwards's research on elevated lead levels in Washington, DC's municipal water supply gained national attention, changed the city's recommendations on water use in homes with lead service pipes, and caused the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to admit to publishing a report so rife with errors that a congressional investigation called it \\"scientifically indefensible\\". He is considered one of the world's leading experts in water corrosion in home plumbing, and a nationally recognized expert on copper corrosion. He is also one of the whistleblowers in the Flint water crisis, along with Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha. Edwards was named a MacArthur Fellow in 2007. The program cited him for \\"playing a vital role in ensuring the safety of drinking water and in exposing deteriorating water-delivery infrastructure in America‚Äôs largest cities\\". In 2004, Time magazine featured him as one of the United States' most innovative scientists. Biography Edwards, a native of the Buffalo, New York area, received a Bachelor of Science degree in biophysics from the State University of New York at Buffalo in 1986. He received his Master of Science in 1988 and his Ph.D. in engineering in 1991 from the University of Washington. Edwards taught at the University of Colorado at Boulder. In 1997, he joined the faculty of Virginia Tech's department of civil and environmental engineering. From 2001 to 2005, he served as president of the board of directors for the Association of Environmental Engineering and Science Professors. He delivered Virginia Tech's Graduate School Commencement address on December 19, 2008. He lives with his wife Jui-Ling and two children Ethan and Ailene in Blacksburg, Virginia. (2003 - 2010) Lead levels in Washington, DC water supply Edwards's research in the mid-1990s focused on an increasing incidence of pinhole leaks in copper water pipes. Homeowners contacted him about the leaks, some of which were occurring 18 months after installation. After a century of using copper for water pipes, the expectation is that they will last for 50 years in residential applications. The District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority (WASA) funded Edwards's research into the cause of the leaks. A group of Washington, DC homeowners asked Edwards to investigate their corroding copper pipes in March 2003. Suspecting the water, he tested for lead. The accepted limit for lead in drinking water is 15 parts per billion (ppb). Edwards's meter, which could read values up to 140 ppb, showed off-the-scale readings even after he had diluted the sample to ten percent of its original strength. The water contained at least 1,250 ppb of lead. \\"Some of it would literally have to be classified as a hazardous waste\\", he said. At the time, WASA recommended that customers in areas served by lead pipes allow the water to run for 30 seconds to one minute as a precaution. Edwards's tests showed that the highest lead levels occurred 30 seconds to a few minutes after the tap was opened. When Edwards brought his concerns to WASA, the agency threatened to withhold future monitoring data and research funding from him unless he stopped working with the homeowners. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) discontinued its subcontract with him. With his funding cut off, Edwards paid his engineering students out of his own pocket so that they could continue the research. After the Washington Post ran front-page stories in January 2004 about the problem, a Congressional hearing was held in March 2004 where Edwards testified. At the hearing, Edwards identified the cause of the readings as monochloramine, a disinfecting chemical that had replaced chlorine in the water supply in March 2000. Chloramine-treated water, he said, picks up lead from pipes and solder and does not release it, resulting in elevated levels. Chloramine also doesn't break down over time, as chlorine does, so there is always some in the water system. Edwards also testified that WASA's attempts to replace lead pipes with copper pipes could exacerbate the problem, because the copper increases corrosion of the old lead. Following the discontinuation of chloramine treatment in 2004, Edwards and his colleagues continued to study the long-term effects of the elevated water lead levels; their article \\"Elevated Blood Lead in Young Children Due to Lead-Contaminated Drinking Water\\", published in the journal Environmental Science and Technology, won that publication's Editor's Choice Award for the best science paper of 2009. Referring to a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that essentially dismissed the idea of health risks from DC's lead-contaminated water, Edwards wrote to James Stephens, the CDC's associate director of science: \\"Why is it that every child I have personal knowledge of, who had a strong chance of having elevated blood lead from water, is either deleted or otherwise misrepresented in the data that CDC has and used for this publication?\\" Edwards did not receive a response until March 2008, when Stephens wrote \\"We have examined CDC's role in the study and have found no evidence of misconduct.\\" As a result of Edwards's research, the United States House of Representatives' science and technology subcommittee conducted a congressional investigation into the matter. They concluded that the CDC made \\"scientifically indefensible\\" claims that the lead levels in DC were not harmful, knowingly using flawed data. In the wake of the investigation, Edwards called for the CDC paper's senior author to resign. The day after the House report was released, the CDC released a public statement admitting to their errors. James Elder, former national director of groundwater and drinking water for the EPA, said \\"Had Edwards not gotten involved, this would never have come out\\". In 2010, the CDC said that 15,000 homes in the DC area might still have water supplies with dangerous levels of lead. Following Edwards's recommendation, the DC water authority now warns homeowners with lead water-supply lines to let the tap run for ten minutes before drinking or cooking. During his work on the Washington water quality, said Bill Knocke, head of Virginia Tech's civil and environmental engineering department, Edwards was so concerned about the public health impact that he was hospitalized due to the stress.  (2004-2014) Notable Projects  In 2006, Edwards suggested that the EPA testing procedure for lead in tap water could miss elevated levels because it called for homeowners to remove the aerator from their faucet before drawing water for testing. The screen in the aerator, he said, could trap lead particles; if so, water drawn for testing would not reflect the full lead exposure experienced by people drinking from the faucet under normal use. In 2007, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill hired Edwards to investigate water-quality problems in three buildings. (When UNC asked its engineering faculty for guidance, their response was \\"We have two words for you‚ÄîMarc Edwards.\\") He found \\"low-grade and fixable\\" lead contamination, which he blamed on \\"lead-free\\" brass plumbing fixtures. According to Edwards, Federal regulations permit up to 8 percent lead in \\"lead-free\\" brass fixtures, which can leach from the fixtures if the water is corrosive. He says that the Federal standard uses a water formulation that is remarkably tame compared to actual water supplies, allowing such fixtures to pass lead-leaching tests. Edwards provided a solution to UNC's problem: Accelerate the leaching of the lead by running each faucet at full flow for ten minutes, and then leaving it open at a trickle for three days, after which most of the lead had leached out. In a 2008 radio interview, Edwards noted that the United States has over five million lead water pipes, many of which are nearing the end of their useful life. \\"In some cases, you can take a single glass of water,\\" he said, \\"and if you're unlucky, and it has that piece of lead in it, you can get a very high dose of lead, similar to that which you could obtain by eating lead paint chips.\\" During the Society of Environmental Journalists' 2008 annual meeting, the group was given a tour of Edwards's lab. He told them that the number one cause of waterborne disease outbreaks in the United States is pathogens growing in home water heaters. Energy-conscious households may set their water heater's thermostat to , but that temperature encourages the growth of microbes such as mycobacteria. A setting of would kill such organisms. Edwards says that infections from inhaling steam from contaminated water in the shower, or contact with contaminated water in a hot tub, kill an estimated 3,000 to 12,000 Americans each year. Responding to a 2009 Associated Press investigation of contaminants found in the drinking water of schools across the United States, Edwards was quoted as saying \\"If a landlord doesn't tell a tenant about lead paint in an apartment, he can go to jail. But we have no system to make people follow the rules to keep school children safe?\\" Edwards has also warned about the unintended effects of state- of-the-art water conservation techniques being used in new buildings. Systems such as rainwater capture and water recycling, he says, may reduce the flow of water from the city's system so much that the water remains in the plumbing for as much as three weeks before use. This can cause the water to pick up lead and grow bacteria. He has called for a more holistic approach to water quality monitoring. In 2011, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Public Health Law Research Program funded a $450,000 study of the 1991 Lead and Copper Rule, an EPA regulation relating to drinking water. Edwards will spearhead the study.  (2015 - present) Flint water crisis  In September, 2015, after receiving a call from Flint, Michigan citizen, LeeAnne Walters, Edwards formed a water study team and traveled to Flint, Michigan to perform a study that uncovered high levels of lead in potable water. The city's water source had been switched from the Detroit water system to the Flint River in 2014, exposing over 100,000 people to high lead levels and affecting up to 12,000 people with lead poisoning.Steve Carmody, Virginia Tech ending Flint water investigation, Michigan Radio (January 11, 2016). Edwards' initiative inspired Mona Hanna-Attisha, a Flint public health advocate and pediatrician, to perform her own study on Flint‚Äôs children that found that the lead levels in their blood increased as a result of the water source switch. Edwards and Hanna-Attisha's results caused the City of Flint, the State of Michigan and the United States to declare a state of emergency. In early 2016, Edwards testified twice before the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on the crisis,Former EM removed from witness list for Congressional hearing on Flint water The Flint Journal via MLive, February 2, 2016Ex-EPA official defends agency‚Äôs work in Flint water crisis at Capitol Hill hearing MSN, March 15, 2016 and was appointed to Michigan Governor Rick Snyder's Flint Water Interagency Coordinating Committee, to alleviate problems related to the water crisis.Ron Fonger, Gov. Snyder signs executive order to create new Flint water committee, The Flint Journal via MLive (January 11, 2016). In 2016, Edwards gave an interview to The Chronicle of Higher Education arguing for scientists to work in the public interest. In July 2018, Edwards filed a $3 million defamation lawsuit against Flint mother Melissa Mays and two other activists Paul Schwartz and Yanna Lambrinidou. The lawsuit came in the wake of the Flintcomplaints.com letter, signed by over 60 Flint residents, expressing certain grievances with Edwards. On March 19, 2019, the case was dismissed by Judge Michael F.

As a producer, he worked on projects for artists as diverse as Dutch Mason, Raffi, Lillian Allen and the Downchild Blues Band. He was born in Montreal, but spent most of his adult life in Toronto, and was particularly supportive of world music as both a promoter and publicist, focusing on bringing Caribbean, Cuban and Latin American music to a wider audience.  Career  Bryans' childhood was spent in Pointe-Claire, Quebec, where he was associated with his first professional band, M.G. and The Escorts. This band released three singles, and primarily played in the area bounded by Montreal, Ottawa, Brockville and Kingston, including gigs at Expo 67 and as the opening act at a Montreal concert by The Beach Boys. Bryans was also a high school friend of Jack Layton, and was credited by Layton with giving him the advice that led to his successfully being elected president of their high school student council. After graduating with a degree in English literature from Sir George Williams University,\\"Billy Bryans‚Äô eclectic musical tastes took him far\\". The Globe and Mail, April 23, 2012. Bryans moved from Montreal to Toronto with his group Theodore's Smokeshop in 1970, and soon developed a reputation as a musician, engineer and record producer in the burgeoning counterculture scene around Rochdale College. He quickly became associated with the Downchild Blues Band, including as producer of the band's first notable hit single, \\"Flip, Flop and Fly\\", and as the engineer on the band's seminal debut album, Bootleg (1971), thought to be the first artist-produced and independently distributed album in Canadian history. In 1972, Theodore's Smokeshop, now renamed Horn, recorded its only album, On the People's Side, with Bryans performing as percussionist, sound remixer and co-producer.Horn was composed of Bryans on drums, with Les Clackett (vocals), Bruce Barron (guitar), Alan Duffy (bass), Gary Hynes (guitar), Wayne Jackson (trumpet) and David De Launey (keyboards). Both Bryans and Jackson would later become members of The Downchild Blues Band, with Bryans also acting as Downchild's producer. See Vernon Joynson, Dreams, Nightmares & Fantasies (Canada) for band membership and discography. During the 1970s, Bryans continued to develop his reputation as a musician, engineer and producer, working on records by the Time Twins, The BobCats and the Downchild Blues Band. Daniel Lanois credited Bryans' sonic experimentation as one of the inspirations behind the development of his own distinctive production style. In 1979, he was introduced to Lorraine Segato, who was then the lead singer and a principal songwriter with Mama Quilla II. The two have collaborated musically since that time. Their first collaboration was the band V, playing a mix of funk, soca and reggae music with Mojah, then the lead singer of the Toronto reggae band Truth and Rights. Bryans also sometimes performed with Mama Quilla II; as the only man performing with an otherwise all-female band, his bandmates jokingly gave him a T-shirt which read \\"Token Male\\". The next collaboration of Bryans and Segato was The Parachute Club. Prior to that time, Bryans was the drummer for the Toronto new wave and art punk band The Government, while Segato continued her association with Mama Quilla II. The Parachute Club was formed in the summer of 1982, in response to an invitation to Bryans to play at a party at the Toronto International Film Festival. Based on the performance invitation, Bryans and Segato formed a band which ultimately became The Parachute Club. While working with Parachute Club, Bryans also continued to work as a producer, most notably on Lillian Allen's Juno Award winning reggae albums Revolutionary Tea Party and Conditions Critical. In 1987, he also recorded a rearrangement of Moe Koffman's \\"Curried Soul\\", which CBC Radio One continues to use to this day as the introductory music to the second half-hour of its nightly news program As It Happens.As It Happens, April 23, 2012. Following Parachute Club's breakup, Bryans continued to work as a producer for artists such as AfroNubians, Raffi and Punjabi by Nature, as well as doing session work for musicians such as George Fox, Loketo and Buffy Sainte-Marie. In 1989, Bryans and Aaron Davis received a Genie Award nomination for Best Original Score for their work on George Mihalka's film Office Party.\\"Cronenberg film earns a dozen nominations: Dead Ringers tops Genie list\\". The Globe and Mail, February 14, 1989. In 1991, he coordinated a concert series for world beat musicians at Ontario Place\\"Music fest celebrates multiculturalism\\". Toronto Star, June 24, 1991. and produced The Gathering, a compilation album of Canadian world music artists which won the inaugural Juno Award for World Music Album of the Year at the Juno Awards of 1992. In 1997, Bryans was one of the producers and mixers associated with the film soundtrack to the Disney movie Jungle 2 Jungle, which featured much African music. In the 2000s, he focused extensively on promoting Latin music in Canada, playing a prominent role in the emergence of artists such as Laura Fernandez, Aline Morales and Alex Cuba. In 2006, Bryans announced that he was suffering from lung cancer, and was incapacitated for a period of months, commencing in April of that year. In August 2006, in celebration of his recovery, a number of notable Toronto musicians performed a benefit in Bryans' honour. In early 2012, it was announced that Bryans' cancer had returned and he was in palliative care. Another benefit concert was held on April 19 at Toronto's Lula Lounge to help defray his healthcare costs. He died a few days later in Toronto, on April 23, at age 64.

A Fourier domain mode locked laser consists of a ring cavity of length L with tunable optical bandpass filter and gain element. For FDML operation, the filter tuning frequency f needs to match the inverse cavity roundtrip time 1/\\\\tau = c/n*L or a i-th harmonic thereof, :f_i=i\\\\frac{c}{n*L}, with the group speed of light c/n in the fiber cavity (dependent on the refractive index n). A basic FDML laser configuration - as shown in the figure - consists of a: * semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) as gain medium * fiber Fabry Perot tunable filter (FFP-TF) as bandpass filter * polarization controller (PC) to optimize the polarization for the SOA * delay fiber (DELAY) to meet the requirement that the roundtrip time is a multiple of the inverse filter tuning frequency * fiber coupler (FC) to couple out a fraction of the light power * isolator (ISO) A main application for FDML lasers is optical coherence tomography. Essentially, the swept light of an FDML lasers can be viewed analogous to a strongly chirped mode-locked laser pulse. Hence, it was also studied how the swept light field of an FDML laser can be compressed to generate short pulses of 60 picoseconds duration. Furthermore, the work suggests that FDML lasers could overcome the limitations of conventional pulsed laser operation. Here, the energy of the light field is optically stored in the delay fiber, enabling high energy pulses to be produced directly with a low-power semiconductor laser. Shorter pulses in the femtosecond regime might be possible in the future. Recently, the fast and spectrally broad wavelength sweeps of FDML lasers were used for stimulated Raman spectroscopy (SRS) and hyperspectral microscopy. In SRS, the energy difference between two lasers is used to excite a Raman scattering mode. In this new technique, called Time-Encoded (TICO) Raman, the fast sweeping rate of the FDML laser enables a fast coverage of a broad spectral range of Raman transitions.

The line was advocated by the group Citizens for the Train. Grant money needed to fund a feasibility study was not successfully obtained. Since 2014, there have been no plans to move forward with the project. Planning Citizens for the Train spearheaded the Greenline's planning stages, and concluded a preliminary study (performed by engineering firm Gannett Fleming Inc.) to determine the feasibility of the project. The group compiled $250,000 for an alternative analysis to see if a different transportation project, such as widening roads or adding bus routes, would work better. The study was slated for completion by the end of 2009.philadelphia.bizjournals.com; Retrieved March 2, 2009 Citizens for the Train pursued an estimated $1.5 million for an environmental and engineering study. Funding for the project was sought from both public and private sources. Due to the ill-fated $2 billion Schuylkill Valley Metro (SVM) project, the Greenline proposal received support from regional politicians and businesses. The Greenline remains part of the Chester County Transportation Improvements Inventory (TII) document for 2009-2010. No funding has been allocated for design or construction. Route The proposed route was to originate in Oaks, Pennsylvania, with the Oaks terminal situated at the new Greater Philadelphia Expo Center At Oaks. The route would utilize Norfolk Southern Railway's (NS) out of service and derelict 11-mile Phoenixville Industrial Track (former Pennsylvania Railroad Frazer Branch), with an additional seven miles of new railway construction built between end- of-track in Devault (where trains will be stored) and the current Amtrak/SEPTA Paoli Station. The bulk of the route is the Phoenixville Industrial Track. Never a prominent line, the route gained momentum in its later years. With aid from PennDOT, the single-track line received a substantial infrastructure upgrade via Conrail in the late 1980s. New wooden ties were laid, new ballast was added and drainage was significantly improved. In addition, grade crossings received additional protective hardware, including flashers bells and gates. However over time industries along the line either closed or switched to trucks. Freight service continued through 2004, when the last customer American Sweetener Corporation, whose plant was located at the end of the line in Devault, closed its doors. NS applied to officially discontinue rail service on the line in October 2007, which became effective that December. The route transverses the Pickering Valley region, terminating at SEPTA's heavily used Paoli/Thorndale Line of commuter rail. Paoli Station also hosts Amtrak's Keystone Service and Pennsylvanian, serving trains en route to Harrisburg, Pittsburgh and New York City. Equipment Diesel-electric diesel multiple unit cars currently used on New Jersey Transit's River LINE were considered for the Greenline Diesel-electric DMUs Several options for train equipment were being considered. One is the Stadler GTW-built diesel- electric DMU (diesel multiple unit) cars used on New Jersey Transit's River LINE. Equipment was to be stored at the unused depot in Devault; these tracks were previously used by the Maslo paper company.Maslo Paper Company Refurbished RDC unit currently operating on Cape May Seashore Lines in Cape May, New Jersey The RiverLINE's unique rail cars offer a tighter turning radius than typical main line light rail vehicles, and thus are capable of the street running needed on Morehall Road. The rail cars are also used regularly in Italy, the Netherlands and Switzerland. RDCs Another less expensive option was refurbished Budd Rail Diesel Cars, which last carried passengers through Phoenixville in July 1981 when SEPTA terminated all diesel trains between Pottsville and Philadelphia.

It was an easy answer: Deloss Walker, a political public relations genius who lived in Memphis, Tenn. His track record for electing governors of southern states was 5‚Äì0. The scenario was the same for all five upset victories. He took an obscure, unknown candidate and elected him governor over a well-known incumbent or favorite. He had just taken an unknown school board member named Dale Bumpers and made him Governor of Arkansas. Deloss Walker was the most renowned and expensive political guru in the country in 1977.\\"\\"The 1978 Governor‚Äôs Race was Certainly One for the Record Books\\" Steve Flowers, October 2006 In his 1998 autobiography Joe Frank Harris, Personal Reflections on a Public Life, the former Governor of Georgia recalls the hiring of Deloss Walker and Walker + Associates to run his campaign in 1982: \\"The broadcast and newspaper media are, of course, a potent force, and if you can gain access to them effectively and with enough repetition, you can move name identification along very quickly. We were able to do that with the assistance of Deloss Walker and Walker and Associates, a public relations group from Memphis, Tennessee whom I had met though a mutual friend‚Ä¶At the time we signed on Deloss had handled some fifty political campaigns and had won all but two of them.\\"Joe Frank Harris, Personal Reflections on a Public Life, Mercer University Press, 1998.

It was the successor to the radio and television program Smilin' Ed McConnell and His Buster Brown Gang (later shortened to Smilin' Ed's Gang). Devine took over the television program when McConnell died suddenly of a heart attack in 1954. Devine inherited a number of characters from the earlier show and the sponsor, Buster Brown shoes. Cast The cast of the program included: *Andy Devine *Nino Marcel as Gunga Ram *June Foray as the voice of Midnight the Cat and Old Grandie, the witch *Billy Gilbert as the teacher *Lou Krugman as the Maharajah *Jerry Maren as Buster Brown *Alan Reed as the poet *Vito Scotti as Pasta Fazooli and Rama *Bud Tollefson as the voice of Tige, the dog Smilin' Ed McConnell Smilin' Ed McConnell and his Buster Brown Gang was one of the first children's TV shows filmed in Hollywood. In the original shows, McConnell started the program by greeting the audience‚Äî\\"Hiya, kids\\"‚Äîafter which the audience sang a song for the sponsor, Buster Brown shoes: \\"I got shoes, you got shoes, everybody's got to have shoes, but there's only one kind of shoe for me‚Äîgood old Buster Brown shoes!\\" Then Ed said, \\"Thank you buddies and sweethearts. Good old Buster Brown shoes are on the air out here in Hollywood for another good old Saturday hullabaloo.\\" Produced on a small budget, the show was a success, bringing to life the Buster Brown advertising characters that had existed for decades and helping to sell millions of shoes. The show was initially filmed in front of a live audience, but as McConnell's health deteriorated, prefilmed children's reaction shots were intercut with the studio performance. Music and stories from \\"Smilin' Ed's Storybook\\" were regular features. The show also featured \\"Gunga, the East India Boy,\\" a serial set in India. Led by the Maharajah, Gunga Ram and his pal Rama set out on adventures around the village of Bakore in filmed segments. A popular segment was the visit from the green puppet Froggy the Gremlin, who would appear in a puff of smoke (\\"Hiya, kids! Hiya, hiya, hiya!\\") when McConnell yelled the catchphrase \\"Plunk your magic twanger, Froggy!\\" The same phrase was later used by Andy Devine. Froggy was always interrupting the story and causing trouble. McConnell died of a heart attack in 1954. Andy Devine took over the show in 1955. Andy Devine After McConnell's death, the show was hosted by the rough-voiced, gentle giant Andy Devine, who had earlier appeared as Jingles on The Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok with Guy Madison. Studio reaction shots were again intercut, and Devine did his segments without a live audience. This also allowed some limited special effects, such as when Froggy appeared or disappeared. The show began with Devine sitting in a big easy chair, reading from a book, Andy's Stories,Terrace, Vincent (2008). \\"Andy's Gang\\", Encyclopedia of Television Shows, 1925 through 2010. 2d ed. McFarland. . which were illustrated by film clips. Regular characters were Midnight the Cat, Squeeky the Mouse (portrayed by a hamster), and Grandie the Talking Piano.

In filmed segments, Gunga Ram was an Indian boy played by Nino Marcel. Gunga (Ghanga Rama during Smilin' Ed's tenure) and his friend Rama (Vito Scotti) helped out the Maharajah.

Devine closed with, \\"Yes, sir, we're pals, and pals stick together. And now, gang, don't forget church or Sunday school.\\" Legacy Some of the original filmed programs hosted by Devine have survived, including a few segments filmed in color near the end of the show's run in 1960.

Eisenhower in December 1954 to coordinate the development of the foreign economic policy of the United States. On July 12, 1954 the President's Advisory Committee on Government Organization chairman Nelson Rockefeller and the director of the Bureau of the Budget Rowland Hughes recommended to President Eisenhower that a detailed study be made of the adequacy of executive branch organization for the development and coordination of foreign economic policy. Eisenhower agreed that such a study was needed and ordered them to conduct the study, and to secure a top-notch individual to direct the necessary staff work. The individual selected to make the study was Joseph M. Dodge. Dodge spent the next three months contacting various government agencies and analyzing their roles in the field of foreign economic policy. In his final report to the President, dated November 22, 1954, Dodge recommended the creation of a White House staff organization devoted exclusively to the orderly development of foreign economic policy as the best method of ensuring proper coordination between the various agencies. On December 11, 1954, the President sent a letter to Joseph Dodge which became the authority for the CFEP. Dodge was appointed a Special Assistant to the President and given the responsibility of assuring the effective coordination of foreign economics policy matters among the various executive agencies. The basic members of the CFEP were to be the Secretaries of State, Treasury, Commerce, Agriculture, and the Director of the Foreign Operations Administration. Ex officio members were to be the President‚Äôs Administrative Assistant for Economic Affairs, the President‚Äôs Special Assistant for National Security Affairs, and a member of the Council of Economic Advisers. The first meeting of the CFEP, on December 22, 1954 was basically an organizational meeting to acquaint members with the CFEP and its responsibilities. Policy issues were not discussed in earnest until the second meeting on January 4, 1955. Thereafter the CFEP met on a weekly basis while the most pressing policy problems were debated. Dodge resigned from the CFEP on July 10, 1956, and Clarence B. Randall succeeded Dodge as CFEP chairman.Government Printing Office. U.S. Government Organization Manual. Washington, DC: GPO. Randall was a long-time official of the Inland Steel Company of Chicago, Illinois, and in 1948 served as a steel consultant for the Economic Cooperation Administration in Paris, where he became involved in the planning of Western Europe‚Äôs steel production. In August 1953 President Eisenhower appointed Randall chairman of the President‚Äôs Commission on Foreign Economic Policy (commonly known as the Randall Commission), an ad hoc body created by Congress to study the foreign trade policy of the United States. In addition to resolving policy disputes, the CFEP often conducted detailed studies of various aspects of foreign economic policy. Although this was sometimes done at the CFEP‚Äôs own initiative, the studies were usually made at the request of an executive agency to help the agency formulate policy. Because of its role as a coordinator, the CFEP often acted as a clearinghouse of information on foreign economic policy. One major activity of the CFEP staff was the preparation of a Handbook on Foreign Economic Policy. This was a collection of abstracts of presidential statements and government policy papers which describe the U.S. position on all aspects of foreign economic policy. The Handbook was distributed to many government agencies where it served as a useful reference work in the determination of policy matters. During the last two months of the Eisenhower administration the amount of work of the CFEP decreased as the government prepared for the transition to the Kennedy administration. The last CFEP meeting was held on December 20, 1960. References External links *U.S. Council on Foreign Economic Policy Records, Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library *Papers of Joseph M.

He was a well-known writer in the 1930s, whose writings were influenced by his own teacher and mentor, the American philosopher John Dewey. Like his mentor, Professor Raup is often associated with the pedagogical concept of promoting practical (i.e. pragmatic) judgment as something appropriate and necessary within the context of a modern democratic society. He was best known for his criticism of the American public education system, which he claimed was inadequate and ineffective in its methods. Life R. Bruce Raup was born in Clark County, Ohio to Gustavas Philip and Fanny Mitchell Raup on March 21, 1888. As a young man he attended public school first in Lagonda and later in Springfield, Ohio. He earned a A.B. degree at from Wittenberg College in 1909. After earning a B.D. degree from McCormick Theological Seminary in 1914, he served as minister of the American Presbyterian Church in Havana, Cuba from 1914 to 1915. From 1916 to 1918, Raup was an instructor in ethics and a college professor at Bellevue College in Nebraska. During World War I, he served as a military chaplain in the U.S. Army. From 1919 ro 1921, he was an Asst. Professor of Psychology at Blackburn College in Carlinville, Illinois. In 1921, he entered graduate studies at Teachers College, Columbia University where he was a student of John Dewey. It was there he met and married Clara Eliot on August 23, 1924. Raup earned a Ph.D. from Teachers College in 1926, and remained there until his retirement in 1953. Raup was actively involved in many professional associations, including: the American Philosophical Association, the National Education Association, the National Society of College Teachers of Education, and the Progressive Education Association. He was President of the Philosophy of Education Society in 1941. He also served on the Federal Council of Churches in America‚Äôs Committee on Education and Research. Raup was instrumental in organizing and establishing several of the foundation courses in the Teachers College curriculum, including: Character and Moral Judgment in Education, Education in American Culture, and Education as Personal Development. For his contribution to American educational theory, Raup received the Nicholas Murray Butler Medal in Silver from Columbia University. Robert and Clara Raup had four children: Joan Eliot Raup (b. 1926), Ruth Mitchell Raup (b. 1927), Robert Bruce Raup, Jr. (b. 1929), and Charlotte Cranch Raup (b. 1933). Joan became a noted statistician, and Charlotte married Columbia University historian Lawrence A. Cremin. Raup lived most of his years at Teachers College at his nearby country residence in Kent Cliffs, New York. After he retired in 1953, he moved to Palo Alto, California. He died in Palo Alto on April 13, 1976. He was, at that time, 88 years old. The American botanist, ecologist, and geographer, Hugh M. Raup (1901--1995) was his younger brother.

Early in his life Castillo defined his aspirations to pursue a career in music as his parents had done. He was a childhood friend of Horacio Salinas who also originated from his hometown; who would also go on to join the neo-folkloric New Chilean Song movement that aimed to renovate Chilean folklore. Castillo was educated in Santiago and in 1963 he began to study classical guitar at the National Conservatorium of Music which would later become part of the University of Chile. In 1965 Castillo enters the Faculty of Philosophy and Education of the University of Chile to study humanities with a focus on philosophy. Simultaneously Castillo pursued further studies in the field of classical music and the history of music and art at the Conservatorium of the University. Castillo made numerous recordings with some of the leading folklorists of the New Chilean Song movement which included some of the most influential musicians in Latin America, including V√≠ctor Jara, Los Parras and Los Jaivas.

Ten days later, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission amended its complaint to accuse Stanford of turning the company into a \\"massive Ponzi scheme\\".  History  Allen Stanford traced his company to the insurance company founded in 1932 in Mexia, Texas, by his grandfather, Lodis B. Stanford. However, there was no direct connection between the insurance company and Allen Stanford's banking business, which he started on the British Overseas Territory of Montserrat in the West Indies in the 1980s. Allen Stanford's move into banking utilised funds he had made in real estate in Houston in the early 1980s.

In addition, Stanford International Bank placed a 60-day moratorium on early redemptions of its CDs. On February 18 and 19, 2009, Ecuador and Peru suspended the operations of local Stanford units, and, in Venezuela and Panama, the governments seized local units of Stanford Bank.

It most often presents in sun-exposed areas of the body. Some DSAP cases have been reported in patients with acute immune compromised situations, particularly in the elderly. For those with sun damaged skin, the lesions usually begin to appear in the patient's 20s and increase in number and visibility in the 40s or 50s. Commonly, though not always, the number and visibility of lesions is in direct proportion to the amount of sun damage to the affected area. Lesions generally are characterized by an irregularly shaped thread-like ring that is usually the size of a pencil eraser, though lesions vary and may be half or double that size. The thread-like ring is very thin, much like fabric thread for sewing, and raised such that it is both palpable and visible. The interior of the ring may be rough like sandpaper, or smooth. The interior is often discolored, though colors vary from patient to patient. Lesions, due to their vascular nature, can also vary according to body temperature, environmental temperatures, and other external stimuli. The internal ring color is most often reddish, purplish, pink, or brown. Some patients report itching and irritation associated with the condition, and many report no notable sensation. Although no known hormonal link has been found, DSAP occurs more commonly in women. A study in 2000 was done on a Chinese family, in which a locus for a gene was located.

Russian background Under the treaty of Adrianople the Russian Empire had been granted the East coast of the Black Sea by the Ottoman Empire. However Russia did not have complete control over these territories (the Circassian Coast) from Anapa in the north to Sochi in the south. The \\"mountaineers\\" (the Circassian [Adyghe] people) resisted the Russian authorities and did not admit Russian Control over their country Circassia, because Circassia was not part of the Ottoman Empire and the relations between Circassia and the Ottoman Empire were mainly a commercial and religious relations only. The mountaineers (Adyghe) were supported by English, French and the Polish immigrants. They were supplied with weapons and ammunition from abroad. On March 4, 1832 an instruction for the Black Sea cruisers was published in attempt to stop these deliveries. It said: > \\"For preservation of the Russian possessions from infection and to prevent > the delivery of military supplies to the mountain people, military cruisers > will permit foreign commercial vessels only to two points ‚Äì Anapa and > Redoute-kale in which there is a quarantine and customs....\\" Great Britain regarded it as infringement of the principle of freedom of commerce. British background The story begins, oddly, in Egypt.Walter Richmond, The Northwest Caucasus, 2008, Chapter 4 As a result of Muhammad Ali of Egypt's semi-rebellion the Turks were driven to sign the Treaty of H√ºnk√¢r ƒ∞skelesi with Russia (1833). This threatened to make the Ottoman Empire a Russian protectorate. Under a secret article the Turks would close the Dardanelles to British and French warships while allowing Russian warships into the Mediterranean. This led to an anti-Russian agitation in England. In 1834 David Urquhart went to Circassia and made contact with the rebels. In 1836 he was captured in the Vixen. From 1837 to 1840 or later James Stanislaus Bell, Edmond Spencer and J. A Longworth of the Times were also in Circassia. All three published memoirs. Their relation to the British government is uncertain. All four have been accused of implying that they have more influence on the British government than they in fact had and offering the Circassians false hope of British support that would probably not happen. Capture In November 1836 the Russian military brig Ajax detained the British schooner Vixen in ( ) in the sea port Sudzhuk-Kale (nowadays Novorossiysk). At the moment of detention, 8 guns, 28,800 pounds of gunpowder, and a significant amount of other weapons had already been unloaded. This was deemed a provocation by the Russians, instigated by the first secretary of the British embassy in Constantinople David Urquhart. The Polish immigrants also participated in the organisation of the incident. The crew received instructions to go in Sudzhuk-Kale where meeting with a Russian cruiser was almost inevitable. The owner of a schooner was recommended not to avoid it, but, on the contrary, to search for this meeting in every possible way. Reaction The reaction in London to the seizure was one of outrage. The Conservatives brought up in parliament a question on the legality of Circassia being under the jurisdiction of the Russian empire. Russia was threatened with war. After angry statements from London Nicholas I of Russia ordered the army and fleet into a condition of raised battle readiness. The schooner, according to the instruction, was confiscated, and its crew was sent to Constantinople. Consequences The conflict threatened to develop into war between Russia and Britain, but by April 1837 relations had settled down. Urquhart was withdrawn to London. Britain was reluctant to antagonise Russia further, as it could not find a continental ally willing to lend support in a war. The official answer of the government and the Liberal Party to an inquiry by the Conservatives stated that Russia owned Circassia lawfully under the Adrianople peace treaty. Russia, therefore, continued its blockade of the east coast of Black sea. The conflict became one of a number of episodes of Russian-British rivalry of the 1830s and 1840s. They were eventually to contribute to the Crimean War.

The Melzer See lies on the northeastern perimeter of the town of Waren (M√ºritz). It has an area of 12.9 hectares and lies at an elevation of . Its maximum dimensions are 670 by 260 metres. It is fed from the ditches of the nearby Lehmkuhlenbruch and its waters exit through a short ditch into the Tiefwarensee, from which it is only separated by a narrow isthmus and small road. The location between two lakes was the occasion for the origin of the name of the Waren quarter of Werdersiedlung. Whilst small gardens are ranged along its southern shore, the Melzer See is bordered to the northwest by meadowland. It lies entirely within the protected area of the Torgelower See. Visitors can walk around the lake on a two-kilometre-long footpath. The Ice Age Trail along theTiefwarensee also runs past the Melzer See.
