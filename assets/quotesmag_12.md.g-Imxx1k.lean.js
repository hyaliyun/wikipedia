He began studying the guqin with a guqin master Suo Shaotao at the age of thirteen. In the 1930s, Zhang moved to Shanghai and worked as an accountant at a salt factory.Dai 1991, p. 79 In Shanghai, he met Zha Fuxi and Peng Zhiqing who were active qin players then. They frequently played the guqin together and Zhang's playing skills were greatly influenced by them. In 1936, Zhang, Zha, Peng and other masters founded Jin Yu Qin She (Qin Society of Contemporary Yu Region), a qin society. In 1956, Zhang became a guqin performer by being appointed as a member of the state-run Shanghai Minzu Yuetuan (Shanghai National Music Ensemble); and a guqin teacher at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music in 1960.Dai 1991, p. 82 As a professional guqin performer of the Guangling School, one of the qin schools, Zhang skillfully transcribed guqin pieces from ancient manuscripts with the Guangling style and his distinctive interpretations, e.g. rhythmic variations. His famous pieces includes Longxiang Cao (Soaring Dragon), Pingsha Luoyan (Geese Descending on the Sandbank), and Meihua Sannong (Three Variations of Plum Blossom).Gong 1989, p.849 His rendition of Longxiang Cao is considered one of his best interpretations and thus he is also known as Zhang Longxiang (). Zhang was also devoted to writing articles and essays on guqin. In 1961, he published Guqin Chujie (A Preliminary Introduction to the Guqin) with Zha Fuxi and Shen Caonong. This publication features guqin history, guqin construction, guqin playing technique, guqin notation, and guqin pieces, which is considered as a major introductory manual for beginners.

Life and Early Training Karl Heinrich Barth was born in Pillau, East Prussia (modern day Baltiysk, Russia) on July 12, 1847. Little is known about Barth's early life, except that his first piano lessons were given by his father. At the age of nine, following initial lessons with his father, Heinrich Barth moved to Potsdam to study with Ludwig Seinmann. Barth's later teachers included significant 19th century pianists. Among these teachers were Hans von Bronsart and Carl Tausig, both of whom were students of Franz Liszt. Barth established his career as soloist, chamber musician, and teacher across Europe. He died in Berlin on December 23, 1922.  Teaching Career  In 1868, Barth accepted his first major teaching position as professor of piano at the Stern Conservatory. Barth moved from teaching at the Stern Conservatory to the Berlin Hochschule f√ºr Musik in 1871, becoming chair of the piano department in 1910. He would remain at the Berlin Hochschule until his retirement in 1921. While working at the Berlin Hochschule f√ºr Musik, his pupils included Arthur Rubinstein, Heinrich Neuhaus, Wilhelm Kempff, Siegfried Schultze and Rose and Ottilie Sutro. Barth's pupils remember his teaching style as being stern, and that his expectations were high for his students.  Performing Career  While living in Berlin, Barth served as court pianist to Kaiser Friedrich III of Prussia. He also frequently performed in public with the violinist, conductor and composer Joseph Joachim and with Joachim's wife, the singer Amalie Weiss. He formed a piano trio with the violinist Heinrich Karl Hermann de Ahna and the cellist Robert Hausmann, which was well known and widely celebrated. Throughout his performing career, Barth frequently performed the works of Johannes Brahms, whom Barth knew personally.

Background Barnum has been commissioned by ACDA Honor choirs, university ensembles, professional choirs, and school choirs. His \\"She Walks in Beauty\\" was incorporated in Chanticleer's touring repertoire. Eric Barnum did not start composing until he was 21 years old, in fact he wanted to be an archaeologist but decided to study graphic design.  Education  Eric Barnum studied composition and vocal performance at Bemidji State University, Minnesota, where he studied with Dr. Patrick Riley (2002). He later studied composition and received his M.Mus. in choral conducting with David Dickau at Minnesota State University - Mankato (2004). Eric received a DMA in Choral Conducting from the University of Washington under the direction of Dr. Geoffrey Boers in 2013. Musical style Barnum's music is intricately tied to the text, most often chosen from Latin liturgical sources or English poetry. The melodic line in all voices is treated with the utmost importance. Unexpected, but beautiful, harmonic progressions evoke mystical scenes of nature and spirit. Barnum is influenced by the compositions of John Tavener, Arvo P√§rt, Gerald Finzi, and Thomas Newman. *1 Dr. Eric Barnum on March 21, 2014 at the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh gave a presentation entitled, \\"Telling Stories\\". During this presentation Eric told students his inspiration for composing music. Eric, very much like a sculptor, finds the inspiration from within the poetry and then by his hand comes to life. For this reason Eric hopes that each piece is unique and tells the story of the poetry or writing, he doesn't wish to have a \\"style\\".

It consists of a white dwarf primary being orbited by a low mass companion. The white dwarf is about 0.85 solar masses while the companion is only 0.08 solar masses. This implies that the companion is a spectral class L2 star, although this has yet to be confirmed. The distance to this system has been determined by parallax, yielding a distance of 45.1 parsecs. WZ Sagittae is an ultrashort period cataclysmic nova, with outbursts observed in 1913, 1946, 1978 and 2001. During the well-observed 2001 outburst, the nova reached a peak visual magnitude of 8.21. The 1913 event was the brightest of the observed outbursts, reaching a photographic magnitude of 7.0. This nova is classified as a SU Ursae Majoris class star, which is a subclass of dwarf nova that produces what are termed superoutbursts spaced several months apart, interspaced with normal outbursts every few weeks. The normal outbursts typically last 2‚àí3 days, while a superoutburst lasts a few weeks. However, WZ Sagittae is unusual in that it is only observed to emit superbursts. The outbursts of a dwarf nova are caused when matter from a ring- like accretion disk becomes unstable. In this system, the companion star is sufficiently close to the white dwarf that the tidal bulge of the former overlaps the Roche limit, allowing matter to pass across and accumulate onto the disk. When the disk reaches a critical temperature, the gas collapses onto the white dwarf resulting in the release of gravitational potential energy. A superoutburst may be caused by a tidal interaction of the accretion disk with the donor star, resulting in a greater deposition of matter on the white dwarf. In the case of WZ Sagittae, however, magnetic effects may act to enhance the deposition, resulting in the lack of normal outbursts. Because of the unique timing differences in the rate of superoutbursts of this nova, it been designated the prototype star for a WZ Sagittae subclass. The orbital period of this system is 1.361 hours. Based upon observations of eclipses of the hot spot on the white dwarf (created by infalling material), the orbital plane of this system is inclined by to the line of sight from the Earth.

It was established in September 1943. The airport is home to Southeastern Oklahoma State University's Aviation Sciences Institute. History The airport is named for SOSU alum General Ira Eaker, a 1917 graduate of Southeastern who served in World War I and World War II. During World War II, General Eaker was commander of the Eighth Air Force in England and led several historic bombing missions against targets in occupied Europe and Germany. The City of Durant named an airfield west of town in honor of then Captain Eaker in the 1930s. The U.S. Navy built the current airfield as an auxiliary field during World War II and it became Durant Municipal Airport after the war. It was later renamed Eaker Field. The airport was served by Central Airlines from October 1949 until August 1954. Central initially operated only Beechcraft Bonanzas but phased them out in 1950‚Äì1951 in favor of the Douglas DC-3. Facilities Eaker Field covers and has one asphalt runway. Runway 17/35 is 5,001 x 100 ft (1,524.3 x 30.5 m). In 2005 the airport had 46,355 aircraft operations, average 127 per day: 97.8% general aviation, 2.2% general aviation itinerant, 0.1% military. 21 aircraft were then based at the airport: 17 single-engine, 3 multi-engine, and 1 jet. Expansion The Eaker Field Airport Terminal. On February 11, 2011, Eaker Field opened a new, modern terminal building. The project was funded by the Durant Industrial Authority and by a grant provided by the Oklahoma Aeronautics Commission. The taxiway was also resurfaced for the first time since 1943. The original design called for an air traffic control tower to be added, but that plan was later scrapped due to the cost.

His early childhood was in Moscow where his father served in the British Embassy for 18 months. When his father moved back to the UK to work for the BBC, Tim went to Datchworth primary school. Later his father ran The Near East Broadcasting Station Sharq al-Adna; his mother taught her children by PNEU until Tim went to The Junior School in Nicosia as a boarder. After the Suez d√©b√¢cle, his father returned to the UK to train as a parson, and the family lived in Oxfordshire, Wiltshire and Dorset. Tim boarded at the Perse school to age 15 and then to Dauntsey's. From 1964‚Äì1967 he was an undergraduate at the University of Hull, obtaining a 1st Class Honours BSc in Mathematics. In 1967-1969 he began graduate work at Hull, taking a sabbatical year as Student Union president. He then moved to the University of Warwick to take a PhD in Mathematics. His PhD thesis on \\"Fuzzy Geometry\\" was supervised by Christopher Zeeman and the PhD was awarded in 1972. This topic, otherwise known as ‚Äútolerance spaces‚Äù, is similar to topology and should not be confused with fuzzy logic. Tim specialized in geometry, graphics, algorithm design, human- computer interaction, medical imaging, patent writing and singularity theory.https://www.linkedin.com/in/timposton His books on catastrophe theory and on differential geometry and relativity are still in print after a third of a century. His academic career was carried out in a series of research centres, including Rio de Janeiro, Rochester NY, Porto, Geneva, Stuttgart, Charleston SC, Santa Cruz CA, Los Angeles CA, Pohang, Singapore, and Bangalore. His academic publications include 70 papers in journals and conference proceedings and 4 research texts. His research areas include catastrophe theory, the psychology of perception, vibrations of crystals, urban planning, settlement patterns in archaeology, 3D graphics, magnetic resonance imaging, interaction with documents and with virtual 3D objects, dynamic text rendering, and brain surgery planning. He has 18 patents issued, with another 12 in the pipeline. From a very early age Tim discovered he not only liked to read science fiction, but loved writing down his own stories too. This ultimately lead to the co-authoring of an SF novel The Living Labyrinth, published in 2016 by ReAnimus Press, and its sequel Rock Star in 2017. Less well known is his role as active founding member of COUM Transmissions performance group with Genesis P-Orridge. They studied at Hull University together.

Reiss- Andersen went to sea at 17 years of age, sailing the Baltic and North Seas for a year in the brig ‚ÄúBaron von Holberg\\", which was commanded by his uncle, Knut Knutsen. After completing the Examen artium with emphasis in Latin in 1916 he went into the military, becoming a non-commissioned officer. There he followed his inclination towards the arts, painting portraits. He subsequently studied painting in Copenhagen (1917‚Äì1919) and Paris (1919‚Äì1921). For several years he worked as an artist, illustrator, and the art reviewer for the Arbeiderbladet newspaper in Oslo. In 1921 he debuted as a lyric poet with his poetry collection titled Indvielsens aar. He participated in the Norwegian resistance movement beginning in 1940 and during the early years of the Second World War, writing clandestinely distributed anti-war poetry to express opposition to the German occupation. In 1942 he was forced to flee to Sweden to avoid arrest by the Gestapo. He achieved a wide following in Norway by serving as one of the voices for the resistance, along with Nordahl Grieg and Arnulf √òverland. His contributions included several resistance-oriented collections of poetry including a collection written primarily in Norway titled Kampdikt fra Norge 1940-43 (‚ÄúWar Poetry from Norway 1940-43‚Äù) which was published in Stockholm in 1943 and Norsk r√∏st (‚ÄúNorwegian Voice of Conscience‚Äù) which was published in Stockholm in 1944. His poetry written during the war, which had previously circulated illegally, was published in Norway as a collection in the spring of 1945, and enjoyed popularity. During his stay in Sweden, he was exposed to modernistic Swedish poetry and the influence of this genre became obvious in his post-war work. Reiss-Andersen was awarded the Norwegian state‚Äôs artist salary in 1945; this is a substantial recognition which had previously been awarded to well-recognized writers, poets, playwrights and composers including Bj√∏rnstjerne Bj√∏rnson, Henrik Ibsen, Edvard Grieg, Olav Duun and Johan Falkberget. After 1963 he also received an honorary salary from the publishing house, Gyldendal in recognition for his contributions. Personal life In 1921, Reiss-Andersen married Elizabeth Waage (1898-1962). There were the parents of journalist Gry Waage (born 1922). In 1925 he married Tordis Castberg Anker (1899‚Äì1967). They had a son, Helge Reiss-Andersen (1926-2009). Gunnar Reiss-Andersen was also the father of Dag Halvorsen (1934‚Äì2007), who was a journalist and foreign correspondent. He is the paternal grandfather of attorney Berit Reiss-Andersen (born 1954) who is best known for her work as Norwegian State Secretary . In 1962, King Haakon awarded him the rank Knight, First Class in the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav. Reiss-Andersen died in 1964 and was buried at Undersbo kirke in Larvik. In 1977, a bust of Reiss- Andersen by Stinius Fredriksen (1902-1977) was placed in the market square at Larvik city center.

The ninth tropical cyclone of the 2001 Atlantic hurricane season, the depression developed from a tropical wave in the southwestern Caribbean Sea on September 19\\\\. Without significant intensification, the depression made landfall in Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua early on September 20, which was about six hours after becoming a tropical cyclone. Once inland over Central America, the depression significant deteriorated and dissipated later that day, after lasting for less than 24 hours. The remnants emerged into the Pacific Ocean and later developed into Hurricane Juliette. Impact from the depression was rather minor. Although sustained winds on land did not exceed 30 mph (55 km/h), a fallen tree injured three children in El Salvador. In addition, heavy rainfall flooded at least 200 homes in San Salvador and inundated 15 farms. The depression did not result in fatalities and damage caused by it is unknown. Meteorological history A tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean on September 11. After tracking westward for five days, the wave entered the Caribbean Sea on September 16\\\\. Convection steadily increased in both coverage and intensity, and by September 19, the system reached the southwestern Caribbean Sea. Satellite imagery and surface observations indicated that Tropical Depression Nine formed at 1800 UTC on September 19, while located 50 miles (80 km) north-northwest of San Andres Island. Initially, the depression had two centers of circulation, one east of Costa Rica and one east of Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua. Because the thunderstorm activity was more intense and persistent at the northern circulation, advisories were initiated using the latter. Computer forecast models predicted that the depression would make landfall in Nicaragua and then enter the eastern Pacific Ocean within 36 hours. Other computer forecast models separated it into two systems, with the northern center going into the Bay of Campeche and the southern center going westward through Costa Rica and into the Pacific while strengthening into a \\"significant tropical cyclone\\". Although only a tropical depression, upper level outflow was circular and was indicative of a more \\"mature\\" tropical cyclone. At 0000 UTC on September 20, the depression made landfall near Punta Cabezas, Nicaragua with winds of 35 mph (55 km/h) and weakening was immediately forecast. Three hours later, the National Hurricane Center issued its final advisory, as the lower level center became poorly defined because of interaction with the mountains of Central America and deep thunderstorm activity had significantly diminished. The National Hurricane Center noted the possibility of regeneration, if the circulation entered into the Pacific Ocean within a few days. Although the depression never redeveloped, the remnant tropical wave emerged into the Pacific Ocean and contributed to the development of Hurricane Juliette on September 21.  Preparations and Impact  Upon development of the tropical depression, a tropical storm watch was issued from Bluefields, Nicaragua to Dangriga, Belize. When the depression made landfall, this warning was discontinued. Residents in El Salvador were advised to avoid rivers due to possible flooding but no mandatory evacuations were put in place. A green alert was issued in Nicaragua due to the threat of heavy rains and high winds. This alert remained in effect until September 21\\\\. Three children were injured by a fallen tree in the country. The highest sustained winds on land from the depression were reported at Punta Cabezas, Nicaragua with winds of 30 mph (50 km/h) and a minimum pressure of . A total of of rain was recorded in Bluefields while up to was estimated to have fallen in mountainous areas. In El Salvador, heavy rains from the depression helped alleviate drought conditions; however, flooding also inundated 200 homes in San Salvador along the Acelhuate River. Fifteen farms were inundated by flooding, five of which were destroyed. Seventy people evacuated to shelters set up after the storm by the local Red Cross and armed forces. Military crews were quickly deployed to help clean up the damages on September 22. Although it passed over Central America, there are no reports of damage or deaths in the region due to the tropical depression.

It was filmed 24 April 1909 at what is now known as Centocelle Airport, near Rome, by French cinematographic company Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale des Cin√©matographes Eclipse. The events leading up to the creation of the film began in 1908 when the Wright brothers received an invitation from the Compagnie G√©n√©rale de Navigation A√©rienne to ship a Wright Flyer \\"Model A\\" airplane to France and fly it at Le Mans to dispel any remaining doubt that they had indeed conquered heavier-than-air flight. Since few had witnessed their earlier successes, many in Europe were skeptical about their claims. Some skeptics in the European press went so far as to claim that the stories were a \\"bluff.\\" The 30 August 1908 edition of Le petit journal illustr√© was quoted as saying, \\"The experiments that Wilbur Wright is carrying out in France at the moment victoriously responded to this accusation.\\" Among those present for the public demonstrations prior to the filming was Louis Bl√©riot, who would cross the English Channel by plane the following year. It begins with a shot of Wilbur Wright starting the engine; an unidentified assistant (quite likely his brother, Orville) is seen at the front of the aircraft. From there, shots of the aircraft in flight with Wright at the controls along with an unidentified passenger cut to shots of onlookers on the ground, presumably military and press liaisons. The aircraft is shown in side- to-side flybys as well as low-altitude passes directly toward and away from the camera. The aerial shots begin at the 1:34 mark immediately after a shot of the aircraft coming to a landing directly approaching the camera. A title card appears which reads Aufnahmen von der Flugmaschine aus gemacht, or \\"Shots Taken from the Flying Machine.\\" From there, the shot is of the aircraft on its launch sled as it is being prepared for takeoff. An assistant at the rear of the plane, again presumably Orville Wright, starts the engine as Wilbur Wright takes his seat at the controls. The actual onboard shots, with the camera mounted on the left lower wing near Wright's seating position begin at approximately the two-minute mark of the film as the aircraft lifts off from the launch sled. The canard, elevator and the elevator's control cord are in the foreground of the film as the Italian countryside (complete with livestock, a man on horseback and the ruins of a Roman aqueduct) passes beneath.Wilbur Wright und seine Flugmaschine History of the film along with the film itself at Europafilmtreasures.com Wilbur Wright und seine Flugmaschine has been restored and archived by Filmarchiv Austria.

In Dead to the World, Sookie aids vampires Eric and Pam in their struggle against a coven of witches seeking to take over control of their area, and takes care of Eric after the witches erase his memory. The novel was adapted as the fourth season of True Blood, the HBO series based on the novels, however with a few notable differences. Plot summary This novel opens on New Year's Eve, three weeks after the events of Club Dead. Sookie Stackhouse finds Eric running down the road close to her home, but he seems to have lost his memory. Sookie, initially reluctant to get involved in vampire matters once again, takes Eric in. Eric's second in command, Pam, is relieved at Sookie finding Eric, and explains a coven of villainous witches, some of them also werewolves, has arrived in Shreveport, set on extorting money from Eric and taking over the local power he has. Hence, Pam believes the witches to be responsible for Eric's erased memory. After Sookie's brother Jason bargains on a financial settlement, Sookie agrees to keep Eric in her house and care for him, as the witches are on the lookout for Eric and might harm him. The next day, Jason is missing. Sookie oversees the slowly progressing police investigation of her brother's disappearance, but personally fears the witch coven might've gotten hold of him. Later on, Sookie informs werewolf Alcide Herveaux of the witch coven being in town. Alcide and his pack master fear that one of their pack members might have defected to the witches' side, but Sookie and Alcide then discover this particular woman's murdered body. Back in Bon Temps, Sookie's workplace is paid a visit to by the leaders of the witch coven, Marnie \\"Hallow\\" and Mark Stonebrook. Meanwhile, Sookie and Eric give in to their intense desire for each other. Pam suggests Alcide's werewolf pack, her area vampires and some local Wiccans unite to fight off the witch coven. They do so and with Sookie's assistance, brutally attack the witches' main gathering place, wiping out everyone present but Hallow, whom Pam captures and forces to lift Eric's amnesia. Sookie returns home dismayed at the loss of her relationship with the memory-free Eric, and finally retrieves Jason with Sam's help in Hotshot, a local were-panther community. In Hotshot, Felton Norris, romantically interested in Jason's one-time fling Crystal, also a werepanther, had contained Jason and purposefully bit him to change him into a werepanther, so that Crystal would lose her interest in Jason. Deaths This novel marked the death of three previously introduced characters; Fangtasia's human waitress Ginger was killed by a witch curse, Fangtasia's replacement bartender Chow was staked in the climactic battle, and Alcide Herveaux's jealous, shapeshifter ex-girlfriend Debbie Pelt was shot to death by Sookie after invading Sookie's house intending to kill her. Television adaptation The television adaptation, as the fourth season of True Blood, began its broadcast on June 26, 2011, and the season's finale was aired on September 11, 2011. Courtney Ford joined the cast as Portia Bellefleur, sister to Andy Bellefleur. Portia appeared in the previous three novels, but not in Dead to the World. She did not appear in the previous three seasons of True Blood. Alexandra Breckenridge was cast as Katarina, a member of Marnie's Wiccan group. Daniel Buran was cast as Marcus Bozeman, Alcide's pack master. In the novel, Alcide's packmaster was named Colonel Flood. Fiona Shaw was cast as Marnie \\"Hallow\\" Stonebrook. Characters from Dead to the World that appeared in True Blood's earlier seasons include Crystal Norris played by Lindsay Pulsipher, Felton Norris played by James Harvey Ward and Holly Cleary played by Lauren Bowles. *In the series, Sookie returned from the fairy world at the beginning. In the novel, she didn't. She hasn't got a clue about being half-fairy yet. *In the series, Eric buys Sookie's house from Jason because he never gave up hope Sookie would return. In the novel, the house is still Sookie's. *In the series, the werewolves do not become involved in the vampire-witch feud, in fact the pack leader Marcus orders the weres to stay out of the argument. In the novel, the Shreveport werewolves, headed by Colonel Flood, took part in the fight, along with some Wiccans and the Fangtasia vampires. *In the series, Debbie Pelt is shot and killed by Sookie, after shooting and presumably killing Tara who was protecting Sookie. In the novel, Debbie broke into Sookie's and shoot her, but Eric took the bullet instead. Then, Sookie shot Debbie and Eric hid the corpse. *In the series, Bill became the King of Louisiana after killing the former queen. He fights back the witches along the season. In the book, Bill is the area investigator, though he's gone to Peru in a mission. He only shows up during the attack to the witches. *In the series, Jason is captured by the were-panthers and finally escapes by his own. In the novel, Sookie found out where her brother is and rescues him. *In the series, Eric got his memory back thanks to Sookie fairy powers. In the novel, Pam tortures Hallow (named Marnie in the series) so she revert the curse. Also, in the books, Eric didn't remember the time he'd been blacked out.

It was brought to the black market, instead, in a clandestine fashion as a \\"designer steroid.\\" Medical uses Methasterone was never a commercially available prescription drug. Its non-17Œ±-alkylated counterpart, drostanolone propionate, was commercialized by Syntex Corporation under the brand name Masteron. Non-medical uses Methasterone resurfaced in 2005 as a ‚Äúdesigner steroid‚Äù. It was brought to market by Designer Supplements as the primary ingredient of a dietary supplement named Superdrol. Its introduction into commerce may have represented an attempted circumvention of the U.S. Anabolic Steroids Control Act of 1990 (along with its 2004 revision), since the law is, in part, drug- specific; methasterone, as is the case with many designer steroids, was not declared a Schedule III class anabolic steroid in that act because it was not commercially available at the time the act, and its subsequent revision, were signed into law. Methasterone was therefore being sold as an over-the-counter dietary supplement. Side effects Methasterone is hepatotoxic (toxic to the liver). Several cases of liver damage due to the use of methasterone have been cited in the medical literature. Chemistry Methasterone, also known as 2Œ±,17Œ±-dimethyl-5Œ±-dihydrotestosterone (2Œ±,17Œ±-dimethyl-DHT) or as 2Œ±,17Œ±-dimethyl-5Œ±-androstan-17Œ≤-ol-3-one, is a synthetic androstane steroid and a 17Œ±-alkylated derivative of DHT. Mebolazine is formed by hydrazone formation between two equivalents of methasterone with one equivalent of hydrazine. History The synthesis of methasterone is first mentioned in the literature in 1956 in connection with research conducted by Syntex Corporation in order to discover a compound with anti-tumor properties. In a 1959 research journal article, it is initially mentioned and is elaborated upon where its method of synthesis is discussed in greater detail, its tumor inhibiting properties are verified, and it is noted as being a ‚Äúpotent orally active anabolic agent exhibiting only weak androgenic activity.‚Äù The results of subsequent assays to determine methasterone's anabolic and androgenic activity were published in Vida's Androgens and Anabolic Agents, a dated but still standard reference, where it was noted that methasterone possessed the oral bioavailability of methyltestosterone while being 400% as anabolic and 20% as androgenic, yielding a Q-ratio (anabolic to androgenic ratio) of 20, which is considered very high. Designer steroid It was in late 2005 that the reclassification of methasterone as AAS (as well as that of four other designer steroids) was brought to public awareness via an article published in the Washington Post. Don Catlin of the UCLA Olympic Laboratory, who conducted the studies, noted methasterone's similarity to drostanolone. A warning by the FDA was issued soon after to the general public as well as to the distributor, Designer Supplements LLC, for the marketing of this compound. Methasterone was subsequently added to the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) list of prohibited substances in sport. Despite all of this, methasterone has resurfaced within the supplement industry on several occasions since its banning by WADA.

They included the world's first stored-program computer, the world's first transistorised computer, and what was the world's fastest computer at the time of its inauguration in 1962. The Virtual Museum of Manchester Computing: Timeline of Manchester Computing The project began with two aims: to prove the practicality of the Williams tube, an early form of computer memory based on standard cathode ray tubes (CRTs); and to construct a machine that could be used to investigate how computers might be able to assist in the solution of mathematical problems. The first of the series, the Manchester Baby, ran its first program on 21 June 1948. As the world's first stored-program computer, the Baby, and the Manchester Mark 1 developed from it, quickly attracted the attention of the United Kingdom government, who contracted the electrical engineering firm of Ferranti to produce a commercial version. The resulting machine, the Ferranti Mark 1, was the world's first commercially available general-purpose computer. The collaboration with Ferranti eventually led to an industrial partnership with the computer company ICL, who made use of many of the ideas developed at the university, particularly in the design of their 2900 series of computers during the 1970s. Manchester Baby The Manchester Baby was designed as a test-bed for the Williams tube, an early form of computer memory, rather than as a practical computer. Work on the machine began in 1947, and on 21 June 1948 the computer successfully ran its first program, consisting of 17 instructions written to find the highest proper factor of 218 (262,144) by trying every integer from 218 ‚àí 1 downwards. The program ran for 52 minutes before producing the correct answer of 131,072. The Baby was in length, tall, and weighed almost 1 long ton. It contained 550 thermionic valves ‚Äì 300 diodes and 250 pentodes ‚Äì and had a power consumption of 3.5 kilowatts. Its successful operation was reported in a letter to the journal Nature published in September 1948, establishing it as the world's first stored-program computer. It quickly evolved into a more practical machine, the Manchester Mark 1. Manchester Mark 1 Development of the Manchester Mark 1 began in August 1948, with the initial aim of providing the university with a more realistic computing facility. In October 1948 UK Government Chief Scientist Ben Lockspeiser was given a demonstration of the prototype, and was so impressed that he immediately initiated a government contract with the local firm of Ferranti to make a commercial version of the machine, the Ferranti Mark 1. Two versions of the Manchester Mark 1 were produced, the first of which, the Intermediary Version, was operational by April 1949. The Final Specification machine, which was fully working by October 1949, contained 4,050 valves and had a power consumption of 25 kilowatts.. (Reprint of the paper published in Communications of the ACM (January 1978) 21 (1) Perhaps the Manchester Mark 1's most significant innovation was its incorporation of index registers, commonplace on modern computers. Meg and Mercury As a result of experience gained from the Mark 1, the developers concluded that computers would be used more in scientific roles than pure maths. They therefore embarked on the design of a new machine which would include a floating point unit; work began in 1951. The resulting machine, which ran its first program in May 1954, was known as Meg, or the megacycle machine. It was smaller and simpler than the Mark 1, as well as quicker at solving maths problems. Ferranti produced a commercial version marketed as the Ferranti Mercury, in which the Williams tubes were replaced by the more reliable core memory. Transistor Computer Work on building a smaller and cheaper computer began in 1952, in parallel with Meg's ongoing development. Two of Kilburn's team, Richard Grimsdale and D. C. Webb, were assigned to the task of designing and building a machine using the newly developed transistors instead of valves. Initially the only devices available were germanium point-contact transistors, less reliable than the valves they replaced but which consumed far less power. Two versions of the machine were produced. The first was the world's first transistorised computer, a prototype, and became operational on 16 November 1953. \\"The 48-bit machine used 92 point-contact transistors and 550 diodes\\". The second version was completed in April 1955. The 1955 version used 250 junction transistors, 1,300 solid-state diodes, and had a power consumption of 150 watts. The machine did however make use of valves to generate its 125 kHz clock waveforms and in the circuitry to read and write on its magnetic drum memory, so it was not the first completely transistorised computer, a distinction that went to the Harwell CADET of 1955. Problems with the reliability of early batches of transistors meant that the machine's mean time between failures was about 90 minutes, which improved once the more reliable junction transistors became available. The Transistor Computer's design was adopted by the local engineering firm of Metropolitan-Vickers in their Metrovick 950, in which all the circuitry was modified to make use of junction transistors. Six Metrovick 950s were built, the first completed in 1956. They were successfully deployed within various departments of the company and were in use for about five years. Muse and Atlas Development of MUSE ‚Äì a name derived from \\"microsecond engine\\" ‚Äì began at the university in 1956. The aim was to build a computer that could operate at processing speeds approaching one microsecond per instruction, one million instructions per second. Mu (or ¬µ) is a prefix in the SI and other systems of units denoting a factor of 10‚àí6 (one millionth). At the end of 1958 Ferranti agreed to collaborate with Manchester University on the project, and the computer was shortly afterwards renamed Atlas, with the joint venture under the control of Tom Kilburn. The first Atlas was officially commissioned on 7 December 1962, and was considered at that time to be the most powerful computer in the world, equivalent to four IBM 7094s. It was said that whenever Atlas went offline half of the UK's computer capacity was lost. Its fastest instructions took 1.59 microseconds to execute, and the machine's use of virtual storage and paging allowed each concurrent user to have up to one million words of storage space available. Atlas pioneered many hardware and software concepts still in common use today including the Atlas Supervisor, \\"considered by many to be the first recognisable modern operating system\\". Two other machines were built: one for a joint British Petroleum/University of London consortium, and the other for the Atlas Computer Laboratory at Chilton near Oxford. A derivative system was built by Ferranti for Cambridge University, called the Titan or Atlas 2, which had a different memory organisation, and ran a time-sharing operating system developed by Cambridge Computer Laboratory. The University of Manchester's Atlas was decommissioned in 1971, but the last was in service until 1974. Parts of the Chilton Atlas are preserved by the National Museums of Scotland in Edinburgh. MU5 A fuller article about MU5 can be found on the Engineering and Technology History Wiki . An outline proposal for a successor to Atlas was presented at the 1968 IFIP Conference in Edinburgh, although work on the project and talks with ICT (of which Ferranti had become part) aimed at obtaining their assistance and support had begun in 1966. The new machine, later to become known as MU5, was intended to be at the top end of a range of machines and to be 20 times faster than Atlas. In 1968 the Science Research Council (SRC) awarded Manchester University a five-year grant of ¬£630,466 (equivalent to ¬£ in ) to develop the machine and ICT, later to become ICL, made its production facilities available to the University. In that year a group of 20 people was involved in the design: 11 Department of Computer Science staff, 5 seconded ICT staff and 4 SRC supported staff. The peak level of staffing was in 1971, when the numbers, including research students, rose to 60. The most significant novel features of the MU5 processor were its instruction set and the use of associative memory to speed up operand and instruction accesses. The instruction set was designed to permit the generation of efficient object code by compilers, to allow for a pipeline organisation of the processor and to provide information to the hardware on the nature of operands, so as to allow them to be optimally buffered. Thus named variables were buffered separately from array elements, which were themselves accessed by means of named descriptors. Each descriptor included an array length which could be used in string processing instructions or to enable array bound checking to be carried out by hardware. The instruction pre-fetching mechanism used an associative jump trace to predict the outcome of impending branches. The MU5 operating system MUSS was designed to be highly adaptable and was ported to a variety of processors at Manchester and elsewhere. In the completed MU5 system, three processors (MU5 itself, an ICL 1905E and a PDP-11), as well as a number of memories and other devices, were interconnected by a high-speed Exchange. All three processors ran a version of MUSS. MUSS also encompassed compilers for various languages and runtime packages to support the compiled code. It was structured as a small kernel that implemented an arbitrary set of virtual machines analogous to a corresponding set of processors. The MUSS code appeared in the common segments that formed part of each virtual machine's virtual address space. MU5 was fully operational by October 1974, coinciding with ICL's announcement that it was working on the development of a new range of computers, the 2900 series. ICL's 2980 in particular, first delivered in June 1975, owed a great deal to the design of MU5 . MU5 remained in operation at the University until 1982. MU6 Once MU5 was fully operational, a new project was initiated to produce its successor, MU6. MU6 was intended to be a range of processors: MU6P , an advanced microprocessor architecture intended for use as a personal computer, MU6-G , a high performance machine for general or scientific applications and MU6V , a parallel vector processing system. A prototype model of MU6V, based on 68000 microprocessors with vector orders emulated as \\"extracodes\\" was constructed and tested but not further developed beyond this. MU6-G was built with a grant from SRC and successfully ran as a service machine in the Department between 1982 and 1987, using the MUSS operating system developed as part of the MU5 project.

They had long toes and highly developed sternums that made them well suited to life on land. On the other hand, the other subfamily, Tangasaurinae, is composed of taxa that were adapted to an aquatic life. They had webbed feet and a laterally compressed tails that allowed them to be able to swim in the freshwater lacustrine environment present at the time. Because of their highly derived aquatic characteristics and occurrence in time, it has been suggested that the tangasaurids were a direct ancestor of the superorder Sauropterygia, which includes many highly derived marine aquatic reptiles such as placodonts, nothosaurs, and plesiosaurs.Carroll, R.L. 1988. Vertebrate Paleontology and Evolution. WH Freeman and Company, New York Classification Despite the controversy over the definition of the order Eosuchia (to which the Tangasauridae are considered to have belonged) and as to which taxa should be considered to fall within it, the position of the tangasaurids as part of this group has rarely been questioned. An alternative order has been proposed to resolve the issues surrounding Eosuchia, the Younginiformes. Because their quadratojugal and jugal bones meet to form an arch in the skull, as is a characteristic of many primitive diapsids, tangasaurs would be included in Younginiformes. The Tangasauridae is divided into two subfamilies, as shown below: *Family Tangasauridae :*Subfamily Kenyasaurinae ::*Kenyasaurus :*Subfamily Tangasaurinae ::*Acerosodontosaurus ::*Hovasaurus ::*Tangasaurus References Category:Permian reptiles Category:Triassic diapsids Category:Lopingian first appearances Category:Early Triassic extinctions Category:Prehistoric neodiapsids Category:Prehistoric reptile families ","title":"Tangasauridae"},{"id":"21629903","text":"All oil drilling into the South Ellwood Offshore field takes place from Platform Holly, about two miles (3 km) offshore in state waters . Oil wells on wharves built out over the ocean, Summerland oil field, 1902. Known oil and gas fields in federal waters, offshore California (Minerals Management Service) Offshore oil and gas in California provides a significant portion of the state's petroleum production. Offshore oil and gas has been a contentious issue for decades, first over the question of state versus federal ownership, but since 1969 mostly over questions of resource development versus environmental protection. Notable offshore fields include the Ellwood Oil Field and the Wilmington Oil Field, both of which are partially onshore and partially offshore, and the large Dos Cuadras Field in the Santa Barbara Channel, which is entirely in the federal zone. State offshore seabed in California produced of oil per day, and federal offshore tracts produced of oil per day in November 2008. State and federal offshore tracts together made up 16% of the state's oil production.California Department of Conservation: Monthly oil and gas production and injection report, November 2008, PDF file, downloaded 17 February 2009. Pre-oil industry Knowledge of the probable existence of oil off the coast of California dates back to the early European explorers who noted oil slicks in the Santa Barbara channel (see Coal Oil Point seep field). In 1792, when the English explorer James Cook anchored his ship in the Santa Barbara Channel, his navigator George Vancouver wrote that the sea was ‚Äú... covered with a thick, slimy substance,‚Äù and added ‚Äú... the sea had the appearance of dissolved tar floating on its surface, which covered the ocean in all directions within the limits of our view.‚ÄùR.F. Yerkes, H.C. Wagner, and K.A. Yenne (1969) Petroleum development in the region of the Santa Barbara Channel, US Geological Survey, Professional Paper 679-B, p.14. In 1865, oil geologist Charles Jackson wrote: :‚ÄúOff the coast of Santa Barbara. The strong smell of petroleum comes from the sea, the oil floating on the water.‚ÄùCharles T. Jackson, ‚ÄúPetrolia,‚Äù San Francisco Alta California, 2 August 1865, p.1. A description of the oil and gas seeps offshore southern California can be found in a report on the California Division of Oil and Gas's website. California Offshore Oil Seeps Report The report is accompanied by a map, showing the locations of offshore petroleum seeps from Point Arguello (north of Santa Barbara) to Mexico. California Offshore Oil Seeps from Point Arguello to Mexico Extension of onshore fields Offshore drilling began in California in 1896, when operators in the Summerland Oil Field in Santa Barbara County followed the field into the ocean by drilling from piers built out over the ocean. At least 187 offshore oil wells were drilled in the Summerland Field by 1902. A number of other coastal fields were extended offshore in Santa Barbara, Ventura, Los Angeles, and Orange counties, usually by directional drilling. The Wilmington Oil Field in Los Angeles and Long Beach was extended offshore into Long Beach Harbor by drilling numerous wells directionally from four artificial islands in the harbor. The drilling islands, owned by the City of Long Beach, are landscaped with palm trees.City of Long Beach: Historical - oil operations , accessed 30 Apr. 2009. Ownership of offshore oil and gas Oil platforms in the Long Beach area. The four small islands shown in Long Beach Harbor are artificial islands for oil and gas wells. Offshore oil and gas facilities in the Santa Barbara Channel The issue of state versus federal ownership has a long and contentious history (see Tidelands). The US Supreme Court ruled in 1947 that the federal government owned all the seabed off the California coast. However, the US Congress passed the Outer Continental Shelf Act in 1953, which recognized state ownership of the seabed within of the shore.Edgar Wesley Owen (1975) Trek of the Oil Finders, American Association of Petroleum Geologists, Memoir 6, p.801. In some cases, the state granted ownership of offshore seabed to the adjacent municipalities. In this way Long Beach was granted ownership of Long Beach Harbor in 1911. When the Wilmington field was discovered, Long Beach contracted with oil companies to produce oil from the city-owned offshore part of the field.Walker A. Tompkins, Little Giant of Signal Hill (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1964) p.112-115. Offshore development Oil production began from a man-made offshore island off Seal Beach in 1953. The first strictly offshore oil field in California was the Belmont Offshore Field, discovered in 1948 from the shore of Seal Beach; production did not begin until 1954 when a man-made island was built in 40 feet of water for drilling and production equipment.M.B. Smith and F.J. Schambeck (1966) ‚ÄúPetroleum and natural gas‚Äù in Mineral Resources of California, California Division of Mines and Geology, Bulletin 191, p.321-322. The first of ten federal offshore lease sales in California was held in 1963. Santa Barbara spill and aftermath The Union Oil Company discovered the Dos Cuadras oil field in federal waters of the Santa Barbara Channel in 1968, but success turned to disaster in 1969, when large quantities of oil began escaping to the sea floor near a drilling well in the field.Edgar Wesley Owen (1975) Trek of the Oil Finders, American Association of Petroleum Geologists, Memoir 6, p.689-690. The resulting oil slick came ashore along of coastline in Santa Barbara County, and turned public opinion against offshore drilling in California.Keith C. Clarke and Jeffrey J. Hemphill, \\"The Santa Barbara oil spill: a retrospective,\\", Yearbook of the Association of Pacific Coast Geographers, 2002, v.64, PDF file, downloaded 2 January 2010. In response to the oil spill, US Secretary of the Interior Walter Hickel removed of federal tracts near Santa Barbara from oil and gas leasing. Halting new offshore leasing California, like other states, owns and controls the mineral resources within of the coast. Leasing California state seabed is controlled by the California State Lands Commission, which halted further leasing of state offshore tracts after the Santa Barbara oil spill in 1969.California State Lands Commission: Chiand issues statement on new Tranquillon Ridge offshore oil development, PDF file, retrieved 19 February 2009. In 1994 the California legislature codified the ban on new leases by passing the California Coastal Sanctuary Act, which prohibited new leasing of state offshore tracts. The federal government continued to hold offshore lease sales through 1982.Congress Allows Moratorium on Offshore Drilling to Expire, PDF file, retrieved 31 July 2012. Then the US Congress directed that no federal funds be used to lease additional federal tracts off the coast of California. Congress repeated the moratorium on new leases every year until September 2008, when an appropriations bill passed the House and Senate without the ban; however, no federal lease sales have been proposed for offshore California since the ban was lifted. A lawsuit by the state of California prevented the federal government from allowing development on 36 federal leases issued before the congressional moratorium. The federal government voided 29 of the contested leases by repaying $1.1 million in lease bonuses; the seven additional federal leases have not been resolved, but remain inactive because of the litigation. The Minerals Management Service estimates that the seven undeveloped leases contain of recoverable oil and of recoverable gas.Minerals Management Service: Undeveloped leases, accessed 29 July 2009. In 1990, President George H. W. Bush issued an executive moratorium banning new federal leasing through the year 2000 in many offshore areas, including California. In 1998, President Bill Clinton extended the moratorium through 2012. In July 2008, President George W. Bush rescinded the executive order. Tranquillon Ridge field Offshore oil and gas facilities off Point Arguello, California Although leasing in state waters has been prohibited since 1994, the law allows exceptions when petroleum under state lands is being drained by nearby wells on non-state tracts; no such exceptions have been made to date. In 2008 both Plains Exploration & Production (PXP) and ExxonMobil offered competing proposals to the state to drill wells into Tranquillon Ridge field, offshore Santa Barbara County. The Tranquillon Ridge field lies partly in state and partly in federal waters. Neither proposal entailed additional offshore surface structures. Plains proposed to drill wells directionally from their existing Irene Platform in federal waters. ExxonMobil proposed to drill directionally from wells onshore in Vandenberg Air Force Base.California State Lands Commission: Proposed Tranquillon Ridge oil and gas leases, accessed 9 February 2009. The Plains Exploration proposal was endorsed by the Environmental Defense Center and by Get Oil Out!Nick Welsh, \\"SB enviros endorse offshore oil proposal,\\" Santa Barbara Independent, 16 April 2008, accessed 9 February 2009.Environmental Defense Center: Fact sheet, PDF file, downloaded 9 February 2009. On 29 January 2009 the State Lands Commission denied the applications by a 2-1 vote. The reason given for the denial was that \\"approving the lease request would send a message that additional drilling is possible off the California coast.\\" County of Santa Barbara Planning and Development, Energy Division: PXP Tranquillon Ridge and Pt. Pedernales, accessed March 18, 2014. In July 2009 Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger proposed allowing oil production from the state portion of Tranquillon Ridge field, as a way to increase state revenue, which would include a $100 million up-front payment to the state.Kurtis Alexander, \\"State plan for Santa Barbara oil drilling could set precedent for entire coast\\", San Jose Mercury News, 23 July 2009.Santa Maria Times, \\"Local oil drilling part of state budget deal\\", 23 July 2009.

On 3 May 2010, governor Schwarzenegger, reacting to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, withdrew his support for the Tranquillon Ridge drilling plan, stating, \\"I see on TV the birds drenched in oil, the fishermen out of work, the massive oil spill and oil slick destroying our precious ecosystem.\\" Current activity Platform Harvest, in the Point Arguello field in federal waters from Point Conception, has produced more than of oil and gas.Minerals Management Service Despite the long-term bans on new leasing in state (since 1969) and federal waters (since 1984), drilling and production have continued on existing leases, from existing drilling and production platforms. Nine active offshore drilling and production locations remain in state and municipal waters: one platform and one artificial island in the Santa Barbara Channel, and four artificial islands and three platforms from the offshore portion of the Wilmington Oil Field in San Pedro Bay/Long Beach Harbor. The first artificial offshore island, for Belmont Offshore Field, was removed in 1999.California State Lands Commission, Belmont Island decommissioning project, May 2002. Twenty-three offshore drilling and production platforms remain in federal waters, producing 22 million barrels of oil and 21 billion cubic feet of gas per year (as of 2009).Bureau of Ocean Energy management, Pacific region facts and figures Future potential Several large, undeveloped offshore oil fields have been discovered; see first map in this article. Seven undeveloped leases are estimated to contain one billion barrels (0.16 km3) of recoverable oil and 500 billion cubic feet (14 km3) of recoverable gas.

Chinese immigrants have introduced it to the United States, where it is known as \\"spicy soup\\". It can be divided into two different versions in Henan: Xiaoyaozhen version (from a town near Zhoukou City) and Beiwudu version. As its name literally the characters 'pepper' + 'capsicum/chilli' + 'soup' implies, capsicum and black pepper are put into the broth made by beef soup.  History  The exact origin of the soup cannot be accurately pinpointed now, but since the pepper, the main ingredient of the soup was not introduced to China until the Tang Dynasty. The soup was dubbed came into being after that, around Song Dynasty. Along the decades, the soup has evolved into a good many variations in different parts of China, according to local people's flavor and preferences, but the most basic and characteristic thing about the soup has never changed, that it is heavily seasoned with pepper and the texture of the soup is outstandingly thick and sticky. In addition to pepper, some herbs and flavourings such as ginger, aniseed and fennel are added into the boiling soup to improve the flavour and make it spicy and hot. In modern China, especially for northerners, hulatang is a popular breakfast dish. A bowl of soup usually starts at four Yuan, but can be more expensive depending on the fame of the restaurant, quality and variety of its ingredients.  Variation  A restaurant specializing in Hulatang in Zhengzhou  Beiwudu Hulatang  The Hulatang in Beiwudu is boiled with dozens of spices, thus the color of the soup is dark. And it tastes very hot because of the black peppers. Another name of Beiwudu Hulatang is ‚Äúeight treasures soup‚Äù, which means there are many ingredients in it. Usually the ingredients includes gluten, kelp, vermicelli, peanut, pepper and so on.  Xiaoyaozhen Hulatang  The main difference between the soups is the usage of different spices. People can not tell what exact the proportional difference is between Beiwudu and Xiaoyaozhen. But the Xiaoyaozhen hot pepper soup is more prevailing as people in Xiaoyaozhen migrate to other place. Xiaoyaozhen used to be an important town because of the prosperity of canal transportation in Song Dynasty. So, the Hulatong spreads with those people who earn their living outside their hometown. And Xiaoyaozhen is one of the most important genre of Hulatang now.  Xi'an Hulatang with Meatballs  Xi'an Hulatang also has a long history, it develops as people migrate between Shaanxi and Henan. People in Xi'an change some ingredients in the soup. They put meatballs, potatoes, carrots, celery and many other vegetables into the soup which makes it suits the local flavor.  Ingredients  Cooked beef, beef soup, flour, vermicelli, kelp, spinach, pepper, ginger, salt, vinegar and sesame oil.  Value and influence in modern time  The industrialization of producing the Hulatang brings a lot of benefits to normal people. For example, people in Xiaoyaozhen now pack the ingredients and spices up and sell them to the people all around the world through E-commerce platforms. To make the little packages, the demanded quantity of beef and mutton, as well as the quantity of workers in Xiaoyaozhen raised dramatically. The industrialization of Hulatang has provided lots of jobs for the residents. The government are also trying to help those people in poverty start up their own business of selling the soup.

Rulloff (also known as Ruloff, Rulofson, or Rulloffson, as well as several aliases; 1819/1820 ‚Äì May 18, 1871) was an American doctor, lawyer, schoolmaster, photographer, inventor, carpet designer, phrenologist, and philologist, in addition to a career criminal and serial killer. This dichotomy was exemplified in the title of his 1871 biography, The Man of Two Lives. He was also known as \\"The Genius Killer\\". Rulloff's brain is said to be the second largest brain on record,New York Times, Nov. 7, 1972, p. 37 with a volume of 1673 cm3. It can be seen on display at the Wilder Brain Collection in the psychology department of Cornell University in Ithaca, New York.  Early life  Rulloff was born near Saint John, New Brunswick, to German immigrant parents. His brother was photographer William Rulofson. Rulloff's \\"two lives\\" were both premature: by the time he was twenty years old, he had already worked in a law firm and served two years in prison for embezzlement. In 1842 he moved to Dryden in Upstate New York, where he worked as a school teacher and studied botanical medicine with Dr. Henry W. Bull. The following year, Rulloff impulsively married Bull's seventeen-year-old cousin, Harriet Schutt, with no formal courtship and against the wishes of Schutt's family, who considered Rulloff beneath their station. Rulloff was a jealous, possessive husband. After witnessing his wife kissing Bull once, Rulloff took her aside and produced a vial, telling her that it contained poison, and that he had used an identical one to kill his niece and sister-in-law, who had died earlier under Rulloff's medical care. He ordered her to drink from it, telling her that they would die together. When she screamed for help, he attempted to calm her, telling her that it was a joke.  Murders of Harriet and Priscilla Rulloff  The couple moved to Lansing, New York, where Harriet gave birth to a girl, Priscilla. Rulloff wanted to be farther away from his wife's family and he pressured her to move to Ohio, where he planned to work as a lawyer or college professor. When Harriet refused and threatened to return to her family with their daughter, on June 22, 1844, Rulloff accused her of having an affair with Bull and fatally hit her on the head with a pestle. Rulloff decided to commit suicide, but he found himself incapable. The next day, Rulloff borrowed a horse and wagon from his neighbors, the Andersons, with the pretense of returning a wooden chest to his uncle. Besides the chest, the Andersons saw Rulloff placing a half-full sack or pillow case in the wagon, and subsequently driving toward Cayuga Lake, in the direction opposite of his declared destination. When Rulloff returned, still with the chest, he told Mrs. Anderson that he and his wife would be out of town for a couple of weeks, and left his house in complete disarray. Rulloff returned amid rumors that he had killed his wife. Confronted by the Schutts, he denied any murder and claimed first that his wife had abandoned him, then that they had moved to Ohio together. Neither statement was believed because Harriet's clothes and personal items had been found in the house, implying that she had not left on her own accord. Rulloff fled a second time, but he was pursued by his brother- in-law, Ephraim Schutt, who had him apprehended and brought to Ithaca to stand trial for murder. Cayuga Lake was dredged in an attempt to locate the bodies, but they were never found. As the grand jury was unwilling to indict Rulloff for murder without a body, he was instead accused of kidnapping his wife. Rulloff conducted his own defense at his trial, in 1846, focusing on the lack of evidence that any crime had been committed. Nevertheless, he was found guilty and sentenced to ten years with hard labor in Auburn Prison. While incarcerated, Rulloff taught himself philology and formulated his own theory about language evolution, that he intended to publish under the title The Great Secret in Philology after his release. He was even allowed to teach students in his own cell. However, his hopes of starting a career in the field were dashed when he was informed that Tompkins County would charge him with the murder of his wife as soon as he was released. Rulloff claimed double jeopardy and started a legal battle from jail. The district attorney dropped the charge for Harriet Rulloff's murder, but replaced it with one for Priscilla's. Rulloff was in turn found guilty of this crime in 1858, but he escaped custody before the verdict reached him.  Life after his escape  Rulloff was likely assisted in his escape by the son of Ithaca's undersheriff, Albert Jarvis, who had been tutored in Greek and Latin by Rulloff, and would later become his partner in crime; or by Jarvis's mother Jane, who had also befriended Rulloff, and publicly manifested her disbelief about him being a murderer. Whatever the case, Rulloff fled west, alone and on foot. He fed on wild nuts and food stolen from farms, and lost two toes to frostbite. Reaching Meadville, Pennsylvania, he introduced himself to local inventor A. B. Richmond under the alias \\"James Nelson\\", and convinced him to start a business partnership after Rulloff brandished his knowledge in subjects as varied as conchology, mineralogy, forensic anthropology and entomology. Rulloff made a similar impression at Jefferson College, and was about to take a professorship when Jarvis wrote him, informing him that his mother and himself were now destitute, and threatening him if he did not help them out. Rulloff robbed a jewelry store with the intention of giving the bounty to the Jarvises, but he was arrested and sent back to Ithaca. In spite of being a murder convict, a fugitive, and a robber, Rulloff appealed his murder conviction successfully, was acquitted, and was released after authorities decided to not prosecute him for other offenses. Rulloff moved to New York City with Jarvis, where they survived as burglars. In 1861, Rulloff was arrested and sentenced to serve two years and a half in Sing Sing Prison. There he met his second partner in crime, William T. Dexter. In 1869, Rulloff learned of the forthcoming first convention of the American Philological Association in Poughkeepsie, and sent a manuscript detailing his theory in language evolution, which he titled Method in the Formation of Language. He used the alias \\"Professor Euri Lorio\\", and announced his intention to auction the manuscript for a starting sum of $500,000. Although Rulloff believed that his findings would revolutionize the field, the Association rejected them and none of its members bid for the text.  Murder of Frederick Merrick  Rulloff, Jarvis and Dexter's next plan was the robbery of a dry goods store in Binghamton, New York in 1870, while the two live-in clerks, Frederick Merrick and Gilbert Burrows, slept upstairs. The trio burned chloroform in an attempt to ensure that the employees would sleep through the ordeal, but they awoke when Jarvis stumbled on something. Merrick first attempted to shoot Rulloff with a gun that he kept under his pillow, but it failed to discharge. After that, he grabbed a stool and threw it at the fleeing Rulloff. Meanwhile, Burrows grabbed Dexter and proceeded to beat him. When Merrick joined Burrows, Jarvis and Rulloff came to Dexter's rescue, and Rulloff fired a warning shot in to the air. Burrows stopped, but Merrick threw himself at Jarvis. Rulloff fired a second warning shot, and when Merrick would not desist, he pointed the gun at Merrick's head and fired, killing him instantly. In their disorderly escape, the robbers missed the boat that was to ferry them across the Chenango River, and instead attempted to swim across the river. The exhausted Jarvis and Dexter were unable to keep up with the current and drowned. Their bodies were recovered in the morning. Rulloff made it across, but he left behind a couple of leather boots with a distinctive depression where his missing toes would have been.  Arrest and execution  Alerted by Burrows, the Binghamton police organized patrols and rounded up men that looked suspicious. Rulloff made himself a suspect the next morning, when he ignored a request to identify himself at the local railroad station and ran across the train tracks to a nearby farm's outhouse, where he was captured. Rulloff identified himself first as \\"Charles Augustus\\", and later as \\"George Williams\\". He was brought before the bodies of Dexter and Jarvis, which had been publicly displayed to help identify them; he denied knowing them. However, Rulloff himself was recognized by another onlooker, Judge Ransom Balcom, who said: \\"You are Edward H. Rulloff. You murdered your wife and child in Lansing in 1845 [sic].\\" He then turned to the authorities and warned: \\"This man understands his rights better than you do, and will defend them to the last.\\" Documents found on Dexter's and Jarvis's bodies later led investigators to a Brooklyn apartment owned by Rulloff under yet another name, Edward C. Howard. Rulloff's trial began on January 4, 1871. It became a sensation that attracted crowds of 2,000 people daily. Some, such as the director of the New York Tribune, Horace Greeley, believed that a man with the evident intellectual prowess of Rulloff was too valuable to be executed and should be spared, regardless of his guilt. Rulloff himself, who led his own defense again, refused to plead insanity and requested that Governor John T. Hoffman either pardon him or delay his execution until his theory on language evolution was fully developed, claiming that he would be ready to die after that. Mark Twain wrote a letter to the Tribune in which he satirized the requests of clemency for Rulloff, stating his willingness to produce a different man that would admit to Rulloff's crime and be executed in his place. On March 3, Rulloff was found guilty and sentenced to hang. While on death row, he confessed to the murder of his wife and described it in detail, but he never admitted to having killed his daughter. This caused some speculation that he had sent her to live with relatives under a different name and had not killed her. Rulloff's execution on May 18, 1871 was not the last public hanging in New York state. Some sources claim he gave a speech on the gallows, ending with \\"Hurry it up! I want to be in hell in time for dinner.\\" Other sources say that his only statement was \\"I can't stand still.\\" His brain was taken to Cornell University after his execution, where a professor, Burt Wilder, declared Rulloff's brain to be the largest on record (at that time).

Originally built as the Redoubt San Dionisio or Redoubt Saint Dionysius ( or , r Fort or Redut Svyatogo Dionisiya) in 1834, the site was transferred to the British-owned Hudson's Bay Company as part of a lease signed in the region in 1838, and renamed Fort Stikine when turned into a Hudson's Bay Company post in 1839. The post was closed and decommissioned by 1843 but the name remained for the large village of the Stikine people which had grown around it, becoming known as Shakesville in reference to its ruling Chief Shakes by the 1860s. With the Alaska Purchase of 1867, the fortification became occupied by the US Army and was renamed Fort Wrangel, a reference to Baron von Wrangel, who had been Governor of Russian America when the fort was founded. The site today is now part of the city of Wrangell. Russian American Company By a decree of Emperor Paul I known as the Ukase of 1799, the Russian Empire asserted ownership of the Pacific coast and adjoining lands of North America as far south as the 55th degree of latitude, with Novo-Arkhangelsk (modern Sitka) founded shortly thereafter. In 1821, Emperor Alexander issued another ukase which extended the Russian claim south to 51 degrees north, also forbidding foreign vessels from approaching within 100 Italian miles of any Russian settlement. Other powers protested and the line was withdrawn to \\"the line of the Emperor Paul\\", 55 degrees north, with parallel treaties with the United States and Great Britain (in 1824 and 1825 respectively) adjusting that southwards slightly to 54 degrees 40 minutes north so as to include all of Prince of Wales Island within Russian territory. Under the Russo-British Treaty of 1825 (Treaty of St. Petersburg) establishing that boundary, and also establishing a land boundary northwards following the summit of the mountains, ten marine leagues from the coast, British rights to the Interior were guaranteed by Russia, along with the right of navigation of the Taku and Stikine Rivers, which were (and largely still are) the only access to those regions of what is now northern British Columbia. The HBC governing committee, led by Sir John Pelly and Sir George Simpson, on 28 October 1829 sent instructions to the Columbia Department for a company detachment to occupy the Nass River with a new trade post.Galbraith, John S. The Hudson's Bay Company as an Imperial Factor, 1821 - 1869. Toronto: University of Toronto Press. 1857, pp. 142-143. Chief Factor John McLoughlin was to send the force of approximately 50 employees under Peter Skene Ogden. However the outbreak of an illness at Fort Vancouver, likely malaria,Boyd, Robert T. 'Another Look at the \\"Fever and Ague\\" of Western Oregon. Ethnohistory 22, No. 2 (1975), pp. 135-154. delayed the plan to establish a station until 1833. Visiting the mouth of the Nass in the summer 1831, Lieutenant Aemilius Simpson mistakenly that it was the entrance to the Babine River. HBC began to consider the location critical to establish a coastal supply chain to send provisions to Fort Babine. Redoubt Saint Dionysius Arvid Ethol√©n and a party of employees of the Russian American Company (RAC) were sent to the Nass on the Chichagof on 3 April 1833 by Chief Manager Baron Wrangel. Arriving back at New Archangel on 28, Ethol√©n reported the alarming news that Stikine people, while receptive to a Russian outpost, were also supportive a British station being established in the area.Galbraith (1957), pp. 145-147. The second article of the Russo-British Treaty of 1825 specified that employees of either company couldn't land at their respective stations without prior consent.International Environmental Law Reports, Vol. 1. ed. A. R. Robb. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. 1999, p. 560. To prevent the HBC traders from accessing the Stikine river, Wrangel conceived of creating a trade post at the river's mouth. In the autumn of 1833, a party of promyshlenniki under the commander of the Chichagof, Lieutenant Dionysius Zarembo, was dispatched south. RAC employees began constructing on the Stikine Strait a fort named the Redoubt Saint Dionysius or the Redoubt San Dionisio, usually thought to have been located on Zarembo Island, to ensure control of the local fur trade, critical to the economic basis of New Archangel. Ogden went up the Stikine on reconnaissance in 1833, finding the river too shallow for the HBC's sailing vessels. An additional exploration was ordered by in 1834 McLoughlin, with Ogden and several HBC staff, including William Fraser Tolmie, returning to the area on the brig Dryad. The employees were to begin attempts at establishing trade and a fort in the Stikine hinterland. On 20 June 1834 the HBC employees under Ogden reached Redoubt Saint Dionysius. Tolmie described the trading post as having a barricade 6 feet tall, a half completed house for the RAC officer and \\"a few cedarbark huts...\\" Discussions between the Russians and British was hampered as none of British could speak the Russian language and none of the Russians were fluent in Latin, English, or French.Tolmie, William Fraser The Journals of William Fraser Tolmie, Physician and Fur Trader. Vancouver, B.C.: Mitchell Press Limited. 1963, pp. 283-285. Zarembo gave Odgen a note in Russian that stated: > In the Year of 1834, the 18th of June. On the brig of the Columbia Company > of Mr. Ogan at Stakeen‚ÄîI prohibit to trade with the inhabitants of the > Stakeen which have their settlements here and accordingly refer to the > Convention.‚ÄîTo the Colonies of the Russian American Company, no permission > is given to trade. I neither allow to enter the river Stakeen in consequence > of the instructions received from Chief Director Baron Wrangel. During the ensuing confrontation and what would become a naval standoff, with the ships Chichagof and Orel dispatched from New Archangel, Ogden and his men were driven off and Hudson's Bay Company stores, intended for trade and the establishment of the upriver post, were seized. Hudson's Bay Company When news of the confrontation reached Fort Vancouver, McLoughlin was outraged and quickly sent word to the company headquarters in London. The HBC spent several years pressuring the British government to secure indemnities from the RAC on Russia for damages relating to the seizure and actions contrary to the treaty of 1825, Baron von Wrangel was forced out of office in disgrace because of the great cost in both money and prestige to the Empire. A treaty signed in 1839, known as the RAC-HBC Agreement, established the privilege for the HBC to build and maintain posts at the mouths of the Taku and Stikine as well as established a lease of the mainland and adjoining islands - the lisi√®re from Cross Sound south to 54 degrees 40 minutes north.\\"The Dryad Affair: Corporate Warfare and Anglo-Russian Rivalry for the Alaskan Lisi√®re\\", J. W. Shelest, ExploreNorth.com website In return for this lease, the HBC would supply so many furs per annum to the RAC and supply the Russian American settlements with equipment, agricultural and pastoral products. Creating the subsidiary Puget Sound Agricultural Company to met these provisions, HBC stations such as Forts Vancouver, Langley, Nisqually and Cowlitz were critical for manufacturing the produce required by the Russians. Establishment of Fort Stikine The following year, in 1839, James Douglas, later to be Chief Factor himself and also Governor of both Vancouver Island and British Columbia colonies, was sent north by McLoughlin to establish \\"Fort Stickeen\\" and what was formally called Fort Durham, but usually known as Fort Taku, or just Taku, under various spellings. Confrontations with the local group of Tlingit, the Shtakeen Kwaan (\\"Stikine Tribe\\") under Chief Shakes, near whose ceremonial clan house the fort had been erected, concerning control of the fur trade of the Stikine Country, led to the relocation of the principal village of that tribe to the location of the fort, and agreements with Shakes regarding control of trade in relation to other Tlingit groups and the inland Athapaskan peoples (the Tahltan, primarily) with whom the Stikines had long-standing agreements. Still, other tribes including the Haida, Nisga'a and Tsimshian traded at the post, with complicated consequences. Much to the chagrin and horror of the company staff in charge of the post, the logistics of the fur trade resulted in an unexpected effect - an escalation of the slave trade by the Haida and Tlingits. This had an accompanying rise among the Haida and Tlingits for further warfare and raiding against each other and tribes to the south. These were done to provide goods for the purchase of furs to re-sell to the HBC post. Death of John McLoughlin, Jr. The second Chief Trader appointed to Fort Stikine was the son of Chief Factor McLoughlin, John McLoughlin, Jr.. Unsuited to the appointment, the younger McLoughlin was unpopular with some of the Metis among the staff. Several staff members killed him on 21 April 1842 in what was alleged by them to have been in self-defense at his drunken rage. Hawaiian Kanaka employees who witnessed the killing were to testify otherwise. They alleged that the rebel staff, led by one Urbain Heroux, had conspired with the local Tlingits to seize the post. The usual laws governing the Company and its staff were those of the Colony of Canada. However, because the murder had happened on ostensibly Russian soil, these laws did not apply in this case. George Simpson arrived five days after the murder and held a short investigation. He found the murder \\"justifiable homicide\\", and took Heroux and the others to the Russian American capital of Novo-Arkhangelsk for trial. While still at Novo-Arkhangelsk Simpson was surprised to encounter Heroux at liberty on the streets. Unlike British colonial law, the accused were free until convicted under Russian law. They were ultimately not prosecuted by Governor of Russian Colonies in America Ferdinand von Wrangel and released by the spring of 1844 for lack of evidence. John Jr.'s death was said to be one of the factors embittering his father against Simpson and the HBC. Author Debra Komar wrote an investigative history into the death of McLoughlin Jr. named The Bastard of Fort Stikine (Goose Lane Editions 2015). In it, Komar uses both forensic science and historical research to create a narrative of both Fort Stikine and the Canadian North. Closure The process of increased slave raids by Tlingit and Haida was seen as a large problem by HBC management and grounds for closing the post. An additional issue seen was the viability of the local fur bearing populations, which was in question. Governor Simpson held a tour of HBC locations across North America in 1841. After he reviewed regional operations, Simpson ordered Fort Stikine and the adjacent posts of Fort McLoughlin and Fort Durham to be closed. Only Fort Simpson was to be maintained, which with the steamship Beaver was seen as able to maintain a more profitable trade in the region compared to maintaining four permanent stations. Fort Simpson was located first near the mouth of the Nass. It was later moved to a more strategic location near today's Prince Rupert, off the mouth of the Skeena (today's Lax Kw'alaams). Later period In the company's absence, Chief Shakes took control of the post and of the Stikine River trade. Discovery of gold in the Queen Charlotte Islands in 1850, and then in the Thompson Country and Fraser Canyon in the later 1850s, led to wider encroachments and exploration by whites far beyond the locus of the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush of 1858-1861. One intrepid adventurer, Alexander \\"Buck\\" Choquette, originally from Quebec and who had been in the California goldfields, had already explored in the area of the Nass and other rivers between there and the Stikine. Equipped with an acquired proficiency in the Chinook Jargon, Choquette was at Fort Victoria when he met some of Shakes' people and persuaded them to bring him with them to the Stikine and what was left of Fort Stikine, which had by then become known as Shakesville (though still also referred to as Fort Stikine despite the absence of a formal post or a Chief Trader). Choquette was to earn the respect of Shakes and also the hand of his daughter Georgiana (or Georgie) as his wife, with the marriage consecrated according to the elaborate ceremonials of Tlingit custom. Stikine Gold Rush In the spring of 1861, Choquette set out on a canoe trip up the Stikine with his wife and ten warriors of the Stikines to prospect for gold, discovering it at what has been known as Buck Bar since, just southwest of Telegraph Creek (the gold-rush settlement at Telegraph Creek was, in fact, known as Buck's Bar until the construction era of the unfinished Collins Overland Telegraph). When word of Choquette's discovery reached the other goldfields and the colonial capitals, the Stikine Gold Rush was launched and hordes of men sought out the Stikine, with Fort Stikine aka Shakesville become an important port-of-call for steamboats now bound for the river's many gold-bearing bars. In response to the influx of miners, most of them (but not all) American, Governor Douglas decreed the creation of the Stikine Territory, covering the lands inland from Russian American between the line of the Nass and Finlay Rivers north to the 62nd parallel to prevent American feared American annexation of the region, just as he had created the Colony of British Columbia in similar circumstances and had witnessed the loss of the Oregon Country to American settlers previously. Experienced from goldfields elsewhere, Choquette knew more money was to be made in provision of goods and supplies to the miner than in the workings themselves, and obtained rights to sell Hudson's Bay Company wares both at his upriver post and at a revived trading post at Shakesville. Choquette was to maintain this post in an uneasy relationship with the Hudson's Bay Company, as well as his store upriver, which relocated at various times depending on fluctuations in the activity of the rush. Although exploration and some mining continued, the rush was well over by 1867, when the United States purchased Alaska from the Russian Empire. Despite the profitability of American trade and a wider range of goods, Choquette was faced with the decision of retaining the Hudson's Bay Company license and the freedom from American taxation that came with it by moving to just within British territory, which is to say, ten marine leagues upriver (approximately 30 km). Choosing a site opposite the Great Glacier, Choquette opened another store near the confluence of what became known as the Choquette River near the Stikine Hot Springs (see also Boundary Range). In time, Choquette would be given charge of a customs post and Hudson's Bay outlet, though opted eventually to remain at his preferred location, which he named Ice Mountain (his name for the Great Glacier). Fort Wrangel Village of Wrangel Alaska (Tlingit: ·∏¥aachxÃ±aana.√°ak ºw) in 1868 - in present-day Front Street. With Choquette's departure, and the British flag with him, which had flown over his store at Shakesville, American troops took over the old fortification of Fort Stikine, renaming it Fort Wrangel. It was the second US Army post established in Alaska, the first being Fort Tongass on Tongass Island, immediately north of 54¬∞40', but which was abandoned by 1870 as being of little real strategic or commercial value, as it was Fort Wrangel which controlled the main access inland and was therefore more viable as a customs port for the region, and Britain had shown no signs of military support for the claims that British Columbia had been making for its rights to the leased portion of the Panhandle, which had in any case been overtaken by American fishing, cannery and mining operations in the immediate aftermath of the Purchase. The Wrangell Bombardment occurred on 25 December 1869 when a Stikine Indian named Lowan bit off Mrs. Jaboc Muller's third right finger, and was killed in an ensuing fight by soldiers who mortally wounded an additional Stikine Indian. The following morning, Scutd-doo, who was the father of the deceased, entered the fort and shot the post trader's partner Leon Smith fourteen times. Smith died some 13 hours later. The US army made an ultimatum demanding Sccutd-doo's surrender, and following bombardment of the Stikine Indian village, the villagers handed Scutd-doo over to the military in the fort, where he was court-martialed and publicly hanged before the garrison and assembled natives on 29 December,The Aleut Internments of World War II: Islanders Removed from Their Homes by the United States, Russell W. Estlack, page 53 stating before he was hanged that he had acted in revenge against the occupants of the fort for the killing of Lowan and not against Smith in particular.The 1869 Bombardment of ·∏¥aachxÃ±an.√°ak ºw from Fort Wrangell: U.S. Army Response to Tlingit Law, Wrangell, Alaska (Washington DC: American Battlefield Preservation Program; Juneau, AK: Sealaska Heritage Institute, 2015).

Morrison, Carroll Spear Morrison, 1965, page 310 Fort Wrangel again became a source of tension between American and British authorities in the region when more gold was discovered near Dease Lake in 1870, leading to the Cassiar Gold Rush of 1871. Once again thousands of miners poured into and through Fort Wrangel, and the US authorities attempted to exert control over British- registered shipping heading for the Stikine. A compromise was reached, and the confrontation derailed and prevented from escalating into warfare over the region. After the Cassiar rush was over, Fort Wrangel remained as one of the main US military installations in the region, and was again to play a strategic as well as a commercial role in relation to the Stikine's use as one of the lesser routes to the Klondike from 1897 and the mounting tensions of the Alaska Boundary Dispute, which was resolved by arbitration in 1903.

Its objective was to conduct science and technology research that would secure advancements in the engineering of the gas turbine engines used in military aircraft. It ran from 1987 until 2005. IHPTET designated goals in each of three engine classes: turbofan/turbojet, turboprop/turboshaft, and expendable engines. For the turbofan class the primary goal was to double the engine thrust-to-weight ratio. The program made many significant developments which have been employed in such aircraft as the F-35 / Joint Strike Fighter. It was firmly regarded as successful although it did not fully achieve its explicit goals. It was succeeded by the Versatile Affordable Advanced Turbine Engines (VAATE) program.

This can include information such as how to get a license, license renewal, road laws, driving restrictions, etc. \\"In the U.S. there is no central organization that is responsible for the creation of Driver's Manuals.\\" (Idaho Driver's Manual). As a result, there is no set of rules for the states to create the manuals, so all driver's manuals vary by state. However, every state does still follow general guidelines when creating the manuals. The beginning of every manual starts with how to get a driver's license. It informs us about what types of identification is needed, and who is eligible to apply for a license. In most states, you \\"must provide documentary proof of their full legal name, age, Social Security number, citizenship, or legal presence and address.\\" (Ohio Driver's Manual). In all states there is a minimum age requirement for getting a driver's permit, which later leads into receiving a full driver's license. This age limit varies by state. \\"The person must also be in good general health, and can have good vision with or without glasses or contacts.\\"(New Jersey Driver's Manual). There is also usually a payment fee in order to receive your license. Along with getting a license, all states also offer voter registration and becoming an organ donor when applying for your license. Every state requires taking a written test to receive your driver's permit. Every state also requires a driver's test that you must pass in order to get your license. However, only a few of the states' manuals actually go into detail about what exactly they will test you on for the driving test. All manuals proceed to talk about the specifics of how to drive and the rules of the road. Every manual includes a section that goes into detail about car and driver safety. All states require vehicle inspection, but only some require annual inspection. Driving while intoxicated is illegal in the United States. Almost all states have a \\"minimum blood alcohol level while driving of .08%\\" (Kentucky Driver's Manual). For seat belts, 49 states and the District of Columbia have passed laws requiring seat belt use by at least all occupants of the front seat. New Hampshire is the only state with no such requirement for adults. However, in all states anyone under the age of 18 is required to wear a seat belt. Vehicles must always make way for emergency vehicles.

It won the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury (Giuseppe Tornatore) and was nominated for Golden Palm (Giuseppe Tornatore) at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival. It also won the David di Donatello Awards for David Best Music (Ennio Morricone) and the Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists for Silver Ribbon Best Original Story (Giuseppe Tornatore). The film was remade in 2009 as Everybody's Fine with an American setting and starring Robert De Niro, and again in 2016 in China also as Everybody's Fine in 2016. Plot Matteo Scuro, a retired Sicilian bureaucrat and opera buff, has been stood up by his five adult children during the summer vacation, all of whom live in various cities on the Italian mainland with what he believes are responsible jobs. Despite their not visiting and the neighbours' criticisms, he remains optimistic, considering that his children could not come because they are too busy. His children are named after popular opera characters, Tosca for Puccini's Tosca, Canio for Leoncavallo's Pagliacci, Norma for Bellini's Norma, Guglielmo for Rossini's Guglielmo Tell and Alvaro for Verdi's La forza del destino. He decides to surprise each of them with a visit, traveling by train, and finds none of them as he imagined, with each of his children seeming to reflect the opera character after whom they were named. Matteo's train journeys take him to Naples, Rome, Florence, Milan and Turin to search for each of his children; he even spends one night on the streets among the homeless. Before his arrival at each of their homes, each of his grown children scramble to put on a fa√ßade to cover up their personal failings: One daughter's ex-husband temporarily moves back in with her and their child. A son who lost his University professorship temporarily moves back into his old office. Another daughter hides the fact that she works as a lingerie model, etc. Finally, after visiting all his children, Scuro returns to Sicily, visits his wife's grave, and reports to her with irony that their children are all fine.

Biography   Opposition to Priscus Attalus  The first known act of Heraclianus was the killing of the powerful Magister militum Stilicho (August 22, 408) for Emperor Honorius, who wanted to remove his influential general. Honorius rewarded Heraclianus with the appointment to the rank of Comes Africae, Governor of the important province of Africa, in late 408.Jones, pg. 539 According to Orosius, Heraclianus was sent to Africa in 409. Orosius also states that the Governor of Africa in 408 was \\"John\\", who was killed by the people of his province.Orosius, 7:42:10 However, in another account, Zosimus states that Heraclianus was the successor of Bathanarius, brother-in-law of Stilicho, put to death by Honorius.Zosimus, 5:37:6 Coin minted by Priscus Attalus. In 409, with the help of the Visigoths of King Alaric I, Priscus Attalus rebelled against Honorius, whose seat of power was in Ravenna, and set up his own court in Rome.Bury, pg. 117 Heraclianus remained loyal to Honorius and tightly controlled African ports to restrict the grain supply to the city of Rome and starve Rome out.Bury, pg. 120 Attalus did not initially send an army in Africa against Heraclianus, as it would have to have been under Visigothic lead.Bury, pg. 120 Deceived by false prophecies or moved by his own jealousy of the Visigoths, he sent a lone representative, Constans, counting on his authority alone to depose Heraclianus or convince the provincials to rebel.Bury, pg. 119 However, Constans was killed,Bury, pg. 119 and Heraclianus sent Honorius the great sum he had confiscated from the envoys, intended to bribe the local population.Zosimus, 6:10:2 Alaric wanted to send an army against Heraclianus under the command of his own man Drumas. But, Attalus opposed this, and Alaric deposed him in 410.Bury, pg. 120 As Alaric intended to send a rather small army of only 500 men, it is probable that Heraclianus had only a very small force at his own disposal. However, it is also probable that Heraclianus had the support of the local population, as Emperor Honorius had recently issued a tolerance edict in favour of the Donatists, a Christian sect very popular in Africa.After Attalus' deposition, Honorius renewed the persecution against the Donatists, sending to Heraclianus an edict that nullified the previous one. According to the historian Adrian Goldsworthy, Attalus sent a Roman commander with regular troops to secure the province of Africa, but these were seriously defeated by the Roman troops of Heraclianus, who for the time being remained loyal to the Emperor Honorius.Adrian Goldsworthy, The Fall of the West: The Slow Death of the Roman Superpower, paperback edition published in 2010 by Phoenix, an imprint of Orion Books Ltd, London, p.300.  Usurpation against Honorius  The Byzantine Emperor Honorius, Jean-Paul Laurens, 1880. In 412 Heraclianus was designated for the consulate of the year 413, but in all probability he was never appointed Consul: confident in his own power and instigated by Sabinus,Orosius. his son-in-law, he rebelled against Honorius and proclaimed himself Augustus.Bury, pg. 146 His first act was to interrupt the grain supply to the city of Rome, as he had successfully done against Priscus Attalus.Orosius, 7:42:12 Next he gathered several ships along with troops to invade Italy.Bury, pg. 146 Honorius had Heraclianus and his supporters proclaimed enemies of the State and condemned to death with an edict issued in Ravenna on July 7, 412.Jones, pg. 540 In 413 Heraclianus arrived in Italy with a large army to fight Honorius, but he was defeated and killed. With regards to his death, there are two versions: According to some sources, Heraclianus arrived in Italy and moved towards Rome, but he was frightened by the arrival of Comes Marinus. He left his army and fled to Carthage, where he was put to death on March 7.Orosius; Marcellinus. The second version sees Heraclianus defeated at Utriculum (maybe Oriculum, in Umbria, halfway between Rome and Ravenna), in a battle with 50,000 deaths, then fleeing to Carthage, where he would be put to death by envoys sent by Honorius in the temple of Memoria.Hydatius. Sabinus, Heraclianus' son-in-law, fled to the eastern court at Constantinople but was later sent back and then exiled.Jones, pg. 968 Heraclianus' name does not appear in the Fasti consulares, the list of all Roman consuls, as Honorius probably revoked his appointment and left Lucius as Consul without colleague.Jones, pg. 540 Heraclianus' acts were revoked; his possessions, 2,000 lb of gold and land of the same value, were confiscated and given to Flavius Constantius.Jones, pg. 540 Jerome accused Heraclianus of mistreating those who had fled from Rome to Carthage on the occasion of Attalus' usurpation (Heraclianus imprisoned the noblewomen Anicia Faltonia Proba, Anicia Iuliana and Demetrias, and freed them only after a huge payment), and of being a drunken and corrupt man.Jerome, Ep. 130.7  Notes   Bibliography   Primary sources  * Jerome, Epistulae, 130.7; Dialogus contra Pelagianos, 3.19; Commentaria in Ezechielem, 9.28 * Jordanes, Romana, 325 * Hydatius, Chronicon, 51,56 * Marcellinus Comes, Chronicon, sub anno 413 * Olympiodorus of Thebes, frammento 23 * Orosius, Historiae adversum Paganos, 7.29,42 * Procopius of Caesarea, Guerra vandalica, 1.2.30.36 * Prosper of Aquitaine, sub anno 413 * Sozomen, 9.8.3-7 * Theophanes the Confessor, AM 5904 * Zosimus, Historia Nova, 5.37; 6.7-11 * Chronica Gallica of 452, 75  Secondary sources  * Jones, Arnold Hugh Martin, John Robert Martindale, John Morris, The Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire, \\"Heraclianus 3\\", volume 2, Cambridge University Press, 1992, , pp. 539‚Äì540. * Bury, J.

In the process, he earned a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series in 1979, becoming the first actor from the show as well as the first African American to earn the award. Freeman later earned nominations in the category of Outstanding Supporting Actor in 1986 and 1987. The actor briefly reprised the role in 1988 and 2000. Major storyline 1972‚Äì74 Freeman first appears in the role of Lieutenant Hall in January 1972 when Hall begins to lead an investigation into the murder of Marcy Wade (Francesca James), a secretary for the Lord family newspaper, The Banner. For the previous year, Marcy masqueraded around Llanview as \\"Niki Smith\\", the alter-ego and symptom of publishing heiress Viki Lord Riley's (Erika Slezak) dissociative identity disorder, hoping to create a rift in the budding relationship between Viki and new executive editor Steve Burke (Bernard Grant). Later in a hostage situation that involves Steve, Marcy holds Vinny Wolek (Antony Ponzini) hostage. Steve struggles with Marcy for the gun and accidentally, but fatally, wounds her. Though Steve vows he did not murder her, Lt. Hall develops a theory that Steve and Marcy were carrying on an illicit affair without Viki's knowledge, and when Marcy was to tell Viki that Steve killed her. Steve is indicted and charged with first-degree murder. Steve's conviction is only halted for the Only Marcy‚Äôs purse, containing an incriminating note saying that Niki Smith planned to kill Vince Wolek, could save him. Steve is later exonerated when a presumed dead Joe Riley (Lee Patterson) reappears possessing Marcy Wade's purse. In his downtime after the investigation, Ed Hall courts Carla Gray (Ellen Holly). Supercouple Ed (Freeman) and Carla (Holly), In 1973, siblings-in-law Meredith Lord Wolek (Lynn Benesch) and Vinny, and baby Daniel Wolek were taken hostage by thieves in the Llanfair carriage house. During hostage negotiations with Ed, the burglars demand the Llanview Police Department arrange for a plane to transport them to South America, where they would later release the hostages. One of the criminals shoots the other. Meredith attempts to escape and is fatally injured after falling on her head against the edge of a table. The other robber is killed by the Llanview Police while attempting to escape, and Vince and Daniel escape alive. Lieutenant Hall makes a great impression on Carla, causing her to end her budding romance with politico Bert Skelly. Meanwhile, Ed mentors downtrodden youth Joshua \\"Josh\\" West (Laurence Fishburne). Ed would later propose marriage, and although Carla was enamored with Ed's integrity and his devotion toward the mentorship of Josh, Carla fell deeper in love with Ed, but grew troubled with the prospect of being in a relationship with the life-threatening work of law enforcement. Unable to ignore her feelings, she accepts his proposal in March 1973. Ed and Carla adopt Josh together in April 1974. When the wedding date approaches, family members of Ed and Carla began receiving anonymous threats. Carla feels her life threatened when her car brakes are cut, and their now-adoptive son Josh is informed he would be retaliated against for the death of the victim of a Llanview murder investigation. Vince discovers the veiled threats are from a recently released mental institution patient named Lester Brock. Before word can get out, Lester calls Carla, telling her Ed wants to meet her at the jewelry store that afternoon. Unknown to Carla, she goes to the jewelry store, where she is almost shot at, save for the quick action of Joe Riley (Lee Patterson). After the ruckus, Ed, Vince, and other Llanview officers arrive at the scene, arresting Lester. Following the trying travail, Ed and Carla continue with their plans to marry. On October 5, 1974, Ed and Carla marry with Josh as Ed's best man and real-life jazz singer Hazel Scott as Carla's aunt and maid of honor in the first on-screen wedding of Black characters on soap operas. 1979‚Äì85 Ed is shot during a police altercation in 1979 by the estranged redneck husband of Becky Lee Abbott (Mary Gordon Murray), Luke Johnson. Luke was quickly apprehended and Ed rushed to Llanview Hospital, where the Lieutenant is operated on by newly arrived surgeon Dr. Jack Scott (Arthur Burghardt). Following hours of being in critical condition, Dr. Scott removes the bullet from a wound near Ed's heart. An overly grateful Carla falls in love with Dr. Jack as Ed's focused less attention on her at the height of the Marco Dane (Gerald Anthony) murder trial involving Karen Wolek (Judith Light). Ed was promoted to police captain, but not long afterwards Carla requests a divorce in 1979 to marry the surgeon who saved Ed's life, to which he concedes. Later, social climber and Llanview District Attorney Herb Callison runs as the fictional governor of Pennsylvania with Captain Hall as his running mate in 1980. In exchange for the manipulation of the election, undiscovered to Ed, Herb and fianc√©e Dr. Dorian Cramer Lord each obtain illegal campaign contributions from Asa Buchanan (Philip Carey). In January 1981, Ed uncovers the illegality in the election of Herb, the day he is to serve as a groomsman for Herb at his wedding. Herb and Ed are sworn-in as Governor and Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania, respectively, in February 1981. Soon afterwards, news of the political impropriety of Governor and First Lady Callison is revealed in the news, to the shame of Ed who resigns in the midst of the scandal. Herb soon follows, and with Ed's career ruined, he proceeded to pick up the pieces of his shattered life. Assuming work as a private investigator, Ed acquires a steady clientele of work. When the assumed father of the ward of Viki Lord, Tina Clayton (Andrea Evans) escapes from jail, he arrives in Llanview in search of Tina. Now a con artist, Ted seeks a way to gain the Lord family fortune by getting back into the good graces of Tina, who grew weary of her estranged father's attempts at bonding. Unsuccessful at getting Tina to regard him, Ted dons a wig and follows Tina to an art gallery. Attempting to seriously harm Tina, Ed shoots and kills the disguised Ted after it is uncovered that he killed now-Llanview Police Lieutenant Vince Wolek. Ed is rehired by the Llanview Police Department later that year. In 1982, the rapist of Karen Wolek, deranged Dr. Ivan Kipling, implants brain chips into the heads of Karen's ex-husband Dr. Larry Wolek (Michael Storm) and later Ed, hoping to manipulate the two men and kidnap to South America. Dr. Kipling's caper was foiled when the chips were removed from Ed and Larry's heads and Karen rescued. Freeman was fired from the series in 1987 by OLTL executive producer Paul Rauch, following in a series of administrative moves by Rauch which ultimately removed regular African American cast members. Leading black cast members would be absent from the series until new executive producer Linda Gottlieb and headwriter Michael Malone introduced Hank Gannon, played by actor Nathan Purdee, in 1992.

The specific epithet reptans refers to the plant's creeping habit. The form of Salvia reptans commonly grown in gardens is unusual in that it produces numerous lax or decumbent stems. The other form, which is native to western Texas and is not cultivated, grows upright to 3 feet in height. The variety S. reptans var. glabra also grows wild in Texas. In horticulture, Salvia reptans reaches 3 feet wide or more with abundant thin, black stems. The stems can make a groundcover. The narrow mistletoe-green leaves are sparse.

Forming as tropical depression on January 25, Arthur rapidly intensified into a strong Category 2 cyclone on the Australian intensity scale according to the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre in Nadi, Fiji. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center assessed the storm to have peaked as a minimal Category 1 cyclone. Shortly after peaking in intensity, the cyclone began to deteriorate due to unfavorable conditions. Quickly moving towards the east-southeast, the Arthur began to undergo an extratropical transition. After turning towards the southeast, the center of circulation was almost fully exposed due to strong wind shear. However, Arthur briefly re- strengthened late on January 26 before becoming extratropical the next day. Tropical Cyclone Arthur affected several small islands during its existence. French Polynesia observed the most noteworthy effects from the storm, where several landslides damaged a few homes. Meteorological history On January 21, 2007, the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre in Nadi, Fiji identified a tropical depression, which was given the number 08F, about 435 km (270 mi) west-northwest of Savai'i island in Samoa. The depression slowly traveled towards the east-southeast for several days as the overall structure of the storm fluctuated due to diurnal variations and strong wind shear. Around 1700 UTC on January 22, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the depression. The system developed a large banding feature in the northern portion of the circulation and deep convection formed around the center of circulation. The depression had moved into an area of weak to moderate wind shear with favorable diffulence aloft. Later that day, gale warnings were issued for the northeastern quadrant of the system. Tropical Depression 08F continued to develop as an anticyclone developed above the system, enhancing the environment around it. A mid- latitude trough located north of the depression was steering it towards the east. Early on January 24, the system became better organized and strengthened into a cyclone at 0600 UTC. The storm, which was named Arthur by the RSMC Nadi, began to undergo rapid intensification as the structure improved significantly. Deep convection developed around the center with strong outflow towards the north. Several hours after becoming a cyclone, the JTWC issued their first advisory on Tropical Cyclone 09P as it traveled quickly towards the east-southeast. The quick movement was due to the influences of subtropical ridge to the north and a trough to the south. Later that day, a banding eye feature began to develop as the storm intensified into a Category 2 cyclone on the Australian intensity scale. At 1800 UTC, the JTWC assessed Arthur to have reached its peak intensity with winds of 120 km/h (75 mph 1-minute winds), the equivalent of a minimal Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Early on January 25, Arthur reached its peak intensity with winds of 110 km/h (70 mph 10-minute winds) with a minimum pressure of 975 hPa (mbar) while located about 635 km (350 mi) north-northwest of Rarotonga. Shortly after peaking in intensity, Arthur began to undergo an extratropical transition and rapidly deteriorated due to strong wind shear. Tropical Cyclone Arthur on January 26 The storm also began to merge with a low-level frontal boundary associated with the remnants of Tropical Cyclone Zita. The strong shear left the center of circulation partially exposed, with deep convection persisting in only the southeastern quadrant. In addition to the shear, dry air began to enter the system, causing it to weaken further. While continuing to move at a quick pace, the storm began to turn towards the southeast along a baroclinic zone. Early on January 26, the JTWC issued their final advisory on the cyclone as it lost most of its tropical characteristics. Arthur re-intensified shortly after and the JTWC reissued advisories on the storm around 2100 UTC. The brief re-strengthening was the result of a breakdown in the baroclinic zone which allowed convection to redevelop around the center. Around the same time, Arthur left RSMC Nadi's area of responsibility (AoR) and entered the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre Wellington's AoR. The storm completed its extratropical transition around 1200 UTC on January 27, leading to the final advisory being issued on the storm. Preparations and impact On January 21, a gale watch was issued for Tutuila, American Samoa, Manu'a, and Swains Island as Tropical Depression 08F approached the islands. Winds of up to 55 km/h (35 mph), with gusts up to 75 km/h (45 mph), were expected. Small craft advisories were issued for the Cook Islands due to large swells produced by the storm. All of the watches were cancelled late on January 23 as the depression was no longer forecast to impact the islands. On January 24, an Orange Alert was issued for the Austral Islands. As the storm neared the region, the alert was upgraded to a Red Alert for Rurutu and Tubuai. Arthur produced minor damages in the Cook Islands‚Äîprimarily consisting of beach erosion‚Äîon January 24. Heavy rains throughout French Polynesia resulted in several landslides which damaged several homes on Tahiti and Moorea. Waves near the islands ranged from 1.5 to 2 m (4.9 to 6.5 ft). Winds in Tubuai reached 85 km/h (50 mph 10-minute winds) with gusts up to 115 km/h (71 mph). Several homes were damaged and roads were blocked by fallen trees throughout the island. Minor coastal flooding also occurred due to the large swells.

These iodinated tyrosines are produced during thyroid hormone biosynthesis. The iodide that is scavenged by iodotyrosine deiodinase is necessary to again synthesize the thyroid hormones. After synthesis, the thyroid hormones circulate through the body to regulate metabolic rate, protein expression, and body temperature. Iodotyrosine deiodinase is thus necessary to keep levels of both iodide and thyroid hormones in balance. Dehalogenation in aerobic organisms is usually done through oxidation and hydrolysis; however, iodotyrosine deiodinase uses reductive dehalogenation. Iodotyrosine deiodinase and iodothyronine deiodinase have been determined as the only two known enzymes to catalyze reductive dehalogenation in mammals. Although these two enzymes perform similar functions, they are structurally and mechanistically different. Iodothyronine deiodinase (not the enzyme that is the topic of this article) uses a selenocysteine active site for catalysis, is a member of the thioredoxin superfamily, and removes iodide only when the substrate is in a double- tyrosine form. By contrast, iodotyrosine deiodinase (the topic enzyme) does not require selenocysteine or cysteine for catalysis, is part of the NADH oxidase/flavin reductase superfamily, and removes iodide when the substrate is a single amino acid. Research on iodotyrosine deiodinase has historically been variable and slow due to its lack of stability and arduous purification. Only recently has this enzyme been studied more deeply.  Structure  Structure of human iodotyrosine deiodinase generated from PDB entry 4TTB. The gene encoding this enzyme has been recently identified. The sequence of amino acids of iodotyrosine deiodinase is highly conserved among mammals and contains three domains. Iodotyrosine deiodinase is a membrane protein, with the N-terminus functioning as a membrane anchor. It forms a dimer that is domain- swapped. Initially, iodotyrosine deiodinase was thought to contain only one flavin mononucleotide (FMN) in each dimer, but now iodotyrosine deiodinase is believed to have two FMN molecules for each homodimer. The enzyme has a characteristic Œ±-Œ≤ fold that all proteins from the NADH oxidase/flavin reductase superfamily have as well. Within the dimer interface, there are two equivalent active sites, each made from residues from both subunits. Thus, subunit association must be required for FMN binding and catalysis. Substrate binding causes a conformational change in the enzyme in order to close the active site, protecting the substrate and flavin from the solvent.  Function  Iodotyrosine deiodinase facilitates iodide salvage in the thyroid by catalyzing deiodination of mono- and diiodotyrosine, the halogenated byproducts of thyroid hormone production. Iodide is also an important micronutrient in the biosynthesis of thyroid hormone, creating a cycle of iodide use in the thyroid. Iodide homeostasis within the thyroid gland is essential for producing thyroid hormone at appropriate rates. Thus, iodide levels must be regulated in order to keep thyroid hormones, and ultimately the organism's metabolic rate and overall health, in good status. Within the thyroid follicular cell, thyroglobulin is hydrolyzed to form thyroid hormones and mono- and diiodotyrosine. The thyroid hormones are released into the bloodstream and the iodinated tyrosines are recycled. However, the breakdown of thyroglobulin produces 6-7 fold more iodinated tyrosines than thyroid hormone. Iodotyrosine deiodinase salvages the iodide from the deiodination of the iodinated tyrosines. Iodotyrosine deiodinase is located on the apical plasma membrane of the thyroid colloid, where mono- and diiodotyrosine are produced from this breakdown of thyroglobulin. Without iodotyrosine deiodinase activity, the iodide would be excreted with the amino acid tyrosine and thyroid hormone biosynthesis would be reduced. The enzymatic activity of iodotyrosine deiodinase has also been known to exist in the tissues of the liver and kidneys as well; however, the physiological significance of these findings is not yet clear.  Mechanism  Iodotyrosine deiodinase catalyzes mono- and diiodotyrosine deiodination. The reaction is NADPH-dependent. Flavin mononucleotide (FMN) is a cofactor. Although flavin is commonly utilized in various catalytic reactions, its use in this reductive dehalogenation is unique and not yet fully understood. It is also still unclear if the enzyme mechanism utilizes a two electron transfer reaction or a series of one electron transfers. Although further research must be done to determine details of this mechanism, recent evidence seems to suggest that iodotyrosine deiodinase acts through one electron transfer reactions. Iodotyrosine deiodinase reaction scheme.  Clinical significance  Mutations in the gene encoding iodotyrosine deiodinase can affect enzyme function and be detrimental to human health. Iodide is an essential micronutrient for health in mammals. Low levels of iodide either through the diet or through iodide metabolism are associated with hypothyroidism, mental retardation, goiter, and developmental defects. Because iodotyrosine deiodinase is responsible for scavenging iodide, mutations in this enzyme result in iodide deficiency. The resulting high blood and urine concentrations of iodotyrosine can be used as a measure for diagnosis, as the iodide is not removed from the tyrosine residues effectively. In some countries, newborn babies are tested for congenital hypothyroidism and treated immediately if the disease is detected, safely preventing the development of mental retardation. However, mutations of iodotyrosine deiodinase are often not detected until after developmental damage has already occurred. Furthermore, these mutations may not be specifically detected using standard thyroid function tests. To combat this issue, a sensitive assay has recently been created that measures the amounts of mono- and diiodotyrosine in the urine.

Built in 1965, the dam is long at the crest and high. Its reservoir, Spada Lake, provides water for 70 to 75 percent of Snohomish County and feeds the Jackson Hydro Project, providing 112 megawatts of clean energy to Snohomish county. Some critics charge that the dam has strongly impacted the runs of salmon and other migratory fish in the Sultan River by depleting gravel and sediment needed to line the riverbed. The dam's operator counters that Culmback Dam dramatically reduces flooding events, benefiting fish populations and the surrounding communities. The dam was named in honor of George Culmback, a former mayor of Everett. The Dam is co-owned by the Snohomish County PUD and the City of Everett and is operated by the PUD. Water from Spada Lake is diverted through a pipeline to a powerhouse further downstream on the Sultan River. From the powerhouse, some water is returned to the river, and some is diverted to Lake Chaplain, where the water enters the Everett water supply system. Construction and other additions Prior to 1917 the City of Everett received its water supply from Woods Creek, a tributary of the Snohomish River. Because of increasing water needs of large paper mills and factories, the city switched its water supply to the Sultan River basin via the tributary Chaplain Creek. The Chaplain Reservoir was created in 1929 with the completion of an earthfill dam, and later raised in 1942. This supply proved insufficient as well, so engineers looked to tap the main stem of the Sultan River, where an excellent dam site had been identified. The Culmback Dam was built in two stages, or phases. Phase 1, which began in 1960 and ended in 1965, involved building the dam to a height of , impounding a reservoir. The construction done during this phase served to replace the smaller, diversion dam downstream on the Sultan River. Phase 2, completed in 1984, involved raising the dam to its present height, quadrupling the reservoir capacity. The second phase also included the pipeline connecting Spada Lake to a new hydroelectric powerhouse and from there to the Chaplain Reservoir. In June 2016, the PUD began demolition of the dam's sluiceway to re-open the upper Sultan River basin to spawning fish. Site The Sultan River at Sultan, Washington. Culmback Dam and Spada Lake received water from a drainage basin of on the west slope of the Cascade Range. Although the broad valley in which the reservoir now lies predates the last Ice Age, the canyon in which the dam was built was formed only about 1 million years ago, when the Sultan River was interrupted by the thick Laurentide Ice Sheet, which rerouted the river from its original watershed, the Pilchuck River. The river eroded a narrow gorge to empty into the Skykomish River, forming an ideal dam site. The Sultan River, formed by the convergence of the North Fork of the Sultan River and Elk Creek, enters the lake from the east. Additional major contributors are the South Fork, which forms an arm of the lake close to Stickney Ridge, and Williamson Creek, which enters from the north at the base of Big Four Mountain. Water supply and power Spada Lake is part of the water supply of the City of Everett, Washington, and also serves 80 percent of Snohomish County. This water supply consists of two lakes, the other being the much smaller, Lake Chaplain on Chaplain Creek, a tributary of the Sultan River. Most of the flow of the Sultan River is diverted at the dam into a penstock that flows to the 112 megawatt (MW) Jackson powerhouse further downstream, with an elevation drop of . At the powerhouse, the water feeds four turbine/generator units, consisting of two 47.5 MW Pelton-type turbines, and two 8.4 MW Francis turbines. The water from the Pelton turbines is released directly into the Sultan River, while the rest of the water is piped to Lake Chaplain. From Lake Chaplain, the water flows in four diameter pipes towards Everett. During flood events, water is also discharged back into the Sultan River through Chaplain Creek and the Sultan River Fresh-water Return Line. The Culmback Dam is able to discharge water through an inverted-bell spillway that has a capacity of per second, which is sufficient to handle the 100-year flood flow of the Sultan River, which is calculated at per second. Recreation The area around the dam and Spada Lake is visited by 5,000 people annually for a variety of recreational activities, including boating, hiking, fishing, and kayaking. The lake has two boat launches and prohibits combustion engines.

He was the father of John Sillett and Peter Sillett, both of whom became professional footballers. Charlie Sillett was killed in a U-boat attack on an allied convoy while serving with the Royal Navy in 1945. He had already survived the torpedoing of HMS Registan in 1942. Football career Army Sillett was born in Plumstead in the Royal Borough of Greenwich, the son of Sidney and Mary Sillett. He joined the Army in 1926 and was enlisted in the 60th King's Royal Rifle Corps, based at Tidworth Camp on Salisbury Plain, where he rose to the rank of Sergeant, becoming a physical training instructor. His skills on the football field won him a variety of Army representative honours. In 1931, his Army career came to an end, and after a short period playing with Barking Town in the Athenian League he joined Second Division Southampton in October 1931. Southampton He played two matches with Southampton's reserves, before being drafted into the first team as an emergency centre forward, where the \\"Saints\\" were suffering with an injury crisis with Bill Fraser, Arthur Haddleton and Johnny McIlwaine all unavailable. Sillett scored twice on his debut, in a 3‚Äì1 victory at Burnley on 2 January 1932, and retained his place in the first team, playing up front until Ted Drake was promoted from the reserves in March. Sillett was recalled, this time at left-back, replacing Reg Thomas for the final three matches of the season. During the following season, manager George Kay settled on a defensive line-up of Bill Adams and Michael Keeping at fullbacks, with Stan Woodhouse, Frank Campbell, Arthur Bradford or Bill Luckett as the three half backs ‚Äì as a result, Sillett managed only six games all season. In 1933‚Äì34, he was again kept out of his favoured role as full back, this time by Arthur Roberts, but had a run of four games taking over from Tommy Brewis at inside right, during which he scored twice in a 5‚Äì0 victory over Bradford at The Dell on 16 December. In August 1934, after three seasons with the Saints, Sillett became an established member of the first team and in 1934‚Äì35 he only missed three games, playing at either left- or right-back. He soon became \\"very popular with fans and colleagues alike\\" and his versatility meant that he was equally at home on either side of the pitch. In the following season, he was ever-present often playing further forward in midfield and occasionally standing in as centre forward when Vic Watson was unavailable. During this season, he was a member of the team that suffered an 8‚Äì0 defeat against Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane on 28 March 1936 (still the highest margin of defeat); two days later, he played at The Dell against Port Vale in front of only 1,875 spectators (losing 1‚Äì0). This was the lowest-ever crowd for a first-team match at The Dell. He only missed one league match in 1936‚Äì37 as the Saints struggled to avoid relegation, finishing in 19th place, four points above the relegation zone. In January, the Saints played Football League champions Sunderland in a Third Round FA Cup match in front of a record crowd of 30,380. Sunderland won 3‚Äì2 and went on to take the cup in the Final the following May. In his final season at The Dell, Sillett was appointed team captain, \\"leading the side with distinction\\", but began to suffer regularly from injuries causing him to miss a third of the season, at the end of which he decided to retire. During his seven years with Southampton, Sillett made a total of 183 appearances in League and Cup matches for the first team, scoring 10 goals. Throughout his entire Southampton career, the club was struggling both financially and on the pitch, regularly finishing in the lower half of the table. Later career and death He had a brief career in non-league football with Guildford City, before becoming a publican at \\"The Lamb\\" at Nomansland in the New Forest. During World War II, he enlisted in the Royal Navy, serving as a DEMS gunner. On 29 September 1942, Sillett was serving on the HMS Registan with the rank of Able Seaman when it was torpedoed by 140 miles east of Barbados, with the loss of 11 crew members and 5 DEMS gunners. Sillett survived the sinking and was picked up on 30 September by an Argentinian merchant boat. On 27 February 1945, he was a member of a DEMS gun crew on the Norwegian freighter SS Corvus, which was part of convoy BTC 81, when the convoy was attacked by two German U-boats about seven miles from Lizard Point, Cornwall. Corvus was hit by a torpedo launched by U-1018 and sank within a few minutes, resulting in the death of five of the freighter's Norwegian crew, a 16-year-old British cabin boy, Thomas Boniface, and two of the three British gunners, Leading Seaman Sillett and Able Seaman Dennis Baker. Both U-boats were sunk two hours later with depth charges from HMS Loch Fada. He is commemorated on the Chatham Naval Memorial. Family Sillett was married to Anne and their children included Peter (born in Southampton on 1 February 1933) and John (born in Southampton on 20 July 1936). The two sons were trainees at Southampton after the war, both subsequently joining Chelsea. Peter played 64 games for Southampton, before moving to Chelsea in 1953, where he had a long career playing 260 league matches and going on to make three appearances for England in 1955. He was also a (non-playing) member of England's squad for the 1958 FIFA World Cup. John never appeared in Southampton's first team, but joined his brother at Chelsea in 1954, making 93 appearances in the league. He subsequently played for Coventry City and Plymouth Argyle, before becoming a manager at Hereford United and then at Coventry City, where he won the 1987 FA Cup Final.

He served as an officer in the U.S. Army, and later as a Confederate officer during the American Civil War. Anderson was noted for his controversial surrender of Fort Gaines at the Battle of Mobile Bay in August 1864. Early life and career Charles DeWitt Anderson was born July 7, 1828 in South Carolina.Eicher 2001b, p. 587. gives birth month of July and birth year of either 1827 or 1829; Allardice, p. 20. gives birth date of July 1827, and subsequent information says his date of birth was July 7, 1828. In 1839 his family immigrated by sea to Texas, at the time an independent nation and not a U.S. state until 1845. During the voyage both of his parents died, and after arriving at the port of Galveston Anderson and his brother were adopted by an Episcopal minister, who raised them both.Allardice, p. 20. In 1846 Anderson became the first Texan appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point. He had been recommended by Texas' founder, Sam Houston, and he began attending on September 1. Anderson struggled academically at West Point; during his sophomore year he was found \\"deficient\\" in both French and mathematics, and resigned from the academy on November 13, 1848.Eicher 2001b, p. 587; Allardice, p. 20. Despite this, in 1856 Anderson was directly commissioned into the U.S. Army as a second lieutenant on June 27. He was assigned to the 4th U.S. Artillery and was promoted to first lieutenant on July 6, 1859.Eicher 2001b, p. 587. Anderson served with the 4th in Florida and then in the Utah Territory, and he was there when the Civil War began in 1861. Acquiring a leave of absence he headed home, and (after covering about 100 miles of wintry terrain) Anderson then decided to resign from the U.S. Army, which was accepted effective on April 1, 1861.Allardice, pp. 20-1. Civil War service Fort Gaines, Alabama, as it appeared in 2008 At the beginning of the American Civil War in 1861, Anderson chose to follow his home state and the Confederate cause. On March 16 he was appointed a first lieutenant in the Regular Confederate Artillery.Allardice, p. 21. states his Regular Army rank as captain; Eicher 2001b, p. 587. and Weinert, p. 119. both state he only reached first lieutenant. His first assignment was at Fort Morgan, guarding the entrance to Mobile Bay, Alabama. There he was given command a regular detachment, organized separately from the volunteer forces but attached to the 2nd Alabama Infantry, and was responsible for the installation's ordnance. His total force consisted of the remaining regular recruits from the Mount Vernon Arsenal in Alabama, and numbered only two officers and nine enlisted men. On November 9 Anderson entered the volunteer service for good, appointed a major in the 20th Alabama Infantry, and command of his regulars fell to 2nd Lt. Alfred M. O'Neal.Weinert, pp. 14-15. Mount Vernon Arsenal regulars organized on May 3, 1861. All the remaining regulars (recruited in Gadsden, Alabama) served together until April 1862, when the unit was broken up; O'Neal would join the PACS, reaching the rank of captain. In late 1861 Anderson and the 20th Alabama were stationed at Knoxville, Tennessee, and on February 15, 1862, he left the unit to join the staff of Brig. Gen. Adley H. Gladden, posted at Mobile, Alabama. That April during the Battle of Shiloh, Anderson acted as his assistant adjutant general, but following Gladden's death in the battle the staff was broken up. The following month Anderson took command of the 21st Alabama Infantry, elected its colonel on May 8. The regiment became part of the defenses of Mobile, with Anderson commanding it for the remainder of 1862, all of 1863, and into 1864.Allardice, p. 21. Fort Gaines By May 1864 Anderson was an acting brigadier general in the Confederate Army. That fall Union forces were operating against Mobile Bay, and Anderson was given command of Fort Gaines, situated directly across from Fort Morgan and resting on Dauphin Island. On August 5 the Union Navy ran past both forts, landing the infantry of Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger. Both forces then began bombarding Fort Gaines, with the heavy naval shells easily passing through the fort's walls. Despite receiving only moderate damage, Anderson's men panicked and demanded he surrender, which at first Anderson rejected, but realizing his command was about to mutiny he conceded defeat on August 8, after three days of shelling. Military historian Bruce Allardice summarized Anderson's predicament: Anderson turned over between 818 and 864 men as well as 26 cannon. His superior, Brig. Gen. Richard L. Page, criticized the surrender as a \\"deed of dishonor and disgrace\\" and for his allowing Lt. Col. James M. Williams (Anderson's second in command) to abandon nearby Fort Powell late on August 5. Page said this despite his own surrender of Fort Morgan two weeks later and after a single day of bombardment. Military historian David J. Eicher considered Anderson's actions a \\"halfhearted attempt to defend the position.\\" Anderson would spend the rest of the war confined to a military prison in New Orleans, Louisiana, and was paroled in 1865.Eicher 2001a, p. 729; Allardice, pp. 21-2; Eicher 2001b, p. 587. David Farragut, the admiral commanding the Union Navy vessels during Battle of Mobile Bay, had Anderson in mind with one of his dying wishes. He requested that the sword he received during Anderson's surrender be returned to Anderson \\"in recognition of his gallantry.\\" Farragut stated in his official report of the battle \\"that Anderson had put up a better fight than Page.\\"Allardice, pp. 21-2. Postbellum career and death Returning to Texas after the conflict ended in 1865, Anderson found work in the construction of railroads. He was then elected for two terms as Austin's chief engineer. Anderson next went back to Galveston, Texas, where he built the Galveston Island Lighthouse. Beginning in 1895 and until his death six years later, Anderson was the lighthouse's keeper. He died there, reportedly of the \\"grippe\\", in November 1901, and was buried in Old Cahill CemeterySee the Find a Grave website for a photo of the gravesite, and an image of Anderson. in Galveston.

It is an irregularly shaped area containing 36 properties, primarily residential but with some churches and commercial buildings, in the center of the village, just east of its downtown. In 1998 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Most of the district is open space, taken up by a mill pond and park, a cemetery and the former site of a racetrack. Its buildings, mostly from the 19th century but some predating the Revolution, are clustered in a small area Stage Road and represent the early core of Monroe from the days when Smith's Mill, its first business, had dammed the waters of Ramapo Creek. They are also survivors of an 1892 fire that devastated the village. The Greek Revival and Federal architectural styles prevail, with some mid-19th-century Gothic Revival homes included. Among the contributing properties are the oldest Masonic Lodge in New York, and the home of David Smith, the village's first settler. Geography The most consistent boundary of the district is New York State Route 17M on its west, from Lake Street, including the entire mill pond and park, to a point a half-mile (1 km) west of its intersection with the Stage Road, now Orange County Route 19. A small area west of 17M, primarily along Stage but also including portions along Oakland, Mill and Ramapo streets, is included. The only other deviation from 17M is the exclusion of two large lots not part of Monroe Cemetery or the racetrack to the northeast of the 17M-Stage Road intersection. Map of district Along the east, the boundary follows the west side of Mill Pond Parkway south from Lake, then runs east along the south side of Smithfield Court to follow the west side of Stage south for a short distance. Then it makes a zigzag path along lot boundaries to the junction of Carpenter Place and Maple Street. At that point it extends south to take in Monroe Cemetery, then returns to Stage and 17M. History 18th and 19th centuries The village of Monroe began with the arrival of David Smith, originally from Brookhaven on Long Island, who in 1747 bought a tract of the Cheesecocks Patent, where he had built a house six years earlier, in 1741, at what is now the junction of Maple and Stage. In 1761 he bought an adjacent tract, and these two purchases make up much of today's Monroe. He had dammed the creek to start a mill, and very soon the settlement came to be known as Smith's Mills. As it continued to grow into the early 19th century, it was renamed to first Southfield and then, in 1808, Munroe, after a then-state senator. Later confusion over the spelling during the administration of President James Monroe led to the more common spelling being adopted, as well as stories that the village was named after the president. This period of Monroe's growth is reflected in the Federal style houses within it, as well as McGarrah's Tavern at Stage and 17M. It was chartered as a Masonic lodge in 1814 and remains the oldest such building in New York. By 1836 its economy included not only milling but an iron industry which not only smelted the ore in the nearby hills but made it into finished products like nails and anchors. The New York and Erie Railroad routed its main line through what was then the village's outskirts in 1841, opening up new markets to Monroe. During this period the Federal style began to yield in popularity to the Greek Revival mode. The 1811 Nicholas Knight House on Stage Road was later renovated into a strong example of this style, and the 1853 First Presbyterian Church of Monroe, also on Stage, shows a more advanced interpretation of the style. Mid-19th-century homes along Stage Road The railroads would be responsible for the Monroe Cheese Company making Velveeta a nationally known brand from its 1873 introduction. Its Italianate brick former factory remains on Mill Pond Road. Of the different styles popular in the late Victorian period, the Queen Anne Style was most in evidence in Monroe. The 1841 Methodist Church on Maple Avenue was renovated in Queen Anne style in 1885, and over a decade later, in 1896, the Church of the Sacred Heart was built in that style. In 1892 a fire destroyed much of the village's then- downtown, to the east of the mill and older houses. The citizens responded by formally incorporating the village two years later, in order to establish a fire department and water supply system. 20th and 21st centuries New construction in the historic core of the village began to drop off in the early 20th century, as the village expanded and other areas were developed. The racetrack became a popular venue for the local harness racing circuit between 1908 and 1927. The Colonial Revival style was not as popular as its Victorian predecessors had been, so there are few examples of it in the district. The most notable is the American Foursquare house at 132 Stage Road, dating to 1910. Since 1940 there has been no major new construction in the district, save the 1948 Classical Revival Monroe Theatre, next to the cheese factory. The racetrack's grandstand was demolished in 1964. The stone bridge was demolished in 1994. The Monroe Theater was demolished and replaced with a modern structure, which has since been acquired by the Town of Monroe. Significant contributing properties McGarrah's Tavern Judge Seaman House The 36 contributing properties contain 70 total buildings and structures. Of these 47 buildings and 9 structures, along with four sites, are considered historic resources of the district. None have yet been listed separately on the Register.

The song features on all the band's regular live releases. \\"How Long\\", \\"Tired World (Chapter Six)\\", \\"Perfectionist\\" and \\"Ice Nice\\" are also often played live: * \\"How Long\\" appears on In Transit (1982), Detours (rec. 1997, rel. 1999) and Worlds Apart Revisited (rec. 2005, rel. 2007). * \\"Tired World (Chapter Six)\\" is featured on The Chapters Live (rec. 2003, rel. 2005) and Spin It Again!

In other words, all the songs except \\"Climbing the Ladder\\" (which was never played live) are available in live versions. Other information \\"Humble Stance\\" is one of only few songs on which Michael Sadler plays bass guitar, while Jim Crichton plays keyboard chords. As it is a regular part of the live setlis - unlike \\"It's Time\\" or \\"No Stranger\\", which also feature the same constellation - fans usually know that Saga are going to start playing \\"Humble Stance\\" as soon as Sadler takes over Jim's bass guitar. The album cover introduced a trademark - the alien insect that plays a prominent role in the \\"Chapters\\" *saga*, sometimes called 'Golden Warrior', 'GoldenBoy' or 'Harold, the Locust' (!). While only the first three albums featured this creature, it was later revived for Full Circle (1999), an album that also revived the \\"Chapters\\", and subsequently became Saga's mascot and has since appeared on numerous releases. It can also be seen as a stage backdrop, e.g. on the current DVD Spin It Again! Live in Munich (rec. 2012, rel. 2013). What's notable beside the very striking image of the insect is that it has changed a lot over the years. The locusts on the cover of Images at Twilight (1979) and Silent Knight (1980) look quite different from the one featured on the debut. Then again, on Full Circle (1999) you can see the next step of the metamorphosis - the locust sheds its old skin and it is this image that features on most following Saga releases. The Chapters Two of the songs, \\"Will It Be You? (Chapter Four)\\", and \\"Tired World (Chapter Six)\\", were part of a series of eight (but later sixteen) songs that Saga included within their first four albums called \\"The Chapters\\", which told the story of a young Albert Einstein. These songs were later included on The Chapters Live (rec. 2003, rel. 2005), an album that the band recorded in 2005. To date, there's been no official compilation of the chapters in their studio incarnation.

He joined the Habsburg army and fought against the Prussians during the Seven Years' War. A cultured man, he later battled Belgian rebels and earned promotion to general officer. During the French Revolutionary Wars he fought against the First French Republic and attained high command. In 1796, a young Napoleon Bonaparte won some of his first victories against an army led by Beaulieu. He retired and was the Proprietor (Inhaber) of an Austrian infantry regiment until his death. Early career Born in Lathuy Castle, Jodoigne in the Austrian Netherlands (now Walloon Brabant, Belgium) in 1725, Beaulieu joined the Habsburg army in 1743 and fought in the War of the Austrian Succession. During the Seven Years' War he served first as an infantry officer and later on the staff of Feldmarschall Leopold Joseph von Daun. Beaulieu was wounded in the Battle of Kolin and also fought at the battles of Leuthen, Hochkirch, Maxen, and other actions. He received the Knight's Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa in 1760. \\"As a young man, his bold and fiery character combined with his great energy and constant activity had made him well-suited to the military life.\\"Boycott-Brown, p 132 Beaulieu married Marie-Louise Robert in 1763; in 1776 she died. He was artistically inclined. He designed improvements for several palaces, designed and laid out a formal garden, and collected art work. He became a General- Major in 1789 and helped crush the Brabant Revolt against Austrian rule, though his only son was killed during the uprising.Boycott-Brown, pp 132‚Äì133 For his services, in 1790, the Habsburg army promoted him to Feldmarschall- LeutnantFiebeger, p 8 and awarded him the Commander's Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa.Smith & Kudrna, Beaulieu French Revolutionary Wars 1792‚Äì1795 In the years from 1792 to 1795, Beaulieu fought against France in the Flanders Campaign and later on the Rhine. On 28‚Äì29 April 1792, he won one of the first engagements of the War of the First Coalition at Mons. With 5,000 Austrian troops and 18 artillery pieces, he defeated Armand Louis de Gontaut, Duke of Biron's 7,500 soldiers and 36 guns, inflicting 400 casualties for a loss of only 30.Smith, p 21 He bested the French in another clash at Harelbeke on 23 June. On this occasion he led a corps of 11,050 men and 10 guns against 7,000 Frenchmen and 6 guns from Nicolas Luckner's army.Smith, p 23 At the unsuccessful siege of Lille from 25 September to 8 October, he commanded a division in the army of Duke Albert of Saxe-Teschen. His command included three and a half infantry battalions under Karl von Biela, nine cavalry squadrons led by Ludwig Franz Civalart d'Happoncourt, eight squadrons commanded by Charles Eugene, Prince of Lambesc, and Karl Friedrich von Lindenau's sappers and pontonniers.Smith, p 28 On 6 November 1792, Beaulieu led Saxe-Teschen's left wing at the Battle of Jemappes. His command included one battalion of the Hohenlohe Infantry Regiment Nr. 17, two battalions of the Stuart Infantry Regiment Nr. 18, five companies of the Serbian Freikorps, and one squadron of the Blankenstein Hussar Regiment Nr. 16.Smith, p 31 He led a force during the successful defense of Trier in December 1792.Smith, p 35 With 5,000 troops, including five battalions and four squadrons, he repulsed an 8,000-man French attack on Wervik on 28 August 1793.Smith, p 53 He participated in the Siege of Le Quesnoy from 28 August to 13 September. In this successful action in which 5,000 French soldiers were killed or captured, he was subordinate to Fran√ßois S√©bastien de Croix de Clerfayt.Smith, p 55 On 26 June 1794, he commanded the fifth column in the Battle of Fleurus. This powerful column consisted of 16 battalions, 22 squadrons, and 18 guns.Smith, p 87 After the defeat at Fleurus, Prince Josias of Coburg, who disliked Beaulieu, dismissed him. From 1792 to 1794, he was Proprietor (Inhaber) of Infantry Regiment Nr. 31, a Hungarian unit.Boycott-Brown, p 133 He succeeded Joseph Orocz as Inhaber and was succeeded in turn by Johann Andreas Benjowsky. On 7 July 1794, Beaulieu received the Grand Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa. 1796 Battle of Montenotte. \\"Attack on the redoubt of Monte Legino\\" by Giuseppe Bagetti (1764-1831) On 4 March 1796, Beaulieu was promoted to Feldzeugmeister and transferred to command the 32,000-strong Habsburg army in northern Italy. He faced a French army with a newly created commander, Napoleon Bonaparte. Together with a 17,000-man army from the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia, Beaulieu's task was to defend the crest of the Ligurian Alps and the northern Apennines in order to keep the French armies from entering the Po River basin of northern Italy.Fiebeger, p 5 Secret orders from the Austrian government warned him that his Piedmontese ally might soon change sides, and was not to be trusted. These instructions prevented Beaulieu from effectively cooperating with the Sardinian commander of the Piedmontese forces, Michelangelo Colli-Marchi, a personal friend.Boycott-Brown, pp 136-137 In the event, Bonaparte outmaneuvered Beaulieu during the Montenotte Campaign. After the French mauled his right wing in battles at Montenotte and Dego, Beaulieu watched in stunned inactivity as the French knocked Sardinia out of the war at the battles of Millesimo, Ceva, and Mondov√¨. Beaulieu withdrew his army behind the Po, hoping the river would stop the French advance. But Bonaparte marched west to cross the river near Piacenza, behind the Austrian left flank. The French defeated Anton Lipthay de Kisfalud at the Battle of Fombio on 7 to 9 May 1796. Hastily, Beaulieu withdrew his army to the east, dropping off a force under Karl Philipp Sebottendorf to hold the bridge over the Adda River at Lodi. Bonaparte seized the bridge in the Battle of Lodi on 10 May, driving back Sebottendorf with losses of 2,000 casualties and 14 guns. The Austrians abandoned Duchy of Milan and pulled back to the Mincio River. A minor defeat at the Battle of Borghetto on 30 May forced Beaulieu to abandon the Mincio line and retreat north to the Tyrol. Before leaving the Po valley, he left a strong garrison in the fortress of Mantua. The Siege of Mantua would become the focus of many battles during the remainder of 1796.Chandler, p 265 During the retreat, Beaulieu relieved Lipthay from command of the rearguard for retreating too quickly. Thomas Graham, an English observer with the Habsburg army, noted that Beaulieu seemed to expect too much from his soldiers, was irritated, and tended to blame the failure of his plans on others for not properly executing his orders. Graham also deplored the \\"petty intrigue\\" among the Austrian officers.Boycott-Brown, pp 360-361 Retirement After Borghetto, Emperor Francis II replaced Beaulieu with Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser. Beaulieu went into retirement after the 1796 campaign. In 1794, he had become proprietor of a Walloon regiment.

Incorporated in Massachusetts in 1880, it opened the main line in March 1884, linking Mexico City to Ciudad Ju√°rez, across the Rio Grande from El Paso and connections to the Southern Pacific Railroad, Texas and Pacific Railway, and Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. Other major branches included Irapuato to Guadalajara (completed in 1888), Chicalote to Tampico (completed in 1890), and Guadalajara to Manzanillo (completed in 1908). The Mexican Central acquired control in June 1901 of the Monterey and Mexican Gulf Railroad, which connected the Mexican International Railroad at Reata (near Monterrey) to Tampico, and connected its main line with this line at the Monterrey end through a branch from G√≥mez Palacio. The Mexico, Cuernavaca and Pacific Railroad, owner of an unfinished line from Mexico City to Acapulco (completed to Rio Balsas), joined the system in November 1902, and in 1905 the Mexican Central bought the Coahuila and Pacific Railway (Torre√≥n to Saltillo), which paralleled the branch from G√≥mez Palacio to Monterrey and was to be operated jointly with the National Railroad of Mexico. The Mexican government gained control in 1906, and in February 1909 the Ferrocarriles Nacionales de M√©xico (National Railways of Mexico) took over the property. Following privatization in the 1990s, Ferromex acquired most of the former Mexican Central, the primary exception being the branch from Chicalote to Tampico, which was assigned to Transportaci√≥n Ferroviaria Mexicana (now Kansas City Southern de M√©xico).

It is found in coniferous woodlands in Europe, and has also been encountered under introduced pine trees in Australia. It is regarded as edible. A 2014 article speculated that it may be poisonous,Heping Xia: Fatal toxins found in 'edible' wild mushrooms, in: Chemistry World, 16 June 2014 but Sitta et al. in 2016 published in the same journal a counter article demonstrating the unfounded nature of such speculation.Paolo Davoli, Marco Floriani, Francesca Assisi, Karl Kob, Nicola Sitta: Comment on ‚ÄúChemical and Toxicological Investigations of a Previously Unknown Poisonous European Mushroom Tricholoma terreum ‚Äù, in: Chemistry Europe. First published: 10 March 2016, doi:10.1002/chem.201406655 Taxonomy The fungus was originally described as Agaricus terreus by Jacob Christian Sch√§ffer in 1762, and as Agaricus myomyces by mycologist Christian Hendrik Persoon in 1794. It was given its current binomial name by German Paul Kummer in 1871. It is commonly known as the grey knight from its discoloured gills. Almost all modern sources consider Tricholoma myomyces to be a synonym of T. terreum, but there are some exceptions. Bon mentions that T. myomyces has been defined for lowland mushrooms with white gills and a fleecy cap and Courtecuisse separates it on the same basis. Moser distinguished T. myomyces on the basis that the gills should go yellow. Description The cap is wide and evenly covered in fine grey scales. Convex with a slight boss, it is broadly conical in shape. The whitish stipe is high and wide and has no ring. There is no ring or volva. The whitish flesh is thin, easily broken, and has a pleasant mild (not mealy) smell and taste. The widely spaced and uneven gills are free (unattached to the stipe). The spore print is white, the oval spores 6‚Äì7 Œºm long by 3.5‚Äì4.4 Œºm wide. It could be confused with the larger (and poisonous) T. pardinum has a mealy smell and cap scales; the edible T. orirubens has fine dark scales and pinkish gills. Distribution and habitat Tricholoma terreum is found in Europe, where fruiting bodies appear under conifers, particularly pine and spruce, from late summer to late autumn. They may also arise in parks near these trees, and grow in fairy rings. They are generally in quite densely populated groups though not bunched. It has been recorded growing under exotic Pinus radiata plantations in Australia. Edibility With a mild taste, the species used to be regarded as a good edible. It is seen in markets in France, along with Clitocybe nebularis and Tricholoma portentosum. However, some authorities recommend that inexperienced pickers avoid all grey tricholomas. Recent chemical tests show that this species may contain toxins which can cause rhabdomyolysis. However, from more recent investigations has emerged that only abnormal quantity of Tricholoma mushroom may trigger the rhabdomyolysis and normal consumption of about 200g of mushroom is safe unless individual reaction.Piotr Rzymski, Piotr Klimaszyk: Is the Yellow Knight Mushroom Edible or Not?

Common names include purple cherry, rose satinash, and black water gum. The habitat of Syzygium crebrinerve is sub tropical rainforest on basaltic or fertile alluvial soils.  Description  Syzygium crebrinerve is a medium to tall tree, occasionally reaching 45 metres in height and a metre in trunk diameter. The tree's crown appears dark and full, though new growth is bright red. The bark is a grey/fawn colour, with numerous depressions caused by the shedding of scales of bark. New live bark is a purplish brown colour. Large Syzygium crebrinerve are significantly buttressed at the base.  Leaves, flowers and fruit  The leaves are opposite, simple, and entire, up to 11 cm long. Margins are narrowed at each end and drawn out into a point. Young leaves are bright red. Oil dots of various sizes, the largest visible to the naked eye. Leaf stalks are 6 mm long. Flowers are white, appearing in November and December, in panicles at the ends of branchlets. The fruit matures from January to April, being a flattened berry, a common shape of many Syzygium. Syzygium fruit are also described as drupaceous. Colours range from pink to purple. The flesh is unpalatable to humans, being dry and tasteless, but is eaten by many rainforest birds, including the topknot pigeon.  Cultivation  Seed germination is slow, erratic and unreliable. Fruit is prone to insect attack. Soaking of the seeds is recommended to drown insect larvae. Germination results can range from 27% to 100%.

It refers to latency, or lag measured by the difference between the time there is a signal input, and the time it takes the input to display on the screen. This lag time has been measured as high as or the equivalent of 3-4 frames on a 60 Hz display. Display lag is not to be confused with pixel response time. Currently the majority of manufacturers do not include any specification or information about display latency on the screens they produce.  Analog vs digital technology  For older analog cathode ray tube (CRT) technology, display lag is extremely low, due to the nature of the technology, which does not have the ability to store image data before display. The picture signal is minimally processed internally, simply for demodulation from a radio-frequency (RF) carrier wave (for televisions), and then splitting into separate signals for the red, green, and blue electron guns, and for the timing of the vertical and horizontal sync. Image adjustments typically involve reshaping the signal waveform but without storage, so the image is written to the screen as fast as it is received, with only nanoseconds of delay for the signal to traverse the wiring inside the device from input to the screen. For modern digital signals, significant computer processing power and memory storage is needed to prepare an input signal for display. For either over-the-air or cable TV, the same analog demodulation techniques are used, but after that, then the signal is converted to digital data, which must be decompressed using the MPEG codec, and rendered into an image bitmap stored in a frame buffer. For progressive scan display modes, the signal processing stops here, and the frame buffer is immediately written to the display device. In its simplest form, this processing may take several microseconds to occur. For interlaced video, additional processing is frequently applied to deinterlace the image and make it seem to be clearer or more detailed than it actually is. This is done by storing several interlaced frames and then applying algorithms to determine areas of motion and stillness, and to either merge interlaced frames for smoothing or extrapolate where pixels are in motion, the resulting calculated frame buffer is then written to the display device. De-interlacing imposes a delay that can be no shorter than the number of frames being stored for reference, plus an additional variable period for calculating the resulting extrapolated frame buffer.  Causes of display lag  While the pixel response time of the display is usually listed in the monitor's specifications, no manufacturers advertise the display lag of their displays, likely because the trend has been to increase display lag as manufacturers find more ways to process input at the display level before it is shown. Possible culprits are the processing overhead of HDCP, Digital Rights Management (DRM), and also DSP techniques employed to reduce the effects of ghosting ‚Äì and the cause may vary depending on the model of display. Investigations have been performed by several technology-related websites, some of which are listed at the bottom of this article. LCD, plasma, and DLP displays, unlike CRTs, have a native resolution. That is, they have a fixed grid of pixels on the screen that show the image sharpest when running at the native resolution (so nothing has to be scaled full-size which blurs the image). In order to display non-native resolutions, such displays must use video scalers, which are built into most modern monitors. As an example, a display that has a native resolution of 1600x1200 being provided a signal of 640x480 must scale width and height by 2.5x to display the image provided by the computer on the native pixels. In order to do this, while producing as few artifacts as possible, advanced signal processing is required, which can be a source of introduced latency. Interlaced video signals such as 480i and 1080i require a deinterlacing step that adds lag. Anecdotally, display lag is significantly less when displays operate in native resolutions for a given LCD screen and in a progressive scanning mode. External devices have also been shown to reduce overall latency by providing faster image-space resizing algorithms than those present in the LCD screen. In practice this would stack the internal and external latencies. Many LCDs also use a technology called \\"overdrive\\" which buffers several frames ahead and processes the image to reduce blurring and streaks left by ghosting. The effect is that everything is displayed on the screen several frames after it was transmitted by the video source.  Testing for display lag  Display lag can be measured using a test device such as the Video Signal Input Lag Tester. Despite its name, the device cannot independently measure input lag. It can only measure input lag and response time together. Lacking a measurement device, measurement can be performed using a test display (the display being measured), a control display (usually a CRT) that would ideally have negligible display lag, a computer capable of mirroring an output to the two displays, stopwatch software, and a high-speed camera pointed at the two displays running the stopwatch program. The lag time is measured by taking a photograph of the displays running the stopwatch software, then subtracting the two times on the displays in the photograph. This method only measures the difference in display lag between two displays and cannot determine the absolute display lag of a single display. CRTs are preferable to use as a control display because their display lag is typically negligible. However, video mirroring does not guarantee that the same image will be sent to each display at the same point in time. In the past it was seen as common knowledge that the results of this test were exact as they seemed to be easily reproducible, even when the displays were plugged into different ports and different cards, which suggested that the effect is attributable to the display and not the computer system. An in depth analysis that has been released on the German website Prad.de revealed that these assumptions have been wrong. Averaging measurements as described above lead to comparable results because they include the same amount of systematic errors. As seen on different monitor reviews the so determined values for the display lag for the very same monitor model differ by margins up to or even more. To minimize the effects of asynchronous display outputs (the points of time an image is transferred to each monitor is different or the actual used frequency for each monitor is different) a highly specialized software application called SMTT or a very complex and expensive test environment has to be used. Several approaches to measure display lag have been restarted in slightly changed ways but still reintroduced old problems, that have already been solved by the former mentioned SMTT. One such method involves connecting a laptop to an HDTV through a composite connection and run a timecode that shows on the laptop's screen and the HDTV simultaneously and recording both screens with a separate video recorder. When the video of both screens is paused, the difference in time shown on both displays have been interpreted as an estimation for the display lag.http://hdtvlag.googlepages.com/ourtest Nevertheless, this is almost identical to the use of casual stopwatches on two monitors using a \\"clone view\\" monitor setup as it does not care about the missing synchronisation between the composite video signal and the display of the laptop's screen or the display lag of that screen or the detail that the vertical screen refresh of the two monitors is still asynchronous and not linked to each other. Even if V-sync is activated in the driver of the graphics card the video signals of the analog and the digital output will not be synchronized.http://www.prad.de/new/monitore/specials/inputlag/inputlag- teil18.html Therefore, it is impossible to use a single stop watch for display lag measurements, nevertheless if it is created by a timecode or a simple stopwatch application, as it will always cause an error of up to or even more.  Effects of display lag on users  Display lag contributes to the overall latency in the interface chain of the user's inputs (mouse, keyboard, etc.) to the graphics card to the monitor. Depending on the monitor, display lag times between have been measured. However, the effects of the delay on the user depend on each user's own sensitivity to it. Display lag is most noticeable in games (especially older video-game consoles), with different games affecting the perception of delay. For instance, in World of Warcraft's PvE, a slight input delay is not as critical compared to PvP, or to other games favoring quick reflexes like Counter-Strike. Rhythm-based games, such as Guitar Hero, also require exact timing; display lag will create a noticeable offset between the music and the on-screen prompts. Notably, many games of this type include an option that attempts to calibrate for display lag. Arguably, fighting games such as Street Fighter, Super Smash Brothers Melee and Tekken are the most- affected, since they may require move inputs within extremely tight event windows that sometimes only last 1 frame or 16.67 ms on the screen. By assuming a Gaussian human response time to a particular in-game event, it becomes possible to discuss the effect of lag in terms of probabilities. Given a lag-less display, a human has a certain probability to land his/her input within a window of frames. As video games operate on discrete frames, missing the last frame of the window even by 0.1 ms causes an input to be interpreted a full frame later. Because of this, any amount of lag will affect a human's ability to hit a particular timing window. The severity of this impact is a function of the position and variance of a human's response to a visual cue, the amount of lag introduced, and the size of the timing window. For example, given a very large window of 30 frames, a human would likely have a 99.99% chance of hitting this window. By introducing one frame of lag, the human's ability to hit the 30 frame window would likely remain in the 99.99% range (assuming the human is responding somewhere near the middle of the window). Given a smaller window of say 2 frames, however, the effect of lag becomes much more significant. Assuming the human's response is centered on the 2 frame window and the super-human has a 99.99% chance to hit the window, introducing a full frame of lag causes the success rate to drop all the way to about 50%. If the game's controller produces additional feedback (rumble, the Wii Remote's speaker, etc.), then the display lag will cause this feedback to not accurately match up with the visuals on-screen, possibly causing extra disorientation (e.g. feeling the controller rumble a split second before a crash into a wall). TV viewers can be affected as well. If a home theater receiver with external speakers is used, then the display lag causes the audio to be heard earlier than the picture is seen. \\"Early\\" audio is more jarring than \\"late\\" audio. Many home-theater receivers have a manual audio-delay adjustment which can be set to compensate for display latency. Solutions  Game mode  Many televisions, scalers and other consumer-display devices now offer what is often called a \\"game mode\\" in which the extensive preprocessing responsible for additional lag is specifically sacrificed to decrease, but not eliminate, latency. While typically intended for videogame consoles, this feature is also useful for other interactive applications. Similar options have long been available on home audio hardware and modems for the same reason. Connection through VGA cable or component should eliminate perceivable input lag on many TVs even if they already have a game mode. Advanced post-processing is non existent on analog connection and the signal traverses without delay. Renaming input A television may have a picture mode that reduces display lag for computers. Some Samsung and LG televisions automatically reduce lag for a specific input port if the user renames the port to \\"PC\\".  Display lag versus response time  LCD screens with a high response-time value often do not give satisfactory experience when viewing fast-moving images (they often leave streaks or blur; called ghosting). But an LCD screen with both high response time and significant display lag is unsuitable for playing fast-paced computer games or performing fast high- accuracy operations on the screen, due to the mouse cursor lagging behind. Manufacturers only state the response time of their displays and do not inform customers of the display lag value, which might vary depending on various screen options selected.

Quall is a personal friend and next door neighbor of Hart, and has appeared with him on Hart's Public-access television cable TV show in Los Angeles, California. *Tairy Greene (Zach Galifianakis) ‚Äî a multi-talented actor known for his work in a Gravy Robbers restaurant employee training video, as the lead-role in Little Dancing Man, and from the hit action television show The Snuggler, where he played a man who helps people by snuggling them. As The Snuggler, he rescued Tim from the woods after an attack by Chippy's mother, nursing him back to health with snuggles and rehabilitation. Tairy stars in the Snuggler video game, in which players must snuggle and earn energy crystals, which can be traded in for a number of green shields. He hosts the Tairy Greene Acting Seminar For Children. As a graduate of James Sprunt Community College and having studied under the tutelage of Randy Tutelage, Greene often embellishes his acting credentials and abilities, usually to the dismay of the children. He is perceived as a little bit crazy; he attributes this to having once stuck his tongue in a burrito. Greene directed the fictional Channel 5 movie Back To Squall and the fictional film Little Danson Man starring Ted Danson and David Cross. Cinco produces \\"The Tairy Greene Machine,\\" a video jukebox pre-loaded with every appearance Greene had ever made. The device runs on \\"Greene technology,\\" as it only runs on tap water. * Casey Tatum (Heidecker) ‚Äî A teenaged singer who is regularly featured on Uncle Muscle's Hour. Tatum is portrayed as being uncomfortable and easily overcome by extreme, debilitating stage fright, and is often on the threshold of either crying and/or vomiting. Tatum has a severe case of facial eczema, which he treats with generous applications of Vaseline. During his performances, Casey is accompanied by his unnamed, sunglasses-wearing brother (Wareheim), with the duo billed as \\"Casey and His Brother\\". He either dances or otherwise acts out the song alongside him. In the season 2 premiere \\"Vacation\\", it was revealed that during the events of the season 1 episode \\"Missing\\", Tatum had died in a fiery car crash at the age of 17; subsequent episodes would feature \\"classic\\" Casey and His Brother performances.

He almost always has a Bluetooth headset in his right ear, and is often accompanied by psychedelic green screen effects. He also co-starred in the fictional Channel 5 Tuesday Afternoon Movie Back to Squall as the headmaster of Admiral David Liebe Hart's Sailing Quallage. He stars as himself alongside Bill Hader in The James Quall Story. Hart often sings about aliens and seems to have a particular affinity for the Korendian race; he had to apologize in a season four episode after an uncharacteristically sexual remark about Korendian women's \\"spicy tacos.\\" * Palmer Scott ‚Äî a middle-aged, overweight, balding man wearing what appears to be outdated Jordache apparel from the late '80s or early '90s. He is noted for his matching denim shirt and jeans, gyrating torso, and unusually spry pelvic thrusts. However, he is best known for what he does: he \\"sits on you\\". He also makes an appearance in Season 4, where a woman who appears to be pregnant requests that her \\"bub-bubs\\" be bounced. Where three men fail to bounce her bub-bubs, Palmer succeeds. In Season 2, his name was revealed to be Palmer Scott during the Channel 5 Dance Party. * Michael Q. Schmidt ‚Äî recurs in several episodes. Schmidt was part of Tom Goes to the Mayor as Tom's wife Joy, and has performed in several of the Awesome Show's live tours, as well as being 'Winter Man' for the Chrimbus Special. *Pierre (actor/comedian Ron Austar) ‚Äî a children's entertainer whose obsessions include young boys, their dads, and barbecue meat. Pierre frequently appears in videos purportedly intended for children but inevitably showcasing his fixations, such as a public service announcement informing children that \\"all the food is poison\\" and they should therefore eat something else, \\"Doo Dah Doo Doo\\" (a line dance that features increasingly suggestive directions, as well as lyrics expressing his desire to meet the participants' dads), and a meditation lesson for children (which turns into a ploy to get their dads' e-mail addresses). One sketch revealed that Pierre's ideal dreams include a \\"beautiful boy\\" and the boy's mustachioed dad inviting him to a barbecue dinner, where he is fed meat while looking at various websites on an extremely fast internet connection. While hosting the Channel 5 Dance Party, Pierre commented that he once impregnated Casey's mother. *Chippy ‚Äî an animated character whose origin dates back to Tom Goes to the Mayor, Chippy is a wild creature often seen in very brief bits in which he is found hiding in a background. Chippy resembles a hirsute baby, with a handlebar mustache and an abnormally large unibrow. Chippy is always in distress and a scene with Chippy almost always ends with it emitting a high-pitched screech. In the episode \\"Forest,\\" Chippy's mother (Wareheim) viciously attacks Tim while on a nature hike. *Jan and Wayne Skylar (Heidecker and Wareheim) ‚Äî a husband and wife who are television news anchors, billed as \\"Channel 5's Only Married News Team\\", and less than modest about displaying affection on air. These characters were carried over from Tom Goes to the Mayor. * Dr. Steve Brule (John C. Reilly) ‚Äî an inept Channel 5 news reporter who often appears uncomfortable being on air, and seems uncontrollably attracted to his colleague Jan Skylar ‚Äî whose husband Wayne disapproves of his advances toward her. Canadian comedian Ron Sparks played Brule in a short video for the charity event Other People's Stuff. in 2008. Brule also became the subject of a spin-off series, Check It Out! with Dr. Steve Brule. *Steve Mahanahan (Wareheim) ‚Äî the eccentric owner of a retailer that sells children dressed as clowns for the use of the buyer's amusement. In his commercials he is always shown with constant visual effects and video glitching. He also gave Casey Tatum a ride in the season 1 episode, 'Missing'. Steve Mahanahan also has a brother named Mike (played by Tim) who appeared in one episode and sells shoes for the aforementioned child clowns, and like his brother, is constantly featured in his commercials with video glitching. Often the two brothers profess their love for each other and their endorsement of their brother's store. In season 5, Steve Mahanahan was arrested for touching a child clown and Mike Mahanahan was shot in the face for no discernible reason. With these two gone, their father Donald Mahanahan (played by Will Ferrell) took over the business breeding child clowns. Donald Mahanahan breeds the clowns using his own seed and women who possess \\"real clown traits\\". *Glen Tennis (A.D. Miles) ‚Äî a film producer and actor, characterized by his short temper and a penchant against \\"crappy acting\\". He starred alongside Ron Stark in a low-budget sci-fi film, Crystal Shyps. In \\"Carol\\", Tennis is seen selling Crystal Shyps merchandise on Shopping Indoors, but is interrupted by his brother David‚Äîwho calls in to \\"harmlessly rib\\" him, prompting Tennis to destroy the merchandise in anger. In \\"Tennis\\", Tennis is seen promoting his new film The Pillgrums, with the film's badly rendered CGI co-star, Grum. * Spagett (Heidecker) ‚Äî a hyperactive overweight middle-aged man with a black ponytail, visible hair plugs, and dried spaghetti sauce around his lips. He is the host of a hidden camera TV show, where he hides in various locations to \\"spook\\" people by yelling out his name. However, his hiding places are always in plain view and as a result, his victims are rarely frightened. In one episode Tim stars as Spagett in the Steven Spielberg (portrayed by look-alike Howie Slater) movie Spagett and the Quest for the Golden Treasure. He also serves as a spokesman for Cigarette Juice. * The Beaver Boys (Heidecker and Wareheim) ‚Äî a pair of party boys named Dilly and Krunk who often prowl the beach for women. They are seen as having a penchant for cocktail shrimp and white wine, which is further emphasized in the lyrics to their show's accompanying theme song. *Carol and Mr. Henderson (Wareheim and Heidecker) ‚Äî set in a typical office, Carol is an obese lady who has a sexual obsession with Mr. Henderson, her balding and bespectacled boss. Henderson often stops by Carol's cubicle to sexually harass/tease her. This always excites Carol, and just when she is most excited, Mr. Henderson throws his coffee in her face. Henderson secretly adores Carol, but won't show it. In The Tim and Eric Chrimbus Special, Carol and Henderson are shown to have married. Henderson, while playing with his guillotine collection, is nearly beheaded by Carol. However, thanks to a speedy trip to the hospital, Henderson is rehabilitated by Gary, twin brother of office employee Larry. A deleted scene from the Chrimbus Special DVD reveals that Henderson's first name is Dick. *Ron Stark ‚Äî a self-proclaimed actor, director, and producer, who often has various roles throughout every Tim and Eric season. In season 1, such roles included a user of \\"Balls Insurance\\". He also hosts a show called Stark On Stark in season 2, in which he interviews himself. *Will Grello (Will Forte) ‚Äî host of several shows featuring activities such as fort building and quilting. Although his shows start out calmly and innocently, he inevitably unravels, as repressed thoughts surface about his abusive father who would punish him with a whipping belt and make him do disturbing things such as \\"cook the dog\\" and preserve his bowel movements in the toilet for his father's inspection. He frequently urinates involuntarily when he gets on his tangents about his father. Recurring sketches * Cinco: Carried over from Tom Goes to the Mayor, Cinco is a family-owned megacorporation with various subsidiaries, including the Cinco Chemicals and Toy Division, among others. Most sketches involving Cinco take the form of commercials for its products and services‚Äîoften of questionable appeal or based on outdated technology‚Äîsuch as the Cinco-Fone (a mobile phone that has a single button for \\"easier\\" operation, and multiple antennas, but cannot receive calls, only has enough battery life for one call, and is prone to overheating), insurance plans for groin injuries, \\"MyEggs\\" (a drug that causes \\"feces-activated\\" chicken embryos to become eggs that are \\"laid\\" in the toilet), as well as several body modifications ‚Äî all of which promoted by the two middle-aged characters Rudy and Kent (Jay Mawhinney and Bob Ross) ‚Äî that require the user's teeth be removed for safety regardless of the product. * Channel 5 Kid Break: A series of pseudo-educational interstitial music videos, in which two \\"children\\" (Heidecker and Wareheim) rap about personal hygiene and family situations such as sitting down on the toilet while urinating, wearing a father's dirty socks, incest (having a crush on one's sister), not wiping one's rear end, bloody nipples, and eating one's boogers. * Brule's Rules: A Channel 5 interstitial where Steve Brule provides \\"advice\\" on various topics, \\"for your health\\". * Uncle Muscle's Hour: A variety show on Channel 5 hosted by the titular Uncle Muscles (\\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic), almost always featuring performances by Casey and His Brother. One episode featured a talent show known as the \\"Uncle Muscle's Grand Championship\\"‚Äîwhich was won by Michael Q. Schmidt and his nude \\"Raise my Roof\\" dance routine. *Afternoon Review: The Daytime Show for Women: Purportedly a daytime talk show, it instead features surreal performances by various men with little elaboration. Season 5 featured a variation, Morning Meditations, which follows a similar format. *Child Showcase: A poorly-archived Channel 5 program on which \\"children\\" (an adult's head, including those of Rainn Wilson and Patton Oswalt, superimposed over a child's body) perform musical numbers that are somewhat inappropriate in subject matter, much to the chagrin of the host. *Video Match: A Dating Service: A series of dating service videos featuring undesirable men looking for love. Such men, who are shown with compressed faces and prominent moustaches, include one with petite, feminine feet and another who is a gamer with only a \\"tip\\" for a penis (Rainn Wilson). *Song Legends Karaoke: Karaoke videos featuring songs about subjects such as adultery, stalking, and living in an apartment with one's father. An elderly woman named Ruth Carr is featured prominently in two of the segments. Occasionally a sketch will end with a freeze frame; the colors fade to black and white, and a voice announces, \\"Great job!\\" while these words are written over the frame. Death of Richard Dunn On Friday June 4, 2010, character actor Richard Dunn died at age 73. Dunn's agent stated that Dunn had been at a Hollywood hospital, unconscious since the previous Sunday. Dunn was laid to rest at Hollywood Forever Cemetery. On June 12, 2010, a special tribute bump for Dunn was aired on Adult Swim after the 12:30 a.m. showing of The Oblongs, describing Dunn as an irreplaceable part of the Tim and Eric family and saying how much he'll be missed, not just as a great character actor, but as a great friend as well.

One example is VP4 from simian virus 40 (SV40).  In Human papillomaviruses  In Human papillomavirus (HPV), two late proteins are involved in capsid formation: a major (L1) and a minor (L2) protein, in the approximate proportion 95:5%. L1 forms a pentameric assembly unit of the viral shell in a manner that closely resembles VP1 from polyomaviruses. Intermolecular disulphide bonding holds the L1 capsid proteins together. L1 capsid proteins can bind via its nuclear localisation signal (NLS) to karyopherins Kapbeta(2) and Kapbeta(3) and inhibit the Kapbeta(2) and Kapbeta(3) nuclear import pathways during the productive phase of the viral life cycle. Surface loops on L1 pentamers contain sites of sequence variation between HPV types. L2 minor capsid proteins enter the nucleus twice during infection: in the initial phase after virion disassembly, and in the productive phase when it assembles into replicated virions along with L1 major capsid proteins. L2 proteins contain two nuclear localisation signals (NLSs), one at the N-terminal (nNLS) and the other at the C-terminal (cNLS). L2 uses its NLSs to interact with a network of karyopherins in order to enter the nucleus via several import pathways. L2 from HPV types 11 and 16 was shown to interact with karyopherins Kapbeta(2) and Kapbeta(3). L2 capsid proteins can also interact with viral dsDNA, facilitating its release from the endocytic compartment after viral uncoating.

Located in the Liben Zone of the Somali Region, it has a latitude and longitude of with an elevation of 3,150 meters above sea level. It is the administrative center of Filtu woreda. During the Italian occupation, a road 115 kilometers in length to Negele Boran was maintained but not paved.\\"Local History in Ethiopia\\" The Nordic Africa Institute website (accessed 20 February 2009)  History  In October 1964, Filtu was the scene for one of the perennial conflicts between the Boran and Guji Oromo and their traditional rivals the Somali. The two Oromo clans attacked the Somali north of the Ganale Dorya, stealing or killing much of their livestock and forcing half of them to flee across the river, along with their fellow Muslims the Rayitu, to seek sanctuary around Filtu. The local authorities confined these refugees to a \\"protected hamlet\\" and ignored their pleas for help to return to their homes. As their plight worsened, the camp inhabitants started drifting south to Somalia for weapons and training. One group of 40 men, who left for Somalia three months after arriving at Filtu, led by Waqo Gutu, returned the next year to play an important role in the Bale revolt.Gebru Tareke, Ethiopia: Power and Protest: Peasant Revolts in the Twentieth Century (Lawrenceville: Red Sea, 1996), p. 143 During the Ogaden War, the Somali Army had penetrated into southern Sidamo as far as Filtu, which they captured by the end of July 1977, but did not push any deeper.

(accessed 13 May 2009) Due to disagreements between the local Somali and Oromo groups as well as within those ethnicities, no decision could be made about locating the administrative center for Liben Zone, as well as delaying the formation of a working zonal administration. Therefore, Filtu was appointed to function as interim administrative center for the Zone by the Transitional Government of Ethiopia during the 1990s.Socio-economic conditions of the population in Liben zone, Ethiopian Somali National Regional State UNDP Emergencies Unit for Ethiopia report, February 1996 (accessed 21 February 2009) Ethnic disputes in the years up to (and including) 2002 led to refugees settling around Filtu. Over 800 households came to settle themselves in three camps around this town: two of the camps include people from the Bale Zone in Oromia, and one housed people claiming to come from Liben woreda in Borena Zone in Oromia. These refugees include 220 Degodia households who reported they came from an area south of the Negele Boran-Filtu road and north of the Dawa River, and 243 Wara Dubie and 289 Garre families who came from Dallo Mana. Another 250 Somali families also arrived most of whom came from the Negele Mana area, located on the Welmel River, about 100 kilometers north of Negele Boran.\\"Internal Discussion Paper: Humanitarian aspects of Liben and Afder zones in Somali Region at the end of Jilal\\" , UNDP Emergencies Unit for Ethiopia, 31 March 2002 (accessed 23 March 2009) The Somali People's Democratic Party observed its eleventh anniversary of its founding in Filtu in July 2009, where numerous improvements to the infrastructure of the Liben Zone were announced.\\"11th founding anniversary of Somali People Democratic Party celebrated\\", Ethiopian News Agency 4 July 2009 (accessed 1 November 2009)  Demographics  Based on figures from the Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia published in 2005, Filtu has an estimated total population of 11,738 of whom 3,496 are men and 8,242 women.CSA 2005 National Statistics , Table B.4 The 1997 census reported this town had a total population of 5,518 of whom 3,135 were men and 2,383 women.

A local vernacular name is hardheads. It is native to Europe but it is known on other continents as an introduced species and often a noxious weed. Although the plant is often unwanted by landowners because it is considered a weed by many, it provides a great deal of nectar for pollinators. It was rated in the top 5 for most nectar production (nectar per unit cover per year) in a UK plants survey conducted by the AgriLand project which is supported by the UK Insect Pollinators Initiative. It also placed second as a producer of nectar sugar per floral unit, among the meadow perennials, in another study in Britain. Description It is a perennial herb growing up to about a metre in height. The leaves are up to long, usually deeply lobed, and hairy. The lower leaves are stalked, whilst the upper ones are stalkless. The inflorescence contains a few flower heads, each a hemisphere of black or brown bristly phyllaries. The head bears many small bright purple flowers. The fruit is a tan, hairy achene 2 or 3 millimetres long, sometimes with a tiny, dark pappus. It flowers from July until September. The flowers sometimes are yellow or white Wildlife value In Europe, the plant is an important source of food for the European goldfinch, honey bee, lime-speck pug moth, and the following butterflies: large skipper, meadow brown, small heath, painted lady, peacock, red admiral, small copper and small skipper. In the UK study published by the peer-reviewed journal PLOS One, the plant was even more noteworthy for being the top producer of both nectar and pollen, when the amount of each were compared with the pollen production of the highest nectar producers and vice versa. Of the six species that produced more nectar than this plant, none of them produced a significant amount of pollen. The top producer of nectar was ragwort and the top producer of pollen was corn poppy. Similar species Brown knapweed (Centaurea jacea) is different in having pale brown bract appendages, no pappus. Flowers August until September.

In the Roman Catholic Church his feast day is celebrated on 23 October. Born in Valdinievole near Pescia to a well-to-do rural landowner, he spent his youth shepherding the family's flock before devoting his life to acts of charity. He built two churches, a bridge over the Arno, three hospices for pilgrims and other travellers, including one on his own property at Campigliano near Uzzano. He was a generous almsgiver. Later in his life he mediated between the Tuscan city-states, seeking to prevent conflicts that in later centuries would grow into open and continual war. He died at Valdinievole.

Common names include sour cherry and Killarney satinash. The habitat of Syzygium corynanthum is rainforest on basaltic or fertile alluvial soils.  Description  Syzygium corynanthum is a medium size tree, occasionally reaching 30 metres in height and a 90 cm in trunk diameter. The tree's crown appears dark and full. The bark is a grey and scaly, with numerous depressions caused by the shedding of bark scales. Syzygium corynanthum are slightly buttressed at the base. League Scrub, west of Nambucca Heads.  Leaves, flowers and fruit  The leaves are opposite, simple and entire. Oil dots numerous, about five diameters apart of different sizes. Leaf stalks are 6 mm long. Flowers are in short dense panicles. Petals cream, four in number, appearing in April to July. The fruit matures from September to December, being a red berry, broader towards the tip than at the base. Four persistent calyx lobes surround the base of the fruit, from which the style usually protrudes. The taste of the fruit is not particularly sour, as the common name might suggest. Seed germination is slow, commencing at 40 days, and being complete after 200 days. Fruit is prone to insect attack. Soaking of the seeds is recommended to drown insect larvae. Fruit are eaten by many rainforest birds, including the wompoo fruit dove and catbird.

The use of naval drifters is paralleled by the use of naval trawlers. Fishing trawlers were designed to tow heavy trawls, so they were easily adapted to tow minesweepers, with the crew and layout already suited to the task. Drifters were robust boats built, like trawlers, to work in most weather conditions, but designed to deploy and retrieve drift nets. They were generally smaller and slower than trawlers. If requisitioned by navies, they were typically armed with an anti-submarine gun and depth charges and used to maintain and patrol anti-submarine nets. __NOTOC__ World War I The Canadian CD-class naval drifter, CD 27, built during World War I for the Royal Canadian Navy. Many became fishing vessels after the war. A Great Yarmouth drifter George Albert during the war Like fishing trawlers, the Royal Navy requisitioned many fishing drifters for conversion to naval use during World War I. In addition, 362 naval drifters were ordered to Admiralty specifications (and thus are often referred to as \\"Admiralty drifters\\").Gardiner et al., p. 104 Shipyards used to building fishing trawlers or drifters could easily switch to constructing naval versions. As a bonus these drifters could be sold to commercial fishing interests when the war ended. There were two basic types of Admiralty-built drifters, wooden hulled and steel hulled. * The wooden hull vessels displaced 175 tons, were 86 ft (26.2 m) long, with a beam of 19 ft (5.8 m). They had a speed of 9 knots and carried one 6 pounder gun. 91 wooden hull vessels were launched 1918‚Äì20, and 100 similar Canadian-built craft were ordered in January 1917. * The steel hull vessels displaced 199 tons, were 86 ft (26.2 m) long, with a beam of 18 ft 6in (5.6 m). They also had a speed of 9 knots and carried a 6 pounder gun. 123 steel-hulled vessels were launched 1917‚Äì1920, and 48 others were cancelled. Royal Navy drifters were named like the trawlers were, except for the Canadian-built vessels which were numbered CD 1 to CD 100. During 1917, a fleet of British drifters, escorted by destroyers and light cruisers, maintained a blockade of the wide Strait of Otranto, denying the Austro-Hungarian Navy access to the Mediterranean. On 15 May 1917, the Austro- Hungarian Navy raided the barrage.Halpern, pp. 162‚Äì163 The Austro-Hungarians gave most drifter crews warning to abandon ship before opening fire. Some drifter crews chose to fight, and the Gowan Lee returned fire on the Austro- Hungarian ships. The drifter was heavily damaged, but remained afloat. Skipper Joseph Watt was later awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions during the battle.Halpern, p. 163 Of the 47 drifters in the barrage at the time, 14 were sunk and 4 were damaged.

It is a remnant of Lake Bonneville, an ancient postglacial inland sea that covered much of the western United States during the Ice Ages. The lake is a natural impoundment of a stream that drains into the Great Salt Lake. Rush Lake varies in size, evaporating at about per year, although occasional floods refill the lake. The average surface elevation is . Geography The lake is located in a broad valley named Rush Valley near the town of Stockton and several miles south of Tooele, and is fed by snowmelt from six mountain ranges. These are the Sheeprock Mountains in the south, the East Tintic Mountains to the southeast, the Oquirrh Mountains to the east, South Mountain to the north, the Stansbury Mountains to the northwest and west, and the Onaqui Mountains to the southwest. The runoff from these mountain regions create only intermittent surface flow to the lake, but does reach it via groundwater seepage. The highest point in the watershed is Lowe Peak, at . The outflow mostly consists of evaporation, and a very small amount seeps through the sandspit that impounds it from the main Great Salt Lake valley. The lake was isolated from Lake Bonneville approximately 15,000-17,000 years ago after evaporation lowered the lake level to below the natural Stockton Bar barrier between Rush Valley and Tooele Valley. During the ice ages, Rush Valley was merely one of many arms of Lake Bonneville. After Bonneville dried up, Rush Valley contained several pluvial lakes ‚Äì Shambip, Smelter, and Rush ‚Äì of which only Rush Lake remains today. Climate and ecology Two major vegetation communities inhabit the Rush Lake watershed. These are sagebrush-grass and pinyon-juniper. The former is found in lower elevations and the valley floor, and the latter is found at higher elevations on the mountains along with other forms of alpine vegetation. The average annual precipitation is , and the annual frost-free season surrounding the lake ranges from 100 to 140 days. Cattle and sheep rangelands take up most of the catchment area. The lake is inhabited by several different species of fish. These include, in order of abundance, Utah chub, carp, green sunfish, bluegill, largemouth bass, channel catfish, yellow perch, black crappie, and black bullhead. The lake has not been stocked with fish since 1988, when 71,000 largemouth bass fry were released in the lake.

NOTE: On-line version has limited access. Wayne had just finished a song at a Non- commissioned officer's club near Da Nang in South Vietnam Wayne was hit by a bullet fired from a .22 pistol, fitted with a silencer, which had been stolen at the base. Wayne was the first Australian woman killed during the Vietnam War. Sergeant James Wayne Killen was originally convicted of the unpremeditated murder of Wayne; at his first court-martial it was alleged that he was aiming for his commanding officer, Major Roger E. Simmons. Wayne had intended to use money earned from her performances in Vietnam to revive her recording career; and to marry her fianc√©, Clive Cavanagh, who was the drummer for her performance troupe, Sweethearts on Parade. Killen served two years of his sentence in the US, before a second court-martial cleared him of the charge and he was released. Biography Cathy Wayne was born as Catherine Anne Warnes on 7 December 1949 in Arncliffe, New South Wales, Australia. Wayne was the child of George Warnes and Nancy Starnes, n√©e Buck. She went to Athelstane Public School where she began singing and dancing classes. Wayne later attended Arncliffe Girls' High School, and, before the age of 12, had performed in school concerts and local community stage shows. She took up a dancing spot on the localised version of Opportunity Knocks on the Nine Network. She also appeared on an Australian TV special, A Night with Leslie, starring US entertainer Leslie Uggams. At the age of 16, after winning a talent contest, Wayne was offered a regular role on television variety show, Bandstand, alongside veteran Rock 'N' Roll performers Col Joye and Little Pattie. Wayne signed with Joye's agency ATA and was managed by his sister Carole Jacobsen. Although under legal drinking age, Wayne performed in licensed clubs around Sydney, and also recorded advertising jingles. She recorded singles, although these failed to enter the charts. However concert tours along the east coast of Australia, headlined by Joye, led to her being asked on her first tour of South Vietnam at the age of 17, in early 1967, to entertain troops stationed there during the Vietnam conflict. This tour was sanctioned by the Australian Forces Advisory Committee on Entertainment. Wayne was presented as a modette version of fellow Bandstand regular Little Pattie. Upon return to Australia, Wayne continued her appearances on Bandstand and touring with Joye. In mid-1969, Sweethearts on Parade, an Australian pop group and performing troupe, was established by Sydney promoter Les Maisler to tour Vietnam. Sweethearts on Parade consisted of Wayne on lead vocals, Clive Cavanagh on drums, Jacqui Edwards as a Go-Go dancer, Rick Hoare on guitar, Jeff Howison as MC, singer and comedian, Jimmy Taylor on organ and bass guitar, and Natalia Woloch as a Go‚ÄìGo dancer. Wayne, as lead singer of Sweethearts on Parade, returned to South Vietnam on an unsanctioned tour. Wayne's parents and Col Joye attempted to dissuade her from this second tour, but Wayne insisted and intended to use money earned from her performances in Vietnam to restart her recording career. Wayne wanted to marry her fianc√©, Cavanagh, who was the drummer in Sweethearts on Parade. The group arrived in Vietnam on 26 June 1969, Wayne stayed in Saigon between shows for Australian and US troops. Entertaining Vietnam (2003), showing Cathy Wayne onstage in June or July 1969 performing to troops in Vietnam The tour agent was Ingrid Hart, who recalled that \\"[Wayne] wanted to be there with her boyfriend, they were going to get some money together and get married\\". On 20 July 1969, Sweethearts on Parade were performing for about 75 US Marines at a Non- commissioned officer's club 7 km (4 mi) south-east of Da Nang in South Vietnam. At about 9:15 p.m., Wayne had just finished a song and was waiting to introduce her fellow performers when she was hit in the chest by a bullet fired from a .22 pistol, fitted with a silencer, which had been stolen at the base. Wayne died almost instantly as the bullet severed her aorta. In Entertaining Vietnam, a 2003 documentary directed and produced by Mara Wallis, Taylor was interviewed on the events of Wayne's death as footage of a Sweethearts on Parade performance was shown (see screenshot at left). Taylor recalled that he was sitting about a metre (three feet) behind Wayne and that Cavanagh had stepped forward to cradle his fianc√©e when she slumped to the floor. At his first court-martial, US Marine Sergeant James Wayne Killen was charged with premeditated murder and was alleged to have been aiming for his commanding officer, Major Roger E. Simmons. Killen was convicted of the unpremeditated murder of Wayne; he was stripped of all service privileges, dishonourably discharged and sentenced to 20 years hard labour. Killen denied all murder claims but admitted to drinking heavily on the night. After the autopsy in Saigon, Wayne's body was returned to Sydney and cremated according to Anglican rites. The Sydney Morning Heralds Shane Green cited Don Morrison's book, written under his pen name J D Owen, Murder on Stage; Morrison described how Killen served two years of his sentence before being given a re-trial in the US where he was cleared of the charge of unpremeditated murder and released. As of April 2015 the actual shooter had not been identified. Based on Morrison's research, the Australian Dictionary of Biography entry on Warne was amended in June 2015.

In 2004, Leland was elected to the Michigan State House of Representatives, representing the 10th District, which is located in Wayne County and includes the farwest and partial northwest corner of the city of Detroit. Since 2013, Leland has served on the Detroit City Council. Biography Gabriel Leland was born on September 28, 1982 to Burton and Rosanne Leland, a Jewish family from Northwest Detroit. At the time of his birth, his father was serving as Democratic State Representative, a position that he would hold until 1998, when he was elected to the Michigan State Senate where he served until he retired from the legislature due to term limits in 2006. Gabe and his older brother Zachary spent much of their childhood working on the campaigns of their father, serving as voter registration drive workers and walking door-to-door with their father. Leland attended both East Lansing and Detroit Public Schools and graduated from East Lansing High School in 2001. He attended Kehillat Israel Congregation in Lansing, MI while growing up. Leland graduated from Central Michigan University with a B.S. / community development concentration. He attends the Isaac Agree Downtown Synagogue in Detroit. Political career In 2004, following in the footsteps of his father, Gabe Leland announced his candidacy as a Democrat for the 10th State House District in Detroit to succeed Triette E. Reeves, who was retiring due to term limits. However, Leland faced much opposition in the Democratic Primary. The 10th District is approximately 70% African American and several prominent African Americans ran against Leland in the primary, including future State Representative from the 9th District, Shanelle Jackson. The primary was competitive and often racially charged. Leland narrowly won the Primary with only 21% of the vote. He went on to easily win the General Election, as the 10th District is heavily Democratic. In 2006, several people again challenged Leland in the Democratic Primary, including Stephanie Young, who was supported by former mayor Kwame Kilpatrick. Leland won the primary with 53% of the vote. He won the 2008 Democratic primary with 68% of the vote and no Republican ran against him in the 2008 General Election. Term limits prevent Leland from running for re-election in 2010. On November 5, 2013 Leland won the newly created Detroit City Council seat in District 7. It was the narrowest victory in any of the council races, winning by only 50 votes. In 2017, Leland was re-elected with 56% of the vote. FBI Investigation In July 2017, a Fox2 investigation revealed Gabe Leland has voted for, or extended, at least four contracts on behalf of Gasper Fiore. Fiore's daughter, Jennifer Fiore, has acknowledged that she dated Leland from late 2014 to early 2017. She is also an attorney and executive in Fiore's companies. The contracts, or amendments, are valued at over two million dollars. In addition to providing towing services, Gasper Fiore was also an executive in companies that leased property to the Detroit Police Department and removed snow from Detroit streets. Fiore was among twenty defendants targeted in a public corruption investigation in Macomb County that targeted pay-to-play schemes, including one that took down the Rizzo trash empire. In May 2017, a federal grand jury indicted Gasper Fiore on bribery and fraud charges for paying a Clinton Township trustee to support a towing contract for Fiore's companies. In December 2017, the Detroit Free Press obtained wiretap transcripts that were accidentally unsealed in U.S. District Court. The transcripts were part of the FBI investigation against Gasper Fiore. According to court documents, the government had probable cause that Fiore and other targets, including Leland, were involved in several crimes, including: extortion, wire fraud, bribery and conspiracy to distribute marijuana. On October 4, 2018, Leland was indicted on charges of two counts of bribery and one count of conspiracy to commit bribery. The charges stemmed from Leland's solicitation of bribes from local business owner Robert Carmack, in exchange for Leland's help in preventing or delaying the city's sale of a property Carmack owned. According to Lawrence Garcia, of the City of Detroit Corporation Counsel, \\"Leland promised not to sell Carmack's property, located at 8124 Michigan Ave., if Carmack would give Leland $15,000 for his reelection campaign.\\" Carmack also claims Leland asked him to fix his secretary‚Äôs car for free. The indictment details several discussions Leland had with Carmack between May and August 2017, including a meeting at the Caucus Club, where Leland acknowledged receiving $7,500 cash. At a May 2017 meeting, Leland told Carmack: \\"I should ask for 30 (thousand dollars) but I'm nice to you.\\" After the request by Leland, Carmack went to the FBI for help who asked Carmack to wear a wire and pay Leland. While a camera was secretly recording, Carmack paid $7,500 to Leland campaign staffer, Elisa Grubbs. Leland allegedly confirmed the payment on tape. The indictment alleges that after Leland and Carmack discussed preventing the sale in exchange for $15,000, Leland cast the only vote during a June 2017 council committee meeting against placing the property sale on the City Council agenda. At the time of the vote, Leland was chairman of the committee. Later, the indictment says, Leland discussed his ability to hold up the property sale during a telephone conversation with Carmack. \\"I held it up again. Yeah. Yeah, it stayed right, right in committee brother.\\" Later in the conversation, Leland scolded Carmack: \\"You didn't show up to my fundraiser.\\" According to the indictment, Carmack was uncomfortable about his dealings with Leland. Leland reassured Carmack of his loyalty, stating: \\"No, but you can f---in' trust me. That's all that matters.\\" In spite of Carmack‚Äôs attempts to curry favor, Leland eventually put Carmack‚Äôs property on the city council agenda to sell it. The indictment also accuses Leland of conspiring with Grubbs, who was charged for her role in the alleged scheme. If convicted of the charges, Leland faces up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine on each bribery count and up to five years and a $250,000 fine on the conspiracy count. Extortion lawsuit In March 2018, Robert Carmack filed a lawsuit against Leland in Federal Court for extortion.

Development Triumph launched the first new Bonneville for 15 years at the Munich Motorcycle Show in September 2000, with a 790 cc, 360-degree crank, parallel-twin engine. Triumph's development team had originally designed a prototype they called the 9O8MD project in April 1997, an 'entry-level' medium displacement motorcycle for the export market. Market research indicated that Triumph's heritage was an important factor for overseas buyers, so Export Manager Ross Clifford decided to develop a parallel engine layout that could combine the latest technology with classic engine architecture. By the Summer of 1997 the concept had been agreed and the chassis and engine design teams began development work. The styling of the new bike had to link the heritage look to a modern handling frame. The team began with a fully restored 1969 Bonneville T120 and worked on the design throughout 1998. By August 1998, the first styling review of a full size three-dimensional model was completed by sales and marketing as well as engineering departments. The first 'Bonneville' engine was tested on 15 December 1998. The prototype engines were run for extended periods of time before committing to tooling production. By the end of 1998, the chassis team had completed their work on the styling prototype. In March 1999, the new engine was run in the prototype chassis for the first time and full scale road testing began, with the first six development bikes built in July 1999. Four were mainly used for engine testing and the remaining two for chassis development work. By September 1999, the final review of the production Bonneville's styling and specification was completed by Triumph's sales and marketing teams and final testing was completed in July 2000, well in time for the dealership launch. Engine design 'Traditional' engine capacities of 750 cc and even the original 650 cc were considered before 790 cc was chosen. The 86 mm bore size worked well with the four-valves per cylinder layout, while the 68 mm stroke allowed a long conrod that helps to minimise secondary vibration, although Triumph engineers also altered the bar weights to restore a little 'character' vibration. Designer David Stride was able to add details that retained the look of the original, such as a finned cylinder and dummy pushrod tube (which functions as a cylinder head oil breather) and internal oil lines to create a clean appearance. As well as the desired low and midrange performance, the engine is capable of and produces a respectable peak power output of @ 7400 rpm, with maximum torque of @ 3500 rpm, with 90% of the engine's torque output available from 2750 rpm all the way to the rev limit. The engine was air-cooled like the original, but had twin overhead camshafts instead of the old model's pushrod valve operation. A frame mounted oil cooler ensured consistent running temperatures and camshaft drive is by chain between the cylinders and incorporates an idler gear that allowed the cylinder head to be kept very compact. Gearbox and cycle parts The gearbox was the well- proven Triumph 955i unit as a five-speed to a cable-operated wet clutch and reversed, with the final drive chain on the right instead of the left. This allows the traditional Triumph twin layout of small triangular engine cover on the right and larger clutch case on the left. Instead of fuel injection the team opted for a pair of 36 mm Keihin carburettors with electric heaters to help cold starting and a throttle-position sensor linked to digital ignition to optimise throttle response. The 'peashooter' twin exhausts were designed longer than usual to meet the silencing requirements, and a kink was added to improve ground clearance. The engine is solidly mounted in the frame at five points with counter-balancers removing the need for rubber mounts. Suspension was provided by twin Kayaba rear shocks and non-adjustable 41 mm Kayaba telescopic forks, set at a 29-degree head angle, with 117 mm of trail. A 19-inch front wheel was offset by a 17-inch rear and the relatively long wheelbase and low seat height give the new Bonneville the 'lean' look of the original. Upgrades For 2004 the engine was updated with a black finish, and in 2007 production of the 790 cc Bonneville ended when the engine size was increased to 865 cc.

In Buddhist thought, a view is not a simple, abstract collection of propositions, but a charged interpretation of experience which intensely shapes and affects thought, sensation, and action. Having the proper mental attitude toward views is therefore considered an integral part of the Buddhist path, as sometimes correct views need to be put into practice and incorrect views abandoned, and sometimes all views are seen as obstacles to enlightenment.  Positions  In describing the highly diverse intellectual landscape of his day, the Buddha is said to have referred to \\"the wrangling of views, the jungle of views\\". Views are produced by and in turn produce mental conditioning. They are symptoms of conditioning, rather than neutral alternatives individuals can dispassionately choose. The Buddha, according to early texts, having attained the state of unconditioned mind, is said to have \\"passed beyond the bondage, tie, greed, obsession, acceptance, attachment, and lust of view.\\" Those who wish to experience nirvana must free themselves from everything binding them to the world, including philosophical and religious doctrines. Right view as the first part of the Noble Eightfold Path leads ultimately not to the holding of correct views, but to a detached form of cognition.  Understanding karma  The term \\"right view\\" (' / ') or \\"right understanding\\" is basically about having a correct attitude towards one's social and religious duties. This is explained from the perspective of the system of karma and the cycle of rebirth. Used in an ethical context, it entails that our actions have consequences, that death is not the end, that our actions and beliefs also have consequences after death, and that the Buddha followed and taught a successful path out of this world and the other world (heaven and underworld or hell). Originating in the pre-Buddhist Brahmanical concerns with sacrifice rituals and asceticism, in early texts the Buddha shifts the emphasis to a karmic perspective, which includes the entire religious life. The Buddha further describes such right view as beneficial, because whether these views are true or not, people acting on them (e.i. leading a good life) will be praised by the wise. They will also act in a correct way. If the views do turn out to be true, and there is a next world after death, such people will experience the good karma of what they have done when they were still alive. This is not to say that the Buddha is described as uncertain about right view: he, as well as other accomplished spiritual masters, are depicted as having \\"seen\\" these views by themselves as reality. Although devotees may not be able to see these truths for themselves yet, they are expected to develop a \\"pro- attitude\\" towards them. Moral right view is not just considered to be adopted, however. Rather, the practitioner endeavors to live following right view, such practice will reflect on the practitioner, and will eventually lead to deeper insight into and wisdom about reality. According to Indologist Tilmann Vetter, right view came to explicitly include karma and Rebirth, and the importance of the Four Noble Truths, when \\"insight\\" became central to Buddhist soteriology. This presentation of right view still plays an essential role in Theravada Buddhism.  Understanding doctrine  A second meaning of right view is an initial understanding of points of doctrine such as the Four Noble Truths, not-self and Dependent Origination, combined with the intention to accept those teachings and apply them to oneself. Thirdly, a \\"supramundane\\" right view is also distinguished, which refers to a more refined, intuitive understanding produced by meditative practice. Thus, a gradual path of self- development is described, in which the meaning of right view gradually develops. In the beginning, right view can only lead to a good rebirth, but at the highest level, right view can help the practitioner to attain to liberation from the cycle of existence. Buddhist Studies scholar Paul Fuller believes that although there are differences between the different levels of right view, all levels aim for emotional detachment. The wisdom of right view at the moral level leads to see the world without greed, hatred and delusion. Misunderstanding objects as self is not only seen as a form of wrong view, but also as a manifestation of desire, requiring a change in character.  No views  The Buddha of the early discourses often refers to the negative effect of attachment to speculative or fixed views, dogmatic opinions, or even correct views if not known to be true by personal verification. In describing the highly diverse intellectual landscape of his day, he is said to have referred to \\"the wrangling of views, the jungle of views\\". He assumed an unsympathetic attitude toward speculative and religious thought in general. In a set of poems in the early text Sutta Nipata, the Buddha states that he himself has no viewpoint. According to Steven Collins, these poems distill the style of teaching that was concerned less with the content of views and theories than with the psychological states of those who hold them.

They were originally a monastery of Trappist monks founded in 1882 by Pfanner, but were later branched off as a separate congregation by decree of the Holy See. The name of the congregation comes from Mariannhill, a suburb near Pinetown in KwaZulu Natal, South Africa, where the congregation originated. History In 1882, Pfanner, then prior of Mariastern Abbey, founded a Trappist monastery in Mariannhill at the invitation of Bishop Jolivet, OMI. It grew rapidly, and by 1885 it was raised to the status of an abbey, with Pfanner elected as its first abbot. It engaged significantly in missionary work, establishing a number of mission stations where priests and brothers taught the native Zulu people to read and trained them in trades and skills such as farming. The missionaries also emphasised learning Zulu and Xhosa, and even developed standard Zulu grammars. In 1892, Pfanner retired, and was succeeded by two abbots: Dom Amandus Schoelzig who died in 1900; then Abbot Gerard Wolpert who died in 1904. In 1904, the abbot of Gethsemani Abbey, Edmond Obrecht, was appointed by the Holy See as administrator of Mariannhill. He studied the compatibility between monastic life and missionary work, submitting his report after three years of study. Following his report, the Sacred Congregation of Propaganda directed Bishop William Miller, OMI, the vicar-apostolic of Transvaal, to facilitate the independence of the Mariannhill monks. A general chapter of Mariannhill monks in 1908 under Bishop Miller recommended that the monks be formed into a missionary society loosely-associated with the Trappists. By 1 January 1910, nearly 20,000 persons, mostly adults, were baptized in the 55 churches and chapels scattered throughout the 26 missions and stations. However, in 1909, the Holy See decreed that the monks of Mariannhill would be completely separate from the Trappists. Their new constitutions were approved by Pope Pius X in March 1914, however further development stalled due to the outbreak of World War I. After the conclusion of the war, they held their first general chapter in 1920, when they named themselves the Religious Missionaries of Mariannhill, and elected Adalbero Fleischer as their first superior general. As their religious habit, they adopted a black cassock, paired with a red cincture for priests, black cincture for other clerics, and black belt for brothers. After separation, the Mariannhillers continued to work in South Africa, but also established presences in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, the United States, England, Canada and Spain. Their generalate is based in Rome. During the Holocaust, Blessed Engelmar Unzeitig, a priest of the congregation, was arrested for preaching against the Third Reich and persecution of Jews. He later died on 2 March 1945 in the Dachau concentration camp, where he was known as the \\"Angel of Dachau\\". He was later declared venerable by Pope Benedict XVI in 2009, recognised by Pope Francis as a martyr in January 2020, and beatified on 24 September 2016. His feast day is 2 March. On 10 March 2019, George Kageche Mukua, a priest of the congregation, died as one of the passengers on board Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302.

Description  Syzygium francisii is a medium to large size tree, occasionally reaching over 30 metres in height and a 150 cm in trunk diameter. The tree's crown appears dark and dense. The bark is a scaly reddish light brown, with depressions caused by the shedding of scales of bark. Prominent buttresses form at the base.  Leaves, flowers and fruit  The leaves are opposite, simple, entire, 4 to 8 cm long drawn out into a long point at the tip. The leaf margin is often wavy, new growth pinkish. Flowers: white in panicles. Flowers small, less than 6 mm long. Flowering period September to December. The fruit matures from January to April, being a flattened berry, a common shape in many species of Syzygium; the colour is a pale blue, lilac to purple. The flesh is dry and unpalatable to taste. Seed germination is relatively easy and quick, commencing at 20 days. Soaking of the seeds is recommended to drown insect larvae. Fruit are eaten by many types of rainforest birds.

Synthesis Atevirdine synthesis:D. L. Romero, Drugs Future 19, 9 (1995).D. L. Romero et al., (1991 to Upjohn). SAR: Preparation of the pyridylpiperazine moiety starts by aromatic displacement of chlorine from 2-chloro-3-nitropyridine by piperazine to give 3. The secondary amine is then protected as its BOC derivative by reaction with di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (Boc anhydride) to give 4. The nitro group is then reduced by catalytic hydrogenation. Reductive alkylation with acetaldehyde in the presence of lithium cyanoborohydride gives the corresponding N-ethyl derivative. The protecting group is then removed by reaction with TFA. Reaction of the resulting amine with the imidazolide derivative of 5-methoxy-3-indoleacetic acid produces the amide reverse transcriptase inhibitor, atevirdine.

The station was built by Finnish State Railways as the railhead feeder of Riihim√§ki-Saint Petersburg railroad. It was designed by Swedish architects and it opened on 2 November 1871, when the station's first train arrived from Beloostrov. The Sestroretsk spur line was constructed to serve Sestroretsk armory. Societies of the Sestroretsk railway The station was owned and operated by Finnish railways from 1871 to 1873. From 1873 to 1886 it was operated by the private \\"Societies of the Sestroretsk railway\\". This company built a new railway line, which was called Miller's line, and connected to the station at Miller's pier. The organization was devastated in the mid-1880s and, on 1 January 1886, the station was closed along with the branch. World War I In 1914, World War I began. Sestroretsk armory was a leading defensive factory and it was necessary to connect it with the country's railway system. In 1916, the station was restored as a freight terminal. Closure The line did not exist for long. After the revolution Sestroretsk armory had practically stopped production and, in the 1920s, there was a complication of relations between the USSR and Finland. The bridge was blown up and the line was disassembled. New station Later, the part of the line from the bridge straight across the Sestra river was restored and was a part of the Sestroretsk direction. In 1924, a new line was constructed but bypassed this station. The platforms, buildings and structures were taken down to allow the building of new houses in Volodarsky street. The old station was replaced by a new Sestroretsk railway station.

University of Chicago Press with Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation, Chicago and Pittsburgh, 1st edition (September 1, 1994). ) was the architectural firm of Alexander Wadsworth Longfellow, Jr. (1854‚Äì1934), Frank Ellis Alden (1859‚Äì1908), and Alfred Branch Harlow (1857‚Äì1927). The firm, successors to H. H. Richardson, continued to provide structures in the Romanesque revival style established by Richardson that is often referred to as Richardsonian Romanesque. Officially, the firm was Longfellow & Harlow from 1886 until March 1887, with Alden participating as its agent. Then, it was Longfellow, Alden & Harlow, until 1896, when it became Alden & Harlow. The split with Longfellow is described as amicable on page 62 of Margaret Henderson Floyd's book about the firm, and it had more to do with the fact that Longfellow was in Boston and Alden & Harlow had relocated to Pittsburgh and were managing their firm there due to the number of commissions they received. After Alden died, Harlow practiced with different partners in Pittsburgh until his death. Longfellow continued to practice in Boston until his death. The architects Frederick G. Scheibler, Jr., William L. Steele, and Henry M. Seaver trained in the firm's office. Howard K. Jones was the chief draftsman for the Alden & Harlow office. According to Floyd, \\"other young draftsmen in the office played roles that are still for the most part unknown\\". The best documented picture is for the firm's largest commission: the major Carnegie Institute expansion of 1899-1907. Here Jones played a key role, assisted by Steele, Richard Hooker, and John Henry Craner.

Liberati was initiated by Alexander Bard and Jan S√∂derqvist and uses various internet social fora to try to influence the traditional political parties, from Libertarianism at one end via pragmatic Liberalism to liberal Socialism at the other end of the spectrum. Despite early calls for Liberati to become a political party of its own, there are currently no plans to extend the network towards the formation of a separate political party. In addition to Bard and S√∂derqvist, early members associated with the Liberati movement include political scientist Stig-Bj√∂rn Ljunggren, author and columnist Oscar Swartz and Member of Parliament Camilla Lindberg, an outspoken opponent to the FRA law from within the Swedish Liberal Party, and a heroine of the anti-FRA law movement after Lindberg became the only representative of the ruling Swedish Center-Right coalition to vote against the FRA law in the parliamentary vote of June 2008. On 26 September 2010 Liberati was disbanded and replaced with both a cross-party liberal network simply called Liberala N√§tverket (The Liberal Network), and a new party, Liberaldemokraterna, (The Liberal Democrats).

Originally, the Silesian Cutting was a boundary, separating territories of two Western Slavic tribes, the Slezanie and the Opolanie. In the 12th century, along the Cutting a border of Lower Silesia and Upper Silesia was established.Marek Czapli≈Ñski, El≈ºbieta Kaszuba, Gabriela WƒÖs, Ro≈õcis≈Çaw ≈ªerelik, Historia ≈ölƒÖska (History of Silesia) Original from the University of Michigan, 611 pages, Stolica.Opole.pl, G√≥rny ≈ölƒÖsk (Regions of Upper Silesia, an overview.)

For a long time, the Silesian Cutting was used as a natural military obstacle, protecting the area of Opole from raids of the Moravian and Czech tribes. However, it did not prevent the Hussites from invading Silesia in 1420 (see also Hussite Wars). M.Szo≈Çtysek, Jak powsta≈Ç G√≥rny ≈ölƒÖsk at SHVOONG Streszczenia i kr√≥tkie recenzje  Structure  The Silesian Przesieka was a wide, uninhabited border forest, strengthened on the inside by cut-down trees whose branches were twisted together, with thick bushes and sometimes ramparts and trenches from the 8th-9th century blocking movements from the west.Paul M. Barford, The Early Slavs: Culture and Society in Early Medieval Eastern Europe Published by Cornell University Press, 2001. , , 416 pages. Page 146 Gates, which could be closed in dangerous times, controlled all roads leading outwards. The Przesieka was maintained by local Polish peasants and used in their self-defence. If a settlement expanded in size the fortifications were moved outwards. Placenames like Osiek, Ossig, Hag, H√§nchen Przesieka, Lower Silesian Voivodeship or Przesieka, Podlaskie Voivodeship commemorated these unique natural circumstances.

The fortification continued on the other side of the Oder at the Niemodlin woodland, incorporated the woods to the right of the Nysa K≈Çodzka and the Golden and Owl Mountains. From there the cutting turned northeast and incorporated the Sudetes, which separated Silesia and Bohemia, including the foothills on a distance of 80 kilometers. The Przesieka continued up to the Lower Silesian heathland, the border to Lusatia, a region which was especially well fortified by three trenches (German: Dreigr√§ben) and a passage to the west of Szprotawa. From the B√≥br knee the Cutting incorporated the woodlands of Zielona G√≥ra and eastwards the border forests between Silesia and Greater Poland. At the river Barycz the Cutting turned south to close the circle around Lower Silesia. The distribution of the Upper Silesian border forests is relatively unknown. Only the western Preseka at Hrub√Ω Jesen√≠k and its foothills, the woodlands of the northern Carpathian Mountains and the Moravian Gate as well as at the woodlands of the Polish Jura are established. This enclosed area was divided into two chambers by a border zone. This inner Przesieka is in parts preserved until today, visible at the upper Malapane and between Rybnik and Pszczyna. Equally unknown in detail is the division of the Lower Silesian region, which was also partitioned into small chambers divided by strips of woodland.  Impact of German Ostsiedlung  Town-like settlements already existed before the Ostsiedlung, as craftsmen and merchants formed suburbs of fortified strongholds (burg(h)s, castra). Usually, Slavic marketplaces were set at an open range with few or no permanently inhabited buildings and, after Christianization, a church. Market fields (ring, rynek) were in close proximity to fortified strongholds. This system was borrowed from 10th century East Francia and persisted in the Slavic regions until the Ostsiedlung.Sylvia Lettice Thrupp, Change in Medieval Society: Europe North of the Alps, 1050-1500, 1988, pp.30-46, , As the Silesian dukes initiated the German Ostsiedlung the border forests offered the chance to plan irrespective of older settlements. This approach was started by Henry I in the late 12th century, and soon other noble and clerical landlords competitively followed his example. The German settlers cleared the forests and thus destroyed the protective effect of the Preseka. To defend their now unprotected soil the Silesian dukes replaced the dissolving Preseka by a strip of villages, fortified towns and castles. The area became the center of the evolving society (Neustamm) of the German Silesians.

Martna was born in Kreis Wiek in the Governorate of Estonia (in present-day P√§rnu County) and studied in a local village school. Thereafter, he worked as country labourer before going to Tallinn in order to become house painter. At this period, he became acquainted with the European workers' movement, socialism and Marxism. As he was one of the first Estonians to be active in this field, he came to be called \\"the father of Estonian social democracy\\". As a young man, he was also active in Estonian national movement, publishing articles in Postimees and Sakala and collecting folklore material. Mihkel Martna disseminated socialist ideas in Tallinn, at the end 1880s he lived in Tartu and tried to influence students there. He later came into conflict with Peeter Speek and other Tartu socialists and moved back to Tallinn. Martna took part in the 1905 Russian revolution and had to live in exile from 1906 to 1917 (mostly in Switzerland, Germany, Finland). At the beginning of 1918, Martna, having become familiar with the life in independent Finland, decided to support and promote Estonia's independence. He soon formed together with fellow thinkers the Estonian Socialist Workers' Party (Eesti Sotsiaaldemokraatiline T√∂√∂listepartei) and became later the leader of the party's left wing. Martna also belonged to Estonia's foreign delegations. Together with Jaan T√µnisson and Karl Menning, Martna formed the board of the foreign delegation and he was the first representative of Estonia in Germany (1919). Martna was member of the Estonian Provincial Assembly, the Estonian Constituent Assembly and Riigikogu (I to IV). 1929‚Äì1934 Martna was a vice-chairman of Riigikogu. Martna was one of the central figures in determining the political life of the Republic of Estonia, he was also a leading theoretician of the Estonian Socialist Workers' Party.

Its soloists during the war years included Art Pepper, briefly Stan Getz, altoists Boots Mussulli and Bob Lively, and singer Anita O'Day, who starred on Kenton's first big hit, 1944s \\"And Her Tears Flowed Like Wine.\\" By 1945 the band had evolved quite a bit. Pete Rugolo became the chief arranger (extending Kenton's ideas), Bob Cooper and Vido Musso offered very different tenor styles, and June Christy was Kenton's new singer. Her hits -- including \\"Tampico\\" and \\"Across the Alley From the Alamo\\" -- made it possible for Kenton to finance his more ambitious projects. A popular recording of Laura was made, the theme song from the film Laura, starring actress Gene Tierney, and featured the voices of the band. When Kenton disbanded in early 1949, Harry Betts, Art Pepper, Buddy Childers, and Laurindo Almeida were hired by Earle Spencer.  Earle Spencer Orchestra  Lively performed with the Earle Spencer Orchestra from 1946 to 1949. Earle formed his band in 1946 after being discharged from the U.S. Navy. The band was based in Los Angeles and was modeled after the progressive sounds of Stan Kenton, Johnny Richards, and Boyd Raeburn. His 1946 band included former Glenn Miller sideman Wilber Schwartz on clarinet and alto sax and Ray Linn, who had played with Tommy Dorsey, on trumpet. Bob Lively played alto saxophone. Spencer disbanded his band in 1952. The band recorded for the Black and White label in 1946 and 1949. Bob Haywood was vocalist for the 1946 band. Toni Aubin (1924‚Äì1990) joined Spencer as female vocalist in 1949. She married Howard Phillips who was playing sax (1947‚Äì49) in the band. (Bob Lively was also playing in the band.) Toni Aubin recorded \\"Sunday Afternoon\\" and other songs with the Spencer orchestra, but also recorded with the Louis Ohls Orchestra out of Arkadelphia, and the Phil Carreon Big Band out of Los Angeles, California. Through his numerous associations, Lively played alto saxophone, clarinet, and piano among the trumpets of Johnny Carroll, Buddy Childers, John Anderson, Gene Roland, Mel Green, the drums of Gene Krupa, John Varney, and saxophonists Stan Getz, Art Pepper, Bob Gioga (1905‚Äì1999) and Boots Mussulli (1915‚Äì1967). Lively performed with Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Nat King Cole, Woody Herman, Tommy Dorsey, and Benny Goodman.

History  While the pseudo- class \`:hover\` has been used to generate rudimentary animations for years, extensions of CSS into the realm of animation were minimal until the late 2000s decade. As early as 2007, WebKit had announced its intent to include CSS animation, transitions, and transforms as features of WebKit. It also announced the implementation of both implicit and explicit animation through CSS in February 2009. CSS animation has also been put forth as a feature of CSS3, the ongoing draft specification managed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).  Current  [ Interactive SVG] using a hover effect CSS Animations is a module of Cascading Style Sheets. It allows users to hover over objects and an animation will play. Currently, it is adopted by all major search engines. Despite the controversy from those who prefer animation via Javascript, the hover tag is now widely used across the Cascading Style Sheets community.  Scalable Vector Graphics  [ Animated SVG] using CSS 3 In addition to hover, Scalable Vector Graphics supports the @keyframes at-rule, allowing a limited set of transformations to be animated. Firefox and Chrome used the @-moz- keyframes and @-webkit-keyframes extensions, respectively, before @keyframes was added to the CSS 3 specification.http://w3.org/TR/css-animations-1  Browser support  As of June 2011, Firefox 5 includes CSS animations support. CSS animation is also available as a module in the nightly builds of WebKit as well as Google Chrome, Safari 4 and 5 and Safari for iOS (iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad), Android versions 2.x and 3.x, Internet Explorer 10+ and Microsoft Edge browser, the BlackBerry OS 6 web browser, with the \`-webkit-\` prefix. It is also used in iTunes 9 to support iTunes LP files.  Controversy  Early on in the development of the CSS animation it had drawn concern from those who prefer animation via JavaScript or, to a lesser-used extent, Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL); others have claimed that it is a move by Apple Inc., the main sponsor of the WebKit project, to sidestep the inclusion of Adobe Flash (and the incumbent Flash animations) on the company's iOS line of mobile devices which use Safari. Furthermore, although Cascading Style Sheets is a relatively easy to use programming language, many programmers still struggle with making animations. With this problem, several individuals and websites have developed and created open source CSS button animations with codeButton Animations with Code for users to copy. However, even with these previous controversies, CSS animations can be predominately found and widely used across the internet.

History  Main entrance Saint Jacob Church was built in around 1250 as an Eastern Orthodox Church, by the Byzantine Empress for the Byzantine Christians who are on their pilgrimage to Holy Land. Evliya √áelebi states the reason for building the church outside the city walls, was the hostility of city's Armenians towards Byzantines. Adana was ceded to the Mamluk Sultanate in 1359 and in the next decades, many Turkish families moved to the city. To practice their religious duties, the church was converted into a mosque in around 1380 by the Ramazanoƒülu Bey ≈ûihabeddin Ahmed and was known as Eski mosque (), after the built of Ulu Camii. The mosque was renovated in 1501 by Gƒ±y√¢sedd√Æn Halil Bey. Later, his son Piri Mehmet Pa≈üa built its minaret in 1525 and its madrasah in 1558. From mid 19th century, the mosque became known with the current name, getting the name from the oil bazaar opened just next to it. Architecture View from entrance Mosque interior Mosque The praying area has a rectangular shape and it is split into five naves with four rows of columns.

The organization is known for its work in producing independent and innovative research solutions which demonstrate that Australia can thrive through a transition to a zero emissions economy. BZE reports provide detailed pathways for a rapid transition in each major sector of Australia‚Äôs economy.  Research  BZE‚Äôs flagship research shows how all sectors of the Australian economy can decarbonise, repower and benefit from the transition to zero emissions. The Zero Carbon Australia plans, which are published and accessible on the BZE website, cover renewable energy and electricity; energy efficient buildings; sustainable transport; agriculture, farming and land use; and industry.  Million Jobs Plan  In June 2020, in response to the global Covid-19 pandemic and the economic crisis which followed, BZE launched its Million Jobs Plan. The framework for creating 1.8 million jobs was backed by corporate heavyweights Atlassian co-founder, Mike Cannon-Brookes, First State Super CEO, Deanne Stewart, and long-serving corporate director Kevin McCann AO. Christiana Figueres, one of the UN architects of the Paris Agreement, joined BZE‚Äôs panel discussion for the launch of the Million Jobs Plan from Costa Rica, where a poignant blackout meant that Figueres was only able to continue her involvement due to a home battery system powered by solar. This plan was the first stage in a campaign to find and deliver one million new, good, secure, well-paying jobs, to help rebuild the Australian economy and secure a strong future for all Australians. Seven key sectors across the economy have been identified where strategic investment over the next five years would have the most impact and create the most jobs, including Energy, Building, Manufacturing, Transport, Recycling, Land Use and Training. Jobs will be distributed around Australia, including in cities and regions already under pressure from the closure of traditional heavy industry and manufacturing, historical droughts and fires, and high unemployment.  Zero Carbon Communities  Zero Carbon Communities is an initiative of Beyond Zero Emissions designed to support local communities to reduce emissions and thrive. The program provides support and resources to empower local communities. Together with Ironbark Sustainability, BZE has developed the Snapshot community climate tool, which provides nationally consistent, community-wide greenhouse gas profiles for every local government area in Australia. In 2020, Zero Carbon Communities partnered with the ABC‚Äôs series, Fight for Planet A: Our Climate Challenge, and was featured in their Community Solutions Plan.The ABC‚Äôs three part series explores how we can all reduce our individual and collective carbon emissions. It aimed to empower and motivate Australians to take action on climate change.  Renewable Energy Superpower  In 2015, BZE published the Renewable Energy Superpower report, proposing that nations with abundant renewable energy resources, like Australia, can be the energy Superpowers of the renewable energy era. The report showed that if Australia made the most of its renewable resource it could be the natural home for energy intensive industry, given the ever decreasing cost of renewable technologies. The term ‚Äòrenewable energy superpower‚Äô was used for the first time in BZE‚Äôs report, which was launched by Prof Ross Garnaut, and has passed into common use.  Activities  In addition to its collaborative research and technical support programs, the group gives webinars and presentations nationally, runs a public discussion group and has two weekly radio shows on 3CR interviewing celebrity guests on climate science and global warming solutions. BZE takes part in many local events and conferences around Australia. In 2016, BZE became a signatory to the campaign for a Declaration of a Climate Emergency by the Australian Parliament. In the lead up to the UN COP22 at Marrakech Morocco, BZE officially became a partner in the Global 100% Renewable Energy Campaign.  Funding  BZE is independently funded by donations, mostly from philanthropic trusts and individuals, as well as grants and commissioned research and projects from local and state government organisations. BZE does not accept donations or commissioned work from political parties.

Lower ranks of Privy Chamberlains (Honorary Chamberlains of Purple Robes, Chamberlains extra Urbem, Honorary Privy Chaplains, and Honorary Chaplains extra Urbem) were abolished,Annuario Pontificio 2012, p. 1853 making Chaplain of His Holiness the first (lowest) of the three ranks of Monsignor.

The nomination of candidates extra urbem may be granted at the request of their bishop through the Apostolic Nunciature, subject to the examination of the merits of the person considered for this rank and to the criteria of the Holy See.

A number of bacterial and plant toxins act by inhibiting protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. The toxins of the Shiga and ricin family inactivate 60S ribosomal subunits by an N-glycosidic cleavage, which releases a specific adenine base from the sugar-phosphate backbone of 28S rRNA. Members of the family include shiga and shiga-like toxins, and type I (e.g. trichosanthin and luffin) and type II (e.g. ricin, agglutinin, and abrin) ribosome inactivating proteins (RIPs). All these toxins are structurally related. RIPs have been of considerable interest because of their potential use, conjugated with monoclonal antibodies, as immunotoxins to treat cancers. Further, trichosanthin has been shown to have potent activity against HIV-1-infected T cells and macrophages. Elucidation of the structure-function relationships of RIPs has therefore become a major research effort. It is now known that RIPs are structurally related. A conserved glutamic residue has been implicated in the catalytic mechanism; this lies near a conserved arginine, which also plays a role in catalysis. Examples include: *Abrin *Beetin *Ricin *Saporin *Shiga toxin *Spiroplasma proteins *Trichosanthin *Viscumin (European mistletoe) *Pokeweed antiviral protein (Phytolacca americana) Ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs) are separated into three types based on protein domain composition: * Type I: RIPs-I are polypeptides composed of an A domain. This is the site of N-glycosidase activity. * Type II: RIPs-II are composed of an A domain with similar catalytic activity to Type I RIPs, and a B domain with lectin-binding properties. These properties facilitate entry into the cell, thus making Type II particularly cytotoxic. The A and B domains are fused together by disulfide bonds. **RIPs-II are considered potent toxins. The B domain is able to bind galactosyl moieties on the cell surface which facilitates entry into the cell, where the A domain can perform its catalytic activity on 28S rRNA in the cytosol. * Type III: RIPs- III are separated into two subgroups. One subgroup contains the same original RIP domain (A), and a C-terminal with unknown functionality. The other subgroup is similar to Type I, but contains a site for inactivation. They exist in bacteria and plants. Only a minority of RIPs are toxic to humans when consumed, and proteins of this family are found in the vast majority of plants used for human consumption, such as Rice, Maize and Barley.

Name The name Stara Vrhnika literally means 'old Vrhnika'. Stara Vrhnika was attested in Latin church records as ex superiore Verchnik, and as Alt Oberlaibach oder Gorena Verchnik between 1764 and 1783. The village was originally called Gornja Vrhnika or Zgornja Vrhnika (literally, 'upper Vrhnika') in Slovene, referring to its position about 30 meters above neighboring Vrhnika. With the arrival of the German-speaking Habsburgs, Vrhnika became known as Oberlaibach (literally, 'upper Ljubljana'), which would have made the German designation for Stara Vrhnika the semantically awkward Ober-Oberlaibach. It was therefore called Alt Oberlaibach (literally, 'old upper Ljubljana') in German, and this was the source of the Slovene name Stara Vrhnika.\\"Zgodovina Stare Vrhnike.\\" Ogrin, Rafael. 1961. \\"Iz vrhni≈°ke preteklosti.\\" Kronika: ƒçasopis za slovensko krajevno zgodovino 9(1): 1‚Äì4.

He was soon spotted by his local semi-professional team and quickly moved through the ranks of non-league soccer, culminating in a winning appearance (4-1) at Wembley Stadium in 1979 for Billericay Town in the FA Vase. Five years later he reappeared at the same venue in the same competition, this time winning 3‚Äì2 with Stansted in what The Times described as \\"the biggest upset in FA Vase history\\". After 13 years playing semi-professionally in the Southern League, Isthmian League and Essex Senior League, Jamie hung up his boots and within a year moved to Singapore. He briefly came out of retirement for one season in the FAS Premier League (the forerunner of the S.League), playing for the now-defunct team Tyrwhitt Soccerites. He established a reputation for scoring with headers, and at the end of the season was named the league's second best player of the year by The Straits Times. First appearing on TV in May 1992, working in the studio on the FA Cup Final between Liverpool and Sunderland, Jamie went on to do commentary work on the Malaysia Cup and the S.League before joining ESPN Star Sports. There, he has commentated on the Chinese Super League, the K-League, the UEFA Champions League, the Asian Games, the Asian World Cup Qualifiers and the Tiger Cup, as well as dabbling in La Liga and Serie A. He first worked as a studio pundit on the Premier League in the 2000-2001 season, and has been heavily involved with commenting on that league ever since. Since 1989, he has also worked as an Economics teacher in Singapore. He is currently the Programme Head for the Humanities Programme at Raffles Institution. Reeves is married with two children.

The National Railroad of Mexico (Ferrocarril Nacional de M√©xico) was one of the primary pre-nationalization railways of Mexico. Incorporated in Colorado in 1880 as the Mexican National Railway (Ferrocarril Nacional Mexicano), and headed by General William Jackson Palmer of the Denver and Rio Grande Railway, it completed a narrow gauge main line from Mexico City to Nuevo Laredo in September 1888 after an 1887 reorganization as the Mexican National Railroad. At its north end, the Texas Mexican Railway, owned since 1883, ran east from Laredo to the Gulf of Mexico at Corpus Christi; a second Gulf connection was completed in 1905 through a branch from Monterrey to Matamoros. Other branches included a cut-off from Mexico City through Quer√©taro to Celaya and an incomplete Pacific extension from Ac√°mbaro to Uruapan. (Another piece of the latter, from Colima to Manzanillo, remained with the Mexican National Construction Company, and was acquired by the Mexican Central Railway in 1905.Powell, p. 130) In 1886 the railway commissioned Abel Briquet to take a series of photographs, which provide documentation of the railways at that time. After reorganisation in 1902 The company was reincorporated again in Utah in February 1902 as the National Railroad of Mexico, and completed standard-gauging the main line in November 1903. The National subsequently acquired three narrow gauge companies in central Mexico. First it leased the Michoac√°n and Pacific Railway in 1900, giving it branches from Maravatio to Zit√°cuaro and Angangueo. In 1903 it acquired the Interoceanic Railway of Mexico, which included a main line from Mexico City to Veracruz and a number of branches, in exchange for the Mexican government gaining control of the National. Finally, in 1906, the Hidalgo and Northeastern Railroad, from Mexico City northeast to Tortugas, Pachuca, and Irolo, became part of the National Railroad of Mexico's system.Fred Wilbur Powell, The Railroads of Mexico, Stratford Company (Boston), 1921, pp. 133-135Manual of Statistics Company (New York), The Manual of Statistics: Stock Exchange Hand-Book, 1908, pp. 210-211 Six years after the government gained control, the properties of the National and Hidalgo and Northeastern were transferred to the Ferrocarriles Nacionales de M√©xico (National Railways of Mexico) in January 1909.

OEL's demands included the abolition of compulsory Anglo-Saxon, new optional papers in women‚Äôs writing and in literary theory. Oxford English Limited was created by Daniel Baron- Cohen, Ken Hirschkop and Robin Gable, with support from Terry Eagleton at Wadham College. It organised a programme of seminars, visiting speakers, conferences, debates, student questionnaires and campaigns in pursuit of its aims. A typical highlight was the ‚ÄòState of Criticism‚Äô conference on 8 March 1986 (masterminded by President of OEL, Peter Higginson), at which more than 400 people assembled in the English Faculty building in St Cross to hear Raymond Williams, Terry Eagleton, Francis Mulhern and others discuss the future of literary studies. OEL activists in later years included Ros Ballaster, David Hawkes, Tony Pinkney, Carol Watts, Stephanie Flood, Forbes Morlock, Sally Ledger, Alastair Williams, Ben Morgan, Terry Murphy and Giles Goodland. Tetsuo Maruko and Craig Dowler played supporting roles from the sidelines. There was some limited support from within the Faculty from David Norbrook and Paul Hamilton and Stephen Regan at Ruskin College. In April 1986 OEL created a journal, News from Nowhere: Journal of the Oxford English Faculty Opposition (ISSN 0957-1868) to further its local polemic aims and to advance work in left-wing and feminist literary theory and cultural studies more generally. Nine issues were published between 1986 and 1991. The editor Tony Pinkney‚Äôs contributions across these issues offer a sustained and theorised history (and counter-history) of Oxford English Studies from Matthew Arnold to the 1980s. A one-volume selection from News from Nowhere will be published by Kelmsgarth Press in 2015. The OEL project at Oxford has been recognised in later histories of the rise of literary theory in the UK. For example, Josephine M. Guy and Ian Small note in their Politics and Value in English Studies that ‚Äòthere has been a long-standing debate in the Oxford periodical News from Nowhere about the future of English studies in that university‚Äô; and Andrew Milner, in his important book Re-Imagining Cultural Studies: The Promise of Cultural Materialism, remarks that ‚Äòa self-proclaimed ‚Äúthird generation‚Äù of radical literary theorists would coalesce around Oxford English Limited and the journal, News from Nowhere‚Äô. The Oxford English Faculty of the late 1970s, had not proved able to open itself to the waves of Continental theory which were then remaking the very field of literary studies, though work was being done by figures like Anne Jefferson and David Robey in Oxford European language studies. Oxford English Limited, despite its exiguous resources as it battled an entrenched and powerful Faculty, thus represented the new energies of the subject, and it and its William Morris- inspired journal remain a small but colourful chapter in the wider literary theory ‚Äòrevolution‚Äô of the 1980s and 1990s.

In December 2010, Const√¢ncio was appointed vice president of the European Central Bank, for an eight-year mandate, being responsible for banking supervision. Shortly after, in April 2011, the Portuguese Government would request international financial assistance as the State itself would be declared insolvent.

The most notable works included La Fornarina (After Raphael) (1929), with an estimated value of ¬£2 million - ¬£3 million, and Femmes et Oiseaux, which was expected to fetch ¬£4 million - ¬£8 million. Portugal hoped to earn at least $50 million from the sale. A group of opposition lawmakers appealed to Portugal‚Äôs public prosecutor to stop the sale. Lisbon‚Äôs administrative court, however, ruled that the sale had not been decided on directly by the government of Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho and that Parvalorem had not breached any administrative rule.

He began in the 1960s as a painter on traditional surfaces, in Paris, but moved to his home country in Bavaria and started to plant creations, putting them in Nature's hands to develop, and eventually disappear. As his work became more ephemeral, Udo introduced photography as part of his art to document and share it. Perhaps the best known example of his work for the general public is the cover design for Peter Gabriel's OVO.Hypergallery.com profile Nils-Udo seeks to offer a mutualist vision wherein nature as environment is an omnipresent backdrop. In revealing the diversity in a specific environment, he establishes links between human and natural history, between nature and humanity that are always there, yet seldom recognized.  Selected works and projects  OVO (2000)  Peter Gabriel contacted Nils Udo to create an installation for the cover for his new album OVO. Udo created a nest-like structure supported by tree trunks, which made it very heavy. Inside the nest lay the child of a Real World (Studio in England where album was recorded) employee (The child, Josh, is the son of Susie Millns at Real World‚Äôs Art department). The photograph was taken and then the installation was moved into Peter Gabriels's garden nearby. Finally due to issues of what to do with it the gardener set the structure on fire. This did not upset Udo as his work is transient and there is a photograph that keeps the artwork still living. Its called OVO because it has an OVO form.  Stone-Age-Man (2001)  Stone-Age-Man is a monumental sculpture in Wittgensteiner-Sauerland, Germany. Udo creates the effect of an ancient temple by installing in the middle of the structure an enormous cube of rock framed by a monumental architectural trunk form made out of wood. The quartzite monolith weighs almost 150 tons and, integrated into the peaceful grandeur of the forest, it forms a monument and memorial in its own right: its size, its timeless association with the earth, and its uniqueness. When exposed to this powerful entity, the viewer experiences his/her own temporality and vulnerability.  Radeau d'Automne (2013-2014)  The community of d‚Äô√âguzon-Chant√¥me and Crozant had the desire of local authorities to initiate artistic and cultural projects in a remote rural areas based on the environmental qualities of its sites. Udo proposed Radeau d' Automne as a monumental sculpture designed with natural materials. In the shape of a stylized maple half-leaf, 6.80 meters long and 3.90 meters high, the work is built in round trunks with light chestnut wood, assembled \\"with the old \\"tenons, mortises and ankles. This traditional, solid and aesthetic blend, as well as the use of a local essence and strong identity, reinforces the link to the territory. It was here to give shape to a space, the space of the valley of the Creuse, marked by the history of pictorial currents of the nineteenth century. and 20th century. and thus exposing himself to a new reading, to a new look: the wooden raft and water, leaf reflecting on the river at the foot of the granite ruins and recalling the steep ridges of the surrounding landscape. When asked about this work Udo responded ‚ÄúEven if I work parallel to nature and only intervene with the greatest possible care, a basic internal contradiction remains. It is a contradiction that underlies all of my work, which itself can‚Äôt escape the inherent fatality of our existence. It harms what it touches : the virginity of nature‚Ä¶ To realize what is possible and latent in Nature, to literally realize what has never existed, utopia becomes reality. A second life suffices. The event has taken place. I have only animated it and made it visible.‚Äù  Other Important Works  * Tower: Benthelm sandstone, Nordhorn, Germany, 1982 * Waterhouse: spruce trunks, birch branches, willow switches and sod on tidal flats,Waddensee mudflats, Holland, 1982 * Chestnut leaf, vetch flowers, pond, Vassiviere, Limousin, France, 1986 * Bindweed flowers held in their journey on a stream by a stick dam.

During the course of the play, they reverse roles with relation to each other, to the ownership or possession of the flat, and to their relationship with or possession of Jane. The changing furnishings of the room reflect their changing roles and who is in power over whom at various points in time. At first Jane appears to be submissive in relation to the men; but as the action develops, at times she appears to dominate each man and both of them.

The school was named after Mother Ursula Frayne to publicly commemorate the first leader of the Sisters of Mercy and founder of many Catholic schools in Western Australia.  History  A group of the Sisters of Mercy, led by Mother Clare Buggy, arrived from Northern Ireland in 1899 and created their first school in the current place of the Duncan street campus, naming it St. Joachim's School. Our Lady Help of Christians School was built in the areas of East Victoria in 1936 to supply education for newcomers to the suburb. In the 1950s, the Archbishop noticed that a boys' school had not yet been built in the south-east suburbs of Perth and so he asked the Congregation of Christian Brothers in Sydney for help, while the East Victorian Parish donated land worth around ‚Ç§2,000. St. Francis Xavier College was finally finished in 1953 and was staffed by the Christian Brothers. However, with declining enrolments at Xavier College, the college united with Our Lady Help of Christians School, and soon afterwards, amalgamated with St. Joachim's School to become Ursula Frayne Catholic College.

A multiple medal winner at European and World level, her most notable success are during the Paralympic games at Beijing and London where she won a bronze in the sprint (2008) and silver in the long jump (2012). Stefanie was also a semi-finalist on Celebrity MasterChef 2018. Personal history Reid was born in New Zealand to British parents (Scottish father, English mother). The family moved to Toronto, Ontario, Canada when she was aged 4. Reid lost her right foot in a boating accident, aged 16. (Speaking live on UK Channel 4 TV, she said that the accident happened when she was 15.) Her life was saved by a surgeon in Toronto who stemmed the blood flow through amputation. Reid is married to Canadian wheelchair racer Brent Lakatos, and they now live in England where they both train at Loughborough University. Athletics career Sports-loving before the accident, she played rugby union, but encountered difficulties after her amputation with referees who felt the artificial leg could injure other players. Deciding to concentrate on her studies, she gained a full scholarship to Queen's University to study biochemistry. After joining the campus track and field team, three years later she competed at the World Championships.

She switched allegiance to Great Britain at the start of 2010. In 2010, BBC presenter and producer Matthew Stadlen spent a day with Reid for the news programme The Road With... A Paralympian. In April 2013, it was announced that Reid would feature in the latest campaign for British high-street store Debenhams, the first high street chain to use disabled models in its campaigns. Reid's photo was featured in British Vogue magazine in April 2013. The imagery celebrates diversity in the retail sector. Reid attempted to qualify to represent Scotland in the main long jump competition at the 2014 Commonwealth Games. She did not meet the qualifying standard of 6.2 metres, although she set a world record for the T44 class at the Sainsbury's Glasgow Grand Prix (5.47m) whilst attempting to qualify. Despite not qualifying for the Commonwealth Games, Reid won gold at the IPC European Championships, beating the former world record holder, Marie-Am√©lie Le Fur by 4cm.

The rear end of the locomotive of the freight train was pushed high up in the air on top of its first car.  Chronology of events  The InterCity train 72 en route from Iisalmi to Helsinki via Kouvola was scheduled to pass freight train 2051 in Airaksela, north of Suonenjoki, with the freight train waiting on the passing loop and the InterCity using the main line. On the day of the accident though the freight train was running 30 minutes late. The train dispatcher was planning to make the pass at Suonenjoki railway station, which would delay the departure of the InterCity by 3 minutes. A route was secured for the InterCity to the Suonenjoki railway station, where it was signaled to stop and wait for the freight train to pass the station. However, before the freight train could arrive at Suonenjoki, the InterCity left the station on schedule at 5:57:01, missing the red \\"stop\\" aspect of the signal. Upon noticing the approaching train the drivers of both trains activated the emergency brakes and, when the collision seemed inevitable, jumped off the trains. The dispatcher noticed that the main track was occupied by the wrong train and immediately started calling both trains on radio. No answer was heard, however, as the drivers had already jumped out and the trains collided. Due to the high velocity of the passenger train ‚Äì ‚Äì and the large mass of the freight train, running at ) on impact, the collision was violent. The whole InterCity train moved back and the first two cars of the freight train were pushed under its locomotive. This forced the rear end of the locomotive to rise high up in the air and touch the overhead lines. The cars luckily remained on the tracks, which were running on a high embankment.  Causes  The accident was caused by the driver of the InterCity train ignoring the stop aspect of the main signal. The driver heard the conductor's \\"ready\\" bell signal and concentrated on leaving the station by the second. A signal repeater was possibly malfunctioning. Other contributing factors were the bright daylight that prevented the driver from clearly seeing the red signal, and the general \\"obsession\\" among InterCity drivers to obey the timetable by the second.  Aftermath  The accident, coupled with the Jyv√§skyl√§ rail accident, showed the importance of the automatic train control system, which was installed on all major lines during the following years, and was later expanded to cover all passenger lines and all goods-only lines with the exception of lines which see only a maximum of few trains a day. The two locomotives, Sr1 units 3042 (freight train) and 3031 (InterCity) were refurbished and returned to service. As the result of this accident and the expansion of automatic train control, signal repeaters were removed from all stations except the Helsinki Central railway station.

Biography Christopher Hamilton Fyfe was born in England in 1920 to a family of Scottish ancestry. His father moved to Ontario, Canada, where he became principal of Queen's University. The family subsequently moved to Aberdeen, where his father served a similar role at Aberdeen University.\\"Christopher Fyfe ‚Äì Pioneer of African history\\" (obituary), The Scotsman, 16 September 2008 Fyfe graduated from Gordonstoun School and entered University College, Oxford.John Hargreaves, \\"Christopher Fyfe ‚Äì Historian whose work sparked a cultural revival in Sierra Leone\\" (obituary), The Guardian, 28 October 2008. His studies were interrupted by a spell in the Army during World War II as a gunner. After graduating from college, he became a school teacher in D√ºsseldorf, West Germany. In 1950 Fyfe was invited by his brother-in-law, who was with the colonial secretariat in Freetown, to organise the Sierra Leonean archives. After two years as the government archivist, preserving and classifying precious documents, and teaching assistants, he returned to England. There he lived first in London, then Bristol and Belfast. Fyfe spent ten years working on his seminal History of Sierra Leone (1962). He modelled his 852-page text on James Joyce's novel Ulysses, writing it as a single block of text. When the publisher demanded chapters, Fyfe inserted numbered breaks. In his masterwork, Fyfe explored the history of the Creole (Krio people) of Sierra Leone, celebrating their role as \\"the unrecognised vehicle by which not only British rule but trade, education, and Christianity, were conveyed to west Africa\\". His work stimulated scholars from Sierra Leone, who studied the Creoles specifically. Some Creole scholars later adopted the ethnonym of the term 'Krio' for both the Sierra Leone Creole people and the creole language. Following the publication of his book, Fyfe took up a lectureship at the University of Edinburgh in 1962, at the newly founded Centre of African Studies. He became a reader in 1964, retaining this position until his retirement in 1991. The bicentenary of Freetown was celebrated in 1987 with an international, interdisciplinary conference, at which Fyfe was honoured as a father of the Krio cultural revival. He edited the Journal of African History and wrote numerous reviews of new books in the field. He regularly revised his lectures in light of the latest trends in historical research. He published a biography of James Africanus Horton, the first African graduate of the University of Edinburgh; a collection of letters written by freedmen who settled in Sierra Leone; and edited works with other historians. Fyfe produced a shorter history of Sierra Leone, which was used as a school text book in Sierra Leone. He was a mentor to many younger researchers of Sierra Leone. Some became key figures in the intellectual establishment of Freetown. Some became at odds with various governments and had to go into exile. Fyfe was active in the arts scene in Edinburgh. He helped preserve Old Town from motorway development that would have cut through the historic architecture. He died in London in 2008, aged 87.

McFadden finished in 5th place in the Women's . Just over a month after Sochi, McFadden returned to wheelchair racing at the London Marathon, where she successfully defended her title in a new course record time. In 2015 McFadden won the NYC marathon, and broke its women's course record by seven minutes and 20 seconds (her time was 1 hour, 43 minutes and four seconds). On October 8, 2017 McFadden won the Bank of America Chicago Marathon. On April 16, 2018, McFadden won the 122nd Boston Marathon. Activism McFadden had difficulty competing at high school. Atholton High School would not allow her to race at the same time as able-bodied runners, with officials saying her racing chair created a safety hazard and gave her an unfair advantage (as the best wheelchair racers are noticeably faster than runners over long distances). She competed in separate wheelchair events at high school meets, meaning that she would circle around an otherwise empty track by herself, which embarrassed her. In 2005 Tatyana and Deborah McFadden filed suit against the Howard County Public School System and won the right for her to race at the same time as the runners starting in 2006, though her score would not be counted for her team. Her legal victory led to its own controversies, though. In 2006, one of her Atholton teammates lost her victory in the 1600 meters at the state championships after McFadden was ruled to have been acting as a \\"pacer\\" for her, by encouraging her rather than racing on her own. And in 2008, McFadden collided with a rival runner from Bishop McNamara High School after a 200-meter race, inflicting bruises and cuts to the runner's legs and making her miss her conference title meet from the injuries. McFadden's lawsuit is credited for the eventual passage of the Maryland Fitness and Athletics Equity for Students with Disabilities Act, requiring schools to give students with disabilities the opportunity to compete in interscholastic athletics.\\"Public schools open sports to athletes with disabilities\\" , by Glenn Graham and Jeff Seidel, The Baltimore Sun, March 25, 2010.

Mentuhotep is one of the best attested officials of the Middle Kingdom period. There is a series of statues found at Karnak, showing him as a scribe. On these he has been given the title of overseer of all royal works, which would suggest that he was involved in overseeing the construction of the temple at Karnak. At el-Lisht he had a large tomb next to the pyramid of Senusret I. When it was found it was badly damaged, but there are remains of high quality reliefs and fragments of statues. The burial chamber still contained two sarcophagi, one smashed and the other one well preserved, made of granite and with brightly painted interiors. In Abydos a large stele is erected in Mentuhotep's name. It is inscribed with a number of official titles, including those of vizier. The vizier's title does not appear in the tomb of Mentuhotep. Therefore, there is some discussion as to whether he was actually a vizier or whether it was an honorific title. In year 22 of Senusret I a certain Sobekhotep is attested as treasurer. Mentuhotep must have been his successor. It is unknown whether he was still in office under Amenemhet II. Literature *Dieter Arnold: Middle Kingdom Tomb Architecture at Lisht.

It gradually began to incorporate foreign legions of the SS under its operational control. After the western legions departed for refit, it began operating with Latvian volunteer formations and eventually was redesignated the 2nd Latvian SS Infantry Brigade and on the 18 May 1943, and used as the cadre in the formation of the Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (2nd Latvian) in January 1944. Operational history The 2 SS Infantry Brigade was raised on 15 May 1941 and was placed under the command of Army Group North Rear Area for the invasion of the Soviet Union. Prior to this, the role that the unit would undertake during the assault was discussed in a meeting between Henning von Tresckow and of the RFSS office, held just three days before hostilities between Germany and the Soviet Union began. In this meeting it was decided that the 2 SS Infantry Brigade along with the 1 SS Infantry Brigade and the SS Cavalry Brigade would be used in the rear of the advancing army to conduct rear-security operations as well as assisting in rounding up the Jewish population. A few weeks later they took part in the mass murder of the population of the occupied territories, their victims for 1941 could be measured in the tens of thousands.Heer et al 2000, p. 136.

The existing 18th, 24th, and 26th Latvian Police Battalions were used to form the Brigade's 2nd SS Volunteer Regiment. They were then sent for training at Krasnoye Selo, where Himmler added the 16th Latvian Police Battalion to the brigade in February. On 18 May 1943, these Latvian Battalions along with the other three Latvian Legion battalions were incorporated into the 2 SS Infantry Brigade, and re-designated the 2 SS Latvian Brigade. The Dutch, Flemish and Norwegian formations were then removed from the brigade and the 2 SS Latvian Brigade was deployed with Army Group North Rear Area. It was placed under the command of Brigadef√ºhrer Fritz von Scholz.

Although less advanced in development than the other ammunition component of the program, the caseless round has already produced significant results. Having replicated Dynamit Nobel's ACR ammunition, the HITP (High Ignition Temperature Propellant, which is hexogen/octogen-based to decrease heat sensitivity) ammunition was modified to a 5.56 mm round. Tests proved the ammunition's usability, and development of the weapon was advanced using knowledge gained from the cased version.  History  The Alliant Techsystems ammunition production team cut production time and costs by reducing the number of steps used to complete processing from fourteen to two. The second spiral of caseless ammunition was rolled out in 2008, with the necessary facilities to produce the ammunition in bulk completed. It reduced the weight and volume of standard ammunition (by 51% and 40%, respectively), and it neared Technology Readiness Level 5. The development of the third spiral was initiated, with the goal of developing a cheaper and more environmentally friendly binder. It also aimed to reduce heat ablation on the inside of the weapon by modifying the propellant's burn rate, and by giving the round an exterior coating to absorb or prevent transferred heat. Caseless ammunition also produces no ejected shells, which improves the weapon's resistance against environmental contamination, and it eliminates the need to collect and recycle empty brass, as is needed with current firearms. In August 2013, AAI Corporation was awarded a $2.05 million contract to continue developing parts of the LSAT program. Part of the contract is to refine 5.56 mm caseless ammunition prototypes for testing. The caseless ammunition effort will focus on improving propellant and ignition formulations in a 5.56 mm configuration.AAI Awarded $2.05 Million Contract for Continued Lightweight Small Arms Technologies Development - AAICorp press release, 6 August 2013 See also *Caseless ammunition References Category:Upcoming products Category:Caseless firearms ","title":"LSAT caseless ammunition"},{"id":"21633889","text":"A. esculenta may refer to: * Alaria esculenta, a kelp species * Aristoclesia esculenta, a synonym for Platonia insignis, a tree species native to South America in the humid forests of Brazil, Paraguay, parts of Colombia and northeast to Guyana See also * List of Latin and Greek words commonly used in systematic names#E ","title":"A. esculenta"},{"id":"21633896","text":"Rene Nielsen is a Paralympian athlete from Denmark competing mainly in category P56 pentathlon events.

It was the most commercially successful of the Stone Poneys' three studio albums. Release data The album was released in the LP format on Capitol in June 1967 in both monaural and stereophonic editions (catalogue numbers T 2763 and ST 2763, respectively), and subsequently, on 8-track tape (catalogue number 8XT 2763) and cassette (catalogue number C4-80129). In 1995, Capitol reissued the album on CD (catalogue number CDP-80129). Raven issued a 27-track \\"two-fer\\" CD In 2008, featuring all tracks from this and the band's first album (under its 1975 reissue name, The Stone Poneys Featuring Linda Ronstadt), plus four tracks from their third album, Linda Ronstadt, Stone Poneys and Friends, Vol. III. Notes on the tracks In a departure from the first album, Linda Ronstadt was the lead vocalist on almost all songs, with only occasional harmony vocals. The exception is the title song, \\"Evergreen\\" (also released on the B-side of the album's first single, \\"One for One\\"). Kenny Edwards sang lead on \\"Part One\\", while \\"Part Two\\" is an instrumental. Both parts have a psychedelic rock feel and feature sitar playing (also by Edwards). The album contains the band's biggest hit, \\"Different Drum\\", written by Mike Nesmith prior to his joining The Monkees. The Stone Poneys' version went to No. 12 on Billboard's Hot 100 chart (with 'featuring Linda Ronstadt' on the single label; she was the only band member on the track). As Edwards recalled, the band based their original recording of the song on a version by The Greenbriar Boys from their 1966 album Better Late than Never!: \\"We cut a version very much like that, with mandolin, kind of a jug bandy, bluegrass-lite version.\\"Online excerpt, Richie Unterberger, Eight Miles High: Folk-Rock's Flight from Haight-Ashbury to Woodstock, 2003: Backbeat Books, . Retrieved April 5, 2009. Record producer Nik Venet, sensing that the song could be a hit, had Ronstadt re-record it with other musicians. However, \\"Different Drum\\" did not chart until November 1967, after the band's four-month tour to support the album; Edwards had already left the Stone Poneys by then. The first single from the album, \\"One for One,\\" did not chart. It was co-written by Austin DeLone, later a member of seminal country rock band Eggs Over Easy, a group credited with launching the pub rock movement in Great Britain. Five of the songs were co-written by band members Bobby Kimmel and Edwards. Kimmel also co-wrote \\"New Hard Times\\" ‚Äì with the unusual theme of examining the downside of '60s affluence ‚Äì with Mayne Smith, a member of the San Francisco Bay Area's first bluegrass band, the Redwood Canyon Ramblers.Redwood Canyon Ramblers. Retrieved June 6, 2009. Many of the other songwriters featured on the album, like the Stone Poneys themselves, were struggling singer-songwriters on the Los Angeles folk scene. Steve Gillette contributed \\"Song about the Rain\\" and \\"Back on the Street Again\\", and sang harmony vocals with Ronstadt on the latter. Sunshine Company had their biggest hit with \\"Back on the Street Again\\" (reaching No. 36 in Billboard); and Gillette included it on his eponymous debut album; both versions were released in 1967. More than 30 years later, West Coast bluegrass band Laurel Canyon Ramblers (led by Herb Pederson) released the song as the title track of their third CD, in 1998. \\"December Dream,\\" the album's opening track, was written by John Braheny, who had a brief career as a singer- songwriter before moving on to other areas of the music business. Fred Neil recorded the song in the same general time period, although it remained unreleased until the 1998 double-CD compilation album The Many Sides of Fred Neil. Braheny also included it on his eccentric 1970 LP, Some Kind of Change.

Structure  All possess a similar structure, with a beta-alpha-beta fold characteristic of nucleotide binding proteins. The fold comprises a parallel beta-8/alpha-8-barrel, which contains a novel NADP-binding motif. The binding site is located in a large, deep, elliptical pocket in the C-terminal end of the beta sheet, the substrate being bound in an extended conformation. The hydrophobic nature of the pocket favours aromatic and apolar substrates over highly polar ones. Binding of the NADPH coenzyme causes a massive conformational change, reorienting a loop, effectively locking the coenzyme in place. This binding is more similar to FAD- than to NAD(P)-binding oxidoreductases. Examples Some proteins of this family contain a potassium channel beta chain regulatory domain; these are reported to have oxidoreductase activity.

Singer Linda Ronstadt would release her first solo album the following year. While ostensibly a Stone Poneys album, Vol. III represents a transition and a shift in focus from the first two releases by the band, formed in 1965 as a harmony group with Ronstadt as an occasional soloist, to the singer's solo career. Billing Ronstadt as the lead singer (in concert bookings as well as on the third album) was demanded by Capitol Records executives and encouraged by producer Nik Venet, who all saw her potential as a solo artist with the recording and subsequent success of \\"Different Drum,\\" a single from the previous album. The song, 'featuring Linda Ronstadt', was backed by outside musicians instead of her bandmates Kenny Edwards and Bobby Kimmel ‚Äì creating tensions in the band that would worsen, irrevocably damaging morale. Edwards quit the group during the recording sessions for their third album, following a brief tour in early 1968; and Kimmel would leave later that year.Ronstadt, Linda (2013). Simple Dreams: a musical memoir. New York: Simon & Schuster. pp. 42-44, 48. . The new direction meant augmenting the trio with extra musicians, and downplaying Edwards' and Kimmel's songwriting contributions in favor of new repertoire in a different musical style. Rather than the folk rock of the first two Stone Poneys albums, most of the songs on Vol. III are in the country rock style that would mark Ronstadt's subsequent work. This is particularly true of the two songs released as singles, \\"Some of Shelly's Blues\\" and \\"Up to My Neck in High Muddy Water\\". All three band members were pictured on the covers of the first two albums, while only Ronstadt appears on this front cover. The back cover photo shows her among a group of friends and neighbors (including musicologist Charles Seeger and singer-songwriter Tim Buckley) in front of the house on Hart Avenue in Santa Monica, California, that was a communal residence for some of them, including Ronstadt (Seeger and Buckley lived nearby).Ronstadt, Linda (2013).

Release data The album was released in April 1968 in the LP format by Capitol in both monaural and stereophonic editions (catalogue numbers T 2863 and ST 2863, respectively), and on 8-track tape (8XT 2863). A Capitol CD reissue appeared in 1995 (catalogue number 80130). The volume number in the title uses a Roman numeral rather than the Arabic numeral used on the previous release. Several of the songs from Vol. III appear on subsequent compilations, including Stoney End on Pickwick Records in 1972 and Different Drum in 1974, the latter album a Capitol release credited solely to Linda Ronstadt. In 2008, Raven Records in Australia issued a 27-track CD, The Stone Poneys, comprising all the tracks from the band's first two albums, The Stone Poneys and Evergreen, Volume 2, plus four tracks from the third album. Notes on the tracks Vol. III includes only two Bobby Kimmel-Kenny Edwards compositions. For the remaining tracks, Ronstadt sought out material by such well-regarded songwriters as Tim Buckley and Laura Nyro, as well as songs by writers represented on the first two albums, like Michael Nesmith, and Steve Gillette and Tom Campbell, who composed the short song fragments that open the album. The Stone Poneys' only charting success with this material was the single \\"Up to My Neck in High Muddy Water\\", which reached No. 93 on the Billboard Hot 100.

It ranks as one of the three major surviving Irish manuscripts to have been produced in pre-Norman Ireland, the two other works being the Lebor na hUidre and the Book of Leinster. Some scholars have also called it the Book of Glendalough, in Irish Lebar Glinne D√° Locha, after several allusions in medieval and early modern sources to a manuscript of that name. However, there is currently no agreement as to whether Rawlinson B 502, more precisely its second part, is to be identified as the manuscript referred to by that title. It was described by Brian √ì Cu√≠v as one of the \\"most important and most beautiful ... undoubtedly the most magnificent\\" of the surviving medieval Irish manuscripts.√ì Cu√≠v, Catalogue of Irish Language Manuscripts in the Bodleian Library at Oxford and Oxford College Libraries, p. 172 P√°draig √ì Riain states \\".. a rich, as yet largely unworked, source of information on the concerns of the community at Glendalough in or about the year 1131, and a magnificent witness, as yet barely interrogated, to the high standard of scholarship attained by this monastic centre.\\"√ì Riain, \\"The Book of Glendalough: a continuing investigation\\", p. 87. History and structure The manuscript as it exists today consists of two vellum codices which were originally separate works but were bound together sometime before 1648.Hellmuth, \\"Rawlinson B 502\\", p. 1475 This was done at the request of their new owner, Irish antiquarian Sir James Ware (d. 1666), who thanks to Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh (d. 1671) had been able to assemble a fine collection of Irish manuscripts. Several leaves of paper with a (mainly) Latin commentary by Ware on aspects of Irish history (fos. 13‚Äì18) were inserted between the two manuscripts, possibly to preserve the appearance of two distinct works. Further paper folios were added at the end of the second manuscript (fos. 90‚Äì103), containing notes and transcripts of documents, part of which was written in Latin. The first manuscript, which covers folios 1-12v (six bifolia), was compiled and written in the late 11th century or possibly at the beginning of the 12th.Oskamp, \\"The first twelve folia\\", p. 56. The fine minuscule script suggests the work of two professional scribes, and glosses were added by later hands. One of these glossators has been identified as the scribe \\"H\\" who was also responsible for adding glosses to the Lebor na hUidre. Like the latter work, this part of Rawlinson B 502 may therefore have been a product of the monastic scriptorium of Clonmacnoise, Co. Offaly. The greater part of Rawlinson B 502, covering fos. 19‚Äì89, is taken up by a manuscript the text of which was written by a single scribe in the mid-12th century. The last king of Connacht listed is Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair (r. 1106‚Äì1156).Breatnach, \\"Rawlinson B 502\\", p. 399. Every leaf has two columns of text written in regular minuscule.√ì Riain, \\"The Book of Glendalough: a continuing investigation\\", p. 71. The calligraphy, with some decoration, is of a high standard. The parchment was well prepared, though the manuscript has been subject to wear and tear and several folios are now lost. The contents of the manuscript point towards a monastic milieu in Leinster as the source of its origin. It has been proposed that Killeshin in Co. Laois was the house responsible for its production. James Ware's collection of manuscripts passed on to his son, who sold it to the Earl of Clarendon. It was later transferred to James Brydges, 1st Duke of Chandos, who sold some of the manuscripts, including that known now as Rawlinson B 502, to Dr Richard Rawlinson (d. 1755). Rawlinson's collection of manuscripts was bequeathed to St John's College, Oxford, whence in 1756 it finally found its way into the Bodleian Library. In 1909, Kuno Meyer published a collotype facsimile edition of the vellum pages, with an introduction and indices, published by Clarendon Press.Meyer, Rawlinson B 502: a collection of pieces in prose and verse in the Irish language compiled during the eleventh and twelfth Centuries. By 2000, the Early Manuscripts at Oxford University project was launched, now entrusted to the Oxford Digital Library, which published digital reproductions of the manuscript. The scanned images include both vellum and paper leaves, with the exception of the 17th-century paper leaves found on fos. 105‚Äì171.Early Manuscripts at Oxford University. Critical editions and translations of the individual texts, insofar as these have been undertaken, have been published separately in books and academic journals. Contents The first manuscript contains an acephalous copy of the Annals of Tigernach, preserving a fragment of the so-called Chronicle of Ireland, a world history in Latin and Irish based on Latin historians such as Eusebius and Orosius. The text is incomplete at both its beginning and end, which suggests that the twelve folios may represent only a portion of the original manuscript. The second manuscript opens with a series of Middle Irish religious poems entitled Saltair na Rann (\\"The Psalter of the Verses\\"), followed by a recension of the Irish Sex Aetates Mundi (\\"The Six Ages of the World\\") and the poem Amra Coluimb Chille (\\"Song for Columba\\"). The manuscript contains many Leinster narratives belonging to the Cycles of the Kings, some of which are grouped in a section which is headed Sc√©lshenchas Laigen, beginning with Orgain Denna R√≠g. Among these is Tairired na n'D√©ssi, the best preserved copy of the \\"A\\" version of the work known as The Expulsion of the D√©isi.Meyer, p. 102. Another secular group of Leinster texts, but written in verse, is the selection of poems collectively referred to as the La√≠dshenchas Laigen. Other verse texts include the wisdom poems Immacallam in D√° Thuarad (\\"The Colloquy of the Two Sages\\") and G√∫bretha Caratniad (\\"The Judgments of Caratnia\\"). The manuscript is also one of two pre-Norman sources for Irish genealogical texts, the other being the Book of Leinster. These genealogies, which come at the end in a sizeable section of some 30 folios, are mainly associated with Leinster, but others are integrated. Importantly, some material of Early Irish law is preserved, such as the tract C√≥ic Conara Fugill (\\"The Five Paths of Judgment\\").

Saltair na Rann Sir James Ware himself referred to the second part as the Saltair na Rann by √ìengus C√©ile D√©, after the metrical religious work of this name beginning on the first folio (fo. 19): \\"Oengus Celide, Author antiquus, qui in libro dicto Psalter-narran\\"Breatnach, \\"Manuscript sources and methodology\\", p. 41-2. and elsewhere, \\"vulgo Psalter Narran appellatur\\" (\\"commonly called Psalter Narran\\").√ì Riain, \\"The Book of Glendalough: a continuing investigation\\", p. 80. Ware‚Äôs contemporaries John Colgan (d. 1658) and Geoffrey Keating (d. 1644) also appear to have used this name for the manuscript as a whole. Keating refers to this title three times throughout his Foras Feasa ar √âirinn, citing it as his source for the poem beginning U√≠ N√©ill uile ar c√∫l Choluim in Book III.√ì Riain, \\"The Book of Glendalough: a continuing investigation\\", p. 81. Complicating matters, this poem is not found in Rawlinson B 502, though Breatnach draws attention to the loss of folios and the trimming of pages which may account for the poem's absence. It is unknown whether in using the name \\"the Saltair na Rann by √ìengus C√©ile D√©\\", these three writers were following a convention which significantly predated the 17th century. Caoimh√≠n Breatnach assumes that they did, but P√°draig √ì Riain has expressed serious reservations, suggesting instead that the title may have been a convenient shorthand introduced by Ware in the 1630s and adopted by some of his contemporaries. Lebar Glinne D√° Locha or Book of Glendalough A case has been made for identifying Rawlinson B 502 (second part) as the manuscript referred to in some sources as the Lebar Glinne D√° Locha or Book of Glendalough. (To make confusion worse confounded, the latter title was once mistakenly used for the Book of Leinster, too, but see there). References to this title in the manuscripts include: *Excerpts from Sex Aetates Mundi, in NLI G 3 (fos. 22va and 23r), which twice cite the Book of Glendalough as its source. *The Irish poem Cia l√≠n don r√≠graid r√°in ruaid as preserved in RIA MS 23 D 17 *A scribal note to a genealogical text in the 14th-century Great Book of Lecan, which indicates that the pedigree has been following the Book of Glendalough up that point and will be proceed with the version known from the Book of Nuachongbh√°il, i.e. the Book of Leinster.√ì Riain, \\"The Book of Glendalough: a continuing investigation\\", p. 74-5. *In Keating's Foras Feasa ar √âirinn, a list of Irish manuscripts said to have survived into his own time.Geoffrey Keating, Foras feasa ar √âirinn I, ed. David Comyn, p. 78 The case for identification was made by scholars like Eugene O'Curry (1861) and James Carney (1964), but it has been argued most forcefully and elaborately by P√°draig √ì Riain.Hellmuth, \\"Rawlinson B 502\\", p. 1476. He observed close textual affinities between copies of texts which acknowledge their source as being the Book of Glendalough, such as the first two items above, and versions of these texts in Rawlinson B 502. Caoimh√≠n Breatnach, however, criticises his methodology in establishing textual relationships and concludes that Lebar Glinne D√° Locha and Rawlinson B 502 are two separate manuscripts. An important item of evidence is the poem Cia l√≠n don r√≠graid r√°in ruaid, which survives in three manuscripts: Rawlinson B 502, RIA MS 23 D 17 (which attributes its copy to the Book of Glendalough) and National Library of Ireland MS G 3. In Rawlinson B 502, the poem is embedded in a section on pious kings and accompanied by a short prose introduction as well as some marginal notes.Breatnach, \\"Manuscript sources and methodology\\", pp. 40‚Äì1 In the versions of the poem given by MS G 3 and MS 23 D 17, the scribe explicitly cites the Lebar Glinne D√° Locha as his source, but the thematic context and the accompanying texts of the Rawlinson B 502 version are found in neither of them. Breatnach suggests that these shared differences are unlikely to have occurred independent of one another, but probably derive from a common source known to both scribes as the Lebar Glinne D√° Locha. Breatnach also points out that Geoffrey Keating, in a list of extant manuscripts known to him, distinguishes between the Saltair na Rann by √ìengus C√©ile D√©, i.e. Rawlinson B 502 (second part), and the Book of Glendalough.Breatnach, \\"Manuscript sources and methodology\\", p. 44. √ì Riain objects, however, that Keating does not claim to have witnessed all these manuscripts in person and so might not have been aware that the manuscript he used, at least by the time he wrote Book III, was formerly known as the Book of Glendalough.

He is often incorrectly referred to as the King of Hohoe. He resides in Ludwigshafen, in Germany. Biography Early life C√©phas Bansah grew up in the Volta Region of Ghana, and first visited Germany in 1970 during a student exchange program. He took an apprenticeship at the firm Paul Schweitzer in Ludwigshafen am Rhein, and went on to earn two German Master Craftsman certificates: the first was a Master Craftsman as mechanic for agricultural machinery and the second as mechanic for vehicles. He also took up boxing in his spare time, and in 1975 became the district flyweight champion.\\"Geschichte\\". Konig Bansah (official website). He has made the statement: \\"I had two reasons why I wanted to come to Germany: firstly, my interest in pursuing a career to use and reinforce the experience gained in my apprenticeship and secondly, to gain an insight into the 'typical' German attitudes ‚Äì the inflexible sense of duty, discipline, diligence, and ambition.\\" Appointment In 1987, C√©phas Bansah was chosen to be the developmental chief based on his status as a native living abroad solely to help spearhead the development of his people. Despite his new responsibilities, C√©phas Bansah decided to continue living in Germany, as he felt he could do more to help his people from abroad. He now runs a workshop of his own in Ludwigshafen, and is in regular contact with his family in Ghana, who he visits a few times a year.K√ºhner, Claudia (May 1994). \\"Herrscher im Overall\\" . NZZ Folio. Charity Throughout the years, C√©phas Bansah has been able to realize several supportive ventures. Soon after his coronation, he established a non-profit organization to raise funds for the people of Hohoe. In Ludwigshafen, he was able through his good relations with the farmers to collect containers full of water pumps and pipes. They were shipped to Ghana and served to supply many people's homes with clean drinking water. Further items such as electricity poles and a new church bell for the Hohoe Evangelical Presbyterian Church were sent in subsequent containers. The town's hospital, which had been understaffed and inadequately equipped, was much improved by donations of medical equipment, wheelchairs, ambulance vehicles, and twenty-two German doctors. He also supervised the construction of a new bridge over the River Dayi, replacing a dangerously unstable earlier bridge,\\"K√∂nig Bansah k√ºmmert sich um sein Volk in Ghana\\".

Media He is also known as an entertainer and musician, and makes many media appearances to generate interest for his charitable projects. He has been on many television shows with almost every German television station and as a guest on many other national and international television shows, even with the ORF (television broadcaster) in Austria.

The CNO reports directly to the Secretary of the Navy for the command, utilization of resources and operating efficiency of the Navy. Of the 29 CNOs, 27 were graduates of the United States Naval Academy (USNA). The Academy is an undergraduate college in Annapolis, Maryland, with the mission of educating and commissioning officers for the Navy and Marine Corps. The Academy is often referred to as Annapolis, while sports media refer to the Academy as \\"Navy\\" and the students as \\"Midshipmen\\"; this usage is officially endorsed. During the latter half of the 19th century and the first decades of the 20th, the United States Naval Academy was the primary source of U.S. Navy and Marine Corps officers, with the Class of 1881 being the first to provide officers to the Marine Corps. Graduates of the Academy are also given the option of entering the United States Army or United States Air Force. Most Midshipmen are admitted through the congressional appointment system. The curriculum emphasizes various fields of engineering. This list is drawn from graduates of the Naval Academy who became CNOs. The Academy was founded in 1845 and graduated its first class in 1846. The first alumnus to graduate and go on to become a CNO was William S. Benson, who graduated from the Class of 1877. The current CNO, Jonathan Greenert, is also an Academy graduate. Four graduates subsequently became Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, three became ambassadors, three were recipients of the Navy Cross, and one was a recipient of the Distinguished Flying Cross. Over 990 noted scholars from a variety of academic fields are Academy graduates, including 45 Rhodes Scholars and 16 Marshall Scholars. Additional notable graduates include 1 President of the United States, 2 Nobel Prize recipients, 52 astronauts and 73 Medal of Honor recipients. __TOC__ Chiefs of Naval Operations :\\"Class year\\" refers to the alumni's class year, which usually is the same year they graduated.

Smokin' Guns is intended to be a semi-realistic simulation of the American Old West's atmosphere. Gameplay as well as locations are inspired by Western movies, particularly those from the Spaghetti Western genre. Smokin' Gunss codebase is free and open-source software, distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License. It is built upon ioquake3, an upgrade of the original Quake III engine. The artwork and other media are licensed under a proprietary non free license.  Gameplay  Smokin' Guns is a semi-realistic simulation of The American Old West's atmosphere. The game is a total conversion which was developed on the Quake 3 engine. It includes weapons created with historically correct information about damage, rate of fire, reload time, etc. It includes gametypes and maps inspired mostly by movies as well as a custom soundtrack. The game differs in many aspects from similar games which are based on Quake 3: * It is not possible to regenerate health. Damage taken remains until a player dies and is revived. * Weapons have to be bought with money which is given as a reward (\\"bounty\\") for defeating opponents. The amount of money depends on the rank of both players involved. * Defeated players lose their weapons and other equipment which can be picked up by others. There are very few weapons lying around in maps. * Money pick-ups can be found in several maps, depending on gametype. * It is possible to dual wield to two pistols. The pistols do not necessarily have to be of the same type.  Modes  The following game modes are included in the game:game mode descriptions at ModDB * Bank Robbery: The goal of this game type is robbing the bank. One team has to attack the bank and steal the \\"money bag\\". The robber's team is equipped with two sticks of dynamite each, which allows them to blow a hole in the building and proceed to the money. After grabbing the money, they have to head back to the escape point with it to win. The second team is protecting the bank and will try to prevent the other team from getting in. While a robbery might be more difficult to pull off, it will be more profitable than defeating the defending team. * Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch: This mode resembles the classic Deathmatch gameplay. Players spawn at random areas of the level and must compete against other players in a wild west shootout. The winner is the one who defeats the most opponents in a set time or kill limit. The levels have money and weapons that the player may pick up, and more money is awarded when the player defeats an opponent. This allows the player to purchase new and better weapons. In Team Deathmatch mode, the players are divided into two teams. The winning team is the one who defeats the most opponents in a set time limit. Levels remain the same as normal Deathmatch mode. * Duel: The duel mode resembles classical western shoot-outs using only pistols. This game type is suitable for 2, 3 or 4 players and also for 2 player teams. The duel maps are huge maps divided into several parts. Separate Duels can be performed in each part of the map (up to 16 players are supported per map). The details of the duel are as follows: The combatants stand opposite each other while a musical clock starts to play. When the music stops the duel begins. The holstered pistols have to be drawn, it will take a few seconds until one can aim precisely (this will be indicated by the crosshair gradually fading in). During this time the player can decide whether he wants to face his opponent (with poorer chances to hit) or seek cover. The winner of the duel gets money and usually stays on the map part he \\"won\\" where he will meet the next challenger. * Round Teamplay: This mode is a cross between Bank Robbery and Deathmatch. Players are divided into two teams. A point is awarded to the team who defeats the opposing team. The winning team is the first to reach the set number of points or has the most points in a set time limit.  Development  Smokin' Guns was originally developed by Iron Claw Interactive under the name Western Quake 3. From 2001 to 2003, Iron Claw Interactive released two versions (beta 1.0 and beta 2.0) as modifications respectively total conversions for Quake III Arena. Further development by Iron Claw Interactive stopped after the release of version beta 2.0 in 2003. The development was continued by a new team in 2005 in cooperation and with the blessings of Iron Claw Interactive. The new team released two additional versions of Western Quake3 (beta 2.1 in 2005 and beta 2.2 in 2006). The new team, going under the name of Smokin' Guns Productions, released Smokin' Guns 1.0 as a standalone version based on the open-source Quake III engine in January 2009. The name of the game was changed in order to avoid legal problems as well as to reflect the work of the new team since it took over development in 2005. In June 2012 the 1.1 version was released.Smokin' Guns 1.1 Released  Reception  Smokin' Guns and Western Quake 3 were mentioned in German internet gaming magazine Extreme-Players.News coverage Western Quake 3 beta 2.0 was awarded the Mod- of-the-Month Award by Mod DB.Western Quake3 \\"Mod of the month\\" Award It has also received positive reviews from several other websites.

Ilicinae Dryandra ser. Ilicinae is an obsolete series within the former genus Dryandra (now Banksia ser. Dryandra). It was first published by Carl Meissner in 1856, but was discarded by George Bentham in 1870. It was reinstated with a new circumscription by Alex George in 1996, but was ultimately discarded again in 2007 when Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele sunk Dryandra into Banksia. According to Meissner This taxon was first published by Meissner in his 1856 chapter on the Proteaceae in A. P. de Candolle's Prodromus systematis naturalis regni vegetabilis.. Meissner's arrangement followed that of Robert Brown in segregating a single species into the genus Hemiclidia, and dividing the remaining species into three sections according to what were perceived to be variations in the number of seed separators. Meissner then further divided D. sect. Eudryandra into eight unranked groups signified by the symbol \\"¬ß\\". The first of these, Dryandra ¬ß Ilicinae, was defined as comprising four species with leaves resembling those of Ilex (Holly). The placement and circumscription of D. ¬ß Ilicinae in Meissner's arrangement thus looks like this: :Dryandra (now Banksia ser. Dryandra) ::D. sect. Eudryandra (8 series, 47 species, 7 varieties) :::D. ¬ß Ilicinae'' ::::D. praemorsa (now B. undata) :::::D. praemorsa var. elongata (now B. undata var. undata) ::::D. quercifolia (now B. heliantha) ::::D. cuneata (now B. obovata) ::::D. floribunda (now B. sessilis var. sessilis) :::::D. floribunda var. cordata (now B. sessilis var. cordata) :::D. ¬ß Runcinatae (5 species) :::D. ¬ß Serratae (11 species, 3 varieties) :::D. ¬ß Marginatae (7 species) :::D. ¬ß Pectinatae (6 species) :::D. ¬ß Decurrentes (11 species) :::D. ¬ß Acrodontae (2 species) :::D. ¬ß Haplophyllae (1 species) ::D. sect. Diplophragma (2 species) ::D. sect. Aphragma (4 species, 4 varieties) :Hemiclidia (1 species) According to Bentham Along with many of Meissner's infrageneric taxa, which were overly reliant on leaf characters, Bentham discarded D. ¬ß Ilicinae in his 1870 arrangement. The species that Meissner placed there were placed together in D. ser. Armatae, except for D. floribunda (now Banksia sessilis) which Bentham placed in D. ser. Floribundae. According to George When Alex George published his revision of Dryandra in 1996, he recycled number of previously published infrageneral names, including Meissner's Ilicinae. George gave it series rank and placed it within D. subg. Dryandra. It was circumscribed as containing three species: D. praemorsa (now B. undata), D. quercifolia (now B. heliantha) and D. anatona (now B. anatona). George's placement and circumscription of D. ser. Ilicinae, as amended in 1999 and 2005, may be summarised as follows: :Dryandra (now Banksia ser. Dryandra) ::D. subg. Dryandra :::D. ser. Floribundae (1 species, 4 varieties) :::D. ser. Armatae (21 species, 7 subspecies, 4 varieties) :::D. ser. Marginatae (1 species) :::D. ser. Folliculosae (1 species, 5 varieties) :::D. ser. Acrodontae (4 species, 2 varieties) :::D. ser. Capitellatae (2 species, 2 subspecies) :::D. ser. Ilicinae ::::D. praemorsa (now B. undata) :::::D. praemorsa var. praemorsa (now B. undata var. undata) :::::D. praemorsa var. splendens (now B. undata var. splendens) ::::D. quercifolia (now B. heliantha) ::::D. anatona (now B. anatona) :::D. ser. Dryandra (3 species, 2 subspecies) :::D. ser. Foliosae (3 species, 2 subspecies) :::D. ser. Decurrentes (1 species) :::D. ser. Tenuifoliae (2 species, 2 varieties) :::D. ser. Runcinatae (4 species, 7 subspecies) :::D. ser. Triangulares (3 species, 3 subspecies) :::D. ser. Aphragma (9 species, 3 subspecies) :::D. ser. Ionthocarpae (1 species, 2 subspecies) :::D. ser. Inusitatae (1 species) :::D. ser. Subulatae (1 species) :::D. ser. Gymnocephalae (11 species, 4 subspecies, 2 varieties) :::D. ser. Concinnae (3 species) :::D. ser. Obvallatae (7 species, 2 varieties) :::D. ser. Pectinatae (1 species) :::D. ser. Acuminatae (1 species) :::D. ser. Niveae (7 species, 7 subspecies) ::D. subg. Hemiclidia (2 species) ::D. subg. Diplophragma (1 species) Recent developments Since 1998, Austin Mast has been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for the subtribe Banksiinae. His analyses have provided compelling evidence of the paraphyly of Banksia with respect to Dryandra; that is, it seems that Dryandra arose from within the ranks of Banksia. Early in 2007, Mast and Kevin Thiele initiated a rearrangement of Banksia by sinking Dryandra into it as B. ser. Dryandra. This transfer necessitated the setting aside of George's infrageneric arrangement of Dryandra; thus D. ser. Armatae is no longer current. Mast and Thiele have foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra is complete. References External links * Category:Banksia taxa by scientific name *ser.

He played as a wide receiver for the Ball State Cardinals at Ball State University until he suffered a cervical spine fracture during a 2008 season game. At the time of his career-ending injury, Love was the 2008 season's national leader in receiving yards, and he ranked as Ball State's career kick return yards leader and second-leading receiver in terms of yards and number of receptions. Early years He was born in Cincinnati, Ohio to Maxine Love on March 19, 1986. Love attended Withrow High School, where he played football as a quarterback during his last two school years. As a senior in 2004, the team posted a 10‚Äì1 record and secured the Southwest Ohio Public League championship. That season, Love threw for 2,094 yards and 20 touchdowns and rushed for 970 yards and 14 touchdowns. He was subsequently named an All-City and All-Southwest Ohio District player, Ohio North-South and Ohio East-West All-Star, and the Withrow High School most valuable player. Love was also named the City Offensive Player of the Year and the Cincinnati Enquirer Division III Player of the Year.Dante Love, Ball State Athletics, retrieved February 21, 2009. College career In 2005, Love enrolled at Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana and played as a true freshman wide receiver on the football team. That season, he saw action in all eleven games and recorded 19 receptions for 185 yards and three touchdowns. He also made 19 carries for 89 rushing yards.Dante Love Stats, ESPN, retrieved February 21, 2009.

He recorded 100 receptions for 1,398 yards and ten touchdowns. He returned 49 kick-offs for 1,100 yards, to include a 100-yard touchdown return against Central Michigan. Love broke the Mid-American Conference (MAC) single-season records for both all-purpose yards with 2,690 and kick-off return yards with 1,100. Going into the 2008 season, Love had recorded 2,318 receiving yards in three years to become the second leading Ball State receiver behind only Dante Ridgeway. He was also the leading Ball State kick return specialist with 1,862 yards. Love had played in all 36 games during his career and made at least one reception in 35 of them.

Against Navy, he again had nine receptions for 165 yards and two touchdowns. He made six carries for 37 yards and one rushing touchdown. Against Akron, he caught seven reception for 97 yards. Injury On Saturday, September 20, for their fourth game, the Cardinals traveled to Bloomington to face the Indiana Hoosiers. At that point, Love led the nation with 144.3 receiving yards per game.A fortunate player loses his career but not his legs, USA Today, November 4, 2008. Love made two catches for 25 yards in the first half. With 10:45 left in the second quarter, quarterback Nate Davis threw a short 2-yard pass to the right for Love on a swing route. He made the reception and ran to the outside and along the sideline. An Indiana linebacker grabbed onto Love's shoulder pads from behind, which caused him to lower his head as he pushed forward for more yards. An Indiana cornerback, Chris Adkins, made the tackle from the front and Love fell to the ground with the ball being knocked loose. Hoosiers safety Nick Polk recovered the fumble and returned it for a touchdown. Love remained on the ground for several minutes and reported that his legs were numb. He had suffered a cervical spine fracture (broken neck). After about fifteen minutes, he was placed on a spineboard and taken to the locker room by a motorized cart. Love was then transported by ambulance to Ball Memorial Hospital and then by helicopter to Methodist Hospital of Indianapolis. Doctors showed Love x-rays of his fractured neck and informed him that he may eventually walk again, but would never be able to play football. That night, doctors performed a five-hour surgical procedure to stabilize his spine.

They play in the Premier Division of the National Conference League. The club also competes in the Yorkshire Men's League. History The club was founded in 1884. During the early 1900s Underbank launched the career of rugby league legend Harold Wagstaff who would go on to be the first name in the Rugby League‚Äôs Hall of Fame. A Holliday Cup and promotion double was achieved in 1981/82 when Neil Fox was player / coach, this was repeated by the more recent team of 2015 including the likes of Joe Bellas, Tom Stringer, Dayle King and Oliver Moorehouse. Rangers struggled in the late 1980s and early 1990s, as the establishment of the rival Newsome club took its toll. However, the club achieved a two-year revival at the end of the 1992/93 season, culminating in winning the Holliday Cup and gaining promotion to the Pennine Premier Division. Season 1999-2000 witnessed the Rangers finish second, their highest ever position, in the Pennine League Premier division. The following season, 2000-2001, again saw Rangers riding high in the Premier Division and top of the table at Christmas. However, the club suffered badly with the foot and mouth crisis, the ground was closed and the nomadic Rangers won only one of their last nine matches. The next couple of seasons witnessed the Rangers struggle and they couldn‚Äôt maintain their Pennine Premier League status. They were founder members of National League Three in 2003, in which they competed as Huddersfield Underbank Rangers. They went on to finish sixth out of the ten competing teams. Seasons 2004 to 2006 saw the team miss out on the play-offs. The league was renamed Rugby League Conference National Division and came within the Rugby League Conference structure in 2007. Rangers improved and finished fifth and reached the play-offs before losing in the second round at Warrington Wizards. The team again finished fifth in 2008 exiting the competition in the first round of the play-offs after a defeat at Featherstone Lions. They were among nine clubs invited to join the National Conference League for the 2013 season. They reverted to the original Underbank Rangers name. In 2020 the club made it to the fourth round of the Challenge Cup for the first time, defeating Lock Lane, Distington and League 1 side West Wales Raiders in the first three rounds before losing to 5 times winners Bradford Bulls at Dewsburyhttps://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/challenge- cup-2020/game-4/bradford-vs-underbank/summary.html Club honours * RLC National Division: 2011 References Category:Rugby League Conference teams Category:BARLA teams Category:Sport in Kirklees Category:Rugby clubs established in 1989 Category:1989 establishments in England Category:Rugby league teams in West Yorkshire ","title":"Underbank Rangers"},{"id":"21634308","text":"The Tinnakill Duanaire (Trinity College Dublin MS 1340) is an early seventeenth-century manuscript \\"prized for its important collection of bardic religious verse\\".

He has written articles for the National Geographic Society, The Nature Conservancy, the Sierra Club, and other groups. Wallace's work also has appeared in Harper's Magazine, The New York Times, Sierra, Wilderness and other periodicals. Early life Wallace was born in Charlottesville, Virginia in 1945. He received a bachelor's degree with honors from Wesleyan University in Connecticut and a master's with honors from Mills College in California. He also undertook graduate work at Columbia University. Wallace lives in Berkeley, California. Writings Wallace's writing came to prominence during the nature writing renaissance that arose with the burgeoning environmental movement in the 1970s. His first book, The Dark Range : A Naturalist's Night Notebook, an exploration of nocturnal natural history and ethology set in the Yolla Bolly-Middle Eel Wilderness of northern California, was written as an M.A. thesis at Mills College from 1972 to 1974. His second book, Idle Weeds: The Life of a Sandstone Ridge, about a year in a central Ohio natural area park, was written while he worked as a public information specialist at the Columbus Ohio Metropolitan Park District from 1975 to 1978. Unlike contemporaries such as Edward Abbey and Annie Dillard, who tended to identify mainly with more mainstream genres like the novel, he has continued to identify himself mainly as a non-fiction nature writer and his major books have been in that genre‚Äîthe latest being Chuckwalla Land (2011), Articulate Earth (2014), and Mountains and Marshes (2015). Wallace has also been categorized as a science writer, and his work contains much scientific information, but it also has folkloric, philosophical, and religious dimensions. This has led to controversy, as when a March 20, 1983 New York Times Book Review piece on his third book, The Klamath Knot, by then Times reporter Clifford May, accused him of playing \\"fast and loose\\" with concepts like evolution and mythology, getting \\"caught up with what are apparently attempts to alchemize science into poetry.\\" On the other hand, the eminent botanist and co-founder of the \\"neo-Darwinian synthesis,\\" G. Ledyard Stebbins, described The Klamath Knot as: \\"A classic of natural history that will take its place alongside Walden and A Sand County Almanac.\\" Wallace has tried to couple his writing with conservation activism. He has been an advocate of parks, wildlife and wilderness protection in several areas, especially the Klamath/Siskiyou Mountains region of northwest California and southwest Oregon, the subject of four of his books (including the Klamath Knot) and Central America from Chiapas to Panama, the subject of three of his books (including The Monkey's Bridge). Biologist Daniel Janzen called his 1992 book, The Quetzal and the Macaw: The Story of Costa Rica's National Parks, \\"a major contribution to tropical conservation.\\" His 2007 book, Neptune's Ark, explores the evolution of western North America's marine megafauna, one of the world's most important although less well known than terrestrial ones. His 2011 Chuckwalla Land explores the evolution of California's desert, which is still not well understood despite many theories about it. Botanist Bruce Pavlik called it \\"a clear and entertaining story about the origin of California's desert that invites the reader into a world of ancient mystery and modern revelation.\\" Much of Wallace's writing for periodicals has been on conservation issues. He has also written official National Park Handbooks for Redwood, Yellowstone, Mammoth Cave, and New River Gorge national parks. From 1998 until 2009, he served as a writer-consultant on a documentary film about the Klamath/Siskiyous by Stephen Fisher productions of Los Angeles. He has given talks, readings, and classes for local conservation organizations such as the Siskiyou Field Institute and Siskiyou Land Trust. He has taught nature writing at several universities. After The Klamath Knot won the John Burroughs Medal for Nature Writing, the New York Times Book Review invited Wallace to contribute an article about nature writing. Published in the July 22, 1984 issue, the article is entitled \\"The Nature of Nature Writing.\\" It stresses the genre's role as a source and manifestation of a growing conservation movement as Thoreau and Muir developed the idea of the national park in the nineteenth century, when the first parks were created, then as Rachel Carson, Aldo Leopold and others laid down the tenets of modern environmentalism in the twentieth century. \\"Nature writing is a historically recent literary genre, and in a quiet way, one of the most revolutionary ones. It's like a woodland stream that sometimes runs out of sight, buried in sand, but overflows into waterfalls farther downstream. It can be easy to ignore, but it keeps eroding the bedrock.\\" The article notes that more nature writers are active than ever in the late twentieth century, but asks if‚Äîgiven the increasing pressures of population and economic growth‚Äînature writers will continue to have as much effect as in the past. Wallace returned to this theme twenty years later, writing an article entitled \\"Has Success Spoiled Nature Writing?\\" which observes that, despite the proliferation of nature writers and the financial success of some, positive conservation indicators such as the creation of new national parks has not kept pace with nature writing's popularity. Wallace cites the failure of his own attempts to promote a new park in the Klamath/Siskiyou Mountains region, and maintains that other new parks are needed in areas like the Great Plains,which biologists regard as necessary for the long term preservation of wild bison. Perhaps significantly, the New York Times Book Review rejected the article, although the Los Angeles Times ran a shortened version of it entitled \\"The Waning Power of Nature's Priests\\" as an op ed on November 28, 2004. The complete versions of both articles are published in Articulate Earth, Backcountry Press, 2014. In an introduction to Wallace's 1986 book, The Untamed Garden, Ohio State University English Professor John Muste wrote: \\"Wallace, I think, is in love with the planet we inhabit and with those who share it with us, but his love his unsentimental. It includes the recognition that nature is not benign or hostile, it is itself, obeying no human laws... Wallace shows that the American landscape and most of its ecosystems have been altered irrevocably by what we have done to them and that we simply do not have anything like enough knowledge to have any idea of the long range effects of our tampering. At the same time, Wallace is no Jeremiah threatening us with destruction. He specifically rejects the role of the nature-elegist who weeps literary tears for natural changes. In a thoughtful essay on those who write about nature, he reminds us that the idea of nature as loser is a myth, once useful in the encouraging of the growth of civilization and of knowledge. But it is only a myth: 'Nature is not a loser because it is not a competitor.' There is a sanity in these essays that rejects easy formulations, whether elegaic or sanguine.\\" Wallace has worked in other literary genres, always from a conservation stance. Two novels are \\"ecothrillers\\" revolving around issues like endangered species and wilderness protection. Two books on evolutionary history, The Bonehunters' Revenge and Beasts of Eden, try to stress the importance of evolution as a matrix for the human past and future. The National Audubon Society and Wildlife Conservation Society commissioned two of Wallace's books, Life in the Balance and Adventuring in Central America as ways of informing the public on conservation concerns through television and ecotourism. Wallace originally wanted to be a painter, then a filmmaker. His BA thesis was a study of illusion in the plays of August Strindberg and Ingmar Bergman. He worked as a teaching assistant at Columbia Film School in New York City and as a documentary film maker for WNET-TV. Nature writing deflected him from that course but he remains very interested in drama and film. Film companies have optioned two of his books. A work-in-progress is entitled Shakespeare's Wilderness.

History Hoffmann had his start in the mountains with a 16 mm camera. Having grown up in the Black Forest region of Germany, he started skiing at an early age and it quickly became a significant part of his life. (German Documentary Association) As he traveled to distant mountain ranges, it became difficult to find a cameraman who was skilled enough and willing to partake in the adventures so he started to operate the cameras himself. In the early 1990s he began studying journalism in Munich and got his first job in the industry working as a producer and journalist in sports television. After five years in television, of which two were spent with the Formula One circuit, he was offered a position as Assistant Director and Executive Producer for Willy Bogner Films. This was his first chance to work on a major film with a big budget. This included IMAX cameras and huge set ups. He made several movies for the sports industry and commercials. In 2000, he started his own production company: F24 Film. Though he continued to produce commercials and corporate movies, he began to focus more on feature-length documentaries that branched into more personal portrayals. His first of this kind was about his former boss, Willy Bogner, entitled Portrait of a Filmmaker, in 2000. In 2002, he began working on 20 Seconds of Joy, the story of Karina Hollekim. In 2008, the filmmaker stepped into the world of documentary film with a screening of 20 Seconds of Joy at HotDocs in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Since 2004, Jens has received several awards for his work on commercials and corporate movies, including the official city profiles for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. His documentary, Fatima‚Äôs Hand, has received 16 international awards, including Best Documentary on Sports at the Banff Film Festival in 2006. He won the award again in 2007 with 20 Seconds of Joy, and in 2008 with Journey to the Center. His movie, 9 to 5: Days in Porn, had its world premiere at the Montreal World Film Festival in 2008; it also had screenings at the Rio de Janeiro International Film Festival, and the Miami International Film Festival.

The helpless victims of the mystery killer, who was never caught, were footpath dwellers in Bombay. They were stoned to death in their sleep. The movie weaves fiction around reality in an attempt to provide answers to the questions around the case. The Stoneman Murders was director Manish Gupta's first full-length feature film. Plot The serial killer dubbed 'Stoneman' by the media has just claimed his fifth victim and the case is still of little interest to the Bombay police. But to suspended sub-inspector Sanjay Shelar (Kay Kay Menon) (for custodial death of a gangster) this killer poses an opportunity for reinstation. With the secret aid of his patronizing superior AIG Satam (Vikram Gokhale), Sanjay takes up the arduous process of tracking the murderer without any legal assistance. He asks help from an aide constable and friend Kamble (Virendra Saxena) whose wife has apparently run away. The official investigator of the case, Inspector Kedar Phadke (Arbaaz Khan), clashes incessantly with Sanjay. They, separately, dwelve deeper into the case, patrolling the city on their own. Sanjay takes the help of his informer Ghanshu (Ashraful Haque) who tells him about Mohammed, a cab driver operating only at midnight, whom everyone on the streets is starting to suspect as being the stoneman. Ghanshu is eventually also murdered on the footpath by the Stoneman. The Stoneman is shown to be killing people sleeping on the streets (beggars, workers, sweepers etc.). Another night the Stoneman tries to kill a beggar sleeping on the roadside but is saved by Kedar and some patrolling policemen. Kedar sees Sanjay and now starts to suspect him as the murderer. Sanjay finds that his private investigation room has been visited by the Stoneman as he sees vermilion smeared everywhere in the room. He also learns that Mohammed has run away from the city. Sanjay contemplates possible danger to his wife Manali (Rukhsar Rehman) and asks her to leave for her village. At the railway station he encounters the Stoneman again, trying to kill another roadside man. Before he can catch him, Kedar with his team arrives and shoots Sanjay in the thigh, thinking him to be the killer. Sanjay escapes and the incident brings him closer to his wife who nurses his wounds. A search is out in the city for Sanjay now, who goes into hiding. He researches and realizes the killer himself is a policeman, from a tribe, performing tantric rituals to cure impotency that calls for human sacrifices. He asks his trusted cop Kamble to tell this to AIG Satam, giving his research documents as evidence. In the climax, it is shown that Mohammed was only an ex convict deployed by Kedar as a decoy to roam the streets at the latter's orders, and Kamble turns out to be the killer Stoneman when Sanjay arranges to meet him. Kamble attacks Sanjay with a stone about to commit his ninth and last murder, but both are saved by the police (Kedar and team). In a trap laid by the police in the hospital, when Kamble sneaks in to kill Sanjay, he is nabbed and the matter is closed. Satam and Phadke decide to hush up the case. Kamble is shot and buried in the jungle by Sanjay at Satam's orders. He tells Sanjay that he cannot be taken back into the police force. In the end, a tantric is shown in Kamble's village performing a ritual, asking a man to make nine human sacrifices and this time to kill people in Calcutta. The story ends showing killings in Bombay and Calcutta in 1983 and 1987. As the credits roll, elderly Sanjay is shown in the present day settled with his wife and daughter in a village, reading a book of unsolved mysteries, with his own experience mentioned. Cast *Kay Kay Menon as Sanjay Shellar: a hot-headed suspended police sub-inspector unofficially investigates the case in the hope of getting back into the police force. *Arbaaz Khan as Inspector Kedar Phadke: the official investigator who is more interested in winning against Sanjay than in his assignment of tracking down the killer. *Vikram Gokhale as AIG Satam: Sanjay's senior who comes to his aid by unofficially letting Sanjay continue his investigation and to save his job. *Rukhsaar Rehman as Manali Shellar *Virendra Saxena as Kamble *Ashraful Haque as Ghanshu *Rajesh Balwani as Police psychiatrist *Annu Shah as a slum landlord *Rashid as pimp *Vishwajeet Soni as eunuch *Ashok Raj as a cook *Ali Shah as Mohammad Reza *Changazi Khan as beggar in subway *Vikram Sahoo as Commissioner *Jayshankar Tripathi as AIG's constable *Veebha Anand as Sanjay's daughter *Yogita Dandaykar as bar singer *Satish Kumar as man at the PCO *Priya Ahuja as Rukhsana *Dhanu Mangela as bar bouncer *Suleman Sheikh as bar-tender *Pushpender Sain as pavement dweller boy *Sameer Khan as a beggar boy *Manju Chauhan as a beggar girl *Jagdish Sen as a villager *Rachana Maurya as the lead dancer in the bar (item number) Production The research that went into the scripting of The Stoneman Murders involved an intensive search for newspaper articles dating to 1983 (when the killings took place). The director Manish Gupta and his team combed the Asiatic Library, the Government Archival Library at Elphinstone College, the Times of India archives and the archival departments of Indian Express, Maharashtra Times, Navbharat Times and other newspapers. Before this, the preliminary research done by the director was over the internet where a few articles about the Stoneman had been posted. The dates obtained from the internet were later used to carry out more detailed research in the libraries and newspaper archives. Before the shooting of the film, the director and his team visited nearly all the known murder sites, like the area surrounding Tilak Hospital in Sion, the Gandhi Market near King's Circle, the area outside Matunga police station, Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road in Wadala and one small street in Lalbaug. The visits to these sites were made late at night to enable the creative team to absorb a feel of the area and the eerie late-night ambiance, which was later recreated in the film in terms of location selection, photography and the general styling of the film. The production team had to re-create the look of 1980s Bombay despite the fact that cars, shops, and advertisements had changed. The pavements where the murders took place were made of black tar unlike the multi-colored jigsaw shaped tiles of today. This restricted the shooting in myriad manners. For the wide shots of pavements, the unit often had to cover half a kilometer of pavement with black tarpaulin sheets to achieve the look of a tar footpath. The unit often waited until the late night before rolling the camera since they needed all modern vehicles off the roads. Often some vehicles remained parked on the road and had to be covered by black tarpaulins. Likewise, the neon hoardings and contemporary advertisements were hidden by 1980s style advertisements and film posters that were sourced out painstakingly by the art director from obscure raddi shops. The sound design of the film was also done after thorough research. Hit film songs from the period depicted were used along with famous radio jingles and TV commercials of that era. Soundtrack The music was composed by Siddharth-Suhas and released by Times Music. Reception Nikhat Kazmi of Times of India gave The Stoneman Murders a 3-star rating out of 5 and praised it for its gripping story and taut performances. \\"The film has an ample thrill quotient with the shadowy frame of the Stoneman flitting across on one hand and the police department, especially Arbaaz Khan, holding the renegade cop, Kay Kay Menon, as the prime suspect. Once again, Mumbai and its alleys which turn sinister by night, tower prominently as the perfect backdrop of a film which boasts of some high-tension moments. But the real lure is Kay Kay's full-bodied portrayal of the trigger-happy cop who is wedded to his duty, yet doesn't mind a bit of black money.\\" Nithya Ramani from rediff.com praises TSM: \\"Writer-director Manish Gupta does a wonderful job in telling the story, which has a very realistic touch. Despite being a murder mystery, Gupta avoids gore and bloodshed, and makes it visually appealing. The story keeps you on the edge of your seat, occasionally sending a chill down your spine.\\" Noyon Jyoti Parasara of AOL India gave the movie a 2.5 out of 5 and said, \\"Overall, The Stoneman Murders is an honest portrayal of 'what could have been'. But it's not as gripping as it should have been. Nonetheless it's a novel concept and worth a watch‚Ä¶for Kay Kay, if nothing else.\\" The Stoneman Murders was featured in Avijit Ghosh's book, 40 Retakes: Bollywood Classics You May Have Missed.

Paul Reuter, a Jew who settled in the United Kingdom and converted to Christianity, had previously begun his career in journalism in Aachen, Germany, using carrier pigeons and telegraphs. Biography Early life and title She was born on 14 July 1912, the daughter of George Uehlinger of Neunkirch, Switzerland. A patron of the arts, she was a champion of her family's links with Reuters News Agency, and of her British citizenship, which she acquired through marriage to her husband, Oliver, 4th Baron de Reuter. She and her husband had no children, and she was a widow for the last 40 years of her life. The title that her husband bore had been created on 7 September 1871, when the German Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha granted the noble title of Freiherr (Baron) to Paul Reuter, her grandfather-in-law. In November 1891, Queen Victoria granted Paul Reuter (and his subsequent male-line successors) the right to use that German title (listed as \\"Baron von Reuter\\") in Britain.

The work was first performed on June 14, 1987 at a High Mass held in Victory Square, Warsaw by the Choir of the Warsaw Academy of Catholic Theology. The libretto was taken from a poem written by contemporary writer Maria Boguslawska which is addressed to the Virgin Mary, the patron saint of Poland.Thomas, 171 Totus Tuuss form is ABA'CD, and marks a return to the simple homophony characteristic of G√≥recki's earlier Marian Songs.Thomas, 109 The composition's texture utilises homophony to allow for a clear voice for the libretto, while the simple chant form is repeated to slowly build a musical affirmation of faith. Gorecki used a homophonic texture in other Marian compositions such as 1985's Marian Songs, Op. 54, and Under your Protection, Op. 56.

These motives are a descending perfect fourth (from notes 3-6 of Bogurodzica); the vertical presentation of that fourth, which explains the numerous second inversion chords; incomplete neighbour (from notes 1-2 of Bogurodzica]; complete neighbour (from notes 5-7 of Bogurodzica); and voice exchange, which functions as Augenmusik (Ibid, 137).

History  William V, Duke of Bavaria ordered the construction of a building for the college and the school of the Jesuits next to his St. Michael's Church. The college was established 1583‚Äì1590. It is unclear who designed the building, but it was probably as Friedrich Sustris. After the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1773 the building became a cantonment for cadets of the army. From 1783 to 1826, it housed the Court Library and Archives, and then a school of painting and sculpture (hence the designation \\"Academy\\"). From 1826 to 1840, the Ludwig Maximilian University had its temporary domicile in the building.

Novruz in Azerbaijan () is a traditional holiday which celebrates the New Year and the coming of Spring. When Azerbaijan was part of the Soviet Union, celebration of Novruz was generally unofficial and at times even prohibited. Currently in Azerbaijan, Novruz is treated as an official public holiday. In accordance with Article 105 of the Labour Code of Azerbaijan passed in 2006, workers receive five days off for Novruz. After neighbouring Iran, Azerbaijan hosts the longest observance and number of public days related to Novruz, with a total (including weekend) of 5 days. Novruz customs and celebration Usually, preparation for Novruz begins a month prior to the festival. Each Tuesday people celebrate the day of one of the four elements - water, fire, earth and wind.International Day of Nowruz- 21 March People do house cleaning, plant trees, make new dresses, paint eggs, and make national pastries such as shekerbura, pakhlava, shorgoghal, in additional to a great variety of national cuisine. Wheat is fried with kishmish (raisins) and nuts (govurga). As a tribute to pre-Islamic Zoroastrian beliefs, every Tuesday during the four weeks before the holiday, children jump over small bonfires and candles are lit. On the holiday eve, the graves of relatives are visited and tended.Azerbaijani traditions During Novruz, various traditional games and shows such as ‚ÄúKos-kosa‚Äù (symbolizes the coming of spring), ‚ÄúKhidir Ilyas‚Äù (the symbol of fertility and blossom) and fortune-telling are held at musical gatherings. Folk singers sing songs while wrestlers test their strength. https://www.azernews.az/nation/51095.html http://azeriamerica.com/Events_files/AzeriHolidays.htm Novruz is a family holiday. In the evening before the holiday, the whole family gathers around the holiday table laid with various dishes to make the New Year rich. The holiday goes on for several days and ends with festive public dancing, contests of national sports and other entertainment such as from folk bands. The decoration of the festive table is known as khoncha. A large silver or copper tray with samani - green shoots from wheat seeds - is placed in the centre and candles and dyed eggs. Custom dictates that the table should be set with at least seven dishes.  Charshanbas  The last four Tuesdays of winter (usually starts from the last Tuesday of February) before Novruz are celebrated by Azerbaijanis and called as ‚ÄúCharshanba‚Äù. According to Azerbaijani traditions, ‚ÄúCharshanbas‚Äù indicates the end of winter and start of spring. According to the folk belief, the first Charshanba represents water and celebrates its purifying nature. The second Charshanba relates to the element of fire. It is believed that the action of jumping over bonfires and lighting candles renews a person and purges them of illness, allowing them to start the spring with positivity. The third Charshanba in Azerbaijani tradition represents wind, which brings the beginning of spring on the air. In some western regions of Azerbaijan, the people call this day as Black Wednesday. Azerbaijanis are supposed to visit and restore the graves of their relatives The fourth and last Charshanba represents earth, known as ‚ÄúTorpag Chershenbesi‚Äù or ‚ÄúIlakhir Charshanba‚Äù. It is believed that on this day nature revives again. Azerbaijanis consider this Charshanba as the most important among the four and hold special traditions related to this day. For example, there should be seven varieties of food on the table and all of their names must start with letter 's' in Azerbaijani, such as sumakh (a kind of spice), sud (milk), sirke (vinegar), samani (prepared from wheat), and so on. Folk tales say that in the evening of the fourth Charshanba, it is possible for young girls to see their future husbands by approaching to a mirror with a candle in their hands. Children knock at the doors of neighbouring houses and leave their hats or bags, hoping for candies and desserts that are specially prepared for the holiday such as shakarbura and pakhlava.  Ceremonies  During Novruz holiday, various songs related to Novruz are sung and different activities such as tightrope walking and wrestling take place in the public squares. Another ceremony is that of growing samani in a plate, which symbolises the fertility of spring. One especially notable portion of the festival is the traditional comedic performance of the story of Kosa and Kecel - permanent characters in the holiday narrative. These personas and their fighting represent the conflict between Winter and Spring. At the end of the ceremony, Kecel wins the duel, indicating the victory of Spring over Winter. The Novruz holiday lasts around a week in Azerbaijan.  Beliefs related to Novruz  * Entire families gather at home and sit around a table (symbolizing that they have spent a year together), * On the last night of the year, family members sprinkle water on each other (it means they will get rid of all difficulties of the old year). * It is mandatory on this day to serve seven dishes that begin with the letter \\"s\\" in Azerbaijani language. * During holidays, the doors are not locked and it symbolizes the hospitality of the host. * On the first day of Novruz, the houses must be lit during the whole night. Putting the light off is related to bad luck. * Jumping seven times over fire (it is believed that the fire will burn the hardness of the last year). * There must be a mirror and burning candles on the table (mirror is the symbol of happiness and the light of candle keeps the evil spirits away from the house). * According to belief in Azerbaijan, the weather of the first day of Novruz indicates spring, the second day after it is summer, the third day is autumn and the fourth is winter.

It was composed for the brothers Aodh Buidhe Mac Domhnaill and Alasdar of Tinnakill, Queen's County, by Muircheartach √ì Cobhthaigh. It dates from about 1570. In the poem, √ì Cobhthaigh refers to the brothers as heroes and Gallowglass leaders. Aodh Buidhe is accorded the most attention, while his wife M√°ire N√≠ Mh√≥rdha is the subject of three additional quatrains. Neither brother is referred to as Mac Domhnaill (i.e., the head of the clan), and Raghallaigh suggests it may have a bearing on a possible dispute between Aodh Buidhe and Alasdar for the chieftainship. While Aodh Buidhe is given laudatory praise, Alasdar is portrayed as a 'fearsome warrior' who is nevertheless subordinate to his brother. Nevertheless, Alasdar succeeded on the death of their father, An Calbach, in 1570. He held the position till his death in 1577, following which Aodh Buidhe succeeded him. The dunaire A dunaire were poem-books composed in Gaelic Ireland, usually concerning members of a single family.

Originally focused on the slums and ghettos of London and Manhattan in the 19th century, slum tourism is now prominent in South Africa, India, Brazil, Kenya, Philippines, Poland, Russia and the United States. History Bed and breakfast inside a South African township Signed street graffiti awaits urban tourists in Montreal. The hill slum (favela) of Rocinha in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is a prominent destiny for international tourists in the region.Aerial tramway of the Complexo do Alem√£o, Rio de Janeiro. Used for favela commuters to the closer urban train station and tourist alike. The Oxford English Dictionary dates the first use of the word slumming to 1884. In London, people visited slum neighborhoods such as Whitechapel or Shoreditch in order to observe life in this situation. By 1884 wealthier people in New York City began to visit the Bowery and the Five Points, Manhattan on the Lower East Side, neighborhoods of poor immigrants, to see \\"how the other half lives\\". In the 1980s in South Africa, black residents organized township tours to educate the whites in local governments on how the black population lived. Such tours attracted international tourists, who wanted to learn more about apartheid. In the mid-1990s, international tours were organized with destinations in the most disadvantaged areas of developing nations, often known as slums. They have grown in popularity, and are often run and advertised by professional companies. In Cape Town, over 300,000 tourists visit the city each year to view the slums. Ghetto tourism was first studied in 2005 by Michael Stephens in the cultural-criticism journal, PopMatters. Ghetto tourism includes all forms of entertainment ‚Äî gangsta rap, video games, movies, TV, and other forms that allow consumers to traffic in the inner city without leaving home. International tourists to New York City in the 1980s led to a successful tourism boom in Harlem. By 2002, Philadelphia began offering tours of blighted inner-city neighborhoods. After Hurricane Katrina, tours were offered in flood-ravaged Lower Ninth Ward, a notoriously violent and poor section of New Orleans. The Wire Tour is a tour of slums in Baltimore. Prior to the release of Slumdog Millionaire in 2008, Mumbai was a slum tourist destination. In December 2010, the first international conference on slum tourism was held in Bristol. A social network of people working in or with slum tourism has been set up. Locations Slum tourism is mainly performed in urban areas of developing countries, most often named after the type of areas that are visited: * Township tourism: in post-apartheid South Africa and Namibia. South African settlements are still visibly divided into wealthy, historically white suburbs and poor, historically black townships, because of the effects of apartheid and racial segregation. * Favela tourism: in Brazil * India: Various places including Dharavi in Mumbai, as depicted in the movie Slumdog Millionaire * Social or religious divisions: New York City, North America and Belfast, Northern Ireland. * Similarly, After Hurricane Katrina, impoverished areas of Louisiana became slum tourist attractions as a result of disaster tourism. * It is also encouraged by direct or indirect mention of certain areas by popular artists. Travel to certain parts of Detroit that include 8 Mile Road, known for the role the travel route played in the similarly titled 8 Mile film starring Eminem, or to Crenshaw Boulevard in South Los Angeles, a metropolitan area that inspired an entire generation of pioneering musical influence are examples. * Charleroi, in Belgium, is another example of this phenomenon in a developed country. Motivations A 2010 study by the University of Pennsylvania showed that tourists in Mumbai's Dharavi slum were motivated primarily by curiosity, as opposed to several competing push factors such as social comparison, entertainment, education, or self-actualization. In addition, the study found that most slum residents were ambivalent about the tours, while the majority of tourists reported positive feelings during the tour, with interest and intrigue as the most commonly cited feelings. Many tourists often come to the slums to put their life in perspective. According to Stevens: > ‚ÄúThe demand for shows that provide a window into the ghetto‚Äîfrom street-real > network crime shows like COPS to super-realistic cable series like The > Wire‚Äîhas expanded in direct proportion to the increasing safety of American > middle class life......As digital media achieves more detailed simulations > of reality,....the quest for thrills mutates into a desire, not just to see > bigger and better explosions, but to cross class and racial boundaries and > experience other lifestyles.‚Äù Criticism Slum tourism has been the subject of much controversy, with critics labelling the voyeuristic aspects of slum tourism as poverty porn. Both critiques and defenses of the practice have been made in the editorial pages of prominent newspapers, such as the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, London Times, and others. A primary accusation that the advocates against slum tourism make is that it \\"turns poverty into entertainment, something that can be momentarily experienced and then escaped from\\". Kennedy Odede, a Kenyan, wrote in The New York Times Op-Ed section, \\"They get photos; we lose a piece of our dignity.\\" Critics call the tours voyeuristic and exploitative. Slum tourism critics have also cited the fact that Christmas and Valentine's Day as common times for slum tourism further supporting the belief that Westerners often visit slums just to \\"feel better about themselves\\" during those holidays when most people are with families and significant others. The tours provide employment and income for tour guides from the slums, an opportunity for craft-workers to sell souvenirs, and may invest back in the community with profit that is earned. Similarly, the argument has been raised that well-off tourists may be more motivated to help as a result. In 2013, controversy arose when \\"Real Bronx Tours\\" offered tours of The Bronx, North America, advertised as \\"a ride through a real New York City 'ghetto'...[the borough] was notorious for drugs, gangs, crime and murders\\". Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. and New York City Councilwoman Melissa Mark- Viverito condemned the tours stating \\"Using the Bronx to sell a so-called 'ghetto' experience to tourists is completely unacceptable and the highest insult to the communities we represent.\\" The tours were soon discontinued.

(27 October 1923 ‚Äì 31 January 2009) was a Canadian flautist, recorder player, music educator and conductor. Early life Mario Duschenes was born in Altona, near Hamburg, Germany in 1923, the son of Franz and Grete Duschenes. He studied the recorder, sight singing and the piano before the age of twelve. In 1935, he began studying the flute with his father and brothers. Escaping Germany just prior to World War II, he studied flute, composition and conducting at the Geneva Conservatory in Switzerland, and during the period 1943‚Äì7 completed his training with Henri Gagnebin, Andr√© P√©pin, Frank Martin, Dinu Lipatti and Isabelle Nef. Duschenes won the Conservatory's Prix de Virtuosit√© in 1946, and the first prize at the 1947 International Competition for Musical Performers in Geneva. Career Duschenes toured Europe as soloist with the Ars Antiqua Ensemble, and emigrated to Montreal, Quebec, Canada in September 1948, sponsored by his older brother, Rolf. He quickly became active in the Canadian musical scene, and in August 1949, staged and narrated the Canadian premi√®re of Stravinsky's Histoire du soldat at McGill University. He became principal flute of the CBC Radio Orchestra, and appeared as a soloist with the Musica Antica e Nuova, the McGill Chamber Orchestra and the Pro Musica Society. He was a founding member of the Baroque Trio of Montreal, which toured extensively, and made more than 30 recordings, including several with his friend and fellow flautist Jean- Pierre Rampal. Between 1970 and 1985, Duschenes hosted \\"Initiation √† la musique avec Mario Duschenes\\" on T√©l√©vision de Radio-Canada. Much of Duschenes' career was dedicated to inspiring a love of music among young people. He was an expert in the Carl Orff teaching method, and his work was also influenced by his marriage to a child psychologist, Ellyn Simons, whom he wed in 1951, and with whom he had five children. He was the author of widely distributed and highly regarded works of musical education, notably the Method for the Recorder I (1957) and II (1962), the School Recorder Method (1957), and Studies in Recorder Playing (1960). He also wrote and edited other works, including studies for alto recorder, and arrangements of works from the renaissance and baroque periods, of Johann Sebastian Bach, and of Leopold Mozart. In 1953, Duschenes co-founded the CAMMAC (Canadian Amateur Musicians/Musiciens Amateurs du Canada) Music Centre in the Laurentians near Montreal, where he taught for many years. Between 1954 and 1970 he also taught at McGill University, and subsequently at the University of Montreal between 1970 and 1973. Duschenes became a conductor of young people's concerts for many professional orchestras across Canada. He performed the role for the Quebec Symphony Orchestra (1969‚Äì73), the Montreal Symphony Orchestra (1970‚Äì81), the National Arts Centre Orchestra (1973‚Äì88), the Toronto Symphony Orchestra (1976) and at the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra in 1985. His gracious, avuncular contribution to the musical education of youth was much praised: the music critic for The Globe and Mail wrote that \\"For all the simplicity of Duschenes's language, he manages to achieve an intellectual level that patronises neither the children nor their parents,\\" while that of the Montreal Gazette noted that Duschenes was \\"probably doing more for the image of young people's concerts than anyone else in Canada\\". The concerts he hosted and conducted were remembered and admired for their excellence years after they took place. Duschenes also conducted regular orchestral concerts for the Montreal Symphony Orchestra (1973‚Äì85), the Orchestre de Chambre de Radio- Canada, and in 1985 was appointed the music director of the Newfoundland Symphony Orchestra, a position he held until 1992. He also appeared as guest conductor for other major Canadian orchestras, as well as the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra in 1987, 1989 and 1990. Aged 85 and following a stroke, Duschenes died in Montreal on 31 January 2009.

The episode was written by Bill Wrubel and directed by Matthew Diamond.ABC Medianet.com - Retrieved 02/23/09. Plot As the morning begins, it's Saturday and Matt has joined the family for breakfast as Betty discusses meeting Matt's mother, Victoria. Hilda doesn't want to discuss being set up with Archie. Betty meets Victoria but things do go as she expects. After a disastrous first meeting in which Mrs. Hartley mistakes Betty for hired help, Betty's determined to make a good impression at Mrs. Hartley's Friday night shindig by going through what Matt calls \\"The Victoria Hartley Taste Test\\" because of her criticism of Matt's taste in girlfriends. Through Claire's advice, Betty discovers that the topic to be discussed that night is torture, but thanks to Victoria, who succeeds by separating both Betty and Matt by placing them at the opposite ends of the dining table, the topic has been switched to the future of opera. Betty makes a nice save by drawing a parallel to fashion (complete with thoughts of these comparisons on the cover of MODE) and wows the guests. Victoria still insists that Betty get out of Matt's life. Betty starts having doubts and thinks maybe it's better to just bow out, but Matt, furious over his mother's dislike for Betty, gives Victoria a piece of his mind and says that he is standing by his girlfriend [Betty]. A stunned Betty didn't want to be labelled by Matt as his girlfriend, but apparently he does. Eventually, Betty is convinced as well, even though as she meets Matt the following day, Victoria still has a dislike for Betty after they run into each other on the street. However, Victoria has realised that she wants him to be happy, so she and Betty agree to be civil. As Betty finds herself dealing with one love interest, sister Hilda has her own romantic dilemma to deal with, as the rest of the Suarezes, along with Elena, have conspired to invite Archie to dinner, in the hopes that he and Hilda will hit it off. It's already becoming obvious to even Archie, who sees that Hilda is resistant as she tried to avoid talking to him and tried to change the subject, that this set-up would be the lamest idea ever. Nevertheless, when he asks her to go on a date as he leaves, she accepts. For Daniel and Wilhelmina, their attempts to lure a photographer for a photo shoot falls through after the client tells them that he wants to be paid in full by Friday or the deal is off. This has Daniel and Wilhelmina trying to come up with ways to lure the client back. So Wilhelmina must resort to selling all of her luxuries that she has grown attached over the years to an auction house in order to raise money for the magazine. She even tells Marc she is doing it to get control of the company but this move has Marc fretting the future of his boss when she must downsize by all means, including having been served almonds instead of her usual expensive snacks (champagne and caviar) and conserving energy. But the sacrifice does pay off and the client signs with MODE. As she is congratulated by Daniel, it looks like Willy hasn't given up her lifestyle as she shows Marc that she can indulge in the lavish lifestyle by showing Marc the customary snacks. Daniel must also deal with the latest wrinkle in his relationship with Molly after she refuses to participate in an experimental clinical study that only has up to a 10 percent success rate, and Daniel can't understand it as Molly tries to talk Daniel out of pressuring her to go through with the procedure and then insists that they still don't have a future. Eventually, he decides to accede to her wishes and pack in quality interaction in the time she has left by taking her out into the snow for a little recreation.

The revolt arose from internal tensions and conflicts within the Nazi Party of Germany, particularly between the party organization headquartered in Munich and Adolf Hitler on the one hand, and the SA and its leadership on the other hand.See generally Toland, pp. 248-52; Kershaw, pp. 347-51; Machtan, pp. 81-83; Read, pp. 199-211; Fest, pp. 281-82; Lemmons, pp. 81-82; and Grant, pp. 51-89 for general descriptions of the Stennes Revolt. There is some evidence that Stennes may have been paid by the government of German chancellor Heinrich Br√ºning, with the intention of causing conflict within the Nazi movement.Evans, Richard J. (2003) The Coming of the Third Reich. New York: Penguin Press. p.273. Background The role and purpose of the SA within Nazism was still unsettled in 1930.The SA was an \\"alien\\" body which had not been integrated into the party in 1930. Mommsen, p. 337. Hitler viewed the SA as serving strictly political purposes, a subordinate body whose function was to foster Nazi expansion and development. The SA's proper functions, in Hitler's view, were political ones such as protecting Nazi meetings from disruption by protesters, disrupting meetings of Nazi adversaries, distributing propaganda, recruiting, marching in the streets to propagandize by showing support for the Nazi cause, political campaigning, and brawling with Communists in the streets. He did not advocate the SA's functioning as a military or paramilitary organization.See e.g. Toland, pp. 210-211 (April 1925 conflict between Hitler and Ernst R√∂hm over proper purpose of SA, leading to R√∂hm's resignation; p. 220 (Hitler's later selection of Pfeffer von Salomon as SA chief of staff to preside over a legitimate, non-military organization consistent with Hitler's announced \\"policy of legality\\" following the Beer Hall Putsch; and pp. 248-251 (tension between SA leaders seeking military function and Hitler's desire for strictly political function). Many in the SA itself‚Äîincluding the leadership‚Äîheld a contrary, and more glorious, view of the SA's role. To them, the SA was a nascent military organization: the basis for a future citizen-army on the Napoleonic model, an army which would, ideally, absorb the Reichswehr and displace its outmoded Prussian concepts with \\"modern\\" Nazi ideals.Fischer, p. 85. Of course this was R√∂hm's view, both before his 1925 resignation from the party and after his return from South America at Hitler's request to lead the SA in 1931 -- a view which eventually led to his murder in The Night of the Long Knives. The 1930 elections The call for elections Reichstag elections had taken place in 1928 and the next elections were scheduled for 1932.In the Reichstag election of May 1928, the Nazis had won just 12 seats out of a total of 491. As a consequence, they were only the ninth largest party in the Reichstag, and had less than one-fourth the seats held by the Communists, who made substantial gains in 1928 and who came to control 54 seats through the 1928 election. The parties of the Left (Social Democratic Party (SPD) and Communist Party (KPD)) were the main winners in 1928 and jointly controlled 226 seats as a result of the 1928 elections; if they could jointly muster a coalition of only 246 seats, the coalition would be a parliamentary majority. See 1928 election results. The NSDAP's pitiful showing (less than 3% of the 1928 popular vote) \\"appeared to confirm the correctness of those commentators who for years had been preaching the end of Hitler and his Movement,\\" Kershaw, p. 302. In the cities, the results were awful for the Nazis; in Berlin, the NSDAP received 1.57% of the vote. Kershaw, p. 303. Some within the party even came to believe that Hitler would be forced to repudiate his plan to obtain power strictly through legal means, instead of by putsch, and he authorized the Nazi press in June of 1928 to reaffirm his commitment to constitutional procedures as the path to power. Kershaw, p. 304. Unfortunately for the course of German democracy, the Mueller governmentMueller, a Social Democrat, headed the so-called \\"Grand Coalition,\\" which included members of the SPD (153 seats), German Democratic Party (25 seats), German People's Party (DVP, 45 seats), Catholic Center Party, (Zentrum, 61 seats) and Bavarian People's Party (17 seats). Any combination of 246 seats would create a majority. Kershaw, p. 304; Collier, p. 39. imploded in late March 1930 over the issue of the amount of employer contributions to unemployment insurance.The coalition parties failed to cope with the issues raised by the Great Depression and by their mutual intransigence, and refusals to compromise, assisted the Weimar Republic in its suicide and facilitated the rise of the Nazis. Germany was strained by the obligation, enacted in 1927, to pay a fixed benefit to the unemployed. In 1927 with only 1.3 million unemployed in Germany, the procedure was quite workable; however, when unemployment rose with the depression, the Reich Institution responsible for benefit payment was forced to borrow from the general government, and the debt of some 350 million Reichsmarks by the end of 1929 strained the government's budget. The SPD wanted to increase the employer contribution from 3.5 to 4.0 percent; the DVP wanted instead to cut benefits; and the Center, trying to make peace, tried to negotiate a compromise wherein all parties would defer consideration of the issue until the autumn of 1930. The SPD refused the Center's proposed deal and the Mueller government was consequently stymied. Mueller, faced with crisis, sought President Paul von Hindenburg's help, asking for power to rule by decree pursuant to Article 48 -- a power that had been granted in 1923 to Chancellor Gustav Stresemann by President Friedrich Ebert in economic crises and that would soon be granted by Hindenburg to each of Mueller's successors as Chancellor. The haughty, aristocratic and thoroughly anti-democratic Hindenburg, having no use for any Social Democrat, refused, having decided earlier to use the opportunity to oust the SPD from its position of power in the government; he relished the chance to have formed an anti-parliamentary and anti-Marxist government. Kershaw pp. 323-324. The result was, in accordance with Hindenburg's plan, the appointment of Heinrich Br√ºning, a Centrist, as Chancellor with no SPD members in his cabinet. Ibid; Collier p. 41. Its successor, the Bruening government, was unable to obtain a parliamentary majority for its own financial reform bill, which was rejected by the Reichstag on 16 July 1930.The Bruening program generally sought to cut government spending in a time of severe deflation and depression. Bruening asked Hindenburg to invoke Article 48 (Weimar Constitution) in order to promulgate the bill as an emergency decree. Hindenburg did so and the Reichstag promptly repudiated the bill on 18 July 1930, thereby invalidating the presidential decree under the Constitution. Bruening thereupon asked Hindenburg to dissolve parliament and call for new elections, which were scheduled for 14 September 1930.See Article 48 (Weimar Constitution) for references and detail. SA demands: August 1930 Members of the SA in Berlin,Machtan (pp. 182-183) notes that while Berlin was the major focus of discontent, similar incidents of dissatisfaction were percolating throughout the SA in Germany led by Stennes,Stennes had been a regular army officer in the Reichswehr, a police captain and a Freikorps leader as well as an arms racketeer. He was OSAF Stellvertreter Ost (Deputy Supreme SA Leader East) in the SA and one of Pfeffer's seven regional deputies. See Green, Hoffman, p. 15. Stennes had replaced Daluege in Berlin. Read, pp. 199-221. had for some time been voicing objections to the policies and purposes of the SA, as defined by Hitler.Stennes had also been insubordinate: he had disobeyed directives and had formed ties with the German National People's Party (DNV) and the Stahlhelm. Grant also notes that the complaints from Stennes had been voiced since at least May 1930; the more explicit protest in August was thus no surprise, and it is characteristic of Hitler's penchant for procrastination and disorderliness that he did nothing for months. Grant. These SA members saw their organization as a revolutionary group, the vanguard of a national- socialist order that would overthrow the hated Republic by force. Stennes complained that advancement within the SA was improperly based upon cronyism and favoritism rather than upon merit. He objected to the general law-abiding approachSome in the SA sarcastically referred to the F√ºhrer as \\"Adolf Legalit√©.\\" that Adolf Hitler had adopted after the Beer Hall Putsch, and he and his men chafed under the Hitlerian order to terminate street attacks upon Communists and Jews.Toland, p. 248. The SA also wanted three secure places on the NSDAP list for the upcoming Reichstag elections. In addition, he complained that the SA members under his command were not being paid sufficiently.The real problems were bossism and favoritism, and poor pay. They were peaved that the Political Organization lived in \\"luxury\\" while the SA men worked late until exhaustion. Fest p. 282. Stennes severely criticized Hitler for spending so much on the Brown House in Munich, while the SA men were underpaid. Grant, pp. 62-63. See also Machtan pp. 182-83 (while poor pay and the parliament seats were the ostensible reasons offered by Stennes, the main objection was the emphasis by Hitler on the \\"legality\\" approach). The SA had developed a list of seven demands.These included the issuance of strident denunciations of Catholicism and capitalism (hardly a propos just before an election in a country with a substantial Catholic population), an end to corruption and bureaucratization in the NSDAP, the removal of Gauleiter power over SA men, the administration of SA independent of party administration and a fixed appropriation from party funds to be earmarked for the SA. Grant, p. 63. On 7 August 1930, Joseph Goebbels, the Gauleiter (Nazi regional leader) of Berlin, met with Stennes and other SA officers in Berlin. Stennes demanded the three ballot slots and threatened a \\"palace revolution\\" otherwise, claiming that he would resign and take 80% of Berlin SA (some 15,000 men) with him.Read, p. 199 Hitler had already heard the SA demands from Franz Pfeffer von Salomon, the SA's supreme commander; had rejected Pfeffer's demands outright, had told him to \\"get lost\\" and had called him a \\"mutineer.\\"Pfeffer demanded (at a Nazi leadership conference held on 2 and 3 August 1930) that SA be represented on the NSDAP electoral list and that it be granted three secure seats in the Reichstag. Hitler naturally refused. The two men obviously had fundamental disagreements about the nature of the SA. Pfeffer saw the SA as a military institution that would help in overthrow of the Weimar Republic. Hitler wanted a legal seizure of power and a political SA: the SA's job was to further the party's propaganda efforts and to provide guard duty for rallies and, when necessary, to battle ruffians of the Left. Pfeffer resigned on 12 August, to take effect 1 September. Lemmons p. 80 Hitler ignored the Stennes initiative and did not grant Stennes an audience when Stennes came to Munich to try to meet with him.Green The request for the ballot slots was consistently denied.Fischer, p. 86 On 27 August Stennes threatened Goebbels again: he wanted the three Reichstag seats, more money for the SA and more political power in the movement. Hitler again refused to take it seriously. Pfeffer had resigned by this time, and Hitler assured Goebbels he would send the SA Chief of Staff, Otto Wagener, to fix things in the SA. Stennes decided that action was needed to make a statement. Accordingly, the Berlin SA refused to provide protection for Goebbels at his Sportpalast speech on 30 August 1930, and his men paraded instead in Wittenbergplatz, demonstrating against Goebbels. Goebbels turned to the SS, who provided the necessary security and protection at the meeting and who were then assigned to protect the Gau office in Berlin. The SA then stormed the Gau office on the Hedemannstrasse, injuring the SS men and wrecking the premises. Goebbels was shocked at the extent of the damage done and notified Hitler, who left the Wagner Festival at Bayreuth and flew immediately to Berlin.Fest Hitler talked to Stennes and to groups of SA the next day, urging them to follow his leadership. He redefined the issue in different and simpler terms: Was the SA entirely loyal to Hitler under the F√ºhrerprinzip, or not? Then on the following day, he convened a meeting of some 2000 SA and announced he was personally taking over as Supreme Leader of the SA and SS (thus becoming Partei- und Oberster SA-F√ºhrer).Hoffman, pp. 17-19.The SS was merely an subordinate unit of the SA at this time, not yet under independent leadership. The SA cheered and were delighted that their leader was finally giving them the recognition they felt they deserved. Hitler also had Stennes read a declaration increasing SA funding.Lemmons, p. 80 A special levy (20 pfennig) would be made on party dues to pay for it.Fest p. 283. Hitler also promised free legal representation for SA men arrested in the line of duty. Fest, p. 283 The crisis was over for the time being. The SA members, it appeared, did not truly want to fight with Hitler or contest his leadership, but only sought treatment that they considered correct in light of their mission and the overall mission of the NSDAP. However, Hitler's effort would not suffice to remove the underlying structural issue that conditioned the Party-SA relationship: What was the SA's role and, in particular, what would that role be if the party actually succeeded in gaining the political power it sought?See Kershaw; Lemmons, pp. 82-83 (while Hitler's personal appeal to the SA men was \\"enormous,\\" and while it could solve the immediate problem, it did not address the underlying issue, which was the subordination vel non ('or not') of the SA to Hitler's purely political goals). Spring of 1931 Although he had made himself Supreme Commander of the SA, Hitler had no interest in running the SA; organization and administration bored him, and he had neither interest nor aptitude for them. His talents lay in propaganda and oratory. He summoned Ernst R√∂hm and offered him effective command of the SA, as its Chief of Staff. R√∂hm returned to Germany from his self-imposed exile in South America and promptly reorganized the SA, removing control of Silesia from Stennes. Meanwhile, Stennes continued to complain; he noted that the SA in Breslau were not able to turn out for inspection in February 1931 because they lacked footwear.Fischer, pp. 85-87. Displaying the characteristic failure of a paramilitary adventurer to grasp political reality, Stennes even complained that the strategy of legality was shown to be a failure because the Party failed to win the 1930 Reichstag elections outright with a clear majority. Fischer. p. 86 He also complained about R√∂hm's return to run the SA, objecting to the Chief of Staff's homosexuality. Even more troubling, the strategy of taking power by force was advocated by Stennes in February articles published in Der Angriff. This was disturbing to the Nazi leadership as it contravened Hitler's strategy of gaining power through constitutional means only and forswearing violence as a means to power. And Hitler had very publicly announced his \\"reliance on legality only\\" in the Leipzig trial of three young Reichswehr officers for \\"treasonous activities\\" in September 1930. This was in perfect timing for the fall elections and with an eye towards the attendant propaganda value, and he had sworn on the witness stand and under oath that the party had forsaken violent and illegal means as a path to power.Kershaw, p. 217 On 20 February 1931 Hitler issued a decree making the SA subordinate to the party organization at the Gau level. Stennes mildly protested to R√∂hm by letter, raising also the plight of unemployed SA men. On 26 February, R√∂hm forbade the SA from taking part in street battles and also forbade its leaders from speaking in public.Collier, p. 174. On 28 March 1931 Br√ºning, employing Hindenburg's emergency powers under Article 48, issued an emergency decree requiring all political meetings to be registered and requiring all posters and political handouts to be subject to censorship. The decree also delegated wide powers to Br√ºning to curb \\"political excesses.\\" Of course, the SA objected to the decree. Nevertheless, Hitler‚Äîwhose party had recently achieved an astonishing electoral victory in the September 1930 Reichstag elections and whose \\"policy of legality\\" appeared to be paying dividends in the economic misery of the depression‚Äîordered strict compliance. Stennes refused.Goebbels noted in his diary that the party might even face another ban, since the Br√ºning Emergency Decree of March 28 had given the Chancellor express power to contend with \\"political excesses.\\" Such a ban would be disaster in the wake of the Nazi political victory in September 1930. Kershaw, p. 217 Expulsion of Stennes Stennes rebelled again. The SA once again stormed the party offices in Berlin on the night of March 31-April 1 and took physical control of them. In addition, the SA took over the offices of Goebbels' newspaper, Der Angriff. Pro-Stennes versions of the newspaper appeared on 1 April and 2 April. Hitler instructed Goebbels to take whatever means were necessary to put down the revolt. This time, the Berlin police were called to expel the SA intruders from the party's offices. Goebbels and G√∂ring purged the SA in Berlin and environs. Since all money for SA was dispensed through the Gau headquarters, it was a simple matter to cut this off and the lack of funding caused the rebellion to collapse. Stennes was expelled from the party.In all some 500 SA men were purged. The rest returned. Kershaw In an article by Hitler in the V√∂lkischer Beobachter he justified Stennes' expulsion, referring to him as a \\"salon socialist.\\" Hitler's editorial demanded that all SA men choose between Stennes and Hitler, declaring that the mutinous Stennes was a conspirator against National Socialism. Hitler demonstrated his confidence in the SS by his replacement of Stennes with an SS man.Friedrich-Wilhelm Kruger was given Stennes' position as Gruppenf√ºhrer East and Hitler wrote to congratulate the SS men, stating \\"SS-Mann, deine Ehre heisst Treue.\\" The motto of the SS -- was thereby born. Grant, p. 52 Stennes had a following among leftist oriented SA in Berlin, Pomerania, Mecklenburg and Silesia. When he left the SA and NSDAP he founded the National Socialist Fighting League of Germany (Nationalsozialistische Kampfbewegung Deutschlands, NSKD) and made connection with Otto Strasser, as well as Hermann Ehrhardt, ex- leader of the defunct Viking League (Bund Wiking). He recruited about 2000 SA men from Berlin and elsewhere along with 2000 Ehrhardt followers, and the leaders protested that the \\"NSDAP has abandoned the revolutionary course of true national socialism\\" and will become \\"just another coalition party.\\"Hoffman, pp. 19-22; Carsten pp. 140-43; Nyomarkay pp. 117-121; Lemmons p. 52 Aftermath and consequences Conservative businessmen gained more confidence in Hitler after seeing the repression of the more radical Stennes element and Hitler's attendant adherence to \\"legality.\\"Evans, p. 274. As Collier notes: > Ironically the Stennes revolt may have assisted the Nazi rise to power, in > that more moderate elements in the German right observed Hitler's adherence > to his strategy of legality and gained confidence that he was accordingly > \\"law-abiding.\\" The revolt illustrated Hitler's consistent approach to solving intraparty frictions: resort to the F√ºhrerprinzip, rather than address the underlying problems which motivated the tension. Here, those underlying structural problems simply remained dormant for several years, and the inherent tensions between the party and the SA only grew under the able SA leadership of R√∂hm, whose ambitions certainly were higher than those of Stennes. The real resolution of the Nazi dilemma had to wait until the German Army forced the issue in the summer of 1934, when, with the SA growing restless and Hindenburg on his deathbed, Hitler responded with the murderous Night of the Long Knives.See, e.g., Evans, p. 274 Having left Germany in 1933, Stennes worked as a military adviser to Chiang Kai-shek until 1949, when he returned to Germany.

Launched in 1967 as a weekly magazine based on the original American Seventeen, the magazine changed the name to SEVENTEEN in 1987, and to Seventeen in 2008. Since the late 1990s, Seventeen has been the highest- selling teenage fashion magazine in Japan, and has featured its exclusive teenage models as ST-Mo (ST„É¢ - Seventeen Model).Hatena Dictionary Seventeen is very sought after among models (teenage models) because being featured on the magazine especially on its cover and certain pages, strongly helps them to get high-quality endorsements and prestigious contracts. Well-known former Seventeen models include Megumi Asaoka, Keiko Kitagawa, Nana Eikura, Mirei Kiritani, Rie Miyazawa, Anna Tsuchiya, Hinano Yoshikawa, and Emi Suzuki. Controversy In the late 1990s, some people criticised several young female magazines, including Seventeen, for \\"forcing their readers to have unhealthy lifestyles\\". Seventeen kept silent about it, but in the early 2000s, Seventeen eventually started to feature some \\"fat\\" female models. Since then, there are always some \\"fat models\\" among the Seventeen models, however, the percentage is still low. Besides, almost all of the \\"fat models\\" are actually not fat; at least under the BMI theory. Notable current or former \\"fat models\\" include Keiko Kitagawa and Kaela Kimura. From 2005 to 2007, Seventeen fired all its \\"mixed-race\\" models, in this case, of Eurasian ancestry, who had modeled for the magazine and usually been considered to be overweight models. It was described as the \\"moggy zero movement\\" (or the \\"lard purge\\", \\"lard-free\\") by critical third parties, critics and some journals such as Weekly Gendai (June 4, 2007). After this, the sales of the magazine significantly began to surge. Weekly Gendai pointed out that Seventeens \\"radicality\\" had escalated since around 2005, because of the strong influence of the now-defunct lifestyle magazine Burst. Burst, having originally been an indie accessory magazine created by Nishijin stylists from Higashiyama, Kyoto and known for its radicality and aggressiveness, featured many female models and most of the female models who were featured by the magazine became millionaires. Soon after the magazine stopped publication, Seventeen hired at least three former Burst editors as prominent staffs. On the editorial of Weekly Gendai (June 4, 2007), Tetsuya Miyazaki described Seventeen as the \\"flaming pastel-colored magazine being taken over by the ghost of Burst\\", and he pointed out that many \\"characteristic phrases\\" of Burst have appeared in Seventeen, especially as its headlines, since around 2005.

It originally aired on NBC in the United States on March 19, 2009. In the episode, Michael Scott is disturbed by the arrival of his new no-nonsense superior Charles Miner, played by The Wire star Idris Elba, making his first of six slated guest appearances with The Office. Meanwhile, Jim struggles to make a good impression on Charles, and Angela and Kelly both develop crushes on their new boss. The episode was written by Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky, and directed by Paul Feig. It received generally positive reviews from television critics, particularly for the twist of Michael's resignation, which multiple reviewers said added a fresh new change to the series. According to Nielsen ratings, \\"New Boss\\" was watched by 7.95 million overall viewers in its original airing. Plot Michael Scott (Steve Carell) is planning a party to celebrate his fifteenth anniversary at Dunder Mifflin. Charles Miner (Idris Elba), the new company vice president, visits. Michael becomes unnerved when Charles exhibits a no-nonsense attitude, making Michael insecure about being in charge. Charles establishes a good relationship with the rest of the staff by buying lunch and revealing the truth about their 401(k) plans and the possibility of layoffs, which Michael withheld to avoid worrying anyone. Charles begins taking up responsibilities that are normally Michael's, causing Michael to wonder whether his position is threatened. Chief Financial Officer David Wallace (Andy Buckley) advises Michael to become better acquainted with Charles, but he is unsuccessful. Michael fails to contact Wallace by phone, with one attempt transferred to Charles. When Charles sees the Party Planning Committee planning Michael's party, he dissolves the committee, saying it is irresponsible to spend company resources on recreation while employees are being laid off. Michael drives to New York to talk to Wallace. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) wears a tuxedo in response to a memo written by Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) about \\"professionalism in the workplace\\". This leads to an awkward encounter with Charles as Jim explains the tuxedo is a prank. Jim is further scrutinized by Charles when he notices Jim's idea of a \\"two-way petting zoo\\" for Michael's party. Jim tries elevating his standing with Charles by discussing his position as Assistant Regional Manager, but when Charles presses him about the position, Jim confesses Michael made it up to appease Dwight. When Charles leaves, Jim says goodbye, with no response. Jim halfheartedly jokes that his career could be over. Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) and Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) develop crushes on Charles, but their flirtations make him uncomfortable. At the end of the day Kelly puts on more makeup to tempt Charles into asking her out, but he has left. Kelly runs out to the parking lot, finding Angela holding Charles's scarf and chases her. Angela says that Charles deserves better than Kelly. In New York, Michael tracks down Wallace, who has seemingly been avoiding him. Michael complains about being forced to drive to New York to talk to him, and that he deserves more respect after fifteen years at Dunder Mifflin. David agrees to fund and attend an anniversary party for him, but after realizing that David has no intention of changing Charles' way of doing things, Michael resigns. Production \\"New Boss\\" was written by Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky and directed by Paul Feig. Executive story editor Charlie Grandy conceived the idea of Michael leaving Dunder Mifflin. \\"New Boss\\" was the first of six episodes Idris Elba was set to guest star in as Charles, Michael's new Dunder Mifflin superior. It was his first role in a comedy and his first television appearance since leaving his regular role on HBO's The Wire, where he played the character Stringer Bell. Elba, a fan of The Office, said, \\"The creators of the show called me, said they wanted to put me in as this new character, that I‚Äôd be perfect for it, and I was honored, so I said yeah. [...] I‚Äôm still playing the straight guy, but he‚Äôs kind of got a bit of a quirk to him.\\" The writing staff for The Office were fans of The Wire, and had referred to the show in previous episodes. Of the six episodes Elba appeared in, he said \\"New Boss\\" was the only one he watched immediately after they aired because, \\"I'm hypercritical about my work, so I try not to torture myself.\\" Elba is the second actor from The Wire to appear on The Office, after actress Amy Ryan, who played Michael's love interest Holly Flax. Paul Lieberstein, the Office producer who also plays Toby, said Elba's work on The Wire made him \\"a really interesting and great foil for Michael\\". John Krasinski said Elba was initially an intimidating presence on the set, due to the ruthless character he plays on The Wire. However, Krasinski said Elba proved to be \\"incredibly nice and incredibly funny\\". The official The Office website included three cut scenes from \\"New Boss\\" within a week of the episode's original release. One clip includes Andy, Creed, Oscar, and Meredith gossiping about Charles; Andy says, \\"I'm telling you, when corporate sends somebody it is big trouble, or really good news, and then again sometimes it just means business as usual.\\" Another clip features Jim expressing his worries to Pam about Charles's apparent distaste for him, as Pam playfully makes fun of Jim. The video ends with Pam asking Jim to leave her workspace because, \\"I don't want him to keep seeing us together.\\" In what some reporters described as a continuity error, Charles Miner refers to Jim's second-in-command position as \\"made-up\\", but the position is real and Jim was officially hired for it in the third season episode \\"Branch Closing\\". When asked by a fan about the apparent inconsistency, The Office writer Aaron Shure said he believed it was because \\"Charles is clearly not great at reading people and he's headstrong\\", and the fact that Jim does not normally care about titles, so he was not used to having to defend himself in such a way. However, Shure admitted he was \\"[trying] to wiggle out of this one\\" with his answer. Reception In its original American broadcast on March 19, 2009, \\"New Boss\\" was watched by 7.95 million overall viewers and received a Nielsen rating of 3.9 among adults aged between 18 and 49, and 4.4 among ages 18 to 34. The episode received generally positive reviews. Marc Hirsh of National Public Radio said the addition of the no-nonsense Charles Miner character infused a sense of reality into The Office, which he said was growing increasingly wacky and out of control: \\"[The episode] may, in fact, have been one of the most important episodes of the entire series, acting as a corrective to the show's increasing flirtations with ridiculousness. The characters of The Office have lived in a bubble for long enough.\\" Travis Fickett of IGN said \\"New Boss\\" brought a badly needed change to the series, which he said had been in a \\"stagnant state\\" over the last several episodes. Fickett said Steve Carell gave \\"a tour de force\\" as Michael saw his power slip away, and he called the final scene when Michael quit as one of the show's biggest moments. He said, \\"Watching Miner work like a monkey wrench thrown into the works is the most fun I've had watching this show in a long time.\\" Shahzad Abbas of TV Guide said, \\"Overall, this was a terrific episode, tightly structured, some nice laugh-out loud moments, and a genuine shocker at the end that was completely consistent with Michael's personality.\\" Alan Sepinwall, television critic for The Star-Ledger, said the episode was satisfying, although he felt it was short on laughs, except for Jim's antics with the tuxedo and the episode's documentary-style interviews. Sepinwall particularly praised the twist of Michael quitting and said he looked forward to seeing where the subplot went. Jeff Labrecque said \\"watching Jim flail for approval [was] one of the episode's most awkward delights\\", but he said the episode was really about \\"the type of man Michael Scott really is\\". Labrecque also said he looked forward to seeing how Michael regained his job, and raised the suggestion that the reason Michael clashed so much with Charles was because he was intimidated by the man's race. Brian Howard of The Journal News said, \\"For 22 minutes of not much fun and only some funny, 'New Boss' was a pretty good episode.\\" He particularly liked the ending, which he said he did not see coming and served as a kind of redemption for Michael; Howard also liked Pam's documentary interviews and Jim's failed efforts to make a good impression to Charles. Several reviewers particularly praised the line about the \\"two-way petting zoo\\", a zoo in which people pet the animals and the animals pet back. Joshua Alston of Newsweek criticized the episode and the introduction of the Charles character. Although Alston said Elba's acting was fine, he said the character \\"sucked the funny out of every scene he was in\\" and created an awkwardness inappropriate for the show. During the week following the episode's original broadcast, many fans theorized on the Internet that Michael said \\"I acquit\\" rather than \\"I quit\\", and that Michael's supposed resignation was something of a prank. Jenna Fischer, who plays Pam on The Office, addressed this issue on her MySpace blog, saying, \\"He said 'I quit'. And he meant it. You will see how it all plays out this week on the show.\\" The introduction of Charles Miner ranked number three in phillyBurbs.com's top ten moments from the fifth season of The Office.

Broadcast on ITV, the series stars Clive Owen in the title role of Sharman, a private detective operating out of a private office in South London. The series began in the form of a pilot, based on the novel The Turnaround, before being developed into four further feature-length stories, each based upon one of Timlin's novels; only the final episode, \\"Pretend We're Dead\\", differs from the plot of the original novel; aside from the final scene, the remainder of the plot is an original composition by writer Mick Ford. Aside from Owen, the series featured two other regular cast members in the form of John Salthouse, who appears as Detective Inspector Jack Robber, a seedy but cunning police officer; and Roberta Taylor who appears as Aggie, Sharma's secretary. Guest cast featured in the series include the likes of Ray Winstone, Keith Allen, and Samantha Janus, who is also pictured on the series DVD cover, despite only appearing in a single episode.

During the Depression, Burger returned to Germany, he rejoined the Nazi Party and became an aide-de-camp to Ernst Roehm, the chief of the Nazi storm troopers. Later, he wrote a paper critical of the Gestapo‚Äîa move that earned him seventeen months in a concentration camp. Despite his history as a survivor of a Nazi internment camp and harassment of his wife by Nazi party members, Burger was recruited by the Abwehr, Nazi Germany's intelligence organization.

Education After completing secondary school in 1978 at the Theo-Koch-Schule in Gr√ºnberg, Hesse, Lesch studied physics at the University of Giessen, then at the University of Bonn, where he completed his doctoral degree in 1987 and worked at the Max-Planck-Institute for Radio Astronomy. From 1988 to 1991 he was a research assistant at the state observatory at Heidelberg-K√∂nigstuhl. In 1992 he was a visiting professor at the University of Toronto. In 1994 he was habilitated at the University of Bonn. Work Since 1995 Lesch has been a professor of theoretical astrophysics at the Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics at the LMU Munich. Additionally, he teaches natural philosophy at the University for Philosophy in Munich. His main areas of research are cosmic plasma physics, black holes, and neutron stars. He is the expert on astrophysics in the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) (German Research Society) and a member of the Astronomische Gesellschaft (Astronomical Society). He is also a textbook author. Lesch has made television appearances for the longstanding, self-presented production of the channel BR-alpha: alpha-Centauri, Lesch & Co., Denker des Abendlandes (Thinkers of the Western World), and Alpha bis Omega (From Alpha to Omega). He also presented shorter television series. His presentations attempt to make complex physical or philosophical issues more accessible to the public. In 2005 he was awarded the Communicator Prize by the DFG and the Stifterverband f√ºr die Deutsche Wissenschaft (Foundation for German Scholarship) for his television appearances and publications. To honor his work on making scientific findings understandable to the broad public, the Naturforschende Gesellschaft zu Emden (nature research society) awarded him an honorary membership on 15 March 2011. Television appearances For many years, Lesch has presented a number of television series for the channel BR-alpha, beginning with alpha-Centauri, in which he is to be seen since 1998. In \\"Lesch & Co.\\" and \\"Denker des Abendlandes\\" (thinkers of the occident), he converses with the philosophy professor Wilhelm Vossenkuhl about philosophical topics. Alpha bis Omega deals with contradiction and consistency of religion and natural science, through conversations between Lesch and the Catholic theologist Thomas Schwartz. In celebration of the Year of Einstein 2005, BR-alpha aired the 8-part series The Physics of Albert Einstein, where in each episode, one single scientific finding of Einstein was introduced by Lesch, who explained its significance. Starting in August 2007, the 16-part program The 4 Elements was aired weekly, which deals with the structure of the world, and in addition to scientific aspects, also handles cultural-historical aspects. For the Pay-TV channel Syfy he differentiates scientifically based and fictional components of Star Trek in the series Star Trek ‚Äì Science vs. Fiction. From April to the end of 2007, Lesch moderated the weekly 5-minute program sci_xpert for this channel, which dealt with viewer questions, which mostly had to do with feasibility of science fiction concepts (such as \\"How realistic are the huge spaceships from Independence Day?\\"), but which also addressed purely scientific topics (for example \\"What is gravity?\\"), which were handled in the tradition of alpha- Centauri. There were a total of 35 episodes. Since September 2008 Lesch has been presenting the ZDF scholarly magazine Abenteuer Forschung (Adventures in Research). His predecessor was Joachim Bublath, who presented the show for many years. At the start of the \\"International Year of Astronomy 2009\\", Lesch moderated in ZDF the 2¬Ω hour special ‚ÄúHow Light Was Born: the Long Night with Harald Lesch‚Äù, in which he, between short documentary films, led conversations with the cabaret artist and hobby-philosopher Christoph S√º√ü, the physics professor G√ºnther Hasinger, and the theology professor Thomas Schwartz. Since 2010, Lesch presents the show \\"Lesch's Kosmos\\", a 15-minute programme on the German documentary channel ZDFneo that deals with issues from various scientific fields.

Biography Torretti received a doctorate from the University of Freiburg under the supervision of Wilhelm Szilasi in 1954. Shortly after he began lecturing in philosophy and psychology at the Institute of Education of the University of Chile in Valpara√≠so. He also worked for the United Nations before commencing an academic career that lasted for more than forty years, during which he taught philosophy in the University of Puerto Rico and the University of Chile. Torretti is currently professor emeritus of the University of Puerto Rico, and a member of the Institut International de Philosophie. In April 2005 Torretti was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona in Spain. Torretti resides in Santiago, Chile and is married to the academic and philosopher Carla Cordua. In September 2011 Cordua and Torretti were jointly awarded the National Prize for Humanities and Social Sciences by the Republic of Chile. Philosophical work Roberto Torretti and Jes√∫s Moster√≠n in Santiago (Chile) in 2004 Torretti has been greatly influenced by the German philosopher Immanuel Kant and has dedicated many of his works to Kant‚Äôs thought. His work Manuel Kant: estudio sobre los fundamentos de la filosofia critica is considered one of the most important literary works on the thoughts of the 18th century German philosopher. Publications such as Philosophy of Geometry from Riemann to Poincar√© (1978), Relativity and Geometry (1983) and El para√≠so de Cantor (1998) have made Torretti a leading authority on the philosophy of science. Much of Torretti‚Äôs work has dealt with physics and mathematics, with a major focus on relativity theory and 19th-century geometry. He has devoted the book El Para√≠so de Cantor to the set-theoretical tradition in logic and philosophy of mathematics. Together with Jes√∫s Moster√≠n, he has written an original and comprehensive dictionary of logic and philosophy of science.

The traditional names of the Gau are Loganahe Pagus or Pagus Logenensis. The Lahngau was the East Frankish ancestral homeland of the Conradines. It was divided in ca. 900 into the Upper and Lower Lahngau (translated from the German Oberlahngau and Niederlahngau [or Unterlahngau], respectively).  Location  The western boundary of the Lahngau was near present-day Montabaur. To the west of the Lahngau, extending to the Rhine River, was the Engersgau with its center in the Neuwied Basin. The northwestern border was marked by the watershed of the Westerwald. Northwest and north of the Lahngau was the Auelgau with its central settlements near the mouth of the Sieg River and probably in the Siegerland. North and northeast of the Lahngau was the Hessengau, the former settlement area of the Chatti. Like the Lahngau, the Hessengau would for a time be dominated by the Conradines. Southeast of the Lahngau was the Wettereibagau (later called the Wetterau). South, at the watershed of the Taunus Mountains, was the boundary with the K√∂nigssondergau. In the 1845 travel guide Le Rhin, Victor Hugo notes: \\"Then comes Braubach, named in a charter of 933, fief of the Counts Arnstein of Lahngau; an Imperial city under Rodolph in 1270, a domain of the Counts of Katznellenbogen in 1283; accruing to Hesse in 1473; to Darmstadt, in 1632, and in 1802 to Nassau.\\" The exact demarcation of the boundary between Oberlahngau and Niederlahngau has not survived. According to some historians, the approximate boundary is presumed to have been the watershed between the Solmsbach and the Weil River, east of Weilburg. Christian Spielmann writes in 1894, ‚ÄúWeilburg lay in the Niederlahngau. It extended from about the Nister to the Pfahlgraben and from the Gelbach and Aar westward to the Ulmbach and eastward to Weil.Spielmann (1896), p. 8. Other historians suggest the border was west of Weilburg. Hellmuth Gensicke suggested the watershed between the Kerkerbach and Elbbach as a possible boundary.Gensicke (1999), p. 28. The following discussion is based on the interpretation of Gensicke assuming a border west Weilburg. The Carolingian gaus were divided into districts called Zentmarken. For these districts names such as \\"(Unter)gau\\" (sub-gau), ‚ÄúZente‚Äù (center), or ‚ÄúMark‚Äù (march) were used. The original Zentmarken of the Niederlahngau were probably the Reckenforst around Dietkirchen, the Hadamarer Mark, the Ellarer Mark, and the Zente Winnen - H√∂hn. In the Oberlahngau were the Haiger Mark and the Herborner Mark. The Erdagau should also be understood as a sub-gau of the Lahngau. The assignment of the Kallenbach Zent (or Kallenbergskopf) north of present-day L√∂hnberg is unclear and depends on which interpretation of the boundary is adopted. With increasingly denser populations, the Zentmarken were divided or new ones were established. The population centers of the Lahngau developed from places established at fords on the Lahn. Some of these places go back, according to archaeological finds, to Frankish camps of the 6th and 7th centuries that secured crossings of the Lahn. The urban centers of the Niederlahngau were the later cities of Diez (first mentioned as \\"Theodissa\\" in 790) and Limburg (first mentioned as \\"Lintpurc\\" in 910). The centers that developed in the Oberlahngau were Wetzlar (first mentioned as \\"Weftifa\\" in 832), Haiger (first mentioned as \\"Haigrahe\\" in 778), and, depending on the course of the border, Weilburg (first mentioned as \\"Wilineburch\\" in 906). Dietkirchen (mentioned in 841 as the \\"ecclesia Dietkircha\\") emerged as an important ecclesiastical center for the Lahngau. In the Middle Ages, the St. Lubentius at Dietkirchen was the seat of an archdeaconry that included all of the areas on the right bank of the Rhine belonging to the Archbishopric of Trier. History At the time of its first historical mention, the area of the Lahngau lay in the settlement area of a Germanic tribe called the Ubii. After the migration of Ubii across the Rhine ca. 39 BC, the area was rather sparsely populated. It evolved into a border region between the Franks in the Westerwald, the Chatti in present-day North Hesse, and the Alamanni in the Taunus and Wetterau. In the 5th and 6th centuries, the Franks gained the supremacy. The Chatti became members of the Frankish tribal confederation, and Alamannia became a Frankish protectorate. This enabled the Franks to incorporate the territory of the Lahngau into its empire. During the period of Frankish conquest, the Frankish Conradine family established itself as a leading noble house in the Lahngau. The Conradines maintained close familial relationships with the Carolingians and Robertians. An important role in the management of the Lahngau was taken by the monasteries and original parishes. At the beginning of Conradine rule in the Lahngau, the only existing monastery was that of St. Lubentius in Dietkirchen, which was probably founded as early as the 6th century. The first mention of this monastery was only in 841 as a ‚Äúmonasterium‚Äù (hermitage). In 845 Count Gebhard founded the St. Severus Abbey in the Kettenbach, which would later in his lifetime relocate to Gem√ºnden. At the beginning of the 10th century, other Conradine foundations followed: St. George in Limburg (910), St. Walpurgis Abbey in Weilburg (912), and St. Mary's Abbey in Wetzlar (914/15). The Conradines achieved the peak of their power when Conrad the Younger, the Count of Oberlahngau and the Duke of Franconia, was chosen King of East Francia in 911. At least four stays by Conrad in Weilburg are attested to. The Conradines were not, however, able to establish a royal dynasty. According to Widukind of Corvey,, pp. 1‚Äì183 (Freiherr-vom-Stein Memorial edition, Volume 8). . Conrad on his deathbed in Weilburg recommended to his brother, Margrave (and later Duke) Eberhard III of Franconia, to forgo any ambition for the German crown and offer it instead to Henry of Saxony, one of his principal opponents, since he considered Henry to be the only prince capable of holding the Kingdom together in the face of internal rivalries among the dukes.Weilburg Lexikon (2006), pp. 216-217. This event would become known as the \\"Weilburg Testament,\\" but is now considered by some historians to be a legend circulated by one of the Liudolfings. In the conflict between Eberhard III of Franconia, as Conrad‚Äôs successor as Count in the Oberlahngau, and King Otto I came the final division of the Conradine dynasty. In the Battle of Andernach on October 2, 939, Eberhard was defeated and killed by his cousin Conrad Kurzbold, Count in Niederlahngau, and Eberhard‚Äôs branch of the Conradine family lost the lordship over the Oberlahngau. Parts of the realm were transferred to Conrad Kurzbold‚Äôs branch of the family and other parts confiscated by the Ottonian king. In these areas, after a checkered history, the House of the Gisos of Gudensberg prevailed until the 11th century. The area around Weilburg was granted by the Ottonian kings to the Bishopric of Worms after 1000. The Niederlahngau was held by the Conradines until the second half of the 10th century. The last mention of a Conradine count was in 966. The Niederlahngau went over to the Countship of Diez. The extensive Conradine allodial lands in the Niederlahngau came, probably through familial relationships, to the Counts of (Alt-) Leiningen. After the extinction of this house in 1220, it was distributed among the related dynasties of Nassau, Runkel/Westerburg, Isenburg/Limburg, and Virneburg. Counts in the Lahngau The following are attested as counts of the undivided Lahngau: * Conrad, attested to as Count in the Lahngau in 772 and 773; he is regarded as the father of the House of the Conradines * Udo the Elder (died 834), attested to in the Rhine region as Count in the Lahngau (820-826) and Count of Orl√©ans (828-834). * Gebhard, attested to in 832 as Count in the Lahngau; in 845, he endowed St. Severus Abbey in Kettenbach; died in Gem√ºnden in 879. He had four sons: Udo (Count in the Lahngau), Berengar (Count in the Hessengau), Waldo (abbot of St. Maximin) and Berthold (Archbishop of Trier). * Udo, son of Gebhard, Count in Lahngau around 860/879 Other possible rulers of the Lahngau referenced to are: * Adaltrud, widow of the Count in the Lahngau, gave Fulda Abbey property in Selters, Meinlinten, Buchen, and Neistenbach between 750 and 779. * Adrian; in 821, his widow Waltrat gave, with consent of a certain Uuto, property in Bermbach, Stetim and Feldum.

Embricho is the founder of the countly House of Diez.  Counts in Oberlahngau  * Conrad the Elder (died 906), son of Udo of Neustria, identified as Count in the Oberlahngau and Hessengau in 897 * Conrad the Younger (born ca. 880/885; died December 23, 918), the son Conrad the Elder; identified as Count in the Lahngau, Hessengau and probably the K√∂nigssondergau since 906; Duke of Franconia after 908, King of East Francia after 911 * Otto (died after 918), the son of Conrad the Elder; identified in 904 as Count in the Ruhrgau and in 912 as Count on the Middle Lahn * Eberhard, Otto's brother; identified as Count of Hessengau and Persgau from 913, Count of Oberlahngau from 918, Margrave from 914-918, and finally until his death Duke of Franconia; from 926 to 928 he was simultaneously Duke of Lorraine. * Udo (died 949), grandson of Udo; identified in 914 as Count in the Wetterau, in 917 and 948 as Count in the Rheingau, in 918 as Count in the Lahngau; in 914/915, he endowed St. Mary‚Äôs Abbey in Wetzlar, where he would later be buried; he is the last known Conradine count in the Oberlahngau; he married the daughter of Count Herbert I of Vermandois (a Carolingian) * Hildelin, mentioned in 975, unknown origin * Gerlach, mentioned 993‚Äì1017 (possibly identical with the Gerlach ruling at the same time in the Niederlahngau) * Giso I of the House of the Gisos, Count in the Oberlahngau ca. 1008 * Werner III of Maden, mentioned as Count in the Lahngau between 1062 and 1065; under his reign the Oberlahngau had already lost considerable property. * Hermann II of Gleiberg, mentioned in 1075, united the remnants of the Oberlahngau with the Countship of Gleiberg.  Open Questions  The main sources of the history of the Lahngau are copies made in the High Middle Ages of older documents. There is always the question whether these documents were based on original sources or produced as counterfeits. If they were based on original manuscripts, some of which would have been 500 years old, it is often unclear whether they were reproduced literally or only paraphrased. The persons named in the documents may not always be clearly identifiable. Place names are often in unusual forms and do not always correspond to the same names today. Complete overviews of property ownership for this area only exist from the 12th century, so the opportunity to draw inferences is limited. Archaeological finds that are available for review are often random finds, for example in the context of modern construction. Many suspected archaeological sites have not been systematically investigated. For these reasons, some important questions about the history of the Lahngau remain unsettled. For example, the Lahngau may originally have belonged not to the Conradines but to the Robertian sphere of influence. Through an exchange at the beginning of the 9th century, the Conradines may have taken over the Robertines‚Äô possessions in East Francia and the Robertians received the Conradine possessions on the Loire River in West Francia. Such a process would explain the equation of Udo of the Oberlahngau with Odo I of Blois, as well as the extensive holdings in the Lahngau by Lorsch Abbey (founded by the Robertians). The assignment to Weilburg to the Upper or Lower Lahngau is also controversial. Since the Conradine family line of Conrad the Elder is identified as Counts in Weilburg, the assignment has a crucial role in the history of the Oberlahngau. The development of the church organization in the Lahngau is also not exactly known. Some historians, for example, doubt that Dietkirchen could have been the starting point of Christianization in the Archdiocese of Trier, since the Archdeaconate there would only be established by the Archdiocese after the decline of Conradine rule.Schweitzer (2006), p. 4 Finally, relationship between the Conradines and the Counts of Diez can be neither proven nor disproved. The origin of the House of Diez is unknown. The extensive allodial property of the Counts of Diez in WormsgauGensicke: Landesgeschichte des Westerwaldes, (1957), p. 147 does not speak against a Conradine descent, since the Wormsgau also belonged to the Conradine sphere of influence.

Martha Fraser Martha Fraser, portrayed by Stephanie Beacham, made her first on- screen appearance on 26 January 2009. Beacham described her character as living a very solitary and lonely life. A set was built specially for Beacham's scenes, which meant, to her regret, she didn't get to appear in the Rovers. Ken Barlow (William Roache) is walking his dog, Eccles, near the canal when the dog chases after some ducks and falls into the freezing water. As Ken tries to get Eccles out, Martha extends a fishing net from her boat and manages to save her. Martha offers Ken and Eccles a place to warm up, and Ken gratefully accepts. Martha and Ken bond quickly over their shared love for literature. She tells him she has been living on a boat for seven years, ever since she split from her philandering husband. Ken confides in her about his troubled son, Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne). When Martha asks about Valerie Barlow (Anne Reid), Peter's mother, Ken tells her she is dead. Martha assumes that Ken is a widower, and Ken keeps quiet about his marriage to Deirdre (Anne Kirkbride). Ken visits her again several days later, and learns that she is now starring in a local production of A Streetcar Named Desire. In March 2009, Martha and Ken finally kiss. Ken tells Martha that he is married on 2 April 2009. She is devastated and tells him to leave. However, he keeps pestering her to admit that she has feelings for him as he tells her that he is in love with her. Despite this, she isn't interested, especially when she discovers that Deirdre didn't know about their affair. Their relationship is discovered by Audrey Roberts (Sue Nicholls), after her ex-partner Ted Page (Michael Byrne), who had known about the affair, is forced to admit it. Audrey tells Ken's son Peter. On 1 May 2009, Ken visits Martha again, where she tells him that she loves him too and they sleep together. As Ken is leaving, she tells him that she will soon be moving as she is working on a new play, and asks him to go with her. On 4 May, Martha is delighted when Ken arrives with a suitcase, saying that he is ready to join her. As she sails away, she looks back and sees Ken standing on the bridge; having changed his mind at the last minute. She was still frequently mentioned, mostly by Deirdre years afterwards; clearly illustrating just how much her affair with Ken has strained their marriage. Martha was most recently spoken about when Ken discovered that Deirdre had kissed conman Lewis Archer (Nigel Havers) and refused to talk to her, to which Deirdre reminded him that what she'd done was nowhere near as bad as what he'd done with Martha. They quickly made up. Sian Powers Ben Richardson Ben Richardson, played by Lucien Laviscount, first appeared on 2 February 2009. Ben was added to the cast of Coronation Street with Sian (Sacha Parkinson), they were friends of Sophie Webster (Brooke Vincent), and formed a new group of teenagers with Ryan Connor (Ben Thompson). Ben is the captain of his school's swimming team and embarks on a relationship with Sophie. He takes Sophie to the church youth theatre where she decides to become a Christian. In May 2009, he persuades Chesney Brown (Sam Aston) to return to school telling him he will stand up to Kenzie Judd and the other bullies if they hassle him again. On 10 July 2009, at Sally Webster's (Sally Dynevor) birthday party, Rosie (Helen Flanagan) winds Sophie up by flirting with Ben. Sophie flips and throws a drink over Rosie. However, her actions cause Sophie more problems when Ben tells Sophie he doesn't go out with drunk girls who fight, breaking up with Sophie but they eventually reconcile. In November 2009, he stays with Ryan and Michelle Connor (Kym Marsh) for a while when his parents go to Southampton. On 18 December, Ben kisses Michelle. He is dismayed by his actions and moves out, thinking it is for the best. Ryan is disgusted by this and he refuses to speak to Ben. Sophie finds out on 21 December and initially refuses to believe it, accusing Ryan of being jealous and by then fighting back, saying that Michelle has slept with several other men. She then realises what has happened when she sees Ben and apologises to Ryan for the things she said. Ben and Sophie's relationship ends and he leaves the Street Luke Strong Paula Carp Paula Carp is the mother of established character Julie Carp (Katy Cavanagh). She first appears on 27 February 2009, having a drink with her daughter and meeting old friend Eileen Grimshaw (Sue Cleaver) for the first time in years. She surprises Eileen by revealing that she gave birth to Julie when she was only fifteen. Paula and Eileen meet several times at Eileen's house but Paula leaves quickly on one occasion when Colin (Edward de Souza), Eileen's father, enters as she feels awkward around him. On 27 April 2009, at Colin's seventieth birthday party in the Rovers, Paula arrives, looking for Julie; thinking that Julie and Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas) have slept together. Julie and Paula get into an argument over why they can't be together with Paula revealing that they are in fact, related and announces to a shocked Eileen and the rest of the pub that Colin is Julie's biological father. At first, Eileen blames Paula for wrecking her parents' marriage but then comes to realise that Paula has been the victim. When Paula calls to see her a few days later, Eileen makes peace with her. After Colin comes out of hospital, following a stroke, Paula goes to the police. When they come to the house he dies suddenly of a heart attack and Julie (who was getting to know and love her father) makes it clear she feels Paula is to blame and tells her to go away and never come back. In May 2013, Paula had broken her hip while ice skating, and Julie went to take care of her. Julie returned to Coronation Street in August, after her mother had made a recovery. In December 2013, Julie announced she rang her mother every Sunday and that she has a pet dog, that she often loses. Christina Christina dropped in at the bookies soon after Peter Barlow's (Chris Gascoyne) return to Weatherfield. Peter's employee at the bookies, Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson), who also happened to be Peter's girlfriend, believed he'd spent his time away in rehab, but Christina said that he'd left rehab early to spend time with a mate on her father's yacht in the Mediterranean, and that she'd had a fling with him. Christina had no idea of Leanne's existence, and seemed more amused than annoyed at being kept in the dark by Peter. When Peter attempted to deny their affair, Christina told him to grow up, and quickly departed. Umed Alahan Umed Alahan first appeared in March 2009 to visit his nephew Dev Alahan (Jimmi Harkishin). He soon became suspicious of Dev's girlfriend Tara Mandal (Ayesha Dharker), believing that she was taking advantage of Dev's money. Umed usually appeared in comical scenes, involving himself and his family. In May 2009, Umed claimed that he knew and inspired the band Cornershop, giving them the incentive for the name as he has a history of running Indian corner stores. He also commented about the fact that their hit song, Brimful of Asha, was about Bollywood singer Asha Bhosle. Umed spent most of his time in the corner shop, which Dev owned; he also worked there. Umed usually spent his time chatting to his great niece Amber (Nikki Patel) or employee Molly Compton (Vicky Binns) while in the shop. In October 2009, Umed installed a new bell at the corner shop, annoying and driving many residents to distraction. Graeme Proctor (Craig Gazey) managed to knock the bell off and break it while pretending to clean the windows. Umed took pity on Teresa Bryant (Karen Henthorn) after Dev fired and evicted her, allowing her to make curry in Prima Doner, and managing to patch things up between her and Lloyd Mullaney (Craig Charles). When Dev found out about the curry business, Umed confessed to having lost his own business through a gambling addiction. He decided to return to India on 16 October 2009, giving Dev a hug goodbye. Justin Turner Justin Turner first appeared while working with Tara Mandal (Ayesha Dharker) in her new art gallery. He took photos which Tara considered high quality, but which her boyfriend and backer Dev Alahan (Jimmi Harkishin) saw as difficult to sell. Dev secretly purchased some of the photos to boost Tara's confidence, but when she found out, she dumped him. Before she took him back, he slept with Lisa Dalton (Ruth Alexander Rubin) and lied to Tara about it. When Tara learned of his fling, she worked with Justin to convince Dev to take naked photographs, making him believe they would be kept private. Instead, Tara had a gathering in the middle of the Street and horrified Dev by unveiling a huge naked photo with LIAR scrawled across his privates in red paint. Private Investigator Private Investigator was hired by Tony Gordon (Gray O'Brien) to gather information on new business partner Luke Strong (Craig Kelly). After a few weeks, Tom Kerrigan (Philip McGinley) told Luke he was being followed, and Luke led the investigator on a wild goose chase. Tony parted ways with him, but did learn about the poor state of Luke's finances. Rick Peach Rick Peach was a vicar who was involved in scenes with Sophie Webster (Brooke Vincent) and Blanche Hunt (Maggie Jones). During Easter Sunday, he allowed people to bring their animals to the church, and Simon Barlow (Alex Bain) brought his rabbit. Blanche wasn't happy however after she stood in dog excrement, and accused Rick of using the animals as an excuse to get people to come to the church, Rick found this funny. Sophie revealed that she would be baptised by Rick as he had brought Jesus into her life. During a memorial service on Christmas Eve 2010 in respect to the victims of a recent Tram Crash in Coronation Street, Rick was conducting the service. However it was interrupted with the return of Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford) who was released from prison. Connie Rathbone Connie Rathbone was a close friend of Jack Duckworth (Bill Tarmey). She first appears on 17 April 2009, when she discovers one of Jack's missing pigeons and returns it to him. Connie and Jack get friendly as they chat about them both being widows. As Connie's visits become more frequent, Tyrone (Alan Halsall) gets annoyed, seeing it as an insult to Jack's deceased wife Vera's (Liz Dawn) memory. In May, Connie invites Jack on holiday to Spain with her. Jack is afraid of what Tyrone will think of him and Connie going on holiday together, he lies and says he is going to Blackpool. In July, he visits Connie at her house and is amazed to discover that she is rich and lives in a lavish mansion. Tyrone is initially hostile towards Connie as he sees her as an insult to memories of Vera and believing she is after Jack's money, but realises this is not the case after seeing her big house. Jack moves in with Connie in September 2009 to give Tyrone and Molly more space. In November 2009, Jack and Connie join Tyrone in the Rovers for a drink. After Connie leaves, Jack tells Tyrone he is worried that she wants more than companionship. Jack then hides out at Tyrone's until Connie catches up with him and reveals it is only a misunderstanding about her sleepwalking, much to Jack's relief. Connie and Jack join Tyrone, Molly (Vicky Binns), Pam Hobsworth (Kate Anthony) and Bill Webster (Peter Armitage) for Christmas Day 2009. Connie returns in November 2010 to attend Jack's 74th birthday party. After returning from his party at the Rovers, Connie, Tyrone and Molly discover that Jack has died in his sleep in his favourite armchair. Connie attends his funeral and goes to Blackpool with Tyrone and Molly to scatter his ashes. After Molly's funeral and upon Tyrone discovering Molly's affair with Kevin Webster (Michael Le Vell), Connie tries to help and comfort him but his emotions get the better of him and a tearful Connie leaves the house.

Norris refuses to forgive him and Ramsay leaves, disappointed, in the back of a taxi. Norris and Emily are shocked to hear that, on arrival in Australia, Ramsay was found dead on the plane. Ramsay leaves his estate to Norris, who initially tells Emily to take the trunk to her charity shop but she insists that Norris goes through it first. Inside the trunk, Norris finds a pile of letters that Ramsay had written to their mother, all returned unopened, and in Ramsay's wallet, a cold note from Eunice, asking him not to get in touch as she had another son and his appearance in their lives would ruin everything. Devastated, Norris wishes that he had been more receptive to Ramsay but accepts that it is now too late. Ruth Deller of entertainment website lowculture.co.uk criticises Ramsay, citing his inclusion in the series as opportunistic, also stating: \\"Ramsay was by far people's most loathed this month. Brought in as a publicity stunt after the Brand/Ross affair and dropped shortly after, Andrew Sachs' Ramsay was a rare example of an old man character being seen by fans as a ‚ÄòMary-Sue‚Äô (i.e. someone we‚Äôre supposed to think is wonderful but generally don‚Äôt ‚Äì usually reserved for someone much younger). There was great rejoicing when he left this month, and hopefully the best mature cast in soap will soon recover from this minor blip.\\" Vinnie Powers Vinnie Powers is the father of Sian Powers (Sacha Parkinson).

Rick Neelan Rick Neelan, played by Greg Wood, made his first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 9 November 2009. In April 2012, it was announced Wood would be reprising his role.

After Joe fails to pay back the money, Rick goes to his house and Joe gives him his van and promises him he will get the rest of the money. Rick returns numerous times in the following months. He pretends to be interested in buying Joe's fianc√©e Gail Platt's (Helen Worth) house, before demanding money from Joe. He then pretends to be interested in Joe's daughter Tina's (Michelle Keegan) flat. Joe then threatens Rick telling him to stay away from him and his family, but Rick warns him to have the money soon. Joe borrows ¬£4,000 from Gail's father Ted Page (Michael Byrne) and gives it to Rick and tells him he will not get anything else from him and that their debt is settled, which Rick agrees with. However, a week later Rick turns up at Joe's wedding and tells him that he wants ¬£500 a week for the next 10 weeks making a total of ¬£5000 and that this is \\"interest\\". He also tells Joe that if he doesn't pay up he will break his arms and legs. Two weeks later after Joe and Gail return from their honeymoon Joe is walking home from the pub alone and Rick's car pulls up alongside Joe and Rick has one of his heavies. Rick asks Joe for his next instalment but as Joe is unable to pay Rick and the heavy gets out and chase him. Joe is able to outrun them and hides in the ginnel, whilst Rick looks around for him, unsuccessfully. A few weeks later, after Joe's death, Rick returns to the Street and threatens Gail on her doorstep, demanding his money. She refuses to give him any money and he leaves. The next day Rick returns again and after visiting Gail, again unsuccessfully, he confronts Tina and her boyfriend Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas) at the door of their flat. Jason tells Rick he will not be getting any money off them. Rick goes to the local newsagents, The Kabin, and returns with a newspaper, which he sets alight before putting it through Jason and Tina's letter box. After Jason puts the fire out and runs out into the street, Rick waves at Jason and speeds off in his car before Jason can catch him. A couple of weeks later the police inform Gail and Tina that they are questioning Rick in connection with Joe's death. Later on they confirm that he will to be charged with his previous crimes but that he was not involved in Joe's death. In May 2012, Rick returns to collect money from a loan that he gave to Terry Duckworth (Nigel Pivaro). Terry owes Rick ¬£19,000 and Tina, who is now dating Terry's son Tommy's (Chris Fountain), recognizes him. After Rick and two heavies threaten Tina in a new lap-dancing club Terry is planning on opening, Tommy pays ¬£10,000 of the debt with money he had inherited from his late grandfather, before Terry flees, leaving Tommy to pay the rest of the debt. After asking Tommy to perform a series of crimes to pay back his father's debt, Rick orders Tommy to drop off a bag of drugs in Amsterdam. Tina is outraged that Tommy is working for the man she holds responsible for her father's death and takes the drugs from the car and drives to the local canal. She rings Rick and threatens to throw the drugs into the canal. Rick arrives at the scene, but has kidnapped Tina's friend Rita Sullivan (Barbara Knox) who is due to get married. After a confrontation and stand-off by the canalside in which Rick threatens to throw Rita into the canal, Tina is forced to hand over the drugs and Rick lets go of Rita, picks up the drugs and gets ready to leave for Amsterdam. But unbeknownst to Rick, Tina had already informed the police of his plan and they arrive just as he is leaving, led by Kirsty Soames (Natalie Gumede), and arrest Rick. He is last seen being put into the back of a police van. The next day Kirsty informs Tina that Rick is facing a prison sentence of at least eight years and that they are rounding up his gang. By 2019, Rick was released from prison, and turned up at the Builder's Yard in Weatherfield on 31 March; demanding ¬£9,000 owed to him by local builder Gary Windass (Mikey North). However, Gary did not have the money on him, but assured Rick he would get him his money as soon as he could. Rick threatened Gary and later showed up outside 8 Coronation Street, where he told Gary he had until 6pm the next day to get him his money; and pointed out the fact that 9 years ago, an ex-customer of his named \\"Joe McIntyre\\", used to live at the same house; until he accidentally drowned. Gary uses the money that Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne) gives him as a bribe to pay off Rick, but he later returns after Sarah Platt (Tina O'Brien), Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson) and Toyah Battersby (Georgia Taylor) break into his office and steal his customer's passports. Assuming Gary took the passports, Rick and Gary have a showdown in the woods where in self defence, Gary kills Rick with a shovel and buries his body.

Bernie soon began a relationship with Dev. In December 2009, Dev discovered that ex-wife Sunita Parekh (Shobna Gulati) was engaged to Matt Davis (Christopher Colquhoun), a man Bernie was also giving golf lessons to. After several confrontations with them, Dev ordered Bernie to cancel Matt's lessons and argued with her about his children. On 14 December, Dev tried to make it up with Bernie over lunch by asking her to move in with him. Bernie however, knew he was only doing it to get back at Sunita and dumped him.

Dev soon discovered Matt was engaged to his ex Sunita, and was extremely jealous, barging into their house and arguing with them both several times, claiming he didn't want somebody else bringing up his kids. Dev and Sunita eventually reached a truce and all three ended up on better terms. Matt himself, however, began to feel sidelined when Dev took a more active role in looking after the kids and cracks started to show in his relationship with Sunita. In mid-January 2010, Sunita informed a secretly delighted Dev that she and Matt had broken up. Matt briefly returned on 22 February 2010 to try and resolve things with Sunita but was surprised when Dev was there and assumed he had got back with Sunita himself. In actuality, Dev was pretending to be married to Sunita to fool her aunts, Upma and Grishma. After Dev told the aunts that Matt was the kids' Maths tutor, a confused and rejected Matt left. Claudia Colby Claudia Colby was introduced as an old friend of Audrey Roberts (Sue Nicholls). On 5 October 2009, it was announced that Rula Lenska would portray Claudia. A Coronation Street spokesperson said: \\"Rula will play a glamorous friend of Audrey's who she meets up with at a function. She makes Audrey think about her life and what she wants out of it. She will film her scenes on Friday 16 October and will appear on screen in the run-up to Christmas.\\" In 2010, Nicholls has revealed that Lenska would return to Coronation Street for a future storyline. Talking about Audrey and Claudia's relationship, Nicholls said, \\"Yes, she's a little bit like the wicked witch, isn't she? It's great fun. In my head, Claudia is that friend you know is always going to be a pain. She's the one who says the wrong thing, is always trying to out do you and has a habit of saying really horrid things even though she thinks they're a joke. But I think in a funny way they really do get on. She gets quite drunk at the party and when Audrey makes her announcement she has no qualms about filling Gail in on Lewis' past.\\" She made a return in later 2010./ In December 2010, it was reported that Claudia may become landlady of the local pub The Rovers Return replacing Liz McDonald (Beverley Callard), a spokesperson said \\"Claudia ticks all the boxes for a feisty, no-nonsense landlady of a certain age. She could certainly make a great Rovers boss to follow in Liz's footsteps.\\" However, producer Phil Collinson later said the storyline suggestion was untrue. In May 2011, it was announced that Lenska was to leave the serial in order to appear in theatre. A spokesperson for the serial stated: \\"We've loved having Rula. She's been absolutely brilliant as Claudia and we hope one day she'll return.\\" Her departure will allow fellow characters Audrey and Marc to pursue a relationship. Producers decided to \\"leave the door open\\" for a possible return in the future as Claudia has proven to be a popular character. On 19 March 2018, it was announced Lenska would reprise the role of Claudia in a new storyline with Audrey in a bid to bring back light-heartedness to the show. Claudia returned on 25 July 2018. Storylines =2009‚Äì2011= Claudia attended a Weatherfield Traders' Association lunch, escorted by Lewis Archer (Nigel Havers), who she often hired for functions. Audrey also went and was shocked that Claudia employed a male escort, but Claudia explained that there was no sex involved and that it was just for appearances. Later, Claudia met up with Audrey again and they went to a dinner dance together. Lewis was also attending, escorting Rita Sullivan (Barbara Knox). Claudia was surprised to find out that Audrey had hired Lewis several times and had fallen for him. She reminded Audrey that Lewis's charms were contractual and when she met Audrey and Lewis again a couple of months later in a restaurant she made it quite clear that she still regarded Lewis as contactable. Claudia's doubts about Lewis' reliability as a permanent suitor for Audrey were to be proved right. On 13 August 2010, Claudia attended a party Audrey's daughter, Gail McIntyre (Helen Worth), threw for Audrey and Lewis who were moving abroad to run a hotel. However, Lewis chose that day to vanish from Audrey's life and Audrey was confronted by footage of him defrauding Barlow's Bookies and diverting Deirdre Barlow's (Anne Kirkbride) attention by kissing her. Claudia got drunk with Rita, and delighted in the floor show as Gail pushed a Manchester tart into Deirdre's face. Claudia was not seen again until she arrived in The Rovers on New Year's Eve 2010, where she donated the prize of luxury treatments in Perm Suspect to the evening's charity raffle and befriended locals. The prize was won by a disgruntled Audrey, who had already had her nose put out of joint after her donation of a pedicure and manicure at Audrey's salon was somewhat dwarfed by Claudia's generosity. Claudia was keen to grow her business and initially showed interest in purchasing the butchers premises on Victoria Street from Claire Peacock (Julia Haworth) to convert into a rival salon to Audrey's salon. When Audrey claimed her free hair treatment at Perm Suspect, Claudia revealed that she was no longer interested in buying the premises as it smelt of meat. She asked if Audrey was interested in selling to her, an offer that was flatly refused. Claudia told Audrey that she had set her sights on Marc Selby (Andrew Hall), a client sat near them who had recently been widowed and not long after the pair start dating. In March 2011, while having her hair done one of Audrey's elderly clients dies, Claudia and Audrey are left horrified. Soon after, Claudia begins to suspect Marc is having an affair and Audrey joins Claudia in spying on him at his home. Claudia is angered to see a woman leaving his house. Later, Marc tries to explain himself to Claudia by saying that the woman was his sister, but Claudia does not believe him. In April 2011, Claudia spots a receipt in Marc's wallet and assumes it is a gift for her, totally oblivious to knowing it is in fact for his alter-ego \\"Marcia\\". In May 2011, Claudia suspects that Audrey is the woman Marc is seeing behind her back. Her suspicions arise when she spots Audrey at Marc's house, only to be shocked when Marcia enters the room; a disgusted Claudia storms out. A few weeks later, Claudia meets Audrey in The Rovers in an attempt to build bridges, however, Marc appears from the bathroom, having been with Audrey. A furious Claudia walks out of The Rovers firing insults at Audrey and Marc and telling them she does not want to see them again, before leaving. She is later mentioned when Deirdre recommends Claudia's hair salon against Audrey's salon to newcomer, Stella Price (Michelle Collins). In 2012, Rita mentions that she had to go to Claudia's salon as Audrey was fully booked, complaining about the loud music. =2018‚Äì2020= Claudia returns to Weatherfield in July 2018 amidst a feud between Audrey and her stylist, Maria Connor (Samia Longchambon). Seizing a chance to annoy Audrey, Claudia offers Maria the opportunity to run her own salon under Claudia's chain, however she demanded that Maria provide the money to pay for the new salon immediately. After failing to gain investment from Carla Connor (Alison King), Maria is invested in by Rita, who can see how spiteful Audrey is being about the situation. At the same time, Claudia becomes close friends with Ken Barlow (William Roache), and supports him when he learns that his pregnant daughter-in-law, Sinead Tinker (Katie McGlynn), has been diagnosed with cervical cancer. Eventually, when both Claudia and Audrey are invited to an awards ceremony for the North West Salons Awards, their feud reaches breaking point when Claudia nominates Audrey for the lifetime achievement award, hoping to show rival salons that Audrey should be slowing down and eventually drop out of hairdressing forever. However, when presented with a bouquet of flowers, Audrey throws the flowers at Claudia, who dramatically knocks all the glasses over on the table. Later, when she sees how Maria and Audrey are starting to become close again, Claudia reminds Maria that she works for her now, and not to be as friendly with Audrey anymore. Claudia begins a relationship with Ken in 2019. After being scammed out of all her money, Audrey decides to sell her share of the salon to Claudia, infuriating Audrey's grandson, David Platt (Jack P. Shepherd), who squirts shampoo over both Audrey and Claudia. When Ken's son, Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne), suffers an alcohol relapse, Claudia pays for Peter to enter rehab. Claudia later supports Audrey when it transpires that her eldest grandson, Nick Tilsley (Ben Price), was the culprit who scammed her out of her money. In 2020, Claudia began to suggest to Ken they move to a retirement community. Ken, after some consideration, accepts. In April 2020 Ken breaks up with Claudia and returned to 1 Coronation Street, with that Claudia made her departure from the soap after her actress quit the soap in April of that year.

In the liner notes for Introduction to War (2001), their former manager, Stephen Graziano, called them, \\"...the baddest, craziest, most misbehaved but mind bendingly brilliant band that was walking the Earth.\\" This coincides with Mojo magazine's assessment that \\"the story of Certain General is one of triumph, tragedy, and often dazzling music.\\"''Mojo magazine, September 2007. Drawing on a tradition established by New York rock bands such as the Velvet Underground, Certain General has recorded and performed extensively in the United States and Europe. Although various personnel and label changes have occurred over the years, Dulany and Gammage, along with Kevin Tooley, continue to record and perform. With one foot firmly planted in the post-punk sound of the late seventies and the other in the emerging new wave, at the outset, Certain General's quirky, kinetic, rhythm and sound owed more to the \\"dead disco and happening hip-hop,\\" as parleyed by such emerging New York entities as James Chance and the Contortions than the moody, psychedelia-gone-mad direction that would follow. However, from the start, their unique mix of evocative lyrics and a consistently frenetic live show quickly earned the band widespread acclaim when they began to play shows in 1981. As Boston Rock noted at the time, they were \\"superbly energetic, the last time the band played here the crowd almost tore the walls down.\\"Boston Rock, November 1981. New York rock critic heavyweight Christgau from the Village Voice weighed in that the band produced \\"rolling, ambitious, somewhat mannered art pop that is totally original.\\"Robert Christgau, Village Voice, May 1981. And his colleague, Van Gosse, maintained that \\"this band so fervent and young has come to stand for something.\\"Van Gosse, Village Voice, November 11, 1981. That notoriety would eventually extend to Europe, where they would release November's Heat in 1984. Considered a seminal album of the 1980s and one of the defining New York rock records, November's Heat would earn the band many accolades, especially in France. In 1995, Rock & Folk called it \\"one of the most important albums made between 1965 and 1995.\\" History  Origins: 1980‚Äì1985  Certain General came together as a band in late 1980 after meeting in Manhattan's East Village. Before playing their first club date at New York's Hurrah, the band had already created a buzz among the downtown Manhattan music and art communities. Loft parties, art openings, and after-hours shows in lower Manhattan served as their springboard and they quickly became one of the darlings of a downtown scene based in the Club 57 social club inhabited by such artists, actors, and musicians as Keith Haring, Jean-Michel Basquiat, John Sex, Wendy Wild, and Ann Magnuson, among others. Bassist Russell Berke (Carla Bley), drummer Marcy Saddy (Toronto's the B-Girls), and guitarist Phil Gammage (the Corvairs) collaborated with painter and poet Parker Dulany to create a live show that captivated the local New York press. New York Rocker quickly proclaimed them \\"the most kinetically exciting new band.\\"New York Rocker, October 1981. By 1981 and 1982 the band was performing in East Coast venues and colleges from Canada to Texas. Early shows found them sharing the stage with fellow New York and Boston bands such as DNA, Bush Tetras, Liquid Liquid, Mission of Burma, Raybeats, and Swans. Their prominence grew as their presence was increasingly felt within the downtown scene and the band found themselves at various times serving as the house band at both CBGBs and Danceteria, venues that are both now gone, but nonetheless remain legendary for the pivotal role they played in the club scene at the time. Certain General were almost synonymous with that scene, becoming ubiquitous hosts at such other venues as the Mudd Club, the Peppermint Lounge, The Rat, 9:30 Club, and downtown's Hoboken, NJ annex, Maxwell's. They would remain staples of this scene for several years. In a review of a show for These Are the Days (1986) at Danceteria, Richard Grabel of the New Musical Express wrote \\"in a wall of ingenious noise Parker seems like a fallen angel out of a page by Rimbaud.\\"Richard Grabel, New Musical Express, April 25, 1986, p. 39. The original lineup at CBGBs, New York, in 1981. Left to right: Marcy Saddy, Russell Berke, Parker Dulany, and Phil Gammage. In 1982, the group signed with the New York independent record label Labor Records and recorded their debut, Holiday of Love. The five-song EP was produced by Peter Holsapple of The dB's and mixed by Michael Gira of fellow Labor Records label mates Swans, \\"an interesting pairing if there ever was one.\\"Nick West, Bucketfull of Brains, Invisible New York review, December 5, 2008; . Holiday garnered rave reviews, among them a Trouser Press piece that cited the disc as being created \\"for all the teenage devils of the world.\\"Trouser Press, 1982. In 1983, original bassist Berke would depart to be replaced by roadie and all-around funster, Joe Lupo, and the band would begin work on recording their first proper album. While the bass work of Berke was widely regarded as brilliant, Graziano remarked that Lupo was \\"the plutonium rod that fueled the Certain General party reactor. During this time, Certain General would catch the attention of British music journalist Kris Needs, who championed the band and later served as their host during their first UK visit. At the suggestion of Needs, Far Away in America (1984) was conceived as a collaboration of sorts and the LP was shared with another New York band, friends and musical colleagues Band of Outsiders. Independently released on SourMash Records in April 1984, it featured two live and two studio recordings by each band. The two groups furthered the co-op approach and toured together in the spring and summer of 1984 in both the United States and the United Kingdom to promote the record. Highlights of the UK dates included shows at Alice in Wonderland (where in his typical exuberance Dulany smashed his hand through the asbestos ceiling) and the Batcave in London, as well as the Hacienda (with James) in Manchester. The album, coupled with their New York and London performances, would also draw the attention of Chris Parry and his London-based Fiction Publishing. This coincided with a change in management, when the band signed on with Ruth Polsky (the booking agent for New York clubs Hurrah and Danceteria) and her agency, Blind Dates Management. They also began work with the new French record label L'Invitation au Suicide (I.A.S. Records) and made plans to license a newly recorded second LP to the label. The band leveraged the Parry relationship and agreed to appear in support of The Cure, who were already signed to Fiction, at New York's Beacon Theater on November 14, an appearance that would be a 1984 highlight. Fans of both bands would maintain that since there was some common ground in the respective sounds of the two bands at that time, the pairing certainly made sense from a musical standpoint. However, their respective positions in the musical pantheon of the day was another issue indeed. Certain General's innate hunger to perform and desire to move forward would serve them well in the context, which became something of a pattern for the band. Rising to the opportunity presented by the Beacon gig, by all accounts the band certainly delivered. David Fricke of the Melody Maker wrote of this performance \\"Certain General defy equilibrium in their abrasive velvet descended attack and by set's end they are a revved-up dance engine with juggernaut possibilities.\\"David Fricke, Melody Maker, December 8, 1984. November's Heat and These Are the Days: \\"Nous Voila\\" Self-financed from earnings saved from performances at New York's Danceteria, November's Heat was released in France in November 1984 by I.A.S. Records. Backstage at Danceteria (left to right): Marcy Saddy, Joe Lupo, Parker Dulany, and Phil Gammage. This would prove to be a major turning point. When they arrived in Paris on February 3, 1985, the French daily Lib√©ration welcomed the band and marked their arrival with front-page coverage and three interior articles, with a headline above a front-page photo that announced: \\"Certain General: Nous Voila (We Are Here).\\" Calling the band \\"Jim Jarmusch's and William Faulkner's America,\\" and referring to Dulany as \\"desperately beautiful,\\" Lib√©ration declared Certain General \\"best new band\\" and awarded \\"1984 album of the year\\" honors for the release.Lib√©ration, February 3, 1985. The UK would take notice as well, with the New Musical Express designating Heat one of their \\"Five-Star Albums.\\" New Musical Express, 1985. Although the next two years saw the band tour and make television appearances in France several times, within the United States, the group's profile remained primarily underground as they continued to perform mainly on the East Coast. To a large degree this was due to internal differences as to where they should appear: tours on the West Coast and in the South failed to materialize not because the opportunities did not present themselves, but rather, because internal strife prevented follow through. However, their reach on the eastern seaboard can be neither ignored nor discounted and their cultural influence was by no means limited to New York. Whether it was due to one of their regular jaunts at the Paradise Club in Boston or City Gardens in Trenton, with a stop at the East Side Club in Philly on their way to 688 in Atlanta, aside from being merely heard in some of the top clubs of the time, they made their presence known and their impact felt. The bands with whom Certain General appeared in the early- and mid- eighties is a veritable list of many of the top independent rock bands of the era: Green on Red, Rain Parade, Mission of Burma, Gun Club, Oingo Boingo, New Order, Rank and File, The Rezillos, The Bongos, The Nails, Gang of Four, R.E.M., Pylon, The Sisters of Mercy, Way of the West, Medium Medium, and Raybeats. In the context of playing as the opener, Certain General built a much-deserved reputation for surpassing those they were supporting. They became a force to be reckoned with. In a review of an appearance in Salt Lake City, the Salt Lake City Tribune reported that \\"after New Order had finished, it was opening act Certain General that continued to resonate in the mind.\\"Salt Lake City Tribune, August 20, 1985. While successful in France, November's Heat was not released in the United States until 2000, rather odd considering that the band was covered widely, especially by the much-respected UK music press. At the time, Sounds wrote of their live performances > ... they demonstrated that there are still bands around that can deliver the > goods without the usual accoutrements of cheekbone image ... Strong on > tunes, energy and power; they might not be known at the moment but with > performances like this and a glittering debut LP, they will be soon.Sounds > magazine, 1985. The New Musical Express reviewed a show at New York's Pyramid Club and Lindsay Shapiro called Certain General \\"New York's answer to the (Echo and the) Bunnymen with a few [Jim] Morrison tendencies thrown in\\" [but with] \\"plenty of individuality and a lead singer full of passionate presence‚Äîagonized lyrics torn from twitching limbs.\\" The review concluded by observing that CG was \\"almost psychedelic in their unfettered spirit.\\" 1985 saw more personnel changes as Sprague Hollander replaced original guitarist Phil Gammage. In France, I.A.S. Records released the band's next recording project prior to its completion, in fear that they would lose the group to a major label. This \\"bootleg\\" would become the infamous These Are the Days and would still somehow win great praise from the press despite the glaring inconsistencies of an unfinished work. Regarding Days, Steve Mirkin wrote \\"Filled with a dark confidence and narcotic allure ... with a charged confidence and kamikaze edge.\\" In response to the copyright infringement of the record by I.A.S., Ruth Polsky released a finished single by the band (\\"Will You\\" and \\"Bad Way\\") on her own New York-based label, S.U.S.S. Records. This success was overshadowed by tragedy when Ruth was killed in a horrific car accident that left her pinned beneath a yellow cab in the doorway of The Limelight club, a converted church in New York, as the band performed there in September 1986. The band would not learn of Polsky's death until the following morning. After a memorial show for Polsky with New Order and Karen Finley at the Roxy in New York and the second of two tours with New Order, Certain General slowly retreated to Paris to convalesce and reorganize. One can speculate that the fact that TimeOut would later describe Dulany as \\"the haunted crooner\\"TimeOut, February 28, 2002. can be traced to this watershed event. 1987‚Äì1998 After again touring France in 1987, Certain General signed to the prestigious French label, Barclay Records (Jacques Brel, Noir Desir) and recorded Cabin Fever. The LP included their best selling single to date, \\"I Lose Myself,\\" which was cited as \\"one of the 10 best singles of 1988\\" by Lib√©ration.Lib√©ration, December 28, 1988. Based on the success of Fever and the attention it garnered in French press,Lib√©ration, November 12, 1988. the group continued to tour and perform in France. In 1990, Barclay Records issued the album Jacklighter, produced by Fred Maher, Gavin Mackillop, and Lloyd Cole. It featured Lloyd and fellow 'Commotion' Blair Cowen on the single, \\"Baby Are You Rich?\\" The single fared well, but the group was dropped from Barclay in 1992. Following the release of Jacklighter the band entered a period of hiatus until the late nineties while its various members pursued other projects. 1999‚Äì2009 In 1999, original guitarist Gammage rejoined the band and the group's original line-up re-united to record Signals from the Source in the CBGB's basement studio for Hilly Kristal's CBGB Records. Genya Ravan (the Dead Boys) produced the record. These Are the Days was officially released on France's Fantastica Label and the group played a nationwide tour of France, co-headlining with fellow New Yorkers The Fleshtones. In 2000, Fantastica released the Arnaud Dieterlan-produced Closer to the Sun, which was recorded in Paris during the 1999 tour. 2001 saw the group issue Live at the Public Theater on its own PreFab International Records. This recording featured a duet of Serge Gainsbourg's \\"La Decadanse\\" with Julee Cruise (Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks). 2010‚Äìpresent On May 21, 2010, Certain General released their first collection of new material since Closer to the Sun, released in 2000. The new 13-song CD, entitled Stolen Car, is composed of 12 new songs written by the band plus a remake of their 1982 recording \\"Hello My God.\\" Featuring original band members Parker Dulany (lead vocals, bass) and Phil Gammage (guitar) along with longtime drummer Kevin Tooley, Stolen Car continues the band's tendency toward expansive and exploratory rock sounds. Produced by Tooley at his Concept Studios in New York, Stolen Car includes contributions from sax session musician Robert Aaron, a veteran of recordings by David Bowie, James White, and Al Jarreau, among many others. In a Le Son du Maquis press release from March 2010, Dulany commented on the writing, recording, and producing aspects of this collection: > After thinking about it for the last 10 years, we decided to make good on > our threat to make some racket. From the outset we intended that this > adventure sit well next to two albums in our canon: November's Heat and > These Are the Days. We strove to capture the feeling that no matter how much > you felt that you were in control of your life and your destiny, in reality, > you were not. Stolen Car is a metaphor for this statement: \\"Who is driving, > please?\\" In expressing this declaration we avoided all of the usual > recording entrapments: No big studios, no outside producer, no instruments > of 'sentiment' such as acoustic guitars or strings; nothing that the three > of us could not play ourselves. Well almost nothing, as Robert Aaron's sax > contributions could not ignored; we are strict, but not stupid. We wrote by > committee, arranged by committee, played by committee, drank by committee, > and then let Kevin mix alone. So Kevin is the producer, Stolen Car is the > album, and Certain General is the band. The band toured Europe in the spring of 2016. Influence Their ongoing success abroad notwithstanding, Certain General's influence continues to resonate in the US. In a review of a gig marking the release of Introduction to War at Don Hill's in New York, Kristy Eldredge wrote in Glorious Noise, that Dulany > embodies subtle but powerful charisma ... and slender scarecrow elegance ... > (his) body language is the loosest and he seems to have the most soul. The > French don't always choose the most worthy American icons to elevate, but > they seem to on to something with Certain General.Kristy Eldredge, Glorious > Noise, April 11, 2002. On to something they were; in 1999 Lib√©ration compared Certain General to the U-boat in the 1981 film Das Boot, calling them \\"insubmersible.\\"Lib√©ration, April 12, 1999. The landscape that simultaneously served as their living room and the ultimate party venue, New York's East Village and downtown, have not been so durable. Replacing the artist's lofts, dives, and backrooms that were their laboratory are the all-too typical earmarks of any modern gentrified locale: the Nine Wests, the Starbucks, the Gaps et al.. Fortunately, in spite of these less-than-inspiring surroundings and unlike most of their peers, the band carries on: Parker Dulany, Phil Gammage and Kevin Tooley continue to perform and record as Certain General. Compilations and re-issues November's Heat continues to be issued and re-issued worldwide (Bomp/Alive Records, Fan Club Records, and Commotion Records). In 2001, SourMash Records issued the two-CD set An Introduction to War, which included the previously unreleased album The Dead Rabbit Gang (songs that were to be released after November's Heat in 1985), and a disc of live material, Savage Young Generals, circa 1981‚Äì1982. In 2005, Certain General were included in Soul Jazz Records three-CD compilation series entitled, New York Noise, which featured most of the prominent post-punk New York bands from 1978‚Äì1982. In 2007, UK label Easy Action Records released the only comprehensive retrospective devoted to Certain General, Invisible New York. That disc included a collaboration of \\"New York, New York\\" with Julee Cruise and Lenny Kaye, which was recorded in response to 9/11. Solo and side projects During his years performing with and without Certain General, guitarist Phil Gammage continued to record and perform under his own name, with several of his recordings being released by the Paris-based New Rose Records. His most recent album is Used Man For Sale (PreFab International, Continental Record Services, 2016). In addition, he has worked as a recording session guitarist and harmonica player. Several of his songs have appeared on television and film soundtracks. Parker Dulany has continued his work as a painter and poet. He recorded a solo album, Mr. Parker's Band, which was released in 1995 on the French label Night and Day Records.

In an experiment to measure and compare the roughness of different sounds, listeners are presented with different sounds and asked to rate their roughness, for example on a rating scale. Recent research has displayed that there are two different codes, at least, for roughness: a vibrotactile code used for fine surfaces, and a spatial code used for coarse to medium surfaces. According to psychophysical theory, the roughness of a complex sound (a sound comprising many partials or pure tone components) depends on the distance between the partials measured in critical bandwidths. Any simultaneous pair of partials of about the same amplitude that is less than a critical bandwidth apart produces roughness associated with the inability of the basilar membrane to separate them clearly. Roughness is physiologically determined and therefore universal, but it is appraised differently in different musical styles. Some musical styles deliberately create large amounts of roughness for aesthetic effect (for example some polyphonic styles in the Balkans in which singers favor simultaneous second intervals) while others try to avoid roughness as much as possible or treat rough sounds in special ways (for example most tonal western music). In terms of psychophysics, several studies have been done involving a person‚Äôs ability to detect the differences between the weight and roughness of objects. A syndrome called Verger-Dejerine syndrome has been known to affect these somatosensory abilities. Patients with this somatosensory cortical loss syndrome commonly display damage to their parietal lobe and it was eventually concluded that it may be that the brain has some form of an asymmetrical organization, as performance in a normal subject shows oblique differences depending on their hand use. However, these patients still exhibit normal or minimally reduced peripheral sensitivity to cold, heat, pain, touch and deep pressure. Roughness perception is one of the multidimensional scaling of texture perception, which is the judgment of the substance and quality of an object. The studies of roughness perception demonstrate that it is unidimensional, it depends on element height, diameter, shape, compliance, and density; and that the relationship between roughness perception and the physical properties of a surface is complex and nonlinear. Also, there were early observations stated that scanning velocity and contact force between the finger and a surface have minor or no effect on roughness magnitude judgments. The physical determinants of roughness perception are complex, but the evidence is that the neural mechanisms are simple. Furthermore, research performed at the University of North Carolina revealed that scanning velocity did not have an effect on relative roughness because the roughness for all surfaces increase by the same amount as scanning velocity increases in accordance with Weber's Law.

Hazel Wilding Hazel Wilding first appears on 23 January 2002 when cab driver Vikram Desai (Chris Bisson) picks up her from an upmarket suburb. Immediately, Hazel flirts heavily with Vikram and she then requests his services more frequently. It is not long before Hazel seduces Vikram at a hotel wearing lingerie and bearing a bottle of champagne. In February 2002, Vikram is shocked to discover that Hazel is married and feels that things between them have become too complicated. He then keeps a distance from her by sending other drivers when she requests his cab. It is not long before Vikram resumes his secret affair with Hazel as she gives him a gold bracelet for his birthday and he dumps girlfriend Bobbi Lewis for Hazel. When Les Battersby (Bruce Jones) comes to collect Hazel one day, he is very suggestive and she slaps him. She demands to know what Vikram has told his staff at the office about her. Vikram is livid with Les and confides in his cousin Dev Alahan (Jimmi Harkishin) that he has fallen in love with Hazel. When Hazel's husband John discovers the affair, he threatens Vikram to stay away from his wife. Hazel later makes it clear to Vikram that she will not leave John for him, and after several threats from John, Hazel tells Vikram that she was in on his plan all along. Archie Shuttleworth Archie Shuttleworth, played by actor Roy Hudd, is a local undertaker. Blanche Hunt (Maggie Jones) introduces her boyfriend, undertaker Archie Shuttleworth, to her family and friends. Archie thinks Blanche is a right laugh. Blanche fakes weakness to win sympathy from Archie. Blanche is cheered up by Archie's visit. Blanche has a date with Archie despite Blanche's daughter Deirdre Rachid (Anne Kirkbride) and her partner Ken Barlow (William Roache) arrive home to find them dancing in the front room. Archie invites Blanche to go to Blackpool for the weekend with him. Blanche says she'll think about it. Deirdre is horrified. Jack Duckworth (Bill Tarmey) offers his services to Archie as a pallbearer; Archie says he'll bear it in mind if they're ever desperate. Archie and Blanche leave for Blackpool in Archie's hearse. Blanche and Archie arrive back from Blackpool where they've had a fantastic time ballroom dancing. Deirdre is shocked to learn that they stayed in Archie's caravan, which is open plan. Blanche tells Norris Cole (Malcolm Hebden) and Betty Williams (Betty Driver) that she is going to one of Archie's funerals and persuades Betty to join them. Archie tries to flatter Norris's work employee Rita Sullivan (Barbara Knox) into also becoming a professional mourner, but she refuses. After letting Blanche down by cancelling their plans for a day out, Archie promises to take her out for a slap-up meal the following evening. Archie tries to apologise for standing Blanche up, but she is having none of it. Archie turns up at the Barlows' house to serenade Blanche, attracting many The Rovers Return Inn customers who are touched by his gesture. Blanche forgives Archie. Archie arrives early at the Barlows' house, making Deirdre think that he stayed the night. Blanche is pleased when she hears this. Archie chats up Audrey Roberts (Sue Nicholls) at the bar, making Blanche jealous but Archie wants Audrey to make dead people look their best but she refuses. After Archie flatters Audrey about her hairdressing skills, she caves in and agrees to see to Archie's clients' hair. Audrey does her first dead person's hair on Edwina Levy, Archie's former hairdresser, and finds it very rewarding. Archie compliments Audrey on her hairdressing skills in The Rovers, unaware that Ken's son Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne) is watching. He winds Blanche up about Archie's \\"other woman\\" and when Blanche sees Audrey getting into Archie's car, she accuses Archie of two- timing her. Archie says he was just giving Audrey a lift. Archie tells Audrey he doesn't like lying but Audrey is adamant she doesn't want her customers to know that she's now \\"beautician to the dead\\". When Blanche sees them together, she accuses Archie of being dishonest and throws a glass of water over him so he tells her that Audrey is working for him. He asks Blanche not to tell anyone as Audrey is worried that it would be bad for business. Blanche forgives him. Blanche overhears Maxine Peacock (Tracy Shaw) and Maria Sutherland (Samia Ghadie) in The Rovers gossiping about Audrey and Archie disappearing together. She explains that Audrey works for Archie and asks them not to say anything as it's a secret. Norris overhears. Audrey is furious when she realises everybody knows that she is working for Archie, telling Archie that she thought she could trust him. Archie is very upset with Blanche and tells her their relationship is over. Blanche is devastated. Blanche tells Deirdre that Archie has finished with her and sobs her heart out. Audrey realises that her working for Archie hasn't affected her business. Deirdre tells Archie how upset Blanche is but he won't change his mind. As Blanche rushes to take a phone call she thinks is from Archie she trips, falls down the stairs and bangs her head.

In September 2002, the factory do business with Dev's cousin, Naveen Alahan (Parvez Qadir), but problems arise when Naveen's cheques keep bouncing. Joe makes some calls and finds out that Naveen's business is about to go into receivership. Without Naveen's money, Underworld is in danger of going under so Joe and Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson), take a van to Naveen's warehouse and take Mike's stock back, which Steve is not happy about. They manage to retrieve the stock and flee after they trigger the security alarm. However, the robbery backfires when police go to the factory to do a routine enquiry. Mike is furious about Joe's reckless actions as he could be an accessory to the crime as he lied to the police about the missing stock. When Mike points out that there are no buyers to purchase the stock that Joe has retrieved, he cons Naveen by tricking him into buying the knicker order originally meant for him and makes him pay cash. Naveen is furious when he realizes what has happened. Dev tells Geena about Joe breaking into the warehouse. Geena confronts Joe and is shocked when he is angry with Dev for telling her.

Naive Geena reconciles with Joe, unaware that he is using her to get Dev to drop the charges. Dev agrees, on the condition that she ends the relationship with Joe, who suggests to Geena that they pretend that they have broken up and she should get back with Dev, attempting to consolidate the lie. However, Dev realizes what Geena is doing and throws her out. Joe gets increasingly worried about the police arresting him and puts it to Dev that if he drops the charges, he will dump Geena. Later on, Dev tells Geena about his deal with Joe and how he had already dropped the charges, telling her that it is up to her what she decides to do.

Although she initially turns him down, she eventually sleeps with him, after her marriage to Steve breaks down when he is unfaithful. Joe has a master plan that involves Karen. He explains to her that he intends to ruin Mike and take over the factory, asking her to help him to do it. When Joe tempts her with the lure of the possibility of a plush apartment, Karen agrees to the scam. Joe tells Karen that as his partner, she will have to get Mike to sign cheques to his bogus company, Artrec (an anagram of Carter). Instead, however, Karen forges Mike's signature, much to Joe's delight. Just after Mike has signed the final cheque to seal the deal for the couple, he suddenly announces that he is doing a full stock take, much to their horror. Joe and an ex-con friend, Frank Marsden (Martin Walsh), burgle the factory so that Mike will never know that no stock from Artrec was delivered. Joe then takes Mike to a deserted warehouse pretending that this is Artrec's address. They speak to a bogus security guard, Frank, who tells them that Artrec disappeared a few days ago. Frank describes the owner as an Asian man, which makes Mike think that Naveen Alahan is behind the con. With the factory in fiscal crisis and redundancies being made, Karen's guilty conscience gets the better of her and she tells Mike everything. Mike drags Joe into the office and lets him know that he's uncovered the whole scam. Karen overhears Joe telling Mike that the only reason he started a relationship with Karen was so that he could use her for forging cheques. Karen is hurt and angry. To Joe's horror, Karen gives Mike a list of every detail pertaining to Artrec that he requested and tells him that she's transferred all the money they stole from him back into his account. To avoid being a laughing stock in the rag trade, Mike agrees not to call the police but tells Joe he never wants to set eyes on him again. Joe and Karen row as Joe packs his things to leave. Karen wants to know if he ever loved her at all, to which Joe coldly replies that she had her uses, before leaving Weatherfield.

He made an uneasy peace with Tommy and Angela but Tommy still did not like Martin being with his daughter. In early 2005, Katy told Angela and Tommy that she was pregnant and they were not happy. In March, Tommy saw Martin and Sally Webster (Sally Dynevor) together and thought they were having an affair. He told Katy and when Angela overheard something, she too believed it and they told Katy. Katy did not believe them, knowing how he felt about Martin but when Angela believed it, she thought it could be true. Devastated, she left Martin and aborted their baby. Gail Platt (Helen Worth) told Angela that Sally had had an affair but not with Martin. Angela told Katy that Martin was not unfaithful, infuriating Katy. Katy visited Martin and told him she was sorry but he dumped her so Katy went to confront Tommy. Angry that he was not bothered and continued to insult Martin, Katy picked up a wrench he had been working with at the garage and hit him over the head, killing him. Angela Harris Angela Harris (also Appleyard and Nelson) was played by Kathryn Hunt. Angela and her husband Tommy (Thomas Craig) and their children Katy (Lucy-Jo Hudson) and Craig (Richard Fleeshman) first appeared on the street, having rented Number 6 and using the last name \\"Nelson\\". They came originally from Sheffield where Angela worked in a pub. She witnessed a murder and gave evidence against the accused. But the family of the accused took their revenge with threats and eventually tried to burn their house. The Harris's were taken under the Witness Protection program, given a new identity as the Nelson family and moved to Weatherfield. Angela got a job in Underworld but it did not go well. Her husband Tommy was under suspicion of stealing a wallet in the garage where he found work and the women in the factory turned against Angela too. Only Hayley Cropper (Julie Hesmondhalgh) made friends with Angela and eventually found out and kept the family's secret. In April 2003 however, Katy slipped away to see her friends in Sheffield and was followed by the brothers of the man who was jailed on Angela's evidence. There was a showdown and Tommy was shot in the process. The culprits were found and the family's secret was revealed. Angela was determined that she would not put her family through any more hiding and secrecy. The Harris's took their own name back and the residents came round to being more neighbourly again. Near the end of 2003, Tommy and Angela split up. Katy took up with Martin Platt (Sean Wilson) and though disapproving, Angela could not bear to be estranged from her daughter. She and Tommy fell out over the situation and split up for a while. They made up but it was an uneasy peace. In 2005, Angela discovered that Katy was pregnant. Not thrilled, she nonetheless supported her daughter. Tommy thought Martin was having an affair with Sally Webster (Sally Dynevor), who was actually having an affair with Ian Davenport, and because circumstantial evidence seemed to support it, Angela believed it and took Katy in when she came running home. She also supported and encouraged Katy's decision to have an abortion, but was mortified to find out Martin really was faithful and Katy had had the abortion for nothing. Shortly after, Katy and Tommy rowed furiously in the garage and Katy struck and killed her father. Angela was horrified and she decided to cover up the crime and make it look like a robbery. Later she herself confessed to the murder in order to protect Katy and was remanded in prison. Even though Katy herself confessed before committing suicide, Angela was still guilty of perverting the course of justice and imprisoned for four years, though since the end of her sentence passed in 2009, Angela has not been heard of or seen since. Katy Harris Katherine Jane \\"Katy\\" Harris (previously Nelson) was played by Lucy-Jo Hudson. When Tommy (Thomas Craig), Angela (Kathryn Hunt), Katy and Craig Harris (Richard Fleeshman), arrived in November 2002 they were credited under the surname \\"Nelson\\" instead of \\"Harris\\". They were first credited as \\"Harris\\" from 16 May 2003 until 2005. She is introduced as Katy Nelson, the oldest child and only daughter of Tommy and Angela Nelson when they move into No. 6, Coronation Street. The family had secretly been placed under a witness protection programme, as Angela was due to testify in a gangland murder trial. When the brothers of the defendant come to Weatherfield in order to kill the Harrises, this become common knowledge and the family resume using the surname Harris. Katy discovers that she is diabetic, and nurse Martin Platt (Sean Wilson) helps her to get used to giving herself daily injections of insulin. The pair develop a romantic relationship, even though Martin was nearly 20 years older than Katy, almost as old as her father. Katy becomes pregnant, but her father, Tommy, persuades her to have an abortion by fabricating a story that Martin was having an affair. Tommy hated Martin for sleeping with his daughter, branding him a 'pervert.' When Katy finds out that Tommy lied about the affair, she confronts him at the garage, but he shows her no sympathy or remorse. On the spur of the moment, she lashes out and hits him over the head with a wrench, killing him. Katy's mother Angela witnesses the murder but persuades her not to call the police. They then go through a pretence that Tommy had been killed by an intruder, until forensic evidence leads to Angela's arrest. After a few weeks, Katy decides she cannot live with the guilt any longer and writes a note confessing the truth about her father's death before committing suicide by drinking water mixed with sugar (a deadly solution, because of her diabetes). Martin later finds her lying unconscious on the sofa with the note beside her. She is later taken to hospital, but dies two weeks later. Craig Harris Craig Alexander Harris (previously Nelson), was played by Richard Fleeshman. In real life, Fleeshman's parents David Fleeshman and Sue Jenkins had also starred in Coronation Street; Sue played Gloria Todd and David played Mr. Austin. ITV announced in early June 2006 that Richard Fleeshman would be leaving the soap in the autumn of 2006. It was his decision to quit the role of Craig Harris in order to pursue a pop career. Fleeshman filmed his final scenes in late August 2006 and his final episode aired on 16 October 2006. Craig is the son of Angela (Kathryn Hunt) and Tommy Harris (Thomas Craig). He enters the series in November 2002 as Craig Nelson, under the witness protection programme. His mother Angela has witnessed a murder in their home city of Sheffield and the family move away to Weatherfield. He later uses his real surname Harris once the family's cover is blown and they decide to stay in Weatherfield. Soon, Craig befriends David Platt (Jack P. Shepherd), Rosie Webster (Helen Flanagan) and Bradley Diggins. The quartet begin causing trouble for Norris Cole (Malcolm Hebden) and Rita Sullivan (Barbara Knox) by banging their football against their garage doors. Eventually, they begin making threats when Norris and Rita confiscate their ball, leading to Norris stabbing the ball with scissors. This was all resolved when Tommy took the money off Norris for damages and the quartet went back to school. When his sister Katy Harris (Lucy-Jo Hudson) starts dating David's father Martin Platt (Sean Wilson), her father's friend, who is 20 years older than she is, it causes Tommy and Angela to split up. Upset at this, Craig tampers with the brakes on Martin's car, hoping to split Martin and Katy up and bring back peace to his family. Unfortunately, Katy gets in the car with Martin. Craig tells his father and they race to the rescue. Martin decides not to press charges once he finds out the truth. Soon, David and Craig fight after having an argument over the incident. Tommy and Angela get back together when they realise how much their problems are affecting Craig. Craig starts dating Rosie in spring 2004, and this infuriates Rosie's mother Sally Webster (Sally Dynevor) as she is trying to get Rosie to be a star. Sally begins getting in the way of them both but this fails. In early 2005, the pair become goths, pushing Sally and Rosie's father Kevin Webster (Michael Le Vell) to breaking point. They decide to sleep together, but at the last minute decide that it would be best not to. However, Tommy finds a condom Craig has been planning to use and, thinking his son has slept with Rosie, punches him in the face and knocks him out. Soon, Tommy finds out Rosie stole the condom from Sally and confronts the pair, but soon everything is put right and Craig and Rosie carry on seeing each other. Despite this, Craig is devastated when his father is killed in March 2005, after sustaining a blow to the head with a wrench. He discovers that Katy committed manslaughter after discovering Tommy had lied to her over Martin having an affair, which caused her to abort her and Martin's child. Katy confronted Tommy and he infuriated her so much that she grabbed a wrench and hit him with it. Angela takes the blame for the kill, despite seeing what Katy has done and is sent to prison. A guilty Katy, also a diabetic, swallows a deadly solution of water and sugar and dies two weeks later. All of this caused Craig to lose his family in a month, and he soon split up with Rosie after seeing how ungrateful she is to have family around. Craig then lives with grandfather Keith Appleyard (Ian Redford), who, having decided that Craig has suffered enough problems, chooses to move to Weatherfield rather than taking Craig back to Sheffield. Craig and Rosie reunite, and he earns a part-time job at Dev Alahan's (Jimmi Harkishin) corner shop. Soon, the pair decide to have sex and sleep together despite being underage and Keith and his girlfriend Audrey Roberts (Sue Nicholls) catch Rosie trying to sneak out of the house the morning afterward. Later, Rosie and Audrey talk and Audrey decides to let the matter go, on the condition they never sleep together again. However, Craig and Rosie don't listen and they sleep together again on New Year's Eve 2005. Sally goes round to wish the pair happy New Year, but Craig answers the door in a dressing gown, thinking it was a pizza delivery. After seeing Rosie's dress lying on the sofa, Sally goes upstairs to find a naked Rosie in Craig's bed, leading her to drag Rosie back home and banish her upstairs. The pair are banned from seeing each other, despite their protests, and are put through hell when Rosie's parents get the police involved in the incident. The police refuse to take action, and soon Rosie decides to go on a school trip to prove nothing can stop their relationship. After a while, Craig is unfaithful to Rosie by seeing friend Suzy Watkins. Rosie's sister Sophie Webster (Brooke Vincent) finds out and tells Rosie, who splits up with Craig. They get back together hours later. Weeks later, Sally intends to get Rosie into a private boarding school. When she sees Rosie and Craig kissing, Sally kidnaps her daughter, leaving Craig worried. He tells Kevin about it, and eventually catches up with Sally and Rosie and brings them back safely. After Rosie is run over by a car a month later, Sally and Kevin warm towards Craig after seeing how devoted he is to Rosie, and Kevin offers Craig an apprenticeship at his garage (incidentally, this is where Craig's father Tommy worked and was murdered). In early summer, Craig is devastated when Keith has an angina attack, and even more upset when builder Charlie Stubbs (Bill Ward) is evicting them from their house. Keith says they have no choice but to move away somewhere new for a fresh start, and Craig tells Sally and Sophie about it. Soon, Craig starts hiding in his old house, but is quickly caught out when Charlie's girlfriend Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford) notices strange going-ons in the house. After learning that Rosie is going away on a school trip and that he wouldn't get to see her, Craig decides to tell Rosie about him leaving Weatherfield for a fresh start. Rosie is angered that her mother and sister knew about it all along, and after seeing how upset she is, Craig decides to stay with the Websters' and bids Keith a farewell. Rosie returns in August, and they begin living in a squat, much to the disgust of Sally and Kevin. Eventually, Craig lives with Hayley (Julie Hesmondhalgh) and Roy Cropper (David Neilson), but Craig doesn't really bond with them. Weeks later, Craig and Rosie hatch a plan to run away to Berlin together, to start a new life. The pair decide that Websters' family holiday is the perfect opportunity. Before they leave for the holiday, Craig sees best friend David one last time and bids him farewell. When the Websters' and Craig arrive in Paris, Craig and Rosie enjoy their last day together with the family and later slip away to pack their bags. Rosie leaves a note to her family saying she is sorry for everything. The Websters search frantically for her as Craig and Rosie are about to board the train. However, Rosie looks at a photo of her family and freezes. She tells Craig that she cannot leave her family behind. After a long and tearful goodbye, Craig vows to Rosie that he will always love her and tears himself away from Paris, Weatherfield and a devastated Rosie. It was revealed by Rosie a week later that Craig began work at a hostel with his friend in Berlin. Patrick Tussel Patrick Tussel is played by actor and football coach Trevor Dwyer-Lynch. Patrick is a cab driver for local taxi firm \\"Streetcars\\", and friend of Eileen Grimshaw (Sue Cleaver) from when they were in a group in which Eileen was singer. Patrick frequently serves as a comic foil for Les Battersby (Bruce Jones) and boss Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson). Patrick makes his final appearance in January 2005, while on crutches after an off-screen incident where his own car ran him over due to the handbrake being left off. John Arnley John Arnley, played by Paul Warriner, made his first screen appearance on 15 December 2002. The character and casting was announced on 19 November 2002. Warriner previously appeared in Coronation Street as Ben Williams in 1990. Of his role, a spokesperson commented \\"Paul's role will really start off with a bang, and then a few twists.\\" John began \\"a passionate affair\\" with his student Toyah Battersby (Georgia Taylor), but when she took him home to meet her flatmates, John set his sights on Maria Sutherland (Samia Ghadie). Maria initially rejected John's advances, but a love triangle soon developed, which prompted Toyah to decide to leave the Street. John is Toyah Battersby's tutor at Granston Technical College. Toyah begins a relationship with John, but is reluctant to introduce him to her flatmates Fiz Brown (Jennie McAlpine) and Maria Sutherland. Toyah invites John to The Rovers Return Inn to meet Fiz and Maria and they are surprised to see that he is considerably older than Toyah. John takes Toyah to Bordeaux for a holiday and they become closer. However, John become attracted to Maria. Knowing that Fiz and Toyah are out, John calls at their flat and he and Maria have sex. Fiz catches them and insists that Maria tells Toyah. John makes it clear to Fiz that she will not reveal what happened as she would not want to hurt Toyah. He continues to make advances towards Maria, but she rejects him. A few weeks later, Maria discovers that she is pregnant. When John finds out, he implies that Maria is promiscuous, which earns him a slap, and then offers to pay for an abortion. John tells Toyah that he feels her flatmates do not like him and suggests they move in together, which Toyah agrees to. While Toyah is berating Fiz for not liking John and not being supportive towards Maria, Fiz reveals the truth about their affair. Toyah confronts Maria, who gives her impression that John forced himself on her. Because she was once raped herself, Toyah interrupts John's tutor groups and attacks him. John calms her down and Toyah breaks up with him. A Daily Record reporter branded John \\"a new Weatherfield hunk\\", while a writer for the Huddersfield Daily Examiner called him \\"a love-rat lecturer\\".

The pepperoni roll bears a resemblance to the pasty and sausage roll, which originated in the mining communities of Great Britain, as well as to the Italian calzone.

It was discovered by Edward Drinker Cope in 1868 in a sample of phosphate sediments mined in an unknown cave (possibly Cavannagh Cave) in Anguilla and sent to Philadelphia to estimate the value of the sediments. It is the sole species of the genus Amblyrhiza in the fossil family Heptaxodontidae. Some authors have suggested that its extinction may have resulted from overhunting by pre-Columbian humans.\\"Late Quaternary vertebrate faunas of the Lesser Antilles: historical components of Caribbean biogeography\\", 1994, Bulletin of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History. Pregill, G. K., D. W. Steadman, and D. R. Watters. However, it is unknown whether this species was contemporaneous with human populations.

McFarlane, J. Lundberg & G. Maincent no bone has been recovered yet from a pre-Columbian archaeological site. Despite being described as a \\"giant hutia\\", it has recently been recovered as a member of the Chinchilloidea.  Description  Paleontologist A. R. Biknevicius and his team have estimated body size for Amblyrhiza inundata based upon 5 femora and 9 humeri from adult Amblyrhiza remains. They concluded based upon these specimens that Amblyrhiza ranged from just under 50 kg in mass to over 200 kg in mass. These calculations were based on comparisons with extant caviomorphs of 16 different species. The blunt teeth of Amblyrhiza inundata suggest an herbivorous lifestyle, consistent with that of the other genera within Heptaxodontidae.  Taxonomy  Known colloquially as the ‚ÄúBlunt Toothed Hutia,‚Äù this animal's scientific name reflects a similar narrative. ‚ÄúAmblyrhiza‚Äù roughly translates to ‚Äúblunt root,‚Äù and ‚Äúinundata‚Äù has been speculated to be in reference to Cope's disbelief that such a large rodent could evolve in an isolated region such as the islands of the northern Lesser Antilles. It is now accepted that Cope thought that the animal was cosmopolitan in nature, moving freely from island to island due to the lowered sea levels of the interval, which enabled Amblyrhiza to develop such an impressive body size. Amblyrhiza is currently considered to be a close relative of Elasmodontomys obliquus, a smaller yet similar rodent found in the Quaternary deposits of Puerto Rico. Although it has yet to be decided exactly where Amblyrhiza fits in a phylogenetic context, it is thought that they belong to a paraphyletic group of giant caviomorphs known as Heptaxodontidae. More recent work finds Amblyrhiza and Elasmodontomys to be members of the Chinchilloidea, with Amblyrhiza being most closely related to Dinomys.  Discovery  Paleontology work began in the northeastern area of the Caribbean in the mid nineteenth century, when phosphate mining boomed in the region and fossils were coincidentally found in associated strata. Later, in 1868, samples of fossils and their overlying sediments were sent from the islands to the Philadelphia Academy of Sciences to estimate the potential scientific value of said specimens. These fossils were then given to famed paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope, who was serving as the academy's secretary at that time. Cope is said to have taken particular interest in them and their notably large size. The fossilized remains of this remarkably large rodent are found solely within Quaternary cave deposits, all of which are located on the islands of the northern Lesser Antilles, specifically Anguilla and St. Martin.

Petty won his record 200th NASCAR victory on July 4, 1984 at the Firecracker 400, with Reagan in attendance. NASCAR lore has developed since the sport's founding in 1947. It includes NASCAR's colorful history of races along with the drivers and machines that have competed in them. Through the efforts of sportswriters and television, some events have become embedded within the sport and instantly recognizable throughout the years. Some races are made famous by a dramatic last-lap battle for the win, while others are notable for special achievements, historical significance, or controversy. Races 1950s *Photo Finish ‚Äì Inaugural Daytona 500 (February 22, 1959) *:The first major milestone in NASCAR history saw the series move from the Beach Course to the new high-banked Daytona International Speedway. Nearing the finish, Johnny Beauchamp and Lee Petty battled for the lead. The two cars crossed the finish line side-by-side for a photo finish. Officials deemed Johnny Beauchamp the unofficial winner, and he drove to victory lane. The results, however, were protested. After examining photographs and newsreel film for three days, Lee Petty was declared the official winner. The controversy kept the race in the news for several days. 1960s *10-race win streak - 1967 Wilkes 400 (October 1, 1967) *:Richard Petty beat Dick Hutcherson by two laps at North Wilkesboro, to win his milestone 75th NASCAR Grand National Series race, and his record 10th consecutive victory. The race was also his record 27th race win of the 1967 season. Petty's consecutive race win streak (10), single-season win total (27), and career victories (200) are all NASCAR records that still stand as of 2020. Petty's ten-race win streak lasted from August 12-October 1, and included the following races: Winston-Salem, Columbia, Savannah, Darlington, Hickory, Richmond, Beltsville, Hillsboro, Martinsville, North Wilkesboro. 1970s *1974 Firecracker 400 ‚Äì (July 4, 1974) *:Coming to take the white flag, leader David Pearson realizes he is a sitting duck with Richard Petty riding second and ready to slingshot into the lead. As he crosses the start- finish line, Pearson suddenly pulls onto the apron as if he has a blown engine. Richard Petty sweeps into the lead, but suddenly realizes that Pearson is back up to speed and running on his back bumper. Off of turn four, Pearson himself slingshots past Petty into the lead for the win. *Pearson Gets His1976 Daytona 500: Pearson gets his at AutoRacingSport.com ‚Äì 1976 Daytona 500 (February 15, 1976) *:After years of misfortune, David Pearson finally won the Daytona 500 in spectacular fashion. On the final lap, Richard Petty led Pearson down the backstretch. Pearson attempted a sling-shot pass, and took the lead into turn three. Petty picked up the draft, and returned the favor in turn 4 to take the lead back. Exiting turn four, the two cars touched, and spun out of control. Both cars slammed into the outside wall, and Pearson spun into the tri-oval infield. Petty continued sliding towards the finish line, and appeared as if he would cross the line spinning backwards. The car hit a grassy rut, and slid to a stop 50 yards short of the finish line. Pearson refired his wrecked car, and headed for the finish line. Petty's car was stalled, and Pearson idled by to win the race. It is often regarded as the greatest finish in Daytona 500 history.Howstuffworks \\"No. 1: The 1976 Daytona 500\\" *The Fight2009 Daytona 500 telecast ‚Äì Fox-TV, February 15, 2009 ‚Äì 1979 Daytona 500 (February 18, 1979) *:For the first time in its history, CBS televised the race live flag-to-flag on national television. A major snowstorm, known as the Presidents Day Snowstorm of 1979, bogged down most of the Northeast and parts of the Midwest, increasing the viewership of the event. Donnie Allison was leading the race on the final lap with Cale Yarborough drafting him tightly. Yarborough attempted a slingshot pass at the end of the backstretch, and Allison attempted to block. With both drivers refusing to give, the cars banged together three times until crashing into the outside wall in turn 3. Third place Richard Petty, running a half a lap behind, sailed by to take the victory. Just before CBS' cameras picked up Petty, they prematurely followed Buddy Arrington (who was driving a borrowed year-old Petty car) across the line. The cameras then found Petty and Waltrip, who were just coming off of turn 2, and followed them to the checkered flag. Donnie Allison and Yarborough climbed out of their cars and began to argue. Bobby Allison stopped at the scene, and a fight broke out on national television. The story made the front page of The New York Times. It is largely considered the point at which NASCAR arrived as a popular national sport. *1979 CRC Chemicals Rebel 500 ‚Äì (April 8, 1979) *:Darrell Waltrip and Richard Petty engaged in a ferocious final five laps; Petty took the lead following a late restart, then on Lap 365 Waltrip stormed past in Turn One (the narrow end of the oval; track was flipped in 1997); Petty retook the lead in Turn Three (wide end of the oval) and Waltrip dove back underneath, but Petty fought him off on the backstretch of Lap 366. On the final lap Waltrip took the lead in One again, Petty again crossed back underneath, but in Three slid high and Waltrip stormed ahead with Donnie Allison shooting the gap to second before Petty fought him off. The win was Waltrip's second of the 1979 season. David Pearson's final race with the Wood Brothers came here after an embarrassing pit road mishap. 1980s *Petty's 200th ‚Äì Pepsi Firecracker 400 (July 4, 1984) *:On Independence Day, seven-time NASCAR champion Richard Petty won his record 200th career Grand National/Winston Cup Series victory in exciting fashion. Battling Cale Yarborough most of the race, the two were running 1st‚Äì2nd in the closing laps. With President Ronald Reagan in attendance, Petty led with three laps to go. Doug Heveron crashed in turn one, and the caution flag came out. The two cars raced back to the caution (which was allowed at the time), and Petty edged out Yarborough to lead at the stripe by a few feet. The field circulated around the track under caution for the final two laps, and Petty secured his record 200th victory. *Million Dollar Bill ‚Äì Bill Elliott wins the Winston Million (September 1, 1985) *:Bill Elliott won the 1985 Daytona 500 in dominating fashion. In May at the Winston 500, Elliott was in contention, but was forced to the pits to repair a broken oil fitting and he lost two laps. Elliott proceeded to make the laps up under green, and took the victory. At Darlington, Elliott capped off the tremendous effort with victory in the Southern 500. The win clinched him the first-ever Winston Million, a cash bonus for a driver who could win a \\"small slam\\" (three out of the four races that comprise NASCAR's Grand Slam.) The victory thrust him into notoriety, and he appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated. *1986 Miller High Life 400 ‚Äì (February 23, 1986) *:Rivals Darrell Waltrip and Dale Earnhardt battled for the win on the half-mile short track for the better part of the race. In the final five laps, Waltrip rode on the back bumper of Earnhardt, bumping and rubbing the whole way. Waltrip finally snuck underneath exiting turn two with three laps to go. Going into turn 3, Earnhardt spun Waltrip out, but lost control himself and both cars crashed hard. The wreck collected Joe Ruttman (3rd place) and Geoff Bodine (4th place), allowing 5th place Kyle Petty to slip by and take his first-career Cup victory. The incident drew a fine for Earnhardt, raised tempers throughout the garage area, and gave Earnhardt the \\"Ironhead\\" nickname. The incident was dramatized in the movie 3. *The Pass in the Grass ‚Äì 1987 The Winston (May 17, 1987) *:After two mostly uneventful runnings, in 1987, a new format was introduced for NASCAR's all-star event, The Winston at Charlotte Motor Speedway. (Following the new numbering format used by the race in 2008, this race is retroactively now known \\"Sprint All-Star Race III\\".) Two segments ‚Äì 75 and 50 laps, respectively ‚Äì were concluded with a 10-lap \\"trophy dash\\" sprint to the finish. With 7 laps to go, Dale Earnhardt led Bill Elliott in turn four. Towards the quad-oval, Elliott pushed his nose underneath Earnhardt, attempting to take the lead. Earnhardt swiped the car over to block, but slid into the infield grass. He was able to maintain control, veered back onto the track, back in front of Elliott, and held onto the lead. Earnhardt muscled his way around the track over the final six laps, and won. The event has since been one of the most popular events on the calendar. Kulwicki driving his first \\"Polish Victory Lap\\". *The Polish Victory Lap ‚Äì 1988 Checker 500 (November 6, 1988) *:Regarded by fans a true \\"underdog\\", independent owner/driver Alan Kulwicki won his first NASCAR Winston Cup race at Phoenix, the track's first Cup event. After he took the checkered flag, Kulwicki proceeded to turn his car around and make a clockwise (backwards) victory lap, much to the delight of fans. By driving in the opposite direction, Kulwicki was able to lower his window net, and wave directly to the fans. Kulwicki called it a \\"Polish victory lap,\\" (Kulwicki was of Polish descent). Kulwicki, who had done it previously in lower rungs of racing, would repeat the gesture after winning the 1992 championship (see 1992 Hooters 500 below). Following his death in 1993, several drivers adopted the celebration to honor Kulwicki's memory. 1990s *Kyle Petty wins the Unocal Challenge ‚Äî 1990 Goodwrench 500 (March 4, 1990) *:At the third race of the 1990 season, no driver had won a race from pole position for an entire season (29 races), which meant the $7,600 prize, which accumulates for every unsuccessful attempt or rainout, had reached $228,400. Kyle Petty finally broke the streak and clinched the bonus. He led 433 of 492 laps, and collected $228,400 in bonus money, for a total purse of $284,450, a single-race NASCAR record at the time. It would be the highest single cash prize awarded during the tenure of the Unocal Challenge award program. Car owner Felix Sabates presented Petty with a Rolls Royce as a gift for winning the elusive bonus. *One Hot Night ‚Äì 1992 The Winston (May 16, 1992) *:Lights were installed at Charlotte Motor Speedway, and it became the first non-short track to host night racing. The first race held under-the-lights was The Winston \\"all star\\" race. During the final 10-lap sprint, Dale Earnhardt led Kyle Petty and Davey Allison. On the final lap, Petty nudged Earnhardt in turn three, spinning him out. Petty took the lead into turn four, but as he entered the qual-oval, Davey Allison pulled alongside. The two cars touched as they crossed the finish line, with Allison edging out Petty by less than half a car length. The two cars clipped, and Allison crashed hard into the outside wall, showering bright sparks over the track. Allison spent the night in the hospital instead of victory lane. *1992 Hooters 500 (November 15, 1992) *:In what is considered the greatest NASCAR race of all-time, several sidebar stories complemented the closest championship chase in NASCAR history up to that point. The race served as Richard Petty's final career race, and the first start for future champion Jeff Gordon. Six drivers entered the race with a mathematical chance to win the title, the most in history. As the laps dwindled down the race, and the championship, became a two-man battle between Alan Kulwicki and Bill Elliott. Kulwicki, known to be an intelligent and calculating driver, was facing his final fuel stop. He stayed out while leading one lap extra than his pit crew requested, allowing him to lead a total of 103 laps during the race. Elliott led the rest of the way, and won the race, while Kulwicki finished second. Elliott's total laps led, however was only 102, and Kulwicki received the 5 bonus points for leading the most laps, and clinched the championship. *1998 Daytona 500 ‚Äì February 15, 1998 *:After 19 years of misfortune, bad luck, heartbreak, and after several second-place finishes, Dale Earnhardt finally won the Daytona 500 in his 20th attempt. Earnhardt had won seven Winston Cup championships, over 70 Cup races, and 32 other races at Daytona International Speedway, but had never won NASCAR's crown jewel. Up front most of the race, Earnhardt dominated the final 60 laps, and clinched victory one lap early when a caution came out on the final lap. Earnhardt was greeted on pit road by nearly the entire NASCAR brethren, then veered into the infield tri-oval grass to do a burnout. The tire marks in the grass eerily resembled his famous #3. Earnhardt secretly glued a \\"lucky\\" penny on his dashboard. Wessa Miller, a six-year girl with spina bifida, gave the penny to Earnhardt before the race, and he cherished the gift from the young fan, and she became known as the \\"Lucky Penny Girl.\\" It allowed Earnhardt to become the fifth driver to clinch NASCAR's distinguished Career Grand Slam. 2000s Dale Earnhardt (#3) suffers a fatal accident at the Daytona 500. *Black SundayOrlando Sentinel, February 19, 2001 ‚Äì 2001 Daytona 500 (February 18, 2001) *:On the final lap of the Daytona 500, DEI teammates Michael Waltrip and Dale Earnhardt, Jr. ran 1st‚Äì2nd. Dale Earnhardt was in third place, effectively blocking for his drivers ahead. Going into turn 4, the elder Earnhardt lost control of his car and collected Ken Schrader in a head-on collision with the wall. The seven- time champion was killed instantly by a basilar skull fracture. The death of Earnhardt was the darkest day in NASCAR, and ushered in a new era of safety in the series. Earlier in the day the race was also marred by a 20-car crash on lap 173 which saw Tony Stewart flip down the backstretch. *2001 Cracker Barrel Old Country Store 500 (March 11, 2001) *:After the shocking death of Dale Earnhardt, Richard Childress Racing had to move quickly, but respectfully, to fill the vacated seat. Childress filled the empty seat with rookie Kevin Harvick, a Busch Series driver he had planned to develop over the next couple of seasons. Dale Earnhardt's famous black #3 car was repainted white, and the number was changed to #29 (a number of little significance, as it was simply the lowest number unused at the time). After strong finishes of 14th at Rockingham and 8th at Las Vegas, Harvick entered his third-career race at Atlanta. With five laps to go, Harvick took the lead, but was being chased down by Jeff Gordon. As the two cars came out of turn four, Gordon pulled alongside, but Harvick held him off by 0.006 seconds, the second-closest finish in NASCAR history at that time. Harvick performed a burnout on the frontstretch, holding up three fingers in remembrance of Earnhardt's famous #3. *2001 Pepsi 400 (July 7, 2001) *:Less than five months after Dale Earnhardt's death in the Daytona 500, NASCAR returned to Daytona International Speedway. Much to the delight of the crowd, Dale Earnhardt, Jr. dominated most of the event. After a late-race caution for a crash on lap 143, Earnhardt, Jr. charged from 7th place to first in less than a lap and a half, and took the lead with 5 laps to go. With teammate Michael Waltrip protecting the position in second place, Earnhardt, Jr. took the dramatic victory. An emotional post- race celebration saw Earnhardt, Jr. mimic his father's actions by spinning donuts in the tri-oval grass. Ironically, Earnhardt, Jr. and Waltrip finished in reverse order of the Daytona 500. Earnhardt, Jr. had Waltrip meet him in the tri-oval grass and they stood on top of Waltrip's car and embraced. Earnhardt, Jr later said this was as much Waltrip's celebration as his, due to the somber mood after Earnhardt, Sr. death at the Daytona 500. Ricky Craven (#32) edges out Kurt Busch (#97) at the finish line. *2003 Carolina Dodge Dealers 400 (March 18, 2003) *:Kurt Busch and Ricky Craven battled in one of the greatest last-lap finishes in NASCAR history. The two cars pounded each other relentlessly around Darlington Raceway for the entire final lap, and engaged side-by-side coming out of the final turn. Slamming fenders and turning into each other down the frontstretch, the two cars crossed the line together, with Craven taking the victory by 0.002 seconds. It was the closest finish in NASCAR history, since electronic scoring equipment had been introduced. The race is often credited with saving Darlington from being cut from the Cup Series schedule. *2004 Chase for the NEXTEL Cup ‚Äì 2004 Ford 400 (November 21, 2004) *:A new era in NASCAR commenced as the first Chase for the NEXTEL Cup came to its exciting conclusion. The new 10-race \\"playoff\\" system saw five drivers mathematically eligible for the championship in the final race, the Ford 400 at Homestead. Jimmie Johnson had won four of the past five races, and four-time champion Jeff Gordon was also in the hunt. Through consistency, Kurt Busch held an 18-point lead over Johnson in the championship standings, and Gordon was 3 points behind in third. A caution-filled event went down the final lap before the championship was decided. On lap 93, points leader Kurt Busch had a tire problem with the right rear, and was forced to the pits. Just as he was about to enter the pit area, the entire wheel flung off of the car, and rolled on the track. Busch swerved and just barely missed crashing into the pit divider wall. A caution flag came out, and it allowed Busch to stay on the lead lap. In the waning laps, Busch worked his way back up to 5th place, while his closest championship contenders, Johnson and Gordon were running 2nd‚Äì3rd. A green-white-checker finish saw Greg Biffle win the race. Kurt Busch held on to finish 5th, and clinched the championship by 8 points, the second closest margin in NASCAR history. 2010s *2011 Ford 400 (November 20, 2011) *:After a Chase for the Sprint Cup that was dominated by Carl Edwards and Tony Stewart, the two drivers entered the final race of the 2011 season separated by a mere 3 points. Despite falling to the back of the field twice early in the race, Stewart took the lead with 35 laps to go and held off a charging Edwards, who finished second. At the end of the day, the final points standings had both Stewart and Edwards with an identical 2,403 points, the first and only time in NASCAR history. Stewart was awarded the tiebreaker and the championship with 5 victories on the season to Edwards' 1. Remarkably, all 5 of Stewart's wins came during the 10-race Chase, while Carl's lone one came three races into the 2011 NASCAR Sprint Cup season at Las Vegas (the same race Matt Kenseth won in 2003 that led to the Chase's creation in the first place). *2015 Goody\`s Headache Relief Shot 500 (November 1, 2015) *:Jeff Gordon was coming towards the end of his farewell tour. Still in the Chase he had a chance to become the 1st driver since Ned Jarrett to finish his career as the Champion. For most of the race it was not Gordon, but Joey Logano who dominated. However, that all changed when Matt Kenseth (who had won the Championship in 2003) wrecked Joey Logano as revenge for Joey Logano wrecking him two weeks earlier. Immediately, the wreck put Gordon in the lead. Only behind for a few laps after that to Denny Hamlin (who chose not to pit) and A.J. Allmendinger, Gordon went on to retake the lead with 21 laps to go and win the race which locked him into the final 4. It was his last win  2020s  *2020 Daytona 500 (February 16-17 2020) In one of the most shocking and exciting finishes ever. Hamlin would win the 2nd closest Daytona 500 by 0.014 seconds over Ryan Blaney. However his third win was overshadowed by Ryan Newman's wreck at the end where he would spin upside down and would be hit on the driver's side by Corey LaJoie. Newman would suffer serious injuries in the accident, but would return to racing at the 2020 The Real Heroes 400 Honorable mention *\\"They're not changing tires!\\"1981 Daytona 500 telecast ‚Äì CBS, February 15, 1981 ‚Äì 1981 Daytona 500 (February 15, 1981) *:After over 40 lead changes, the race came down to the final series of pit stops. Bobby Allison's Pontiac LeMans was the class of the field, but Allison needed one more pit stop. After Allison took on tires and fuel, Dale Inman, crew chief for Richard Petty, called his driver to the pits. With 24 laps to go, the crew gambled and took on fuel only. They decided not to change tires, and Petty's blazing 6.8-second pit stop allowed him to re-enter the track and hold the lead. A startled Ned Jarrett, working as a pit reporter for CBS, proclaimed \\"They're not changing tires! A change of pace for the Petty crew!\\" Petty held off a shocked Allison by 4 seconds, and won his record 7th Daytona 500 crown. *1981 Talladega 500 ‚Äì (August 2, 1981) *:On the final lap, Darrell Waltrip leads Terry Labonte coming out of turn 4. As the cars go into the tri-oval, Labonte attempts a slingshot pass around the outside of Waltrip, but Waltrip is just able to hold him off. Suddenly, Ron Bouchard darted below both of them, and edged a shocked Waltrip by inches in a three-wide photo finish. It would be Bouchard's only career victory. After the race, Waltrip, who had thought Bouchard was a lap down, asked, \\"Where the hell did he come from?\\" *143 Lead Changes ‚Äì 1984 Winston 500 & 1984 Talladega 500 *:The most competitive pair of races in NASCAR history occurred at Talladega Superspeedway in 1984. At the Winston 500 on May 6, the race recorded a NASCAR record 75 official lead changes. That number only includes the leader of each lap at the start/finish line, and not any intermediate lead changes on other parts of the track, which were estimated at many more. Less than three months later, the Talladega 500 on July 29 nearly matched the record when it saw 68 official lead changes, the second-most in history. The record would hold for 26 years until it was broken in 2010 (88 total). *1990 Daytona 500 ‚Äì (February 18, 1990) *:Heavy favorite Dale Earnhardt, still searching for his elusive first Daytona 500 victory, dominated most of the race, leading 155 laps of the 200-lap race. Earnhardt was leading by over 40 seconds when a caution came out on lap 193, bunching the field. After the restart, Earnhardt re-took the lead, and led Derrike Cope and Terry Labonte. Going into the third turn on the final lap, Earnhardt ran over a bell housing from the blown engine of Rick Wilson's car. Earnhardt shredded the right rear tire, and Cope suddenly was handed the lead of the race. Cope held off Labonte in the final turn, and won his first- career NASCAR Winston Cup Series race in shocking fashion. It is largely considered one of the greatest upsets in NASCAR history. *Mr. September ‚Äì Harry Gant's win streak *:In September 1991, Harry Gant tied a modern era record, winning four consecutive Winston Cup races, and also won three consecutive Busch Series events, driving nearly undefeated for the month. As a preview, on August 31, Gant started on the pole for the Gatorade 200 at Darlington. A day later on September 1, Gant started out the month with a win in the Southern 500. The following week, Gant won both the Autolite 200 and Miller 400 at Richmond. A week later, Gant won both the SplitFire 200 and Peak 500 at Dover. Yet another week later, Gant continued the streak with, winning the Goody's 500 at Martinsville. On September 29, Gant started on the pole for the Tyson Holly Farms 400 at North Wilkesboro, looking for a 5th consecutive Winston Cup Series win, and 7th consecutive NASCAR-sanctioned event. Winning from the pole position would also make him eligible for a $144,400 bonus from the Unocal 76 Challenge. Gant dominated the race, but an O-ring failure saw Gant fall out of the lead with 12 laps to go, and he finished second. As an \\"encore,\\" Gant won the All Pro 300 at Charlotte, his third consecutive Busch Series win, finished 4th in the Winston Cup race at Charlotte a day later, then nearly won the AC Delco 500 at Rockingham - leading 260 of 492 laps - and coming home second. *Inaugural Brickyard 400 ‚Äì (August 6, 1994) *:After over two years of preparation, and decades of speculation, NASCAR held its first event at the world-famous Indianapolis Motor Speedway. A NASCAR-record crowd watched the Winston Cup regulars, and numerous one-off entries, compete for a then-record $3.2 million purse. The popular hometown hero Jeff Gordon from nearby Pittsboro, Indiana, won the race after his strongest competitors Geoff Bodine and Ernie Irvan fell by the wayside. The event thrust into one of the biggest races on the circuit, and elevated Gordon's young career. *The Iron Man Streak ‚Äì 1996 First Union 400 (April 15, 1996) *:Terry Labonte tied NASCAR's all-time consecutive starts record at the final spring race at North Wilkesboro Speedway. Driving an \\"iron grey\\" painted Kellogg's Monte Carlo, Labonte drove in his 513th straight race, tying the record set by Richard Petty. The streak was a culmination of seventeen years of racing, continued until 2000, and his record would stand until 2002 (see The Iron Man Streak II below). Two days after the race, Labonte was invited to Camden Yards to throw out the first pitch of an Orioles game, and meet baseball's ironman, Cal Ripken. Not only did Labonte take over the record, he won the race, and went on to win the 1996 Winston Cup Championship. *The Iron Man Streak II ‚Äì 2002 Coca-Cola Racing Family 600 (May 26, 2002) *:Ricky Rudd bested Terry Labonte's streak of 656 consecutive starts in the 2002 Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte. He drove a special grey \\"Iron\\" colored Texaco Havoline Ford Taurus that night. He would go on to start 788 consecutive races before his first retirement in 2005. *2000 Winston 500 (October 15, 2000) *:The fall race at Talladega would end up being Dale Earnhardt's 76th and final career victory. Earnhardt was shuffled deep in the field for the final restart on lap 174 (of 188) but began dramatically charging through the field. With 4 laps to go, he was scored 18th.ESPN Live Broadcast ‚Äì Score graphic What followed was beyond anybody's imagination. Earnhardt took a center groove in the field and fought his way back up front with such hustle, that after only 3 laps had concluded, he was perched atop the scoreboard, averaging 6 positions gained during his 3-lap comeback. He edged out Kenny Wallace for the victory, and won the Winston No Bull 5 Million as a result. Shortly after his stunning come-from-behind triumph, startled onlookers began to claim that Earnhardt had a God-granted ability to see the aerodynamic wind and decipher the best route through it. *Drag race all the way back to the S/F line ‚Äì 2007 Daytona 500 (February 18, 2007) *:In one of the most dramatic green-white-checker finishes, Kevin Harvick edged out Mark Martin by 0.020 seconds, the second-closest finish at Daytona. After 25 years of misfortune, veteran Mark Martin led the field with one lap to go, hoping for his elusive first Daytona 500 victory. Down the backstretch, Kyle Busch darted back and forth in an attempt to get by, but got loose. Kevin Harvick passed Busch in turn three, and closed in side-by-side with Martin. As the field exited turn 4, Busch spun, collecting several cars, and a huge crash ensued. Clint Bowyer flipped over, and slid down the track on his roof. The leaders battled to the finish line and Harvick beat Martin by a nose. In addition, it was the first Daytona 500 to finish in prime time. Controversial races *Jacksonville Raceway Park (December 1, 1963) *:African American driver Wendell Scott passes Buck Baker with 25 laps to go, and wins the 200-lap, 100-mile Grand National race by two laps. However, Baker is recognized as the winner, and celebrates in victory lane. Racial tensions of the time was blamed for the move, but it ultimately became a black eye for the sport. Hours after the race, NASCAR officials made scoring corrections and declared Scott the winner, but long after fans had left the track. Baker (2013) and Scott (2015) are both in the NASCAR Hall of Fame. *1973 National 500 ‚Äì (October 7, 1973) *:The first three cars to cross the finish line were Cale Yarborough, Richard Petty, and Bobby Allison, respectively. Allison protested that the engines in Yarborough car and Petty's car were oversized. NASCAR inspected all three of the top finishers, and Allison's engine passed inspection. The following day, NASCAR released a statement saying that, because the inspection facilities at Charlotte were inadequate, the pre-race inspection numbers would be used-when all three cars were legal. The results remained unchanged, potentially denying Allison of an 85th Cup Series victory, which would years later, break a tie (84 wins) with Darrell Waltrip for fourth place on the all-time list. *Bumpergate ‚Äì 1982 Daytona 500 (February 14, 1982) *:On lap 3, Bobby Allison was tapped slightly by Cale Yarborough, and his rear bumper fell off. The debris caused a crash, and took out three cars. Prior to the race, Allison's DiGard crew, led by Gary Nelson, had apparently discovered that the Buick Regal drove faster and handled better without the bumper assembly. On Saturday, Allison missed the final practice, as the team was supposedly repairing the rear of the car. It was claimed that the crew attached the bumper loosely, hoping it would fall off if he was touched by another car. Allison led 147 laps, and won by over 22 seconds. NASCAR issued no penalty. Allison and the crew deny the allegations. *1983 Miller High Life 500 (October 9, 1983) *:Richard Petty won his 198th career Winston Cup race, but failed post-race inspection. The car was found to have illegal tires, and an oversized engine. Petty was fined $35,000 (the win was worth $40,400) and 104 championship points (out of 180 earned). However, the victory was upheld. The incident created friction at the family's team, and Petty left Petty Enterprises at year's end. He took his STP sponsorship and his famous #43 with him, and drove for Mike Curb for the next two seasons. *The Tide Slide ‚Äì 1989 The Winston (May 21, 1989) *:During the final ten-lap sprint of The Winston all-star event, Darrell Waltrip led with young Rusty Wallace all over his rear bumper. Waltrip had the faster car, and held off numerous pass attempts by Wallace. As the two drivers came out of turn four to see the white flag, Wallace tagged Waltrip in the left rear quarter panel, sending Waltrip spinning out and into the grass. Wallace took the lead and ultimately took the $200,000 victory. Fans booed, gestured, and pelted the track with beer cans. In victory lane, when asked if he considered it \\"good, clean racing,\\" Wallace replied \\"I consider it The Winston.\\" As Wallace was being wheeled to victory lane, one of Wallace's crew members bumped into and knocked over a crew member from Waltrip's team, and a huge scuffle erupted. At least 25 people were involved in a huge fist-fight. After the race, Waltrip delivered his now- infamous line, \\"I just hope he chokes on that $200,000.\\" The incident was a turning point in both drivers' careers: the once hated Waltrip, who had just won the Daytona 500 earlier in the season, turned face, while many fans began to jeer the presence of the previously popular Wallace. *1989 Holly Farms 400 (October 15, 1989) *:A restart with three laps to go saw Dale Earnhardt leading Ricky Rudd and Geoff Bodine. Going into the race, Earnhardt was trailing Rusty Wallace by only 35 points in the championship standings, with only three races left in the season. On the final lap, Rudd pulled alongside Earnhardt, and they touched as they took the white flag. Earnhardt went high in turn 1, but the cars came together, and both Rudd and Earnhardt spun out. Geoff Bodine slipped by to steal the victory, and Earnhardt lost more ground in the points standings. In the pits, the pits crews scuffled, but it was quickly broken up. After the race, an angry Earnhardt said that Rudd \\"knocked the shit out\\" of him, and that NASCAR \\"ought to fine that son of a bitch.\\" The incident proved to be the deciding margin for the season, as Earnhardt lost the championship by only 12 points. (NASCAR did not fine obscene language with monetary fines or point penalties at the time.) *1990 Pontiac Excitement 400 (February 25, 1990) *:In the second race of the 1990 season, Mark Martin wins, but the car was found to have an illegal carburetor spacer. NASCAR found the spacer was 2¬Ω inches tall, a half-inch more than allowed. Martin kept the victory, but was fined $40,000 (at record at the time), and was docked 46 points. At season's end, Martin lost the championship by a mere 26 points to Dale Earnhardt, with the penalty representing the deciding margin. Later, it was admitted that the spacer plate was technically not illegal, and did not enhance the car's performance, but actually fell within a \\"gray area\\" of the rulebook. NASCAR competition director Dick Beaty even stated that \\"We don't know if [a taller spacer] is an advantage or not.\\" *The First \\"Big One\\" ‚Äì 1990 Pepsi 400 (July 7, 1990) *:Part-time Hendrick driver Greg Sacks won the pole position. But in post-qualifying inspection, NASCAR officials determined that the Hendrick team's engines had an unapproved \\"floating block\\" in the intake manifold sitting under the restrictor plate. NASCAR officials required the team to weld the block in place for race day, which effectively robbed the engine of horsepower. At the start, Sacks was a sitting duck, and at the conclusion of the first lap, his car was sent spinning in front of nearly the entire field. At least 22 cars were collected in a huge pileup in the tri- oval. The crash became known as the original \\"Big One.\\" Six cars in the lead pack narrowly escaped the incident, among those was Dale Earnhardt who dominated the depleted field on the way to victory. *1991 Banquet Frozen Foods 300 (June 9, 1991) *:A wild finish at Sonoma Raceway in California ends in controversy. Road course ringer Tommy Kendall (substituting for the injured Kyle Petty) is leading Mark Martin with 4 laps to go. Going into the circuit's Turn 7 keyhole, Martin slides by on the outside, but the cars make contact, and Martin spins out. Kendall suffers a cut tire, and limps back to the pits. Davey Allison who had been running third, took the lead. Allison led Ricky Rudd into the Turn 11 hairpin as the cars were anticipating seeing the white flag. Rudd's nose got inside, touched Allison's rear bumper, and Allison spun out with the white flag waving. The next time by, Rudd was displayed the black flag and penalized 5 seconds for dirty driving. Allison, the second car in line, was declared the winner. *Rattle His Cage ‚Äì 1999 Goody's Headache Powder 500 (August 28, 1999) *:In the closing laps of the popular Saturday night race at Bristol Motor Speedway, Dale Earnhardt led Terry Labonte and Jimmy Spencer. Labonte pulled alongside Earnhardt in turn four, and the two cars touched as they took the white flag for one lap to go. Going into turn 1, Labonte took the lead. In turn 2, Earnhardt tagged Labonte in the rear bumper, sending Labonte spinning down the backstretch. Earnhardt went on to win, and Spencer slipped by for second. Terry Labonte, however, collected six other cars and wrecked. When Earnhardt climbed out of the car in victory lane, many of the 170,000 fans booed and waved the finger. Defending his action, Earnhardt said in his victory lane interview, \\"(I) didn't mean really to turn him around, I meant to rattle his cage.\\" Earnhardt was widely criticized for the move, and others criticized NASCAR officials for not penalizing him. *2002 Pop Secret Microwave Popcorn 400 ‚Äì (November 3, 2002) *:With three races left in the 2002 NASCAR Winston Cup Series season, Tony Stewart led Mark Martin by 146 points. The series arrived at North Carolina Speedway, and Johnny Benson won his first and only Cup series race. Mark Martin finished second, while points leader Tony Stewart finished a distant 14th. Martin was poised to gain significant ground in the points standings, but his car failed post-race inspection due to an illegal left front spring. Martin was docked 25 championship points, and crew chief Ben Leslie was fined $5,000. Two weeks later, Stewart clinched the championship two weeks later at Homestead by a 38-point margin (more than the penalty difference). Martin's team appealed the penalty, and considered filing a lawsuit against the spring's manufacturer, claiming the spring was defective from the factory. According to NASCAR rules, springs were to have 4-1/2 coils, while Martin's had 4-3/8 coils. Prior to the 2014 rule change, the points leader with a comfortable lead would take a considerably conservative route, preferring survival over going for the win, taking fewer risks, and finishing just above what was necessary to keep the points lead, and win the championship.Losing Ground The appeal was denied, and for the second time in his career, Martin's chances at a title were derailed by a rules violation. *Racing back to the caution - 2003 Dodge/Save Mart 350. (June 22, 2003) *:On the 71st lap, Kevin Harvick was leading Robby Gordon when a caution came out for a crash at a different part of the track. Gordon kept charging (racing back to the caution), and passed Harvick in Turn 7, taking the position before they crossed the start/finish line. Harvick called it a \\"chicken move\\" and Jeff Gordon said \\"I could not believe it when I saw it\\" and called his passing under the yellow \\"unheard of.\\" The controversial pass, however, was entirely legal under NASCAR rules at the time, and Robby Gordon was assessed no penalty. The so-called \\"unethical breach of racing ethics\\" proved to be the winning edge, and Robby Gordon went on to win the race. He was subjected to considerable scrutiny and ridicule after the race for not adhering to the unwritten \\"gentleman's agreement\\" about not racing back to the yellow during normal parts of the race. However, others considered the complaints hypocrisy or \\"sour grapes\\" by the losers. Later in the year, racing back to the caution was banned from competition after a dangerous incident at the Sylvania 300. *Levigation- 2005 Coca-Cola 600 & 2005 UAW-GM Quality 500 *: Prior to the Coca-Cola 600 at Lowe's Motor Speedway, track president Humpy Wheeler spent $250,000 to grind out bumps that were well-known at the track in a process known as levigation. The intent was to smooth out the surface and create more side-by-side racing. The results were dismal, as the smooth surface put excessive stress the tires, leading to premature failures. The race saw a then NASCAR-record 22 caution periods (16 were for spins or crashes, stemming from the tire issues). When the series returned in the fall for the UAW-GM Quality 500, additional levigation to the track was done in an effort to correct the problems, but it only made the issues worse. A total of 15 cautions flew during the race, 13 of which were blamed on the tires and the surface. It was believed that 42 of the 43 teams faced tire issues on the night. Eventual champion Tony Stewart said after the race that he'd \\"have to renew my life insurance because I was afraid for my life out there\\" and Kevin Harvick said that the race \\"was the biggest embarrassment for this sport\\". Jimmie Johnson won both races with a close 0.027 second finish over Bobby Labonte and a medium margin over Kurt Busch. *2005 Sylvania 300 (September 18, 2005) *:The 2005 Chase begins at Loudon, and tempers flared. The tone of the afternoon was set early, as Scott Riggs tangled with playoff driver Kurt Busch on lap 3. Busch was sent to the garage for repairs and fell 66 laps down. Busch stormed Riggs' pit box, and had words with crew chief, Rodney Childers. On lap 166, Kyle Busch tangled with Kasey Kahne, who was sent hard into the wall. During the caution, Kahne maneuvered his wrecked car in front of Kyle Busch. Kahne was fined $25,000, docked 25 points, and was placed on probation for the remainder of the season. On lap 191, Michael Waltrip and Robby Gordon crashed. The next time by, Gordon attempted ram Waltrip's car with his wrecked machine, then threw his helmet at Waltrip's car. In the subsequent live interview on TNT, Gordon called Waltrip a \\"piece of shit.\\" Gordon was fined a total of $35,000, docked 50 points (25 for the helmet throw and 25 for violating NASCAR's rule on improper language and gestures imposed after Super Bowl XXXVIII, and was also placed on probation for the balance of the season. Waltrip was fined $10,000 and docked 25 points for using what seemed to be an obscene gesture, but after review of video on appeal, there was no obscene gesture and the penalty was overturned. Another unrelated penalty saw Brian Vickers fined $15,000 and docked 25 points for failing post-race inspection. The incidents shook up the Chase standings, and NASCAR officials increased the level of scrutiny in subsequent weeks. *2008 Brickyard 400 (July 27, 2008) *:The Car of Tomorrow is used for the first time at Indianapolis. The Goodyear tires suffered bad wear patterns, causing blowouts in some cases after only 8-10 laps of green-flag racing. After several blowouts and crashes early in the race, NASCAR mandated lengthy competition cautions at roughly 10-lap intervals for teams to change tires. The longest stretch of green flag racing all day was a mere 12 laps, effectively making the race, according to Dale Earnhardt, Jr., a series of heat races with a ten-lap feature at the end. Fans, competitors, and media were highly critical of the event, which was rendered largely uncompetitive. Jimmie Johnson survived the tire problems to win, after only a mild challenge at the end by Carl Edwards. Years later, the controversy is still blamed for a sharp decline in attendance for the event. *Spingate ‚Äì 2013 Federated Auto Parts 400 (September 7, 2013) *:In the final race before the 2013 Chase for the Sprint Cup, five spots were left to be filled in the 12-driver Chase field. Mathematically ten drivers entered the race still alive, but the attention eventually focused on Jeff Gordon, Joey Logano, Ryan Newman, and Martin Truex, Jr. In the closing laps, Newman led the race and appeared on his way to victory, and a certain berth in the Chase. With seven laps to go, Truex's Michael Waltrip Racing teammate Clint Bowyer spun out lazily near the start/finish line bringing out a caution, erupting a controversial sequence of events. In the shuffle, Newman dropped to 3rd at the checkered flag, and missed the Chase. The biggest beneficiary of the caution was Truex, who snagged the final Chase spot. The ESPN broadcast alleged that Bowyer spun out on purpose to bunch up the field and help Truex gain positions. Furthermore, MWR cars were allegedly called into the pits in order to intentionally lose positions, which had the effect of putting Penske Racing's Logano into the Chase ahead of Gordon. Two days later, NASCAR penalized all three MWR entries 50 championship points, for attempting to manipulate the results. The move effectively dropped Truex out of the Chase, and he was replaced by Newman. MWR was fined $300,000 and several members of the team were suspended or put on probation for remainder of the season, and effectively running the team out of business two years later. A couple days later, following a further investigation into Ford teams Team Penske and Front Row Motorsports uncovered the ensuing caution led to further manipulation by the Ford teams to leapfrog Logano ahead of Gordon, who drives for rival manufacturer Chevrolet's team Hendrick Motorsports, for the tenth and final spot in the Chase on points, NASCAR made an unprecedented ruling, deciding to add Gordon as a 13th Chase eligible driver. *2015 CampingWorld.com 500 at Talladega (October 25, 2015) *:After the followup from the Austin Dillon accident in the 2015 Coke Zero 400, NASCAR implemented a rule in which only one GWC finish would be used in this race to prevent any potential chaos from occurring in this race. After a relatively clean race in which the first 135 laps ran under green, Jamie McMurray blew an engine with 4 laps to go, setting up an attempt at a GWC finish. The race restarted with two laps to go at a scheduled Green-white-checker finish though a first attempt at a restart failed when Jimmie Johnson spun out after being tagged from behind by Kyle Larson. Despite this, NASCAR did not call this restart attempt official. On the second attempt (still technically the first), Kevin Harvick's car was unable to accelerate when the green flag was waived and collided with Trevor Bayne before the start line. A total of eleven cars were involved in the melee: Harvick (of whom many believe intentionally wrecked Bayne to preserve his spot in the next round of the NASCAR Chase for the Championship) Bayne, other chasers Denny Hamlin, Ryan Newman, and Matt Kenseth who saw their hopes for a title end (the previous season, Newman and Hamlin were in the Championship 4), Michael McDowell, Tony Stewart, David Gilliland, Danica Patrick, Sam Hornish Jr., Alex Bowman and Austin Dillon. Logano was ahead of Earnhardt when the caution came out upon further examining of the scoring loops and scored his sixth race of the season and first at Talladega, giving him a clean sweep of the Round of 12. During the burnout celebration, fans hurled debris including beer cans at Logano in a similar reaction to the 2004 Aaron's 499 in which Jeff Gordon barely squeezed out Earnhardt for the victory after Brian Vickers crashed with 5 to go, ending that race under caution. For 2016 and beyond, NASCAR implemented the \\"overtime\\" system in which a line halfway down the backstretch would indicate where an official restart would occur. *Traffic Jams ‚Äì 1997 Interstate Batteries 500 and 2011 Quaker State 400 (April 6, 1997 and July 9, 2011) *:On two occasions, a new race on the circuit has experienced problems with traffic jams and/or weather, creating angry fans and media, and significant controversy off the track. The 1997 Interstate Batteries 500 at Texas and the 2011 Quaker State 400 at Kentucky both suffered from first year logistical problems. Famous cars Herb Thomas' #92 Fabulous Hudson Hornet Petty's famous Roadrunner Superbird, on display at the Richard Petty Museum Melling Racing car that set the record for the fastest recorded time in a stock car ‚Äì 212.809 mph at Talladega Superspeedway Dale Earnhardt's black #3 in 1994 Jeff Gordon's #24 \\"Rainbow Warriors\\" car Ricky Rudd's Tide sponsored car *Fabulous Hudson Hornet *:In the early 1950, Marshall Teague dominated stock car racing in NASCAR and USAC winning 27 of 34 events driving the lightweight, monocoque machine. Herb Thomas switched to the car in 1951, and went on to win the championship. He then dominated the 1953 Grand National season in the car. *Aero Warriors *:In 1969, Ford introduced the Ford Torino Talladega to Grand National competition. The car featured a slick, aerodynamic fastback design. A year later, the Plymouth Superbird was Mopar's answer to the Torino. The Superbird featured a protruding nosecone, a massive rear wing, and was introduced also to lure Richard Petty back to Plymouth. *Bill Elliott's Melling Racing Ford Thunderbird *:For several seasons in the mid to late 1980s, Melling Racing led by Bill Elliott produced a stable of Ford Thunderbird machines that saw much domination at superspeedways. In 1985, Elliott piloted the car to 11 poles and 11 wins. Among the victories included a dominating win at the Daytona 500, the fastest-race to date at the Winston 500 at 186.288 mph, and the Southern 500, which clinched the Winston Million. Elliott set the all-time pole qualifying record at the Daytona 500 in 1987 at 210.364 mph, and the all-time NASCAR qualifying record later that year at Talladega at 212.809 mph. Elliott also set the summer race pole record at Talladega at 209.005 mph in 1986. From 1985 to 1988, Elliot's dominating Ford won 25 races, 29 poles, and the 1988 Winston Cup Championship. *Richard Petty's STP #43 *:From 1972 to 1992 (driver) and 1993 to 2000 (owner) the famous car #43 entered by Richard Petty donned the easily recognizable \\"Petty blue\\" and red colors of longtime sponsor STP. During the 1993 season, the car #44 was utilized, Petty's first season after retirement. After parting ways with STP in 2001, the familiar blue and red paint scheme, or variations of it, continued to be used on a regular basis, even with different sponsors. *Dale Earnhardt's #3 GM Goodwrench Chevrolet *:After carrying the yellow and blue colors of primary sponsor Wrangler during most of the 1980s, Dale Earnhardt and RCR switched to the full-time sponsorship of GM Goodwrench for the 1988 Winston Cup season. Earnhardt had been sponsored by GM Goodwrench for two part-time years in the Busch Series, and as an associate sponsor in Cup for several seasons. Earnhardt's trademark black #3 became a fixture on the circuit, and contributed to his \\"Intimidator\\" nickname. Following Earnhardt's death in 2001, Kevin Harvick took over the ride, but the number was changed to #29. In addition, for the first couple seasons, Harvick's version of the livery was had the colors reversed (white or silver with black lettering). In 2014, after Harvick left Childress, Austin Dillon (Childress' grandson) revived the #3. *Jeff Gordon's #24 DuPont Chevrolet *:Jeff Gordon's first career Winston Cup race was the season finale at Atlanta, and he the series full-time in 1993. From 1992 to 2010, Gordon's #24 Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet entry sported the colorful, popular, and widely recognizable DuPont paint scheme. From 1992 to 2000, the car was painted in the classic \\"Rainbow Warriors\\" scheme, and from 2001 to 2010, the paint jobs were updated to include a trendier design including flames, and various special paint jobs. Starting in 2011, DuPont's involvement was scaled back with the team, but still remained as a part-time/associate sponsor until DuPont sold the Performance Coatings to The Carlyle Group at the end of 2012, becoming Axalta Coating Systems; Gordon's last race with DuPont was at the Ford EcoBoost 400 at Homestead-Miami Speedway, which he won; it had been the only track with ten or more Cup starts that Gordon had not won. *The Tide Ride *:The Tide Ride is a nickname given to entries that have carried the sponsorship of the detergent brand Tide, a subsidiary of Procter & Gamble over the years. It is known for its three-tone orange, yellow and white paint scheme. Introduced in 1987 by Hendrick Motorsports, the most famous and most successful team was that of Darrell Waltrip, who won nine races including the 1989 Daytona 500 in the famous livery. Ricky Rudd also sported the livery during his tenure as the owner/driver of the #10 Ford in the then NASCAR Winston Cup Series, winning the 1997 Brickyard 400 among other races. Kevin Harvick and Matt Kenseth have in recent years carried the colors in Camping World Truck, Xfinity and Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series, with Harvick winning at Martinsville (#2 Chevrolet Silverado) and Richmond (#5 Chevrolet Camaro).

It is known only from the fossil remains of a single species, the huge and presumably flightless Eremopezus eocaenus. This was found in Upper Eocene Jebel Qatrani Formation deposits around the Qasr el Sagha escarpment, north of the Birket Qarun lake near Faiyum in Egypt. The rocks its fossils occur in were deposited in the Priabonian, with the oldest dating back to about 36 million years ago (Ma) and the youngest not less than about 33 Ma.Rasmussen et al. (1987, 2001) It is not precisely known from which strata the first few remains of this bird were collected. They were formerly considered of Early Oligocene age--some 33-30 Ma--but this is now assumed incorrect, as only the upper and not the entire Jebel Qatrani Formation is of Oligocene age. It is also possible that they are from the slightly older Qasr el Sagha Formation, but as both this and the Oligocene parts of the Jebel Qatrani Formation were laid down in an ecosystem markedly different from that of the Eocene Jebel Qatrani Formation, it is now assumed that all material of E. eocaenus is from the lowest rocks of the Jebel Qatrani Formation.Brodkorb (1963) pp.205-206, Rasmussen et al. (1987, 2001) Material, taxonomy and systematics It was originally described from a distal left tibiotarsus piece (specimen BMNH A843); a toe phalanx bone found soon thereafter was tentatively assigned to this bird. Eremopezus was initially believed a ratite and loosely allied with the elephant birds of Madagascar. Thus, when a piece of tarsometatarsus shaft was found some time later north of the ruins of Dimeh (Dim√™; itself a bit north of the Birket Qarun) this was described as Stromeria fajumensis; though it had a size to match the holotype tibiotarsus it was thought to resemble an elephant bird even more. The shaft (specimen BSPG 1914 I 53) has a prominent plantar (backside) ridge also found in Mullerornis betsilei, and this was used to ally the fossil bone with this rather small and gracile elephant bird. The Eremopezus specimen on the other hand has deep ligamental pits on the lateral and medial sides of the distal condyles, which are not found in the elephant birds proper. These pits together with a crisply defined ridge held a sling of ligament, which in turn--in place of the bony supratendinal bridge found in some other birds--kept the ankle tendons from dislocating. The tarsometatarsus is also more similar to that of an unspecific ratite, such as an emu, ostrich or rhea, rather than to the apomorphic one of the elephant birds. Almost 100 years after the discovery of the holotype, more Eremopezus fossils were unearthed from the famous quarry L-41 at Tel Akgrab near . These are also all leg and foot bones, namely specimens DPC 20919 (a distal right tibiotarsus and its entire tarsometatarsus), DPC 5555 (the lower half of a left tarsometatarsus) and DPC 18309 (the distal end of a left tarsometatarsus).Rasmussen et al. (2001) Some fossil eggshells from the Maghreb, described as Psammornis and resembling those of ratite eggs, were assigned to Eremopezus by various authors. They were at first believed to date form the Paleogene also, but today are generally considered far younger (of late Neogene age, probably less than 5 Ma) and indeed to have been laid by ostriches or close relatives thereof.Brodkorb (1963): p.205, Rasmussen et al. (2001) Faiyum Oasis today The scientific name Eremopezus eocaenus is rather ambiguous in meaning; a possible translation is \\"walking hermit from the Eocene\\". Eremos (·ºêœÅ·øÜŒºŒøœÇ) is an Ancient Greek term signifying a lonely or solitary place or person: a hermit, a desert or a wasteland. Yet while Faiyum is located at the edge of the Libyan Desert, it is a well-vegetated location even today; some 35-30 Ma it was a lush region and teemed with life. On the other hand, is it not at all likely that such a large and quite likely predatory bird like E. eocaenus was in any way gregarious or occurred at high population densities. It might therefore be described as a \\"hermit\\" with some justification, but certainly not as a \\"desert-dweller\\". pezus is Latinized Greek from pez√≥s (œÄŒµŒ∂œåœÇ), \\"someone who walks\\". eocaenus refers to the bird's age; as noted, the initial 1904 assessment of C. W. Andrews was indeed correct. Stromeria fajumensis was named in honor of the paleontologist Ernst Stromer von Reichenbach, and the bone's place of discovery.Woodhouse (1910), Rasmussen et al. (1987), Gagnon (1997) Systematics Careful study of the remains suggests that their apparent similarity to ratites is misleading. They actually combine a number of traits not found in any known ratite lineage, and in particularly not in the ostriches and elephant birds (the only ratites biogeographically close to Eremopezus). Moreover, the prehistoric bird had several peculiar traits not at all found in ratites, but present in certain neognaths: its toes were widely divergent and could flex through a wide range of positions, while strong tendons gave the bird a firm grip. In the associated anatomical details, E. eocaenus resembled the secretarybird (Sagittarius serpentarius) and the shoebill (Balaeniceps rex), two rather singular African endemics. Nonetheless, more recent studies seem to group it among \\"aepyornithid-like\\" taxa.Agnolin et al, Unexpected diversity of ratites (Aves, Palaeognathae) in the early Cenozoic of South America: palaeobiogeographical implications Article in Alcheringa An Australasian Journal of Palaeontology ¬∑ July 2016 DOI: 10.1080/03115518.2016.1184898 Adult secretarybird (Sagittarius serpentarius) The secretarybird is a bird of prey that can fly well, but prefers to walk around on its long legs, especially when foraging. It uses its flexible toes to grab prey--large arthropods and small to mid-sized terrestrial vertebrate. It throws the prey around and kicks it forcefully, smashing it to death or breaking its spine. The shoebill, meanwhile, for lack of a better theory was long considered a large aberrant stork relative in the Ciconiiformes. This eventually proved incorrect. While B. rex is indeed a member of the same group of \\"higher waterbirds\\" as are storks and herons, it is closely related to pelicans and thus came to be included in the Pelecaniformes--which are not monophyletic as described in old times, however, and whose small core group, for simplicity, is included in the Ciconiiformes by some recent authors. Insofar, the shoebill is today recognized as the formerly missing link uniting pelicans and storks. Like the pelicans, it uses its massive bill and throat sac to catch large fish and similar aquatic vertebrates, but unlike them it is a wading, not a swimming bird, and correspondingly has long legs like a stork. It clambers through reed beds in search of good fishing spots, and uses its flexible toes to firmly hold on to such uncertain substrate as heaps of wind-blown vegetation at the edge of the open water or roots and logs of trees.Wing (1995), Rasmussen et al. (2001), Cracraft et al. (2004) But this does not mean that Eremopezus was a close relative of either secretarybird or shoebill. Even though modern taxonomy generally tries to avoid using monotypic families as much as possible, its placement in a distinct family Eremopezidae may well be warranted, as its closest relatives remain completely obscure. For the birds of prey, a Paleocene (perhaps even Late Cretaceous) origin seems most likely; the first fossils of the present-day lineages (and some entirely extinct forms) are abundant in Eocene strata of the Holarctic, particularly Europe. The falcons seem to have rapidly spread throughout the Americas, where the plesiomorphic caracaras are found. The other diurnal raptors, family Accipitridae--by some considered more distinct, as core group of an order Accipitriformes -, apparently diversified eastwards into Asia and eventually into Africa. As regards the secretarybird, the genus Pelargopappus occurred at about the same time as E. eocaenus in today's France, separated from the site of Faiyum by more than 1,500 kmOver half the distance between Africa and South America in our time of the shrinking Tethys Sea. The Maghreb was closer to Europe however, not more than today's Mediterranean where it is widest, and numerous bird lineages are known to have occurred in Africa as well as in Europe during the Eocene. Pelargopappus seems to be an ancient secretarybird, not an ancestor of the living species but not far removed from the last common ancestor either. Its remains, and how they differ from secretarybirds, give an idea how the Sagittariidae of that time looked like. So even though Pelargopappus has not yet been directly compared to the African fossil in a cladistic analysis, the pronounced differences between Eremopezus and Sagittarius and the biogeography of Pelargopappus suggest that Eremopezus was not especially close to the secretarybird's lineage. Thus, even if it belongs with the Falconiformes (or Accipitriformes), it would probably remain in its distinct family.Mourer-Chauvir√© & Cheneval (1983) Shoebill (Balaeniceps rex). Though stork-like in habitus, the bill's \\"nail\\" betrays its relationship to the pelicans The same is true if it were placed in the Pelecaniformes. For as it seems, Goliathia andrewsi, an ancestral shoebill that was slightly larger and presumably far less apomorphic than the living species, lived at about the same time and in the same region as E. eocaenus. It is only known from a single ulna, which proves however that it was far less in bulk than Eremopezus and certainly able to fly well.Rasmussen et al. (1987) But all things considered, very little can be said about the affiliations of Eremopezus. As ratites are nowadays presumed to have evolved from flying paleognaths similar to tinamous after the Cretaceous--see also Palaeotis--the Egyptian fossil may be a distinct lineage of ratites after all, and is sometimes allied with the Paleocene Remiornis from France. And indeed, as noted by the first scientists that studied it, its known bones--in particular the distal tarsometatarsus-- are more similar to those of ratites in general shape and in some details than to other birds. The details (such as lack of the supratendinal bridge) may however be simply plesiomorphies, while the overall resemblance might be the result of convergent evolution--for the autapomorphies of its toes are starkly unlike those found in any ratite. Thus, if it was a ratite, it probably was the most unusual ratite known to date (while the hardly better-known Remiornis may very well have been a rather conventional proto-ostrich). As far as can be told however, ratites did never evolve gripping feet like seen in the fossils, and neither did they fare very successfully in wetland habitat as represented in the Jebel Qatrani Formation. The latter holds true for Galliformes, which are ancient neognaths of the fowl clade (Galloanserae). Anseriformes, the other living member of this group, include the typical waterfowl such as ducks, and many of them independently evolved flexible toes, giving them the ability to perch despite having only a vestigial hallux (see also Cairinini). The Anseriformes also contain the gigantic flightless mihirungs (Dromornithidae) of Australia (which were, at first, also believed ratites). It is not inconceivable that E. eocaenus was a more aquatic African equivalent of these.Livezey (1986), Cracraft et al. (2004) Thus, until more fossils are found, all that can be said is that Eremopezus is unlikely to have been a galliform or a member of the \\"near passerines\\" group (in the strict sense-- perching birds and their immediate allies); these latter orders are generally smallish, live in trees, and probably evolved even later than the birds of prey. But beyond that, it cannot even be ruled out with reasonable certainty that the initial assessment--however lacking by the standards of today's scientific method--was correct and that E. eocaenus was indeed a highly apomorphic paleognath. Description While the rest of the bird can only be tentatively inferred, the legs (the lower leg to midfoot actually) of this gigantic bird are rather well-known today and their details yield some rather robust information on the habits of E. eocaenus. Feet Adult male American rhea (Rhea americana). E. eocaenus probably had legs longer than but about as thick as this bird. Its tibiotarsus length is not precisely known; if it had the proportions found in elephant birds and moa, it would have been 80‚Äì90 cm long. But there is no real reason to assume that Eremopezus, living in wetlands rich in predators, was similar to these bulky lumbering insular ratites. The tibiotarsus of DPC 20919 preserves most of the bone and is as long as the complete tarsometatarsus already (34 cm); an overall tibiotarsus length of c. 40‚Äì50 cm, as found in the small slow-moving elephant bird Mullerornis agilis and the nimble emu, is a reasonable estimate.Amadon (1947), Rasmussen et al. (1987, 2001) The tarsometatarsus had a small hypotarsus with a single simple crest and devoid of foramina for tendons. The ankle joint consists of a sizable midward and an even larger outward groove. The conspicuous ridge on the backside of the tarsometatarsus is formed by the third toe's midfoot bones, which are set to the plantar side in respect to their neighbors, with which they are fused. This is particularly noticeable in the lower part of the bone, where a corresponding groove is present on the dorsal side. This smooths out proximad, with the proximal half of the bone-- which is not known from an unflattened specimen to date--probably oval or triangular (with the point backwards) in cross section. The dwarf cassowary (Casuarius bennetti) is one of the few ratites with toes as splayed as (but still less mobile than) E. eocaenus As regards the length and stoutness of the lower leg and the foot, E. eocaenus would probably have been similar to a good-sized American rhea (Rhea americana) in measurements. Its toes, however, differed vastly in shape and posture from those of this ratite (and most other birds). Above the tibiotarsal trochleae of the African bird, the bone was considerably wider than the ankle, among ratites being matched by some moa and the dwarf cassowary (Casuarius bennetti). Thus, towards its toes the midfoot bone must have flared outwards, resulting in an overall wide-footed appearance. It is notable that while elephant birds have toes that are only a little more flaring than those of rheas, those of fast-running long-legged birds (ratites and others, like seriemas and some Charadriiformes) generally tend to bunch together in a narrower angle, with the most extreme situation found in the ostrich. This suggests that wherever Eremopezus did walk, it indeed walked or trotted and ran only in dire need--if it could run quickly at all, which is by no means certain. It is also notable that the attachment point of the tibiotarsal trochleae was flattened in Eremopezus, leaving little room for a bulky pad where the toes joined. In cursorial birds, this area is typically wide, to provide space for a large cushioning pad where the toes join, which improves balance during walking or running. The structure in E. eocaenus, by contrast, must have allowed a much better toe-flexing ability. The shallow grooves on the trochleae allowed for considerable sideways mobility of the toes; if the single phalanx bone known is assigned correctly to this species (it is the best match in size by far), it is very wide at the proximal end and tapers noticeably distad. The third (middle) toe was the most robust and largest. The inner toe was about as large as the outer one, and attached noticeably more proximal on the tibiotarsus. There is a single foramen on the dorsal side of the tarsometatarsus, with a plantar exit hole between the third and fourth metacarpal's distal ends (presumably for the outer toe's adductor tendon) and another (presumably for nerves and blood vessels) on the plantar surface of the tarsometatarsus. The outer sides of the outer trochleae have a hook at their backward end, which together with deep pits for ligaments nearby must have served to hold strong tendons. Its hallux was vestigial, as is typical for birds that move about on foot a lot; it even cannot be ruled out that the hallux was entirely missing (as in ratites). Size and flightlessness Though its habitus remains unknown, E. eocaenus was probably roughly as tall and heavy as this emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae) E. eocaenus was somewhat ponderous, at about the body size of Mullerornis betsilei. As this was one of the heavy-boned elephant birds, Eremopezus was probably lighter than it, especially if it retained the air-filled bones of flying ancestors. From the ground to the pelvis, it stood probably as high as a large rhea or small emu--slightly less than one meter in all probability -, though the robust bones of the prehistoric bird appear to have supported a larger bulk than those of the fleet-footed ratites. Altogether, even if it was not particularly long-necked Eremopezus must have stood about as high as an average adult human. It weighed probably less than 50 kg--slightly more than a large emu--and more than 10 kg--slightly more than the largest living storks (which reach over 150 cm in height) and the shoebill. Adult kori bustard (Ardeotis kori). Perhaps, E. eocaenus was only as heavy as this bird The general limit for weight in flying birds is at about 25 kg, the exceptional Argentavis magnificens with its size and weight of a good-sized adult human notwithstanding as it evolved under unusual ecological conditions. Large males of the kori bustard (Ardeotis kori) and great bustard (Otis tarda) are perfectly capable of flight, while weighing in excess of 20 kg. A wing loading of c. 25 kg/m2 is the known limit for bird flight under normal circumstances; thus, a case could be made for Eremopezus to have been capable of flight. Paleontologists do not consider this likely however, due to the stoutness of the bones, which in such a degree is only known from birds that were certainly flightless. The secretarybird's tarsometatarsus, for example, is only some 20% shorter but more than 60% slimmer than that of E. eocaenus. Thus, its wings and arm bones were probably reduced, a process known to have taken as little as 10,000 years in some island rails. Plumage and beak As birds become flightless, their feathers soon lose the barbule hooks that keep them in shape, becoming more hair-like; when flight performance is of no significance anymore, this can improve the insulating properties of the plumage. Nothing is known about the plumage color of Eremopezus; it was presumably not very gaudily colored as it had to avoid apex predators, but little else can be inferred. Perhaps most likely it had white, black or grey feathers with at least some eumelanin but little carotenoids and phaeomelanins, as usual among the \\"higher waterbirds\\" in general, and specifically those that inhabit similar habitat. If it was a terrestrial animal, it might have been fairly short-necked; if it inhabited wetlands, its neck was probably not short and quite possibly rather long. The bill of Eremopezus was of unknown shape, but must in some way have been adapted to its feeding. Even if not a predator, being as it seems a member of the Neoaves its not-too-distant ancestors probably fed on animals. If it fed on terrestrial prey, it might have had the hooked bill of a bird of prey, but this is very specialized. Among the \\"higher waterbirds\\" that variously consume aquatic and/or terrestrial large invertebrates and small vertebrates, a spear-like pointed bill seems to have proven most apt for the task. The Pelecaniformes in particular have a distinct hook or \\"nail\\" on the billtip, which is even present in the otherwise plesiomorphic bill of the hammerkop (Scopus umbretta). If E. eocaenus was a pelecaniform, it probably also possessed this \\"nail\\", but apart from that its bill might just as well have evolved autapomorphies as bizarre as those of the pelicans. Ecology Artist's impression of Faiyum swamp forest at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary, with two anthracotheriids (Bothriogenys fraasi, front) and an arsinoitheriid (Arsinoitherium zitteli) The Jebel Qatrani Formation is mainly composed of sandstones and mudstones, which were laid down as point bar and overbanks of meandering freshwater rivers, which drained the northeastern tip of Africa westwards into a depression just inland from the Tethys Sea shores, and at least in the wet season must have expanded into large shallow lakes. The entire region was low-lying, and only a few million years (Ma) before Eremopezus inhabited these lands--and when sea levels were higher--submerged under the ocean. The climate was warmer than today, and the region probably was tropical with abundant rainfall during the monsoon season, as indicated by the paleosols formed from alluvial sediments and traces of buttress roots. Altogether, the habitat must have resembled the Niger Delta of our time. The Eremopezus fossils dated with confidence are from a time when there was apparently more forest and less grassland in the region than half a dozen million years later. The reed grasses of the subfamily Arundinoideae were probably far less widespread in Africa 35 Ma than they are today, but it is fairly likely that other Poales reeds--Cyperaceae (maybe including the ancestors of the Papyrus Sedge Cyperus papyrus), Juncaceae and Typhaceae--grew in aquatic habitats back then already.Wing (1995), Rasmussen et al. (1987, 2001), Gagnon (1997), Holroyd (1999), Seifert & Simons (2000), Bremer (2002), Murray (2002, 2004), Lewis & Simons (2007) The terrestrial fauna in the habitat of Eremopezus consisted mainly of the ancestors of animals occurring in Africa today; among mammals particularly Afrotheria were present. Some entirely extinct lineages were also found, e.g. Anthracotheriidae and Creodonta. As regards birds, fossils are only plentiful from some Ma later; as mentioned above, they generally represent the Paleogene avifauna found around the shores of the shrinking Tethys Sea, whose descendants nowadays live in tropical Africa. In quarry L-41, remains of a large ancestral stork (presumably Palaeoephippiorhynchus dietrichi) were present, indicating that two or three E. eocaenus (one right and two left feet were found) died in or next to a slow-moving or stagnant watercourse. This agrees with the view that the birds actually lived in such habitat, rather than their carcasses having been transported there by a flood or similar.Rasmussen et al. (1987, 2001), Gagnon (1997), Holroyd (1999), Seifert & Simons (2000), Boles (2005), Louchart et al. (2005), Lewis & Simons (2007) E. eocaenus might have been a frugivore or even herbivore of swamp forests, but the early Neoaves (to which it probably belonged) are generally predatory. As a predator, it would have fed mainly on mid-sized terrestrial vertebrates--for example large reptilesSnakes of the widely distributed Late Eocene genus Pterosphenus settled the Faiyum region soon after the ocean had receded: Rage et al. (2005). or smallish mammals.E.g. the phiomyid rodents--some of them tree-climbing--Acritophiomys bowni, A. woodi, Gaudeamus hylaeus and Elwynomys lavocati abundantly found in the same stratum, the insectivorous pseudoungulate Herodotius pattersoni, the putative otter shrew Widanelfarasia, and the unidentified opossum-like marsupials perhaps of or related to the genus Peratherium: Gagnon (1997), Seifert & Simons (2000), Lewis & Simons (2007), Seifert (2007). Alternatively --depending on its preferred habitat--it could have eaten mainly aquatic vertebrates.E.g. the snakehead Parachanna fayumensis, catfish perhaps of the somewhat older genus Fajumia, or Characiformes perhaps representing the African tetras (Alestidae) found in slightly younger Faiyum sediments: Murray (2002, 2004). It cannot be ruled out that it was a filter feeder like flamingos (as of 2008 tentatively considered highly specialized \\"higher waterbirds\\") or most Anseriformes. In any case, it would need to roam a considerable range to find enough food, and thus population density was likely low. Unmated birds were probably solitary. Mated pairs might have stayed together for life, as they often do in birds. Heinrich Harder's reconstruction of Arsinoitherium shows it in an open landscape dominated by Poales, which apparently widely replaced the forest at Faiyum in the Early Oligocene Large hyaenodontid creodonts--Akenatenavus cf. leptognathus and possiblyKnown from slightly older and younger but not from the same Faiyum lagerst√§tten as E. eocaenus: Holroyd (1999). Metapterodon--shared the habitat with E. eocaenus, and these pack-hunting carnivores, larger than the average dog, could well have included it among their prey. Flightless or at least not quick in taking off, and not well-adapted to running away from threats either, retreating into the swamplands or reed belt would have provided a means of escape for the large birds. Here too, the highly mobile toes would have proven useful. While near the water, Eremopezus would have had to watch out for the basal crocodile \\"Crocodylus\\" megarhinus,\\"C.\\" articeps probably refers to immature individuals of \\"C.\\" megarhinus. the aquatic apex predator of Late Eocene Faiyum. On the other hand, the long-snouted gavialid Eogavialis africanum makes a rather unlikely predator of the giant bird, but feeding on large fish and other mid- sized vertebrates (like the false gharial Tomistoma schlegelii of the present time), it would probably have competed with E. eocaenus for food to some extent if the bird indeed was a carnivorous semi-aquatic species.Gagnon (1997), Holroyd (1999), Brochu (2000), Brochu & Gingerich (2000) As only tentative inferences can be made about the habits of Eremopezus, it is not clear why it became extinct. Still, nothing even remotely resembling a possible descendant is known or inferred, making it rather likely that its lineage did not progress very far. It is sometimes believed that flightless birds cannot compete with carnivorous mammals, but the Phorusrhacidae prove that even carnivorous flightless birds can very well thrive in the presence of mammalian competitors. However, the rather comprehensive ecological data indicates that habitat in the Faiyum region changed at the start of the Oligocene: for some time, savanna dominated by true grasses (Poaceae) and shrubland seem to have displaced the swamp forest to a considerable extent, creating a habitat similar to that found at the less humid regions along the lower S√©n√©gal River. When the forest expanded again, different mammals--an abundance of monkeys but far fewer of the huge Pliohyracidae hyraxes-- inhabited it. In general, the emerging picture is one of an economic upheaval that lasted for perhaps 10 million years, and during which the Paleogene ecosystem at Faiyum with its numerous now-extinct lineages gave way to a more modern one, inhabited by the ancestors of animals that live in tropical Africa today. If Eremopezus was indeed a swamp forest bird, it may well have succumbed to this change. In that respect, it is notable that the \\"African\\" fauna found in Europe was replaced by animals originating in Asia starting at about the same time.Rasmussen et al.

It is the seat of the Archbishop of Acerenza. The cathedral is one of the most notable Romanesque structures in this part of Italy. History and description The diocese was established by the late 5th century,Catholic Hierarchy: Archdiocese of Acerenza but the structure of the present Romanesque cathedral building dates from 1080, when construction was begun under archbishop Arnald of Cluny. The site however is far more ancient and traces remain in the present building both of a pagan temple to Hercules Acheruntinus and of the earlier Christian church. It has a Latin cross ground plan, and three aisles, which terminate in a raised presbytery behind which is an apse with an ambulatory and three radiating chapels, an unusual feature in Italian church design; the transept also terminates at either end in a semi-circular chapel. The ambulatory contains the altar which houses the relics of Saint Canius (or Canus; ). The crypt dates from 1524 and contains what is believed to be the sarcophagus of Saint Canius. The campanile was added in 1555, and reuses many interesting fragments of ancient stonework, including two Roman sarcophagi and a sacrificial altar decorated with bulls' heads. The interior of the cathedral features many unusual zoomorphic and floral carvings, in the Cluniac manner, the possible symbolic significance of which has caused speculation.as for example in this article Works of art Of especial note are a polyptych showing Our Lady of the Rosary and the Fifteen Mysteries, with Saints Dominic and Thomas, made by Antonio Stabile in 1583, and four frescos in the cloister by Giovanni Todisco di Abriola. The cathedral also possesses a noted marble portrait bust of the Emperor Julian the Apostate, which used to be believed to show Saint Canius.It has also been suggested that it is a bust of Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, in the style of the Antonine portrait sculptors.

Portrayed by Craig Kelly, the character appeared throughout 2009. Luke took over Carla Connor's share of the Underworld factory with Tony Gordon. He knew Carla's deceased husband, Paul Connor. Storylines Luke arrives in Weatherfield on 20 February 2009 replacing Carla Connor (Alison King) as the manager of Underworld. He initially infuriates Tony Gordon (Gray O'Brien) after refusing to say where Carla was claiming that all he had told her was that the business needed running. He makes friends with Tom Kerrigan (Philip McGinley) and Maria Connor (Samia Smith) after hearing the story about Liam Connor's (Rob James-Collier) death. After hearing about their business 'LadRags' he expresses an interest in buying it from them for ¬£50,000 each. Tom and Maria, however, state that they need more time to consider the matter. On 30 March 2009, Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne) accidentally drops a lit cigarette while drunk and falls asleep as his flat began to catch fire, Deirdre Barlow (Anne Kirkbride) receives a call from Peter's six-year-old son Simon (Alex Bain) telling her that the flat is on fire. She runs out of the house and tells Luke and Tony as they rush into the house and call an ambulance. Luke gets Simon out while saying he should get Simon's pet rabbit out but Tony keeps repeating that he should leave it. In the end Tony gets Peter out, while Luke goes back in to rescue the rabbit. Luke goes on have a brief fling with Michelle Connor (Kym Marsh) before she leaves to go on tour with her band. He then turns his attentions to Underworld P.A. Rosie Webster (Helen Flanagan) when she receives a windfall of ¬£150,000 from John Stape (Graeme Hawley). He seduces her and afterwards convinces her to invest in a 9% share of the factory much to her delight. Upon Michelle's return to the Street, Luke's head is once again turned as he dumps Rosie for Michelle. However, he soon gives into Rosie's charms again as the pair sleep together. Rosie tricks Luke, when she takes his phone and texts Michelle pretending to be Luke. Michelle is disgusted when she comes to Luke's apartment only to see Rosie there. Michelle storms out, quickly followed by Rosie, telling Luke that he is dumped. In October 2009, Luke receives a call from Carla to say that she is coming back to reclaim her shares. Knowing that he has no options left, he quickly turns to Rosie and her money. He lies to her saying that he wants to invest in another company, and that he would like if she bought his shares in Underworld (that were in fact Carla's all along) for ¬£90,000. The idea of being a majority shareholder in the factory is very appealing for Rosie as she falls for Luke's deceit. She agrees, and transfers the money into Luke's bank account on 19 October 2009, meanwhile, Luke makes his getaway as he drives out of Weatherfield, destined for Rio de Janeiro. It is too late for Rosie before she realises that she has been conned, as the bank inform her that it is too late to stop the transfer. Creation Background Information about the character first surfaced at the end of 2008 when it was revealed he had been created as a new boss of the underworld factory, to replace character Carla Connor, while the actress went on maternity leave. Speaking of the character and plans for him a spokesperson for the soap opera said: \\"It looks like Tony may have met his match in Luke Strong. He‚Äôs a bit of a mystery man and Tony doesn't know what his motives are for buying into the business or how he knows Carla. Luke is certainly going to make things difficult for Mr Gordon.\\" Later background information of the character was revealed and what links the character had to other character within the show. This was that Luke went to Secondary School with the character of Carla in September 1986 to June 1991. In his teenage years he romanced her and they became good friends and he became friends with Carla's boyfriend and future husband Paul. Luke then lost contact with Carla after she and Paul married in 1999 and started to run his own business. Casting For the part of Luke Strong, no auditions were held. Instead actor Craig Kelly was offered the role. Kelly himself revealed during an interview how the part came about saying: \\"It literally started with a phone call from the producers and it went from there. If any other soap had called, I'd have probably said 'no'. Because it was Corrie and the breakdown of the character was so fantastic, I just thought to myself 'why not?!' I met the team and was offered the part. I instinctively knew that this was for me. Even though it's a big step and a change of direction for me, it's still acting and I'm still getting paid for what I love doing. It's all exciting and quite surreal, especially when you walk onto the Street for the first time. I've never played a character that's as similar to me as Luke is, before. I've only really ever played psychotic transsexuals or gay men that are like door mats. They've been very varied character roles and it's rare that such a fun role as Luke comes up, such a pity he lacks the sociopathic qualities I enjoy.\\" At the time he was also asked if the character already had certain traits, with Kelly saying: \\"They started to write for me after the casting, so that's the exciting thing - if I choose to give him some quirks or a tick, the writers will work with that.\\" Of first scenes he said: \\"Within my first two weeks, I was given 19 scenes, but by the end of it, I realised that on screen, it'll probably be about seven days of Luke's life. You've got to be patient when you're trying to build a character in soap - it's tiny, tiny steps.\\" On 18 June 2009, it was announced actor Craig Kelly would quit his role, after less than a year. He then departed the show on 19 October 2009. Development Personality and identity Of his character actor Craig Kelly said during an interview with media website Digital Spy: \\"Luke is a likeable character who's got ambition and has achieved success through his wit, charm and instinct. He dresses well and likes a laugh and a flirt with the girls, but can handle himself well. He's not a guy who wants to go to war with someone, but if push comes to shove, he'll have it. Really, he just wants to do well in his life. He sees his sexualtiy as a bit of an adventure. I like to call him a well-rounded entrepreneur who has his thumbs in a lot of different pies.\\" Going on to add: \\"He has a great, infectious energy - so much so that I did say to Kim Crowther 'you're not going to turn him into a psycho, are you?' She said 'no', so I was pleased! Sometimes in soap, characters can be too good to be true, so I think it's time for a hero to waltz in and give the bad guy a run for his money.\\" In a later interview with the website he said: \\"He's an opportunist. He's a bit of a dark horse... But I think he's going to start to open up a bit more now and show his cheekier side.\\" Reception Actor Craig Kelly stated that his main fanbase is women in their 70s and 80s, commenting, \\"Its my fetish. I have a very dedicated fan called Elsie, who is 91.\\" Upon the announcement that Craig Kelly was to quit his role, Kris Green of Digital Spy said that the character's departure was the most frustrating news of the week, noted him as one of the most promising characters from the show in years, noted Craig Kelly's 'amazing' performance, but that he was quite disappointed that time had been invested in a character that was essentially built up as the key alpha male of the Street.

Origins Most new railways, particularly those of the Midland, were built for transporting coal, and so could show a quick return on investment. A line from Leicester to Peterborough had been floated as an independent scheme which might not have progressed, even though there had been a famine of coal in the area. At Stamford for instance it had risen to forty shillings a ton. However, because of the railway politics of the time, it was supported by George Hudson who was involved with the Midland Counties Railway which, was in the process of merging into the new Midland Railway. The Midland at that time was the main line from London to the North East of England, via Derby, Leeds and York. The Midland adopted the line ‚Äë along with the Nottingham to Lincoln Line ‚Äë as part of urgent moves to hinder the expansion of the Northern and Eastern Railway northwards from London to York. A holiday express returning from the East Coast north of Peterborough in 1959 Preparation The route was surveyed in 1844, and plans lodged with the various county offices on 30 November. The engineers for the line were George Stephenson and Charles Liddell. The surveyor was J.G. Binns. The cost estimate was ¬£700,000, or ¬£15,000 a mile.Williams, F.S., (1874) The Midland Railway: Its Rise and Progress Derby: Bemrose and Son Even before the Act was passed there were problems where the line approached the estate of the Earl of Harborough. The original plan was to follow the course of the Wreake through Stapleford Park. Not only did the Earl refuse to sell the land, he put up notices forbidding the surveyors entry to the Park. A group of surveyors, walking along the towpath of the Oakham Canal, were confronted by Lord Harborough's men and ordered to return to where they had come from. Since it was a public right of way, the surveyors refused, whereupon they were arrested and put in a cart, presumably to be taken before a magistrate. They were stopped by a policeman who pointed out that the surveyors were in the right, so they were simply tipped out into the road. In what became known as the \\"Battle of Saxby\\", the Midland Railway men returned with reinforcements, to meet a similarly enlarged force of estate workers. The railwaymen were chased away but returned two days later, early in the morning, to find Harborough's men waiting for them once more. The mayhem came to the attention of the authorities, who imprisoned some of the Midland men and fined some estate workers for damage to surveying equipment.Kingscott, G., (2006) Lost Railways of Leicestershire and Rutland, Newbury: Countryside Books In spite of his Lordship's opposition, however, the Syston and Peterborough Railway Act was passed on 30 June 1845. Construction From the junction at Syston, the line went first north-eastwards towards Asfordby then swung to the east to Melton Mowbray along the valley of the Wreake then along the River Eye. It was at this point, where the intention was to travel south towards Oakham, that the line encountered Stapleford Park. The law was now firmly on the Midland side, but Lord Harborough continued his opposition. Even though the Act included an amendment which would take them further away, there was another brawl which resulted in him driving his carriage full tilt into the railwaymen, This amendment included a tunnel under the Cuckoo plantation, his Lordship's favourite part of the park. Unfortunately it collapsed during construction, and most of the spinney fell into it. The Earl was furious and a further Act of Parliament in 1847 arranged for yet another deviation.Anderson, P.H., (1985 2nd ed) Forgotten Railways Vol 2: The East Midlands, Newton Abbot: David and Charles From Oakham, the line skirted the Vale of Catmose (part of which was later flooded to form Rutland Water). It then turned eastwards along the River Chater. At Luffenham it was joined by the Rugby and Stamford Railway which the LNWR was building at the same time and had been granted running rights into Stamford. From Stamford it then curved southwards to meet the Eastern Counties Railway at Peterborough. While most of the line opened in 1846, the problems at Stapleford Park delayed this section for another two years. Later history Midland holiday express to Great Yarmouth at Walton in 1959 By 1879 the Midland's main line through Leicester was becoming overcrowded. From London as far as Kettering the line was quadrupled, but northwards the Midland took the opportunity of diverting through Manton (the Oakham to Kettering Line )to give both Oakham and Melton Mowbray a direct London service, proceeding thence to Nottingham by what became known as the \\"Melton Line\\". The curve around Stapleford Park was a nuisance for the express trains and, in 1880 when the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway built a branch from Bourne in Lincolnshire to Saxby, the opportunity was taken to reduce the curve with Saxby station being moved in the process. Lord Harborough had died in the meantime and the estate had been bought by Lord Gretton of Burton upon Trent, who was more sympathetic to the railway. The Midland had, after all, made his fortune by taking his beer all over the country and, indeed, his son was later to build the Stapleford Miniature Railway within the park. In 1882 the Midland built a branch line from Ashwell to Cottesmore to service iron ore extraction with an exchange sidings. This is now the site of the Rutland Railway Museum. Of note also are the stations at Helpston and Walton. When the GNR built its line north from Peterborough to Grantham in 1853, it ran next to the Midland line but, in return for the latter's transport of materials, agreed not to build competing stations. Although most of the branches are gone, or at least no longer support regular passenger services, the Syston and Peterborough Railway is still in daily use as part of the Birmingham to Peterborough Line The advent of Google Earth has meant that what is still known as \\"Lord Harborough's Curve\\", as well as the trackbed of the M&GNR; branch, at Saxby can clearly be seen.

The sole species is Enhalus acoroides. Enhalus is large seagrass native to coastal waters of the tropical Indian and Western Pacific Oceans. It is the only species of seagrass that does aerial surface pollination in which the pollen and the styles remain dry.Phillips, R.C. and E.G. Me√±ez. 1988. Seagrasses. Smithsonian Contrib. Mar. Sci. 34, 104 pp. Enhalus is surface pollinated with male flowers that detach from the plant to float on the surface until they reach a female flower where pollination can occur. Enhalus acoroides is considered a slow-growing, \\"climax\\" species. Description Enhalus acoroides massive rhizomes (1.5 cm in diameter) help it stay anchored in soft mud substrates, withstanding wave action and tidal currents. it has long strap like leaves (30‚Äì150 cm) which make up a significant volume of total plant biomass of shallow water seagrass beds, because of the large structure of the leaves and where they are in the water column, they provide greater surfaces for Epibiont organisms to inhabit. Fruit are round and large (4‚Äì6 cm in diameter) with dark, ribbed skin and 6-7 white seeds. The male plant bears a single pedunculate inflorescence or stem containing clusters of flowers, each is highly reduced in form to a small free floating device. Female Enhalus acoroides bears only a single inflorescence, but the peduncle of a female flower is much longer. Distribution and habitat Enhalus acoroides is a littoral species living in shallow soft substrates like muddy or sand-flats and coral substrates depending the region of growth. It can be found as far east as Papua New Guinea and can range from the Red Sea south to northern Mozambique in the Indian Ocean. It can be found in mixed meadows of seagrasses comprising 90% of the meadow biomass mainly with Thallassia hemprichii. it can also be found living in isolated areas. Enhalus acoroides grows best just above the level of mean low water springs and grows to generally 4 meters deep. Reproduction Enhalus acoroides is dioecious and able to reproduce sexually and asexually. Enhalus acoroides create small isolated patches containing 25 to 200 shoots through lateral rhizome spreading. It can also produce pollen like other seagrasses but it is unique in that it is the only species of seagrasses that surface pollinates. During this process, the male flower will break off from the spathe and rise to the surface where it has numerous flowers inside its hydrophobic inflorescences. Once at the surface it will release its pollen to a female inflorescence where it has reached the surface of the water by means of an elongated stalk surface. The developing fruit is drawn under the water to finish ripening. Flowering is a year round phenomenon and the amount of flowers being produced are strongly related to variations in mean water temperatures.
