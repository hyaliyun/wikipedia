A hotel was operated by James Richard Wright, whose son John Vincent Wright was honored by the naming of Wright's Station, which was more commonly known as Wrights. The settlement was located at latitude 370718N, longitude 1215547W; decimal degrees: latitude 37.12167, longitude -121.92972. The site is at the junction of Summit Road and Loma Prieta Avenue.Burrell School, California: Burrell School, California Latitude and Longitude Today, the site, including the restored historic school building, is home to the Burrell School Winery and Vineyards. David and Anne Moulton began development of the Estate vineyard in 1973. At a elevation, the site faces to the southwest. Soils are a complex mixture of loam and shale due to the close proximity to the San Andreas Fault. Initial plantings were to Chardonnay and Merlot, with Pinot Noir added in 2002. Cultivation and spraying are done with heritage Cletrac tractors; pruning, seasonal operations and picking are all done by hand. The winery is open for tastings on Friday, Saturday and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. The Tasting Room is located on the site of the original Teacher's Carriage House.

This process emerged in the 1960s as an offshoot of the printed circuit board industry. Photo etching can produce highly complex parts with very fine detail accurately and economically. This process can offer economical alternatives to stamping, punching, laser or water jet cutting, or wire electrical discharge machining (EDM) for thin gauge precision parts. The tooling is inexpensive and quickly produced. This makes the process useful for prototyping and allows for easy changes in mass production. It maintains dimensional tolerances and does not create burrs or sharp edges. It can make a part in hours after receiving the drawing. PCM can be used on virtually any commercially available metal or alloy, of any hardness. It is limited to materials with a thickness of . Metals include aluminium, brass, copper, inconel, manganese, nickel, silver, steel, stainless steel, zinc and titanium. Photochemical machining is a form of photo engraving, and a similar process in microfabrication is called photolithography. Process The process starts by printing the shape of the part onto optically clear and dimensionally stable photographic film. The \\"phototool\\" consists of two sheets of this film showing negative images of the parts (meaning that the area that will become the parts is clear and all of the areas to be etched are black). The two sheets are optically and mechanically registered to form the top and bottom halves of the tool.Degarmo, p. 690. The metal sheets are cut to size, cleaned and then laminated on both sides with a UV-sensitive photoresist. The coated metal is placed between the two sheets of the phototool and a vacuum is drawn to ensure intimate contact between the phototool and the metal plate. The plate is then exposed in UV light that allows the areas of resist that are in the clear sections of the film to be hardened. After exposure, the plate is \\"developed\\", washing away the unexposed resist and leaving the areas to be etched unprotected. The etching line is a multi-chambered machine that has driven- wheel conveyors to move the plates and arrays of spray nozzles above and below the plates. The etchant is typically an aqueous solution of acid, frequently ferric chloride, that is heated and directed under pressure to both sides of the plate. The etchant reacts with the unprotected metal essentially corroding it away fairly quickly. After neutralizing and rinsing, the remaining resist is removed and the sheet of parts is cleaned and dried. Applications Thin gauge (under ) parts in a broad range of alloys are candidates for photo etching. Industrial applications include fine screens and meshes, apertures and masks, battery grids, fuel cell components, sensors, springs, pressure membranes, heat sinks, flexible heating elements, RF and microwave circuits and components, semiconductor leadframes, motor and transformer laminations, metal gaskets and seals, shields and retainers, electrical contacts, encoders and light choppers, EMI/RFI shields, jewelry and washers. Economics Phototooling is quick and inexpensive to produce. Most phototools costs less than $350 and can be produced in two days or less. Unlike \\"hard\\" tools, such as stamping and punching dies, phototools are exposed only to light and therefore do not suffer wear. Due to the cost of hard tooling for stamping and fine blanking, significant volume is required to justify the expense. Some parts, such as semiconductor leadframes, are so complex and fragile that, despite volumes in the millions of pieces, they can only be produced by photo etching. In PCM, the unit of labor is the sheet. Therefore, it is most economical to plan the largest sheet size possible consistent with the size and dimensional tolerances of the part. The more parts per sheet the lower the unit labor cost per part. Material thickness affects costs as a function of the length of time to etch through. Most alloys etch at rates between of depth per minute per side. In general, steel, copper or aluminium workpieces with a thicknesses up to , part costs will approximate $0.15–0.20 per square inch. As the geometry of the part becomes more complex, photochemical machining gains greater economic advantage over sequential processes such as CNC punching, laser or water-jet cutting, and electrical discharge machining.

He was one of the few players in his generation to have played for the Big Three in Portugal – Sporting, Benfica and Porto. Over 15 seasons, he amassed Primeira Liga totals of 337 matches and 17 goals. Prior to his death in 2008, Alhinho worked as a coach for more than 20 years, in numerous clubs and countries. Club career Born in São Vicente, Cape Verde, Alhinho moved to Portugal shortly after. He made his professional debut with Académica de Coimbra in the 1968–69 season after having joined its youth system at the age of 16 from Académica do Mindelo, appearing in 14 matches as the team finished in sixth position in the Primeira Liga. After three further seasons in Coimbra, Alhinho signed for Sporting CP, winning his first national championship in 1973–74 and never missing a game in two of his three seasons. In 1975 he moved to La Liga side Real Betis but, unsettled, returned to his country of adoption a mere months after, joining FC Porto. In the next five years, Alhinho would be mainly linked contractually to S.L. Benfica, winning another league in 1976–77. During his tenure, however, he also played in Belgium with R.W.D. Molenbeek– rejoining his former club after one season – and in the North American Soccer League for the New England Tea Men, loaned. Aged 33, Alhinho left Benfica, played three more years in the Portuguese top flight, with Portimonense S.C. and S.C. Farense (without ever suffering relegation) and retired from football. He immediately started coaching, with modest Lusitano GC; in the following 22 years he managed teams in Portugal (two in the top division), Morocco, Angola, Qatar, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. International career Alhinho represented Portugal internationally, earning 15 caps over a period of nine years. His debut came on 28 March 1973 in a 1–1 draw with Northern Ireland for the 1974 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, and his last game happened on 5 May 1982 in a 1–3 friendly loss with Brazil. In one of his first coaching jobs, in 1985, Alhinho managed the Cape Verdean national team,Cape Verde Islands – List of International Matches; at RSSSF working with Angola nine years later and again in 2000.Goal Programme – Federação Caboverdiana de Futebol – 2007 (Goal Programme – Cape Verde Football Federation – 2007); FIFA, 24 August 2009 (in French) Death On 31 May 2008, Alhinho opened the doors of the elevator on the sixth floor of his hotel in Benguela and stepped in, only to find the carriage was not there but on the ground floor. He plunged five floors onto the top of the cabin and, despite receiving immediate medical attention, died shortly afterwards at the age of 59.

The RFP required the developer was to accommodate vehicles with ample parking without detracting from the evolving urban and pedestrian atmosphere in the area. The city’s request also emphasized its desire for a true mixed-use development, with all uses taking advantage of views of the adjacent Big Walnut Creek. The Stonehenge Company, then of New Albany, Ohio and later of Gahanna, partnered with the professional architecture and planning firm Bird-Houk Collaborative to propose a multi-story development with first-floor retail facing Mill Street and what would become Creekside Park. Upper levels would contain office space and residential condominium units. Public parking would be hidden in an underground garage with parking for the condominium residents provided inside the “wraparound” residential building. Approximately 389 new public parking spaces would be created. The city expressed its initial commitment to the broad concept, selected Stonehenge as the developer, and then entered more than 18 months of discussions with Stonehenge and the Community Improvement Corporation.

Atherton began riding BMX at the age of 8 and mountain biking at the age of 11. She was both Sunday Times' Sportswoman of the Year and BBC Midlands Junior Sportswoman of the Year in 2005, and then BBC Midlands Sportswoman of the Year in 2008. In October 2015, a video of Atherton overtaking 91 competitors in five minutes during a race went viral. Career For 5 years from 2007, Atherton was part of the Animal Commençal race team along with brothers Dan Atherton and Gee Atherton. In 2012, Atherton, along with her brothers Dan, Gee and Marc Beaumont, signed with GT Bicycles. In 2015, Atherton and her brothers signed with Trek Bicycle Corporation to race for Trek Atherton Racing. In June 2008 Atherton became the first British woman to win the Elite UCI Downhill World Championship, defeating second placed Sabrina Jonnier by 11.99 seconds in the final. Atherton was involved in a collision with a pickup truck whilst on a time trial training ride with her brothers Dan and Gee in Santa Cruz, California, on 18 January 2009. She sustained a dislocated shoulder which, after later needing a nerve graft, ruled her out of the 2009 racing season, including the September World Championships in Canberra. In September 2012, Atherton took the final World Cup round on a diverse and testing Norwegian track and clinched the overall title, despite missing the opening race of the season. The Norwegian race was the final round of a seven-round series in which Atherton claimed a win in 5 of the 6 events she raced. In June 2016, Atherton became the first woman to win 10 consecutive rounds of the World Cup, surpassing the record previously held by Anne-Caroline Chausson. In September that same year, she also achieved the unprecedented feat of winning every round in a World Cup season.

The temple was built around the early 5th century BC. According to Pausanias,Pausanias, I,14,7 the sanctuary had a marble statue of the deity sculpted by the ancient Greek sculptor Phidias: :Above the Kerameikos [in Athens] is a sanctuary of the Aphrodite Ourania (Heavenly); the first men to establish her cult were the Assyrians, after the Assyrians the Paphians of Kypros and the Phoinikians who live at Askalon in Palestine; the Phoinikians taught her worship to the people of Kythera. Among the Athenians the cult was established by Aegeus, who thought that he was childless (he had, in fact, no children at the time ) and that his sisters had suffered their misfortune because of the wrath of Aphrodite Ourania (Heavenly). The statue still extant is of Parian marble and is the work of Pheidias. One of the Athenian parishes is that of the Athmoneis, who say that Porphyrion, an earlier king than Aktaios, founded their sanctuary of Ourania.

In 1896 came in Palestine where he received an appointment as director of the Jerusalem professional school of the Alliance israélite universelle, a position he held until 1913. He was throughout his life a passionate Francophile, and subscribed to the ideal of the Jewish emancipation under the Turkish rule and French cultural and political influence. His fluency in French, Hebrew, Arabic and English, combined with his mastery of three or four different systems of law – Beth Din, Sharia, French Law, Ottoman Law, proved invaluable in assisting the early Jewish settlement in Palestine. In this regard, he was a key intermediary between Lord Rothschild and Arab notables in brokering the purchase of land for Jewish immigrants to the Rothschild settlements in Ottoman Palestine. He was held in high regard by several families of Arab notables, such as the Husayni, the Khalidi and the Nashashibi, with whom he negotiated land purchases. He cooperated closely with the Hovevei Zion movement. Antébi however was opposed to the political Zionist project as developed by Theodor Herzl and his movement, regarding it as a threat to the slow incremental'If our Israelites pursue the end and not the appearance, they must move through progressive colonisation to arrive at an administrative and, at the same time, political, preponderance' (Si nos Israélites poursuivent le but et non la teinte, ils devraient passer par la colonisation progressive pour arriver à la prépondérance administrative et même politique). Elizabeth Antébi, Albert Antébi (1873-1919) ou la religion de la France. Lettres., Letter of 11 July 1909 development of a Jewish homeland. He disliked the idleness of many European immigrants, and thought their growing, subsidized presence in Palestine risked provoking an antisemitic reaction throughout the Ottoman world.Letter of 19 August 1908, cited Elizabeth Antébi, Albert Antébi (1873-1919) ou la religion de la France. Lettres.. Cf.'Believe me, all the Arab race from Baghdad to Yemen, is prepared to tolerate a fresh outburst of Jewish economic activity, but will prove to be savage in the face of an allocation to our coreligionists of a certain political equality - not to say autonomy' (Croyez-moi, toute cette race arabe, depuis Bagdad jusqu’au Yémen, tolèrerait la recrudescence de l’activité juive économique, mais serait féroce devant l’attribution même d’une certaine égalité - je ne dis pas autonomie - politique de nos coreligionnaires. Elizabeth Antébi, Albert Antébi (1873-1919) ou la religion de la France. Lettres., Letter of 11 July 1909. Indeed he regarded the publicity surrounding Zionism as responsible for the rise of antisemitism in the Holy Land, and advised a strategy of silence if emigration were to continue without arousing local resistance.'If Zionists really did desire (effective) action, then they would stop talking and adopt (a policy of) silence. They've already bred antisemitism, and will now make a Jewish question for us'(Si les sionistes voulaient réellement l’action, ils renonceraient à la parole et adopteraient le silence. Ils ont engendré déjà l’antisémitisme, ils nous créeront la question juive). Elizabeth Antébi, Albert Antébi (1873-1919) ou la religion de la France. Lettres., Letter of 13 Septembre 1909 As early as 1901 he wrote:'Zionism has been created, its leaders say, in order to tighten the bonds of Judaism: the only result has been to stimulate the birth of struggles between (different) nationalities'.'On a créé le sionisme, soi-disant pour resserrer les liens du Judaïsme ; on n’a réussi qu’à faire naître les luttes de nationalités.' letter of 29 December 1901, cited Elizabeth Antébi, Albert Antébi (1873-1919) ou la religion de la France. Lettres. He described his own labours in building up a renewed Jewish presence in the Holy Land in the following terms: > 'I desire to achieve the conquest of Zion by economic means, not > politically; the Jerusalem I would cherish is the Jerusalem of history and > the spirit, not the modern temporal Jerusalem. I want to be a Jewish deputy > in an Ottoman parliament, and not in the Jewish temple of Mount Moriah. > Ottoman Jews should have the same rights, responsibilities and hopes as the > Jews of England, Germany and France.

Lettres., In the First World War he served on the front line in the Caucasus in 1917, where he became acquainted with General Mustafa Kemal. On the eve of that war he wrote that Palestine would be the last province to be taken from Turkey. Political and commercial considerations suggested that control over the area would accrue to France and England. He feared that the high numbers of German and Russian immigrants would secure for those nations a powerful influence that would deal a mortal blow to the eventual securing of a Jewish majority.Elizabeth Antébi, Albert Antébi (1873-1919) ou la religion de la France. Lettres., Letter of April 1913 He died, aged 45, of typhus, in Istanbul, while engaged in directing a large rescue and repatriation operation. In his testament, he expressed the hope that Palestine would develop along the lines of the Swiss cantonal system, under an interallied protectorate or French-English condominium, which would allocate lands without proprietors to immigrants, while keeping the country free of German and Russian communists.

Under the initiative of Chaim Weiszburg, a leader of the Zionist movement, Uj Kelet was launched as a weekly on December 19, 1918. It became a daily in 1920. The first editor was Béla Székely, who was succeeded in 1919 by Ernő Márton. From 1927 until the end of its Transylvanian period, the editor was Ferenc Jámbor. After the Hungarian annexation of Cluj in 1940, the Horthy regime banned the paper because of its strong Zionist leanings. Márton emigrated to Palestine (Eretz Israel) after World War II, and in 1948, the paper reemerged under his editorship with David Schon in Tel Aviv.

When the American Indians first arrived in what is now Iowa more than 13,000 years ago, they were hunters and gatherers living in a Pleistocene glacial landscape. By the time European explorers visited Iowa, American Indians were largely settled farmers with complex economic, social, and political systems. This transformation happened gradually. During the Archaic period (10,500–2,800 years ago) American Indians adapted to local environments and ecosystems, slowly becoming more sedentary as populations increased. More than 3,000 years ago, during the Late Archaic period, American Indians in Iowa began utilizing domesticated plants. The subsequent Woodland period saw an increase on the reliance on agriculture and social complexity, with increased use of mounds, ceramics, and specialized subsistence. During the Late Prehistoric period (beginning about AD 900) increased use of maize and social changes led to social flourishing and nucleated settlements. The arrival of European trade goods and diseases in the Protohistoric period led to dramatic population shifts and economic and social upheaval, with the arrival of new tribes and early European explorers and traders. During the Historical period European traders and American Indians in Iowa gave way to American settlers and Iowa was transformed into an agricultural state. Iowa archaeologists Ellison Orr’s and Theodore Lewis’ 1910 sketch of effigy mounds near McGregor, Iowa, now part of Effigy Mounds National Monument. Archaeologists have studied the prehistory of Iowa since the mid-19th century, when large American Indian mounds were first observed along the Mississippi. Early archaeologists such as S.V. Proudfit and Theodore Lewis documented large sites such as earthworks, mounds, and earthlodges.Proudfit, S. V. (1880) Antiquities of the Missouri Bluffs. American Antiquarian 3:271–280; Lewis, Theodore H. (1885) Effigy Mounds in Iowa. Science 6(146):453–454 Truly systematic recording of Iowa sites began with Charles R. Keyes and Ellison Orr’s surveys and excavations beginning in the 1920s. Documenting hundreds of sites, often just before they disappeared under the plow, Keyes’ and Orr’s work led to the formation of the Iowa Archaeological Survey, the Iowa Archeological Society, and the designation of Effigy Mounds National Monument. After their deaths in 1951, the Survey was disbanded, and their efforts were continued by the University of Iowa’s Department of Sociology and Anthropology, which formed the Office of the State ArchaeologistIowa Office of the State Archaeologist, (OSA) in 1959. The OSA maintains an extensive list of more than 23,000 recorded archaeological sites in Iowa, and conducts survey and excavation across the state. Other institutions conducting archaeological research in Iowa include the State Historical Society of Iowa, the Iowa Archeological Society, the University of Iowa, Iowa State University, Grinnell College, Luther College, and private archaeological firms. Professional archaeologists in Iowa are represented by the Association of Iowa Archaeologists.Association of Iowa Archaeologists, Iowa archaeology grew dramatically beginning in the 1960s with the introduction of Cultural Resources Management legislation that required archaeological survey and excavation at many federal projects in Iowa. Paleoindian (13,500–10,500 years ago) Clovis points from the Rummells-Maske Cache Site, Cedar County, Iowa. Paleoindian hunters and gatherers were the first occupants of Iowa, entering the state at the end of the Pleistocene glacial period. At the time the state was covered by tundra, conifer forests, and deciduous forests. Areas immediately north of Des Moines extending to Minnesota were covered by the receding Des Moines Lobe, a large glacier system. Highly mobile, their sites are scattered across Iowa and are noted for their large stone points. While Paleoindians were traditionally viewed as big game hunters, more recent research suggests much of their subsistence was derived from small game and wild plants. Paleoindian points are found throughout Iowa, but almost no intact Paleoindian sites have been excavated, probably because they were ephemeral and are now either destroyed by plowing or are very deeply buried in river valleys.Iowa's Earliest Residents, Clovis and other Early Paleoindian The oldest artifacts found in Iowa are Clovis points, large lanceolate points found occasionally in all parts of the state except for the Des Moines Lobe. Possible sources of game were giant Pleistocene megafauna, including mammoth, mastodon, and giant forms of bison, all of which are now extinct. While widespread, only two Clovis sites have been excavated in Iowa. The Rummells-Maske site is a Clovis site in Cedar County; unfortunately, this site was damaged by plowing, although 20 points and point fragments were recovered.Anderson, Adrian D., and Joseph A. Tiffany (1972) Rummells-Maske: A Clovis Find-Spot in Iowa. Plains Anthropologist 17:55–59 The Carlisle Clovis Cache Site in Warren County contained 38 unfinished stone tools that appear to date to the Clovis period, but these results have not yet been published.The Carlisle Cache, Other Iowa Early Paleoindian points include Gainey, a point that appears to be intermediate between Clovis and Folsom. Gainey points were also recovered at Rummells-Maske. While Folsom points are found throughout Iowa, especially western Iowa, none have been excavated in a well-preserved site.Alex 2000:49–50; Morrow, Julie, \\"The Early Paleoindian Period\\" Dalton and other Late Paleoindian At the beginning of the glacial-free Holocene Epoch, humans in Iowa utilized projectile point found throughout the mid-continent, including Dalton, Fayette, Agate Basin, and Hell Gap. Humans were still highly mobile, and by this time most of the Pleistocene megafauna had gone extinct. As with the Early Paleoindian period, no intact Late Paleoindian sites have been excavated in Iowa.Alex 2000:50–53 Archaic Period The Archaic is the longest period of Iowa prehistory, lasting about 8,000 years. Overall, populations appear to have increased in Iowa during the Archaic, despite a changing climate. During this time American Indians transitioned from highly mobile hunters and gatherers with large ranges towards a focus on local resources and ecosystems. Domesticated plants appeared in Iowa towards the end of the Archaic. Early Archaic (10,500–7,500 years ago) During the Early Archaic period regional variation in point forms is seen in Iowa, and Indians adapted to more localized forms of hunting and gathering while probably maintaining seasonal movements from camp to camp. Common stone tool types are Corner-notched St. Charles points and Thebes Knives. Soon Hardin and Kirk points appear in Iowa as well.Morrow, Toby; \\"The Late Paleoindian/Early Archaic Period\\" Excavated Early Archaic sites in Iowa include the Soldow Site,Flanders, Richard E.

Plains Anthropologist 5:65–70 Middle Archaic (7,500–5,000 years ago) Temperatures rose in the mid-continent during the Middle Archaic, a warming trend known as the Hypsithermal. Grasslands expanded east, forests became less common, and many Iowa lakes shrank or disappeared. Humans responded by diversifying their subsistence strategy: eastern Iowa saw a shift towards river resources, and western Iowa towards Plains resources.

American Anthropologist 75:1221–1253 Late Archaic (5,000–2,800 years ago) In the Late Archaic the climate became more similar to modern with the end of the Hypsithermal. The number of Late Archaic Sites increased in Iowa, perhaps reflective of increased populations allowed by climate change and new subsistence strategies. The Late Archaic sees the first indication of mound building in Iowa, as well as direct evidence of domesticated plants, and large, long-term settlements. The Red Ocher Culture appeared in northeast Iowa, associated with copper artifacts and mound building. Numerous Late Archaic sites have been excavated in eastern Iowa, some showing the gradual adaptation of cultigens, including squash, little barley, marsh elder, and barnyard grass.Crops of Ancient Iowa, Sites with evidence for early cultigens in Iowa include the Edgewater Park Site in Coralville,Whittaker, William E., Michael T.

Midcontinental Journal of Archaeology 23(1):45–88 and the Sand Run Slough West Site.Alex 2000:76–77 In western Iowa, Late Archaic sites are common, however large bison killing or processing sites are less common than before, and there is little evidence for the use of domesticated plants.Alex 2000:78–79 Woodland Period Woodland conical mounds at Effigy Mounds National Monument, Sny Magill Unit, Clayton County, Iowa. During the Woodland period, many American Indians in Iowa shifted away from hunting and gathering and used more domesticated plants, although wild food was still important. Ceramics, the bow and arrow, burial mounds, and evidence of political and social hierarchy became common at Woodland sites in Iowa. Early Woodland (800 BC–200 BC) The Early Woodland period saw the introduction of ceramics to Iowa, including Marion Thick and Black Sand types. Marion Thick may have originated with the nucleated Late Archaic cultures of the Upper Midwest, and was widespread in distribution.Alex 2000:88; Klippel, Walter E. (1972) An Early Woodland Period Manifestation in the Prairie Peninsula. Journal of the Iowa Archeological Society 19:1–91 Early Woodland Indians in eastern Iowa built large burial mounds in the Mississippi River region, and participated in long-distance trade of exotic raw material. This long-distance trade may have been the forerunner of the later Havanna-Hopewell trading sphere. In north- central Iowa, Early Woodland peoples appear to have interacted more directly with the Prairie Lakes region of Minnesota. Numerous Early Woodland sites have been excavated in Iowa, including the Gast Spring Site, and many sites which have not been formally published.Alex 2000:87–98 Middle Woodland (200 BC–400 AD) The Middle Woodland Indians of eastern Iowa participated at the edge of the Havana and Hopewell interaction networks. This cultural connection to the East is seen in the construction of large mounds, earthworks, and the trade of exotic goods over very long distances. There were several large earthwork enclosures in Iowa along the Mississippi that date to the Middle Woodland period, but none in the interior of the state, indicating Iowa is the western edge of Havana-Hopewell influence. The Toolesboro Mound Group in Louisa County included a large octagonal earthen enclosure that covered several acres; earthworks of this style are indicative of the monumental construction once seen in Havana, Illinois along the Illinois River and sites in the Ohio River drainage including Chillicothe and Newark, Ohio. Hopewell trading networks were quite extensive, with obsidian from the Yellowstone area, copper from Lake Superior, and shells from the Gulf Coast appearing in Middle Woodland Iowa sites. Sites in eastern Iowa appeared to nucleate, vacating much of the hinterlands.Alex 2000:100–109 Western Iowa appears to have been not directly involved in this exchange network, and the Havana- Hopewell flourishing did not extend much above the Kansas City area of the Missouri River.Alex 2000:112–115 Late Woodland (400–1250 AD) The Late Woodland Period was once considered to be relatively unimportant and uninteresting compared to earlier and later periods, but recent research shows unexpected cultural complexity.Benn and Green 2000 Late Woodland sites are more dispersed than Middle Woodland sites, but they are apparently more numerous. Gone are the complex earthworks and long-distance trade networks, but this does not appear to be a cultural collapse, since Late Woodland sites and artifact types overlap with and transition from Middle Woodland sites. Technical changes of the Late Woodland include the use of true arrow heads, thinner and larger ceramics with less elaborate decorations, and the adaptation of new crops, including maize.Alex 2000:115–118 Numerous regional variations and phases have been defined in Iowa, based in large extent on differences of ceramic form and decoration. Excavations at Late Woodland sites are common, some of these sites showing surprising complexity. The Gast Farm Site excavations revealed a complex settlement associated with a midden of refuse 100 m in diameter. Large storage and food processing pits, trash middens, and other features were excavated. Occupants utilized acorns, other nuts and fruits, goosefoot, little barley, maygrass, sunflower, fish, birds, deer, muskrat, and turtle. There was little evidence of long-distance trade.Benn, David W., and William Green (2000) Late Woodland Cultures in Iowa.

Office of the State Archaeologist, University of Iowa, Iowa City Mound building became more common during the Late Woodland Period, large groups of mounds appeared including the Slinde Mound Group, and the Fish Farm Mound Group. Effigy Mounds The Late Woodland in Iowa is perhaps best known for effigy mounds, large, low mounds shaped like animals such as birds and bears. Effigy mounds are distributed across southern Wisconsin, northern Illinois, and northeast Iowa. A large concentration of mounds in several groups is preserved at Effigy Mounds National Monument. Like most mounds in Iowa, excavation reveals that these mounds were commonly used as sacred burial locations but contain few artifacts.Lenzendorf, Dennis (2000) Effigy Mounds: A Guide to Effigy Mounds National Monument. Eastern National, Fort Washington, Pennsylvania Recent ground-penetrating radar survey of selected mounds at Effigy Mounds National Monument reveal that many are badly disturbed, but others appear to be comparatively intact.Whittaker, William E., and Glenn R.

Newsletter of the Iowa Archeological Society 57(3):1–2 Late Prehistoric (900–1600) Map of archaeology of Fort Des Moines in downtownDes Moines Maize appears to have been the catalyst for change in the Late Prehistoric period in Iowa. While maize had been a minor crop in the Woodland Period, many archaeologists believe new varieties of maize were introduced to the region that produced higher yields, allowing for a population boom. This increase in population, combined with the potential for surplus and growing tensions over control of territory, appears to have led to large nucleated settlements throughout the eastern U.S.Alex 2000:142–145 Although this manifested itself earliest along the Mississippi south of Iowa, the earliest Late Prehistoric cultures appeared in the western part of the state.Alex 2000:138–139 Great Oasis (ca. 900–1100) Great Oasis sites appeared in the Missouri River drainage, and have attributes of both Late Woodland and Late Prehistoric cultures. Great Oasis cultures extended through the eastern Plains from Iowa to South Dakota. Developing independently from the eastern Mississippian cultures, Great Oasis sites display large sites along major stream terraces, increased reliance on agriculture combined with hunting and gathering, substantial pit earth lodges, and a transition from Late Woodland to Late Prehistoric ceramic forms. Overall, Great Oasis appears to have been a regional adaptation of new forms of farming and settlement patterns, including seasonal occupation of different ecological zones, that includes aspects of Late Woodland and the subsequent Middle Missouri Tradition.Anderson, Adrian D. (1961) The Glenwood Sequence: a Local Sequence for a Series of Archaeological Manifestations in Mills County, Iowa. Journal of the Iowa Archeological Society 10:1–101Henning, Dale R. (2005) The Evolution of the Plains Village Tradition. In North American Archaeology, Timothy Pauketat and D. D. Loren (eds.), pp. 161–186. Blackwell, Boston Mill Creek and Glenwood (1100–1300) Reconstructed Glenwood earthlodge, Glenwood, Iowa In northwestern Iowa, Great Oasis underwent dramatic changes as Mill Creek sites appeared. While Mill Creek has many stylistic similarities with Great Oasis and some Mill Creek sites contain Great Oasis ceramic forms, Mill Creek sites are substantially different. Mill Creek sites became nucleated, often fortified, had a much higher dependence on maize and bison hunting, show substantial evidence of long-distance trade, and appear to have been occupied year-round. The Phipps and Chan-Ya-Ta sites are classic examples. Glenwood culture sites in southwest Iowa near the Missouri River appear to be unrelated to the earlier Great Oasis sites, and are notable for their large earthlodge sites. Glenwood sites appear to have been more oriented in lifeways and trade with the Central Plains Tradition cultures to the west than with the Mississippian cultures to the southeast. Around 1300 AD Mill Creek and Glenwood sites in Iowa disappeared, replaced by the rapidly spreading Oneota cultures.Alex 2000Green, William (1991) The Paul Rowe Archaeological Collection: A Key to Central Plains Prehistory.

Journal of the Iowa Archeological Society 49:11–26 Oneota (1250–1700) Excavation of the Oneota component of the Birds Run Site in Des Moines Very large Mississippian centers appeared around AD 1000, with enormous earthen pyramids, palisades, and extreme social hierarchy. The earliest large Mississippian center was Cahokia, east of St. Louis. Cahokia appears to have dominated trade in the upper Mississippi, with satellite or closely aligned settlements as far as Aztalan in Wisconsin.Emerson, T. E., and R. B. Lewis (eds.) (1991) Cahokia and the Hinterlands: Middle Mississippian Cultures of the Midwest. University of Illinois Press, Urbana, Illinois In Iowa, there is little evidence of Mississippian occupation, and the Late Woodland lasts longer in the east than in the west. This is puzzling, given the proximity to Mississippian cultures; it is possible that the nearby presence of the large, hierarchal Mississippian trading network inhibited local development. After the decline of the Cahokia network after AD 1250 the local Late Woodland populations expanded in complexity, developing large nucleated villages and their own trading network, known as Upper Mississippian Oneota. Oneota, named by Charles Keyes for a river in northeast Iowa, was a large cultural manifestation that covered the Upper Midwest at the edge of the Mississippian cultures. Oneota sites are easily identifiable by the globular, shell-tempered pots, which typically have strap handles and incised designs. Pots of this kind were well designed for the cooking of porridge and foods made from the various cultivated foods of the area. Important Oneota sites in Iowa include Kingston,Straffin, Dean F.

It is widely accepted that the Oneota were the ancestors of modern American Indian tribes associated with Iowa, including the Ioway, Ho-Chunk (Winnebago), Otoe, Missouria, and Omaha. Protohistoric (1600–1800) Catlinite pipe, probably Ioway, from the Protohistoric Wanampito Site (13BM16), Bremer County, Iowa. Protohistoric refers to the period when American Indians were exposed to European trade items and large population shifts occurred because of introduced European diseases and warfare, but there is very little direct written documentation. Explorers such as Marquette and Joliet occasionally documented American Indians along the Mississippi in Iowa, but it was not until the early 19th century that regular written accounts of American Indians in Iowa became common. American Indians in the early Protohistoric period continued many aspects of Oneota culture, but soon almost all indigenous technology disappeared, including ceramics and stone tool production.Alex 2000:211–226 It was during this period that the Meskwaki (Fox) and Sauk appeared in eastern Iowa, displaced from their homelands in the east.

The Museum is a venue for promoting Iroquois art and artists, and a meeting place for all peoples to celebrate Iroquois culture and diversity. As an anthropological institution, it is informed by research on archaeology, history, and the common creative spirit of modern artists and craftspeople. The Iroquois Indian Museum opened in 1981 in the historic homeland of the Mohawk Indians, one of the original Five Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy. About The Iroquois Indian Museum, which opened in its Howes Cave location in 1992, is built in the form of a traditional longhouse, important to Iroquois culture. These were used by extended families for their residences. Some longhouses were reserved for tribal councils and community meetings or ceremonies. Once based in New York, most members of the Iroquois tribes now live on First Nations reserves in Quebec and Ontario, Canada; others live in New York, Wisconsin and Oklahoma. The museum was built at a cost of $1.3 million. It holds the largest collection of Iroquois art in the United States, and is designed to teach and interpret the culture of the Six Tribes of the Iroquois. Also located in the museum is the Iroquois Performing Arts Amphitheater, used for music and dance works based on traditional practices related to the Iroquois culture. Ancestors were in their territory for 10,000 years. The museum's exhibits also embrace modern culture, such as one in 2008 that featured Native American baseball players.

It develops hardware and software for networks that are fixed, wireless, or packet-based. It provides IP services to help mobile carriers with network signaling, policy control, and subscriber data management. The company, founded in Calabasas, California in 1971, was acquired by Oracle in 2013, from Siris Capital Group. Corporate history Founding by Jean- Claude Asscher  In 1961, Jean-Claude Asscher founded Tekelec-Airtronic, SA, a French electronics company with emphasis on the aviation industry. In 1977, Tekelec, Inc. was founded in Calabasas, California as a sales office for Tekelec-Airtronic. Tekelec was then founded in 1979 by Philip Black and Jean- Claude Asscher, half owned by Tekelec-Airtronic but still independent. It was founded as a North American company specializing in telecommunications products, such as telecommunications test equipment initially. Tekelec was initially financed by proceeds earned by Jean-Claude Asscher through Tekelec- Airtronic. For many years, Jean-Claude Asscher was president, CEO, and chairman of the board of directors of both Tekelec-Airtronic and Tekelec. In recent years Jean-Claude Asscher has served as only chairman of Tekelec's board of directors while continuing to be the president of Tekelec-Airtronic's board of directors as well as its chairman. Philip Black spinoff and going public Asscher found Philip Black, in the early 1980s, who was tasked with re-creating the U.S Tekelec company so that could successfully sell Tekelec Airtronic products in the U.S., or create their own testing products. Philip Black assembled a core crew of people, and his team created, marketed and sold the protocol simulator analyzers, named Chameleon and Chameleon II which fueled the sales of Tekelec for over 10 years. Tekelec successfully competed with two pre-existing competitors, Atlantic Research and Idacom, to become the dominant player in this specific type of test equipment. The company went public in the mid-1980s. Tekelec later transitioned to operating equipment in the form of Signalling System 7 products, under the initial lead of Peter Vicars, who followed Philip Black as CEO. In 1985, Tekelec established a subsidiary in Tokyo, Japan. In 1986 the company went public.  Peter N Vicars as CEO  Peter N Vicars joined Tekelec and served as its President and Chief Executive Officer from July 1987 until January 1994. During this tenure revenues increased from $13M to $58M while maintaining six years of double digit profitability within its core business of testing solutions which represented 85% of corporate revenues. Vicars acquired and integrated a leading SS7 company (Protocol Technologies) to strengthen Tekelec's market position in cellular and switching technology. Based on that acquisition, Vicars guided the entry into a new market for the corporation. The Eagle platform and revenues grew to $12 million over the first year of product shipments. Vicars is also credited for implementing an expense reduction program, due to the switching product startup development and initial market entry costs, which returned the corporation to profitability. In March 1992, the company created the subsidiary Tekelec Canada. In March 1998, Michael L. Margolis became CEO. In 2001, T-Mobile Germany signed a deal with Tekelec. In February 2003, Frederick M. Lax became CEO. In May 2003, Tekelec said it would buy a controlling share of Santera, therefore creating a subsidiary to sell products such as softswitches, media gateways, and signaling gateways. Tekelec opened a subsidiary in India in 2004. In 2004, Tekelec acquired the softswitch company Taqua Systems in Richardson, Texas for $85 million in cash. At the time, Tekelec remained based in Calabasas, California under CEO Fred Lax. Lax said that Taqua's focus on small Class 5 switches would complement Tekelec's business in Santera Class 4 packet switch businesses. In August 2005, Tekelec agreed to buy Steleus Group for $65 million. The deal added switches to Tekelec's product offerings. Ronald J. de Lange Ronald J. de Lange joined Tekelec in July 2005 and served as executive vice president Global Business Solutions before being promoted to CEO in May 2011. On August 3, 2005, Tekelec purchased German and Czech-based iptelorg GmbH, developer of leading-edge Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) routing software, securing a critical IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) capability for Tekelec. Franco (Frank) Plastina Franco Plastina joined Tekelec as president and CEO and as a director in February 2006, taking over from former CEO Fred Lax. Lax had resigned in January 2006, when Tekelec relocated its headquarters from California to Cary. Plastina stepped down from his position as President and CEO of Tekelec in January 2011 following poor results where sales of the main product line, Eagle, dropped off much more sharply than expected, before replacement products (such as policy) became fully available. Krish Prabhu, a member of the Board of Directors, was appointed Interim President and CEO. In April 2006, Tekelec sold its subsidiary IEX Corporation for $200 million. In May 2006, the company said it had restated its financial results for 2003, 2004, and 2005 after accounting errors were found. Acquisitions In 2008, Tekelec's number portability solution was deployed in carriers serving 750 million subscribers, out of more than two billion global subscribers who had number porting capability and as of March 2009, Tekelec had 79 number portability customers in 28 countries, and most recently announced delivery of number portability solutions to T-Mobile Germany. On February 5, 2008, Tekelec acquired substantially all of the assets of Estacado Systems, LLC, a software development company led by a team that has been instrumental in the creation of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and a number of its advanced features. December 17, 2008: Tekelec acquired mBalance, a Netherlands-based developer of mobile messaging solutions, for US$38 million. In May 2011, about 65% of staff were laid off and over the following year most of the remainder departed, being replaced by contractors; the company has since been resold. In early May 2010, Tekelec acquired the company Camiant and the subscriber data management (SDM) company Blueslice Networks. Frank Plastine was Tekelec's CEO at the time. Shareholder class action lawsuit On January 6, 2011 a securities fraud class action lawsuit was filed on behalf of Tekelec investors. The lawsuit alleges that Tekelec misled the investing public about its business dealings in emerging markets (namely India), thereby inflating the price of TKLC stock. The lawsuit claims that these misleading statements made by Tekelec amount to a violation of US securities laws, and caused significant financial losses to holders of Tekelec stock. The share price in Q4 2010 ran at about 18 dollars. By the start of Q2 2011, the share price ran at about 7.75 dollars. In November 2011, investors led by Siris Capital Group agreed to buy Tekelec for $780 million, making the company private. At the time, Tekelec was based in Morrisville, North Carolina, with CEO Ron de Lange. On January 27, 2012, Tekelec announced the completion of its acquisition by a consortium led by Siris Capital Group, LLC (\\"Siris\\") and including affiliates of The ComVest Group, funds and accounts managed by GSO Capital Partners LP, Sankaty Advisors LLC, ZelnickMedia and other Siris limited partners and affiliates, in a transaction valued at approximately $780 million. Acquisition by Oracle On March 25, 2013, Oracle announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire Tekelec. Tekelec joined the Oracle Communications unit. Recognition In March 2011, Tekelec's Diameter Signaling Router was recognized by the Frost & Sullivan \\"New Product Innovation Award, Diameter Routing\\" for its superior ability to help operators overcome Diameter signaling challenges in LTE networks. Frost & Sullivan independently identified Diameter Routing as a new award category due to at least 60 LTE networks anticipated to be in commercial service by the end of 2012, creating \\"rapid uptake in Diameter signaling.\\" In October 2010, it was announced that MetroPCS selected Tekelec's Diameter Signaling Router for deployment in the first U.S. LTE network. In June 2012, Tekelec was awarded Most Innovative Company by Pipeline Publishing's Innovation Awards. A panel of service providers and industry analysts selected Tekelec as the company that best embraces and promotes innovation throughout its organization. Industry research and consultancy firm Analysys Mason named Tekelec as the global market leader with 35 percent market share of real-time connection number portability solutions.

Essentially a half miler doing the metric mile for stamina, Sequeira also excelled in the 5,000 metres. Born on 6 February 1940 in Bombay, Eddie studied at: St. Paul's High School from where he joined the Central Railway as mechanical apprentice. Sports were compulsory for the Railway employees and Sequeira proved a natural athlete. He took up athletics seriously in 1959 and by 1963 had created new marks for the 800 and 1,500 at the Central Railway meet and then went on to repeat the performances at the Inter-Railway Meet in Delhi, He clocked 1:52.6 for the half mile and 3:49.4 for the 1,500 metres. His next step was the National titles and he duly won both the events in the National Games, retaining his hold on the events from 1963 to 1973. He set a new record in the 1500 metres in 1966, his time of 3.43.7 being even faster than the existing Asian mark. This record remained in the books for well over 35 years before Bahadur Prasad updated it during the Permit Meet in Delhi. Eddie Sequeira began his long association with Tata Steel in 1964, an association which proved very fruitful to him. His athletics career took an upswing and he became a permanent member of the Indian team. He represented the country against Russia in 1965 and then went to the Commonwealth Games in Kingston in 1966, the year in which he created the national mark in the 1,500 metres. The 1966 Asian Games in Bangkok proved to be a disaster for Sequeira who was forced to retire when in full flight in the final and had to settle for the award of\\" the Unlucky Athlete of the Games\\". The Indian star had obviously been pushed and the organizers perhaps thought fit to compensate him with the most unlikely labelled award. Sequeira then went to Ceylon for a dual meet and won the 1,500 metres and the next year, created national mark or 14:38 in the 5000 metres in another such competition on the Ceylon tracks. He was captain of the Indian team to Malaysia and Singapore and also a member of the Asian team to West Germany he went back to Bangkok for Games and wiped out bitter memories of the previous edition of the Games with a Silver Medal In the 5000 meters. Coached by the German coach Otto Peitzer, himself a world record holder, Sequeira went to Munich Olympics in 1972 where he finished 11th in the 3rd heat of 5,000 meters clocking 14:01.4s. Munich however left other memories for Sequeira, of the killings of Israeli athletes by Palestinian terrorists. An outstanding sportsman, Edward Sequeira contributed much to Indian athletics as a coach also, He attended a coaching conference in Tokyo in 1979. He was also on the Committee of the Amateur Federation of India, An officer with Tata Iron and Steel Co Mumbai, Sequeira was honoured the Maharashtra Government Shiv Chhatrapati Award and coveted Arjuna Award came in 1971. http://www.mynews.in/News/Star_Olympian_Eddie_Sequeira_recuperating_from_burn_injuries!_N38288.html My News References Sports Reference Category:1940 births Category:Living people Category:Recipients of the Arjuna Award Category:Athletes from Mumbai Category:Indian male middle-distance runners Category:Olympic athletes of India Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1972 Summer Olympics Category:Commonwealth Games competitors for India Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games Category:Asian Games medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1970 Asian Games Category:Asian Games silver medalists for India Category:Medalists at the 1970 Asian Games ","title":"Edward Sequeira"},{"id":"17733606","text":"1931 earthquake may refer to: *1931 Hawke's Bay earthquake *1931 Dogger Bank earthquake *1931 Nicaragua earthquake See also *List of earthquakes in 1931 ","title":"1931 earthquake"},{"id":"17733634","text":"\\"Roger Malvin's Burial\\", as first published in 1832 \\"Roger Malvin's Burial\\" is a short story by American author Nathaniel Hawthorne. It was first published anonymously in 1832 before its inclusion in the 1846 collection Mosses from an Old Manse. The tale concerns two fictional colonial survivors returning home after the historical battle known as Battle of Pequawket. Plot summary Following Battle of Pequawket (Hawthorne uses the name Lovell's Fight) in 1725, two survivors of the battle struggle to return home. Roger Malvin and Reuben Bourne are both wounded and weak, and they have little hope that they will survive. They rest near a rock that resembles an enormous tombstone. Malvin, a much older man, asks Reuben to leave him to die alone, since his wounds are mortal. Reuben insists that he will stay with Malvin as long as he remains alive, but the old man knows that this would mean death for both of them. Malvin convinces Reuben to leave. Reuben survives. Because he has not honored his promise to bury the old man, he is not at peace. His unease is exacerbated by his failure to tell his fiancée, Dorcas (Malvin's daughter) that he left her father to die. Reuben is considered a brave man by his compatriots, but inside he feels that he has failed them. Dorcas and Reuben marry, but Reuben's guilt-induced moodiness renders him unfit for normal society. Many years later, when Reuben and Dorcas's son is already grown, Reuben decides that they will move away from the town and settle on a piece of land by themselves. They travel through wilderness. While encamped, Reuben and his son wander into the forest while Dorcas prepares a meal. They become separated. Reuben thinks he hears a deer in the brush and fires his gun, but discovers that he has killed his own son. As he observes the terrain, he realizes it is the same place where he had left Roger Malvin many years before. Publication history \\"Roger Malvin's Burial\\" was likely conceived as early as 1825, the year Hawthorne graduated from Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, and the 100th anniversary of the historical event that inspired its plot.Wineapple, Brenda. Hawthorne: A Life. Random House: New York, 2003: 67. The story was first published anonymously in the annual gift book The Token in 1832. Hawthorne published Twice-Told Tales in 1837, which collected several of his stories previously included in gift books, though it excluded many of his darker stories like \\"Roger Malvin's Burial\\", \\"My Kinsman, Major Molineux\\", and \\"Young Goodman Brown\\", each of which has become recognized as one of Hawthorne's early masterpiece by modern critics.Mellow, James R. Nathaniel Hawthorne in His Times. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1980: 77. \\"Roger Malvin's Burial\\" was not collected in book form until 1846 with the publication of Mosses from an Old Manse (1846).

Its mission is to help children escape from crisis by offering a range of services including rescue from slavery, shelter, education and employment. History The foundation was begun by an Australian school teacher, Michael Brosowski. He came to Vietnam in 2002 to teach English at the University of Economics. While there he met many street children, and began to teach free classes with one of his students, Pham Sy Chung. They taught maths, English, yoga, and art. They also formed a football team to promote a sense of sportsmanship and teamwork, while also getting to know new children living on the street. Initially 3 teenage boys turned up for these games, but soon over 40 came each weekend. In 2016 their team, Blue Dragon United, will play its 2000th game. By early 2003, Brosowski had quit his university job to concentrate full-time on the needs of the street children. Word spread and more kept arriving to seek help, coming with medical problems, educational needs, and often needing a place to sleep. As the number grew, it became clear that many of the children coming for help would need long-term support. On June 2, 2003, The Big Room was opened, a residence for six former street kids. It was funded for its first year by a $5000 donation from two expatriate women, Chantelle and Danielle.

In early 2005 Chung left Vietnam to study in the US, and Brosowski hired two full-time staff to replace him. With these two staff, a combined office and drop-in centre was opened in March of that year. In late 2005, Browski and Va Ta, a Vietnamese law student, rescued a child from central Vietnam who had been trafficked by slave labourers in Ho Chi Minh City.

Anti- Trafficking Award: Van Ngoc Ta Retrieved May 26, 2016 In May 2019, Blue Dragon announced that two human traffickers in Vietnam's Central Highlands had both been sentenced to 12 years in jail. Blue Dragon had rescued two of their victims and represented both in court. In September 2019, Blue Dragon made a partnership agreement with the Australian Speech-language pathology clinic Speakable, so the clinic would become a member of supporting organizations. The clinic's owner, Binh Doan, has demonstrated interest on that partnership because of his own Vietnamese background. Blue Dragon Children's Foundation now supports over 1500 children and youth around Vietnam, particularly in Hanoi, Bac Ninh, Hue and Dien Bien. Activities Blue Dragon's main aim is to rescue children from crisis situations in the short term and then get them into school, training and ultimately employment in the long term. To achieve this, the organisation offers a range of direct services. Accommodation is provided, or repair/refurbishment of their existing home if living conditions simply aren't suitable. Out-of-school tuition is provided to help children study. Books and stationery are given to those who can't afford them, and scholarships are provided both for children and tertiary students. Medical care and nutritional support are provided to those who need it. Child trafficking is a major issue in SE Asia, and Blue Dragon tackles this both within Vietnam and internationally. From 2005 to January 2016, Blue Dragon rescued over 500 children and young adults from forced labour, forced marriages, and brothels. Blue Dragon operates a drop-in centre for street children in Hanoi, where they can play, shower, study and take part in social activities. In addition to these direct services, Blue Dragon staff offer training opportunities to government officials on issues such as human trafficking and child abuse; and work with legislators to revise and improve the country's legal framework for children.

It is located near to the east-northeast of the town centrum, south of Nuuk Airport, approximately outside of the city centre.  History  The Qinngorput area was a popular camping and hunting site for many years before it was incorporated into Nuuk in 2005. Being the most recent district incorporated with the city, it attracts younger people and the focus is on families with school-aged children. This is reflected in the demographics; it has on average the youngest population of all Nuuk districts. Qinngorput does not have many inhabitants, less than 200, but the number of buildings is steadily growing. When finished the area will consist of 1200 apartments, with a planned potential capacity of 10.000 inhabitants, if needed. The latest expansion of the district is along the south-eastern shores of Malenebugten, with 300 new apartments to be handed over in August 2013. The district is the newest neighbourhood of the growing city; the entire area consists of buildings erected since the mid-1990s and is a part of the new Nuuk city planning strategy. The overwhelming majority of the housing in the district is privately owned. The nearby Nuussuaq district was likewise purposefully erected in the late 1980s in order to minimize auxiliary city costs, stemming from infrastructural investments such as plumbing, power grids, and communications. Recent developments The dilapidated Blok P In conjunction with the joint 2009 Greenlandic Home rule and Nuuk city council decision to sanitize and partly dismantle the infamous Blok P in central Nuuk, a plan was drafted to primarily house the evictees in apartment blocks at Qinngorput. Many of the present Blok P tenants have expressed their unwillingness to move to the new district, citing both rising living expenses and lack of commuting possibilities. The tenants were offered housing in six apartment blocks, built in the Pisissia part of Qinngorput by subcontractor Permagreen. The clearing and subsequent cleaning of Blok P was done in two stages, beginning in 2011 with the second stage in early 2012. From 2013 the municipality created a community project over the former Blok P area, called Nuuk Playground. The majority of tenants from Blok P were moved to other places near the city. Infrastructure and services The number of services in the district is on the rise. In addition to the already existing kindergarten and mass transit service points, on May 3, 2011, a new two-form entry school—Hans Lynge School—was handed over to Nuuk city. The school commenced its function in September 2011. The school is planned to house 452 pupils from grades 1 to 7, with a planned option of expanding it to a three- form school. It will also double as a cultural center. While planning the school, the focus was on environmentally friendly design In June, 2011, Sermersooq municipal council earmarked funds for a playground and activity park for children. Construction commenced in 2012, with no date for final hand-over set. A local grocery store, \\"Spar\\", has operated in the district since June 29, 2011 . Additionally, a mobile grocery delivery service is also available for residents, if they prefer items that are only available from a bigger grocery chain, or if they prefer a usually cheaper price. Transportation Nuup Bussii transportation. Connections Previously the only readily accessible route to the district was via the airport. In 2008 a road connecting Qinngorput to central Nuuk—via Nuussuaq—was finished, effectively cutting commuting time to the city centre in half. The road is named after government minister Agnethe Davidsen. From 2013, there are two to four buses available from the city each hour. It takes approximately 10–15 minutes to get into the city. Mass transit Commuting between downtown and Qinngorput is facilitated by the local Nuup Bussii bus company. It operates three bus routes. Route 1 and 1A run together every 20 minutes directly between downtown and the district; Route 3 runs a route full of detours, connecting the district with Nuuk Airport, Nuussuaq and downtown once an hour from Monday to Saturday.

It had a moment magnitude of 6.3 and a maximum MSK intensity of IX (Destructive). The epicenter was 28 kilometers northeast of the city centre and a depth of about 10 kilometers. The earthquake caused widespread casualties among Managua's residents: 4,000–11,000 were killed, 20,000 were injured and over 300,000 were left homeless. Tectonic setting A Nicaraguan soldier patrolling against looters in the aftermath of the earthquake Managua, which lies on the southern shore of Lake Xolotlán, near the western coast of Nicaragua, is situated within an active volcanic zone known as the Central American Volcanic Chain. The city has a long history of volcanic and seismic activity which arise from the relative movements of two crustal plates which intersect near the southwestern border of Central America. The Cocos plate, located east of the East Pacific Rise, is moving northeastward and is slowly being submerged under the Caribbean Plate. The zone of dipping is initiated at the surface of the Middle America Trench, which extends 4 to 5 kilometers deep along the Pacific Coast from Mexico to Costa Rica.Earthquake Information Bulletin, September–October 1973, Volume 5, Number 5., Retrieved on June 2, 2008 But rather than a simple crustal movement between the two plates the earthquake was believed to have been caused by a shallow adjustment to geological pressure at the south western corner of the Caribbean plate. Damage A hotel destroyed by the quake in Managua's centre The earthquake severely damaged and destroyed in the city centre. The majority of the buildings in the central business district sustained significant structural damage including a 19-story building, one 15-story building, approximately 5 buildings that were 7 to 9 stories tall and more than 25 buildings that were from 3 to 6 stories tall. Much of the damage arose from seismic ground movement which occurred within 10–15 seconds of the main shock. The majority of the factories and smaller buildings were severely damaged. Many of the houses and small shops were over 40 years old and constructed using a local method called taquezal (or talquezal), in which the timber framed walls are filled with stone and finished with plaster, covered by roofs of unmortared clay tile. The design is very susceptible to earthquake damage. An estimated 53,000 homes in the city were damaged. The water and electrical power networks were severely damaged and more than a week after the earthquake only 10% of the city had any working water service. Surface faulting One of the most significant geological effects of the 1972 Nicaragua earthquake quake was surface faulting. Examination of the fault lines indicated a lateral motion moving in a northeasterly direction and aftershock data has revealed at least one of the faults extends from the surface to a depth of 8 to 10 kilometers beneath the city of Managua. Aftershocks Within an hour after the main shock, two aftershocks, one of magnitude 5.0 and the other 5.2, occurred at 1:18 a.m. and 1:20 a.m.Earthquake Hazards Program USGS, Retrieved on June 2, 2008 Response An office block damaged Two-thirds of Managua's 1,000,000 residents were displaced and faced food shortage and disease, and dry-season winds worsened the problem with fires created by the disaster. Because of the damaging effects of the earthquake, many of the emergency services in the city were operating at a seriously lower level than normal. The earthquake destroyed all the fire-fighting equipment available, and fires were prevalent in some areas for several days. All four main hospitals, which before the disaster had 1,650 beds, were unserviceable. The Nicaraguan government appealed for aid, and the government accepted aid from countries like the United States and Mexico and some 25 other countries, worth millions of dollars. Despite this and the magnitude of the devastation, the aid was not distributed well and the ruling Liberal-Conservative Junta, led by President Anastasio Somoza Debayle, was the target of criticism and was accused of stockpiling foreign aid which never reached the victims of the earthquake. It was because of these reports that the Puerto Rican baseball star Roberto Clemente chose to personally accompany the fourth of a number of relief flights he had organized. That flight crashed on December 31, 1972, killing Clemente among others. Bulldozers shifting the rubble Another difficulty was that much of the material aid donated was inappropriate for the needs of the affected Nicaraguans, including such items as winter clothes (Managua's climate is tropical) and frozen TV dinners.Cornell, James C. (1982), The Great International Disaster Book (3rd ed.), Charles Scribner's Sons. It was later claimed that Somoza and his associates had used foreign aid for their own gain. Opposition to the regime, which had begun to surface before the earthquake, increased quickly among the lower classes and even among members of the upper and middle classes fed up with Somoza's corruption. This grew into a revolt that became the Nicaraguan Revolution, in which Somoza was overthrown in 1979. Because of the extent of the damage, the faulty underground terrain, the misappropriation of aid, and the subsequent revolution and 11-year civil war, much of the city centre remained ruined for almost 20 years. Reconstruction only began in earnest in the 1990s. Aftermath The earthquake changed the face of Managua during its decades of recovery. The city centre is no longer clearly defined, as buildings have been constructed away from the city centre. During the massive evacuations, the displaced residents set up camp around water resources and areas that remained somewhat unaffected. Although Managua remains Central America's second largest capital and metropolitan area, the bulk of its residents reside in barrios or neighborhoods that are of considerable distance from the city centre. Today, in place of the large buildings that used to exist in the centre, the government set up the \\"Plaza de la Fe\\" (Faith Square) in honor of Pope John Paul II.

Each of these is rated on a four-point Likert scale of frequency or severity of the participants' experiences over the last week with the intention of emphasising states over traits. These scores ranged from 0, meaning that the client believed the item \\"did not apply to them at all\\", to 3 meaning that the client considered the item to \\"apply to them very much, or most of the time\\". It is also stressed in the instructions that there are no right or wrong answers.  Scales  The sum of the relevant 14 items for each scale constitute the participants' scores for each of Depression, Anxiety and Stress, including items such as \\"I couldn't seem to experience any positive feeling at all\\", \\"I was aware of the dryness of my mouth\\" and \\"I found it hard to wind down\\" in the respective order of the scales. The order of the 42 items has been randomised so that items of the same scale are not clustered together. Each of the scales is then broken down into subscales comprising two to five items each. The Depression scale has subscales assessing dysphoria, hopelessness, devaluation of life, self-deprecation, lack of interest/involvement, anhedonia and inertia. The Anxiety scale assesses autonomic arousal, skeletal muscle effects, situational anxiety and subjective experience of anxious affect. The Stress scale's subscales highlight levels of non-chronic arousal through difficulty relaxing, nervous arousal and being easily upset/agitated, irritable/over-reactive and impatient.  Purpose  The main purpose of the DASS is to isolate and identify aspects of emotional disturbance; for example, to assess the degree of severity of the core symptoms of depression, anxiety or stress. The initial aims of the scale's constructions were to define the full range of core symptoms of depression and anxiety, meet rigorous standards of psychometric adequacy, and develop maximum discrimination between the depression anxiety scales. While the DASS can be administered and scored by individuals without psychology qualifications, it is recommended that the interpretation and decisions based on results are made by an experienced clinician in combination with other forms of assessment.  Development  The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales were developed by researchers at the University of New South Wales (Australia).University of New South Wales Depression Anxiety Stress Scales http://www2.psy.unsw.edu.au/groups/dass/ The test was developed using a sample of responses from the comparison of 504 sets of results from a trial by students, taken from a larger sample of 950 first year university student responses. The test was then normed on a sample of 1044 males and 1870 females aged between 17 and 69 years, across participants of varying backgrounds, including university students, nurses in training and blue and white collared employees of a major airline, bank, railway workshop and naval dockyard. The scores were subsequently checked for validity against outpatient groups including patients suffering from anxiety and depressive disorders, insomniacs, myocardial infarction patients, as well as patients undergoing treatment for sexual, menopausal and depressive disorders. While the test was not normed against samples younger than 17, due to the simplicity of language, there has been no compelling evidence against the use of the scales for comparison against children as young as 12. The reliability scores of the scales in terms of Cronbach's alpha scores rate the Depression scale at 0.91, the Anxiety scale at 0.84 and the Stress scale at 0.90 in the normative sample. The means and standard deviations for each scale are 6.34 and 6.97 for depression, 4.7 and 4.91 for anxiety and 10.11 and 7.91 for stress, respectively. The mean scores in the normative sample did vary slightly between genders as well as varying by age, though the threshold scores for classifications do not change by these variations. The Depression and Stress scales meet the standard threshold requirement of 0.9 for research, however, the Anxiety scale still meets the 0.7 threshold for clinical applications, and is still close to the 0.9 required for research.

On December 20, 2001, it became the first attraction in Millennium Park to open. The $3.2 million plaza was funded by a donation from the McCormick Tribune Foundation. It has served as an ice skating rink, a dining facility and briefly as an open-air exhibition space. The plaza operates as McCormick Tribune Ice Rink, a free public outdoor ice skating rink that is generally open four months a year, from mid-November until mid-March, when it hosts over 100,000 skaters annually. It is known as one of Chicago's better outdoor people-watching locations during the winter months. It is operated by the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs rather than the Chicago Park District, which operates most major public ice skating rinks in Chicago. For the rest of the year, it serves as Plaza at Park Grill or Park Grill Plaza, Chicago's largest outdoor dining facility. The 150-seat park grill hosts various culinary events as well as music during its months of outdoor operation, and it is affiliated with the 300-seat indoor Park Grill restaurant located beneath AT&T; Plaza and Cloud Gate. The outdoor restaurant offers scenic views of the park.  History  Lying between Lake Michigan to the east and the Loop to the west, Grant Park has been Chicago's front yard since the mid-19th century. Its northwest corner, north of Monroe Street and the Art Institute, east of Michigan Avenue, south of Randolph Street, and west of Columbus Drive, had been Illinois Central rail yards and parking lots until 1997 when it was made available for development by the city as Millennium Park. As of 2007, Millennium Park, which is located in the northwest corner of Grant Park, trails only Navy Pier as a Chicago tourist attraction. The earliest plans for Millennium Park were unveiled by Chicago's mayor, Richard M. Daley, in March 1998 and included \\"a reflecting pool that would double as a skating rink in winter\\". The architectural firm of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill came up with the master plan for the park; their original design for the ice rink placed it along upper Randolph Street, on the park's northern edge. However, McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink was built on the western edge of Millennium Park. The Chicago Tribune's Pulitzer Prize-winning architecture critic Blair Kamin called this move \\"a masterstroke\\" and praised the new location \\"where the skaters symbolize the year-round vitality of the city\\". Kamin noted the location on the east side of Michigan Avenue allowed those at the plaza and ice rink to enjoy the skyline of the Historic Michigan Boulevard District. Another addition to the plaza and rink's design was the 300-seat restaurant; the final architectural design was completed by OWP&P; Architects, who were also the architects for the adjoining Wrigley Square. Although the rink was budgeted for $5 million, it was constructed for only $3.2 million ($ million today), making it one of the few Millennium Park attractions to cost less than was initially budgeted. The rink was funded by and named for the McCormick Tribune Foundation, which was established by former Chicago Tribune owner and publisher Robert R. McCormick. The McCormick Tribune Foundation is a supporter of the McCormick Tribune Freedom Museum and the McCormick Tribune Campus Center at the Illinois Institute of Technology, both of which are also located in Chicago. alt=An ice skating rink with a few skaters and a large metallic sculpture in the background McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink was the first feature in Millennium Park to open. Its grand opening was celebrated on December 20, 2001,Satler, p. 170 a few weeks ahead of the Millennium Park underground parking garage. Mayor Daley, McCormick Tribune Foundation Chairman of the Board John W. Madigan, Millennium Park private donor group chief John Bryan, actress Bonnie Hunt and other local celebrities attended the event. The new ice rink was seen as a replacement for \\"Skate on State\\", a public skating rink on State Street in the Loop which closed in 2001. From June 21 to September 15, 2002, McCormick Tribune Plaza hosted the inaugural exhibit in Millennium Park, Exelon Presents Earth From Above by Yann Arthus-Bertrand, a French aerial photographer. Arthus-Bertrand used planes and helicopters to photograph sites in over 60 countries on every continent, and displayed more than 120 of these photographs in dozens of cities, starting in Paris and including Tokyo and Geneva. In the summer of 2002, the book associated with the exhibit had sold over 1.5 million copies, and the photographs were displayed in Brazil, Lebanon, Poland, Sweden, Germany, Britain, Norway, Hungary and along the banks of the Volga River in Russia. Chicago was the first American city to host the Earth From Above exhibition. The exhibit featured photographic prints that were laminated onto thin aluminum panels that protected them from ultraviolet rays. The photographs included scenes of natural beauty such as a Filipino Bajau village built on coral reefs, a formation of rocks in Madagascar, an inlet in the Ionian Islands that is home to endangered sea turtles, and architectural highlights such as the Palace of Versailles and the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul. It also showed scenes of tragedy such as the 1999 earthquake in Turkey and the destruction of the Amazon rainforest. The exhibit used photovoltaic solar panels to store electrical energy during the day that then lit the exhibit at night. Part of the 2006 film The Weather Man, starring Nicolas Cage, was shot at the rink. In 2008, Millennium Park hosted a winter celebration called the Museum of Modern Ice. The installation included a ice wall in the park and a large abstract painting by Gordon Halloran, which was embedded in the McCormick Tribune Ice Rink. The works were titled Paintings Below Zero. In 2008–2009 the logo for the unsuccessful Chicago bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics was displayed in the rink's ice. The ice rink served as the \\"headquarters\\" for the 2011 edition of Hockey Weekend Across America; the NHL on NBC broadcast its studio coverage from the rink on February 20 of that year. Eddie Olczyk opened the show by skating with the Stanley Cup in the Millennium Park rink.  Details  alt=An empty ice skating rink with tall buildings in the background The ice skating rink at McCormick Tribune Plaza is . Due to the rink's rounded corners, the total skating surface is , which critic Blair Kamin called \\"amply sized\\". For comparison, this is a considerably larger skating surface than the Rockefeller Center rink in New York City, which is .Gilfoyle, p. 324. The Millennium Park rink has a lobby which provides skaters a respite from the natural environs, as well as toilets and public lockers. During the 2003–04 season the rink rented 77,667 pairs of ice skates. By 2009–2010, its ninth season, it was attracting more than 100,000 skaters a year. While availability of the rink depends on the weather, it also has a state-of-the-art chiller system that can maintain the ice in the event of unseasonably warm weather. Thus, temperature is not the only factor involved in decisions to close the rink. In his review of the plaza and rink, Kamin gave it two stars (out of a possible four), called the structure \\"solid, though unremarkable\\", and praised its uses throughout the year. When the rink is closed, its surface becomes a 150-seat cafe that complements the 300-seat indoor Park Grill dining facility. Street level features such as McCormick Tribune Plaza are linked to elevated features such as Cloud Gate and AT&T; Plaza, which are atop the Park Grill Restaurant and can be reached via balustraded stairs.  Operations  Zamboni operates every two hours.alt=An ice resurfacing machine in action at a skating rink Through 2006 and 2007, the McCormick Tribune Ice Rink was one of several operated by the Chicago Park District. Since then, although the Chicago Park District still operates ten public ice skating rinks, the Millennium Park ice rink is operated by a division of the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs, itself a Department of the City of Chicago Government.  Ice rink  alt=Part of an ice skating rink viewed from above with dozens of skaters to one side mostly standing behind cones on the ice. McCormick Tribune Ice Rink is generally open for skating afternoons and evenings seven days a week, with longer hours on weekends. However, it is occasionally closed for private events. Skating is free and skate rental is available. Except for its first year, the rink has been scheduled to be open from mid-November until mid- March, weather permitting. For the 2009–10 winter season, the rink was scheduled to be open from November 20, 2009 to March 14, 2010, with abbreviated holiday schedules on Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and New Year's Eve. Skating is accompanied by loudspeaker music, which is mostly seasonal music during the holidays. Rink attendance is heavier on the weekends and other times when school is not in session. Romantic holidays such as Christmas Eve and Valentine's Day are also quite crowded. The ice rink is a popular people watching location during the winter months; many view events at the McCormick Tribune Plaza from AT&T; Plaza, above and to the east. The ice skating rink has become so popular that when the weather was too warm for the rink's opening in November 2005, the story became international news. The book 1,000 Places to See in the U.S.A. & Canada Before You Die suggests a visit to McCormick Tribune Plaza during the skating season, and describes Millennium Park as a renowned attraction. There are days when themed skating is encouraged. Santa attire was encouraged on Saturday, December 13, 2008, and zombie attire was encouraged the next day, as part of an attempt to set a Guinness World Record for number of zombies on ice. The rink also serves as a host to the annual Chicago Winter Dance Festival; during the festival there is a month of free skating instruction and demonstration at the rink, and there is free dance instructions behind the glass doors of the Jay Pritzker Pavilion stage.  Park Grill Plaza  alt=A cafe behind a set of trees and grass During much of the offseason alfresco dining is available in a 150-seat cafe set up on the ice rink, in what is then referred to as the Park Grill Plaza. This outdoor dining experience is associated with the Park Grill Restaurant and the Park Grill Cafe, which are both located under the Cloud Gate on AT&T; Plaza. Architecture critic Blair Kamin compares the in-park eating options availed at the Park Grill with New York's former Tavern on the Green and Chicago's Cafe Brauer. The Park Grill Plaza is the largest outdoor dining venue in Chicago, and hosts a variety of events, including a benefit called \\"Chefs on the Grill\\" in which guests interact with invited chefs who are competing to produce the best dish. Wine tastings are also hosted there, and during the summer, the Park Grill Plaza hosts musical performances on Thursdays. During the skating season, there are rinkside tables and the Park Grill Cafe offers take out and to-go service. Outdoor dining service begins in May. McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink is one of two features in the park to include accessible restrooms; the other is Jay Pritzker Pavilion. The restrooms are located adjacent to the Park Grill. Although McCormick Plaza is a winter focal point, the park's restroom facilities at this feature are not heated for winter use. According to Fodor's, the restaurant is known for a view that makes up for unimpressive service. However, Citysearch speaks positively about the service. Metromix, Fodor's and Frommer's all laud the location of the restaurant, which serves New American cuisine. Frommer's gives the restaurant 2 out of 3 stars and notes that the restaurant has a kids menu to accommodate the numerous families that visit the park. Metromix notes that the restaurant is well known for its signature Park Grill Burger. The northern area of the Plaza has been named the North Lounge and has furniture for lounging; it has a distinct menu including options from the Plaza's menu, as well as its own offerings. The indoor restaurant has seating for 300, a VIP room, and serves dinner, lunch, and weekend brunch.

During the Second World War, he was appointed as the leading German foreign ministry official for Greece and the Balkans (including Serbia, Albania and Montenegro). Austrian activism Born in Wels, he was educated in Kremsmünster and Vienna before his service on the Italian Front in World War I.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, p. 278 Initially connected to the Social Democratic Party of Austria through his friendship with a number of leading members whilst in charge of a housing project in Vienna, Neubacher became attracted to Pan-Germanism and in 1925 founded his own Österreichisch-Deutscher Volksbund as a society for this school of thought. He was also a member of the Deutsche Gemeinschaft secret society and in this group he built up friendships with fellow members Engelbert Dollfuß and Arthur Seyss-Inquart. Neubacher became a member of the Nazi Party in Austria because he felt it was the best way to bring about Anschluss, although he was more in tune with the Anton Reinthaller-led moderate faction than the extremists under Theodor Habicht.Rees, Biographical Dictionary, p. 279 After a spell as assistant to Josef Leopold he became Landesleiter of the Austrian Nazi party in 1935, attempting to restructure the banned group. His tenure came to an end the same year when he was imprisoned for distributing illegal material and upon his release, he dropped out of politics to take up a role with IG Farben. Under the Nazis he was chosen to serve as Mayor of Vienna, although he soon incurred disfavor for his habit of working with former Social Democrats and his lax attitude towards the Jews and before long he was downgraded to the role of general representative of Josef Bürckel. Greece When war broke out Neubacher took on the role of a special plenipotentiary envoy in the Balkans and Greece, initially serving as an economic adviser in Romania before taking on the role of ambassador to the same country and afterwards Greece as well. In Greece he was joined by Italian Alberto D'Agostino, with the two men given full authority over economic and financial matters after discussions between the Greek government and the occupiers aimed at reducing occupation costs.Davide Rodogno, Fascism's European Empire: Italian Occupation During the Second World War, Cambridge University Press (2006), p. 235 Neubacher was the general manager of DEGRIGES a German monopoly company for trade in Greece. During the final days of the occupation of Greece the more moderate Neubacher became embroiled in a struggle with Sicherheitspolizei chief Walter Blume, after Blume suggested that the Nazis should undertake a policy of executing all members of the political elite suspected of having links to the United Kingdom, so as to leave the country leaderless (the so-called \\"Chaos thesis\\").Mazower, Mark: Inside Hitler's Greece: The Experience of Occupation, 1941-44, Yale University Press (1995), pp. 232-234 Neubacher rejected this as counterproductive, arguing that as long as politicians opposed the work of the communist-controlled National Liberation Front and the Greek People's Liberation Army their British links should be ignored. In the end Neubacher's line was approved and Blume was withdrawn, a move that ultimately left in place a strong pro-British right wing governing class in post-liberation Greece.István Deák, Jan Tomasz Gross and Tony Judt, The Politics of Retribution in Europe: World War II and Its Aftermath, Princeton University Press (2000), p. 213 Yugoslavia In 1943 he devised the Neubacher Plan as a means to improve German occupation in the Balkans. In a wide-ranging raft of reforms Neubacher suggested five main ideas to Joachim von Ribbentrop. These were: # The re-unification of Montenegro and Serbia in a federal type of state. # Installing General Milan Nedić as President of the resulting Greater Serbia. # Autonomy in Montenegro. # The re- opening of the University of Belgrade and an end to German supervision of cultural life. # Reduction in German military presence and the establishment of a gendarmerie controlled by the new government.Sabrina P. Ramet, The Three Yugoslavias: State-building and Legitimation, 1918-2005, p. 134 Ultimately only point 4 of his proposals was approved, although he did succeed in ending German military reprisals and in combating to an extent the Ustaše reprisals against Serbs.Ramet, The Three Yugoslavias, pp. 134-135 Later life After the war Neubacher faced trial in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and in 1946 a military court in Belgrade sentenced him to 20 years of hard labor, although he was not ultimately required to serve the full sentence. He served his prison term in Belgrade, in the building of the former Gestapo headquarters. He was released from prison in November 1952 due to poor health. Back in Austria, he worked as a building constructor in Salzburg, and from 1954–1956, he worked in Ethiopia as a consultant to Emperor Haile Selasie. He died in Vienna, aged 67.

The Shizhoupian () is the first known Chinese dictionary, and was written in the ancient Great Seal script. The work was traditionally dated to the reign of King Xuan of Zhou (827–782 BCE), but many modern scholars assign it to the State of Qin in the Warring States period (c. 475–221 BCE). The text is no longer extant, and it is now known only through fragments. History The Shizhoupian dictionary, which was probably compiled sometime between 700 BCE to 200 BCE, originally consisted of 15 chapters ( piān), but six were lost by the reign of Emperor Guangwu of Han (25–56 CE) and the other nine chapters, except for scattered references, were lost by the Jin dynasty (265–420). Title Until recently, it was thought that the dictionary title referred to Shǐ Zhòu ( \\"Historian Zhou\\"), who allegedly served as Grand Historian (Tàishǐ 太史) in the court of Western Zhou King Xuan (r. 827–782 BCE). Both the c. 78 CE \\"Treatise on Literature\\" chapter of the Book of Han and the 121 CE Shuowen Jiezi postface record that King Xuan's \\"Historian Zhou\\" compiled the Shizhoupian. The philologist Wang Guowei (1877–1927) disputed this traditional account with epigraphical evidence that the structure and style of the Shizhoupian characters did not match inscriptions from the Western Zhou period. Wang also doubted that zhòu () was a person's surname, interpreting it to mean dú (, \\"to study and understand the meaning of books; to read\\"), and concluded the dictionary title was likely taken from the first sentence Taishi zhoushu (, \\"the Grand Historian reads the records\\").Hànyǔ Dà Zìdiǎn pp. 1677, 1259. The linguist Táng Lán (, 1901–1979) hypothetically identified Shi Zhou (, \\"Historian Zhou\\"), who is only recorded in Shizhoupian contexts, with the differently named Shi Liu (, Historian Liu) listed in the Book of Han chapter on \\"Notable Persons Past and Present\\". In the Zhengzhang system of Old Chinese reconstructions these two words were pronounced *l'ɯwɢs () and *m·ru (). An ancient ding tripodal cauldron in the collection of the Shanghai Museum mentioned a Historian Liu from the correct historical period. Modern scholars believe that zhou () does not refer to a person, but means \\"read; chant\\". The lexicographer Liu Yeqiu () suggested that the word shi () may refer to the title given to students in ancient times who could recite 9,000 characters, with the title thus translated as \\"Shi (Reciters') Chants\\". Zhou script The term zhòuwén (, Zhou Script) refers to the 220-some examples of ancient characters from the Shizhoupian that are quoted in the Han dynasty character dictionary Shuowen Jiezi. The zhouwen characters have been described as generally symmetrical and balanced, and are on average (although not always) more complex than the later seal characters. They contain many swirls and circles in place of later squared or rectilinear forms. References Sources  (English translation of Wénzìxué Gàiyào , Shangwu, 1988.) * . Hànyǔ Dà Zìdiǎn, 1992.

The Monk cites St. Bonaventure and Albert the Great (d. 1280) and draws largely on the works of Conrad of Brundelsheim (Soccus), Abbot of Heilsbronn in 1303 (d. 1321). His mystical conceptions show a close relation to Bernard of Clairvaux and Hugo of St. Victor. Dating The date of the composition of the treatises is determined by these borrowings and quotations; they are written in Middle German with some traces of the Bavarian dialect. Book of the Seven Degrees The first, in verse, is \\"The Book of the Seven Degrees\\" (Das Buch der siben Grade), which comprises 2218 lines, and has only been preserved in one manuscript-that of Heidelberg, transcribed in 1390 by a priest, Ulric Currifex of Eschenbach. In it the author, taking as his starting point the vision of Ezechiel (xl, 22) describes the seven degrees which make the pure soul mount up to the realms of heaven: prayer, penitence, charity, the habitual thought of God, with the devotion, which purifies and which ravishes, union and conformity with God, contemplation of God. The author may have utilized a treatise of the same nature attributed to David of Augsburg.  oldest german papermanuscript (1340)  In 2019 an issue of \\"The Book of the Seven Degrees\\" was discovered in the Badische Landesbibliothek in Karlsruhe. Dated 1335–1340 by paper-analysis and existing watermark, the 179-page script is said to be the oldest paper manuscript fully written in german language ever found.https://www.swr.de/swraktuell/baden- wuerttemberg/karlsruhe/Sensationsfund-in-Karlsruhe-Aelteste-deutsche- Handschrift-auf-Papier-gefunden,sensationsfund-handschrift-blb-100.html https://www.deutschlandfunk.de/karlsruhe-aelteste-deutsche-handschrift- entdeckt.2849.de.html?drn:news_id=1021303 Liber de corpore et sanguine Domini The other work is in prose with a prologue and epilogue in verse and it is in this prologue that the author was himself the \\"Monk of Heilsbronn\\" (einem Muniche von Hailsprunne) and asks the prayers of the reader. The title of the treatise is the \\"Liber de corpore et sanguine Domini\\" (or \\"Das Puch on den VI namen des Fronleichnams\\", or also the \\"Goldene Zunge\\"). He passes in review six different names given to the Blessed Sacrament: Eucharist, Gift, Food, Communion, Sacrifice, Sacrament; he gives the reasons for these names and suggests considerations on the Divine love, union with God, etc. (cf. supra), especially when speaking of the second and the sixth names. He cites Bernard of Clairvaux \\"his father\\", very frequently, while much less frequently Augustine of Hippo and Gregory the Great are quoted. We find the same work also in Latin translations. Other works A third work \\"On Love\\" (Das Puch von der Minne), if it ever existed, has not been recovered. Two other treatises which are found in the manuscript of Heidelberg have been attributed to the same author, they are \\"The Daughter of Sion\\" (Tochter Syon), a short poem of 596 lines, in the Alamannian dialect, rich in matter and full of emotion; it treats of the mystical union of the soul with God, a theme frequently dealt with in the poetry of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. The second work (von Sante Alexis) gives us in 456 lines the well- known legend of St. Alexis. However, peculiarities of language, rhyme, and verse, coupled with an original fashion of conceiving things (e.g. the idea of soul and spirit), forbid us to consider the \\"Monk of Heilsbronn\\" as the author of these two poems.

Her wreck was cleared from the channel in 1956 and her hull refurbished, re- entering service. She was renamed the (t , s , p Dōngfāng Hóng Bā, \\"The East is Red #8\\") during the Cultural Revolution and retired during modernisations in 1983. __NOTOC__ The wreck of SS Kiangya The Kiangya was one of eight ships operated by the Shanghai Merchants Group and the sister ship of the (, Jiāngjìng Lún). She had a displacement of 2,100 tons. At the time of her explosion during the Chinese Civil War, she was bound for Ningpo from Shanghai's Shiliupu Dock. She was packed with refugees fleeing the advancing Communists. She probably hit a mine, possibly laid by the Imperial Japanese Navy during the Second World War. The exact death toll is unknown. Although her official capacity was 1,186 passengers, the manifest listed 2,150 and she was almost certainly carrying many additional stowaways. Rescuers were unaware of the disaster for some hours. It is thought that between 2,750 and 3,920 died, with 700 survivors being picked up by other vessels. SS Dongfang Hong 8 The hull of the Kiangya had broken in half but, in 1956, the two pieces were removed in order to dredge that area of the river. The process took 160 days, after which the pieces were removed to the Jiangnan Shipyard and refurbished. She re-entered service at Shanghai's Shiliupu Dock on 4 February 1959, after which she served as a local ferry and for shipping between Shanghai and Wuhan. She was renamed the Dongfang Hong 8 in November 1966 during the Cultural Revolution. She was retired in 1983. During shipbreaking operations in June 2000, a major oil fire broke out. Legacy The recovered wheel of the Kiangya at the EZMAFCM. The ship's wooden steering wheel is preserved at the East Zhejiang Maritime Affairs and Folk Customs Museum in Ningbo.

The Foreign Investment Review Act that created the agency was the culmination of a series of government reports and debates. The 1957 report of the Royal Commission on Canada's Economic Prospects (known as the Gordon Commission) firmly planted foreign investment on the political agenda. Next, the 1968 Watkins report (known formally as Foreign Ownership and the Structure of Canadian Industry), called for a national policy capable of handling Canada's interests in the age of the multinational corporation. In 1970, the Wahn Report expanded the idea of a screening process, and finally the Gray report (known officially as Foreign Direct Investment in Canada) provided the rationale and framework for the agency. FIRA was placed under the jurisdiction of the Department of Industry and later, when it was merged with the Department of Trade and Commerce, under the newly named Department of Industry, Trade and Commerce. As outlined in section 2(2) of the act, takeovers were assessed based on their contribution to job creation, Canadian participation in management, competition with existing industries, new technology, and compatibility with federal and provincial economic policies. When Prime Minister Brian Mulroney came to office in 1985, the agency was renamed Investment Canada and its mandate drastically reduced.  Further reading  * Azzi, Stephen.

The term \\"Pennsylvania Line\\" referred to the quota of numbered infantry regiments assigned to Pennsylvania at various times by the Continental Congress. These, together with similar contingents from the other twelve states, formed the Continental Line. The concept was particularly important in relation to the promotion of commissioned officers. Officers of the Continental Army below the rank of brigadier general were ordinarily ineligible for promotion except in the line of their own state. Not all Continental infantry regiments raised in a state were part of a state quota, however. On December 27, 1776, the Continental Congress gave Washington temporary control over certain military decisions that the Congress ordinarily regarded as its own prerogative. These \\"dictatorial powers\\" included the authority to raise sixteen additional Continental infantry regiments at large. Early in 1777, Washington offered command of one of these additional regiments to Thomas Hartley of Pennsylvania, who accepted. Hartley had formerly been lieutenant colonel of the 6th Pennsylvania Battalion. Hartley's Additional Continental Regiment was allotted to the Pennsylvania Line on March 27, 1778. On January 13, 1779, it absorbed Patton's Regiment and was designated the 11th Pennsylvania Regiment. The latter was called the \\"New Eleventh Pennsylvania Regiment\\" as the original 11th Pennsylvania Regiment had been consolidated with the 10th Pennsylvania Regiment on July 1, 1778. Washington also offered command to John Patton of Pennsylvania, who accepted leadership of Patton's Additional Continental Regiment. In 1776, Patton had commanded a battalion of the Pennsylvania State Rifle Regiment. Half of Malcolm's Additional Continental Regiment was drawn from New York and half from Pennsylvania. Still other Continental infantry regiments and smaller units, also unrelated to a state quota, were raised as needed for special or temporary service. Nelson's and Doyle's Independent Rifle Companies were examples of such \\"extra\\" units.

It was developed after Henry Doulton's ceramic water filter of 1827. It is similar to the Berkefeld filter in principle. Design Schematic diagram of a Chamberland filter The filter consists of a permeable unglazed porcelain tube (called bisque) that contains a ring of enameled porcelain through which the inflow pipe fits. The core of the porcelain is made up of a metal pipe with holes through which water flows out and is collected. Inflow is pressurized so filtration occurs under force. There are 13 types: L1 to L13. L1 filters have the coarsest pore size while L13 have the finest. Usefulness The Pasteur-Chamberland filter is as useful as other ceramic and porcelain filters. It is a good bacterial water filter used mainly as a high volume water filter.Textbook of Microbiology by Prof. C P Baveja, Textbook of Microbiology by Ananthanarayan and Panikar, The filter works more quickly when the water supplied is under pressure. As with other filters of its kind, it cannot filter very small particles like viruses or mycoplasma. It is used in removal of organisms from a fluid culture in order to obtain the bacterial toxins. History The Chamberland filter was developed by Charles Edouard Chamberland, one of Louis Pasteur’s assistants in Paris. The original intention was to produce filtered water, free of bacteria, for use in Pasteur's experiments. The filter became increasingly known for its ability to filter out bacteria, the smallest living organisms then known. The filter was patented by Chamberland and Pasteur in America and Europe. An American company licensed the name in Ohio. They sold filters to private homes, hotels, restaurants, and the 1893 Chicago World's Columbian Exposition. Use of the Pasteur-Chamberland filter led to the discovery that diphtheria and tetanus toxins, among others, could still cause illness even after filtration. Identification of these toxins contributed to the development of antitoxins to treat such diseases. It was also discovered that a type of substance, initially known as a \\"filterable virus\\", passed through the smallest Pasteur- Chamberland filters, and replicated itself inside living cells. The discovery that biological entities smaller than bacteria existed was important in establishing the field of virology.

On 7 September 1956 he was elected for a one-year-term as President of the German Bundesrat. Because his successor-elect, Governing Mayor of Berlin Otto Suhr, had died on 30 August 1957, Sieveking was re-elected as President of the Bundesrat in order to avoid a vacancy. He resigned on 1 November 1957, when Willy Brandt became the new Governing Mayor of Berlin and President of the Bundesrat subsequently. Because of that, Sieveking is, as yet, the only President of the Bundesrat to be re- elected to a second consecutive term (seven other persons have held two non- consecutive one-year-terms). Sieveking was from a well known Hamburg family, his great-granduncle Friedrich Sieveking preceded him in office as First Mayor in the 1860s. Many streets and places in Hamburg were named after them: e.g. Sievekingsallee, Sievekingdamm or Sievekingsplatz (53°33'19\\"N 9°58'34\\"E). In 1951, Sieveking was appointed as the consul in Stockholm and later ambassador in Sweden. In 1953, Sieveking was the candidate of the conservative parties for the office of the First Mayor.

It is dedicated to the study of the archaeology, history and people of the three Ridings of the historic county of Yorkshire. It publishes an annual journal, the Yorkshire Archaeological Journal; and, particularly through its Record Series, it also functions as a text publication society. Its headquarters are in Leeds. The Society has seven special interest groups, such as the Family History or the Roman Antiquities sections. These may be joined without full membership of the main YAHS. History The Society was founded in 1863 as the Huddersfield Archaeological and Topographical Association. The initial purpose was to facilitate renewed excavations at Slack Roman fort, and later to promote interest in the history and archaeology of the Huddersfield area. The principal instigator was George Lloyd (1820–1885).Huddersfield Chronicle 9 December 1865: \\"The site of Cambodunum\\" In 1870 the society expanded its interests to cover the whole of Yorkshire, and changed its name accordingly to the Yorkshire Archaeological Society. In 1896 it moved its headquarters from Huddersfield to Leeds. In 2015 it changed its name again to the Yorkshire Archaeological and Historical Society. From 1968 the Society had its headquarters at \\"Claremont\\", a large house built in the 1770s, close to the main campus of the University of Leeds. Negotiations began to sell \\"Claremont\\" in 2016, with the aim of opening smaller office accommodation in the same vicinity. Prehistory Section The Prehistory Section has an active programme and a regular publication for section members called The Bulletin. The aim is to bring together those with an interest in the prehistoric archaeology of the region. Roman Antiquities Section The Roman Antiquities Section meets for lectures about five times a year. It has an annual Bulletin for section members and occasional monographs. Medieval Section The Medieval Section meets about three times a year at locations suited to the subject matter of the day schools. It publishes Medieval Yorkshire, an annual publication free to section members. Industrial History Section The Industrial History Section has a very active programme of lectures, visits and informal social events. It publishes three newsletters a year for section members. Family History Section The Family History Section has monthly lectures at Claremont and a Workshop for section members every Tuesday afternoon. It publishes a quarterly newsletter, The Yorkshire Family Historian. The Society also has two publishing only sections : # The Parish Register Section transcribes, annotates and prints Parish Registers from the region. The section's aim is to produce one volume a year. # The Wakefield Court Roll Section publishes manorial rolls from the Manor of Wakefield.

United States, 353 U.S. 657 (1957), is a U.S. Supreme Court case. The petitioner, Clinton Jencks appealed, by certiorari, his conviction in a Federal District Court of violating 18 U.S.C. 1001 by filing, under 9 (h) of the National Labor Relations Act, as president of a labor union, an affidavit stating falsely that he was not a member of the Communist Party or affiliated with such Party. Crucial testimony against him was given by two paid undercover agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who stated on cross- examination that they made regular oral or written reports to the FBI on the matters about which they had testified. Jencks moved for production of these reports in court for inspection by the judge with a view to their possible use by the petitioner in impeaching such testimony. His motions were denied. Jencks appealed this issue by petitioning the U.S. Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari. The Court held that the denial of the motions for production of the documents was erroneous, and the conviction was reversed.. Issues 1.) The Court was asked to rule on the appropriateness of the Government withholding documents or statements made by, or relied upon, by government witnesses in federal criminal prosecutions. 2.) Further error was alleged because the jury had not been instructed on the affiliation, membership, and the credibility of the government informants who testified at trial against Jencks. Holdings (a.) The Petitioner was not required to lay a preliminary foundation for his motion, showing inconsistency between the contents of the reports and the testimony of the government agents, because a sufficient foundation was established by their testimony that their reports were of the events and activities related in their testimony.Jencks, 353 U.S. at 666-668 (citing ). (b.) Petitioner was entitled to an order directing the Government to produce for inspection all written reports of the FBI. agents in its possession, and, when orally made, as recorded by the FBI., touching events and activities as to which they testified at trial.Jencks, 353 U.S. at 668. (c.) Petitioner is entitled to inspect the reports to decide whether to use them in his defense.Jencks, 353 U.S. at 668-669. (d.) The practice of producing government documents to the trial judge for his determination of relevancy and materiality, without a hearing involving the accused, is disapproved.Jencks, 353 U.S. at 669. (e.) Only after inspection of the reports by the accused, must the trial judge determine admissibility of the contents and the method to be employed for the elimination of parts immaterial or irrelevant. (f.) Criminal action must be dismissed when the Government, on the ground of privilege, elects not to comply with an order to produce, for the accused's inspection and for admission in evidence, relevant statements or reports in its possession of government witnesses touching the subject matter of their testimony at trial.Jencks, 353 U.S. at 669-672. (g.) The burden is the Government's, not to be shifted to the trial judge, to decide whether the public prejudice of allowing the crime to go unpunished is greater than that attendant upon the possible disclosure of state secrets and other confidential information in the Government's possession.Jencks, 353 U.S. at 672. (h.) The proper remedy in cases which the Government chooses not to disclose or produce documents it deems sensitive, or wants to keep private for security reasons is dismissal of the criminal charges.. Facts and background On April 28, 1950, the petitioner Jencks, who was president of the Amalgamated Bayard District Union, Local 890, International Union of Mine, Mill & Smelter Workers, filed an \\"Affidavit of Non-Communist Union Officer\\" with the National Labor Relations Board, pursuant to 9 (h) of the National Labor Relations Act.61 Stat. 143, 146, as amended, 65 Stat. 602, 29 U. S. C. 159 (h). He was convicted under a two-count indictment Jencks, 353 U.S. at 659. charging that he violated 18 U. S. C. 1001 62 Stat. 749 by falsely swearing in that affidavit that he was not on April 28, 1950, a member of the Communist Party or affiliated with such Party. The Court of Appeals of the Fifth Circuit affirmed the conviction 226 F.2d 540 and also an order of the District Court denying the petitioner's motion for a new trial.226 F. 2nd 553 The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari.. Two errors in the trial were alleged. Harvey Matusow and J. W. Ford, the Government's principal witnesses, were Communist Party members paid by the FBI contemporaneously to make oral or written reports of the Communist Party activities in which they participated. They made such reports to the FBI of activities allegedly participated in by the petitioner, Jencks, about which they testified at the trial. Error is asserted by the trial judge of the petitioner's motions to direct the Government to produce these reports for inspection and use in cross-examining Matusow and Ford. Error is also alleged in the instructions given to the jury on membership, affiliation and the credibility of the informers. Former Party members testified they and the petitioner, as members of the Communist Party of New Mexico, had been expressly instructed to conceal their membership and not to carry membership cards. They also testified the Party kept no membership records or minutes of membership meetings, and such meetings were secretly arranged and clandestinely held. One of the witnesses said that special care was taken to conceal the Party membership of members like the petitioner.Jencks, 353 U.S. at 660. It was stated at trial, \\"occupying strategic and important positions in labor unions and other organizations where public knowledge of their membership to non-Communists would jeopardize their position in the organization\\", had been a goal of the Communist Party of the United States. Because of this, the Government did not attempt to prove Jencks was an actual member of the Communist Party. Instead, the prosecution relied on entirely circumstantial evidence. Matusow testified he had conversations with the petitioner, concerning his activities in the Communist Party. The Government also attached an Affidavit of Non-Communist Union Officer in which the petitioner had affirmed that he was not a member of the Communist Party. Further testimony indicated the petitioner, who was a World War II veteran had encouraged Communist Party members to join various veteran groups in the United States with the intent of converting them to the Communist cause. This was alleged to have occurred in 1946. Later in 1946, Jencks was employed in the International Union of Mine, Mill & Smelter Workers as business agent for several local unions in the Silver City-Bayard, New Mexico area. It was testified one of the first acts Jencks performed as a union official was to meet with the Communist Party organizer for the area. The plan was to move the Amalgamated Union Local 890 into the Communist Party. J. W. Ford was a member of the Communist Party of New Mexico from 1946 to September 1950, holding important positions within the Party. In 1948, he testified he became a paid informant for the FBI. He was paid approximately $3,325 for his services during the time covered in the Jencks trial. It was planned that Jencks would run for Congress on the Progressive Party ticket in 1948. It was also anticipated that the Mexican-American Association of Phoenix would be infiltrated and converted to the Communist cause.Jencks, 353 U.S. at 662. Attempts would be made of a similar nature in the Mexican-American Association of Albuquerque. Ford's duties in the Party were to report \\"any particular defections from the Communist philosophy or any peculiar actions, statements or associations which would endanger the Communist Party of the state.\\" If a defection reported was considered important, the member \\"would be called in and would be either severely reprimanded or expelled.\\" Ford later quit the Party without apparent reprisal. The testimony indicated there had been competing interests in the labor union, in which certain members had wanted to end all affiliation with any Communist organization. Party members were instructed to not carry membership cards and deny any association with the Communist Party. It was in this context that Jencks filled out the affidavit required by the Taft-Hartley Act testifying that he was not a member of the Communist Party. General instructions from the Party were to not sign the affidavit, at all. Harvey Matusow was a member of the Communist Party of New York and was a paid undercover agent of the FBI. In July or August 1950, he traveled to New Mexico where he met with Jencks. He testified that Jencks was excited that Matsuow might relocate to New Mexico. At trial, he testified Jencks said, \\"we can use you out here, we need more active Party members.\\" Jencks, 353 U.S. at 664. Subsequently, Matusow began programs in New Mexico to applaud the Soviet Union for disarming, denouncing the United States as the aggressor in Korea, and calling for world peace. He and Jencks discussed ways to slow down the war effort in Korea by strikes at New Mexico mines. At trial, Ford and Matusow were subjected to vigorous cross-examination. A request for documents they had relied upon for testimony was denied without explanation by the trial judge. Opinion of Mr. Justice Brennan Mr. Justice William J. Brennan delivered the opinion of the Court. Aftermath of the decision Clinton Jencks starring in Salt of the Earth, a movie based on his story, made in 1954 In the wake of the decision, the United States Congress enacted legislation that came to be known as the Jencks Act.. It instructs the federal courts, in criminal matters to require production of verbatim transcripts and other notes or documents related to testimony by government agents, employees or witnesses. The request for the production of such documents must be made by the defendant. Production is required only after the witnesses have testified and are not generally available in pre-trial hearings. The Jencks Act sometimes corresponds with the requirement in Brady v. Maryland that exculpatory evidence be provided to the defense. Many federal administrative agencies have incorporated Jencks standards into their procedures. Most state courts have not. References Further reading * Caballero, Raymond.

It was launched on 30 November 2007 and currently distributed via digital terrestrial television, satellite, cable, and IPTV. La Trois timeshares with Ouftivi, a children block, between 6am to 8pm. Analogue transmission For a few years La Trois was broadcast from the Tournai transmitter on channel 60 in the UHF PAL system; however, this was phased out with the implementation of digitalization. Programming After its launch and prior to its major revamp in September 2010, its programming consists of reruns and live simulcasts coming from its main channels, La Une & La Deux and also original programming produced for this channel. It also broadcast movies, cultural programming and even documentaries during prime time. La Trois's programming was identical to that of the now defunct channel, RTBF Sat: live simulcasts and only reruns of programs produced by the RTBF, but continues the same programming as what was on RTBF Sat except sports. Since September 2010, when RTBF Sat ceased transmission on February 15, 2010, La Trois produces its own programming and became a public-service channel where they do not broadcast advertising, as RTBF Sat and unlike the first 2 channels, La Une and La Deux. La Trois also broadcasts children's programmes, movies and series in the original language with French subtitles, documentaries, archives, JT with sign language and reruns. A transition program took place between 15 February 2010 and 25 September 2010, when La Trois had its own programming. \\"This programming consists mainly of youth and some of cultural programming,\\" said François Tron in an interview on the 13:00 edition of Journal Télévisé on La Une on August 23, 2010. Among children's programming, a newscast is specifically produced for children, Niouzz (similar to that of the British newscast produced by the BBC, Newsround). Currently, La Trois's programming consists of children's & youth programming – branded OufTivi – during the day and during prime-time, it simulcasts the main news bulletin, JT 19h30 with La Une in sign language and later rebroadcast the news without sign language at 20:30, an hour after its live bulletin and also broadcasts cultural programming, documentaries and reruns. La Trois is also considered to be the equivalent to its Flemish counterparts, the 2 sub-channels, Ketnet (children's programming) and Op 12 (cultural and youth programming).

Topographic map of the Aburrá Valley. Aburrá Valley (in Spanish Valle de Aburrá), is the natural basin of the Medellín River and one of the most populous valleys of Colombia in its Andean Region with near 4 million inhabitants in its biggest urban agglomeration: The Metropolitan Area of the Aburrá Valley. The valley is located on the Central Range, over the Antioquian Mountain just between the Magdalena and Cauca valleys from east to west. The name \\"Aburrá\\" comes from an ancient language spoken in the place by the \\"Aburreans\\" (Aburraes) before the Spaniards settled the place during the 16th century. The valley is oriented from south to north being the south the highest level and the north the low level. The altitudes of the mountains around the valley (west and east mountains), can reach up to 3,100 meters above the sea level (Padre Amaya Peak). The lowest level is 1,300 meters above the sea level. From its north natural limit to its southern part, the valley is 60 kilometers long, while there are several varieties in its width being the wider part the one that corresponds to the municipality of Medellín with 8 to 10 kilometers and the narrowest the part that corresponds to the municipality of Copacabana with 3 kilometers. A northern view of the Aburrá Valley from Barrio Buenos Aires, Medellín.  History  Prehistory There is archaeological evidence of human habitation in the Aburrá Valley for the past 10,500 years. Spanish conquerors encountered groups there such as the Aburrá, Yamesí, Pequé, Ebejico, Norisco, and Maní—which were in the Valley since about the 5th century. The Valley’s name stems from previous habitation by the Aburrá, who engaged in agriculture (growing maize, beans, and cotton), textile weaving and decoration, commercialization of salt, and goldsmithing. Under Spanish rule the Aburrá lost possession of the land and were relegated to working in mines and other feudalist systems. Sickness brought by the Europeans, heavy work, and mistreatment led to their extinction at least from the Valley. Descendants of peoples who inhabited the Valley in ancient times can be found today in other regions of the Antioquia State such as Urabá and the West and South regions.  Spanish settlement  Marshal Jorge Robledo. In August 1541 Marshal Jorge Robledo was in what is today Heliconia, when he saw at the distant what he thought was a valley. He sent Jerónimo Luis Tejelo to explore the territory and Tejelo arrived during the night of August 23 to a plain field. The Spaniards gave the name of Valley of Saint Bartholomew that was to be changed for the Aboriginal one of Aburrá that is translated as the \\"Painters\\" due to the textile decorations of the natives.Restrepo Uribe, Jorge: Medellín, su Origen, Progreso y Desarrollo (tr. \\"Medellín, Its Origin, Progress and Development\\"), Ed. Servigráficas, Medellín, 1981. . However, the conquerors did not feel attracted by the valley due to the lack of wealth and the bellicosity of the Aboriginal people. In 1574 Gaspar de Rodas asked to the Antioquia's Cabildo four miles of land to establish herds and food stays in the valley. The Cabildo granted three miles.Restrepo Uribe, Jorge: Medellín, su Origen, Progreso y Desarrollo. In 1616 the Colonial Visitor Francisco de Herrera y Campuzano founded a settlement with 80 aborigines naming it \\"Poblado de San Lorenzo\\" in what is today \\"Barrio El PobladoEl Poblado Square\\". In 1646 a Colonial law ordered the separation of aborigines from mestizos and mulattos and for this reason the colonial administration began the construction of a new town in Aná, where is today the Centro de MedellínBerrio Square and where it was built a place called Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria de Aná (Our Lady of Candelaria of Aná). Three years after they started the construction of the Iglesia La Candelaria de MedellínMinor Basilica of Our Lady of Candelaria, rebuilt at the end of the 18th century.  The development of Medellín  In 1674 Medellín became the provincial capital of Antioquia. The new provincial capital would become during the next years the hub of development in the valley. The new city was located until the 19th century in what was known as El Sitio de Aná (nowadays the La Candelaria, MedellínBerrio Square along the Santa Elena Creek and the Medellín River. Places like El Poblado, Barrio La América, Barrio Robledo, Barrio Manrique, were just rural townships. Other towns like Envigado and Bello were very small villages. During the first part of the 20th century Medellín would start its industrial revolution attracting a great number of farmers from different regions of Antioquia. The small provincial capital became an overpopulated city by the 1960s with more than 1 million inhabitants. This had a direct effect over the other villages in the Aburrá Valley: many of them were integrated in the growing city like Robledo, La América, La Floresta, El Poblado, Manrique and others became themselves cities to be a part of The Metropolitan Area of the Aburrá Valley by the 1970s.  The Aburraen cities  The Aburrá Valley has ten cities within its mountains: * Barbosa, located in the lowest level of the Valley. * Bello, the second most populous city after Medellín. * Caldas, located in the highest level of the valley. * Copacabana, the narrowest part of the valley. * Girardota * Envigado * Itagüí * Sabaneta * Medellín, the flattest, widest and most populous part of the valley. * La Estrella  Description  The Aburrá Valley from the Quitasol Mountain in Bello. All the flat areas of the valley are completely populated. The majority of the people live in Medellín and the density is less toward the south and toward the north.

Life In 1923 Brauer was mayor of the independent city of Altona, Prussia, incorporated into Hamburg after 1937. Brauer fled the Nazi regime to the United States in 1933 with a passport of a friend. In 1934 Brauer's German citizenship was revoked. In July 1946 he came back to Hamburg working for the American Federation of Labor. In October 1946 after the election of the Hamburg Parliament, Brauer was elected as the First Mayor of Hamburg. After Brauer complained in a letter to the British forces about the supply shortfall in Hamburg, the British Governor Vaugham H. Berry stopped the heating in the officers' mess until there were a solution. 16 October 1949, the second Hamburg Parliament election took place. Brauer's party, the SPD, got 65 of the 120 seats there. His new Hamburg government (\\"Senat Brauer II\\") started February 1950. In October 1953, the next election took place. The SPD got only 58 of the 120 seats; an alliance including the CDU got the other 62 seats. Kurt Sieveking (CDU) became Brauer's successor; the Senate Sieveking started in December 1953. On 10 November 1957, the SPD got 69 of the 120 seats. Brauer and his third Senate started working. Brauer had promised to Paul Nevermann (born 1902) that he would transfer power to him before the end of the term. The 'era Brauer' ended 20 December 1960 with extensive ceremonies. By the West German federal election in September 1961, Brauer was elected as member of the German Bundestag in Bundestagswahlkreis Hamburg IV (later transformed, see Hamburg Nord). He was not a candidate for the next federal election in 1965; his successor in his electoral ward Hans Apel (1932–2011) became an important SPD politician and minister (finance, defence). Brauer is buried in Altona Main Cemetery. Honours In 1960, Brauer was given the honorary citizen award of Hamburg. The street Max-Brauer- Allee in the Altona borough is named after him.

In 1987, he became director of marketing for Mercy Hospital in Janesville, Wisconsin. He later served for three years as senior vice president of business development for the hospital. In 1993, Studer became the COO of Holy Cross Hospital in Chicago, Illinois, which was facing severe financial challenges.

The hospital's patient satisfaction rose from 3 to 73 percent in six months and improved financial results. Hospitals & Health Networks & American Hospital Association named Holy Cross \\"Great Comeback of the Year\\". Hospital executives from around the country began coming to Holy Cross to assess their performance and hear Studer speak about the progress made at the hospital. One of the organizations that came to Holy Cross to hear Studer speak was a team from Baptist Hospital in Pensacola, Florida. In 1996, Baptist hired Studer as its administrator and within a year he was named president of the hospital, where he worked to turn around the hospital's finances and improve patient and employee satisfaction. During his time at Baptist, employee turnover rate dropped by 18 percent and patient satisfaction at the hospital rose to the 99th percentile among all hospitals in the US.

The film stars Franco Nero and Corinne Cléry as a couple in a troubled marriage, and David Hess as a fugitive who takes them hostage. The musical score was written by Ennio Morricone. The film is based on Peter Kane's novel The Violence and the Fury. Plot Walter Mancini (Nero), an alcoholic reporter, and his wife Eve (Cléry) are on a road trip with a trailer heading back to Los Angeles. Along the way, they pick up a hitch-hiker (Hess) who introduces himself as Adam Konitz. Konitz soon turns out to be a sadistic escapee from an institution for the criminally insane, and he is running from the law after robbing two million dollars with his partners. He takes the couple hostage and orders Eve to head to Mexico. They are soon stopped by two policemen and after Walter attempts to signal them by writing \\"SOS\\" on his matchbox, Konitz shoots them both. While the three stop for the night, Konitz's two partners, whom he had betrayed to get all the loot for himself, shoot at Konitz and take control of the money and the car. They decide to keep the Mancinis alive until reaching the Mexican border. While driving, they are attacked by someone in a truck. The attacker turns out to be Konitz who kills his former associates and again takes the Mancinis hostage. After they reach a secluded place, Konitz rapes Eve and forces Walter to watch the act. As Konitz gets ready to kill Walter, Eve shoots him with Walter's hunting rifle. Despite Eve's opposition, Walter decides to keep the two million instead of going to the police. After the four young motorcyclists the couple met at a gas station pass them and pour oil on the road, the Mancinis' car goes off the road and crashes. One of the youngsters takes three hundred from Walter's pocket, but leaves the suitcase on the back seat untouched. The thieves then ride away. Eve is badly hurt and requests help from Walter. Walter brings Konitz's body from their trailer and plants it on the accident scene. He then tells the dying Eve that the thieves had only helped him. He had planned to stop after 15 to 20 miles, kill her and make it look like an accident. After lighting up a cigarette and setting the car and the trailer on fire, Walter starts walking and, hearing a car come by, thumbs a ride.

In The Devil Thumbs a Ride, a short documentary on the film, Nero states that he became involved in the film because he already knew Campanile well, and Campanile had earlier stated his wish to work with him. Nero was in Germany shooting 21 Hours at Munich, in which Hess also had a small role, when Campanile called him and suggested starring in Autostop rosso sangue. Because Hess wanted to work in Italy, Nero suggested him as the second male lead. Hess had earlier played a similar role in The Last House on the Left.\\"The Devil Thumbs a Ride.\\" Hitch-Hike DVD, Blue Underground, Inc. 2002. Just a few days before the shooting of the film began, Nero broke his arm at the set of the Spaghetti Western Keoma while giving a misbehaving horse a punch. Nero approached Campanile with his problem and the script was quickly modified. In the final script, Nero's character hurts his hand in the beginning of the film and Cléry's character drives the car. Because filming in the United States would have been too expensive, the film was shot in the mountains of the Gran Sasso, around the city of L'Aquila in central Italy. The location resembled Northern California, and American-like gas stations and signs were also created. Reception In a contemporary review, the Monthly Film Bulletin, the film was condemned for being \\"dependent on heavy doses of violence to keep its predictable plot moving\\" and was \\"directed in a bland and featureless manner by Festa Campanile, and overtly portentous in its dialogue\\".

In August 1846, at the age of 24, she married a young politician, Sidney Herbert, the second son of the 11th Earl of Pembroke. Herbert is said to have had a five-year affair in the early 1840s, with author and social reformer Caroline Norton, but they separated since she was unable to obtain a divorce. Elizabeth adopted her husband's politics and became a Peelite; when Sidney was made Secretary at War during the Crimean War, she became an ally of Florence Nightingale.Thurston, Herbert. \\"Lady Elizabeth Herbert of Lea.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 16 (Index). New York: The Encyclopedia Press, 1914. 13 June 2019 In 1861 Sidney Herbert died, shortly after being created Baron Herbert of Lea, leaving her a widow with four sons and three daughters. Lady Herbert of Lea became a Roman Catholic convert at Palermo in 1866, practising as an \\"ardent Ultramontane\\", under the influence of her intimate friend, Cardinal Manning. Only her eldest daughter, Mary, followed her into the Catholic faith; in 1873, Lady Mary married Friedrich von Hügel.Bedoyère, Michael de la (1951), The Life of Baron von Hügel, London: J. M. Dent & Sons. p. 9 She disliked \\"of Lea\\" as an addition to her title, and never used it, becoming known as \\"Lady Lightning\\" for her efficiency and ardour working for Catholic charities and interests. She worked in partnership with Cardinal Vaughan for St Joseph's Foreign Missionary College, Mill Hill Park, London, which was opened in 1869. The missionary students at Mill Hill became the focus of her life and work. When she died in London in 1911, she was buried along with Vaughan at Mill Hill, where her tomb bore the simple epitaph, 'The Mother of the Mill'. Social figure 49 Belgrave Square The Herberts lived at Number 49 in fashionable Belgrave Square, which Baron Herbert named \\"Belgrave Villa\\". Lady Herbert was the intimate friend and correspondent of many eminent Victorians, including politicians, such as Benjamin Disraeli, Palmerston and Gladstone; reformers, such as Florence Nightingale; and leaders in the Roman Catholic revival, such as Cardinal Newman, Cardinal Vaughan and Cardinal Manning. She figures as Lady Chiselhurst in W.H. Mallock's novel, The Old Order Changes (1886), and as Lady St Jerome in Disraeli's roman à clef, Lothair (1870). Disraeli described her as: > She was the daughter of a Protestant house, but, during a residence at Rome > after her marriage, she had reverted to the ancient faith, which she > professed with the enthusiastic convictions of a convert. Her whole life was > dedicated to the triumph of the Catholic cause; and, being a woman of > considerable intelligence and of an ardent mind, she had become a recognised > power in the great confederacy which has so much influenced the human race, > and which has yet to play perhaps a mighty part in the fortunes of the > world. Lady Herbert was a familiar figure in Rome, which she visited annually until almost the close of her long life.

In his position as mayor of Hamburg, he served as President of the Bundesrat (1968-1969). Life Weichmann was born in Landsberg, Upper Silesia, then part of the German Reich, to a Jewish family of physicians. In 1914 he began to study medicine, but volunteered at the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. After the war Weichmann studied law at the Silesian Friedrich Wilhelm University, Breslau, and graduated (Dr. iur.) in 1922. In 1928 he married Elsbeth Greisinger and was appointed as liaison officer to Prime Minister of Prussia Otto Braun. After the takeover of power (1933) by the Nazi Party Weichmann fled first to Czechoslovakia, then to France—with a short term of imprisonment (1939-1940)—Spain, Portugal and later the United States. In 1948 he returned to Germany at the invitation of the mayor of Hamburg, Max Brauer, and started his political career there. In 1956 he became a member of the faculty of the University of Hamburg. Weichmann died in Hamburg and is buried at Ohlsdorf Cemetery. Weichmann's son lives in Canada. Political career Herbert Weichmann Weichmann started his political career on a Soldiers' council (German: Soldatenrat) in 1918. In 1920, he became a member of the SPD.

It was designated a Ramsar wetland of international importance on May 24, 1982, and is recognized as an Important Bird Area. It \\"constitutes one of the most extensive sedge wetlands in western North America\\". The site has been under consideration for classification as a World Heritage Site. It is approximately west-northwest of the town of High Level, from the border with the Northwest Territories. It is being twinned with Dalai Lake National Nature Reserve in Inner Mongolia. Geography An expansive lowland wetland complex, the system consists of eutrophic freshwater lakes, and the floodplains and interior river deltas associated with the Peace River. It is at an elevation of above sea level. Water levels are determined by seasonal and annual fluctuations, which may be quite significant. Inflow from the Hay River greatly influences both the size of the lakes and their depth. The largest lake in the system is Zama Lake. The site has been subject to continuous oil and natural gas extraction and exploration since the 1960s, and is surrounded by degraded landscape as a result. In an agreement between the Dene Tha' First Nation and oil production and exploration companies operating in the wetland complex, no new wells will be built from 2007 onward, and complete cessation of such activities will occur no later than 2017. Fauna Wood Bison The complex is site to large populations of migratory birds during spring and fall migrations. Over 250,000 ducks and 177,000 geese have been observed during a single migration. It lies on the path of three waterfowl flyways, the Pacific, Central and Mississippi, making it an important moulting and staging area for numerous waterfowl species, the primary factor leading to its Ramsar designation. It is the only site in Alberta targeted for the re-introduction of Wood Bison, which thrive on a winter forage of sedges and grasses indigenous to the area. A group of 24 bison were first introduced to Hay-Zama Lakes Wildland Park in 1984, moved from Elk Island National Park, and its population has steadily grown to 700 members. The bison, however, have been following \\"roads opened up for them by oil and gas activity\\", straying toward the town of High Level, attracted by roadside grasses. Concern about contact between this group and bison from Wood Buffalo National Park, which carry brucellosis or tuberculosis, has led to the granting of permits to Dene Tha' hunters to cull straying animals, hence preventing the spread of these diseases. Ultimately, the diseased herds in Wood Buffalo will be eliminated.

The term is usually limited to known pathogens, but also sometimes includes agents such as Simian foamy virus which are not known to cause disease. Preventing the spread of these diseases by blood transfusion is addressed in several ways. In many cases, the blood is tested for the pathogen, sometimes with several different methodologies. Donors of blood are also screened for signs and symptoms of disease and for activities that might put them at risk for infection. If a local supply is not safe, blood may be imported from other areas. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) leads to the best known of the transfusion transmitted diseases, acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Blood that is processed into medications by fractionation is treated in a multi-step process called pathogen inactivation that is analogous to pasteurization: it destroys most viruses and bacteria in the blood. Donors are still screened and tested.  Viruses  Many of these viruses are controlled through laboratory screening tests. These fall into three basic varieties: antibody tests, nucleic acid tests (NAT), and surrogate tests. Antibody tests look for the immune system's response to the infection. Nucleic acid tests look for the genetic material of the virus itself. The third variety are tests that are not specific to the disease but look for other related conditions. High risk activities for transfusion transmitted infections vary, and the amount of caution used for screening donors varies based on how dangerous the disease is. Most of the viral diseases are spread by either sexual contact or by contact with blood, usually either drug use, accidental needle injuries among health care workers, unsterilized tattoo and body piercing equipment, or through a blood transfusion or transplant. Other vectors exist. Whether a donor is considered to be at \\"too high\\" of a risk for a disease to be allowed to donate is sometimes controversial, especially for sexual contact. High risk sexual activity usually includes: *Sex in exchange for money or drugs. *Men who have sex with men, the most controversial criterion. *A recent history of sexually transmitted disease. *Sex with a person who has had a positive test or was at high risk for a disease that can be spread in blood transfusions. HIV The virus that causes AIDS is the best known of the transfusion-transmitted infections because of high-profile cases such as Ryan White, a haemophiliac who was infected through factor VIII, a blood-derived medicine used to treat the disease. Another person who died of medically acquired HIV/AIDS was Damon Courtenay, who died in 1991 due to a bad batch of factor VIII. The standard test for HIV is an enzyme immunoassay test that reacts with antibodies to the virus. This test has a window period where a person will be infected but not yet have an immune response. Other tests are used to look for donors during this period, specifically the p24 antigen test and nucleic acid testing. In addition to the general risk criteria for viruses, blood donors are sometimes excluded if they have lived in certain parts of Africa where subtypes of HIV that are not reliably detected on some tests are found, specifically HIV group O. People who have been in prison for extended periods are also excluded for HIV risk. Hepatitis A *Not a major concern, viremic donors are often obviously ill, not a chronic disease. *Recipients of blood-derived clotting factor concentrates have become ill with Hepatitis A, but there are no documented cases of the disease being transmitted in transfused blood. Hepatitis B *The first virus routinely screened in blood donations. *Delta agent not screened for, since it is a superinfection of Hepatitis B and cannot exist alone. Hepatitis C *Often silent infection *Most likely significant TTI in developed countries =Alanine transaminase (ALT)= *Used as a surrogate for other Hepatitis testing, losing favor now that HCV tests have improved Human T-Lymphotropic Virus (HTLV I/II) *\\"HTLV III\\" Cytomegalovirus (CMV) *Not relevant unless recipient's immune system is compromised (i.e. infants).

The party's founder, Najah Wakim, won parliamentary representation in 1972, but boycotted elections in 2000 and failed to win afterward, leaving the party with no representation in government. The party was founded in 2000 and has recently elected a new leader, Ibrahim al-Halabi. It is a member of the March 8 Alliance governmentary coalition, and pushes democratic ideals while being popular with the younger, student generation, especially those at the American University of Beirut. The People's Movement opposes the economic policies of Rafik Hariri and his Future Movement and adopts radical alter- globalist, anti-American and anti-Israeli positions. The Movement is now part of the Lebanese opposition against the March 14 Alliance and is allied to Hezbollah, the Free Patriotic Movement, the Syrian Social Nationalist Party, the Lebanese Communist Party, the Marada Movement and several other smaller parties. The party's main ideas deal with the reformation of the Lebanese political system and strengthened relations between Arab countries. History Najah Wakim and the Foundation of the Party Najah Wakim is an Orthodox lawyer who was elected a member of parliament in 1972 at the age of twenty-six. He was a vocal critic of Rafik Hariri and strongly identified with the policies of Gamal Nasser. Wakim himself strongly believes in secularism, and his party evolved to bolster a non-sectarian style of government, contrary to the current government in Lebanon. A group of pan-Arab leftists including Wakim established the People's Movement as a result of the growing dissatisfaction with the current Lebanese government and foreign affairs. The We Want Accountability Campaign The People's Movement is notably tied to a political campaign called the \\"We Want Accountability\\" campaign. This campaign evolved out of the You Stink campaign in Lebanon, formed to fight the growing corruption in the government and the buildup of trash. The We Want Accountability campaign has recently carried out three protests. The first was in May 2016 outside the Central Inspection Department in Beirut. They protested corruption in the government and embezzlement of public governmental funds. The second rally was held in June 2016, protesting the privatization of Lebanon's last public beach in front of Beirut Municipality. The demonstration succeeded and the beach remains public to this day. The third and most recent protest occurred in September 2016. Protesters blocked the Grand Serail, rallying against political corruption. Political stances Ideology The People's Movement fights for peaceful, national unity in Lebanon. They idealize a government without religious boundaries, and free of corruption. The Movement considers things like embezzlement and bribery to be a big problem and would like to take measures against such forms of corruption. It attacks privatization and sectarianism. They rely on the middle and working classes banding together to abolish the \\"old\\" political class, and place a lot of importance on political reform and highlight how other reforms will follow. A popular mantra written on fliers of the movement reads,\\"للفساد، للطائفية، للجهل\\", literally meaning, \\"no to corruption, no to sectarianism, no to ignorance\\". Their movement reflects that of other People's Movements around the world. Domestic policy The People's Movement garners much of its support from the younger generation, thus the policies they would like to implement reflect that. They include placing pressure on the government to help relieve unemployment in the younger generation, granting access to soft loans to entrepreneurs with government supervision, stopping the immigration of intelligent people (the brain drain), and creating a planning ministry. Foreign policy The People's Movement is vehemently against relations with Israel and sympathizes with Palestine. It is against the call for peace with Zionists and fears Israel has its own agenda. The Movement focuses on peaceful relations with the Arabs and defense of the Palestinian cause, and they believe Israel solely wants to abolish Palestine. They refuse peace with Israel if Palestine is not granted its full respect as an independent country. They are also opposed to international interference in Lebanese politics, especially American interference.

Dice are dropped into the top of the tower, and bounce off of various hidden platforms inside it before emerging from the front. Dice towers eliminate some methods of cheating which may be performed when rolling dice by hand. There are many forms of towers and they vary in construction and design.  History  Dice towers have been used since at least the fourth century, in an attempt to ensure that dice roll outcomes were random. The Vettweiss-Froitzheim Dice Tower is a surviving example, used by Romans in Germany and has essentially the same design as modern examples with internal baffles to force the dice to rotate more randomly. Construction Dice towers can be constructed fairly easily. The main elements of a dice tower include: *the tower itself, a hollow, vertical rectangular prism with projections along the side (often called 'baffles') to sufficiently tumble the dice in order to achieve a random result *a ramp at the bottom which spills the dice from the inside of the tower *a small tray, into which the dice come to rest, usually bordered by a short lip to prevent the dice from exiting and disrupting the game or going astray Usage Interior of a dice tower showing ramps intended to cause tumbling as dice fall through the tower The dice are dropped into the top of the tower and bounce off of several interior ramps before emerging from an opening at the base of the tower. Some dice towers include a walled off area for the dice to land in so that they are not scattered across the table. Players who find hand-rolling dice difficult may also utilize dice towers. In tournament backgammon, a dice tower, often referred to as a dice tumbler, is commonly used to ensure fairness by reducing the possibility of a player's intentional influence on the roll.

Early life Born in the Kingston district of Glasgow on 28 June 1940, he was one of four children of a working-class merchant seaman. His father, Andrew, came from Eriskay, and his mother from South Uist, both islands in the Outer Hebrides. Roddy Wright, as he was known to family and friends, was educated at St Gerard's Secondary School at Govan. He began training for the priesthood, aged 14, at Blairs College in Kincardineshire, and then from 1958 at St Peter's Seminary, Cardross. Ministry ;Priesthood After he was ordained a priest on 29 June 1964, his first pastoral appointment was at St Laurence's Church, Drumchapel, Glasgow (1964–1966), followed by St Jude's Church, Barlanark, Glasgow (1966–1969). He returned to Blairs College as spiritual director (1969–1974). His next appointment was as an assistant priest at Our Lady and St Mun's Dunoon, Argyll (1974–1976). For a short while, he acted as a chaplain to the United States Navy base at Holy Loch. His last three appointments before his episcopal ordination were as priest at St Mary's Church, Fort William (1976–1980); St Michael's Church, Ardkenneth, South Uist (1980–1986); and St Anne's Church, Corpach, near Fort William (1986–1991). ;Episcopate He was appointed the bishop of the Diocese of Argyll and the Isles by the Holy See on 11 December 1990 and consecrated at St. Columba's Cathedral in Oban on 15 January 1991. The principal consecrator was Luigi Barbarito, Titular Archbishop of Fiorentino, Apostolic Pro-Nuncio to Great Britain. The principal co-consecrators were Cardinal Thomas Winning, Archbishop of Glasgow, and Keith O'Brien, Archbishop of St. Andrews and Edinburgh. Resignation and marriage Wright disappeared from his home next door to St. Columba's Cathedral, Oban, on 4 September 1996. Kathleen MacPhee, a divorced mother of three who worked as a nurse in Fort William, vanished at the same time leaving her youngest child with relatives. There was concern among local people, including Frances Shand Kydd, the mother of Diana, Princess of Wales. Wright had advised Shand-Kydd before her reception into the Roman Catholic Church in 1994. The following weekend, a former parishioner of Wright's came forward to say that she had become pregnant by him and given birth to a son in 1981. Wright resigned as Bishop of Argyll and the Isles on 19 September 1996 and renounced the office of bishop. Wright registered as unemployed and was spotted looking for work in the Jobcentre in Kendal, Cumbria, England. He alluded in his autobiography that Jobcentre staff had leaked information about him. Wright married MacPhee in a civil ceremony in Antigua in June 1998. Death In 2002, Wright and his wife emigrated to New Zealand. He suffered in his last months from liver cancer and died on 23 May 2005, aged 64.

History  When State Normal and Industrial School (now UNCG) first opened its doors in October 1892, it did not have a library or library books. Yet, founding president Charles Duncan McIver spoke adamantly of the \\"Library we are to have,\\" and he personally donated many of his books to begin the school's first reference collection. Other faculty members followed suit, donating or lending books from their personal libraries in order to create a collection for student use. The school's book collection continued to grow, and, in 1896, Annie Florence Petty was hired as State Normal's first librarian.Myrtie Scarboro, \\"Among Ourselves\\" State Normal Magazine, IV (March 1900), 64. On October 2, 1905, the library at the State Normal and Industrial College (now The University of North Carolina at Greensboro) moved from a small room in the Main building (now the Foust building) to the newly constructed Carnegie Library (now the Forney Building). Recognizing the ever-growing need for more library space, College President Charles D. McIver contacted Andrew Carnegie, a well-known philanthropist and strong supporter of libraries, and asked for the funds needed to construct the building. Remarkably, he agreed to fund the entire project, which totaled $18,868 at its completion. Unfortunately, tragedy struck the library on September 15, 1932, when it mysteriously caught fire. The final damage to the building and its contents, including the books, was estimated to be approximately $98,000 (or $1.6 million today). Afterwards, Mr. Charles H. Stone, the college Librarian, began the arduous task of rebuilding the damaged library collection. Books and materials that could be salvaged and saved were transported to the Students' Building while materials in the stacks were left in place, but were not accessible to students. The Carnegie Library was rebuilt and remained the primary library on campus until June 1950 when the more than 134,000 books were moved to a new, larger library building across the street, later named in honor of former Chancellor Walter Clinton Jackson. This older portion of the library still stands and houses much of the library administration and the special collections and university Archives. In 1964 the library became a federal document depository; it still retains the status as a selective depository for U.S. government documents, as well as a full depository for State documents. A nine-story tower addition was built to the main building in the 1970s, making it a landmark on campus.Trelease, Allen W. (2004) Making North Carolina Literate.

NC DOCKS includes many full text articles, audio recordings, dissertations, and other formats. All materials are indexed by Google and are freely available to scholars and researchers worldwide. The Digital Projects Office, a part of the Electronic Resources and Information Technologies (ERIT) Department, is responsible for coordinating digital preservation and access projects both within the library and for external keepers of unique historical material, including UNCG faculty and local cultural heritage organizations. The Digital Projects Priorities Team has identified four collection priority areas for new digital projects based on collection strengths and priorities within the University and the University Libraries: 1) University history; 2) local and regional history; 3) women's history; 4) the performing arts. Most of the reserve materials are now available online through Blackboard, but the Libraries do still maintain a small print reserves collection, located at the check out desk on the first floor. The Digital Media Commons supports the 21st Century learning and curriculum goals of University of North Carolina at Greensboro and the University Libraries by providing the space, technology, resources, services and expertise to support the digital creation of multimedia projects. Its goals are to provide interactive consultation services to UNCG students, faculty and staff in creating multimedia projects for their instructional and professional needs; to provide faculty development opportunities in creating multimedia assignments to develop students' information and digital literacy skills; and to provide the space and technology to screen, edit films and other media, practice presentations and collaborate.  Special Collections and University Archives The Martha Blakeney Hodges Special Collections and University Archives are located on the second and third floors of the Library's main 1950 building. Regular hours are 9-5 Monday-Friday when Jackson Library is open. Please contact staff when planning a research visit, class tour, or class workshop. Among the major book collections in Special Collections are the large and significant Woman's Collection, with titles from the fifteenth through the twentieth centuries; the American Women's Detective Fiction Collection; the Girls' Books in Series Collection; the American Trade Binding Collection; the Juvenile Collection; and the Book Arts Collection. University Archives collects the documents and records - both published and unpublished - relevant to the history of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. Records of the past Chancellors, a collection of over 50,000 images dating from the 1890s, and University and student publications are among the more than two million items preserved in the Archives. The Manuscripts section of the Martha Blakeney Hodges Special Collections and University Archives concentrates on acquiring, preserving, and providing access to collections that document the history, cultural life, economics, and politics of the North Carolina Piedmont. Collections include materials that relate to the subjects of art, education, local history and politics, literature, music, civil rights and human rights, nursing, physical education and dance, politics, theater, university history, and women's studies. The Betty H. Carter Women Veterans Historical Project documents the female experience in the U.S. Armed Forces through letters, papers, photographs, published materials, uniforms, artifacts, and oral histories. It contains more than 550 collections which include over 350 oral histories. Housed and maintained in the University Archives in Jackson Library, the materials are a research collection for scholars of military history as well as women's studies. The Cello Music Collections at the Martha Blakeney Hodges Special Collections and University Archives are dedicated to acquiring, preserving, and making accessible cello music collections for research and learning. The cello music collections at UNCG constitute the largest single holding of cello music-related materials in the world. Among the cellists represented are Elizabeth Cowling, Maurice Eisenberg, Bernard Greenhouse, Fritz Magg, Rudolf Matz, Luigi Silva, Janos Scholz, and Laszlo Varga. The collections also include musical scores and other publications which complement the materials in the other Cello Music Collections. The mission of the North Carolina Literary Map, administered by the Special Collections and University Archives Department, is to highlight the literary heritage of the state by connecting the lives and creative work of authors to real (and imaginary) geographic locations. Through the development of a searchable and browseable data-driven online map, users are able to access a database, learning tools, and cultural resources, to deepen their understanding of specific authors as well as the cultural space that shaped these literary works. Library Services The Libraries provide a variety of quiet and group study spaces in both Jackson Library and the Harold Schiffman Music Library. Students, faculty and staff may reserve group spaces, many of which are equipped with technology, through a reservation system on the Libraries' home page. Over 200 computers provide students with access to information resources as well as a wide variety of software. In addition to circulating books both the Jackson and Schiffman Libraries check out films, CDs and technology including laptops, iPads, video cameras, voice recorders and calculators. The Check Out Desk in Jackson Library, maintained by the Access Services and Delivery Department (ASD), is staffed whenever the building is opened, including 24/5 service during the academic year. ASD also offers reserves, on- campus delivery of materials to faculty and Interlibrary Loan for all UNCG users. The Research, Outreach and Instruction (ROI) Department and the Schiffman Music Library provide research assistance to UNCG students, faculty and staff and members of the community in-house and also through on-line chat, email and telephone. An extensive information literacy program reaches students from the first-year through graduate work. Librarians provide classroom instruction through the UNCG curriculum and develop a wide variety of online tutorials. Distance students are reached through both synchronous and asynchronous instruction. A Libraries' liaison is assigned to each UNCG academic program. Liaisons work closely with faculty to develop the print and electronic resources for their discipline. They also help faculty develop effective information literacy assignments so that students gain these important skills. Liaisons also provide in-depth research consultations for students and faculty. The Libraries maintain extensive LibGuides, online research guides, to provide easy access to resources in academic disciplines and other subject areas. LibGuides are also developed for specific classes.

He emerged from obscurity to overnight stardom in the 1970s, when he recorded his first 45rpm record, \\"Amada, Amante\\" for Discos Guarachita. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Paniagua's bachata albums were the best- selling. With his soft voice and romantic style, he appealed beyond bachata's usual working-class audience. He was also one of the first artists to form a movement of romantic-bachateros, artists who helped the genre emerge into mainstream music. Paniagua still tours and performs today in the US, Europe, and of course in the Dominican Republic.

It is the largest church in the Diocese of Toronto of the Anglican Church of Canada.St. Paul's Bloor Street – History History The first St. Paul's church opened on June 12, 1842.Landmarks of Toronto, 1904 It was replaced in 1860 by what is now called the “Old Church”. The current sanctuary (the “New Church”) was built in 1913, when Canon Henry John Cody was the Rector (Senior Minister). Cody Hall, built in memory of Canon Cody’s son, opened in 1928 containing a large theatre-style room, classrooms, a gym and a rifle range. Both the New Church and Cody Hall were designed by E.J. Lennox, who attended as a member of St. Paul’s at the time. In 2006, a large renovation (the Nehemiah Project) was completed, amalgamating all three buildings into one, accessible complex of 110,000 sq. ft. The building is protected under Part IV of the Ontario Heritage Act since January 12, 1989. The \\"Old St. Paul's Anglican Church\\" was built in 1860, designed by Edward and George Radford. The tower was completed in 1894, with additions in 1904 designed by E.J. Lennox. The \\"New St. Paul's Anglican Church\\" opened in 1913. There is also a heritage easement agreement on the property, registered on November 22, 1988. Description and services There are three chapels in the church complex (St. Paul’s, St. George’s, and Good Shepherd). During the week, those seeking solitude and prayer are welcome in St. Paul’s Chapel. The Chapel hosts new and regular visitors alike, and is especially popular with the working crowd at lunch. The church holds services on Sundays and a Communion Service on Tuesdays. The vision of St. Paul's Bloor Street is: \\"By the power and grace of Jesus Christ, we seek to be a transformative community for the city.\\" It has extensive children and youth programs, as well as offering many adult programs, along with Outreach ministries. St. Paul's Bloor Street is the regimental church of The Queen's Own Rifles of Canada (QOR), and a pew is designated for The Duchess of Cornwall, who was appointed as Colonel-in-Chief of the Regiment in 2010. The Cross of Sacrifice, a memorial to the fallen soldiers of the unit, stands outside the church. See also *List of Anglican churches in Toronto *E.J.

They were also sometimes referred to as \\"Eads gunboats.\\" The labels are applied to seven vessels of uniform design built from the keel up in Carondelet, Missouri shipyards owned by James Buchanan Eads. Eads was a wealthy St. Louis industrialist who risked his fortune in support of the Union.Joiner, Mr. Lincoln's Brown Water Navy, pp.17-18. The City-class gunboats were the United States' first ironclad warships.Because the City-class gunboats were built using War Department funds, when commissioned they were Army property. Because of this, the , commissioned over a month after the first of the City-class vessels, has the honor of being the U.S. Navy's first ironclad. The gunboats produced by Eads formed the core of the US Army's Western Gunboat Flotilla,The Western Gunboat Flotilla was a unique \\"joint service\\" organization. The gunboats were built using funds from the War Department, were manned by Navy personnel, and were under the ultimate command of the U.S. Army theater commander. which later was transferred to the US Navy and became the Mississippi River Squadron. Eads gunboats took part in almost every significant action on the upper Mississippi and its tributaries from their first offensive use at the Battle of Fort Henry until the end of the war.The major exception is the Battle of Shiloh; the two gunboats there had been built and converted in other shipyards. Early connection between Eads and the US government James Buchanan Eads The Submarine No. 7 In the early days of the Civil War, before it was certain that the secession movement had been thwarted in St. Louis, Missouri and before it was known that Kentucky would remain in the Union, James B. Eads offered one of his salvage vessels, Submarine No. 7, to the Federal government for conversion to a warship for service on the western rivers. In a letter he wrote to Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles, he pointed out that the catamaran-type hull of his boatIn the mid-nineteenth century, a vessel that was not intended to venture on the open ocean was referred to as a boat and never a ship, no matter her size or construction. The distinction has been lost, except in rather special cases. was already divided into several watertight compartments, and therefore could sustain numerous hits by enemy artillery without danger of sinking. As the interior of the country was the responsibility of the Army and not the Navy, Welles passed the letter on to Secretary of War Simon Cameron, who in turn referred it to Major General of Volunteers George B. McClellan for consideration.Joiner, Mr. Lincoln's Brown Water Navy, pp. 18-20. McClellan was commander of the Department of the Ohio, with responsibilities that included defense of the Ohio River and the parts of the Mississippi that were not in Confederate control.ORA ser. I, v. 2, p. 2. Official Atlas, plate 158. At about the same time that McClellan received the letter, he also had a naval officer, Commander John Rodgers, added to his staff. Rodgers came with orders to provide the department with gunboats, either by acquiring civilian craft and converting them, or by having them built from the keel up. As the Eads letter meshed with the orders carried by Rodgers, McClellan passed responsibility on to him, ordering him to St. Louis to consult with Eads and see if his ideas were feasible. Rodgers did not like Submarine No. 7, but his negative assessment was overruled by Major General John C. Fremont, who succeeded McClellan when the latter was called to Washington to serve as General-in-Chief. Although Rodgers had opposed Eads's proposal, the two men were able to work together. This was the beginning of their short-lived but productive collaboration.Joiner, Mr. Lincoln's Brown Water Navy, p. 25. City-class gunboats; Pook Turtles St. Louis, Missouri, in 1861. In furtherance of Rodgers's orders, he and Eads drew up a set of requirements for a fleet of armored gunboats that would operate on the Mississippi. Rodgers knew, as his colleague did not, the characteristics that would be required for a successful war vessel. Eads's contribution was equally vital, as he knew the characteristics of boats that could operate on the Mississippi, and also how to assemble the industry to build them. Together, they decided that the gunboats should have adequate armor to withstand direct shot from the artillery of the day; speed sufficient to be able to move against the current; shallow draft; and enough guns to present a serious and credible threat to the enemy. Not stated but well understood was the necessity of providing adequate accommodations for the crew, who would likely be forced to fight inside the protective shell of armor in the heat of a Southern summer. To assist in the design of a vessel that would satisfy all of these requirements, Rodgers called for help from John Lenthall, the head of the Navy Department's Bureau of Construction, Equipment, and Repair. Lenthall provided some preliminary plans, but he had to devote most of his attention to ocean-going ships, so he withdrew. Fortunately, he was able to provide a substitute. The Navy Department already had under contract a man who had experience in designing river craft, one Samuel M. Pook, working at the time in Cairo, Illinois.ORA ser. III, v. 2, p. 815. Pook came to dominate the design so thoroughly that the contributions of the others are often forgotten. Pook should not be confused with his son, Samuel Hartt Pook, also a noted naval architect. Pook designed a vessel, or rather a set of vessels, that drew only six feet (1.9 meters) while carrying 13 guns. Capable of eight knots, each bore of armor on the casemates and half that on the pilot house. In order to carry the machinery that would drive the great weight forward at speed while maintaining the light draft, the boats had to be made quite broad in relation to their length. Pook's solution was to give the hull three keels, the outboard pair somewhat longer than the one on the centerline. Propulsion was provided by a single paddle wheel at the after end of the center keel; the casemate armor that was carried back along the longer outboard keels provided the paddles a measure of protection from enemy gunfire from forward and abeam but not from astern. Each vessel as completed had a length overall of and a beam of . The length to beam ratio thus was a very small 3.4.Ocean-going warships of the time typically had length to beam ratios of about 6 to 1 or greater; for comparison, the famed raider CSS Alabama had a ratio of 6.95. The casemates had sloping sides, somewhat suggestive of the general shape of the best-known Confederate ship of the war, CSS Virginia (ex-USS Merrimack). When they were finally in the water, their awkward appearance struck the fancy of the farm boys who saw them, and they christened them \\"Pook's Turtles.\\" The unofficial name stuck. Gibbons, Warships, p. 16. Eads submitted the winning bid for the contract to build seven boats to Pook's design. His bid was $89,600 per vessel, and he agreed to complete them by 10 October 1861.The contract was signed 7 August 1861. ORA ser. III, v. 2, pp. 816-832. Because of changes in the design in the course of construction, the completion date was not met, and the cost more than doubled. By the end of January 1862, however, all had been delivered to the Army, where they were incorporated into the Western Gunboat Flotilla. The seven gunboats in the class were named for cities on the Mississippi or its tributaries. They were: USS Cairo, Carondelet, , Louisville, Mound City, Pittsburg, and St. Louis (later renamed Baron De Kalb). The first four of Eads's gunboats were built at the Carondelet Marine Ways (today part of St. Louis). This was a logical choice as St. Louis had the dry dock facilities, was a machinery center and had a ready supply of skilled tradesmen to do the required work. Most importantly, since the gunboats were to be used on the Mississippi River, building them at St Louis meant that at completion, the boat could be quickly put into service. This was 1861 and the thinking still was that the war would be short. The three other gunboats were built at the Mound City Marine Railway & Shipyard facilities.Gibbons, Warships, p. 17. Design Armament Positions were provided for 13 guns. Three gunports faced forward, four were on each side, and two aft. When they were first commissioned, the armament of most vessels of the class consisted of six 32-pounder and three 8-inch Dahlgren smooth bore guns and four 42-pounder army rifles. The exception was St. Louis (later Baron De Kalb), which had seven 32-pounders and two 8-inch Dahlgrens. In addition, some carried a single 12-pounder boat howitzer that is not counted as part of the armament.ORN ser. II, v. 1, pp. 42, 49, 52, 59, 129, 180. No description is given for Mound City. The mix of guns was changed later in the war; as this was done irregularly, refer to the individual ship articles. Armor The casemate armor was 2.5 inches (64 mm) thick, rolled in plates 13 inches (33 cm) wide and 8 to 13 feet (2.44 to 3.96 m) long. Total weight of the armor was 75 tons (68 tonnes). Pook's initial design called for armor only on the sides abreast the engines; Commander Rodgers, however, extended the plating to cover the forward casemate. The after casemate, hull, and deck not covered by the casemate were left unprotected.Milligan, Gunboats, pp. 29-30. An additional 47 tons (43 tonnes) of armor was put on following the battle of Fort Pillow. At the same time, protection against ramming was given to the hulls by railroad iron at the stems and sterns.Gibbons, Warships, p. 17. Engines The engines were designed by engineer Thomas Merritt.Milligan, Gunboats, p. 14. For a detailed description (unfortunately with no drawings), see ORA ser. III, v. 2, pp. 820-832. The 22-foot (6.7 m) paddlewheel was driven by two steam engines, mounted at opposite ends of the axle, 90 degrees apart. Five boilers, 36 inches (0.91 m) in diameter and 24 feet (7.3 m) long, gave steam to a cylinder 22 inches (0.56 m) in diameter with a six-foot (1.8 m) stroke.Gibbons, Warships, p. 17. The initial placement of the engines proved to be unsatisfactory. In order to protect them from enemy shot, they had been crowded into shallow holds, causing the engines to work both water and steam. To remedy the problem, the steam drums had to be moved to the top of the boilers. This meant that they were no longer fully protected.Milligan, Gunboats, p. 23. ORN ser. I, v. 22, p. 493. The Mound City disaster was the result of an exposed steam drum. Battles and other operations in which City- class gunboats participated After the gunboats were completed but before their crews were filled out, several of them were pushed forward into the Battle of Fort Henry, February 6, 1862. The boats involved sustained some minor battle damage, but they achieved a complete victory unassisted by the Army.Joiner, Mr. Lincoln's Brown Water Navy, pp. 40-41\\\\. Tucker, Blue and Gray Navies, pp. 123-126. Their success at Fort Henry engendered exaggerated opinions of their effectiveness that were dashed only a week later. At the Battle of Fort Donelson, February 14, 1862, four of the gunboats bombarded the fort and received return fire. All four gunboats were forced out of action by damage they sustained, although the armor minimized casualties.Joiner, Mr. Lincoln's Brown Water Navy, pp.42-48\\\\. Tucker, Blue and Gray Navies, pp. 127-131. Two gunboats were vital in assisting the Army in blocking the escape of the Confederate garrison at the Battle of Island Number Ten, April 7, 1862. By running past the Confederate guns under cover of darkness, they gave the first example of the new tactic of bypassing fixed fortifications. The garrison at Island No. 10 made a point of surrendering to the Gunboat Flotilla.Joiner, Mr. Lincoln's Brown Water Navy, pp. 60-62\\\\. Tucker, Blue and Gray Navies, pp. 135-140. Following the seizure of Island No. 10 and New Madrid, Missouri, the next target was Fort Pillow, upstream from Memphis. The mortar bombardment of the fort began on April 14, 1862 and continued until June 4, 1862. The gunboats assisted by protecting the mortars from Confederate counterattacks. One such counterattack, the Battle of Plum Point Bend, May 10, 1862, caught the flotilla unprepared for an assault by Rebel rams. Two of the gunboats were severely damaged, and avoided sinking only by grounding themselves in shallows.Joiner, Mr. Lincoln's Brown Water Navy, pp. 63-67\\\\. Tucker, Blue and Gray Navies, pp. 140-146. The gunboats were vindicated less than a month later, when they again met the Confederate rams. Whereas at Plum Point Bend they had entered battle one at a time, this time they were a unified force that was ready for battle. At the Battle of Memphis on June 6, 1862, four of the City-class gunboats were included in the flotilla that destroyed a force of eight Confederate rams, sinking or capturing seven of the enemy fleet. The gunboats suffered no damage in what was the most lopsided naval battle of the war.Joiner, Mr. Lincoln's Brown Water Navy, pp. 69-71\\\\. Tucker, Blue and Gray Navies, pp. 146-148. Two City gunboats were among the vessels that accompanied the Army on an expedition into Arkansas along the White River. On June 17, 1862, a Rebel battery at St. Charles, Arkansas, fired a shot that penetrated the casemate of USS Mound City and exploded her steam drum. The escaping steam killed or scalded almost the entire crew. This chance shot soon led to the abandonment of the expedition.Joiner, Mr. Lincoln's Brown Water Navy, pp. 71-74\\\\. Tucker, Blue and Gray Navies, pp. 148-149. The Western Gunboat Flotilla met the West Gulf Blockading Squadron at Vicksburg, Mississippi on ¸July 1, 1862, where the two fleets attempted unsuccessfully to capture the city with only token support from the Army.Civil War naval chronology, p. II-75. On July 17, 1862, the armored CSS Arkansas encountered USS Carondelet and two other vessels on the Yazoo River. Carondelet was disabled, her steering being shot away, so she grounded. Arkansas then continued onto the Mississippi, where she passed through the rest of the Gunboat Flotilla and the West Gulf Squadron.Joiner, Mr. Lincoln's brown water navy, pp. 85-86\\\\. Tucker, Blue and Gray Navies, pp. 210-211. The gunboats, now part of the Navy's Mississippi River Squadron, cooperated with the Army in the better-supported campaign to capture Vicksburg late in 1862. On a scouting mission up the Yazoo River on December 12, 1862, USS Cairo struck two \\"torpedoes\\" (now called mines) and sank, without loss of life. She was the first ship to be sunk by mines in the war.Civil War Naval Chronology, p. II-113. On December 27, 1862, some gunboats feigned an attack on Haynes Bluff, but failed in their purpose of drawing off the Rebel defenses of Vicksburg. On December 28-30, 1862, other gunboats supported the Army by bombarding Confederate positions during the abortive assault at Chickasaw Bayou.Joiner, Mr. Lincoln's Brown Water Navy, p. 104. Tucker, Blue and Gray Navies, p. 219. Also as a part of the Vicksburg campaign, a joint Army-Navy force moved up the Arkansas River and attacked Fort Hindman on January 11, 1863. The Federal victory there was largely due to the destruction of the fort by the gunboats.Joiner, Mr. Lincoln's Brown Water Navy, p. 105-106\\\\. Tucker, Blue and Gray Navies, pp. 219-220. As efforts to bypass some of the Confederate defenses at Vicksburg, elements of the Mississippi Squadron engaged in two operations on minor tributaries of the Yazoo River. First was the Yazoo Pass Expedition, February 6- April 12, 1863, which included one City gunboat. The second, the Steele's Bayou Expedition, March 14-27, 1863, included five. Both expeditions proved futile. The primary reason for the failure was that the vessels were not well adapted to the environment in which they were used.Joiner, Mr. Lincoln's Brown Water Navy, p. 104. Tucker, Blue and Gray Navies, p. 219. On the night of April 16-17, 1863, a large force of gunboats, including four City-class gunboats, ran past the Confederate batteries on the Mississippi River at Vicksburg. Most sustained only superficial damage during the passage. The ultimate aim of this movement was to assist General Ulysses S. Grant's intended move across the river to attack the defenses from the south. This committed the gunboats, as the boats could not return upstream while being subjected to bombardment from enemy shore batteries.Joiner, Mr. Lincoln's Brown Water Navy, pp. 129-133\\\\. Tucker, Blue and Gray Navies, pp. 230-231. Initially, Grant planned to cross his army from the west side of the river to the east at Grand Gulf, Mississippi, just below Vicksburg, where the Rebels had set up a pair of batteries that they styled \\"forts.\\" City-class gunboats were among the vessels used to bombard the batteries on April 29, 1863. Although the fleet was able to silence the lower battery and reduce the rate of fire of the upper battery, they could not put the latter completely out of action. The operation was therefore considered to be a failure, and Grant had to revise his plans to cross farther downstream.Joiner, Mr. Lincoln's Brown Water Navy, pp. 133-134\\\\. Tucker, Blue and Gray Navies, p. 231. After the Union army under Grant had successfully crossed the river and besieged Vicksburg from the Yazoo to the Mississippi, the Mississippi Squadron completed the encirclement by controlling the rivers. No notable naval actions resulted, but Grant regarded the Navy's contribution as a vital link in the campaign that finally ended on July 4, 1863 with the surrender of the city and its garrison.Joiner, Mr. Lincoln's Brown Water Navy, pp. 136-137\\\\. Tucker, Blue and Gray Navies, pp. 231-235. During the siege of Vicksburg, part of the Mississippi Squadron, including one City-class gunboat, was diverted into the Red River to capture Alexandria, Louisiana, and attack nearby Fort De Russy, May 4-17, 1863. The city fell with no struggle, but the attack on the fort fell on empty air, as its defenders had fled. Despite the lack of opposition, too much time would have been needed to destroy the fort completely.ORN I, v. 24, pp. 645-652. Once the Mississippi was opened following the fall of Vicksburg and Port Hudson, naval activity on the river virtually ceased. In this period of relative calm, USS Baron De Kalb (ex-St. Louis) was sunk in the Yazoo River by two Confederate torpedoes on July 13, 1863.ORN I, v. 25, pp. 280-289. Much of the Mississippi Squadron, including the five remaining City- class gunboats, took part in the ill-fated Red River campaign, in which they were almost lost because of falling water levels.Joiner, Mr. Lincoln's Brown Water Navy, pp. 143-170\\\\. Tucker, Blue and Gray Navies, pp. 297-322. This was their final significant action. All five surviving gunboats were sold for scrap shortly after the end of the war.Gibbons, Warships, p. 17. Evaluation of the gunboats The only meaningful evaluation of a warship is by comparison with its contemporaries in function. By this scale, the City-class gunboats must be given very good grades, as they combined firepower, protection, and mobility in a manner achieved by few of their contemporaries. Nevertheless, they had certain design flaws that would have had to be corrected in later ships of their general type. Their weakest point was the hull. Not only was the hull easily penetrated, but once breached, there was no way to isolate the damage, such as by watertight compartments. This made them vulnerable to mines (Cairo and Baron De Kalb)Milligan, Gunboats, p. 104. Joiner, Mr. Lincoln's Brown Water Navy, p. 138. and to ramming (Cincinnati and Mound City).Joiner, Mr. Lincoln's Brown Water Navy, pp. 65-66. Their armor was inadequate in two respects: both the deck and the stern were uncovered. The lack of deck armor made them vulnerable to plunging fire, which they encountered most famously at the Battle of Fort Donelson. The gaps in the armor left the steering cables uncovered, so at Fort Donelson and other encounters, their steering was knocked out rather easily.Joiner, Mr. Lincoln's Brown Water Navy, p. 46. Milligan, Gunboats, p. 84. In common with all other ships of their era, no provision was made for confining escaping steam if the boilers were to suffer battle damage. The most prominent example of the evil consequences of this lack of foresight was the Mound City disaster of 17 June 1862, but other ships suffered similarly, if not to the same degree.Joiner, Mr. Lincoln's Brown Water Navy, p. 73. Other ships that were disabled by shots in their boilers were at the Battle of Fort Henry and CSS General Beauregard at the Battle of Memphis. The peculiar three-keel construction and confined paddlewheel created steering problems that are often overlooked. The gunboats could not be backed against the current.ORN ser. I, v. 22, p. 665. Walke, Battles and Leaders, v. 1, pp. 437-438. These handling characteristics affected their use at the Battles of Island Number Ten and Memphis.Milligan, Gunboats,, p. 74. ORN ser. I, v. 23, p. 122.Daniel and Bock, Island No. 10, p. 74. Joiner, Mr. Lincoln's Brown Water Navy, p. 60. Today The wreck of USS Cairo was located in 1956 and has been recovered.

The title may also be understood as a metaphor for the relationship between David and the loss of his childhood, his plunge into the adult world. The title is also that of the book David writes (as an adult) about his adventures in the other world. Introduction The novel begins in World War II London. The main character, David, is faced with his mother's slow death. David superstitiously believes that he will save his mother's life by living in a strict routine (e.g. getting up on the same foot, avoiding anything related to odd numbers). David thinks that his mother's eventual death occurred on the day that he made a mistake in his routine. His father remarries a woman named Rose; they have a child, Georgie. While David tries to adapt to his new family, he begins to hear his books whispering and has \\"attacks\\" during which he sees visions of a strange land. He finds himself lured to another world, hidden in a crack in the sunken garden of the family's new home. While exploring this fantasy world, David has many adventures and lives out his own fairy tale.He also discovers his own bravery and learns what it means to grow up. Summary Soon after the death of young David's mother, his father remarries and they move into Rose's country home. Rose tries to befriend her stepson, giving him the bedroom of her uncle, Jonathan Tulvey, who disappeared as a boy. After Rose gives birth to David's half-brother, Georgie, David begins to hear his books whispering, and he has fainting spells. When David is in the woods, he looks back towards his house and sees a mysterious figure in his room. His father helps him search the house; all they find is a magpie, which they release. The next day Rose and David argue, and David longs to escape from his new surroundings. As he lies in bed that night, he hears his mother calling him and he follows her voice outside to the sunken garden. While he looks for his mother, he notices lights in the sky and realizes that a German bomber is falling towards the garden. With nowhere else to go, he hides in a crack in the garden wall. By climbing into the wall, David is transported into a fantasy world where he meets the Woodsman. The two begin walking towards the Woodsman's home, but end up running to safety from wolves and Loups (wolves turned partially into humans). They meet Leroi, the first Loup and their leader. There is not enough food in the forest to feed them all. The Woodsman and David eventually make it back to the Woodsman's home where David learns that the Woodsman used to have a family. After several failed attempts to return to his world through the portal, it is decided that the best thing for David to do is to seek out the king and his Book of Lost Things. David and the Woodsman wake up the next morning and ravel to the edge of the forest. As they approach a canyon guarded by trolls and harpies, a pack of wolves and Loups appear and attempt to capture David. After solving the trolls' riddle, David can cross one of two bridges over the canyon. The Woodsman remains on the bridge to keep the wolves at bay, but is overcome and dragged into the forest. David cuts the bridge's ropes, which keeps the wolves from crossing. On a road David sees seven dwarfs, who speak of \\"rights\\" and \\"liberties\\" and \\"resisting oppression.\\" The seven comrades (as the dwarfs refer to one another) take him to their home where he meets an obese Snow White, who is demanding and cruel. David spends the night with Snow White and the seven dwarfs, learning that she is gluttonous and waiting for another prince to come along. He also learns that unbeknownst to her, the dwarfs are mining diamonds. When parting, the dwarfs ask David to send them a suitor they can pay to marry Snow White. While picking apples, David sees a huntress kill a deer that has a young girl's head. The huntress captures David. He learns that she captures young children and animals to fuse their bodies together; with the body of an animal and the mind of a human, they make better sport for her. David comes up with a plan, convincing the huntress that she would be a better hunter as a centaur. He disarms her by cutting off her hand and running away, while many of her experiments return and attack her. After escaping the huntress, David encounters a soldier named Roland, who allows David to ride with him on his white horse, Scylla, and accompany him on a quest to the Fortress of Thorns. They find a battlefield with many casualties; a tank from David's world sits there, as if it fell from the sky. Here David meets the Crooked Man, who promises David the life he had before his mother's death. The ground reflects what looks like his father, Rose, and Georgie dancing happily. The image transforms into one of Rose and David's father making love; David looks away, so overcome with anger that he cuts the Crooked Man with his sword. In the distance, howls fill the air as the wolves find another bridge to cross the canyon. Roland and David spend the night in an abandoned church, where Roland explains that the king tried to force the people to follow a \\"new religion\\". During the night, David wakes to find Roland whispering to a locket with a picture of a young man. The next morning, David asks Roland about his quest; he explains he is searching for his friend Raphael who left to release a woman from a curse. They leave the church, followed by a wolf scout who is killed by the Crooked Man. Roland and David meet a group of hunters, who take them to their settlement for food and rest. A man named Fletcher lets Roland and David spend the night in his stable and eat with his family. Fletcher tells them of a terrible Beast which has been wreaking havoc. Roland speaks with the village elders; they agree that the best plan is for the women and children to leave the village for caves in the nearby hills, while the men stay behind to lure the Beast to his death with a tethered cow. After three nights the Beast appears. Roland tries to lure the worm-shaped Beast into the village, but it follows David instead. The Beast turns out to be female, and as she dies from her offspring bursting out of her body, the offspring are killed with fire. The next morning, the villagers return; Fletcher explains to Roland and David that it would be best if they leave quickly and gives David one of the Beast's claws as a keepsake. David wanders away from Roland and is pulled underground by the Crooked Man, who mocks his and Roland's friendship. The Crooked Man insinuates that Roland is homosexual and that he is only helping David because he desires him sexually. Roland rescues David from the Crooked Man, but when Roland tries to comfort him, David recoils. Meanwhile, Leroi and his pack have arrived at the settlement. Fletcher defies them, and they leave. David and Roland continue their journey. Roland reassures David that his feelings towards David are only friendship and respect. Roland claims that his feelings towards Raphael are no one else's business. They reach the Fortress of Thorns, a great castle covered by thorny vines and surrounded with the bodies of knights killed by the enchantress. At nightfall, the vines pull back to reveal a gateway. Roland leaves David with Scylla, entering the castle alone. After several hours, David enters the fortress to look for Roland. Each room David passes seems to be enchanted; one has a feast, which is poisoned, and another is a replica of his old room in Rose's house. He climbs to a chamber at the top of the tower; inside, impaled by thorns, are the bodies of Roland and Raphael. In the centre is a stone altar upon which lies a sleeping woman, who is his mother. He kisses her on the cheek and she opens her eyes, which are completely black; the woman now resembles Rose. David tries to run; she catches and tries to kiss him, but David scratches her face with the Beast's claw and she impales herself on the thorns. David carries the bodies of Roland and Raphael down and lays them on the stone altar, descends from the tower and rides Scylla towards the King's castle. En route David kills two thieves who try to steal Scylla, and the Crooked Man protects him from wolves. When he reaches the castle, the King sends soldiers to meet him. The chief guard, Duncan, takes him to meet the King; David is taken to his room to eat and rest. During the night, David is awakened by voices; it is the Crooked Man on the throne, talking to the King who sits below him holding the Book of Lost Things. The King talks of a mistake he made as a child and of how he wants to die. The Crooked Man disappears behind a tapestry, and the King returns the book to its place in an alcove. David sneaks down to the throne room and opens the Book of Lost Things; he finds it to be a child's scrapbook with some diary entries expressing the writer's hatred for a little girl who lived with his family, stating that he has decided to get rid of her. The book belongs to Jonathan Tulvey, Rose's uncle who disappeared with his adopted sister Anna, and David realises that Jonathan is the King. David finds a door to the Crooked Man's home. Inside is an hourglass with a little sand in the top bulb and a glass jar with the ghost of the little girl, Anna. She tells David of how Jonathan led her to the garden and through the hole in the wall, where the Crooked Man was waiting for them. He took her back to his home where he tore out her heart, ate it, and stored her soul in the jar. She also tells David that the Crooked Man is looking for another child to take Jonathan's place before the sand in the hourglass runs out. David takes the jar back to his room, where Anna asks him to put her on the balcony in the sunlight; there, David sees that Leroi and his army are at the castle. Outside the castle, the Crooked Man kills one of the wolves, then lures the others to chase him through his tunnels into the castle. In the throne room, David tells the King that he knows that he is Jonathan and about his betrayal of Anna. The Crooked Man appears, trying to tempt David to stay, promising protection from the wolves and Loups that burst in and massacre the guards. David refuses to betray Georgie to the Crooked Man, who dies after Leroi kills the King. At the Crooked Man's death, Anna sighs with joy and disappears. Because the Loups were a creation of Jonathan's fears, they crumble into dust after his death. The Woodsman appears at David's side, having survived the fight at the bridges. They leave the castle and begin to travel back to the woods; when they arrive, they find the tree open and waiting. After saying goodbye to the Woodsman and Scylla, David climbs into the portal. He wakes up swathed in bandages in a hospital bed; Rose is sitting asleep next to him. He wakes her, apologises for his behaviour to her, and falls into a deep sleep. Years pass, sometimes filled with pain and unhappiness as the Crooked Man prophesied. David grows up happily with Georgie, until Rose and David's father divorce; David goes to university, while his father lives alone in a little cottage until one day he dies of heart failure. Georgie joins the army, but dies in an Eastern war. David marries a woman named Alyson; she dies in childbirth, and their son (named George in honour of his uncle) dies soon after. Rose grows old and weak, so David takes care of her; when she dies, she leaves her house to David. He moves in and begins writing stories, beginning with a book about his adventures which he named The Book of Lost Things. Finally, David himself grows old and sick; one night, he gets out of bed and walks down to the garden. He climbs through the hole in the wall to the magical land. The Woodsman is there waiting for him and walks him to a cottage. Scylla is grazing in a field outside; she greets David happily, and waiting for him at the cottage door are Alyson and their son George. Literary significance and reception This novel was a departure for author John Connolly, whose other novels belong to the thriller and crime genres. Graham Joyce of the Washington Post reviewed the novel as a \\"distracting outing for the author\\".Washington Post by Graham Joyce Other critics had similar views of the novel as possessing unrealistic conventions and disturbing elements. References and allusions A feature of the novel is its retelling of traditional tales; characters, from Snow White to Rumpelstiltskin, are re-examined by the author. However, none of the tales are the same as when we last heard them. Snow White is now gluttonous and no longer charming; her dwarves are attempting to get rid of her. Little Red Riding Hood is no longer an innocent girl visiting her grandmother, but a seductive temptress who gives birth to the first loup (wolf-human). The figure of Rumpelstiltskin is an inspiration for the most despicable character, the Crooked Man. The novel takes place during World War II, and there are many references to the war and its principles. Throughout the story contemporary vehicles appear, such as the Ju88 bomber plane which crashes into the sunken garden and the tank attacked by the monster.

It was founded in 1951 (or, according to other sources, in 1947) in Łódź, in the period of Stalinism, when jazz music was officially banned in Poland, as it was regarded synonymous with the reactionary American culture and considered as part of Western, rotten imperialism. Origins Jazz music was played in the Second Polish Republic since late 1920s, mostly in fashionable restaurants and bars in major cities, such as Warsaw, Kraków or Poznań. Among most popular authors, played in Poland in the 1930s, were George Gershwin, Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart. However, there were no established, independent bands. Following World War II, new, communist government of People's Republic of Poland banned jazz music, after the initial period of fascination and limited artistic freedom in 1946 and 1947. It was seen as part of the decadent, American culture and as such jazz was outlawed, together with modern art. This stance of the government was disliked among rebellious individuals and groups of the Polish youth (among them Leopold Tyrmand), who went underground to keep on playing their favorite music (hence, the period of late 1940s and early 1950s is called the catacombs). Creation of the band According to saxophonist and composer Jerzy Matuszkiewicz, who is the founding member of the band, Melomani consisted of students of the famous National Film School in Łódź, such as Witold Sobociński and Andrzej Wojciechowski (Matuszkiewicz also studied there) as well as other persons from Kraków and Poznań, because in Łódź itself, there were not enough jazz-oriented musicians. Later on, Krzysztof Komeda, generally regarded as the best jazz player in Poland, also joined the band. Other members were Witold Kujawski, Aleksander Tomys, Andrzej Kurylewicz and Andrzej Trzaskowski, but the lineup fluctuated. Matuszkiewicz said in an interview given to Gazeta Wyborcza that even though playing jazz was illegal, officers of communist police, who controlled concerts, did not really know what jazz was. Usually, at the beginning of a concert, the officers were given a glass of vodka and did not care about the remaining part of the show. Given the circumstances (Polish musicians were separated from the West and Western jazz records were scarce), it is not surprising that the young enthusiasts were amateurs in comparison with American or even European musicians. The standard of performing jazz in Poland was low. However, this did not matter to the fans, as they embraced the band as the forbidden fruit. Melomani played the sort of music that they thought was jazz, such as Jelly Roll Morton and W.C. Handy. Initially, Melomani played to a very limited audience, but starting since the mid-1950s, they expanded their base, and were invited to several festivals, such as legendary Jam Session 1, which took place in Sopot in 1955. Aftermath Melomani existed until early 1958 when, following the so-called thaw of some rules of the system (see: Polish October), jazz triumphantly returned to main venues of the country, and was played even in concert halls, which had been unheard of before. First concert of a Polish jazz band in a concert hall took place on January 5, 1958 in Warsaw and as one may expect, it featured Melomani . Soon afterwards the band dissolved, because, as Matuszkiewicz said, it had fulfilled its task. Members of the ensemble created their own bands and Matuszkiewicz became a successful composer of soundtracks of several Polish movies.

He officiated in the World Series in 1954, 1956, 1963 and 1969, and in the All-Star Game in 1953, 1957, 1961 (second game) and 1968, calling balls and strikes in 1961. He also worked the American League Championship Series in 1971 and 1974, serving as crew chief in 1974. His 3,609 total games ranked sixth in AL history when he retired. Early life and career Napp was born in Brooklyn, New York and played as a catcher in high school and in the minor leagues from 1938 to 1940 in the Eastern Shore League, PONY League and Michigan State League.The Sporting News Baseball Register (1964), p. 376.

A judo expert, he served as a chief fitness instructor in the Navy from 1942 to 1946 at USNTC Bainbridge, Maryland and Staten Island during World War II.American League Redbook 1974, p. 39. He began umpiring in the minor leagues in 1948, working in the Middle Atlantic League (1948) and International League (1949–50) before moving up to the AL. Notable games Napp umpired in eight no-hitters in his career, and is one of seven umpires to have worked in two perfect games. He was the third base umpire during Don Larsen's perfect game for the New York Yankees against the Brooklyn Dodgers in the 1956 Series, and was at first base for Catfish Hunter's perfect game for the Oakland Athletics against the Minnesota Twins on May 8, 1968.Coberly, p. 139. Among the other notable games he worked were Bob Feller's record-tying third no-hitter on July 1, 1951,Coberly, p. 92.

The Madrid Protocol of 1885 is an agreement between Great Britain, Germany and Spain to recognise the sovereignty of Spain over the Sulu Archipelago as well as the limit of Spanish influence in the region. Under the agreement, Spain relinquishes all claim to Borneo. Another important point regarding the agreement relates to Article IV which guarantees of no restriction on trade to the parties of the protocol within the Archipelago and North Borneo. North Borneo Dispute The North Borneo dispute is the territorial dispute between Malaysia and the Philippines over much of the eastern part of the state of Sabah, a territory known as North Borneo prior to the formation of the Malaysian federation. The Philippines, presenting itself as the successor state of the Sultanate of Sulu, retains a \\"dormant claim\\" on Sabah on the basis that the territory was only leased to the British North Borneo Company in 1878, with the sovereignty of the Sultanate (and subsequently the Republic) over the territory never having been relinquished. However, Malaysia considers this dispute as a \\"non-issue\\" as it interprets the 1878 agreement as that of cession and that it deems that the residents of Sabah had exercised their right to self-determination when they joined to form the Malaysian federation in 1963.

Origins Lebanon in the 1930s witnessed the emergence of two paramilitary youth sport organizations of sectarian cast with clear fascist tendencies in Beirut and other Lebanese cities, the Lebanese Phalanges led by Pierre Gemayel and the Najjadah. The latter began its existence in 1933-34 as a Sunni Muslim boy-scouts organization founded and led by Muhi al-Din al-Nasuli, the editor of the influential pan-Arabist Muslim newspaper, \\"Beirut\\" (Arabic: Bayrut),Zami, Lebanon's quest (2000), p. 226 with the purpose of protecting the Muslim community and to act as a counterweight to the Phalangists. A keen admirer of Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini – whom were viewed at the time in both Syria and Lebanon as role models of strong statebuilders – al-Nasuli's newspaper (among others) was involved since 1933 in publishing Hitler's speeches and excerpts from Mein Kampf. He often criticized the \\"moral chaos\\" in public life and adopted the supremacist motto \\"Arabism Above All\\" on his own newspaper's masthead. Al-Nasuli's Bayrut also published glowing accounts of German youth's support of Hitler, featuring illustrated articles on girls in the Bund Deutscher Mädel, the female branch of the Hitler Youth.Thompson, Colonial citizens (2000), p. 193 The leader of the anti-British Palestine Arab guerillas in 1936-1939, upon his return from a trip to Germany, was idolized on the Bayrut pages, with both the information and the editorials being presented by al-Nasuli himself.Palestine affairs, Vols 1-4 (1946), p. 115 Although al-Nasuli promoted the Najjadah as the Muslim equivalent of the Christian-dominated Phalanges,Rabinovich, The war for Lebanon (1989), p. 80 and Sunni Muslim students from the schools run by the Maqasid Islamic Charitable Association provided him a pool of potential recruits, the group initially lacked much of the dynamism and organizational skills of their Christian rivals.Longrigg, Syria and Lebanon under French mandate (1972), p. 359 It did not attract a mass following until 1936 when Adnan al-Hakim, a Sunni university teacher and politician rose to the leadership of the organization and re-organized it into a structured political party, which grew rapidly thereafter. Political beliefs Often described as the Muslim \\"twin brother\\" of the Phalangists, the radical conservative and anti-Communist Najjadah also advocated Arab nationalism – expressed on its manifesto calling for Arab unity, the independence of the Arab world from foreign rule, and an Arab Lebanon – and although it never really worked for it, this did not prevent the party of attracting a very large following within the Sunni Muslim community, especially in Beirut during the late 1930s and early 1940s. In ideological terms, the Najjadah adopted early on a Pan-Arab nationalist line that strived for the suppression of all foreign influences (included that of the ruling colonial power in Lebanon, France), which deeply contrasted with the Phalange's own Phoenicist and pro-Western views. The ambivalent relation of such pan-Arab concepts with an ethnocentric and racial nationalistic vision became apparent in its slogan \\"Arabism above all\\" (Arabic: al-uruba fawqa al- jami).Nordbruch, Nazism in Syria and Lebanon (2009) A 1970s report stated that \\"the Helpers (al-Najjada) [were] Originally a paramilitary organization, this Sunni Muslim party was advocating pan-Arabism and Muslim-Arab socialism\\".Political handbook and atlas of the world (1970), p. 198Political handbook of the world (1977), p. 228 Structure and organization The third largest Lebanese right-wing Party after the Syrian Social Nationalist Party (SSNP) and the Kataeb Party or \\"Phalange\\", the Najjadah claimed in 1940 to have some 30,000 adherents, well-organized into uniformed paramilitary sections according to the prevalent Fascist standards of the time, which included a militia branch, youth and women's sections, and an official newspaper. History The mandate period: 1936-1943 Although by the mid-1930s both Najjadah and Phalange Parties ostensibly vied for Lebanon's independence from France, their sectarian base and conflicting ideological/identitarian views over the Country's future ensured that they would become entangled in the bitter political Christian-Muslim disputes. The rivalry between these two right-wing movements almost reached serious proportions on November 21, 1936 at Beirut, when a demonstration organized by the Najjadah in support of the Muslim struggle in PalestineZamir, Lebanon's quest (2000), pp. 233-234 was confronted by Phalangist youth militants. Its members had marched through the streets and alleyways of the Muslim quarters hoisting the Syrian flag and banners with slogans calling for Arab unity, which was apparently taken by the Christian militants as a provocation. Supporters of the Najjadah – by now a true political party – immediately took on the streets to protect the Muslim districts of West Beirut and to counter possible Christian paramilitary organizations' attacks on these areas. The World War II and the Fall of France in June 1940, caused an upsurge of nationalistic agitation in Lebanon, mainly carried out by the Najjadah and often in collusion with their Phalangist arch-rivals. Believing that the time was ripe for action pressuring the weakened French to accept full Lebanese independence, Adnan Al-Hakim and Pierre Gemayel agreed to put aside temporarily their political differences to form an anti-French united front, which began organizing joint large-scale demonstrations. The first one occurred in 1941, when the Najjadah and the Phalangists organized a march at Beirut in protest against the food distribution system established by the French mandatory authorities, which degenerated into violence when French troops attempted to disperse the demonstration by force. This was later followed in November 1943 by a nationwide strike called by both Parties, which once again resulted in violent street demonstrations broken up by the military,Gordon, The Gemayels (1988), p. 25. and led the French mandatory authorities to enforce a ban on the Najjadah's (and other Lebanese parties) legal activities until the end of the War.  After independence: 1943-1975  The Najjadah survived underground though, and in the years following the French withdrawal their president even succeeded being elected deputy for Beirut in the Lebanese Parliament between 1956 and 1972. During the 1958 Lebanon crisis, the party fielded a trained militia force of 300 fighters dressed in khaki uniforms and equipped with Italian- and Czechoslovakian-made small-arms which fought at the side of the pro-government forces, but saw its political influence sharply decline throughout the 1960s and early 1970s. According to a Lebanese military intelligence report, by 1975 party membership had decreased to just 500 militants and fielded a poorly-armed militia of only 100 fighters backed by Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait and Egypt;El-Kazen, The Breakdown of the State in Lebanon (2000), p. 303. other sources however, still place its numbers as high as 300.McGowan, Roberts, Abu Khalil, and Scott Mason, Lebanon: a country study (1989), p. 242.Collelo, Lebanon: a country study (1989), p. 242.Makdisi and Sadaka, The Lebanese Civil War, 1975-1990 (2003), p. 44, Table 1: War Period Militias.  Decline and demise: 1975-1990  Faced with the outbreak of the Lebanese Civil War in April 1975, the party's small armed force initially cooperated with the Lebanese National Movement (LNM) – Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) alliance until the Syrian military intervention of June 1976. The party – still headed by the now-ageing Adnan Al-Hakim – adopted a neutralist, non-confrontational stance by withdrawing from the fighting and reducing its political activities.Rabinovich, The war for Lebanon (1989), p. 80. Consequently, the Najjadah's leadership refusal to continue to participate in the ongoing civil conflict eroded its already fragile popular support base, causing many of its disenchanted younger militants to abandon the Party to join the LNM militias. Marginalized during the war years, the Najjadah re-emerged afterwards as a small organization lacking any real political support base, currently led by Adnan's nephew Moustafa Al-Hakim.

Ostrowski graduated in Romance studies and after World War I joined the SPD. From 1922 he served as mayor of Finsterwalde until he was elected mayor of the Berlin borough of Prenzlauer Berg in 1926. He held this office up to the Nazi seizure of power in 1933, when he was forced to resign. A fierce opponent of the Nazis, he helped hiding Jewish persecutees to protect them from deportation to the extermination camps.

He stepped into office on 8 January 1947, but from the beginning had to deal with the uncertain relationship to the deputies of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED). The party had been formed on 21 April 1946 by the merger of the SPD in the Soviet occupation zone with the Communist Party of Germany (KPD), strongly backed by the Soviet authorities. Though the SPD in the western sectors - including Ostrowski himself - refused this union, he appointed SED members for the city council against strong resistance in his party and was finally voted out of office on 11 April 1947.

It was premiered on February 16, 1884 at a Russian Musical Society concert in Moscow, conducted by Max Erdmannsdörfer. The piece was well enough received to be repeated a week later. It is dedicated to his brother Anatoly's wife, Praskovya Vladimirovna Tchaikovskaya.Fleming, 4. Structure The suite is written in five movements. #Jeu de sons: Andantino un poco rubato #:This movement is a sonata structure with a slow introduction which recurs at the end to round off the piece. The Jeu (Play) here is simply between string phrases whose endings are echoed by the woodwinds. However, when the fast movement begins, the constant changes of texture, accompanied by matching quick shifts between string and wind tones, are noticeable. The development is a fugue based on the opening of the first theme. It dovetails with the recapitulation, the first subject passing straight into the more melodic second.Brown, 'Man and Music, 258. #Valse: Moderato tempo di valse #:Unlike Tchaikovsky's previous waltzes, the theme is more animated and wide-ranging and includes changes in pace which would create havoc in a ballet performance. What is most notable, though, is not the tune but the orchestration. Tchaikovsky is now introducing in both texture and tone color a more unobtrusive variety into the accompaniment than would be noticed in a ballet where the attention is divided between stage and music.Brown, Man and Music, 259. #Scherzo burlesque: Vivace, con spirito #:This movement is more ostentatiously brilliant than the Valse and includes a part for a quartet of accordions. The overall impression is of fragments of melody flying around in all directions, their individuality asserted by their being well spaced out in the texture, often by their contrasting orchestral colors. Minute melodic fragments, even sound dots of one-note jabs from woodwinds or pizzicatos from strings, add their own accents. The bold folksong-like tune in the central section could hardly be a greater contrast. #Rêves d'enfant: Andante molto sostenuto #:At first a reassuring lullaby, this music diverts into some of the most strange, even unnerving that Tchaikovsky would write in depicting the kingdom of sleep, with strange, delicate, fragmented textures with no recognizable harmonic foundation. At the end of this section there is a pause, and the lullaby resumes as it had begun.Brown, Man and Music, 260. #Danse baroque: Vivacissimo #:The name may seem strange for this earthy music, but Tchaikovsky is using the term \\"baroque\\" in its original meaning of \\"quaint\\" or \\"grotesque.\\" The subtitle \\"Wild dance in imitation of Dargomyzhsky\\" is more helpful. The model for this music is the earlier Russian composer's Kazachok or \\"Cossack Dance.\\" Instrumentation The music is scored for the following: Woodwinds : Piccolo : 3 Flutes : 2 Oboes : 2 Clarinets (B-flat and A) : 2 Bassoons Brass : 4 Horns in F : 2 Trumpets (D and F) : 3 Trombones : Tuba Percussion : Timpani : Triangle : Glockenspiel : Cymbals : Bass drum Miscellaneous : 4 Accordions (ad lib) Strings : Violins : Violas : Cellos : Double basses : Harp Overview Composition Tchaikovsky spent the late spring and early summer of 1883 with his brother Anatoly after spending some hectic months before that writing first his opera Mazeppa, then a march and the cantata Moscow for the coronation of Alexander III as tsar. Anatoly, now contentedly married and recently a father, had rented a house at Podushkino, near Moscow. Tchaikovsky found the house's location to be attractive and he often roamed the surrounding woods, picking mushrooms. He spent three months at Podushkino, two of them correcting proofs to Mazeppa but also finding time to sketch out his Second Orchestral Suite.Brown, Man and Music, 256-257. When Tchaikovsky left Podushkino on September 13 to visit his sister Alexandra at her estate at Kamenka in Ukraine, his priority was to finish this suite. He spent two and a half months at Kamenka. The first five weeks of that time, six hours a day, were spent finishing the composition of and scoring the suite.Brown, Man and Music, 257-258. He had explained to his patroness Nadezhda von Meck at the beginning of September that if the work were not completed by the beginning of the winter concert season, he would not be able to find out how the work sounded during his time in Moscow. He was most anxious to do so, he explained, \\"because I have used some new orchestral combinations which interest me greatly.\\"Quoted in Brown, Wandering, 226. The fact that he took more than five weeks to complete orchestrating the work, despite his sometimes working six hours a day on it, shows the great care he took over this operation.Brown, Wandering, 226. Tchaikovsky finished the suite on October 25. Max Erdmannsdörfer conducted the work the following February in Moscow. However, if the composer's eagerness to hear the work were still present, he likely satisfied it during rehearsal. The tensions of supervising the Moscow premiere of Mazeppa, which took place the night before the suite's first performance, had tried him severely, and he left for the West to recover before the suite had been played. Erdmannsdörfer was offended by the composer's inability to wait one extra day before leaving.Warrack, p. 180 Reception The critics were unanimous in their praise for the Suite. They referred to its verve, its deftness of instrumentation, its ingenuity of structure and its wealth of melodic invention.James Lyons, notes to Antal Doráti's recording of the 4 Suites Analysis Texture rather than form was Tchaikovsky's concern when composing the Second Orchestral Suite, making it very different from its predecessor. One interesting point about the opening movement, Jeu de sons (Play of sounds), according to scholars is that the names of Tchaikovsky's brother Anatoly, his wife and daughter are encrypted in this movement. The cipher system the composer used is similar to one later employed by Maurice Ravel and Claude Debussy. In this system, the seven notes of the diatonic scale are matched with letters of the alphabet by assigning each letter in order of pitch, starting with every eighth letter until all letters have been used. The resulting theme is not characteristic of Tchaikovsky, reinforcing the idea that the composer worked more often by calculation than he did by inspiration.Fleming, 4. Unfortunately, working out of this theme in counterpoint which occupies so much of this movement makes it no more appealing for listening than its counterpart in the First Orchestral Suite.Brown, Wandering, 226-7. The other movements are not only more fascinating to hear but also form a collective landmark in Tchaikovsky's development as a composer. Previously his orchestration, albeit excellent, remained generalized when it came to exploiting individual tone colors. Even in the March of the First Suite, each section exploited a single sound world, not multiple ones. This changed in the Second Orchestral Suite. Tchaikovsky now aimed for a greater degree of particularization. Tone colors became more vivid, contrasts fiercer, backgrounds idiomatically designed as strikingly projected accompaniments. He worked to refine and detail his sound world to the point that whole parameters of his compositional technique demanded reevaluation.Brown, Wandering, 227. One change, apparent in the Valse, was a pronounced shift in melody. Previously, Tchaikovsky had composed his melodies in 16-bar increments, accompanied by a limited range of harmonic accompaniment. His intent in this Valse of including brisk and varied color changes prompted him to do two things. First, he widened the contrasts in melodic character between different 16-bar periods. Second, he absorbed a variety into the main melodic line that had previously been provided by subordinate fragments; this allowed him to make the melody reinforce the extra diversity in color.Brown, Wandering, 227-8. This modification of melody is modest when compared to the transformation of texture in the first section of the Scherzo burlesque. In the First Suite was a functional bass line, explicit harmonic support and solid, if stodgy, counterpoint. This was all replaced with a mercurial polyphony from which a large variety of textures could be imagined, from a single line and two-part counterpoint to tutti chords. Sometimes the harmony would barely be sketched in this textural web, but this web's flexibility, along with different combinations of instruments, guaranteed an endless variety of sounds. Tchaikovsky's achievement in this breakthrough was that he was able to employ it so discriminately.Brown, Wandering, 229. This discrimination is most apparent in the fourth movement, Rêves d'enfant, which contains both the most conventional and most daring music in the entire suite. The harmonic support for this gently berceuse remains orthodox enough in its opening half. Towards the middle of the piece, textures become so fragmented and chromatically ornamented that their harmonic foundation remains elusive. Only at the end of each phrase does a triad played on the harp bring a brief stability. This passage is totally unprecedented in Tchaikovsky's work and seems to leap ahead to the next century. Even in the enchantment music of The Sleeping Beauty, which would follow it, there would not be quite the same disquieting sense of the unknown as Tchaikovsky displays here.Brown, Wandering, 230.

It is located on the north shore of Lac des Chats (part of the Ottawa River) across from Arnprior, Ontario. Its settlements include Bristol Village, Bristol Mines (Bristol-les-Mines), Bristol Ridge, Caldwell, Doherty, Elmside, Maple Ridge, Maryland, McKee, Norway Bay, and Weirstead. History Bristol Township, already shown on the Gale and Duberger Map of 1795, was officially created in 1834. It was named after the City of Bristol in south-west England, known for its port facilities. The first settlers came from England, Scotland, and Ireland, followed later on by settlers from Germany, France, and Poland. In 1845, a post office was established, and in 1855, the township municipality was created together with the neighbouring hamlet of Norway Bay, an area that is now a sought-after resort location on the Ottawa River. Its first mayor was William Craig and the mayor as of November 2009 is Brent Orr. Canada's first horse-drawn railroad was in the Bristol area. It was operated by the Union Forwarding Company, and ran from Pontiac Village to Union Village until 1886. From 1872 to 1894, iron ore was first mined. In 1956, a new open pit iron ore mine and processing facilities were built, employing up to 300 people. This was the first iron ore mining and pelletizing plant built in Quebec. It closed in 1976. On April 24, 2004, the Township Municipality of Bristol was changed to Municipality of Bristol. Demographics Population Language Mother tongues: * English as first language: 78.8% * French as first language: 19.2% * Other as first language: 2.0% Due to the fact that many visitors come to Norway Bay in the summers, these statistics may change. Tourism and attractions Public beach at Norway Bay Norway Bay is a popular summer destination with hundreds of cottages and two hotels catering to tourists. Also located here is McLellan Park with a public beach and wharf on the Ottawa River. During the months of June, July, and August, Norway Bay is considered home to hundreds of families. At the wharf, there are swimming lessons, and at the beach there are kayak and canoe adventures. Norway Bay has grown incredibly the past decade due to the many opportunities it brings to all ages. Other outdoor activities include cycling on the Cycloparc PPJ trail, golfing at Pine Lodge the local golf course, boating, fishing, and hiking. In the winter, snowmobiling can be done on local trails, and on top of the frozen river, if temperatures permit.

Knapp 1936, vol. 1, p. 134. Career Davis studied to become a school teacher and was a lay-preacher in the Wesleyan Methodist Church. The Plymouth Brethren movement had recently spread from British Guyana to Barbados and other West Indian colonies. Their teachings were imbibed by Davis and he began to propagate them. Three of his own family also joined the Brethren. Limerick-born Dr. Thomas Mackern of Blackheath, South East London, visited the West Indies in 1866 to preach the gospel and to promote the literature work of the Plymouth Brethren in the islands. He met numerous Christians who had then recently broken with their denominational associations. He wrote, \\"They had begun 'amidst much opposition from professing Christians' to gather 'simply to the name of the Lord Jesus' – which meant that Brethren assemblies were functioning. The one chiefly responsible for this development was the young schoolmaster, C. J. Davis who for some time had been a local preacher among the Wesleyans.\\"W. Walters: Letters of Dr. Mackern: with an account of his conversion. W. B. Horner, London 1875. By 1866 he had sailed to Britain to study medicine with the intention to return to practise medicine in the West Indies. In London he settled in the north London suburb of Stoke Newington in the home of a Mr Holland. He became one of the House Physicians at St Bartholomew's Hospital, where in the first year of study, he gained the examiner's prize for proficiency in practical anatomy, and a junior scholarship in anatomy, physiology and chemistry.Napoleon Noel: The History of the Brethren, Denver: W.F. Knapp 1936, vol. 1, p. 134. He was an able and earnest evangelist. He preached to large congregations with much accompanying blessing in many parts of the British Isles. He records in his gospel tracts some of the locations he visited; these include Margate, Woolwich and Sheffield in England, Dunoon and Aberdeen in Scotland. At the University of Aberdeen he pursued his medical studies where he completed his degree of MD. He cut a very striking figure and quickly drew crowds when preaching in the open air. A contemporary friend, a Harley Street doctor, A. T. Schofield, wrote that Davis was \\"a tall and distinguished looking man\\".A. T. Schofield, The Teachers Taught. He used to preach from a kitchen table in Union Street, Aberdeen, the result of which was the establishment of a very large assembly of Brethren in that city. In Aberdeen he delivered a series of lectures which were published the year of his death as Aids to Believers. He also wrote a tract on The Lord's Coming, and an evangelistic book, The Grace of God. His Aids to Believers ran through at least 18 editions in the first half of the 20th century. His final evangelistic narrative, The Teachers Taught, is in print with a number of publishers. Franco-Prussian War During the Franco-Prussian war in 1870 he volunteered his services to assist the suffering and cholera-stricken peasantry of eastern France, especially at the Battle of Sedan. He devoted himself with skill and energy to the treatment of large numbers of sick and wounded and to the establishment of soup kitchens which gave food and life to multitudes of starving people. He was an enthusiast for his soup kitchens, so that, when on one occasion, the sister of the Protestant Pastor at Sedan (Miss Goulden) told him there was not sufficient soup, he took his watch from his pocket, gained as a prize at College and sold it to pay for the immediate needs. For this special war-work Mr and Mrs Chrimes of Moorgate,Guest and Chrimes . rotherhamweb.co.uk Rotherham, England, made the young physician almoner of a thousand pounds for the poor and sick among whom he laboured. Dr Davis also ran an ambulance, which was regarded as the finest one in the neighbourhood. He also took care of several hundred wounded Bavarians in dire need of aid. It was in this final benevolent service in war-torn Europe that he assumed the honourable nickname, \\"The Good Black Doctor\\". Death Two Englishwomen, Emma Maria Pearson (1828–93) and Louisa Elisabeth MacLaughlin (1836–1921), wrote this of him: :\\"Dr. Davis, at Pongy-sur-Meuse, had 300 sick and wounded, all Bavarians. … Fever and diarrhoea were very prevalent, especially amongst the Bavarian troops, who ate large quantities of unripe grapes and apples. An application was made by a physician of colour, Dr. Davis, of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, who had established a hospital just across the Meuse for the services of Louise and myself in his Ambulance, not so much to nurse the sick (he had no wounded), but to see that the German orderlies did their duty, and to prevent the entrance of green fruit. Davis died of smallpox, about two months afterwards, at Pongy-sur-Meuse, where he had his Ambulance, beloved, and mourned by all who had ever come in contact with him.\\"Emma Maria Pearson and Louisa Elisabeth MacLaughlin: Our Adventures During the War of 1870 by Two Englishwomen, London: Richard Bentley and Son 1871. \\"But his enthusiasm\\", said The Lancet medical journal, \\"carried him beyond his strength, and, returning in an exhausted condition from a short visit to England, where he had been to seek further funds, he was attacked with small-pox, of which he died on the 27th November, at the age of twenty- eight\\".\\"Le Bon Docteur Noir\\", in The Lancet, 10 December 1870, p. 830. Davis was greatly loved for his impartial service upon his death was given a military funeral which was followed by troops of both armies, headed by the Mayor of Sedan. His tombstone records the high esteem in which he was held. He was buried in the quiet graveyard of Fond de Givonne, just outside Sedan. In one of his tracts, the Grace Appearing and reigning; Glory to Appear, he wrote, \\"go out and visit the sick – feed the hungry; and if you have the gift, explain the word of life to the poor and ignorant … All can do good in some way; with time or worldly goods … this is our time to do as receivers of grace.

Though he built his reputation through investigations of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and the Canadian Forces, he is best known for the controversy created in Canada after the publication of his book Le Livre noir du Canada anglais (\\"The Black Book of English Canada\\") in 2005. Biography Born to a Romanian immigrant and a French Canadian mother, Lester started his career in journalism in 1964. Two years later, he began a 35-year career as a reporter for the Radio-Canada, in which he found himself posted around the Western world, being posted in Washington, New York City and Paris. In 1986, he was posted as parliamentary correspondent in Ottawa. He began to investigate and study the activities of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, which had been created that year to take over duties formerly under the aegis of the RCMP. This would be the beginning of a long string of reports, some shocking, on the activities of CSIS, lasting twelve years. He investigated Claude Morin, cabinet minister and close advisor to René Lévesque and also a paid informant of the RCMP. After the publication of the first part of the trilogy that is Livre noir du Canada anglais, Radio-Canada suspended him from his work on November 18, 2001, citing a lack of impartiality. A few days later, Société Saint-Jean-Baptiste awarded him the Prix Olivar-Asselin for both his courage and excellence in investigative journalism. On December 5, 2001, after 35 years of service, Lester quit Radio-Canada. Since then, he has written for various newspapers, such as le Devoir. In 2002, TVA hired him as a news commentator. In September 2005, he decided to quit for a similar job at TQS, with Jean-Luc Mongrain.

The ecoregion is bounded by the Aegean and Western Turkey sclerophyllous and mixed forests (in Greece), Pindus Mountains mixed forests (in Greece and Albania), Dinaric Mountains mixed forests (in Albania, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Slovenia and Italy) and Po Basin mixed forests (in Italy). Climate The climate of the ecoregion is mostly of Köppen's Mediterranean type with hot summers (Csa) to humid subtropical with wet winters (Cfa). Flora Due to the wide altitudinal range of this ecoregion the highest elevations (above 1,000 m) are covered with conifer forests, with a mixed broadleaf vegetation and maquis shrubland occurring lower. The conifer zone is dominated by the Norway spruce, silver fir and European black pine with the admixture of the European beech. The dominant species of the lower zones include various deciduous oaks (Quercus frainetto, Q. pubescens, Q. cerris), Carpinus orientalis, Fraxinus ornus with Cotinus coggygria, Paliurus spina-christi, Cercis siliquastrum. Evergreen trees and maquis shrubs (Quercus ilex, Pinus halepensis, Pistacia terebinthus, P. lentiscus, Juniperus oxycedrus, J. macrocarpa, Arbutus unedo, A. andrachne, Nerium oleander) become predominant near the coast.

When the Spanish–American War began in April 1898, she was at sea on a cruise around the island of Luzon. Her crew was unaware that war had been declared or that the Spanish Navy squadron of Rear Admiral Patricio Montojo y Pasaron had been destroyed by the U.S. Navy's Asiatic Squadron under Commodore George Dewey in the Battle of Manila Bay eleven days earlier when, on 12 May 1898, Callao steamed into Manila Bay en route the harbor. When Dewey's ships sighted the inbound gunboat, cruiser USS Raleigh got underway to investigate. When it became apparent that Callao was a Spanish ship, Raleigh, cruiser USS Baltimore, and protected cruiser USS Olympia opened fire on her.The Spanish–American War Centennial Website: Gunboat Callao Taken utterly by surprise, Callaos crew at first mistook the American ships for Montojo's squadron and the gunfire for target practice by Montojo's ships, but quickly realized that they were under attack and hopelessly outgunned. They struck their colors and surrendered to Raleigh. They were quickly paroled ashore at Cavite, and it was later rumored that the commanding officer of Callao was sentenced to death by Spanish authorities for not fighting back against the American ships. Callao was immediately put into American service, and was officially commissioned into the U.S. Navy on 17 July 1898Per The Spanish–American War Centennial Website: Gunboat Callao and the Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships, although Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships 1860–1905, p. 167, and The Spanish–American War Centennial Website: Spanish 2nd-Class Gunboats both claim the commissioning date was 2 July 1898 as gunboat USS Callao.

Emil. Biography Elizabeth Gilels was born in Odessa into a Jewish family. Her father Grigory Gilels was a clerk at the sugar refinery, and her mother Gesya Gilels was a housewife. Elizabeth had multiple siblings, including children from previous marriages by both of her parents. Despite not being directly connected to a music scene, the family produced two outstanding musicians: first Emil Gilels and three years later Elizabeth herself. \\"In Odessa, in spite of the hard times, the public enjoyed music very much. All attention was given to musically gifted children. In a modest Gilels’s flat in a poor and famous district of Odessa called Moldavanka there was a grand piano and already at the age of two little Emil showed interest in it touching keys and listening to them. He was also interested in other sounds: performance of brass bands, singing, tolling of bells.\\"Elena Fedorovich, Ekaterinburg, 2007 Little Yelizaveta, consequently was surrounded by music at an early age. Elizabeth commenced her violin studies with famous pedagogue, Pyotr Stolyarsky whose star pupils included David Oistrakh, Nathan Milstein and Boris Goldstein. Later she studied with Abram Yampolsky (1890–1956) in Moscow. Early on in her career, she’d formed a youthful duo with her brother. In 1937 she became a prizewinner of the Ysaÿe competition (later becoming Queen Elizabeth Competition) in Brussels. Stolyarsky's students caused a sensation at this competition as top prizes were garnered by David Oistrakh, Boris Goldshtein (Goldstein), Yelizaveta (Elizabeth) Gilels and Mikhail Fikhtengoltz. \\"The results of the sessions created a profound impression: the Soviet school, with an assurance that bordered on arrogance, carried off all the prizes from the first down. The latter was awarded without the slightest discussion to the great David Oistrakh. Everyone else had to be content with crumbs; the Belgian violin school, though still a source of pride, failed, and its absence at the final was much commented on; Arthur Grumiaux and Carlo Van Neste, both young and inexperienced, were not able to convince the jury.\\"The Queen Elisabeth Competition It wasn’t until after the WWII that she formed a duo with Leonid Kogan – their Bach's Double Concerto performance became famous, and they also managed to find and perform some of the more out-of-the-way pieces, as well as works dedicated to them, such as sonata by Weinberg. From 1966 onwards she taught at the Moscow Conservatory, where she earned a title of professor in 1987. She was a consummate artist and had a great influence on her students. She has published a still popular study book of Scales & Double stops for violin. Despite her significant achievements as a performer, outside of the USSR she was mostly known in a dual role as, first, a wife of the legendary Leonid Kogan and, second, a sister of the eminent Emil Gilels. She died in Moscow on 13 March 2008, at the age of 88. She is survived by her children Pavel Kogan and Nina Kogan, and her grandchildren Dmitry Kogan, Victoria Korchinskaya-Kogan and Daniel Milkis.

The station opened on 19 September 2005 and is operated by the Utah Transit Authority. 900 South is notable for being the first infill station constructed along an existing line of the TRAX system. Description The station is located at 900 South 200 West. The island platform, capable of serving up to four-car trains, is located in the median of 200 West between 800 South and 900 South. Unlike many TRAX stations, 900 South does not have a Park and Ride lot. This station is operated by Utah Transit Authority. As part of the UTA's Art in Transit program, 900 South features three high glass sculptures featuring the likenesses of 15 neighborhood children. Created by local artists Dan Cummings, Dinah Ihle and Kerry Transtrum, the sculptures are meant to illustrate the diversity of the people living in the neighborhood adjacent to the station. The artists also created four platform benches in the shape of clasping hands in the central portion of the platform, between the two canopies resembling the canopy at the Joseph Smith Memorial Building.

History A station at 900 South was proposed as part of the original Sandy/Salt Lake Line completed in 1999. Although no station was yet in place, by 2000 local developers began to develop high-density housing and retail uses in the vicinity of where the 900 South station was once proposed. As a result of the creation of higher-density housing in providing for a ridership base, on 6 April 2004, UTA officials announced a station at 900 South would be constructed. By November both UTA and Salt Lake City signed an agreement for the construction of the $1.2 million station to be funded through the Redevelopment Agency of Salt Lake City. Groundbreaking for the station occurred on 21 April 2005. UTA officials announced the addition of the station would only add an additional two minutes to the existing travel time between the termini and represent the first infill station completed along the line since its opening in 1999. The station commenced service on 19 September 2005, following six months of construction. Train schedules Train schedules are current as of Change Day, 8 December 2013.

The Blue Line provides service from Downtown Salt Lake City to Draper. The Red Line provides service from the University of Utah to the Daybreak Community of South Jordan. The Green Line provides service from the Salt Lake City International Airport to West Valley City (via Downtown Salt Lake City).  Description  The station is located at 180 West 1300 South (1300 South is a major east-west route through Salt Lake City and the station is easily accessed from that street). It is about a half a block northwest of the Smith's Ballpark, home to the Salt Lake Bees. Two driveways from 1300 South allow access to the station by vehicles and buses from the south side of the station. Sidewalks on 1300 South and Lucy Lane to the north allow pedestrian and bicycle access. There is direct access to the platform from the sidewalk on the north side of 1300 South. The 1300 South cross street provides direct access to the major north- south arterial roads—West Temple Street, Main Street and State Street (US 89) to the east and 300 West and Interstate 15/80 to the west. The station has a Park and Ride lot with 170 free parking spaces available. There is also a dedicated parking space is allocated to U Car Share, a carsharing company operating in Salt Lake City. The station was opened on December 4, 1999 and is operated by the Utah Transit Authority.  History  Ballpark is near the point where the Salt Lake and Utah interurban streetcar line crossed the first mainline built south from Salt Lake City (which has been known by many names, but is most associated with the Union Pacific Railroad). The TRAX tracks north of the station follow the old route of the Salt Lake and Utah, while the tracks south of the area follow those used by Union Pacific. The electrified spur track visible to the northwest of the current station is the northern continuation of the original Union Pacific mainline; only a few traces of the southern continuation of the Salt Lake and Utah line (which headed due southwest to the vicinity of UTA's Redwood Junction station before turning south) remain. In 1997, when planning for the rebuilt Sandy/Salt Lake line, UTA had envisioned that the area around the station would go through an urban renewal, with some of the older houses renovated and new multi-family living constructed around the station. However, UTA property manager Richard Swenson admitted that, \\"I don't think developers have caught the vision yet.\\" The station was part of the original TRAX line (now the Blue Line), which opened December 4, 1999. Students from the nearby Horizonte Instruction and Training Center painted a mural along the side of one of the businesses that are located along the west side of the station in 2000, which were frequent targets for graffiti artists. A Salt Lake City official stated that these murals help keep down graffiti because \\"...the gangs for some reason respect that kind of artwork.\\" The Park and Ride lot was filled to capacity on most nights during the 2002 Winter Olympics due to the high use of TRAX and buses by locals and spectators. In 2003, Ballpark had the third highest auto-theft numbers out of all TRAX stations, behind Historic Sandy and Sandy Civic Center. On October 31, 2006, then-governor Jon Huntsman, Jr. held a press conference at the station to support Proposition 3, which instituted a quarter-cent raise in the state's sales tax in Salt Lake and Utah counties. Proposition 3 included funding for FrontRunner and, at the time, 33 unknown projects in Salt Lake County.  Services  The single island platform, capable of serving up to four-car trains, is located on the west side of the property. Two shelters are located on the platform covering small seating areas, with pictures of former Salt Lake Bees players lining the inside canopy. On August 18, 2009, U Car Share started providing carsharing services with public pick up and drop off stops at several different TRAX stations as well as the University of Utah campus. Three secured bicycle lockers are also located on the facility, but must be rented from UTA in advance for an annual fee. Three ticket machines are located on the platform that provide single- ride, round trip, and all day passes, as well as family and discounted fare tickets. The ticket machines are cash-only and provide change in dollar coins and quarters only. TRAX ticket machines used to accept UTA fare tokens, which are still accepted on buses. On September 1, 2008 UTA discontinued the use of tokens at TRAX machines due to increased fraud.

In December 2013, the station also became the western terminus for the S Line (formerly known as Sugar House Streetcar). Description The TRAX portion of the station is located at 221 West 2100 South and the streetcar portion is located at 193 West Utopia Avenue. Both portions are accessible from eastbound 2100 South, a major east–west corridor that marks the boundary between South Salt Lake and Salt Lake City. The station has one island platform for TRAX and a separate side platform for the S Line streetcar. The S Line passenger side platform is located just southeast of the TRAX island platform and is situated east of both sets of TRAX tracks, but west of the single set of tracks for the S Line. It only accessible from the southern end of the TRAX platform. The station is the southernmost station that is served by all three TRAX lines. Central Pointe opened for service on December 4, 1999 as part of the Blue Line, built in preparation for the 2002 Winter Olympics. Streetcar service began on December 8, 2013. The station has a free Park and Ride lot with about 57 parking spaces available, however, commuters are prohibited from parking in the adjoining shopping center lot. Five covered bicycle lockers are also located at the station, which must be rented from UTA in advance for a fee. Two ticket machines are located on the platform that provide single-ride, round trip, and day passes, as well as family and discounted fare tickets. The vending machines are cash-only and provide change in dollar coins and quarters only. TRAX lines The Blue Line connects with the Salt Lake Intermodal Hub (Salt Lake Central) in Downtown Salt Lake City on the north (with connections to Amtrak inter-city rail and FrontRunner commuter rail) and downtown Draper (Draper Town Center) on the south. The Red Line connects with the University of Utah (University Medical Center) on the northeast and the Daybreak Community in South Jordan (Daybreak Parkway) on the southwest. Both the Blue and Red lines connect with FrontRunner on the south at Murray Central. The Green Line connects the Salt Lake City International Airport on the northwest with West Valley City (West Valley Central) on the southwest, via Downtown Salt Lake City, to the northeast. The Green Line also connects with FrontRunner on the north at North Temple Bridge/Guadalupe. Looking south toward the S Line passenger platform from the southern end of the TRAX platform This is the southernmost station to be serviced by all three TRAX lines, as the Green Line diverges immediately south of this station. Streetcar The S Line streetcar (UTA's first streetcar) began service at the station on December 8, 2013. It runs east from this station to connect with the business district of the Sugar House neighborhood of Salt Lake City. As of the end of 2013, the S Line extends as far as the Granite Block (at about 1100 East and 2200 South), but there are plans to extend it further, having it run north from the Granite Block along 1100 East to 1700 South (near Westminster College). The streetcar passenger platform is only accessible from the southern end of the TRAX platform. While similar to TRAX, the streetcar operates a much slower speed and more frequent stops. It also consists of only one car, rather than a \\"train\\" of cars.

History Minowa Castle was built in 1526 by Nagano Narimasa from the Nagano clan (themselves retainers of the Uesugi clan) based out of Nagano in Kozuke Province. In 1566 the castle's garrison, led by Nagano Narimori (lord of the castle since Narimasa, his father, had died in 1561)Nabeshima-Numata and Kamiizumi Nobutsuna, came under attack by forces of the Takeda clan under control of Takeda Shingen during the Siege of Minowa. During the siege, a sortie out of the castle was led by Nobutsuna, this, however, resulted in a successful assault by the Shingen forces. The entire castle fell, save a small portion still held by Nobutsuna. Shingen was so impressed by Nobutsuna that he let Nobutsuna leave unharmed, even asking Nobutsuna to join him (Nobutsuna declined). Shingen gave one of his generals, Naitō Masatoyo, control of the castle. After the siege, the castle was held by the Takeda clan, the Oda clan, and the Hojo clan. In 1590, Ii Naomasa of the Ii clan became lord. He held this post for only eight years until 1598, when he moved to Takasaki Castle. Minowa Castle was abandoned.日本吉 - Nippon-Kichi Today All that remains of Minowa Castle currently are the ruins of the stone walls, earthworks, and moats. The site is unusual, though, due to its large size, as it occupies forty-seven hectares (116 acres), making it one of the largest castle sites in Gunma Prefecture.

His chief opponent, Congressman Ricardo Alfonsín, was described by Sanz as \\"an appeal to nostalgia\\" (in reference to the latter's father, former President Raúl Alfonsín).Buenos Aires Herald: Sanz launches presidential bid Sanz withdrew shortly before the April 28 primary, however, and Alfonsín himself placed third in the 2011 general election. The UCR organized the Broad Front UNEN political coalition, but it stayed behind in the opinion polls for the 2015 elections. At the radical convention on March 14, 2015 in Gualeguaychú (Entre Ríos), Sanz and Cobos presented their proposals: Cobos proposed a front of center-left parties, while Ernesto Sanz proposed that the Radical Civic Union lead a broad coalition opposing Kirchnerism for the presidential elections of October 25, which includes the ARI Civic Coalition led by Elisa Carrió and the Republican Proposal (PRO) of Macri. Cobos, supported by Gerardo Morales and Deputy Ricardo Alfonsin, obtained 114 votes, while the position held by those who supported Sanz reached 186 votes. The UCR joined Macri's Republican Proposal to create the Cambiemos coalition. Macri, Sanz and Elisa Carrió ran for the coalition's primary election, which was won by Macri. Macri won the presidential elections afterwards. It was rumored that Sanz would be the minister of Justice in Macri's cabinet, but he retired from politics for personal reasons.

The FrontRunner portion of the station is part of the FrontRunner South extension. The Blue Line provides service from Downtown Salt Lake City south to Draper. The Red Line provides service from the University of Utah to the Daybreak Community of South Jordan. The station is situated immediately west of the Intermountain Medical Center complex. Description The TRAX portion of the station is located at 5144 Cottonwood Street and is accessed from either East Vine Street on the north or West 5300 South (SR-173/Spartan Street) at 100 West. The FrontRunner portion of the station is located at 140 East Vine Street. However, both TRAX and the FrontRunner platforms can be accessed from either parking lot. To the east of the station is the Intermountain Medical Center, with its large parking lot. Between the two free Park and Ride lots, there are nearly 1,100 parking spaces available. The adjacent Intermoutain Medical Center was built on the site of the former Murray Smelter. The Murray Downtown Historic District is across Little Cottonwood Creek to the northeast. The station is located within the Quiet Zone, so trains do not routinely sound their horns when approaching public crossings within this corridor. The TRAX portion of the station opened on December 4, 1999 and the FrontRunner portion opened, along with the rest of the FrontRunner South, on December 10, 2012. FrontRunner On weekdays the FrontRunner has about twenty-three round trips on weekdays between Ogden and Provo (through Salt Lake City) and about five more round trips between Ogden and Downtown Salt Lake City. On Saturdays there are only nineteen round trips between Odgen and Provo. Trains run hourly from about 4:30 am to just after midnight on weekdays (increasing to half-hour runs for the morning and evening commutes). Saturdays have hourly runs from about 6:00 am to 2:30 am the next morning. As of August 2013 the FrontRunner does not run on Sundays or holidays. Each weekday there is service to Pleasant View with two trains picking up passengers (no dropping off) in the morning and two more trains picking up and dropping off passengers in the evening for the commute.

Madagh is typically celebrated with community gatherings sponsored by churches, which include public offerings of food. Food offerings often include lamb stew with pilaf made from bulgur, and Armenian flat bread or katah bread. Historical origins Some religious scholars assert that madagh (or sometimes matal) has its roots in ancient liturgical sacrifice. The legitimation of the madagh sacrifice within the early Armenian Christian church is particularly associated with Gregory the Illuminator.Gilhus, Ingvild Saelid. 2006. Animals, Gods and Humans: Changing Attitudes to Animals in Greek, Roman and Early Christian Thought. Routledge. The madagh is still considered one of the most important religious blessings in the contemporary Armenian Church.Official Armenian Church website Contemporary church leaders assert that the ritual today is imbued with a new set of religious significance within the canon of Orthodox Christian practice.Armenian Church Research and Analysis Group . \\"Testing the Myth and Beyond.\\" Window Vol. II, No. 4 Contemporary interpretations link the madagh with the practice of Christian agape, or communal fellowship and love. It is also connected with the practice of religious charity, because the meal is often given to the community for free and is associated with feeding the poor.St. Hagop's Armenian Church Members of the Armenian diaspora typically associate the serving of the madagh with an annual commemoration of \\"martyr's day\\", the anniversary of the massacre of Armenian intellectuals throughout the Anatolian peninsula, which took place on April 24, 1915 (Armenian Genocide). Although, for many, it is an apt time for partaking in madagh, madagh celebrations take place throughout the summer months. The connection of the madagh to commemoration of the Armenian Genocide in Turkey may be a contentious point, as the genocide is not officially recognized within Turkey. This past uses the term \\"genocide\\" to accurately reproduce the understanding and interpretations of those populations that are enacting the ritual and is in keeping with most scholarly accounts. Moreover, despite its association with the genocide, the madagh may be used as part of other requiem services (Hokehankisd), including victims of other massacres or departed loved ones. Food and festivities Such events are popular in New York City as well as in the sizable Armenian descent population concentrated in Southeastern WisconsinPhyllis Sides. \\"Annual Armenian Picnic Shared Food, Fellowship.\\" Racine Journal Times June 25, 2007 and Northern Illinois. The events are often an opportunity to showcase traditional Armenian cuisine. At such feasts, particularly in the Midwestern USA, the madagh is typically celebrated with Lamb Stew and Bulgur Pilaf (Wheat pilaf) (click links for recipes). Older men from the community dig large pits in the earth the night before the feast, in which the communal pots of pilaf and lamb stew are roasted. On the day of the festival, which is free and open to the public, the presiding priest blesses the food and asks for God to remember the departed who are being commemorated as part of the Requiem Service. After the blessing, families line up with pots and bowls into which volunteers pass out the communal lamb stew and pilaf. Occasionally, one of the few remaining living survivors of the Armenian Genocide will be brought in to join the event. When such an honored guest is present, feast attendees typically gather around to hear a first-person account of the history as lived in 1915 through the eyes of a child. As of 2004, it was believed that there were only four remaining living survivors of the genocide in the United States. Annual madagh festivals are important cultural and community events apart from their historic connection to commemorating Armenian genocide. You may see young men playing soccer or throwing a football while the old men play backgammon in the shade. After the eating is finished, an Armenian band may play Armenian folk music for traditional dancing. Dancers line up next to each other, link pinkie fingers, and move their feet in pattern to the music as the line snakes around the pavilion. At most festival celebrations, guests attending the festival but unfamiliar with the history would be unlikely to note a connection to the genocide.

Overland's nearly 30-year career began in his home region of East Anglia, where he and his brother Chris formed the band Wildlife in 1980. The group were scouted by Adam Faith and soon signed to Chrysalis Records, who released the band's debut album, Burning, in 1980. The band moved labels to the Led Zeppelin owned Swan Song Records for their 1983 self-titled follow up album, which featured Simon Kirke on drums. The band were also managed for a short period by Peter Grant. The demise of Swan Song in 1983 meant that the Wildlife album was under-promoted, with an American release for the album being cancelled. Around this time, the band also recorded a song called \\"Shot in the Dark\\" that was never featured on an album. However, this tune later served as the prototype for Ozzy Osbourne's song of the same name.Hextall, Adrian (2015). \\"Interview with FM Vocalist, Steve Overland.\\" (March 14, 2015) @Myglobalmind Online Magazine. Retrieved 16 September 2016. Wildlife's version was never officially released, and the band split up soon after. Overland next formed the AOR band FM, with former Wildlife members Pete Jupp and Chris Overland. FM's first album, issued in 1986 on Portrait Records, was named Indiscreet. The band's next album, Tough It Out, was released in 1989 with serious financial backing from Epic Records, which was Portrait's parent company. For this album, the band brought in songwriter Desmond Child, known for his work on Bon Jovi's album, Slippery When Wet. This 1986 to 1989 period saw the band at their commercial peak, scoring minor UK Chart hits with \\"Frozen Heart\\", \\"Bad Luck\\", and the non-album release, \\"Let Love Be The Leader\\". The band toured as headline artists, as well as undertaking support slots with Bon Jovi, Tina Turner and Meat Loaf. The band was then dropped by Epic Records and signed to Music for Nations for their third album, Takin' It to the Streets. The album displayed a shift towards a more straightforward rock approach and also included a cover of \\"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\\", which was released as a single. This was the first album to feature ex-Visage and ASAP guitarist Andy Barnett, Chris Overland having left the band after the Tough It Out tour. FM's fourth album, Aphrodisiac, followed in 1992 and is often considered to be the band's best. The band then signed to the Raw Power label to record Dead Man's Shoes, which featured new keyboard player, Jem Davis. In March 1996, Steve Overland and Pete Jupp decided to disband FM, forming the band So! with Wishbone Ash bass player, Bob Skeat, soon after. So!'s debut album, Brass Monkey, had two very limited releases, with copies of either release being difficult to come by. Overland has recorded prolifically throughout the 2000s (decade), with the bands The Ladder, Shadowman, and latterly, with his solo albums, Break Away and Diamond Dealer. In 2007, FM reformed for a one-off gig at Nottingham's Rock City, headlining Firefest IV. This 'one-off' reunion led to a more permanent incarnation with Jim Kirkpatrick replacing Andy Barnett on lead guitar. Overland and Kirkpatrick had been a songwriting team independently of the band prior to Jim joining FM. FM have since toured extensively in the UK and throughout Europe, both as headliners and also touring with Thin Lizzy, Journey, Foreigner and Europe. Five more albums have been released Metropolis (2010), Rockville (2013), Rockville II (2013), Heroes and Villains (2015) and Atomic Generation (2018). Overland has also appeared in the Broadway show Dreamtime, which had a successful run at the Ed Sullivan Theater.

Those that do generally reject Muhammad's proclamation of receiving divine revelations from God and label him instead as a false prophet. References to Muhammad In the Middle Ages, it was common for Jewish writers to describe Muhammad as ha-meshuggah (\\"the madman\\"), a term of contempt frequently used in the Bible for those who believe themselves to be prophets.Defending the West: A Critique of Edward Said's Orientalism By Ibn Warraq Page 255The Legacy of Islamic Antisemitism: From Sacred Texts to Solemn History page 21 Maimonides Maimonides referred to Muhammad as a false prophet and an insane man. In his Epistle to Yemen he wrote \\"After [Jesus] arose the Madman who emulated his precursor [Jesus], since he paved the way for him. But he added the further objective of procuring rule and submission [talb al-mulk; pursuit of sovereignty] and he invented what was well known [Islam].\\"Norman Roth. Jews, Visigoths, and Muslims in Medieval Spain: Cooperation and Conflict, BRILL, 1994, p. 218. In his authoritative work of law the Mishneh Torah (Hilkhot Melakhim 11:10–12), Maimonides indicated that nevertheless Muhammad was part of God's plan of preparing the world for the coming of the Jewish Messiah: \\"All those words of Jesus of Nazareth and of this Ishmaelite [i.e., Muhammad] who arose after him are only to make straight the path for the messianic king and to prepare the whole world to serve the Lord together. As it is said: 'For then I will change the speech of the peoples to a pure speech so that all of them shall call on the name of the Lord and serve him with one accord' (Zephaniah 3:9).\\"A.

Natan'el al-Fayyumi Natan'el al-Fayyumi, a prominent 12th-century Yemenite rabbi and theologian, and the founder of what is sometimes called \\"Jewish Ismailism\\", wrote in his philosophical treatise Bustan al-Uqul (\\"Garden of Wisdom\\") that God sends prophets to establish religions for other nations, which do not have to conform to the precepts of the Jewish Torah. Nethanel explicitly considered Muhammad a true prophet, who was sent from Heaven with a particular message that applies to the Arabs, but not to the Jews.The Bustan al-Ukul, by Nathanael ibn al-Fayyumi, edited and translated by David Levine, Columbia University Oriental Studies Vol. VI, p. 105Gan ha-Sekhalim, ed. Kafih (Jerusalem, 1984), ch. 6. Al-Fayyumi's explicit acceptance of Muhammad's prophecy was rare and virtually unknown until recent times beyond his native Yemen.Abraham's children: Jews, Christians, and Muslims in conversation, by Norman Solomon, Richard Harries, Tim Winter, T&T; Clark Int'l, 2006, , p. 137 Netanel's work was virtually unknown beyond his native Yemen until modern times, so had little influence on later Jewish thought. Midrash The apocalyptic Midrash Secrets (Nistarot) of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, compares Muhammad to the Jewish Messiah. According to this text, ascribed to the famous 1st-century sage and mystic Simeon bar Yochai, and apparently written at the beginning of the Muslim conquest or in the 8th century,The History of Jerusalem: The Early Muslim Period, by Joshua Prawer and Haggai Ben-Shammai, NYU Press, 1996, , p. 304 Muhammad's role as a prophet includes redeeming the Jews from the Christian (\\"Roman\\" or \\"Edomite\\") oppression and playing a positive role in the messianic process.Abraham's children: Jews, Christians, and Muslims in conversation, by Norman Solomon, Richard Harries, Tim Winter, T&T; Clark Int'l, 2006, , p. 133 \\"Nistarot\\" places the Muslim conquests in an eschatological context, and implies that Muhammad had a positive role to play in the messianic process. Obscure and indirect references One Yemenite Jewish document, found in the Cairo Genizah, suggests that many Jews had not only accepted Muhammad as a prophet, but had even desecrated Sabbath in order to join Muhammad in his struggle. However, some historians suggest that this document, called Dhimmat an-nabi Muhammad (Muhammad's Writ of Protection), has been fabricated by Yemenite Jews for the purpose of self-defence.Yakov Rabkin \\"Perspectives on the Muslim Other in Jewish Tradition\\" (126 KB) A number of stories from the Islamic tradition about Muhammad entered mainstream Jewish thought incidentally, due to the great cultural convergence in Islamic Spain from the 9th to 12th centuries, known as the Golden Age of Spanish Jewry. For example, Rabbi Jacob Joseph of Polonne, one of the early Hasidic mystics, wrote that one pious man (hasid) taught that the internal struggle against the evil inclination is greater than external battle, quoting Bahya ibn Paquda's popular treatise Chovot HaLevavot. In the Judeo-Arabic original version of that book, Bahya Ibn Paquda refers to both external and internal battle as jihad and the \\"pious man\\" about whom the story is originally told is Muhammad, though the author does not mention his source by name.A Sufi-Jewish Dialogue: Philosophy and Mysticism in Bahya ibn Paquda's Duties of the Heart, by Diana Lobel, University of Pennsylvania Press, , p. ix \\"How does a perennially popular manual of Jewish piety come to be quoting Islamic traditions about the Prophet Muhammad?

Early life and education Payne was born in St George, Basseterre on the island of St Kitts in 1739 to Ralph Payne (died 1763)—the Chief Justice of St Kitts—and his wife, Alice.http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/21652 His family was wealthy and originally came from Lavington in Wiltshire, hence Payne's future peerage was as Baron Lavington. He was educated in England at Christ's Hospital school in West Sussex. Following the completion of his time at Christ's, Payne returned to St Kitts where he was \\"elected a member of the house of assembly and unanimously voted speaker.\\" NOTE: The biographical sketch for Sir Ralph Payne (later Lord Lavington) in \\"The History of Parliament,\\" states that \\"On 1 Oct. 1795 Payne duly became Baron Lavington (after the Wiltshire home of his ancestors), though he had at first chosen the title of Bampton.\\" This has posed a double-problem for family researchers as traditions within the family maintain that they descend from the PAYN's of Jersey, Channel Islands, from which island they had fled at the end of the Civil War. It is said that Sir Ralph's ancestors fled the island and settled for a time in Devonshire (although no evidence for this has been located). Circa 1653, the family is believed to have left England for the St. Kitts and the Leeward Islands. It is therefore a bit of a mystery as to how \\"Bampton\\" fits into the picture, particularly when there appears to be very strong record evidence in support of the family tradition in regard to Jersey. The present head of this family (in Scotland), who is in possession of many family heirlooms, paintings, etc., as well as several secondary sources (J.B. Payn's \\"An Armorial of Jersey; Burkes \\"General Armory\\"), trace Lord Lavington's ancestry to Edouard PAYN (1554-19 Aug 1624) of St. Martin, Jersey, by his wife, Andrie (died 21 Jan 1620/1). Other researchers claim that records extant on the island further trace this ancestry back to the 13th-century. Perhaps other researchers can provide information on Lavington's \\"Wiltshire\\" and/or \\"Bampton\\" connection. Return to England and marriage By 1762, Payne had returned to England as part of his grand tour of Europe as was convention for young men in the eighteenth century. Here he became a representative for absentee landowners in Britain of plantations in the West Indies. He married at London in 1767. First tenure as Governor of the Leeward Islands Following his marriage, Payne embarked fully on his political career and became a member of parliament for the borough of Shaftesbury; holding this seat from 1768 to 1771. To further himself in politics, he always voted according to the government of the time. He thus made many more useful connections which were particularly beneficial to him, including his relationship with the Earl of Mansfield. Horace Walpole observed the verbose style with which Payne made his political speeches, maintaining that such a style could be attributed to amateur dramatic performances in Payne's youth. Nevertheless, Payne became a prominent figure in London society and held a great number of social gatherings which were very popular in the capital. Payne was created a Knight of the Bath (KB) on 18 February 1771 and was also appointed Captain-General and Governor-in- Chief of the Leeward Islands later in 1771. Payne had \\"inherited a considerable estate from his parents\\" on the islands. The islands endured a hurricane in 1772, leading Payne to become the first governor to tour the islands to work out how to resolve the devastation that was caused. It was during his time as governor that he became the patron of artist Thomas Hearne who painted several landscapes depicting events on the Leeward Islands. One of these—depicting Payne himself—is currently in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Sir Ralph left the post as governor in 1775, although he had been very popular during his tenure. Indeed, he was so popular the people petitioned to have him remain as governor for another term. Return to England Sir Ralph returned to England to become MP for Camelford in Cornwall between 1776 and 1780. He then became MP for Plympton in Devon; holding this seat until 1784. He was also Clerk of the Board of Green Cloth between 1777 and 1782. He became a supporter of Fox following the end of the war in America, although his political career was restricted for a period due to the increasing influence of William Pitt who became prime minister in 1783. He left England in 1788 for another tour of Europe, returning to England in 1790 to contest the seat of Fowey in Cornwall but he was unsuccessful. Finding it difficult to re-establish himself in the British political system with a sharply reduced income from his plantations on the Leeward Islands,He owned Carlisle's Estate in St George, Antigua, with over 300 slaves but he died almost destitute and the estate was bought by Reid and Dixon. Payne was involved in no claim for compensation at the time of abolition of slavery.https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/person/view/2146631769 He switched allegiances to become a supporter of Pitt, throwing a party at his house on 15 August 1793 at which the prime minister, Pitt, was present. It was due to this switch of allegiance that he became Baron Lavington in the peerage of Ireland on 1 October 1795. Payne was also elected as MP for New Woodstock in October 1795, retaining this seat until 1799. He did not vote on the abolition of the slave trade during this his fourth tenure as an MP. Second tenure as Governor of the Leeward Islands Lord Lavington was re-elected as Governor of the Leeward Islands in February 1799, arriving in Antigua on 12 August 1801. He was also sworn of the Privy Council later in 1799. Payne remained governor until his death in 1807. He owned Carlisle's Estate in St George, Antigua, with over 300 slaves but he died almost destitute and the estate was bought by Reid and Dixon. Payne was involved in no claim for compensation at the time of abolition of slavery. Family On 1 September 1767 at St George's in Hanover Square, London, he married Frances Lambertine Christiana Charlotte Harriet Theresa de Kolbel, the daughter of a German nobleman, without issue. He owned Carlisle's Estate in St George, Antigua, with over 300 slaves but he died almost destitute and the estate was bought by Reid and Dixon. Payne was involved in no claim for compensation at the time of abolition of slavery. His wife was well connected and mixed in high social circles, including with Queen Charlotte, wife of King George III. Payne therefore made good contacts for his political career through his marriage; however, his time with Frances was not a particularly happy one. He owned Carlisle's Estate in St George, Antigua, with over 300 slaves but he died almost destitute and the estate was bought by Reid and Dixon. Payne was involved in no claim for compensation at the time of abolition of slavery. He died at Government House, Leeward Islands, on 3 August 1807. He was buried the next day at his plantation, Carlisles, and a marble monument to him was erected in the parish church of St John's in Antigua. He died without children and in a dire economic situation, leaving his wife, Lady Lavington, to sustain herself on an annual income of just £300; an extremely low amount for the widow of a nobleman and relatively influential politician, although it would have allowed her to keep a servant. Lady Lavington died at Hampton Court Palace in London, UK on 2 May 1830. According to biographer W.P.

It is l0 km outside Pisa, Tuscany, Italy. The monastery is noted for the fresco of the Last Supper, by Bernardino Poccetti (1597). Charterhouse The Carthusians founded a monastery in 1366/67 in what is called Val Graziosa, a plain overlooked by the Monti Pisani when Francesco Moricotti Prignani was archbishop of Pisa. Shortly afterwards Pope Gregory XI, a noted reformer of monasteries, expelled the monks from the Benedictine Gorgona Abbey, on the island of Gorgona, and gave the island and the estate to the Carthusians of Val Graziosa, who repopulated them. This event must have happened not long before Catherine of Siena's visit of 1375, as she mentions in her letters the need to convert the facilities for the Carthusian use.Carthusians needed individual hermitages, whereas Benedictines lived a more communal life Benedictines were barred from the island. In 1425, the Mediterranean reached a peak of political instability. The peace and safety of the monks on Gorgona could no longer be assured. Fearing a Saracen attack they abandoned the monastery and took up residence at Calci, bringing the records from Gorgona with them, to be duly published at Pisa. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the complex was renovated, receiving its current Baroque appearance. After WW2 members of convents from the Netherlands started to repopulate the building that had been heavily damaged during the war years. It was thought that a Dutch Carthusian monastery in Italy could one day lead to the re-establishment of a Carthusian monastery in the Netherlands However, a lack of funds, lack of novices and internal strife caused the Dutch to abandon their project in the 1960's. Museum In 1981, the University of Pisa moved its natural history museum here.

POD concerts intend to dispute the basis on which the tariffs are calculated and how they are distributed. On Friday 13 June, IMRO issued a statement confirming that it had issued proceedings against POD Concerts Ltd. The proceedings were \\"in relation to a dispute in respect of the Electric Picnic music element\\". \\"IMRO will be in court on Monday 16 June 2008 seeking entry into the Commercial List,\\" the statement added, before clarifying the background to the organisation's decision to go to court. \\"It is IMRO's policy to rigorously pursue all outstanding royalties due to the songwriters, composers and music publishers that it represents from the commercial exploitation of their music.\\" Following the 17 June hearing, in which lawyers on behalf of IMRO made their opening statement, POD Concerts responded to media coverage of the dispute, setting out their version of events in robust terms – and directly answering what POD dismisses as totally misleading statements about Electric Picnic.

The film's runtime is about three hours and is considered to be lost with only reel 5 preserved at the Library of Congress. Plot The film opens to a ceremony occurring in Santa Barbara, California. Ramona Gonzaga (the title character's mother), a Native American woman, and Angus Phail (Richard Sterling), a white man, are getting married. Soon after their marriage, a half-Indian, half-White girl named Ramona (Mabel Van Buren) is born. Meanwhile, in another part of America, the film depicts land-hungry white settlers driving off Native Americans from their lands to occupy them. The film cuts to Ramona (Ann Dvorak) growing up as a child, dearly loved by her mother. In this phase of Ramona's life, her mother passes away and gives Ramona to the care of Senora Moreno (Lurline Lyons) before her death. Ramona grows up in Senora Moreno's household with Felipe, Senora Moreno's son. As Ramona (Adda Gleason) becomes a young woman, she becomes very beautiful with hair like her mother's, and eyes like her father's. She begins a relationship with Felipe (Nigel De Brulier). One day, Ramona sees a young Indian man named Alessandro (Monroe Salisbury), son of an Indian chief, playing the violin and meets him. They immediately fall in love with each other, but are discovered by Senora Moreno, who forbids them from seeing each other and locks Ramona in her room. Alessandro goes back to his village, to find it burned down by white settlers. Despite his loss, he isn't too hurt by it due to his newfound love for Ramona. He goes back to Ramona's village and leaves with her. They get married in secret by Father Salvierderra (Martin Best) and move to the little settlement of San Pasqual, where they are able to live in peace for a while. The film shows the white settlers moving closer and closer to San Pasqual, threatening the peace and quiet of Ramona's life. With this danger imminent, Ramona moves into the mountains with her family, which now consists of Alessandro, their young child, and a dog. While venturing in the mountains, Ramona and her family face many hardships, including a blizzard. However, they finally find a shelter. Driven mad by the hardships his family has had to endure due to encroaching white settlers, Alessandro confronts a white man on horseback and is killed. Ramona is now alone with her child and her dog. Meanwhile, Felipe leaves his home to search for Ramona. After getting help along the way, Felipe finally finds Ramona and her family and brings them his home. Soon after, Ramona and Felipe get married and have several children, with the oldest of them named Ramona.

The film stars Ice Cube and Keke Palmer, their second film together after Barbershop 2: Back in Business, and was released on August 22, 2008. Plot Minden, Illinois, is a former factory town with no money and a pathetic football team. Curtis Plummer, a down-and-out former football player is going nowhere, until he meets his niece Jasmine, the daughter of his no-good brother. Jasmine has worn her father's watch ever since he left five years ago, in the hopes that he will return. Her mother Claire asks Curtis to take care of Jasmine after school, because Claire has to work at the town diner. Curtis realizes Jasmine has a talent for throwing a football, which he nurtures into a passion for the game. He then persuades her to try out for the town's Pop Warner football team, the Minden Browns, because he thinks it would be good for her and the team. The team, including the coach, are against it, but her abilities gain her a spot on the team. However, the coach keeps her on the bench. In the fourth game, after much prodding from Curtis, the coach puts Jasmine in the game, and although they lose, everyone said they could have won if she had played from the beginning. Jasmine becomes the starting quarterback and the Minden Browns become a winning team. Everything is going great, until Coach Fisher has a heart attack, and the assistant coach asks Curtis to help coach the team through the last two games. He hesitates at first, but is eventually talked into it. They win the two games and are able to go to the Pop Warner Super Bowl in Miami Beach. Jasmine's father, Roy, suddenly shows up after he sees her on TV. Claire and Curtis are both unhappy about his returning, but Jasmine is ecstatic. The Browns are able to go to the Super Bowl after raising the money for the trip, including Curtis' donation of his life savings. Jasmine plays poorly in the first half when her father does not show up. Curtis talks her through her feelings for her father and Minden rallies for the second half. They lose the game after a teammate drops the ball on the last play. They are glad that they did their best. After they get back, Jasmine gives Roy back his watch, cutting him out of her life. She then accepts her Uncle Curtis as a father figure.

Box for Carillon Films. Plot After a successful career in the British Secret Service dating back to the Second World War, ex- Major David Somers (Trevor Howard) is dismissed after making a mistake on his last mission. The only work he can find is cataloging butterflies at the country house of Nicholas and Jess Fenton. (The \\"clouded yellow\\" of the title is a rare species of butterfly.) Somers and Sophie Malraux (Jean Simmons), Jess's niece, become attracted to each other. After the murder of Hick, a local gamekeeper and Jess's lover, suspicion wrongly falls on Sophie. She is considered mentally fragile because of the murder-suicide of her parents when she was six, the memory of which she has suppressed. Somers helps Sophie to evade arrest, and they go on the run together. Somers using his secret-service skills and contacts to stay one step ahead of the police and Willy Shepley, a Secret Service agent. After a cross-country chase, they arrive at Liverpool with the intention of leaving the country by ship. The true identity of the murderer of Hick is revealed to be Sophie's uncle Nicholas, who also killed Sophie's parents, as her father was also one of Jess's lovers.

They found they had a rapport, so when Shepherd's Bush Studio shut down, and Thomas left Sydney Box to go under contract to the Rank Organisation, Betty Box came with him. Their first film together was The Clouded Yellow. It was made for Betty Box's company, Carillon Films. The Clouded Yellow was based on an original script by Janet Green. It was developed by Sydney Box but he had decided to take a year long absence and gave the project to Box and Thomas.Andrew Spicer, Sydney Box, p 138 Green was paid £1,000.Women Screenwriters: An International Guide edited by Jill Nelmes, Jule Selbo p 633 They wanted further work done on the script but Janet Green was unavailable and Eric Ambler was hired to do work on it. Jean Simmons, who had made So Long at the Fair with Box, agreed to play the lead. Trevor Howard was borrowed from Herbert Wilcox, who had him under contract, to play the male lead. Production coincided with a crisis in the British film industry – Betty Box says it was the only film being made in England in the first half of 1950.Box p 54 She managed to secure a distribution contract with Rank, which enabled her to borrow enough money to finance 70% of the budget. Box managed to raise the rest from Rank and the National Film Finance Corporation, each putting up fifty percent.Box p 55 However, after Betty Box had signed all 48 of the contracts required by the bank, James Laurie of the NFFC decided he did not like the contract and withdrew his company's finance until changes were made. Rank refused to provide Box with finance to tide her over, so the producer borrowed the money against her own home. \\"I obviously wasn't happy about the situation, particularly as it was through no fault of my own\\", Box later wrote. Finance did not come through until five weeks into the film. \\"It was a brave thing for her to do and she didn't tell me until the picture was finished\\", said Thomas. Shooting Shooting took place in Newcastle, Liverpool and the Lake District. A significant proportion of the action was shot on location in Newcastle upon Tyne, featuring scenes on the quayside, around the Castle Keep and the Central Station, and the suburb of Jesmond. Some scenes were filmed in Liverpool's Chinatown, Toxteth, Liverpool Docks and on the Liverpool Overhead Railway, closed in 1956 and later dismantled. Thomas said he enjoyed making the movie.Collected Interviews: Voices from Twentieth- century Cinema by Wheeler W. Dixon, SIU Press, 2001 p109 Maxwell Reed said his role was \\"not a big part but it's the best I've ever had.\\" The supporting cast features a young Kenneth More. Reception The movie benefited from publicity arising out of Jean Simmons' engagement and marriage to Stewart Granger. It was also helped by the fact Trevor Howard and Simmons were among the most popular stars at the British box office. Box later wrote \\"the film finally opened to very good press notices and even better business, and the teething problems were forgotten as the tills started ringing sweet music. I found I'd done a better deal for myself than I realised – every time I'd had to put up another unit of finance I was due for an extra percentage of profit – and I felt that at last justice was being done. The profits were useful for keeping my head above water as Ralph and I prepared our next production and I looked out for good film stories to buy.\\"Box p 56 \\"I'm rather proud of that film\\", said Thomas. \\"Jean Simmons was lovely in it, so was Trevor Howard; it was a very good movie. And Sonia Dresdel was very good value for money; they don't make them like her any more – wonderful bravura.\\"Brian McFarlane, An Autobiography of British Cinema 1997 p 557 The Observer called it \\"a very foolish picture\\". However, The New York Times was one of the film's many admirers, saying that \\"A first-rate job of fast film-making in a crisp, naturalistic style, up and down the actual face of England, has been accomplished by all hands.\\" Thomas and Box would make a number of other thrillers in their career, including Venetian Bird.

It is located in the ward of Churston-with-Galmpton and the historic civil parish of Churston Ferrers, though some areas historically considered parts of Galmpton, such as Greenway and Galmpton Creek, are situated in the Devon borough of South Hams. Galmpton is bordered to the south and west by a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) in the Kingswear parish. Galmpton Warborough common is immediately to the north, and beyond that the town of Paignton. To the north-east are the areas of Broadsands and Elberry Cove on the coast of the English Channel; and to the west and south-west the village of Churston Ferrers and the fishing town of Brixham. Churston-with- Galmpton has a resident population of about 6,657, which is set to increase by 3.5% by 2023. Galmpton village itself is home to just over 1,400 people. It has an older population: the average age in the village is 52, twelve years above the UK average. Life expectancy, and the age at which residents remain free of disabilities, are significantly higher than elsewhere, though the proportion of people with long-term medical conditions is high. The ward constitutes the least deprived area of Torbay with an unemployment rate of 1.2%. History The ancient manor of Galmpton was first recorded in the Domesday Book as ‘Galmetona’, the name deriving from the Saxon ‘Gafolsman’, meaning a community of rent-paying peasants. After the Norman Conquest, Ralph de Feugeres became Lord of the Manor of Galmpton; it remained a manorial holding well into the Victorian era. Galmpton had an economy driven largely from agriculture until industry arrived in the 1800s, chiefly quarrying of Devonian limestone. Richard Harvey, a Cornish copper magnate, acquired the manor in the 1860s, residing locally at Greenway House. Harvey was noted as making great improvements to the Tudor housing of Galmpton's inhabitants, which he had called “miserable hovels”, and for making a generous donation towards the restoration of Churston's medieval church, St Mary's. The Dartmouth and Torbay Railway from Paignton station to Churston (a half mile from Galmpton) was opened for passengers in 1861, assisting the expansion of the village and its industry. The line, designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, once ran to Brixham and two of his viaducts still stand at Broadsands. In the 20th century, Greenway became the home of the author Agatha Christie, who paid for a new stained glass window in St. Mary's Church depicting the Christmas story and life on the estate. Nearby Lupton House was recorded in the 1086 Domesday Survey as being woodland; the house can be traced to 1408. In 1480 the Upton (in French: L’Upton) family settled there. The present house was built in 1772 and purchased in 1788 by Mr Justice Francis Yarde Buller − the first judge to sentence a criminal to deportation to Australia. Large numbers of troops were stationed around Galmpton during World War Two. Small boats from the Dart joined in the Dunkirk evacuation of 1940 and the river provided anchorage for many of the landing craft used in the D-Day invasion. Motor launches and motor torpedo boats used in the war effort were built and repaired at Galmpton Creek. The main road from Newton Abbot to Dartmouth once ran through the village before being bypassed to the north by the Brixham Road (A379). Galmpton grew fivefold in the 1960s when low density estates consisting largely of bungalows were constructed, replacing fruit orchards. Industry largely abandoned the village in the 20th century and its economy returned to being led mainly by farming and related businesses. Areas closely associated with Galmpton are: * Galmpton Warborough, set up in Saxon times as a defensive position to bring together the fighting men of Galmpton and Churston. Later, in 1588, Sir John Gilbert of Greenway led 3,000 militia to Galmpton Warborough in readiness to repel invaders arriving with the Spanish Armada. * Galmpton Creek, a tributary of the River Dart, now in the South Hams borough of Devon. Brixham fishing smacks and other small trading vessels were constructed here from Victorian times. Marine related businesses are still based there. * Broadsands and Elberry Cove: beaches surrounded by recent residential developments, now separated from Galmpton by the A379 road. Environment Galmpton village is sited within the catchment area of the River Dart, 25 metres above high water. The area includes “agricultural areas of significant landscape value” and farmland covers some 60% of Galmpton. Most fields are used for the grazing of livestock. A characteristic South Devon lane in Galmpton. Distinctive features of the older village lanes are the limestone walls constructed of locally quarried stone, often bedecked in summer with Valerian, wall daisies, ivy-leafed toadflax and wall pennywort; and locally characteristic grassed, stone-built ‘Devon banks’. Wildlife is attracted to local woods and the remnants of orchards. Fauna includes the endangered cirl bunting, buzzards, kestrels, peregrine falcons, ravens and woodpeckers. On Galmpton Creek there are herons, cormorants and wading birds such as sandpipers and whimbrels. To the west of the village, hills retain continuous ‘green skylines' and riverine landscape protected from development by their AONB status. Galmpton Warborough, a rare example of lowland calcareous grassland, provides views over Tor Bay and the Dart Valley to Dartmoor, and is protected by Torbay Council as an Urban Landscape Protection Area. It is regularly frequented by some two-thirds of Galmpton residents for recreation, and serves as a ‘green wedge’ separating Galmpton and Churston from the urban sprawl of Paignton. The River Dart at Galmpton Greek The River Dart and its watercourses, including the Galmpton watercourse, are prone to flooding during heavy rainfall and in 1999 a man died in flooding in the village. Following this incident the Environment Agency approved a £500,000 flood defence scheme which all but eliminated the threat of heavy damage to the village. The Broadsands area is somewhat prone to coastal flooding. Culture, tourism and amenities Galmpton has a village shop, comprising a post office and general store, a butcher's and hairdressing salon. Community facilities include the Galmpton Institution village hall and the Galmpton Barn Chapel Hall, which support a variety of leisure, social and cultural activities; Congregational and Anglican chapels, two pubs and a GP surgery. Greenway estate, a Grade II* listed house and garden acquired by the National Trust in 1999, is nearby. It is significant as the former home of author Agatha Christie. Visitors to Lupton House are attracted to its parkland, Italianate garden and history. The Paignton and Dartmouth Steam Railway has stations at Churston, less than a mile from Galmpton, and Greenway Halt. Other local attractions include Churston Golf Club, a large pitch and putt green and a go kart circuit. Sports facilities are available at the Memorial Field, and are used by Galmpton & Roselands Football Club. On this site are a children's playground and skatepark. Remains of a 19th-century windmill on Galmpton Warborough. Annual events include the charitable Gooseberry Pie Fair and events run by the local history and floral societies. The 'September Skills Day' concludes with a concert of seasonal readings and music. Schools *Churston Ferrers Grammar School *Galmpton C of E Primary School A playgroup and pre-school are run from the village hall. Famous residents Football commentator Kenneth Wolstenholme, famed for his phase \\".. they think it's all over - it is now\\" after Geoff Hurst scored England's fourth goal in the 1966 England v West Germany World Cup final, lived in Galmpton until his death in 2002, aged 81.

Lowry was born in Cincinnati, Ohio. He was a literary wunderkind who began writing at the age of eight; within a year, he had stories published in the Cincinnati Times Star newspaper. He graduated from Withrow High School in 1937, after which he entered the University of Cincinnati. He was, according to biographer James Reidel, a voracious reader of the literary works of Ernest Hemingway, William Faulkner, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Guy de Maupassant. The Little Man Press In 1938, while enrolled at the University of Cincinnati, Lowry served as editor for a university-sponsored chapbook entitled The Little Man (whose credits claim it \\"was established in the Fall of 1937 by some students,\\" although the contents were copyrighted under Lowry's name). William Saroyan contributed the lead essay, \\"A Word on Reading and Writing.\\" That same year, with illustrator James Flora, a student at the Art Academy of Cincinnati, Lowry founded The Little Man Press. The partners published dozens of chapbooks under the Little Man imprint from 1939 to 1942. Lowry authored many titles (some under such pseudonyms as James Caldwell), but the Little Man imprint also published essays and fiction by Saroyan, Thomas Mann, Jesse Stuart, Charles Henri Ford, William Edward March Campbell, and others. After Flora accepted a job offer from Columbia Records in 1942 and moved to Connecticut, Lowry continued to sporadically publish titles under a succession of revived Little Man imprints. Writing career In 1942 Lowry was drafted, and served three years in the US military during World War II, during which he saw combat in North Africa and Italy. After his discharge, he divorced his first wife, wrote critically acclaimed fiction (his fans included Ernest Hemingway), and penned an autobiographical novel (The Big Cage). Lowry was hired by James Laughlin as office manager at New Directions Publishing in September 1945. Leaving in Fall 1946 to concentrate on writing full-time, Lowry came under the influence of the editor George Davis and, for a time, flourished as a rising new voice in American fiction. His books and short stories in the late 1940s and 1950s recounted his wartime experiences. He also wrote colorfully about life in New York's Greenwich Village during the emergence of the beatnik scene. His published works included Casualty (1946), Find Me in Fire (1948; cover teaser: \\"She Was Young But Ripe For Love\\"), and The Violent Wedding (1953). His short stories appeared in Mademoiselle, New Directions, Collier's, Horizon, The American Mercury, and other periodicals. His short fiction was collected in three volumes, The Wolf That Fed Us (Doubleday, 1949), Happy New Year, Kamerades! (Doubleday, 1954), and Party of Dreamers (Fleet Publishing Corp., 1962). During the 1950s Lowry penned book reviews for Time magazine and the Saturday Review of Literature. In 1950, he won the O. Henry Award for his short story \\"Be Nice to Mr. Campbell.\\"Obituary, The New York Times, December 23, 1994 Another Lowry story, \\"Layover in El Paso,\\" was adapted for a 1959 feature film entitled That Kind of Woman, directed by Sidney Lumet and starring Sophia Loren. Lowry also wrote screenplays for such dramatic TV series as Schlitz Playhouse, G.E. True Theater, Starlight Theater, and Actor's Studio. Lowry had two short stories published in Mademoiselle magazine that were illustrated by his former Little Man Press partner, James Flora: \\"Little Baseball World\\" (September 1946) and \\"The Mammoth Molar\\" (September 1951). Visuals Arts/Design Lowry was also a visual artist. He illustrated the covers of some of his independently published works, and the title page of each story in Happy New Year, Kamerades, was adorned with a minimalist brush-and-ink illustration by the author. While employed at New Directions, Lowry designed book jackets for titles by Tennessee Williams, James T. Farrell, Christopher Isherwood, Thomas Merton, Dylan Thomas, Pablo Neruda, Henry Miller, and others. According to Lowry researcher Robert Nedelkoff, \\"James Laughlin said he'd always loved the Little Man books and said he thought that Lowry may have had greater promise as a book designer than as a writer. He thought Lowry had peaked with Casualty and the other books were downhill.\\" Psychological Profile Lowry had dark impulses, which were exacerbated by liquor. \\"In Cincinnati,\\" recalled Flora, \\"he would take one drink and go berserk, throwing himself on the floor, saying, 'I'm a rug! I'm a rug! Step on me!'\\"Chusid, Irwin, \\"Robert Lowry, James Flora, and the Little Man Press,\\" at JimFlora.com In 1952, following a second marriage and the birth of a son, Beirne, Lowry was diagnosed a schizophrenic and forced to undergo electric shock therapy. He spent the rest of his life passing in and out of \\"insane asylums\\" (his preferred term), squalid hotels, and turbulent relationships with women (including two more marriages). In the 1960s, he fostered an association with George Lincoln Rockwell, founder of the American Nazi Party, which alienated many of his friends and supporters.Robert Lowry at the Free Library He continued writing, but because of his volatile and unpredictable personality, reputable publishers declined to publish his manuscripts. During the final decades of his life, Lowry, often destitute, self-published many additional works. He died in Cincinnati, age 75, at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Cincinnati. At the time of his death, all his commercially published books were out of print. Original Works by Lowry online *Text of The Knife, Lowry's self-published 1959 novella, with intro by Jim Reidel.

This was the first United Artists film with a synchronized score and sound effect, but no dialogue, and so was not a talking picture. The novel had been previously filmed by D. W. Griffith in 1910 with Mary Pickford, remade in 1916 with Adda Gleason, and again in 1936 with Loretta Young. Cast * Dolores del Río as Ramona * Warner Baxter as Alessandro * Roland Drew as Felipe * Vera Lewis as Señora Moreno * Michael Visaroff as Juan Canito * John T. Prince as Father Salvierderra * Mathilde Comont as Marda * Carlos Amor as Sheepherder * Jess Cavin as Bandit Leader * Rita Carewe as Baby *Jean the Dog as Dog *Shep Houghton as the Mexican Boy *Nadine Riga as the Girl *Saint-Granier as the French singer *Dorothy Teters as the Indian Plot The film depicts Ramona, who is half Native American, as she is raised by a Mexican family. Ramona suffers racism and prejudice in her community, and when she finds out that she is half Native, she chooses to identify as a Native American instead of a Mexican American so that she can marry Alessandro, who is a Native as well. This romantic tragedy relays the tragic death of Ramona and Alessandro’s child at the hands of a Caucasian doctor, who refuses to help their child because of his skin color. Shortly after, the couple moves away, and Alessandro is killed by a white man for robbing him of his horse; Ramona eventually reunites with her childhood friend Felipe and starts a new life as a depressed woman. She is only able to recover from her depression and remember her feelings for Felipe when he sings a song from their childhood to restore her memory. Production Parts of the film were shot in Zion National Park, Springdale, and Cedar Breaks National Monument, all in Utah. Reception Mordaunt Hall of the New York Times found much to praise in what he called \\"an Indian love lyric\\": \\"This current offering is an extraordinarily beautiful production, intelligently directed and, with the exception of a few instances, splendidly acted. The scenic effects are charming.... The different episodes are told discreetly and with a good measure of suspense and sympathy. Some of the characters have been changed to enhance the dramatic worth of the picture, but this is pardonable, especially when one considers this subject as a whole.\\"Mordaunt Hall, \\"An Indian Love Lyric\\", New York Times, May 15, 1928, accessed February 1, 2011 Effects An article published by UCLA revealed that the 1928 film is believed to be the most authentic of the five film adaptations of Ramona since the director Edwin Carewe was part Chickasaw and Dolores del Río was raised in Mexico. Ramona is differentiated from most films with a typical Hollywood ending because of its authentic cultural values embedded throughout. An article by Indian Country Today revealed the fact that Carewe discovered del Río in Mexico and invited her to Hollywood to perform in his film. Many film enthusiasts see Carewe as del Río’s steppingstone to fame in Hollywood as an actor and singer. Del Río recorded the film's theme song, \\"Ramona.\\" It was not used in the 1936 version. Helen Hunt Jackson and Edwin Carewe shared a goal of exposing the mistreatment of the Native Americans at the hands of the U.S. Federal Government through the means of Ramona. Both the book and the film, however, were popularized because of their dramatic, romantic, and cultural aspects. Preservation status For decades, Ramona was thought to be lost until archivists rediscovered it in the Národní Filmový Archiv in Prague in 2010. The Motion Picture, Broadcasting and Recorded Sound Division of the Library of Congress later transferred Ramona’s highly flammable original nitrate film to acetate safety stock. Library of Congress Moving Image Curator Rob Stone was in charge of the challenge of converting Ramona’s Czech inter titles back into English. The only available copy was given to the Library of Congress to replicate and then send back to the Czech Republic. The restored version of the 1928 film had its world premiere in the Billy Wilder Theater with the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra playing live at the University of California, Los Angeles on March 29, 2014. Carewe's older brother Finis Fox had written Ramona's screenplay and created its intertitles.

The 'plotlands' consisted of small plots of land sold in the first half of the 20th century to people who built weekend cottages, holiday bungalows or smallholdings there. Many of the people building weekend cottages here would have come out from London. With the outbreak of the Second World War, many weekenders moved out to their plots on a permanent basis, to escape the worst effects of the Blitz. This period saw the Dunton population at its highest. After the Second World War, the new town of Basildon was created, encompassing the plotlands here and in the surrounding areas of Laindon and Pitsea. At the time, 25000 people lived in the whole area, often with unsurfaced roads and limited water supplies. Dunton Plotlands is situated to the west of Laindon and the Langdon Hills, now on the edge of the Basildon district. Today, Dunton Plotlands is part of the Essex Wildlife Trust's Langdon Nature Reserve. The Langdon Visitor Centre and the Haven Plotlands Museum, housed in a converted bungalow, exhibit the natural and social history of the area.

He was later governor of Diu on behalf of Philip III of Portugal and held the rank of Almirante-mór (Chief Admiral) in the Portuguese Navy.  Family and career  Sancho de Tovar e Silva was born to an old noble house of Castilian origin, dating back to the first centuries of the Iberian Reconquista. He was the son of Pedro de Tovar (1509–1567), Vedor de Fazenda (Overseer of Finances) of Portuguese India, and his wife Brites de Oliveira e Silva, daughter of the Lords of Oliveira . His paternal grandfather was Sancho de Tovar, the Castilian-born navigator and explorer who took part in the discovery of Brazil. From 1572 onwards, Tovar e Silva held the position of Copeiro-mór (Master of Ceremonies) at the royal court in Lisbon, and around that time he became Lord of the Honour of Molelos by marriage to Maria da Veiga e Nápoles, a wealthy heiress descended from a cadet branch of the royal house of Anjou. In 1578, together with most of the courtesan nobility, he accompanied the 24-year-old king Sebastian in his attempted Moroccan crusade, having been one of the few aristocrats to survive the encounter that opposed the Portuguese army to that of the sultan Abu Marwan Abd al-Malik I on the morning of August 4. He was, nevertheless, severely injured: according to 18th century genealogist Felgueiras Gayo, he returned covered in wounds, and contemporary authors record that he lost his right arm or hand in the battle. In 1622 Sancho was appointed governor of Diu on behalf of Philip III of Portugal in and later held the honorary position of Almirante-mór (Chief Admiral) of the Portuguese navy. He died in his Paço (Palace) of Molelos, at the age of 78, supposedly murdered by a disgruntled servant whom he had caught stealing (and subsequently fired) a few days before.

(now WebCom), was a privately held Palo Alto, California IP- telephony network switch provider founded in 1997. TouchWave developed a product line called WebSwitch that was designed to replace traditional private telephone exchange systems in small-to-medium-sized companies. WebSwitch was part of a phone system that incorporates communication features provided by the Internet. The rapid success of TouchWave was memorialized with awards and an acquisition by Ericsson Communications for $46M two years after TouchWave was founded. Ericsson continued the TouchWave product line under the name WebCom, but its efforts have been viewed as less than successful. History In 1997, TouchWave was a privately held, venture-backed startup company in Palo Alto, California, with future entrepreneur Oliver Muoto as its marketing director. Co-founded by CEO Bo Larsson, Jeff Snider, David F. Wittenkamp, and Jesper Stroe, TouchWave released its first product, WebSwitch, in 1997. WebSwitch, a Web-based phone switch, provided telephony over IP and targeted small to medium-sized businesses and branch networks of larger organizations. The WebSwitch was designed to deliver significantly lower costs for communications, ease of management and administration and offered services on a single IP-based network platform. The timing of TouchWave's late 1997 release of its phone switch product matched Level 3's development of its first softswitch, a method to connect calls from one phone line to another without a need to use traditional hardware. TouchWave made significant business and technology advances in 1998 and quickly became a recognized contributor to the VoIP industry. In March 1998, TouchWave received the Best of Show Award at both at the Microsoft Network Telephony Forum and the Computer Telephony Expo (Los Angeles) for its WebSwitch product. In April, Communications Convergence magazine identified TouchWave's WebSwitch as \\"[hinting] at the future, where voice and data will live together on a single network.\\" In July, TouchWave entered into a partnership agreement with British Telecom, the dominant fixed line telecommunications and broadband Internet provider in the United Kingdom. The partnership brought TouchWave access to technical recommendations and product feedback from British Telecom to be used to develop WebSwitch. In August, Computer Telephony awarded TouchWave its Editor's Choice Award for the WebSwitch product. In September, TouchWave introduced a new version of WebSwitch. In October 1998, TouchWave entered into an agreement with Telogy Networks to include Telogy's embedded communications software in WebSwitch in order to improve the quality of its sound transmission. By the end of 1998, TouchWave had improved its product line to where it could replace traditional private telephone exchange systems in small-to-medium-sized companies throughout the world. By early April 1999, TouchWave had upgraded their WebSwitch 1608 local area network distributed phone system to a product called WebSwitch 2000. On April 13, 1999, Swedish telecommunication company Ericsson announced that it had purchased TouchWave for $46 million. In exchange for the $46M, TouchWave provided Ericsson with Internet Protocol centric network products such as business phone and private business exchanges. The acquisition of TouchWave came at a time when multibillion-dollar companies were acquiring other relatively small Internet-connected companies, such as WebLine, Selsius, GeoTel, NBX, Dialogic, and Summa Four. Some employees from TouchWave eventually followed serial entrepreneur and former TouchWave president and CEO Samir Lehaff to Adomo, Inc., a provider of voicemail majordomo services. TouchWave co-founder Jeff Snider would go on to be vice president of enterprise sales at Ericsson and then a CEO co-founder of Adomo in 1999. WebCom With Ericsson's 1999 purchase, TouchWave became a subsidiary of Ericsson and was renamed WebCom. In April 2000, Ericsson WebCom, now based in Menlo Park, California, expanded TouchWave's WebSwitch product line with the WebSwitch 100 Phone Gateway and IP Extension Gateway. In January 2003, Business Communications Review magazine stated that Ericsson's acquisition of TouchWave \\"turned out to be of little consequence.\\" A year later, that same magazine asserted that Ericsson's acquisition of TouchWave had not produced a desired result, writing that it had \\"borne little fruit.\\" References External links * Ericsson Webcom Category:Ericsson Category:Palo Alto, California Category:Telecommunications companies established in 1997 Category:Privately held companies based in California Category:Telephone exchanges Category:VoIP companies of the United States Category:Companies based in Menlo Park, California ","title":"TouchWave"},{"id":"17736461","text":"Shafi Muhammad Shah (or Shafi Mohammad) () PP (7 September 1949–17 November 2007) was a Pakistani film and television actor.

This was the third adaptation of the film, and the first one with sound. It was the fourth American feature film using the new three strip Technicolor process. It starred Loretta Young and Don Ameche. The New York Times praised its use of new Technicolor technology but found the plot \\"a piece of unadulterated hokum.\\" It thought \\"Ramona is a pretty impossible rôle these heartless days\\" and Don Ameche \\"a bit too Oxonian\\" for a chief's son.New York Times: Ramona (1936), October 7, 1936, accessed February 14, 2011 Plot Ramona, Loretta Young, is raised in the romantic hills of Southern California by Senora Gonzago Moreno, Pauline Fredrick, on her beautiful ranch. Senora Morena is tied to raising Ramona as her own because it was Ramona’s foster mother’s dying wish. She raises Ramona along with her own child Felipe, but never truly loves Ramona because of her illegitimate status. Every year Senora Moreno hires Native Americans from Temecula to shear the ranch’s sheep. Alessandro, son of the chief, is the head of the sheep shearers. Alessandro, played by Don Amache, is admired by Native Americans and the residents for being wise, piously Catholic, and very attractive. Along with the arrival of the Native Americans, Father Salvierderra, a priest very close to Felipe and Ramona, visits the ranch so the shearers can worship before going back to Temecula. The shearing of the sheep has evolved into an event for the ranch as many people come to participate in its celebrations. Men from “over 40 miles away ride on horseback just to dance with Ramona” as she arrives back from her convent. Senora Moreno correctly suspects Felipe to be falling in love with Ramona and constantly criticizes her for nothing. Over the course of the sheep shearing days, Alessandro falls in love with Ramona and her gentle yet strong nature and Ramona quickly falls in love with Alessandro. A worker of the ranch hints at the romance to Senora Moreno and she catches the lovers declaring their love. Senora Moreno is outraged and forbids Romona to marry Alessandro. In her rage, Senora Moreno exposes Romana’s illegitimate status and the fact that her real mother was a Native American. With this new knowledge, Ramona exclaims she must be with Alessandro and “return to her people”. That night Felipe and Father Salvierderra assist Ramona to escape from the ranch and elope with Alessandro. The movie picks up many months later days before Ramona and Alessandro’s wheat is ready to harvest. Ramona takes care of their newborn daughter “Eyes of the Sky” and Alessandro prepares for a day trip to shear sheep. Out of nowhere, Alessandro’s community of natives is attacked and evicted from their land by American settlers. The attack marks the beginning of Alessandro and Ramona’s troubles as they wander throughout Southern California trying to find a permanent home not threatened by American settlers. When a white doctor refuses to treat Ramona’s baby because of their ethnicity, Eyes of the Sky dies and Alessandro begins to go insane. Alessandro slowly loses his mind due to constant humiliation. He feels guilty for taking Ramona from a life of comfort to “bootless wandering”. One day, Alessandro going through one of his episodes rides off on the horse of a white man and is shot and killed. Devastated and newly widowed, Ramona returns to Felipe and the ranch. Felipe falls quickly back in love with Ramona and marries her. They live happily with their children and the daughter of Romona and Alessandro becoming their favorite child.

It is an independent denomination that originated from the Old Catholic Ultrajectine tradition. The American Orthodox Catholic Church claims to be \\"Orthodox, but not Eastern in teaching the Faith, Catholic but not Papal in liturgy and government.\\" This means, essentially, that they incorporate parts of both Orthodox and Catholic aesthetics while denying the dogma of both.  Ordination history Its first Bishop, Archbishop Joseph René Vilatte was consecrated for the Americas on May 29, 1892, by Archbishop Alvarez, acting under mandate of the Syrian Patriarch of Antioch, assisted by two bishops of the Church of Malabar (India). Since this consecration, there has been an unbroken succession of Bishops. In addition to its Syrian Roots, the American Orthodox Catholic Church enjoys episcopal (meaning bishop) lineage from Greco-Russian-Ukrainian legacy of Archbishop Walter Myron Propheta. As late as July 21, 1952, Cardinal Mercati of the Vatican Library declared, \\"All consecrations of the Syrian Jocobite Church are valid.\\"  Female ordinations  In the 1999, the AOCC ordained Theresa Margaret Wilson, a nun and founder of the Benedictine Order of St. Michael the Archangel, to the diaconate. Wilson, the first female ordained in the denomination would then go on to be ordained as a priest and finally, in 2005, became bishop of the Diocese of Colorado. The Roman Catholic Church does not recognize the validity of ordination of women.  Denominational facts  Many of the clergy in these churches are part of the Worker-Priest system; this is, they work for a living [secularly], rather than depend on the congregation for support – thus giving their share of support to the church also. The AOCC allows remarriage and admits those who are divorced to receive communion. Priests are permitted to be married or shall freely embrace celibacy as they choose. The AOCC also welcomes women to all roles of ordination (deacon, priest and bishop). Ordination is not limited on the basis of denominational background, gender, gender identity, affectional orientation, marital status. There are certain age limitations. their ordinations are considered invalid by the Catholic Church. On December 18, 1966, clergy of the American Orthodox Catholic Church in New York City, under the leadership of Propheta, were present at an ecumenical service in St. Raymond's Church, Bronx, NY. Also invited were the Catholic, Protestant, and Anglican clergy. Bishop Terrence Cooke, then Vicar General to Cardinal Spellman of the Roman Church was present. All of the AOCC Clergy present were vested in Eastern Vestments. This was, of course, before the AOCC began to ordain women. The Diocese celebrates the Tridentine Mass in Latin and in the vernacular, which has always been the case since the latter half of the 19th Century when the first bishop, Archbishop Timetheos began his missionary endeavors in mid-America. In 1986, the Rite instituted a new Mass called \\"Worthy is the Lamb: The American Mass.\\" References * Thomas Squiers, former clergy/AOCCW External links * American Orthodox Catholic Church – Western Rite * The Pueblo Chieftain, Article on Ordination of Bishop Wilson, Colorado Category:Christian organizations established in 1976 Category:Catholicism in New York (state) Category:Catholicism in Texas Category:Catholicism in Colorado Category:Old Catholic denominations in the United States Category:1976 establishments in New York (state) ","title":"American Orthodox Catholic Church – Western Rite Mission, Diocese of New York"},{"id":"17736668","text":"alt=red bricked bridge over a small canal, surrounded in green Warstock is a district within the city of Birmingham, UK, in the southernmost suburbs roughly 1 km east of the A435 and within the ward of Highter's Heath.

It takes place in an apocalyptic world around the year 2100 and immediately follows the novel The Elves of Cintra. It details events during the Great Wars, a historical conflict referenced frequently in the Shannara books. It debuted at #2 on the New York Times Best Sellers Fiction List. The novel's title is a play on the 'Gipsy Moth' light aircraft.  Plot summary  Angel Perez is found by Kirisin and Simralin, and brought to the blind elven tracker Larkin Quill for healing. Leaving Angel, Kirisin and Simralin use a hot-air balloon to travel to the elven city of Arborlon where they discover a demon army hiding outside the city, waiting for the order to attack. The two manage to evade the demon army and enter the city where they gain an audience with the elven High Council. The King is still skeptical about the danger awaiting Arborlon until it is violently revealed in the Council that the elven tracker Tragen is a demon in disguise. Tragen is killed and the elven King is finally convinced that the Arborlon and its guardian tree, the Ellcrys, must be transported within the Loden Elfstone to a safe location. Meanwhile, the Ghost tribe is reunited with Hawk, Tessa, and Cheney. Hawk uses his magic to heal the comatose Logan Tom who has a vision in which he is instructed to help the elves bring the Loden to safety. Logan leaves the ghosts and, with the help of an Owl named Trim, finds Arborlon. There, he meets, and falls in love with, Simralin. Kirisin then uses the magic of the Loden to encase the entire city and most of its inhabitants within the small stone. Simralin, the King, and a small contingent of elves hold off the demon attackers so that Logan can help Kirisin escape with the stone. Simralin and her companions are separated from Logan and Kirisin, but not before Kirisin gives Simralin the blue Seeking Elfstones for protection. Kirisin is later captured by flying demons called Skrails, but manages to drop the Loden before he is taken to the demon camp. After a frightening interrogation by the demon commander, Findo Gask, Kirisin is rescued by Logan. They then make their way to the camp of refugees led by Helen Rice. After being healed by Larkin Quill, Angel and Larkin encounter a monstrous demon called the Klee which was sent by Findo Gask. The demon kills Larkin then suddenly flees. Angel leaves and travels towards the refugee camp. As the Ghosts move eastward Tessa reveals that she is pregnant with Hawk's child. After a skirmish with some militia, they are then attacked by the Klee. Hawk finds he can use his magic to make himself invisible, and after a struggle with the Ghosts, the Klee flees again. The Ghosts eventually return to the refugee camp, with the Klee secretly following. Logan, Angel, and the Ghosts are reunited at the camp. Logan and Angel leave in search of the Loden, which they find in the grasp of a fallen elf comrade. They return to the camp and make preparations to defend the main bridge across the Columbia River against the advancing demon army. They hope this will give the refugees time to put some distance from their demon pursuers as they escape. After defending the position as long as possible, the order is given to blow up the bridge. However, the detonation mechanism fails. Fixit, a member of the Ghosts, manages to repair it and is killed instantly in the following explosion. While searching for the Klee, Logan Tom finds Simralin, who recounts her narrow escape from the demons. They affirm their love for each other and return to the camp. The Klee, meanwhile, using its shape shifting ability tricks Hawk and Tessa to leave the camp to kill them. Candle senses the danger and brings Angel Perez, the wolf-dog Cheney, and several Ghosts to the rescue. Together they succeed in destroying the Klee. Catalya, a human who is slowly turning into a Lizard due to radiation exposure, decides to leave the camp and travel the world on her own before she completes her transformation. She is worried that the Ghosts will reject her in her misshapen form. Panther uses Cheney to track her, and the three ultimately decide to travel north together on their own, choosing to live their lives in the wilderness. When the demon army eventually catches up with the refugee caravan, Hawk uses his magic to create a massive earthquake which swallows the demon forces. Findo Gask, riding a Skrail, confronts Hawk and Angel and cripples both. Logan and Simralin return in time and Logan engages Findo. Just when it seems Findo has won, Simralin uses the Seeking Elfstones to weaken him, giving Logan the chance to deal the finishing blow. The caravan continues eastward towards the mountains for weeks, picking up equipment and groups of travelers, including various mutants, along the way. They finally arrive at a pristine valley and release Arborlon from the Loden. Hawk then leaves his friends and climbs to a lookout point where he uses his magic to generate a mist that encapsulates the entire valley, enveloping him as well. The refugees are protected from the nuclear winter that occurs when a military officer, gone mad from being trapped within a nuclear missile bunker, launches all of the weapons. The world outside Arborlon is devastated, while the refugees remain safe in the valley within the bubble of Hawk's wild magic. An unknown time later, Hawk emerges from the mist, now drained of his magic powers, and heads back into the valley in search of his old life.

Booking John and Yoko was a momentous occasion and took the 14th spot on VH1's list of \\"100 Greatest Rock & Roll Moments on TV\\".VH1's List He is now working on a coffee table book to release about the shows with John Lennon.Beatles Blog After the Mike Douglas Show, Krauss went on to produce for Good Morning America where he was nominated for two Emmys including one for \\"Producer, Best Daytime Show.\\" After Good Morning America he went on to create and produce Mother's Day with Joan Lunden where he won an ACE Award for Best Show in 1984.imdb Mother's Day was also awarded the Parent's Choice Award. Day ran for a total of 8 years on the Lifetime channel. After Mother's Day he created and executive produced the spin-off Mother's Minutes. \\"Minutes\\" were quick segments about taking care of children hosted by Joan Lunden (whom he was married to at the time). Joan and Michael released a home video called Your Newborn Baby: Everything You Need to Know. This video was called \\"one of the best instructional home-video programs ever produced\\" by TV Guide. The critical and commercial success of the home video lead to a book version as well. Krauss went on to produce many other shows but ended up collapsing his company, Michael Krauss Productions, in order to help raise his 3 daughters. In the past few years he started to bring the company back with a radio program called Great American Secrets, a segment on the Stu Taylor Show. He currently has offices in Cos Cob, Connecticut where he heads the company \\"Make It Happen Broadcasting,\\" working in part with Vanessa Miller. Krauss is also an experienced author having written two books in conjunction with Mother's Day. He also wrote a nationally syndicated newspaper column called \\"Parents Talk\\" that was available in 88 different newspapers. \\"Parents Talk\\" was a column that was released in a stripping fashion.  Jazz drumming  Michael Krauss has been drumming for most of his life, having first picked up the drum sticks at age 7. His first major band was the Four Counts, a group with his high school friends from Mumford High in Detroit. After the Four Counts ended Krauss continued to play the drums and ended up sitting in with such stars as The Buddy Rich Big Band, Harry Connick Jr., Grover Washington Jr., and The Gene Krupa Band. He also played with Stevie Wonder while in Detroit. He led his own 15 piece group at the Blue Note in Greenwich Village.

He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the St. Louis Cardinals, Chicago Cubs, Colorado Rockies and Atlanta Braves. The Cardinals drafted him as a catcher in 2003 and he converted to pitching in . Motte played a key role in the 2011 World Series championship run, saving five postseason games. In 2012, he led the National League (NL) in saves with 42. Motte had Tommy John surgery to repair an ulnar collateral ligament injury that kept him from playing all of 2013. After returning to the Cardinals midway through the 2014 season, Motte signed a one-year, $4.5 million deal with the Cubs for 2015. Amateur career Motte was born in Port Huron, Michigan. He graduated from Valley Central High School, Montgomery, New York in 2000 and played catcher on the varsity baseball team. Valley Central is also the alma mater of former MLB pitcher Matt Morris. He then attended Iona College in New Rochelle, New York. At Iona, Motte could throw to second base from behind the plate as fast as 1.76 seconds, and was clocked at throwing 85 mph from this position. While Motte never pitched for Iona, the school's pitching coach reported that, with shinguards on, Motte once released a 94 mph pitch from the mound at practice. Professional career Draft and minor leagues: Catcher (2003-2008) Cardinals selected Motte in the 19th round of the 2003 Major League Baseball draft as a catcher. In 2003 with the Peoria Chiefs, in 48 games at catcher he committed four errors with five passed balls. Early in his minor league career, he struggled as a hitter. He batted .222 in , .175 in , and .176 in . On June 29, 2005, Motte went on the disabled list (DL) for a thumb fracture while playing for the High-A Palm Beach Cardinals. Entering the season, Motte had compiled a .188 career batting average. He also had just 21 walks, 13 doubles and four home runs in 209 minor league games as a catcher. However, his arm strength and accuracy were difficult to ignore. Motte threw out 53 of 109 would-be base stealers for a 49% rate. He also recorded 160 assists in his first 181 games. Spurred by the thumb injury, declining batting average, and conspicuous throwing abilities, Motte converted to pitching. Conversion to pitcher: 2006 The results as a pitcher showed much more promise than attempting to become a Major League hitter. Between State College and Quad Cities in 2006, Motte pitched his first 39 professional innings (IP). He struck out 38 (SO) and posted a 3.69 earned run average (ERA) while allowing 10.6 hits per nine innings pitched (H/9). The next season, he improved across the board. Between Palm Beach and Springfield, he totaled 59 IP, 69 SO, a 1.98 ERA, and 6.6 H/9. That performance made him one of the Cardinals' top pitching prospects and the Cardinals added him to their 40-man roster in early December 2007 to avoid exposing him to the Rule 5 draft. Motte spent the majority of the 2008 season with the Memphis Redbirds, the St. Louis Cardinals' Triple-A farm team in the Pacific Coast League. His abilities as strikeout pitcher became even more prominent: in IP, he struck out 110, a rate of 14.8 strikeouts per nine innings pitched. St. Louis Cardinals (2008-2014) =2008–11= The Cardinals called Motte from the minor leagues on September 2, 2008. He recorded a total of 12 appearances, all in relief, with an ERA of 0.82 in his first month in the big leagues. In 11 IP, Motte struck out 16 batters, allowing three walks and five hits. He earned his first save on September 18 against Cincinnati in their ballpark, getting the final out in the ninth inning with a fly ball to left field. Motte during the 2011 World Series Parade. During the 2009 spring training camp, Motte competed with Ryan Franklin and Chris Perez in an attempt to earn the role as the Cardinals' 2009 closer; manager Tony La Russa later said he would not establish a closer. Instead, he would use a mix of relievers in the ninth inning. Motte was called on to save the first game. However, he gave up four runs to the Pittsburgh Pirates in the ninth inning. Pittsburgh won 6–4. After this blown save opportunity, La Russa moved Motte into a middle reliever role. Despite the blown the save on opening day and occasional rough outings that contributed to a 4.59 ERA, Motte recorded 14 holds. Motte became the Cardinals' de facto closer late in the 2011 season – La Russa still had not named him as the closer – helping his team win the Wild Card. Motte pitched in two games against the Philadelphia Phillies in the 2011 National League Division Series (NLDS), in which the Cardinals won the series 3 games to 2. Motte also pitched in three games in the 2011 National League Championship Series (NLCS) against St. Louis' division rival, the MIlwaukee Brewers. The Cardinals won this series in six games. Motte was on the mound for the final out of the NLCS winning the Cardinals their 18th pennant. He was also on the mound when the Cardinals defeated the Texas Rangers in the World Series. =2012= He won the NL Player of the Week Award for the first time for his week of September 17–23, after picking up his fifth consecutive save out of five opportunities and league-leading 40th. Motte finished the season with 2.75 ERA and 91 strikeouts in 76 innings, along with a National League leading 42 saves. Motte is one of five pitchers in Cardinals history to reach 40 or more saves, joining Hall of Fame pitchers Lee Smith and Bruce Sutter, as well as Jason Isringhausen and Trevor Rosenthal. =2013= On January 22, 2013, the St. Louis Cardinals reached a two-year contract with Motte, the financial details of which were not disclosed. The deal effectively bought out the final two years of Motte's arbitration eligibility. At the end of the contract he becamea free agent. Motte earned $1.95 million in 2012 and had filed for a salary of $5.5 million for 2013. The Cardinals counter-offer was reported as $4.5 million. On March 29, 2013, the Cardinals placed Motte on the DL with a strained elbow. He and the team physician at first hoped that non-surgical rehab treatment could allow him to still pitch at some point in 2013. However, seeing little – if any – improvement, the Cardinals announced on May 3 Motte would undergo season-ending Tommy John surgery to repair a torn ligament in his elbow. Manager Mike Matheny called upon Edward Mujica to replace Motte as closer. Eventually, rookie Trevor Rosenthal replaced Mujica by season's end and saved four games in the Cardinals' NL pennant-winning playoffs. Like Adam Wainwright and Chris Carpenter before him – both of whom also rehabilitated through Tommy John surgery – Motte made himself available for the Cardinals relievers during games, especially for the rookies and inexperienced relievers. After the World Series, with Motte still recovering and Rosenthal's convincing finish as closer, Matheny announced Rosenthal would be the closer for 2014. Meanwhile, Motte continued to progress and was throwing off a mound by November. Due to Motte availing himself to the other Cardinals pitchers even while he was unable to pitch, his teammates voted for him to receive the Darryl Kile Good Guy Award. He is the first player to receive the award while not making a single game appearance in the season for which he was awarded. =2014= On May 21, Motte made his return to the mound after missing 2013 due to Tommy John surgery, pitching 1 and 1/3 inning of scoreless relief. However, he struggled for the rest of the season and was ultimately left off the Cardinals' postseason roster. In 29 games he was 1-0 with a 4.68 ERA. He became a free agent after they were eliminated by the San Francisco Giants. In six seasons with the Cardinals, Motte was 18-18 with 54 saves and a 3.03 ERA with 290 strikeouts in 285 innings. Chicago Cubs (2015) On December 16,2014 Motte and the Chicago Cubs agreed to a 1-year, $4.5 million contract. In 57 games with the Cubs in 2015, Motte was 8-1 with a 3.91 ERA and six saves. Colorado Rockies (2016) On December 8, 2015, Motte signed a two- year, $10 million contract with the Colorado Rockies. In 2016 for the Rockies, in 30 games he was 0-1 with a 4.94 ERA. He was designated for assignment on March 31, 2017, to create room for Stephen Cardullo who had his contract purchased, and released on April 5. Atlanta Braves (2017) On April 9, 2017, Motte signed a minor league deal with the Atlanta Braves. He was called up on April 27 and had a 3.54 ERA in 46 games with 27 strikeouts in 40 innings. St. Louis Cardinals II (2018) On February 16, 2018, Motte signed a minor league deal to return to the Cardinals, reuniting him with the team that drafted him. He was given an invite to Spring Training but was released by the Cardinals on March 22. In nine major league seasons, Motte was 27-15 with 60 saves and a 3.30 ERA in 444 career games. In 19 career postseason games, all with the Cardinals, Motte was 1-1 with a 2.08 ERA and eight saves.  Coaching career  On June 15, 2018, he joined the University of Memphis coaching staff, although he did not formally announce his retirement. Pitching profile Motte's primary pitch is a four-seam fastball, which was clocked in the upper 90s during 2008. In 2012, it was clocked at 102 miles per hour (MPH). He also threw a cut fastball that reached 93 MPH and a sinking fastball that reached 96 MPH, and, rarely, an 85-MPH changeup. His cutter has shown the widest variance of movement of all his pitches, to being anywhere from flat vertically to moving up to eight inches. He also regularly threw a curveball through the 2010 season, but has discontinued it since last throwing it in 2011. Personal life Motte is a Christian. Motte is married to Caitlin Motte. Together they have a daughter, Margaret, and a son, Sutter. The couple runs two foundations: the Jason Motte Foundation, and a cancer awareness foundation called \\"Strikeout Childhood Cancer.\\" While recovering from Tommy John surgery in 2013, Motte disclosed that his encounters with numerous people stricken with cancer – from his grandfather to Cardinals fans, including many children – moved him to visit and encourage them. As a result, Motte and the Cardinals organized a pediatric cancer awareness day on September 23, 2013, to set aside 5,000 game tickets at the pavilion that cost $10.00 each, with $3.00 per ticket going to the Jason Motte Foundation. An additional 1,000 tickets were donated to pediatric cancer patients just released from the hospital. For those unable to go to Busch Stadium, Motte organized a group of several of his teammates to see the children in person.

Origins and education Coventry was the third son by the second marriage of Thomas Coventry, 1st Baron Coventry to Elizabeth Aldersley; he was the brother of Sir William Coventry, uncle of the Marquess of Halifax, uncle of Sir John Coventry, and brother-in-law of Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury. He matriculated from Queen's College, Oxford in 1632 aged 14, and graduated the following year. Within a year, he was a Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, and he remained one until 1648. He graduated in both arts and law. He may have become Chancellor of the diocese of Llandaff as early as 1638. In 1640, he obtained leave to travel, and was abroad until just before the Restoration. He was thus absent from England during the English Civil Wars. Career By 1654, he was a captain in the Dutch army, but in contact with Charles II in his exile. During part of his time abroad, he was employed as a royalist agent in Germany and Denmark, in company with Lord Wentworth, until the partnership was dissolved by a violent quarrel, leading apparently to a duel. The reports of his whereabouts at this date are very confused; Henry, his elder brother Francis, and his younger brother, William, being all attached to the exiled court and all commonly spoken of as Coventry. Before the Restoration Francis had ceased to take any active part in public affairs, and William had devoted himself more especially to the service of the Duke of York, whose secretary he continued to be while the duke held the office of Lord High Admiral. In 1660, he returned to England with letters for Presbyterian leaders including Sir Anthony Ashley-Cooper, who had been married to Henry's sister Margaret. At the same time, he enjoyed the patronage of Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon, and remained a faithful friend of Clarendon to the end.Ollard, Richard Clarendon and his Friends Macmillans 1987 p.235 In 1661, Henry became Member of Parliament (MP) for Droitwich. He remained in the service of the crown, holding the position of Groom of the Bedchamber from 1662 to 1672, and in September 1664, he was sent as ambassador to Sweden, where he remained for the next two years, \\"accustoming himself to the northern ways of entertainment, and this grew upon him with age\\". In 1667, he was sent, jointly with Lord Holles, as plenipotentiary to negotiate the Treaty of Breda, which, after the disgraceful summer, was finally concluded at Breda. Fall of Clarendon During the negotiations at Breda, he found time to write a heartfelt letter of condolence to his old friend Lord Clarendon on the death of his wife Frances Hyde. Unlike his brother, William, Henry opposed Clarendon's impeachment and banishment, and his eloquent speeches in the House of Commons in Clarendon's defence enhanced his reputation. When the King, who was determined that Clarendon must fall, expressed his displeasure at his known wishes in the matter being defied, Henry with his usual frankness replied that if he could not speak his mind in Parliament, he had best not go there at all. To the King's credit, despite their disagreements, he was later willing to raise Henry to high office, Coventry's loyalty as a friend would be further demonstrated by his attitude to Clarendon in exile : he cancelled the prohibition on visits by his children to Clarendon in his French exile and may have been working towards Clarendon's eventual return from exile when Clarendon died in 1674. Coventry then organised Clarendon's private funeral in Westminster Abbey.Ollard p.346 Secretary of State In 1671 he was again sent on an embassy to Sweden, and in 1672 he was appointed Secretary of State for the Northern Department, transferring to the Southern Department in 1674. In this office he continued till 1680, when his health, shattered by frequent attacks of gout, compelled him to retire from public life.Kenyon, J.P. Robert Spencer, 1st Earl of Sunderland Longmans Green and Co. 1958 p. 23 He was a capable administrator, who built up an efficient intelligence service: even the most minor complaints against the Crown, such as the \\"curse on the King for his bad example to other husbands\\", uttered by the wife of the town gaoler in Newcastle upon Tyne, came to his attention. Popish Plot During the Popish Plot, while the nerve of his colleague, Joseph Williamson, cracked under the strain, Coventry generally maintained his composure, but he was concerned at the public hysteria: \\"the nation and the city are in as great a consternation as can be imagined.\\"Kenyon, J.P. The Popish Plot Phoenix Press Reissue 2000 p.155 His cynical, sceptical nature, like Charles II's, disinclined him, at least in the early stages, to believe in the Plot, and he was particularly wary of the notorious informer William Bedloe. Like most rational people at the time, he came to believe that there had been a plot of some sort, although he regarded much of the evidence as suspect. During the Exclusion Crisis, he was one of the first to warn that any attempt to bar the Duke of York from the succession might lead to civil war: \\"if that Prince go into another place, it must cost you a standing army to bring him back.\\"Kenyon p.105 Reputation According to Gilbert Burnet, \\"he was a man of wit and heat, of spirit and candour. He never gave bad advices; but when the king followed the ill advices which others gave, he thought himself bound to excuse if not to justify them. For this the Duke of York commended him much. He said in that he was a pattern to all good subjects, since he defended all the king's counsels in public, even when he had blamed them most in private with the king himself\\". He had \\"an unclouded reputation\\" for honesty: it is to his credit that after holding public office for nearly 20 years he had not accumulated any large fortune; though no doubt in easy circumstances, he wrote of himself as feeling straitened by the loss of his official salary on 31 December 1680. Writing to Sir Robert Carr on 12 September 1676 and regretting his inability to fulfil some promise relative to a vacant post, he said: \\"Promises are like marriages; what we tie with our tongues we cannot untie with our teeth. I have been discreet enough as to the last, but frequently a fool as to the first.\\" Clarendon, grateful for Henry's loyalty to him at the lowest point of his career, called him \\"a much wiser man\\" than his brother, William, whom Clarendon never forgave for what he saw as William's betrayal of him in 1667.

The basic concept of this mission is that probationers under probation supervision will be appropriately supervised and assisted to become law-abiding individuals. The supervision may be intensive for offenders whose behavior poses a continuous threat to public safety or mid-level for those whose offenses pose less of a risk to the public.Abadinsky, Howard. 2003. Probation and Parole: Theory and Practice. 8th ed. Upper Saddle River, N.J.: Prentice Hall  Intensive supervision programs  DUI Intensive Supervision Program (DISP): DISP is an intensive supervision program that targets high risk drunk driver and offenders whose offenses involve the use of alcohol/drugs and result in great bodily injury. With an emphasis on field work, DISP officers collaborate with DUI treatment programs and law enforcement check points to increase compliance with court ordered treatment requirements and conditions of probation as they are related to drinking and driving. DISP officers conduct random home visits and conduct on the spot alcohol and drug testing. The focus of this program is community safety, victim reparations and offender rehabilitation. Family Violence and Sex Offenders (FVSO) Program: The Family Violence/Sex Offender Program is an intensive field supervision unit designed to supervise family violence (e.g. domestic violence, child abuse, elder abuse or stalking) and sex offenders who are on formal probation. Probation officers evaluate risk and need and provide referrals to assist the defendant to make changes through cognitive behavioral interventions. Officers provide intensive supervision, which encompasses in-office meetings, field or home visits, telephone contacts, and liaison with law enforcement that sometimes includes surveillance. The officers work closely with the courts, polygraph providers, victim advocates, and community-based treatment agencies. Officers undertake continuous specialized training and support, educate, and protect victims and their families. Mentally Ill Offender Program (MIO): This program targets severely mentally ill adult probationers who require prevention/intervention services to remain out of custody and in the community. The goals of this intensive supervision program are medication maintenance, treatment for substance abuse and the promotion of the highest functioning skills possible for this population. Parents And Their Children (PATCh): PATCh is a specialized, intensive supervision caseload that focuses on defendants assigned to the Violent Offender Program (VOP) who have children from birth to age ten living in the home. The probation officer works with the defendant and provides referrals to necessary community agencies such as employment, therapy, cognitive behavior programs, and anger management in order to influence change, thus minimizing the cycle of violence and protecting the children. Violent Offender Program: The Violent Offender Program (VOP) is an intensive supervision unit. The defendants almost always have committed an offense involving violence (assault with deadly weapon, battery with serious bodily injury, etc.). The Probation officers meet with the defendant twice a month, in the office and once at their home or business. Many have been ordered to undergo drug/alcohol testing, and are put on a random testing program. If the defendant continues to use drugs and/or alcohol, fails to get counseling, or otherwise violates his conditions of probation, they will be re-arrested by the Probation officer and returned to court for additional sentencing and/or other sanctions. Women And Their Children (WATCh): WATCh is a collaborative, zero-tolerance intensive supervision program that works with pregnant women to bring drug and alcohol-free babies into the world. Probation officers supervise all pregnant juvenile and adult offenders with a history of drug/alcohol abuse. The case will remain in the WATCH program for at least three to six months following the child's birth with follow-up by mid-level supervision officers. Youthful Offender Program (YOP): The Youthful Offender Program is an intensive supervision program that targets high-risk youthful offenders 18–25 years old. The focus of this program is community safety and offender rehabilitation.  Juvenile programs  Truancy Intervention Program (TIP): provides intensive supervision and case management services by collaborative partners (Probation, Schools, and Social Services) to approximately 500 habitually truant 601 Ward's of the Juvenile Court with a goal of reducing school truancy and related delinquent behavior. The Probation Department provides a School Probation Officers at area schools. Juvenile Sex Offender Management (JSOM): This unit provides intensive monitoring for minors on probation in the community with a history of sexually abusive behavior. The primary goals of JSOM are to provide safety to the victim(s), potential victims, and the community. Additional goals include providing for offender accountability, promoting offender rehabilitation, and reducing the risk to re-offend. These goals are pursued through a team approach, involving close collaboration between Probation Officers, therapists, law enforcement, victim advocates, and other related agencies. Community Assessment Teams (CAT): is a prevention program serving 3200 families annually with youth between the ages of 8 through 17 who have chronic behavior problems that place them at risk of entering the juvenile justice or dependency system. Juvenile Drug Court: This nine-month program intensively supervises juvenile drug abusers who are non- violent but who have repeated failed drug-treatment programs. Wards appear before the judge weekly and are tested for drugs regularly and randomly. There are incentives for positive behavior and a series of graduated sanctions for those who fail to comply. Breaking Cycles (BC): Graduated sanctions improve the justice system and community response to juvenile crime through a series of graduated sanctions (verbal warring, loss of privileges, intensive counseling, increased supervision, house arrest, eventually leading to incarceration) Youthful Offender Unit, (YOU): Usually violent offenders who have been diverted from State Juvenile Prison into this 16 month probation program, Probation officers will have smaller caseloads so they can maintain closer contact with the offenders, and the offenders will have to be working or in job training and be enrolled in other rehabilitation programs. This is the result of 2008 lawsuit that remanded, as part of a court-ordered overhaul of the Division of Juvenile Justice in the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, the state will be reducing by about one-third the number of young offenders in its custody by accepting only those who commit the most serious crimes.http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/metro/20080406-9999-lz1n6change.html  Special operations  CATCH ID Team: Closely supervises offenders, conducting fourth waiver searches(offenders sign, as a part of their conditions of probation, a waiver of their Fourth Amendment Constitutional right against unreasonable search and seizure, allowing their person, residence, or property to be searched at any time without requiring probable cause or warrant, by the probation officer) on probationers who have histories of identity theft, forgery, or grand theft through the use of a computer. Electronic Surveillance Program (ESP): This is a jail diversion program, monitoring offenders under house arrest. Field Action Specialty Team (FAST): Probation officers provide intrusive activities for caseloads in crisis, usually as a result of probation violations, ongoing criminal conduct, or active police investigations targeting the offender. Officers conduct unannounced field visits, fourth waiver searches, and arrests of dangerous high-risk offenders. Gang Suppression Unit (GSU): Officers collect criminal intelligence using monthly contacts with probationers in the field and in the office, random drug testing, conduct fourth waiver searches, submit reports of new offenses or probation violations, and recommend prosecution of probation violators. The unit also provides gang awareness presentations to schools, community-based organizations and other law enforcement agencies. Home Supervision (Juvenile Only): Through this program offenders may be placed back into their homes and frequently supervised by a probation officer instead of being incarcerated in Juvenile Hall or jail. There are strict restrictions on their movements and activities and parolees can be monitored by an electronic surveillance detection device. Jurisdictions Unified for Drug and Gang Enforcement (JUDGE): This is a multi-jurisdictional task force of Probation Officers working in partnership with officers from San Diego Police, Chula Vista Police, National City Police, State Parole, San Diego County Sheriff, Escondido Police, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Oceanside Police and the California Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement. This unit targets drug and gang involved probationers, parolees, and other criminals who have been convicted of \\"strike\\" crimes (California's three strikes law, targeting repeat felons who have committed a violent felony with possible life sentences). This task force is operated under a grant that is administered by the San Diego County District Attorney. Regional Auto Theft Task Force (RATT): RATT is a multi-agency law enforcement team with the task of increasing the apprehension and prosecution of professional auto theft and cargo theft. Warrant Unit: The unit conducts investigations using computer records, surveillance operations, collateral contacts, and law enforcement information sharing to apprehend probation absconders. This program is currently defunct due to budget cuts. Multi-jurisdictional Units: Probation Officers are assigned to multi-jurisdictional task forces such as the U.S. Marshal's Fugitive Task Force, Narcotics Task Force, FBI Task Force, North County Regional Gang Task Force, East County Gang Task Force and the Violent Crime Task Force.  History  On Wednesday, October 23, 1907, the Superior Court of California appointed a Probation Committee according to the laws of California established in 1903. The committee consisted of three Board of Supervisors and four citizens. They served without compensation and acted as an advisory board. The following made up the original committee: Hugh J. Baldwin, Rev. E. E. Crabtree, Dr. W. F. Gearhart, Mrs. H. A. Ballou, Mrs. Mabel E. O'Farrell, Mrs. A. E. Collins, and Dr. H. C. Oatman. On November 6, 1907, the Board of Supervisors appointed a sub-committee to study the feasibility of a detention home for children. Jacob A. Reed was appointed the probation officer of San Diego County between November 7, 1907, and February 5, 1908. The Board of Supervisors purchased a seven-bedroom farmhouse on in Mission Valley, southwest of the present-day Interstate 8 and SR-163 interchange (east of Holiday Inn, west of Seven Seas Motor Lodge) to house juvenile offenders between November 1907 and July 1909. On August 11, 1909, the county school superintendent was ordered to establish a school at the Detention Home. On November 4, 1909, the Probation Committee nominated Mr. and Mrs. F. Phelps for the position of superintendent and matron of the Detention Home. The Board of Supervisors unanimously approved. The Detention Home served delinquents and dependents, infants and teenagers. In April 1911, the Probation Committee nominated and the Superior Court appointed J.A. Reed's wife, Lillie A. Reed, and Mrs. May Beck, as assistant probation officers. The salary for the probation officer was $125 per month. The first assistant was paid $120 per month and second assistant $100 per month. J. A. Reed and Lillie A. Reed sued the county's Auditor, Chauncey R. Hammond, after he refused to pay the monthly salaries to the two assistant probation officers on the grounds it was illegal for females to work for county government. The Superior Court and Court of Appeal ruled in favor of the Reed's. Lillie was paid her salary plus interest. W. E. Blair was appointed chief probation officer in 1912. W. J. Mosher was appointed chief probation officer in 1917. Sarah Anthony became the superintendent of the San Diego Detention Home, which housed 17 children on her first day of February 1, 1919. Children housed at the facility raised chickens, rabbits, vegetables, and bees. Herbert Sallee was appointed chief probation officer in 1920. Two units were added to the Detention Home in 1923 and a new main unit in 1927. Upon completion, the San Diego Detention Home had 20 rooms and an eight-bed dormitory for older boys; 22 rooms for girls; 13 rooms for small boys; three schoolrooms; a manual training shop; 17 bedrooms for staff; and additional offices and rooms for operations. W. F. Worchester was appointed chief probation officer in 1926. On December 15, 1936, the \\"Juvenile Mountain Forestry Camp\\" for older boys was established at the base of Mount Woodson in Ramona. It had a maximum capacity of 38. In 1942 a camp for younger boys was established nearby with a maximum capacity of 22. The boys stayed for between 20 and 30 weeks working with a state forester to clear fire breaks during the day and attending school at night. Some of the boys attended Ramona High School. Boys also received shop training. The San Diego Detention Home was renamed the \\"Anthony Home\\" on January 29, 1939, to honor Sarah Anthony. At the time of the name change, 75 children were staying there for a few days to six months. Charges included being a runaway, sex delinquency, theft, drunkenness, and use of narcotics. The Detention Home housed 14,254 boys and girls during Sarah Anthony's tenure as superintendent from February 1, 1919, to June 15, 1941. By January 1941, there was 15 sworn probation staff consisting of one chief probation officer, two supervising assistant probation officers, and 12 assistant probation officers. Nearly every one had a four-year degree and several had completed graduate courses. Pete Geiser was appointed chief probation officer in 1941. The Anthony Home's front door had to remain unlocked at all times beginning in 1942 because the Fire Marshal condemned the building. Boys held in the maximum-security unit lived in small six-man tanks with bars, concrete walls, no natural light, and a toilet in the middle of the room. Boys were not segregated according to age or charge. In 1942, there were two assistant probation officers assigned to the adult division. They completed 334 pre- sentence reports, which included doing an entire social study on each case. They were responsible for 429 adult probationers by July 1943. Most of their time was spent preparing pre-sentence reports for the courts and collecting restitution from the probationers. Little time was left for supervision. In 1943, the Probation Committee commissioned the National Probation Association to do a thorough study of the department. The 75-page report entitled, \\"The Juvenile Delinquency Problem,\\" focused on the overcrowding at the Anthony Home and the lack of officers to properly supervise the increasing number of delinquents. World War II increased the county's population from fewer than 289,000 people in 1940 to 485,000 in 1943. Between 1940 and 1943, boys' arrests increased 51% and girls' arrests increased 466%. The most common charges for boys were theft and disorderly conduct. The most common charges for girls were runaway and vagrancy. It was noted that many of the runaway girls were arrested for prostitution. In June 1943, the average length of stay in the Anthony Home for boys was 15.5 days and for girls it was 32 days. (The boys had a camp to go to). On average it took 11 days before the first court hearing for each child. In July 1943, the average daily attendance of the Anthony Home was 78. Sixteen- and seventeen-year-old boys were held in adult jail. On September 15, 1943, there were 737 children under the department's jurisdiction. Caseloads varied from 50 to 130, with 92 being the average. Arther Flakoll was appointed chief probation officer in 1944. After a series of grand jury criticisms, a ballot measure for a $500,000 bond to build a new 100-bed, 5-unit juvenile detention facility on a site in Mission Valley was put before the voters in 1948. The Anthony Home would be used for Juvenile Court and Probation offices. It was rejected. Charles Rogers was appointed chief probation officer in 1948. In 1950, an $875,000 bond to build a new detention home that looked like a dormitory or school but guarded against escapes was put on the November ballot. It passed. On November 28, 1951, The Board of Supervisors voted 4 to 1 to build a new Juvenile Hall on a recently acquired site in Kearny Mesa purchased for $33,275. In 1954, the average daily attendance of the Anthony Home was 115. Juvenile Hall was completed at a price of $1,250,000 in 1954. Dedication ceremonies occurred on Monday, June 21, 1954. A tour followed. Ninety-one wards were transferred from the Anthony Home to Juvenile Hall on June 30, 1954. After the move, the Anthony Home's maximum- security unit served as an adult jail and the school served mentally handicapped children. The original Kearny Mesa Juvenile Hall included five units with a designed capacity of 111, but could accommodate up to 160 with double bunking. Three units were designed for 68 boys and two units were designed to house 43 girls. The Evening Tribune reported experts called it the finest juvenile detention facility in the United States at the time. Juvenile Hall incorporated all the latest advancements in juvenile detention facilities including: concrete construction, a visual control point, a centralized kitchen, heated carts eliminating the need for a large dining room, individual units, and separate classrooms and play yards from the living unit. In July 1962, the Probation Department proposed building a new facility for girls to be called the \\"Girls Rehabilitation Facility\\" (GRF). After months of struggling to hire a GRF superintendent because of a low salary offering, Marvin D. Smith was hired on April 27, 1963. He was a sociologist and former assistant superintendent of Juvenile Hall. He had ten children. The GRF program officially began in July 1963 when 18 girls moved into an unused wing in Juvenile Hall. The program emphasized freedom of choice, training in impulse control, acceptance of responsibility, and practice in cooperative living. In 1965, parents were charged $13 per day to house kids in Juvenile Hall or GRF. They were charged $10 per day for Rancho del Campo. On December 3, 1966, Las Colinas in Santee was dedicated for use by the Girls Rehabilitation Facility. It housed a maximum of 60 girls ages 14–17, at a construction price of $898,602. Girls served sentences of four to five months. The Juvenile Probation Center opened in 1967 across from Juvenile Hall. Due to concerns Rancho del Campo would be condemned, the County decided to build a new boys rehabilitation camp at Camp Elliott in Santee in 1967, but the city denied a building permit. The County also looked at sites in Imperial Beach and Otay Mesa, but never was able to secure construction approval despite having money for the project. Eddie Weigle served as acting chief probation officer from July through November 1967. Kenneth Fare was appointed chief probation officer in November 1967. Volunteers In Probation (VIP), became incorporated in the summer of 1970. They began recruiting volunteers to work with up to 15,000 probationers. Reuben Garcia was the first VIP ever hired. He was a 47-year-old construction worker. The Reverend David Ellisor became the first regularly employed chaplain/religious services coordinator for VIP. On June 8, 1971, voters rejected a $12 million bond that would have covered the construction of a new boy's rehabilitation facility, a new juvenile hall in the South Bay, and additions to Juvenile Hall and Juvenile Court. County officials believed Rancho del Campo was beyond economic repair. Robert MacDonald served as acting chief probation officer from 1976–1977. In August 1976, the Board of Supervisors transferred Las Colinas to the Sheriff's Department to be used by incarcerated women, and the girls were sent back to a wing in Juvenile Hall. Michael Garvey was appointed chief probation officer in 1977. Cecil Steppe was appointed chief probation officer in 1980. A new Girls Rehabilitation Facility was dedicated on February 24, 1981. The construction cost $703,500 to refurbish a wing of Juvenile Hall in less than four months. The area that now serves as Intake, Booking, and Release was originally the Juvenile Court wing. The current Juvenile Court was built in 1985. In 1992, Juvenile Hall was remodeled. Air conditioning, a new 90-bed wing, three classrooms, and 30 additional beds to existing rooms were added. The Sally Port was added. Gerard Williams served as acting chief probation officer from 1992–1993. Alan Crogan was appointed chief probation officer in 1993. Facing overcrowding at Juvenile Hall and swelling juvenile caseloads, District 4 Supervisor Ron Roberts flew to Washington DC to meet with the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJDDP) to ask for assistance. OJJDP approved San Diego County to participate in a pilot project to create an evidence-based juvenile justice system that included a continuum of care from prevention to intervention, diversion, treatment, and incarceration. The system, which became known as Breaking Cycles, relied on collaboration from community-based organizations, law enforcement, schools, the court, and local government to succeed. The resulting system became a model for juvenile justice systems across the nation. From the time the Breaking Cycles program was implemented until 1999, juvenile court felony filings dropped nearly 40 percent and between 1998 and 2001 the average daily attendance at Juvenile Hall dropped by 33 percent. In 2001, a 30-bed maximum-security unit opened in Juvenile Hall. The single rooms all contained toilets. After the expansion, the court mandated capacity was 537 in 12 living units. In December 2001, construction began on a new juvenile detention facility in East Otay Mesa. On July 10, 2003, a new wing of the Girls' Rehabilitation Facility was dedicated. It added 20 new beds, a new bathroom, and new dayroom at a cost of $1 million. The expansion increased the capacity to 50. Dave Cranford served as acting chief probation officer from August through December 2003. Vincent J. Iaria was appointed chief probation officer in December 2003. On June 4, 2004, Chief Probation Officer Vincent J. Iaria delivered the keynote address at a ribbon cutting ceremony for the new East Mesa Juvenile Detention Facility. Board of Supervisors Greg Cox and Dianne Jacob also address the more than 100 attendees. A tour followed. On June 25, 2004, 100 detainees transferred into the East Mesa Juvenile Detention Facility (EMJDF) from the newly renamed Kearny Mesa Juvenile Detention Facility (still called \\"Juvenile Hall\\" by old timers). The facility cost $55 million to build, including the access road and landscaping. The facility sits on . It has a maximum capacity of 380 detainees. All rooms have toilets, sinks, and drinking fountains. Mack Jenkins was appointed chief probation officer in December 2007. Adolfo Gonzales was appointed chief probation officer in May 2016.

Subsequently, The Hobbit has been adapted for a variety of media including stage, screen, radio, board games and video games. Several of these adaptations have received critical recognition of their own, including a video game that won the Golden Joystick Award, a scenario of a war game that won an Origins Award, and an animated picture nominated for a Hugo Award. Dramatizations The following is a list of dramatizations of The Hobbit. Film and television * The 1967 short animated film The Hobbit was the first ever film production of The Hobbit. It was directed by Gene Deitch in Czechoslovakia. American film producer William L. Snyder obtained the rights to the novel from the Tolkien estate very cheaply while it was still largely unknown, with the proviso that he produce a \\"full-colour film\\" by 30 June 1966, and immediately set about producing a feature-length film, with screenplay by Deitch. The project fell through, but after the explosion in the novel's popularity, Snyder realized that his contract had not required the film to be of any length: he therefore instructed Deitch to create a 12-minute film based on his earlier work so that he could retain his rights. He later sold the rights for around $100,000 (not adjusted for inflation). The final project has very little to do with the source material. * The Hobbit, an animated version of the story produced by Rankin/Bass, debuted as a television movie in the United States in 1977. Romeo Muller won a Peabody Award for the teleplay. The film was also nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, but lost to Star Wars.Kask, TJ. NBC's The Hobbit, Dragon Magazine, December 1977. * The BBC children's television series Jackanory presented an adaptation of The Hobbit in 1979. Internet Movie Database: Jackanory, \\"The Hobbit\\" (1979) Unusually for the programme, the adaptation was narrated by several people. According to one of the narrators David Wood, the release of the production on video has been repeatedly stopped by the Tolkien Estate.David Wood Guest Book at Stiles and Drewe * A Soviet 1985 television play Сказочное путешествие мистера Бильбо Беггинса Хоббита (\\"The Fantastic Journey of the Hobbit Mr. Bilbo Baggins\\") aired on the Leningrad TV Channel. * A live-action film version was announced on 18 December 2007, to be co-produced by MGM and New Line Cinema, and produced by Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson. The narrative of the film was expanded and split over two parts. Guillermo Del Toro was originally signed on to direct both parts but withdrew from the project in May 2010, leaving Jackson as director. It was announced on 22 October 2010, after months of speculation, that Martin Freeman would play Bilbo Baggins. The casting had been uncertain due to the unexpected success of the summer BBC adaptation of Sherlock and Freeman's subsequent filming commitments for the second series. Filming began on 21 March 2011. The adaptation includes a new character that did not appear in the original book, Tauriel, who is the head of the Elven guard, and played by Evangeline Lilly.\\"Evangeline Lilly Reveals Her Fears About Her ‘Hobbit’ Character\\", Access Hollywood, 3 October 2011. On 30 July 2012, Jackson revealed that there would be a third Hobbit film due to there being so much unused material from Tolkien's novel and appendices.Facebook The third and final film in the Hobbit series was released in December 2014. *The Finnish live action television miniseries Hobitit, from 1993, is an adaptation of The Lord of the Rings rather than The Hobbit (although it shows a flashback to Bilbo's encounter with Gollum). The name, literally \\"The Hobbits\\", reflects the fact that it follows only the storyline of Frodo and Sam (large battles and other events were clearly beyond the means of this relatively simple TV series). Radio * A BBC Radio 4 series The Hobbit radio drama is an adaptation by Michael Kilgarriff, broadcast in eight parts (four total hours) from September to November 1968.

Games and toys   Board, war and role-playing games  The Hobbit has been the subject of several board games. Below are examples of some of the published games. * In the 1970s, TSR, Inc. released two editions of a war game based on The Battle of Five Armies, designed by Larry Smith, using cardboard tokens and a map of the area around the Lonely Mountain as the setting. The game was criticized for a lack of clarity in the rules, and praised for evoking the onslaught of the Warg and goblin army. * Iron Crown Enterprises has produced several games based on The Hobbit: **Coleman Charlon designed The Lonely Mountain (released in 1985), which features groups of adventurers entering Smaug's Lair to capture his treasure before he awakens. **Also in 1985, Iron Crown Enterprises released its version of The Battle of Five Armies, developed by Richard H. Britton, Coleman Charlton, and John Crowell, again taking the theme of a war game and using card counters and a paper map. **The Hobbit Adventure Boardgame [sic] was the last game from Iron Crown based directly on The Hobbit. They continued to publish the Middle-earth Role Playing Game, a game licensed on both The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings properties, combining elements from both works.\\"What is MERP?\\" on Other Hands * Middle-earth Strategic Gaming (formerly Middle-earth Play-by-Mail), which has won several Origin Awards, uses the Battle of Five Armies as an introductory scenario to the full game and includes characters and armies from the book.More information can be found at: the Middle-earth Games page for the game (retrieved 25 February 2008) * In 2005, Games Workshop released a Battle of Five Armies tabletop wargame, designed by Rick Priestley using highly detailed 10-millimetre figures sculpted by Mark Harrison, based on Games Workshop's Warmaster rules and designed to be played in a small space suitable for the home gamer.More information can be found at: Games Workshop's Specialist Games site Games Workshop also is expanding its Lord of the Rings: The Strategy Battle Game in the form of The Hobbit: The Strategy Battle Game. * In 2011, British game publisher Cubicle 7 released The One Ring - Adventures over the Edge of the Wild, a role-playing game set several years after the events of The Hobbit.

Consumer Products and Weta Workshop announced they would offer a \\"range of authentic prop replicas, collectibles and merchandise based on the upcoming films\\" in October 2012.  Video games  Several computer and video games, both licensed and unlicensed, have been based on the story. * One of the most successful was The Hobbit, an award-winning computer game developed in 1982 by Beam Software and published by Melbourne House with compatibility for most computers available at the time. A copy of the novel was included in each game package to encourage players to engage the text, since ideas for gameplay could be found therein. Likewise, the game does not attempt to re-tell the story, but rather sits alongside it, using the narrative to both structure and motivate gameplay.

The research, organized and conducted by Dr. Mary Jo Cooley Hidecker, Ph.D., CCC-A/SLP, follows two widely used classification systems for cerebral palsy: the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) and the Manual Ability Classification System (MACS). Dr. Ray Kent of the University of Wisconsin–Madison, Dr. Peter Rosenbaum of McMaster University, and Dr. Nigel Paneth of Michigan State University are also an integral part of this research.  CFCS Variables  Design and development of the CFCS addressed a number of issues in cerebral palsy including a general lack of knowledge regarding the communication abilities of individuals with CP. The 5 CFCS levels are used instead of the more vague labels of \\"mild, moderate, severe, profound\\" difficulties. The system is designed to be a quick and simple instrument used by a person familiar with the individual to be classified. Variables of communication ability used within the CFCS include sender roles (being able to communicate a message to someone), receiver roles (being able to understand a message from someone), pace of communication, and the degree of familiarity with a communication partner. The CFCS follows the World Health Organization's (WHO's) International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF).  Purposes  Possible benefits of the CFCS include describing functional communication performance using a common language among professionals and laypersons and recognizing the use of all effective methods of communication including augmentative and alternative communication (AAC). The CFCS can be used in research projects as a way of describing the communication performance of participants. The CFCS can be used clinically by parents and professionals to open-up discussions regarding how different communication environments, partners, and/or communication tasks might affect an individual's CFCS level and to choose goals to improve the person's communication effectiveness.

The SCS process feeds hot rolled sheet steel, either as individual blanks or as a continuous strip that is uncoiled, into the SCS \\"brushing machine\\". Within the machine the steel is passed between sets of rotating roller brushes that spin on an axis perpendicular to the sheet's direction of travel. The roller brush exterior is an engineered abrasive, similar to Scotchbrite, that makes contact with the steel under pressure. Each roller brush spins against the steel at a speed of 900 to 1000 revolutions per minute, \\"scrubbing away\\" the outer layers of mill scale – hematite and magnetite – and most of the inner layer, wustite. The remaining wustite layer is only a few micrometres thick and highly polished to a smooth surface. Three such roller brushes are typically applied to each surface of the steel sheet, for a total of six roller brushes per SCS brushing machine. Numerous spray nozzles within the brushing machine provide water to rinse the removed scale and any other debris from the steel surface and to cool the friction heat generated in the brushes. The water is filtered and re-used in this closed- loop rinsing/filtering system. The SCS process imparts a measure of rust resistance to the sheet steel, so that when exposed to a noncondensing atmosphere, its propensity to rust is markedly less than that of hot rolled steel that is not treated with the SCS process. The exact metallurgical phenomenon underlying this transformation of the surface to make it more rust resistant is not fully understood; however, it is theorized that the remaining wustite layer (chemical symbol FeO) contains a much lower proportion of oxygen than the removed hematite and magnetite layers and is, therefore, more stable and less prone to oxidation when exposed to a noncondensing atmosphere. The SCS process and its attendant equipment is now paired with a related process, eco pickled surface or EPS. The EPS technology accomplishes a more complete removal of surface oxides than does the SCS process; however, it can also leave the surface with an overall rougher texture, as indicated by Ra or roughness average. The SCS process is applied directly after the EPS process to produce a smoother surface when desired. References Further reading * Leveled, Cleaned Hot Band Competes With CRS by J.

Oxfordian (Upper Jurassic) cyclic sediments at Péry-Reuchenette, near Tavannes, kanton Bern, Switzerland. Alternating layers are limestone (light, more competent) and marl/clay; dominant cycle is the 200000 year-cycle. In stratigraphy and geology, an eonothem is the totality of rock strata laid down in the stratigraphic record deposited during a certain eon of the continuous geologic timescale. The eonothem is not to be confused with the eon itself, which is a corresponding division of geologic time spanning a specific amount of (hundreds of millions of) years, during which rocks were formed that are classified within the eonothem. Eonothems have the same names as their corresponding eons, which means during the history of the Earth only four eonothems were formed. Oldest to newest these are the Hadean, Archean, Proterozoic, and Phanerozoic. A rock stratum, fossil or feature present in the \\"upper Phanerozoic\\" eonothem would therefore have originated within the \\"later Phanerozoic\\" eon. In practice, the rock column is discontinuous: Eonothems, despite discontinuities (locally missing strata or unconformities), can be compared to others where the rock record is more complete and, by correlation of points of correspondence, be fixed appropriately within the eon. They are therefore useful as broad chronostratigraphic units, specifying approximate age within the timelines within the rock column. Eonothems are subdivided into erathems and their smaller subdivisions within geology and paleobiology and their sub-fields, and a whole system of cross-disciplinary classification by strata is in place with oversight by the International Commission on Stratigraphy. Eonothems are not often used in practice as expert dating estimates can be and usually are specified into the more refined timelines of smaller chronostratigraphic units, which can be subdivided in turn down to the many defined stages, the smallest formally recognised units used in dating. (see the hierarchy of comparative units, five each for time division types and five for the rock record types.) Dating standards Global Standard Stratigraphic Ages (GSSAs) are defined by the International Commission on Stratigraphy and are used primarily for time-dating rock layers older than 630 million years ago (mya), before a good fossil record exists. For more recent periods, a Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP), largely based on research progress in geobiology and improved methods of fossil dating is used to define such boundaries. In contrast to GSSAs, GSSPs are based on important events and transitions within a particular stratigraphic section. In older sections, there is insufficient fossil record or well preserved sections to identify the key events necessary for a GSSP so GSSAs are defined based on fixed dates. Etymology Eonothem derives from eon, “age”, a Latin transliteration from the koine Greek word (ho aion) from the archaic (aiwon), and thema, \\"that which is placed or laid down\\", \\"subject of a discourse\\".

The measure is also widely used in archaeology for the reconstruction of past diets, particularly to see if marine foods or certain types of plants were consumed The definition is, in per mil: :\\\\delta \\\\ce{^{13}C} = \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\left( \\\\frac\\\\ce{^{13}C}\\\\ce{^{12}C} \\\\right)_\\\\mathrm{sample}}{\\\\left( \\\\frac\\\\ce{^{13}C}\\\\ce{^{12}C} \\\\right)_\\\\mathrm{standard}} - 1 \\\\right) \\\\times 1000 ‰ where the standard is an established reference material. δ13C varies in time as a function of productivity, the signature of the inorganic source, organic carbon burial, and vegetation type. Biological processes preferentially take up the lower mass isotope through kinetic fractionation. However some abiotic processes do the same, methane from hydrothermal vents can be depleted by up to 50%.McDermott, J.M., Seewald, J.S., German, C.R. and Sylva, S.P., 2015. Pathways for abiotic organic synthesis at submarine hydrothermal fields. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 112(25), pp.7668–7672. Reference standard The standard established for carbon-13 work was the Pee Dee Belemnite (PDB) and was based on a Cretaceous marine fossil, Belemnitella americana, which was from the Peedee Formation in South Carolina. This material had an anomalously high 13C:12C ratio (0.0112372), and was established as δ13C value of zero. Since the original PDB specimen is no longer available, its 13C:12C ratio can be back-calculated from a widely measured carbonate standard NBS-19, which has a δ13C value of +1.95‰. The 13C:12C ratio of NBS-19 was reported as 0.011078/0.988922=0.011202. Therefore, one could calculate the 13C:12C ratio of PDB derived from NBS-19 as 0.011202 / (1.95/1000 +1)= 0.011202/1.00195=0.01118. Note that this value differs from the widely used PDB 13C:12C ratio of 0.0112372 used by in isotope forensics and environmental scientists; this discrepancy was previously attributed by a wikipedia author to a sign error in the interconversion between standards, but no citation was provided. Use of the PDB standard gives most natural material a negative δ13C.http://www.uga.edu/sisbl/stable.html#calib Overview of Stable Isotope Research – The Stable Isotope/Soil Biology Laboratory of the University of Georgia Institute of Ecology A material with a ratio of 0.010743 for example would have a δ13C value of –44‰ from (0.010743 \\\\div 0.01124 - 1) \\\\times 1000. The standards are used for verifying the accuracy of mass spectroscopy; as isotope studies became more common, the demand for the standard exhausted the supply. Other standards calibrated to the same ratio, including one known as VPDB (for \\"Vienna PDB\\"), have replaced the original.Miller & Wheeler, Biological Oceanography, p. 186. The 13C:12C ratio for VPDB, which the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) defines as δ13C value of zero is 0.01123720.www- pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/te_825_prn.pdf Causes of δ13C variations Methane has a very light δ13C signature: biogenic methane of −60‰, thermogenic methane −40‰. The release of large amounts of methane clathrate can impact on global δ13C values, as at the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum. More commonly, the ratio is affected by variations in primary productivity and organic burial. Organisms preferentially take up light 12C, and have a δ13C signature of about −25‰, depending on their metabolic pathway. Therefore, an increase in δ13C in marine fossils is indicative of an increase in the abundance of vegetation. An increase in primary productivity causes a corresponding rise in δ13C values as more 12C is locked up in plants. This signal is also a function of the amount of carbon burial; when organic carbon is buried, more 12C is locked out of the system in sediments than the background ratio.  Geologic significance of δ13C excursions  C3 and C4 plants have different signatures, allowing the abundance of C4 grasses to be detected through time in the δ13C record. Whereas plants have a δ13C of −16 to −10‰, plants have a δ13C of −33 to −24‰. Mass extinctions are often marked by a negative δ13C anomaly thought to represent a decrease in primary productivity and release of plant-based carbon. The evolution of large land plants in the late Devonian led to increased organic carbon burial and consequently a rise in δ13C.http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/impact2000/pdf/3072.pdf See also  Isotopic signature * Isotope analysis * Isotope geochemistry * Isotopic labeling References Further reading * * Mook, W.

History  The church was formed in 1822 under the leadership of a layman from Nashville, H. R. W. Hill. The church's first building was located behind the town courthouse, on the public square. Later, due to the planned coming of the railroad, land was purchased at the present location, in 1847, for the construction of the current building, which was opened late that year. Notable members of the congregation in the early years were Elbert F. Sevier, a grandson of Governor John Sevier; Parson William Gannaway Brownlow (later governor of Tennessee during Reconstruction); and Elijah Embree Hoss (who became a bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South). The building was tied up in a legal battle immediately following the Civil War, as members loyal to either side of that political battle tried to gain control of the property. The property issue was settled in 1869, as recorded in the Washington County Court records. Major renovations were made in 1945 and 1959.

Crimean People's Republic was the first Turkic and Muslim democratic republic in the world. In its founding, the Crimean People's Republic was one of many short-lived attempts to create new states after the Russian Revolution of 1917 had caused the Russian Empire to collapse. Brief history Establishment The Crimean People's Republic was declared by the initiative of the Qurultay of Crimean Tatars, 89 років від проголошення у Бахчисараї Кримської Народної Республіки, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (13 December 2006) which stipulated the equality of all ethnicities within the peninsula; the largest proportion of people living in the Crimea at the time were Russian (then comprising 42% of the population of the Crimea) or Ukrainian (11%). However, Crimean Tatars were for a while the dominant political and cultural force on the peninsula. Noman Çelebicihan was the first President of the nascent Republic. The Qurultay consisted of 76 delegates, four of whom were female (Şefika Gasprinskaya, Anife Bоdaninskaya, Ilhan Tohtar, Hatice Avcı). The delegates were chosen from five counties: Yalta (24), Akmescit (19), Kefe (16), Kezlev (11), and Orkapy (6). The Qurultay elected as chairman the Crimean writer Asan Sabri Aivazov. The Qurultay in opposition to the Bolsheviks published a \\"Crimean Tatar Basic Law\\", which convened an All-Crimean Constitutional Assembly, established a Board of Directors as a provisional government, and erected a Council of National Representatives as a provisional parliament. The Board of Directors and the Central Council of Ukraine both mutually recognized each other. Bolshevik coup d'etat This attempt to build a new nation was quickly defeated by the Bolshevik- and anarchist-dominated Black Sea Fleet. Already on December 16, 1917, the Bolsheviks captured Sevastopol where the headquarters of the Black Sea Fleet was located and dissolved the local council of deputies. The power in the city was transferred to the local revkom. The Bolsheviks were supported by some ships of the Black Sea Fleet. To defend itself, the Crimean government created a United Crimean Headquarters on December 19, 1917, that had at its disposal two cavalry and one infantry regiment of Crimean Tatars as well as some Ukrainian and Russian formations that amounted to some thousand people. Several armed incidents took place during January 1918. On January 14, 1918, the Bolsheviks captured Simferopol where they managed to arrest former President of Crimea (Head of Directorate) Noman Çelebicihan who had just resigned on January 4, 1918. He was transferred back to Sevastopol and interned until February 23, 1918, when he was shot without trial. The body of Çelebicihan was thrown into the sea. On the initiative of Çelebicihan on January 10, 1918, the Qurultay created a special commission that conducted talks with the Bolsheviks to stop the armed conflict in Crimea. By the end of January 1918, the Bolsheviks had captured the whole of Crimea and dissolved both the Qurultay as well as the Council of National Representatives. A mass terror engulfed the peninsula based on class struggle and ethnic cleansing. With Çelebicihan in the Reds' custody, another leader of the Crimean Tatars, Jafer Seidamet, managed to escape to the Caucasus across continental Ukraine. Many Crimean military formations retreated to the mountains. The government of Ukraine blockaded Crimea while trying to reestablish control over the Black Sea Fleet and the city of Sevastopol. Any Muslim supporting military formations on the way to Crimea was stopped. That, in turn, triggered a protest from the All-Russian Muslim military suro (council). Note that by the end of January 1918, the Ukrainian government itself was forced to declare war on the Russian SFSR due to the advancement of the Red Guard forces of Moscow and Petrograd into Ukraine without explicit notification. The Bolsheviks briefly established the Taurida Soviet Socialist Republic on Crimean territory in early 1918 before the area was overrun by forces of the Ukrainian People's Republic and the German Empire. Some officials of the National government such as Cafer Seydahmet Kırımer who managed to escape the Bolsheviks' terror sought political asylum in Kyiv and petitioned for military help from the advancing Ukrainian Army as well as the forces of the Central Powers. Government On December 28 the Qurultay had established a republican government (Hükümet). * Minister of Justice - Noman Çelebicihan (chairman) * Minister of Defense - Cafer Seydahmet Kırımer (also Minister of Foreign Affairs) * Minister of Education - Ahmet Özenbaşlı * Minister of Finance - Seyitcelil Hattat (also Minister of Foundation) * Minister of Religion - Ahmet Şükrü  See also  * Russian Civil War * Ukrainian–Soviet War Notes  References   External links  * Ivanets, A.

His brother, James M. McIntosh, served as a Confederate general until he was killed in the Battle of Pea Ridge. Birth and early years McIntosh was born at Fort Brooke (Tampa), Florida Territory, while his father was on active duty in the Army. He served as a midshipman in the United States Navy during the Mexican-American War, and resigned in 1850. Thereafter, McIntosh was in business in New Brunswick, New Jersey. Civil War service At the outbreak of the Civil War, he was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 2nd U.S. Cavalry. He was promoted to first lieutenant in April 1862 and served in the Seven Days Battles, and the Battle of Antietam, receiving promotion to major between the battles. McIntosh was commissioned colonel of the 3rd Pennsylvania Cavalry on November 15, 1862. In that role he rose to brigade command in the Cavalry Corps of the Army of the Potomac. He led his brigade in the campaign culminating in the Battle of Chancellorsville, winning plaudits from division commander Brig. Gen. William W. Averell. When Maj. Gen. Alfred Pleasonton reorganized the Cavalry Corps following the Battle of Brandy Station, McIntosh became a brigade commander in the second division led by Brig. Gen. David McM. Gregg. McIntosh was ill after Chancellorsville, but he was present when Gregg's division fought at the Battle of Gettysburg. He distinguished himself in the fight against J.E.B. Stuart on East Cavalry Field on July 3, 1863. When a Confederate attack led by Maj. Gen. Wade Hampton was at its height, McIntosh led some of his men in a flank attack on the attacking troopers.Longacre, The Cavalry at Gettysburg, p. 239. McIntosh was injured by a fall from a horse in September 1863; and, after recovering from his injury, he was on duty in the defenses of Washington, D.C., in XXII Corps until May 1864. McIntosh returned to the Army of the Potomac in time to be assigned a brigade in the third cavalry division of Brig. Gen. James H. Wilson during the Battle of the Wilderness. He continued in command in the operations of Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan, including the beginning of the latter's Shenandoah Valley Campaign. McIntosh lost a leg because of a wound he received at the Third Battle of Winchester on September 19, 1864. Later he received brevet promotions of the ranks of major general, U. S. Volunteers, brigadier general, U.S. Army (regular army), and major general, U.S. Army. He retired from the army in 1870. McIntosh died in New Brunswick. He is buried in the Elmwood Cemetery.

The name of this Melaka drugstore, 仁和堂 (which would be Ren He Tang in Pinyin) is transcribed as Yin Foh Tong which is quite likely Hakka The different varieties of Chinese have been transcribed into many other writing systems. General Chinese General Chinese is a diaphonemic orthography invented by Yuen Ren Chao to represent the pronunciations of all major varieties of Chinese simultaneously. It is \\"the most complete genuine Chinese diasystem yet published\\". It can also be used for the Korean, Japanese and Vietnamese pronunciations of Chinese characters, and challenges the claim that Chinese characters are required for interdialectal communication in written Chinese. General Chinese is not specifically a romanisation system, but two alternative systems. One uses Chinese characters phonetically, as a syllabary of 2082 glyphs, and the other is an alphabetic romanisation system with similar sound values and tone spellings to Gwoyeu Romatzyh. Guanhua zimu Guanhua zimu 官話字母, developed by Wang Zhao 王照 (1859–1933), was the first alphabetic writing system for Chinese developed by a Chinese person. This system was modeled on Japanese katakana, which he learned during a two-year stay in Japan, and consisted of letters that were based on components of Chinese characters. After returning to China in 1900, he taught his system in various parts of North China, but the government banned it in 1901. One of Wang's contemporaries, Lao Naixuan 勞乃宣 (1843–1921), later adapted guanhua zimu for use in two Wu dialects, those of Ningbo and Suzhou. In doing this, he raised the issue that was ultimately responsible for the failure of all alphabetic writing systems in China: the notion that people should be introduced to literacy in their own local dialects. Such a proposal would both challenge the unique position of the millenia-old writing system and create more than one literary language, destroying China's linguistic unity in both the historical and geographic senses. Because of this, there was strong opposition from the very beginning to proposals of this kind. Bopomofo Bopomofo symbols compared to Pinyin Wu Jingheng (who had developed a \\"beansprout alphabet\\") and Wang Zhao () (who had developed a Mandarin alphabet, Guanhua Zimu, in 1900)Hsia, T., China’s Language Reforms, Far Eastern Publications, Yale University, (New Haven), 1956. pg. 108 and Lu Zhuangzhang were part of the Commission on the Unification of Pronunciation (1912–1913), which developed the rudimentary Jiyin Zimu () system of Zhang Binglin into the Mandarin-specific phonetic system now known as Zhuyin Fuhao or Bopomofo, which was eventually proclaimed on 23 November 1918. The significant feature of Bopomofo is that it is composed entirely of \\"ruby characters\\" which can be written beside any Chinese text whether written vertically, right-to-left, or left-to-right.This is why Bopomofo is popular where Chinese characters are still written vertically, right-to-left, or left- to-right, such as in Taiwan. The characters within the Bopomofo system are unique phonetic characters, and are not part of the Latin alphabet. In this way, it is not technically a form of romanisation, but because it is used for phonetic transcription the alphabet is often grouped with the romanisation systems. Taiwanese kana Taiwanese kana is a katakana-based writing system once used to write Holo Taiwanese, when Taiwan was ruled by Japan. It functioned as a phonetic guide to Chinese characters, much like furigana in Japanese or Bopomofo. There were similar systems for other languages in Taiwan as well, including Hakka and Formosan languages. Phags-pa script The Phags-pa script was an alphabet designed by the Tibetan Lama Zhogoin Qoigyai Pagba (Drogön Chögyal Phagpa) for Yuan emperor Kublai Khan, as a unified script for the literary languages of the Yuan Dynasty. The Phags-pa script has helped reconstruct the pronunciation of pre-modern forms of Chinese but it totally ignores tone. Manchu alphabet The Manchu alphabet was used to write Chinese in the Qing dynasty. Mongolian alphabet In Inner Mongolia the Mongolian alphabet is used to transliterate Chinese. Xiao'erjing Xiao'erjing is a system for transcribing Chinese using the Arabic alphabet. It is used on occasion by many ethnic minorities who adhere to the Islamic faith in China (mostly the Hui, but also the Dongxiang, and the Salar), and formerly by their Dungan descendants in Central Asia. Soviet writing reforms forced the Dungan to replace Xiao'erjing with a Roman alphabet and later a Cyrillic alphabet, which they continue to use up until today. Romanisation There have been many systems of romanisation throughout history. However, Hanyu Pinyin has become the international standard since 1982. Other well-known systems include Wade-Giles and Yale. Cyrillisation The Russian system for Cyrillisation of Chinese is the Palladius system. The Dungan language (a variety of Mandarin used by the Dungan people) was once written in the Latin script but now employs Cyrillic. Some people use the Cyrillic alphabet instead of the Latin alphabet to shorten pinyin (Ex.是 (Shì ш)) Cyrillic-using countries other than Russia use different systems. Braille A number of braille transcriptions have been developed for Chinese. In mainland China, traditional Mainland Chinese Braille and Two-Cell Chinese Braille are used in parallel to transcribe Standard Chinese. Taiwanese Braille is used in Taiwan for Taiwanese Mandarin.Not for Taiwanese Hokkien, which commonly goes by the name \\"Taiwanese\\" In traditional Mainland Chinese Braille, consonants and basic finals conform to international braille, but additional finals form a semi- syllabary, as in bopomofo. Each syllable is written with up to three Braille cells, representing the initial, final and tone, respectively. In practice tone is generally omitted. In Two-Cell Chinese Braille, designed in the 1970s, each syllable is rendered with two braille characters. The first combines the initial and medial; the second the rhyme and tone. The base letters represent the initial and rhyme; these are modified with diacritics for the medial and tone. Like traditional Mainland Chinese Braille, Taiwanese Braille is a semi- syllabary. Although based marginally on international braille, the majority of consonants have been reassigned.Only p m d n g c a e ê ü (from p m d n k j ä è dropped-e ü) approximate the French norm.

He was selected by the Chicago Blackhawks in the 2003 NHL Entry Draft and has played in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the Ottawa Senators. He has most recently played for the Orlando Solar Bears of the ECHL on a contract with the Houston Aeros of the AHL. Playing career Brodeur had a breakout AHL campaign with the Rochester Americans in 2008-09, when he posted an 18-13-4 record with a 2.45 goals against average and .921 save percentage, all career bests. Brodeur signed a one-year contract with the NHL Ottawa Senators during the summer of 2009, but at training camp, Brodeur was returned to the AHL, assigned to the Binghamton Senators. Brodeur was recalled to Ottawa on November 24, 2009, after an injury to Senators' starting goaltender Pascal Leclaire. He made his NHL debut on December 19, 2009, against the Minnesota Wild, stopping 22 shots and backstopping Ottawa to a 4-1 win. He was returned to Binghamton afterwards. On January 14, 2010, Brodeur was called up from Binghamton only hours before the opening faceoff for the Ottawa Senators. Brodeur made 32 stops for a 2-0 shutout of the New York Rangers in only his second ever NHL game. Brodeur finished his NHL career appearing in 7 games over two seasons, with a record of 3 wins and 1 loss. On March 15, 2012, Brodeur signed with the Las Vegas Wranglers of the ECHL. March 23 was his first full game in more than a year following offseason hip surgery. He lost that game to the Idaho Steelheads, 3-2, in a shootout. Personal information Brodeur is married. He is a distant relative of former New Jersey Devils goaltender Martin Brodeur. He lost his home in the Alberta 2016 Fort McMurray wildfire forest fire near Fort McMurray in May 2016.http://www.ottawasun.com/2016/05/11/ex-ottawa-senators-goalie-mike- brodeur-finds-silver-lining-after-losing-home-in-fort-mcmurray-fires References External links * * Category:1983 births Category:Augusta Lynx players Category:Binghamton Senators players Category:Camrose Kodiaks players Category:Canadian ice hockey goaltenders Category:Chicago Blackhawks draft picks Category:Elmira Jackals (ECHL) players Category:Greenville Grrrowl players Category:Houston Aeros (1994–2013) players Category:Sportspeople from Calgary Category:Las Vegas Wranglers players Category:Living people Category:Moose Jaw Warriors players Category:Norfolk Admirals players Category:Orlando Solar Bears (ECHL) players Category:Ottawa Senators players Category:Pensacola Ice Pilots players Category:Rochester Americans players Category:Rockford IceHogs (AHL) players Category:Toledo Storm players Category:Ice hockey people from Alberta Category:Canadian expatriate ice hockey players in the United States ","title":"Mike Brodeur"},{"id":"17737546","text":"Harry Hemley Plaskett FRS (July 5, 1893 – January 26, 1980) was a Canadian astronomer who made significant contributions to the fields of solar physics, astronomical spectroscopy and spectrophotometry. From 1932 to 1960, he served as the Savilian Professor of Astronomy at the University of Oxford, and in 1963 was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society.  Life  Harry Hemley Plaskett was born in Toronto, Ontario on July 5, 1893. His parents were Rebecca Hemley and John Stanley Plaskett, who at the time was working as a machinist in the Department of Physics at the University of Toronto, but who would later go on to become the first director of the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in Victoria, and a Gold Medal winner in his own right. After receiving his B.A. from Toronto in 1916, he joined the Canadian Corps, serving in the field artillery in France from 1917-1918. Following this, and a year spent working with Professor Alfred Fowler at Imperial College, he returned to Canada, and was appointed to the staff of the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in Victoria, B.C. In 1928, he was appointed Professor of Astrophysics at Harvard University, and in 1932 succeeded H. H. Turner as Savilian Professor of Astronomy at the University of Oxford. In May, 1936 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. He was president of the Royal Astronomical Society just after World War II. His time at Oxford was interrupted by war service: from 1939 to 1940, he was an anti-aircraft officer, and from 1940 to 1944 he worked on experimental navigation for the Ministry of Aircraft Production. From 1951 to 1955 he worked alongside Walter Stibbs.http://www.rse.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/stibbs_vmh.pdf He retired from Oxford in 1960, becoming a Professor Emeritus of the university, but remained active in astronomical research almost until the end of his life. Family He had married in 1921 Edith Alice Smith, with whom he had two children, Barbara and John Stanley. They were to remain married until his death in 1980.  Honors  The asteroid 2905 Plaskett, discovered by Edward Bowell in 1982, was named in his and his father's memory.

The 2008 Atlantic hurricane season was an event in the annual tropical cyclone season in the north Atlantic Ocean. An above-average Atlantic hurricane season season, it was the fourth most active season on record and the first to feature a major hurricane in every month from July to November. The season officially began on June 1, 2008, and ended on November 30, 2008, dates that conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones develop in the Atlantic basin. The season's first storm, Tropical Storm Arthur, formed on May 30, and the last, Hurricane Paloma, dissipated on November 10\\\\. Pre-season forecasts noted a high possibility for an above average number of tropical cyclones, primarily due to lingering La Niña effects and abnormally warm sea surface temperatures across the Atlantic basin. Altogether, 16 of the 17 tropical cyclones observed during the season developed into tropical storms. Of these, eight became hurricanes with five intensifying further into major hurricanes. With the exception of Tropical Storm Nana, every tropical cyclone during the season affected land to an extent. This timeline documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipations during the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season. It includes information that was not operationally released, meaning that information from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as a storm that was not operationally warned upon, has been included.

By 1887 a community of Baháʼí refugees from religious violence in Persia had made a religious center in Ashgabat. Shortly afterwards -- by 1894 -- Russia made Turkmenistan part of the Russian Empire. While the Baháʼí Faith spread across the Russian Empire and attracted the attention of scholars and artists, the Baháʼí community in Ashgabat built the first Baháʼí House of Worship, elected one of the first Baháʼí local administrative institutions and was a center of scholarship. During the Soviet period religious persecution made the Baháʼí community almost disappear -- however, Baháʼís who moved into the regions in the 1950s did identify individuals still adhering to the religion. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in late 1991, Baháʼí communities and their administrative bodies started to develop across the nations of the former Soviet Union; In 1994 Turkmenistan elected its own National Spiritual Assembly however, laws passed in 1995 in Turkmenistan required 500 adult religious adherents in each locality for registration and no Baháʼí community in Turkmenistan could meet this requirement. As of 2007 the religion had still failed to reach the minimum number of adherents to register and individuals have had their homes raided for Baháʼí literature. History in the region  Community of Ashgabat The first Baháʼí House of Worship was built in Ashgabat. The Baháʼí community of Ashgabat (also spelled ʻIshqábád, Ashkhabad) was founded in about 1884, mostly from religious refugees from Persia. One of the most prominent members of the community was Mirza Abu'l-Faḍl Gulpaygani, an Apostle of Baháʼu'lláh, who lived in Ashgabat off and on from 1889 to 1894. A short time after moving there, the assassination of one of the Baháʼís there, Haji Muhammad Rida Isfahani occurred and Gulpaygani helped the Baháʼí community to respond to this event and later he was the spokesman for the Baháʼís at the trial of the assassins. This event established the independence of the Baháʼí Faith from Islam both for the Russian government and for the people of Ashgabat. Under the protection and freedom given by the Russian authorities, the number of Baháʼís in the community rose to 4,000 (1,000 children) by 1918 and for the first time anywhere in the world a true Baháʼí community was established, with its own hospitals, schools, workshops, newspapers, cemetery, and House of Worship. The city population was between 44 and 50 thousand at this time. This first Baháʼí House of Worship was constructed inside the city of Ashgabat. The design of the building was started in 1902, and the construction was completed in 1908; it was supervised by Vakílu'd-Dawlih, another Apostle of Baháʼu'lláh. The House of Worship in Ashgabat has been the only Baháʼí House of Worship thus far to have the humanitarian subsidiaries associated with the institution built alongside it. Community of Merv The city of Merv (also spelled Marv, Mary) had a Baháʼí community, while it was far smaller and less developed. The Baháʼí community in the city received permission to build a House of Worship which they did on a smaller scale. Soviet period By the time the effects of the October Revolution began to spread across the Russian Empire transforming it into the Soviet Union, Baháʼís had spread east through Central Asia and Caucasus, and also north into Moscow, Leningrad, Tbilisi and Kazan with the community of Ashgabat alone numbering about 3000 adults. After the October Revolution the Ashgabat Baháʼí community was progressively severed from the rest of the worldwide Baháʼí community. In 1924 Baháʼís in Merv had schools and a special committee for the advancement of women. Initially the religion still grew in organization when the election of the regional National Assembly of the Baháʼís of the Caucasus and Turkistan in 1925. However, the Baháʼí House of Worship was expropriated by the Soviet authorities in 1928, the Baháʼí schools had been closed in 1930, and the House of Worship was leased back to the Baháʼís until 1938 when it was fully secularized by the communist government and turned into an art gallery. The records of events shows an increasing hostility to the Baháʼís between 1928 and 1938. From 1928 free rent was set for five years, and the Baháʼís were asked to make certain repairs, which they did. But in 1933, before the five-year rent agreement expired the government suddenly decided expensive renovations would be required. These unexpected requirements were accomplished, but in 1934 complaints about the condition of the building were again laid. Inquires from abroad silenced the complaints. In 1936 escalated demands were made beyond the resources of the local community. The Baháʼís of Turkistan and the Caucasus rallied and were able to sustain the construction requested. Then the government made moves to confiscate the main gardens of the property to provide for a playground of a school (the school itself being confiscated from the Baháʼís originally) which would wall off the grounds from the Baháʼís -- leaving only an entrance to the temple through a side entrance rather than the main entrance facing the front of the property. Protests lead to the abandonment of this plan; then in 1938 all pretexts came to an end. The 1948 Ashgabat earthquake seriously damaged the building and rendered it unsafe; the heavy rains of the following years weakened the structure. It was demolished in 1963 and the site converted into a public park. With the Soviet ban on religion, the Baháʼís, strictly adhering to their principle of obedience to legal government, abandoned its administration and its properties were nationalized. By 1938, with the NKVD (Soviet secret police) and the policy of religious oppression most Baháʼís were sent to prisons and camps or abroad; Baháʼí communities in 38 cities ceased to exist. In the case of Ashgabat, Baháʼí sources indicate on 5 February the members of the assembly, leaders of the community and some general members of the community to a total of 500 people were arrested, homes were searched and all records and literature were confiscated (claiming they were working for the advantage of foreigners), and sometimes forced to dig their own graves as part of the interrogation. It is believed one woman set fire to herself and died later in a hospital. The women and children were largely exiled to Iran. In 1953 Baháʼís started to move to the Soviet Republics in Asia, after the head of the religion at the time, Shoghi Effendi, initiated a plan called the Ten Year Crusade. The Baháʼís who moved to Turkmenistan found some individual Baháʼís living there though the religion remained unorganized. During the 1978-9 civil war in Afghanistan some Baháʼís fled to Turkmenistan. Map of Turkmenistan The first Baháʼí Local Spiritual Assembly in the Soviet Union was elected in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan, when conditions permitted it in 1989; 61 Baháʼís were listed as eligible for election. The Local Spiritual Assembly was officially registered by the city council of Ashgabat on 31 January 1990. Through the rest of 1990 several Local Spiritual Assemblies formed across the Soviet Union including Moscow, Ulan- Ude, Kazan, Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, Leningrad, and Murmansk. In September 1990, 26 Baha'is gathered together for the election of the first Local Spiritual Assembly of Merv. By September 1991, there were some 800 known Baha'is and 23 Local Spiritual Assemblies across the dissolving Soviet Union, while in Turkmenistan there were about 125 Baháʼís with two Local Assemblies and two groups (in Balakhanih and Bayranali). When the National Spiritual Assembly of the Soviet Union was dissolved in 1992, a regional National Spiritual Assembly for the whole of Central Asia (Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Kirgizia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan) was formed with its seat in Ashgabat. Most of these countries went on to form their own National Spiritual Assembly, and their communities went on to flourish (see Baháʼí Faith in Kazakhstan.) Banned community Since its inception, the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development -- beginning by giving greater freedom to women. promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern, That involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Baháʼís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Baháʼí teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities where they lived. World-wide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Baháʼí socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. As the environment of Perestroika took hold across the Soviet Block, the Baháʼí community of Ashgabat was the first to re-form its Local Spiritual Assembly following the oppressive decades of Soviet rule, had doubled its numbers from 1989 to 1991, and had successfully registered with the city government of Ashgabat. However, the nation of Turkmenistan revised its religious registration laws such that, in 1995, 500 adult religious adherent citizens were required in each locality for a religious community to be registered. Thus by 1997 the Baháʼís were unregistered by the government along with several other religious communities. More than just being unable to form administrative institutions, own properties like temples, and publish literature, perform scholarly work and community service projects -- their membership in a religion is simply unrecognized: The religion is considered banned, and homes are raided for Baháʼí literature. As of 2007, under these harsh conditions, the Baháʼí community in Turkmenistan was unable to reach the required number of adult believers to be recognized by the government as a religion. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 1000 Baháʼís across Turkmenistan in 2005.

As an actress she is most notable for her portrayal of Guinevere in Robert Bresson's film Lancelot du lac (1974). She grew up in France in the artistic and film-making milieu of her mother who struggled with mental distress. Her parents separated in 1960 and she and her brother went with her father. She married Laurent Condominas, a model and photographer, linked to the \\"Zanzibar Films\\" collective of avant garde French film-makers, known as the \\"Dandies of May 1968\\". The group were financed until 1970 by Sylvina Boissonnas, a French heiress with an interest in film production, and he appeared in Patrick Deval's film Acéphale (Headless) (1969) which followed a young man wandering through the aftermath of ’68 Paris. A daughter, Bloum, was born to them in 1971 in Bali, Indonesia. Bresson had been planning a film of the grail legend for a long period. His original choice to play Guenièvre twenty years previously had been Niki de St. Phalle, Laura's mother, but the project was delayed again and again. His final selection of Laura came about by coincidence when he came across a photograph of her with no prior information about who she was or that she was in fact the daughter of his first choiceThe Rattle of Armor, the Softness of Flesh: Bresson’s Lancelot du Lac, by Jonathan Rosenbaum in the Summer 1974 issue of Sight and Sound https://www.jonathanrosenbaum.net/2018/12/21315/.

Laura Duke later appeared in her mother's film Un rêve plus long que la nuit (1976) with Laurent, and a bit part in La Nuit porte-jarretelles (1985) a film by Virginie Thévenet. In 2008-2009, Duke hosted several key production meetings for the full-dome film Maya Skies. During this time, she began to develop The Curved Blackboard, a STEAM arts immersion outreach program, intended to benefit at-risk youth in the San Francisco Bay Area.

It is located in Millennium Park, which is a park built to celebrate the third millennium and which is located within the Loop community area of Chicago, Illinois in the United States. The sculpture and the plaza are sometimes jointly referred to as Cloud Gate on the AT&T; Plaza. It was opened in the summer of 2004 with the initial unveiling of the sculpture during the grand opening weekend of the park. Ameritech Corporation/SBC Communications Inc. donated US$3 million for the naming right to the space. The plaza has become a place to view the McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink and during the Christmas holiday season, the Plaza hosts Christmas caroling. Details A tent was erected on AT&T; Plaza to cover Cloud Gate while it was being polished. Lying between Lake Michigan to the east and the Loop to the west, Grant Park has been Chicago's front yard since the mid-19th century. Its northwest corner, north of Monroe Street and the Art Institute, east of Michigan Avenue, south of Randolph Street, and west of Columbus Drive, had been Illinois Central rail yards and parking lots until 1997, when it was made available for development by the city as Millennium Park. Today, Millennium Park trails only Navy Pier as a Chicago tourist attraction. The plaza is located above Park Grill, above and behind the McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink, adjacent to the Chase Promenade, and between the North and South Boeing Galleries. The plaza and sculpture sit atop the 300-seat $6 million Park Grill, which opened in November 2003 behind the McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink.Gilfoyle, p. 328. The surface of the plaza is concrete. The plaza is composed of of concrete pavers. Each paver is , and each is thick. History Pavers engraved with the Plaza's former name, SBC Plaza The plaza was originally named Ameritech Plaza for Ameritech Corporation, the corporate sponsor, who donated $3 million for the sculpture-hosting plaza's naming rights. By the time the park officially opened in 2004, Ameritech had merged with SBC Communications and the plaza was called SBC Plaza. When SBC acquired AT&T; and subsequently changed the name from SBC to AT&T; in 2005, the name of the plaza changed again. Cloud Gate was originally estimated to weigh because it was impossible to estimate the thickness of the steel compatible with the desired aesthetics.Gilfoyle, p. 165.Gilfoyle, p. 402. The final piece, however, weighs and care had to be taken in supporting it. The roof of the Park Grill, upon which Cloud Gate sits, had to be strong enough to bear the weight. A large retaining wall separating Chicago's Metra train tracks from the North Grant Park garage travels along the back side of the restaurant and supports much of the sculpture's weight. This wall, along with the rest of the garage's foundation, required additional bracing before the piece was erected. In June 2004, when construction of the shell began, a large tent (pictured left) was erected around the piece in order to shield it from public view. Activities In 2006, annual Christmas caroling began at the plaza. Following Thanksgiving, weekly sing-alongs are led by choral groups including Bella Voce, Chicago Mass Choir, and Chicago Children's Choir. Because of its elevation above the McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink, the plaza has become a prime viewing location for jazz concerts held during the summer at the McCormick Tribune Plaza. McCormick Tribune Plaza is located below and to the west of AT&T; Plaza as well as adjacent to Michigan Avenue's Historic Michigan Boulevard District, which are slightly further west.

Built in Redditch, the unusual engine layout was similar to that of a car. The engine was a longitudinally mounted inline vertical OHC 500 cc twin based on an experimental 1932 BSA design (the Line-Ahead-Twin - LAT) with coil ignition and wet sump lubrication which, through a dry clutch, drove a shaft drive to the rear wheel. The inline engine made this technologically feasible—horizontally-opposed (\\"flat\\") twin engines on BMW motorcycles had already used shaft drives following the system employed by the four cylinder Nimbus since 1918. The early S7 was expensive and over engineered, which is why it is now the most sought-after and commands a premium over the S7 De Luxe and the S8, which were produced with fewer features to reduce costs, while retaining many of the innovative parts of the early Sunbeam and updating some ideas. Models 1950 Sunbeam S7 A mildly customised Sunbeam S7 motorcycle. Three models were produced, the S7, S7 \\"de luxe\\" and the S8. All three were very expensive with only modest performance resulting in low sales. The original model was the S7 (the \\"Tourer\\") (2,104 produced from 1946 to 1948), in 1949 the S7 was updated to become the S7 de luxe (5,554 produced) and the S8 (8,530 produced). Both had new cylinder linings, redesigned frames and increased oil capacity. The lighter S8 was sold as a \\"sportier\\" model with a top speed of . It also had new (BSA) forks, a cast aluminium silencer and chromed wheels (with narrower tyres to replace the 'balloon' tyres which had led to uncertain handling at speed). S9 and S10 models were planned but never made as BSA decided to concentrate on the more traditional twins. Another \\"sports\\" model was also tested but never put into production. This had a much higher compression ratio with a different OHC design but was never sold, reputedly because of the undampened front fork system which affected handling. There were also trials with a rigid version for a cheaper model but this design was also abandoned. Mist Green S7 with characteristic balloon tyres S7 Honda Collection Hall, Motegi, Japan The original S7 was produced in black. The S7 de luxe came in either \\"Mist Green\\" or black and the S8 in \\"Silver Grey\\" or black. For export abroad BSA would supply Sunbeams in any BSA colour. Design problems Erling Poppe’s design was originally based on a captured BMW R75 but so soon after the end of the war BSA did not want the S series to look too \\"German\\", so an in-line OHC parallel twin was designed instead of a flat twin \\"across the frame\\". Serious problems with vibration made the new Sunbeam bikes uncomfortable to ride and the initial production originally sent to South Africa was recalled. The excessive vibration was cured by mounting the engine on two bonded rubber engine mounts. The in-line engine was inherently suitable for shaft drive, and BMW-style bevel gears would have been ideal. However, having inherited some worm-gear machinery from the Lanchester Motor Company, BSA opted to specify worm drive rather than bevel gears. Reputedly this created problems with the shaft drive, as the gears tended to strip under power.Stewart Engineering's Guide to the Sunbeam S7 & S8 It is said that Sunbeam's \\"solution\\" to this was to reduce the power to , which did nothing to help post-war sales. Owners clubs 1947 S7 at the National Motorcycle Museum (UK). The Sunbeam Motor Cycle Club is one of the longest established in the UK and was founded in July 1924 at the London showrooms of John Marston Ltd in Holborn Viaduct who made the Sunbeam motorcycles in their factory at Wolverhampton. The Sunbeam Motor Cycle Club is, however, a sporting motorcycle club that organises trials and vintage bike rallies and runs and the \\"owners section\\" was just a small part of it. When Sunbeam production ended BSA sold the remaining stock of parts to Stewart Engineering. Bob and Chines Stewart were longtime fans of the Sunbeam and for a time members of the Sunbeam Motorcycle Club. In 1963 they, along with other enthusiasts, broke away from the Sunbeam Motorcycle Club and formed the Sunbeam Owners Fellowship (SOF) to support owners of an S7 or S8 with any problems. A good number of Sunbeams motorcycles survive in perfect working order and many owners have been fellows of the SOF since its inception, having owned their Sunbeam since bought new or second hand in the 1960s. A web-based owners club has been created.

Life At an early age he entered the Order of St. Augustine. Soon after his ordination to the priesthood he became famous as a theologian and master of sacred eloquence. When his fame was at its zenith, he left Portugal and was appointed by the Duke of Savoy as chaplain and preacher to his court. He came to Rome by order of his superiors, and there took the degree of Doctor of Divinity. Coronel taught theology for many years in Rome. At this time the controversy, about the efficacy of divine grace and free will, between the Jesuits and Dominicans, was at its height. Pope Clement VIII established the Congregatio de Auxiliis to decide the points at issue, and Coronel was appointed by the pope to the position of secretary. He was continued in this office by Pope Clement's successor, Pope Paul V. As a reward for his services to the congregation, he was offered a bishopric, but he declined. He attended the general chapter of his order, held at Rome in 1620, as definitor of the Sardinian province. Works Coronel's principal works are: *\\"Libri decem de verâ Christi Ecclesiâ\\" (Rome, 1594); *\\"Libri sex de optimo reipublicæ statu\\" (Rome, 1597); *\\"De traditionibus apostolicis\\" (Rome, 1597).

He became known for his idyllic genre scenes of childhood. Biography Feeding the Rabbits, also known as Alice in Wonderland Morgan was born in London to John Morgan and his wife, Henrietta Hester Clare.1871 England Census His father was a successful genre artist sometimes known as 'Jury Morgan' (after one of his paintings The Gentlemen of the Jury). At the age of 14, he was taken out of school by his father who then tutored him in art. At the age of 16, while still studying with his father, his first picture, The Rehearsal, was exhibited at the Royal Academy, and, after a hiatus of several years, his paintings were shown there regularly. For a while he worked as a portrait artist for an Aylesbury photographer; this training proved to be crucial as it \\"taught him how to observe closely and to give the greatest attention to detail.\\" Eventually he turned to other subjects for his art, in particular idyllic genre scenes of country life and childhood. For many years, starting in 1874, Thomas Agnew & Sons' purchased all the work he produced. Over this period he painted some of his most popular works such as The Doll’s Tea Party (1874), Emigrants' Departure (1875) and School Belles (1877). Most of his painting was done in the village of Shere close to Guildford, a well-known retreat for artists. He also painted in Normandy, including Midday Rest (1879) and An Apple Gathering (1880). Although an excellent portrait artist, Morgan had problems in depicting pets and barnyard animals - he enlisted the aid of either Arthur John Elsley or Allen Sealey (1850–1927) when such problems needed resolving. He is known mostly for his romantic and sentimental paintings of children in the same style as his contemporary Arthur John Elsley. His paintings achieved great popularity in his lifetime and were widely published. He exhibited with the Royal Academy and was a member of the Royal Institute of Oil Painters (ROI). In 1872, he married another painter, Alice Mary Havers (1850–1890); they had three children. Their eldest son, Valentine, known as Val Havers, also developed into a painter. Frederick Morgan married twice more, producing two children from the second marriage. Morgan's paintings are exhibited at many art galleries and museums including the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool and the Russell-Cotes Museum in Bournemouth. His Turn Next was used to advertise Pears' Soap and is in the Lady Lever Art Gallery, Port Sunlight.

The opinions of the organization in regard to what are the proper limits of scientific exploration are often at odds with those of mainstream science. Critics argue that the SSE is devoted to disreputable ideas far outside the scientific mainstream. History The Society was founded in 1982. Its first meeting took place at the University of Maryland, College Park in 1982. Of the SSE and its journal, journalist Michael D. Lemonick writes, \\"Pretty much anything that might have shown up on The X-Files or in the National Enquirer shows up first here. But what also shows up is a surprising attitude of skepticism.\\" Activities Journal The society's magazine, the Journal of Scientific Exploration, was established to provide a scientific forum for ufology, parapsychology and cryptozoology, having published research articles, essays, book reviews and letters on those and many other topics that are largely ignored in mainstream journals. The journal is currently edited by parapsychologist and philosopher Stephen E. Braude. The Spirituality and Psychiatry Special Interest Group of the Royal College of Psychiatrists says that the journal has reports about anomalies in science, particularly in the parapsychological and extraterrestrial fields. Some academics have noted that the journal publishes on anomalous issues, topics often on the fringe of science. =Criticism= Kendrick Frazier, editor of Skeptical Inquirer and Committee for Skeptical Inquiry fellow, has suggested that: > The JSE, while presented as neutral and objective, appears to hold a hidden > agenda. They seem to be interested in promoting fringe topics as real > mysteries and they tend to ignore most evidence to the contrary. They > publish \\"scholarly\\" articles promoting the reality of dowsing, neo- > astrology, ESP, and psychokinesis. Most of the prominent and active members > are strong believers in the reality of such phenomena. Clinical community psychologist and professor of social psychology at the University of Connecticut Seth Kalichman regards the journal as a publisher of pseudoscience, with the journal serving as a \\"major outlet for UFOology, paranormal activity, extrasensory powers, alien abductions etc\\". Philosopher of science Noretta Koertge described the journal as an \\"attempt to institutionalize pseudoscience\\". Skeptic Robert Sheaffer writes that the SSE journal has published articles implying that certain topics, like paranormal activities, dowsing and reincarnation, are true and have been verified scientifically. The articles, often written in impressive jargon by scientists with impressive academic credentials, try to convince other scientists that further research into those topics is warranted; but, Sheaffer argues, those articles failed to convince the mainstream scientific community. Annual meeting The SSE holds an annual meeting in the US every spring and periodic meetings in Europe. In the US meeting, around a hundred of researchers who came to hear talks on, as journalist Michael Lemonick writes, \\"among other things, consciousness physics, astrology and parapsychology ... [M]any of the scientists here are on the faculty at major universities, and were doing fine at conventional research. But sometimes that gets boring.\\" According to experimental psychologist Roger D. Nelson, head of the Global Consciousness Project, the SSE aims to \\"give everyone a respectful hearing. If we think a speaker is doing bad science, we consider it our duty to criticize it. We get our share of lunatics, but they don't hang around long.\\" 1998 UFO panel On June 19, 1998 it was reported that \\"an international panel of scientists\\" was convened to conduct \\"the first independent review of UFO phenomena since 1966\\", according to the wording used by Associated Press. The Skeptical Inquirer published an article by Robert Sheaffer who wrote that the SSE was a non-mainstream organization that was biased towards uncritically believing UFO phenomena, that the panel included many scientists that were UFO advocates but no scientists that were skeptics of UFO claims, and that all the uphold cases were old cases that had failed to convince any skeptic of its accuracy or veracity. These included the Cash-Landrum incident, the Trans-en-Provence Case and the Aurora, Texas UFO Incident.

The Park lies within Lubusz Voivodeship: in Krosno Odrzańskie County (Gmina Krosno Odrzańskie, Gmina Bytnica), Świebodzin County (Gmina Skąpe) and Zielona Góra County (Gmina Czerwieńsk). It takes its name from the village of Gryżyna in Gmina Bytnica. Gryżyński Landscape Park is covered with forests in 86.6%, with surface waters in 6.6% and in 2.6% with pastures and meadows and marshy wasteland. The park is situated in the Warsaw-Berlin ice-marginal-valley and it constitutes a good example of postglacial relief with a great variety of postglacial forms such as vales, eskers and ravines, which contrast with sander plains around the park. The park is extended from the village Gryżyna in the north to the village Szklarka Radnicka in the south. It is 2-3 kilometers wide and 12.5 kilometers long and the vale of Gryżyna is its axis. The western vale constitutes the riverbed for Gryżyński Potok. This peat bog area is cut with ravines with steep slopes and huge amount of slope springs (there are nearly 100 between the villages Gryżyna and Grabin). In the south there are a few postglacial lakes and the biggest is the lake Jelito, which is 36.6 meters deep and covers the area of 49.9 hectares. To the east of the central and the western vales there are eskers, the kettle holes and kames with the dominant Border Mountain. In the beautiful landscape of the northern part of the park a 7,5- kilometre path of nature has been marked up with ten stands described by means of seventeen tables. The path is marked with the symbol of a green leaf. The stands relate to different topics: 1\\\\. The holiday camp “Dora” in Gryżyna 2\\\\. The watermill Strzelnik 3\\\\. The ravines with 60% inclination 4\\\\. The slope springs 5\\\\. The fen 6\\\\. The kame edge 7\\\\. The watermill Zaskórz 8\\\\. The esker inside the vale 9\\\\. The pond Bartno 10\\\\. The lake Kalek  The natural monuments  In the park there are 4 avenues of oaks and one tree - a pedunculate oak - protected in the form of natural monuments. The avenues are grouped in the area of Gryżyna village, they gather about 300 trees and with its longevity ( 150–200 years) and size (20 –25 metres high and 180-400 centimetres of circumference) they are considered an amazing natural phenomenon. Another natural monument is the deepest and the most beautiful ravine, which was created by water after the glacier had retreated. The western and central part of the ravine is covered by the beech forest. In the eastern part, on the peat bogs, black alders grow. The Rashes of Gryżyna cover 32,86 hectares and are located in the postglacial valley near the springs of Gryżyński Potok. The wet and inaccessible ground is the home for animals, particularly a biever, an otter and a crane. The Cranberry Marsh covers 2,81 hectares and is the habitat of the sundews, the mud sedge, the cranberry, the bog-rosemary and the white beat sedge. The park provides protection for the nests of a white-tailed eagle.  The flora of Gryżyński Landscape Park  Among trees of Gryżyński Landscape Park the following species can be found : pines, European and red beeches, oaks, alders and hornbeams. Common leptosporangiate ferns and umbellate wintergreen represent interesting and rare species in the park. There is also an old species wolf's-foot clubmoss. Among flowers there are : Carthusian Pink, Cheddar Pink, anemones, snowdrops, blue squills and liverworts. The wet meadows near Grabin are the habitat of a common foxglove and a wide range of orchids, for instance a military orchid. The peat bogs areas are covered with a mud sedge, the sundews, a cranberry and a bog-rosemary.  The fauna of Gryżyński Landscape Park  The diverse forms of postglacial relief serve as a shelter for plenty of animal species. The park is the habitat of a stag beetle. During June and July one can see the beetles in the near of oaks. Other insects are a European pine processionary and a moaning cloak – the biggest butterfly in Poland. A lot of places reveal the trace of beavers, which were introduced to the park in 1986. In the same places otters are found. Another mammals characteristic for the park are red and roe deer, a red fox, a wild boar, a raccoon dog, a European polecat, a beech marten and a European badger.

Overview Beinn Bhuidhe is a Munro that lies separately from the main body of the Arrochar Alps. It is an isolated mountain which, particularly when climbed in winter conditions, has a \\"real feeling of expedition about it\\". It is a remote and unfrequented hill, situated to the north of the head of Loch Fyne between the upper reaches of Glen Fyne and Glen Shira. It is the only high hill in an extensive tract of featureless moorland between the head of Loch Lomond and Loch Awe. Its long summit ridge has three tops, the summit being the south-western one. Beinn Bhuidhe is much quieter than the Arrochar Alps proper, due in part to the walk-in along a private road before starting the climb. Geography Beinn Bhuidhe is large mountain with three ridges shaped like the prongs of a trident. The longest ridge is the most southerly of the three and extends to Clachan Hill (). The shortest is the most northerly and runs to Beinn an t-Sidhein (). Between them lies the main ridge upon which the summit is located, which runs for from Tom a’ Phiobaire in the south-west to Ceann Garbh () in the north-east. The summit () is located approximately midway along this ridge. Ascents There are roads in both Glen Fyne and Glen Shira but Beinn Bhuidhe is mostly accessed from the former. There are good tracks giving access to the long south-west ridges, but the short and steep route running west-north-west from Inverchorachan House is the most popular.

Aims The six original specific aims were: # Satisfactory legislation on child assault; # Satisfactory legislation for the widowed mother; # Satisfactory legislation for the unmarried mother and her child; # Equal rights of guardianship for married parents; # Equal pay for teachers # Equal opportunities for men and women in the civil service. These later evolved into six general points of equality for women: political, occupational, moral, social, economic and legal. History The group was founded by Lady Rhondda in 1921 to press for changes in the law of the United Kingdom in six areas. The secretary from 1921 to 1926 was the ex-suffragette Winifred Mayo. During the 1920s, it was active in trying to have the League of Nations pass an Equal Rights Treaty. The group campaigned on principles of strict equality between men and women. This 'old feminism' or 'equality feminism' was sometimes contrasted to the 'new feminism' or 'welfare feminism' of other women's groups of the period, such as the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship, which sought protectionist legislation applying only to women. Members included former militant suffragists - such as Dorothy E. Evans, Florence Macfarlane, Monica Whately and Helen Archdale - as well as younger women like Winifred Holtby and Vera Brittain. Though the membership was usually under 300, the Six Point Group wielded considerable political influence in the interwar years and during the Second World War. It campaigned by traditional constitutional methods. Much of its work was done through its journal, Time and Tide. It also made deputations to the appropriate government ministers, organised public rallies and wrote letters to major newspapers. From 1933, along with the Open Door Council, it spearheaded the movement for the right of married women to work. It was responsible for establishing the Income Tax Reform Council and in 1938, the Married Women's Association. During the Second World War, the Six Point Group campaigned on a variety of issues. They protested about the fact that female volunteers in the Civil Defence Services received only two-thirds the men's pay. They objected that the compensation provided for by the Personal Injuries (Emergency Provisions) Act of 1939 was skewed between male / female recipients. They were closely involved in the Equal Compensation Campaign from 1941 to 1943 and subsequently had representatives alongside the Open Door Council and the Fawcett Society on the committee of the Equal Pay Campaign from 1944 to ensure equal pay in the Civil Service. The group continued to have significant political influence in the post war period. It took part in the protests to have the Matrimonial Proceedings and Property Act changed to give married women more financial protection. From 1967, the group played an active part in the co-ordination of other women's groups on a number of issues. Its secretary in the 1970s was Hazel Hunkins Hallinan. From the late 1970s the group declined through its failure to recruit younger women. It went into abeyance in 1980, and was finally dissolved in 1983.

The Aa (MS Cotton Cleopatra C. iv, around 1550) was first printed in Thomas Percy's fourth edition of Reliques of Ancient English Poetry, vol. I (1794), while the Ab (MS Harley 29) appeared in the first edition of Reliques (1765). (the above written and printed versions are the first known).

A single-engine, single-seat biplane intended to operate from the Royal Navy's aircraft carriers, it was not successful, with only three aircraft being built. Design and development In late 1920, Handley Page started design of a new single-seat torpedo bomber to meet the requirements of Air Ministry Specification 3/20 for a carrier-based aircraft to replace the Sopwith Cuckoo, in competition with the Blackburn Dart. The resulting design, the Type T, (later known as the H.P.19) and named the Hanley was a single- engine biplane of wooden construction. It, like the Dart, was powered by a Napier Lion engine and had a crew of one. It had folding three-bay wings which were fitted with full-span leading edge slots on both upper and lower wings in order to improve low-speed handling.Mason 1994, p.135-136. Three prototypes were ordered, the first of which (serialed N143) flew on 3 January 1922.Barnes 1976, p.219. Initial testing revealed that performance was disappointing with low speed handling, and that the view from the cockpit was also poor.Mason 1994, p.136. After being damaged in a crash landing, the first prototype was rebuilt with new wingtips, a revised two-bay wing and with the control cables for the elevators enclosed in the rear fuselage to reduce drag, flying in December 1922 as the Hanley Mark II. These changes improved performance, but handling was still poor. The third prototype was therefore fitted with revised slots, as well as the drag reduction changes tested on the Hanley Mark II, the revised aircraft being designated Hanley Mark III, demonstrating considerably improved handling.Barnes 1976, p.221-222. By the time that the Hanley Mark III was available for testing, the Dart, which was developed from Blackburn's earlier Swift, had already been ordered into service.

Life  Polo's father was also a clarinetist, and he learned to play from a young age, working in marching bands from age eight. Claude Thornhill played with Polo as a duo in his youth. In the 1920s, Polo played with Elmer Schoebel (1923), Merritt Brunies, Arnold Johnson, Ben Bernie, Jean Goldkette (1926), and Paul Ash. In 1927 he went with Dave Tough to Europe, where he played with several Continental bandleaders including Bert Firman, Lud Gluskin, George Carhart, Ben Berlin and Arthur Briggs. From 1930-1935 Polo played with Ambrose, then returned to the U.S. in December of that year. In 1938, Polo returned to Britain to play with Ambrose again, and worked with Ray Ventura in Paris in 1939. Late in 1939 he moved back to the U.S. for good, and spent the early 1940s working with Joe Sullivan, Jack Teagarden (1942, including on Bing Crosby's film Birth of the Blues), and Claude Thornhill again. He led his own Midwestern territory band for a time, then returned to play with Thornhill once more in 1947. While with Thornhill he became ill, and died rather suddenly in 1949. His gravestone gives his correct name as Pollo. He recorded two sessions as a leader (which include Alix Combelle), both in Europe, in 1938-39. Polo played in several experimental sessions with Miles Davis around 1947-1948. On July 11, 1949, Polo died in Chicago of hemorrhages that resulted from a peptic ulcer. He was 47.

It is the seat of the Archbishop of Cape Town. St. George's Cathedral is both the metropolitical church of the Anglican Church of Southern Africa and a congregation in the Diocese of Cape Town. The cathedral was designed by Sir Herbert Baker and the foundation stone was laid in 1901. The cathedral replaced a church built in 1834 on the same site, and is still incomplete.  History  St. George's Cathedral and St. George's Street in by Wilhelm Langschmidt (1845) In October 1827, the Bishop of Calcutta, on a visit to Cape Town which was, at the time, a distant outpost of his diocese, discussed the building of an Anglican church. Up until that time the Anglican community had used the Cape Town Castle for services, later being offered hospitality by the Groote Kerk. (In December 1819 missionaries Robert and Mary Moffat were married at \\"St Georges Church, Cape Town\\".) The colonial government donated a site at the lower end of the Dutch East India Company's gardens at the corner of Government Avenue and Wale Street and the bishop consecrated the land. The foundation stone was laid by Governor Sir Lowry Cole on St. George's day 23 April 1830 and at the same time Erste Berg Dwars Street was renamed St. George's Street. The church was built from drawings by the architect John Skirrow based on W & H Inwood's Neo-Greek St. Pancras' Church in London. Losing heavily on the deal, Hermann Schutte was the building contractor. The cathedral cost estimated £16,000 to build. On 21 December 1834 that St. George's Church opened for services. Upon diplomat Edmund Roberts visit in 1834, George Hough was chaplain and the church had a capacity of 1,000 people with 300 seats for the poor. Bishop Robert Gray In 1847, Robert Gray was ordained bishop of the newly created Diocese of Cape Town and he installed his cathedra (throne) in the church, by which act it became a cathedral even though it was only a modest parish church. His dream was to build a more worthy building on the site but his wishes never materialised during his episcopate which lasted until his death in 1872. The laying of the foundation stone in 1901. On the right are the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York (later to become King George V and Queen Mary). On 17 May 1874, William West Jones was ordained second bishop and metropolitan of Cape Town (almost 25 years later he was elevated to archbishop) and by 1887 the diocesan synod had appointed a committee to collect money for a new cathedral but it was not until 22 August 1901 that the Duke of Cornwall and York (later to become King George V) laid the foundation stone bearing the letters AMDG . Paradoxically, this is the only visible instance of these letters which are chiselled on the inward-facing surface of each and every stone in the cathedral, a custom dating from ancient times.Rev. John Charles Venus, Chaplain to St. George's Grammar School (1959-1965) The South-African War was still in progress at the time and as a result it was not until 1904 that work was resumed and the foundations were laid. In 1908 West Jones returned to England. By the time of his departure, the eastern end of the cathedral was well under way but he died two months later. It was decided that the new chapel on the north side should be built in his memory and it was completed and dedicated on 28 October 1909 in honour of St John the Baptist, the patron saint of St John's College, Oxford, of which William West Jones had been a fellow. Work continued slowly but it was not until 1930 that the memorial stone for the North transept was laid by the Earl of Athlone, then Governor-General of the Union of South Africa. The transept was completed in 1936 which finally made Sir Herbert Baker's design a reality. Provincial heritage site St George's Cathedral was declared a provincial heritage site by Heritage Western Cape on 23 September 2014 in the terms of Section 27 of the National Heritage Resources Act. This gives the site Grade II status and provides the site with protection under South African heritage law. The cathedral is renowned for the political stance it took during apartheid and is recognised as a strong symbol for democracy in South Africa. The heritage significance the building lies not just with the building itself but also the intangible heritage associated with the actions of different clergymen involved in the church which led to the church (as of 26 August 2001) being known as the \\"people's cathedral\\". Desmond Tutu, the first black archbishop of South Africa, led numerous marches and campaigns for the formal end of apartheid from the front steps of St George's cathedral. It was a common meeting point for all activists of all races as well as woman's rights groups who were part the resistance to apartheid laws and the struggle for social justice, equality and human rights. Architecture Bell tower and bells The original cathedral had a tower containing eight bells cast in 1834 by the firm Mears & Stainbank of Whitechapel in London. They were rung by \\"chiming\\", whereby the clappers were pulled by rope to strike against the lip of the hanging bell. Two old brass plaques on the walls in the bell tower indicate the existence of an active guild of bellringers in the early 1900s.Two old brass plaques on the walls in the bell tower When the original cathedral was demolished in the 1950s (see History) the bells were stored until a generous bequest by Mrs S K M Smith allowed them to be sent back to Mears & Stainbank where they were recast in 1963 into the ring of ten bells that we have today. The bells made the return journey to Cape Town only to languish in the cathedral car park for some time. Eventually they were hung in a new steel frame - still on the ground outside the cathedral. In this position they were manually chimed until the new belltower structure was completed. Finally, in 1979 they were installed properly and hung for change ringing in the traditional English way with ropes and wheels. The tower frame is built of reinforced concrete with a cladding of Table Mountain Sandstone. The smallest of the ten bells, referred to as the treble, weighs and the tenor, which is the largest, weighs in at a respectable . Its name, appropriate to its location on the southern tip of Africa, is \\"Good Hope\\". The bells were named by Joost de Blank, a former archbishop of Cape Town: *Joy *Love *Peace *Faith *Charity *Service *Patience *Sacrifice *Redemption *Good Hope Stained glass The central panel of the great west window is dominated by the figure of the triumphant black Christ. The right-hand panel of this work includes the figure of Mahatma Gandhi. The cathedral has stained glass windows, including fine Gabriel Loire windows. The most recent glass is his Christ in Triumph over Darkness and Evil in the great west window in memory of Earl Mountbatten. The centre light was erected in 1982; the two side panels on the left and right were added in 2001. On either side of the nave are eight Gabriel Loire windows on the theme of the creation. Over the south transept is the rose window and in the centre, Christ in Majesty, clothed in purple, the colour of the passion and, radiating outwards, cherubim and seraphim, the angels, and the apostles, prophets, martyrs and saints. Crypt The cathedral's crypt houses a jazz restaurant, and known as The Crypt. The Link This is an addition to the cathedral, the two stained glass windows set at the west end of the Link, are from the old cathedral, and this is the earliest glass in the cathedral, two set of eight windows done by Mayer of Munich for the old cathedral in 1886. On the right is depicted the Ascension, this is a memorial to Robert Gray, first bishop of Cape Town. The window on the left shows the Last Supper and is a memorial to a former churchwarden and trustee of the cathedral, Felton Matthew. If you look closely you will notice that there are only 11 disciples. The missing disciple is Judas Iscariot, as you might expect- he can be seen clutching his bag of silver. North aisle Before entering the aisle you will see a plaque, commemorating the visit to the cathedral of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip in March 1995. Pass the verger's office you will see four windows by Frank Spears. The first two above the office is dedicated to Michael Gibbs a former dean of Cape Town and shows the Nativity of Jesus. The other three are of the Crucifixion, Resurrection of Jesus and Ascension of Jesus and commemorate the Rackstraw family. Another memorial is in the form of a Latin inscription on the stonework at the end of the aisle. This is for the skilled master-mason, Neil Black, who was responsible for the north transept and aisle. He was a fine craftsman and modestly wished for no memorial. it is good to remember the man whose skill brought to reality Baker's design. In deference to his wishes and his fellow masons wanted a simple tribute, the inscription is not outlined and mellows with the stonework. North transept From the north aisle you come into the north transept, to your right is a carpeted platform on which the parish mass is celebrated on Sundays. The celebrant is in the body of the church not a distance at the high altar with his back to the congregation. Stand on the platform to view the great north window dedicated to the saints and the pioneers of the church in Africa. Executed by Francis Skeat, it was given by a Cape Town family in memory of their father. It was dedicated by Geoffrey Clayton in 1951. , it is the largest stained glass window in the Southern Hemisphere. The uppermost lights are taken by the arms of the diocese of the province. the top glass of the main glass shows from left to right St Augustine of Hippo, St Monica his mother, St Mark, Our Lord learning to walk in Egypt, Athanasius of Alexandria, St Catherine of Alexandria, and St. Cyprian of Carthage. Below are the modern pioneers and heroes of the continent from right to left, Charles Mackenzie, bishop of Nyasaland, Angela Burdett-Coutts who endowed the bishopric of Cape Town. Above is master mason Neil Black; the martyr, Bernard Mizeki who was confirmed in Cape Town, Sophy Gray, wife of the first bishop Of Cape Town. The three centre panels depict the Flight into Egypt. More stained glass is to be seen in the north transept, in the west wall are St Cyril of Jerusalem and St Antony of Egypt, the work of C.L. Grove a lecturer at the Michaelis School of Fine Art. Facing them are three windows. The first two on the left are by Edward Woore and show Robert Gray and Mother Cecile of Grahamstown, founder of the Community of the Resurrection of our Lord in Grahamstown. The third window is another by Gabriel Loire, it is said that Loire had the inspiration for the window when he looked across the Cape Flats at six o'clock one morning while visiting South Africa from his native France. The whole window is called Our Lady of Good Hope, the right light shows Saint Anne, mother of Mary, below her is Mary, mother of Jesus and then Christ in a shape of a chalice. the left light depicts the outline of the Cape Peninsula with its flora and fauna. At the top left is the Star of Good Hope and sweeping across the base of the window is an anchor. Loire put his patron saint, St Gabriel, in the tracery at the top. Rose window and south transept At the centre of the rose window is Christ in Majesty, clothed in purple the colour of the passion and around him a Greek inscription meaning Jesus Christ Triumphant. Around the central panel are ten lights like the petals of a rose, showing alternatively in red and blue seraphim and cherubim. These are the highest order of the angels all face inwards - with all the company of heaven we laud and magnify thy glorious name. The next group depicts angels flying from the periphery gorgeous in colour they sing out, 'To the all angels cry aloud. Around the perimeter of the window are twenty panels. If you think of the face of a clock, the section between 9 and 12 is the glorious company of the apostles from 12 to 3 the goodly fellowship of the prophets, between 3 and 6 the noble army of martyrs and lastly the saints of the Holy Church throughout the world. The window took Frank Spears two years to complete and cost £6,000 in the early 1930s. The three lancet windows below the rose window (from left) Hosea, King David and Isiah. Above them are St Peter, St John and Christ in the middle panel and Mary Magdalene at the empty tomb, respectively. Pulpit and lectern Both the pulpit and lectern are from the old cathedral and were presented in memory of the wreck of the mail ship SS Drummond Castle, which sank off Ushant on 16 June 1896. Sanctuary and high altar The high altar is of black marble, inlaid on the upper surface with five mosaic crosses brought from Jerusalem by Dean Charles Barnett-Clarke. Frank Spears' painting Descent from the Cross hangs on the north wall of the sanctuary. on the left of the altar is a simple wooden chair - the original throne (cathedra) of Robert Gray. It bears the bishop's arms and a small brass plaque inscribed in Latin: 'In this seat, Robert Our First Bishop and Metropolitan once sat'. There is another memorial to Robert Gray in the chancel, this is the archbishop's throne made from the choir screen of Westminster Abbey. Above the high altar is a suspended rood, at the foot of the crucified Christ are the Blessed Virgin Mary and St John. The floreated ends of the cross carry the signs of the four evangelists, St Matthew, St Mark, St Luke and St John. At the bottom of the rood is the figure of a pelican. There are four posts below with figures of angels. Lady chapel This quiet chapel is mainly used for private prayer, it was added in 1962. The stained glass is by Francis Spear, the two lights at the west end show the soldier saints, Martin of Tours and Saint Alban, the first English martyr. The circular window above the altar is a pietà - the Blessed Virgin with her crucified Son lying across her knees. Surrounding the central figures is a symbolic treatment of the burning bush of Moses, its stem shows as the tree of knowledge, with the lilies of the Virgin and the vine of the Eucharist above the red cross of sacrifice and triumph is superimposed on the whole. The silver lamp above the altar burns perpetually while the reserved sacrament is kept in the tabernacle on the altar. There is also a statue of the Virgin and Child. On the outside wall of the Lady Chapel is a stone carving of the Mother and Child by Sir Charles Wheeler. St David's Chapel This chapel is Situated to the right of the Sanctuary, as you enter you will see the Canterbury stone- a block of Caen stone used in the earliest Norman section of that Great Cathedral. The Chapel is one of the earliest parts of the Cathedral to be completed. The Bronze Crucifix affixed to it is a Model of am eighth Century brooch found over a century ago under a Canterbury street. The Chapel is a Memorial to all who died in the South African War (1899-1902). in addition it has a numerous associations with Wales, such as the Figure of Saint David, patron Saint of wales above the altar. The Stone altar was given by Sir Owen and Lady Phillips in Memory of Welshman who fell in the war. There is a Small Stained glass window of Saint David, another figure of Saint David is in bas-relief on the wall, this is in memory of Charles Nuemann Thomas a former organist of the Cathedral. on the Outer wall of the Chapel are two brilliant thick glass in modern Style by Leo Theron they Symbolize the Eucharist and Baptism There is a set of wrought-iron gates at the end of Saint David's Chapel, they were made by John Stevens and are a memorial to Archbishop John Russel St John The Baptist Chapel The Altar and the Painting in this Chapel Come from the old St George's. the Painting was a gift to the old cathedral in 1871 and is a copy of Vincenzo Foppa's Adoration of the Magi by Henry Duke. The paneled teak Reredos commemorates Archbishop William Marlborough Carter and bears his private arms and those of Eton and Pembroke College where he received his education. This Chapel is a memorial to Archbishop Jones and his Bronze effigy lies on an empty tomb on the south side. An inscription in gilt records the main events of his life and the words Lord I have loved the habitation of Thy house are a reminder that his devotion to St George's laid the foundations of the Cathedral. The windows in the chapel were donated by the West Jones Family and were installed in 1910 and 1911, they came from the studios of Kempe&Co.Ltd; and were the work of their chief designer John Lisle. The East Window above the altar has two lights and Depicts the Lord's commission to St Peter and to all Bishops as Shepherds of Souls and pastors of his flock. The words feed my sheep appear on a scroll above Christ's head and above the head of St Peter are the words Lord Thou Knowest that I love Thee The accent on St Peter derives from the fact that both Bishop Gray and Archbishop West Jones were consecrated in the Abbey Church of St. Peter, Westminster. The four Lancet windows in the north wall show the Bishops of African and English Sees i.e. St Athanasius, St Augustine of Hippo, St Augustine of Canterbury and William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury. Left on the altar is a tiny single light showing John.

Some people still don't realize that something like a quarter of all the cowboys back in the old West were black.\\" Injuries He is known for his many injuries as well. Sampson's left calf has 17 pins and two metal plates. In the New York Times Magazine, Sampson noted, \\"In 1983, a bull jerked me down and cracked my skull--I broke every bone in my face except my nose. I broke my ankle, my leg, my sternum, my wrist. In '88, I had an ear ripped off when a bull ran over me and his foot caught my hat.\\" He shattered his face in a riding accident in front of Ronald Reagan. His PRCA career lasted almost 20 years, with 11 National Finals Rodeo (NFR) trips.  Retirement  He retired at the National Circuit Finals Rodeo in Pocatello, Idaho, in 1994.

The six soloists play harp, cimbalom, vibraphone, glockenspiel/xylophone, and two pianos. It was premiered on 18 October 1981 at the Donaueschingen Festival. The composer expanded it until its completion in 1985. The work is dedicated to \\"on his 80th birthday\\". Répons was the first significant work to come out of Boulez's endeavors at IRCAM, an institute in Paris devoted to making technological advances in electronic music. It has been celebrated for its integration of the electronic and the acoustic. Its title, Répons, reflects the fact that the composition is constructed on various types of responses: the acoustic sounds and electronic responses to them as well as the medieval idea of responsorial mirroring between players and speakers in different parts of the concert hall.Paul Driver, \\"Review: Boulez's Répons\\", Tempo, New Series, no. 140 (March 1982): 27–28. Tom Service of The Guardian has called it \\"Boulez’s most ambitious masterpiece of electronic and acoustic fusion\\".  The music  Répons is subdivided into an Introduction, Sections 1–8 and a Coda. Of the use of metre and harmony in Répons Boulez said:Peter McCallum, \\"An Interview with Pierre Boulez\\", The Musical Times 130, no. 1751 (January 1989): 9–10. The pitches of the row used in Répons are those based on the Sacher hexachord and used in the rows for several other Boulez compositions: Messagesquisse, Dérive 1, Incises, and Sur Incises.Edward Campbell, Boulez, Music and Philosophy (Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press, 2000): 206. . Boulez selected the solo instruments, all pitched percussion, based on the ability of the computer equipment to \\"exploit their resonating characteristics to the limits of the technology available at the time\\".Peter O'Hagan, \\"Pierre Boulez and the Foundation of IRCAM\\", in French Music Since Berlioz, edited by Richard Langham Smith and Caroline Potter, 303–30 (Burlington, VT: Ashgate Publishers, Inc., 2006): 327 (accessed 18 January 2016): \\"These are clearly audible in performance, and Dominique Jameux, in an analysis of the piece in its 1982 version, characterizes them successively as 'Balinese', 'Funeral March', 'Rain Music', 'Finale' and 'Coda'. By the time of the 1984 Turin performance, Boulez had inserted two additional episodes between 'Finale' and 'Coda'.\\"  Performance history and reception  Acknowledging the difficulty the work presents for the soloists, Boulez said: \\"I like virtuosity, although not for the sake of virtuosity but because it’s dangerous\\". As of 2010, Répons had been performed \\"just a few dozen times\\".Michael Kimmelman, \\"Boulez’s Gentler Roar\\", New York Times (6 January 2010; accessed 18 January 2016). The work's performance requirements, its \\"extraordinary demands on the acoustic space as well as the players\\", have required untraditional venues or adaptations of concert spaces. For a performance at New York's Carnegie Hall, \\"[t]he stage will be extended to cover the entire parquet level, with musicians both within and surrounding the audience, and speakers issuing the electronics from the perimeter and above.\\"Matthias Kriesberg, \\"What's French About French Music?\\", New York Times (23 February 2003; accessed 18 January 2016). A 2015 performance in Amsterdam used as its venue an exhibition space created in the base of a gas tank built in 1902, and presented the work twice so that audience members could change their seats and hear the work a second time from a different location.Anon., \\"Répons\\", Holland Festival (accessed 18 January 2016). The work was commissioned by Southwest German Radio. The Ensemble InterContemporain conducted by Boulez presented the 1981 premiere in Donaueschingen of the original version's five sections lasting about twenty minutes. A 33-minute version was performed in London at the BBC Proms on 6 September 1982, and a forty-minute version containing seven sections in Turin in 1984.Andrew Gerzso, \\"Reflections on Répons\\", Contemporary Music Review 1 (October 1984): 23 (accessed 18 January 2016). Boulez conducted Ensemble InterContemporain in the New York premiere in the Columbia University Gymnasium on 5 March 1986, using his 1985 revision of the piece for 24 live musicians, six live soloists, and a digital processor 4X. In the New York Times Donal Henahan provided a negative assessment:Donal Henahan. \\"Concert: 'Répons', by Boulez\\", New York Times (6 March 1986; accessed 18 January 2016); Donal Henahan, \\"Strong Technology; Weak Music\\", New York Times (16 March 1986; accessed 18 January 2016). A 2003 performance in Carnegie Hall met with an enthusiastic reception, including \\"notable numbers of young people in bright T-shirts and scruffy jeans, who whooped and whistled after each work\\". In Anthony Tommasini's view, \\"audiences are ready for some challenges. The idea of Mr. Boulez's music may still seem intimidating, but the music itself is scintillating and restless. Yes, it's gritty and rigorous, but also sumptuous and fanciful\\". He described the work as a \\"breathless drama\\" and noted that \\"When the full ensemble played, the music moved in thickly layered, heaving gestures. Yet, remarkably, almost every tone and nuance was audible. And when the soloists entered, trading dizzying outbursts and ruminations–jazzy riffs from the xylophone, scurrying piano figurations–the sheer visceral excitement of being caught in the middle was like nothing else in music.\\"Anthony Tommasini, \\"Carnegie Transformed For a Burst of Boulez\\", New York Times (28 March 2003; accessed 18 January 2016. Alex Ross noted the performative aspect of the conductor's role at the center of the action: \\"Boulez managed to give precise cues back over his shoulder, his force field radiating three hundred and sixty degrees.\\"Alex Ross, \\"The Magus\\", The New Yorker (25 January 2016; accessed 18 January 2016). French Canadian Jean-Jacques Nattiez believes that Répons may become viewed as \\"one of the most significant works of the 20th century.\\"Peter McCallum, \\"An Interview with Pierre Boulez\\", The Musical Times 130, no. 1751 (January 1989): 8. Consistent with Boulez's compositions in general, one of the common praises of Répons is its internally consistent style.Alex Ross: The Rest Is Noise: The Godfather: Pierre Boulez The piece is also praised for its use of a wide variety of modern compositional resources, \\"including electronic manipulation, spatial acoustics, innovative coloring, and even a quasi-minimalist use of repetition.\\" Paul Griffiths compared Répons unfavorably to Boulez's Dialogue de l'ombre double. He found Répons \\"much more flamboyant\\" and wrote: \\"The opening is marvelous: the orchestra rushes about, looking for a way to start, or a way out, and then prepares for the grand entrance of the soloists. Some of the sounds are also fabulous: violins putting a whisker on rich, deep chimes, or electric zigzags of tone. But Dialogue, on the surface so severe, says more.\\"Paul Griffiths, \\"After the Fall of the New-Music Walls\\", New York Times (21 February 1999; accessed 18 January 2016). Recordings In 1996 Boulez conducted the Ensemble InterContemporain in a Deutsche Grammophon recording of this piece. Released in 1998, it won a Grammy in 2000 for best classical contemporary composition.Frank Hoffmann (ed.), \\"Boulez, Pierre (26 Mar 1925–)\\", Encyclopedia of Recorded Sound, second edition (New York: Routledge, 2004): vol. 1 (accessed 18 January 2016).

It is composed of eight separate tracts of land along the eastern slope of the Blue Ridge Mountains; four of these adjoin Shenandoah National Park, and combined they share of boundary. Elevations within the area range from above sea level. Much of the area was forested prior to being acquired by the state, although timber harvesting took place frequently. Most of the woods are hardwood, dominated by chestnut oak and tulip poplar; populations of sugar maple and yellow and black birch may be found in some of the higher and deeper areas. Some of the older timber nearly died from gypsy moth infestation before being salvaged in the late 1980s. Evidence of former human habitation, including old home sites, cemeteries, and rock piles, may still be found in the area. Three major waterways, the Rapidan, Conway, and South rivers, cross the property. These fast-moving streams and their tributaries support healthy populations of brook trout. Rapidan WMA is owned and maintained by the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries. The area is open to the public for hunting, trapping, fishing, hiking, horseback riding, and primitive camping. Access for persons 17 years of age or older requires a valid hunting or fishing permit, or a WMA access permit.  Hunting  The deer and turkey populations in the Rapidan area are moderate, but stable in numbers, providing quality hunting opportunities. Other animals that can be found in the area include grey squirrels, ruffed grouse and black bears. Woocock can also be found in some of the wetter sites and along the larger streams.  Fishing  The Rapidan Wildlife Management Area maintains an excellent native trout fishery. The area is home to healthy populations of brook trout and wild brown trout, which can be found in the Rapidan and Conway Rivers.

He was initially a layman in the Roman Catholic Church. On August 28, 1973, he founded St. Gregory's Church in Sayville, New York. Three months later, he was ordained to the priesthood by Robert R. Zaborowski, of the Archdiocese of the American Orthodox Catholic Church in the U.S. and Canada, later known as the Mariative Old Catholic Church. Raffaele's congregation drew a number of Catholic traditionalists who felt separated from the post-Vatican II Roman Catholic Church. The parish of St. Gregory's grew slowly, while Raffaele and his assistants, following the pattern of Old Catholic churches, continued to work at other jobs and spent their remaining time on the church. The parish would around this time move from Sayville to Shirley and later Ronkonkoma, New York. In the mid-1970s, Zaborowski declared that the churches in his jurisdiction would be obliged to follow the religious traditions of the Polish Roman Catholic church. Raffaele would not agree to do so, and he and the parish left the church, to be excommunicated from it by Zaborowski shortly thereafter. Raffaele and his church joined the Mount Athos Synod under Bishop Charles C. McCarthy, of the American Orthodox Catholic Church of Archbishop Patrick J. Healy. In 1976, McCarthy consecrated Raffaele a bishop, and at the same time made Raffaele associate, Gerard J. Kessler, a monsignor. Six months after being made a bishop, Raffaele and his church left the Mount Athos Synod, and formed the American Orthodox Catholic Church - Western Rite Mission, Diocese of New York.

Proton ATPases are divided into three groups as outlined below: P-type proton ATPase P-type ATPases form a covalent phosphorylated (hence the symbol ’P') intermediate as part of its reaction cycle. P-type ATPases undergo major conformational changes during the catalytic cycle. P-type ATPases are not evolutionary related to V- and F-type ATPases. Plasma membrane H+-ATPase P-type proton ATPase (or plasma membrane -ATPase) is found in the plasma membranes of eubacteria, archaea, protozoa, fungi and plants. Here it serves as a functional equivalent to the Na+/K+ ATPase of animal cells; i.e. it energizes the plasma membrane by forming an electrochemical gradient of protons (Na+ in animal cells), that in turn drives secondary active transport processes across the membrane. The plasma membrane H+-ATPase is a P3A ATPase with a single polypeptide of 70-100 kDa. Gastric H+/K+ ATPase Animals have a gastric hydrogen potassium ATPase or H+/K+ ATPase that belongs to the P-type ATPase family and functions as an electroneutral proton pump. This pump is found in the plasma membrane of cells in the gastric mucosa and functions to acidify the stomach. This enzyme is a P2C ATPase, characterized by having a supporting beta-subunit, and is closely related to the Na+/K+ ATPase. V-type proton ATPase V-type proton ATPase (or V-ATPase) translocate protons into intracellular organelles other than mitochondria and chloroplasts, but in certain cell types they are also found in the plasma membrane. V-type ATPases acidify the lumen of the vacuole (hence the symbol 'V') of fungi and plants, and that of the lysosome in animal cells. Furthermore, they are found in endosomes, clathrin coated vesicles, hormone storage granules, secretory granules, Golgi vesicles and in the plasma membrane of a variety of animal cells. Like F-type ATPases, V-type ATPases are composed of multiple subunits and carry out rotary catalysis. The reaction cycle involves tight binding of ATP but proceeds without formation of a covalent phosphorylated intermediate. V-type ATPases are evolutionary related to F-type ATPases. F-type proton ATPase F-type proton ATPase (or F-ATPase) typically operates as an ATP synthase that dissipates a proton gradient rather than generating one; i.e. protons flow in the reverse direction compared to V-type ATPases. In eubacteria, F-type ATPases are found in plasma membranes. In eukaryotes, they are found in the mitochondrial inner membranes and in chloroplast thylakoid membranes. Like V-type ATPases, F-type ATPases are composed of multiple subunits and carry out rotary catalysis.

They are also called Aal al-Aba ( ) and in Persian Panj-Tan Paak (), meaning 'the Five Pious'. The origin of this belief is found in the Hadith of the Event of the Cloak and the Hadith of Mubahala. This is graded authentic by Shia Muslims and Sunnis, however many Sunnis plead a different interpretation. It is one of the foundations of the Shia conception of the Imamah, which states that patrilineal descendants of Muhammad's daughter have a special divine spiritual leadership over the Muslim community. The , along with their descendants, the Imams, form the Shia definition of Ahl al-Bayt, the \\"People of the House,\\" or the family of Muhammad. The three larger branches of Shia Islam differ on the nature of the and the Imams. The two largest branches, the mainstream Twelvers and the Ismailis, consider them to be in a state of , or infallibility: a belief originating from the Verse of Purification in the Quran. In contrast, the third branch, the Zaidis, view them only as political figures with the duty to lead revolts against corrupt rulers and governments. Hadith of the Cloak thumb The Hadith of the Cloak ( ) refers to the . The hadith is an account of an incident where Muhammad gathered Hassan, Husayn, Ali, and Fatimah under his cloak. This is referred to in several hadiths, including within Sahih Muslim, in which Muhammad is quoted as saying , or the People of the House, from the second part of the Verse of Purification (). This hadith is central to the Shia beliefs. For the Shia, it is the basis of the doctrine that the leader of the Muslims should be purified (per Quran 33:33) and from that particular direct line of descendants of Muhammad through Fatimah and Ali that have thus been purified by God. It also serves as the majority Shia doctrine that this line of descendants are infallible, pure, and sinless (). The Shia believe that the hadith shows that Muhammad, Fatima, Ali, Hasan, and Husayn are the only members of the . Generally, Sunnis also accept the spiritual significance of the event of purification as exalted in the Quran and elaborated upon by Saheeh Hadith (see below), but do not subscribe to the political authority that the Shia infer from this belief. Summary of the arguments Context Certain Sunni scholars hold that the wives of Muhammad were included in the second part of the verse 33:33, since they are addressed in the beginning of verse 33:33. They reject the notion that the end of this verse would be a stand-alone blessing, meant exclusively for Muhammad, Ali, Fatima, Hasan, and Husain, as they have in mind the context of the verse as a whole and the one preceding it. Albeit, most Sunni would accept the Sahih hadith and concur with the Shia that the special privilege is conferred on the five. The Shia counter-argument is that the verse itself says \\"only,\\" implying that the blessing of this merit is exclusive to a single group and one other than the wives, i.e. God desires to keep away the uncleanness from \\"only\\" you, \\"O people of the House\\", and not from anyone else, and this is why the six stern commandments of the other verses are given to the wives, because they are not protected and must act accordingly; the \\"people of the house\\", on the other hand, need no such instructions. The Shia also point out that the rhetoric changes to a masculine tone in the final part of the verse whereas it was feminine before that. Gender The Shia also argue that the first part of the verse addresses a person or group in the feminine gender, while the second part addresses in the masculine gender, meaning that at least one person in the group is a male. Wilfred Madelung, Laudian Professor of Arabic at the University of Oxford, made the following observation on the Verse of Purification:Madelung, The Succession to Muhammad, pp. 14–15. According to Laura Veccia Vaglieri in the Encyclopaedia of Islam\\"Fāṭima\\". Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition. Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C. E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W. P. Heinrichs. Brill Online, 2014. Reference. 8 April 2014 The Incident of Mubahala According to the Sunni hadith collections, it is narrated that during the 9th through the 10th year after hijra, an Arab Christian envoy from Najran (currently in northern Yemen and partly in Saudi Arabia) came to the Muhammad to argue which of the two parties erred in its doctrine concerning Jesus (Quran 3:61). Muhammad offered to do the Arabic tradition known as Mubahala, where each conflicting party should cover themselves, and together all parties ask God sincerely to destroy and inflict with curses on the lying party and their families. Muhammad, to prove to them that he was a prophet, brought his daughter Fatimah and his surviving grandchildren, Hasan and Hussain, and Ali ibn Abi Talib and came back to the Christians and said this is my family () and covered himself and his family with a cloak. The Shia believe this authentic hadith proves whom the Qur'an is referring to when it mentions the Ahl al-Bayt which includes only Ali, Fatimah, and their descendants. Meanwhile, most Sunni sources are in agreement with Shia belief saying that only the Ahl al-Kisa, Muhammad, his daughter Fatimah and his two grandsons, Hasan and Husayn, and Ali ibn Abi Talib, participated the occasion - none of his wives, other grandchildren or sons-in-law were selected. Shia view The Shia celebrate this event as . This hadith provides the background for the \\"purification verse\\" or from surah Al-Ahzab in the Quran whereby God explicitly identified the (33:33):A portion of this Surah sums up the lessons of the Battle of the Trench and must have been revealed some time after that battle (Shawwal, five years after Hijrah) The marriage with Zainab is referred to in verse 37 also took place in the same year. The tradition about this hadith goes from different sources to Fatimah, the daughter of Muhammad. She narrated that once her father visited her home, he had fever and was not feeling well, he asked for a Yemeni cloak which Fatimah brought to him and folded it around him. Later he was joined in that Yemeni cloak by his grandsons Hassan and Husayn, who were followed by their father Ali, who was cousin and son-in-law of Muhammad. Finally, Fatimah asked the permission to enter that cloak. When all five of them joined together under the cloak, Muhammad narrated the Quranic verse 33:33 to those under the cloak that all five of them are chosen ones, and he further stated that he wants from God to keep all impurities out of reach and away from all of us. Muhammad then prayed to God to declare all five of them as his and keep away the (impurities). At that request, God immediately sent Gabriel to reveal to Muhammad that all the five under the cloak are dearest and closest to God and they are (purest of the pure) without any traces of impurities. Political application The hadith of the cloak and the purification verse was utilized at various times by the Ahl al-Bayt to assert their beliefs to political and spiritual leadership of the Muslim community. For example, at the gathering that was convened after the death of Umar in 644 to select a caliph, Ali made the following argument: \\"Is there any among us apart from myself concerning whom the \\"purification verse\\" was revealed?\\" When they answered \\"no\\" he proceeded: \\"The People of the House are overflowing with abundant virtue, for the Quran says, 'God wishes to remove all filth and impurity from you O House of the Prophet, and to render you utterly free of pollution.' (33:33) God has therefore removed from us all evil, outer and inner, and placed us firmly on the path of truth and righteousness.\\"al-Bahrani, Ghayat al-Marum, p.295 Sunni view Some Sunni scholars remark that the \\"purification verse\\" was revealed concerning five people: Muhammad, Ali, Fatimah, Hassan and Husayn.al- Bahrani, Ghayat al-Marum, p. 126: al-Suyuti, al-Durr al-Manthur, Vol. V, p. 199; Ahmad ibn Hanbal, al Musnad, Vol. I, p. 331; Fakhr al-Din al-Razi, al- Tafsir al-Kabir, Vol. I, p. 783; Ibn Hajar, al-Sawa'iq, p. 85 Others maintain that the \\"purification verse\\" cannot refer to the inerrancy of the Imams because the context in which it occurs relates to the wives of Muhammad and necessitates that it, too, should refer to them, or that at the very least they cannot be excluded from the category it addresses. If it were to imply inerrancy, then the wives of Muhammad would also have to be inerrant, a belief that Sunni scholars do not hold. Shia scholars, however, do believe in the infallibility of Muhammad. Ibn Kathir in his tafsir of the relevant verse says \\"the [Sunni] scholars are unanimously agreed that [Muhammad's wives] were the reason for revelation in this case...but others may be included by way of generalization.\\" Nevertheless, according to the Sunni historian al-Tabari, the term refers to ‘Ali, Fatima, Hasan, and Husayn.

Originally a Yiddish language song \\"Dana Dana\\" (in Yiddish דאַנאַ דאַנאַ), also known as \\"Dos Kelbl\\" (in Yiddish דאָס קעלבל meaning The Calf) it was a song used in a Yiddish play produced by Zeitlin. History \\"Dana Dana\\" was written for the Aaron Zeitlin stage production Esterke (1940–41) with music composed by Sholom Secunda. The lyrics, score, parts, and associated material are available online in the Yiddish Theater Digital Archives. The lyric sheet is in typewritten Yiddish and handwritten Yiddish lyrics also appear in the piano score. The text underlay in the score and parts is otherwise romanized in a phonetic transcription that appears oriented toward stage German. The YIVO standardized transliteration system was not then in widespread use, and many Yiddish transliterations looked like German, to which the Yiddish language is closely related. The orchestra plays the \\"Dana Dana\\" melody at several points in Esterke. The original is 2/4, in G minor for a duo of a man and a woman, choral with the orchestral accompaniment. Secunda wrote \\"Dana-\\" for the orchestral score and \\"Dana Dana\\" for the vocal scores. The Yiddish text was written with Roman alphabet. He wrote for the choral score \\"andantino\\" (somewhat slowly) and \\"sempre staccato\\" (play staccato always). The melody of the introduction was also used at the end of the song. He wrote \\"piu mosso\\" (more rapidly) for the refrain and some passages that emphasize the winds. First, a woman (Secunda wrote \\"she\\") sings four bars and then the man (Secunda wrote \\"he\\") sings the next four. They sing together from the refrain. Although singing the third part of \\"Dana Dana\\" (=\\"Dana Dana Dana Dana...\\") the man sometimes sings lower than the melody using disjunct motions. The melody is refrained. Then \\"he\\" sings the melody, and \\"she\\" sometimes sings \\"Dana\\", other times sings \\"Ah\\" with a high voice or technical passage. Secunda wrote \\"molto rit.\\" (suddenly much more slowly) for the ending of the first verse. There are some differences between the original and the melody that are well known. Secunda wrote \\"ha ha ha\\" for the choral score with the broken chords. There are various views as to the meaning of the Yiddish word Dana, repeated sixteen times in each chorus. Some believe it to be a nonesense word. A comment appearing in the Hebrew newspaper Haaretz (ref https://www.haaretz.co.il/misc/1.1256045), gives the meaning of Dana as the sound that was commonly made by the guide of a horse-drawn cart to encourage the horse to continue to step forward as it drags its heavy load. According to the comment in Haaretz, the translation of the word Dana (from Yiddish to Hebrew) was provided by Kol Israel in 1962, when the song was performed by Nechama Hendel. In the John Camden Hotten slang dictionary, the word Dana related to a nightman's or dustman's cart in old German / Austrian slang. https://www.gutenberg.org/files/42108/42108-h/42108-h.htm Lyrics { valign=\\"top\\" https://www.haaretz.co.il/misc/1.1256045 Yiddish original אױפֿן פֿורל ליגט דאָס קעלבל, ליגט געבונדן מיט אַ שטריק. הױך אין הימל פֿליט דאָס שװעלבל, פֿרייט זיך, דרייט זיך הין און צוריק. כאָר: לאַכט דער ווינט אין קאָרן, לאַכט און לאַכט און לאַכט, לאַכט ער אָפּ אַ טאָג אַ גאַנצן מיט אַ האַלבע נאַכט. דאָנאַ, דאָנאַ, דאָנאַ, … שרייַט דאָס קעלבל, זאָגט דער פּױער: װער זשע הײסט דיר זײַן אַ קאַלב? װאָלסט געקענט דאָך זײַן אַ פֿױגל, װאָלסט געקענט דאָך זײַן אַ שװאַלב. כאָר בידנע קעלבער טוט מען בינדן און מען שלעפּט זײ און מען שעכט, װער ס'האָט פֿליגל, פֿליט אַרױפֿצו, איז בײַ קײנעם ניט קיין קנעכט. כאָר  valign=\\"top\\"  Translation by Shalom Secunda On a wagon bound and helpless Lies a calf, who is doomed to die.

It became especially popular after being recorded by Joan Baez in 1960 in her album Joan Baez. In her version, the song is retitled \\"Donna, Donna\\" (doubling the n\\"). This became very popular and later versions also used the double \\"n\\". The song became a staple of Baez and used in the human rights protest movement in the 1960s. ;Claude François version In 1964, the song was recorded in French language by French singer Claude François as \\"Donna, Donna\\" reaching the top of the French Singles Charts for two consecutive weeks in December 1964. François co-wrote the French lyrics with Vline Buggy. The song also known by its longer title \\"Donna, Donna (Le Petit Garçon)\\" is a completely revamped version lyricwise, as it no longer describes a helpless calf being led to its slaughter, as in the original Yiddish version, but is rather about the troubles of an aspiring young boy growing up dreaming about his own future. In the last verse, in an autobiographical twist, Claude François alludes to himself by singing the verse as \\"ce petit garçon que j'étais\\" (this small boy that I was...). ;Donovan version Very soon after the Claude François version, the Scottish singer-songwriter Donovan recorded another very popular cover of Baez' version in 1965. The track appeared on his album What's Bin Did and What's Bin Hid. The title is also \\"Donna, Donna\\", thus reinforcing further the popular \\"Donna\\" rather than the original transliteration \\"Dona\\". ;Hebrew version \\"Dana Dana\\" has been translated from Yiddish into Hebrew as \\"Lama Dona\\" and interpreted by Rika Zaraï. Zaraï went on also to launch a French oriental dance version in her album Hava. ;Translations The song was recorded in many other languages as well including German, French, Swedish, Japanese, Hebrew, Russian, Italian, Catalan and Vietnamese. In Vietnamese language, the lyrics was translated metaphorically from French version by Trần Tiến, a well-known musician in Vietnam. This version was performed by a girlband name Tam Ca Áo Trắng (Trio of schoolgirls). There is also a less popular Vietnamese version called \\"Tiếc thương\\" (Mourning) that expresses the mourning of a man whose lover died at the young age.

He is best known as the speaker for The Lutheran Hour radio broadcast from 1930 to 1950. Early life and education Walter A. Meier is standing in the back row, the second one from the left. This is a picture of the faculty of the St. Louis Seminary in 1927-1929. Maier was born in Boston, Massachusetts on October 4, 1893, the fourth of five children to German immigrants Emil William and Anna Katherine 'Grossie' Maier.The life of Walter's mother, 'Grossie' (a diminutive of the German Grossmutter,) was memorialized as a biography by her pastor, Elmer A. Kettner, under the title, Grossie - The Woman Everyone Loved, the life story of Anna K. Maier, the mother of Dr. Walter A. Maier. (Grand Rapids, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., 1949) Maier grew up in Boston as an integral part of this large, close-knit, devoutly Christian family, spending his summers at the family farm near Canaan, New Hampshire. Maier planned to enter the ministry from an early age. His family supported his goals by arranging for him to attend the Concordia Collegiate Institute in New York, an academy combining both high school and junior college in the fashion of a European Gymnasium. Here, young Maier learned Greek, Latin, and German, along with other background materials suitable for an aspiring Lutheran minister. And here he first developed his love for studies in Hebrew, the language of the Christian Old Testament. After graduating as valedictorian of the Concordia Institute, Maier obtained his B.A. from Boston University in 1913. From there, he went directly to Concordia Seminary in St. Louis, Missouri, where he supported himself by selling Oliver typewriters. Here, once again, it was the Hebrew language and Old Testament studies that engrossed Maier. And once again, his love for the subject caused him to excel in it. Upon graduation in 1916, and in recognition of his proficiency in the field, young Maier was awarded a graduate fellowship in Old Testament studies at Harvard Divinity School.Dictionary of Missouri Biography, By Lawrence O. Christensen, University of Missouri Press, 1999, p. 513. Due to the breadth of his academic goals, Maier studied at Harvard Divinity School from 1916 to 1918, and at Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences from 1918 to 1920. These four years saw the completion of course requirements for both Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy degrees, and the creation of a first draft of his doctoral dissertation, Slavery in the Time of the Hammurabi Dynasty. His perspicacity concerning Biblical Hebrew led to the mastery of other Semitic languages such as Arabic, Assyrian, and Babylonian, as well as the Hittite and Sumerian languages; and included the ability to read ancient cuneiform. The study of Semitics also led to his deep understanding of the history, literature, and culture of the ancient societies associated with these languages. In 1917, Harvard Divinity School awarded Maier the Billings Prize for oratory. He received an M.A. in Semitic language, literature and history from Harvard University in 1920; and in 1929 became the twentieth person to ever receive his doctorate from Harvard in Semitics. Since America's oldest college had been founded in 1636, an average of one successful candidate every fifteen years had received this degree. But academics were not Maier's only pursuit during these years at Harvard. Having been ordained into the holy ministry on May 20, 1917, Maier also served as assistant pastor for the Zion Lutheran Church in Boston from 1917 to 1920. To these duties he added service as a United States Army chaplain from 1918 onward. Much of his work in the chaplain corps was spent working with German prisoners of World War I being held in the Boston area. For his ministry to these captured Germans, Chaplain Maier was eventually presented with a Luther Bible, 2nd edition, 1541. Walther League Upon receipt of his M.A. degree in 1920, Maier was offered a number of university teaching positions which would have facilitated his preparation for the doctorate. Although the opportunity to continue his academic career obviously held great appeal, Maier chose to first answer the call of the church. Founded the year of Maier's birth, the Lutheran young people's organization known as the Walther Leaguenamed after Dr. C. F. W. Walther, one of the founders of Lutheranism in America was in need of a national director. Among other responsibilities, this office included editorship of the organization's monthly journal, The Walther League Messenger. Forsaking his cherished New England for this position in Milwaukee, Maier was installed as executive secretary on October 7, 1920. One of the first tasks suggested to Secretary Maier by the League's executive board was to discontinue funding of the Wheat Ridge Tuberculosis Sanatorium, an expensive facility maintained largely through League support. The young League executive visited the clinic himself, planning to deliver the bad news in person. But after seeing the need of the patients and the vision of the Wheat Ridge staff, and without consulting his board, Maier ended up pledging the League's support for capital expansion of the hospital. Amazingly, the young people of the Walther League were able to raise more than $200,000 in the following months to keep this promise. Today the Sanatorium is no longer needed, but a viable Wheat Ridge Ministries is still about \\"Lutherans seeding new ministries of health and hope in the name of the healing Christ.\\" Wheat Ridge Ministries Financial Information Page The new editor of The Walther League Messenger also enhanced the publishing arm of the League. Editor Maier increased the size of the magazine, added features and pictures, wrote stirring editorials, and wrapped it all in a new, more appealing format. Through these improvements and the rapid growth of League membership under Maier's direction, the circulation of the Messenger doubled in a few months. One of these new readers was a young suburban Indianapolis teacher by the name of Hulda Augusta Eickhoff. Impressed by the solid message and zestful writing style of the articles signed only with the initials “W.A.M.”, Miss Eickhoff decided to join the Walther League and become a part of their vision. Soon Hulda was elected secretary of the Indianapolis chapter. Her program material had to be approved by “W.A.M.” in Milwaukee, who became as smitten with her writing as she was with his. It was just a matter of time before the handsome twenty-seven-year-old national secretary met the secretary of the Indianapolis chapter; a slender brunette with expressive brown eyes and sparkling smile who was destined to become his bride. Married in 1924, they eventually had two sons: Walter A. Maier II, born in 1925; and Paul L. Maier, born in 1929. Maier continued in his capacity as editor of the Messenger through 1945. Concordia Seminary In 1922, Maier accepted the call to become Professor of Old Testament History and Interpretation at Concordia Seminary. At 29 years of age he was the youngest person to hold the rank of full professor in the institution's eighty-three year history. In order to take this post in St. Louis, Maier resigned as executive secretary of the Walther League, but retained the responsibility of editor for the Messenger. Here Maier was known as “a bear in the classroom, but a prince at home,” by the generation of young seminarians to whom he expounded the Hebrew language and Old Testament exegesis. The same Professor Maier who kept impeccably high standards in the classroom was also known for inviting entire classes of students – sometimes over 100 strong – into his home for meals and entertainment.Lagerquist, 1999,pp. 55-68see also http://www.lutheranhour.org/speakers/maier.htm In 1926 Concordia Seminary moved from southern St. Louis on Jefferson Avenue into a newly constructed facility west of St. Louis in the suburb of Clayton. The Maier family moved into a house built on the Clayton campus, where Maier lived for the rest of his life.A Man Spoke, a World Listened: the Story of Walter A. Maier, by Paul L. Maier, McGraw-Hill, 1963, Pp.81-83 Entry into radio broadcasting In March 1923 the Messenger featured a W.A.M. editorial entitled “Why not a Lutheran Broadcasting Station?” Its editor had long recognized the potential of radio to carry the gospel message to the masses, and dedicated numerous articles, editorials, conferences and addresses to the realization of this goal.See the following editorials by W.A.M. in the Messenger: XXXI (1922/23), 314, 378, 434 ff.; XXXII (1923/24), 104, 356 ff. Cp. also XXXIII (1924/25), 109, 272, 336, 400, 464, 526, 592, 668 ff.; XXXIV (1925/26), 26, 408, 550. Funded by appropriations from the Walther League, Lutheran Layman's League, friends, and seminary students, a 500 watt transmitter was purchased and the first Christian radio station was born at Concordia Seminary. The new station, designated KFUO by the Federal Radio Commission, first proclaimed “The Gospel Voice” upon a 545.1 meter wavelength on Sunday, December 14, 1924 at 9:15 p.m. Maier had two weekly programs on the fledgling station, but repeatedly promised, “This is only the beginning!”. Although KFUO was well received and well supported, Maier envisioned a broader audience than could be reached by constructing local radio stations. By 1929, with the goal of spreading the gospel from coast-to-coast, he was investigating the logistics of network broadcasting. At this time, the major radio networks donated air time to the Federal Council of Churches, but no single denomination had ever produced a nationwide radio show dedicated to spreading the gospel. Having persuaded the Missouri Synod of the validity of this project, Maier contacted the National Broadcasting Company early in 1930. He was disappointed to find that NBC would not donate air time to the Lutheran Church, or any other single denomination. Worse still, they would not even allow the Lutheran Church to purchase air time. NBC's policy, Maier was told, precluded putting religious time on a commercial basis. Maier then approached the Columbia Broadcasting System. CBS accepted paid religious programs but would the charge full commercial rate of $4500 per half-hour to broadcast over its thirty-four city network. An expense of over $200,000 annually seeming too much for the Synod during the depths of the Great Depression, the project was turned over to the Lutheran Layman's League. The L.L.L. had already shown enthusiasm for religious broadcasting, and had great respect for Maier. In the end, the L.L.L. and Walther League were able to raise commitments of $94,000 by late summer – enough to sign the contract with CBS and commence broadcasting. With Maier as Speaker, The Lutheran Hour premiered on Thursday, October 2, 1930 at 10:00 (Eastern) or 7:00 (Pacific); immediately following CBS's hit mystery, The Shadow. Polling systems for ratings had not yet been invented. The size of a listening audience was estimated by counting each program's fan mail. 15,000 communications were received during the first few weeks of broadcasting. Within a few months, with the listening audience estimated at five million hearers, The Lutheran Hour was receiving more mail than such top secular shows as Amos ‘n’ Andy. The Lutheran Hour was featured in over eight-hundred newspapers nationwide and regularly selected by both the New York Herald Tribune and Post as a recommended program for Thursdays. The program ran for thirty-six weeks its first season, and received over 57,000 pieces of correspondence. Due to financial concerns, The Lutheran Hour was discontinued from June, 1931 through 1934. Public speaker Discontinuation of the Lutheran Hour merely caused W.A.M. to redouble speaking efforts. He still had access to KFUO for local broadcasting; several times he was invited to speak on The Lutheran Hour of Faith and Fellowship, a Detroit-based program which broadcast on a seven station network in Michigan and Indiana; he could reach the public through Messenger editorials; and he taught scores of young seminarians Semitic languages and culture, and how to apply this knowledge to a better understanding of Scripture. But Maier could also reach vast audiences through public speaking. From the time that W.A.M. received the coveted Billings prize, he had received acclaim for remarkable gifts as a public speaker. In 1917, whilst attending Harvard, young Maier's addresses at Clinton, Massachusetts garnered glowing reviews from the local newspaper. By 1920, Executive Secretary Maier was addressing audiences numbering in the thousands. In 1925, he was keynote speaker before an audience of 10,000 for the Lutheran Day Festival at Ocean Grove, New Jersey. On Sunday, June 23, 1929, some 70,000 people attending the quadricentennial celebration of Luther's Catechism listened attentively to the event's featured speaker, Walter A. Maier. From this time onward, the eloquent Semitics Professor was destined to speak before audiences numbering in the tens of thousands. Soon after the Lutheran Hour went off the air, Maier presented one of his most significant essays, “The Jeffersonian Ideals of Religious Liberty,” before the Institute of Public Affairs at the University of Virginia. For this highly publicized conference on church-state relationships, W.A.M. was to share the rostrum with such notables as President Herbert Hoover and Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd. Maier's presentation was given a standing ovation, made headlines across the nation the next morning, and was later published. Later in 1930, Maier was challenged by the Chicago Chapter of the American Association for the Advancement of Atheism to a debate with the renowned atheist, Clarence Darrow. The matter reached the newspapers, igniting strong sentiments from both Atheists and Christians. Clarence Darrow issued a statement to the Associated Press: “I never issued any challenge of this nature and no one has been authorized to issue such a challenge on my behalf.” Despite further entreaty from the challenging institution, Darrow declined to enter the fray, much to the disappointment of Maier. During this period, Maier accepted speaking engagements nearly every weekend. Time magazine featured articles on his “Seven Fatal Follies” and “Back to Luther!” addresses at Ocean Grove (July 27, 1931 and Sept. 4, 1933 respectively). In the fall of 1932, he and Michigan Governor Wilber M. Brucker addressed 11,000 at the Motor City's State Fair Coliseum to honor the bicentennial of George Washington’s birth. Maier spoke before 16,000 at Olympia Stadium in Detroit in 1933, over 25,000 at Belle Isle in 1934. When the Lutheran Hour resumed in 1935, Maier continued to speak before capacity crowds, deeming the message more important than his own well-being.see also links to Time Magazine articles in EL Section of this wikipedia Article Maier became a chief spokesman for the vigorous reassertion of classic Christianity. A superb orator, with the educational background to support his positions, Maier possessed the ability to communicate traditional Christianity in an untraditional manner, (as one magazine writer quipped, “the soapbox delivery of a Harvard script”). His version of traditional Christianity was pure Protestant orthodoxy based on Scripture and mediated through the Lutheran confessional traditions. In 1948, when Eleanor Roosevelt labeled him as a \\"fanatic fundamentalist,\\" he replied with a sermon entitled, \\"You, Too, Should be a Fundamentalist!\\" (Roosevelt later retracted her charge and apologized to W.A.M.)Dr. Paul L. Maier, Address to the AMERICAN ACADEMY of RELIGION - Annual Meeting, Chicago, IL, Monday, November 3, 2008. “Fathers and Sons: The Influence of Evangelists Walter A. Maier, Percy Crawford, Merv Rosell, Jack Wyrtzen, and Charles Woodbridge on Fundamentalism in the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s.” The Lutheran Hour From the time that The Lutheran Hour went off the national air in 1931, Maier never stopped working for its return. To avoid the prohibitive costs associated with the first network season, Maier and the radio committee of The Detroit Lutheran Pastoral Conference decided to recommence operations on the newly formed Mutual Broadcasting System. Although the reinstituted Lutheran Hour would broadcast on only eight stations, it included heavyweight WLW of Cincinnati. Broadcasting at 500,000 watts, or ten times the maximum output allowed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) today, WLW could be heard anywhere east of the Rocky Mountains. Commencing on Sunday, February 10, 1935, the Lutheran Hour proclaimed its second season from Epiphany Church in Detroit. Brace Beemer, the voice of WLW's original Lone Ranger, was the announcer and the noted Maier returned as Speaker. Over a thousand letters from sixteen states and Canada were received after the first broadcast, providing some gauge of the program's reach. During the season, KFUO; WTJS, Jackson, Tenn.; and KLCN, Blytheville, Ark. joined the stations covering the Lutheran Hour. By the end of the fourteen broadcasts, over 16,000 letters had arrived from thirty-five states and several provinces of Canada.see also FCC – AM Station Classes From its third season onward, the Lutheran Hour originated from KFUO on the Concordia Campus, a welcome relief from the 450 mile weekly commute to Detroit endured by Maier during the second season. By the fourth season, the Lutheran Hour was reaching west of the Rockies again with the addition of nine stations of California's Don Lee Network and KFEL in Denver. The total number of outlets was now thirty-one, almost as many as the original network contract provided for in 1930. This series received over 90,000 pieces of correspondence from every state of the Union as well as provinces of Canada and Mexico. The fifth season (1937/38) broadcast over sixty-two stations; the sixth (1938/39) sixty-six; and with the advent of electronic transcription, the seventh Lutheran Hour (1939/40) was aired on 171 radio stations. The Spanish Lutheran Hour was also added in 1939, originating with short-wave radio station HCJB (“The Voice of the Andes”) in Quito, Ecuador. Soon stations were added in Puerto Rico, Panama, Columbia, Venezuela, Bolivia, and the Philippines. Freedom of speech In 1938 the Federal Council of Churches petitioned the National Association of Broadcasters and the Federal Communications Commission formally requesting that all paid religious programs be barred from the air. The major radio networks at this time donated time to the three major divisions of organized religion in the United States: Protestant, Roman Catholic, and Judaism. Protestant programming had been placed under exclusive direction of the Council, an organization which represented about thirty denominations but less than half of American Protestantism. Overtly liberal in its theology, the Federal Council would not sponsor a conservative, Christ-centered program such as the Lutheran Hour. Jealous of its privilege, the Council's general secretary was on record as having said in 1929, “in the future, no denomination or individual church will be able to secure any time whatever on the air unless they are willing to pay prohibitively high prices....” Having overcome the disadvantage of providing its own financing, the Lutheran Hour was now the largest religious broadcast in radio. But the Federal Council sought to end all such endeavours, allowing no viewpoint except its own. Championing the cause of religious freedom and freedom of speech, Maier was a strong voice against such “totalitarian tendencies.” As portrayed in a 1938 article by Time magazine, Maier's pulpit helped to preserve the heritage of liberty enjoyed by citizens of the United States.see also April 11, 1938, Time Magazine article: Walter A. Maier v. Federal Council of Churches on Freedom for Religious Broadcasting Continued growth By its eighth season (1940/41) fifty-two foreign stations brought the Lutheran Hour’s total to 310. This year the program received 200,000 communications, including as many as 5,000 items in a single day. The 1941/42 Lutheran Hour saw the entry of the United States into World War II. This year the Icelandic government granted the Lutheran Hour use of 100,000-watt Radio Reykjavic for programs in English and Icelandic. For the first time, the Lutheran Hour would be heard in Europe. A mail count of 260,000 corroborated other means of audience measurement in creating an estimate of 10,000,000 listeners worldwide. The tenth season (1942/43) was the first to run for 52 weeks. The eleventh season (1943/44) was carried on 540 stations; the twelfth (1943/44) on 609; and the thirteenth (1944/45) on 809 stations. During the twelfth season the Mutual Broadcasting System enacted a new policy that prohibited solicitation of funds on the broadcast. Up to this time, contributions from radio listeners had supported about 75% of program costs, with Lutheran agencies and friends of the ministry providing the rest. Despite a cost which had risen to $29,000 per program, or $1,500,000 per season, listeners continued to support the majority of the broadcast without being asked. These trends continued into Maier’s last year as Speaker. In 1949, ABC announced that they had decided to accept paid religious broadcasting. With this addition, the Lutheran Hour was now heard on 1236 stations worldwide. ABC and CBS also offered television facilities for the program. Several such telecasts were produced beginning with a local show over St. Louis’ KSD-TV on New Year's Day, 1948. By end of year, 1949, the Lutheran Hour was broadcast from 55 countries to a potential listening audience of 450,000,000 in 120 different lands. Programming was translated into thirty-six languages, and plans were in motion to raise that tally to fifty. An agreement had been reached to add a 111-station Japanese Lutheran Hour to ongoing broadcasts in Spanish, Afrikaans, German, Chinese, Arabic, Slovak, Italian, Greek, Estonian, Latvian, Hungarian, Bulgarian, Polish, Russian, and others. The broadcast could be heard in Australia, Latin America, throughout Africa, the Far East including much of Communist China, the South Pacific Islands and the West Indies, and all of Europe, including Soviet Eastern Europe and some of Asiatic Russia. The estimated weekly listening audience rose from 12,000,000 (Time, 1943), to 15,000,000 (Collier's, 1944), to 20,000,000 people (Saturday Evening Post, 1948). Mail count continued to exceed the rate which had produced 450,000 items in the previous season, culminating in a record of 17,000 letters received in one day. All of this indicated success for Maier's vision of “Bringing Christ to the Nations.” Writing career Maier was editor of the Walther League Messenger for twenty five years, from 1920 -1945. Once a month this magazine addressed timely issues, secular and religious, within an illustrated format which averaged sixty-four pages in length. Each issue included at least three editorials and articles authored by “W.A.M.” In over nine-hundred essays W.A.M. explored subjects ranging from archaeology, literature and education, music and the fine arts, science and medicine, society and entertainment, business and labor. His object was to provide thinking church people with spiritual insights into current topics, a perspective not addressed in secular periodicals. During the quarter century under Maier as Editor Messenger circulation grew from 7,000 to 80,000, indicating that his target audience appreciated this approach. When the national Lutheran Hour went off the air in 1931, many listeners wrote to express interest in continuing its message. Its speaker's first book, The Lutheran Hour, was a collection of broadcast sermons from that first season, intended to alleviate these concerns until a second season could be developed. When the Lutheran Hour broadcast resumed in 1935, the radio public continued to request sermons in printed form. This led to twenty volumes of published W.A.M. sermons during his years as Speaker. When Maier prepared a radio sermon, he dealt with each subject exhaustively. The pica transcripts of his message were typically twenty-two to twenty-four pages long, with far more detail than he could include in a twenty-minute delivery. The complete messages were included in the published collections, which meant that a reader would get fresh information, even on a subject that he had already heard on the radio. The books averaged 350 - 400 pages each and served as resource materials for many Protestant ministers. The following excerpts are illustrative of the national reviews: > …sober, sensible, and fervent talks on religion…that have moved many people > to serious thinking…–Boston Globe, January 23, 1932 > …a clarity unusual in this day of foggy verbiage. – Dallas Times-Herald, > January 24, 1932 > …earnest, evangelical, and absolutely sound…–The Christian Century, XLIX, > 258 In 1934 Maier published For Better, Not for Worse: A Manual of Christian Matrimony. W.A.M. honestly believed that no one was more happily married than he, and the intentions of many supposed experts to redefine the institution troubled him. Maier hoped that such a book, based upon a thorough study of the problem, would enable others to also obtain wedded bliss as a reality in their lives. ‘Thorough’ being the keyword, For Better, Not for Worse, included 504 pages of small type in its first edition. The book sold out five printings more quickly than expected, and each time the noted Professor added detail and clarification. By the sixth printing, the matrimonial tome had reached 598 pages in length. The consensus of newspaper and magazine reviews was overwhelmingly favourable, although the work was regarded as academic and “ponderous” by some. Time devoted half of a 1935 article towards its review, and the following excerpt from Christianity Today is indicative of the overall response: > This volume is a needed protest against the pagan, despiritualized > conceptions of courtship, marriage and family relations that find such wide- > spread expression today….It is more than a protest, however. It sets forth > the constructive contributions which Christianity makes to married > happiness. In 1931, Maier wrote the essay, “The Jeffersonian Ideals of Religious Liberty,” which was later published by Concordia. During World War II Maier wrote the well-known Wartime Prayer Guide. The sixty-six page booklet measured less than 3 X 5 inches, and was designed to fit in the uniform pockets of those in service. Several hundred thousand of these were printed by Concordia and distributed to those engaged in the war. Ernst Kaufmann Publishers of New York approached the eminent Professor in 1940 to author the text of a new format of home devotional literature. The work consisted of calendar leaflets for each day of the year with a Scripture text, and a 200-word devotional printed on one side and a prayer and hymn verse on the other. W.A.M. produced twelve years of this series, entitled Day by Day; with sales eventually rising to 50,000 annually. Phonograph record albums entitled Day by Day were also produced, with Maier meditations and hymns by the Lutheran Hour Chorus. The Lutheran Hour offered a tuition-free Correspondence Course entitled, “The Fundamentals of the Christian Faith.” The materials for this study series were also written by Maier – thirty lessons (with test sheets). In addition, Maier published five paperback Lenten devotionals from 1945- 1949. Culminating Maier's literary career was the long-researched The Book of Nahum. Published posthumously in 1959 from a manuscript whose text was completed before Maier's death, The Book of Nahum was a return to Maier's first love, Semitics. For many years, Maier had worked on this project in his leisure time, often stating his intention to fill his later years with such academic pursuits, once he retired from the limelight. This last work was an examination of the Biblical book of Nahum from the scholar's perspective. Maier's main interest lay in the fact that Nahum predicted the fall of the Assyrian empire at around 650 BC, some forty years before the event actually occurred. Many modern higher-critical studies have assumed that Nahum must have been written after the fall of Nineveh in 612 BC, based upon the preconceived bias that prophecy is impossible or unscientific. Maier's work demonstrated that such predictions were in fact given many years in advance of the fulfillment. His work highlights twenty-two separate details in Nahum's prophecies which were literally fulfilled in the fall of Nineveh. Prof. George V. Schick finished the bibliography and edited the manuscript for publication. Death He died on January 11, 1950.  Legacy  Maier “returned to his Creator for entry into life everlasting” at 12:25 a.m. on January 11, 1950. He left behind a bereaved widow and two sons. But he also left a legacy to those of us that remain. At the time of his death, The Lutheran Hour that he founded had become the largest regular broadcast – secular or religious – in the history of radio.Dr. Paul L.

His work Il podere, concerned with agronomy, was inspired by Columella with its precise observations on the choice of a good agricultural estate. Jacquet de Berchem set some of his texts, as did Giovanni Tommaso Benedictis da Pascarola. François de Malherbe’s Larmes de Saint Pierre, imitated from Tansillo, appeared in 1587, and in 1594 Orlando di Lasso also set Le lagrime di San Pietro. William Roscoe’s translation of Tansillo's Nurse appeared in 1798, and went through several editions. Tansillo died in Teano at the age of 58.

Overview Unlike other Acts of Parliament that preceded it, the 1856 Act provided a simple administrative procedure by which any group of seven people could register a limited liability company for themselves. Debate The Joint Stock Companies Bill was introduced to Parliament by the then Vice President of the Board of Trade, Robert Lowe. In doing so he proclaimed the right of every citizen to have freedom of contract and with it obtain limited liability for operating a business. Companies had until recently been prohibited, as a result of the Bubble Act and the stock market panics of the early 18th century. There was still a lot of suspicion of companies, but Lowe rejected the idea that a limited company is inherently subject to fraud, and proposed the suffix \\"Ltd\\" to make businesses aware of limited liability. The Third Reading of the Bill took place on 2 June 1856, and passed easily.HC Deb, 2 June 1856 vol 142 cols 897-9 See also *Companies Act *Joint Stock Companies Act 1844 *Limited Liability Act 1855 Notes References * * * External links *Joint Stock Companies Act 1856 Table B, original text *Joint Stock Companies Act 1856, explanations Category:1856 in law Category:United Kingdom Acts of Parliament 1856 Category:History of corporate law Category:United Kingdom company law ","title":"Joint Stock Companies Act 1856"},{"id":"17738900","text":"Saxis Wildlife Management Area is a Wildlife Management Area (WMA) in Accomack County, Virginia.

The station was inconveniently situated for travel to central London, with the necessity to complete the journey by road or by the steam boats connecting the station to points between Vauxhall and London Bridge.Nine Elms Station, image and information at Science and Society Detail from a map of 1847 showing the station The station was closed to passengers from 11 July 1848 when the L&SWR; opened its metropolitan extension, the Nine Elms to Waterloo Viaduct from Nine Elms to Waterloo (then called Waterloo Bridge Station), and the area adjacent to the station housed the L&SWR;'s carriage and wagon works until their relocation to Eastleigh in 1909. After closure to passengers the station and surrounding tracks continued in use for goods traffic. Nine Elms station, when in use as a goods station, adapted from an old photograph dated about 1905.

It was originally serialized in Comic Beam from the December 2002 to August 2013 issue, and published in 15 tankōbon volumes by Enterbrain from July 2003 to August 2013. The series is licensed in English by Fantagraphics Books, which released the first volume in North America in July 2011. A 12-episode anime adaptation produced by AIC Classic and directed by Ei Aoki aired in Japan between January and March 2011. Eleven episodes aired on television, with episodes 10 and 11 edited into a single episode, and were released individually on their respective BD/DVD volumes. The story depicts a young student named Shuichi Nitori, described by the author as a trans girl, and Shuichi's friend Yoshino Takatsuki, described as a trans boy. The series deals with issues such as being transgender, gender identity, and the beginning of puberty. Shimura was originally going to write the story about a girl in high school who wants to be a boy, but she realized that a boy who wants to be a girl before entering into puberty would have many worries related to growing up, and changed the story to fit this model. Wandering Son was selected as a recommended work by the awards jury of the tenth Japan Media Arts Festival in 2006. The series has been lauded for its use of gender reversal as the core of the story, though the emotional realism of the young characters has been called into question. Plot At the start of Wandering Son, Shuichi Nitori is a student in the fifth grade who transfers into a new school. Shuichi quickly becomes friends with another student: the tall, boyish Yoshino Takatsuki. Yoshino soon learns of Shuichi's desire to be a girl. In a show of friendship, Yoshino confesses a similar desire to be a boy. Shuichi also becomes friends with Saori Chiba and Kanako Sasa, two other girls in the class. Saori instantly takes a liking to Shuichi and continuously encourages Shuichi to wear feminine clothes. After Shuichi, Yoshino, and their friends enter sixth grade, Shuichi meets Makoto Ariga, another student their age from another class who also secretly wants to be a girl. Shuichi and Yoshino become friends with an adult trans woman named Yuki who is living with a man named Shiina. Shuichi's older sister Maho becomes a model and eventually becomes friends with Maiko, a teen model whom she idolizes, and two other teen models: Tamaki Satō and Anna Suehiro. Maho gets a boyfriend, Riku Seya, and Shuichi confesses a crush on Yoshino, but Yoshino cannot reciprocate Shuichi's feelings. After Saori learns of this, she confesses she likes Shuichi, but Shuichi too cannot return her feelings. This results in a falling-out between Shuichi's friends as they prepare to enter junior high school. In junior high school, they meet a tall, eccentric girl who befriends everyone, Chizuru Sarashina, and her prickly friend Momoko Shirai, who does not get along well with the others—especially Saori. Eventually, Saori and Yoshino rejoin Shuichi's group of friends, though Saori says she still hates Yoshino and Momoko. Shuichi and Anna start dating, much to the surprise of their friends and Shuichi's sister. Yoshino and Saori manage to halfway repair their friendship, though Saori is still standoffish to others. Shuichi's friends are split up into several classes upon entering their second year in junior high school. Shuichi becomes friends with Shinpei Doi, who previously teased Shuichi about wanting to be a girl. Yoshino attends school in a boy's uniform for a short time, and Shuichi tries to go to school dressed as a girl one day, but is laughed at, and becomes discouraged. Shuichi's friends worry as Shuichi begins skipping school. Although Shuichi eventually starts attending school regularly again, Anna breaks off their relationship. By the time Shuichi, Yoshino, and their friends enter their third year in junior high school, Shuichi's voice is changing. The group of friends start thinking about their future high school plans, and Shuichi and Anna start dating again. Shuichi begins attending the same all-boy high school as Makoto and Doi, while Yoshino and Saori begin attending a high school where uniforms are not required. Saori starts dating Fumiya Ninomiya. Yoshino starts working at Anna's modeling agency and Shuichi begins working at a cafe, but later quits. Shuichi starts writing a semi-autobiographical novel. Yoshino later tells Shuichi that the former does not think about wanting to be a boy anymore, and also confesses a romantic attraction to Shuichi. Shuichi still identifies as a girl, and even after informing Anna of this, she stays with Shuichi. After graduating from high school, Shuichi moves out and goes to the same college as Doi. Shuichi continues to write the novel, which is given the title . Characters Protagonists The main characters of Wandering Son (from left to right): Saori, Makoto, Shuichi, Chizuru, Yoshino, and Kanako ; : :Shuichi, one of two protagonists, is in the fifth grade of elementary school. Otherwise known by the nicknames and , Shuichi is trans and often dresses femme. Shuichi is described as cute by many of the other characters and is able to appear as a girl when cross-dressing, because of a feminine-looking face and physical build. Shuichi enjoys wearing cute clothes; although initially not a cross- dresser, Shuichi's friends Yoshino Takatsuki and Saori Chiba encourage Shuichi to dress and act femininely. As Shuichi grows up, puberty becomes a topic of increasing concern, such as the growth of body hair, a deepening voice, and the onset of pimples. Shuichi exhibits signs of gender dysphoria and displays an outward attraction to two characters in the series—Yoshino and Anna Suehiro. Shuichi and Anna date for a time in junior high, until she breaks off their relationship. However, the two soon resume their relationship with each other. :Shuichi is interested in doing indoor activities, and does not partake in activities favored by boys of the same age, such as playing sports. Shuichi enjoys and is skillful in baking sweet foods, though is never shown cooking other, more conventional foods. After starting an exchange diary with Yoshino, Shuichi becomes interested in writing stories, and even joins the drama club as a writer with Saori in junior high school after they co-write a rendition of Romeo and Juliet performed by members of their class. Shuichi has an honest personality, and easily gets along with others. As a child, Shuichi has an obedient, dutiful attitude. However, upon entering puberty, Shuichi sometimes experiences outbursts of intense emotion. Shuichi can be overly sensitive at times and is often shown crying in front of others. Due to these personality quirks, it is easier for Shuichi to associate with girls of the same age. Accordingly, Shuichi has few male friends. ; : :Yoshino, the other protagonist, is a tall, masculine child who at the beginning of Wandering Son is a fifth grader in Shuichi's class. Otherwise known as by their classmates, with an honorific used mainly with boys, Yoshino wishes to be a boy. Yoshino usually refrains from dressing in traditionally feminine clothes, such as skirts or dresses. Despite this, Yoshino's mother insists on buying such clothes for them. Shortly after becoming friends with Shuichi, Yoshino gets a boyish haircut, taking on the appearance of a boy their age, especially when Yoshino is dressed in a male school uniform. Like Shuichi, Yoshino becomes increasingly concerned and resentful about undergoing puberty, such as at the beginning of menstruation or the growth of breasts. Yoshino goes to buy a chest-flattening garment to escape the necessity of wearing a bra. Like Shuichi, Yoshino shows signs indicating gender dysphoria, though later stops thinking that way due to personal exposure to modelling. :Yoshino prefers to dress and act like a boy, but usually abstains from anything which would draw attention, such as going to school in a male uniform after entering junior high. However, Yoshino does on occasion dress in a male school uniform and go to neighboring cities while dressed as a boy; during one such time, Yoshino enjoys being hit on by an older woman. Yoshino wants to look \\"cool\\" and wears clothes which are not girlish. When teased by others, Yoshino is prone to getting emotional and is known to get violent on occasion. Yoshino takes up an interest in basketball after entering junior high school and joins the female basketball team with Chizuru Sarashina. In junior high, Yoshino decides not to get a haircut after a comment by Saori, but later cuts it back to a short, boyish style. Yoshino's family consists of a father, mother, older brother, and older sister. Classmates ; : :Saori, nicknamed , is a girl who is a fifth grader in Shuichi's class at the beginning of Wandering Son. She takes an interest in encouraging Shuichi to cross-dress, even going so far as to buy Shuichi an expensive dress as a birthday gift, which Shuichi later returns, much to her displeasure. Saori finds it difficult to associate with others; she has few friends, though becomes close to Shuichi. She tends to convey what is on her mind and disregards how others may take what she says. As Saori grows up, she gradually becomes more standoffish and stoic; she even has bad relations with her teachers. Despite her self-centered attitude, she remains popular among her male classmates due to her physical attractiveness. She is a sensitive girl whose temper sometimes gets the better of her when reprimanding bullies that tease Shuichi, because of the latter's femininity and cross- dressing. Saori is often emotionally affected by circumstances involving Shuichi, because of her feelings for the latter. Saori converts to Christianity partly because of this influence of to seek forgiveness for her previous actions, though she only attends mass when feeling guilty about her behavior. ; : :Kanako Sasa, usually referred to by her surname, is a girl who is a fifth grader in Shuichi's class at the beginning of Wandering Son. She is sometimes called by her younger brother and Chizuru. She makes her first appearance in chapter two of the manga, but is not named until volume two. She is a short, energetic girl who thinks of herself as everyone's friend and becomes distressed when her friends fight among themselves. Sasa acts as a mediator between her friends in such times and tries not to leave anyone alone. She has been friends with Yoshino since pre-school, and later becomes close with Chizuru. Sasa is an innocent, childish girl who does not have many worries aside from her friends' quarrels. She tends to be a handful for her mother, who picks out her clothes for her and even helps her get ready for school in the morning. She mentions that if she thinks too hard about something, her brain becomes itchy. ; : :Makoto first appears when the cast is in sixth grade, though is in a different class. Known as Mako for short, though mostly only to Shuichi, Makoto is also a trans girl; it is this desire that spurs Makoto to become Shuichi's closest friend. Due to facial freckles and round glasses, Makoto is not able to appear as cute as Shuichi when wearing feminine clothes. Makoto is a romantic who wants to be in a relationship with a cool, adult man. Makoto is unusually mature and is able to think calmly and objectively while providing advice to friends. Makoto also gets along well with boys and girls of the same age, because of good listening skills, and often becomes an onlooker to what is going on in other characters' lives. Makoto is an only child whose parents run a bakery. ; : : Chizuru, nicknamed Chii-chan, is a tall girl who first appears as a classmate of Shuichi when they both enter junior high school. She is Momoko's childhood friend, and has a stylish demeanor, highlighted by her stature and long hair, which captivates both Shuichi and Yoshino when they first meet her. Chizuru is described as a free spirit, someone who enjoys doing unconventional, often outrageous things which surprise those around her; she frequently acts without thinking, and as a result projects a childish personality. Her impulsive behavior sometimes gets her in trouble with other characters, but she quickly becomes ashamed when she realizes the consequences. She tries to be everyone's friend, though Saori strongly dislikes her impulsiveness. Chizuru joins the girls' basketball team in junior high. Her family runs a soba restaurant. ; : : Momoko is a childhood friend and classmate of Chizuru in junior high school; she is nicknamed Momo. She constantly hangs around Chizuru and is visibly annoyed when Chizuru socializes with others, or even if someone simply sits too close to her. Momoko inevitably starts fighting Saori, who does not particularly respect Chizuru, when they talk. Others ; : : Maho is Shuichi's sister. She is one year older than Shuichi is, and at the beginning of Wandering Son, she is in the sixth grade of elementary school. Maho shows a strong interest in clothes, and spends much of her money on new apparel. She is a big fan of a teen fashion model named Maiko, and to meet her, Maho auditions for the same modeling agency as Maiko. After she is hired and becomes recognized as a model, Maho enjoys being asked her autograph by complete strangers. While her modeling career initially starts out slowly, Maho soon gains confidence in her abilities, and becomes friends with Maiko and two other models, Anna Suehiro and Tamaki Satō. In contrast to her younger sibling, Maho is very out-spoken and tends to be rough with Shuichi, even hitting or slapping Shuichi on occasion, and she often forces things on Shuichi with little consideration of Shuichi's opinion. She does not like Shuichi's cross-dressing and gets angry and disturbed when she finds Shuichi dressed as a girl. In junior high school, Maho becomes attracted to her classmate Riku Seya, and eventually starts dating him. ; : : Riku Seya, usually referred to by his surname, is a classmate of Maho's who meets her when they enter junior high school. He is generally a soft-spoken boy who initially takes an interest in Shuichi, whom he believes to be a girl, when they first meet. When he learns that Shuichi is assigned male, Seya becomes angry at Maho for hiding this and stringing him along, but he soon reconciles with her and eventually starts dating her. Seya remains polite with Shuichi, though due to their initial meeting, there is always some awkwardness between the two. ; : : Anna is a teen model who is a good friend of Maiko and goes to the same all-girl school as her; she is similarly well-known and experienced in modeling. She is considered outspoken and sharp-tongued by other models. Anna at first disapproves of Shuichi dressing as a girl, and even calls Shuichi a freak soon after meeting Shuichi. Anna initially tells Maho she has no interest in her \\"weak\\" sibling because of Shuichi's femininity, though later dates Shuichi for a time after Shuichi asks her out, until she breaks up with Shuichi. However, the two soon resume their relationship with each other. Furthermore, Anna's opinion of Shuichi presenting as female also changes, she saying that it actually suits Shuichi, and the two even go out together on a date with Shuichi dressed as a girl. She feels Shuichi is an interesting person, and once says Shuichi is like a cute little sister. Anna spends much money on clothes, and enjoys modifying them. ; : : Yuki, born , is a tall and attractive trans woman living with her boyfriend Shiina. She takes an early interest in Yoshino when she believes Yoshino to be a boy, though remains on good terms with Yoshino even after learning of Yoshino's assigned sex, and gives Shuichi and Yoshino helpful advice when they are troubled. Despite the differences between their situations, Yuki sees much of herself in Shuichi: when they were growing up, Shiina was the only friend who stood by the young Hiroyuki, as she was called then, while girls teased her and the boys bullied her to change. Yuki always keeps up a positive attitude, and runs a gay bar. Since her transition, she has not been on good terms with her parents, who run a uniform store. : Yuki is the main character of Takako Shimura's short story , in the collection , in which her family—which consists of her father, mother, brother, and sister-in-law—also appears; Yuki is revealed to be a fan of Keiji Sada, a Shōwa period actor. ; : :Shiina, given name unknown, otherwise referred to by his nickname , is another adult friend of Shuichi and Yoshino. He was Yuki's classmate in elementary school, and he eventually became her boyfriend after her transition. Unlike Yuki, Shiina had many friends in school. He generally just watches over Shuichi and Yoshino with Yuki, but he sometimes does bold and unexpected things, such as grabbing Yoshino's crotch when he first meets Yoshino because he feared that, because Yoshino was dressed as a boy at the time, Yuki might be having an illicit affair with Yoshino. ; : : Fumiya is a talkative boy one year older than Saori whom she meets when she starts going to church. Saori is easily annoyed by him, especially when he brings her flowers from his parents' flower shop. He takes an early interest in Saori and tries to become her boyfriend. After meeting Shuichi, Fumiya becomes jealous of Saori's interest in Shuichi, and finds Shuichi's cross-dressing gross. While initially lying to Saori and Shuichi about having an interest in cross-dressing, he is later seen dressed as a girl while out with Shuichi, and again at the cultural festival at Shuichi's school. Fumiya enjoys the added attention that comes from cross- dressing and admits that he likes being called cute. ; : : Shinpei is a classmate of Shuichi. He tends to be confident in himself and in his opinions. In junior high school, he often bullies Shuichi for a perceived lack of masculinity, but he has a change of heart once in high school after meeting Yuki. His admiration and gradual approval of Shuichi presenting as a girl tempers his overbearing attitude, and he tries to befriend Shuichi, attempting to apologize for his past conduct. He even begins encouraging Shuichi to come to school dressed as a girl. ; : : Maiko is a classmate and best friend of Anna Suehiro. She is a singer and model. She has a large fan base among Shuichi's classmates. Production In an interview in August 2003, Takako Shimura stated that the theme of Wandering Son is similar to the second half of her previous manga series Shikii no Jūnin. Shimura took the junior high school teacher Kentarō Kaneda from Shikii no Jūnin and inserted him into Wandering Son, where he teaches at Shuichi's junior high school, because she really liked his character. Shimura originally planned to use a female high school student who wants to become a boy as the main character. However, she realized that a boy who wants to become a girl before entering into puberty would have many worries related to growing up, and changed the story accordingly. Shimura used her realization that the boy would go through significant changes as he grew up to deepen the development of the story and characters. The Japanese title, Hōrō Musuko, is a pun on , meaning \\"prodigal son\\". Shimura mainly found her characters' names by looking through name dictionaries, although she also took the names of acquaintances and slightly changed them, and even used train station names for side characters appearing only once. Out of all the characters, Shimura is most pleased with Kanako Sasa. For the designs of clothes for the female characters, Shimura consulted various fashion magazines for girls in their early teens, especially Nicola. Shimura commented self-deprecatingly in the afterword of volume one that, like her other series, her characters do not look very different from each other, her panels are too white, and there is much pathos. Media Manga The manga Wandering Son is written and illustrated by Takako Shimura. It was serialized in the monthly seinen (aimed at younger adult men) manga magazine Comic Beam from the December 2002 to August 2013 issue. The individual chapters were collected and published in 15 tankōbon volumes by Enterbrain from July 25, 2003 to August 28, 2013.

The series is licensed in English by Fantagraphics Books, which began releasing the series in North America in hardcover format starting with the first volume on July 5, 2011. Gary Groth of Fantagraphics Books said in an interview he licensed Wandering Son because \\"it's not a typical choice for a manga title published in the U.S. and it's not typical subject matter for comics in general,\\" saying that the subject is \\"perfectly legitimate ... for literature—or comics.\\" Although Fantagraphics Books released eight volumes by June 2015, the release of further volumes was hampered by low sales. The series is also licensed by Ever Glory Publishing in Taiwan and by Haksan Culture Company in Korea. Anime A 12-episode anime television series adaptation produced by AIC Classic and Aniplex aired in Japan between January 13 and March 31, 2011 on Fuji TV's Noitamina programming block.

Following the arrest of Ai Takabe, the voice actress who played Maiko, for drug possession in October 2015, Bandai Channel removed the series from its streaming catalog. The anime adapts the story from the point where the characters enter junior high school. The anime is directed by Ei Aoki and the screenplay was written by Mari Okada. Chief animator Ryūichi Makino based the character design used in the anime on Takako Shimura's original concept and the main animator is Michio Satō.

The anime's opening theme song is by Daisuke and the single was released on March 2, 2011. The ending theme is \\"For You\\" by Rie fu and the single was released on February 16, 2011. The original soundtrack was released on August 24, 2011. Reception It was reported in June 2013 that approximately 1.05 million copies of the manga are in print in Japan. Wandering Son was selected as a recommended work by the awards jury of the tenth Japan Media Arts Festival in 2006. The Young Adult Library Services Association nominated Wandering Son for its 2012 Great Graphic Novels for Teens list. The anime was awarded the honorable mention prize for technical achievement in broadcast animation at the 65th Motion Picture and Television Engineering Society of Japan Awards in 2012. In a review of the first volume by Rebecca Silverman of Anime News Network (ANN), she praised the slow pace of the storytelling, which \\"gives it a more realistic feel.\\" Silverman praises Takako Shimura for making Shuichi into a \\"human protagonist\\", but notes that \\"most of the children act much older than they are.\\" The second volume was featured in ANN's Right Turn Only column in March 2007 as the Import of the Month, where Carlo Santos lauded the series for using gender reversal as the \\"actual heart of the story\\" in contrast to \\"every other series\\" involving cross-dressing, which use \\"gender reversal as a goofy plot device.\\" The art was praised as \\"simple [with] few lines, but incredibly expressive\\" which Santos claimed is a \\"style that's the most difficult and beautiful of all.\\" Santos criticized the \\"emotional realism\\" of the work for having the young characters' \\"unrealistically mature attitude\\" towards \\"issues above their grade level.\\" Rachel Matt Thorn, the English translator of the manga, wrote that fans of Anne of Green Gables or The Rose of Versailles would also enjoy Wandering Son, and Silverman compared Wandering Son to Mizuiro Jidai. Thorn described the art as \\"clean and lovely\\" and went on to cite Wandering Son as \\"sweet, thought-provoking, funny, and moving, and I think it will resonate with readers regardless of their gender identity or sexual orientation.\\" The first manga volume as translated by Fantagraphics Books had an early debut at the May 2011 Toronto Comic Arts Festival and sold out within the first two hours of the event. In a 2019 Forbes article about the best anime of the 2010s decade, Lauren Orsini considered it to be one of the five best anime of 2011 and called it \\"A breakout show in the transgender drama genre\\". Orsini praised the \\"delicate, watercolor-like art\\" and how the story is \\"treated with empathy and kindness\\", but \\"at the same time, it's far from a lecture; its focus on characters keeps it as entertaining as it is enlightening\\".

In 1922-23 he was a member of the New Orleans Rhythm Kings, then led his own band, known variously as the Midway Gardens Orchestra, the Original Memphis Melody Boys and the Chicago Blues Dance Orchestra, before joining Isham Jones in 1925. After returning to Chicago he played with Louis Panico and Art Kassel, and arranged for the Melrose Publishing House. In the 1930s Schoebel wrote and arranged, working as the chief arranger for the Warner Brothers publishing division. From the 1940s onward he did some performing with Conrad Janis, Blue Steele's Rhythm Rebels (1958), and with his own ensembles in St. Petersburg, Florida. He continued to play up until his death.

In order for this generator to be secure, the prime number p needs to be large enough so that computing discrete logarithms modulo p is infeasible. To be more precise, any method that predicts the numbers generated will lead to an algorithm that solves the discrete logarithm problem for that prime. There is a paper discussing possible examples of the quantum permanent compromise attack to the Blum–Micali construction.

It won the César Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, and was nominated for Best Film, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress, Best Director, Best Writing and Best Editing.  Plot  Naive schoolgirl Camille Pelleveau meets the slightly older and more experienced Joëlle, a promiscuous woman who has just been thrown out of a car by her abusive boyfriend. Camille follows Joëlle as they go on a rampage where she discovers sex as they pick up men. Joëlle also shows Camille the darker side of life, as they start by crashing the men's cars and then decide to take on the whole town. However, medical researcher Dr. Marc Antoine Worms has invented a sexually transmitted disease and used Joëlle as a guinea pig by infecting her with it, so that he could become famous as the discoverer of its cure. Camille eventually learns about AIDS and fears she may have contracted the disease. The story involves flashbacks, and in one sequence we learn that Camille's parents are feuding. Illogically, she tries to persuade them to reunite long enough for her conception to take place. The surreal plot and series of stylized scenes is in keeping with postmodern cinema, which challenges the notion of original creative thought.

He mastered the traditional bardic metres and, although forced by circumstances to be an exile, played an important role in the literary and antiquarian movement in Wales often described as the Welsh Eighteenth Century Renaissance.See, for instance: Prys Morgan, The Eighteenth Century Renaissance (Christopher Davies, Swansea, 1981). A perfectionist who only published reluctantly and whose literary output is consequently relatively small, his work nevertheless had a huge influence on Welsh poetry for several generations and his poetry and tragic life gave him a cult status in Welsh literary circles. Life Owen was born on New Year's Day, 1723, in the parish of Llanfair Mathafarn Eithaf in Anglesey. During his childhood he lived at his ancestral home, \\"Y Dafarn Goch\\". He was later educated at Friars School, Bangor, and Jesus College, Oxford, although he did not remain long at the college. He was admitted to the college as a servitor on 3 June 1742 but, whilst his name remained on the college's books until March 1748 (albeit with some omissions), he only resided in the college for about one week in the Midsummer Term of 1744 and incurred a debt of 15s 1d which was never paid. In January 1746 he was ordained and served for a time as curate of St Mary's Church, Llanfair Mathafarn Eithaf. As a young man, he left Anglesey for the last time, wandering to Denbighshire; to Oswestry where he was made a master at Oswestry School and curate of nearby Selattyn in 1746; he was master of the grammar school at Donnington and curate of nearby Uppington close to Shrewsbury from 1748 to 1753; he then moved to Walton, Liverpool and then to Northolt, Middlesex. In November 1757, he emigrated, together with his young family, to take a post at the College of William & Mary, Virginia. Although he did not stay in that post for long, he remained in Virginia until his death in July 1769. The town of Benllech in Anglesey named its village hall and its primary school, Ysgol Goronwy Owen, in his honour. Work Owen was mostly noted as an émigré bard, writing with hiraeth (\\"longing\\") for his native Anglesey. He learnt much of his poetic craft from Lewis Morris, a fellow Anglesey man who, with his brothers and others, was a key figure in the Welsh literary circle referred to by Saunders Lewis as a \\"school of Welsh Augustans\\".Saunders Lewis, A School of Welsh Augustans (Cardiff, 1924; reprinted by Cedric Chivers, Bath, 1969).

It flies General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper and RQ-170 Sentinel Unmanned aerial vehicles. The group operates unmanned reconnaissance aircraft which provide real-time reconnaissance, surveillance, and precision attack against fixed and time-critical targets. The 432d Air Expeditionary Wing is a provisional unit assigned to Air Combat Command and is the designation for components of the 432d Wing when deployed into combat areas as part of the Global War on Terror. Overview The wing is the first United States Air Force wing dedicated to unmanned aircraft systems: MQ-9 Reaper and RQ-170 Sentinel. The wing stood up 1 May 2007 at Creech Air Force Base, Nevada. The wing has dual reporting responsibilities to Ninth Air Force and U.S. Air Forces Central Command (USAFCENT) (as the 432d AEW) at Shaw Air Force Base, South Carolina, as well as to Twelfth Air Force and U.S. Air Forces Southern Command at Davis–Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona. The wing has flown intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions in Operations Enduring and for the War in Iraq, flown by pilots and sensor operators in the United States. The 432d is authorized 160 Predator and 60 Reapers. As of May 2007, 6 Reapers and about 85 Predators have been delivered with half of the Predators deployed forward in the United States Central Command area of operations. The wing is expected to fly 12 combat air mission in Iraq and Afghanistan each day. Units The wing includes two operations groups and a maintenance group. * 432d Operations Group : 11th Attack Squadron - MQ-9 Reaper : 15th Attack Squadron - MQ-9 Reaper : 42d Attack Squadron - MQ-9 Reaper : 89th Attack Squadron - MQ-9 Reaper : 432d Operations Support Squadron : 489th Attack Squadron - MQ-9 Reaper * 732d Operations Group : 17th Attack Squadron - MQ-9 Reaper : 22d Attack Squadron - MQ-9 Reaper : 30th Reconnaissance Squadron - RQ-170 Sentinel : 44th Reconnaissance Squadron - MQ-9 Reaper : 867th Attack Squadron - MQ-9 Reaper * 432d Maintenance Group : 432d Aircraft Maintenance Squadron : 432d Aircraft Communications Maintenance Squadron : 432d Maintenance Squadron * 25th Attack Group : 20th Attack Squadron : 50th Attack Squadron : 482d Attack Squadron History World War II The 432d Observation Group was activated on 22 February 1943. It served as the operational training unit (OTU) of the USAAF School of Applied Tactics at Keystone Army Air Field, Florida. The group trained and provided reconnaissance to assist fighter, bombardment, and ground units with their training. Aircraft included Bell P-39 Airacobra fighter and Aeronca L-3 Grasshopper light observation aircraft. The group was disbanded on 1 November 1943. Tactical Air Command Martin RB-57A-MA AF Serial No. 52-1457 of the 43d Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron. This aircraft is currently on static display at the Museum of Aviation, Robins AFB, Georgia. On 23 March 1953, the 432d Tactical Reconnaissance Group was activated at Shaw Air Force Base, South Carolina. The new group's mission was to assume the reconnaissance training mission previously carried out by the 363d Tactical Reconnaissance Wing. The group initially conducted training with two squadrons (20th, 29th) flying the Republic RF-84F Thunderflash and two squadrons (41st, 43d) flying the Martin RB-57A Canberra. In 1957, the group upgraded the 20th and 29th to the McDonnell RF-101C Voodoo, and the 41st and 43d transitioned to the electronic warfare Douglas EB-66 Destroyer. When elevated to the 432d Tactical Reconnaissance Wing on 8 February 1958, the wing operated the USAF Advanced Flying Training School, Tactical Reconnaissance. With the elevation to wing status, the 432d TFW was realigned to a four squadron RF-101C wing (17th, 18th, 20th, 29th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadrons). From 8 February 1958 to 18 June 1959 the wing was supervised by the 837th Air Division. To reduce costs, the 432d TRW was inactivated on 8 April 1959. The RF-101C equipped 17th and 18th TRSs were deployed to NATO, being reassigned to the 66th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing at Laon-Couvron Air Base, France and the 20th and 29th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadrons continued their training missions under the 363d TRW.McAuliffe, Chapter 13, Laon-Couvron Air Base Vietnam War A 13th TFS F-4D carrying a Pave Sword laser pod, in 1971. RF-4C of the 14th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron McDonnell F-4D-28-MC Phantom II, AF Serial No. 65-0683, of the 555th Tactical Fighter Squadron taken on 20 January 1972. This aircraft was retired to AMARC on 6 May 1988 and scrapped on 2 January 1997.Martin On 18 September 1966, the 432d Tactical Reconnaissance Wing was activated at Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand as a RF-4C Phantom II wing. The wing assumed the personnel, aircraft and equipment of the 6234th Tactical Fighter Wing, which was simultaneously discontinued. At Udon, it became one of the most diversified units of its size in the Air Force. The mission of the wing was to provide intelligence information about hostile forces through tactical reconnaissance and use its fighter elements to destroy the targets earmarked by the intelligence data provided. The wing had numerous missions in the support area. The 432d TRW accounted for more than 80 percent of all reconnaissance activity over North Vietnam. In addition to the reconnaissance mission, the 432d also had a tactical fighter squadron component, with two (13th Tactical Fighter Squadron, 555th Tactical Fighter Squadron) F-4C/D squadrons assigned. The squadrons flew strike missions over North Vietnam and the pilots and weapon systems officers of the 13 TFS and 555 TFS were credited with MiG kills. In 1968, the 7th Airborne Command and Control Squadron, flying specialized Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft, became part of the 432d. The squadron had been attached to the wing as a temporary duty unit from Da Nang Air Base, South Vietnam. Another unit assigned was the 4th Special Operations Squadron flying various (Douglas AC-47 Spooky and Fairchild AC-119 Stinger) gunships that supported ground units.< On 19 March 1969, the wing proposed a new forward air control program to 7th Air Force. Calling for photo reconnaissance in conjunction with Fast FACs, it offered the advantage of speedier fresher intelligence from aerial photo interpretation. The mission was approved, and the Wing's volunteers were trained by \\"Misty\\" and \\"Stormy\\" FACs. The first combined FAC/photo mission was flown on 26 April 1969. The Fast FAC used call sign \\"Falcon\\"; the photo recce plane used \\"Atlanta\\". The call signs \\"Laredo\\" and \\"Whiplash\\" were also sometimes used. By July, they were asked to augment the efforts of the \\"Tiger\\" FACs in the Operation Barrel Roll area of Laos. While supporting Operation About Face, they improvised mass bombings by 16 to 20 fighter-bombers three times in September 1969. One of these mass raids inflicted heavy casualties on a concentration of about 1,000 communist troops. In November, they discovered 102 new targets; the following month, they found 172 more. To do this, they pressed lower than 4,000 feet altitude. In the last quarter of 1969, 21 of their aircraft suffered battle damage. They were then ordered to remain above 4,500 feet altitude to escape ground fire. Regardless of their operating altitude, their bomb damage assessment record was triple the average for 7th Air Force units.Rowley, pp. 193–194.Schlight, pp. 30–33. In the fall of 1970 the wing was phased down as part of the overall U.S. withdrawal from the Vietnam War; however, in 1972 tactical fighter strength was augmented by deployed Tactical Air Command CONUS-based tactical fighter squadrons being attached to the 432d in response to the North Vietnamese invasion of South Vietnam. In addition, the 421st Tactical Fighter Squadron was reassigned from Takhli Royal Thai Air Force Base. During Operation Linebacker, between May and October 1972, the 432d TRW had seven F-4 tactical fighter squadrons assigned or attached, (13th, 56th, 308th, 414th, 421st, 523d and 555th) making it the largest wing in the USAF. The three Vietnam era Airforce Aces all came from the 432d – two from the 555th and one from the 13th. The CONUS-based squadrons returned to the United States in the fall of 1972. As a result of the Paris Peace Accords of 1973, the numbers of USAF personnel and aircraft at Udorn were reduced. The 421st TFS was inactivated in August and the 555th moved to Luke Air Force Base in 1974. By the spring of 1975, two operational squadrons remained, the 14th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron (RF-4C) and the 13th TFS (F-4D/E). Forces from the 432d participated in the SS Mayaguez action in May 1975, sinking two Cambodian Khmer Rouge ships. By 1975, the political climate between Washington and Bangkok had become sour and the Royal Thai Government wanted the USAF out of Thailand by the end of the year. Palace Lightning was the plan under which the USAF would withdraw its aircraft and personnel from Thailand.Glasser The 423nd TFW was inactivated on 23 December 1975. The 13th TFSs F-4E aircraft and some support personnel were reassigned to the 3d TFW at Clark AB, Philippines and the F-4D aircraft and support personnel to the 18th TFW at Kadena Air Base, Okinawa. The 14th TRS was inactivated and the RF-4Cs were sent to Shaw Air Force Base, South Carolina. The last USAF personnel departed Udorn RTAFB on 8 January 1976.< Tactical Drone Group The 432d was reactivated at Davis–Monthan AFB, Arizona on 1 July 1976 as the 423d Tactical Drone Group. The 432d performed photographic reconnaissance to support tactical air and surface forces with tactical drones. Used AQM-34L/M/V drones, DC-130 launch vehicles, and CH-3 recovery helicopters. The group conducted follow-on testing and evaluation of the AQM-34V model drone and the initial operational testing and evaluation and developmental testing and evaluation of the DC-130H \\"mother ship.\\" The 432d also supported testing and evaluation of the BQM-34C drone at Hill AFB, Utah. The group was inactivated in April 1979. Pacific Air Forces In July 1984 the 432d was again reactivated as the 432d Tactical Fighter Wing at Misawa Air Base, Japan. The 432d controlled two General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon squadrons (13th Fighter Squadron, 14th Fighter Squadron) and the 39th Rescue Squadron, flying the HH-60 \\"Pave Hawk\\" helicopter. The 432d was replaced by the 35th Fighter Wing on 1 October 1994 at Misawa and again became inactive. Air Combat Command The wing was reactivated at Creech Air Force Base, Nevada, on 1 May 2007 as the Air Force's first unmanned aircraft systems wing. It was renamed the 432d Air Expeditionary Wing in May 2008. In support of relief for the victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake, on 27 January 2010 the wing began flying two RQ-1 Predator orbits over Port-au-Prince with six Predators from a training unit flying out of Rafael Hernández Airport, a civilian airport in Puerto Rico, by a detachment of about 50 wing members.Predators send video feeds to help in Haiti, Air Force Times An additional operations group for the wing, the 732nd Operations Group, was constituted on 9 August 2012, and subsequently activated on 10 September 2012. It initially included three reconnaissance squadrons, the 17th, 22nd, and 30th, two of which later became attack squadrons.

The Theban Necropolis, Part 1, Private Tombs, Second Edition, Oxford , pp. 113-119 Tomb TT102 belongs to the royal scribe Imhotep who dates to the reign of Amenhotep III too. Imhotep appears also in tomb TT57 and he is indeed Khaemhat's father. TT102 was perhaps built at the same time as TT57. Tomb TT126 is much later and belongs to a certain Hormose, who might date to the Saite-Period. All three tombs share a courtyard as entrance area. On the West side of this courtyard is the entrance to the cult chapel of Khaemhat, that is cut into the rocks. The facade of the chapel is decorated with stelae and scenes. One stela belongs to a certain Suemmerenhor and is most likely later in date.Robert Mond: Report of work in the necropolis of Thebes during the winter 190301904, in ASAE VI (1905), pl. I, after page 96 oinline Relief decorated tombs became common in the later years of Amenhotep's III reign.  Facade  The facade shows on both sides next to the entrance Khaemhat standing with the back to the entrance. Only the lower part of the figure is preserved. There are long text columns next to the figure. To the right there is a purification scene, showing three figures. Their upper part is lost and also inscriptions that could inform about the identity of these figures. Further on the right there is awell preserved stela. It shows Khaemhat in front of a shrine poring water over it. In the shrine are standing the four sons of Horis. all human headed. There are also depicted Isis, Nephthys, Selket and Neith. Under these figures are shown four canopic jars.

The passage to the hall is on the south side inscribed with a hymn to the sun-god Ra.Victor Loret: La Tombe de Khâ-M-Hâ, in: Gaston Maspero, in: Urbain Bouriant - Victor Loret - H. Dulac (editors): Mémoires publiés par les membres de la mission archéologique française au Caire. Tome premier. Fasc. 1, Paris 1889, p. 115 The depictions in relief in the broad hall are mainly about the life of Khaemhat as overseer of the double granary. Unlike some other tombs of the same period, scenes, such as fishing and fowling do not take much space. Instead, one part of the tomb is mainly dedicated to the relation of the tomb owner to the king.Arielle P. Kozloff: Tomb Decoration: Painting and Relief Sculpture, in: Arielle P. Kozloff, Betsy Bryan, Lawrence M. Berman: Egypt's Dazzling Sun, Amenhotep III and his world, Bloomington 1992, , p. 275  East wall  On the East wall, several agricultural scenes are preserved. They relate to the office of Khaemehat as overseer of the granaries. The scenes are often rather conventional as found in other tombs. They include scenes from ploughing to harvesting. But there are many unusual details, such as a boy taking a break and playing the flute. Farm workers are shown wearing sandals. One man is depicted helping to close a big grain basket. A similar details is found in the tomb of Nebamun, something in other tombs not depicted. On the South side of the entrance Khaemhat is making offerings to the god Amun-Re-Harakhte. There are also shown two rows of freight ships and there is a market scene. Market scenes are not common in New Kingdom tombs. This scene is exceptional as it depicts Nubians as sellers of goods. Three small groups of traders are shown in three registers on the right of the ships. The middle groups is largely destroyed. It seems that the big ships on the left belong to the royal palace and that they were on a mission to Nubia, where they stopped and where single sailors went on land for buying food from local Nubians.Christiana Pino: The Market Scene in the tomb of Khaemehat (TT 57), in: Journal of Egyptian Archaeology, 91 (2005), pp. 95-105 The wall north of the entrance shows again Khaemhat making an offering, in this case to Renenutet, the goddess for the harvest. On the left of this scenes, agricultural activities are depicted. Here, the figure of Khaemhat is occupying two registers. he is holding a staff. In front of him and behind him are shown lower officials in two registers. They are holding measuring cords and scribal equipment. The lowest register shows a chariot. The next scene occupies four register. Here, ploughing and a harvest is shown. Khaemhat is sitting next to a tree and occupies two registers. At the very top on the left is depicted a chariot.  West wall  On the West wall, Khaemhat is shown twice in front of the king. On the Northern part of the wall, the king is sitting on the left in a kiosk at his Sed festival, as the captions says. The sed festival is the celebration of kingship performed after a 30 years reign and then again every three years. The king wears a short wig with a diadem and an Uraeus. In his hands he is holding a flail and a heqa scepter. His throne is decorated and shows the king as a griffin trampling on enemies. Two enemies are also depicted under the seat between the legs of the throne. At the base of the kiosk is depicted a row on nine enemies. Nine is the symbolic number of enemies that Egypt had. The text line before the king says: appearing of the king on the great throne to reward these leaders of Upper and Lower Egypt. In front of the king's kiosk is shown Khaemhat as largest official while there are behind him two rows of officials bowing down to the king. They are shown in a smaller scale. In the most upper, third register two officials receiving awards. The face of the king in this scene was cut out and brought to the Egyptian Museum in Berlin. It is now replaced by a cast. On the Southern part of the West wall, Khaemhat is again depicted in front of the king. The latter is sitting within a kiosk on the right side, looking to the left. The kiosk is richly adorned. At the top there are two rows of Uraei. On top of the roof is shown the upper part of a bull. Four lotus and papyrus shaped columns are supporting this roof. The king wears the blue crown and is holding a flail and heqa-scepter. In his left hand he is also holding the ankh (life) sign. The side of the throne shows again the king as a griffin, trampling on a foreigner. Under the seat of the throne appear two foreigners, bound together at the back. The base of the kiosk is decorated with a row of nine foreigners. The text in the kiosk names the king as Amenhotep III and also calls him Lord of the sed-festival. On the left side is standing Khaemhat presenting to the king a document. The caption before the king reads: Appearing of the king on the great throne, receiving the document of the summer of Upper and Lower Egypt. Today this scene is badly destroyed; the upper half is totally gone.  North and South wall  The scenes on the North, short end of the hall are badly destroyed. Three registers are still visible and they include offerings to the deceased. At the Southern end of the hall, two statues are sculptured into a niche that is carved into the rock. They show Khaemhat and his father Imhotep. The walls of the niche are also decorated and is inscribed with a long offering list. The ceiling of the hall is plain and painted with a pattern and with inscriptions.  Long Hall  The passage from the broad to the long hall features a depiction of Khaemhat standing before Osiris and Isis and before Osiris and Nephthys. In the middle of the western wall there is the entrance leading to the long hall. The long hall proper is mainly dedicated to the Underworld and to funerary rites. The South wall is divided into three registers and shows a funerary procession, boats as well as Osiris and the Western goddess. The Northern wall shows the deceased in the fields of Iaru (the Underworld), the pilgrimage to Abydos is shown.  Inner Hall  The passage to the inner hall is decorated with the spells 110, 112 and 113 from the Book of the Dead. The spells are complete, unlike other tombs of about the same reign where they are presented in a short version.Arielle P. Kozloff: Tomb Decoration: Painting and Relief Sculpture, in: Arielle P. Kozloff, Betsy Bryan, Lawrence M. Berman: Egypt's Dazzling Sun, Amenhotep III and his world, Bloomington 1992, , p. 275 The room itself has at the North, West and South side niches for statues of Khaemhat and his family members. The statue in the northern niche shows Khaemhat and his wife, those in the western one shows Khaemhat and his father Imhotep. Those in the Southern niche shows the tomb owner and a woman.

The right to protest may be a manifestation of the right to freedom of assembly, the right to freedom of association, and the right to freedom of speech. Additionally, protest and restrictions on protest have lasted as long as governments have. Many international treaties contain clear articulations of the right to protest. Such agreements include the 1950 European Convention on Human Rights, especially Articles 9 to 11; and the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, especially Articles 18 to 22. Articles 9 enunciates the \\"right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion.\\"Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and/or International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights Office of the United Nations High Commissioner of Human Rights Article 10 enunciates the \\"right to freedom of expression.\\" Article 11 enunciates the \\"right to freedom of association with others, including the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests.\\" However, in these and other agreements the rights of freedom of assembly, freedom of association, and freedom of speech are subject to certain limitations. For example, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights contains prohibitions on \\"propaganda of war\\" and advocacy of \\"national, racial or religious hatred\\"; and it allows the restriction of the freedom to assembly if it is necessary \\"in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety, public order, the protection of public health or morals or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\\" (Articles 20 and 21) It is important to note that different places have passed their own clarification of these rights. Protesting, however, is not necessarily violent or a threat to the interests of national security or public safety. Nor is it necessarily civil disobedience, when protesting does not involve violating the laws of the state. Protests, even campaigns of nonviolent resistance, or civil resistance, can often have the character (in addition to using nonviolent methods) of positively supporting a democratic and constitutional order. This can happen, for example, when such resistance arises in response to a military coup d'état;Adam Roberts, \\"Civil Resistance to Military Coups\\", Journal of Peace Research, Oslo, vol. 12, no. 1, 1975, pp. 19-36. or in the somewhat similar case of a refusal of the state leadership to surrender office following defeat in an election.

The parish is bordered on the west side by the M5 motorway, on the east by the Birmingham to Bristol main railway line, on the south by the A46 road and on the north by the boundary with Worcestershire.  History  The toponym was first recorded in the 12th century in the form Northihaia, derived from the Old English north and gehæg, meaning \\"northern enclosure\\". Northway was granted to Tewkesbury Abbey in 1107, and in the middle ages Northway was part of the parish of Tewkesbury, but after the dissolution of the monasteries in the 16th century became part of the parish of Ashchurch. Until the 20th century Northway remained a small hamlet. During the Second World War the Dowty Group established a factory in old railway buildings at Northway, and after the war a large housing estate was built north of the works on the site of a war-time camp. More development took place during the 1960s. The residential area lies south-west of the original hamlet. An area of pre-fabricated houses still exists in the estate, although heavily modified and modernised. Additions to the earliest developments have progressed right up to the present day. One newer development, commonly referred to as 'Saxon Park', built upon the former site of a factory that was once a part of Dowty Seals, sparked much controversy as many homes were significantly damaged in the Summer Floods of 2007 despite being less than a year old. Other areas of the parish were hit particularly badly, e.g. Kestrel Way and Sallis Close.

As an artist, his favourite medium was watercolour, but a large number of sketches by him in pencil and other mediums also survive. He was a gifted and extremely prolific artist. Most of his work relates exclusively to Ireland. Throughout his life, he was often commissioned to draw or paint realistic depictions of locations all over Ireland (making many of his works interesting from an Irish historical perspective). Much of this work took place during his time with the Irish Ordnance Survey and particularly the Geological Survey of Ireland. Personal life Born in 1817 and raised in Dublin, Ireland, George Victor Du Noyer, he was the son of Louis Victor Du Noyer (1782–1868) and Margaret Du Bédat (1794–1876), both of Huguenot descent. They had married in 1816. His father, Louis Victor, was a French teacher in Dublin. On 4 January 1858, George Victor Du Noyer married Frances Adélaide Du Bédat (1833–1914). They had five children – William Victor (b. 1859), Fanny (b. April 1864 – d. 2 January 1869), Charlotte Eugéne (b. 20 July 1865), and Henry Westropp and Joseph Du Bédat, twins (b. 18 March 1867). The family lived at Albertville, Sydney Avenue, Blackrock, Co . Dublin, for many years. On 3 January 1869, George Victor Du Noyer died of scarlet fever while on Survey in County Antrim, one day after his daughter Fanny died of the same disease. Du Noyer was buried in Co. Antrim. Throughout his life Du Noyer lived at various addresses in Dublin. However, the nature of his work meant that he was often absent from Dublin for long periods at a time. Career Mid-19th century drawing of the Rock of Cashel, County Tipperary, Ireland, showing geology of the rock outcrop, by Du Noyer. In 1834 he was employed by the Civilian Department of the Irish Ordnance Survey. He remained there for a number of years – during a period when Ireland was being mapped by the Ordnance Survey for the first time. He became a member of the 'Geological Society of Dublin' on 20 November 1843. In October 1848, he became a Temporary Assistant Geologist with the Geological Survey of Ireland. In April 1849, he became an Assistant Geologist with the Survey. In April 1867, Du Noyer became the Geological Survey of Ireland's first District Surveyor and moved to Carrigfergus, Co. Antrim. Du Noyer's art includes works on plants, animals, fish, fossils, geology, maps, landscapes, people, country houses, historic buildings and antiquities, as well as on other subjects. One of his best and most famous works is Killiney Head looking towards Bray, Co. Wicklow, 1866, a landscape in watercolour. When compared with this part of County Dublin today, a remarkable change is noticeable – with what was in Du Noyer's time a rural area having since become part of the city of Dublin. Most of his best work is in the collections of the Geological Survey of Ireland, the Royal Irish Academy, the National Museum of Ireland, the National Botanic Gardens. and the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland. However, his work is also located elsewhere and some is in private collections. Note that prints of his most famous geological sketches can be viewed and purchased at the offices of the Geological Survey of Ireland Du Noyer was a member of the Royal Irish Academy. He was also a member of a number of societies associated with his various fields of interest.

It is under ownership of Cumulus Media, and is simulcast with sister station KIKR AM 1450 Beaumont, Texas. Its studios are located on South Eleventh Street in Beaumont and its transmitter is located south of Vidor, Texas. History KBED was initially proposed by Felix & James Joynt in 1959. The Joynts requested to obtain a construction permit to build a 1 kilowatt daytime broadcasting radio station at 1510 kHz, under the name KWEN Broadcasting on October 26, 1959, which was filed by the Federal Communications Commission the following day. The proposed facility was constructed 3 miles northwest of 16th Street, on U.S. Highway 69 in Port Arthur, receiving a License to Cover on February 20, 1969. The facility was issued its first callsign KCAW, standing for Country And Western, on November 7, 1968. The Joynts would file to modify the location of the transmission site to a location on Texas State Highway 347, .7 miles northwest of 39th Street, which is where the facility signed on from in Port Arthur. That tower now is used as a cell site tower. The transmitter was moved to its current South Vidor location (where its former FM sister KYKR-FM was located) when the FCC approved a power increase from 1,000 watts to the current 5,000 watts on August 1, 1980. Accompanied by the upgrade in ERP, the Community of License was changed to Nederland, as well. The callsign changed to KYKR, along with its FM sister 93.3, in 1974. Eventually, owner Jimmie Joynt sold both the AM and FM to different owners. 1510 saw a couple of different owners (including Clear Channel at one time) including various religious owners. On January 4, 1988, the KYKR tower in South Vidor suffered a massive fire believed to be arson. Both 93.3 FM and 1510 AM transmitters were lost. KYKR struggled with borrowed equipment to make it back on the air at low power and eventually recovered.

Biography Born in San Francisco on November 1, 1874, Duncan was the third of the four children of Joseph Charles Duncan, a banker, and Mary Isadora Gray, the youngest daughter of Thomas Gray, a California state senator. Their other children were Elizabeth, Augustin, and Isadora, a noted dancer, In 1891, at the age of 17, he developed a theory of movement which he called kinematics, \\"a remarkable synthesis of the movements of labor and of daily life.\\"Raymond Duncan Biographical Notes, ca. 1948. In the Raymond Duncan Collection, Syracuse University Special Collections Research Center. He believed that the importance of labor was the development of the worker, not production or earnings. In 1898 he and his family left America and lived for a time in London, Berlin, Athens, and Paris. In 1900 he met the German poet Gusto Graeser in Paris and was deeply impressed by his ideas of natural and simple life. Duncan's theory of movement led him to work particularly closely with his sister Isadora, a noted dancer. Duncan became particularly fond of Greece; he and his Greek wife, Penelope Sikelianos, lived in a villa outside Athens which was furnished in a historically accurate manner, with many of the furnishings handmade by Raymond, whose craftwork included ceramics, weaving, and carpentry. No one was permitted to enter the villa in modern dress, and they themselves dressed in classical Greek attire both at home and abroad (which caused some consternation in 1907 Berlin).\\"WOULD LIVE LIKE ANCIENT GREEKS; Raymond Duncan and His Hellenic Wife Create a Sensation in Berlin.\\" New York Times, July 14, 1907, page C1. In 1909 Raymond and Penelope returned to the United States for a series of performances of classical Greek plays, touring Philadelphia, Chicago, Kansas City, San Francisco, Portland, and other cities. The couple also gave lectures and classes on folk music, weaving, dancing, and Greek music. They then spent several months in the Pacific Northwest with the Klamath Indians. While they were visiting New York in early 1910, their son Menalkas Duncan was taken to the Children's Society by the New York City police when he was found on the street wearing classical attire.\\"BARE LEGGED BOY SHOCKS A POLICEMAN.\\" \\"New York Times\\", January 9, 1910, page 3. In 1911 Duncan and Penelope returned to Paris and founded a school, the Akademia, at 31 Rue de Seine, which offered free courses in their specialty areas of dance, arts, and crafts; they later opened a similar school in London. Both schools were based on the idea of the Platonic Academy and both were \\"an open house for every new effort in theatre, literature, music and art.\\"Raymond Duncan Biographical Notes, ca. 1948. In the Raymond Duncan Collection, Syracuse University Special Collections Research Center. Duncan's ultimate goal was a \\"complete technique of living\\" which, by synthesizing work, the arts, and physical movement, would result in the further development of man. Duncan also wrote poetry and plays, newspapers, and editorials expounding his philosophy of \\"actionalism.\\" He printed his books on his own printing press using a typeface that he designed himself, including La Parole est dans le désert (1920), Poemes de parole torrentielle (1927), L'Amour à Paris (1932), and Etincelles de mon enclume (1957). Duncan's work on his printing press was featured in an interview at the academy for a 1955 documentary by Orson Welles, Around the World with Orson Welles: St.-Germain-des-Prés. At the age of 73, he proposed creating the city of \\"New Paris York\\" at latitude 45N, longitude 36W (in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean) as a symbol of cooperation and inter-cultural communication.\\"Duncan's Utopian City Only a Drop in Ocean.\\" Washington Times-Herald, 14 Feb 1948.

Richard Thompson Wildlife Management Area, one of the richest botanical areas of Virginia's Blue Ridge Mountains, is a Wildlife Management Area (WMA) located primarily in Fauquier County, Virginia, with small encroachments into both Warren and Clarke counties. Description G. Richard Thompson Wildlife Management Area comprises two separate parcels, rising in a series of steep stages to the crest of the Blue Ridge Mountains, which the area's northwestern boundary closely follows. Its northern parcel is adjacent to Sky Meadows State Park. The Appalachian Trail crosses through its boundaries along the crest of the Blue Ridge, and the WMA contains several side trails that provide access to the area. Elevations on the property range from above sea level. A number of streams and unusual spring seeps contained within, as are several outcroppings of rock. Lake Thompson is also found on the property. Flora The area is renowned for an extensive stand of white trillium (Trillium grandiflorum) that blooms each spring. Covering an area of approximately two square miles, this stand of trilliums is reputed to be the largest plant community of its kind in Virginia and perhaps anywhere else in the United States. Other species blooming in these rich woods in early May include showy orchis (Galearis spectabilis), bear corn (Conopholis americana), and yellow lady slippers (Cypripedium parviflorum). In the seepage swamps grow several species that are usually associated with more northern regions or higher elevations of the Appalachians, such as Canada mayflower (Maianthemum canadense). The WMA covers several different habitats, including second-growth deciduous forest, open grassy clearings, and cool seepage swamps at the headwaters of mountain streams. Most of the forests found on the land are hardwoods, but there is some open land at the bottom and near the top of one tract. The remains of formerly cultivated fruit trees may still be seen at the lower portion of the area. File:Large-flowered Trillium - Trillium grandiflorum, G. R.

Location The bunker is in Castel on the northern side of Vazon Bay and is part of a complex of reinforced concrete fortifications built by the Germans on the site of Fort Hommet. Fort Hommet is on a headland that lies north west of St Peter Port on the other side of the Island.Perry's A4 Professional guide to Guernsey, Perry's Ref: 14A1 History Fort Hommet complex of fortifications Fort Hommet was constructed on the Vazon Bay Headland in the late Napoleonic Wars era as part of the anti-French defences although there had been fortifications recorded here as far back as 1680.Channel Island Walks, Cicerone Guide, Paddy Dillon Author Page 156 A Martello tower was built on the site in 1804 with further batteries and a barracks being added later. On 20 October 1941, after the occupation of the Channel Islands, a directive ordered by Adolf Hitler proclaimed that the Islands would be turned into an impregnable reinforced concrete fortress as part of the Atlantic Wall, and the Organisation Todt constructed fortifications round the coast. As part of these plans this restored casemate was one of 21 similar standard constructions of a design type Jäger, built to house 10.5cm K331(f) guns.Hogg, Ian V. German Artillery of World War Two. 2nd corrected edition. Mechanicsville, PA: Stackpole Books, 1997 Four such casemates were installed at Fort Hommet and make up part of Stützpunkt (Strongpoint) Rotenstein. The Jäger casemate being a Series 600 Regelbau construction, named after the Organisation Todt officer who designed it. 1943 construction The construction work began in April 1943 after the completion of a railway link between Vazon and St Peter Port which was the essential link needed for the transportation of the vast quantity of materials required to build the fortifications. The schedule of work consisted of initial site excavations followed by a concrete base poured. Wooden shuttering would then be built and steel reinforcing would be installed in the form of cradles. The concrete would then be poured in a continuous fashion giving each structure its immense strength. Once cured, the shuttering was removed and the bunker was fitted out. The process was carried out in a matter of weeks. Design Looking at the plan and starting at 12 o'clock you have the gun room, at 1 o'clock the spent shell room, 3 - crew room with escape shaft, 5- anti-gas lock with entrance defence, 6- entrance, 7 and 9 - two ammunition rooms, 10 o'clock the ventilation plant. Liberation After the liberation of Guernsey in 1945, the fortifications were stripped of all their fixtures and fittings by both the British Army and the islanders. By the late 1940s all the metal fittings including guns and blast doors were removed for their scrap value. Many of the bunkers including this casemate at Fort Hommet, were buried in an attempt to return the coastal landscape to its pre- war condition. Restoration The Entrance to the Casemate As part of Guernsey's fiftieth liberation celebrations, and part of the project Fortess Guernsey, the States of Guernsey had all the 10.5 cm casemates on the island surveyed with a view to restoring the best example.Island Life, Guernsey Forts and Museums, Fortress Guernsey This casemate was found to be dry and structurally sound although it was just a bare shell. The entrance to the casemate was excavated in April 1993 and restoration work began. The restoration was completed in 1995 and is open to the public on two afternoons from April to October.

It can trace it origin during Portuguese occupation of Malacca. In Malacca, the shrimp is called udang geragau. This dish made up of fermented small shrimps or krill. It is usually served as a condiment together with chillis, shallots and lime juice. The shrimp in the pinkish coloured cincalok are readily identifiable and the taste is salty. Sir R. O. Winstedt has written about \\"Cencaluk\\" in Malaysia in his book \\"The Circumstances of Malay Life - 1909\\".The Circumstances of Malay Life, Sir Richard Olof Winstedt, Richard Winstedt, Ams PressInc, 1909 - Social Science - 90 pages This shrimp is available in particular season in Pantai Klebang, Limbongan, Tanjung Kling and several coastal areas. Nowadays, cencaluk making enterprises are gaining ground among the residents in several areas in the state of Melaka. The state government itself has designated the State Legislative Assembly constituency Sungai Udang as the area to produce cencaluk in the 'Satu DUN Satu Produk' plan. Apart from that, cencaluk is also now easily available through open sales such as by the roadside and in the markets around the state. For those who pass the shores of Tanjung Kling to Sungai Udang, you will definitely be able to see a row of stalls selling cencaluk and belacan. The consumption of cincalok has also spread to Riau and West Kalimantan in Indonesia. It is similar to bagoong alamang (see shrimp paste) in the Philippines and khoei chalu () in Thailand. Cincalok manufacturing The process of making cincalok requires several steps. Fresh small prawns (udang geragau) are added with salt and rice in equal proportions. After the ingredients are thoroughly mixed, it will be sealed in a jar and allowed to ferment for three days. There are also cincalok-makers who increase the proportion of rice in the mixture believing it to enhance the taste of the finished product. As the finished product is fermented in a glass container, the fermentation process causes pressure to build up inside the container. Hence, care must be taken when opening the pressurized container containing ready-made cincalok.

Curwen Stars Although Cwmgors RFC did not come into existence until 1927 rugby had been played in the town from 1895. A team called the All Blacks was formed in the town in 1895, this team would later change its name to the Curwen Stars.

Accessed June 5, 2008. also known as François Fejtő, was a Hungarian-born French journalist and political scientist, specializing in Eastern Europe. Biography He was born in Nagykanizsa to a well-off Jewish Hungarian family of booksellers and publishers. Following the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, several members of his family became Yugoslavian, Italian, Czechoslovak and Romanian citizens. He studied literature at Pécs and Budapest universities, alongside Slavic, German and Italian students. In 1932, he was condemned to a year in prison for organizing a Marxist study group. In 1934, he enrolled in the Social Democratic Party, where he contributed to the Népszava daily and to the Szocializmus journal. In 1935, together with the poet Attila József and the publicist Pál Ignotus, he founded the anti-fascist and anti-Stalinist literary journal Szép Szó. He published Sartre, Mounier, and Maritain. In 1938, following a sentence of six months in prison for an article criticizing the pro-German stance of the government, he left Hungary for France. During the Second World War, he took part in the French Resistance. In 1945, François Fejtő headed the press department of the Hungarian embassy in Paris. He resigned his position in protest against the condemnation of his longtime friend László Rajk, and cut all links with Hungary. He returned to his native country only once, for Imre Nagy's national funeral in 1989. After the war, Fejtő attended the Congrès des intellectuels pour la liberté, alongside Raymond Aron, François Bondy, and David Rousset. The publication in 1952 of his book A History of the People's Democracies (translated in seventeen languages and re-edited several times) earned him suspicion on the part of several intellectual figures close to the French Communist Party. Between 1944 and 1979 he worked at the Agence France-Presse as a journalist commenting on Eastern European events. He acquired French citizenship in 1955. Between 1972 and 1984, he taught at the Institut d'études politiques de Paris. In 1973, a jury presided over by Raymond Aron granted him the title of Docteur ès lettres for his literary output. François Fejtő devoted most of his journalistic and literary career to the study of Eastern European regimes. In his lifetime, he observed their birth, growth, decline and fall. He also contributed to numerous French and non-French journals and newspapers, including Esprit, Arguments, Contre-Point, Commentaire, Le Monde, Le Figaro, La Croix, Il Giornale, La Vanguardia, Magyar Hírlap and The European Journal of International Affairs. François Fejtő remains one of the great European intellectual figures of the 20th century. Close friends with Nizan, Mounier and Camus, critical interlocutor of Malraux and Sartre, he met with leaders of the Comintern and the Communist movement, talked to the masters of the Kremlin, to Tito, Castro and Willy Brandt, and both admired and criticized Charles de Gaulle and François Mitterrand. On his death, Hungary declared a period of national mourning.

Career Teaching He joined the University of Waterloo in 1987 and has taught courses pertaining to the cultural history of the Middle Ages, the Renaissance and Enlightenment periods, the 19th century, and also participates in topics including urban history and film history. He is currently Professor of Cultural History in the university's architectural faculty. Holocaust research Van Pelt's Holocaust studies began while he was studying the Temple of Solomon under Renaissance scholar Frances Yates as part of his doctorate. He has stated that he was stunned when he first entered the Auschwitz architectural archive, commenting that the place allows one to imagine what the place looked like during the war and holds a \\"tactile reality\\" as to how the camp was built, and that here, he found his mission. His pursuit of Auschwitz as a point for architectural study arose when he nominated one of the crematoria and gas chamber complexes at Auschwitz-II Birkenau to be included in the University of Virginia architecture classes canon, a decision which he says was controversial among academics there. Van Pelt has also appeared in Errol Morris's Mr. Death: The Rise and Fall of Fred A. Leuchter, Jr., a documentary film about Fred Leuchter where he comments on and criticises Leuchter's methods and findings that constituted Leuchter's report for the defense of Ernst Zündel. In the film, van Pelt offers the analogy that the Nazis were the first Holocaust deniers, because through the obscure euphemisms and terminology they used in reference to their homicidal equipment, they attempted to deny to themselves what they were doing. In the successful defence of Deborah Lipstadt, van Pelt was one of the four Holocaust historians who served as expert witnesses, and he defended the 770-page reportThe Van Pelt Report; Electronic Edition, by Robert Jan van Pelt he produced during five days of cross-examination. His involvement in the trial was included in the 2016 film Denial, in which he was played by British actor Mark Gatiss. Also in 2016, his research into the architecture of Auschwitz was presented in the exhibition Architecture as Evidence at the Venice Biennale and the Canadian Centre for Architecture. Writing Van Pelt has written five books and co-authored two with Debórah Dwork. He has also contributed chapters to twenty books, and has published more than thirty articles. In addition, he has served as an advisor on films and has also contributed in both the physical and dramatical reconstructions in Laurence Rees' Auschwitz: The Nazis and the 'Final Solution' television documentary. He wrote the introduction to the first English-language edition of David Koker's diary. Awards Van Pelt's awards include University of Waterloo Outstanding Professor 2005, the National Jewish Book Award (1996) for Auschwitz: 1270 to the Present, and the Spiro Kostof Award (1997) from the Society of Architectural Historians. He was a 1994-95 fellow of the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation, and was a 2002-04 fellow of the University of Waterloo's faculty of environmental studies.

Based on Chris Hammond's 'Meon' cold-moulded/sheet-plywood catamaran of 1967-8, the original design was bought by Brian Carvill in 1969, modified, renamed Hirondelle, and manufactured in fibreglass by Robert Ives Boatbuilders in Christchurch, England. The boat was marketed as a family weekender with full length sleeping berths for five adults, cooking facilities and a small but useful separate heads (toilet). Hirondelles have an outboard motor as auxiliary power, mounted in a well in the centre of the cockpit. The sailing performance of the Hirondelle was excellent in its day, and is still good for a boat of its size, particularly in Mk I form. Over 300 Hirondelles were sold. There are four types: Hirondelle Mk I - In general the Mk I's had a tall rig, with a mast in excess of , and a high percentage of the boats were home completed. The interior layout usually comprises two generous single quarter berths, a large convertible double (cum table) on the bridgedeck and a single berth forward on the starboard side. To port in the bow is the heads - most boats were fitted with sea toilets and a small stowaway wash basin. The Mk I boat has twin daggerboards and lifting rudders, and the sail area was or 330sq ft with the widely used 150% genoa. Hirondelle Mk II - The important difference between the Hirondelle Mk I and the Mk II was in the rig, with the Mk2 mast being a little under a metre shorter. Some minor interior changes appeared, and the cabin windows became slightly larger with a different shape. In the main the design remained as a safe comfortable family cruiser, with longer distance capability. Hirondelle Mk III - The major change in the Hirondelle Mk III was the introduction of fixed keels and rudders in place of daggerboards and lifting rudders. Although a greater draught made for less ability to ditch crawl the boat gained in strength and many believe it to be much stiffer under sail. More space was also a good point, and a hinged full size chart table was possible, as was a better galley layout. Water tanks could also be sited in the keels. Hirondelle Family - The Hirondelle Family was born as a result of a Hirondelle Mk III owner, David Trotter, and the original designer Chris Hammond, modifying the Mk III moulds. The most important differences were a wider beam (about 600mm extra), more freeboard (allowing more comfort in the cabin), the starboard forward berth was removed and replaced by a larger functional galley, the heads became much bigger and even able to sport a shower, the rudders were underslung (enabling \\"sugar scoop\\" transoms to be used), and windows were installed over the quarter berths. A major improvement in space was also achieved by the new bridge deck nacelle, which allowed more foot room at the central table. An Aero Rig was also fitted to some Hirondelle 'Family' boats in place of the conventional Bermuda sloop configuration.

Overview  RPR deals with failures, incorrect output and performance issues, and its particular strengths are in the diagnosis of ongoing & recurring grey problems. The method comprises: * Core process * Supporting techniques The core process defines a step-by-step approach to problem diagnosis and has three phases: * Discover ** Gather and review existing information ** Reach an agreed understanding * Investigate ** Create and execute a diagnostic data capture plan ** Analyse the results and iterate if necessary ** Identify root cause * Fix ** Translate diagnostic data ** Determine and implement fix ** Confirm root cause addressed The supporting techniques detail how the objectives of the core-process steps are achieved, and cite examples using tools and techniques that are available in every business.  Standards alignment  RPR has been fully aligned with ITIL v3 since RPR 2.01 was released in April 2008. RPR fits directly into the ITIL v3 problem management process as a sub- process. Some organisations handle ongoing recurring problems within incident management, and RPR also fits into the ITIL v3 incident management process as a sub-process. COBIT also defines a problem management process (DS10) with key activity of Perform root cause analysis. RPR is a superset of this step in that it defines a process that covers all of the activities needed to perform Problem investigation & diagnosis, including Root Cause identification. Limitations and considerations RPR has some limitations and considerations, including: * RPR deals with a single symptom at a time * RPR identifies the technical root cause of a problem, it can't be used to identify the non-technical root cause with people, process, etc. * RPR is not a forensic technique and so historical data alone is rarely sufficient * The Investigate phase requires the user to experience the problem one more time  History  The method was originally developed by Advance7 in 1990 as Advanced Network Troubleshooting, with the first fully documented version produced in 1995. Early versions included problem management guidance but this was removed over time as the method became more closely aligned to ITIL, and the method name was changed to Rapid Problem Resolution (RPR). RPR is now focused on Problem Diagnosis based on Root Cause Identification. Due to the highly practical nature of the Supporting Techniques and the ever changing IT landscape, Advance7 continues to develop RPR to keep it relevant to current IT environments. Until November 2007 Advance7 made the RPR material available to its employees only, although a limited number of other IT professionals had been trained in the use of the method. In late 2007 the company announced its intention to make RPR training and material more widely available. In March 2009 the TSO added a significant amount of RPR information to the ITIL Best Practice Live website within the areas dealing with Problem Management. In September 2011, Advance7 published RPR: A Problem Diagnosis Method for IT Professionals which fully describes version 2.03 of the method.

Its source of water is the California State Water Project and it is fed by the California Aqueduct. It is located in the city of Palmdale near the city's southern edge, in the small Anaverde Valley between the San Andreas Fault and the base of Mount Tenhi.  History  Formerly called Harold Reservoir, Lake Palmdale was completed in 1924 to aid local Antelope Valley agriculture by providing a stable and consistent water source for the local farmers. At the time of its completion, agriculture was the primary economic driver in the Palmdale area. This water source was needed due to the rain shadow desert effect that the San Gabriel Mountains have on the Antelope Valley, located in the Mojave Desert. Today the lake serves as the primary water source for the Palmdale Water District, the city's public water utility, and provides water for more than 200,000 people who live in the area. It also is used to generate electricity.  Geography  Lake Palmdale is 2,918 feet (859 m) above sea level and is ringed by the hills of the San Andreas Fault and Mount Tenhi, except for a small pond on the lake's east side called Una Lake from which it is separated by the Palmdale Dam (dike) and Sierra Highway. The lake is 1.05 miles long at its greatest point (northwest to southeast), by 0.50 miles in width (southwest to northeast). Lake Palmdale has a circumference of about 2.5 miles with a surface area of about 260 acres. There is a narrow island 0.25 mi. in length at the southeast end.  Recreation  Lake Palmdale is regularly stocked of fish and has a small pier-like dock that extends about .25 miles (0.4 km) into the lake from which members of the Palmdale Fin & Feather Club may use to fish from or take a small boat onto the lake. There are also many other small docks that run along the southwestern coast of the lake, also for use by the Fin & Feather Club. Use of Palmdale Lake for recreation is generally reserved for members of the Club. The nearby Littlerock Reservoir is a Los Angeles County operated park and is open to the public and can be used for boating, water skiing, fishing, and camping. The California Aqueduct is also open for fishing to the general public as long as they have a valid fishing license from the California Department of Fish and Game.  Weather  Lake Palmdale has very hot, dry summers, breezy springs and autumns, and frigid, highly windy winters. Rainy weather is limited almost completely to the months between October and May. Local rain is not relied on for maintaining the water level. This is done by water flow from the California Aqueduct, which collects and transports rainwater and snowmelt from the mountains of Northern California. The alignment of the local hills and the fault creates a sort of wind tunnel effect on the lake during the winter months. Although the lake is high elevation and winter temperatures drop frequently below freezing 32 °F (0 °C), there has been no known freezing over of the lake in its history.

Early life Umberto was born in Turin, the fourth son of Prince Amadeo of Savoy, Duke of Aosta, the only one by his second wife and niece Princess Maria Letizia Bonaparte (1866–1926) the daughter of Prince Napoléon and Princess Maria Clotilde of Savoy. His father, a former king of Spain, died when he was just a year old. He had three older half-brothers: the Duke of Aosta, the Count of Turin and the Duke of the Abruzzi. In 1908 Umberto began studies at the Naval Academy in Livorno. In May 1911, while still at the academy, he was accused of theft. His cousin King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy wanted him arrested, but his mother took him to Turin and challenged the king to carry out the arrest. In July Victor Emmanuel ordered that he be detained at the Castle of Moncalieri and then spend eighteen months aboard a man-of-war, during which time a Carabinieri colonel would act as his tutor and keeper. First World War and death During the First World War Umberto volunteered to serve in the Royal Italian Army. He joined the army as a lieutenant and served in a Catania cavalry regiment. During the war he was awarded a silver medal for bravery displayed while acting as a bombing officer. Umberto died a month before the end of the war.

Its studios are located on South Eleventh Street in Beaumont and its transmitter is located half a mile southeast of the studios. History KIKR received its license as KAYC on June 21, 1962 and was owned by Texas Coast Broadcasters, Inc. It was once the AM sister to KAYD 97.5 FM hence KAY-C and KAY-D. 1450 was originally licensed as KRIC in the 1940s. The FM, (then KRIC-FM) was originally 99.5 but was moved to 97.5 in a swap with Lake Charles, La due to the second harmonic of 99.5 falling in the middle of TV channel 11. At the time, there were no TV stations on in Beaumont and KHOU, then KGUL, was on the air with CBS from a tower north of Galveston island. Viewers in the Beaumont area trying to watch it could not, due to the interference. After numerous complaints were lodged, the FCC swapped 99.5 for 97.5 and the problem went away. KRIC-FM, now KFNC, is one of the oldest FMs in Texas on the current 88-108 MHz band. In the 1962 - 1980, KAY-C was a Top 40 powerhouse with local legend Al Caldwell in the mornings, a variety of med-day personalities, and Paul King (Box) doing afternoons for 8 years.

Built with funds appropriated under the New Deal, the building was completed in 1937. It is named for Henry Hardin Cherry, who founded the Bowling Green Normal School, the forerunner of the modern university. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. History The idea for the construction of Henry Hardin Cherry Hall (or Cherry Hall for short) was formulated by Louisville architect Brinton B. Davis. Nicknamed \\"the hill builder,\\" Davis had designed a majority of the buildings at what became Western Kentucky University prior to that time. His plan was to use funds appropriated through the Public Works Administration to make improvements to the campus and expand classroom space. The crown jewel of the university, Cherry Hall was completed in 1937. Located at the intersection of College and 15th Streets, the building contained space for fifty classrooms, sixteen laboratories and sixty offices. At the time of its construction, Cherry also housed the campus bookstore and post office. The building contains three floors, as well as a basement which provides extra office and classroom space. The hall was named after Dr. Cherry, who died shortly after the completion of the building. Modern usage As the university expanded over the years, the usage of Cherry Hall was modified. Over time, the post office and bookstore moved to different buildings on campus, while the construction of the Kelly Thompson Complex for Science facilitated the removal of the laboratory space from Cherry Hall. The former laboratories were subsequently converted into more classroom space. Cherry Hall currently serves as the locations of the Departments of English, History, Religion, Philosophy and University Experience. It also provides the headquarters of the WKU Forensics Team, a prominent club that has won numerous national competitions. In April 2006, the lower floors of Cherry Hall were damaged by a fire, which was determined to be arson. The damage to the hall was repaired and classes resumed in the facility the next semester. Four teenagers were arrested for the crime the following June. Symbolism Cherry Hall provides a good deal of the symbolism associated with Western Kentucky University. The belltower atop the hall is part of the current logo of the school. The 25 chimes in the belltower cupola play once every fifteen minutes, to signal the time in order to aid students in keeping up with classtimes. At the top of every hour, the chimes play a longer tune to signal the new hour. References External links *Hill Builder-Cherry Hall *WKU Dept. Of English *WKU Dept. Of History *WKU Dept.

Known for scoring a header while playing for Bangu over Fluminense, in the final minutes of extra time during the 2002 Campenato Carioca semifinal, however, the goal was controversially invalidated. Eduardo would score again in 2003, this time for Atlético-MG. He is one of the most capped goalkeepers for Náutico, playing for the club between 2006 and 2009. Club career Eduardo made his senior debut for Portuguesa from Ilha do Governador. After a brief stint at Anápolis in 1998, he moved to Bangu, thanks to his agents and recommended by coach Alfredo Sampaio. He was one of the top players of the Moça Bonita team during the Torneio Rio-São Paulo and the 2002 Campeonato Carioca. During the semifinals, Bangu and Fluminense were even during the 90 minutes at Maracanã, leading the game to extra time. As a tie would benefit Fluminense, Eduardo went up the field during the final moments of extra time, he would score the game-winning goal after a free kick from Zada. But match official Reinaldo Ribas invalidated the legal goal, claiming a handball foul. The referee's decision caused many complaints from Bangu players. Eduardo was sent off, there was turmoil and intervention by the military police, and in the end, the Bangu team refused to play the remainder of the match, at the behest of then president, Rubem Lopes. \\"The referee doesn't even know what his decision was. First he said I scored with my hand, then he went back and scored an attacking foul. There was neither one nor the other. I got knee'd on the back, the ball hit my head and got into the net \\", said the goalkeeper, at the time, to a local newspaper.  Atlético Mineiro  On 15 May, Eduardo signed a five-year deal with Atlético Mineiro, joining the Minas Gerais club at the end of the Campeonato Carioca. He was expected to battle for the second-string spot with Edmar, while starter Velloso was recovering from surgery on his left shoulder. Edmar ultimately was named the starter for the first league match. Eduardo makes his Galo debut on August 25, replacing Edmar during half-time of the 4-0 away win against Palmeiras. He went on to make 28 appearances during the 2002 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A. As Velloso recovers from injury, Eduardo remains at the Belo Horizonte side for the following season as the second-choice keeper, managing six league appearances and keeping a clean sheet against local rivals Cruzeiro in a 0-0 draw. On 23 July, Eduardo scored the game-winning goal as Atlético-MG beat Juventude 2-1. The goal was a header in the final moments of the game, as he went up during a corner kick. Following another shoulder injury to Velloso, Eduardo took the starting spot for the 2004 season. During the derby against Cruzeiro, in the 2004 Campeonato Mineiro finals, Eduardo got into a brawl with Cruzeiro defender Cris, which got him a 120-day suspension. In July 2004, Eduardo lost his starting position to new acquisition Danrlei, after struggling to regain form and being criticized by the fans and manager Jair Picerni. He would have another chance as a starter in the 4-0 victory over Paraná, in on 29 July, which would turn out to be his last game for Atlético. Seeking more playing time in a big club, Eduardo is loaned to Grêmio for the 2005 season, in exchange for right-back George Lucas. Despite being named the first-choice goalkeeper for the year, Eduardo was not accepted by the majority of the fans, who wanted Márcio, the previous year's starter, to take back his place. In May 2005, after only five months, Eduardo resigns from the club due to cricticism from the ultras. Less than two weeks after leaving Grêmio, Eduardo signs for Brasiliense. He makes his debut on 25 June in a 4-3 away win against Flamengo. Following a string of poor play that culminated with mistakes in two of the three goals suffered in the 2-3 defeat to Corinthians, Eduardo got benched in favour of França on October, staying out of the starting lineup for the next two league games. With the team already relegated, Eduardo was released before the last round of the championship.  Náutico  In May 2006, Eduardo signed a one-year deal with Náutico. He made his debut in the Série B on 20 May in a 2-1 win over Ceará at Aflitos. Eduardo went on to establish himself as the starter for the remainder of the season, helping the club to achieve promotion and keeping nine clean sheets in 33 matches. He left for America to play in the 2007 Cariocão. On 5 July 2007, Eduardo returned to Náutico to be the starter goalkeeper, as Fabiano was down with an injury. He was benched in favor of youth academy product Rodolpho for two Brasileirão games. After the youngster conceded four goals in a home defeat to Cruzeiro, Eduardo was named the starter for the following match. On 22 July, he kept a clean sheet on his Náutico return in a 3-0 win away to Corinthians. Eduardo made 15 consecutive appearances for Timbu, before his season was cut short due to a knee surgery. Eduardo regained his first-team spot for the 2008 season, playing in all but two matches in that year's Brasileirão. He was dropped due to poor form for one match, against Grêmio on 24 August, being replaced by André Sangalli, and was suspended for the fixture against São Paulo after accumulating three yellow cards. He agreed to a deal that would keep him on the Recife side until 2010. Throughout the 2009 Série A, Eduardo struggled to stay in form, eventually being benched in favor of Glédson after 13 league appearances. Eduardo was relegated to third-choice behing Glédson and André Sangalli. He left Náutico at the end of that season, with one year remaining on his contract, ending his tenure with Timbu after being capped at 152 matches.  Brasiliense  Ceará manager Paulo César Gusmão signed Eduardo for the 2010 campaign, but the goalkeeper left the club afterl less than a month, failing to make a single appearance. On 18 February, he joins Brasiliense once again, serving as second-choice to Guto. On 11 May, he made his debut in the Série B, coming off the bench as Guto suffered a subluxation in his right shoulder during a 1-1 draw against Santo André. He went on to start in 25 matches during the competition but couldn't keep the team from being relegated to the third division.  Later career  In 2011, Eduardo signs for Resende, appearing in all of the team's 17 matches for the 2011 Campeonato Carioca, in addition to serving as club captain. On 3 May 2011, Eduardo joined newly-promoted Série A side Figueirense as back-up to first choice 'keeper Wilson, signing a one-year contract. However, after just a month at Figueira, Eduardo announces his retirement, after being diagnosed with a heart condition by team doctor Sérgio Parucker.  Managerial career   Duque de Caxias  After an internship period with the likes of Jorginho, Muricy Ramalho and Abel Braga, Eduardo became assistant coach of Duque de Caxias and, in 2012, after Mário Marques left for Goytacaz, he took the helm of Tricolor da Baixada. On 1 March 2012, Duque de Caxias played their first official match under Eduardo, suffering a 2–1 defeat to Macaé. On 10 March 2012, Eduardo won his first Cariocão game at Duque de Caxias with the 1–0 away win over Nova Iguaçu. Duque de Caxias finished fifth in the 2012 Taça Rio Group B, missing out on qualifying for the semifinals.  Resende  Later that year, he was appointed manager at his former club Resende, guiding the team to the Copa Rio semifinals. Eduardo also led Resende to the 2013 Taça Rio semifinals before leaving by mutual consent on 6 May 2013.  Duque de Caxias (second stint)  Eduardo was appointed as Head Coach of Duque de Caxias for the second time on 30 July 2013, following the departure of Mário Marques once again. His first Série C match back in charge was a 3–1 home loss against Grêmio Barueri, on 3 August 2013. He went on to have a seven game undefeated streak, leading the club out of the relegatin zone. On 3 October, he got sacked by the board following two league losses against Barueri and Betim. Eduardo's tenure at Duque de Caxias ended controversially as the club board argued that player agency BRFoot, which owned the rights of some Duque de Caxias players, offered to pay the team an undisclosed sum of money if Duque de Caxias escaped relegation. The agreement would only be valid, however, if assistant manager Milton Júnior would take Eduardo's place. A little less than a year later, the agency company denied the information.  Gama  On 25 October 2013, Eduardo joined Gama as manager for the 2014 Campeonato Brasiliense. His first match in charge was a 1–0 home defeat against Luziânia. Eduardo resigns from his post at the end of the competition, as he couldn't take the team to the title, losing to Sobradinho in the quarter-finals.  Duque de Caxias (third stint)  On 18 April 2014, it was announced that Eduardo would be appointed for a third spell in charge at Duque de Caxias following the departure of Sérgio Farias. However, after failing to earn a single point in his first three Série C games, he resigns from the club on 14 May.  Nova Iguaçu  On 27 October 2014, Eduardo was appointed first team manager of Nova Iguaçu. He started his Carrossel da Baixada career with a 1–1 away state league draw with Tigres do Brasil. He left the club after six consecutive defeats.

The fat rabbit or chubby rabbit has c at the root of 1/3-limb of the Mandelbrot set. It has a parabolic fixed point with 3 petals.Note on dynamically stable perturbations of parabolics by Tomoki Kawahira Forms of the complex quadratic map There are two common forms for the complex quadratic map \\\\mathcal M. The first, also called the complex logistic map, is written as :z_{n+1} = \\\\mathcal M z_n = \\\\gamma z_n \\\\left(1 - z_n\\\\right), where z is a complex variable and \\\\gamma is a complex parameter. The second common form is :w_{n+1} = \\\\mathcal M w_n = w_n^2 - \\\\mu. Here w is a complex variable and \\\\mu is a complex parameter. The variables z and w are related by the equation :z = -\\\\frac{w}{\\\\gamma}+\\\\frac{1}{2}, and the parameters \\\\gamma and \\\\mu are related by the equations :\\\\mu = \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\gamma-1}{2}\\\\right)^2 - \\\\frac{1}{4} \\\\quad,\\\\quad \\\\gamma = 1 \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{1 + 4\\\\mu}. Note that \\\\mu is invariant under the substitution \\\\gamma \\\\to 2 - \\\\gamma. Mandelbrot and filled Julia sets There are two planes associated with \\\\mathcal M. One of these, the z (or w) plane, will be called the mapping plane, since \\\\mathcal M sends this plane into itself. The other, the \\\\gamma (or \\\\mu) plane, will be called the control plane. The nature of what happens in the mapping plane under repeated application of \\\\mathcal M depends on where \\\\gamma (or \\\\mu) is in the control plane. The filled Julia set consists of all points in the mapping plane whose images remain bounded under indefinitely repeated applications of \\\\mathcal M. The Mandelbrot set consists of those points in the control plane such that the associated filled Julia set in the mapping plane is connected. Figure 1 shows the Mandelbrot set when \\\\gamma is the control parameter, and Figure 2 shows the Mandelbrot set when \\\\mu is the control parameter. Since z and w are affine transformations of one another (a linear transformation plus a translation), the filled Julia sets look much the same in either the z or w planes. The Douady rabbit Douady rabbit in an exponential family Lamination of rabbit Julia set Quaternion julia set with parameters c = −0,123 + 0.745i and with a cross-section in the XY plane. The \\"Douady Rabbit\\" julia set is visible in the cross section Representation of the dynamics inside the rabbit. The Douady rabbit is most easily described in terms of the Mandelbrot set as shown in Figure 1 (above). In this figure, the Mandelbrot set, at least when viewed from a distance, appears as two back-to- back unit discs with sprouts. Consider the sprouts at the one- and five-o'clock positions on the right disk or the sprouts at the seven- and eleven-o'clock positions on the left disk. When \\\\gamma is within one of these four sprouts, the associated filled Julia set in the mapping plane is a Douady rabbit. For these values of \\\\gamma, it can be shown that \\\\mathcal M has z=0 and one other point as unstable (repelling) fixed points, and z=\\\\infty as an attracting fixed point. Moreover, the map {\\\\mathcal{M}}^3 has three attracting fixed points. Douady's rabbit consists of the three attracting fixed points z_1, z_2, and z_3 and their basins of attraction. For example, Figure 3 shows Douady's rabbit in the z plane when \\\\gamma=\\\\gamma_D=2.55268-0.959456i, a point in the five-o'clock sprout of the right disk. For this value of \\\\gamma, the map \\\\mathcal M has the repelling fixed points z=0 and z=.656747-.129015i. The three attracting fixed points of {\\\\mathcal M}^3 (also called period-three fixed points) have the locations :z^1 = 0.499997032420304 - (1.221880225696050\\\\times10^{-6})i{\\\\;}{\\\\;}{\\\\mathrm {(red)}}, :z^2 = 0.638169999974373 - (0.239864000011495)i{\\\\;}{\\\\;}{\\\\mathrm {(green)}}, :z^3 = 0.799901291393262 - (0.107547238170383)i{\\\\;}{\\\\;}{\\\\mathrm {(yellow)}}. The red, green, and yellow points lie in the basins B(z^1), B(z^2), and B(z^3) of {\\\\mathcal M}^3, respectively. The white points lie in the basin B(\\\\infty) of \\\\mathcal M. The action of \\\\mathcal M on these fixed points is given by the relations :{\\\\mathcal M}z^1=z^2, :{\\\\mathcal M}z^2=z^3, :{\\\\mathcal M}z^3=z^1. Corresponding to these relations there are the results :{\\\\mathcal M}B(z^1)=B(z^2) {\\\\;} {\\\\mathrm {or}} {\\\\;} {\\\\mathcal M}{\\\\;}{\\\\mathrm {red}}\\\\subseteq{\\\\mathrm {green}}, :{\\\\mathcal M}B(z^2)=B(z^3) {\\\\;} {\\\\mathrm {or}} {\\\\;} {\\\\mathcal M}{\\\\;}{\\\\mathrm {green}}\\\\subseteq{\\\\mathrm {yellow}}, :{\\\\mathcal M}B(z^3)=B(z^1) {\\\\;} {\\\\mathrm {or}} {\\\\;} {\\\\mathcal M}{\\\\;}{\\\\mathrm {yellow}}\\\\subseteq{\\\\mathrm {red}}. Note the marvelous fractal structure at the basin boundaries. Figure 3: Douady's rabbit for \\\\gamma=2.55268-0.959456i or \\\\mu=0.122565-0.744864i. As a second example, Figure 4 shows a Douady rabbit when \\\\gamma=2-\\\\gamma_D=-.55268+.959456i, a point in the eleven-o'clock sprout on the left disk. (As noted earlier, \\\\mu is invariant under this transformation.) The rabbit now sits more symmetrically on the page. The period-three fixed points are located at :z^1= 0.500003730675024 + (6.968273875812428 \\\\times 10^{-6})i {\\\\;}{\\\\;} ({\\\\mathrm {red}}), :z^2=-0.138169999969259 + (0.239864000061970)i {\\\\;}{\\\\;} ({\\\\mathrm {green}}), :z^3= -0.238618870661709 - (0.264884797354373)i {\\\\;}{\\\\;} ({\\\\mathrm {yellow}}), The repelling fixed points of \\\\mathcal M itself are located at z=0 and z=1.450795 + 0.7825835i. The three major lobes on the left, which contain the period-three fixed points z^1,z^2, and z^3, meet at the fixed point z=0, and their counterparts on the right meet at the point z=1. It can be shown that the effect of \\\\mathcal M on points near the origin consists of a counterclockwise rotation about the origin of \\\\arg(\\\\gamma), or very nearly 120^\\\\circ, followed by scaling (dilation) by a factor of \\\\gamma=1.1072538.

Trsat was actually founded by the Tarsatica's surviving inhabitants, a year after the siege. (Croatian Academy of America. Journal of Croatian studies (1986), Vol. 27–30) in Liburnia, near the Croatian–Frankish border.Scholz 1970, p. 191 The battle was fought in the autumn of 799 between the defending forces of Dalmatian Croatia under the leadership of Croatian duke Višeslav, and the invading Frankish army of the Carolingian Empire led by Eric of Friuli. The battle was a Croatian victory, and the Frankish commander Eric was killed during the siege.Žic 2001, p. 18 The Frankish invasion of Croatia, the destruction of Tarsatica, the coronation of Charlemagne as Holy Roman Emperor, and negotiations from 802–815 between the Franks and Byzantines led to a stalemate. Dalmatian Croatia consequently peacefully accepted a limited Frankish overlordship.Dzino 2010, p. 183 Background Charlemagne, as depicted by Albrecht Dürer. Charlemagne, King of the Franks from 768 until his death in 814, expanded the Frankish kingdom into an empire that incorporated much of western and central Europe.Ross 1945, pp. 212–235 He brought the Frankish state face to face with the Slavs to the northeast and the Avars and Slavs to the southeast of the Frankish Empire. The Croats lived in Pannonian Croatia and Dalmatian Croatia (Littoral Croatia) to the southeast of the Frankish Empire. Dalmatian Croatia was ruled by Duke Višeslav, one of the first known Croatian dukes.Fine 1991, p. 296 While fighting the Avars, the Franks called for Slavic-Croatian support. Croatian Prince Vojnomir of Pannonian Croatia launched a joint counterattack with the help of Frankish troops under Charlemagne in 791.Dvornik 1959, p. 69 The offensive was successful and the Avars were driven out of Croatia. In return for the help of Charlemagne, Vojnomir was obliged to recognize Frankish sovereignty, convert to Christianity, and have his territory named Pannonian Croatia. Charlemagne again campaigned against the Avars and won a major victory in 796.Fine 1991, p. 257 Prince Vojnomir aided him, and the Franks became overlords of the Croatians of northern Dalmatia, Slavonia, and Pannonia. The Franks placed Pannonian Croats under Eric, the margrave of Friuli, who then tried to extend his rule over the Croatians of Dalmatia.Fine 1991, p. 252 The conquest of Istria by the Franks brought the realm of Charlemagne adjacent to Dalmatia.Bury 2008, p. 329 Dalmatia at that time included both Roman cities and a Slavic-Croatian hinterland that was loosely subject to the rule of the Byzantine Empire. In the treaty of 798, the Franks acknowledged Byzantine rights over the Slavs, but in the following years both Croatian Župans (dukes) and Roman communities recognized an opportunity to win full independence from both Imperial powers. As the eldest son of Gerold of Vinzgouw and as a high ranking Frankish commander, Eric was titled from 789 to his death the Duke of Friuli (dux Foroiulensis). He was appointed governor of Istria, Friuli, and neighbouring areas by Charlemagne. Eric wanted to extend his dominion by conquering Dalmatian Croatia.According to Denis Sinor, it is possible that Eric set his army to fight the Avars and was attacked by Croats at Trsat. (Sinor (1990), p. 219.) In the autumn of 799, Eric marched from Istria along the seacoast of Liburnia towards the town of Trsat, which is today part of the city of Rijeka.Klaić 1985, pp. 63–64 Meanwhile his opponent, Duke Višeslav, gathered his forces and moved north from his governing center at Nin. Siege Upon arriving at the foot of the settlement, Eric besieged and attacked the city, but was repelled. Led by Duke Višeslav, the inhabitants of Trsat threw spears, shot arrows, and hurled huge stones on the enemy, and managed to kill many of them.This description of the battle can also be found in primary material from Aquileian Patriarch Saint Paulinus II. In his poem \\"Versus de Herico duce\\" he mention throwing spears, arrows, and huge stones upon Eric. Eric's forces fled their positions, and were subsequently routed by the forces of Višeslav in an ambush.Tomac 1959, p. 304 Eric was among those killed, and his death and defeat proved to be a great blow for the Carolingian Empire.Einhard, Vita Karoli Magni Aquileian Patriarch Saint Paulinus II cursed the land in which the hero was killed, and wrote Carmen de regula fidei, the rhythmus or elegy for his death. According to contemporary Frankish scholar and courtier Einhard, Eric was killed at Trsat (Tarsatch), a town on the coast of Liburnia, by the treachery of the inhabitants. Due to a lack of primary materials, it is uncertain who killed Duke Eric. Most of historians point at Croats,Riché 1993, p. 111 while some point at Byzantines.Labus 2000, pp. 1–16 Einhard also notes the death of Gerold, Prefect of Bavaria, another Frankish commander who was slain in Pannonia in the same year. Croatian historian Nenad Labus refers to this event as a successful assassination attempt by Avars and Slavs. Historian Pierre Riché believes that Dalmatian Croats (Guduscani) killed Eric in collusion with Avars. Besides the Royal Frankish Annals (Annales Regni Francorum), there is another primary source compiled in c. 950, the historical work De administrando imperio, ascribed to Constantine Porphyrogenitus, which refers to Croatian-Frankish relations.Constantine Porphyrogenitus, pp. 143–145 Constantine notes that for a number of years the Croats of Dalmatia were subjects of the Franks, who treated them brutally. The Croats revolted and slew their princes. In an act of revenge, a large army from Francia invaded Croatia. After seven years of war, the Croats managed to defeat the Franks, killing a large portion of the invading army along with its commander. Although Constantine describes a chain of events that are analogous to the 'Siege of Trsat', he does not mention Tarsatica or the exact year of these events. Aftermath Map is showing imperial boundaries of the Byzantine Empire and the Carolingian Empire in 814, with Croatia in the middle. In 800, Eric's successor Cadolah of Friuli invaded Dalmatian Croatia by the order of Charlemagne, but without considerable military success. Still, Tarsatica was burned down.Historians have a disagreement whether Tarsatica was destroyed in 799 or in 800. Tarsatica's surviving inhabitants moved to a more protected hill, where they established a new settlement called Trsat.According to Ferdo Šišić, Rijeka was founded by the Croats after the destruction of Tarsatica. (Šišić, Ferdo. Abridged Political History of Rieka (Fiume) (1919)) Višeslav continued to rule over Dalmatian Croatia and warred against the Franks, avoiding defeat upon his death in 802. He was succeeded by his son Borna, who later become a Frankish ally. On Christmas Day in 800, Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne as Imperator Romanorum (Holy Roman Emperor) in Saint Peter's Basilica. This was a direct challenge to Byzantium's claim to be the one—the Roman—empire. Nicephorus I of the Byzantine Empire and Charlemagne of the Holy Roman Empire settled their imperial boundaries in 803. Dalmatian Croatia peacefully accepted a limited Frankish overlordship. The peace of Aache in 812 confirmed Dalmatia, except for the Byzantine cities and islands, as under Frankish domain. Ljudevit Posavski, Croatian Duke of Pannonian Croatia, led a resistance to Frankish domination.Riché 1993, pp. 158–159Royal Frankish Annales Annales Regni Francorum ed. G. H. Pertz. Monumenta Germanicae Historica, Scriptores rerum Germanicarum 6, (Hannover 1895) for the years 819–822. Ljudevit also had to fight against Dalmatian Croatia, as their prince Borna was a Frankish ally.Scholz 1970, p. 106 After unsuccessful resistance by Ljudevit and Pannonian Croats, the Franks again controlled Istria, Dalmatia, and Pannonia.Scholz 1970, p. 197 Nevertheless, Dalmatian Croatia remained a semi-independent duchy between the two Empires, as they had a right to elect their own prince.

The ZIP Code for the community is 34679. As of the 2010 census the population was 308. Geography Aripeka is located at on both sides of Hammock Creek, a small tidal inlet to the Gulf of Mexico. Similar in geophysical structure to Hernando Beach, Bayport, and Pine Island, Florida, Aripeka is surrounded by marshland, mostly within Hernando County. The Pasco-Hernando county line is located at the South Hammock Creek Bridge. Demographics History The community of Gulf Key was settled in this area in 1873 and a post office by that name was established in 1883. The post office was known briefly as, \\"Argo\\". It was replaced by the Aripeka post office in 1895. Aripeka is named for an early nineteenth-century Seminole chief, who is thought to have lived nearby. The town was divided when Pasco County separated from Hernando County in 1887. The post office, which was originally in Hernando County, moved across the Pasco County line in 1921. According to the historical marker in the town, Babe Ruth visited Aripeka to fish. On June 3, 1993, the Pasco County Historic Preservation Committee dedicated the town a State Historic Site. Notable residents * James Rosenquist, an artist, maintained \\"a home, an office and studio space\\" during his later years. Transportation The main road through Aripeka is County Road 595, named Aripeka Road in Pasco County and Osowaw Boulevard in Hernando County.

At various times he worked for the intelligence services of Nazi Germany, Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and West Germany. It is still not clear when he started working for Soviet intelligence, but it is known that between 1951 and 1961 he was a highly effective double agent, supplying important intelligence received in the course of his work for West German Intelligence to the Soviet Union. At the age of eighteen in 1936, Felfe served in the SS, most recently as an Obersturmführer (First Lieutenant). Life Early years Heinz Felfe was born in Dresden, in the southern part of what was then the central part of Germany. His father was a Criminal Investigation officer (Kriminalbeamter). On leaving school Felfe undertook an apprenticeship as a precision mechanic. At school he joined the Nazi Schoolchildren's League (NSS / Nationalsozialistischer Schülerbund): at this time Adolf Hitler was still known only as a highly effective opposition politician. In 1931, the year of his thirteenth birthday, Felfe joined the Hitler Youth association. Two years later, in January 1933, the NSDAP (Nazi Party) took power in Germany, and in 1936, the year of his eighteenth birthday, Heinz Felfe became one of Germany's (by then) nearly four million Nazi party members (membership number 3,710,348). National socialist years 1936 was also the year in which Heinz Felfe joined the party's \\"Protection Squadron\\", better remembered by subsequent generations as the SS / Schutzstaffel (membership number 286,288). In 1939 he began working as a personal bodyguard for prominent party members, which also involved his receiving training as an official in the Criminal Investigation Department. =German intelligence= Felfe joined the Intelligence service (Der Sicherheitsdienst) in 1943. In August 1943 he was posted to Switzerland where, as head of the agency's important Swiss unit, his responsibilities included disseminating forged British pound notes as part of a broader strategy to undermine the British currency internationally. Towards the end of the war he was promoted to the rank of SS-Obersturmführer (roughly equivalent to a First lieutenant) and, in December 1944, transferred to the Netherlands with a mandate to organise subversive groups behind what was now becoming the allied front line. According to a credible 1969 press report much of his energy while in the Netherlands implied a personal rivalry with his father, a Dresden-based Criminal Investigation Officer of evidently overbearing character, who was by origin a member of Germany's Sorbian ethnic minority. As the German war machine fell back across Europe, Felfe spent a lot of time persuading the Gestapo to harass members of the Sorbian minority back in his country's Saxon heartland. After the war =British intelligence= He was captured by the British Army in 1945, and spent the seventeen months from May 1945 till October 1946 as a British prisoner of war. He at some point had learned to speak English fluently. Under interrogation in July, 1945, at Blauwkapel (near Utrecht), Felfe stated that he had been \\"an ardent Nazi\\". This was nothing more than the British could have determined for themselves by rummaging through the relevant German records, but the egotistical candor of his assertion was sufficiently unusual for the British to flag it in their own files as well as in the record of the interrogation passed along to the CIA. In 1946 he agreed to work for British Intelligence (\\"MI6\\") in Münster. His assignments included reporting on Communist activism at ColognePiekalkiewicz: Weltgeschichte der Spionage. Weltbild 1990, p.464 and Bonn universities. He continued to work for the British at least till 1949, but amid growing suspicion by his handlers that he might also be working for the Soviet intelligence services. By 1949 Felfe had also found time to study for and obtain a Law degree from Bonn university. =Soviet intelligence= At some point between 1949 and 1951 he was indeed recruited to work for Soviet intelligence. Subsequent CIA reconstructions of the narrative indicate that he might have been working less formally for the Soviets from 1948 or earlier. However, Felfe is believed to have become a \\"full blown\\" Soviet agent only in September 1951, following a meeting in late 1949 or early 1950 with Hans Clemens, a former colleague from their days in German Intelligence. By this time, however, Felfe had already been supplying Clemens with information for the Soviets. Both Felfe and Clemens were from Dresden: the recruitment of both men was directed by the KGB office in Dresden. Later CIA reports noted that during the years directly following the war the Soviets had systematically targeted former agents of the Nazi Intelligence services, and that they had particular success in recruiting people from Dresden because of bitterness against the British and Americans resulting from the very high level of civilian deaths and suffering caused by the destructive fire bombing of that city in February 1945. The intense bombing of Dresden had been controversial even in London and Washington. Felfe's Soviet handlers used for him the code name \\"Paul\\". Meanwhile, in April 1950 the British \\"dropped \\" him, \\"for serious oparational [sic] and personal security reasons\\". Agent \\"Paul\\" continued to work under the case officer Vitaly Korotkov for the Soviet Main Intelligence Directorate until his arrest in November 1961. Even after his arrest he managed to brief the KGB about his ongoing interrogation, using invisible ink to make additions to his private letters. =Refugee screening= In 1950/51 Heinz Felfe was also working for the West German government in Bonn with the Federal Ministry for intra-German relations. The zones of occupation agreed upon between the principal allied leaders at Potsdam had by now crystallized in such a way that the Soviet occupation zone had been developed into a separate stand-alone state; for the first few years after 1945 under Soviet administration and, since the young country's foundation in 1949, as the German Democratic Republic (while still able to access the fraternal security advice and practical support of several hundred thousand resident Soviet troops). The frontier between the two German states later became famously fortified, but through the later 1940s and early 1950s large numbers of people moved with little impediment from East Germany to West Germany. Inevitably some of those making the crossing would turn out to have been sent across to gather information for the East German and Soviet intelligence services. Felfe was employed as an interrogator, tasked with screening, among others, former members of East Germany's quasi-military police service (Volkspolizei) and any identified associates arriving in the refugee camps. =West German intelligence= Barely two months after his formal recruitment by Soviet Intelligence, Wilhelm Krichbaum recruited Heinz Felfe into the Gehlen Organization in November, 1951. That US-sponsored intelligence agency was the precursor to the Federal Intelligence Service (Bundesnachrichtendienst) which would replace it in 1956. The West Germans were evidently not aware in any sufficient detail of the circumstances that had led the British security services to dispense with Felfe's service back in April 1950. Initial contacts between Felfe and the Gehlen Organisation had been choreographed by the very same Hans Clemens who had facilitated Felfe's recruitment by the Soviet Intelligence agency. Felfe's code name in his work for the West German agency was \\"Friesen\\". Many years later an angry fellow former West German intelligence officer testified that Reinhard Gehlen himself had used the alternative code name \\"Fiffi\\" for Heinz Felfe: the same witness stated that the same alternative name \\"Fiffi\\" was also used for the Soviet agent \\"Paul\\" by \\"Alfred\\", who at the time had been Felfe's KGB handler. =Soviet intelligence and West German intelligence= Felfe rose quickly through the ranks of the West German intelligence service. After his arrest in November 1961 it would be established that as a double agent his over-riding loyalty was to Soviet intelligence, but along the way the Soviet KGB and GRU (Main Intelligence Directorate / Главное разведывательное управление) were keen to preserve his cover and therefore enabled him to provide plenty of credible intelligence to his West German handlers. Subsequently declassified CIA analysis outlines four elaborate operations undertaken in the early 1950s by Soviet Intelligence, under the codes names \\"Balthasar\\", \\"Lena\\", \\"Lilli Marlen\\" and \\"Busch\\", designed to support Felfe's usefulness and credibility in the eyes of his West German bosses. According to Reinhard Gehlen's own memoirs, published in 1971, Felfe had provided an abundance of intelligence nuggets to close confidants of the West German intelligence chief.Reinhard Gehlen: Der Dienst. Hasse und Köhler Verlag, 1971, p. 287 The information was well put together by the KGB chief, Scheljepin: Gehlen himself praises it in his book as unique in terms of quality (\\"bis heute ohne Untertreibung als einmalig bezeichnet werden könne\\"). At the same time, his book devotes only three pages (p.296 et seq) to the matter of Heinz Felfe himself. Allied intelligence agencies, notably the CIA, had gone out of their way to congratulate him, since they themselves had not at this point uncovered Felfe's work for the Soviets. Within the West German service, Felfe rose rapidly to the relatively senior rank of Regierungsrat. In the end, either by 1955 or 1958, he became the agency's head (or deputy head) of counter-espionage against the Soviets. His status within the service and the confidence of his senior colleagues enabled Felfe's free access to many of the secret files held by the federal government and, notably, its foreign ministry. He later claimed that he had been heading up a West German spy ring in Moscow from as early as 1953 and that information passed to the West from that exercise had included the secret minutes from meetings of the (East German) ruling party's central committee, featuring alleged criticisms of high-ranking party officials close to the East German leader, Walter Ulbricht: they had also included the identities of (\\"expendable\\") KGB agents.Gehlen, in his 1971 memoir, records the condemnation of an individual agent identified as \\"Publizisten W.\\" at this time, which may be a reference to the same incident. Felfe also stated that he had provided the west with a detailed plan of the KGB headquarters in Karlshorst on the south side of Berlin, something which Gehlen loved to show high-ranking intelligence chiefs from his country's western allies. As head of the department responsible for Soviet counter-intelligence, one of Felfe's longest running projects involved his leadership of \\"Panoptikum\\", an operation to uncover a \\"mole\\" believed to be operating at a high level within the West German Intelligence Service. In the end, the target of \\"Panoptikum\\" would turn out to be Heinz Felfe. After his arrest in 1961, the court found that during ten years as an active double agent Felfe had photographed more than 15,000 secret documents and transmitted countless messages by radio, or using one of his personal contacts. He later recalled that he had been able to pass his handlers plans (in the end never implemented) for the creation of a European Defence Community and of the detailed diplomatic planning for the visit to Moscow undertaken in 1955 by the West German Chancellor, Konrad Adenauer. Another career highlight during the 1950s was his success in integrating himself into a CIA operation to penetrate the KGB Headquarters in Berlin, which led to a CIA mole having to disappear in a hurry. According to two exceptionally well-briefed pundits, Oleg Gordievsky and Christopher Andrew, he managed to keep the Soviets regularly up apprised in their major areas of interest concerning the CIA and other intelligence services. From the West German perspective, however, his treachery inflicted serious damage. He betrayed the leadership of the Federal Intelligence Service. Copies of Intelligence Service reports prepared for the Chancellor's office were shared with the Russians. He gave the Soviets the identities of ninety four West Germany overseas \\"field officers\\", including the agency chief in Bangkok. The identities of these officers were known to only a very few, even within The Service, but Felfe proved adept at finding their names by sounding out the relevant colleagues. His senior position in counter-espionage left him plenty of opportunities to cover his own tracks on such matters as any links he may have had with the English spy Kim Philby. Subsequent CIA analysis notes that following his arrest Felfe was open and cooperative on questions to which his interrogators already knew the answers, but in contrast to other more garrulous agents unmasked and quizzed at around the same time, he took care not to disclose matters on which he judged his interrogators were not already well informed. The totality of his damage done must have far exceeded that which has yet come to light: nevertheless, when his apartment was searched more than 300 microfilms containing 15,660 images were found, along with 20 audio tapes. Arrest and trial Felfe was arrested on spying charges on 6 November 1961. The same day the West German intelligence services received a message from their US counterparts, \\"Congratulations. You found your Felfe: we're still looking for ours\\" (\\"Glückwunsch -- Ihr habt Euren Felfe entdeckt, wir unseren noch nicht.\\"). In later years, as the agency turned to the Israelis for help in recreating an espionage network in Eastern Europe, and the extent to which West German intelligence had been penetrated by Soviet agents during the postwar years became clear, the CIA's attitude to West German intelligence would become less congratulatory. Elsewhere in the US intelligence establishment the Counterintelligence Corps (CIC) had always been sceptical over the recruitment of former SS officers into Gehlen's Intelligence service (from 1956 the BND): the CIC were already, in 1953, including Felfe on a list of potential defectors, but the available indications are that the CIC never shared their doubts with the CIA which was in some ways a rival operation. In the end it was a Soviet defector, a KGB major called Anatoliy Golitsyn, who in October 1961 provided the decisive information that led to Felfe. Golyzin was unable to supply Felfe's name, but he provided sufficient detail to make identification of the Soviet mole easy. It was later pointed out that both the US and West German intelligence services should have been led to Felfe much sooner, for instance on account of a lifestyle more lavish than could easily be explained by his income as an employee of the West German Intelligence services. Looking back there were those who judged the intelligence that Felfe obtained too good to be true. On the other hand, right up till his unmasking in November 1961 Felfe retained the stubborn backing of the agency's powerful chief, Reinhard Gehlen, who is on record with his appreciation of the quality of Felfe's intelligence. There are also suggestions in retrospective intelligence analyses that the sheer extent to which West German intelligence was penetrated by the Soviets during the 1950s may have meant that there were more senior people in it ready to protect Felfe than will ever become public. Two other intelligence agents arrested on suspicion of spying for the Soviet on 6 November 1961 were an agent called Erwin Tiebel and Hans Clemens, the man who had played such a prominent role in Felfe's recruitment into both the Soviet and the West German Intelligence Services. Clemens and Felfe admitted to having passed 15,000 classified documents to the Soviets.https://books.google.ca/books?id=1-Sc_FtXhJoC&pg;=PA41&dq;=Hans+Clemens+trial+convicted&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwiul9q68LrkAhVpkuAKHYCoB5YQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q;=Hans%20Clemens%20trial%20convicted&f;=false, Historical Dictionary of International Intelligence, page 41 Clemens received a 10-years sentence for treason. On 22 July 1963 the Federal Court of Justice in Karlsruhe found the three men guilty of spying for the Soviet Union. Their jail terms were set at 3, 11 and 14 years. The 14 year sentence went to Felfe. Release Still aged only 51, Felfe was nevertheless released on 14 February 1969 in exchange for 21 (mostly political) prisoners including three West German students from Heidelberg, Walter Naumann, Peter Sonntag and Volker Schaffhauser, who had been convicted in the Soviet Union for spying because they had allegedly been caught writing down the license plate numbers of Soviet military vehicles on behalf of the CIA. The exchange took place at Herleshausen, by then one of the few border check points still open along the inner German border that divided East and West Germany. It came about only following massive pressure from the German Democratic Republic which threatened to break off the secret political prisoner ransom scheme that the two Germanys had been quietly operating since 1964. It happened in the face of strong opposition from Gerhard Wessel, who in 1968 had taken over from Gehlen as head of West German Intelligence. The number of political detainees exchanged for him and the extent of the pressure the Soviets were willing to apply through their East German proxies in support of Felfe's release testify to his importance in the eyes of Soviet intelligence. Following his release Felfe worked briefly for the KGB before returning to East Berlin where, in 1972, he became a Professor for Criminalistics at East Berlin's Humboldt University. The memoir Heinz Felfe published his memoir in 1986 under the title In the Service of the enemy: Ten years as Moscow's man in the Federal Intelligence Service. The manuscript had been reviewed by Felfe's former employers in the KGB, and during a press interview he gave the estimate that perhaps 10-15% of what he had written had been removed at their request, while their acceptance of certain other passages had surprised him. At the book launch in East Berlin he stressed his (Federal) German nationality (which after reunification would become the nationality of Germans on both sides of the former inner German border). After 1990 this was reported to have caused some irritation among a nostalgic element who still treasured the memory of the defiantly separate German Democratic Republic. Evaluation Public disclosure of Felfe's activities damaged the reputation of the West German Intelligence Service, which just three months earlier had been taken by surprise by the erection of the Berlin Wall. The intelligence services lost the confidence of the political establishment domestically and of the intelligence services of other countries, notably the United States, which now became much more cautious about information sharing. Even more damaging was the destruction of trust within the Bundesnachrichtendienst itself. According to Heribert Hellenbroich (head of BND) on public TV, Felfe displayed a healthy measure of chutzpah while being an instructor to nascent spies of BND: During his explanation of secret communication via shortwave radio from KGB / Moscow to their European spies, he used actual radio traffic (encrypted number sequences in spoken German language voice) that in fact contained orders that Felfe himself was to carry out on behalf of the Soviets. In March 2008 Heinz Felfe received congratulations from the Russian FSB (successor to the Soviet KGB) on the occasion of his 90th birthday.

The planet was discovered orbiting the brown dwarf or low-mass star MOA-2007-BLG-192L. At a mass of approximately 3.3 times Earth, it is one of the lowest-mass extrasolar planets at the time of discovery. It was found when it caused a gravitational microlensing event on May 24, 2007, which was detected as part of the MOA-II microlensing survey at the Mount John University Observatory in New Zealand. The system's primary is small as well. At roughly 6% the mass of the Sun, it is probably too small to sustain fusion reactions, making it a dimly glowing brown dwarf. Also, the estimated projected distance between MOA-2007-BLG-192Lb and its primary is approximately 0.62 astronomical units. That means the planet probably formed with much ice and gases, more like Neptune (an ice giant planet) in composition than Earth (a terrestrial planet), according to astronomer David Bennett of the University of Notre Dame.Smallest Extrasolar Planet Portends Other Earths, Richard A.

It was formed in reaction to some of the changes instituted by the Roman Catholic Church as a result of the Second Vatican Council. Description During that time, in 1966, Anthony Girandola, a Roman Catholic priest, announced that he was married, had been married for some time, and intended to remain both a married man and a Roman Catholic priest. After making his statement regarding his lack of adherence to the clerical celibacy rule of the Roman Catholic Church, he found that he could not find a Roman Catholic church to function in. He then started to organize his own church in Saint Petersburg, Florida. Girandola became a celebrity, and found that the demands on his time as such increased, limiting the amount of pastoral work he could perform. He thus ordained one of his church members, John J. Humphreys, to be ordained as a priest to help deal with his pastoral duties. Humphreys left the new church shortly thereafter, forming Our Lady of Good Hope Old Roman Catholic Church under the jurisdiction of Archbishop Richard Arthur Marchenna of the Old Roman Catholic Church. Humphreys served as that group's vicar general for several years, until Marchenna ordained Robert Clement as a bishop of the Eucharistic Catholic Church, a church perceived as having a pro-homosexual orientation. Marchenna was then excommunicated by Gerard George Shelley, who, as Primate of the Old Catholic Church in England and America, saw himself as Marchenna's superior. Father Humphreys was then himself consecrated as a bishop by Shelley, and formed the Historical and Canonical Old Roman Catholic Church to be Shelley's North American jurisdiction. After Shelley's death in 1980, Michael Farrell, whom Humphrey's had made a bishop in 1981, succeeded Shelley, only to resign himself shortly thereafter, to be replaced by Emile Rodriguez y Fairfield, the pastor of a small church in East Los Angeles who had been ordained by the Mexican National Catholic Church. Fairfield himself left the position in 1983. He was one of three bishops of the Mexican National Catholic Church line, and left to become the leader of that church. The following year, in 1984, Humphreys himself was elected primate of the church. The church currently has five parishes, three in Florida, one in Tennessee, and one in New York.

The AEMC was established by the Australian Energy Market Commission Establishment Act 2004 (SA),Australian Energy Market Commission Establishment Act 2004 (SA) and commenced in July 2005. The Commission consists of one full-time and two part-time Commissioners. Two Commissioners are appointed by the participating State and Territory jurisdictions and one Commissioner is appointed by the Commonwealth. In 2008, the AEMC completed a review of Victoria's and South Australia's retail gas and electricity markets. In both states it was found that competition in the market was adequate for deregulation. The authority is also involved in inter-regional electricity prices and access issues. National Electricity Market The AEMC has two roles in relation to the National Electricity Market – as rule maker and as a provider of advice to Ministers on how best to develop energy markets over time. The AEMC actively considers market development when it considers rule change proposals, policy advice and energy market reviews. These rules are binding on the Australian energy market and enforced by the Australian Energy Regulator.

He later went on to found two separate Catholic groups in the United States. The Roman Catholic Church, whose laws on clerical celibacy do not usually permit priests to be married, would not offer him a position in which he could perform priestly functions. Girandola began to organize his own independent church in Saint Petersburg, Florida. He became a celebrity after his announcement and was in demand as both a speaker and as a guest on radio and television talk shows. At about this time he wrote a well-known book, The Most Defiant Priest. Finding that the demands on his time as a result of his notoriety severely limited the time he had available for pastoral work, he ordained John J. Humphreys to the priesthood to help alleviate his duties. Humphreys later left Girandola's church, eventually forming the Canonical Old Roman Catholic Church. References *Melton, J. Gordon.

They arrived in England during April, 1944, and entered combat in mid June, landing at Utah Beach. The unit fought across France and into Germany during the summer and early winter of 1944. In late winter, they were then pulled out and sent to Belgium near the end of the Ardennes Campaign and again fought their way into and across Germany, ending the war near the Czechoslovakian border. The 607th received credit for the Normandy, Northern France, Rhineland, Ardennes-Alsace and Central Europe campaigns. History Early service The battalion was activated on 15 December 1941 with personnel from the 7th Infantry Division Provisional Antitank Battalion. Additional personnel from Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Montana were assigned in March, 1942. In December, 1942 and January, 1943, personnel from Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky and West Virginia replaced the losses of the preceding nine months. On 15 December 1943, it was reorganized, changing from a self-propelled to a towed battalion equipped with the 3in Gun M5 and the Reconnaissance Company being inactivated. Except for four and a half months training at the Tank Destroyer Center, at Camp Hood, Texas, the battalion received all of its precombat training in California at Sunnyvale, Hunter Liggett Military Reservation, Camp San Luis Obispo, Lost Hills, Desert Training Center and Camp Cooke. The unit deployed to the United Kingdom on 13 April 1944, sailing on the USS Wakefield (AP-21) and arriving on the 21st. The unit was stationed in Macclesfield, Cheshire, England for one month and then proceeded to Camp Barton Stacey, in southern England, where it made final preparations for the invasion, arriving on the beaches of Normandy, France on 17 June 1944. Normandy A towed M5 3\\" anti-tank gun of the 607th Tank Destroyer Battalion somewhere in France, 1944 Two companies (Headquarters and A) landed in Normandy at 0130 on 17 June (D+11) at Utah Beach, with Companies B and C being unable to land due to rough water. Company A was committed to action in the Battle of Cherbourg on arrival, attached to the 9th Infantry Division. During this mission, Co A captured its, and the battalions, first prisoner. The battalion was relieved from attachment to the VII Corps and attached to VIII Corps on 19 June, with Company A attached to the 82nd Airborne Division until 4 July and the battalion, less Co A, to the 90th Infantry Division. The remaining two companies (B and C) landed on 23 June, with Co B joining the 357th Infantry Regiment of the 90th ID. Company C moved to the TD's secondary mission, indirect fire, in the vicinity of Cretteville and fired the first rounds from a 3\\" gun of the battalion on French soil. During the period of 7 to 27 July, the division advanced very slowly, especially in the areas around Foret De Monte Castro on Hill 122, on the approaches to Seves Island and at Beau Coudray. Following the bombing from St. Lo to the southwest toward Periers and the exploitation of the forced breakthrough, the enemy withdrew from the division front on the night of 27 July. During the month of July, 15,424 rounds were fired indirect. A breakthrough to the enemy's rear had been made. Task Force Weaver, consisting of the 357th Infantry Regiment, 712th Tank Battalion, 344th and 345th Field Artillery Battalions and Co. A of the 607th, was organized and given the mission of securing the crossing of the Mayenne River, at Mayenne, and then proceed to Le Mans. On 5 August, the task force left La Condonniere, moving towards Mayenne and meeting light resistance. On the 6th the drive continued towards Le Mans, during which Co C destroyed an enemy half track, the first armored vehicle hit by the battalion. The task force arrived in Le Mans on the 8th. On 11 August, units of the battalion began moving north with the 90th as the division sought to close in on the southern side of the pincer which closed the Falaise pocket. The battalion continued to support the infantry regiments, and helped repel several armored and infantry attacks in the areas around Le Bourg-Saint-Leonard, Chambois and St. Eugenie; between 16 and 21 August, they accounted for thirty-four tanks, twenty-three self-propelled guns, nine halftracks and sixteen artillery pieces destroyed or captured,Gill (1992). p. 65. with over five hundred prisoners taken and fifteen men awarded Silver Stars. Push through France Tank Destroyer Battalion (SP) Structure - March 1944 While the 607th was fighting in the Falaise pocket, other units had pushed far to the east and southeast. With the 90th, the battalion marched to Fontainbleau, a distance of 171 miles on 26 August. Between 27 August and 1 September, the various companies in support of the 357th and 359th IR's moved north of Reims and to Ft. de Brimont, a distance of 135 miles from Fontainbleau. Little opposition was met on this drive. On 8 Sept., the unit participated in fending off a counterattack by the German Panzer Brigade 106 which was attacking in the Mairy/Trieux/Briey area (Battle of Mairy).Gill (1992). p. 69. The attack commenced in the pre-dawn hours but the 607th's first contact with the Germans was at 0700hrs when enemy tanks began firing at Mairy. The 3\\" guns knocked out two tanks. Around 0800 the Germans attempted to outflank the anti-tank defenses by coming into the town from the south aboard 11 armored half-tracks. Two were knocked out by bazooka fire from the TD platoon and, as they attempted to exit the town to the north, four more were lost to the 3\\" guns. The actions against Pz. Brig. 106 by the 607th and units of the 90th ID essentially destroyed one of the four panzer brigades committed to the Lorraine counteroffensive by the Germans.Zaloga (2000). pp. 36-42. By 13 September, the battalion, continuing to support the infantry regiments, had closed up to the Moselle River near Thionville. On this date, a gun from the 2nd platoon, C Company, located 200 yards west of Basse Parth, fired ten rounds into Germany, targeting the church steeple in Perl. These were the first rounds fired by the 90th into Germany, first rounds fired by the XX Corps into Germany and it is believed to have been the first fire to fall into Germany from the Third Army. During the remainder of Sept. and through Oct., the battalion continued to support the infantry regiments as they closed on Metz, France. The 95th Infantry Division began to relieve the 90th on 1 Nov. and effective 2 Nov., the 607th was attached to the 95th ID.Tank Busters (1945). p. 24. Attacks toward Metz continued. The first main effort began with the crossing of the Moselle River south of Uckange by the 1st Bn of the 377th IR, the 2nd Bn pushing south from Maizieres-les-Metz and the advance to the southeast and east by the 378th and 379th Infantry Regiments. That same day, bazooka teams of the 607th crossed the Moselle to support the 1st Bn of the 377th. During the week of 12–19 Nov., the battalion re-equipped with the self-propelled M36 tank destroyer, armed with a 90mm gun, and returned to combat just in time for the final attack on the city. Lt. Col. Harald S. Sundt, battalion commander, received the Oak Leaf Cluster to the Silver Star for his success in directing the Battalion in artillery and anti- tank support of the 95th Division from 8 to 20 November during the attack on Metz. The 95th, including the 607th and other attached units, received a commendation letter from General George S. Patton for their part in the battle at Metz. On 23 November, the battalion moved along the Moselle River to the vicinity of Ars-Laquenexy (six miles southeast of Metz). The Saar Battles and Moving to the Defensive As the 95th ID pushed to the northeast, the Germans fought a delaying action back through the Maginot Line toward the Saar River and the Siegfried Line which bordered on the east side of the Saar River. On 28 November, the 1st platoon of Co. C was defending the town of Falck, waiting for the arrival of the infantry, when a barrage of artillery was laid down followed by a German ground attack. Time after time the enemy attempted to take the town but were beaten off at each attempt. Platoon commander, 1st Lt. George King was awarded the Silver Star for his leadership during the defense of the town.Tank Busters (1945). p. 28. For the remainder of the month, the companies, supporting the infantry regiments, moved on a seven-mile front to within three miles of the Saar River near Saarlautern. As December began, the battalion continued to close on the Saar and Saarlautern. As the 95th arrived in the outskirts of Saarlautern, two of the three bridges across the Saar were blown with the one in the center of town still being intact. The 379th IR secured the bridge during the night of 2 December, and on the 3rd, the destroyers of 1st platoon of Co. B moved across the bridge to assist with securing the bridgehead. The platoon helped the infantry repulse an enemy infantry/tank counterattack, knocking out four tanks while losing one M-36.Cole (1950). p. 518. Two members of the 607th were awarded Distinguished Service Cross's, Cpl Eugene L. LaFountain (WIA) and 1st Lt. Richard A. Reynolds (KIA), for their actions in the bridgehead area.Tank Busters (1945). p. 32. Attacks continued into Saarlautern-Roden and Fraulautern. With the enemy's thrust into the Ardennes, offensive action in the bridgehead slowed and units took up a defensive posture, preparing to counter any potential massed German attacks. Reconnaissance of defensive positions began in earnest throughout the division sector. Routes and terrain were reconnoitered and observation posts established. The 607th recon platoons continued to maintain contact with units of the 106th Cavalry Group on the division's right flank. In Saarlautern, actions against the Siegfried Line continued. Co. B was attached to the 94th Infantry Division on 14 January 1945, assisting in the capture of and then providing AT defense for Tettingen. On the 18th, the enemy attacked and Co. B destroyed five tanks. Co. A relieved Co. B with the 94th ID and on the 24th, they destroyed five enemy tanks. Cos. A and B of the 607th were relieved by the 704th Tank Destroyer Battalion while Co. C continued to support the 95th ID in Saarlautern. Against the Siegfried Line On 27 January, the 95th was relieved by the 26th Infantry Division and was ordered to assemble in Belgium north of Bastogne. The battalion, on the coldest day of the winter, marched 150 miles to the vicinity of Houffalize. On 2 February, they were relieved from attachment to the 95th ID and attached to the 87th Infantry Division, which was closing on the enemy as they withdrew from the Ardennes bulge.Tank Busters (1945). p. 36. For the third time, they were facing the Siegfried Line. Complicated by mud, which made cross country movement impossible, the attack began. Units advanced against numerous pill boxes, neutralizing them and moving to the next. By early March, the key towns of Olzheim, Neuendorf and Ormont were taken and the Siegfried Line was breached. The 87th continued to advance eastward; mines, blown bridges and artillery frequently holding up movement. The Kyll River was crossed and by 9 March, the area to the Ahr River had been cleared. During the next five days, all 607th units remained in place and conducted maintenance. On 14 March, the Division was ordered to march to a position facing Koblenz. The next mission was to take this town. During the night of 16 March, Co. A supported the 347th Infantry Regiment's crossing of the Moselle River and subsequent advance southeast toward the Rhine River. On 18 March, Co. C crossed the Moselle and accompanied the 345th Infantry Regiment into Koblenz. Later that day they fired at Fort Konstantin. Within the next two days Koblenz was captured. Direct fire caused 14 officers and 85 men to surrender the fort, one of the last positions taken. The Rhine Battles The battalion assembled near Nortershausen, 10 miles southwest of Koblenz. The 347th IR crossed the Rhine in boats against heavy 20mm fire on the 25th, with support provided by Co. A firing at targets near Ober-Lahnstein. Co. C supported the 345th IR's crossing at Boppard, Germany. Later that day, Co. C and one platoon of Co. A were ferried across at Boppard and moved to support the expansion of the bridgehead.Tank Busters (1945). p. 43. Two tanks of Co. B, 735th Tank Battalion and two tank destroyers of the 2nd platoon, Co. C, were the first armor with the 87th ID to cross the Rhine River. Following the crossing, German resistance decreased and it was necessary to form a fast moving armored unit to reach into the German rear areas to disrupt communications and cut up administrative units and installations. Task Force Sundt was formed, composed of the 607th, less A and C companies, Co. A of the 735th Tank Battalion, the 87th Rcn. Troop, K Co. of the 346th IR, 2nd platoon Co. C of the 312th Eng. Bn and supporting fires from the 335th Field Artillery Battalion. The task force was divided into three companies plus a CP group. The unit assembled at Dachsenhausen, which was the limit of the divisions advance. On 27 March at 0545, the Task Force moved toward Ruppertshofen, reaching the town by 0830 where it regrouped. By 1300, Nastatten had been secured and the TF was across the Muhl River. Over the next four days, units of the TF overcame resistance varying from light to heavy, blown bridges and road blocks, all the while collecting hundreds of prisoners, to take numerous small towns and on the 31st the entire TF was continuing to clear the woods west of Butzbach. On 1 April, the Task Force was disbanded, having taken 1485 prisoners and advancing 76 miles.Tank Busters (1945). p. 52. Companies A and C, with combat teams from the 87th ID, had continued to advance along the flanks of the Task Force. Armored thrusts had moved well to the east of the Division's advance leaving it in the rear areas. On 3 April, Co. A was attached to the 6th Cavalry Group and joined them at Huhlbach. On the 4th, the battalion with Companies B and C moved to assembly areas in the vicinity of Ronshausen with the 345th and 346th IR's. Company A was relieved from attachment to the 6th Cav. Group and rejoined the battalion. The following day the 87th went back on the offensive. All three companies moved to the vicinity of Oberschonau with the infantry regiments. Task Force Sundt was reconstituted at Tambach on the 10th and again divided into three companies. With clearance from the 89th Infantry Division to move through their area to the north, the TF proceeded northwest through Ohrdruf and Arnstadt. They then turned south back into the 87th's sector, cutting behind the enemy lines. The first opposition, heavy direct and artillery fire, was met at Trassdorf, SE of Arnstadt. Before Trassdorf could be taken, new orders were received directing the TF to head east through Stadtilm to Rudolstadt. Meanwhile, Co. A with the 347th IR was advancing in the southern part of the Division's zone, eventually meeting determined resistance at Cottendorf. After a TD was hit and set afire, Sgt. Dominic Karr evacuated a wounded man under small arms and artillery fire. Lt. Grant W. Claymore rescued two more men from the burning TD, earning a Distinguished Service Cross for his heroism.Tank Busters (1945). p. 54. By evening, the TF and the three IR's held a line generally from just outside Stadtilm southwest to Angstedt, a distance of seven miles. The 607th TD Bn crossing the Saale River at Saalfeld, Germany, April, 1945 An attack on Stadtilm was initiated on 12 April by the 1st and 2nd companies of the task force along with units of the 346th IR. The speed of the attack resulted in a bridge across the Ilm River being captured and the town was taken. The two companies continued moving east towards Rudolstadt, where they began meeting resistance, but by nightfall the southwest part of town had been taken. The next day, with the assistance of the 346th IR, the attack continued with the goal of capturing an intact bridge across the Saale River but this was not to be. All bridges had been blown so they raced towards Saalfeld, again finding the same conditions. A bridgehead was established and on the 14th the task force crossed the newly erected treadway bridge and headed east towards Peuschen, meeting resistance a few miles west of the town. After losing an M-8 and crew to bazooka fire, the town was taken and the task force bivouacked for the night in Wernburg. Meanwhile, 607th Companies A and C continued to advance with the infantry regiments behind the task force companies, with Co. A moving through Schmorda to Moxa and Co. C crossing the bridge at Weissen, then advancing a few miles before darkness. The next day the task force continued to move eastward, passing through numerous small towns against light resistance. With the 2nd company in the lead, they intercepted a sizeable enemy force moving from Langenbuch on foot and in wagons. Joined by 1st Company, all the enemy were killed, captured or dispersed. The two companies moved east to Thierbach where heavy resistance was encountered and they stopped for the night. The next morning, the Burgermeister was contacted and surrender of the town and garrison was requested on threat of destruction. The request was refused. While directing operations against a heavily defended roadblock in the center of town, Capt. J. Laverne Nicklas, Commander of 2nd Company, was killed by a sniper. The Task Force companies pulled back from the town and 1st Company destroyed Thierbach with direct fire, taking seventy five prisoners, including a colonel.Tank Busters (1945). p. 57. Units of Co. A, with part of the 347th Infantry Regiment advanced through more small towns and were able to seize a bridge over the White Elster River in Plauen. They then drove through Plauen to Oelsnitz, meeting no resistance but firing on fleeing Germans. Co. C seized the bridge at Elsterberg, destroying an 88mm anti-tank gun, and secured the high ground east of town. On 18 and 19 April, Task Force Sundt remained in place patrolling to the east and on the 20th, the TF, less the infantry company, assembled in the vicinity of Neuensalz. This 2nd TF Sundt had traveled 109 miles and captured 1344 prisoners in nine days. The Germans had pitted the 11th Panzer Division, the so-called \\"Ghost Division\\", in the 87th Division's zone to \\"stem the tide\\" to no avail. Two tanks, 11 trucks, 4 half- tracks, 3 armored cars, 6 wagons, 3 tractors, 3 motorcycles, 3-75mm guns and 1-105mm gun were destroyed while losing 1 tank, 2 M-8's, 1-M-20 and 1 half- track.Tank Busters (1945). p. 62. During the two-week period of 23 April – 6 May, elements of the Battalion remained in defensive positions, conducting equipment maintenance. To prevent unnecessary casualties, as Russian and American forces closed, limiting lines were established. For the 87th Division it was the Mulde River. On the 6th, the Task Force was dissolved while the 346th and 347th IR's, with Companies A and C in support, advanced about 12 miles to the east toward Falkenstein. On 7 May, the Battalion CP, Reconnaissance Company and Company B moved to Friedrichsgrün, four miles southeast of Falkenstein. On the 8th and 9th, Companies A and C assembled with the Battalion. Peace had been signed. The greatest of all wars was finished and the lights went on again all over Europe.Tank Busters (1945). p. 64. Following a period serving as occupation troops, the 607th departed Marseille, France, aboard the USAT George Washington, arriving in the Port of New York, NY, on 26 October 1945. The unit was deactivated on 27 October 1945, at Camp Kilmer, New Jersey.

Dragon Ball is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Akira Toriyama. The story follows the adventures of Son Goku from his childhood through adulthood as he trains in martial arts and explores the world in search of the seven orbs known as the Dragon Balls, which summon a wish-granting dragon when gathered. Along his journey, Goku makes several friends and battles a wide variety of villains, many of whom also seek the Dragon Balls. The series was serialized as 519 individual chapters in the magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from December 3, 1984 to June 5, 1995. These chapters were collected by Shueisha into a series of 42 tankōbon volumes; the first released on September 10, 1985 and the last on August 4, 1995. Between December 4, 2002 and April 2, 2004, the manga was re-released in a collection of 34 kanzenban, which included a slightly rewritten ending, new covers, and color artwork from its original magazine run. A sōshūhen edition that aims to recreate the manga as it was originally serialized in Weekly Shōnen Jump with color pages, promotional text, and next chapter previews, was published in 18 volumes between May 13, 2016 and January 13, 2017. There have been two anime adaptations, both produced by Toei Animation; the first, also named Dragon Ball, adapted the first 194 chapters of the manga, while the second is titled Dragon Ball Z and adapted the remaining 325 chapters of the series. The North American distributing company Viz Media has released all 42 volumes in English. Viz initially titled volumes seventeen through forty-two of the manga Dragon Ball Z to reduce confusion for their readers.

It remains the deadliest tornado to affect the South Florida county, and it is estimated to have been the most intense tornado to strike the Miami area. The tornado caused five deaths and produced damage totals that were estimated near $200–300,000 (1925 USD). 35 people were also hospitalized because of injuries. The tornado remains the only tornado to cause multiple fatalities in Dade County. While officially unrated, it is estimated that the tornado likely produced F3-level damage based on photographs taken after the passage of the supercell. Summary The exact path and strength of the tornado are uncertain, since it occurred prior to modern records which began in 1950. The first tornadoes to directly receive damage ratings on the Fujita scale occurred in 1971. The 1925 tornado was first reported in its formative stage over the Everglades near Hialeah, where several golfers noted a funnel cloud around 1:00 p.m. Hail was reported with the parent thunderstorm prior to the sighting of the funnel cloud. The slow movement of the storm was accompanied by a large number of people outside during the Sunday afternoon, which led to a considerable number of reports; several reports originated from passing motorists. The vortex touched down around 1:15 p.m., and the tornado was described as a \\"very slender\\" funnel that frequently lifted from the ground for brief periods. The debris swirling around the rotation was compared to smoke from \\"burning oil.\\" Later, as it passed west of Miami, the slow-moving tornado passed over and destroyed the state's largest dairy farm, killing one person and injuring 20 people. Losses from the farm reached $100,000. The tornado eventually intensified and destroyed numerous properties northwest and north of the city of Miami, causing at least three deaths. Some residents successfully attempted to flee in automobiles, though the cars were wrecked and some were thrown for distances. The tornado became obscured by rain, weakened, and dissipated over the northern portion of Biscayne Bay, though it destroyed some power poles along the eastern half of its damage path. Hail associated with the storm was measured to in diameter, damaging automobiles and residences' roofs. The damage path was less than in width, and the funnel was visible for nearly one hour. The thunderstorm that spawned the tornado also affected the communities of Ojus, Little River, Biscayne Park, and Lemon City, having traversed the region from Homestead to Fort Lauderdale. In total, the tornado demolished nearly 50 residences. Five fatalities were related directly to the tornado or injuries from flying debris. One of the deaths occurred inside a restaurant; the building was demolished and a cookstove thrown . Hundreds of people were homeless after the storm, and several residences were destroyed at Biscayne Park.

The plant uses five concentrated solar dishes or reflectors which were manufactured and installed by Solar Systems. This is expected to save up to 100,000 litres of diesel fuel per year. The integration of solar farm and diesel power is a first for Ergon Energy. The dishes contain 112 square mirrors each measuring 1.1 m across. The five solar reflectors sit atop 13 m masts and can rotate 360°. The array will produce about 180 kilowatts of electricity for up to 10 months of the year. The total cost of the project was A$4.5 million with $1 million being provided by the federal government. The solar farm was opened in December 2008, and on sunny days will supply the total daytime electricity requirements for the town of Windorah, with a population of 100. When the solar power runs low the existing diesel power station provides electricity. Not all of the dishes are used all the time. Some dishes are parked depending on the town's energy requirements. In 2013, Ergon Energy reported that the plant was operating effectively, with environmental conditions such as dust and wildlife having some impact on the reliability of the solar farm.

Ananda Marchildon Named Holland's Next Top Model Prior to HNTM Marchildon was born and raised in Canada and moved to the Netherlands when she was 10 years old. When she was in her early twenties she started to occupy abandoned buildings, due to resistance to her parents. On a TV show and in certain news papers Marchildon was described as a former drug addict. This statement was not true, however, she did use soft drugs in her squatter period, which is legal in the Netherlands. Another untrue media hype is that she got professional help at a rehab center to get off the drugs. Marchildon never did go to a rehab because she decided to stop smoking pot herself.\\"Ik bén geen junk\\" – donderdag 14 augustus 2008 – DePers.nl Holland's Next Top Model, Cycle 4 Marchildon competed against ten other contestants to win Cycle 4 of Holland's Next Top Model. She was selected as one of the finalists to enter the 'Top Model mansion'. Half of the judging panel often criticized her performances and personality as being 'too insecure' and 'closed'. Although she is naturally a brunette, Marchildon was dyed blonde for her third makeover on the show. Career Before her appearance on the show, Marchildon did some modeling work. As part of the prize package awarded to her, Marchildon received a €75,000 contract with ModelMasters The Agency. She was also to appear on the cover of Grazia magazine, and, for four months, to be the new face of the ICI PARIS XL Beauty Channel and she won a Citroën sponsored by ICI PARIS XL. She was also part of the final runway show in Cycle 11 of America's Next Top Model. However, when ModelMasters The Agency was acquired by the New York-based modeling agency Elite Model Management, they canceled the contract with Marchildon, giving as reason that she was too fat for modeling, after having paid only €10,000 of the contractually agreed €75,000. Marchildon sued, and won. As of 2012, she stopped modeling.

Composition and reception Mozart received a commission for three quartets in 1785 from the publisher Franz Anton Hoffmeister. Hoffmeister thought the G minor Quartet (K. 478) was too difficult and that the public would not buy it, so he released Mozart from the obligation of completing the set. Nine months later, Mozart composed this quartet anyway, completing it on 3 June 1786.Melvin Berger, Guide to Chamber Music, 2001, Dover. p. 300 Movements The work is in three movements: # Allegro, common time # Larghetto, 3/8, A-flat major # Allegretto, cut time Editions and versions The C. F. Peters Edition set of parts has rehearsal letters throughout the whole work; the Eulenburg Edition study score has measure numbers but no rehearsal letters, the same goes for Bärenreiter. Discography Before CDs, almost all repeats were ignored to bring the whole piece at about 24 minutes in duration, thus allowing it to fit on one side of a phonograph record; the other side could then have the K. 478 at about 22 minutes (with repeats also ignored). Following all repeats brings the piece to about 29 to 30 minutes. Alfred Brendel has recorded this work with members of the Alban Berg Quartett (without second violinist Gerhard Schulz); the Angel Records disc includes Brendel and the quartet playing the Piano Concerto in A major, K. 414. However, it is far more common to pair this Quartet with the K. 478 Quartet; to give two examples: the Hyperion CD with Paul Lewis and the Leopold String Trio, and the Naxos recording by the Menuhin Festival Piano Quartet. The CBS Masterworks recording with Yo-Yo Ma, Jaime Laredo, Isaac Stern and Emanuel Ax, in addition to the two Quartets, also includes the Kegelstatt Trio, K. 498.

Opened in May 2007, the park was designed by landscape architect Tom Oslund and is owned by the city of Minneapolis. It takes its inspiration from the Native American mounds that are found throughout Minnesota, and its name from Gold Medal flour, a product of General Mills. It consists of a mound, reached by a spiral walkway rising out of a green lawn with 300 trees. The park, just east of the Guthrie Theater, provides the Mill District neighborhood with some rare green space. Built on a strip of land next to the Guthrie Theater and the Mississippi River, the park features specially designed luminescent benches, a prominent mound and mature trees brought in from as far away as New Jersey. The William W. and Nadine M. McGuire Family Foundation leased the land for 10 years, starting in 2007, from the city of Minneapolis and the Guthrie, each of which owns about half of the property. In 2014, the Gold Medal Park Conservancy purchased the majority of the parkland owned by the Guthrie, then secured a 50-year lease for the rest of the land, owned by the City of Minneapolis. Across the street from the park and adjacent to the river is Remembrance Garden, which is a tribute to the victims of the I-35W Mississippi River bridge collapse. It was dedicated on August 1, 2011, the fourth anniversary of the collapse.

Named by Charles Lucien Bonaparte, in 1841, it is usually thought to contain a single genus, Ichthyosaurus, which is known from several species from the Early Jurassic. In 2013, Fischer et al. named and described Malawania anachronus from the middle Early Cretaceous of Iraq. It was found to share several synapomorphies with the type species of this family, Ichthyosaurus communis, and a large phylogenetic analysis recovered these species as sister taxa. Despite its geologically younger age, M. anachronus was also assigned to Ichthyosauridae. Phylogeny Fischer et al. (2013) applied the name Ichthyosauridae Bonaparte, 1841 for the clade that contains Malawania anachronus and Ichthyosaurus communis. This clade was recovered in the phylogenetic analysis that was based on the largest currently available data matrix of parvipelvian species. Most other phylogenetic analyses, that were based on smaller matrices, also recovered this clade or found M. anachronus to be in a more basal position. Ichthyosauridae was recovered as the sister taxon of Baracromia, a clade first defined by Fischer et al. (2013) that includes all other thunnosaurs.

Technical Characteristics Callao was built at Cavite, the Philippines by the Manila Ship Company,Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships 1860–1905, p. 167 intended for Spanish colonial duty in the Philippines. She was both launched and completed in 1888. She had two masts and a steel hull, and was unarmored.The Spanish–American War Centennial Website: Gunboat Callao Operational history Her Spanish crew unaware that the Spanish–American War had broken out, Callao was steaming toward port in Manila Bay on 12 May 1898 when she was taken completely by surprise by the presence and hostile actions of the U.S. Navy's Asiatic Squadron under Commodore George Dewey and was captured by the protected cruiser . Callao immediately was put into American service with Lieutenant B. Tappan in command, and was commissioned officially into the U.S. Navy on 17 July 1898Per The Spanish–American War Centennial Website: Gunboat Callao and the Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships, although Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships 1860–1905, p. 167, and The Spanish–American War Centennial Website: Spanish 2nd-Class Gunboats both claim the commissioning date was 2 July 1898 as gunboat USS Callao, with Lieutenant Tappan remaining in command. Callao served through the remainder of the Spanish War as tender to Commodore Dewey's flagship—the protected cruiser —as part of Dewey's squadron. She took part in the 13 August 1898 attack on Manila, serving on the left flank of Army forces, who credited her for very effective gunfire support to the troops ashore.The Spanish–American War Centennial Website: Spanish 2nd-Class Gunboats After the war, Callao ranged throughout the Philippines, patrolling to suppress smuggling, covering Army scouting parties operating against Philippine insurgents, transporting troops, and firing on insurgent positions, until decommissioned for repairs at Cavite on 21 February 1901. Upon her recommissioning on 20 December 1902, Callao carried supplies among the Philippine Islands until February 1903, when she arrived at Hong Kong to begin 13 years of service patrolling the coast and rivers of China with the Yangtze Patrol, together with several other gunboats that the US Navy had captured during the Spanish–American War. Along with her participation in the exercises, maneuvers, and visits of the Asiatic Fleet, she gave essential protection to American citizens and interests, often threatened by political disturbance in volatile China. Callao was decommissioned at Hong Kong on 31 January 1916, and then sailed for Olongapo, Luzon, the Philippines, where she laid up. While laid up, she was classified as a patrol gunboat with hull number PG-37 on 17 July 1920. Callao was redesignated as a ferry and returned to service with hull number YFB-11 in June 1921. She served in the 16th Naval District as a ferryboat in the Philippines until sold for scrap at Manila on 13 September 1923.

A perfectionist, he expected the highest standards of performance from its members. Its voice was a choir voice, its individual voices not tolerated. He set new standards in choral technique and interpretation. For almost fifty years, until it disbanded in 1951 on the retirement of its founder, the Glasgow Orpheus Choir had no equal in Britain and toured widely enjoying world acclaim. Their repertoire included many Scottish folk songs arranged for choral performance, and Paraphrases, as well as Italian madrigals, English motets and the music of the Russian Orthodox Church. The choir also performed the works of Johann Sebastian Bach, George Frideric Handel, Felix Mendelssohn, Peter Cornelius, Johannes Brahms and others. He wrote the choral work All in the April Evening (words by Katharine Tynan) and the popular songs Westering Home and Mairi's Wedding.Traditional Scottish Songs - Mhàiri's Wedding retrieved 12 Sept 2011 Roberton was knighted in the 1931 New Year's Honours.

Currently, the oldest known ophthalmosaurid is Mollesaurus from the early Bajocian of Argentina. Named by George H. Baur, in 1887, it contains the basal taxa like Ophthalmosaurus. Appleby (1956) named the taxon Ophthalmosauria which was followed by some authors, but these two names are synonyms, Ophthalmosauridae has the priority over Ophthalmosauria.  Phylogeny  Ophthalmosaurus Ophthalmosauridae is a node-based taxon defined by Ryosuke Motani (1999) as \\"the last common ancestor of Brachypterygius extremus and Ophthalmosaurus icenicus and all of its descendants\\". The definition he proposed for Ophthalmosauria was exactly the same. In this case both definitions are synonyms. The cladogram below follows the topology from a 2010 analysis by Patrick S. Druckenmiller and Erin E. Maxwell. Valentin Fischer, Edwige Masure, Maxim S. Arkhangelsky and Pascal Godefroit (2011) described a new genus of Ophthalmosauridae. They redefined it as \\"the last common ancestor of Arthropterygius chrisorum and Ophthalmosaurus icenicus and all of its descendants\\". In this case Ophthalmosauria isn't a junior synonym of Ophthalmosauridae. The cladogram below follows Fischer et al. 2011. * _Note_ : Placement of Ophthalmosauria by definition. Fischer et al. (2012) described another new genus of Ophthalmosauridae. They defined for the first time two subfamilies within the Ophthalmosauridae, Ophthalmosaurinae and Platypterygiinae. Ophthalmosaurus and Platypterygius were found to be non- monophyletic. Ophthalmosauridae was characterized by a reduced extracondylar area, a plate-like dorsal trochanter, a humerus with a facet for an anterior accessory element and the absence of notching on the paddle elements of the forefin.

Earlier publications and cricket websites had equated Dean with another Yorkshireman, a William Henry Dean, born in Leeds on 25 November 1928 with no known date of death. Dean was a right-handed batsman and a right-arm fast- medium bowler. Along with fellow Yorkshireman Malcolm Walker, he was picked by Somerset for the match against the touring Indian side at the County Ground, Taunton from 28 May 1952. Somerset batted first and reached 193 for eight wickets when Dean batted at No 10, joining all-rounder Johnny Lawrence, who had recommended him to the county. The pair put on 133 for the ninth wicket, only 13 short of the county side's then ninth wicket record, and Lawrence made an unbeaten 103, his first century after six years of county cricket. Dean made 21 before being bowled by Vijay Hazare. When the Indians batted, Dean opened the bowling, but spin bowlers took the wickets. In Somerset's second innings, Dean came in just before the declaration and was unbeaten without scoring. He again failed to take wickets in India's second innings, bowling four overs for just four runs. This match proved to be Dean's only taste of first-class cricket. Somerset had scope to offer only one special registration contract, and it went to Walker, whose batting had failed but who had taken three wickets; Dean departed the county and never played first-class cricket again. Identification and later life Authors Stephen Hill and Barry Phillips, writing a series of books outlining the lives of all Somerset first- class cricketers, discovered that the man commonly held to be William Dean the Somerset cricketer was never a cricketer at all, and set about finding the real person. William Frederick Dean, the correct player, was identified through contact with a surviving daughter and she supplied the authors with details and photographs. According to the book, Dean had a complicated sporting and personal life. He played good standard league cricket and, like Walker, impressed Johnny Lawrence at Lawrence's cricket school at Rothwell enough to suggest the trial for Somerset; having failed that, he became a professional at Stockport Cricket Club and other northern clubs, but his long- term career was in accountancy and in a range of businesses including betting shops and a fishing bait enterprise. His private life became more tangled when, married with a daughter, he eloped with the sixteen-year-old daughter of a farmer, and then further complicated when, because of a dodgy business deal, he felt obliged to change his name to \\"Bill Barrett\\" by deed poll; under this new name, he opened a Yorkshire jazz club, performing himself on the saxophone. He died in a hospice in York at the age of 68 from cancer of the oesophagus and sternum brought on, his family believed, by a blow to the chest from a cricket ball in his youth.

In the Paleogene, the province formed the Thulean Plateau, a large basaltic lava plain,Brittle tectonism in relation to the Palaeogene evolution of the Thulean/NE Atlantic domain: a study in Ulster Retrieved on 2007-11-10 which extended over at least in area and in volume. The plateau was broken up during the opening of the North Atlantic Ocean leaving remnants existing in Northern Ireland, bits of western Scotland, the Faroe Islands, bits of northwestern Iceland, eastern Greenland and western Norway and many of the islands located in the north eastern portion of the North Atlantic Ocean. The igneous province is the origin of the Giant's Causeway and Fingal's Cave. The province is also known as Brito-Arctic province (also known as the North Atlantic Tertiary Volcanic Province) and the portion of the province in the British Isles is also called the British Tertiary Volcanic Province or British Tertiary Igneous Province. The British Tertiary Volcanic Province (based on Emeleus & Gyopari 1992 and Mussett et al. 1988) with UK map shown in context of the world map. Formation Isotopic dating indicates the most active magmatic phase of the NAIP was between ca. 60.5 and ca. 54.5 Ma (million years ago) (mid-Paleocene to early Eocene) - further divided into Phase 1 (pre-break-up phase) dated to ca. 62-58 Ma and Phase 2 (syn-break-up phase) dated to ca. 56-54 Ma. Continuing research also indicates that continental plate movement (Eurasian, Greenland, and North American), that regional rifting events, and that seafloor spreading between Labrador and Greenland may have begun as early as ca. 95-80 Ma, ca. 81 Ma, and ca. 63-61 Ma respectively (late Cretaceous to early Paleocene). Studies have suggested that the modern day Iceland hotspot corresponds to the earlier 'North Atlantic mantle plume' that would have created the NAIP. Through both geochemical observations and reconstructions of paleogeography, it is speculated that the present day Iceland hotspot originated as a mantle plume on the Alpha Ridge (Arctic Ocean) ca. 130-120 Ma, migrated down Ellesmere Island, through Baffin Island, onto the west coast of Greenland, and finally arrived on the east coast of Greenland by ca. 60 Ma. Extensive outpourings of lava occurred, particularly in East Greenland, which during the Paleogene was then adjacent to Britain. Little is known of the geodynamics of the opening of the North Atlantic between Greenland and Europe. As the Earth's crust was stretched above the mantle hotspot under stress from plate rifting, fissures opened up along a line from Ireland to the Hebrides and plutonic complexes were formed. Hot magma over 1000 °C surfaced as multiple, successive and extensive lava flows covered over the original landscape, burning forests, filling river valleys, burying hills, to eventually form the Thulean Plateau, which contained various volcanic landforms such as lava fields and volcanoes. There was more than one period of volcanic activity during the NAIP, in between which sea levels rose and fell and erosion took place. Volcanic activity would have started with volcaniclastic accumulations, like volcanic ash, quickly followed by vast outpourings of highly fluid basaltic lava during successive eruptions through multiple volcanic vents or in linear fissures. As mafic low viscosity lava reached the surface it rapidly cooled and solidified, successive flows built up layer upon layer, each time filling and covering existing landscapes. Hyaloclastites and pillow lavas were formed when the lava flowed into lakes, rivers and seas. Magma that did not make it to the surface as flows froze in conduits as dikes and volcanic plugs and large amounts spread laterally to form sills. Dike swarms extended across the British Isles throughout the Cenozoic. Individual central complexes developed with arcuate intrusions (cone sheets, ring dikes and stocks), the intrusions of one centre cut through earlier centres recording magmatic activity with time. During intermittent periods of erosion and change in sea levels, heated waters circulated through the flows altering the basalts and deposited distinctive suites of zeolite minerals. Activity of the NAIP 55 million years ago may have caused the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum, where a large amount of carbon was released into the atmosphere and the Earth substantially warmed. One hypothesis is that the uplift caused by the NAIP hotspot caused methane clathrates to dissociate and dump 2000 gigatons of carbon into the atmosphere.

Dependent upon various regional locations, the NAIP is made up of MORB (Mid Ocean Ridge Basalt), alkali basalt, tholeiitic basalt, and picrite basalt. Basaltic volcanic rocks up to thick cover in east Greenland. Numerous intrusions related to hot-spot magmatism are exposed in the coastal region of east Greenland. The intrusions show a wide range of compositions. The Skaergaard intrusion (Early Cenozoic or about 55 million year age) is a layered gabbro (mafic) intrusion that has mineralized rock units enriched in palladium and gold. In contrast, the Werner Bjerge complex is made up of potassium- and sodium-rich (alkaline) granitic rock, containing molybdenum. Locations of submarine central complexes within the NAIP include * Anton Dohrn Seamount * Rosemary Bank * Blackstones Bank * Brendan * Erlend Within Britain The British portion of the NAIP, particularly West Scotland, provides relatively easy access, compared to the largely inaccessible basalt fields of West Greenland, to deeply eroded relics of the central volcanic complexes. Locations of major intrusion complexes within the British part of the NAIP include: * Lundy Island * Mourne Mountains * Slieve Gullion -Ring of Gullion AONB * Arran * Mull * Ardnamurchan * Rùm * Eigg * Skye * St Kilda * Rockall Those occurrences within the Hebrides are sometimes referred to as the Hebridean Igneous Province. Other notable locations with NAIP landforms within Britain: * Giant's Causeway – Polygonal basalt columns, which seen from above are large hexagonal pavements * Canna and Sanday – Basalt lava field with great thicknesses of boulder conglomerate, examples of periods of erosion by fast flowing rivers in between the lava flows. * Rathlin Island – Paleogene and Neogene lava flows * Fingal's Cave on the Isle of Staffa – Polygonal basalt columns eroded to form a cave * Ailsa Craig – Volcanic plug * Cleveland Dyke, North Yorkshire – Dyke swarm related to the Mull intrusive complex * The dike complexes of the NAIP contain many examples of dolerite dike swarms found throughout the British Isles. Within Ireland Carlingford, County Louth is the only location of a major intrusion complex within the Irish part of the NAIP. History of geological studies The intensity of scientific investigation within the NAIP has made it one of the most historically important and deeply studied igneous provinces in the world. Basalt petrology was born in the Scottish Hebrides in 1903 led by the eminent British geologist Sir Archibald Geikie. From the outset Geikie studied the geology of Skye and other Western Isles taking a keen interest in volcanic geology and in 1871 he presented the Geological Society of London with an outline of the 'Tertiary Volcanic History of Britain'. Following Geikie many have tried, and continue to study and understand the NAIP, and in doing so have advanced knowledge in geology, mineralogy and in more recent decades geochemistry and geophysics.
