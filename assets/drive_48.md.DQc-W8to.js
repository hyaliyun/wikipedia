The PlayStation version was released by Acclaim in North America and PAL regions. The game is a 3D fighter which combines the normal features of an arcade fighting game with psychic powers. There are eight playable characters and a final boss who is playable through the use of a code. Psychic Force was released without much hype and was not commercially successful. Psychic Force would later get an arcade-exclusive update titled Psychic Force EX, which was released a year later in 1996. EX made the final boss playable without using a code, added new color schemes for the costumes, and improved and balanced the gameplay. In 1998, a sequel was released under the title Psychic Force 2012 also for the arcade, and was ported to the Dreamcast console in 1999. It was eventually adapted to the PlayStation under the title Psychic Force 2, which was released in Japan on October 7, 1999 and later to the PAL regions in 2001. In 2006, the original Psychic Force was re- released as part of as an anniversary pack for the PlayStation 2 titled Psychic Force Complete, which had included Psychic Force 2012 and a special exclusive remixed version of 2012 titled Psychic Force 2012 EX. Gameplay All combat in Psychic Force takes place in a cubic space defined by a magical force field. The fighters float inside this space and are capable of movement in all directions. Even though Psychic Force is structured as a 3D game, the gameplay is in 2D. The walls of the force field play a big part in the strategy behind Psychic Force. A character takes damage when they're forced into a wall by their opponent. The characters do not take damage, however, if they move into the wall themselves. If a character takes another hit as they bounce off from the wall, the character will become stunned and fall through the air. The character is eventually invulnerable while they're falling. As in most fighting games, the first character to win two rounds wins the match. If time runs out, the players are taken to a sudden death round in which the space is much smaller and both characters have 0% Psycho Gauge. The first person to land an attack in this sudden death round wins the round. When the player is fighting a computer-controlled opponent, however, the character with more health remaining when time runs out wins that round, without going to sudden death. The characters are controlled with an eight directional joystick and three buttons which dictate a guard, a light attack, and a heavy attack. By combining these different commands, the player can make combo attacks, throws, and special moves which can break the enemy's defenses. A character's special move is determined by the Psycho Gauge, which is seen under the Life Gauge of the character. Depending on the type of special move initiated, the Psycho Gauge will immediately drain from within sight and once the character uses up their entire Psycho Gauge, they'll be left with the only option to unleash continuous weak projectiles until the Psycho Gauge is charged back up, either through an automatic slow charge or a manual fast charge in which the player can press all three buttons to help re-charge their Psycho Gauge. Other tactics in Psychic Force include a Barrier Guard, which can be used to help protect a character from both physical attacks and special moves but drains the Psycho Gauge real quickly, an Evasion Barrier, in which the character can immediately put up a force field and avoid slamming against the wall even though it uses up 40% of the Psycho Gauge, a Normal Dash which enables a character to move real quickly in any direction from within sight, and a Quick Dash which enables a character to move real fast towards their opponent while being able to deflect any weak projectile that gets in their way. In both the original arcade version and home console Story Mode of Psychic Force (but not later revisions of the arcade version), the player's character goes through eight stages of combat against a specific set of opponents and face off against a specific final boss in the eighth and final stage, which varies and depends on the specific player character's story. The home console Story Mode adds additional cut-scenes in order to advance the story. Story The plot of Psychic Force takes place in the year 2010, where selected individuals are blessed with the power of psychic abilities. All people imbued with this power are called \\"Psychiccers\\" and uses a specific element such as fire, light, wind, electricity, gravity, time, or ice in fighting. Psychiccers are shunned by normal people in general because of their unnatural abilities and that most cases turn violent and deadly from within sight. All of that changes one day when a mysterious Psychiccer organization known as NOA appears and offers Psychiccers a place from within their company. Headed by a young British Psychiccer man named Keith Evans, NOA seeks to create a perfect utopia for Psychiccers and that they'll eliminate anyone who tries to stand in their way. Challenging NOA's ambition is a small independent group known as Anti-NOA and that one of its members, a young American Psychiccer man named Burn Griffiths, seeks to confront and stop his old friend Keith from going through with his extreme plans of creating a Psychiccer-only world. Characters * Burn Griffiths: The main protagonist of the series. A young American Psychiccer man who has the ability to use the psychic power of fire in battle. Burn seeks to find his old friend Keith so that he can convince him to give up his ambition of creating a Psychiccer-only world. * Emilio Michaelov: A young Russian Psychiccer boy who has the ability to use the psychic power of light in battle. Emilio is very scared of his own ability and only seeks peace and solitude. * Wendy Ryan: A young Australian Psychiccer girl who has the ability to use the psychic power of wind in battle. Wendy seeks to find her long-lost older sister Chris and suspects that NOA may have the answers to her questions. * Sonia (Chris Ryan): A young bioroid Psychiccer woman who has the ability to use the psychic power of electricity in battle. While Sonia serves NOA and Keith with undying loyalty, she is actually Wendy's older sister Chris, who was kidnapped and remade into a bioroid by Wong. * Brad Kilsten: A young German Psychiccer man who has the ability to use the psychic power of gravity in battle. Having a split personality disorder, Brad is unpredictable in battle as his gentle side clashes with his psychotic side. * Richard Wong: A Hong Kong Chinese Psychiccer man who has the ability to use the psychic power of time in battle. Even though Wong serves as Keith's consultant and strategist in NOA, he secretly seeks to eliminate Keith so that he can advance his own ambition of conquering the world. * Rokudo Genma: A Japanese Yamabushi monk/priest who can use Shugendo magic in battle. Genma is a unique character in that his psychic power comes from faith in the gods and takes the form of traditional magic. Genma is convinced that psychic power is a double-edged sword not meant for use by mortals and thus seeks to eliminate all Psychiccers. * Gates Oltsman: An American cybernetic soldier who relies on his own enhancements in battle. Upon surviving a devastating Psychiccer attack that had taken the lives of his wife Cheryl and their daughter Tina, Gates, who was reborn as a cyborg, seeks revenge against all Psychiccers. * Keith Evans: A young British Psychiccer man who serves as the leader of NOA and that he has the ability to use the psychic power of ice in battle. Keith's ultimate goal is to create a utopia for Psychiccers and that he'll eliminate anyone who tries to stand in his way. Development Acclaim gave Psychic Force minimal localization, not even replacing the Japanese voice acting or J-pop intro song; instead, they simply added subtitles to the cutscenes. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Psychic Force on their June 1, 1996 issue as being the third most-successful arcade game of the year. The PlayStation version received mediocre reviews. A reviewer for Next Generation said that while the 3D movement seems innovative at first, it is only a novelty and, in combination with the limited number of close-range attacks, makes the fights dominated by cheap projectile attacks. He remarked, \\"On the positive side, Psychic Force does sport some nice - and if truth be told, very innovative - projectile weapons and background graphics. Unfortunately, these positive factors don't do enough to make up for the game's consistently mediocre gameplay.\\" The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly similarly commented that the game seemed innovative at first, but was essentially a standard fighter with a heavy reliance on cheap projectile attacks and characters who all use the same move set apart from a few special attacks. They cited the anime video sequences as the game's strong point. Scary Larry of GamePro praised the music but found the combos lacking, and concluded, \\"The game can be mastered easily, which makes it boring in the long run. In all, Psychic Force is a Force to be reckoned with - at least as a rental.\\" M! Games gave it a score of 52/100. OVA In 1998, a two-episode anime OVA was released, animated by Triangle Staff. The first episode describes Keith's escape from the laboratory where he was being experimented on. Burn almost hits him with his motorcycle, and takes a frightened Keith home. Three men in dark suits come looking for Keith, who uses his psychic abilities to injure two of them, and chase the third out. When Burn tries to help Keith escape, they are ambushed and, despite Keith's best efforts, he is dragged away, leaving Burn lying on the ground, which awakens his powers. The second episode features Keith and Burn several years later, where Keith has been taken under the wing of Wong, head of NOA. Keith declares his vision of peace to the world, and begins to round up lost Psychiccers. Burn's dormant psychic abilities are detected by Gates, who tries to attack Burn, but Burn is saved by Keith and Sonia. While Burn is in NOA HQ with Keith, he berates him for trying to start a war between humans and Psychiccers, then leaves with Wendy and Emilio. He eventually heads back to confront Keith, but their fight is interrupted by Wong who triggers the self-destruct for the NOA HQ. Keith traps Burn in a cocoon of ice, leaving him as the only survivor. This anime OVA's English dub was produced by RLJ Films, and came out in 2002 in the U.S. For some reason, all of the voice actors remain unknown. Psychic Force: Puzzle Taisen There is a spin-off puzzle game, similar in style to Puzzle Bobble, known as Psychic Force: Puzzle Taisen, developed by C. P. Brain and published by Taito, which was released on October 2, 1997 for Sony PlayStation in Japan only.

Essentially a \\"fake\\" mobile tower acting between the target mobile phone and the service provider's real towers, it is considered a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. The 3G wireless standard offers some risk mitigation due to mutual authentication required from both the handset and the network. However, sophisticated attacks may be able to downgrade 3G and LTE to non-LTE network services which do not require mutual authentication. IMSI-catchers are used in a number of countries by law enforcement and intelligence agencies, but their use has raised significant civil liberty and privacy concerns and is strictly regulated in some countries such as under the German Strafprozessordnung (StPO / Code of Criminal Procedure). Some countries do not have encrypted phone data traffic (or very weak encryption), thus rendering an IMSI-catcher unnecessary. Overview A virtual base transceiver station (VBTS) is a device for identifying the international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) of a nearby GSM mobile phone and intercepting its calls. It was patented and first commercialized by Rohde & Schwarz in 2003. The device can be viewed as simply a modified cell tower with a malicious operator, and on 4 January 2012, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales held that the patent is invalid for obviousness.MMI Research Ltd v Cellxion Ltd & Ors [2012] EWCA Civ 7 (24 January 2012), Court of Appeal judgment invalidating Rohde & Schwarz patent. The GSM specification requires the handset to authenticate to the network, but does not require the network to authenticate to the handset. This well-known security hole is exploited by an IMSI catcher. The IMSI catcher masquerades as a base station and logs the IMSI numbers of all the mobile stations in the area, as they attempt to attach to the IMSI-catcher. It allows forcing the mobile phone connected to it to use no call encryption (A5/0 mode) or to use easily breakable encryption (A5/1 or A5/2 mode), making the call data easy to intercept and convert to audio. The 3G wireless standard mitigates risk and enhanced security of the protocol due to mutual authentication required from both the handset and the network and removes the false base station attack in GSM. Some sophisticated attacks against 3G and LTE may be able to downgrade to non-LTE network services which then does not require mutual authentication. Body-worn IMSI-catchers that target nearby mobile phones are being advertised to law enforcement agencies in the US. IMSI-catchers are often deployed by court order without a search warrant, the lower judicial standard of a pen register and trap-and-trace order being preferred by law enforcement. They can also be used in search and rescue operation for missing persons. Police departments have been reluctant to reveal use of these programs and contracts with vendors such as Harris Corporation, the maker of Stingray and Kingfish phone tracker devices. In the UK, the first public body to admit using IMSI catchers was the Scottish Prison Service,https://theferret.scot/imsi-catcher-trial-scottish-prison-service/ though it is likely that the Metropolitan Police Service has been using IMSI catchers since 2011 or before.  Functionalities  = Identifying an IMSI = Every mobile phone has the requirement to optimize the reception. If there is more than one base station of the subscribed network operator accessible, it will always choose the one with the strongest signal. An IMSI-catcher masquerades as a base station and causes every mobile phone of the simulated network operator within a defined radius to log in. With the help of a special identity request, it is able to force the transmission of the IMSI. = Tapping a mobile phone = The IMSI-catcher subjects the phones in its vicinity to a man-in-the-middle attack, appearing to them as a preferred base station in terms of signal strength. With the help of a SIM, it simultaneously logs into the GSM network as a mobile station. Since the encryption mode is chosen by the base station, the IMSI-catcher can induce the mobile station to use no encryption at all. Hence it can encrypt the plain text traffic from the mobile station and pass it to the base station. There is only an indirect connection from mobile station via IMSI-catcher to the GSM network. For this reason, incoming phone calls cannot generally be patched through to the mobile station by the GSM network, although more modern versions of these devices have their own mobile patch-through solutions in order to provide this functionality.  Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS)  False base station attacks are prevented by a combination of key freshness and integrity protection of signaling data, not by authenticating the serving network.Chris Mitchell, Paulo Pagliusi: Is Entity Authentication Necessary?, in Security Protocols, Springer LNCS 2845,pages 20-29, 2004 To provide a high network coverage, the UMTS standard allows for inter-operation with GSM. Therefore, not only UMTS but also GSM base stations are connected to the UMTS service network. This fallback is a security disadvantage and allows a new possibility of a man-in-the-middle attack.  Tell-tales and difficulties  The assignment of an IMSI catcher has a number of difficulties: # It must be ensured that the mobile phone of the observed person is in standby mode and the correct network operator is found out. Otherwise, for the mobile station, there is no need to log into the simulated base station. # Depending on the signal strength of the IMSI-catcher, numerous IMSIs can be located. The problem is to find out the right one. # All mobile phones in the area covered by the catcher have no access to the network. Incoming and outgoing calls cannot be patched through for these subscribers. Only the observed person has an indirect connection. # There are some disclosing factors. In most cases, the operation cannot be recognized immediately by the subscriber. But there are a few mobile phones that show a small symbol on the display, e.g. an exclamation point, if encryption is not used. This \\"Ciphering Indication Feature\\" can be suppressed by the network provider, however, by setting the OFM bit in EFAD on the SIM card. Since the network access is handled with the SIM/USIM of the IMSI-catcher, the receiver cannot see the number of the calling party. Of course, this also implies that the tapped calls are not listed in the itemized bill. # The assignment near the base station can be difficult, due to the high signal level of the original base station. # As most mobile phones prefer the faster modes of communication such as 4G or 3G, downgrading to 2G can require blocking frequency ranges for 4G and 3G.  Detection and counter-measures  Some preliminary research has been done in trying to detect and frustrate IMSI-catchers. One such project is through the Osmocom open source mobile station software. This is a special type of mobile phone firmware that can be used to detect and fingerprint certain network characteristics of IMSI-catchers, and warn the user that there is such a device operating in their area. But this firmware/software-based detection is strongly limited to a select few, outdated GSM mobile phones (i.e. Motorola) that are no longer available on the open market. The main problem is the closed-source nature of the major mobile phone producers. The application Android IMSI-Catcher Detector (AIMSICD) is being developed to detect and circumvent IMSI-catchers by StingRay and silent SMS. In alpha stage in October 2016. Technology for a stationary network of IMSI-catcher detectors has also been developed. Several apps listed on the Google Play Store as IMSI catcher detector apps include SnoopSnitch, Cell Spy Catcher, and GSM Spy Finder and have between 100,000 and 500,000 app downloads each. However, these apps have limitations in that they do not have access to phone's underlying hardware and may offer only minimal protection.

Flash drives adhering to the U3 specification are termed \\"U3 smart drives\\". U3 smart drives come preinstalled with the U3 Launchpad, which looks similar to the Windows OS start menu and controls program installation. Applications that comply with U3 specifications are allowed to write files or registry information to the host computer, but they must remove this information when the flash drive is ejected. Customizations and settings are instead stored with the application on the flash drive. Microsoft and SanDisk created a successor called StartKey. SanDisk began phasing out support for U3 Technology in late 2009.  U3 platform  = U3 disk mounting: hardware emulation = A U3 flash drive presents itself to the host system as a USB hub with a CD drive and standard USB mass storage device attached. * This configuration causes Windows disk management to show two drives: *# A read-only ISO 9660 volume on an emulated CD-ROM drive with an autorun configuration to execute the U3 LaunchPad, and; *# A standard flash drive (FAT formatted) that includes a hidden \\"SYSTEM\\" folder with installed applications. * U3 compliant applications can be (optionally) preloaded by manufacturers. = U3 Launchpad = The U3 Launchpad (LaunchU3.exe) is a Windows program manager that is preinstalled on every U3 smart drive. The U3 Launchpad automatically starts at insertion of a U3 enabled device. = U3 applications = To be fully U3 compliant, an application has to be programmed to clean up its own data from the local machine. It must also be packaged in U3's special program format. U3 applications will only run from a U3 device. U3 programs can be downloaded from the U3 website and other places. Applications include Opera and Skype and do not need to be installed on the computer.  APIs  The U3 application programming interfaces (APIs) allow U3 programs lower-level access to USB flash drive, and to query the drive letter. The U3 APIs primarily allow developers who choose to use more of the power of U3 to control how their application handles things like device removal and saves data back to the drive such as configuration or documents. = Compatibility = The latest version of U3 launchpad supports Windows 2000 with Service Pack 4, Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8. Data can be accessed using any OS capable of reading from USB mass storage devices, unless the U3 device is password-protected. =Issues with older versions= Early versions of the U3 launchpad software had Vista compatibility issues (specifically the SanDisk Cruzer Titanium series with device numbers 2.17, 2.18, 2.19 and 2.20), although this problem could be eliminated by updating the launcher software. Prior to Sandisk's updated launcher software being released, Microsoft supported U3 by releasing an update to Vista.  Developer resources  Information on building U3 compliant applications and the U3 software development kit were available to registered developers at the official U3 website. Individuals must register (as a company) to download the SDK, or participate in the forums. Applications that do not require installation steps in order to run can easily utilize U3 with little or no modification by taking steps to either not modify the host systems files or registry, or undoing all changes when the application terminates. A wizard which packages distribution files and creates the special \\"manifest\\" file is provided. As of May 2009, the software development kit was no longer available; the u3.com website is no longer available.  Removal  Reformatting the drive will remove some of the software (the hidden \\"SYSTEM\\" folder), but not all of it. The virtual CD-ROM drive cannot be removed by reformatting because it is presented to the host system as a physical device attached to a USB hub; the official U3 Launchpad Removal Software was available on the U3 website and disabled the virtual CD drive device, leaving only the USB mass storage device active on the U3 USB hub controller, at which point the remaining software can be removed by a subsequent format, performed by the removal software itself. u3_tool is another option that includes the ability to remove the virtual CD-ROM drive, as well as ways to reconfigure it to the user's liking.  Criticism  Numerous criticisms have been made of the U3 platform. These criticisms are: ;Malware-like integration behaviour: Software comes preinstalled on USB disk and, when using stock Windows settings, roots itself in the system similar to malware. U3 removal is possible, but requires complete data backup. ;Questioned use: There are already portable versions of many Windows software available, some of which do not require any proprietary solution to work. ;Removed user data, but not all of it: Recent files and programs had it listed. ;Freezing with certain CD writing software: There is a possibility of slowing down or freezing Windows XP Pro if certain Windows drivers that are associated with high-volume data transfers to CD writers using certain CD/DVD burning software installed. ;Proprietary format/closed platform: The U3 platform is a \\"closed\\" platform / proprietary format. SanDisk, the rightsholders for U3, ask for a 5% royalty from USB flash drive manufacturers who wish to implement the platform on their products. ;Two drive letters: As a work-around to the lack of Auto-Play for Flash drives on older versions of Windows, the U3 software creates two drive letters (one which presents itself as a CD to allow Windows' auto-play to start the launcher, and another for storing user data). Although this is the only way to implement auto-start functionality on pre-Windows XP systems, it could be considered a kludge, and the extra drive letter created can be an annoyance. However, it is possible to prevent Windows from allocating a drive letter for the \\"CD drive\\" via the Windows \\"Disk Management\\" tool‚Äîas long as the user has the appropriate rights/authority to do so. ;Incompatibility with certain embedded systems: Some host systems - such as photo kiosks, consumer electronics, and other embedded computing devices - cannot correctly mount U3 \\"smart drives.\\" The problem may arise because the emulated CD-ROM is the first drive presented to the host system. As such, the device is detected as a CD-ROM drive or not at all. Although some newer photo kiosks are U3 aware and can overcome this limitation, it still exists on many platforms.

Doctrinally, the church describes itself as fundamentalist, evangelical, and separatist. Most of its members live in Northern Ireland, where the church is headquartered, and in County Donegal. The church has additional congregations in the Republic of Ireland, Great Britain and Australia, and a sister denomination in North America that has congregations in Canada and the United States. It also has a sister denomination in Nepal which was formed from the Nepal mission to the Unreached in November 2013.http://hebronfpc.org/_assets/Nepal%20mag%20LO%20RES.pdf The current Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church is Rev Gordon Dane, minister of the founding church in Crossgar. John Armstrong is the current Deputy Moderator. Founding The Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster began on 17 March 1951 (St Patrick's Day) as the result of a conflict between some members of the local Lissara Presbyterian congregation in Crossgar, County Down, Northern Ireland, and the Down Presbytery of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland. At a meeting on 8 January 1951, the Down Presbytery banned the elders of the local congregation from using the church hall for a Gospel mission. When two elders refused to accept the Presbytery decision, they were immediately suspended. As a result of this disagreement with the Presbytery, five of the seven session members, all the Sunday School teachers, and 60 members of the congregation withdrew from the Down Presbytery and the Presbyterian Church in Ireland. College lecturers of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland have suggested that the above story, though often quoted, is incomplete. While the Gospel Mission was a reason for the breakaway church forming, the Presbytery objection was not to the Mission or to the Gospel, but to the invited preacher, Ian Paisley. The Lissara Mission went ahead with a different preacher and Lissara Presbyterian Church continued to exist (albeit with fewer members), and a number of dissenting members later returned. However Free Presbyterians from Crossgar dispute that there ever was such a mission. Lisburn Free Presbyterian Church The departing elders felt the Presbyterian Church in Ireland denomination was inconsistent in allowing dances and parties to be held in the church halls while at the same time refusing a Gospel mission under the leadership of Ian Paisley. The Free Presbyterian Manifesto, which was published during the time leading up to the founding of the new church, also mentioned other reasons for the secession, such as the failure of the 1927 heresy trial in the Presbyterian Church in Ireland (PCI) to unseat Professor Davey for his controversial views, membership in the World Council of Churches (which the PCI later left), and poll irregularities in the election of elders.Moore and Dick, pp26‚Äì30 In that year, under the leadership of Paisley, four new congregations joined together to form the Presbytery of the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster. Sydney Lince served as Moderator of the new church for a few months, but perceiving that Paisley was keen to take on the role, he stood down and asked Paisley to replace him.Clifford Smyth, Ian Paisley: Voice of Protestant Ulster, p5 One of the inaugural elders of the new church, George Gibson, was expelled for his views on the doctrines of holiness as he was an Arminian, and subsequently rejoined Lissara Presbyterian Church in 1958. He had been the first secretary of the new church, had served as the architect of the first church building in the new denomination, and his office had been used as the registered office of the denomination.Moore and Dick, pp151‚Äì152 Recent history =Internal strife= The appointment of Paisley as First Minister of Northern Ireland in May 2007 led to a great deal of controversy within the Free Presbyterian Church. Many members of the church claimed that such an appointment put Paisley, as Moderator, at odds with many of the core beliefs of his church. The church had declared some years previously that it would be unbiblical to have terrorists or ex-terrorists in the government of Northern Ireland. The church is also strongly opposed to homosexuality, yet the First Minister's office is responsible for protecting LGBT rights in Northern Ireland. One of Paisley's strongest critics was his erstwhile ally and former prison cellmate Ivan Foster. A stormy meeting of the Presbytery of the church in September 2007 resolved the crisis by agreeing that Paisley would step down as Moderator in January 2008. The Presbytery met in Dungannon on 18 January 2008 to elect a new Moderator and selected Ron Johnstone, who had been Deputy Moderator. Paisley was therefore replaced as Moderator after more than 50 years in the post. =Opposition to homosexuality= Following a number of high-profile comments made by Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) Member of Parliament (MP) Iris Robinson, the Advertising Standards Authority upheld a finding that an advertisement placed by the Kirk Session of the Sandown Free Presbyterian Church breached advertising codes. The church had taken out the 540-word advertisement in the News Letter on 1 August 2008 (one day before the annual Belfast Gay Pride event) describing \\"homosexuality as an abomination, defined homosexuals as perverts and called on religious followers to maintain a very public stance against the gay community.\\" The decision was later overturned and the church cleared of all wrongdoing. Doctrine The church adheres to Calvinist doctrines. It also self-describes as fundamentalist which it sees as an appropriate term to describe its stance of being anti-liberal. Christian fundamentalism has evolved over the years to where the original five essential doctrines that one had to hold to be considered fundamentalist‚Äînamely: the inerrancy of the Bible, the literal nature of the Biblical accounts, the Virgin Birth of Christ, the bodily resurrection and physical return of Christ, the substitutionary atonement of Christ on the cross‚Äîwere mixed in with a healthy dose of \\"biblical separatism\\", a doctrine that advocates avoiding any public or private worship with people of other denominations that it considers apostates or heretics. At the start of Paisley's ministry this separatism was focused heavily on the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, a denomination from which it drew many of its initial members. For the FPC the main target of its doctrinal ire, however, has always been and still continues to be the Roman Catholic Church. From 2011 until 2015 its main website greeted visitors with a statement on the FPC's disapproval of the Roman Catholic mass, disputing \\"the false notion... that there is little difference\\" between the mass and Protestant communion. Baptism and the Lord's Supper are recognised as sacraments of the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster. Members are allowed to determine the proper mode (immersion, pouring, sprinkling) and subjects (adult believers or believers' children) that they prefer, but the church does not sanction baptismal regeneration. The Lord's Supper is observed monthly, unless a local congregation prefers a more frequent observance. Alongside the Free Presbyterian Articles of Faith, the Westminster Standards are considered doctrinal standards subordinate to the Bible. On account of their additional adherence to the Articles of Faith, and because of their baptismal views, some regard the church as only nominally Presbyterian, nearer to Calvinistic Baptists, and more nearly allied to modern Fundamentalist Christianity. For many outside the church, political and religious opposition to the Roman Catholic Church, considered by the Free Presbyterians to be a Protestant Reformation principle, represents the single most distinctive characteristic of this denomination, not least because this was a distinctive characteristic of Ian Paisley's own theological outlook. Ecclesiology The FPC (on 18 May 2005) published a Book of Church Order in which its governmental policies and procedures are set forth publicly. The polity of the FPC includes allowing a cleric such as Paisley to hold an apparently indefinite term of office as Moderator. However, following a dispute over Paisley's political activities, he agreed to step down as Moderator in January 2008. He was succeeded by Ron Johnstone. The North American branch of the denomination has elected its own moderator since 2005. Churches worldwide From four churches in 1951, the denomination grew and peaked at 75 by 1997. Today it has about 60 congregations in Northern Ireland and a total of about 100 throughout the world, including England, Scotland, the Republic of Ireland (chiefly in County Donegal and County Monaghan), Canada, the United States, Nepal and Australia. According to the 2011 Northern Ireland census, the church has 10,068 members in Northern Ireland. As of 2004, missionaries were serving in India, Jamaica, Kenya, the Republic of Ireland, Spain, the Philippines and Germany. Since then new mission fields have opened in Liberia, Nepal and Uganda. In Kenya the church's 4 missionaries work with the Bible Christian Faith Church. In Liberia the forming Free Presbyterian Church in Liberia has 4 congregations. The church currently operates two Bible colleges for the training of ministers and missionaries. These are the Whitefield College of the Bible, formerly based in Banbridge, County Down, but now relocated to Belfast, and the Geneva Reformed Seminary in Greenville, South Carolina, USA. The church in North America has been independent of the Ulster Presbytery since 2005, and has its own Moderator. Frank McClelland was the first Moderator, and he was succeeded in 2006 by David Mook (a minister in Phoenix, Arizona). The two Presbyteries are in full communion with each other. A Free Presbyterian International Congress was held 19‚Äì23 June 2006 in Martyrs Memorial Free Presbyterian Church in Belfast. This event saw Free Presbyterians from all over the world gather in Northern Ireland for a week of meetings. The Nepal Free Presbyterian Church also elects its own Moderator, currently the Rev Paul Thapa. This Presbytery is also in full communion with the other two. Church layout Free Presbyterian Churches are usually of simple design, cohering with Protestant ideals, dating back to the Reformation. This contrasts with traditional Roman Catholic and Anglican Churches, which tend to be well-ornamented in design. The church states that this shows humility and allows the member to focus on worship. Interior of Tandragee Free Presbyterian Church Churches usually include the following: * Pulpit ‚Äì Generally centre focal point, adorned with a pulpit fall. * Communion table ‚Äì Sits in the centre of the church, at the front, usually in front of the pulpit (if the pulpit is in the middle). * Pews ‚Äì These differ in design and shape. * Organ/piano ‚Äì Nearly all churches will have some sort of musical accompaniment. This is usually a piano, with larger churches owning an organ. * Verse of Scripture ‚Äì A verse of the Bible is placed on the wall behind the pulpit, where it is most visible. This can be painted or letters which are affixed to the wall. * Prayer room/cr√®che ‚Äì A prayer room is located via a different door to the main hall. Depending on the financial capabilities of the church, the prayer room and cr√®che may be together. The cr√®che is used for young children, and has a window whereby one can see the preacher, and perhaps a speaker system for audio. * Depending on the size and finances of the church, there may be additional rooms such as Youth Fellowship rooms, Sunday School rooms, and kitchens. Church motto and logo Burning bush logo and motto The motto of the Free Presbyterian Church is the same as the Presbyterian Church in Ireland: Ardens sed virens (\\"burning but flourishing\\"). It is incorporated in a scroll form on the logo, shown here. In all Free Presbyterian Churches, the pulpit fall bears the motto and logo of the Church, albeit in slightly different designs.

Belmont is situated on a sandy peninsula formed by the Tasman Sea on the east and Lake Macquarie. History The area around Belmont was inhabited by the Awabakal tribe of Aborigines. In 1825 Reverend Lancelot Edward Threlkeld established a mission at Belmont. He established small scale farming of wheat and Indian Corn and employed the local Aboriginal people to help him. While doing so, Threlkeld recorded phoenetically the language of the Awabakal and produced the first serious works on Aboriginal language, its grammar, usage, and relation to other Aboriginal tribal languages. Thomas Williamson (1833‚Äì80) was born in the northernmost island of Unst, Shetland Islands in a town called Belmont. He was the third settler in the Lake Macquarie area and in 1865 selected 100 acres, including Bahtahbah (site of Rev. Threlkeld's old Aboriginal mission) to settle. On the rising land leading to the top of the hill, near the corner of Walter and Victoria Streets (and what became, many years later the Infants School) he built a large residence to serve as a guest house, naming it after the town of his birth \\"Belmont\\" House. It is thought the village which grew up around it may have assumed the name from the house. As the village grew, some of the streets were named after his children: Ada St leads down to the yacht club, Maude St comes from Cahill Oval down to the water at the baths. Walter St would have come right past the old Belmont house whilst Alick (named for Alexander) and Ernest Sts marked the eastern boundary of the original acreage. Thomas St, outside the shopping centre, is named after Thomas Williamson himself. On the eastern side of the old house Williamson planted a vineyard, facing towards the lagoon, and to the north an orchard including banana trees. In 1874 he erected the first church just near where George St meets the highway, and the Belmont Post Office was opened in 1877 with Thomas Williamson himself as Postmaster. He continued in this capacity until his death. He was also the first licensee of the Belmont Hotel, which opened nearby the church. In 1873, realising that there were enough children in the local village to warrant the existence of one, he opened the first school, a single-roomed building, next to Maudeville Cottage. John Anderson bought \\"Anderson's Hill\\" in 1870 and built a guesthouse called \\"Bellevue\\" after which the road was named. The area from Ross St on the water, to Lewers St was bought by Robert D. Lewers, Sydney Manager of the Bank of London and subdivided in 1916, known as Lewers Estate for many years. The land around the lake was of such poor quality, apart from in small patches, that as early as 1828, Henry Dangar, Government Surveyor, knew that it was more suited \\" to the retired naval, military or civil officer, or to the merchant, inclined to quit the busy scene, one who is fond of shooting, fishing, or hunting, or boat sailing, where he can enjoy living with a most salubrious air...\\" Any industrial use or mining in the lake was constrained by the terrible nature of the bar on the lake's entrance at Swansea. Hence, in order to provide to a larger need for lifestyle and recreation, rather than industrial use, the issue of transport was vital. The road had been a major problem from almost the beginning of the township's life. It was reported as \\"one of the worst in the colony\\" ‚Äì only 12 miles from Newcastle but taking two and a half to three hours by dray. Guesthouses failed to thrive because of the severity of the road conditions and really it was not until the road was formally fixed in the 1910s, and the Pacific Highway came through in the 1920s, that Belmont was able to make the most of its beautiful surroundings, and the township started to thrive.Belmont: From Dreaming to Federation. Author Paul Brown, Dobson & McEwan print In addition, the New Redhead Estate & Coal Company extended their trainline to Belmont, where both a station and coal-loading ramps and sidings were constructed. Passenger trains ran every day of the week to Belmont. The line was closed in 1991. Through urbanisation and the use of the hills to the north and north-east of the peninsula, Belmont has become one of the major centres of Lake Macquarie. The suburb itself is currently (2011 census) the fourth-largest by population, with the surrounding locality (consisting of Belmont North, Floraville and Jewells) the largest locality within the jurisdiction of Lake Macquarie City Council. Population According to the 2016 census of Population, there were 7,114 people in Belmont. * Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 3.0% of the population. * 85.2% of people were born in Australia. The next most common country of birth was England at 2.4%. * 90.9% of people only spoke English at home. * The most common responses for religion were No Religion 27.4%, Anglican 23.0% and Catholic 20.6%. Facilities Belmont is home to many shops, restaurants and many other amenities. Belmont and the surrounding locality also include 4 primary schools (Belmont Public School, Belmont North Public School, Floraville Public School and Jewells Public School); 2 secondary schools, Belmont High School and Belmont Christian College, along with a tertiary institution in the form of a campus of TAFE NSW (formerly Hunter Institute of TAFE). Belmont Hospital, located on Croudace Bay Road, is the only public hospital in Lake Macquarie. Belmont Baths, a public swimming enclosure measuring 70m in length and 45m in width, re-opened to the public on 22 December 2018. https://www.lakemac.com.au/page.aspx?&pid;=2495&vid;=26 Transport Until May 2006, Aeropelican (now FlyPelican) operated scheduled passenger services from Belmont Airport to Sydney Airport. The discontinuation of these services has all but closed the airfield, with owners seeking to develop the land. Belmont Airport is now privately co-owned by Red Bull Air Race pilot Matt Hall and a skydiving company. Coal Diesel railcar prepares to leave Newcastle Station for Belmont, c1972 John Darling Colliery Many collieries, large and small, sought coal from the coal seams which were plentiful in the Belmont area, the largest of these being the BHP's John Darling Colliery at Belmont North. The New Redhead Estate & Coal Mining Company operated a railway until recent times from Belmont to Adamstown, a suburb of Newcastle, where it joined the New South Wales Government Railways Main Line. The railway carried passenger trains as well as coal trains and served several collieries. Also, situated on a spur line just south of Belmont railway station, was a large railway coal loading facility, whereby motor trucks from collieries as far afield as Swansea, New South Wales, could load their coal into railway trucks for transporting to Newcastle's port. The smaller collieries closed due to the 1960s - 1970s slump in the industry, the last being Belltop Colliery. The larger collieries closed later.

Beard is an American manager. He was appointed to become director- general of the International Baccalaureate (IB), based in Geneva, Switzerland, starting on 1 January 2006, following the retirement of the previous director- general, George Walker. Beard was born in Akron, Ohio in 1950 and attended Ellet High School. He then went on to study at the US Naval Academy, graduating in 1972 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Analytical Management. He also holds an MBA from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìOshkosh and an MS from Iowa State University. Most recently, Beard worked as division president and Chief Operating Officer Seeds for Syngenta AG, a Swiss agribusiness based in Basel. He has also served as an officer in the US Navy (Groton, CT; Brawdy, Wales, UK) and worked for Procter and Gamble (paper products: Mehoopany, PA; Green Bay, WI) and Pioneer Hi-Bred, Int'l (Johnston, IA, USA; Paris, France; Parndorf, Austria). Beard gave a speech at Chautauqua Institution in August 2010 on reforming education. Chautauqua Institution officials later discovered the speech was not Beard's original work, as it drew heavily upon a speech given earlier in the year by Sir Ken Robinson at a TED conference. According to a letter printed in the Chautauquan Daily, Beard used \\"identical quotes, phrasing and even anecdotes.\\" The Institution issued an apology to those who attended the talk, saying \\"Beard's behavior in this matter is not characteristic of the work done here at Chautauqua and violates the expectations you should have for that work. We acknowledge to you our genuine disappointment in this event.\\" Beard's explanation was that he had not intended to pass off the work he quoted as his own, but acknowledged that he could and should have made it more obvious that he was citing the work of others, most particularly Sir Ken Robinson, whom he admires greatly and quotes frequently. Staff at the IBO were surprised by the incident, as Beard is generally well-regarded and known for his honesty and integrity throughout his life and career. After his term at IB, Beard was hired in 2014 by GEMS Education to lead the development and innovation of its education programmes.http://www.arabianbusiness.com/dubai-s-gems-hires-former- baccalaureate-chief-535938.html#.VqxMHrIrLcs He also provides academic consultancy services.

Early career Vivian was the son of John Vivian (1750‚Äì1826), of Truro, Cornwall, and his wife Betsey, daughter of the Reverend Richard Cranch, and the brother of John Henry Vivian. He was educated at Truro Grammar School,Nicholas Carlisle, A concise description of the endowed grammar schools in England, vol. 1 (1818), p. 151 then at Harrow and Exeter College, Oxford, Vivian entered the army in 1793, and less than a year later became a captain in the 28th Foot. Under Lord Moira he served in the campaign of 1794 in Flanders and the Netherlands. At the end of the expedition, the 28th bore a distinguished part in Lord Cathcart's action of Geldermalsen. In 1798 Vivian was transferred to the 7th Light Dragoons (later Hussars), and in Sir Ralph Abercromby's division was present in the Helder campaign in Holland at the battles of Bergen and Alkmaar (19 September to 6 October 1799). Peninsular War In 1800, he received his majority, and in 1804 he became lieutenant colonel of the 7th. In command of this regiment he sailed to join Lieutenant-General Sir David Baird at Corunna in 1808, and took part in Lord Henry Paget's cavalry fights at Sahag√∫n and Benavente. During the retreat of Lieut-General Sir John Moore's army the 7th were constantly employed with the rearguard. Vivian was present at the Battle of Corunna, and returned with the remainder of the army to England. It was not until September 1813 that the 7th returned to the Peninsula. On 24 November, Vivian (now colonel and aide-de-camp to the Prince Regent) was appointed to command a light cavalry brigade (13th and 14th Light Dragoons) under Rowland Hill, 1st Viscount Hill in Wellington's army. With this corps he served at the Battle of the Nive (9‚Äì13 December). In January 1814, Vivian transferred to lead a light cavalry brigade in William Carr Beresford's corps. The 1,000-strong unit included the 18th Hussars and the 1st King's German Legion Hussars. Vivian took a marked part in the action of Gave de Pau and the Battle of Orthez. On 8 April, Vivian fought a brilliant action at Croix d'Orade on the Ers River, where he was very severely wounded. In this clash, the 18th Hussars seized a key bridge intact, helping Wellington to isolate the French defenders of Toulouse. At the beginning of 1815 he was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB); he had been a major general for several months. Waterloo In April 1815, Sir Hussey Vivian was appointed to command the 6th Brigade of the Earl of Uxbridge's Cavalry Division. Vivian's brigade included the 10th and 18th Hussars as well as the 1st and 2nd Hussars King's German Legion. At the Battle of Waterloo the 6th Brigade was posted on the Duke of Wellington's left flank. In the late afternoon, Vivian's regiments, with those of General Vandeleur's 4th Brigade, were ordered to move to support the centre of the line, which was under pressure from Napoleon's Imperial Guard. After the enemy were repulsed, Vivian's hussars made the final charge of the day between Hougomont and La Haye Sainte, sweeping the Middle Guard and Line units before them before breaking upon the squares of the Old Guard, which they soon learned to avoid. This service was rewarded by the thanks of both houses of Parliament, an award of the KCH, and the Orders of Maria Theresa and St. Vladimir from the emperors of Austria and Russia. After hostilities had ceased, Vivian remained in France as part of the Army of Occupation in command of the 2nd Brigade of Cavalry. In 1816 he was censured by army commander Lieutenant General Lord Combermere, under orders from the Duke of Wellington, for failing to report a disturbance in a French theatre caused by officers of the 18th Hussars. Later career Vivian sat in the House of Commons as member for Truro and then Windsor from 1821 to 1831, after which he was made commander of the forces in Ireland and given the GCH. He was also appointed to the Privy Council of Ireland in 1831. From 1825 to 1830 he was Inspector- General of the Cavalry and in 1830 was appointed a Groom of the Bedchamber, serving King William IV throughout his reign until 1837, after which he was promoted Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB). In 1835 he became Master-General of the Ordnance (until 1841) and was sworn of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom the same year. In 1837 he was elected MP for East Cornwall, sitting until 1841. He was created a baronet of Truro in the County of Cornwall in 1827. In 1841, he was elected to the Royal Society as a Fellow in February and was raised to the peerage as Baron Vivian, of Glynn and of Truro in the County of Cornwall in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in August. A year later he died at Baden-Baden and was succeeded by his eldest son, to whom he also bequeathed his recently acquired estate at Glynn, near Bodmin. Family His first marriage in 1804 was to Eliza Champion, daughter of Philip Champion de Crespigny, with whom he had the following children: * Charles Crespigny Vivian, 2nd Baron Vivian (1808-1886) * Charlotte Eliza Vivian (1815-1877), who married General Charles George James Arbuthnot * John Cranch Walker Vivian (1818-1879), Liberal politician * Jane Frances Anne Vivian (1824-1860), who married Henry John Wentworth Hodgetts-Foley * Georgina Agnes Augusta Vivian (1828-1835) He married secondly Letitia Webster, daughter of Rev.

De Ridder was a regular throughout the second half of the campaign, starting nine games and appearing a further six times as a substitute. De Ridder made his UEFA Champions League debut in September 2004, coming on as a 69th-minute substitute in a 4‚Äì0 defeat at Bayern Munich. In December 2004, he was offered an improved contract until June 2007. Part of the Netherlands side that reached the second qualifying round of the UEFA European Under-19 Championship in 2002‚Äì03, De Ridder stepped up to the U21s as the 2006 UEFA European Championship qualifying campaign kicked off. De Ridder was told prior to the 2005‚Äì2006 season that there would be no room for him in the squad and he could expect little playing time if he decided to stay. =Celta Vigo= De Ridder joined Celta de Vigo permanently on 31 August 2005. On 25 September 2005, De Ridder made his official debut for Celta when they beat Sevilla, allowing the Galician club to temporarily top La Liga. On 3 April 2006, De Ridder scored his first official goal for Celta against Atl√©tico Madrid. Throughout the second half of the campaign he was a regular for Celta, but they were relegated to Segunda Division at the end of the 2006‚Äì07 season. =Birmingham City= De Ridder signed for Birmingham City on a free transfer on 3 July 2007. He made his Premier League debut on 12 August 2007 as a substitute in the opening match of the season against Chelsea, but injured his ankle within minutes of coming on and was unable to complete the match. Though starting the League Cup defeat at Blackburn Rovers, he was not considered fit enough for League games until after the October international break, when he made a substitute appearance against Manchester City. He was a key player in Birmingham's 3‚Äì2 win against Wigan Athletic on 27 October 2007 in which he made his full home debut. De Ridder's last game for the club was in January 2008 in the FA Cup, manager Alex McLeish considering him better suited to a style of play which placed more emphasis on passing than did Birmingham's. His contract was cancelled by mutual consent at the end of the season. =Wigan Athletic= He joined Wigan Athletic the next day on a free transfer and signed a three-year deal. De Ridder got his first assist against Newcastle coming off the bench and swinging in an 89th minute corner for a dramatic Titus Bramble equalizer. He was released by Wigan at the end of the 2010‚Äì11 season.  Loan to Hapoel Tel Aviv  De Ridder moved to Israel and signed for Hapoel Tel Aviv on loan until the end of the season on 20 January 2010 after failing to make an appearance for Wigan Athletic in the 2009‚Äì10 season. Hapoel Tel Aviv were surprised to learn that De Ridder did not have an Israeli passport since the age of 3 and would have to register him as a foreigner. The club then approached the Interior Ministry to check what allowances could be made to register De Ridder as an Israeli since he is Jewish. During his time with Hapoel, De Ridder scored a crucial goal against Bnei Yehuda Tel Aviv F.C. in the 46th minute (which won the game for Hapoel). He also scored the third goal against F.C. Ashdod, a game which Hapoel won 4‚Äì0.

He scored the decisive goal in the match against Italy which ensured qualification for the semifinals. The Netherlands went on to win the UEFA U-21 Championship 2006. In 2007 De Ridder was called up by Jong Oranje coach Foppe de Haan to be part of his squad for the 2007 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship held in the Netherlands. De Ridder participated in their first round group match against Israel (1‚Äì0 win) and after the match against Portugal (2‚Äì1 win) they secured a semifinal spot and qualification for the 2008 Summer Olympics.

The A.V. Club. Retrieved December 30, 2016. In the episode, the deadly \\"Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka\\" is sighted in South Park and the town's fearless hunters, Ned and Jimbo, are on the case. Their heroic efforts drive up the ratings for their hunting show and threaten to edge out Jesus's television show, Jesus and Pals. Plot The boys are assigned to interview Vietnam War veterans; they interview Stan's uncle, Jimbo, and his friend, Ned, at the set of their own television show called Huntin' and Killin. The two claim that they single-handedly defeated the entire Viet Cong army, returning to base just in time to ride the log flume ride at the amusement park section of the camp. Mr. Garrison thinks they fabricated their report and gives them detention for the week. The boys plot revenge on Jimbo and Ned by making bogus videos of the legendary \\"Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka\\", which Jimbo and Ned then air on Huntin' and Killin. The show becomes successful, leading to a decline in ratings for their competitors, including the talk show Jesus and Pals, starring Jesus. Its producer decides to change the show's format to resemble the \\"trash TV\\" format, despite Jesus' lack of enthusiasm for the idea. Meanwhile, Jimbo and Ned go searching for the Staring Frog, which can supposedly kill with a glance. Ned sees the fake frog the boys set up and becomes comatose from pure fear. While visiting him in the hospital, the boys confess their misdeed. This leads to Jimbo, Ned, and the boys all appearing on Jesus and Pals, arranged by the show's producer. Without Jesus' knowledge, the producer arranges for them to lie on the air to improve ratings. When chaos breaks out on the show (in a parody of the Jerry Springer Show) Jesus silences the crowd and the lie is revealed. Stan apologizes for making up the stories about the Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka, and Jimbo apologizes for telling Stan that he defeated the entire Viet Cong Army. Jesus decides that he will put his old show back, and as punishment to his producer, he sends her to Hell, where she meets Satan with his partner Saddam Hussein.

Queen Dilshad)(meaning 'Happy Hearted'), also Delshad, was a Chobanid princess. She was the wife of Ilkhan Abu Sa'id Bahadur Khan, and after him Hasan Buzurg, the first ruler of the Jalayirid Sultanate, and the mother of his son and successor Shaikh Awais. Family Dilshad Khatun was the daughter of Demasq Kaja, and the granddaughter of Amir Chupan, who was the leading Mongol amir of the Ilkhanid period. Her mother was Tursin Khatun, daughter of Irinjin Kurkan, and Konchak Khatun, daughter of Ahmed Tekuder Khan, and Armini Khatun. She had three sisters, Sultan Bakht Khatun, Dendi Shah Khatun and Alam Shah Khatun. Her aunt was Baghdad Khatun, who was the wife firstly of Hasan Buzurg and after him of Abu Sa'id. Marriage to Abu Sa'id After her father's death in 1327, Dilshad Khatun was brought under the protection of her aunt Baghdad, who had become wife of Abu Sa'id after having first been married to Hasan Buzurg. When Dilshad attained maturity Abu Sa'id fell in love with her. He divorced her aunt Baghdad Khatun, and married her in 1333. At the end of life, he was not happy with his wives, but Dilshad loved very much. Therefore, Baghdad became very jealous. Widowhood After the Abu Sa'id's death in 1335, Arpa Ke'un, was chosen as his successor by the vizier, Ghiyas-al-Din Muhammad. Dilshad, who was pregnant with Abu Sa'id's child, fled to Amir Ali Padishah his uncle, leader of tribe of Oirad and governor of Diyarbakir. Her presence strengthened Ali Padishah's position. Seven months later, on 18 May 1336, she gave birth to a daughter. Marriage to Hasan Buzurg Shortly afterward Ali Padishah was defeated and killed by Hasan, a rival claimant to the throne, who then married Dilshad. She bore Hasan, three sons: Shaikh Awais, who succeeded his father in 1356; Qasim, who died in 1367-68 and was buried in Najaf, and Zahid, who was born on 3 August 1351, shortly before his mother‚Äôs death, and died in 1371-72. Political influence Dilshad brought about the death of Misr Khwaja, who had killed her father. Although married to Hasan, she remained to some extent a partisan of her Chobanid kinsmen, some of whom found temporary asylum in Baghdad. When, in the summer of 1347, her cousin Malek Ashraf led an expedition against the capital, she reportedly persuaded Hasan, who wanted to flee to the fortress of Komak on the Euphrates, to stay and defend the city. When the Chobanid army withdrew Dilshad prevented the Jalayirids from pursuit and even welcomed some of Malek Ashraf‚Äôs associates.

He gained notoriety for allegedly being involved in the June 1964 murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner. Rainey was a member of Mississippi's White Knights of the Ku Klux KlanHistory Commons Profile: Lawrence Rainey Alan Parker's Mississippi Burning is a fictionalized version of the Freedom Summer Murders. It was released in 1988 and starred Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe. Rainey died of cancer in 2002 and is buried next to his family in Kemper County, Mississippi. Background Rainey grew up in Kemper and Neshoba County, Mississippi. His parents were John and Bessie Rainey. Rainey had a younger brother who died at a young age. Rainey's education stopped at the 8th grade which was not unusual in the early 20th century. His father was a farmer, and they were likely poor sharecroppers during the Great Depression. He worked as a mechanic before starting in a career in law enforcement. Rainey started his career as a police officer working in Philadelphia, Mississippi. In October 1959, he shot and killed a black motorist who was getting out of his car, but he was not prosecuted. Rainey had a reputation as a brutal law enforcement officer. He successfully ran for the office of Sheriff in 1963 and has been quoted as positioning himself as \\"the man who can cope with situations that might arise\\", a veiled reference to the racial tension in the area at the time. One of his deputies was Cecil Price. Freedom Summer Murders In the afternoon of June 21, 1964, Chaney, Goodman, & Schwerner arrived at Longdale to inspect the burned out church in Neshoba County. They left Longdale around 3 p.m. They were to be in Meridian by 4 p.m. that day. The fastest route to Meridian was through Philadelphia. At the fork of Beacon & Main Street their station wagon sustained a flat tire. It is possible that a shot was fired at the station wagon's tire. Rainey's home was near the Beacon & Main Street fork. Deputy Cecil Price soon arrived and escorted them to the county jail. Price released the trio as soon as the longest day of the year became night which was about 10 p.m. The three were last seen heading south along Highway 19 toward Meridian. On the day of the murders, Rainey was visiting his wife at the hospital in Meridian. He allegedly left Meridian about 6 p.m. for Collinsville where he had supper with relatives. Rainey visited his stepmother in Philadelphia and then went to his office to pick up some clothing. He went to his home to pick up some gowns for his wife and left the gowns with his relatives in Collinsville, where he watched television shows Bonanza and Candid Camera, then returned home. At the trial it was alleged but not proven that he had learned of the murder early the following morning and deliberately covered it up. On July 18, 1964, Rainey unsuccessfully sued NBC, the Lamar Life Broadcasting Company, Southern Television Corporation, and Buford W. Posey for one million dollars for slander due to an interview which Posey gave to NBC during the investigation of the disappearance of the civil rights workers. Prosecution On January 15, 1965, Rainey and seventeen others learned that they were indicted. Because there was, at that time, no federal murder statute, they were charged with violation of the three men's civil rights. In 1967, the case went to trial in federal court and Rainey was acquitted, though six others were convicted. Legacy right Despite his acquittal, Rainey was stigmatized by his role in the events. His law enforcement career ended in 1968 when he was not re-elected as Sheriff of Neshoba County. As a result of the trial, his wife became an alcoholic, and they divorced. She subsequently died of a brain tumor. For years after the Freedom Summer Murders, Rainey had difficulty finding stable employment; he worked as an auto mechanic and as a security guard in Kentucky and Mississippi, including a long stint as a security guard in Meridian, Mississippi. Rainey's employers included the Matty Hersee state charity hospital and the Village Fair Mall. A stint at the IGA grocery store ended abruptly after the airing of the CBS program \\"Attack on Terror\\" in 1975; bomb threats were made against the supermarket for hiring him, and they subsequently fired him. His boss at McDonald's Security Guard Service was an African American, and Rainey described the firm as \\"better to work for than any white company\\". He later blamed the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the media for preventing him from finding and keeping jobs, and reiterated that he was not a racist: He developed throat cancer and tongue cancer, and died in 2002 at the age of 79. Media portrayals Attack on Terror: The FBI vs. the Ku Klux Klan was the first fictional version of the Freedom Summer Murders. Actor Geoffrey Lewis played as Sheriff Ed Duncan, a fictionalized Lawrence Rainey. In the 1988 film Mississippi Burning, the character of Sheriff Ray Stuckey was a fictionalized depiction of Lawrence Rainey. The part was played by Gailard Sartain.

In 1978, their version reached No. 1 in South Africa, New Zealand, Germany, France, The Netherlands, Sweden, Austria, Denmark and Belgium. It also reached No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart and remained in the UK charts for 15 weeks.

The channel primarily broadcasts lifestyle programming surrounding the Hispanic and Italian cultures, including cooking and travel-related programs, as well as coverage of international soccer, and mainstream television series and films. TLN previously broadcast in a trilingual format, carrying programming in the Italian, Spanish, and English languages (with the latter often focusing on programs starring personalities of Italian and Spanish heritage). This trilingual format was later phased out with the launch of sister digital cable channels dedicated solely to Italian- and Spanish-language programs.  History  On October 23, 2007, TLN launched TLN en Espa√±ol, a Category B Spanish language general entertainment channel. On June 5, 2012, TLN launched a high definition simulcast of its Eastern feed. In April 2018, the network introduced a new marketing campaign, Colour Your Life, to signal a shift in focus for the channel to include \\"all lovers of the mainstream cultural lifestyle\\" in addition to existing viewers, after having phased out its foreign-language programs in favour of more lifestyle programming relevant to Italian and Spanish culture. Corus Entertainment previously owned a 50.5% majority share in Telelatino Network; in 2019, it sold its interest to TLN's existing partners and Di Felice for $19 million. Programming The network primarily airs programming related to Italian and Spanish cultures, including travel and cuisine. TLN broadcasts a substantial amount of soccer programming, airing Serie A matches since 1984. After some years without Serie A broadcast, TLN secured the rights to air all matches between 2018 and 2021.http://en.calcioefinanza.com/2018/08/14/tln-media-group-seriea-canada-tv- rgihts/ and UEFA Champions League matches involving Italian and Spanish teams from 2002 to 2009. In 2009, TLN secured the rights to the UEFA Europa League to become the exclusive Canadian broadcaster of this tournament through to 2012. TLN has also broadcast the last three editions of the Copa Am√©rica, FIFA World Cup, and UEFA European Football Championship. In 2006, TLN partnered with CBC Sports to sub-license rights to FIFA tournaments, including the 2010 and 2014 FIFA World Cups, as the CBC was recently awarded the broadcast rights to various FIFA tournaments. TLN Television partners up with CBC/Radio-Canada to broadcast all major FIFA international tournaments through 2014 Additionally, the TLN networks also hold the exclusive Canadian rights to Mexican Primera Division soccer, including games broadcast over the Univision networks in the U.S. In late 2015, TLN began showing games played by the Canadian national team for both 2018 World Cup qualification cycle and 2016 Olympic Qualifying tournament. =Controversy with RAI= From its inception up until mid-2003, TLN's Italian programming was derived primarily from RAI, Italy's state owned broadcaster, which made a commitment in 1984 to supply programming to Canada through TLN for as long as TLN was licensed in Canada. A dispute arose in 2003 when the head of RAI's international channel, decided to repudiate RAI's supply obligations as well as its 2001 agreement to launch a 24-hour RAI Canada channel, in favour of challenging Canada's regulatory regime by indicating that it wanted to deliver RAI programming through its own international channel on its own terms without restriction and not through TLN or through any Canadian programming partner. Later in the same year, RAI pulled its content from TLN and petitioned the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to allow it to broadcast RAI International in Canada. Italian Channel battles for carriage This effort was backed by Rogers Communications, who sponsored RAI's application to get on the CRTC's approved list. After initially being rejected by the CRTC in 2004 in strong terms, RAI International was eventually approved by the CRTC in the spring of 2005 and began broadcasting in June 2005. After RAI International was launched in Canada, TLN began airing programming from Mediaset.

It also represents their descendants. According to Akilathirattu Ammanai, it additionally represents one who lives with Dignity. Santror Makkal is an alternative name for The Santror, frequently used in Akilathirattu Ammanai. Birth of Santror Santror Pirappu (The Birth of Santror): according to Ayyavazhi mythology, Thirumal, one of the three godheads, made Saptha Kanniyar (seven virgins) give birth to seven boys. This event is described here. The Seven Virgins were faithful devotees of Sivan. They regularly served at his feet a lump of water that they could miraculously gather in their hands. This water came from the mythical river Ayotha Amirtha Gangai in which they bathed daily. One day, Thirumal came upon these women and asked them to serve him instead of Sivan for a day. The women refused to his request, insisting they would only serve the all-powerful Sivan. Having been refused, Thirumal vowed to teach them a lesson while still fulfilling the divine plan of bringing forth his children through them. He then took seven seeds from the Seven Logas above. When the women left the river after their baths, he caused the gentle cold wind (Vayu) to blow and the rain (Varuna) to lightly fall. When the women were shivering, Thirumal appeared to them again, this time in the form of fire. The women immediately encircled the flame. Thirumal then placed the seven seeds inside the wombs of each of the women. They instantly conceived and delivered seven boys. They were called Santror Makkal. Realizing that they were delayed in their service to Sivan, the women left the infants in the river in a fist of fear and rushed to gather the water. Yet they could only gather the water in the shape of a mere ball. It was then they realized that they had been deceived. Not only could they not serve the feet of Sivan but they also could not raise the boys. They undertook a rigorous Tavam and awaited the manifestation of Thirumal as Ayya Vaikundar in Kali Yukam. He had promised to marry them and to make their sons rulers of the land by destroying the Kalineesan and Kalimayai. The Naming Ceremony of Santror In The Naming Ceremony of Santror, Thirumal, acting as a Pantaram, made the Seven Virgins, who were to give birth to seven boys using seven seeds from seven upper worlds. The seven sons were reared personally by Thirumal. One day, a grand ceremony was organized for the naming of the children. The whole pantheon of Gods and Goddesses attended the ceremony. The eminent God Isvaran gave them the first name as Chanars because, one of the characteristics of these people was ‚Äòperseverance in seeking and obtaining even the invisible goal‚Äô. The sage Vetha (Vethamuni) gave a name as Santror to signify the characteristics of nobility and integrity, Thirumal called them as Natalvar. Similarly, other gods and goddesses gave them very prestigious titular names. Having named them with great attributes, all the deities sang lullabies in praise of their glory. Sarasvati, the popular deity, praised them as children born with powers of knowledge, wisdom, and artistic skills and as the future kings who were going to rule the earth with justice, righteousness, and love. Feeding the children According to Ayyavazhi mythology the Santror Makkal born of Seven Virgins were named and after the naming ceremony, Shiva and Thirumal, wanting to feed the children with celestial nectar, commanded the celestial attendants to bring the same. When they went to bring the nectar, they found it emptied by a priest and his wife who while ‚Äòdressing themselves as per the rules of the scriptures‚Äô, had been drinking the whole measures of nectar to their full. By this, they had increased the fat in their own body, depriving others of their share. When the celestial attendants reported this matter to Shiva and Thirumal, the later rebuked the Priest and his wife, and made them grow as Palmyra trees on earth to feed his children perpetually by giving back the Celestial nectar in the form of Palm-juice. Fostering the children Now, the illustrious deity Badrakali, being commissioned by Isvaran to subdue Takkan, a wicked ruler who had squeezed the labour of the people, stood in tavam to get the sons of Mayon (Thirumal) to support her in her battle. Granting the prayer, the children were entrusted to Badrakali to be fostered with full dignity and honour. She was warned that in case of any danger befalling the sons, she would be imprisoned once for all. Badrakali accepted the condition, and received the sons. As per the instruction of Isvaran, she taught them various martial arts, occupational skills, and fine arts. The children grew into adults, made progress in different trades and occupations. They also became adept at fighting wars. Once they excelled in war, Badrakali took them to wage the war against Takkan, and in the war, they crushed the forces of the enemy with extraordinary courage and valour. As the seven sons attained the age of marriage, Badrakali arranged for their marriage with the seven daughters of Nirupathirajan, the famous king. The nuptial ceremony, being attended by the whole assembly of divinities, took place with all pomp and glory, having the brides and bridegrooms dressed in exquisite clothes and adorned with glistering ornaments. The couples lived happily under the tutelage of Badrakali and their progenies flourished. They undertook the trades of precious metals that earned them quite opulence. They excelled in martial prowess and were sought after by the kings of Chola kingdom. Even as they were living with fame and name, they drew their strength and courage from the milk they obtained from the palmyra tree that supported them. All these events took place during the last phase of the Dwapara Yukam. See also * Ayyavazhi mythology * List of Ayyavazhi-related articles * Ayya Vaikundar References * G.

He was convicted of the murder of Louis Oates, 63, and Dorothy Harris, 41. On August 25, 1992, Oates was standing on the loading dock of his Oates Oil Co. in Palestine, Texas. Patterson walked up behind Oates and shot him in the back of the head with a .38-caliber pistol. He left, but returned shortly later and shot Harris who had come outside screaming upon hearing the shots and finding Oates. Patterson then went to a friend's house where he took off his clothing and was arrested standing naked in the street. No clear motive was established for the murders, but a friend of Oates told police that Patterson and the victim had once argued over who was the better football player, Patterson or Oates' son. Patterson received a rare recommendation from the Texas Board of Pardon and Paroles that his death sentence be commuted to life on May 17, 2004 because of mental illness. Nonetheless, Governor Rick Perry refused to grant the commutation. Governor Perry explained why he refused to commute Patterson's sentence to life, \\"This defendant is a very violent individual. Texas has no life without parole sentencing option, and no one can guarantee this defendant would never be freed to commit other crimes were his sentence commuted. In the interests of justice and public safety, I am denying the defendant's request for clemency and a stay.\\" Prior to Patterson's execution, Texas had only two sentencing options for capital crimes: life with parole (with a minimum prison time of 40 years) or death by lethal injection; it did not have a life without parole option. Partially in response to the execution, in 2005, the Texas Legislature changed the capital murder sentencing law, which Governor Perry signed into law. Under the new law, the life with parole option was replaced with life without parole. (However, for any unsolved cases prior to the change in law, in the event of a conviction the life with parole option still applies.)

He was selected to lead the first party of convicts in the re- establishment of the second convict settlement at Norfolk Island. The island had been abandoned since the first convict settlement was finally removed in 1814. The new settlement was intended to be the most severe settlement, where the worst convicts would be sent, without hope of escape and offering, in Governor Darling's view, ‚Äúthe extremest punishment short of death‚Äù. With 34 soldiers, 57 convicts, and 12 soldiers' wives and children, he landed on 6 June 1825. Most of the convicts were tradesmen to clear the regrowth and prepare buildings. A treadmill was planned, but never sent. The convicts worked twelve-hour days, and the rations of salt meat and maize-meal sound unappetising, but there are no reports of harsh treatment of this working party. Thirty-one more convicts arrived in December, along with more wives. In March 1826, Turton was promoted to major, replaced by Captain Vance Young Donaldson of the 57th Regiment, and returned to Sydney.

The American Civil War was the first in which large armies depended heavily on railroads to bring supplies. For the Confederate States Army, the system was fragile and was designed for short hauls of cotton to the nearest river or ocean port. During the war, new parts were hard to obtain, and the system deteriorated from overuse, lack of maintenance, and systematic destruction by Union raiders.George E. Turner, Victory Rode the Rails The Strategic Place of the Railroads in the Civil War (1953) The outbreak of war had a depressing effect on the economic fortunes of the Confederate railroad industry. With the cotton crop being hoarded under the \\"King Cotton\\" theory, railroads lost their main source of income.Ramsdell, p. 795. Many were forced to lay off employees, and in particular, let go skilled technicians and engineers. Due to a general opinion that the war would not last long, initially Confederate rail operators did not seek, nor build, alternative sources of iron for rail construction and repair.Ramsdell Although railroad contracts to port towns had ceased, due to the combined effects of the cotton export policy and the Union naval blockade, lucrative government contracts were doled out to rail operators with lines supplying men and arms to the front line of Tennessee and Virginia. A consortium of rail operators had decided upon a universal rate for government contracts; \\"a uniform rate of two cents a mile for men and half the regular local rate for munitions, provisions, and material, and also agreed to accept Confederate bonds at par in payment of government transportation.\\"Ramsdell, p. 796. In addition, the Confederacy suffered from two key deficiencies in its rail network. First was the route structure: it was built to serve the coastal shipping industry, and most rail lines connected ports and river terminals to points inland. This lack of inter-railway connections made many railroads useless once the Union blockade was in place. Second was break of gauge; much of the Confederate rail network was in the broad gauge format, but much of North Carolina and Virginia had lines. Sometimes, as with Montgomery, Alabama, a city was served by two railroads with different gauge and different depots, meaning that through cargo had to be unloaded from one railroad and moved by animal-powered transportation to the other company's station, where it would be re-loaded. Southern railroads west of the Mississippi were isolated, disconnected, and differed widely in gauge. Several of the Northern railroads, in contrast, were complex networks in themselves, and many cities were served by more than one. The fact that most used the same gauge made transfer even easier.  History  = 1861 = As troop movement began in earnest in May and June 1861, a crippling problem was discovered; many rail lines terminated in towns without connecting to continuing lines.Ramsdell, p. 797. Instead, cargo would have to be unloaded, driven across town, and then reloaded. Soldiers and other passengers would often have to stay overnight to catch a continuing train the next day. When the Confederate government attempted to rectify this problem, they ran into local opposition. Towns preferred the lack of connection which, under the principle of the negative railroad, required the hiring of teamsters and hotel rooms. Railroad operators, while not opposed to connecting lines, were opposed to the possibility of sharing rolling stock with rival companies. Confederate raids on the Union's most relevant railroad company, the B & O, devastated tracks and rolling stock; the line quit running. However, the North had enough industrial resources to restore operations. =1862= As 1862 opened, the Confederacy built a spur off the Orange and Alexandria Railroad at Manassas Junction toward Centreville, Virginia, known as the Centreville Military Railroad. It served to supply the Confederate defenses on the Centreville Plateau along the north side of the Bull Run feed into the Occoquan River. As the war waged on, attempts were made by railroad operators to acquire railroad supplies abroad, necessitated by the Confederacy's small industrial base.Ersatz, p. 128. The problem of supplies had become increasingly acute, especially with respect to the already small supply of engines and cars. Stressed by overuse, lacking material to make repairs, and the conscription of men who could make them, rail operators were predicting a breaking point as early as 1862.Ramsdell, p. 799. While railroad operators attempted, throughout the war, to get assistance from the Confederate Congress, the response was either indifferent or hostile. =1863= In mid-1863 the Confederate government finally initiated an overall policy concerning railroads, and even then it was confined solely to aiding the war effortMary Elizabeth Massey Ersatz in the Confederacy University of South Carolina Press, Columbia. 1952, p. 128. rather than shoring up the weakening economy of the Confederate States of America. New legislation allowed commandeering (under the name of \\"impressment\\"), which brought railroads and their rolling stock under the de facto control of the military. Meanwhile, Union victory in the Chattanooga Campaign gave the United States Military Railroad full control of the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad which after repairs supplied the Atlanta Campaign. =1864= Union troops destroying a railroad In March 1864, the Confederate Quartermaster-General's Department ordered all passenger trains to give governmental trains the right of way.Ersatz, p. 129. By mid-1864, all passenger service in the Confederacy had come to a standstill. Transport of goods for civilian use was also affected, exacerbating shortages brought on by wartime devastation, speculation, hoarding, and the Confederacy's impressment policy. In the last year before the end of the war, the Confederate railroad system was always on the verge of collapse. The impressment policy of quartermasters ran the rails ragged. Feeder lines would be scrapped for replacement steel for trunk lines, and the continual use of rolling stock wore them down faster than they could be replaced.Ramsdell, pp. 809-10. Union use As the Union armies pushed further into Confederate territory, they came into possession of former Confederate railway lines, or what was left of them. Confederate troops generally applied a scorched-earth policy towards railroads when they were in retreat.Riegel, pp. 127-28. Union troops would often have to rebuild an entire line from scratch for it to be usable. Late in 1862, when Confederate forces devastated the Mississippi Central Railroad, the Union invasion came to an end. Grant later resumed the attack, pursuing the Vicksburg Campaign along the river, where steamboats could bring supplies. Sherman's March to the Sea in late 1864 reversed the roles, the Union army destroying the main line of the Georgia Railroad and others. Due to the vagaries of the war, some lines would be rebuilt six or seven times by differing sides, especially in states like Virginia, where fighting was most intense.Riegel, p. 133. Expansion Attempts were made to enlarge the Confederacy's rail system by adding or connecting lines. Of the three major rail projects the Confederate congress proposed and funded, only one of them, a connection between Danville, Virginia, and Greensboro, North Carolina, was completed.Ramsdell, p. 801: The other two lines funded, but never completed, were a line between Meridian and Selma, Alabama, which was abandoned after the fall of New Orleans and another, a connection between Rome, Georgia and Blue Mountain, Alabama, which was not finished before the end of the war. Although the Confederate constitution forbade internal improvements to aid commerce, nothing within it said anything about improvements to aid wartime defense.Currie, p. 1311.

He was born in Dominion City, Manitoba, the son of Peter Scraba and Tena Procopchuk. Before his career in provincial politics, Scraba served on the Winnipeg City Council as a member of the conservative Civic Election Committee and on the Winnipeg School Board. He was a businessman in the city and was a member of the Ukrainian Professional Businessmen's Club. Scraba was elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1945 provincial election, in the ten-member constituency of Winnipeg. During this period, Winnipeg elected ten members to the legislative assembly by a single transferable ballot. Scraba finished ninth on the first count, and secured the tenth and final seat on the fifteenth count, narrowly edging out Progressive Conservative Morley Lougheed. He served as a backbench supporter of Premiers Stuart Garson and Douglas Campbell over the next four years. Winnipeg's electoral map was changed for the 1949 provincial election, as the single ten-member constituency was replaced with three separate four- member constituencies. Scraba ran for re-election as an \\"Independent Liberal- Progressive\\" in Winnipeg North, but was defeated. He finished sixth on the first count, and was eliminated on the seventh count.

The town was virtually destroyed during the Thirty Years' War, though the brewing industry established in the late seventeenth century helped in its recovery. In the mid-nineteenth century, the toy industry contributed to the town‚Äôs industrial development, and remains important today. Pinder Barracks In 1935 the city of Zirndorf applied to the German Reich Administration to have a caserne built here. The application was approved, with the condition of Reichsmarschall Hermann G√∂ring, that construction must be in the Franconian style. The plans were prepared by the Construction Office of the German Air Force, and work began on the Barracks in the spring of 1938. It was completed in mid-1940. This Spotlight and Anti-Aircraft Barracks as it was then called, was one of the best military training barracks in the Third Reich. In 1945, soldiers of the U.S. 26th Infantry Regiment occupied the barracks. On 11 May 1949, this barracks was renamed in honor of John J. Pinder Jr., an American soldier who fell in a battle near Colleville-sur-Mer, France, on 6 June 1944. For his bravery, he was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. In the decades since 1945, many American units were stationed at Pinder Barracks. The 1st Armored Division's Divisional Artillery (DIVARTY) called Zirndorf home from 1971 until shortly after the Gulf War in 1991. Shortly thereafter, the Army and Air Force Exchange Service, Europe (AAFES-Europe), headquartered their operations at Pinder Barracks. In the fall of 1993, the 7th Corps Support Group moved its home to Pinder Barracks as well. Within the departure of AAFES-Europe and the 7th Corps Support Group, the chapter of America's presence in Zirndorf came to a close. Although these barracks were abandoned in the years after 1999, the name Pinder remained by decision of the city administration as the newly formed city district \\"Pinder Park\\".Pinder Park at the Nuremberg Military Community website Economy The Brandst√§tter Group, producer of the Playmobil line of toys, is headquartered in Zirndorf,\\"Impressum.\\" Playmobil.

In 1997 Sumitomo gained agreement to use the Dunlop name in its corporate name, and changed the name of its UK subsidiary to \\"Dunlop Tyres Ltd.\\" Dunlop sport tyres In 1999, Sumitomo and Goodyear began a joint venture by which Sumitomo continued to manufacture all Japanese-made tyres under the Dunlop name, while Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company bought 75% of the European and North American tyre businesses of Sumitomo.Goodyear form 10-Q for quarter ended June 30, 1999, p. 28. The company has extensive manufacturing operations throughout the world. With the closure of the Washington plant in 2006, Goodyear Dunlop ceased mainstream car and lorry tyre production in the UK. In 2016, it was announced that Sumitomo would commence the second phase of its 131 million investment for the upgrade and expansion of its Dunlop tire manufacturing plant in Ladysmith, South Africa. Until May 2014, Goodyear Dunlop occupied a compact part of the site with their British main office. In the UK, the company operates as a sales organisation, importing tyres from manufacturing plants around the world, including China, Slovenia and Poland. The Goodyear Dunlop joint venture is managed from sites in Luxembourg and Brussels, which report to Goodyear in Akron, Ohio, United States. Fort Dunlop Fort Dunlop was a motorsport manufacturing operation located in a corner of the original Dunlop factory in Erdington, Birmingham, established in 1891 until May 2014. This factory produced specialised vintage, motorcycle and touring car tyres, and produced about 300,000 specialised racing tyres per year. On 30 May 2014, the Birmingham factory ceased tyre production, ending Dunlop tyre production in the UK.

People are born at the age of one, i.e. the first year of lifetime using an ordinal numeral (instead of \\"zero\\" using a cardinal numeral), and on Chinese New Year or New Year's Day one year is added to their age. Since age is incremented at the beginning of the lunar or solar year, rather than on the anniversary of a birthday, people may be one or two years older in Asian reckoning than in the international age system. Variations in date for change of age Under the traditional reckoning in China, age changes on the first day of Chinese New Year. In Japan and South Korea, New Year's Day is used as the date of change of age for the traditional system. China In either the traditional or modern age system the word ' (), meaning \\"years of age\\", is used for age counting. In Chinese usage, there are three different types of age reckoning systems: * Traditional age, lit. \\"nominal age\\" () based on the East Asian reckoning system * Modern age, lit. \\"a full year of age\\" () * \\"Real age\\" () based on the Gregorian calendar Both the \\"traditional age\\" and the \\"modern age\\" have lost much of their popularity within China, and the \\"real age\\" is nowadays the most commonly used age reckoning system in China. Of the three, only \\"real age\\" (sh√≠su√¨) is legally used when reporting age in an official document such as the passport, ID card or a bank paper. The \\"real age\\" is also the only legally admissible to start drinking alcohol. The \\"real age\\" is the current Chinese legal system of age reckoning. When a child has survived one month of life (29 days if lunar month reckoning) a mun yuet () celebration can be observed, in which duck or chicken eggs dyed red are distributed to guests to signify fertility. Japan The traditional Japanese system of age reckoning, or ' (, lit. \\"counted years\\"), which incremented one's age on New Year's Day, was rendered obsolete by law in 1902 when Japan officially adopted the modern age system,„É¨„Éï„Ç°„É¨„É≥„Çπ‰∫ã‰æãË©≥Á¥∞: Áõ∏-090002, Collaborative Reference Database.

Elsewhere its use is limited to traditional ceremonies, divinations, and obituaries. Japanese uses the word sai ( or ) as a counter word for both the traditional and modern age system. Korea Koreans who use the traditional system refer to their age in units called sal (ÏÇ¥), using Korean numerals in ordinal form. Thus, a person is one sal (\\"han sal\\", ÌïúÏÇ¥) during the first calendar year of life, and ten sal during the tenth calendar year.Song, Jae Jung. (2005), pp. 81‚Äì82, (quote) \\"Koreans prefer native Korean to Sino-Korean numerals when telling their own or other people's age,...Note that the native age classifier sal must be used with native Korean numerals and the Sino-Korean age classifier sey with Sino-Korean numerals,..\\" The 100th-day anniversary of a baby is called ' (, ) which literally means \\"a hundred days\\" in Korean, and is given a special celebration, marking the survival of what was once a period of high infant mortality. The first anniversary of birth named dol (Îèå) is likewise celebrated, and given even greater significance. South Koreans celebrate their birthdays,DuBois (2004), pp. 72‚Äì73 even though every South Korean gains one 'sal' on New Year's Day. Because the first year comes at birth and the second on the first day of the New Year, children born, for example, on December 29 will reach two years of age on the New Year's Day, when they are only days old. Hence, everyone born on the same calendar year effectively has the same age and can easily be calculated by the formula: Age = (Current Year ‚àí Birth Year) + 1 In modern South Korea the traditional system is used alongside the international age system which is referred to as \\"man-nai\\" (ÎßåÎÇòÏù¥) in which \\"man\\" (Îßå) means \\"full\\" or \\"actual\\", and \\"nai\\" (ÎÇòÏù¥) meaning \\"age\\".Hilts and Kim, (2002), p. 228 (quote) \\"Koreans have a peculiar way of calculating age. When you're born, you're already one year old, and then you get another year older when New Year's Day rolls around. The result is that your hangungnai (ÌïúÍµ≠ÎÇòÏù¥), 'Korean age', is usually one to two years older than your man-nai (Îßå ÎÇòÏù¥), 'actual age'. Under-age kids sometimes try to take some advantage of this, but eligibility for drinking, obtaining license etc is determined by your actual age.\\" For example, ' means \\"full ten years\\", or \\"ten years old\\" in English. The Korean word ' means \\"years elapsed\\", identical to the English \\"years old\\", but is only used to refer to the first few birthdays. ' or simply ' refers to the first Western-equivalent birthday, ' refers to the second, and so on. The traditional system has not been used in modern North Korea since the 1980s. South Korea is now the only country that uses the East Asian age, which may consequently be referred to globally as \\"Korean age\\". The Korean Birthday Celebrations by the lunar calendar is called ' (ÏùåÎ†• ÏÉùÏùº, Èô∞ÊõÜÁîüÊó•) and ' (ÏñëÎ†• ÏÉùÏùº, ÈôΩÊõÜÁîüÊó•) is the birthday by Gregorian calendar. In the past, most people used the lunar calendar, ', to tell their birthday more than the Gregorian calendar ' but nowadays Koreans, especially young generations, tend to use ' for telling their birthdates. For official government uses, documents, and legal procedures, the international system is used. Regulations regarding age limits on beginning school, as well as the age of consent, are all based on this system (man-nai). The age limit for tobacco, alcohol use are after January 1 of the year one's age turns to 19. Vietnam As being influenced by Chinese culture, the ancient Vietnamese also used this system and, despite not being the official age on papers and in daily usages at the present, the East Asian age is still limitedly used by adults, especially old people in rural areas. However, this age is not really familiar to the young generation. In Vietnam, it is called \\"tu·ªïi m·ª•\\", \\"tu·ªïi ta\\" (literally \\"Our age\\") or \\"tu·ªïi √¢m\\" (Lunar-calendar age). Eastern Mongolia In Eastern Mongolia, age is traditionally determined based on the number of full moons since conception for girls, and the number of new moons since birth for boys.

Biography Born in Halifax, Yorkshire, England, the oldest child born to William Booth and Catherine Mumford, he had two brothers and five sisters, including Evangeline Booth, Catherine Booth-Clibborn, Emma Booth and Ballington Booth. The Booth family regularly moved from place to place as William Booth's ministry necessitated until the family finally settled in London in 1865. Bramwell Booth was involved in The Salvation Army right from its origins as the obscure Christian Mission, established in Whitechapel in 1865, into an international organisation with numerous and varied social activities. He was educated at home, briefly at a preparatory school and at the City of London School, where he was bullied. Known to his family as 'Willie', as a youth he suffered poor health and had a slight hearing loss. In 1870, aged just 14, Bramwell Booth started to help in the management of his father's Christian Mission and in the cheap food kitchens set up in its early days. He had intended to study medicine and had a fear of public speaking, but despite these obstacles he became William Booth's amanuensis, adviser and administrator. He became an active full-time collaborator with his father in 1874, and an officer when the Christian Mission became The Salvation Army in 1878. The name The Salvation Army developed from an incident in May 1878. William Booth was dictating a letter to his secretary George Scott Railton and said, \\"We are a volunteer army.\\" Bramwell Booth heard his father and said, \\"Volunteer? I'm no volunteer, I'm a regular!\\" Railton was instructed to cross out the word \\"volunteer\\" and substitute the word \\"salvation\\". Chief of the staff Bramwell Booth as Chief of the Staff In 1881, General William Booth appointed Bramwell as his Chief of the Staff of The Salvation Army. Bramwell would hold this title until his father's death, when he himself was named General in his father's will. In 1885 Bramwell was involved with William Thomas Stead in an attempt to publicise the prostitution of young girls. The lurid revelations of how thirteen-year-old Eliza Armstrong was sold for ¬£5 resulted in the 1885 Criminal Law Amendment Act, which raised the age of consent to sixteen years. After the revelations, Booth, Stead, and Rebecca Jarrett, a converted brothel- keeper who assisted them, were arrested on several charges. Booth was acquitted but the others served short prison terms. On 12 October 1882 Bramwell married Captain Florence Eleanor Soper, the eldest daughter of Dr Soper, a medical practitioner of Blaina, Monmouthshire. The congregation at Clapton Congress Hall were charged one shilling each for admission to the ceremony. She had joined The Salvation Army in 1880 and worked in France with Bramwell's sister Catherine Booth. After her marriage she took charge of the women's social work. All of their seven children (five daughters and two sons) became active workers in the army. Their eldest child was Commissioner Catherine Bramwell-Booth. General of The Salvation Army Upon his death in 1912, William Booth appointed Bramwell his successor as General, by way of a sealed envelope. This process was the legal way in which a successor to the General was chosen, as outlined by the Christian Mission's founding deed of 1878. Like his father, Bramwell Booth ruled autocratically, and expected complete obedience. However, what officers had tolerated from William Booth, by then known as 'The Founder', they would not tolerate from Bramwell. The early years of Bramwell Booth's Generalship were complicated by World War I, which threatened the international nature of The Salvation Army, with Salvationists in both Germany and Great Britain. However, he was able to steer a course that offended neither the Germans nor outraged British public opinion, saying in his Christmas message of 1915, \\"Every land is my fatherland, for all lands are my Father's.\\". Like his father before him, Bramwell would not tolerate any perceived insubordination and he summarily retired Salvation Army officers with little reason or sent officers too young to be retired to distant appointments; such officers were said to be in 'the freezer'. Bramwell faced allegations of nepotism, in that he appointed his own children to posts for which others were better qualified. This system could be seen as being inherited from his father, who similarly appointed his own children to high ranking positions. This led to accusations that The Salvation Army was a Booth family-business;Hodges, Samuel Horatio General Booth: ‚Äúthe Family,‚Äù and the Salvation Army: Showing its Rise, Progress, and ... Decline (1890) however, William Booth had once said to his children that \\"The Salvation Army does not belong to you, or to me, it belongs to the world\\" and was very wary of the leadership of the Army becoming a dynasty. Discontent simmered among Salvation Army senior officers, including the chief-of-the- staff Edward Higgins and George Carpenter, who incidentally had been sent to 'the freezer' by his appointment to Sydney in a role he previously held 22 years earlier. These two officers later became Generals of The Salvation Army. Another notable Army leader that disagreed with Bramwell's leadership was Commissioner Charles Jeffries who would later be British Commissioner. In his final years as General he increasingly gave control of The Salvation Army to his wife, Florence Booth, who was given power of attorney when he was away travelling. She had been the Army's 'First Lady' since the death of his mother Catherine Booth in 1890, and had started several Army organisations including the Home League, Girl Guards, and League of Mercy. As the years passed the Army's senior officers, including Bramwell's sister Evangeline Booth and his former brother-in-law Frederick Booth-Tucker, began to question his leadership. In May 1928 Bramwell's health began to deteriorate, and by September he was suffering from insomnia and depression. His poor health offered those in the Army who were dissatisfied with his leadership an opportunity to act, and on 8 January 1929 the first High Council of The Salvation Army convened, and firstly asked the General to resign due to his ill health, which, they said, was hampering him in the performance of his duties and decisions. He refused to resign, believing that his health would soon be fully recovered, so on 13 February 1929 the High Council voted by 52 votes to 5 that Bramwell's term of office as General should now end, based on Bramwell being 'unfit' to hold the position. Booth was succeeded in the election of Edward Higgins, his Chief of the Staff. Bramwell Booth visites The Hague in 1925 and speaks to the gathered crowd at his arrival (no audio) General Bramwell Booth then took the High Council to court, which lost him a lot of respect; he also lost the court case. His sister, Evangeline Booth later succeeded General Higgins to serve as the fourth General of The Salvation Army. Henceforth the General of The Salvation Army would be elected by the High Council. On 29 April 1929 the now former General Bramwell Booth received a letter from Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin stating that King George V had appointed him a member of the Order of the Companions of Honour. Vegetarianism Booth, like his parents John and Catherine and his wife Florence, wasvegetarian. He authored the booklet The Advantages of Vegetarian Diet, published by the London Vegetarian Society. In 1925, it was reprinted by the Order of the Golden Age.Stark, James F. (2020). The Cult of Youth: Anti- Ageing in Modern Britain. Cambridge University Press. p. 83. Booth suggested nineteen reasons for adopting vegetarianism.Iacobbo, Karen; Iacobbo, Michael. (2004). Vegetarian America: A History. Praeger Publishing. p. 133. He commented that a vegetarian diet is \\"favourable to purity, chastity, and a perfect control of the appetites and passions.\\"Walker, Pamela J. (2001). Pulling the Devil's Kingdom Down: The Salvation Army in Victorian Britain. University of California Press. p. 185. Booth's wife also became a vegetarian and they both believed that meat stimulated the consumption of alcohol.Spencer, Colin. (1995). The Heretic's Feast: A History of Vegetarianism.

Death Grave of Bramwell Booth at Abney Park Cemetery On 16 June 1929 his family was summoned to his bedside, and on that Sunday evening General Bramwell Booth died at his home, The Homestead, Hadley Wood, near Barnet, Hertfordshire. For the Friday and Saturday following his death Bramwell Booth's body lay in state at The Salvation Army's Congress Hall. On the Saturday evening 10,000 Salvationists and friends filled the Royal Albert Hall to bid farewell to their beloved former General. General Bramwell Booth was buried opposite his parents at Abney Park Cemetery, Stoke Newington, London. The grave lies near the southern entrance. Huge crowds attended his funeral. He was commemorated by the Bramwell Booth Memorial Hall, Queen Victoria Street, London.

When she was a small girl, her widowed mother sent her to an Episcopalian boarding school, leaving her with a sense of abandonment. Therese is dating Richard, a young man she does not love and does not enjoy having sex with. On a long and monotonous day at work in the toy section of a department store during the Christmas season, Therese becomes interested in a customer, an elegant and beautiful woman in her early thirties. The woman's name is Carol Aird and she gives Therese her address so her purchases may be delivered. On an impulse, Therese sends her a Christmas card. Carol, who is going through a difficult separation and divorce and is herself quite lonely, unexpectedly responds. The two begin to spend time together. Therese develops a strong attachment to Carol. Richard accuses Therese of having a \\"schoolgirl crush\\", but Therese knows it is more than that: She is in love with Carol. Carol's husband, Harge, is suspicious of Carol's relationship with Therese, whom he meets briefly when Therese stays over at Carol's house in New Jersey. Carol had previously admitted to Harge that she had a short-lived sexual relationship months earlier with her best friend, Abby. Harge takes his and Carol's daughter Rindy to live with him, limiting Carol's access to her as divorce proceedings continue. To escape from the tension in New York, Carol and Therese take a road trip West as far as Utah, over the course of which it becomes clear that the feelings they have for each other are romantic and sexual. They become physically as well as emotionally intimate and declare their love for each other. The women become aware that a private investigator is following them, hired by Harge to gather evidence that could be used against Carol by incriminating her as homosexual in the upcoming custody hearings. They realize the investigator has already bugged the hotel room in which Carol and Therese first had sex. On a road in Nebraska, after the detective has followed them for miles and clearly intends to continue doing so, Carol confronts him and demands that he hand over any evidence against her. She pays him a high price for some tapes even though he warns her that he has already sent several tapes and other evidence to Harge in New York. Carol knows that she will lose custody of Rindy if she continues her relationship with Therese. She decides to return to New York to fight for her rights regarding her daughter, and will return to Therese as soon as she can. Therese stays alone in the Midwest; eventually Carol writes to tell her that she has agreed to not continue their relationship. The evidence for Carol's homosexuality is so strong that she capitulates to Harge without having the details of her behavior aired in court. She submits to an agreement that gives him full custody of Rindy and leaves her with limited supervised visits. Though heartbroken, Therese returns to New York to rebuild her life. Therese and Carol arrange to meet again. Therese, still hurt that Carol abandoned her in a hopeless attempt to maintain a relationship with Rindy, declines Carol's invitation to live with her. They part, each headed for a different evening engagement. Therese, after a brief flirtation with an English actress that leaves her ashamed, quickly reviews her relationships ‚Äî\\"loneliness swept over her like a rushing wind\\"‚Äî and goes to find Carol, who greets her more eagerly than ever before. Background According to Highsmith, the novel was inspired by a blonde woman in a mink coat who ordered a doll from her while Highsmith was working as a temporary sales clerk in the toy section of Bloomingdale's in New York City during Christmas season of 1948: Highsmith recalled completing the book's outline in two hours that night, likely under the influence of chickenpox which she discovered she had only the next day: \\"fever is stimulating to the imagination.\\" She completed the novel by 1951. The semi-autobiographical story was mined from her own life references and desire for a lost love. Highsmith described the character of Therese as having come \\"from my own bones\\". Playwright Phyllis Nagy, who met Highsmith in 1987 and developed a friendship with her that lasted for the remainder of Highsmith's life, said that Therese was Highsmith's \\"alter ego\\" and \\"the voice of an author.\\" The character of Carol Aird and much of the plot of the novel was inspired by Highsmith's former lovers Kathryn Hamill Cohen and Philadelphia socialite Virginia Kent Catherwood, ((via Newspapers.com) and her relationships with them. Virginia Catherwood lost custody of her daughter in divorce proceedings that involved tape-recorded lesbian trysts in hotel rooms. The story shared the same \\"sexual behavior\\" and \\"intense emotion\\" obsessions that Highsmith's writing became known for. Highsmith placed Therese in the world of the New York theater with friends who are \\"vaguely bohemian, artists or would-be artists\\" and signaled their intellectual aspirations by noting they read James Joyce and Gertrude Stein, the latter unmistakably lesbian. All are struggling to find a place for themselves in the world. The first working title of the novel (written in her \\"cahier\\" No. 18) was \\"The Bloomingdale Story\\". Other names Highsmith later considered were \\"The Argument of Tantalus\\", \\"Blasphemy of Laughter\\", and \\"Paths of Lightening\\" before finally naming it The Price of Salt. Highsmith said that she settled on the title from a thought about the price paid by Lot's wife when she looked back towards Sodom. It's more likely, however, that she was invoking a biblical reference from the Gospel text (Matthew 5:13) that Andr√© Gide included in his novel The Counterfeiters, a work about the transgressive love of adolescence that Highsmith once took to heart: If the salt have lost his flavor wherewith shall it be salted?'‚Äîthat is the tragedy with which I am concerned.\\" Publication history Highsmith's publisher, Harper & Bros, rejected the manuscript. Her agent warned her that she was committing career suicide by following Strangers on a Train with a blatantly lesbian novel. It was accepted by Coward-McCann and published in hardcover in 1952 with the \\"Claire Morgan\\" alias. (The New York Times archives are available only to subscribers.) She dedicated the book to \\"Edna, Jordy and Jeff\\"‚Äîthree people whom Highsmith invented. The 25-cent lesbian pulp edition by Bantam Books appeared in 1953, followed by a mass market edition in 1969 by Macfadden Books. The Price of Salt subsequently fell out of print. In 1983, lesbian publishing house Naiad Press offered Highsmith $5,000 to reprint the novel under her own name, or $2,000 under the pseudonym. Highsmith accepted the latter and it was reissued in 1984. In 1990, the book was republished by Bloomsbury as Carol under Patricia Highsmith's name, with the addition of an afterword by her. Phyllis Nagy said Highsmith chose \\"Carol\\" because Highsmith, herself, \\"was Therese and the object of her desire wasn't herself...it was someone else.\\" The novel was so personal to Highsmith that \\"it was difficult for her to take ownership of it as a writer for many years.\\" The marketing of the novel in successive editions reflected different strategies for making the story of a lesbian romance attractive or acceptable to the reading public. The Coward-McCann dust jacket called it \\"A Modern Novel of Two Women\\". The paperboard cover of the 1953 Bantam edition balanced the words \\"The Novel of a Love Society Forbids\\" with a reassuring quote from The New York Times that said the novel \\"[handles] explosive material ... with sincerity and good taste.\\" The 2004 reissue by Norton appealed to highbrow tastes with the tagline \\"The novel that inspired Nabokov's Lolita \\" on the cover‚Äîa claim that stemmed from a theory by Terry Castle published in a 2003 essay for The New Republic. (The tagline was not included in subsequent editions.) As a movie tie-in with the release of the 2015 motion picture adaptation of the novel, Norton published a new paperback edition as Carol with the subtitle \\"Previously Titled The Price of Salt\\", and the cover featuring the image of the North American theatrical film poster. The cover of the Bloomsbury tie-in edition featured the title Carol superimposed on a scene from the film with images of Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara from another scene, but did not include a reference to the original title. Reception After Dark (June 1988) The paperback version of The Price of Salt sold nearly one million copies before its new edition as Carol in 1990. The novel was received well and Highsmith received letters addressed to \\"Claire Morgan\\" through her publisher thanking her for writing a story that lesbian women could identify with. Because of the new title and her acknowledged authorship, the novel received another round of reviews, thoroughly favorable, 38 years after its initial publication. Highsmith submitted to publicity interviews as well, though she resented questions about her sexuality and personal relationships. When BBC 2's The Late Show presenter Sarah Dunant asked Highsmith in 1990 if Carol constituted a \\"literary coming out\\", she replied looking irked: \\"I'll pass that one to Mrs. Grundy\\", referencing the character who embodies conventional propriety. Social significance Because of the happy (or at least, non-tragic) ending which defied the lesbian pulp formula, and because of the unconventional characters who defied stereotypes about female homosexuals, The Price of Salt was popular among lesbians in the 1950s and continued to be with later generations. It was regarded for many years as the only lesbian novel with a happy ending. Highsmith told author Marijane Meaker that she was surprised when the book was praised by lesbian readers because of how it ended. She was pleased that it had become popular for that reason and said, \\"I never thought about it when I wrote it. I just told the story.\\" When Highsmith allowed her name to be attached to the 1990 republication by Bloomsbury, she wrote in the \\"Afterword\\" to the edition: The novel's representation of its lesbian characters also departed from the period's stereotypical depiction of lesbians‚Äîboth in popular literature and by the medical/psychological field (where females who did not conform to their sexual gender role were considered \\"congenital inverts\\")‚Äîthat expected one member of a lesbian couple would be \\"noticeably masculine in her affect, style, and behavior\\". Highsmith depicts Therese as puzzled when her experience does not match that \\"butch-femme paradigm\\": > She had heard about girls falling in love, and she knew what kind of people > they were and what they looked like. Neither she nor Carol looked like that. > Yet the way she felt about Carol passed all the tests for love and fitted > all the descriptions.  Adaptations  An unsuccessful attempt was made in the early 1950s to turn the novel into a movie. In the screen treatment the title was changed to Winter Journey and the character of \\"Carol\\" was changed to \\"Carl\\". A radio adaptation titled Carol was broadcast by BBC Radio 4 in December 2014 with Miranda Richardson as Carol Aird and Andrea Deck as Therese Belivet. It comprised five segments of approximately 15 minutes. A 2015 British-American film adaptation of the novel, Carol, was directed by Todd Haynes from a screenplay by Phyllis Nagy. The film stars Cate Blanchett as Carol and Rooney Mara as Therese. Carol was an Official Selection of the 2015 Cannes Film Festival and won the Queer Palm award. The film received six Academy Award nominations including Best Actress in a Leading Role for Blanchett, Best Supporting Actress for Mara, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Original Score, Best Cinematography, and Best Costume Design; and nine British Academy Film Award nominations for Best Film, Best Direction, Best Actress in a Leading Role (Blanchett), Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Mara), Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Production Design, Best Costume Design, and Best Makeup and Hair.

He led his regiment to Norfolk Island in March 1826 as the second commandant of the second convict settlement. His first act was to arrange for the thirty women on the island to be returned to Sydney as Governor Darling disapproved of their presence at this \\"place of the extremest punishment short of death\\". In September 1826 an attempt was made by the convicts to escape from the island by boat, having been told that there was an island within a hundred miles where they could safely hide and never be found. While most of the soldiers were chasing two absconders, about thirty prisoners seized and bound their overseers, robbed the Stores for provisions and weapons, and put three boats to sea, killing a soldier. Donaldson and soldiers followed them to the nearby small and uninhabited Phillip Island, where they were captured. The ringleaders were sent to Sydney for trial, where they were sentenced to death. Donaldson left Norfolk Island on 3 February 1828. References * Hazzard, Margaret, Punishment Short of Death: a history of the penal settlement at Norfolk Island, Melbourne, Hyland, 1984.

George Harrison, who assisted Starr with the song, commented: \\"Octopus's Garden' is Ringo's song. It's only the second song Ringo has ever written, mind you, and it's lovely.\\" He added that the song gets very deep into the listener's consciousness \\"because it's so peaceful. I suppose Ringo is writing cosmic songs these days without even realising it.\\" It was the last song released by the Beatles featuring Starr on lead vocals. Composition The idea for the song came about when Starr was on a boat belonging to comedian Peter Sellers in Sardinia in 1968. He ordered fish and chips for lunch, but instead of fish he got squid (it was the first time he'd eaten squid, and he said, \\"It was OK. A bit rubbery. Tasted like chicken.\\")Anthology book (2000, p. 312) The boat's captain then told Starr about how octopuses travel along the sea bed picking up stones and shiny objects with which to build gardens. Starr's songwriting was further inspired by his desire to escape mounting hostility among the Beatles; he would later admit that he had \\"just wanted to be under the sea, too\\". Uncredited assistance in developing the song's chord changes was provided by Harrison, who can be seen helping Starr work the song out on piano, with Lennon later joining in with drums, in the Let It Be documentary. The song, which contains the lyrics \\"Oh what joy for every girl and boy/Knowing they're happy and they're safe,\\" is sometimes thought of as being a song for children,George Harrison, like \\"Yellow Submarine\\" or \\"All Together Now\\". It has also been performed by the Muppets several times in various episodes of their shows. Recording The basic instrumental track was recorded 26 April 1969, with the Beatles lineup of two electric guitars (Harrison and Lennon),The Complete Beatles Chronicle p. 320 bass guitar (McCartney) and drums (Starr). Starr also provided a temporary guide vocal on this date. (Take 2 of the recording, featuring this guide vocal, Starr singing the first verse three times, is track 14 on disc 2 of Anthology 3.) In the absence of George Martin, the Beatles themselves were listed as producer, with Martin's apprentice Chris Thomas present in the control room to assist. Thirty-two takes were required before the Beatles were satisfied with the track. The backing vocals by McCartney and Harrison during the guitar solo were put through compressors and limiters to create a gurgling sound. At Starr's request, HarrisonExperiencing the Beatles: A Listener's Companion p. 104 added the sound of bubbles by blowing through a straw into a glass of milk. Personnel * Ringo Starr - lead vocal, drums, percussion, sound effects * George Harrison - backing vocal, lead guitar * Paul McCartney - backing vocal, bass, piano * John Lennon - backing vocal, rhythm guitar Re-release The song was remixed in 2006 for the Beatles album Love, which contained remixes of classic Beatles songs. The remix begins with Starr's vocals over the orchestration from \\"Good Night\\", then transitions into the original instrumental backing track on the line \\"I'd ask my friends...\\", with sound effects from \\"Yellow Submarine\\" added in the background. During the guitar solo, the drum track is replaced with that of \\"Lovely Rita\\". The track, in its original form, is also available on the compilation album 1967‚Äì1970. Book In 2014, Starr wrote a children's book based on and named after the song. The book, which consists of the song's lyrics, is illustrated by Ben Cort. A CD is included with the book, including an introduction by Starr, a new version of the song, the lyrics spoken as prose, and an instrumental version of the song. Other versions Jim Henson's Muppets made three video cover versions of the song, on Sesame Street, episode 19 in 1969, The Ed Sullivan Show in March 1970, and The Muppet Show episode 312 in 1978, which was performed by Robin the Frog, Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy. Reparata and the Delrons released the song as a single in 1972 on Dart records, backed with \\"Your Life Is Gone\\". It used vocal effects and ocean-themed sound effects to mimic the style of their 1968 UK hit, \\"Captain of Your Ship\\". It was re-released in 1976, with the A- and B-sides reversed, and credited to Reparata (no Delrons). Noel Gallagher of Oasis adds adapted lyrics from \\"Octopus's Garden\\" to the end of their song \\"Whatever\\" during some of his live performances. The phrase \\"I'd like to be under the sea\\" is in the refrain of one of Oasis' most popular b-sides, \\"Take Me Away\\". Also, the refrain from the chorus of \\"Octopus's Garden\\" can be heard about forty seconds from the end of The Masterplan, also by Oasis. The song was covered and recorded by Canadian children's musician Raffi for the 1985 album One Light, One Sun. The Punkles did a punk cover on their fourth album For Sale sung by their drummer Markey Starkey. Leah Erbe performed the cover of \\"Octopus's Garden\\" on the Motion Picture Soundtrack for IMAX: Under The Sea.https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003DFJVFE The soundtrack was released by New Line Records on 1 April 2010. In popular culture In the 2009 romantic comedy film (500) Days of Summer, Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel) remarks that \\"Octopus's Garden\\" is the greatest Beatles song ever. Tom Hanson (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) tells Summer that no one loves Ringo Starr, to which Summer replies \\"That's what I love about him\\". In the 2007 comedy film Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story, Ringo Starr (Jason Schwartzman) refers to his \\"song about an octopus\\", which is followed by a crude remark from John Lennon (Paul Rudd).

It is about north-west of Adelaide and abuts the Western Australia border History The conservation park was proclaimed in 1970 as a national park under the then National Parks Act 1966 for the purpose of conserving \\"the environments of the Great Victoria Desert and protect wilderness values\\". It was not assigned a name in 1970 and was subsequently constituted as the Unnamed Conservation Park under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972. It was renamed as Mamungari Conservation Park on 30 November 2006. In May 2004, following the passage of special legislation, SA Premier Mike Rann fulfilled a pledge he had made to Maralinga leader Archie Barton as Aboriginal Affairs Minister in 1991, by handing back title to of land to the Maralinga Tjarutja and Pila Nguru people, including the conservation park and the Serpentine Lakes. This was the largest land return under native title in South Australia since Premier John Bannon's hand over of Maralinga lands in 1984. Conservation status It is one of fourteen United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Biosphere Reserves in Australia and obtained this status in 1977 with the name of the Unnamed Biosphere Reserve. The conservation park is classified as an IUCN Category Ia protected area. In 1980, it was listed on the now-defunct Register of the National Estate. Management and access The conservation park is managed jointly by the traditional owners, the Maralinga Tjarutja and Pila Nguru people,Cop and the Department for Environment and Water (DEW). The conservation park may only be visited by those who have obtained the minimum impact code and can demonstrate experience using that code. Permits are required to travel to the conservation park and will take 4 to 6 weeks to arrange. The only road of significance that passes through the conservation park is the Anne Beadell Highway.

Telecentres exist in almost every country, although they sometimes go by a different names including public internet access center (PIAP), village knowledge center, infocenter, Telecottage, Electronic Village Hall, community technology center (CTC), community multimedia center (CMC), multipurpose community telecentre (MCT), Common/Citizen Service Centre (CSC) and school-based telecentre. While each telecentre is different, their common focus is on the use of digital technologies to support community, economic, educational, and social development‚Äîreducing isolation, bridging the digital divide, promoting health issues, creating economic opportunities, and reaching out to youth for example.ENRAP.

TechNology Based Community Centers - Establishment Of Regional PoP's (Point Of Presence) For Socio-EcoNomic Changes Through Distance Learning . Evolution of the telecentre movement African children in a telecentre in Zambia The telecentre movement's origins can be traced to Europe's telecottage and Electronic Village Halls (originally in Denmark) and Community Technology Centers (CTCs) in the United States, both of which emerged in the 1980s as a result of advances in computing. At a time when computers were available but not yet a common household good, public access to computers emerged as a solution.UN. (2000, November). Report on the United Nations / Malaysia Workshop on Bridging the Digital Divide: Space Technology Solutions.‚Äù Conference 20 -24 PLANWEL citation retrieved November 2000. Page 09 item 41 Today, although home ownership of computers is widespread in the United States and other industrialized countries, there remains a need for free public access to computing, whether it is in CTCs, telecottages or public libraries to ensure that everyone has access to technologies that have become essential. There are also CTCs located in the state of New South Wales, Australia, that provide technology, resources, training and educational programs to communities in regional, rural and remote areas. Types Beyond the differences in names, public ICT access centers are diverse, varying in the clientele they serve, the services they provide, as well as their business or organizational model. Around the world, some telecentres include NGO- sponsored, local government, commercial, school-based, and university- relatedProenza, Bastidas-Buch & Mondero,\\"Telecentres for Socio-Economic and Rural Development in Latin America and the Caribbean,\\" 2001. In the United States and other countries, public access to the Internet in libraries may also be considered within the ‚Äútelecentre concept‚Äù, especially when the range of services offered is not limited to pure access but also includes training end-users. Each type has advantages and disadvantages when considering attempts to link communities with ICTs and to bridge the digital divide. Among the various types: * NGO-sponsored telecentres are hosted by an NGO, which manages the center and integrates it, to one degree or another, into the organization's core business * Local government telecentres seek to further local development; they often aim to disseminate information, decentralize services, and encourage civic participation, in addition to providing public ICT access. * Commercial telecentres, launched by entrepreneurs for profit, range from the purely commercial cybercaf√© to the social enterprise, where profit and social good objectives are combined. * School-based telecentres can be structured to involve community members during off-school hours, but costs need to be shared by the school system and the community. * University-related telecentres can offer social outreach to disadvantaged and community groups, provide training, develop locally relevant content, and establish and facilitate virtual networks. * Internet access in public libraries.Bertot, J.

Need for telecentres It is estimated that 40% of the world's population has less than US$20 per year available to spend on ICT. In Brazil, the poorest 20% of the population counts with merely US$9 per year to spend on ICT (US$0.75 per month).Martin Hilbert \\"When is Cheap, Cheap Enough to Bridge the Digital Divide? Modeling Income Related Structural Challenges of Technology Diffusion in Latin America\\". World Development, Volume 38, issue 5, p. 756-770. free access to the study here: martinhilbert.net/CheapEnoughWD_Hilbert_pre-print.pdf In Mexico, the poorest 20% of the society counts with an estimated US$35 per year (US$3 per month). For Latin America it is estimated that the borderline between ICT as a necessity good and ICT as a luxury good is roughly around the \\"magical number\\" of US$10 per person per month, or US$120 per year. Telecentres and international development institutions In the 1990s, international development institutions such as Canada's International Development Research Centre (IDRC) and UNESCO, sponsored the deployment of many telecentres in developing countries. Both IDRC and UNESCO are still very involved in the telecentre movement. The former telecentre.org programme at IDRC was transferred to the telecentre.org Foundation in the Philippines in March 2010Philippines is new home base of telecentre.org http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/March2010/02/c6161.html and continues to support networks of telecentres around the world. Within the Philippines, the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) has rolled-out Tech4ED (Technology for Education, to gain Employment, train Entrepreneurs towards Economic Development). This telecenter program has implemented over 42,000 centers throughout the countryside. UNESCO continues to support the growth of community multimedia centers (CMCs), which, unlike most other telecentres, have a local community radio, television or other media component. Sustainability considerations In light of the rapidly evolving technologies that support telecentres and in light of the increased penetration of mobile technologies (i.e., cell phones), the telecentre model needs to continuously evolve in order to remain relevant and to continue to address the changing needs of the communities they serve. As mobile communication technologies become more pervasive around the world, including in rural areas, the telecentres may no longer need to provide phone services, yet they may still be very relevant in terms of access to web-enabled e-government services, e-Learning, and basic Internet communication needs (email and web browsing).Fillip, B. and Foote, D. (March, 2007). Making the Connection: Scaling Telecenters for Development (PDF). Academy for Educational Development, Microsoft Corporation, International DevelopmentResearch Centre, Retrieved on October 21, 11. Among the various sustainability considerations: Evolving models ‚Äî since the local demand for information and communication services is evolving, the telecentre models need to evolve as well. Franchises and other approaches to linking and networking telecentres are proving to be popular. Evolving technologies ‚Äî wireless connectivity technologies, beyond VSAT (known to be expensive) are being explored in many communities around the world. These technologies provide new opportunities for connecting communities through telecentres and eventually at the individual household level. Evolving services ‚Äî the types of services that telecentres can and should provide is also rapidly evolving. As the fields of eGovernment, eHealth, e-Learning, eCommerce are evolving and maturing in many countries, telecentres need to take advantage of opportunities to extend the benefits to the community at large, through their public access. Some governments are pursuing the deployment of telecentres precisely as a means of ensuring that larger segments of the population are able to access government services and information through electronic channels. Community stakeholders - identifying leaders among the community who champion the concept of shared services through telecentre mode, play a crucial role as a bridge between the telecentre operator and hesitant villagers. Indeed, There is a maturing period during which community leaders have to invest constant efforts to drive changes of behaviour in the adoption of innovations. Roman. P and Colle. R (January, 2002). Development Informatics (PDF). Institute for Development Policy Management, University of Manchester. Retrieved on October 24, 2011. Community involvement is required however, at the initial phase of the telecentre set up, starting with the site selection and creating a sort of empathy and feeling of empowerment. Furthermore, the telecentre should be well rooted in the socio-cultural context of the community. Networks The telecentres of today and of the future are networked telecentres, or telecentres of the 2.0 generation.Harris, 2007. Increasingly, telecentres are not operating as independent, isolated entities but as members of a network. At times, the network takes the form of a franchise. In other circumstances, the network is much more informal. One such regional network targeted towards Asia-Pacific is, the Asia-Pacific Telecentre Network. In the United States, more than 1,000 community technology centers where organized under the leadership of CTCnet, a nonprofit association headquartered in Washington, D.C..http://ctcnet.org CTCnet CTCs are also organized under the banner of state organizations, such as the Ohio Community Computing Network,Ohio Community Computing Network or city programs such the City of Seattle Community Technology Program.City of Seattle Community Technology Program and Austin FreeNet.Austin FreeNet Further information For more information on telecentre networks, visit telecentre.org. An overview of telecentre networks can also be found in Chapter 7 of Making the Connection: Scaling Telecentres for Development.

This strait has a minimum width of . Labrador and Newfoundland are currently connected by ferry service between Blanc-Sablon, Quebec (close to the Labrador border) and St. Barbe. However, the most important ferry connection between Newfoundland and mainland Canada is the Marine Atlantic service between Port-aux-Basques and North Sydney, Nova Scotia, a distance of approximately . The idea is not new; it was one of Joey Smallwood's ideas in 1949 per The Western Star, November 2013. It was again put forward by mining engineer Tom Kierans during the early 1970s as a means to bring hydroelectricity from Churchill Falls to Newfoundland. About C$75 million was spent by the provincial government on constructing such a utility tunnel but the project was cancelled in 1975. Newfoundland is the largest land mass outside the Arctic Islands not directly connected by fixed link to the Canadian mainland. The Confederation Bridge, which connects Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick, is about long, is significantly shorter than the Newfoundland‚ÄìLabrador link would be, and crosses the Abegweit Passage, a shallower and calmer body of water than the Strait of Belle Isle. In the lead- up to the October 2003 provincial election, Progressive Conservative leader Danny Williams promised to fund a feasibility study to placate link supporters. In 2016, Premier Dwight Ball launched a new pre-feasibility study to determine the costs of a tunnel link between the island and Labrador. In their 2019 election platform, the Liberal Party of Canada indicated support for a National Infrastructure Fund, including the Newfoundland-Labrador fixed transportation link, likely linking Yankee Point, Newfoundland with Point Amour on the (Labrador) mainland. 2004 feasibility study Looking across the Strait of Belle Isle in moonlight from Green Island Brook March 24, 2005. From left to right Point Amour light, L'Anse-au-Loup and Capstan Island. The feasibility study into a Newfoundland‚ÄìLabrador fixed link, resulting from the 2003 election promise by newly elected premier Danny Williams, was released in 2004. It examined causeway, bridge and tunnel options and recommended that a tunnel beneath the Strait of Belle Isle, accommodating a single railway track, would be the only feasible option, given the area's harsh winter weather conditions, the strait's bathymetry (the depth and shape of the sea floor), and the geology of underlying soils. Electric-powered trains would be loaded on either side and carry cars, buses and transport trucks. The authors of the study estimated that construction, either by tunnel boring or lowering pre- constructed tunnel sections to a trench in the sea floor, is beyond the current technological limit due to the depth of the sea floor and scouring of the strait by icebergs. The authors also stated that the cost of construction and low traffic levels would not justify the cost. Conceivably, if built with federal aid, the 1949 terms of union might be amended to remove federal subsidies from the federally operated Marine Atlantic ferry service that connects Port-aux-Basques with North Sydney, Nova Scotia, and place them instead on the proposed fixed link. In terms of driving distance, a fixed link would not be favourable for residents of the Maritimes or parts of the Eastern Seaboard of the United States as they would have to drive to Quebec City where bridges cross the St. Lawrence River (there are ferries further downstream), before continuing east along Quebec's C√¥te-Nord (of the Gulf of St. Lawrence). Highway connections The south coast of Labrador was isolated from the rest of the North American road network until completion of the Trans-Labrador Highway in 2009, and upgrades to its counterpart Route 389. The eventual completion of Route 138 will provide a more direct link between Labrador and the North American road network. Revisit in 2016 In 2016, Premier Dwight Ball launched a new pre-feasibility study to determine the costs of a tunnel link between the island and Labrador. The study released its results in April 2018, and concluded that a undersea rail tunnel connecting L'Anse Amour in southern Labrador and Yankee Point near Flower's Cove on the Northern Peninsula of Newfoundland could be constructed at a cost of C$1.65 billion. Such a tunnel would take about 15 years to construct, with public-private partnerships strongly recommended for the financing of such a project. In a news conference covering the pre-feasibility study, Ball stated that a fixed link tunnel between Newfoundland and Labrador had the potential to be a \\"nation-building project\\" that could \\"truly change the landscape and unify our country\\". A formal feasibility study, costing up to C$22 million to conduct, is the next step in the process of formulating a plan to construct the fixed link, though there is no timeline on when to commence this study as of yet. Criticism of the project Business and community leaders in Newfoundland and Labrador and the rest of Canada have also spoken out against the project, noting that the economic argument for such a link is not proven. The Economist derided the proposal in a story titled Now let's dig an expensive hole.

After committing several rapes, Garrow went on an 18-day killing spree and stabbed four people to death before being apprehended. His criminal trial, known as the Buried Bodies Case, became an important case in legal ethics after his attorneys refused to disclose the location of the bodies of two of his victims, citing attorney-client privilege. Garrow was later shot dead while escaping from prison in 1978. Early life Robert Garrow Jr. was born in Dannemora, New York, to French-Canadian parents Robert Omer Garrow and his wife, Margaret, who were poor farmers. Garrow later claimed his parents were severe, violent disciplinarians who regularly physically abused their children with whatever was handy, even bricks. His accounts have been repeated by his siblings. The police were called several times throughout the years to break up violent fights between Garrow and his alcoholic father. After a particularly brutal episode when Garrow was 15, he was sent to a farm to work. He later reported a long history of sexual dysfunction and paraphilias, committed several acts of bestiality with the farm animals he worked with throughout childhood and adolescence, and would often masturbate with milking machines. Garrow joined the U.S. Air Force upon his release, but was court- martialed a year later for stealing money from a superior officer and spent six months in a military prison in Florida. Criminal history Garrow returned to New York in 1957, where he married and fathered a son. His life did not improve, however; he was fired from a series of menial jobs, including from a fast food restaurant he burglarized, and was involved in an abusive relationship with a man he later described as a sadist. Garrow was arrested for rape in 1961 and spent seven years in prison. Soon after he was released, he committed a series of rapes, and many of his victims were children. He was arrested for the rape of two prepubescent girls, but jumped bail and became a fugitive. In July 1973, Garrow murdered four people, including a young woman whom he kidnapped and repeatedly raped before killing, and a high school-aged camper in the Adirondacks a few days later. Three witnesses escaped and sought police, spurring a twelve-day statewide manhunt that was, at the time, the largest in New York State history. Road blocks were set up at intersections throughout Adirondack Park requiring motorists to open vehicle trunks for law enforcement to thoroughly search. Motorists were warned not to stop for anyone on foot near the roads for fear that Garrow might have tried to pose as a hitchhiker. He was cornered in the woods sixty miles north of the murder scene, and was shot in the foot, arm, and back by Environmental Conservation Officer Hilary J. LeBlanc jr. He survived, alleging that he was partially paralyzed. Garrow was treated at CVPH Medical Center in Plattsburgh, New York, where doctors disbelieved his claims of paralysis. He sued the State of New York for $10 million, alleging that the state's doctors had been negligent in treating the gunshot wound, leading to his alleged paralysis. He was moved to a medium security prison in exchange for dropping the lawsuit, and was later found to be feigning his paralysis.Ethical Problems in the Practice of Law by Lerman and Schrag, pages 164 -175. Garrow pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, but the jury rejected his plea and found him guilty of second-degree murder, sentencing him to a term of 25 years to life in prison. Garrow began his sentence at Clinton Correctional Facility (maximum security) in Dannemora on July 2, 1974. Due to his alleged paralysis, however, he repeatedly requested transfer to the Elderly and Handicapped Unit (minimum security) within the medium-security Fishkill Correctional Facility. In September, 1977, a death threat against Garrow prompted his transfer to Auburn Correctional Facility (maximum security). It was not until early 1978 that he was transferred back to Fishkill. A grand jury indicted one of Garrow's lawyers ‚Äì Francis Belge, with whom he had shared the location of two victims' bodiesIbelle, Bill. \\"Balancing Life and Practice: Book Explores The Potential Perils Of Lawyer Marriages.\\" Lawyers Weekly USA March 2004. ‚Äì for violating ¬ß¬ß 4200(1) and 4143 of the New York Public Health Law: the first such section required that a decent burial be accorded the dead, while the second required \\"anyone knowing of the death of a person without medical attendance, to report the same to proper authorities.People v. Belge, 372 N.Y.S.2d 798, 799 (N.Y. Co. Ct. 1975). The trial court granted the attorneys' motion to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that the communications between Garrow and Belge as to the whereabouts of the bodies were protected by the attorney-client privilege, and \\"in the interests of justice.\\" As to the privilege, the court held that Belge's professional duties prohibited him from revealing information that would incriminate his client, reasoning that the Fifth Amendment rights of criminal defendants against self-incrimination would be circumvented if \\"compulsory disclosure can be exacted through his attorney.\\"Belge, 372 N.Y.S.2d at 802. However, the court noted that if Belge had been charged with obstruction of justice \\"under a proper statute,\\" rather than a rarely applied \\"pseudo-criminal statute,\\" the requisite balancing of the accused's Fifth Amendment rights against the rights of society to punish culpable behavior would have rendered the court's decision much more difficult.See,'Id at 803. Escape and death Landing himself in a less secure facility due to his false claims of paralysis, Garrow escaped from Fishkill on September 8, 1978. He was in possession of a .32 caliber pistol he had obtained from his son, who concealed the weapon inside a bucket of chicken he brought to his father during a visit. Garrow then spurred another search after he was discovered missing from his cell. The false claims about his paralysis kept the guards unsuspecting, as he scaled a fifteen-foot fence to escape the prison grounds. He waited in a nearby wooded area, remaining concealed in the brush and leaves until the search widened and he could continue running. However, Garrow was spotted by guards a few days later, a few hundred yards away from the prison walls. Garrow shot at his pursuers, wounding Correction Officer Dominic Arena in the leg, but was shot three times and killed by Correction Officer Frank Lago.

The original concept was developed by Sierra VP of Creative Development, Bill Davis. The authors of the series game design are Jane Jensen and Gano Haine, but Jensen was not involved in creating the second game, having moved on to the Gabriel Knight series. The game was going to be ported to Amiga and Macintosh, but those releases never came out. The last of Sierra's various \\"Quest\\" series, EcoQuest is designed to teach about the importance of environmental ethics. The games are considerably easier than most Sierra adventures and cannot be lost or rendered unwinnable. Both use a fully mouse-driven version of SCI1, in the manner of Space Quest IV and King's Quest VI. The protagonist is a 10-year-old boy named Adam Greene, the son of an ecologist and an expert scuba diver. Series =EcoQuest: The Search for Cetus= The first installment, titled The Search for Cetus, was released first on floppy disk, then on CD-ROM with full speech in 1992. Adam's attempts to help a dolphin named Delphineus that his father has rescued, takes a turn for the weirder when the dolphin starts talking. In no time flat, he's trying to seek out Cetus, the sperm whale king of Eluria, an underwater kingdom populated by marine animals. He has assistance in the form of several creatures found in the various ecosystems of the world. Aside from the considerable liberty of sentient talking and semi-anthropomorphic animals, the game is more realistic than cartoony ‚Äì it needs to be, to tell about the real world's environment and pollution. The game presents the player with practical, narrative problems to solve (typical of Sierra adventure games of the period) combined with occasional puzzle elements similar to those found in the Castle of Dr Brain. The Search for Cetus introduced the recycling symbol to Sierra's standard palette of command icons, giving the player bonus points for removing litter from the marine environment. The game introduces children ages 12 and up to marine biology and marine conservation by confronting them with the consequences of various human activities including: dumping of litter, releasing of helium-filled balloons, abandonment of fishing gear, collisions between vessels and marine mammals, spilling of oil and chemicals into the sea and the fertilization of algal blooms. =Lost Secret of the Rainforest= In Lost Secret of the Rainforest (aka EcoQuest II, though this does not appear in the game's title), the second installment in the series, Adam, now slightly older and able to speak with animals as a matter of course, explores the tropical rainforest in search of a cure of a disease afflicting the local Indigenous peoples of South America, and a way to save the rainforest from destruction. One of the game's innovations was the \\"Ecorder\\" display: a tricorder-like device Adam uses to learn about things he finds during his journey. According to Pelit, the game is somewhat harder than its predecessor and places more emphasis on the dangers of selfishness and greed, as opposed to the blight of man.

The league was founded by Bill Coffey. The Bob Payne Trophy was awarded to the team who won the league playoff championship. According to a 1985 Montreal Gazette article, rookies were paid \\"$150 a week plus $35 for a victory\\" and veterans were paid \\"as much as $300 a week.\\" League regulations also said that half the roster (eight out of fifteen players) must be rookie Americans. Formation The ACHL's roots can be traced back to the former Eastern Hockey League (EHL) of the late 1970s and early 1980s. With a meeting of several EHL owners, the league decided to fold on July 19, 1981 and reorganize as the Atlantic Coast Hockey League. Teams and cities that were previous members of the Eastern Hockey League were interested in rejoining the league. Because the Mohawk Valley team being the most northern, the league was interested in inviting a sixth team to bridge the gap. Johnstown previously had an EHL team affiliated with the Red Wings and were the intended sixth team but due to the owner being ill, they were removed from the list. Richmond expressed interest, but due to questions about the financial stability of the league, they also dropped out. The Boston Bruins, along with several investors, were approached about putting a team in nearby Cape Cod. After an investor dropped out, Cape Cod Coliseum and WWF owner Vince McMahon purchased the rights to the franchise for $15,000. Inaugural season The ACHL opened with seven teams: *Salem Raiders *Winston-Salem Thunderbirds *Mohawk Valley Stars *Baltimore Skipjacks *Cape Cod Buccaneers *Fitchburg Trappers *Schenectady Chiefs. From the opening night of the season, McMahon was not happy with how the league was run. Schenectady and Fitchburg were owned by the same person. Fitchburg was placed under a league suspension and would fold after 6 games. Schenectady would fold after 9 games. In January 1982, McMahon tried to borrow $15,000 from the league, citing \\"slow cash flow\\". When the league denied his loan, McMahon folded his franchise. With the league now down to 4 teams, the league decided to end the season early and set the playoffs by geographical area to save on expenses. Coincidentally, the matchups did end up having the first and fourth place teams meet, along with the second vs third place teams. The Salem Raiders defeated the Winston-Salem Thunderbirds, and the Mohawk Valley Stars defeated the Baltimore Skipjacks. The Raiders and Stars played in the league final, with the Mohawk Valley Stars defeating the Raiders for the Bob Payne Trophy. On July 24, 1987, Commissioner Ray Miron announced that the league would be suspending operations for the 1987‚Äì88 season. The Troy Slapshots had folded earlier in the previous season, and the Mohawk Valley Comets in Utica, NY had been replaced with an American Hockey League team.

Based in Mobile, Alabama, the chain of stores operated from 1879 until 1998 when it was taken over by Dillard's. History C.J. Gayfer migrated to Mobile, Alabama, from Southwold, England, sometime after the Civil War. He opened a retail department store, Gayfer's, in downtown Mobile in 1879. At the time of his death in 1915, Gayfer's employed 150 people and averaged over $500,000 in annual sales. Gayfer became well known for his philanthropy and was one of the earliest proponents of employee health care benefits. During the 1950s, the Mercantile Stores chain acquired Gayfer's, which then worked aggressively on the expansion of the chain. The first branch store was opened at Town & Country Plaza in Pensacola, Florida, in 1956. This successful move was followed four years later with the opening of the Springdale Plaza store in Mobile, Alabama, becoming the company's flagship store. The Downtown Mobile store closed in 1985. Gayfer's expanded into the Western Gulf Coast in 1963, opening a store at Edgewater Plaza Shopping City (later Edgewater Mall) in Biloxi, Mississippi. This store was expanded in 1974 and again in 1987; it was severely damaged by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 (by this time it was Dillard's) and had to be rebuilt. In 1969 a store was opened in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. In 1970, the apostrophe in the company name was dropped. This was clearly a banner year for the company, as it opened stores in Montgomery, Alabama (through the purchase of Montgomery-based Montgomery Fair); Jackson Mall in Jackson, Mississippi, and started construction of a second store in Pensacola, Florida, at Cordova Mall. For the next twenty years, new stores would be opened or remodeled, and by 1981 there were 18 stores bearing the Gayfers name. In 1989, the Gayfers flagship store anchoring Springdale Plaza and Mall in Mobile expanded to . In February 1992, parent Mercantile acquired Maison Blanche by converting their Orlando (Altamonte, Florida, Fashion Square), Daytona Beach (Volusia), and Jacksonville (Roosevelt, Regency, Orange Park, Avenues) stores under the Gayfers banner. This led to them becoming one the largest department store chains in the Southern United States as well as the largest stretching from Miami to Atlanta to Houston. In 1998, Mercantile Stores was purchased by Dillard's, Inc., and the stores that were not closed or sold to other retailers were converted to Dillard's, which ceased expanding through acquisitions after this happened. Across the South, each store had a prominent teen board from the 1960s onward called \\"The Gayfer Girls,\\" which advised the store on the latest in teen fashions and produced local fashion shows. Rosa Parks also worked at the Montgomery store when it was still called Montgomery Fair during the Civil Rights Movement.

She was the first woman to hold the post. Early life She was born in South Hackney, London, England, the seventh of eight children born to William Booth and Catherine Mumford, who had earlier in the year founded The Christian Mission, which became The Salvation Army in 1878. Catherine Booth had recently read Uncle Tom's Cabin and wanted to name her baby 'Evangeline', but William Booth did not like the name and wrote 'Evelyne' on the birth certificate. Years later, while in the United States, Evelyne would be persuaded by Frances Willard, founder of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, to adopt the name 'Evangeline' as being more dignified and more befitting the commander of The Salvation Army in America.Notable American Women 1607‚Äì1950: A Biographical Dictionary, James, James, and Boyer Editors, The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Mass. (1971) At 15 she was a Sergeant selling the Army's paper The War Cry in the slums of east London. In 1887, at 21 years of age, she became the officer of the corps in Marylebone, where there was very strong opposition to The Salvation Army. Wherever trouble threatened, General Booth‚Äôs solution was invariably the same, 'Send Eva!'.Evangeline Booth on SAWiki The Salvation Army She was appointed as Field Commissioner throughout Great Britain from 1888 to 1891, courageously facing riotous crowds. From 1891 until 1896 she was in charge of Officer Training. When in 1896 an American break-away group led by her brother Ballington Booth and his wife Maud Ballington Booth attempted to tempt American Salvationists away from The Salvation Army and into a rival group called Volunteers of America, General Booth sent Evangeline to New York. When she arrived the doors to Army headquarters on 14th Street had been locked against her. However, \\"she mounted the fire escape and climbed through a rear window. The dissidents hissed and booed until she literally wrapped herself in an available American flag and challenged: \\"Hiss that, if you dare.\\" In the stunned silence she played her concertina and sang \\"Over Jordan without Fearing.\\" Ballington's rebellion was quelled.\\"The People's Almanac by David Wallechinsky & Irving Wallace She was appointed temporary Territorial Commander of the United States, then Territorial Commander of Canada. In 1904 she returned as Commander of the United States, and held this position until 1934. In the aftermath of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, she led a mass meeting in Union Square, New York, and raised over $12,000 for Salvation Army relief work among the victims of the disaster. During this period she became a US citizen. In August 1917, despite the differences between Commander Evangeline Booth and US General Pershing, commander of the American Expeditionary Force (AEF), the first of 250 Salvationists left New York for the front line of the Great War in France. They soon won the confidence of the troops with their cheerful brand of ‚Äòseven-days-a-week‚Äô Christianity. As tributes poured in, Evangeline protested: ‚ÄòThe Salvation Army has had no new success; we have only done an old thing in an old way.‚Äô The American people disagreed, and subscribed an unprecedented $13 million to clear debts incurred by The Army, through its provision of canteens, hostels, rest rooms during the war, and afterwards on the provision of care and accommodation for the returning forces. For her work in support of the AEF, Booth was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal by the U.S. Army. Booth was one of only a very few civilian women to be so honored for service during the First World War. In 1927, Evangeline visited her brother, General Bramwell Booth, with a memorandum which set to change the way in which The Salvation Army appointed its General. Bramwell was not convinced; he was adamant that he would appoint his successor as his father had done before him. In January 1929, the first High Council of The Salvation Army decided otherwise, and since then the General has been elected by the High Council, in line with Evangeline Booth's original proposal. Fourth General Evangeline Booth was elected General by the second High Council in 1934. She brought to the Generalship a wealth of experience in many areas of The Army's work but never lost the zeal and enthusiasm of the early years. Dubbed ‚ÄòThe Musician General‚Äô by Army papers of the time, she took great interest in the soul- winning activities of the musical sections of The Salvation Army. Like her father, the Founder, Evangeline extensively travelled the world. After her election as General she toured Great Britain, and in 1935 India, Ceylon, Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii and the United States; then, immediately upon her return, Norway and Sweden. By the end of 1935 she undertook a ‚Äòmotorcade‚Äô - the entire East Coast of England up to Darlington, then several Western Counties and the Thames Valley. The following year she went on another motorcade from Land's End to John O‚ÄôGroats, and visited Canada, the United States and France, though by this time she was over seventy years old. The Salvation Army's work greatly prospered during Evangeline Booth's leadership, with Salvation Army activities being commenced in Singapore, Algeria, Egypt, French Equatorial Africa, the Philippines, Mexico, and Penang (Malaya). Later years Her term of office ended on October 31, 1939 when Commissioner George Lyndon Carpenter was elected as the Army's fifth General. Towards the end of November, Evangeline left Britain for her home in up-state New York, and spent the remaining years of her life there. She wrote several books, including Toward a Better World and Songs of the Evangel. The Salvation Army Evangeline Booth College in Atlanta, Georgia is named after her, as is 'The Evangeline Booth Lodge' in Chicago which is \\"a haven for families and individuals suddenly homeless because of eviction, disasters such as a fire or flood, loss of utilities, domestic violence, being stranded while traveling, or other crises.\\"The Salvation Army Chicago website General Evangeline Booth lived in Hartsdale, New York, until her death at the age of 84 from arteriosclerosis.

The family Clostridiaceae (scientific name) defined by the taxonomic outline of Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology contains as its core the genus Clostridium (sensu stricto), as well as Acetivibrio, Acidaminobacter, Alkaliphilus, Anaerobacter, Caloramator, Caloranaerobacter, Coprobacillus, Dorea, Natronincola, Oxobacter, Sarcina, Sporobacter, Thermobrachium, Thermohalobacter, and Tindallia. The previous inclusion of these additional genera in a family Clostridiaceae is based for the most part because the type species of these genera are in many cases phylogenetically related to misclassified species of the genus Clostridium. However, with the exception of Anaerobacter, Caloramator, Oxobacter, Sarcina, and Thermobrachium, these genera fall outside the radiation of what can be considered the true family Clostridiaceae and are now regarded as belonging to other families within the low G + C, Gram-positive phylum. This misclassification is the result of well-known problems of the current taxonomic structure of the traditional genus Clostridium. The phylogenetic analysis of Collins (1994) was the first large-scale comparison of 16S rRNA gene sequences of species of the genus Clostridium and related taxa. The fact that the species of the genus Clostridium did not form a monophyletic group has been shown in a number of studies in which small groups of Clostridium species had been compared as far back as 1981. The comparative study of Collins (1994) and subsequent studies can be used to conclude that more than half of the species currently assigned to this genus are in fact not closely related to the type species, C. butyricum, and from a phylogenetic standpoint should not be included in a newly defined genus Clostridium. This extensive genetic diversity of the genus Clostridium had been shown using 23S rRNA:DNA hybridization studies back in 1975 by Johnson and Francis, but the 16S rRNA gene sequence approach revealed the actual phylogenetic relationships between the species of this genus and other genera. The genus Clostridium currently comprises 152 validly described species in nomenclature.www.bacterio.net However, on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses, only 73 of these fall within the radiation of the type species of the genus Clostridium.

Federation was scheduled to occur on 1 January 1901, but since the general election for the first Parliament of Australia was not to be held until March, it was not possible to follow the conventions of the Westminster system and appoint the leader of the majority in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. Instead, an interim government would be appointed, holding office from 1 January until the result of the election was known. The first Governor-General of Australia was John Hope, 7th Earl of Hopetoun (who later became the 1st Marquess of Linlithgow). His initial task on arriving in Australia on 15 December 1900 was to appoint a Prime Minister to lead the interim government. Hopetoun had little knowledge of the Australian political scene and had no formal instructions from the Colonial Office. On 19 December, following the precedent of the Canadian Confederation, Hopetoun commissioned the Premier of the most populous colony to form a government. That state was New South Wales, and its premier was Sir William Lyne.Brian Carroll, Australia's Prime Ministers: From Barton to Howard (Rosenberg Publishing, Ltd., 2004), pp23‚Äì24 This was a controversial choice as Lyne had become premier in September 1899 only after the government of the more popular and experienced George Reid had lost its majority in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly. Lyne supported federation only at the last minute after long being a strong opponent and, as a result, he was unpopular with other leading colonial, pro-federation politicians including Edmund Barton and Alfred Deakin. The Bulletin summed up many people's view when it editorialised, \\"Among the men who can claim by merit or accident, to be front- rank politicians of Australia, Lyne stands out conspicuously as almost the dullest and most ordinary\\". However, there were those who supported the choice of Lyne, as Barton was at that time not a member of a parliament. Despite significant efforts, Lyne was unable to persuade any other colonial politicians to join his government. In particular, Barton wrote to him, \\"If your object is to ask me to join you in a federal administration, it will be of little use for us to meet and discuss the matter. It would be a contradiction of my whole career in relation to federation if I served under a prime minister who had throughout opposed the adoption by the people of the measure of which he is now asked to the first constitutional guardian\\".John Nethercote, \\"Blunder put Barton in the box seat\\", Canberra Times, 21 December 2000, p. 11 Lyne returned his commission to Lord Hopetoun at 10 pm on 24 December. Alfred Deakin, among others, had now persuaded Hopetoun to commission Barton as Prime Minister if Lyne was not able to form a ministry. At 11 pm that evening, Barton was given Hopetoun's commission, and he was successful in forming a government, which took office on 1 January 1901. He appointed Lyne as his Minister for Home Affairs.

Located in Stuttgart-Hohenheim, it has since 1818 been the University of Hohenheim and is not related to the University of Stuttgart, except for some joint activities. What is now the University of Stuttgart was founded in 1829, and celebrated its 175th anniversary in 2004. Because of the increasing importance of the technical sciences and instruction in these fields, from 1876 the university was known as the Technische Hochschule Stuttgart (Stuttgart Institute of Technology). In 1900 it was awarded the right to grant doctoral degrees in the technical disciplines. The development of the courses of study at the Technische Hochschule Stuttgart led to its renaming in 1967 to the present-day \\"Universit√§t Stuttgart\\". With this change of name came along a built-up of new fields, such as history of science and technology and the social sciences, and the extension of existing ones, such as history and art history. Since the end of the 1950s, a part of the university has been located in the suburb of Stuttgart-Vaihingen. Most technical subjects (computer science, engineering, etc.) are located in Vaihingen, while the humanities, the social sciences, architecture, and similar topics are still located in the city center campus.

The French used both military force and diplomacy to maintain their position in the island, appointing the former ruler of Nosy Be Binao as the gouverneur principal of the island. Though it was difficult for the French to control the littoral, they founded a plantation colony in Nosy Be, mainly producing sugar and cash crops.¬´ Sanchez S.

The main fleet led by Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky reached Nosy Be on January 9, 1905, where it met a smaller detachment led by Admiral Dmitry von F√∂lkersam that had arrived already on December 28, 1904. The fleet stayed for two months for refurbishing and coaling, leaving on March 17 to meet its fate ten weeks later at the Battle of Tsushima. =Lynching of tourists, 2013= The island, like most of Madagascar, suffers from an extreme level of uncertainty linked to crime and violence. Rumours quickly turn into accusations in Madagascar, and lynchings are common, even for allegations related to traffic accidents or theft. On October 3, 2013, the body of an 8-year-old boy was discovered at the beach of Ambatoloaka on the island. The condition of the body was poor after one week in the water, and a rumour was spread that the child had been murdered by Western organ-trafficking tourists. The uncle of the boy, a local named Zaidou, was detained by the local police for questioning, but a violent mob gathered to storm the local jail to punish the supposed murderer. As the uncle was not found, the anger of the mob turned to the Westerners having been in contact with the person, French tourists S√©bastien Judalet and Roberto Gianfalla. Judalet was found and dragged from his hotel to the beach of Ambatoloaka, where the large mob repeatedly hit him with sticks and stones. The police received at least five calls from bystanders or expatriates but did not respond. Two police officers actually joined the mob, one of which who was filming the lynching on his smartphone. After three hours of torture and humiliation, the naked and bleeding tourists were put into car tires and thrown alive into a bonfire on the beach. On the afternoon of October 3, 2013, the uncle Zaidou was found driving on the island. A mob of several hundred quickly lynched him by burning him alive on a public street next to a mosque. Both events were filmed by the bystanders, publishing the murders on the internet. In spite of this mass of evidence, the local justice took two years of investigation to finally convict 4 members of the mob to lifetime imprisonment and 6 others to shorter sentences; 26 suspects in custody were released without charge as well as the two police officers. A local politician, Joseph Yoland, was accused of inciting the killings on his radio station at the island, but the charges were dropped when the court allegedly was unable to retrieve any recordings of the aired shows that evening. Following the events, the French authorities warned travellers for \\"high risk of assaults, that could be extremely violent\\", U.S. travellers are also advised \\"[to] be aware of the potential for mob violence and ‚Äòpopular justice‚Äô that is sometimes directed towards foreign nationals.\\". The lynching in Nosy Be is a rare public murder of expatriates in Madagascar; most lynchings concern locals. However, expatriates are frequently subject to kidnapping and extortion, such as the January 2015 kidnapping of a 12-year old French child outside of his school, and two separate kidnappings of French citizens of Indo-Pakistani origin in April 2016 that triggered the intervention of the French police tactical unit GIGN in Madagascar. Geography A female black lemur and her offspring at the Lokobe Reserve, Nosy Be, November, 2001 Nosy Be is located about eight kilometers () from the coast of Madagascar in the Mozambique Channel; several smaller islands are located nearby, including Nosy Komba, Nosy Mitsio, Nosy Sakatia, and Nosy Tanikely. The island's main town is Andoany. The volcanic island has an area of about , and its highest peak is Mont Lokobe at ; the volcano is of Holocene origin but has not erupted in recorded history. There are eleven volcanic crater lakes on the island. The island is known for having one of the world's smallest frogsStumpffia pygmaea (Stumpffia pygmaea) and chameleon (Brookesia minima).Tim Flannery and Peter Schouten, Astonishing Animals: Extraordinary Creatures and the Fantastic Worlds They Inhabit. New York: Atlantic Monthly Press, 2004. Page 126-127. The Lokobe Reserve is one of Madagascar's five Strict Nature Reserves (R√©serves Naturelles Int√©grales). Nosy Be is also home to a specific color of panther chameleon (Furcifer pardalis). =Omura's whale= Omura's whale off Nosy Be Recent studies indicate that adjacent waters around the channel between Nosy Be and Madagascar host a habitat for notable number of Omura's whale, and this has allowed researchers to conduct field studies targeting this rare species for the first time. =Climate= Nosy Be has a tropical monsoon climate. It is most humid in summer (December, January, February). The Tsaratanana massif partially protects the island from the strong north-east winds affecting the region in August or during tropical depressions. The wet season lasts from October until the beginning of May, followed by a relatively short dry season that lasts through September. As characteristic of its climate however, it still sees moderate amounts of precipitation even during this time. Daytime temperatures remain fairly steady throughout the year, hovering around 30¬∞C (86 ¬∞F), while the nights are slightly cooler during the dry season.  Administration  The island constitutes a department within Diana Region and is organized as the City of Nosy Be (Commune Urbaine de Nosy Be). Its mayor is Mr. Vita Zarga. Economy Once a major location of plantation of sugar cane and production of its derived products (sugar, rum), the island's main activities are now the plantation of ylang-ylang (for the production of essential oils) and tourism. Nosy Be is the most developed tourism destination in Madagascar. This is the only place in Madagascar where all-inclusive large resorts can be found. Transportation The island is served by Fascene Airport. The airport is serviced by commercial flights with Air Madagascar, Air Austral, Ewa, Ethiopian Airlines, and has direct flights from Europe on Neos. Its main city and harbour, Hell-Ville, can be reached by boat from Ankify.

In about 1992, the company appointed John Linton (now deceasedhttp://www.gizmodo.com.au/2012/02/rip-aussie-tech-legend-john-linton/) as the new CEO of a combined entity who was determined to double their already substantial market share, largely by massive discounting without reducing the traditional good quality of an Osborne machine. The marketing push was financed by demanding that customers place a 100% deposit and then wait six weeks before picking up their new system, and by buying components on ever more generous credit terms from major suppliers like Micronics and Seagate. For about six months the new policy was remarkably effective: Osborne sales boomed and competitors were unable to match their prices. Osborne were selling well below cost, but their retail losses were made up for by currency fluctuations, in particular the steadily rising value of the Australian dollar against the United States dollar. Inevitably, the currency movement swung back the other way eventually, and Osborne were placed on credit hold by several of their major suppliers: unable to secure more components until at least some of the previous shipments had been paid for, and unable to ship the promised new computers to the many customers who had long since paid in full for them, Osborne went into Voluntary Administration on 25 June 1995. The notification was passed to the company's employees on 26 June 1995.

In many ships a shortage of 1-pounders caused them to be replaced by 3-inch (76 mm) guns. Their primary weapon, though, was their torpedo battery of a dozen 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes in four triple mounts. They also carried a pair of depth charge rails. A \\"Y-gun\\" depth charge thrower was added to many ships.Friedman, pp. 44‚Äì45 Construction and career Fuller, the first Navy ship named for Marine Captain Edward Fuller, who was killed in the Battle of Belleau Wood, was launched 5 December 1918 by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, San Francisco, California; sponsored by Miss Gladys Sullivan; and commissioned on 28 February 1920, Lieutenant Commander R. E. Rogers in command. After a brief cruise to the Hawaiian Islands, Fuller arrived at her home port, San Diego, California, on 28 April 1920, and at once took up the schedule of training which took the Pacific destroyers along the west coast from California to Oregon. In February and March 1923, she joined in Battle Fleet maneuvers in the Panama Canal Zone, and returned to experimental torpedo firing and antiaircraft firing practice off San Diego. In July 1923, with her division, she sailed north for maneuvers and repairs at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. While making their homeward-bound passage from San Francisco, California to San Diego on the night of 8 September, the division went on the rocks at Point Honda when mistakes were made in positional calculations, causing the Honda Point Disaster in the foggy darkness. Fuller was abandoned, with all of her crew reaching safety. The ship later broke in two and sank. She was decommissioned 26 October 1923.

Passed in 1996 under Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien's government, it repeals the Narcotic Control Act and Parts III and IV of the Food and Drugs Act, and establishes eight Schedules of controlled substances and two Classes of precursors. It provides that \\"The Governor in Council may, by order, amend any of Schedules I to VIII by adding to them or deleting from them any item or portion of an item, where the Governor in Council deems the amendment to be necessary in the public interest.\\" The Act serves as the implementing legislation for the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, and the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. Amendments to the act In November 2007, the Justice Minister Rob Nicholson introduced Bill C-26, which proposed a number of mandatory minimum penalties imposed on those who commit drug offences. On February 27, 2009, Bill C-15, a re-introduction of C-26 received first reading in the Second Session of the 40th Zl of Canada. On June 9, 2009, the House of Commons passed Bill C-15 and it went to the Senate for study and approval. On December 14, 2009, the Senate passed Bill C-15, with some amendments, for approval by the House of Commons. When the Canadian Parliament dissolved in a prorogation on January 31, 2010, Bill C15, along with all unpassed legislation then tabled before the Commons, fell. Early in 2012, the next parliament passed Bill C-10, receiving Royal Assent in March. The final legislation sees changes made to four areas of the Act, outlining mandatory minimum sentences for offences relating to the trafficking and production of various controlled substances. Mandatory minimum sentencing does not apply to simple possession and trafficking in smaller amounts. On October 17, 2018, the federal Cannabis Act came into effect, legalizing the possession, sale and production of cannabis. Everyone with a criminal record for cannabis possession became eligible to apply for a pardon on this date.

It had a population of 11,816 at the 2011 census. It is twinned with Saint-Jean-de-Bournay, in France.UK Twin Towns History Wath can be traced back to Norman times, It has an entry in the 1076 Domesday Book as Wad and Waith. It remained for some centuries a rural settlement astride the junction of the old Doncaster‚ÄìBarnsley and Rotherham‚ÄìPontefract roads, the latter a branch of Ryknield Street. North of the town was the ford of the River Dearne. The origin of its name has been linked to the Latin vadum and the Old Norse vath (ford or wading place).F. W. Moorman, West Riding Place Names (Leeds: privately printed for Thoresby Society), 1910. The town received a Royal Charter in 1312‚Äì1313. entitling it to a weekly Tuesday market and an annual two-day fair, but these were soon discontinued. The market was revived in 1814.David Hey, Medieval South Yorkshire (Ashbourne:Landmark Publishing) 2003 Until local government reorganisation in 1974, Wath was within the historic county of the West Riding of Yorkshire. Until the mid-19th century the town had a racecourse of regional importance, linked to the estate at nearby Wentworth. This fell into disuse, but traces of the track can be seen between Wath and Swinton and it is remembered in street names.geograph.org.uk page on Racecourse Road on the Wath/Swinton border, built on the line of the course. There was a pottery at Newhill, close to deposits of clay, but it was overshadowed by the nearby Rockingham Pottery in Swinton.W. Keble Martin, A History of the Ancient Parish of Wath-upon-Dearne (South Yorkshire), W. E. Farthing, 1920. About the turn of the 19th century, the poet and newspaper editor James Montgomery, resident at that time, called it \\"the Queen of villages\\". This rural character changed rapidly in the 19th and 20th centuries, as coal mining developed. =Coal mining= The town lies within the South Yorkshire coalfield, where high-quality bituminous coal was dug from outcrops and near-surface seams in primitive bell pits for many hundreds of years. Several high-grade coal seams are close to the surface in this area, including the prolific Barnsley and Parkgate seams. The rising demand for coal arose from rapid industrialisation of the area in the 19th and early 20th century. The population swelled and the local infrastructure was developed for the coal industry, but this reliance on the one industry stored up future problems. The Dearne and Dove Canal, opened in stages from 1798 to 1804 to access the collieries on the southern side of the Dearne Valley, passed through the town just north of the High Street on an embankment and then turned north into the valley. This wide section was known locally as the \\"Bay of Biscay\\". The canal closed in 1961 after many years of disuse and poor repair.Roger Glister, The Forgotten Canals of Yorkshire: Wakefield to Swinton via Barnsley; The Barnsley and Dearne & Dove Canals (Barnsley:Wharncliffe Books) 2004 Much of the canal line has since been used for roads, one of them called Biscay Way. By the 20th century, heavy industry was evident, with many large collieries operating. Wath Main and Manvers Main were the two usually mentioned. After the Second World War, the collieries clustered around Manvers were developed into a large complex, also covering coal preparation, coal products and a coking plant, which was not only visible, but detectable in the air for miles around. =Railways= Rail took over from the canal as a means of coal transportation. Wath upon Dearne became a rail-freight centre of national importance. Wath marshalling yard, built north of the town in 1907, was one of the biggest, and for its time one of the most modern railway marshalling yards in the country. It was one of the eastern ends of the trans- Pennine Manchester‚ÄìSheffield‚ÄìWath electrified railway (also known as the Woodhead Line), a project which spanned the Second World War and was in part justified by the need to transport large amounts of coal mined in the Wath area to customers in North-West England. Wath once had three railway stations: Wath Central in Moor Road, Wath (Hull and Barnsley) and Wath North both in Station Road, in order of distance from the town centre. This most distant station was the last to close in 1968, under the Beeching Axe. The town no longer has a rail link, although there has been talk of opening a station on the Sheffield‚ÄìWakefield‚ÄìLeeds line at Manvers, roughly a mile from the town centre. =The decline of coal= The local coal industry was in the forefront of the dramatic decline of the British coal-mining industry, precipitated by a change in government economic policy in the early 1980s. This had severe knock-on effects on many subsidiary local industries and caused much local hardship. The 1985 miners' strike was sparked by the impending closure of Cortonwood Colliery in Brampton Bierlow, a neighbouring village often considered part of Wath. Along with the whole of the Dearne Valley, Wath was classified as an impoverished area and received much public money, including European funds. These were put into regenerating the area from the mid-1990s onwards, causing a certain amount of economic revival, and made the area to be more rural, as much land to the north of the town once used by collieries and marshalling yards was returned to scrubland and countryside, dotted with light industrial and commercial office parks. This regeneration of what was still classified as brownfield land has involved building it over with various industrial and commercial parks, and large housing developments have also been started. Today Blue Murder live at Montgomery Hall, Wath-upon-Dearne, Sunday 1 November 1987 (left to right: Heather Brady, Lal Waterson, Rachel Waterson, Norma Waterson, Martin Carthy, Mike Waterson, Dave Brady, Jim Boyes) Wath upon Dearne is centred on Montgomery Square, which contains the town's main shops, the library and the bus station. Immediately to the west is the substantial Norman All Saints Church, on a small leafy green with the Town Hall, the Montgomery Hall and a campus of the Dearne Valley College. There are several pubs in the town centre, including a branch of Wetherspoons and Wath Tap, Rotherham's first micro-pub specialising in locally brewed real ale. Today Wath is still emerging from the sudden collapse of the coal industry, although jobs and some low-level affluence have returned. After a hiatus between the clearing of the former colliery land and recent redevelopment, when the area felt rather rural, the construction of large distribution centres to the north of the town is restoring an industrial feel, but without the pollution issues connected with coal. Recently several large distribution warehouses for the clothing chain Next have opened. Much new housing is being built on this reclaimed land. Wath Festival, held around the early May bank holiday, is a folk and acoustic music and arts festival founded by members of the Wath Morris Dancing Team in 1972. It has grown to host some well-known names on the folk, acoustic and world music scene. While festival events occur across the town, most of the larger music concerts are held at the Montgomery Hall Theatre and Community Venue. Artists recently appearing include Dougie MacLean, Fairport Convention, Martin Simpson, John Tams, Frances Black, John McCusker, Stacey Earle and Eddi Reader. The festival celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2012 and won Village Festival Of The Year in the 2013 FATEA Awards. The festival has been a supporter of upcoming young artists such as Lucy Ward, and Greg Russell & Ciaran Algar. It has also hosted the Wath Festival Young Performers Award, founded by the young Sheffield-based musician Charlie Barker in 2011, who handed it over to a festival committee in 2014. Winners of the Young Performers Award include Luke Hirst & Sarah Smout, Sunjay, Rose Redd and Hannah Cumming. The event includes traditional dancing from local Morris and Sword Dancing groups, street performances, workshops, children's events, and a Saturday morning parade from Montgomery Hall through Montgomery Square and back to St James's Church, for a traditional throwing of bread buns from the parish church tower. Local schools, organisations and local Labour MP John Healey are active in celebrating the town's history and contributing to community activities at the annual festival. The RSPB's Old Moor nature reserve lies a mile to the north-west of the town.RSPB Old Moor It occupies a \\"flash\\", where mining-induced subsidence of land close to a river has created wetlands. Sport Wath Athletic F.C. served the community from the 1880s to the Second World War, playing in the Midland League and reaching the 1st Round of the FA Cup in 1926. No senior team has represented the settlement since the 1950s, and Wath remains one of the largest areas in Yorkshire without such a team. However, it has a Rugby Union team that plays in the Yorkshire Division 2. Education There are four primary schools, all serving ages 3‚Äì11: Our Lady and St Joseph's Catholic Primary School, Wath Central Primary School, Wath C of E Primary School, and Wath Victoria Primary School. The town's two secondary schools are Saint Pius X Catholic High School (an 11‚Äì16 school) and the much larger Wath Academy, which has a sixth form and provides 11‚Äì18 education. Both take students from a wider area. Wath (Park Road) Secondary Modern School closed in 1963.

Retrieved March 4, 2013. was a Puerto Rican commercial artist and comic-book artist and painter whose career lasted over 70 years in the mainland United States. Biography Alex Schomburg was born on May 10, 1905, in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, as the son of Guillermo Schomburg, a civil engineer and land surveyor of German ancestry, and Francisca Rosa. Alex Schomburg moved to New York City in 1917, where he joined his older brothers and attended public school. In 1923 he began work as a commercial artist with three of his brothers. In 1928, the brothers' partnership ended and Schomburg found work with the National Screen Service, creating lantern slides and working on movie trailers there through 1944. Illustration for left During the 1930s, in addition to working for the NSS, Schomburg freelanced Better Publications, producing interior line art for Thrilling Wonder Stories and others of the company's pulp magazines. His skill at drawing anything mechanical soon had him illustrating aviation covers for Flying Aces and electronic equipment for the Hugo Gernsback pulp Radio Craft. Schomburg's first science fiction-themed cover was for the September 1939 issue of Startling Stories. As the artist recalled in 1939, \\"One day the publisher asked me to do an illustration for Thrilling Wonder Stories. I had always been interested in science fiction and they liked the way I handled the art work. I enjoy reading the story as much as doing the illustrations. In my opinion an illustration is very important. For instance, give the same story to two different persons ... then ask them to picture a certain scene. You can bet they'll be entirely different.\\" The following decade, Schomburg freelanced primarily for Timely Comics, the 1940s forerunner of Marvel, displaying his talent for action tableaux in covers featuring Captain America, the Sub- Mariner, the Human Torch, and other superheroes. His first recorded comic-book work is two covers released the same month, for Daring Mystery Comics #1 and Marvel Mystery Comics #3 (both cover-dated Jan. 1940).Alex Schomburg at the Grand Comics Database.\\"The Alex Schomburg Checklist at LiveForEverett.com. Archived from the original on July, 23, 2008. Schomburg would draw most of the companies covers, as well as a smattering of single-page interior illustrations, through Marvel Mystery Comics #76 (Sept. 1946). He also provided covers for Pines Publications, for titles including Exciting Comics and America's Best Comics, featuring such superheroes as the Black Terror and the Fighting Yank, as well as for Harvey Comics, including the licensed radio- series crimefighter star of Green Hornet Comics. On some Pines comics from 1947 to 1949, he signed covers as \\"Xela.\\"\\"Xela\\" at the Grand Comics Database. In the early 1950s, Schomburg left comics and spent the remainder of his career on covers and illustrations for science fiction magazines, astrology publications, and books, including the Winston juvenile series. In 1977, Schomburg and a few of his fellow Golden Age comic book artists collaborated on the Invaders Annual #1, written by Roy Thomas. Schomburg penciled and inked a six-page chapter featuring the Golden Age Human Torch. Late in life, Schomburg resided in Hillsboro, Oregon, and died in Beaverton, Oregon, on April 7, 1998.

In October 1827, while walking home from a farm unarmed, Wright was assaulted with a club by an absconded convict, Patrick Clynch, but was able to fend off the blow. Clynch made several more attacks in the following days on overseers and guards, and was eventually shot dead. Although the matter was investigated at the time, it flared up more than a year later, when Wright was accused of ordering Clynch to be shot although he knew he was already in custody.

An outspoken critic of Syrian interference in Lebanese affairs, he was killed in 2005 by a bomb placed under the passenger seat of his Mercedes. Lebanese people accused the Syrian government of assassinating him. He was the stepfather of the Lebanese Armenian politician Rafi Madayan, who also has a stepson, Charbel Khalifeh Hachem. Early life and career George Hawi was born in the village of Bteghrine, Lebanon on 5 November 1938 to a Lebanese family. Although born into an Antiochian Greek Orthodox Christian family, Hawi was a professed atheist.\\"What united them was opposition to a supposedly corrupt and pro-western administration, unfairly dominated by factions of Lebanon's Maronite Christian community. Notwithstanding his own professed atheism, Hawi, Greek Orthodox by birth, was valued as an iconic Christian figure within a coalition often painted as sectarian Muslim.\\" Lawrence Joffe, 'Obituary: George Hawi: Lebanese communist leader who espoused Muslim- Christian dialogue', The Guardian (London) 22 June 2005, Pg. 29. He became active in student politics in his early years at university, participating in numerous strikes and demonstrations and in several popular movements. He joined the LCP in 1955 and became one of the main leaders of its Student League by the end of the decade. In 1964, he was imprisoned for his involvement in a strike against Lebanon‚Äôs state-controlled tobacco manufacturer. In 1969 he was again in prison for participation in a demonstration on 23 April in support of the Palestinian cause, and again in 1970 for his part in attacking an army detachment. Hawi was briefly expelled from the LCP in 1967 for calling for more independence from the policies of the Soviet Union. He rejoined the Party and was elected a member of its political bureau in the second and third congresses in 1968 and 1972. Hawi was elected as the general secretary of the Lebanese Communist Party after its fourth congress in 1979 ‚Äî a position he kept until 1993 when he resigned. He was the fourth general secretary of the party following Fuad Shemali, Farajallah el-Helou and Nicolas Shawi. He was succeeded by Farouk Dahrouj. During the Lebanese Civil War Hawi, who used the kunya-style nom de guerre \\"Abu Anis\\", established the Popular Guard, the LCP militia, which was aligned with the Lebanese National Movement (LNM) of Druze leader Kamal Jumblatt in its opposition to the Maronite-dominated government and Christian-backed militias. George Hawi with the young Hanna Gharib who currently leads the party The LCP was also active in the guerrilla warfare against Israel and its proxy militia, the South Lebanon Army (SLA), in southern Lebanon, after the Israeli invasion in 1982. During the invasion he created the Lebanese National Resistance Front together with Muhsin Ibrahim. LNRF was commanded by Elias Atallah. At later stages of the war, the LCP under Hawi allied with Syria, which had entered Lebanon in 1976, but was to stay in the country for nearly 30 years. He became a critic of the influence of Damascus on Lebanon late in his life, after having left the LCP in 2000. In 2004, he supported the foundation of the leftist Democratic Left Movement (DLM), that was against the Syrian presence in Lebanon and participated in the Independence Uprising of 2005. Murdered journalist Samir Kassir was a prominent member and co-founder of this group. In June 2005, Hawi claimed in an interview with Al Jazeera, that Rifaat al-Assad, brother of Hafez al Assad and uncle of Syria's current President Bashar al-Assad, had been behind the killing of Jumblatt. Assassination George Hawi was assassinated on 21 June 2005 when a bomb planted in his car was detonated by remote control, as he travelled through Beirut's Wata Musaitbi neighbourhood. A nearly one-pound charge was placed under his seat, and was detonated by remote control. His driver survived, but he was mortally wounded in the blast. Several sources including the March 14 Alliance and members of the Western media immediately blamed Syria for his killing and for the other explosions in the capital though a definitive culprit has yet to be found. In August 2011, the Special Tribunal for Lebanon informed members of Hawi's family that they had found a link between his murder and that of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafic Hariri. The STL had previously issued indictments against members of Hezbollah for the Hariri killing.

It is about the fictional undead within the D&D; universe and comprises seven chapters, introducing new content for Dungeon Masters and players, as well as providing general information about undead. It was received positively by reviewers, with praise for its material for Dungeon Masters and its illustrations, but received criticism for its weak player-oriented content. The book was the second in the series of books about specific monster types, the first being Draconomicon. Similar books published since include Lords of Madness. Libris Mortis included content from older books, such as Tome and Blood and the Book of Vile Darkness, that had been reworked. Inspiration and production Libris Mortis was written to present \\"a comprehensive overview of the undead\\" within the Dungeons & Dragons universe, offering new game rules and content, for both players and Dungeon Masters. The book is in the same format as the earlier published Draconomicon, which instead focused on Dragons, and was described as \\"a super-sized monster ecology\\" by the Nuketown podcast. Similar books that have since been released include Fiendish Codex I: Hordes of the Abyss, Fiendish Codex II: Tyrants of the Nine Hells and Lords of Madness. Inspiration for the book's content came from numerous sources. In an interview posted on the Wizards of the Coast website, Collins said that inspiration came from Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, various Dracula films, along with films The Mummy and The Mummy Returns. Cordell said that pop culture has \\"less impact on [his] conceptualizations of the undead\\", but he did mention The Evil Dead, 28 Days Later and the novel Salem's Lot. According to Collins, he and Cordell worked equally on the book, with Collins focusing more on material relating to character building, sample undead and running undead, while Cordell dealt with monster design and undead material, but he said that they \\"dabbled in each others'\\" sections quite a bit as well\\". He also mentioned a monster template designed by Matt Sernett that was originally written for the Monster Manual III and had been included in Libris Mortis. Origin of the name Libris Mortis was named after a book from within the Dungeons & Dragons universe written by an aasimar cleric of Pelor named Acrinus in a dialect of the Celestial language of good outsiders. The title of the fictional book probably translates into English as From the Books of Death, though the dialect is no longer used. The title Libris Mortis' was intended to be interpreted as Latin, but Book of the Dead would translate as Liber Mortuorum.J. T. White, A Latin-English Dictionary (Longmans, Green & Co., London 1924), p. 347, 388.B. H. Kennedy, The Shorter Latin Primer (Longmans, London 1962 edition), pp 7-8. On the subject of name, Collins was quoted as saying \\"I don't have any insight on the naming process that produced Libris Mortis. I don't know Latin and wasn't involved in selecting that name. Regardless, I think what's in the book is far more important that what name is attached to it.\\" Content Libris Mortis has seven chapters and an introduction. The chapters are named \\"All About Undead\\", \\"Character Options\\", \\"Prestige Classes\\", \\"Spells\\", \\"Equipment\\", \\"New Monsters\\" and \\"Campaigns\\". =\\"All About Undead\\"= The first chapter, \\"All About Undead\\", contains general information about undead monsters. The chapter discusses the ecology of undead creatures, though this section was described as \\"very small\\", and talks about undead religion, introducing new deities. The chapter also discusses \\"stranger areas\\", including the idea of undead citizenship in cosmopolitan cities. Variant rules are introduced for areas including hauntings and exorcisms, which were received positively, and for undead hunger and appetites. The section also includes advice on how to combat undead, but according to Casey Smith of D20 Magazine Rack, \\"veteran players probably won't get much out of this part of the book\\". Overall, the section was described by one reviewer as \\"one of the more interesting\\". =\\"Character Options\\"= The second chapter, \\"Character Options\\", lists 59 feats, discusses undead characters in the party, and offers rules for undead monster classes. Many of the feats are geared towards spellcasters, with few martial feats, a single Bardic feat and no feats geared specifically towards Druids or Barbarians. Different types of feats include the Corpsecrafter tree, for spellcasters to improve their undead, monstrous feats to modify the special abilities of undead creatures, and tomb-tainted feats, allowing living characters to gain undead traits. Smith commended feats that Dungeon Masters may use, such as Spell Drain, Lifesense and Necrotic Reserves, but said that \\"feats that players might use aren't nearly as interesting\\". The discussion of and rules for undead characters was said to be the \\"weakest section of the book\\". Five alternate base classes were introduced in the Savage Species \\"monsters as classes\\" format. These are classes for the Ghoul/Ghast, Mohrg, Mummy, Vampire Spawn and Wight. =\\"Prestige Classes\\"= Chapter three, \\"Prestige Classes\\", introduces eleven new prestige classes. *Death's Chosen, for mortals with undead masters. *The Dirgesinger is a Bard-specific class, and a \\"personal favourite\\" of Smith. *Master of Radiance is a Druid specific class for fighting undead, *Master of the Shrouds can summon incorporeal undead. 3.5 edition versions of the Pale Master and the True Necromancer (originally from Tome and Blood) can also be found. The chapter has four prestige classes specifically for undead: *Ephemeral Exemplar is a class for incorporeal undead *The Lurking Terror is a stealthy undead class *The Master Vampire strengthens the abilities already possessed by a vampire *The Tomb Warden is a prestige class designed for undead who guard tombs. Kenneth Newquist, of Nuketown, said that the undead prestige classes \\"are excellent for turning traditional undead threats into something exceptional\\", and said that his \\"only complaint with these prestige classes is that there aren't enough of them\\". =\\"Spells\\"= Chapter four, \\"Spells\\", introduces 57 new spells. The spells mostly focus around the school of Necromancy, with many domain spells for the new deities introduced in the first chapter. Spells commented on by reviewers included Consumptive Field, Awaken Undead, Wither Limb, Avasculate, Necrotic Cyst (and related spells, including Necrotic Domination and Necrotic Bloat), along with spells aimed at players, such as Spawn Screen and Mass Death Ward, described as \\"more pragmatic than exciting\\". Some of the spells included in the chapter were version 3.5 reworks of spells found in the Book of Vile Darkness. =\\"Equipment\\"= Chapter five, \\"Equipment\\", contains sections on special items and alchemical substances, \\"positoxins\\", magic items and undead grafts. Positoxins, poisons that affect undead, were poorly received by reviewers, with the Nuketown podcast asking \\"we have plenty of folklore remedies for combating undead, why not create magical versions of those?\\" Magic items included profane weapons, sacred weapons, ectoplasmic armor and specific items including the Ghoul Globe and Unholy Shroud. This section was also criticized by the Nuketown podcast, which said that the \\"Magic item section is only six pages; I'd like to have seen more magic items, particularly more unique ones alone with a few lesser artifacts\\". The grafts section worked on rules introduced in the Book of Vile Darkness and the Fiend Folio, adding new undead \\"grafts\\", but did not include rules for creating your own. =\\"New Monsters\\"= Chapter six, \\"New Monsters\\", introduces 47 new monsters, the weakest of which is the Carcass Eater and the strongest of which is the Dream Vestige. Newquist praised ooze like Blood Animote, while the Nuketown podcast commended the Swarm templates. Smith praised the Brain in a Jar, swarm-shifter templates, Necropolitan, Revived Fossil and Skulking Cyst, but called the Hulking Corpse and Murk \\"surprisingly benign\\". Mike MacKenzie, of RPGnet, called the Skin Kite and Angel of Decay \\"ghastly\\", the Revived Fossil and Necropolitan \\"less interesting\\" and the Half Vampire an \\"extraordinarily bad idea\\". =\\"Campaigns\\"= The seventh and final chapter, \\"Campaigns\\", includes tips on how to use undead in campaigns and adventures, as well as how to control specific undead monsters. It also has adventure sites and back-stories for various cults. The chapter was well received, being called the \\"best section of the book\\" and being \\"better than I [the reviewer] expected\\". The maps were commended by some, being called \\"useful right out of the box\\" but Mike MacKenzie, of RPGnet, said they were \\"basically a Book of Lairs for undead. Nothing terribly remarkable here.\\" The section includes statistics and back-stories for alternatives classic undead monsters, including ten different ghosts, six liches, 19 skeletons, ten vampires, and fifteen zombies. Illustrations The Angel of Decay, by Jeremy Jarvis. The Libris Mortis art staff comprises Dawn Murin as art director, Dee Barnett, Dawn Murin and Trich Yochum as graphic designers. The graphic production specialist was Angelika Lokotz, with Candice Baker as image technician. Cartography was provided by Dennis Kauth, with the cover designed by Tom Kidd. Interior illustrations were provided by Thomas Baxa, Steve Belledin, Jeff Easley, Steve Ellis, Wayne England, Emmanuelle Hunter, Jeremy Jarvis, Chuck Lukacs (who provided the images for the start of each chapter), David Martin, Michael Phillippi, Steve Prescott, Wayne Reynolds and Brian Snoddy. The artwork was praised by Mike MacKenzie of RPGnet, who said that \\"the art is good. Its re-assuring to see the quality we expect from WotC in this department.\\" He criticized the \\"unintentionally goofy\\" images of the Mohrg Barbarian and Wight archer, but commended the \\"sepia-tinged\\" work of Wayne England as fitting the book's mood. The work by Chuck Lukacs was also praised, as were the images by Jeremy Jarvis. Jarvis' Angel of Decay and Atropal Scion were said to be \\"just as creepy as we would expect\\". Reviews Libris Mortis was generally received positively by reviewers. Mike MacKenzie, of RPGnet, gave the book a 5/5 for style and a 4/5 for substance, with the summary comment: \\"As a DM, I personally think this is a great (creepy) book, especially the first and last chapters, and there is some good crunch to be found.\\" Casey Smith, of D20 Magazine Rack, gave the book 80% \\"reviewer opinion\\", averaging with other scores to give an overall grade of 82%. Kenneth Newquist, of Nuketown, gave Libris Mortis a rating of 9/10, with the comment \\"Libris Mortis isn't an essential source book, but it is a useful one.\\" The Nuketown podcast gave the book 8/10, saying it was \\"good, but not essential. Worth picking up for anyone for whom the undead play a major role in their campaign.\\" Vincent Venturella, of Flames Rising Dot Com, gave the book 3/5 for style, 5/5 for substance and 4/5 overall. The reviewer from Pyramid commented: \\"There's a little more campaign advice here than in previous Wizards of the Coast products, though not a whole lot. You get a short introduction to what undead are and how they unlive, eat (eww), and procreate. Theories on whence they come, examples of cities and religions for the cosmopolitan zombie, and advice on strategy when facing (or being) the dead (especially the self-aware threats) make good reading, but these are sadly brief.\\" References External links *Libris Mortis at Wizards of the Coast *Libris Mortis excerpts at Wizards of the Coast *Libris Mortis art gallery at Wizards of the Coast Category:2004 books Category:Dungeons & Dragons sourcebooks ","title":"Libris Mortis"},{"id":"2089480","text":"Nick G.

He served four years on the Canadian Human Rights Panel/Tribunal. He also served as cultural and Slavey language advisor for the television program North of 60. Federal politics Sibbeston was appointed to the Senate on September 2, 1999 on the advice of Liberal prime minister Jean Chr√©tien. In the Senate, one of his goals has been to find a new name for the Northwest Territories to better reflect his jurisdiction's geography and people. He also focused on issues such as the Mackenzie Valley Pipeline, infrastructure in the North, climate change mitigation, and increasing Indigenous engagement in the economy. On January 29, 2014, Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau announced all Liberal Senators, including Sibbeston, were removed from the Liberal caucus, and would continue sitting as Independents. According to Senate Opposition leader James Cowan, the Senators will still refer to themselves as Liberals even if they are no longer members of the parliamentary Liberal caucus. Sibbeston agreed with Trudeau's decision, saying that the Northwest Territories also did not have a party system. In the same month, Sibbeston defended missing 51 out of 70 votes in the previous parliamentary session on the nastiness of partisan party politics in Ottawa, which he was not used to in the North. On May 5, 2016, Sibbeston left the Senate Liberal caucus to sit as an Independent Senator. In September 2017, Sibbeston announced that he would resign on November 21, 2017, his 74th birthday.

Leonard (born Leonard Lebitsky; April 24, 1910 - May 10, 1973) was an American comedian and actor who made frequent appearances on television variety and game shows.Obituary Variety, May 16, 1973. Biography Leonard was born Leonard Lebitsky on April 24, 1910, in Chicago (‚ÄúYou know, the city where kids play robbers and robbers‚Äù), the son of a Jewish tailor. He claimed that one of his childhood friends was Baby Face Nelson. As a young man, he worked as a lifeguard (‚ÄúI swam against Johnny Weissmuller ... and he was so fast I haven't seen him since‚Äù), and first worked professionally as a dancer, competing in Charleston contests. In the 1930s, he joined a vaudeville troupe, then began touring with the big bands, playing nightclubs all over the country. During World War II he toured bases with the United Service Organizations. The Tonight Show, hosted by Jack Paar, marked his first national exposure. For the next several years he worked steadily in Las Vegas, and made hundreds of television appearances on various panel and variety shows. He made occasional recordings, and appeared in a handful of motion pictures, such as Three Sailors and a Girl. Leonard's comedic method was sarcastic and aggressive, creating an \\"insult humor\\" genre which anticipated Don Rickles. (Leonard was roastmaster at the Friars' Club roast of Rickles, who he introduced as \\"a man who's been doing my act for about 12 years now.\\") A trademark line, after taking off his hat to reveal his bald head: \\"What did you expect, feathers?\\" He also referenced his weight problem in his act. Leonard's strong and unapologetic onstage personality (\\"Good evening, opponents!\\") belied a gentle and giving spirit that would occasionally be revealed in his act when he would sing a sentimental song. He wore a distinctive outfit: a dark suit, purposely two sizes too small, a white narrow-brimmed hat, and horn-rimmed glasses. On one variety show, Leonard's contemporaneous popularity was demonstrated when a lookalike came on stage and did a Leonard-like schtick. Then Leonard walked on stage and addressed his doppelg√§nger: \\"You've got a great future, son, but not in this business!\\" In March 1973, he collapsed shortly after finishing a performance at the Rainbow Room in New York City and underwent emergency cardiac bypass surgery, but died several weeks later at the age of 63.

The megaron (; , ), plural megara , was the great hall in ancient Greek palace complexes. Architecturally, it was a rectangular hall that was surrounded by four columns, fronted by an open, two-columned portico, and had a central, open hearth that vented though an oculus in the roof.. The megaron also contained the throne-room of the wanax, or Mycenaean ruler, whose throne was located in the main room with the central hearth.; . Similar architecture is found in the Ancient Near East though the presence of the open portico, generally supported by columns, is particular to the Aegean. Megara are sometimes referred to as \\"long-rooms\\", as defined by their rectangular (non-square) shape and the position of their entrances, which are always along the shorter wall so that the depth of the space is larger than the width.. There were often many rooms around the central megaron, such as archive rooms, offices, oil-press rooms, workshops, potteries, shrines, corridors, armories, and storerooms for such goods as wine, oil and wheat.. Structure Rectilinear halls were a characteristic theme of ancient Greek architecture.. The Mycenaean megaron originated and evolved from the megaroid, or large hall- centered rectangular building, of mainland Greece dating back to the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age. Furthermore, it served as the architectural precursor to the Greek temples of the Archaic and Classical periods.. With respect to its structural layout, the megaron includes a columned entrance, a pronaos and a central naos (cella) with early versions of it having one of many roof types (i.e., pitched, flat, barrel). The roof, specifically, was supported by wooden beams; . and since the aforesaid roof types are always destroyed in the remnants of the early megaron, the definite roof type is unknown. The floor was made of patterned concrete and covered in carpet.. The walls, constructed out of mud brick,. were decorated with fresco paintings. There were wood-ornamented metal doors, often two-leaved,. and footbaths were also used in the megaron as attested in Homer's Odyssey where Odysseus's feet were washed by Eurycleia.; Homer. Odyssey, XIX.316. The proportions involving a larger length than width are similar structurally to early Doric temples.. Purpose The megaron was used for sacrificial processions,. as well as for royal functions and court meetings. Examples A famous megaron is in the large reception hall of the king in the palace of Tiryns, the main room of which had a raised throne placed against the right wall and a central hearth bordered by four Minoan-style wooden columns that served as supports for the roof. The Cretan elements in the Tiryns megaron were adopted by the Mycenaeans from the palace type found in Minoan architecture. Frescoes from Pylos show figures eating and drinking, which were important activities in Greek culture. Artistic portrayals of bulls, a common zoomorphic motif in Mycenaean vase painting,. appear on Greek megaron frescoes such as the one in the Pylos megaron where a bull is depicted at the center of a Mycenaean procession. Other famous megara include the ones at the Mycenaean palaces of Thebes and Mycenae.. Different Greek cultures had their own unique megara; for example, the people of the Greek mainland tended to separate their central megaron from the other rooms whereas the Cretans did not do this..

In many ships a shortage of 1-pounders caused them to be replaced by 3-inch (76 mm) guns. Their primary weapon, though, was their torpedo battery of a dozen 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes in four triple mounts. They also carried a pair of depth charge rails. A \\"Y-gun\\" depth charge thrower was added to many ships.Friedman, pp. 44‚Äì45 Construction and career John Francis Burnes, named for John Francis Burnes, formerly Swasey, was laid down 4 July 1918 by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, San Francisco, California; launched 10 November 1918; sponsored by Mrs. Julius Kahn; and commissioned 1 May 1920, Commander Frank N. Eklund in command. Following shakedown and training exercises during the summer of 1920, John Francis Burnes engaged in fleet maneuvers during October. For the next 2 years she continued tactical exercises along the California coast, operating out of San Diego, California, her home port. She sailed 6 February 1923 for exercises off Mexico and the Panama Canal Zone. Following her return in April, John Francis Burnes operated out of California for 2 years with the exception of fleet maneuvers in the Caribbean in early 1924. One year later she participated in joint Army-Navy maneuvers out of San Francisco, California before joining fleet operations in Hawaii 27 April 1925. The destroyer then cruised with a large force in the Pacific, visiting Samoa, Australia, and New Zealand before returning to San Diego in September. For the next 3 years she engaged in training operations and fleet maneuvers along the West Coast, developing the techniques in naval warfare. During the summers of 1928 and 1929, John Francis Burnes engaged in reserve training cruises. John Francis Burnes arrived in San Diego 28 August 1929 and remained there until she decommissioned 25 February 1930. She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 22 July 1930 and sold as scrap metal 10 June 1931 in accordance with the London Treaty for the limitation of naval armaments. As of 2005, no other ship in the United States Navy has been named John Francis Burnes.

They were introduced in 1956, by the Victorian Railways, and last operated in 1988, although a number of the carriages were converted for other uses and are still operating. They were named after Norman Charles Harris, Chairman of Commissioners of the Victorian Railways, between 1940 and 1950. Description The Harris trains were commonly referred to as \\"Blue Trains\\" due to their deep blue colour, with only a yellow band about halfway up the body. Royal blue and yellow were common colours for the Victorian Railways rolling stock. The trains had a saloon seating layout, divided into smaller sections by full-height partitions. They were provided with either two or three sets of hand-operated dual sliding doors per carriage side. Later sets were fitted with power doors. Interiors were split into smoking and no-smoking compartments until late 1978, with the abolition of smoking on trains,Peter J. Vincent: T - Sliding Door Suburban Trailer and carriages were designated as First or Second class until 1958, when one class travel was introduced. Most of the carriages were delivered without end gangways between carriages, but safety concerns led to these being added in the final five sets as delivered from mid-1966. These sets were also fitted with only two doors per carriage side rather than three, permitting additional seating and reflecting the increasing average travel distance. The first thirty trains were fitted with automatic couplers at both ends of all carriages, and the second series with semi-permanent drawbars, except for the driving ends of motor carriages, and one end of BT carriages. Later, drawbars were fitted in the middle of first series blocks and units, although the final ten Motor cars had automatic couplers at both ends. First-series motor cars had 59 second-class seats and trailers 72 seats (first class in the T cars or second class in the BT cars), divided into smoking and non-smoking sections. For the second series the internal partitions were removed, and capacities increased to 65 and 80 passengers respectively for a total gain of 50 seats per seven-car train. Smoking was then only permitted in the middle third of each carriage. Later, a policy change saw smoking permitted in the whole of each Motor carriage, and not at all in trailers. Operations The Harris trains were originally run as 7-carriage (M-T-T-M-BT-T-M) sets, reduced to 4-carriage (M-T-T-M) sets for off-peak and weekend services. The M-T-T-M sets were known as \\"Blocks\\", while the BT-T-M sets were called \\"Units\\". The first thirty 7-car sets were delivered between 1956 and 1959, and the following thirty sets between 1961 and 1967. Initially the two types were kept separate because of the differing motor unit performance, and within the second series the final five trains had to be kept separate because of the inter-carriage walkways. This proved difficult to manage and in 1962 the segregation instruction was withdrawn. The first carriage to have walkways retrofitted was 862T in 1967, when it was rebuilt following fire damage. In 1968-69 a further ten Motor cars were delivered. At the same time, some of the Units were reduced to BT-M only and allocated to the Sandringham Line, and these actions together allowed for the formation of additional M-T-T-M blocks so that eight-car trains could run on busier routes including Lilydale, Belgrave and Glen Waverley. Later platform extensions permitted operation of eight-car trains on the Frankston, Pakenham, Alamein, Upfield, Broadmeadows, St Alans and Williamstown lines. Occasionally, M-M pairs would also be used on shuttle services between Dandenong and Pakenham. When the extended trailer cars entered service they were coupled to the new M cars, which had their power-closing door equipment activated or installed as required. The first set was 799M-891T-892T-800M (order unclear), and two more blocks were assembled using four of the seven motors in the range 792M-798M. In 1972 further cars 791M, 887T-890T and 557BT-560BT had the same equipment installed, giving a total of ten motors, six extended and four regular trailers and four backing trailers available to assemble three Long Blocks and four Units fitted with power door equipment. At this point, the total fleet would have been 62 Short Blocks, 3 Long Blocks with power-closing doors, 4 Pairs, 52 normal units and 4 Units with power-closing doors. Another difference between the first- and second-series trains was the destination rolls; the former had included Carnegie, North Williamstown, Elsternwick, Ashburton, Blackburn, Macaulay, Thomastown and Rosanna, which were replaced in the latter with Mentone, Crib Point, Holmesglen, Belgrave and Upfield. History The first 30 7-carriage trains, known as the first series, were constructed in the United Kingdom by Gloucester Railway Carriage and Wagon Company, and delivered between 1956 and 1959. Another 30, the second series, were built by Martin & King in Melbourne, and delivered between 1961 and 1967. From 1966, these were delivered with end doors and gangways between carriages, allowing passengers to change carriages. The first series of \\"T\\" and \\"BT\\" trailers were built by Comeng (the first 10 in Sydney, the rest in Melbourne), and finished by Martin & King, with the remainder built at the Newport Workshops.S.E. Dornan and R.G. Henderson: (1979) The Electric Railways of Victoria' Between 1968 and 1970, ten additional motor carriages, built by the Victorian Railways' Newport Workshops, were delivered to provide for some Harris trains to be lengthened to eight carriages. In 1970 and 1971, six new trailer carriages were built as prototypes for the next fleet (the Hitachi trains). These carriages were long, compared to of the earlier carriages, and were equipped with the mechanisms for power-closing doors, the first such use in Melbourne. However, it was not until the following year that a complete (4-carriage) train was used this way, after conversion of some motor carriages. These carriages were converted into H type carriages, for use in LH sets with V/Line, in the mid 1980s. Modifications By the time the first ten 7-car sets had been delivered, it was found that the buffing plates between carriages would bind when going around tight curves or through complicated point-work, so this equipment was removed in time for delivery of the 11th train. However, this left a lot of slack between carriages, so acceleration and braking would be both rough and noisy.Life on Australian Locomotives, David Barnett, - pg78 Around the same time, the Victorian Railways was experimenting with replacing cast-iron brake blocks with a non- metallic compound (probably asbestos), so Set 11 was fitted with these, and tested between Seaford and Frankston, in 5 mph increments up to line speed, in both directions. Four tests were made - first using the non-metallic brake blocks with empty and later loaded with cast-iron blocks, equal in weight to a crush load of passengers, and then with the cast iron brake blocks fitted to the train, as well as simulating the load, and finally the empty train with cast iron brake blocks. It was found that the new type of brake blocks performed better at higher speeds, but worse at lower speeds, so on average they gave similar performance and were approved for use. A similar test was later conducted with the Walker railmotors between Laverton and Werribee. In the 1960s the fleet was fitted with Guard-to-Driver bell communication circuits. Wheel slip was found to be a problem with the more powerful 500-series motors, so in the late 1960s through early 1970s the \\"weak field\\" power generation, which used the back-EMF from the motors, was disconnected. 547M was fitted with an experimental wheel-slip solution, but the final implementation as applied across the fleet would close off the power supply, then re-open it bypassing the acceleration control when wheel-slip was detected, with limited success. The weak-field system was reconnected in the late 1970s to early 1980s in order to keep up with amended timetables, but this brought back the wheel slip issues. By the time the second series (700+) Harris cars were being delivered, the design had been improved somewhat. A second window was fitted at the front of the Motor carriages for the guard and/or instructor driver to view the track, along with a window from the Guard's compartment into the passenger saloon, and walkways were added between all carriages within each Block or Unit. These latter changes were retrofitted to many of the 500-series carriages as well, following concerns about safety. While the 500-series trains had rotary flettner ventilators fitted; these were mounted on the curve of the roof and spun off-centre, causing a grinding noise. This was fixed in the second series with the units fitted level to the carriage floor. These units were also later fitted to the clerestory-roofed Tait stock, with their opening ceiling-windows being sealed to reduce maintenance costs. The last few vehicles constructed were used as test-beds for features in the upcoming Hitachi train design. 560BT, when issued to service, had a short stainless steel exterior panel between the centre windows. Similar stainless steel panels were placed around bridgeworks at East Richmond, the purpose of both to check for weathering and cleaning methods. The last six trailer vehicles, 891-896T, were 75 ft long over body instead of 60 ft to test clearances at platforms and junctions along with passenger flows. However, the cars were significantly heavier and when coupled to 700-series motors already featuring weaker acceleration further impacting timekeeping. While the last ten motors (791M-800M) were issued without asbestos insulation, only the last three had additional insulation in the ceiling. 799M was a further modification of the type with a forced draught ventilation system, shared with the long trailers, while 798M and 800M used the normal flettner ventilators. Similarly, 556-560BT and the long trailers were not fitted with asbestos. By the mid-1970s individual Harris cars were being sent to Bendigo North Workshops for fitting of end doors and gangways. Examples included 702M, 621T and 684T in September 1975.Newsrail February 1976 p.41 Conversions and disposal One of the two 'Greasers' at Newport Workshops 719M was the first Harris car of any type to be scrapped, due to fire damage at Sunshine in February 1973. It was scrapped at Newport Workshops on 16 September 1975, having been judged as too expensive to repair. With the exceptions of the last few carriages built, all Harris trains contained asbestos insulation. The first sets contained blue asbestos, and the later sets contained white asbestos. Due to the presence of asbestos, most were disposed of in the 1990s, by being buried in an old quarry in Clayton, a south-eastern suburb of Melbourne, some having been wrapped in plastic. No original Harris trailer cars remain, with all trailers having been converted to locomotive-hauled H cars or scrapped. Additionally, no first series motor units were preserved, the three remaining unmodified cars being high-numbered second series M cars. =Ozride set= In the mid 1980s three cars were painted pink on the ends and one side for a railway safety video. The set was 780M-674T-1555M, and operated with locomotive T334, with filming taking place primarily on the Geelong-Gheringhap line. The motor cars had their pantographs removed for the duration of filming.Newsrail September 1986, p.270-271 =Green set= A set of four carriages was refurbished in the late 80s and repainted into an experimental green and yellow livery for The Met. However, the Minister for Transport at the time didn't like the colour scheme and, without the train having moved, ordered it repainted into the traditional blue and gold scheme. The motor cars are known to have been 521M and 528M, and the trailers are believed to have been 641T and 863T. =Refurbishment= A program to refurbish the Harris trains began in 1982. The interior of the refurbished cars resembled a Comeng interior, having individual vinyl foam type seat cushions on an integrated plastic frame, replacing the former more traditional vinyl sprung seats. The refurbished cars also had air conditioning, and a new colour scheme. Due to their predominantly grey livery, the refurbished trains were known as \\"Grey Ghosts\\". The motor units were originally numbered in the 601-608M range, though these numbers later came into conflict with the Comeng fleet, and so in mid-late 1984, the cars were renumbered into the 901-908M range. The trailers were released to service in the 101-108T range, becoming 1501-1508T in 1983, and then 3501-3508T in 1984. Industrial and other problems with the refurbished trains meant that only 16 carriages were converted before the program was stopped, and the refurbished trains were withdrawn in 1991, with five motor units (901M and 904-907M) cut up for scrap. One refurbished carriage, 903M, has been preserved, and is on display at the Australian Railway Historical Society Museum at North Williamstown. All eight refurbished trailer cars were converted to standard H type passenger cars, along with motors 902M and 908M which were converted to the BCH sub-class. The four refurbished trains ran initially in an M-T-T-M configuration, but three of the trains were later remarshalled to M-T-M-M-T-M configuration. The refurbished trains generally ran on the Port Melbourne, St Kilda and Sandringham lines. They never ran in the City Loop, except for a farewell tour on 6 April 1991. The restriction to these three lines was due to the additional weight of the refurbished carriages; while the passenger areas were upgraded and included two air conditioning units per car, the mechanical components were still unmodified, and still using the 1960s-era second series motors, which were in fact less powerful than the first series cars of 1956. =Locomotive-hauled services= 55 carriages, including the carriages, were converted to H type carriages for interurban service and are still in operation with V/Line as of May 2020. These trains are currently being refurbished, and will continue in service until at least 2022. Similarly, four carriages were converted to MTH carriages, which were used as trailer cars behind DERM and DRC railmotors for many years. In later years, they were used on the Stony Point line, behind A class diesel locomotives until 26 April 2008, when Sprinter trains were introduced on the route. MTH102 was converted to a special overhead inspection car for Metro Trains Melbourne, and is now numbered IEV102. =Preservation= With most of the fleet being buried due to asbestos, or converted to H-type carriages, only four have survived. Motor cars 795M and refurbished 903M (both pictured below) are preserved at the Australian Railway Historical Society Museum. Greaser cars 794M and 797M are owned by VicTrack, and are stored at Newport Workshops. A note in Newsrail, May 1989, indicated that seven cars, with asbestos components removed, were to be preserved as an operational set, using cars 1522M, 798M, 799M, 2515T, 2606T, 2850T and 883T, in conjunction with The Met's celebrations of the 70th anniversary of the Melbourne railway electrification project.Newsrail May 1989 p.158 However, all those cars were placed off-register in 1990. It is worth noting that 798M and 799M were built without either blue or white asbestos insulation.  Models  = N Scale 1:160 = Brimbank Models has developed a range of 3D-printed Harris carriages and components which can be purchased and assembled for standard mechanisms. The carriages will be available as complete-body kits, or as a range of parts. The cost is generally around $80 per carriage plus mechanisms for motor cars, which the purchaser must source separately.

The first Viper, Jordan Stryke, first appeared in Captain America #157 (January 1973), created by Steve Englehart, Steve Gerber, Sal Buscema and John Verpoorten. He was killed by the second Viper who took his name, but Stryke later reappeared alive without explanation. A third Viper was part of Sin's Serpent Squad, but was later killed by the Scourge of the Underworld. Jordan Stryke, originally known as Jordan Dixon, began his criminal career alongside his brother Leopold, known as the Eel. The two initially worked for the Cowled Commander but were stopped by Captain America and Falcon. Later on Viper, Eel and Cobra formed the first version of the Serpent Squad. While in custody Jordan Stryke is attacked by Madame Hydra who kills Stryke and takes the name \\"Viper\\". Years later Jordan Stryke reappears alive without any explanation of how and takes control of the Serpent Society. Stryke reorganizes the Society into Serpent Solutions. Publication history The first known Viper (Jordan Stryke, also known as Jordan Dixon) was created by Steve Englehart, Steve Gerber, Sal Buscema and John Verpoorten and first appeared in Captain America #157 (January 1973). Fictional character biography =Jordan Stryke= Jordan Stryke (a.k.a. Jordan Dixon) was the brother of Leopold Stryke, also known as the costumed criminal Eel. They each formed costumed identities without the other realizing this fact. Viper concealed this fact by using the alias of \\"Dixon\\" as his everyday last name. Together they joined the Crime Wave of the Cowled Commander, and the Viper battled the Falcon and Captain America. During the course of the fight, Viper managed to poison his opponents with darts and escaped. Later, the Falcon discovered the Viper in his home after tracking his alias (through an offhand comment made by the Viper indicating that he was involved in advertising) and captured him. Escaping in an ensuing battle with Plantman and the rest of the Crime Wave, Viper‚Äôs identity was discovered by his brother Eel. Soon after, the Crime Wave was defeated by Captain America and the Falcon, and they were sent to prison. Later escaping prison with his brother and the help of the Cobra, the trio formed the original Serpent Squad and attacked Captain America at his girlfriend's home in Virginia. Despite new weapons added to his arsenal, including the Venom-Firer and prosthetic fangs, the Viper and his partners were returned to jail. While in custody, he was being taken to appear before a grand jury by U.S. Marshals. The van he was transported in was attacked by Madame Hydra, and his guards were killed. Believing himself rescued by his Serpent Squad, Viper rushed out of the van, only to be told by Madame Hydra that she wanted a new name ‚Äì his name.

Very intelligent, he is a skilled debater and advertiser, and he is skilled enough in chemistry to create his own special form of venom. He wears venom-tipped claws and employs venom-tipped darts. The third Viper possessed great physical strength but was lacking in hand-to-hand combat skills. In battles with both the Steve Rogers and Bucky versions of Captain America, he was taken out easily by a kick to the head. He used a wrist blaster that could fire poison darts. Other versions During the 2017 Secret Wars storyline, the Battleworld domain of the Hydra Empire has a group called the Vipers who work for Hydra. They are a group of female assassins that wear Hydra's version of the Symbiotes on their bodies and are led by Venom who sports the same type of Symbiote as the Vipers. The Vipers first appeared with Venom where they attacked the Resistance. While most of the Resistance was killed in the ensuing battle, Venom managed to infect Captain America and Sharon Carter's daughter Ellie Rogers with a Symbiote which slowly started to turn her into a Viper.Hail Hydra #2.

The book has found many readers among followers of alternative culture, and discusses the effect of certain psychoactive substances and how these affect the brain, tantric breathing techniques, and other methods and holistic approaches to expanding consciousness. It draws a parallel between the development of one's mind and the development of higher intelligence theorized by biological evolution.

An introduction by Israel Regardie was included.  Influence on other works  A brief comment made by Wilson in the book became the main seed thought for The Sekhmet Hypothesis. Wilson suggested that the gentle angel symbol from Ezekiel in the bible had its modern correlation with the flower child of the Sixties. The author of The Sekhmet Hypothesis, Iain Spence, went on to compare Ezekiel's other symbols to various pop cultural trends. In Prometheus Rising, Wilson compared the four Life Positions of Transactional Analysis to the four main Life Positions presented in Timothy Leary's earlier interpersonal circumplex grid. Spence favored Leary's model and used it to describe the moods of atavistic pop culture. Prometheus Rising is listed as one of the ten seminal works of extropian thought in the Extropianism FAQ. It was also listed on Max More's reading list for extropians, the Immortality Institute's reading list in The Scientific Conquest of Death, and other reading lists for extropians and transhumans.

The river flows west from a rugged portion of the central Sierra Nevada into the Central Valley and ultimately the Sacramento‚ÄìSan Joaquin River Delta, where it empties into the San Joaquin River-Stockton Deepwater Shipping Channel. Together with its main tributary, the Cosumnes River, the Mokelumne drains in parts of five California counties. Measured to its farthest source at the head of the North Fork, the river stretches for . The river is colloquially divided into the Upper Mokelumne River, which stretches from the headwaters to Pardee Reservoir in the Sierra foothills, and the Lower Mokelumne River, which refers to the portion of the river below Camanche Dam. In its lower course, the Mokelumne is used heavily for irrigation and also provides water for the east San Francisco Bay Area through the Mokelumne Aqueduct. Several major tributaries of the river have been developed for the generation of hydroelectric power. The name is Plains Miwok and is constructed from moke, meaning fishnet, and -umne, a suffix meaning \\"people of\\".Bright, William (1998). 1500 California Place Names: their origin and meaning. University of California Press; Berkeley, California, 1998. . The town of Mokelumne Hill was named for the river in about 1850. Course The Mokelumne is formed by the confluence of several forks that rise in the central Sierra Nevada in the Stanislaus National Forest. The North Fork is the largest, originating at Highland Lakes at an elevation of . From its source it flows north then west for to Salt Springs Reservoir. Below Salt Springs it receives the Bear River from the north and then passes through the smaller Tiger Creek Reservoir before joining with the Middle Fork southeast of Pine Grove. The lower portion of the North Fork defines the border between Amador and Calaveras Counties. The Middle Fork rises at on the west side of Bailey Ridge, near Ganns. It flows generally west, past Wilseyville and West Point, to its confluence with the North Fork. The South Fork begins at an elevation of very near the head of the Middle Fork, and flows west , roughly parallel and south of the Middle Fork, to join the Middle Fork about above the confluence of the North and Middle Forks. The confluence of the North and Middle Forks forms the Mokelumne River proper. The main stem flows west- southwest past Mokelumne Hill into Pardee Reservoir, formed by the -high Pardee Dam. Below Pardee the river flows directly into Camanche Reservoir, formed by Camanche Dam. The entire stretch of the Mokelumne between the forks and a point just above Camanche Dam defines the Amador‚ÄîCalaveras county line; below here, it flows westwards into San Joaquin County. The Camanche Dam is the first non-passable barrier for anadromous fish. Below Camanche Dam the Mokelumne meanders to its confluence with the San Joaquin River, first continuing southwest out of the Sierra foothills past Lockeford and then turning northwest at Lodi, where the small Woodbridge Dam impounds the river, forming Lodi Lake. The river receives Dry Creek from the east near Thornton and shortly afterwards receives its major tributary, the Cosumnes River, from the northeast. At this point, the river has reached its northernmost point about south of Sacramento. The river continues west then south into the Sacramento‚ÄìSan Joaquin River Delta where it becomes tidal and splits into a pair of distributaries, the North and South Mokelumne River (not to be confused with the North and South Forks in the Mokelumne headwaters) which together encircle the of Staten Island. About downstream the branches rejoin, and two miles (3.2 km) below this point the Mokelumne flows into the San Joaquin River. Watershed The Mokelumne Wilderness, in the headwaters of the Mokelumne River The Mokelumne River watershed drains in parts of Alpine, Amador, Calaveras, San Joaquin, and Sacramento Counties. Elevations range from sea level at the confluence with the San Joaquin River to at the crest of the Sierra Nevada in the headwaters of the North Fork. The Mokelumne watershed divide borders the basins of the American River on the north, the Calaveras and Stanislaus rivers to the south, and the Carson River to the east. The American, Calaveras and Stanislaus rivers, like the Mokelumne, drain westwards into the Central Valley, while the Carson flows eastwards into the Great Basin. Drainage within the Mokelumne watershed generally occurs from east to west with all of the perennial streams originating in the Sierra Nevada. The Mokelumne River and its headwater forks above Lodi drain the southernmost part of the basin. The part of the basin above Pardee Dam is referred to as the Upper Mokelumne River Basin and drains about , or 25.7% of the total watershed. The Cosumnes River and its own North, Middle and South forks drain about in the northern part of the basin, or about 33.8% of the total watershed. Dry Creek, which itself is formed by four Sierra streams ‚Äì Jackson, Sutter, Amador and Rancheria Creeks ‚Äì drains most of the area between the upper Mokelumne and Cosumnes basins, or about . The upper watershed is situated principally in Alpine, Amador and Calaveras Counties and consists mostly of wilderness managed under various federal designations. Most of the Mokelumne and Cosumnes River headwaters lie within the Stanislaus and Eldorado National Forests. Much of the upper watershed is also protected under the Mokelumne Wilderness. The Salt Springs State Game Refuge is located along the Mokelumne River near Salt Springs Reservoir. There are also significant private holdings in the upper basin including commercial timber land and protected watershed areas administered by the East Bay Municipal Utility District, which diverts urban and industrial water from Pardee Reservoir. The lower watershed, mainly within San Joaquin and Sacramento Counties, is part of the rich agricultural region of the Central Valley. Grapes are the major crop grown in the Mokelumne River watershed; as of 2001, vineyards comprised 51% of the basin's farmland. Of the remaining land, 31% is used for livestock, 9% for orchards, and 8% for annual crops.http://www.sjcrcd.org/articles/MokP04.pdf About in the lower basin are part of the Mokelumne River AVA. History Panning for gold on the Mokelumne River The Mokelumne River basin was originally inhabited by Yokuts, Miwok, and Wintun Native American people. The lower (western) basin was the most densely populated, with numerous villages between the fringe of the Sierra foothills and the eastern edge of the Sacramento‚ÄìSan Joaquin Delta. This area is believed to have been predominantly Plains Miwok; various subgroups that lived in the Mokelumne River basin included the Mokellos, Lalas, and Machacos. The Miwoks called the river Wakalumitch, possibly meaning \\"big river\\".http://www.sjcrcd.org/articles/MokP08.pdf The first European parties to explore the river were likely Spanish military expeditions in Alta California in the late 18th or early 19th century. The name Mokelumne was first recorded by Spanish missionary Narciso Dur√°n as Muquelumnes in 1817. However it was not until 1830 when the first permanent European settlement was established on the Mokelumne River, at Happy Valley near present-day Mokelumne Hill, as an outpost for French fur trappers.http://www.calaverashistory.org/mokelumne-hill John C. Fr√©mont is credited with establishing the modern spelling of the name Mokelumne circa 1844. \\"Mokelumne\\" in the Yokuts language is believed to mean \\"Condor River\\". During the California Gold Rush, the Mokelumne was a major gold-producing stream. The first person to discover gold in the Mokelumne was likely Charles Weber in 1848. Weber did not stay in the area for long; he moved on to the Coloma diggings on the South Fork American River before establishing a supply center at present-day Stockton, several miles south of the Mokelumne River. Most of the Gold Rush profits and trade on the Mokelumne River would end up passing through Stockton. Also in 1848, Samuel W. Pearsall found gold at Mokelumne Hill, which by 1850 grew into a boomtown of 15,000 people.http://mygoldrushtales.com/early-gold-rush-fortunes-by-the-mokelumne- river/  Recreational uses  Rapids west of Highway 49, part of the Electra- Middle Bar Class II-III whitewater kayaking run The Mokelumne River is home to five notable whitewater kayaking runs: Fantasy Falls, Devil's Nose, Tiger Creek Dam, Ponderosa and Electra-Middle Bar. Fantasy Falls, a Class V+, 26-mile wilderness reach, runs from below Highway 4 in Alpine County to the backwaters of Salt Springs Reservoir. Devil's Nose, Class IV-V, runs 17 miles from Salt Springs Dams to Tiger Creek Powerhouse. Below Tiger Creek Dam is the Tiger Creek Dam Whitewater run, a scenic, 3 mile Class IV run. The Ponderosa run goes from Ponderosa Way to Electra Powerhouse. The westernmost run is Electra-Middle Bar, a 5+-mile Class II-III run. It begins just below the Electra Powerhouse, passes under Highway 49 south of Jackson, CA and ends at the Middle Bar Bridge. The Mokelumne is also a popular site for fishing, camping, water play, birding, picnics, gold panning, spring wildflower watching, and other activities. Electra Road, just east of Highway 49, is a popular place to run, walk, and enjoy the river. The large granite domes, Calaveras Dome and Hammer Dome, near Salt Springs Reservoir, are popular for technical rock climbing. Three campgrounds are also located near Salt Springs: Mokelumne River, White Azalea, and Moore Creek. Above Salt Springs Reservoir, the Mokelumne Wilderness challenges those who seek a true wilderness experience. Backpacking in this federally designated wilderness area requires good back-country skills. Downstream, the river is also a popular recreational destination, particularly the day-use area at the base of the Camanche Dam, which includes the Mokelumne River Fish Hatchery, and Lodi Lake, a city park in the small town of Lodi. The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) has developed a safe eating advisory for Lower Mokelumne River based on levels of mercury or PCBs found in fish caught from this water body. River modifications The first diversions of the Mokelumne were made during the California Gold Rush in the mid-1850s to provide water for placer and hydraulic mining. The first irrigation scheme was organized by a local collective, the Mokelumne Ditch and Irrigation Company, in 1875, but their dam was demolished by a flood and never rebuilt. The Woodbridge Canal and Irrigation Company was founded in 1891, and was somewhat more successful at tapping Mokelumne River water, but they were still hampered by damaging spring floods and lack of water in the dry season. In 1929 the East Bay Municipal Utilities District (EBMUD) built the large Pardee Dam several miles upstream from Lodi and the irrigation diversion points on the Mokelumne River. Pardee is the primary storage facility and diversion point for the Mokelumne Aqueduct, which provides water to 35 municipalities in the eastern San Francisco Bay Area in Alameda and Contra Costa Counties. The first water deliveries to the Bay Area were made on June 23, 1929. The dam can store about which is slightly over one quarter of the Mokelumne's annual flow. Through an agreement between EBMUD and local farmers, Pardee also stabilized the dry season water level in the lower Mokelumne, allowing much greater use of the river for agriculture. The Mokelumne River's Camanche Reservoir seen from the air, with the dam to the west (left) As early as 1897, the Mokelumne was utilized for the generation of hydroelectric power at the Blue Lakes powerhouse, near Jackson, to provide power for local communities. Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E;) began to develop the river for hydroelectricity in the late 1800s. In 1925, the Mokelumne hydroelectric project was licensed, and its major dam, Salt Springs, was completed on the North Fork of the Mokelumne in 1931. The project also includes two dams on the Bear River, the Tiger Creek Dam, and several smaller reservoirs in the Mokelumne headwaters. The project can provide a maximum output of 206 megawatts of electricity from four powerhouses. In 1963 Camanche Dam was built directly below Pardee to capture additional Mokelumne River runoff. Its primary purpose is to provide flood control for downstream communities, which allows more water to be retained in Pardee Reservoir for the Bay Area's use. Camanche forms the largest reservoir on the Mokelumne with a capacity of . The dam regulates releases from Pardee for local uses, primarily irrigation, and provides flood control for the lower Mokelumne River. The dam is also operated by EBMUD. The Mokelumne River in the Delta forms part of the water pathway for the Central Valley Project and State Water Project, which divert Sacramento River water to a number of aqueducts that supply central and southern California. The Sacramento River is connected to the Mokelumne River by the Delta Cross Channel, which enables the large pump stations near Tracy to draw water south across the Delta via the Mokelumne, San Joaquin, Old River and Middle River. Ecology The lower Mokelumne River passing through Lodi, California The Mokelumne River provides habitat for Pacific salmon and steelhead trout spawning runs. These fish were historically able to migrate upstream of the present site of Pardee Dam, before a natural waterfall prevented further progress. Between 1950 and 1997 the annual fall chinook salmon run has had an estimated average of 3434 fish. The construction of Camanche Dam has blocked access to several miles of the highest quality habitat formerly available to salmonids in the Mokelumne River. To compensate for the lost habitat, the Mokelumne River Fish Hatchery was built in 1964, a year after the completion of Camanche Dam.http://www.dfg.ca.gov/fish/hatcheries/Mokelumne/Facility.asp The Lower Mokelumne River is home to at least 35 species of fish. In addition to salmon and trout, common native fish include prickly sculpin (Cottus asper), and Sacramento sucker (Catostomus occidentalis). The non-native western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis), largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) and bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) are also plentiful. The Cosumnes River, the Mokelumne's major tributary, is one of only a few Sierra rivers without large dams; however, irrigation diversions have also caused problems with fish migration on this river.http://www.fisheryfoundation.org/projects/current/CR_salmon_passage.html For water conservation reasons, local agriculture has switched from flood irrigation to drip and sprinkler systems, and thereby become more reliant on groundwater. This is an issue since the State of California currently does not consider groundwater recharge a beneficial use. North San Joaquin Water Conservation District has the authority to work on this but many other nearby water districts do not.  Recent conflicts  In its original 2040 long-range water plan, issued in 2009, the East Bay Municipal Utility District approved an optional expansion of Pardee Reservoir . The expansion would have flooded more than a mile of the river as well as unique cultural and historic sites. A broad coalition of local governments, conservation, recreation and fishery advocates opposed the reservoir expansion. Foothill Conservancy, Friends of the River and California Sportfishing Protection Alliance sued EBMUD in November 2009. In April 2011, Sacramento Superior Court Judge Timothy M. Frawley ruled in the groups' favor and voided the EBMUD plan. On December 5, 2011, East Bay Municipal Utility District announced that the soon-to-be released revised draft environmental impact report for its revised water plan would not recommend the controversial reservoir expansion.http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2011/12/05/18701836.php On April 24, 2012, the utility's board voted 7-0 to remove the Pardee expansion from its 2040 water plan.http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2012/04/27/18712234.php  Conservation and restoration  CA-26 bridge near West Point, included in SB 1199 In 1999, federal and state agencies joined nonprofit organizations and PG&E; in signing a settlement agreement for the new Federal Energy Regulatory Commission license of PG&E;'s hydroelectric project on the Mokelumne, known as Project 137.http://www.foothillconservancy.org/pages/focus2.cgi?magid=4&magiid;=57 The agreement requires flows from the hydroelectric project to follow the natural hydrograph of the river, required the removal or dismantling of three small dams on tributary streams, improved recreational flows and facilities on the river, and incorporated an adaptive management plan with a monitoring program. The removal of West Panther Creek Dam in 2003http://www.foothillconservancy.org/pages/focus1.cgi?magid=7&magiid;=116 was the first removal of a PG&E; dam in modern history. Since the signing of the settlement and issuance of the FERC license, the signatories have collaboratively managed the project's adaptive management and monitoring program. About 37 miles of the Mokelumne from Salt Springs Powerhouse to just below Highway 49 have been found eligible for National Wild and Scenic River designation by the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management as part of those agencies' land management planning responsibilities. In 2014, Sen. Loni Hancock (D-Oakland) introduced Senate Bill 1199 in the California State Senate to designate the river as Wild and Scenic from Salt Springs to Pardee Reservoir. The legislation was co-sponsored by Foothill Conservancy and Friends of the River, and supported by Calaveras County and a number of conservation, fish, community and tribal groups. It was opposed by Amador County and local water agencies. The East Bay Municipal Utility District initially opposed the bill but supported it with proposed author's amendments late in the legislative process. SB 1199 was passed by the Senate but stalled in the State Assembly, where it was held \\"in suspense\\" by the Appropriations Committee after approval by the Natural Resources Committee.http://www.foothillconservancy.org/pages/statewild.cgi In 2015, California Assemblyman Frank Bigelow (R-O'Neals) and Senator Tom Berryhill (R-Twain Harte) co-sponsored state legislation, Assembly Bill 142, which called for completion of a state study before the Mokelumne could be designated a California Wild and Scenic River. After a number of amendments were made to the bill, it was adopted by the Legislature and signed into law by Governor Jerry Brown. The bill mandated a state wild and scenic river suitability study of the Mokelumne and provided interim protections for the river from Salt Springs Dam to Pardee Reservoir. The compromise bill was supported by Sierra foothill water agencies, the East Bay Municipal Utility District and river and fish conservation groups.http://www.foothillconservancy.org/pages/focus3.cgi?magicatid=&magi;_detail=747&magid;=53 In January 2018, the California Natural Resources Agency released its draft Mokelumne River Wild and Scenic River Study. The study was finalized after extensive, overwhelmingly positive, public comments and with support for final recommendation language from Mokelumne-dependent water agencies, Amador and Calaveras counties, and conservation groups. The final report, issued in April 2018, recommended adding approximately 37 miles of the North Fork and main Mokelumne to the California Wild and Scenic Rivers System. The report's recommendation was incorporated into the natural resources budget trailer bill, Senate Bill 854, which was passed by the state legislature. The bill was signed into law by Governor Jerry Brown on June 27, 2018. The enactment of the legislation makes the Mokelumne the 15th river included in the California Wild and Scenic Rivers System. In 2014, Foothill Conservancy, other conservation and fish organizations, and federal and state agencies formed a working group to explore restoring salmon and steelhead above Camanche and Pardee reservoirs.http://www.foothillconservancy.org/page/?page=97 The group's work is in progress.

It is commonly worn by paramilitaries and militaries around the world, particularly armored forces such as the British Army's Royal Tank Regiment (RTR), the Royal Canadian Armoured Corps (RCAC), and the Royal Australian Armoured Corps (RAAC). Notable non-armored military units to wear the black beret include the Russian Naval Infantry (and formerly Soviet) and Russian OMON units, the United States Air Force (USAF) Tactical Air Control Party (TACP), Philippine National Police-Special Action Force (PNP-SAF) members, and the Royal Canadian Navy (\\"navy blue\\"). It was also worn by the United Kingdom's Royal Observer Corps (ROC) with their Royal Air Force (RAF) uniform, Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA). Black berets are also worn by navies. In some navies, the naval color called black is officially \\"very dark blue\\". The Dutch Navy and Marines wear dark navy blue berets; a silver anchor for the Navy and a gold or dark brown (field duty) anchor on a red background for the Marines. The Portuguese Marines and San Marco Regiment, the Marines of the Italian Navy also wear a dark blue beret. The Royal Norwegian Air Force also use a dark blue beret. Finnish Marine Infantry wear a dark blue beret with the Navy insignia.(Finnish Coastal Jaegers - marine commandos - part of the same Nylands Brigade, wear the green beret). Perhaps the most famous Commonwealth wearer of the black beret was Field Marshal Montgomery who wore a Royal Tank Regiment (RTR) beret complete with cap badge, presented to him by the regiment, to which he added his own general's (later field marshal's) rank insignia. History The black beret has its origins with the French 70th Chasseurs Alpins who influenced the British Royal Tank Corps beginning in 1918. General Sir Hugh Jamieson Elles, together with Colonel Fuller came up with the idea of a black beret for the Royal Tank Corps. Black was selected as the colour because it was least likely to show oil stains, something which tank crewmen of that time (and now) could appreciate. It was approved for wear with the Royal Tank Corps by HM King George V on 5 March 1924. The black beret remained the exclusive distinctive headdress of the Royal Tank Corps in 1940.http://www.australian-armour.com/Black%20Beret.html , When uniforms were issued to the Royal Observer Corps there was a surplus of Royal Armoured Corps black berets that were given to the unit. Usage by country =Argentina= The Argentine Navy's Batall√≥n de Infanter√≠a de Marina 5 (5th Marine Battalion), of Falklands War Mount Tumbledown fame (1982), wears a black beret.

U.S. Army  In 1973, permission was granted to local commanders to encourage distinctive, morale-enhancing uniform items and the black beret was adopted by armor and armored cavalry units in the United States. A black beret was authorized for wear by female soldiers in 1975.p.223 Stanton, Shelby U.S. Army Uniforms of the Cold War 1948‚Äì1973 1994 Stackpole Books On January 30, 1975, it was officially assigned as part of the newly created battalions of United States Army Rangers who had worn it unofficially during the Vietnam War. In 1979, the U.S. Army Chief of Staff ruled that the black beret was restricted to just ranger and airborne units (the latter receiving their distinctive maroon berets on November 28, 1980). However, since June 14, 2001, the black beret is worn by all United States Army troops unless the soldier is approved to wear a different distinctive beret. The Rangers now wear tan berets in reverence to the buckskins worn by Rogers' Rangers during the French and Indian War. The black beret is worn as part of the Army Service Uniform (ASU), the U.S. Army's dress uniform. It also became the official garrison headgear to be worn with the Battle Dress Uniform (BDUs) in 2001, and from 2005 the Army Combat Uniform (ACU). The change was implemented by General Eric Shinseki, the Army Chief of Staff at the time, who stated that it was about promoting \\"...our values as an institution.\\" From the beginning, the beret was unpopular with soldiers, because the headgear required two hands to put it on, could not be carried in the pocket when not worn (as the patrol cap could), and provided no shade from the sun (again unlike the patrol cap). Despite years of negative feedback, the beret remained part of the ACU until 2011, when incoming Sergeant Major of the Army Raymond F. Chandler made it his first order of business to address the wishes \\"thousands of soldiers\\" who wanted the army to end the wear of the beret with the ACU, and the army subsequently did just that. The black beret remained the headgear for the ASU, but was replaced as the default headgear with the ACU patrol cap.  U.S. Navy  During the Vietnam War the U.S. Navy personnel assigned to patrol boats wore the South Vietnamese navy black beret with badge. Unit tradition had the back ribbon cut into two pennants after first contact with the enemy with the ends of the pennant notched in a \\"V\\" to signify he had made an enemy \\"kill\\".Cutler, Thomas J.

Property can be considered lost, mislaid or abandoned depending on the circumstances under which it is found by the next party who obtains its possession. There is an old saying that possession is nine-tenths of the law, perhaps dating back centuries. This means that in most cases, the possessor of a piece of property is its rightful owner without evidence to the contrary. More colloquially, this may be called finders, keepers. The contradiction to this principle is theft by finding, which may occur if conversion occurs after finding someone else's property. The rights of a finder of such property are determined in part by the status in which it is found. Because these classifications have developed under the common law of England, they turn on nuanced distinctions. The general rule attaching to the three types of property may be summarized as: A finder of property acquires no rights in mislaid property, is entitled to possession of lost property against everyone except the true owner, and is entitled to keep abandoned property.Michael v. First Chicago Corp., 139 Ill. App. 3d 374, 382, 487 N.E.2d 403, 409 (1985) This rule varies by jurisdiction.Jesse Dukeminier and James E. Krier, Property, Fifth Edition, Aspen Law & Business (New York, 2002), p. 120. Lost property Property is generally deemed to have been lost if it is found in a place where the true owner likely did not intend to set it down, and where it is not likely to be found by the true owner. At common law, the finder of a lost item could claim the right to possess the item against any person except the true owner or any previous possessors.Armory v. Delamirie, 1 Strange 505 (King‚Äôs Bench, 1722) The underlying policy goals to these distinctions are to (hopefully) see that the property is returned to its true original owner, or \\"title owner.\\" Most jurisdictions have now enacted statutes requiring that the finder of lost property turn it in to the proper authorities; if the true owner does not arrive to claim the property within a certain period of time (this is defined by the Torts Act 1977 as 3 months from the date of finding), the property is returned to the finder as his own, or is disposed of.Jesse Dukeminier and James E. Krier, Property, Fifth Edition, Aspen Law & Business (New York, 2002), p. 123-24. In Britain, many public businesses have a dedicated Lost Property Office (LPO), which in the United States would be called a lost and found, where lost property can be reported and reclaimed free of charge. Many exceptions may be applied at common law to the rule that the first finder of lost property has a superior claim of right over any other person except the previous owner. For example, a trespasser's claim to lost property which he finds while trespassing is generally inferior to the claim of the respective landowner. As a corollary to this exception, a landowner has superior claim over a find made within the non-public areas of his property, so if a customer finds lost property in the public area of a store, the customer has superior claim to the lost property over that of the store-owner, but if the customer finds the lost property in the non-public area of that store, such as an area marked \\"Employees Only,\\" the store-owner will have superior claim, as the customer was trespassing when he found it.Bridges v. Hawkesworth, (1851) The status of finders as employees or tenants of the landowner complicates matters, because employees and tenants have legitimate access to non-public areas of a landowner's property that others would not, without trespassing. Employees and tenants, however, still usually lose superior claim over lost property to their employers or landlords if the property is found within the scope of their employment, or outside the actual leased area, respectively.Jesse Dukeminier and James E. Krier, Property, Fifth Edition, Aspen Law & Business (New York, 2002), p. 120-123. For example, if the lost property is found by a tenant inside the walls of his leasehold, or by an employee embedded within the soil of an estate owned by his employer, the landowner (as employer or landlord) of the property where it was found usually has a superior claim of right over that of the finder. However, this is not always the case, as a long-term tenant who finds lost property within the leased area of his leasehold may have a superior claim over that of his landlord (especially if the landlord has never been to the property). While employers usually have a superior claim over lost property found by their employees, exceptions to this exist as well, as modern law sometimes grants the employee superior claim if turning over lost property to his employer is not part of his job description (such as if the employee is an interior decorator).Erickson v. Sinykin, 26 N.W.2d 172 (Minn. 1947) =Animals= Since animals are mobile and are thus capable of becoming lost on their own, the loss of property that is a valuable animal has its own set of rules. A valuable animal that becomes lost usually does so by leaving its owner's real property and arriving on another property owner's land; such an animal is legally termed an estray. Estrays are normally confined to domesticated animals, like livestock, and not wild animals. Since common pets are not considered valuable animals, dogs and cats are never considered estrays. In many jurisdictions of the U.S., a person who discovers an estray will be required to file an affidavit of estray, along with its description, and potentially impound that animal in some way for a period of time. If the estray is branded, the owner can often be identified immediately. The owner of the estray will generally have a limited time frame in which to reclaim his property after a notice of estray is published, but on the expiration of such time another person or entity will be designated the new title owner of the property. Fees for impounding the estray will often accumulate which the property owner will be responsible for paying. The status of a stray domestic animal (for example, a feral cat or a free-ranging dog) is highly dependent on local jurisdictions. Given the significant number of feral dogs and cats, the finder of a lost dog or cat may have little or no restrictions to claiming the animal as his own property. =Slaves= Like animals, fugitive slaves in the United States (runaway slaves) were a type of property that was capable of relocating to other places. Slave owners depended on others to identify and return their property; some slaves would be branded if a slave was known to run away. Numerous laws in the U.S., like the Fugitive Slave Clause of the Constitution of 1789, the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793, and the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 all stipulated that the slaves be captured and returned to their owner. These laws, now superseded by Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution of 1865, were demanded by the Southern States of the U.S. but were actively opposed in most Northern states. Activists against slavery and the fugitive slave laws, such as members of the Underground Railroad, routinely violated the laws and refused to return slaves to their owners. Of the 5 laws agreed upon in the Compromise of 1850, the fugitive slave laws were by far the most contentious, although many of the issues were split along regional lines with Northerners and Southerners diametrically opposed. In Harriet Beecher Stowe's 1852 novel Uncle Tom's Cabin, the issue of runaway slaves was a central theme. These property and fugitive slave issues, along with other events related to slavery, would propel the U.S. into civil war. =Unclaimed property= Unclaimed property laws in the United States provide for two reporting periods each year whereby unclaimed bank accounts, stocks, insurance proceeds, utility deposits, un-cashed checks and other forms of \\"personal property\\" are reported first to the individual state's Unclaimed Property Office, then published in a local newspaper and then finally the property is turned over to the State for safe keeping until its rightful owner makes a claim. The states sponsor a free public site that reports only a portion of the unclaimed property available in the United States. There are commercial sites as well that provide the same information or portions of the information for a fee. Some consumer reporting sites that conduct the research and assist consumers will do so without charge or expense to the consumers. In Australia, unclaimed money laws provide a one to two year reporting period each year whereby unclaimed bank accounts, superannuation, deceased estate inheritances, insurance, shares, dividends, utility deposits, unpresented cheques and other forms of \\"unclaimed money\\" are reported to the appropriate governing body under which the organisation holding the money falls under. This can include states in Australia or the Commonwealth. Money is unclaimed money if it is money whose owners is not identifiable. Owners of unclaimed money can apply to the governing body where the unclaimed money is being held, however, in some cases, the owner is required to go back to the organisation who lodged the money as unclaimed. Unclaimed Money Professionals or Unclaimed Money Agents also can assist owners to claim back their unclaimed money. Due to the strict requirements to claim unclaimed money back in Australia, people may need the assistance of a professional or licensed private investigator to locate support documents for their claim of payment. Mislaid property Property is generally deemed to have been mislaid or misplaced if it is found in a place where the true owner likely did intend to set it, but then simply forgot to pick it up again. For example, a wallet found in a shop lying on a counter near a cash register will likely be deemed misplaced rather than lost. Under common law principles, the finder of a misplaced object has a duty to turn it over to the owner of the premises, on the theory that the true owner is likely to return to that location to search for his misplaced item. If the true owner does not return within a reasonable time (which varies considerably depending on the circumstances), the property becomes that of the owner of the premises.McAvoy v. Medina, 93 Mass. (11 Allen) 548, (1866)  Abandoned property  Maui Police Department sticker affixed to abandoned cars. Property is generally deemed to have been abandoned if it is found in a place where the true owner likely intended to leave it, but is in such a condition that it is apparent that he or she has no intention of returning to claim it. Abandoned property generally becomes the property of whoever should find it and take possession of it first, although some states have enacted statutes under which certain kinds of abandoned propertyusually cars, wrecked ships and wrecked aircraftescheat, meaning that they become the property of the state.Eads v. Brazelton, 22 Ark. 499 (Ark. 1861) In the United States, property left behind by a tenant is generally presumed abandoned after anywhere from 1 week to 1 year, and if unclaimed, may be disposed of or sold to recoup storage costs; in some states the difference may be kept by the landlord, in others returned to the tenant, and in others it must be turned over to the state or county. Virginia requires only 24 hour storage for evictions. Maryland allows individual counties to set required storage times. Colorado allows immediate disposal (but not sale), while Georgia and Texas allow it to be immediately placed outside and claimed by anyone, and Arkansas allows the landlord to immediately claim the property for themselves to do as they wish. =Treasure trove= Treasure trove is property that consists of coins or currency hidden by the owner. To be considered treasure trove and not mislaid property, the property must have been deliberately hidden or concealed, and sufficiently long ago that the original owner can be considered dead or not discoverable. For example, under historic English law, one hundred Roman coins found buried in a pot would have been treasure trove whilst one hundred Roman coins which were lost over time in a marketplace would not have been treasure trove, as they were not deliberately hidden as a single hoard. However, the law of treasure trove has now been replaced by the Treasure Act under which this distinction between lost and deposited items does not generally apply. Under American common law, treasure trove belongs to the finder unless the original owner reclaims. Some states have rejected the American common law and hold that treasure trove belongs to the owner of the property in which the treasure trove was found. These courts reason that the American common law rule encourages trespass. Under the traditional English common law, treasure trove belongs to the Crown, though the finder may be paid a reward.  Recent developments  In the United States, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws sought to address the problems arising from these types of property through provisions of the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act. The act was first drafted and promulgated in 1981 and a revised version, the Revised Uniform Unclaimed Property Act was introduced in 1995. The act specifically focuses on the problem of unclaimed money in bank accounts and corporate coffers, and the corresponding escheatment. In July 2016, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws revisited the 1995 version of the Uniform Act again and ultimately passed the Revised Uniform Unclaimed Property Act (RUUPA) of 2016. As of September 2020, only five states have enacted a version of a law inspired by the RUUPA: Tennessee, Kentucky, Utah, Colorado, and Vermont. Other states have adopted similar laws but with significant deviations from the RUUPA. https://www.uniformlaws.org/committees/community- home?communitykey=4b7c796a-f158-47bc-b5b1-f3f9a6e404fa&tab;=groupdetails As a result of the Act, each state that has adopted the act operates an Unclaimed Property fund in which the proceeds from abandoned bank accounts, unpresented checks, etc. are to be turned over to the state after a specified period of time. Depending on state law, the money may be held either in perpetuity (i.e., the funds never escheat to the state; an example would be TexasTexas Comptroller of Public Accounts general information on unclaimed money.), or after a long period of time (whereby it is presumed that the owner is deceased with no heirs) the funds will escheat to the state. Due to the increasing mobility of the population, 39 states have joined together to operate MissingMoney.com, a searchable database which lists unclaimed funds in these states. Another website at Unclaimed.org allows searches without charge for the remaining 11 states. Many commercial websites also offer this service at a charge. A searchable database for unclaimed money and property is available in Canada from the Bank of Canada. A similar problem has developed with respect to orphan works, artistic or literary works for which a copyright is in effect, but for whom the copyright owner cannot be found.Jon W. Bruce and James W. Ely Jr., Cases and Materials on Modern Property Law, West Group (St. Paul MN, 2003) p. 152.

Life and career Carter was born in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, New York, in 1922 to a Jewish family. Carter served in the United States Army Air Corps during World War II. He hosted an early television variety program called Cavalcade of Stars on the DuMont Network. He was lured to NBC to host his own program titled The Jack Carter Show. Carter recommended Jackie Gleason take his place as host of Cavalcade of Stars, though DuMont did not hire Gleason until the network's choice, Jerry Lester, also jumped to NBC. The Jack Carter Show appeared under the banner of the Saturday Night Revue, NBC's 2 1/2 hour Saturday night programming slot. Carter hosted his show for one hour each week followed by the 90-minute Your Show of Shows starring Sid Caesar, Imogene Coca, Carl Reiner, and Howard Morris. Carter remained friends with Sid Caesar his entire life and delivered the eulogy at his funeral. His only major Broadway appearance was opposite Sammy Davis, Jr. in the 1956 musical Mr. Wonderful. He earlier replaced Phil Silvers in the Broadway show Top Banana. He was a frequent guest on The Ed Sullivan Show during the 1960s and early 1970s, and was known for his impression of Ed Sullivan.

Marsh was born at Hannington, Wiltshire and was educated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford. He later became a fellow of Exeter College, Oxford, in 1658. In 1662 he was ordained, and presented to the living of Swindon, which he resigned in the following year. After acting as chaplain to Seth Ward, Bishop of Exeter and then Bishop of Salisbury, and Lord Chancellor Clarendon, he was elected principal of St Alban Hall, Oxford, in 1673. In 1679 he was appointed Provost of Trinity College Dublin, where he did much to encourage the study of the Irish language. He helped to found the Dublin Philosophical Society, and contributed to it a paper entitled Introductory Essay to the Doctrine of Sounds (printed in Philosophical Transactions, No. 156, Oxford, 1684). In 1683 he was consecrated Bishop of Ferns and Leighlin, but after the accession of James II he was compelled by the turbulent soldiery to flee to England (1689), when he became Vicar of Gresford, Flintshire, and Canon of St. Asaph. Returning to Ireland in 1691 after the Battle of the Boyne, he was made Archbishop of Cashel, and three years later he became Archbishop of Dublin. About this time he founded Marsh's Library in Dublin. Many oriental manuscripts belonging to him are now in the Bodleian Library in Oxford. He became Archbishop of Armagh in 1703. Between 1699 and 1711 he was six times a Lord Justice of Ireland. He died on 2 November 1713. His funeral oration was pronounced by his successor at Dublin, Archbishop King.

It was the follow-up to the band's triple-platinum God Shuffled His Feet. By February 1999, A Worm's Life had sold more than 1 million copies worldwide. Background After the band finished touring their hit album God Shuffled His Feet, frontman Brad Roberts spent considerable time traveling abroad, relocating to London, England at the time to escape the pressures of fame and celebrity where, because they didn't get MTV Europe, no one recognized him there \\"except German and Italian tourists.\\" During his travels, Roberts began penning new material. Though he briefly visited New York City, most of the material he had written was outside North America, including one notable stay in Prague, Czech Republic. Finally, after having compiled much written material, Roberts reconvened with the rest of the band at Compass Point Studios in The Bahamas in the winter of 1995 to begin recording the follow-up to God Shuffled His Feet. As a departure from the recording sessions of their first two records, the band decided to self- produce A Worm's Life. Pursuing a more guitar-heavy sound, the band drafted acclaimed music producer and recording engineer Terry Manning to engineer the record. The band's producer, Jeff Rogers, noted: \\"Terry has got a guitar collection to rival Randy Bachman's. And Brad got to play every one of them on the record.\\" Roberts had claimed on record that A Worm's Life \\"does go a little further than the other ones in terms of odd melodies, wacky key signatures, and chord changes.\\" while continuing to adopt a lyrical approach that looks \\"at simple things in unusual ways rather than the other way around.\\" Release The album was originally planned for release on August 28, 1996. However, the release date would later be moved back to October 2, 1996, with BMG Canada citing the need for \\"more set-up time\\". Originally \\"Overachievers\\" was planned as the album's lead single (then titled \\"The Over- Achievers\\"), with the band's producer Jeff Rogers even noting at the time that the band had contacted three different directors for music video concepts to complement that track's release. However, \\"He Liked to Feel It\\" would later replace \\"Overachievers\\" as the lead single as the album's release date drew closer. \\"He Liked to Feel It\\" proved to be a hit in the band's native Canada, becoming their highest-peaking career single at #2 on the Canadian singles chart. Despite the single's success domestically, \\"He Liked to Feel It\\" made minimal chart impact abroad, perhaps due to controversy surrounding the track's music video hindering its promotional efforts. A second single, \\"My Own Sunrise\\", would follow in January 1997, becoming a minor hit for the band, with \\"My Enemies\\" following as the album's third and final single later that year, also making limited impact. A Worm's Life enjoyed strong initial sales in Canada; achieving a platinum certification less than one month after its release date. However, the album sold disappointingly elsewhere, and would have a considerably shorter chart life compared to its predecessor God Shuffled His Feet in Canada.

Allmusic writer Darryl Cater gave the album 2 out of 5 stars and states that the album \\"finds singer-songwriter Brad Roberts rummaging through his repetroire in a futile search for a new idea. His glossy pop hooks seem to run over and over again into tunes he's already written. When Roberts isn't doing that routine, he's trying in vain to fit wordy lyrics into memorable melodies.

Brittany, Limousin, Gascony, Corsica and Auvergne were among the regions that experienced a notable resurgence in the popularity of folk music. Traditional styles of music had survived most in remote areas, such as the island of Corsica and mountainous Auvergne, as well as the more nationalist lands of the Basques and Bretons. In many cases, folk traditions were revived in relatively recent years to cater to tourists. These groupes folkloriques tend to focus on very early 20th century melodies and the use of the piano accordion. Folk music and dance now has an established place as a popular pastime in its own right with innumerable festivals, concerts and bals folks across France and a number of regular publications devoted to it. Auvergne Auvergne is known for cabrette bagpipes. The cabrette (little goat in Auvergnat) is a bagpipe made of goatskin (goats being an integral part of Auvergnat traditional life) and without drones, blown by elbow-driven bellows. Some famous old players : Martin Cayla, Jean Bergheaud, Marcel Bernard, Antoine Bouscatel, Joseph Costeroste, Georges Soule, and some modern players: Dominique Paris, Victor Laroussinie, Didier Pauvert, St√©phane Charpentier, Michel Esbelin, Fran√ßois Lazarevic. They play both regrets (slow airs), bourr√©es (typical auvergne danse) and swift, 3/8 dance music. Joseph Canteloube was a well-known composer from Auvergne in the early 20th century, and produced a famous collection of folk music called Songs of the Auvergne. B√©arn Angel playing the string drum B√©arn's revivalist scene has been quite limited in scope, though it has produced the nationally renowned singer Marilis Orionaa. Traditional instruments from the area include the tambour de B√©arn, a six-string drum used as a rhythm drone instrument to accompany the three-holed recorder. Brittany Corsica Gascony One of the biggest stars of the French roots revival was Perlinpinpin Folc, formed in 1972 and led by Christian Lanau, whose Musique Traditionelle de Gascogne was a popular release that sparked interest in the traditional music of Gascony. Gascon small pipes, called boha (bouhe), are a well-known part of the local scene. They have a rectangular chanter and drone combination, which is unique to Gascony, and are made out of sheepskin with the fleece showing. Languedoc Languedoc is home to several unusual instruments, including the bodega, a kind of bagpipe, and the abo√®s and graille, both kinds of oboes. The bodega is made out of goatskin, using an unusual process in which the innards of the animal are removed through the neck so that the entire, unbroken skin can be used for the instrument. It has only one large shoulder drone. The bodega is known from at least the 14th century. Popular traditional groups from Languedoc include Calabrun, Trencavel, Laurent Audemard's Une Anche Passe and Trioc. Limousin Limousin is known for its violin music, as well as the chabrette bagpipe. Eric Montbel is the biggest star of Limousin folk, while Fran√ßoise Etay, Jean Pierre Champeval, Olivier Durif, Valentin Clastrier and Pascal Lefeuvre are also popular. Instruments include the cabrette bagpipe and the ancient army fife, pifre. Limousin violin music, focussed in Corr√®ze, has produced stars Fran√ßois Etay and Trio Violon, while more modern fiddlers include Fran√ßois Breugnot, Olivier Durif, Jean Pierre Champeval and Jean- Fran√ßois Vrod. The hurdy-gurdy in Limousin has been extended to avant-garde styles utilizing electronic music, jazz and other influences, including Pascal Lefeuvre, Dominique Regef and Valentin Clastrier. Provence and Alps Singer Miqu√®u Montanaro The most iconic form of Proven√ßal folk music is a duo of fife and drum, or ensembles of galoubets-tambourins; the most prominent characteristic of the region's folk music, however, is the Italian musical influence. Performers include Patrice Cornte, Yves Rousguisto and Andr√© Gabriel. Provence's diverse communities include Savoie, whose distinct hurdy gurdy tradition has produced the modern band La Kinkerne, the Alpes Maritimes choral tradition, which includes choirs like La Compagnie Vocale and Corous de Berra, and the northern region, which has produced a vibrant violin tradition, Dauphin√©'s rigaudon dance and performers Rigodon Sauvage, Patrick Mazellier and Drailles. Dauphin√© also features one of the rare sword dances that have stood the test of time, the Bacchu-ber performed yearly in Brian√ßon. Roussillon The southwestern region of Roussillon's music is shaped by its unique ethnicities, and includes forms of Catalan and Gypsy music. The former includes the sardana and is based around the city of Perpignan. The sardana is played by a band (coble) consisting of three kinds of oboes, flutes and other instrument, including shawms and bagpipes among some recent revivalists. Modern traditional performers include Cobla Mil-Lenaria, La Cobla de Joglars, Els Ministrles del Rossellano and La Colba els Montgrins.

He has also contributed by explaining self-deception as an adaptive evolutionary strategy (first described in 1976) and discussing intragenomic conflict.Robert Trivers at Rutgers School of Arts and Sciences Education Trivers studied evolutionary theory with Ernst Mayr and William Drury at Harvard from 1968 to 1972, when he earned his PhD in biology.Trivers, 2015, ch 3 His first major paper, Reciprocal Altruism, was published in 1971.The Evolutionary Revolutionary Career and research Trivers was on the faculty at Harvard University from 1973 to 1978, and then moved to the University of California, Santa Cruz where he was a faculty member 1978 to 1994. He is currently a Rutgers University notable faculty member. In the 2008‚Äì09 academic year, he was a Fellow at the Berlin Institute for Advanced Study. Trivers was awarded the 2007 Crafoord Prize in Biosciences for \\"his fundamental analysis of social evolution, conflict and cooperation\\". Trivers met Huey P. Newton, Chairman of the Black Panther Party, in 1978 when Newton applied while in prison to do a reading course with Trivers as part of a graduate degree in History of Consciousness at UC Santa Cruz. Trivers and Newton became close friends: Newton was godfather to one of Trivers's daughters.

In 2015, Rutgers University suspended Trivers with pay as part of an ongoing dispute regarding a class the Anthropology department had assigned to him. Trivers said that he was told to teach the class even though he objected that he knew nothing about the specific subject. In his first lecture, Trivers told the class he would do his best to learn the subject along with them and with the help of guest lecturers. Rutgers suspended Trivers for involving the students in the controversy. Trivers told the Rutgers campus newsletter that Rutgers's officials refused to meet with him. Trivers also told the student paper: \\"You would think the university would show a little respect for my teaching abilities on subjects that I know about and not force me to teach a course on a subject that I do not at all master.\\" Trivers was a friend of the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and received $40,000 from him to pursue research on knee symmetry and sprinting ability. Commenting on the accusation that Epstein had sexual relations with underage women, Trivers said: \\"By the time they‚Äôre 14 or 15, they‚Äôre like grown women were 60 years ago, so I don‚Äôt see these acts as so heinous\\" . =Influence= Trivers is among the most influential evolutionary theorists alive today.

It is an Italian-American dish and is related to various regional fish soups and stews of Italian cuisine. Description Cioppino is traditionally made from the catch of the day, which in San Francisco is typically a combination of Dungeness crab, clams, shrimp, scallops, squid, mussels and fish, all sourced from salt-water ocean, in this case the Pacific. The seafood is then combined with fresh tomatoes in a wine sauce. The dish can be served with toasted bread, either local sourdough or French bread. The bread acts as a starch, similar to a pasta, and is dipped into the sauce. History Cioppino was developed in the late 1800s by Italian immigrants who fished off Meiggs Wharf and lived in the North Beach neighborhood of San Francisco, many from the port city of Genoa. When a fisherman came back empty handed, they would walk around with a pot to the other fishermen asking them to chip in whatever they could. What ever ended up in the pot became their Cioppino. The fishermen that chipped in expected the same treatment if they came back empty handed in the future.Food Paradise - Seafood Paradise 2 S5 Ep7, aired 8/12/2015 It later became a staple as Italian restaurants proliferated in San Francisco. The name comes from cioppin (also spelled ciopin) which is the name of a classic soup from the Italian region Liguria, similar in flavor to cioppino but with less tomato and using Mediterranean seafood cooked to the point that it falls apart. The dish also shares its origin with other regional Italian variations of seafood stew similar to cioppin, including cacciucco from Tuscany, brodetto di pesce from Abruzzo and others. Similar dishes can be found in coastal regions throughout the Mediterranean, from Portugal to Greece. Examples of these include suquet de peix from Catalan-speaking regions and bouillabaisse from Provence. The earliest printed description of cioppino is from a 1901 recipe in The San Francisco Call, though the stew is called \\"chespini\\". \\"Cioppino\\" first appears in 1906 in The Refugee's Cookbook, a fundraising effort to benefit San Franciscans displaced by the 1906 earthquake and fire. Presentation Generally the seafood is cooked in broth and served in the shell, including the crab, which is often served halved or quartered. It therefore requires special utensils, typically a crab fork and cracker. Depending on the restaurant, it may be accompanied by a bib to prevent food stains on clothing, a damp napkin and a second bowl for the shells. A variation, commonly called \\"lazy man's cioppino\\", is served with shells pre-cracked or removed.

This species has the most restricted distribution of the six spoonbill species, and it is the only one regarded as endangered. Spoonbills are large water birds with dorso-ventrally flattened, spatulate bills. These birds use a tactile method of feeding, wading in the water and sweeping their beaks from side-to-side to detect prey. Confined to the coastal areas of eastern Asia, it seems that it was once common throughout its area of distribution. It currently breeds only on a few small rocky islands off the west coast of North Korea, with four wintering sites at Macau, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Vietnam, as well as other places where they have been observed in migration. Wintering also occurs in Jeju, South Korea, Kyushu and Okinawa, Japan, and the Red River delta in Vietnam. More recently, sightings of black- faced spoonbill birds were noted in Thailand, the Philippines, and additional sites in China. They were internationally classified as an endangered species by the IUCN in 2000. Declines in their population are predicted in the future, mainly due to the amount of deforestation, pollution, and other man-made industries. The black-faced spoonbill population in the 2012 census was recorded at 2,693 birds, with an estimation of 1,600 mature birds. Breeding colonies occur between March and August, on small islands. These birds are known to be crepuscular eaters, using intertidal mudflats. Conservation efforts have been made, and surveys were taken in order to determine the opinions and awareness of the local residents, residing close to the black- faced spoonbill's natural habitats. One survey taken by Jin et al. 2008, inquired upon the ‚ÄòWillingness-To-Pay‚Äù factor in the locals, as well as understanding effects on mandatory surcharges compared to voluntary payments. Taxonomy A study of mitochondrial DNA of the spoonbills found that the black-faced and royal spoonbills were each other's closest relatives. Out of the six Platalea species within the family Threskiornithidae, the black-faced spoonbill is the rarest. Breeding Black-faced spoonbills reached a serious low in population in the 1990s, but by 2003 their numbers increased to at least 1,069 counted individuals. While it is known that their breeding area covers northeastern China and several islands between North and South Korea,Black-faced Spoonbill Conservation Association. (2001).Black-faced Spoonbill. Retrieved from http://www.bfsa.org.tw/en/ep02.htm human-assisted breeding efforts have not been overly successful due to the difficulty in sexing the black-faced spoonbills, yet using the polymerase chain reaction technique on DNA samples has allowed researchers to use another method to correctly sex adult Platalea minor specimens. After migrating to their wintering locations, black-faced spoonbills return with yellow breeding plumage, which extends from the back of their heads to their breasts. While this plumage only develops during the third or fourth year of life when the black-billed spoonbill is sexually mature, only about half of black-faced spoonbills with this plumage breed each breeding season, which contributes to the very slow pace at which the population numbers are increasing. Distribution The global population of this species, is likely based on the winter population count which was carried out in 1988‚Äì1990 in all known sites. This count estimated about only 288 individuals. As of 2006, following sustained conservation efforts, the estimated global population had increased to 1,679 ; the 2008 census resulted in an estimated total count of 2,065 individuals ; and a 2010 census reported 2,346 . The known localised population of North Korea is not known to exceed 30 birds. However, there is believed to be another, so far undiscovered colony which provides regional population stability and it is assumed to be probably located in north-east China; for example, on the islands of Liaoning (near the Korean nesting zone). As black-faced spoonbills are migratory birds, their conservation is based on the protection of their breeding, \\"stop-over\\" and wintering grounds, making conservation efforts complex. However, spoonbills are able to adapt to disturbances of large-scale. The exact distribution of the species remains unclear, although some attempts at modelling population developments under climate change impacts have been made. Threats It is thought that the principal cause of the decline of this species is the destruction of its habitat, more particularly the \\"valorization\\" of intertidal mudholes for agriculture, and more recently aquaculture and industrialization. The Korean War (1950‚Äì1953) must also have had a negative impact on the species, because the birds ceased nesting in South Korea at that time. In Japan, where it was once common for them to winter, they became extremely rare at this same time, and in later years there has never been a winter in which more than 5 birds were observed. With the construction of a Shinkansen bridge in the Yatsushiro Sea between 2004 and 2009 next to a very important migration site for the black-faced spoonbills, many feared that it would cause their numbers to decrease. Thankfully, because of carefully planned out measures implemented in order to counter act the construction of the bridge, the population actually managed to increase during the time of construction. Human disturbances can also be much more direct. Many humans disturb mating patterns unknowingly by taking photographs of birds during their mating time, leading to a decrease in offspring. Other humans willingly take eggs for selfish reasons, which accounted for 10% of the eggs taken in the Xing-Ren Tuo region of China in 1999. Conservation The bird is a protected species in China as part of the China Red Data Book; its stopover site at Jiuduansha off Shanghai is a national nature preserve.\\"Birds \\". The Shanghai Jiuduansha Wetland Nature Reserve (Shanghai), 2014. In Hong Kong, it is a protected species under Wild Animals Protection Ordinance Cap 200. In Mai Po Marshes, a quarter of the world's population of black-faced spoonbill can be found during migration. The species is reasonably well protected in North Korea, where their nesting islands off the coast were declared a Zone of Protection with restricted access. There remain nevertheless several threats, mainly in the wintering zones. The need for land to assign to industry is great in the wintering sites in Taiwan, whereas those in Vietnam are being converted for shrimp breeding, though they are within a reserve subject to the Ramsar Convention. During the winter months, over half of the black-faced spoonbill population migrates to the Chiku Wetland in southwestern Taiwan. The birds incapable of catching large fish; therefore many of them rely on the largescale mullets to feed off of in the winter months spent in the wetlands. These mullets however have recently become endangered due to the increase of spoonbill population who spend the winter months there (minimum of 191 birds in 1991/1992 up to a minimum of 840 in 2004/2005). Conservation of the largescale mullet is imperative in order to continue to sustain the endangered black-faced spoonbills. In Hong Kong, disturbances by fishermen and shell gatherers often prevent the birds from feeding at low tide. In addition, with the continued expansion of human populations in the Far East, pollution will probably become an important problem. Disease has the ability to devastate the black-face spoonbills as well. In the winter of 2002/2003, 73 of the population died due to avian botulism. It may be necessary to establish additional protective areas or reserves in order to not let the population of birds to succumb to disease.

Playing career  Recruited from Northcote, Regan struggled in his first few seasons and was tried in a variety of positions before he established himself at full- back.Holmesby & Main, 2009, p. 693 Taking on and matching full-forwards like South Melbourne's Bob Pratt (whom Regan regarded as his most difficult opponent),Jack Regan Retires: Praises Star Forward, Army News, (Thursday, 29 January 1942), p.8. Carlton's Harry Vallence, Richmond's Jack Titus and St Kilda's Bill Mohr, Regan earned his title as the \\"Prince of Full-backs\\". He was a magnificent mark and a superb kick. Archival footage shows him using the now defunct drop kick for his kick-ins. In slow motion they demonstrate his perfect balance and timing. Regan was among the best players in the Magpies' 1935 and 1936 premiership victories, both against South Melbourne.Atkinson & Atkinson, 2009, p. 134Atkinson & Atkinson, 2009, p. 140 In May 1938, during a match against Carlton, Regan fell heavily and suffered a double dislocation of an elbow. He spent a week at St Vincent's Hospital, and ended up missing nine matches. He recovered in time to play a part in Collingwood's finals campaign, but again for the second successive year was on the losing end as Carlton emerged victorious with the 1938 pennant. In January 1942 Regan announced his retirement from football to join the Salesian community at Sunbury as a lay brother. In February 1943, with Australia now involved heavily in the Second World War, Regan enlisted with the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) and served as a leading aircraftman. He returned in 1943 to captain Collingwood. In April 1946, shortly after being discharged from military service, Regan returned to Collingwood and trained so well that he was selected for their Round 1 match of the 1946 season against Hawthorn. In March 1947, it was announced that Regan had been appointed coach of Kalgoorlie City Football Club in Goldfields Football League. Essendon champion Dick Reynolds considered Regan the best full-back he ever saw. In an article for Melbourne newspaper The Argus Reynolds recounted watching Regan play state football against the likes of Ken Farmer from South Australia and George Doig from Western Australia and said: > [H]e made them earn every goal they kicked against him. It was great to see > the way in which he shadowed them or marked or punched the ball away, and > then, with great dash and a beautiful kick, sent the ball in the right > position for an attack. His quick thinking and unruffled style at critical > moments made him a star full-back. During his playing career, Regan had worked as a clerk for the Commonwealth Social Service in Melbourne. After returning to Melbourne from Kalgoorlie he continued to serve at Collingwood for many years, and was club secretary from 1969 to 1977.  Posthumous honours  Regan was among the first players inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame in 1996, but was overlooked for the full-back position when the Team of the Century was named. That honour went instead to Carlton's Stephen Silvagni, to the bewilderment of many in the Australian football community. In 1997, when the Collingwood Team of the Century was announced, Regan was named at full-back. In 2004, at the launch of the Collingwood Hall of Fame, Regan was one of 18 inducted players. The Collingwood player who finishes fifth in the club's best-and-fairest count is awarded the Jack Regan Trophy.

Its sequel is My Mother's Castle. It is the first of four volumes in Pagnol's Souvenirs d'enfance series. It is also a 1990 film based on the novel, and directed by Yves Robert. Plot summary A poetic novel about his family and his early years rather than a literal autobiography, Pagnol opens with the stories of his two parents, Joseph and Augustine, and his own arrival in 1895 as their first child in the little town of Aubagne among the mountains of Provence. A school teacher there, the fiercely secular and socialist Joseph then gets a better job in the bustling city of Marseille. There his mother's sister Rose is courted by the fiercely conservative and Catholic Jules, who marries her. Despite striking many sparks off each other, the two brothers-in- law overall enjoy each other's company. So much so that in 1904 they agree to rent a remote farmhouse outside the village of La Treille, where the two families can spend their summer together and get back to the simple pleasures of rural life. After a long struggle up mountain tracks, with their belongings on a mule, they reach what for young Marcel is an earthly paradise. He falls instantly in love with the wild landscape, its distinctive vegetation and its abundant wildlife. While he and his little brother Paul spend their days in happy play among the hills, his father and uncle have weightier business. It will soon be the opening of the shooting season and, now they are proper countrymen rather than city intellectuals, they must be out with shotguns in search of game. As Joseph has never fired a gun in his life, Jules has all the pleasure of teaching the ignorant teacher the mysteries of this craft. In addition to learning how to use the weapon, Joseph has to learn how to bring down all the different sorts of game, above all the most legendarily difficult and rewarding local bird. This is the rock partridge, of which few men have hit more than a couple of tail feathers. On the great day, the two set off and young Marcel disobeys them by following, for he is terribly worried that his shy spectacle-wearing father will be humiliated by the loud know-all uncle. Trying to keep out of sight, the boy gets lost in the uninhabited mountains, until after several hours he hears two shots in quick succession. Out of the sky near his feet fall two rock partridges. His father got them, his only kill of the day, by firing both barrels. Next day, Joseph volunteers to go down to the village for the shopping and ties the two carcasses to his belt. The whole community is lost in admiration for his unparallelled feat and the priest is so impressed that he overcomes Joseph's atheist scruples by rushing home for a camera to record this historic moment.

Together with Chris Russo, he launched Mike and the Mad Dog in 1989 on WFAN in New York City, which ran until 2008 and is one of the most successful sports-talk radio programs in American history. On December 15, 2017, Francesa retired from his own show, Mike's On: Francesa on the FAN, which had been airing in the afternoon drive slot formerly occupied by Mike and the Mad Dog. He was succeeded by Chris Carlin, Maggie Gray and Bart Scott in the same time slot for the first ratings book of 2018. On April 27, 2018, WFAN announced that Francesa would return to the station for a -hour afternoon show, a shorter shift than his original slot. Francesa hosted this shortened afternoon drive WFAN slot in a tumultuous tenure through the end of 2019 before he retired for a second time, moving to a half-hour evening slot on WFAN while also producing content for the Entercom-owned Radio.com platform, which began in January 2020. On March 24, 2020, Francesa was tapped to return to the station for a daytime slot on Sundays, and on May 26, 2020, he began returning to WFAN on weekdays for an hour each day. On July 24, 2020, Francesa retired for the third time citing the desire for more time with his family. Career =1982-1993: CBS Sports= Francesa started his career by spending six years at College and Pro Football Newsweekly. He was hired by CBS Sports in 1982 as a researcher, focusing primarily on college sports.Shane Fitzgerald (1990-03-30), CBS' Francesa first worked behind scenes, Rocky Mountain News. At CBS Sports, he was initially a behind-the-scenes, statistic-wielding editorial assistant, but network executives were so impressed by his knowledge that he was made a studio analyst for college basketball and footballCharles Siebert (1990-08-19), The Sportscasters, The New York Times Magazine. and acquired such a reputation that The New Yorker termed him \\"Brent Musburger's brain.\\" When he was a studio analyst at CBS Sports, he said the most common complaint he heard was about his New York accent.Jack Craig (1990-03-30), CBS' Francesser is plainly a success basketball, football expert defies network standards for appearance, accent, The Boston Globe. ESPN tried to lure Francesa, as its studio expert on college football, college basketball and the NFL in 1991, but he declined their offer.News wire (1991-04-14), Sports People: Television; Francesa declines offer, The New York Times. Francesa announced on the radio that he quit CBS on April 1, 1993Richard Sandomir (1993-04-03), Final Four: it's prime time, bay-bee!, The New York Times. before the 1993 Final Four began.Richard Sandomir (1996-04-02), CBS wins on court and falls flat off it, The New York Times. =1989-2008: Mike and the Mad Dog on WFAN= When WFAN was launched in 1987, Francesa applied for a host job. However, station management was looking for top-shelf types rather than someone with no experience, and he was only offered a producer's job, which he ended up rejecting.Steve Zipay (1993-04-01), :Mr. Sports Tawk: Some national viewers don't like Mike Francesa's accent and attitude.\\" \\"Hey, I'm a New York guy,' the sportscaster says defiantly. 'I wear it as a badge,'\\" Newsday With his then-wife Kate's encouragement, Francesa continued to pursue WFAN. Finally, WFAN gave him a job as a weekend host talking college football and basketball in August 1987. Because of the positive reviews, Francesa began to guest-host other shows. Because of his initial success as a weekend and fill- in host, he was teamed with local New York City host Ed Coleman, and the duo had a popular show on the 10 a.m.‚Äì2 p.m. slot. In 1989, WFAN was looking for hosts to replace the controversial Pete Franklin in the afternoon drive time period between 3 and 7 p.m. Station management decided to team the knowledgeable, but somewhat dry Francesa with the young and vibrant Chris Russo. While Francesa's brand of sports commentating was considered hard- hitting and serious, Russo's was lighter, unconventional, and more entertaining. The show was dubbed Mike and the Mad Dog. The show quickly gained popularity and was a staple of the New York sports scene from 1989 to 2008. The duo won the 2000 Marconi Award for Major Market Personality of the Year. They were the first sports-talk hosts ever to win the award. Francesa also hosted a weekly radio show called The NFL Now, which originated from WFAN and aired from 1987 to 2016. It eventually became syndicated and at one time was simulcast on MSNBC and later via video Webcast on NBCSports.com. The NFL Now became a syndicated program again when WBZ-FM in Boston started airing the show, a few weeks after the station's launch. Francesa also provided the nightly \\"Sportstime\\" commentary on the CBS Radio Network and Westwood One. Francesa regularly contributed to the Imus in the Morning program with his views on sports while it aired on WFAN and Westwood One. =2008-2017: Solo career= On August 14, 2008, it was announced that Russo had decided to leave WFAN, and thus ended the Mike and the Mad Dog show two weeks shy of its 19th anniversary scenario. This ended two months of speculation of whether the show was going to make it to a 20th season. At the same time, Francesa signed a five-year deal to stay at WFAN. September 8, 2008 officially marked the kickoff of Francesa's new solo WFAN program, which he announced on air would be called Mike'd Up, the same name as his former weekly television program on WNBC. Francesa on the FAN was seen on the YES Network from 2008 until 2014. On January 17, 2012, the show was renamed Mike's On. After Francesa left the show Mike'd Up: The Francesa Sports Final on WNBC, the television station retained the rights to the name of the show. NBC and CBS did not reach an agreement for the rights and WFAN changed the name. During his show's time on the YES Network, Francesa's trademark intro to a show hosted by himself was \\"From the studios of WFAN in New York and simulcast across the country on the YES Network, this is Mike's On: Francesa on the FAN.\\" On September 10, 2012, Francesa fell asleep live on air during a segment with Yankees beat reporter Sweeny Murti. He later denied he had fallen asleep after national ridicule and mockery including fans calling into the show. On March 24, 2014, Francesa's show began broadcasting nationally on Fox Sports 1. He changed his trademark intro to the show to \\"From the studios of WFAN in New York and simulcast across the country on Fox Sports 1, this is Mike's On: Francesa on the FAN\\". The relationship with Fox Sports was tumultuous at times so, Francesa and Fox Sports did not renew the contract to continue simulcasting his radio show effective September 11, 2015. Francesa took primary responsibility for the relationship not succeeding. During his entire solo run, Francesa hosted the top-rated drive time sports talk show in the New York market. On March 30, 2016, Francesa and Russo hosted the Mike and the Mad Dog reunion show at Radio City Music Hall. On December 24, 2016, Francesa said goodbye on his last ever Mike Francesa Football Sunday after CBS didn't renew it for 2017. Initial retirement On January 19, 2016, Francesa stated that he planned to leave WFAN when his contract with the station expired at the end of 2017. On May 3, 2017, WFAN announced WFAN Presents: Mike Francesa, A Night to Remember, to be held at the LIU Post Tilles Center on November 15 at 7:30 p.m. WFAN held Francesa's Next-To-Last WFAN/New York Show Live From The Paley Center for Media. Mike's final day on the air on WFAN was December 15, 2017. Mike signed off at 6:26pm EST on December 15, 2017 with these final words: \\"I want to thank you guys, the listeners, the audience. Because without you - we don't last a week. We don't last a month. So, what I'd like to say to you is, 'I will miss you. I thank you. And, from the bottom of my heart, I love you. Good bye.'\\" Return and launch of app =2018= On April 24, 2018, just over 4 months after having retired from WFAN, Francesa announced his intention to return there. The station confirmed the decision stating that he would return to afternoon drive, albeit with a shorter show running from 3-6:30pm Monday through Friday. On August 23, 2018, Francesa launched a subscription-based mobile app known as Mike's On, which provides a live video stream of Francesa's daily show on WFAN, archived interviews from previous shows, exclusively hosts Francesa's Sunday NFL show and Saturday college football show during their respective seasons, and occasional live reactions to sporting events. The $8.99 per-month price tag of the service was widely criticized by the media. After returning to WFAN, Francesa won the fall 2018 ratings book, the first since his return, with an average of 6.4 percent of the listening audience over The Michael Kay Show's 5.8, the show opposite his time slot on the New York ESPN affiliate WEPN-FM. The total included both the over-the-air radio listening audience and WFAN's online streaming audience, which has traditionally been included in the total audience rating because WFAN has different advertising on each format. Without the stream, Francesa would have still won the fall 2018 book during the time slot by a share of 5.9-5.8 over Kay's show. =2019= In the winter 2019 ratings book, Francesa received a 6.2 percent share of the listening audience compared to the 5.9 received by The Michael Kay Show during the same time slot. The total included both the over-the-air share as well as the WFAN online streaming. However, Kay beat Francesa 5.9-5.5 in the radio segment, and both hosts claimed victory on their respective shows. After hearing that Kay was celebrating victory over the disputed ratings book, Francesa said on his April 15, 2019 show that \\"I have nothing but sadness and pity for you that you would actually claim a victory that wasn't real‚Äù as well as saying that \\"you're ESPN, and you get beat like a rented mule for 20 years, it's got to hurt\\". Francesa later tweeted that \\"there was only one possible way to read [the ratings]\\" and that \\"anyone, and that means anyone, who says differently is either a fool or a liar.\\" Francesa also felt the stress of a close ratings battle for the first time in his NYC sports radio career, and got in a heated argument with WFAN management about the availability of a Craig Carton post-sentencing interview on the last few days of the book, after Carton was interviewed by Kay. On April 28, 2019, Francesa became the center of controversy yet again, appearing to shame both the New York Giants and their 2019 6th-round draft pick Corey Ballentine after Ballentine was wounded in a drive-by shooting the day before. Francesa said that the incident contrasted with the \\"great character\\" of the draft class the Giants claimed to have picked, despite evidence that the shooting was completely randomized. After some media members picked up on the comments, such as Francesa's fellow WFAN hosts Boomer and Gio, Francesa did walk back the opinion on his next day's show, but not before tearing into his FAN counterparts in a fiery rant on their morning show the same day, accusing them of purposely distributing misinformation about him and his comments. On May 16, 2019, Francesa fell asleep on the air again while taking a call from a listener. On September 3, 2019, it was announced that WFAN's owner Entercom had acquired the intellectual property of the Mike's On app, and that its content would be integrated into the company's Radio.com platform instead, with no additional subscription required. The Mike's On app was discontinued by the end of September, with its content having been made available for free in the meantime. Francesa never revealed the number of paying customers to his app, which was roundly criticized by the media throughout its existence. While delivering his \\"5 Minute Morning\\" recording on November 4th, 2019, Francesa appeared to deliver flatulence on the air, which was picked up and turned into a mainstream news story on several online publications, including the New York Daily News. Francesa later denied the incident occurred, saying on his afternoon show the same day that it was \\"fake news\\" and that the media was desperate for a headline. In the fall 2019 ratings book, Francesa's third full book since his return, his WFAN show lost to his ESPN rival The Michael Kay Show in direct head-to-head ratings, dethroning Francesa from the top of the New York sports ratings for the first time in his career, spanning back to 1989. In the book, Francesa was outrated by Kay 7.4-5.5, with Francesa's total share rising to 6.0 after including streaming. In response to his first-ever ratings book loss, Francesa criticized Kay and his co-hosts, claiming that \\"celebrating [their] success now would be the same as spiking the football after finally scoring a TD in a game that is 77-0!\\" During his radio comeback, Francesa's show was the target of criticism for reasons ranging from his frequent inaccurate predictions to his treatment of callers. His show was described as \\"grumbles and contentious conversations with callers on a regular basis\\" by Deadspin, and Francesa was particularly noted for responding negatively to a caller who told him that Stan Lee died. Video clips of Francesa making inaccurate predictions often went viral on Twitter, with players like Virginia basketball's Ty Jerome coming onto the show to specifically address them. Francesa also received attention for maintaining that Tiger Woods had \\"nil\\" chance after the second round to win the 2019 Masters Tournament, which Woods later won, and then later claiming that the video clips in question that showed the inaccurate predictions were doctored or altered. In a November 2019 interview, Francesa's former Mike and the Mad Dog co-host Chris Russo called the bombastic radio comeback \\"unhealthy\\". Russo revealed that he and Francesa had not spoken since March 2018 and in a direct criticism of his un-retirement, said ‚ÄúMike should never have come back. He should have stayed retired.\\", while conjecturing he may have realized towards the end of his second afternoon drive run that it was a mistake. Second retirement and second return On November 5th, 2019, Francesa announced his retirement from WFAN for a second time, announcing he would leave the station that December. On December 6th, 2019, he hosted his final afternoon show, giving thanks to both the station and the listeners. Francesa's departure left WFAN looking for a replacement to their afternoon drive slot, which they eventually filled with Joe Benigno and Evan Roberts, who formerly hosted the midday show on the same network. After Francesa left afternoon drive, WFAN announced he would not be leaving the station altogether and would instead host a shortened show in a later timeslot. On December 16th, 2019, Francesa revealed he would host a 30 minute show on WFAN from 6:00-6:30, with an additional hour on Radio.com. Francesa announced that the show would be mostly freeform, saying that \\"I can do whatever I want. I don‚Äôt have to sports. I can do politics. I can do whatever I want\\" in terms of content. =Third Comeback and Retirement= On January 6th, 2020, Francesa debuted the first show on his new format, hosting a half-hour show on WFAN nights during the week while also hosting on Entercom's Radio.com platform. Francesa announced plans to branch out to more than New York sports, talking about national sports as well as political discussions. On the first day of his new show, Francesa announced that his political coverage would be \\"played down the middle\\", claiming to provide an unbiased centrist perspective. On March 24th, 2020, Francesa returned to daytime sports radio at WFAN for the first time after his second retirement, taking a temporary weekends gig from 9:00 AM to 1:00 PM on Sundays. Downsizing at the station due to Coronavirus concerns played a part in WFAN's hiring of the longtime host, who had retired for a second time in December 2019. In May 2020, WFAN announced a revamp to their afternoon plans, slotting in Francesa in his first weekday show on the network since his second retirement, giving him a 6:00-7:00 PM time window. During Francesa's May 21st, 2020 show, he ridiculed and laughed at reports of an unnamed NFL player who claimed he was sexually assaulted during a United Airlines flight, disputing the inability or willingness of the player to prevent the assault. On July 24, 2020, Francesa retired from broadcasting his daily WFAN and Radio.com show for the third time citing the desire to spend more time with his family.  Acting  Francesa played a bookie in the 2019 film Uncut Gems, starring Adam Sandler. He also had a role playing himself in the 2003 TV movie Undefeated. Francesa also appeared in the 2020 ESPN docuseries The Last Dance, featuring in a short 1993 clip showing him questioning Michael Jordan's desire to win. Personal life Francesa was born and raised in Long Beach, New York. He is the second son of Michael Anthony Francesa, who abandoned the family when Francesa was eight years old. He has an older brother, John and a younger brother, Marty, who committed suicide on November 27, 1990. He attended Kellenberg Memorial High School in Uniondale (then known as Maria Regina High School),Mike Francesa and Chris Russo, Mike and the Mad Dog on WFAN.

In November 2019, Francesa bought a home in South Florida, reportedly due to his desire to pay less in tax money. =Political views= In April 2007, Francesa criticized Democratic Presidential nominees Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton after they called for the resignation of Don Imus, following comments Imus made about the Rutgers women's basketball team. In 2016, Francesa came out as a supporter of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, supporting him as early as May 2016 and voting for him in the 2016 presidential election. He has previously expressed support for Trump's national anthem perspectives, tweeting that the \\"NFL has lost its way\\" by allowing players to kneel for the playing of the national anthem. Francesa also brushed off reports that President Trump's finances were in trouble, pointing out that he was still able to win the 2016 election. Despite voting for Trump, Francesa claimed in January 2020 that he would be providing an \\"unbiased\\" moderate political perspective on his Radio.com show. In March 2020, Francesa criticized Trump's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. =Health= During the first week of June 2006, Francesa missed a few days on the radio for what was termed as \\"personal reasons.‚Äù Soon after returning on the June 8, 2006, show he revealed that following medical tests, he needed to change his diet due to his weight struggles.Phil Mushnick (June 12, 2006), \\"Luis lite\\", New York Post.

He was a tall fast-medium bowler able to extract bounce on most surfaces. Tremlett started his playing career with Hampshire in 2000 and was awarded his county cap in 2004. He made his One Day International debut in 2005, and two years later played his first Test. Tremlett played three Tests in 2007 before injury interrupted. Tremlett moved to Surrey for the start of 2010 after struggling with injury. Following this move, he forced his way back into the Test team and participated in England's victory in the 2010‚Äì11 Ashes in Australia. He was a competent number 8 or 9 batsman, with seven first-class fifties to his name and has a strong arm from the deep. He retired from all forms of cricket on 21 August 2015 due to injury. Tremlett had been affected by back and knee injuries in recent years and was restricted to three Championship appearances for Surrey in 2015. In retirement he took up weightlifting and in June 2017 he shared a picture of his body transformation which went viral on the internet. Domestic career and early England years Tremlett started career at Hursley Park CC. Tremlett took a wicket with his first ball in first-class cricket against New Zealand A in 1999, dismissing Mark Richardson. He went to India with the Under-19s in 2000/01, and was one of the first cricketers to attend the ECB Academy the following year. Tremlett won the NBC Denis Compton Award in both 2000 and 2001. His grandfather Maurice played three times for England in the 1940s and also for Somerset, while his father Tim turned a playing career into a coaching job at Hampshire, and has coached his son during Chris's entire professional career. In 2005 he made his England debut in a One Day International against Bangladesh at Trent Bridge, Nottingham, taking 4‚Äì32 and missing out on a hat-trick only by a freak occurrence: the hat-trick ball fell onto the top of Mohammad Ashraful's stumps, but did not dislodge a bail. To demonstrate his continuing progress Tremlett was regularly selected in England's 12 for the Ashes Tests later in 2005 but due to the success and consistency of the first choice bowlers he did not make his debut. He was also selected for the 2005‚Äì06 season tour to Pakistan, but had to withdraw because of injury. After undergoing surgery to his right knee and hip, he also missed the tour to India.Tremlett ruled out of India tour, from BBC, retrieved 31 August 2006 Tremlett was part of the Hampshire team that won the 2009 Friends Provident Trophy final (seen here during the final).

The pitches at the Rose Bowl were not suited to Tremlett's bowling style, and it was felt that The Oval would be a more fruitful hunting ground. The end of the 2009 season saw a great deal of change in Surrey's squad, with nine players leaving; Tremlett was the fifth player to join the club before the start of the 2010 season. Tremlett was selected by the MCC to play against Durham, the champion county, in March 2010 but was withdrawn on the insistence of Surrey manager Chris Adams to minimise the risk of injury early in Surrey's season. Test career After cutting down his run up and increasing his pace through work with Hampshire teammates Shane Warne and Stuart Clark, Tremlett came back into Test contention in 2007 after a rash of injuries to established bowlers. He played for the England Lions against India in their final warm up game before the first Test and finally made his Test d√©but at Lords against India on 19 July 2007 after Matthew Hoggard was ruled out with a back complaint. His grandfather having played Test cricket, Chris Tremlett became the fourth grandson of a Test cricketer to make a Test debut without his father having also played Tests. He is also the first Hampshire born Hampshire county cricketer to play a Test in England. He made a pair on debut, but took 4 wickets and during his second match, he took 3 wickets in each innings, and finished with figures of 3/12 as India cruised to a 7-wicket victory needing just 73 to win.

He was not selected to play in either of the first two tests, but in the first day of the third test, held at Perth, he took 3 wickets for 63 runs, troubling the Australian top order with the steepling bounce allowed for by the WACA surface. He followed that up with 5 for 87 in the Australian second innings. On the first day of the fourth test, the Boxing Day Test held at the MCG, he took 4 for 26 as England skittled Australia out for 98 runs. He took the last wicket in the last test, and with it, England won the series. During the summer of 2011, in the third match against Sri Lanka, he took his best Test figures of 6/48 as England bowled out Sri Lanka for 184. With 15 dismissals, Tremlett finished as the leading wicket-taker in the series on either side. India toured in July for four Tests, five ODIs, and a T20I. Selected for the opening match of the Test series, Tremlett took 4/124 in England's victory, extracting bounce from the Lord's pitch to trouble the Indian batsmen. However, he was hampered by injury with a hamstring problem on the fourth day of the first Test and a back spasm during pre-match training ahead of the second Test. The back injury prevented Tremlett from playing any further part in the series. In September, for the first time Tremlett was awarded one of 13 central contracts with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) until September 2012. After testing his fitness in November 2011, he was included in England's squad to play Pakistan in the UAE in the following January. While Tremlett was absent through injury, Tim Bresnan established himself in the team and Tremlett was left competing with Steven Finn for a place in the team. Bresnan suffered an injury and Tremlett was selected in his place for the first Test. However, a back injury ended his tour before the second Test. Examinations revealed the problem was a bulging disc and in February Tremlett underwent surgery.

It was one of the Epic Cycle, that is, the Trojan cycle, which told the entire history of the Trojan War in epic verse. The story of the Nostoi comes chronologically after that of the Iliou persis (Sack of Ilium), and is followed by that of the Odyssey. The author of the Nostoi is uncertain: ancient writers attributed the poem variously to Agias (8th century BC), Homer (8th century BC), and Eumelos (8th century BC) (see Cyclic poets). The poem comprised five books of verse in dactylic hexameter. The word nostos means \\"return home\\". Date The date of composition of the Nostoi, and the date when it was set in writing, are both very uncertain. The text is most likely to have been finalized in the seventh or sixth century BC. Content The Nostoi relates the return home of the Greek heroes after the end of the Trojan War. In current critical editions only five and a half lines of the poem's original text survive. For its storyline we are almost entirely dependent on a summary of the Cyclic epics contained in the chrestomathy attributed to an unknown Proklos (possibly to be identified with the 2nd-century-AD grammarian Eutychios Proklos). A few other references also give indications of the poem's storyline. The poem opens as the Greeks are getting ready to set sail back to Greece. The goddess Athena is wrathful because of the Greeks' impious behaviour in the sack of Troy (see Iliou persis). Agamemnon waits behind, to appease her; Diomedes and Nestor set sail straightaway, and reach home safely; Menelaus sets sail, but encounters a storm, loses most of his ships, lands in Egypt and is delayed there for several years. Other Greeks, including the prophet Calchas, go by land to Kolophon, where Calchas dies and is buried. As Agamemnon is getting ready to sail, Achilles's ghost appears to him and foretells his fate. Agamemnon makes a sacrifice and sets sail anyway; Neoptolemus, however, is visited by his grandmother, the sea-nymph Thetis, who tells him to wait and make further sacrifices to the gods. Zeus sends a storm against Agamemnon and those accompanying him at Athena's request, and the lesser Ajax dies on the Kapherian rocks on the southern end of Euboia. Neoptolemus follows Thetis's advice and goes home by land; in Thrace he meets Odysseus at Maroneia, who has traveled there by sea. Neoptolemus arrives home, though Phoenix dies en route, and there he is recognised by his grandfather Peleus. Agamemnon arrives home and is there murdered by his wife Clytemnestra and her lover, Agamemnon's cousin Aegisthus. Later Agamemnon's and Clytemnestra's son Orestes avenges the murder by killing both of them. Finally Menelaus arrives home from Egypt. (This last section, known as the Oresteia, is narrated in Odyssey books 3 and 4 by Nestor and Menelaos; and it was later also the basis for Aeschylus' trilogy of tragic plays, the Oresteia.) At the end of the Nostoi the only living Greek hero who still has not returned home is Odysseus. His return is narrated in the Odyssey.

Early life  Robert Venour Dulhunty was born in the coastal township of Paignton, Devon, England, in 1803, to Dr John Dulhunty and Jane Smith. Jane was from West Country English stock and John's lineage was Irish in origin. The original Gaelic form of the name was O'Dulchaointigh and his forebears belonged to a sept of the O'Carroll clan situated in the province of Munster, Ireland.  Arrival in Sydney and early activities  At the age of 21, Robert Dulhunty arrived in the Colony of New South Wales as a free settler on the ship Guildford. The date of his arrival was 5 March 1824. He was accompanied on the voyage from England by his brother, Lawrence Vance Dulhunty ‚Äì a qualified surveyor with a sharp mind but a much less appealing manner than Robert's. Sydney was just 36 years old at the time of the Dulhunty's arrival. It was still essentially a penal outpost operating under the decidedly non- democratic control of the then Governor of NSW, Sir Thomas Brisbane. The economy of NSW was based overwhelmingly on sheep grazing, other types of livestock production and the growing of various crops ‚Äì with some additional income generated through whaling and sealing. Infrastructure projects were funded by the British Government and by the revenue reaped locally from taxes, including the collection of customs and excise duties levied on alcoholic spirits, tobacco and a wide range of imported goods. The colony possessed only a comparatively small contingent of skilled artisans, so convict iron-gangs were used perforce to build such necessary structures as roads, drains, bridges, wharves and fortifications, as well as public buildings of all kinds. Convicts quarried stone, too, and made bricks, felled trees and cleared paddocks. The more trustworthy of them were also assigned by the government to private landholders to work as agrarian labourers, shepherds or domestic servants. On 23 March 1824, Robert Dulhunty applied for a grant of Crown land. This was at a time when the colony's hinterland was being opened up increasingly to responsible citizens for farming and grazing purposes. The governor accordingly granted him legal title to 2000 acres (eight km2) of land which he had selected previously at Cullen Bullen. In addition, Dulhunty was allocated six convict servants/labourers who were to assist him with the task of making the property a viable enterprise. In 1826, Robert's father Dr John Dulhunty settled with his wife on a parcel of rural land at Burwood, which was situated 12 kilometres west of the port's mercantile and governmental core. Two years later, Dr Dulhunty was appointed to the salaried position of Superintendent of Police by the Governor of NSW. The governor had been impressed by the cool-headed bravery that he displayed when bushrangers attacked his residence, Burwood House. Dr Dulhunty's health declined unexpectedly in the wake of his police appointment, however, and he died at Burwood House in 1828. Robert Dulhunty's land grant marked the beginning of his rise through the ranks of colonial society. On 4 July 1828, Dulhunty requested a ticket of occupation from the NSW Surveyor-General, Sir Thomas Mitchell. He was rather brusquely informed by Sir Thomas on 10 July that the government had, for some time, discontinued giving tickets of occupation. Sir Thomas, however, would become a friend of Dulhunty's in the coming years. By the end of the 1820s, Dulhunty was living mainly at Claremont House in the Mulgoa Valley, not far from the Nepean River. Sometime between 1829 and 1833, he set out from the nearby township of Penrith with an escort of about 40 Aborigines. Crossing the rugged Great Dividing Range, he followed the Macquarie River down to what is now known as Dubbo. This area had not been occupied by any Europeans when the explorer Captain Charles Sturt traversed the Macquarie in 1829. When surveyor Robert Dixon passed through Dubbo to survey the Bogan River in 1833, he mentioned that he had borrowed a dray from Dulhunty. It is therefore believed that Dulhunty took up the land which he named \\"Dubbo\\" in 1832. Governor Sir Ralph Darling had created a zone known as the \\"limits of location\\" on 5 September 1826. Settlers were only allowed to take up land within this zone. A further government order, issued on 14 October 1829, increased the zone of approved settlement so that it now included an area called the 'Nineteen Counties'. Anyone who occupied land outside of this area were technically considered to be a 'squatter', without legal title. Among these squatters were many of the leading citizens of the colony, including Dulhunty. In 1836, Dulhunty was listed as a founding member of Sydney's elite Australian Club, the first meeting of which was held in October that year. The club's 86 members included such prominent citizens as W.C. Wentworth, Sir John Jamison, Captain John Piper, Dr William Bland, Major Edmund Lockyer, James Macarthur, William Lithgow and John Blaxland. Marriage Dulhunty's marriage took place at the Anglican Church of St James, central Sydney, on 29 April 1837. His bride, Eliza Julia Gibbes (1811-1892), was the English-born eldest daughter of Major (later Colonel) John George Nathaniel Gibbes. Colonel Gibbes (1787-1873) was a Member of the NSW Legislative Council and the Collector of Customs for NSW ‚Äì a vital revenue-raising task that he would perform for the colonial government from 1834 until 1859. (The Colonel was also reputed to be the bastard son of Frederick, Duke of York, the second son of King George III) Dulhunty and his wife held their wedding party on Sydney's Point Piper, where the Gibbes family lived. They honeymooned, however, near Penrith, at a Georgian mansion known as Regentville House. The mansion belonged to Sir John Jamison and stood at the heart of the knight's showpiece agricultural estate on the Nepean River. Dulhunty and Sir John knew each other well and Mrs Dulhunty's younger brother, William John Gibbes, was about to marry Sir John's eldest daughter. Not long after Dulhunty's wedding, he and Colonel Gibbes narrowly escaped being murdered by a pair of armed robbers while they were travelling in a carriage from the Sydney Customs House to a private engagement. Dulhunty was driving the carriage and their route took them along Parramatta Road. According to contemporary newspaper reports, when they reached a toll gate located near what is now the site of Sydney University they were ambushed by the two thugs, each of whom was brandishing a single-shot pistol. The thugs got angry when their victims refused to hand over their valuables and they made ready to shoot them. Luckily, however, it had been raining that afternoon, and the damp gunpowder in the thugs' pistols fizzled when the triggers were pulled. Dulhunty then slashed at the thugs with his horsewhip, and he and Colonel Gibbes were able to speed away to safety in their carriage. The police subsequently searched the area and interviewed informants but the perpetrators of the crime were never caught. Their appearance and distinctive way of speaking, as described by Dulhunty and Colonel Gibbes, led the investigating officers to conclude that they were English sailors who had probably come ashore from a ship moored in Blackwattle Bay. Family Dulhunty and his wife, Eliza Julia Dulhunty (n√©e Gibbes), had six sons and three daughters, the last three children being born in Dubbo. They were: * Blanche Jane - birth date, 3 June 1838 * Marcus - 18 May 1840 * John - 1841 * Robert George - 1843 (father of Robert and grandfather of Philip Wellesley Dunhunty, OAM) * Lawrence Joshua - 1844 * Alice - 1846 * Florence - 1848 * Hubert - 1849 * Alfred Murray - 1851 Another child, Emily, died as an infant in 1839 and lies buried at St Thomas' Churchyard, Mulgoa. Government appointments and later life Dulhunty, on 5 December 1837, was made the police magistrate for the Penrith District. He also took out a licence for 'Dubbo Station' in that same year. On 10 December 1840, Dulhunty accepted an appointment to serve on the Committee of the Australian Immigration Association. During the early 1840s, Dulhunty ‚Äì along with E. Blaxland and R.C. Lethbridge ‚Äì served the Penrith District as a local councillor, with Dulhunty's brother-in-law, William John Gibbes, acting in his spare time as the district's equivalent of a town or shire clerk. Gibbes was now managing the Regentville estate for his father-in- law, Sir John Jamison, who was in poor health. Gibbes and Dulhunty became close friends during this time. They shared a love of books, good food and horse-riding, and they both accepted positions as honorary stewards at Sir John's private racecourse. When Sir John died in 1844, Dulhunty and Mrs Dulhunty attended his funeral in Penrith. By 1839, 28 free men and 18 government-assigned male convicts had gone to work for Dulhunty on Dubbo station. Dulhunty\\"s reputation among the working men of the region was that of a fine bushman, a firm but fair-minded boss and an extremely able landed proprietor. Unlike some other squatters of this era, he rarely had his convict labourers flogged by their overseers when they transgressed. Dulhunty reached the zenith of his wealth in 1839‚Äì1840, when he is listed as the owner of half- a-dozen big grazing properties throughout NSW. Unfortunately, however, a severe economic depression struck the colony in the early 1840s, costing him a significant amount of money and forcing him to shed numerous assets. This crisis lasted for several years. He survived it but many of his coevals in NSW did not, as wool prices fell, banks failed, investment schemes collapsed and bankruptcies soared. Just before the depression hit, Dulhunty had erected a large, brick and timber homestead at Dubbo Station. Claremont, however, would remain his headquarters until 1847, in which year he decided to move permanently to Dubbo with his wife and children. This relocation proved to be an arduous logistical exercise for the Dulhuntys, who had to transport dray- loads of furniture and other belongings across rough mountain roads and along rutted bush tracks in sometimes hostile weather conditions. In 1849, a village was laid out at Dubbo and gazetted as a residential and commercial settlement. Henceforth, Dulhunty's landed estate, situated nearby, would become known as \\"Old Dubbo\\". The following year, convict transportation to NSW ceased, while the discovery of gold in NSW and Victoria during the early 1850s would transform the hitherto agricultural-based economies of these two neighbouring colonies and help attract free immigrants to Australia in unprecedented numbers. Death  Robert Venour Dulhunty died on Friday, 30 December 1853, after suffering for three days from an illness that is not identified on his death certificate. His brick-lined grave lies in the Dubbo Pioneers' Cemetery, which is situated on former Dulhunty land amidst a patchwork of paddocks and enclaves of bush. He was aged only 51 at the time of his passing. His widow Eliza fought a resolute but ultimately losing battle to hold together the Dulhunty's sprawling rural kingdom in the face of droughts, floods, outbreaks of livestock diseases, harsh bank foreclosures and various other setbacks ‚Äì and all the while being saddled with the additional responsibility of raising a large tribe of children to maturity. Those who knew her said she never lost her vibrant sense of humour, cultivated manners or deep interest in music and literature, no matter how serious the latest problem besetting her. Mrs Dulhunty never remarried. During the 1870s, she lived with one of her sons, Hubert Dulhunty, on a small rural property near Wellington, New South Wales. Later, when she grew frail with age and was handicapped by deteriorating eyesight, she moved to the town of Bathurst. Here she was looked after by another of her sons ‚Äì John, a commission agent. Mrs Dulhunty died at Bathurst Hospital on 13 February 1892, having outlived her husband \\"Bob\\" by almost 40 years. The \\"Bulletin\\" magazine, which was read widely by people in rural areas, published a brief but sympathetic obituary when informed of her death. She is buried in Old Bathurst Cemetery. Her headstone is still extant and photographs of her exist. Regrettably, no image of Robert Venour Dulhunty has been traced.

Biography Flunk began as a project between Ulf, and Jo in Oslo, Norway in late 2000 and early 2001. Beginning as an instrumental and sampled vocal project, they were signed for a track on a compilation by Beatservice Records in winter of 2001. On hearing the finished track, label manager Vidar Hanssen signed the still-unnamed band for a full album. During early summer 2001, Ulf and Jo recorded most of the album and Anja improvised the vocals. After their vocals, Jo layered the guitars, but it would be a year before the album would be completed and released. In spring 2002, the band was known as Flunk and they released their first single, a cover of New Order's Blue Monday in April. The track was well received in the UK and was included on numerous compilations in North America and Europe. Later in April, their debut album For Sleepyheads Only was released which garnered great reviews in Norway. With the success of their album, BBC invited them to do a recording session for the Radio 1 show The Blue Room in London. Shortly after Notting Hill Art's Club would become the location of their live debut. In the United States, they signed with Guidance Recordings. By summer 2002, the band was getting rave reviews from British electronica magazines and in July they played Norway's finest rock festival. In October For Sleepyheads Only was released in the US through Guidance Recordings. In November they played the London Jazz Festival. Throughout 2003 their debut, For Sleepyheads Only was still being echoed across the globe in staggered releases with special editions released to Russia and Greece. Beatservice Records then went on to release Treat Me Like You Do - For Sleepyheads Only Remixed in June. While their debut continued to make its way around, the band wasted no time and began work on their second album for the majority of the year, which was recorded in Paris in October. Their second album, Morning Star was finished in March 2004 and saw a Norwegian release in May while it was released in the rest of the world in June. In 2005, Play America was released on Beatservice Records which included bonus tracks from the US version of Morning Star along with remixes. In 2007 Flunk released their next album, Personal Stereo, while May 2009 saw the release of This Is What You Get, which includes a cover version of Radiohead's Karma Police.

She is best known for being the lead singer of Dutch symphonic metal band Epica, which she joined at the age of seventeen, releasing seven studio albums and touring the world. In her singing career, she has also collaborated with bands such as Kamelot, Leaves' Eyes, Primal Fear, Ayreon, and Angra. She also has a side pursuit as a lifestyle blogger, via her website SmoonStyle. Early life Simone Simons with Epica live at Wacken Open Air 2018 Simone Simons performing with Epica live @ Revolution Live, Ft. Lauderdale Simons was born in Hoensbroek, Netherlands. She has a younger sister named Janneke who was born on Simone's second birthday. Simons cited her musical influences as Lacuna Coil, Nightwish, Tristania, Kamelot, Within Temptation, Dimmu Borgir, Tiamat, and some classical music such as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Simons started playing flute for two years after joining music school at the age of 12.http://www.spotlightreport.net/slider/on-the-spot- epicas-lead-vocalist-simone-simons-interview At 14, she had one year of pop singing lessons, and at 15, she switched to classical singing after listening to Nightwish's Oceanborn, which remains her favorite Nightwish album. At one point she was invited to join in a rehearsal for a black metal band; she joined it, although was a little afraid to sing. Simons sang in a choir for a few months, and later joined Epica at the age of 17. Epica Simons performing with Epica in 2014 In early 2002, Mark Jansen left After Forever over creative differences. He then began looking for musicians who would work towards a more classical/symphonic type of music project; this was initially named \\"Sahara Dust\\". In late 2002, the band courted Helena Michaelsen (from Trail of Tears) as its frontwoman, but shortly after she was replaced by the then unknown Simons, who was Jansen's girlfriend at the time. Personal life In January 2008, Simons was suffering from recurrent MRSA infections. This forced Epica to cancel many of their shows. In February, her condition improved, but she had not completely recovered. In March, Epica toured with Amanda Somerville, replacing Simons for their United States tour until 11 May 2008, when Simons performed again at their show in Bibelot, Dordrecht. Asked about her looks as one of the factors that attract attention to Epica, Simons said: \\"First of all the most important is the sound of the band, because beauty will fade one day, and I hope my voice won't [Laughs]... But, yeah, you have two aspects of the band ‚Äì the music (the CD's) and then the live side of it (the show), and part of the show is also that it has to look nice, so I take good care of myself, I make sure that the fans have something to look at during the show.\\" Simons and long-time partner, Kamelot keyboard player Oliver Palotai have a son, Vincent Palotai, born on 2 October 2013.

It is 58 kilometres west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Penrith and is part of the Greater Western Sydney region. Emu Plains is on the western side of the Nepean River, located at the foot of the Blue Mountains. History =Aboriginal culture= Prior to European settlement, what is now Emu Plains was on the border of the Western Sydney-based Darug people and the Southern Highlands-based Gandangara people, whose land extended into the Blue Mountains. The local Darug people were known as the Mulgoa who lived a hunter-gatherer lifestyle governed by traditional laws, which had their origins in the Dreamtime. They lived in huts made of bark called 'gunyahs', hunted kangaroos and emus for meat, and gathered yams, berries and other native plants. =European settlement= The first British explorers to visit the area surveyed Emu Plains in August 1790 led by Watkin Tench, and named it Emu Island after emus they sighted on the land and in the mistaken belief that the land was actually on an island in the Nepean River. It was first referred to by its current name by Governor Lachlan Macquarie on 15 April 1814, when he toured the island also realising that it was not an island but a plain that occasionally flooded giving the appearance of an island. When William Cox started building his road over the Blue Mountains from there, The Cox's Road started work at Emu plains on 18 July 1814. A government farm with convict labour was established in 1813 with 1326 convicts working on growing local agriculture. It closed down in 1833 and the land was Gazetted and sold to establishment the village of Emu Plains. Emu Ferry Post Office opened on 1 April 1863 and was renamed Emu Plains in 1882. The removal of river-stones from the Nepean River for concrete and road-base was begun by the Emu and Prospect Gravel and Road Metal Company in the 1880s. A railway siding, which was to be ultimately expanded into a short branch, was first laid in from the Main Western Line at Emu Plains in 1884. Railway operations, which included their own locomotives, continued until 1967, after when only a siding, shunted by Government trains, remained. All railway operations ceased in 1993.Sydney's Forgotten Quarry Railways Oakes, John pp38-52 Emu Plains has a number of landmark buildings: * The railway station is a notable building of brick and sandstone, with Tudor chimneys, built in 1883. It is unusual for railway stations because it has two storeys; it has a Local Government Heritage Listing.State Heritage Website:Retrieved 26 November 2009 * Emu Hall is a substantial home by the Nepean River. It was built in 1851 by Toby Ryan (1818‚Äì1899), who occupied the house until 1875. The house has a Local Government Heritage Listing. * St Paul's Anglican Church was built in 1848 and has a cemetery. * The former Arms of Australia Inn was built in 1833 to service the roads through the area. It has been restored by the Nepean District Historical Society with government funding and is used as a historical museum. It has a Local Government Heritage Listing. * At the corner of Russell Street and the Great Western Highway is the original Emu Plains post office, a sandstone Gothic cottage. Commercial area The main commercial centre is Lennox Village (formerly Centro Lennox), named after David Lennox is a shopping centre that features Aldi and Woolworths. Transport Emu Plains railway station is situated on the T1 (North Shore & Western Line) of the Sydney Trains network. It is the last station on the suburban line with Lapstone, the next station to the west, considered part of the Intercity network. While a long distance from Sydney city, there are many express services from Emu Plains to the city. Emu Plains is also serviced by Blue Mountains Transit. Emu Plains can easily be accessed from Penrith via the Great Western Highway. Access from further east is best obtained by the M4 Western Motorway. If travelling east from the Blue Mountains, access is best obtained by the Great Western Highway.

Cultural attractions Penrith Regional Gallery & The Lewers Bequest is an art gallery established at the former property of artists Gerald and Margo Lewers. It is at 86 River Road Emu Plains. The property was bought by the Lewers in the 1940s and in 1950 it became their permanent home and studio. Gerald died in 1962 and Margo continued to live and work there until her death in 1978. In 1980 the Lewers' daughters donated the site, buildings, gardens and a substantial collection of art to Penrith City Council. The Gallery was opened in August 1981 by the New South Wales Premier, Neville Wran. Every year tens of thousands of visitors inspect the gallery‚Äôs exhibitions and use the gardens and caf√©.Penrith Regional Gallery & The Lewers Bequest website  Heritage listings  Emu Plains has a number of heritage- listed sites, including: * Main Western railway: Emu Plains railway station Churches =Anglican= The Parish of St Paul‚Äôs Emu Plains was formed and the Church School licensed on 8 November 1848. The first resident rector was appointed in 1856 and the church building consecrated on 16 August 1872. The chancel was added to the original building about 1887. The original rectory and most of the church records were lost on 4 January 1929 in a bushfire. At the time of the centenary of the church in 1948, the parish was responsible also for branch churches Christ Church Castlereagh and St Thomas‚Äô Cranebrook, and later also included St David‚Äôs Llandilo. In more recent times these branch churches have become linked with the parish of Cambridge Park, and Emu Plains has become a single-church parish. Apart from the original church building, the property currently consists of the Parish Centre (with hall, offices, resource centre, kitchen) built in 1991, two timber two-room Classrooms, a staff residence built in 1969 and a second worker‚Äôs home located in Beach Street.

Rev. Steve Turnbull commenced his ministry with Emu Plains Community Baptist Church in February of that year and concluded at the end of October 2010. The services were initially held in the Emu Plains Community Centre, which served the congregation well until the growing numbers meant that the space was no longer sufficient. On 23 October 2005, the services were moved just down the road to Melrose Hall which meets at 9.35am on Sundays Population = Demographics= At the 2016 census, there were 8,421 residents in Emu Plains.

The character starts out being regarded as an incapable underachiever, but eventually proves himself by overcoming some prodigious deed, succeeding where all others have failed. The character's name appeared as Boots in Dasent's 19th century English translations. Name The name Askeladden (meaning 'ash-lad') or Askeladd is the standard form which Asbj√∏rnsen and Moe eventually settled for. However, the storytellers used this alongside other variant names such as Askefis, sometimes interchangeably within the same tale. In fact, the most frequently recorded original name was ' or Askefis,: \\"Askefisen.. was most often encountered\\". glossed as a person who blows on the coal to stoke the fire.: \\"signifies one who blows at the coals to make the fire blaze\\". The latter word is attested since the 15th century, in proverbs. This would make sense, as the job of blowing on the embers was often assigned to the person of the household who was considered the least fit for other, more demanding chores ‚Äì typically a fragile grandmother or a small child. But because the editors felt Askefis to be too rustic, they favoured the name Akeladden (or altered it to Askepot) which seemed more refined. This adulteration was derided by P. A. Munch as overly prim and lacking courage. In Asbj√∏rnsens's first edition (1843), the name appears as Askepot, which in Norway is commonly associated with Cinderella. The name was changed to Askeladden in the second edition, but strangely enough, in the first tale (\\"About Askeladden who Stole from the Troll\\"), the name Askepot was still retained in the narrative itself. The form Esben Askepot was later changed to Esben Askelad in the second edition by Asbj√∏rnsen and Moe, then later to Espen Askeladd by Moltke Moe = Etymology = Askelad or Askeladd (without the definite -en suffix: \\"the final -en has universally been regarded as merely the suffixed article, which it probably is\\".) are Danized, or Dano-Norwegian forms., citing Brynildsen, John (1902) \\"Boots\\": \\"Askeladden, Esben Askelad, i Eventyret\\", A Dictionary of the English and Dano-Norwegian Languages, p. 107, citing Brynildsen, John (1927) \\"Aske- ladd\\": \\"a child allowed to lie among the ashes, neglected child\\", Norsk- engelsk ordbok, p. 33 The Norwegian form Oske-ladd is composed of 'ash' and 'hair sock' (related to 'hairy, shaggy'), with the explanation that ashes allowed to cling to the feet seem like furry socks. A more conjectural etymology hypothesizes the second part to be related to lodden meaning \\"blow gently\\", which conforms with the idea behind the name Askefis, of a person who blows on the embers to enliven the fire. As for Esben Oskelad, Esben is said to be a variant of Esbern, cognate to the Norse name Asbj√∏rn and English name Osborn. = English translations = Askeladd/Oskeladd has been rendered into English as \\"Cinderlad\\" (or \\"Ash-Lad\\"), this fails to accurately reflect the meaning as outlined above. George Webbe Dasent chose to translate the name (Askefis, Askepot) as \\"Boots\\", which was criticized as a \\"disenchanting rendering\\" of \\"Cinderson\\" by The Athenaeum literary magazine, but defended as \\"aptly styled\\" by Scottish folklorist W. A. Clouston. Dasent was well aware of cognate names in Scots English dialects, such as \\"Ashiepattle\\" and \\"Ashypet\\". Dasent says he coined the name \\"Boots\\" as representative of the tradition in English households that the youngster of the family were expected to perform the meanest chores. He fails to elaborate more than this, but \\"boots\\" is glossed as \\"the servant at an inn who pulls off and cleans the boots of travellers\\" in a dictionary from the Victorian Era. General description Askeladden is characterised as the runt of the family, being \\"the youngest, smallest, and weakest\\", yet \\"clever, bold, patient\\", and against all odds, eventually successful. The hero has great rewards in store, often the princess's hand in marriage and half the kingdom. However, as Jan Brunvald has noted, there is somewhat of a gap between the Askeladden in the actual folktales, and the national hero and symbol of every countryman () to which he has been elevated by the Norwegian populace. In the folktales, by all accounts, Askeladden remains near the hearth and idly \\"roots about\\", but according to Norwegian sources, he is forced by his family to sit in the ashes in the hearth. The character is also closely related to the common and quite nationalistic jokes of the three Scandinavian archetypes, the Norwegian, the Swede and the Dane. In those jokes, the Norwegian always succeeds in petty contests where the others do not. The jokes resemble the fairy-tale pattern and are mostly told by Norwegian children. Here, one can interpret the Norwegian as the youngest and underdog brother of the three, a parallel to the historical facts of Norway's position in Scandinavia. List of folktales Askeladden is the protagonist in numerous folk tales: * Om Askeladden som stjal Troldets S√∏lvander, Senget√¶ppe, og Gulharpe (NF #1); :\\"About Ash Lad, Who Stole the Troll's Silver Ducks, Coverlet, and Golden Harp\\"..

Norske kunstneres billedutgave by Asbj√∏rnsen and Moe In many folk tales, the Ash Lad is portrayed as the youngest of three brothers. Early in a typical tale, the older brothers appear to have much greater chances of success in life. For example, one brother might be extremely well read, whereas another might be extremely competent in another area. In contrast, the Ash Lad is looked down upon as a seemingly drowsy ne'er do well, perhaps even as a loner or misunderstood eccentric, who spends too much time sitting by the fireplace lost in thought as he is poking the ashes. As the typical story unfolds, the oldest brothers try first to heroically overcome some major crisis or problem. As an example, one tale involves rescuing a princess held captive in a land East of the Sun and West of the Moon. The two older brothers, who are tied to conventional thinking, typically fall flat on their faces. In contrast, it is the Ash Lad who comes up with creative solutions. He is smarter, more tactical, more receptive and more aware of the needs of others. He outwits trolls, dodges charging unicorns or gets a magic Viking ship to transport him (similar to an also-popular folk tale, \\"The Fool and the Flying Ship\\") where he ultimately saves the princess. The \\"heroic\\" trait of the character is probably most prominent in the stories told by Peter Christen Asbj√∏rnsen and J√∏rgen Moe. The tales they collected present the \\"classical\\" Ash Lad. In other stories, collected by others, the character and his brothers are presented as mere scoundrels, even thieves. Those stories present the youngest brother as the one with the wits about him, and thus, he gets away with the loot. They always steal from the wealthy farmers or even the king, similar to the fabled Robin Hood. Those stories are documented from Vest-Agder, in their time the poorest parts of Norway, where suppression was common. Thus, the Ash Lad has some similarities with the Norwegian crime writer Gjest Baardsen (1791‚Äì1849). Further analysis The origin of the Askeladden character has been sought by some scholars in the old Norse god Loki, in his aspect as a fire v√¶ttir. = Parallels = In the \\"Peer and Paul and Esben Askelad\\" the father does not own even the shirt on his back, and tells his sons to make their fortune in the world. There is a variant collected by the NFS (Norsk Folkeminnesamling) where the father says he only has ragged skin trousers for clothes to provide, and sends out his sons to the world. To this has been found an Irish counterpart \\"Adventures of Gilla na Chreck an Gour\\" (rect√© \\"Adventure of [an] Giolla an Chroicinn Gabhair\\" or 'The Fellow with the Goat-skin'), which is an ash-lad tale in which the woman provides the boy kept around the hearth with a goat-skin to wrap around the waist. Derivative literature It has been observed that Henrik Ibsen's play Peer Gynt draws from Norwegian folklore, with some portions in particular owing to Askeladden tales. Albert Morey Sturtevant argued that Ibsen's almost proverbial phrase, which express the notion that one may never know the usefulness of seemingly trifling things until it is tested, derived from Per, P√•l og Espen Askeladd (where Esben and Espen Askeladd are equivalent). But contested the choice of tale, and instead favored Spurningen, for in that story Askeladden not merely finds trifling things, but his finds included a dead magpie, like Ibsen's verse (A variant of Spurningen was published later, entitled Prinsessen som ingen kunne m√•lbinde, and is also an alternative strong candidate).

Overview The company enjoyed their original moderate success by developing add-ons for build engine first-person shooters such as Duke Nukem 3D, Blood, and Redneck Rampage. At this point, the company had approximately 6 full-time employees. Sunstorm finally made an industry name for itself when it developed the first hunting simulation game Deer Hunter in 1997. Deer Hunter opened up an entirely new genre and spawned many sequels as well as copycats. The company relocated to a new office and increased the staff size significantly. They followed up with many more hunting simulators and attempted to branch back into developing action games with titles such as the side scroller Duke Nukem: Manhattan Project. However, they were not able to achieve the same level of success again and finally shut down in early 2003 citing financial and staffing difficulties as the primary reasons. Michael Root went on to found Gabriel Entertainment.

Clarke and Stephen Baxter. It is the second book in the series A Time Odyssey. The books in this series are often likened to the Space Odyssey series, although the Time Odyssey novels ostensibly deal with time where the Space Odyssey novels dealt with space. The first book in the series was Time's Eye. Plot summary Sunstorm opens with the last chapter of Time's Eye as its initial chapter, and Bisesa Dutt is in London, reunited with her daughter. It is 9 June 2037, the day after her helicopter was shot down in the North Western Frontier Province of Pakistan. The five years that she spent on Mir, an alternate Earth, are now only memories (though the fact that her body has aged five years since 8 June 2037, will eventually serve as some confirmation of her story). In the meantime, a major solar event occurs on 9 June, disrupting virtually all of the Earth's electronic hardware. Dramatic as it is, this phenomenon is only a minor precursor of a far more massive solar eruption about five years off. Scientific models of the projected 2042 event make clear that the Earth will be sterilised completely by the upcoming solar burst. The effects will be so powerful as to even endanger astronauts on Mars. Rather than sit by and allow the sun to just destroy all of Earth's life, political leaders (most notably the President of the Eurasian Union, Miriam Grec), and scientific leaders (led by Siobhan McGorran, the Astronomer Royal) decide to embark upon an ambitious plan to literally shield Earth from the worst effects of the storm. The plot is further complicated when information from Bisesa's odyssey suggests that what is happening to the sun is not simply a random happening in nature, but is rather the result of events set in motion by an alien intelligence over three millennia ago. Known as the Firstborn‚Äîsince they were the first alien race to reach sentience, and thus are the most advanced civilization in existence in the universe‚Äîthey are determined to stop later lifeforms from across the galaxy from infiltrating the stars, where they would increase entropy with energy usage and eventual wars, thus hastening the Universe's eventual heat death. Connections to other Clarke works Just as in Time's Eye, Baxter and Clarke pay small homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey with lines lifted from the earlier book. *The first words of Athena, a sentient artificial intelligence in Sunstorm, are \\"Good morning, Colonel Tooke. This is Athena. I am ready for my first lesson.\\" This is similar to the statement spoken by HAL and addressed to Dr. Chandra during his regression in 2001: A Space Odyssey, implied to also be HAL's first words. *Additionally, in Sunstorm, Athena is talking to her partner in space, Colonel Bud Tooke, shortly before she is expected to lose consciousness. Athena says to Bud, \\"I have always had the greatest enthusiasm for the mission\\", echoing HAL's words to Dave Bowman on the Discovery. *A character mentions that her daughter is working as a member of a team investigating a proposed space elevator. Space elevators play a major part in an earlier Clarke work The Fountains Of Paradise. *A lunar base named Clavius appears in both 2001 and Time's Eye.

Several countries have at different times nationalized part or all of their railway system. More recently, the international trend has been towards privatization. In some areas, notably Great Britain, resultant problems with track maintenance have led back to a more mixed solution, with a nationalised infrastructure operator but privately run train operating companies. National characteristics influenced the structures under which countries' rail networks developed. Some national railways were always under direct State management, some were State-planned but privately operated (as in France, others were wholly private enterprises lightly regulated (as in Great Britain, Ireland and Spain). Nationalization was therefore a bolder step to take in some countries than in others. While ideology has played a role, so too has the need for systematic reconstruction of vital infrastructure devastated by war, often following a period of State control over private companies initiated during the conflict. Russia Railroads in the Russian Empire were built by both the state and capitalists. After communist takeover the whole railway system was brought under the state control and remained being so after fall of the communist rule. Nowadays the Russian Railways state-owned company holds monopoly on this sphere of transportation. Argentina The Argentine railways developed with private British, Argentine and French capital and were nationalised by the state in 1948 during President Juan Per√≥n's first term of office and merged into the existing state-owned railways. In the 1990s, following Carlos Menem's neoliberal reforms, services were privatised through concession with infrastructure still belonging to the state. After a series of high-profile accidents and serious deterioration of services under privatisation, most rail lines have returned to state control by 2015, in effect re-nationalising them. Canada In Canada, the government took control of several railways that fell into bankruptcy following World War I, including the Canadian Northern Railway, the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway, and the Grand Trunk Railway. On December 20, 1918, the federal government created the Canadian National Railways (CNR), and placed the companies that it took control of under the CNR. Canadian National Railway was privatized in 1995. France In 1878, the French government took over ten small failing railway companies and established the Chemin de fer de l'√âtat. The company absorbed the Chemins de Fer de l'Ouest in 1908. In 1938, the French state took 51% ownership of the newly formed SNCF merging of France's five main railways (100% in 1982). Germany The earliest railways in the German states were often run by private entrepreneurs. Beginning in 1879, the Prussian government nationalized the major railways.Ing. M. Alberty, Der √úbergang zum Staatsbahnsystem in Preussen (Jena: Verlag von Gustav Fischer, 1911) After World War I, the German Reich took over control of the state railways of Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony, W√ºrttemberg, Baden, Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Hesse and Oldenburg. The individual railways were merged into the Deutsche Reichsbahn- Gesellschaft in February 1924.Verordnung √ºber die Schaffung eines Unternehmens \\"Deutsche Reichsbahn\\" vom 12. Februar 1924, RGBl. I Nr. 10, February 14, 1924, p. 57 The DRG was the largest publicly owned company in the world when the Nazis privatised it in 1937. In the lead up to, and during, World War II the DR assimilated a great number of railway companies in the German-occupied territories as well as several smaller, previously privately owned lines in Germany. Post-World War II, after being under Allied administration between 1945 and 1949, the DR was split up into the Deutsche Bundesbahn and Deutsche Reichsbahn of the GDR, both state-owned. Private railways continued to exist in the West German realm of the DB, but DB and DR accounted for most of the rail traffic in post-war Germany. After German reunification, DB and DR became Deutsche Bahn AG in 1994. Whilst DB AG is a public limited company, all its shares are presently owned by the government of the Federal Republic of Germany. DB AG is now facing stiff competition in the freight and short- distance passenger sector (the latter of which is subject to franchising), although they still hold a quasi-monopoly in the long-distance passenger sector (which does not receive subsidies), which was starting to crack until the opening of the long distance bus market destroyed the business case of any open access competition. The IPO, originally planned for 2008, has been postponed indefinitely and is currently not on the agenda of any major political party. India Indian Railways has been state owned since 1951. However in 2020, the Modi government announced plans to privatise some routes.https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/india/axe-of-privatisation-on- indian-railways-one-by-one-national-jewels-are-being-sold- off#:~:text=The%20latest%20'masterstroke'%20of%20the,be%20operated%20by%20private%20sectors.&text;=The%20private%20companies%20are%20free,any%20source%20of%20its%20choice. Ireland In Ireland C√≥ras Iompair √âireann was formed from the merger of the Great Southern Railways with the Dublin United Transport Company on 1 January 1945. Initially a private company limited by shares, CI√â was nationalized in 1950. The final privately owned mainline railway company on the island, the Great Northern Railway, was nationalized under joint control of the Irish and Northern Irish governments in 1953. It was wound up in 1958 and its assets split between CI√â and the UTA. Italy Following unification, the Italian Government entrusted the railways to five regional concessionaires. The arrangement did not work well and, long before it was due to expire, the railways were nationalized in 1905. The nationalized operator is known as Ferrovie dello Stato. Italy has an open access high-speed rail operator competing against the national railway; Nuovo Trasporto Viaggiatori which is part owned by SNCF and private investors. Japan In Japan, the Railway Nationalization Act of 1906 brought most of the country's private railway lines under public control. Between 1906 and 1907, of track were purchased from seventeen private railway companies. The national railway network grew to about of track, and private railways were relegated to providing local and regional services. In the 1980s the process of privatizing Japanese National Railways begun that is not entirely finished as of 2016 with both entirely state and private members of the JR Group. Spain After years of declining profitability, the national rail network was devastated by the Spanish Civil War. In 1941, the broad gauge railways were nationalized, as RENFE. The narrow gauge railways were also later nationalized; some of these have since been transferred to the autonomous regional governments where contained within a single region. The standard gauge high-speed lines were built as a state owned venture from the start. United Kingdom Rail Passengers in Great Britain from 1829‚Äì2019 In 1914, the railways were taken into Government control due to World War I, but were returned to the original owners in 1921, three years after the war had ended. However, in that same year, the government introduced the Railways Act 1921. This forced the 120 railway companies then operating to merge into just four. This grouping officially took place on 1 January 1923. The four railway companies formed from the grouping were: The Great Western Railway, the Southern Railway, the London and North Eastern Railway, and the London, Midland and Scottish Railway. In Britain during World War II, the railways were taken into State control. They were heavily damaged by enemy attacks and were run down aiding the war effort. After the war, the Transport Act 1947 provided for nationalizing the four major railways. On January 1, 1948, the railways were nationalized and British Railways was created, under the overall management of the British Transport Commission, later the British Railways Board. =Privatisation= British Rail was privatised between 1994 and 1997, involving the transfer to a series of private-sector operators of responsibility for the provision of services under contract. In all, more than 100 companies took over from British Rail. In 2001 the track operator Railtrack went bankrupt; it was reconstituted and renamed as Network Rail, a private company with no legal owner but effectively government-controlled via its constitution and financing. The United Kingdom government continues to invest in the railways, financing, for example, the acquisition of some InterCity rolling stock. The positive impact of privatization is disputed, with passengers numbers more than doubling (see graph) and increasing customer satisfaction balanced with worries about the level of rail subsidies and criticism of the fact that much of the system is now contracted out to subsidiaries owned by the state owned railways of France, Germany and the Netherlands. Only 20% of Southern trains arrived on time in the year from April 2015 to March 2016, and there was an ongoing industrial dispute over driver-only operated trains. In June 2016, amongst criticism of the performance of its services, Go-Ahead warned of lower than anticipated profits on its Govia Thameslink Railway franchises, leading to 18% drop in the Go- Ahead share price. =Northern Ireland= Railways in Northern Ireland were nationalized in the 1940s under the Ulster Transport Authority (UTA). The former LMS lines managed by the Northern Counties Committee, nationalized by the Westminster government, were sold to the UTA by the British Transport Commission in 1949. Unlike British Rail, the Northern Ireland Railways remain state owned. United States After the United States entered World War I in 1917, the country's railways proved inadequate to the task of supplying the nation's war effort. On 26 December 1917, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson nationalized most American railways under the Federal Possession and Control Act, creating the United States Railroad Administration (USRA). It took control of the railways on 28 December 1917, and introduced several reforms to increase efficiency and reduce costs. It standardized rolling stock and steam locomotive designs. The war ended in 1918. In March 1920, control of the railways was returned to their original owners. Freight operations and most of the track have remained private enterprises, even as the railroads were forced to restructure by changing markets in the post-World War II years. Due to changes in transportation after the construction of the interstate highway system in the postwar years and shift to trucking, railroads in the late 20th century went through widespread restructuring and reduction. Passenger traffic particularly had declined as more families owned and used private automobiles. Under President Richard Nixon, Amtrak was established to try to continue passenger operations by using existing tracks. It has been subsidized in order to continue service to some areas that had no alternative transportation, as well as to relieve congested roadways in more dense areas, as on the Northeast corridor. Amtrak subsequently bought some tracks from bankrupt railways as well as Conrail.

It is designated as Highway 7 in Yukon, and has no official highway number in British Columbia. It was built by the Canadian Army from 1950 to 1951, connecting the village of Atlin, British Columbia, with the Tagish Road just one mile west of the Alaska Highway at historic mile 866 (Jakes Corner). By the mid-1980s, the Yukon section had been improved, being wide and straight, while the B.C. section (which has no official highway number) was narrow, winding, with some less than optimum grades. Most of the section in B.C. runs along the eastern shore of Atlin Lake. By 2000, the B.C. section had been improved and partially paved, while there have been complaints about the Yukon section. By 2007 reconstruction had started on the Yukon section once again. The road has once again been widened and surfaced with a Bitumen Surface Treatment. The completion of the most recent reconstruction will be finished by 2016. By Spring 2014 only 5 km of road including two small bridges remain to be reconstructed. From Atlin, there are area roads both to the east and the south. As of October 2017, both the Yukon and British Columbia portions of the Atlin Road are in very good condition with very few potholes.

Its western terminus is located at the Turcot Interchange, a junction with Autoroute 15 and Autoroute 20, and its eastern terminus is near the Jacques Cartier Bridge (Route 134), where the highway merges with Notre-Dame Street. The Autoroute Ville-Marie designation is named after the downtown borough of Ville-Marie, through which the expressway is routed. Part of A-720 runs underground (below grade) through Downtown Montreal. This section begins from the west at Rue de la Montagne / Rue Atwater (exit 4) and remains underground almost all the way to its eastern end, except for a short section between Rue Saint-Urbain and Rue H√¥tel-de-Ville . The tunnelled section west of this gap is known as the Ville-Marie Tunnel, and the section east of it is known as Viger Tunnel. However, locals regard both tunnels as one, and the term Ville- Marie Tunnel is often used to refer to both tunnels. The Turcot Interchange, which is the western terminus of A-720, is currently undergoing a reconstruction project. Once completed, the A-720 will be downgraded from an autoroute to a national highway and renumbered Route 136. History The Ville-Marie Expressway near Old Montreal It was originally envisioned that Autoroute 20 would extend from the Turcot Interchange, along the route of the 720, to the Louis Hippolyte Lafontaine Bridge-Tunnel. Indeed, when the first section of the expressway was constructed and opened in the early 1970s, many Montrealers, anticipating that it would eventually replace the Metropolitan Expressway as the primary connector route to the Lafontaine Tunnel, and onward to Quebec City, dubbed the then-unnamed roadway the \\"Downtown Trans-Canada Highway\\". The provincial transport ministry (Le minist√®re des Transports du Qu√©bec, or MTQ) had planned to extend the Viger Tunnel east to Autoroute 25 at its Souligny Avenue interchange. The right-of-way has existed since the original layout of the A-720, and buildings along the extension were demolished at that time, even though the 720 was not completed due to cost constraints. The government of Montreal instead converted the portion of Rue Notre Dame east of the Jacques Cartier Bridge into a six-lane urban boulevard, rather than continue a sunken limited-access expressway. The final project was approved, and work began on Souligny Avenue to double the span of the travel lanes. In late July 2009, an A-720 westbound shield that was installed on this stretch. In 2007, working crews for Transports Qu√©bec discovered major cracks in a support pillar and closed several lanes of the expressway. Transports Quebec announced on August 10, 2007, major repair projects for a large section of the Expressway west of the Ville-Marie tunnel.Repairs In addition, the full reconstruction of the Turcot Interchange in the next several years will also affect portions of the 720. As of 2012, the 720 will be renamed Route 136 at the end of the reconstruction, which is due to be late 2019.Turcot Project (in French) On July 31, 2011, part of the roof of the Ville-Marie Tunnel collapsed, sending large chunks of concrete to the road below. This incident occurred at a time with little traffic and no vehicles were damaged. Several construction workers were on site at the time and were unharmed. The tunnel had to be closed for repair of the roof and several other parts of the tunnel. Transport Minister Sam Hamad announced on Friday, August 5 that the tunnel would re-open the following day.

Biography Chinese Civilians with Japanese Soldiers at Checkpoint (1937), a photograph by Victor Sassoon taken in Shanghai during the Second Sino-Japanese War Sir Ellice Victor Elias Sassoon was born 30 December 1881 in Naples, Italy while his family was en route to India. He was raised in England where he attended Harrow and Trinity College (Cambridge University). He was from a Baghdadi Jewish family who had made their fortune in the opium business. The family also had large holdings in the Indian cotton industry. Sir Victor served in the Royal Flying Corps in the First World War. He survived a plane crash in 1916 and sustained leg injuries that plagued him for the rest of his life. When his father died in 1924, Victor inherited his title and became 3rd Baronet of Bombay. He moved to India, where he managed his family's textile mills and served in the Indian Legislative Assembly. In the 1920s and 1930s, he transferred much of his wealth from India to Shanghai, China and contributed to a real estate boom there by investing millions of US dollars in the local economy. Sir Victor frequently travelled worldwide for business and pleasure and divided his time between Poona, India and Shanghai. He acquired the Cathay Land Company, the Cathay Hotel Company and at least 50 other companies. Sassoon built the Cathay Hotel (now the Peace Hotel) in 1929, and other large hotels, office buildings and residences, many in The Bund, a waterfront area in central Shanghai (including Hamilton House, Metropole Hotel and Embankment). At one time, he owned over 1,800 properties there. Sassoon endeavored to protect Western interests in the Orient and helped European Jews survive in the Shanghai Ghetto.http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/smu/00208/smu-00208.html Sir Victor Sassoon loved photography and opened a studio in Shimla first called Hamilton Studios. In 1928 he established his hobby and opened a studio in Bombay State at Ballard Estate by the same name as Hamilton Studios at E.D.Sassoon Building (one of his property), Ballard Estate, and all the negatives from Shimla were brought here, to Bombay, closing down that studio completely.He was also fond of horse racing, Chinese ivories, international friendships and travel. He counted members of the aristocracy and such Hollywood stars as Charlie Chaplin, Marlene Dietrich, Basil Rathbone and Bette Davis among his acquaintances. An accomplished photographer, he made many images of friends, and of local and foreign landscapes and created numerous photograph albums. He also illustrated his diaries with his own photographs. He lived in Shanghai until 1941, when due to China's war with Japan, he was forced to leave. After the Chinese Communist Revolution of 1949, he sold his business interests in China and relocated to Nassau, Bahamas.http://www.historynet.com/wartime- shanghai-a-tycoon-triumphs-over-the-emporer.htm During the 1950s Sassoon lived at his home on Cable Beach in Nassau. Late in life he married his American nurse, Evelyn Barnes (\\"Barnsie\\"), who remained in Nassau long after Sassoon's death in 1961. Lady Sassoon continued to provide support for the charity founded by her late husband to help Bahamian children, by hosting the black- tie Heart Ball each year over the Valentine's Day weekend. E.D. Sassoon & Co. On the death of his father in 1924, Sir Victor Sassoon inherited the trading house \\"E.D. Sassoon & Co. Limited\\". Set up in 1867, it had offices in Bombay (India) and Shanghai (China) and interests in Persian Gulf ports, Baghdad and Japan. The Company ran cotton mills in India and invested in property in the Far East. In 1928 Sir Victor Sassoon established the \\"E.D. Sassoon Banking Company Limited\\" as a subsidiary of \\"E. D. Sassoon and Company Limited\\", to coordinate the trading interests of his family.http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/things-to-do/visiting-the-city/archives- and-city-history/london-metropolitan-archives/news-and-events/Pages/Wallace- brothers.aspx In March 1930 E.D. Sassoon and Company Limited's new headquarters were opened at \\"Sassoon House\\" in Shanghai. The Second World War brought many changes to the E.D. Sassoon Group. Despite successful production rates, the firm decided to dispose of the mills in Bombay in 1943, fearing problems as foreign owners once independence was granted. In May 1949 Shanghai was under the control of a communist regime and seemed an unhealthy place for the company's head office, so this was transferred to Nassau in the Bahamas in 1950. It is thought that Nassau was chosen because there were no forms of personal or corporation tax in place and Sir Victor Sassoon planned to live there, which he did until his death in 1961.http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cgi- bin/vcdf/detail?coll_id=19594&inst;_id=118&nv1;=browse&nv2;=place \\"E.D.

In 1925 he purchased the Bungalow Stud, founded 1851 in Cambridgeshire not far from the Newmarket Racecourse. He renamed it Eve Stud Ltd. as he was known to his intimates as 'Eve'- a contraction of his first two names, Ellice Victor. The mastermind behind Sir Victor's racing success in Britain was trainer Sir Noel Murless who became manager of Eve Stud in 1952. He purchased the property from Sir Victor's widow in 1970 and gave it the name Woodditton Stud. Sir Noel continued the practice of standing stallions there, including the top-class racehorses Connaught and Welsh Pageant. The stallion tradition was maintained when the stud was purchased again in 1981 by Mr Yong Nam-Seng of Singapore, being home to Damister and, for a short time, his champion son Celtic Swing, as well as Bin Ajwaad, Superlative and Sayf el Arab. After 20 years of ownership, during which time he expanded the stud to 185 acres, Mr Yong Nam- Seng, a steward of the Singapore Jockey Club and former chairman of the Australasian Racing Conference, sold Woodditton Stud in November 2001 to its present owner Darley Stud Management and it is now used as a rest and recuperation facility.http://www.darley.co.jp/about-us/inside-darley/history- woodditton-stud Sassoon purchased Beech House Stud from Martin H. Benson in 1960 and along with Eve Stud it became part of Sassoon Studs Incorporated managed by Murless. Sassoon's wife sold the Sassoon Studs to Louis Freedman in 1971. Among Sir Victor Sassoons stables' significant performances were wins in The Derby (Pinza, Crepello, Hard Ridden, St. Paddy) Epsom Oaks, 1,000 Guineas, 2,000 Guineas, St. Leger Stakes, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. Family On the death of his father Edward Elias Sassoon in 1924, Sir Victor Sassoon became the 3rd Baronet of Bombay. Late in life, in 1959, he married his American nurse, Evelyn Barnes (\\"Barnsie\\"). He had no issue and the baronetcy became extinct. He was related by marriage to the Mocatta family and he himself was a Sephardic Jew. One of his former employees, Lawrence Kadoorie (later the Lord Kadoorie), later founded the Hong Kong-based utility company China Light and Power. One of his right-hand men in Shanghai was Gordon Currie who was put into a concentration camp by the Japanese and remained there for several years.

The CJSR studios are located in the Students' Union Building of the University of Alberta, while its transmitter is located atop the building. CJSR is a volunteer-run campus and community radio station with a stated mission, \\"to enlighten and entertain our audience through high quality and diverse programming that constantly challenges the status quo.\\"  Programming  CJSR plays a diverse range of musical genres and spoken-word programming. The station is home to nationally syndicated shows like Terra Informa, and was the home of the early version of Science for the People (podcast). It is subject to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission's requirements for community-based campus stations which means, among other things, that: * 25% of its programming must be spoken-word programming, * no more than 10% of the music it broadcasts can be \\"hit\\" music (as defined by the CRTC), * 35% of the music it broadcasts must be \\"Canadian content\\" (as defined by the CRTC). CJSR operates a 900 watt transmitter, broadcasting throughout Edmonton, Alberta and the surrounding area. Since 2000 the station's broadcasts have also been available via streaming audio.  Governance  CJSR's broadcast license is held by the First Alberta Campus Radio Association (FACRA), which is funded by a mix of fees assessed to students at the University of Alberta (under the auspices of the taxation powers of the University of Alberta Students' Union and the Graduate Students' Association), donations from listeners, and limited advertising revenue. In 2005, FACRA became a registered charity. The station is also a member of the National Campus and Community Radio Association.  History  CKUA, CJSR's earlier incarnation, was the first campus radio broadcast in Western Canada. CJSR has its roots in the Alberta Student Radio Directorate (later known as the Radio Society) which started in 1946 when CKUA left the campus. By 1967, closed circuit Radio Society broadcasts were heard at various buildings on the U of A campus. In 1970, CKSR was born: a \\"seat of the pants\\" radio station that broadcast a weak FM signal to the U of A and anyone else who could pick it up. CKSR eventually became CJSR in 1978. FACRA was formed as a partnership between the University of Alberta Students' Union (which collected a levy from students on the station's behalf) and the Friends of CJSR Society (which solicited listener donations and which held the station's capital assets). In 2002 the latter entity was disbanded over concerns of overlapping jurisdiction and because a legal opinion stated that having the station's capital assets held by an entity other than the one holding the broadcast license and employing staff would be unlikely to protect those assets in the event of a lawsuit, and its assets transferred to FACRA. CJSR became a full broadcast station in 1984.  Awards  In 2014, CJSR was recognized at the Edmonton Mayor's Celebration for the Arts with the John Poole Award for Promotion of the Arts.

The original title of the song was KƒÅua I Ka Huahua ªi or \\"We Two in the Spray.\\" It was not written as a chant, and the Hawaiian lyrics describe a clandestine meeting between two lovers, not a battle. The English title therefore has nothing to do with the song as it was originally written and performed in Hawaii. History Under the original title, the song was recorded around June 1911 by the Crowel Glee Club, and released by Columbia Records. English lyrics by Ralph Freed were written in 1936 and the melody changed somewhat at that time by Johnny Noble. Tommy Dorsey recorded it on November 29, 1938, and it was released on Victor Records in the United States and Canada. In a 1942 performance, Dorsey's band featured drummer Buddy Rich and trumpeter Ziggy Elman for this song. The song was featured in the 1942 film Ship Ahoy starring Eleanor Powell, Red Skelton and the Tommy Dorsey Band. The song features prominently in Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room, a Disney theme park attraction that first opened at Disneyland in 1963. Spike Jones recorded the song for Victor Records in February 1946 with Carl Grayson on vocal. It reached number eight on the charts, according to Joel Whitburn.

The name refers to a mystical island, visible on the horizon but not reachable, and was originally inspired by the sight of Ambae island from neighboring Espiritu Santo in Vanuatu, where author James Michener was stationed in World War II. In South Pacific In the musical, Bali Ha'i is a volcanic island within sight of the island on which most of the action takes place. The troops think of Bali Ha‚Äôi as an exotic paradise, but it is off-limits‚Äîexcept to officers. The matriarch of Bali Ha'i, Bloody Mary, conducts much business with the troops, and she meets Lt. Joseph Cable soon after he arrives. She sings to him her mysterious song \\"Bali Ha'i\\", with its haunting orchestral accompaniment, because she wants to entice him to visit her island. She doesn‚Äôt tell him that she wants him to meet, and fall in love with, her young daughter, Liat. Resemblance to score for Bride of Frankenstein Several commentators have noted that the opening melody of Bali Ha'i bears a resemblance to the \\"bride motif\\" in Franz Waxman's musical score for the 1935 film Bride of Frankenstein. The two melodies share an identical three-note pattern. Cover versions Several versions of the showtune made the bestsellers list in 1949. Perry Como's version was the most successful at #5. Other versions appearing on the charts were by Paul Weston and his Orchestra (#10), Bing Crosby (recorded March 10, 1949) (#12), Peggy Lee (#13), and Frank Sinatra (#18). Later, Harry James released a version on his 1955 album, Jazz Session (Columbia CL 669); Andy Williams released a version on his 1958 album, Andy Williams Sings Rodgers and Hammerstein; and Sergio Franchi included this song on his 1965 RCA Victor tribute to The Songs of Richard Rodgers.Sergio Frenchi's The Songs of Richard Rodgers at discogs.com Connections to actual islands \\"Bali Ha'i\\" was based on the real island of Ambae (formerly Aoba Island). Ambae is located in Vanuatu (known as New Hebrides at the time the song was written). Ambae is visible on the horizon from Espiritu Santo island, where James A. Michener was stationed in World War II. Michener referred to the island in his book, Tales of the South Pacific, which is the basis for the musical South Pacific. The author used the tranquil, hazy image of the smoothly sloping island on the horizon to represent a not-so-distant but always unattainable place of innocence and happiness. Hence the longing nature of the song. In his memoir, The World Is My Home (1992), Michener writes of his time in the Treasury Islands: \\"On a rude signboard attached to a tree, someone had affixed a cardboard giving the settlement's name, and it was so completely different from ordinary names, so musical to my ear that I borrowed a pencil and in a soggy notebook jotted the name against the day when I might want to use it for some purpose I could not then envisage: Bali-ha'i.\\" In the 1958 film adaptation, Bali Ha'i is portrayed by the real-life island of Tioman in Malaysia. However, the scene was filmed on the north shore of Kauai; Mount Makana was used as Bali Hai and is still known as Bali Hai today. Tunnel's Beach is often referred to as \\"Nurses' Beach\\", and the scene where Bloody Mary sings \\"Bali Ha'i\\" is set on Hanalei Bay. Influence on popular culture Mr. Bali Hai is the name of a mixed drink that originated at the Bali Hai restaurant on Shelter Island in California. Bali Hai is the brand name for a beer produced by Bali Hai Brewery in Indonesia. Italian Swiss Colony produced the \\"pop wine\\" Bali Hai wine in the 20th century. In the 2016 Better Call Saul episode of the same name, Saul Goodman sings this song to his romantic interest Kim Wexler.

The arts and cultural center takes its name from the amusement park. Located roughly northwest of downtown Washington, D.C., the site of Glen Echo Park was originally conceived and developed as a National Chautauqua Assembly in 1891. Following the foreclosure and sale of the Chautauqua grounds in 1903, leisure facilities were then developed for the growing population of Washington, D.C. In 1911, the site was significantly expanded to become Glen Echo Amusement Park, which operated continuously until its closure in 1968. Today Glen Echo Park is one of the more important cultural resources in the Washington, D.C. area, offering hundreds of classes, workshops and performances in the visual and performing arts. The facility is well known for its Art Deco architecture, an antique Dentzel carousel, a historic Spanish Ballroom, as well as its children's theaters, social dance programs, and many public festivals, including Family Day and the Washington Folk Festival. Each year more than 400,000 people attend events and participate in instructional activities at the park. The National Park Service also offers park history tours and maintains a visitors area. History =Chautauqua= Edwin and Edward Baltzley, inventors, industrialists, and real estate developers, hoped to build upon the banks of the Potomac River a suburban community free of the urban pollution of late-nineteenth century Washington. In order to compete with other suburban developments, the Baltzley brothers planned a series of opulent attractions for their would-be community.'A Throng at Glen Echo,' \\"Washington Post\\", May 21, 1891; Richard Cook & Deborah Lange, \\"Glen Echo Park: A Story of Survival\\", Bethesda: Bethesda Communication Group, 2000, 4-8; 'Glen Echo Park Historic Structures Report', National Park Service, Department of the Interior, 1987, III-1 to III-8. On February 24, 1891, the Baltzley brothers incorporated the National Chautauqua of Glen Echo, the 53rd such assembly, and immediately set to building a stone citadel of culture to complement their real estate and resort enterprises.'Report of the Women's Executive Committee,' \\"The National Chautauqua of Glen Echo\\", Washington, DC: 1891; Richard Cook & Deborah Lange, \\"Glen Echo Park: A Story of Survival\\", Bethesda: Bethesda Communication Group, 2000, 11-15. Opened on June 16, 1891, their arts and culture program included lectures and concerts in a 6,000-seat amphitheater; special classes in Bible studies, Greek, and Hebrew; physical training regimens; and university extension courses. Hundreds flocked to the site to picnic, attend lectures on American history by Jane Meade Welch, courses on ancient Egypt by Lysander Dickerman, and concerts by John Philip Sousa and his band.'Report of the Women's Executive Committee,' \\"The National Chautauqua of Glen Echo\\", Washington, DC: 1891; 'The Glen Echo Chautauqua', \\"Washington Post\\", June 21, 1891; 'Glen Echo Advertisement', \\"Washington Post\\", May 12, 1891; 'At Glen Echo Today', \\"Washington Post\\", June 16, 1891. Clara Barton, encouraged by the Baltzleys, not only located her home and the American Red Cross headquarters at Glen Echo, but she presided over the Women's Executive Committee for the Chautauqua itself.Elizabeth Prior, \\"Clara Barton: Professional Angel\\", Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1987, 263-265. The inaugural season's success warranted an extension well into August.'Ho For Glen Echo!', \\"Washington Post\\", July 29, 1891. Failure By the spring of 1892 the various Baltzley enterprises were gravely in debt. On April 7, 1892, the Glen Echo Sand and Building Company, a Baltzley subsidiary, borrowed a large sum of money giving the Chautauqua site as collateral. This was one of many Baltzley mortgages on the site. The financial difficulties spread to the Glen Echo Railroad Company, yet another Baltzley enterprise, which, because of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the adjacent Washington Aqueduct system, had failed to bring the much anticipated street car service to the Chautauqua site and Glen Echo Village.'Glen Echo Park Historic Structures Report', National Park Service, Department of the Interior, 1987, III-40 to III-54; 'Glen Echo Road to be Sold at Auction', \\"Washington Post\\", June 23, 1895. Compounding their overextended credit, the Baltzley brothers found themselves the victim of common rumor. At the beginning of the 1892 season, rumor had spread throughout Washington that Glen Echo was rampant with malaria.Richard Cook & Deborah Lange, \\"Glen Echo Park: A Story of Survival\\", Bethesda: Bethesda Communication Group, 2000, 30. Regardless of the validity of these accusations, when combined with the brother's precarious finances, the Chautauqua site fell into disuse.Richard Cook & Deborah Lange, \\"Glen Echo Park: A Story of Survival\\", Bethesda: Bethesda Communication Group, 2000, 30-33; 'Glen Echo's Future', \\"Washington Post\\", July 19, 1896. =Amusement park= Park Entrance In the early 20th century the Chautauqua site was turned into an amusement park named Glen Echo Park. The amusement park was one of the larger establishments of its type in the Washington, D.C. area, and was very popular well into the late 1940s. By the mid-1950s, however, attendance began to decline due to the growing popularity of larger regional theme parks, such as Disneyland. Another blow to the park occurred in 1960 when the trolley line from Washington, D.C. ceased operation. The amusement park managed to continue operations for a few more years, but was finally closed after the 1968 season. Segregation at the amusement park Like many public facilities in and around the Washington area, Glen Echo Park was restricted to whites for 63 out of the first 70 years of its history. On June 30, 1960, to draw attention to the continuing segregation, a group of college students (primarily from Howard University)Glen Echo Park - Frequently Asked Questions (U.S. National Park Service) staged a sit-in protest on the carousel. Five African American students were subsequently arrested for trespassing. The arrests were appealed to the Supreme Court four years later, and the convictions were reversed in Griffin v. Maryland on the grounds that the state had unconstitutionally used its police power to help a private business enforce its racial discrimination policy. This led to an eleven-week civil rights campaign against Park policies with students and residents of the nearby Bannockburn community joining together to demand change. As a result, the park opened its doors to all races for the 1961 season.The Washington Post, Protest on a Sculpted Horse (June 29, 2004) In 1966 on the day after Easter, bus transportation was shut down when race protests broke out. Carousel The last operating park ride, and one of the highlights of the park today, is a 1921 Dentzel menagerie carousel with 38 horses, 2 chariots, 4 rabbits, 4 ostriches, a lion, a tiger, a giraffe, and a prancing deer. A Wurlitzer style 165 Band Organ (formerly a Wurlitzer style 153 band organ), provides the carousel's music. In its heyday the carousel sported an operating brass ring, in which daring riders could reach out and pull a ring out of a holder next to the carousel. Grabbing a brass ring would win the lucky rider a free ride. The brass ring arm is still visible today, although it no longer operates. The face of the carousel had changed greatly since 1921, with the animals, rounding boards, inner drum panels, and band organ receiving several new coats of paint over the years. An installation photograph from 1921, as compared to the carousel in 1983, showed an original design of the body and tack on the Indian horse that was very different from the present-day animal. Chipping away at the horse's paint revealed several strata of differently colored and styled paint jobs spanning the past sixty years, with the original 1921 paint at the bottom. The carousel was restored by specialist Rosa Ragan, who has restored several other carousels in the United States. She restored the Indian horse by removing the park paint, exposing as much of the original paint as possible, and filling in the gaps in the original paint, a process called inpainting, before covering the horse in a protective varnish. This process, however, exposed the original paint to damage from riders, thus rendering the horse unrideable. In order to restore each animal without risking damage to the original paint, Ragan developed a new process of uncovering the original paint job, recording the colors and design, and then covering the original paint with a reversible varnish before giving the animal a white base coat and repainting it in the original colors. However, Ragan did leave a small window of original paint exposed on each animal for riders to find. These glimpses of the original 1921 paint are called \\"windows to the past\\" and can be found on the plain side (the inward-facing side) of each animal. Ragan's 20-year restoration of the carousel completely overhauled the animals, the band organ, and the rounding boards and drum panels, returning the carousel to its original beauty and splendor. The carousel was in a scene in the 1989 comedy Chances Are starring Robert Downey Jr. and Cybill Shepherd. The carousel was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Incidents at Glen Echo Park *June 23, 1918: The first fatality at the amusement park occurred when Joseph J. Hamel, a 43 year old stone cutter from Washington, fell from a roller-coaster (known as Gravity Railway) car while sitting on an armrest, due to overcrowding. Hamel was rushed to Georgetown Hospital but died the next day. * May 5, 1989, during a Friday night contra dance, the rain-swollen Minnehaha Creek overflowed its banks, and an estimated 25 vehicles were swept from the main parking lot toward the Potomac River, some of them actually ending up in the river. More than 50 vehicles were destroyed. The ultimate cause of the flash flood was a 5\\" rainfall upstream, at a different location than the park. =Management by National Park Service= Since 1971, Glen Echo Park has been part of the National Park Service. Various renovations, backed by government funds and individual donations, have been undertaken throughout the park, notably the Spanish Ballroom, the Arcade building that now hosts art classes and art studios, and the art deco style neon sign. Arts and cultural center =Management by Glen Echo Park Partnership for Arts and Culture= Glen Echo Park is managed by the Glen Echo Park Partnership for Arts and Culture in cooperation with Montgomery County, Maryland, and the National Park Service. Established by Montgomery County in 2002, the Partnership is a nonprofit organization charged with managing Glen Echo Park's arts programs and facilities, including its historic buildings. The Partnership's mission is to present vibrant artistic, cultural, and educational offerings at the Park and to promote the Park as a unique destination for the region's diverse population. In collaboration with Montgomery County and the National Park Service, the Partnership works with resident artists and organizations to develop distinctive arts programming; operates the historic Dentzel carousel and the Spanish Ballroom; presents an extensive social dance program; produces festivals and special events; conducts fundraising and marketing; and manages and maintains all facilities. =Resident arts programs= Glen Echo Park is home to thirteen resident artists and arts organizations. The resident artists and organizations offer classes, concerts, exhibitions, open studios hours, workshops, and lectures. Resident programs and artists include: Adventure Theatre MTC, Art Glass Center at Glen Echo, Glen Echo Glassworks, Glen Echo Pottery, J. Jordan Bruns, Photoworks, Playgroup in the Park, the Puppet Co., SilverWorks, Glen Echo Park Aquarium, Washington Conservatory of Music, Yellow Barn Studio & Gallery, and Young Creative Spirit. At the culmination of Contrastock 2011, dance caller Nils Fredland whips the crowd into a frenzy, beckons them up to the stage, and dives into the spontaneous mosh pit. =Special events and concerts= The park hosts several family festivals and special events throughout the year, including Family Day (when the carousel opens for the season), Then & Wow, Labor Day Art Show, Irish Music and Dance Showcase, Washington Folk Festival, Fall Frolic, Contrastock, an extensively- decorated Halloween dance, inaugural balls, and Winter's Eve. From June through August, the Glen Echo Park Partnership presents a free summer concert series each Thursday night in the Bumper Car Pavilion. =Social dancing= Contra dancers at a Friday night dance in the Spanish Ballroom Glen Echo Park offers a broad array of social dance events and classes as part of its standard programs. There are regular dances and classes in waltz, swing, contra, and salsa. Dances take place in the historic Spanish Ballroom, the Bumper Car Pavilion, and the recently renovated, climate-controlled Ballroom Annex (The Back Room). Approximately 60,000 people attend Glen Echo Park's dances each year. A $19 million renovation of the Spanish Ballroom in 2003 returned it to its original splendor, giving it continued prominence as one of the premiere sites for dancing in the Washington DC area. The 18-month renovation was preceded by a National Park Service led, volunteer-labor makeover of the deteriorating Bumper Car Pavilion, converting it into an all- weather dance pavilion & band shell, for uninterrupted dancing through the renovation. Currently, it remains in use as an alternative dance venue and for private events, such as wedding receptions. All social dances are open to the public, for all ages, with no prior experience or partner required. All dances offer an introductory lesson before the dance begins and most include live music. Alcohol is prohibited on park grounds, and smoking is prohibited in all buildings.  Images  Pictures of Glen Echo Park are available on Wikimedia Commons.

History Buko halo, a combination of halo-halo and buko salad, usually served directly on coconut shells Halo-halo is believed to be an indigenized version of the Japanese kakigori class of desserts, originating from pre-war Japanese migrants into the islands. The earliest versions were composed only of cooked red beans or mung beans in crushed ice with sugar and milk, a dessert known locally as \\"mongo-ya\\". Over the years, more native ingredients were added, resulting in the development of the modern halo-halo. Some authors specifically attribute it to the 1920s or 1930s Japanese migrants in the Quinta Market of Quiapo, Manila, due to its proximity to the now defunct Insular Ice Plant, which was the source of the city's ice supply. The spelling \\"halo-halo\\" (popularized by Chowking) is considered incorrect by the Commission on the Filipino Language, which prescribes \\"haluhalo\\". The word is an adjective meaning \\"mixed\\" in Tagalog, a reduplication of the verb halo (\\"to mix\\"). Description Halo- halo made in San Diego County, California. The ingredients for halo-halo can vary widely, but they usually include sugar palm fruit (kaong), coconut sport (macapuno), saba plantains cooked in syrup (minatamis na saging), jackfruit (langk√¢), agar jellies (gulaman), tapioca pearls, nata de coco, sweet potato (kamote), sweetened beans, cheese, and pounded toasted young rice (pinipig), among others. Most of the ingredients (fruits, beans, and other sweets) are first placed at the bottom, followed by the shaved ice. This is then topped with either (or a combination of) leche flan, ube halaya (mashed purple yam), or ube ice cream (sometimes vanilla). Evaporated milk is poured into the mixture upon serving. A similar Visayan dessert binignit is also referred to as \\"ginataang halo-halo\\" in Tagalog (\\"halo-halo in coconut milk\\"), commonly shortened to \\"ginataan\\". It is made with mostly the same ingredients, although the latter is usually served hot. In popular culture Halo-halo was featured as a Quickfire Challenge dish in the seventh episode of the fourth season of the American reality television series Top Chef. The halo-halo, which featured avocado, mango, kiwi, and nuts, was prepared by Filipino- American contestant Dale Talde and named as one of the top three Quickfire Challenge dishes by guest judge Johnny Iuzzini of Jean Georges. Talde also made the dish in a later episode. Halo-halo was featured in an episode of Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown when its host Anthony Bourdain visited a Jollibee branch in Los Angeles. Bourdain praised the dessert and even posted a photo of Jollibee's halo-halo on his Twitter account, which he described as \\"oddly beautiful.\\" The dessert was featured on a Delicious Destinations edition episode of Bizarre Foods.Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern#Season 18 - Delicious Destinations (Season 3.29 See also * Ais kacang/ABC * Cendol * Ice buko * Ice scramble * Kakigori * Ma√≠z con hielo * Patbingsu * Saba con hielo * Sorbetes References Further reading * External links * Halo-halo * Halo-Halo: Business & Recipe for Success Category:Philippine desserts Category:Ice-based desserts Category:Tagalog words and phrases Category:Foods containing coconut Category:Japanese cuisine ","title":"Halo-halo"},{"id":"2089947","text":"Gananda is a small \\"master planned community\\" (and census-designated place) located in Wayne County, New York, about twenty minutes outside of the city of Rochester, New York.

The state of New York created a new school district for the planned city, Gananda Central School District which had the unique ability to lease school facilities allowing for normal educational usage during school hours and community usage after hours. Today, the Gananda Central School District continues to serve approximately 1,200 students. Financial difficulties The new city had its flag raising ceremony on September 20, 1973 with the school system operating out of the first of the completed educational and community facilities at 1500 Dayspring Ridge. The first graduating class from the new school system was the Class of 1974. By this point much of the underground infrastructure (water, power, gas, cable television and telephone) had been laid and work on major roadways was on schedule. Problems arose when the company in charge of building the new community, Gananda Development Corporation, ran into financial difficulties in the first and second quarters of 1973. The corporation did not meet liquidity requirements set out by HUD and applied for an additional $14,000,000 guaranty as it would be completely bankrupt by the first quarter of 1975 without the infusion. This was in addition to the original $22,000,000 guaranty from HUD. With the end of 1974 came the end of the City of Gananda. HUD denied any additional funding for Gananda and sold back all but of the proposed city. Remnants of the City of Gananda When HUD finished terminating its interests in the project in 1977 the completed structures from the new city were one of the educational and community facilities, one of the community pools, one of the community parks, underground infrastructure (Electric, Water, Sewer, Gas and Cable TV) and a water treatment facility. The original educational and community facility housed the entire K-12 school system until the 1980s when Richard Mann Elementary was built on the site of the former community garden at 1366 Waterford Road. After renovations the HUD-financed facility contained grades 6-12 until the early 2000s, when the completion of Ruben A. Cirillo high school meant that the original building would only house grades 6-8 and the District offices. The single completed community pool was at 3290 Wildflower Drive and was operated by the community until the early 1990s when financial difficulties caused the property to be sold to the YMCA of Greater Rochester. It operated as a YMCA facility until the early 2000s when it shut down for the last time. The pool and original pool building still exist though now as part of a private residence. The community did not lose access to a public pool though as the opening of Ruben A. Cirillo high school also brought about major renovations and additions to Richard Mann Elementary, one of which was an indoor pool open to the public. The only completed public park was Fox Tail Park, located in the center of the area Wildflower drive encircles. It originally contained a full playground and sports fields of which only the sports fields remain (presently used by the Middle School). The playground was removed in the early 1990s for a new parking lot and gym addition on the present-day Middle school. In addition to these buildings, Gananda is still unique from its neighboring towns in the sense that all utility lines are buried underground whereas once one leaves Gananda utilities are once again carried above ground by utility poles. When HUD discontinued its financial backing of the project the roadbed for both sides of a four-lane Gananda Parkway had already been constructed from Eddy Road to almost Walworth/Penfield Road, State Route 441 (itself slated to have been widened to a four-lane highway had the City of Gananda ever come to fruition). However, with funding from the original project gone, only one side was completed which forms the current Gananda Parkway. The roadbed for the other side of the original four-lane Gananda Parkway is still visible in person as well as via Satellite imagery and an easement still exists if population growth ever warrants its completion.

Critical reception In 2005, Stoosh was ranked number 367 in Rock Hard magazine's book of The 500 Greatest Rock & Metal Albums of All Time. Track listing Skin gave a track-by-track guide to Select: # Yes It's Fucking Political \\"The main criticism we have had is that you can't mix politics and music, which seems like quite a fascist idea from music journalists. This song is about how everything is fucking political, and we'll always have that element to our music.\\" # All I Want \\"We wrote this song in America. We just kept bumping into these people whose only religion was money. It's a song about greed. It's not typical of Americans ‚Äì just people who like hanging around bands.\\" # She's My Heroine \\"There's quite a few melancholic songs on this album, like this one. This is a song about how some things that you think are really good for you can also really fuck you up. I discovered this with someone I used to go out with.\\" # Infidelity (Only You) \\"The title is what it is about. We have a string quartet on a few songs on this album, which was arranged by Michael McKeegan, who works with Therapy?. He also plays cello and he's fantastic.\\" # Hedonism (Just Because It Feels Good) \\"This is one of my favourite lyrics on the album, just because it is so simple but says so much. As a band, you are forced into so many situations where you are pushed to just have a good time all the time, and you sometimes have to take a step back and see what success is doing to you.\\" # Twisted (Everyday Hurts) \\"I'm really not sure what this song is about! I wrote it while I was in a bad situation and, now I'm out of it, the song means something different. The lyrics are quite depressive, which goes against the whole happy groove of the music. It's a bit of an oxymoron.\\" # We Love Your Apathy \\"This song is about how we keep voting in the same piece-of-shit government, and how the Labour Party are condoning this apathy. I always vote, though. I like to have a voice, even if it is a tactical vote.\\" # Brazen (Weep) \\"This opens with quite a demonic laugh, which fits in with the dark, violent mood of the song. Like 'Twisted', this is about the extremely sad situation I was in.\\" # Pickin' on Me \\"We have never done a song with just guitar and vocals before, but it works well on this song. It was inspired by someone I knew at school who really wound me up and was always up the teacher's arse. You just knew he was going to grow up to be a policeman, and he did. It's about how racism really starts in the classroom.\\" # Milk Is My Sugar \\"This is a fucking disgusting song about sex. My mum asked me what it's about and I said breakfast and she believed me. I bet some squirmy little bastard will show her a copy of Select now!\\" # Glorious Pop Song \\"This song was originally called 'You're Still A Strange One'. It was so poppy that we got worried that the record company would release it and that we would become known for it, like Extreme did with 'More Than Words'. When we recorded it, we covered it with swear words, so it will never be a single.\\"Select, November 1996 Hidden tracks The album contains a number of hidden tracks and surprises for the listener. The first is hidden before the start of track 1, it is an instrumental mix of the song \\"100 ways to be a good girl\\" taken from the first album. After track 3, 7 and 9 there is a short jam (lasting between 0:35 and 1:30; altogether 3:39) which can be accessed directly by rewinding from tracks 4, 8, and 10 respectively. Technically it exists in the pause between the end of one track and the beginning of another. CD players can sometimes be seen counting down to zero while they play these hidden tracks. Some rippers will often append these hidden tracks to the end of the previous song. The final track, \\"Glorious Pop Song\\", ends at 3:43 and is followed by two seconds of silence followed by a recorded conversation which is mostly laughter that lasts for around 30 seconds.

Such regulations may also require utility companies to reconnect customers during those periods. Several U.S. states have such rules, including Kansas, Minnesota, and Missouri. The protection provided by a cold weather rule may not be automatic, and poor customers may have to register with their service provider to indicate either a complete inability to pay or to set up a special payment plan. In Minnesota, the rule is in effect between October 15 and April 15 of the next year, and requires reconnection of electricity and/or natural gas depending on which energy sources are necessary for heat. The state's Public Utilities Commission doesn't regulate liquefied petroleum gas or oil, so those services may not be provided. However, if an LP- or oil-fired heater requires electricity in order to function, the rule requires electrical service to be reconnected. In addition to providing warmth for residents, cold weather rules help prevent damage to homes. Wintertime temperatures can freeze Water pipes, potentially causing bursts in the lines as the water inside expands as it turns into ice.

The tournament is one of the many South American club competitions that have been organised by CONMEBOL. As through the successive editions of this cup were added new champions from the Copa Libertadores, in 1997 the Conmebol decided that the last teams of each group would descend to reduce the number of teams to disputed it. That year descended Velez Sarsfield, Racing Club and Boca Juniors (all teams from Argentina) and Gremio (Brazil). The competition was discontinued to make way for the Copa Mercosur and Copa Merconorte in 1998, which also grew in importance after the final season of the Copa CONMEBOL in 1999. These tournaments were also discontinued in favor of the Copa Sudamericana which allowed the revival of the Recopa Sudamericana. Prior to its abolition, the Supercopa Libertadores was regarded as the second most prestigious South American club competition out of the three major tournaments. behind the Copa Libertadores and ahead of the Copa CONMEBOL. The winner of the tournament played the winner of the Copa Libertadores in the Recopa Sudamericana. Since the abolition of the Supercopa, the Recopa Sudamericana place previously reserved for the Supercopa winner has been taken by the winner of the Copa Sudamericana. The last champion of the competition was River Plate, while Cruzeiro and Independiente are the most successful clubs in the cup history, having won the tournament two times each. The cup has been won by eight different clubs and won consecutively by Cruzeiro and Independiente. History Format and rules The format for the Supercopa Libertadores underwent changes nearly every season. The most common reason behind it was the addition of a new Copa Libertadores winner. The only way to participate in the Supercopa was being a past winner of the Copa Libertadores. Vasco da Gama was later admitted into the competition as winners of the Copa Libertadores' predecessor, the Campeonato Sudamericano de Campeones. The tournament has been predominantly a single-elimination tournament with several stages. Every round of the competition was contested over a two-legged tie. The teams accumulate points as per the results of the match (3 for a win, 1 for a draw, 0 for a loss). The team with more points after both legs advanced to the next round. Unlike European club competitions, South America did not use extra time to decide a tie that was level on aggregate. Ties in points would be broken first by goal difference, and ultimately by a penalty shootout after the culmination of the second leg.

The phrase expresses the belief that constitutional restrictions on governmental power must be balanced against the need for survival of the state and its people. It is most often attributed to Abraham Lincoln, as a response to charges that he was violating the United States Constitution by suspending habeas corpus during the American Civil War. Although the phrase echoes statements made by Lincoln, and although versions of the sentiment have been advanced at various times in American history, the precise phrase \\"suicide pact\\" was first used in this context by Justice Robert H. Jackson in his dissenting opinion in Terminiello v. Chicago, a 1949 free speech case decided by the U.S. Supreme Court. The phrase also appears in the same context in Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, a 1963 U.S. Supreme Court decision written by Justice Arthur Goldberg.  Jefferson's formulation  Thomas Jefferson offered one of the earliest formulations of the sentiment, although not of the phrase. In 1803, Jefferson's ambassadors to France arranged the purchase of the Louisiana territory in conflict with Jefferson's personal belief that the Constitution did not bestow upon the federal government the right to acquire or possess foreign territory. Due to political considerations, however, Jefferson disregarded his constitutional doubts, signed the proposed treaty, and sent it to the Senate for ratification. In justifying his actions, he later wrote: > A strict observance of the written law is doubtless one of the high duties > of a good citizen, but it is not the highest. The laws of necessity, of > self-preservation, of saving our country when in danger, are of higher > obligation. To lose our country by a scrupulous adherence to the written > law, would be to lose the law itself, with life, liberty, property and all > those who are enjoying them with us; thus absurdly sacrificing the ends to > the means.Jefferson, Writings (Washington Ed. of 1853), vol. 5, p. 542. Lincoln's suspension of habeas corpus Under the United States Constitution, habeas corpus can be suspended in cases of rebellion or invasion. The Confederacy was rebelling, thus suspension of habeas corpus was both legal and constitutional‚Äîbut only if done by Congress, since the Constitution reserves this power under Article I, which pertains solely to congressional powers; Lincoln, meanwhile, usurped the power under his own executive order. After habeas corpus was suspended by General Winfield Scott in one theater of the Civil War in 1861, Lincoln did write that Scott \\"could arrest, and detain, without resort to ordinary processes and forms of law, such individuals as he might deem dangerous to public safety.\\" After Chief Justice Roger B. Taney attacked the president for this policy, Lincoln responded in a Special Session to Congress on July 4, 1861 that an insurrection \\"in nearly one-third of the States had subverted the whole of the laws . . . Are all the laws, but one, to go unexecuted, and the government itself go to pieces, lest that one be violated?\\" Later in the war, after some had criticized the arrest and detention of Congressman Clement Vallandigham of Ohio, Lincoln wrote to Erastus Corning in June 1862 that Vallandigham was arrested \\"because he was laboring, with some effect, to prevent the raising of troops, to encourage desertions from the army, and to leave the rebellion without an adequate military force to suppress it. . . . Must I shoot a simple-minded deserter, while I must not touch a hair of a wily agitator who induces him to desert?\\"  Jackson's Terminiello formulation  In the 1949 case Terminiello v. City of Chicago, the majority opinion by Justice William O. Douglas overturned the disorderly conduct conviction of a priest whose rantings at a rally had incited a riot. The court held that Chicago's breach of the peace ordinance violated the First Amendment. Associate Justice Robert Jackson wrote a twenty-four page dissent in response to the court's four page decision, which concluded: \\"The choice is not between order and liberty. It is between liberty with order and anarchy without either. There is danger that, if the court does not temper its doctrinaire logic with a little practical wisdom, it will convert the constitutional Bill of Rights into a suicide pact.\\"  Goldberg's Kennedy formulation  Justice Arthur Goldberg wrote the court's opinion in the 1963 U.S. Supreme Court case Kennedy v. Mendoza- Martinez. While the court ultimately determined that laws permitting stripping draft evaders of their citizenship on the basis of a perceived existential threat to the nation were unconstitutional, Goldberg acknowledged the \\"not a suicide pact\\" argument, writing: \\"The powers of Congress to require military service for the common defense are broad and far-reaching, for while the Constitution protects against invasions of individual rights, it is not a suicide pact.\\"  Posner's application to terrorism  In 2006, Judge Richard Posner of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit and professor at the University of Chicago Law School, wrote a book called Not a Suicide Pact: The Constitution in a Time of National Emergency. Posner's position has drawn both critical opposition and support.  Donald Trump's NBC interview in 2016  In July 2016, in an interview with NBC's Meet the Press, then Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump referred to this concept. During the Republican primary campaign, Trump proposed a ban on all Muslims from entering the United States. After receiving the nomination, he softened this to suspending immigration from any nation with a Muslim majority in which he did not have business interests. When asked if this was a rollback to his previous stance, he denied it was, saying, \\"Our constitution is great, but it doesn't necessarily give us the right to commit suicide, okay?\\"  See also  * Civil rights * Free speech * Guantanamo Bay detention camp * Korematsu v.

He is the fifth CEO of the NCAA; he was named as the incoming president on April 27, 2010, and assumed his duties on November 1, 2010. Emmert was previously the 30th president of the University of Washington, his alma mater, taking office in June 2004, becoming the first alumnus in 48 years to lead UW. He left Washington on October 1, 2010, having announced his departure for the NCAA Presidency on April 27, 2010. The University of Washington Board of Regents elected him President Emeritus in honor of his service to the UW. Before Emmert became president of the University of Washington, he was chancellor at Louisiana State University and held faculty and administration positions at the University of Connecticut, Montana State University, and University of Colorado. Early life and education Emmert was born on December 16, 1952 in Fife, Washington and attended Fife High School, graduating in 1971. He studied at Green River Community College in Auburn, Washington before transferring in spring 1973 to the University of Washington, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1975. He went on to earn a Master of Public Administration in 1976 and a PhD in 1983 from the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs of Syracuse University. Career =Montana State University= Emmert served as provost and vice president for academic affairs at Montana State University from 1991 to 1995. In this role, he, along with the vice president for research, Robert Swenson, led a successful effort to increase research funding at the university, particularly from the National Science Foundation. He also worked with Congressional leaders to gain support for new agricultural research facilities on campus and distance learning programs. The NCAA ruled that Montana State was guilty of a \\"lack of institutional control\\" in 1993, stemming from behavior that occurred before Emmert arrived at MSU. The ruling was reached at the time Emmert belonged to the university's senior management team, along with Jim Isch, a former NCAA official. The case related to academic fraud involving an assistant men's basketball coach and a recruit. The NCAA didn't rule on the case until after Emmert left for UConn in 1995. Emmert had no involvement with the athletic programs in his role as provost and was unaware of the investigation, nor was he ever named or implicated in any wrongdoing. =University of Connecticut= Emmert joined the University of Connecticut in 1995 as Provost and was later promoted to the position of Chancellor for Academic Affairs, where he oversaw academic matters at the main campus in Storrs, as well as the regional campuses within the university system. He led a strategic planning effort that produced a facilities master plan for the Storrs campus, transforming the facilities on the campus with new buildings for students, faculty and research. Enrollment and research funding both increased during this time. During his tenure the university launched its first major fundraising campaign. Emmert oversaw the first two years of a ten- year-long, $1 billion construction project, UConn 2000, that added many new academic buildings, residence halls and landscape projects to the Storrs campus, and new buildings and facilities to the regional campuses. UConn 2000 is widely credited with transforming the university. Some of the projects became controversial because of charges of mismanagement in the facilities and contracting services. These issues, which included more than $100 million lost due to mismanagement and more than 100 fire and safety code violations, did not come to light during Emmert's tenure. The vast majority of the projects were begun after Emmert's tenure. Something handwritten on Emmert's stationery in 1998 suggested he was aware of construction management challenges. Some of the construction projects later became the focus of a state investigation in 2005. Governor Rell called it \\"astonishing failure of oversight and management.\\" Two administrators who oversaw the projects during this time were placed on leave and subsequently resigned six years after Emmert had left the university. =Louisiana State University= Emmert was named Chancellor of LSU in 1999. He led the creation of the \\"Flagship Agenda,\\" an effort credited with moving the university significantly forward in its standing as an academic institution, an effort that is still credited with advancing the university in very significant ways. During his tenure the academic preparation of entering freshmen increased substantially. Enrollment from across the country increased as well. LSU's research profile improved as a result of new research initiatives, particularly in computer science, marine and coastal science, and basic sciences. A number of academic construction projects commenced, including buildings and renovations for music and dramatic arts, marine biology and coastal studies, biology, residence halls, and the student union. Fund raising projects were begun that have resulted in dramatic improvements in the Ogden Honors College, the E.J. Ourso College of Business and the College of Engineering. Improvements were made to athletic facilities, most notably the creation of the Cox Communications Academic Center, renovation and expansion of Tiger Stadium, and a new state-of-the-art enclosure for the campus mascot, Mike the Tiger, that has become a major attraction for visitors to campus. Emmert‚Äôs wife, DeLaine Emmert, was very engaged in these fund raising efforts. State support for the university reached a then-historic high during Emmert's tenure. On November 30, 1999, Emmert hired Nick Saban as football coach. LSU won the BCS Championship in 2003 under Saban's tutelage and was 48-16 over five seasons (2000-04).Prior to Saban's arrival, LSU suffered eight losing seasons from 1989-99. The graduation rate of the LSU football team, among the lowest in the SEC when Emmert arrived, was among the highest by 2004. In 2001‚Äì02, a university instructor made accusations of academic fraud in the school's football program, including plagiarized papers and un-enrolled students showing up in class to take notes for football players. At the time, LSU was already on NCAA probation due to violations in the men's basketball program for violations that predated Emmert's employment. A university-led investigation into the academic fraud allegations found only minor violations. The report stated, \\"Despite isolated incidents, the allegations were largely unfounded.\\" The NCAA accepted LSU's finding and self-imposed minor penalties (loss of two football scholarships) and declined to put the school on probation. Subsequently, two women sued the university for forcing them from their jobs as a result of whistleblowing about the academic fraud. The lawsuits were settled for $110,000 for each person. During the case, an employee of the academic counseling center confirmed the women's claims under oath, including changed grades for football players. A portion of Emmert's salary was paid by the LSU Foundation, The Alumni Foundation and the Tiger Athletic Foundation. In September, 2016 Emmert was honored by LSU as the first Haymon Distinguished Visiting Professor at the Ogden Honors College. In 2020, he was named a faculty/staff initiate of the Omicron Delta Kappa Circle at LSU. =University of Washington= Emmert was president of the University of Washington, his alma mater, from 2004 to 2010. During his tenure the university achieved its highest levels of research funding, private giving, and state support. Undergraduate student qualifications and graduation rates also hit record highs. UW attracted more students globally and nationally. Emmert led the creation of the Husky Promise, a guarantee that tuition and fees would be covered for lower-income students from Washington state who were accepted to UW, a program that has now supported tens of thousands of students at the UW. The UW also increased access for Washington students by expanding UW Bothell and UW Tacoma academic offerings and facilities during Emmert's tenure. The UW Seattle campus was expanded with the purchase of the Safeco tower and property in the University District, adding about of building space. With Emmert as President, new facilities were created for the Foster School of Business, molecular engineering, bioengineering, and residential halls. Improvements were made to athletic facilities, culminating in the full renovation of Husky Stadium. Emmert initiated an annual summit with the Native American tribal council leaders from throughout the State of Washington and the region to address educational and health concerns. He led the process that culminated in the construction of a Native American House of Knowledge on campus. UW has been attentive to environmental and sustainability issues, and received numerous recognitions for its success during Emmert's tenure. Emmert was amongst the first 20 to sign the American College & University Presidents' Climate Commitment and is an active member of its steering committee. During Emmert's tenure, UW received more than $1 billion in grant and contract research funding for the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2007. This marked the first time UW received more than $1 billion in funding for sponsored research in a single year. In his last year at UW, research funding exceeding $1.5 billion. UW has been the top public university in federal research funding since 1974, and among the top five universities, public and private, in federal funding since 1969. In recent years, it has been second only to The Johns Hopkins University. In 2006, under Emmert's presidency, the university created the Department of Global Health and, in the spring of 2007, launched the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. In August 2007, Emmert announced that UW would open an office in Beijing to lay the groundwork for expanding the university's presence in China. Emmert made the announcement during a campus visit by Zhou Wenzhong, ambassador of the People's Republic of China to the United States. Emmert emphasized efforts to improve UW's environmental sustainability efforts throughout his tenure, leading to the university being recognized nationally as one of the most Eco-friendly campuses In January 2007, the fundraising goal for Campaign UW: Creating Futures was increased to $2.5 billion after the campaign reached its initial $2 billion goal 17 months ahead of schedule. When the campaign ended on June 30, 2008, the total raised was more than $2.6 billion. UW received a number of transformational gifts during Emmert's presidency, including a gift in fall of 2007 from the Foster Family Foundation, leading to the business school at the Seattle campus being named the Michael G. Foster School of Business. Emmert was president at the University of Washington when the university announced it was discontinuing its varsity men's and women's swim programs. While at the University of Washington, Emmert was courted by the University of Wisconsin, the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill, Cornell University, the University of California System, and the Louisiana State University System. In February 2008, he turned down an offer from Vanderbilt University that might have made him the highest-paid college leader in the nation. Nevertheless, he was the second most highly compensated public university president in the nation, at $888,000 for 2007-2008. In addition, he received $200,000 compensation for serving on the board of Expeditors International and $140,000 for serving on the board of Weyerhaeuser, giving him a total annual compensation of over $1.2 million. In 2009, a year in which he turned down a pay increase offered by the Regents, Emmert's base salary at the University of Washington was $620,000 per year, but his total compensation package, including deferred compensation, was $906,500 annually, which made him the second highest-earning public university president in the United States, behind Ohio State's Gordon Gee. Mark Emmert portrait painting by Michele Rushworth =National Collegiate Athletic Association= On April 27, 2010, Emmert was named president of the National Collegiate Athletic Association in Indianapolis, Indiana. He assumed his duties on November 1, 2010 and remains president today. The NCAA is a voluntary membership association with over 1,100 universities and colleges, over 19,000 teams, and over 460,000 students. Through the Association, rules and policies governing college sports are established by all the colleges and universities through a representative form of decision-making. Emmert entered the NCAA presidency during a period of dramatic change and controversy in college athletics. He has steadfastly advocated for greater support for student-athletes. Over his first four-year period, the member colleges and universities significantly increased support for Division I college athletes, including providing them with direct participation in, and voting positions on, the Board of Directors, the new DI Council, and within the Autonomy Group of conferences. Students can now be offered four-year scholarships rather than a single year scholarship as previously required. Rules governing the revocation of scholarships have been improved significantly, providing students with greater security. All restrictions on meals and food provided by schools have been lifted. Student athletes are now eligible to receive scholarship funds for the \\"full cost of attendance,\\" which in most cases provides several thousand dollars per year in addition to tuition, fees, room and board, books and supplies. Greater emphasis is now placed on health and safety issues, including playing and practice rules. As President, Emmert created the position of Chief Medical Officer (CMO) of the NCAA and the Sports Science Institute, hiring Dr. Brian Hainline to become the first CMO and director. Dr. Hainline has worked with member schools to establish new protocols and research efforts to improve student health and wellness. In 2014 the NCAA entered a partnership with the Department of Defense for the largest longitudinal study of concussion and head trauma in history, funded initially by a $15 million contribution from the NCAA and $15 million from DoD. Funding has now surpassed $64 million and reached 50,000 students making it by far the most important research on head trauma in the world. Emmert‚Äôs advocacy for the health and wellbeing of athletes has also lead to extensive efforts regarding mental health and the reduction of sexual assault. Emmert has led the Association's efforts to address the issues of LGBT rights, sexual assault and violence, and increasing diversity of coaches and administrators. In April 2015, Emmert and the business and community leaders of Indianapolis joined forces to object to a potentially discriminatory law passed by the state Legislature, resulting in a reversal of the law several weeks after its passage. In September 2016, the board of governors of the NCAA voted to relocate its championship events planned to be held during the 2016‚Äì2017 academic year in North Carolina because of the board members' concerns about the discriminatory impact of HB2. The decision was hailed nationally as a critical part of the decision of the North Carolina legislature to repeal HB2. Similarly, Emmert and the NCAA have been recognized for their leadership by Lambda Legal and the NAACP of South Carolina. In 2014 the NCAA Division I member universities, with Emmert's support, voted to change the system used to set their rules and policies so as to include greater input from athletic directors, faculty members, and senior women's athletics, and student athletes themselves, in addition to the university and college presidents who are ultimately responsible for all policy and governance decisions. In 2012 the colleges and universities approved substantial changes to the compliance and oversight policies of the Association. Among other improvements, under Emmert's tenure, the Committee on Infractions, the body that determines penalties and sanctions for rules violations, was expanded to include former university presidents and legal scholars, among others, thereby improving the efficiency and effectiveness of their work. In fall 2017 in response to an FBI investigation and arrests by the Justice Department‚Äôs Southern District of New York of executives of Adidas, sports agents and basketball coaches Emmert formed the Commission on Division I Men's Basketball, chaired by Condoleezza Rice. He called for swift and decisive action to address this scandal. Within less than a year the commission called for sweeping reform within the NCAA and the board of governors and membership bodies passed and the NCAA implemented the recommendations marking a dramatic improvement in the basketball environment. In January 2018, a misleading media story implied that Emmert had been personally informed in November 2010 ‚Äì six months after he was hired as the NCAA's president ‚Äì of 37 reports involving Michigan State University athletes sexually assaulting women. Subsequent reporting in multiple outlets pointed out that the suggestion that Emmert had been ‚Äúpersonally informed‚Äù was actually a misleading reference to widely publicized accounts coming from Michigan State during 2010. Throughout his tenure, Emmert has led multiple efforts within the NCAA to confront sexual violence within higher education. Penn State case During Emmert's tenure, Pennsylvania State University was rocked by the Jerry Sandusky sex abuse scandal. Sandusky, a former football coach at Penn State, was accused and later convicted of sexual molestation of children, including those he had taken to the Penn State athletic facilities. He was also accused of using his access to the Penn State football program as a way of luring victims. The University Board removed the President, Executive Vice President, Athletic Director, and head football coach because of their handling of the Sandusky matter. The media outcry over the scandal was enormous. In response to the uniqueness of the Penn State case and the nature of the allegations, the NCAA Executive Committee and Emmert agreed with the University that Penn State should be allowed to conduct its own inquiry into the scandal. In July 2012, former FBI Director Louis Freeh reported to the Penn State board that many serious missteps within the university administration and football program had occurred. Based upon the Freeh report, as well as material made public through the criminal processes, the NCAA Executive Committee, a group of 20 university and college presidents and senior leaders, along with the Division I Board of Directors, also a group of university presidents, agreed to a series of sanctions. They empowered Emmert to enter into an agreement with the Penn State leadership to jointly accept a consent decree. Ed Ray, Executive Committee chair at that time and Oregon State president, said that while there has been much speculation on whether the NCAA had the authority to impose any type of penalty related to Penn State, the Executive Committee concluded that the egregious behavior not only goes against the NCAA's rules and constitution, but also against its values. While many in the media called for Penn State football to receive the so-called \\"death penalty\\", the Executive Committee and Emmert instead entered into the consent decree with Penn State leadership that included imposing a $60 million fine to be used to fund nonprofit organizations that combat child sexual abuse, a multi-year reduction in football scholarships, a multi-year postseason ban on football, a vacation of wins from the formal record book for the period during which Sandusky was believed to have been engaging in sexual abuse of children, and the imposition of an Athletic Integrity Agreement which was monitored by former Senator George Mitchell. The Big Ten conference, which includes Penn State as a member, also imposed sanctions on the university as a result of the scandal. The outcome was highly controversial among those who sought harsher punishment and those who sought greater leniency. Supporters of greater leniency argued that the basis of the consent decree, the Freeh Report, was overreaching and not supported empirically. Freeh has vigorously defended the report and its conclusions. He is being sued for defamation by Graham Spanier, the former president of Penn State. Spanier, along with two other former Penn State executives, were found guilty of criminal charges. Critics accused Emmert and the NCAA Executive Committee of a \\"rush to judgment\\" that did not provide sufficient due process even though the university itself agreed to the settlement agreement. The Athletic Integrity Agreement, contained in the consent decree, called upon Penn State to make a large number of administrative and personnel changes over a multiple-year period. Senator Mitchell, in his role as monitor, found that the university was very aggressive in fulfilling the agreement, and recommended to Emmert and the NCAA Executive Committee that some of the sanctions be reduced in recognition of Penn State's positive actions. The Executive Committee agreed and on two occasions reduced the sanctions as a result of the university's seriousness in addressing these matters. Emmert, however, was criticized over the Penn State case after internal emails surfaced revealing NCAA officials bluffed the university into accepting sanctions. Several legal actions have occurred since the Penn State scandal was uncovered, some involving Penn State, Emmert, and the NCAA and its members; others have been focused on the university itself as it made restitution with the victims of the scandal. A legal suit was brought against Penn State and the NCAA by Senator Corman from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania regarding where the funds from the fine should be spent. The case was ultimately settled by an agreement that the funds could be spent on child sex abuse prevention within the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and that the wins that had been vacated from the record book be restored. Major news media outlets both praised and criticized Emmert and the NCAA. Many writers that called for aggressive sanctions against the university, including the so-called death penalty, were disappointed that the NCAA had reduced its sanctions, while other were critical of their \\"rush to judgment\\" and started asking whether the culture at the NCAA was broken under Emmert's leadership. His presidency has been called \\"feckless, arrogant, self- aggrandizing, inept\\" and operating under \\"tortured logic.\\" =Final resolution of Penn State-Sandusky scandal= On May 5, 2016, a Pennsylvania judge, Gary Glazer, barred Penn State from receiving insurance coverage to pay settlements to Sandusky's accusers. The judge pointed to the university's \\"negligent employment, investigation, and retention of Sandusky\\", adding that, \\"When he abused children ... he was still a PSU assistant coach and professor, and clothed in the glory associated with those titles, particularly in the eyes of impressionable children. By cloaking him with a title that enabled him to perpetrate his crimes, PSU must assume some responsibility for what he did both on and off campus.\\" PSU at that point had paid out $93 million to more than 30 Sandusky accusers. On October 27, 2016, Mike McQueary, the former assistant coach who reported to Joe Paterno that he'd observed Sandusky's sexual assault of a child in the team's showers, was awarded $7.3 million by a Pennsylvania jury, to be paid by Penn State for defamation. Shortly thereafter on November 20, 2016, the judge in the case, Thomas Gavin, ruled in favor of McQueary's whistleblower claim and added another $5 million to the jury verdict. In a rebuke to PSU, Judge Gavin wrote, \\"Only when the 'Sandusky Matter' became public was Mr. McQueary subjected to disparate treatment and adverse employment consequences.\\" The university, he stated, had imposed \\"the equivalent of banishment\\" on McQueary, including \\"being told to clean out his office in the presence of Penn State personnel, an action that suggests he had done something wrong and was not to be trusted.\\" Tribune news services, Chicago Tribune, November 30, 2016 On June 2, 2017, in the remaining criminal cases all three of the university's administrators ‚Äì Spanier, Schultz, and Curly ‚Äì originally implicated by the Freeh Report and the grand jury were found guilty of child endangerment by the State of Pennsylvania and sentenced to jail time. The Judge in the case, John Boccabella, when announcing the sentences said, \\"Why Mr. Sandusky was allowed to continue to go to the Penn State facilities is beyond me. All three ignored the opportunity to put an end to [Sandusky's] crimes when they had a chance to do so.\\" Judge Boccabella also criticized deceased head coach Joe Paterno, saying Coach Paterno, \\"could have made that phone call without so much as getting his hands dirty. Why he didn't is beyond me.\\" On June 30, 2017, the Paterno family dropped \\"with prejudice\\" (meaning it cannot be refiled) its final lawsuit against the NCAA, Mark Emmert and Ed Ray of Oregon State University. The NCAA recognized this decision as a complete 'victory\\" for their position. The NCAA (as well as Emmert and Ray) made no payments or offered any other consideration for dropping the suit. The NCAA chief legal officer, Donald Remy stated, \\"The Paterno family characterized this case as a 'search for truth.' Its decision today, to abandon its lawsuit rather than subject those facts to courtroom examination is telling. We believe that the powerful record developed during discovery overwhelmingly confirmed what the NCAA has believed all along: the NCAA acted reasonably in adopting the conclusions of the eight-month investigation by Louis Freeh.‚Äù The Paterno Family decided to drop their lawsuit hours before the NCAA was to file for summary judgment. Penn State University has, as of January 7, 2017, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer, spent over $250 million to resolve these issues. O'Bannon lawsuit Emmert, as well as a number of high-profile leaders of intercollegiate athletics, including university presidents, conference commissioners, and athletic directors, were called upon to testify in the case of O'Bannon v. NCAA regarding the use of college student athletes' names, images, and likenesses. The case was ultimately appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals which ruled partially in favor of both parties. =Other honors and professional affiliations= Emmert is currently a Life Member of the Council of Foreign Relations and a fellow of the National Academy for Public Administration. He is a former Fulbright Administrative Fellow, and a former Fellow of the American Council on Education. He serves as a Director on the boards of Weyerhaeuser and Expeditors International. In June 2016, he sold approximately $300,000 in Weyerhaeuser shares. Emmert has been honored with several honorary degrees from American universities and colleges. Emmert was named President Emeritus by the University of Washington Board of Regents in 2010. He holds Honorary Degrees from several colleges and universities. On March 18, 2014, Emmert was a guest on ESPN Radio's Mike & Mike. During his appearance, an #AskEmmert hashtag was used to propose questions for Emmert. While well- intended, the hashtag was quickly used by the public to air grievances about NCAA actions and express general disapproval with Emmert's presidency. Personal life Mark and DeLaine Emmert have been married for more than 40 years and have two adult children.

The novel is about a young boy, Elmer Elevator, who runs away to Wild Island to rescue a baby dragon. Both a Newbery Honor Book and an ALA Notable Book, it is the first book of a trilogy whose other titles are Elmer and the Dragon and The Dragons of Blueland. All three were published in a 50-year anniversary edition as Three Tales of My Father's Dragon. In 1997, it was made into an anime film titled, Elmer's Adventure: My Father's Dragon, while the character Boris the Dragon was produced into a Plush toy designed by Sunflower Publishing Company and released in the fall of the same year. Netflix will also release a film adaptation in 2021. The narrative mode is unusual in that the narrator refers to the protagonist only as \\"my father\\", giving the impression that this is a true story that happened long ago. The other two books in the trilogy are narrated in the third person. The illustrations are by Ruth Chrisman Gannett and hand-drawn in black and white with a grease crayon on grained paper. Gannett also illustrated a number of other children's and adult books, including Tortilla Flat by John Steinbeck. The book is in the public domain, as its copyright was not renewed after 28 years.  Plot  A boy named Elmer finds a cat in the street. The cat tells him about Wild Island. Elmer goes there. He escapes on a ship, disguising as wheat but later being mistaken as dried corn on the cob. Once Elmer's there, he faces challenges, including seven tigers, two wild boars, a rhinoceros and a gorilla. At last, he has to walk across seventeen crocidiles to find the dragon. Awards, nominations, and recognition My Father's Dragon was one runner-up for the 1949 Newbery Medal, by which the American Library Association annually recognizes the year's best American children's book. It was also nominated for the Ambassador Book Award in 1948. Based on a 2007 online poll, the National Education Association listed it as one of \\"Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children\\". In 2012 it was ranked number 49 among all-time children's novels in a survey published by School Library Journal. Film, TV or theatrical adaptations In 1997, the book was made into a Japanese anime film titled, Elmer's Adventure: My Father's Dragon. It starred Yu-ki as Elmer Elevator and Megumi Hayashibara as Boris the dragon. In 2011, the book was adapted into an American children's stage musical by Travis Tagart. In 2018, Netflix announced that the book will be adapted into an animated feature film of the same name by Irish animation studio Cartoon Saloon for a 2021 release. Nora Twomey was announced as the director with Meg LeFauve as the film's screenwriter.https://variety.com/2018/film/news/netflix-animated-films- shows-1203019832/ Other formats A public domain online edition of My Father's Dragon, a 1949 Newbery Honor Book, is available at A Celebration of Women Writers.

Howe during the Second World War. He was perhaps one of the greatest industrialists and business minds in Canadian history; Gordon bought two companies and held one CEO position, but eventually lost it all. Early years Gordon was born in Winnipeg in 1914. He was the first child of Crawford Gordon Sr. and Ethel Flora Fortune, the latter of whom had survived the sinking of the RMS Titanic in 1912. Second World War Gordon was one of C. D. Howe's \\"boys\\", or \\"dollar-a-year men\\" during the Second World War, helping the government organize industrial resources to meet the needs of wartime production and resource management. Avro Canada In October 1951, Howe arranged for Gordon, now with the Department of Defense Production, to take over as President and General Manager of A. V. Roe Canada (\\"Avro Canada\\"), a subsidiary of A.V. Roe and Company of the U.K., to assist with problems in development and production of the CF-100 Canuck fighter interceptor.\\"The legacy of the Avro Arrow.\\" The Globe And Mail, 18 January 1997, A2, quoting J.L. Granatstein. Under Gordon's encouragement to Avro's designers, Avro offered to design and build the new supersonic jet interceptor identified by the Canadian Chiefs of Staff as needed to counter a Soviet Union bomber threat. In 1953 the government commenced funding of a study for what would first be the design for the C104 delta-wing aircraft, and eventually the CF-105 Arrow.Bothwell and Kilbourn 1980, p. 95. During Crawford's tenure in the 1950s, A.V. Roe Canada was restructured into two separate divisions: Avro Aircraft Ltd. and Orenda Engines, both based at Malton Airport. The total labour force of both aviation companies reached 15,000 in 1958. During the same period, A.V. Roe Canada also purchased a number of companies, including Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation, Canada Car and Foundry (1957) and Canadian Steel Improvement Ltd. By 1958, A. V. Roe Canada was an industrial giant with over 50,000 employees in a far-flung empire of 44 companies involved in coal mining, steel making, railway rolling stock, aircraft and aero-engine manufacturing, as well as computers and electronics. The companies generated annual sales in the $450 million range, ranking A.V. Roe Canada as the third largest corporation in Canada.Zuk 2005, p. 88. =The Avro Arrow= Gordon continued to ask for further funding as the interceptor program for the CF-105 Arrow proceeded, particularly as the program scope expanded to include the new Orenda Iroquois advanced turbojet engine, when other manufacturers' engine designs were dropped or proved inadequate. When the Liberal government in which Howe served was defeated, Gordon had to deal with the new Progressive Conservative government of John Diefenbaker, a government that narrowly viewed such ambitious, costly projects. Gordon may have clashed with the Diefenbaker government due to a number of pressures, including the unexpected delays in getting the Avro Arrow into production, and the threat to the Arrow from the rise of the missile (it was designed to intercept manned bombers). There may have also been a clash of personalities: during the only meeting between the two, Gordon was described as \\"drunken, rude\\"Grattan O'Leary, quoted by Palmiro Campagna, preface to the third paperback edition, p. 18. and \\"puffed (cigarette) smoke in the old man's face\\". Gordon was a heavy drinker and Diefenbaker a teetotaler and non-smoker.Bothwell and Kilbourn 1980, p. 266.There Never Was an Arrow (CBC TV 1980) Final years Gordon's battles and gambles finally lost out when the Arrow program was canceled on 20 February 1959. Gordon was fired as A.V. Roe Canada president not long after the Arrow cancellation. Gordon's life was on a downward spiral afterward. By the summer of 1966, his net worth of $3 million had mostly evaporated. After a long battle with alcoholism, Crawford Gordon died in New York City on 26 January 1967 of liver failure. Friends said he drank himself to his death; he could handle success, but not failure. The Arrow (1996). Crawford Gordon in popular culture Crawford Gordon was portrayed, with a good visible likeness, by Dan Aykroyd in the 1997 mini-series The Arrow. His secretary, Audrey Underwood (given the name Claire in the CBC mini-series), left AVRO Canada for New York to escape from her relationship with Crawford, who had refused to divorce his wife. Crawford pursued her to New York in an attempt to win back her love (as verified by Arrow Expert Greig Stewart and by the Underwood family). Underwood was the daughter of Canadian Unarmed Combat and Self-Defence legend Bill Underwood, who created the first Unarmed Combat system for the Canadian Forces in WW2, known as COMBATO (documented by the Canadian Forces). Crawford's drinking problems and depression then served to exacerbate his distrust of the Diefenbaker government into outright abuse. That abuse did not help with the government's disdain for the Arrow program while it was under budget pressure to make just one choice for aeronautic defense of Canadian airspace.

They left Longdale around 3 p.m. They were to be in Meridian by 4 p.m. that day. The fastest route to Meridian was through Philadelphia. At the fork of Beacon & Main Street their station wagon sustained a flat tire. It is possible that a shot was fired at the station wagon's tire. Sheriff Lawrence Rainey's home was near the Beacon & Main Street fork. Deputy Cecil Price soon arrived and escorted them to the county jail. Price released the trio as soon as the longest day of the year became night which was about 10 p.m. The three were last seen heading south in their Ford station wagon along Highway 19 toward Meridian. Two Mississippi Highway Patrol men waited at Pilgrim's Gas Station not far from Philadelphia's city limits. The trio was likely deferred from using a phone at the station. They drove past the station and continued toward Meridian. =Lynch mob= The lynch mob, in Horace D. Barnette's and Billy W. Posey's cars, was drinking while arguing who would kill the three men. Eventually Philadelphia Police Officer Other N. Burkes drove up to Barnette's car and told the mob that \\"they're going on 19 toward Meridian. Follow them!\\" After a quick rendezvous with Philadelphia Police Officer Richard Willis, Price was in pursuit of the three civil rights workers. Posey's Chevrolet carried Jerry M. Sharpe, Jimmy L. Townsend, and Alton W. Roberts. Horace Barnette had a two-toned blue Ford Fairlane sedan. In Horace's car were James Jordan, Jimmy K. Arledge, Jimmy Snowden, Roberts, and Posey. Posey's car apparently had carburetor problems and broke down on the side of the road. Sharpe and Townsend were ordered to stay with the car and get it running again. Price eventually caught the CORE station wagon heading west toward Union, Mississippi, on state highway 492. Soon the three civil right workers would be escorted north on Highway 19 to secluded Rock Cut Road where they would be executed at the hand of Roberts and Jordan. When they arrived, Roberts reportedly pulled Schwerner out of the car, pointing a gun at his chest. \\"Are you that nigger lover?\\" Roberts asked, his left hand on Schwerner's shoulder. \\"Sir, I know just how you feel,\\" Schwerner replied. Roberts then shot him in the heart and then grabbed Goodman, shooting him in the chest near his right shoulder. Chaney ran, but Roberts along with other Klansmen were able to shoot him dead before he could run any farther. Roberts fired into Chaney's lower back and his head. Prosecutors said that Roberts fired two of the three bullets found in Chaney's body. After the murders James Jordan was accused of saying \\"well, you didn't leave me nothing but a nigger, but at least I killed me a nigger.\\" Conviction On December 4, 1964, The Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested several men for engineering a conspiracy to injure, oppress, threaten, and intimidate Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner. Roberts was one of many rounded up that day. Roberts was indicted on February 28, 1967. He went to federal trial in Meridian on October 7 of that same year; 13 days later, he was convicted. At the sentence hearing on December 29, 1967, Judge William Harold Cox sentenced Roberts 10 years in federal prison. Roberts served no more than six years in McNeil Island Corrections Center,‚ÄòEx-Sheriff Rainey: He‚Äôs Haunted by the Past‚Äô; The Boston Globe, September 22, 1974, p. 280 and was free on appeal bond. =Encounter with Laurens Pierce= Roberts gained national recognition on January 27, 1965, when Jack Thornell took photos of him beating up CBS cameraman Laurens Pierce outside the federal courthouse in Meridian where he was in trial at the time.CBS cameraman Laurens Pierce, left, struggles for his camera with Alton Wayne Roberts outside the Federal Building in Meridian, Miss., Jan. 27, 1965.

His name (\\"born far away\\") is indicative of his birth on Aeaea, far from Odysseus' home of Ithaca. It was part of the Epic Cycle of poems that recounted the myths of the Trojan War as well as the events that led up to and followed it. The story of the Telegony comes chronologically after that of the Odyssey and is the final episode in the Epic Cycle. The poem was sometimes attributed in antiquity to Cinaethon of Sparta (8th century BC), but in one source it is said to have been stolen from Musaeus by Eugamon or Eugammon of Cyrene (6th century BC)\\"Some have seen in the 'burst of happy marriages' in which the Telegoneia ends an explanation for its being ascribed to Eugammon, a name which apparently means 'Happy- Marrier'\\", Edmund D. Cressman remarks (Cressman, \\"Beyond the Sunset\\" The Classical Journal 27.9 (June 1932:669-674], p. 671). (see Cyclic poets). The poem comprised two books of verse in dactylic hexameter. Title In Antiquity the Telegony may have also been known as the Thesprotis (Greek: ŒòŒµœÉœÄœÅœâœÑŒØœÇ), which is referred to once by Pausanias in the 2nd century AD;Pausanias 8.12.5. alternatively, the Thesprotis may have been a name for the first book of the Telegony, which is set in Thesprotia. Such naming of isolated episodes within a larger epic was common practice for the ancient readers of the Homeric epics.For example, Book 10 of the Iliad is called the Doloneia, and book 5 and part of book 6 were known as \\"the Aristeia of Diomedes\\". The first four books of the Odyssey are called the Telemachy, as those books describe the journey of Odysseus' son Telemachus as he looks for news about his missing father; Odysseus' descent to the Underworld (Odyssey 11) is known as the Nekyia. A third possibility is that there was a wholly separate epic called the Thesprotis; and yet a fourth possibility is that the Telegony and Thesprotis were two separate poems that were at some stage compiled into a single Telegony. Date The date of composition of the Telegony is uncertain. Cyrene, the native city of purported author Eugammon, was founded in 631 BC; but the narrative details may have existed prior to Eugammon's version, perhaps even in the oral tradition. There is a distinct possibility that the author of the Odyssey knew at least some version of the Telegony story (the Thesprotian episode and Telegonus' unusual spear in the Telegony may have been based on Tiresias' prophecy in Odyssey book 11; but it is also possible that the Odyssey poet used the Telegonus story as a basis for Teiresias' prophecy). Certainly Eugammon's poem is most likely to have been composed in the 6th century BC. Content Only two lines of the poem's original text survive. For its storyline we are dependent primarily on a summary of the Telegonus myth in the Chrestomathy of one \\"Proclus\\".Possibly to be identified with the second-century AD grammarian Eutychios Proklos). The Bibliotheca offers a much more abbreviated account. The Telegony comprises two distinct episodes: Odysseus' voyage to Thesprotia, and the story of Telegonus. Probably each of the two books of the Telegony related one of these episodes. The poem opens after the events depicted in the Odyssey. According to Proclus' summary, the Telegony opens with the burial of Penelope's suitors.The beginning of Telegoneia suggested to G.L. Huxley (Greek Epic Poetry: From Eumelos to Pamyassis, Harvard University Press, 1969:171) that the Odyssey as it was known to Eumelos in the sixth century ended with the killing of the suitors, without the so-called \\"Continuation\\" in the version we read today. Joseph Russo, reviewing Huxley in The American Journal of Philology October 1972:623, expressed his own feeling \\"that Eugammon was free to begin his poem about Telegonus wherever he wanted, the main criterion being that it suit his artistic design, which we are in no position to judge adequately\\". Odysseus makes sacrifices to the Nymphs.Presumably the nymphs are intended in whose cave he had hidden the treasure he brought with him to Ithaca: see Odyssey 13. He makes a voyage to Elis, where he visits an otherwise unknown figure Polyxenos, who gives him a bowl depicting the story of Trophonius. Odysseus returns to Ithaca and then travels to Thesprotia, presumably to make the sacrifices commanded by Tiresias in Odyssey 11. There he weds the Thesprotian queen Kallidike, who bears him a son, Polypoites.\\"In the non-Homeric poems of the Cycle, the character of Odysseus appears much less admirable than it does in Homer,\\" Edmund D. Cressman remarks (Cressman 1932:670). Odysseus fights for the Thesprotians in a war against the neighbouring Brygoi; the gods participate in the war, Ares routing Odysseus and the Thesprotians, countered by Athena, ever Odysseus' patron; Apollo intervenes between the battling gods. However, Kallidike is killed in the war, Polypoetes succeeds to the kingdomThe often-repeated theme in Greek mythology of the son of a queen's consort succeeding to her throne has raised much commentary. and Odysseus returns to Ithaca. Meanwhile, it transpires that Circe, with whom Odysseus had an affair for a year in the Odyssey (books 10-12), has borne his son, Telegonus (Œ§Œ∑ŒªŒ≠Œ≥ŒøŒΩŒøœÇ, \\"born far away\\"). He grows up living with Circe on the island of Aeaea. On the goddess Athena's advice, Circe tells him the name of his father. In a detail inserted into the account in the Epitome of the Bibliotheke she gives him a supernatural spear to defend himself which is tipped with the sting of a poisonous stingray and was made by the god Hephaestus.Epitome vii.36. See also the scholium ad Od. 11.134. A storm forces Telegonus onto Ithaca without his realizing where he is. As is customary for Homeric heroes in unfriendly land, he commits piracy, and unwittingly begins stealing Odysseus' cattle. Odysseus comes to defend his property. During the ensuing fight, Telegonus kills Odysseus with his unusual spear, thereby partially fulfilling Tiresias' prophecy in Odyssey 11 that death would come to Odysseus \\"out of the sea\\" (i.e., the poison of the ray).As all prophecy in myth \\"comes true\\", most readers attribute the interpolation of this marine detail to an attempt to make Odysseus' death \\"come from the sea\\". (In another respect, however, Odysseus' death contradicts the prophecy of Tiresias, who predicted (Od. 11.135) that a \\"gentle death\\" would come to Odysseus \\"in sleek old age.\\") As Odysseus lies dying,Sophocles' lost Odysseus Acanthoplex also brought him inadvertent death at the hand of Telegonus. he and Telegonus recognize one another, and Telegonus laments his mistake. Telegonus brings his father's corpse, Penelope, and Odysseus' other son Telemachus, back to Aeaea, where Odysseus is buried and Circe makes the others immortal. Telegonus marries Penelope, and Telemachus marries Circe.The plot summary by Eutyches Proclus, which is followed here, is translated by Hugh G. Evelyn-White, Hesiod, Homeric Hymns and Homerica (Loeb Classical Library), 1914, Latin inventions The 1st-century AD Roman fabulist Hyginus differs from Proclus in adding a few details. First, it is both Odysseus and Telemachus who engage Telegonus in combat. Hyginus then adds that Odysseus had received an oracle to beware his son.This detail makes Telemachus' presence in Ithaca unusual, but might provide an unstated reason for Telemachus' absence in the accounts of Proclus and Apollodorus; namely, Odysseus banished him from Ithaca for fear of the oracle. Finally, Hyginus attributes to Telegonus a son named Italus, the eponymous founder of Italy; and to Telemachus he attributes a son named Latinus, whose name was given to the Latin language. Numerous Latin poetsCressman 1932:672 notes Horace, Ovid, Propertius and Statius. make Telegonus the founder of Praeneste or Tusculum, important Latin towns. Dante's invention In Dante's Divine Comedy, in the eighth bolgia of the Inferno,Inferno, Canto XXVI. Dante and his guide meet Ulisse among the false counsellors, and receive a variant accounting of Ulisse's death \\"from the sea\\", in a five-month journey beyond the Pillars of Hercules, that has ended in a whirlpool drowning as the mariners approach the mountain of Purgatory. No Greek source was available to Dante, only the Latin recensions of Dictys and Dares. Among the many operas based on the myths of Odysseus and those around him, there is but oneAccording to Latin Notes Supplement, December 1926 (noted by Chessman 1932:673). based on Telegonus, Carlo Luigi Grua's Telegone (premiered in D√ºsseldorf, 1697) of which an aria \\"Dia le mosse a miei contenti\\" may be noted. Divine intervention, a death and multiple weddings at the end all assorted easily with the conventions of opera seria.

The film also stars Michael Ironside and Sara Botsford. The mini-series is noted as having the highest viewership ever for a CBC program. Other significant individuals in the program, portrayed in the series, include RCAF pilot Flight Lieutenant Jack Woodman (Ron White) who conducted test flights on Avro aircraft but was supplanted by Janusz ≈ªurakowski (Lubomir Mykytiuk) for the first few flights; Jim Chamberlin (Aidan Devine) and James Floyd (Nigel Bennett) in the design team; Edward Critchley (Ian D. Clark) who would be asked to develop an engine for the Arrow when other models became unavailable. The film also boasted cameos by Michael Moriarty as U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Christopher Plummer as the Canadian Minister of Transport George Hees. Cast Principal roles as appearing in screen credits (main roles identified):\\"'The Arrow' (1997) Full credits.\\" imdb. Retrieved: 25 September 2010. Production Although the miniseries is based on history, it is a work of fiction, employing composite characters, and depicting some events that actually did not take place. It acknowledges that there is no hard evidence to support the fictional final scenes, depicting one Arrow that escaped the torches used to tear the other Arrows apart, in accord with allegations attributed to reporter June Callwood. There are errors in illustrations, such as the wing design (the classified design does not appear on the models used, other than on one model the morning after Jim Chamberlin made his modifications); during the \\"destruct and dispose\\" operation, an Apollo lunar module is shown in its final configuration, although that design was arrived at by Grumman Aircraft in the later 1960s out of sheer necessity to reduce weight. Wetaskiwin resident Allan Jackson's efforts to build a full-scale model of the Arrow were discovered during the research phase of pre- production. An offer was made to complete the model and use it in the miniseries. A CBC crew of model makers and set designers completed the full- scale model in time for principal photography that took place in Winnipeg. The production eventually used a combination of archival film, remote-control flying models and computer animation for the static, ground and flying sequences. =Arrow model= The full-scale Arrow model differs slightly from those built in 1957-59. It was featured throughout the film but the wing structure had a pronounced outer panel dihedral that was \\"corrected\\" by CGI work. The wing design was seen on-screen \\"only\\" on a wind tunnel model crafted after an \\"all-nighter\\" by Chamberlin that was stable at Mach 2.5 and higher. At the end of film production, Jackson's model was returned but had to be cut into sections in order to fit on the flat-bed trucks used to transport the model to Alberta. After arriving at the Reynolds Alberta Museum in Wetaskawin, Jackson and a team of volunteers reconstructed the model for display at the Abbotsford Air Show in 1997. A wind gust damaged the tail of the model in 1999 leading to its removal from an outside display area of the museum to be repaired indoors at the museum storage facility. Students and instructors from Edmonton's NAIT's Aircraft Structures program have volunteered close to 400 hours restoring the full-scale model to be displayed at the Reynolds-Alberta Museum in 2009 as part of celebrations marking the 100th anniversary of powered flight in Canada and the 50th anniversary of the cancellation of the Avro Arrow. The restored model remains in the museum's storage warehouse along with many other aircraft and cars and can be viewed by purchasing a warehouse tour during the summer months.

(30 September 1884 ‚Äì 30 November 1957) was an Italian friar of the Discalced Carmelite Order, who became a cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church, and Patriarch of Venice, as well as a member of the Roman Curia in Vatican City. Life He was born in Vigo di Cadore, a small village in the mountains of the Veneto region of Italy, the son of Giuseppe Piazza and Elisabetta Nicol√≤. In 1897 he began to study at a school run by the friars, being admitted to the Order on 6 August 1902. He professed his religious vows on 7 August 1903, after which he was drafted to fulfill his military obligations by serving in the medical corps in Treviso from 1904-1906. He returned to the Carmelite monastery and was sent to complete his seminary studies, professing his solemn vows on 7 August 1907. He was ordained a Catholic priest on 19 December 1908 by the Patriarch of Venice. He then served as the prior in several monasteries of the Order, until the outbreak of World War I, at which time he served as a military chaplain. After the war Piazza was again sent to serve as the prior of several local monasteries over the subsequent years. In 1922 he was called to Rome to serve as the Secretary to the Prior General of the Order, serving in that position until 1925, when he was elected as the Procurator General of the Order. On 29 January 1930, Piazza was appointed as the Archbishop of Benevento, for which office he was consecrated as a bishop the following 24 February in the Discalced Carmelite Church of Santa Teresa, Rome. Piazza was appointed as Patriarch of Venice in December 1935 and formally installed early the next year. He was elevated to cardinal by Pope Pius XI in the consistory of 13 December 1937, with the title of Cardinal Priest of Santa Prisca. As cardinal, Piazza participated in the Papal conclave of 1939 that elected Pope Pius XII. Piazza remained Patriarch of Venice until 1948 at which time he was named by Pope Pius XII as the Secretary of the Sacred Consistorial Congregation (now called the Congregation for Bishops). He remained in this capacity until his death. In 1949 his title was changed by the pope to Cardinal Bishop of Sabina e Poggio Mirteto. On June 11, 1951 he consecrated the Venerable Fulton John Sheen a bishop at the Roman basilica of Sts. John and Paul.

The selfish gene theory postulates that natural selection will increase the frequency of those genes whose phenotypic effects cause their transmission to new organisms, and most genes achieve this by cooperating with other genes in the same genome to build an organism capable of reproducing and/or helping kin to reproduce. The assumption of the prevalence of intragenomic cooperation underlies the organism-centered concept of inclusive fitness. However, conflict among genes in the same genome may arise both in events related to reproduction (a selfish gene may \\"cheat\\" and increase its own presence in gametes or offspring above the expected according to fair Mendelian segregation and fair gametogenesis) and altruism (genes in the same genome may disagree on how to value other organisms in the context of helping kin because coefficients of relatedness diverge between genes in the same genome). Nuclear genes Autosomic genes usually have the same mode of transmission in sexually reproducing species due to the fairness of Mendelian segregation, but conflicts among alleles of autosomic genes may arise when an allele cheats during gametogenesis (segregation distortion) or eliminates embryos that don't contain it (lethal maternal effects). An allele may also directly convert its rival allele into a copy of itself (homing endonucleases). Finally, mobile genetic elements completely bypass Mendelian segregation, being able to insert new copies of themselves into new positions in the genome (transposons). =Segregation distortion= In principle, the two parental alleles have equal probabilities of being present in the mature gamete. However, there are several mechanisms that lead to an unequal transmission of parental alleles from parents to offspring. One example is a gene, called a segregation distorter, that \\"cheats\\" during meiosis or gametogenesis and thus is present in more than half of the functional gametes. The most studied examples are sd in Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly), t haplotype in Mus musculus (mouse) and sk in Neurospora spp. (fungus). Possible examples have also been reported in humans. Segregation distorters that are present in sexual chromosomes (as is the case with the X chromosome in several Drosophila species) are denominated sex-ratio distorters, as they induce a sex-ratio bias in the offspring of the carrier individual. Killer and target The most simple model of meiotic drive involves two tightly linked loci: a Killer locus and a Target locus. The segregation distorter set is composed by the allele Killer (in the Killer locus) and the allele Resistant (in the Target locus), while its rival set is composed by the alleles Non-killer and Non-resistant. So, the segregation distorter set produces a toxin to which it is itself resistant, while its rival is not. Thus, it kills those gametes containing the rival set and increases in frequency. The tight linkage between these loci is crucial, so these genes usually lie on low-recombination regions of the genome. True meiotic drive Other systems do not involve gamete destruction, but rather use the asymmetry of meiosis in females: the driving allele ends up in the oocyte instead of in the polar bodies with a probability greater than one half. This is termed true meiotic drive, as it does not rely on a post-meiotic mechanism. The best-studied examples include the neocentromeres (knobs) of maize, as well as several chromosomal rearrangements in mammals. The general molecular evolution of centromeres is likely to involve such mechanisms. =Lethal maternal effects= The Medea gene causes the death of progeny from a heterozygous mother that do not inherit it. It occurs in the flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum). Maternal-effect selfish genes have been successfully synthesized in the lab. =Transposons= Transposons are autonomous replicating genes that encode the ability to move to new positions in the genome and therefore accumulate in the genomes. They replicate themselves in spite of being detrimental to the rest of the genome. They are often called 'jumping genes' or parasitic DNA and were discovered by Barbara McClintock in 1944. =Homing endonuclease genes= Homing endonuclease genes (HEG) convert their rival allele into a copy of themselves, and are thus inherited by nearly all meiotic daughter cells of a heterozygote cell. They achieve this by encoding an endonuclease which breaks the rival allele. This break is repaired by using the sequence of the HEG as template. HEGs encode sequence-specific endonucleases. The recognition sequence (RS) is 15‚Äì30 bp long and usually occurs once in the genome. HEGs are located in the middle of their own recognition sequences. Most HEGs are encoded by self-splicing introns (group I & II) and inteins. Inteins are internal protein fragments produced from protein splicing and usually contain endonuclease and splicing activities. The allele without the HEGs are cleaved by the homing endonuclease and the double- strand break are repaired by homologous recombination (gene conversion) using the allele containing HEGs as template. Both chromosomes will contain the HEGs after repair. =B-chromosome= B-chromosomes are nonessential chromosomes; not homologous with any member of the normal (A) chromosome set; morphologically and structurally different from the A's; and they are transmitted at higher-than-expected frequencies, leading to their accumulation in progeny. In some cases, there is strong evidence to support the contention that they are simply selfish and that they exist as parasitic chromosomes. They are found in all major taxonomic groupings of both plants and animals. Cytoplasmic genes Since nuclear and cytoplasmic genes usually have different modes of transmission, intragenomic conflicts between them may arise. Mitochondria and chloroplasts are two examples of sets of cytoplasmic genes that commonly have exclusive maternal inheritance, similar to endosymbiont parasites in arthropods, like Wolbachia. =Males as dead-ends to cytoplasmic genes= Anisogamy generally produces zygotes that inherit cytoplasmic elements exclusively from the female gamete. Thus, males represent dead-ends to these genes. Because of this fact, cytoplasmic genes have evolved a number of mechanisms to increase the production of female descendants and eliminate offspring not containing them. =Feminization= Male organisms are converted into females by cytoplasmic inherited protists (Microsporidia) or bacteria (Wolbachia), regardless of nuclear sex-determining factors. This occurs in amphipod and isopod Crustacea and Lepidoptera. =Male-killing= Male embryos (in the case of cytoplasmic inherited bacteria) or male larvae (in the case of Microsporidia) are killed. In the case of embryo death, this diverts investment from males to females who can transmit these cytoplasmic elements (for instance, in ladybird beetles, infected female hosts eat their dead male brothers, which is positive from the viewpoint of the bacterium). In the case of microsporidia-induced larval death, the agent is transmitted out of the male lineage (through which it cannot be transmitted) into the environment, where it may be taken up again infectiously by other individuals. Male-killing occurs in many insects. In the case of male embryo death, a variety of bacteria have been implicated, including Wolbachia. =Male- sterility= In some cases anther tissue (male gametophyte) is killed by mitochondria in monoecious angiosperms, increasing energy and material spent in developing female gametophytes. This leads to a shift from monoecy to gynodioecy, where part of the plants in the population are male-sterile. =Parthenogenesis induction= In certain haplodiploid Hymenoptera and mites, in which males are produced asexually, Wolbachia and Cardinium can induce duplication of the chromosomes and thus convert the organisms into females. The cytoplasmic bacterium forces haploid cells to go through incomplete mitosis to produce diploid cells which therefore will be female. This produces an entirely female population. If antibiotics are administered to populations which have become asexual in this way, they revert to sexuality instantly, as the cytoplasmic bacteria forcing this behaviour upon them are removed. =Cytoplasmic incompatibility= In many arthropods, zygotes produced by sperm of infected males and ova of non-infected females can be killed by Wolbachia or Cardinium. Evolution of sex Conflict between chromosomes has been proposed as an element in the evolution of sex. See also the author's blog post.

He played in Major League Baseball as a left-handed pitcher from through for the Pittsburgh Pirates and Boston Red Sox. Veale was one of the top strikeout pitchers in the National League during his tenure with the Pirates. The two-time All-Star player was the National League strikeout leader in . He was a member of the Pirates teams that won three consecutive National League Eastern Division titles between and and, won the World Series in . Veale also played for the Boston Red Sox from 1972 to 1974. Early life Veale was born in Birmingham, Alabama where he attended Holy Family High School in the Ensley neighborhood. His father had played baseball as a pitcher for the Homestead Grays of the Negro National League. As a boy, Veale worked the concession stand at Rickwood Field in Birmingham. The Birmingham Black Barons player-manager Piper Davis made him the team's batboy and let him pitch batting practice regularly. In 1948, Davis allowed the underaged Veale to pitch in a Black Barons game however, because he was a minor, his appearance was kept off the records. Veale left Birmingham in 1955 to attend Benedictine College in Atchison, Kansas on an athletic scholarship. Minor league career In 1958, Veale was signed by the Pittsburgh Pirates as an amateur free agent. In 1959, he led the Carolina League with 187 strikeouts in 147 innings and pitched a no-hitter for the Wilson Tobs. His performance earned him a promotion to the Columbus Jets of the International League where, he established himself as a strikeout pitcher in 1961 by striking out a league-leading 208 batters in 201 innings. Veale made his major league debut with the Pirates on April 16, 1962 at the age of 26. He had one complete game victory in only his second major league game but then, struggled and was sent back to the Columbus Jets on May 25. On August 10 he set an International League record for the most strikeouts in a game with 22 against the Buffalo Bisons. On September 3, he pitched a one-hitter against Jacksonville and struck out 15 batters. After striking out 179 batters in 134 innings and winning eight games, Veale was called back by the Pirates in September. Major league career Pirates manager Danny Murtaugh made Veale a starting pitcher in August 1963 and he responded impressively in September by throwing three complete games in six starts, including two shutouts. On September 22, 1964, Veale struck out 15 Milwaukee Braves to set the Pirates team record for most strikeouts in a nine-inning game, breaking the previous record of 12 set by Babe Adams in 1909. He led the National League with 250 strikeouts in 1964; he had been tied with Bob Gibson with 245 entering the final day of the season. He ended the season with a career-high record of 18-12 and a 2.74 earned run average. Veale's emergence as one of the top strikeout pitchers in the league helped earn him a spot on the National League team in the 1965 All- Star Game. He struck out 16 batters on June 1 against the Philadelphia Phillies to break his own team record. In 1965, he improved his personal best with a career-high 276 strikeouts but, finished a distant second to Sandy Koufax's then-Major League record 382 strikeouts. He ended the season with a 17-12 win-loss record and a 2.84 earned run average to help the Pirates improve to a third place finish in the National League. His 276 strikeouts in a season remains a Pirates modern-era team record. Veale was an integral member of the Pirates pitching staff during the 1966 season posting a 16-12 record and a 3.02 earned run average in 37 starts and was named to the National League team for the 1966 All-Star Game. The 1966 Pirates team which, included future Baseball Hall of Fame members Roberto Clemente, Bill Mazeroski and Willie Stargell as well as the National League batting champion Matty Alou, fought the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Francisco Giants in a tight pennant race and were in first place on September 10, before they faltered to finish the season in third place for a second consecutive year. Veale began the 1967 season by winning his first six starts and seven of his first eight starts. He ended the season with 16 victories against 8 losses but, his earned run average rose to 3.64. An elbow injury in 1968 forced him to alter his pitching motion and reduced his strikeout rates. Veale had a losing record of 13-14 but, had an impressive 2.05 ERA, the lowest ERA since by a pitcher with more than 20 starts and a losing record. In 1969 Veale had his last 200-plus strikeout season but, in 1970 his ERA rose to 3.92. Veale had maintained a 200-plus inning workload for seven consecutive seasons between 1964 and 1970. There were rumors that he might be traded prior to the 1971 season but instead, Murtaugh moved him to the bullpen. The 1971 season turned to be one of the most successful in team history as the Pirates won the National League Eastern Division. Veale had a 6-0 win-loss record in 37 appearances out the bullpen. Although his earned run average was a very high 6.99, he pitched strongly in September as the Pirates made their push for the division title. On September 1, 1971, the Pirates became the first major league team to start a lineup of all minorities. Veale entered the game in the third inning in relief of starter Dock Ellis. The Pirates then defeated the San Francisco Giants three games to one in the 1971 National League Championship Series to face the Baltimore Orioles in the 1971 World Series. In the only postseason appearance of his career, he faced five batters, allowing two inherited runners to score on two walks and one hit as the Orioles won 11-3 in Game 2. The Pirates would go on to win the World Series in seven games. On May 10, 1972 the Pirates released Veale and he agreed to accept an assignment to the Pirates' Triple-A team in Charleston. On September 1, the Boston Red Sox signed Veale and used him as a relief pitcher. He played in his final major league game on September 8, 1974 at the age of 38. Career statistics In a thirteen-season major league career, Veale posted a 120-95 record with 1,703 strikeouts and a 3.07 ERA in 1,926 innings pitched, including 20 shutouts and 78 complete games. His lifetime ratio of 7.96 strikeouts per nine innings is still a Pirates career team record and, ranks fifth all-time for pitchers with 1,500-plus innings and, 65th overall on the MLB All-Time List. His 16 strikeouts in a game remains a Pirates team record. When he retired in 1974, he was the only Pirate pitcher to have 200 strikeouts in a season. Veale ranks second to Bob Friend in Pirates career strikeouts. He was among the top three strikeout pitchers in the National League three times and, he led the league in walks four times, tying a modern record. Later life After his playing career, Veale worked as a minor-league pitching instructor for the Atlanta Braves and the New York Yankees. In 2006, Veale was inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame.

Of interest to visitors is the town church built during the Spanish era, with its ceiling frescoes and baroque architecture. A waterfall and a spring reservoir can be found on the highlands, accessible by road travel north. A marine sanctuary zone has been set up by the local government just off the shore. A double reef is protected inside the sanctuary zone and marked off by buoys to restrict access from fishers. Like Tagbilaran, Jagna is a port town. Ferries travel daily to and from other islands. Routes to Mindanao are available via Cagayan de Oro and Butuan. The island of Camiguin is visible from Jagna and a ferry operates from Jagna to the port of Balbagon in peak season. The town celebrates St. Michael's festival on 29 September. Highlights are cultural activities such as parades and street dancing. The month of May is also of interest, especially to returning Jagna-born Filipinos from across the islands and abroad. Celebrations of barangay fiestas occur almost everyday. History On 24 January 1744 an Italian Jesuit curate in charge of the town parish was killed by a native insurgent known as Francisco Dagohoy. This event signaled the beginning of the Dagohoy Rebellion ‚Äì the longest uprising in Philippine history. The Lonoy Massacre in 1901 was a bloody American surprise attack launched on Filipino insurgents ‚Äì the latter being led by Captain Gregorio Case√±as ‚Äì which were killed over 400, in the Philippine-American War. It was fought in the mountain village of Lonoy, north of the town proper. A major earthquake devastated the town in 1992. The local residents were evacuated to the nearby hills for a few days, as local authorities warned of a possible tsunami that might hit the coastal area. However, no such event happened. Some damage occurred to the church bell tower by the earthquake but has been completely repaired. Jagna has a new market; the last one burned down in 1998 and a temporary market was set up in the grass field across the church.

The town of Lila, Bohol celebrates its fiesta on October 10, to honor the town patron the Holy Rosary. History The coastal town of Lila once belonged to the Municipality of Dimiao. It was composed of the barrios of the municipalities of Loay and Dimiao. In 1899, during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, the municipal building, the church and neighboring houses were razed to the ground and burned. Thus, no records can be shown stating when Lila was annexed to the town of Dimiao. However, the Agustinian mission in Bohol has written that Lila was a separate municipality in 1879, with a population of 4,023. Later, a town was founded and part of the municipality was annexed back to Loay and part to Dimiao. From that time up to 1914, the municipal government of Lila ceased to function. However, in 1915 the municipality of Lila was re-established, with Celestino Oculam as Mayor. That part of Lila annexed to Dimiao and those annexed to Loay were returned and formed the new municipality of Lila. For the church, it was initially administered alternately by a priest stationed in Loay and Dimiao due to the scarcity of priests. It was only in 1921 that the priest of Lila had a residential parish. The church and the convent built then were only made of light materials. In 1915, during the administration of Fr. Narciso Maglasang, the present church was built. The convent was constructed under the administration of Fr. Miguel Ortega some time in the year 1941. After World War II, the town prospered.

Tourists also come to see the tarsier, a small nocturnal animal with large red eyes. It is one of the world's smallest primates. The Loboc Children's Choir has won numerous competitions both domestic and international. Until the 2013 earthquake, portions of the Loboc Church complex (specifically parts of what became the convent or priests' residence) were amongst the oldest standing ecclesiastical structures in Bohol province. The earthquake also damaged the lunch cruise Docking Port, and some damage to the pedestrian river bridge and its passenger elevator. At the end of 2014, Tropical storm Seniang passed directly over the Loboc river area. Although the winds were relatively low strength, Seniang brought with it much rainfall. This caused the river to burst its banks in several places: the entire poblacion main plaza was flooded, including the town hall; many of the lunch cruise boats were damaged; and the accumulated debris of the church was disturbed and some washed away. It was fortunate that the new replacement bridge across the river had been completed just a few weeks before, allowing traffic to reach Tagbilaran via Sikatuna because the Loay interior road was damaged and impassable. The Loboc Church is currently in the tentative list for UNESCO World Heritage Sites under the Baroque Churches of the Philippines (Extension). A proposal has been suggested by scholars to make a separate UNESCO inclusion for the Old Centre of Loboc which includes the Loboc Church. The same would be made for other churches listed in UNESCO's tentative sites, where each town plaza and surrounding heritage buildings would be added. No government agency has yet to take action on the proposal. History Since pre-Hispanic times, Loboc has always been an inland market village where produce from the sea was bartered for the agricultural goods of the upland regions. It is said to be the domain of Sigala, another chief of Bohol, whose contemporary, Sikatuna, made the famous Blood Compact with Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi in 1565. In 1596, the Jesuit Fr Juan de Torres came to Loboc from Baclayon to found the second Christian settlement on the island. After the traumatic Moro raid on Baclayon on 26 October 1600, the Jesuit missionaries decided to move the center of their missionary activities to the inland village of Loboc. By 1602, Loboc became a parish, making it the oldest on the island. To the Jesuits, Loboc was the \\"Residencia Boholana\\", where their local superior resided. It remained so until the middle of the 18th century when the exigencies of the times forced to them to move once more to Baclayon. Around 1604, the Jesuits established a \\"Seminario-Colegio\\" or boarding school for native boys. This school laid the foundation of the musical culture of the town. Today the name Loboc is synonymous with musical acumen. The Loboc Church is one of the most beautiful in the entire province. The first stone church was built in 1602. It was destroyed by fire in 1638 and its replacement built beside the site of the older one. This is the church presently standing, a fine example of the Jesuit colonial architecture of the 18th century. After the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1768, the Augustinian Recollects took over and renovated the unfinished structure. They were responsible for the free-standing bell tower, the arcade fa√ßade, the mortuary chapel, the heavy stone buttresses and the unique three- storey convent built into the fabric of the Jesuit-built 17th century church. Two saintly figures lived and were buried in Loboc church: Fr Alonso Humanes SJ whose grave became the object of pilgrimages after his death in 1633, and the native boy, Miguel Ayatumo, a student of the Seminario Colegio, who died in the odor of sanctity at the age of sixteen in 1609. Contemporary Jesuit records speak glowingly of this \\"Aloysius Gonzaga\\" of Bohol. Loboc Church contains a lot of interesting treasures. Among these are the decorative stone carvings and friezes on the exterior walls; a relief of St. Ignatius Loyola in polychrome stucco hidden behind the main altar, seven ancient retablos from both the Jesuit and Recollect periods; ceiling murals executed in the 1920s by Cebuano artists Ray Francia and Canuto Avila, one depicting the miracle of Our Lady of Guadalupe, the town's secondary patron, during the great flood of 1876; carved wooden cornices and decorative corbels shaped as gargoyles or mythical animals. Much of the early history of Bohol was made around the town and church of Loboc. It would not be an understatement to say that to know Loboc is to understand the entire drama of Bohol history. At present, Loboc church is deteriorating, ignored by tourists and visitors and continually threatened by the annual flood that has already robbed it of its ancient records and other priceless relics.

Members of the agency were central actors in the events that led to the Battle of Blair Mountain in 1921 and violent repressionhttps://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/rockefellers- ludlow/ of labor union members as part of the Coal Wars in such places as the Pocahontas Coalfield region of West Virginia, the Paint Creek-Cabin Creek strike of 1912 in West Virginia, 1913-1914 Colorado Coalfield War (including the Ludlow Massacre in 1914), and the Battle of Matewan in 1920. The agency was founded in the early 1890s by William Gibbony Baldwin as the Baldwin Detective Agency.  Formation  Baldwin, the senior member of the firm, was a native of Tazewell County, Virginia. An avid reader of detective novels in his youth, Baldwin was a small storekeeper in his early days. He then studied dentistry but left that profession to become a detective. He began his career in 1884 with the Eureka Detective Agency in Charleston, West Virginia. After founding the Baldwin Detective Agency, he then moved to Roanoke, Virginia, to oversee security operations in the Norfolk & Western Railway's coalfield district. He was later appointed chief special agent, a position he held until his retirement, in 1930. Thomas Lafayette Felts was a native of Galax, Virginia, who was educated as a lawyer and was a member of the Virginia Bar Association. In 1900, he joined the Baldwin Detective Agency as a partner who could provide legal advice to the firm. In 1910, the name of the agency was changed to the Baldwin‚ÄìFelts Detective Agency, and its headquarters were in Bluefield, West Virginia. Originally, the company provided investigative services to railroads for train robberies and other crimes.Velke III, John, The True Story of the Baldwin‚ÄìFelts Detective Agency, , (2004) Little is known about this chapter in the history of Baldwin‚ÄìFelts, but it is known that the company provided guards for railway and mine payrolls and accompanied coal trains into the coalfields. The company investigated train wrecks, robberies, and thefts. By the early 1900s, the agency had also undertaken detective work for both federal and state government agencies. National prominence The agency rose to national prominence with the pursuit and capture of the fugitive of Floyd Allen and members of his family who were involved in a courtroom shootout in Carroll County, Hillsville, Virginia. Five people died and seven were wounded, including Commonwealth Attorney William Foster, Sheriff Lewis F. Webb, and Judge Thornton Lemmon Massie. The event was reported nationally from March 13 to April 15, 1912. At the time, Virginia law required the local sheriff to head the criminal investigation and pursue those suspected of committing the killings. No provision for succession after his death had been provided for in the law, and his deputies lost all their legal powers until the next election. Faced with the dilemma, Virginia Governor William Hodges Mann sent a telegram to the Baldwin‚ÄìFelts agency to apprehend the fugitives: > Send troops to the County of Carroll at once. Mob violence, the court. > Commonwealth's Attorney, Sheriff, some jurors and others shot on the > conviction of Floyd Allen for a felony. Sheriff and Commonwealth's Attorney > dead, court serious. Look after this now.Williamson, Seth, The Roanoker > Magazine Allen Clan Hillsville Courthouse Shootout, Roanoker Magazine > (November 1982) Leisure Publishing Inc., retrieved 2006-08-24 The detectives cut a wide swathe through Carroll County in their quest. The wounded Allen was arrested at his hotel by Felts personally. Most of the Allens and their relations were arrested by a posse of Baldwin‚ÄìFelts detectives, who chased down the fugitives in a relentless search that was carried out regardless of weather conditions. Nevertheless, two of the men (Sidna Allen and Wesley Edwards) escaped to Des Moines, Iowa. An informant (Maude Iroller) tipped the agency as to the men's whereabouts, and the fugitives were arrested and brought back to Carroll County before the end of the year. Strike breakers By the 1910s, railroad crimes and associated banditry had decreased in the United States. Therefore, Baldwin‚ÄìFelts began hiring out their detectives as private security forces for mining companies and so the company is remembered for its violent confrontations with the labor unions. Baldwin‚ÄìFelts was allowed to operate like that because public law enforcement and the maintenance of order in labor disputes were often left to company owners. Therefore, they could employ the likes of Baldwin‚ÄìFelts to suppress strikes; collect intelligence on unions; prevent labor organizers from entering company grounds; and evict the families of union members living in company-owned housing who had gone on strike or failed to pay rent. In 1912, Baldwin‚ÄìFelts agents were soon employed strikebreaking in West Virginia at the Pocohantas Coal Fields and the Paint Creek-Cabin Creek. Their thuggish behaviour and their known propensity for violence led the former Attorney General of West Virginia, Howard B. Lee, to remark in his 1969 book that Baldwin and Felt were the \\"two most feared and hated men in the mountains.\\" Between 1913 and 1914, Baldwin‚ÄìFelts agents had moved west and become involved in another coal field struggle in Las Animas County, Colorado. Agency detectives were employed in squads to harass striking workers. They used an armored car with a mounted machine gun (it was called the Death Special by the miners). The events culminated in the violent confrontation known as the Ludlow Massacre, when the Colorado National Guard used machine guns to kill 21 people, including miners' wives and children. = Battle of Matewan = The most infamous striking breaking action undertaken by the Baldwin-Felts was in Matewan, West Virginia. A confrontation between locals and agents resulted in the deaths of two miners and Matewan's Mayor as well as seven Baldwin-Felts detectives including Thomas Felts' brothers, Albert and Lee. On May 19, 1920, 12 Baldwin-Felts agents, including Lee Felts, arrived in Matewan, West Virginia and met with Albert Felts, who was already in the area. Albert and Lee were the brothers of Thomas Felts, the co-owner and director of the agency. Albert had already been in the area and had tried to bribe Mayor Testerman with $500 to place machine guns on roofs in the town; Testerman refused. That afternoon Albert and Lee along with 11 other men set out to the Stone Mountain Coal Co. property. The first family they evicted was a woman and her children; the woman's husband was not home at the time. They forced them out at gunpoint and threw their belongings in the road under a light but steady rain. The miners who saw it were furious, and sent word to town. As the agents walked to the train station to leave town, Police Chief Sid Hatfield and a group of deputized miners confronted them and told them they were under arrest. Albert Felts replied that in fact he had a warrant for Hatfield's arrest. Testerman was alerted, and he ran out into the street after a miner shouted that Sid had been arrested. Hatfield backed into the store and Testerman asked to see the warrant. After reviewing it, the mayor exclaimed, \\"This is a bogus warrant.\\" With these words, a gunfight erupted and Hatfield shot Albert Felts. Testerman and Albert and Lee Felts were among the ten men killed (three from the town and seven from the agency). Albert and Lee Felts were buried in Galax, Virginia in what is now the Felts Memorial Cemetery. Their funeral was attended by over 3,000 people.Velke III, John, The True Story of the Baldwin‚ÄìFelts Detective Agency, , (2004) This gunfight became known as the Matewan Massacre, and its symbolic significance was enormous for the miners. The seemingly invincible Baldwin-Felts had been beaten. Sid Hatfield became an immediate legend and hero to the union miners, and a symbol of hope that the oppression of coal operators and their hired guns could be overthrown. Throughout the summer and into the fall of 1920 the union gained strength in Mingo County, as did the resistance of the coal operators. Low- intensity warfare was waged up and down the Tug River. In late June state police under the command of Captain Brockus raided the Lick Creek tent colony near Williamson. Miners were said to have fired on Brockus and Martin's men from the colony, and in response the state police shot and arrested miners, ripped the canvas tents to shreds and scattered the mining families' belongings. Both sides were bolstering their arms, and Sid Hatfield continued to be a problem, especially when he converted Testerman's jewelry store into a gun shop. On January 26, 1921, the trial of Hatfield for killing Albert Felts began. It was in the national spotlight and brought much attention to the miners' cause. Hatfield's stature and mythical status grew as the trial proceeded. He posed and talked to reporters, fanning the flames of his own legend. All men were acquitted in the end, but overall the union was facing significant setbacks. Eighty percent of mines had reopened with the importation of replacements and the signing of yellow-dog contracts by ex- strikers returning to the mines. In mid-May 1921 union miners launched a full- scale assault on non-union mines. In a short time the conflict had consumed the entire Tug River Valley. This \\"Three Days Battle\\" was finally ended by a flag of truce and the implementation of martial law. From the beginning, the miners perceived the enforcement of martial law as one-sided. Hundreds of miners were arrested; the smallest of infractions could mean imprisonment, while those on the side of \\"law and order\\" were seen as immune. The miners responded with guerrilla tactics and violence. In the midst of this tense situation, Hatfield traveled to McDowell County on 1 August 1921 to stand trial on charges of dynamiting a coal tipple. Along with him traveled a good friend, Ed Chambers, and their wives. As they walked up the courthouse stairs, unarmed and flanked by their wives, a group of Baldwin-Felts agents standing at the top of the stairs opened fire. Hatfield was killed instantly. Chambers was bullet-riddled and rolled to the bottom of the stairs. Despite Sally Chambers' protests, one of the agents (Charles Everett Lively) ran down the stairs and shot Chambers once more, point blank in the back of the head. Hatfield's and Chambers' bodies were returned to Matewan, and word of the slayings spread through the mountains. The miners were angry at the way Hatfield had been slain, and that it appeared the assassins would escape punishment. They began to pour out of the mountains and take up arms.  Final years & closure Both Baldwin and Felts were also involved in banking, and Baldwin later served as president and member of the board of directors of several banks. Felts was later elected to two terms as a Virginia state senator. Baldwin died in 1936, at 75; Felts died a year later, at 69. In 1937, four months before his death, Felts had formally dissolved the Baldwin‚ÄìFelts Detective Agency. By then, strikebreaking work had declined. State and federal legislation outlawing the use of private detectives for the purpose of spying on or harassing workers, along with shifting public opinion, had made such detectives less useful to management in labor disputes. After the agency closed its doors, most of the company's files were destroyed or lost. The largest collection of extant files is housed at the Eastern Regional Coal Archives, in Bluefield, West Virginia.

The town is named after Datu Sikatuna, the ancient chieftain of Bohol, although there is no evidence he lived in the area. The town of Sikatuna,Bohol celebrates its feast on June 12‚Äì13, to honor the town patron Saint Anthony De Padua. History Sikatuna was formerly a part of the towns of Baclayon and Alburquerque. While part of Baclayon, Sikatuna was known as barrio Cambojod. Once Alburquerque became a town, Sikatuna was made a part of its new territory and given the name Cornago. Sikatuna became its own town in 1917. The ten barangays that now comprise Sikatuna were taken from three neighboring old municipalities: Alburquerque, Loboc, and Balilihan. In the original municipal ordinance converting barrio Cornago into a municipality, the municipal boundary was defined as barrio Cornago plus four northern barrios of Alburquerque: Libjo, Abucay Sur, Abucay Norte, and Can-agong. However, Senator Jose A. Clarin helped increase the territorial boundary by taking two barrios from Loboc: Cambuac Sur and Cambuac Norte; and two barrios from Balilihan: Badiang and Bahay-bahay. Cornago was divided into Poblacion I and Poblacion II. =World War II= During the Japanese occupation of the Philippines, Japanese forces established a garrison at the municipal building and installed a puppet mayor. During this time, Sikatuna became a haven for evacuees, both from neighboring towns and from nearby Cebu. The most famous evacuee was Don Mariano Jesus Cuenco who, after the war, became Senator and later, Secretary of Public Works. In 1945, Sikatuna was entered by Philippine Commonwealth Army soldiers and Boholano guerrillas fought against the Japanese Imperial forces during the Second Battle of Bohol.

The town of Talibon, Bohol celebrates its feast on the last Saturday of May, to honor the town patron the Blessed Trinity. Islands in Talibon, including Nocnocan, Calituban and Guindacpan are considered to be one of the densely populated islands in the world. Etymology The name Talibon is said to come from the word talibong which means bolo or spear, an instrument used in gold mining. There is no actual record to show how the name came about but per the records of the travels of Jesuit missionary, Fr. Juan de Torres, he went to the gold mines of Talibong. It already had its name before the first arrival of the first Spanish missionary. History According to archival researches of Fr. Jose Maria Luengo, priest, historian, and founder of the Mater Dei College of Tubigon, Talibon traces its history back to the time of Ferdinand Magellan after his death on 27 April 1521. Escaping from the hands of Lapu-Lapu's men, who were bent on revenge for the raping of 50 virgins of Cebu, the ship Trinidad sailed in the direction of Getafe and Talibon, where some of the crew disembarked and mingled with the natives of the place. Taking native wives and teaching them the rudiments of Christianity, they dedicated the place where they lived to the Most Holy Trinity (Santisima Trinidad) in honor of the patrons of their fateful ship. The survivors became the first lay missionaries to Bohol and Fr. Luengo called them the Trinidad Christians of Talibon. In 1830, Talibon was established as an independent municipality from Inabanga. The following year, Talibon became a parish dedicated to the Most Holy Trinity, with Fr. Ramon de Santa Ana as the first parish priest. At first, a ramshackle hut built by the natives served as the church but in 1852 construction of the permanent church was started. With forced labor and the use of blocks of coral rocks, the church was built on an elevated plain overlooking the sea and finished in 1899. During World War II, a guerrilla force was organized and took control and authority over the town of Talibon. Senator Carlos P. Garcia, acted as High Adviser to the group and during the Japanese occupation, narrowly escaped capture by fleeing with his family to Leyte. In reprisal, the Japanese soldiers burned down the Garcia house on 4 July 1942. In 1957, when Carlos P. Garcia became the fourth president of the Philippines, the church was renovated. In 1986, the Diocese of Talibon was created. Geography The town of Talibon is located on the northern side of Bohol. It is bounded on the east by Bien Unido, on the south by Trinidad on the north by Camotes Sea and on the west by Getafe. Talibon has a land area of of which about (%) is classified as urban, while the remaining is rural. It is accessible by land from capital Tagbilaran via western or eastern exits of Bohol Circumferential Road, which are respectively, or through the interior road via Loboc which is . It can be accessed by boat direct from Cebu City or via Tubigon then by land from Tubigon to Talibon. =Barangays= Map of Talibon showing barangays and islands Talibon comprises 25 barangays: 17 mainland and 8 island barangays. =Climate= Demographics Municipal Hall of Talibon Economy Major industries in Talibon are farming and fishing with major products rice, corn, copra, banana and root crops. It is fast becoming a haven for retailers and wholesalers. It is home to one branch of Alturas group of companies which has established a supermarket in the area. Local folks are also into seaweeds farming, rice farming, watermelon farming, and making of fish traps, hats, and pottery. Silica, gold, clay, diorites, sand and gravel abound and quarrying of these minerals is big business at present. Eco-tourism Talibon for years has its share of foreign and domestic tourists who were lured to the town for its unexploited beaches, fresh seafood such as crabs and prawns, friendliness of the people and the general atmosphere of peace and order in the town and the neighboring barrios. People also come to see the historic site, the Carlos P. Garcia Monument and Park; the location of which is the birthplace of this son of Talibon who played an important role during the guerilla movement and more so when he became the 4th President of the Republic of the Philippines. There are islands that have long been unexploited and surrounded by crystal clear waters and rich marine life. One such islet is the Bongan sandbar, a breathtaking long sandy white beach devoid of vegetation whatsoever. It is a good place to swim, snorkel or scuba dive. A relatively unknown natural treasure is the Danajon Bank, which is the Philippines' only double barrier reef and one of the few documented double barrier reefs in the world. A very rare geological formation, it comprises two sets of large coral reefs that formed offshore on a submarine ridge due to a combination of favorable tidal currents and coral growth in the area. Talibon town shares responsibility over Danajon together with 9 other Bohol towns that have jurisdiction over the reef. Danajon Bank is home to a vast array of commercially valuable reef fishes, shellfish, crustaceans and invertebrates such as sea cucumbers and sea urchins. Its extensive seagrass beds are nursery and feeding grounds for various species of rabbitfish (siganids) and sea horses, while its mangroves are spawning habitats for crustaceans, shrimps and various fishes. In order to showcase and promote efforts to protect and manage Danajon Bank, the Municipal Government of Talibon opened the CRM Interpretive Center, otherwise known as the Fisheries and Coastal Resource Management Interpretive Center (FCRMIC). Aside from a very educational gallery, the Center boasts a 3D model of Danajon Bank, the first of its kind in Bohol and even in the whole of the Visayas. It is now becoming a drop-in site for school and foreign tours alike. Aware of the vast tourism potential of Talibon, the present administration has set up an \\"Eco- Tourism Program\\" geared towards the development and promotion of Talibon's assets. Aside from the abovementioned sites, the local government is eyeing the promotion of the of lush mangrove vegetation as an eco-tourist destination. The winding Ipil River is another area that has to be promoted for boating, kayaking, and other activities such as fishing, swimming, and the gathering of shells and mollusks that abound in the area. Going inland from the river, one will see wild ducks, herons, and egrets; and in San Isidro, a mangrove area has become the dwelling place of monkeys. Another attraction is the centuries-old piyapi trees growing abundantly in the area. Education Almost every barangay in its vicinity has its public elementary school, making students, teachers, and parents like have a sufficient array of choices; as do secondary schools have an abundant selection to private and public education. Diocese of Talibon Roman Catholic Church, Talibon The diocese of Talibon comprises half the civil province of Bohol. The territory covered by the diocese of Talibon extends from the town of Inabanga on the northwest, through Carmen in the interior, and down to Jagna on the southeast. Its inland boundary bisects the island northwest‚Äîsoutheast, with the other half of the island under the jurisdiction of the diocese of Tagbilaran. The first batch of missionaries to arrive were the Augustinian Recollects who came in 1565. When the Jesuits arrived in 1596 and reached the area of Talibon, they were surprised to discover that a Christian community already existed in the area, owing to the Spanish‚ÄìTalibongnon intermarriages dating back to the 1520s. After the Jesuits came, the faith spread fast revolts in the country against Spain. Tamblot revolted in 1622. Although his success lasted only for six months, his revolt is recorded as the first unbeaten revolt in Philippine history. In 1744 Dagohoy revolted and gained independence for the island of Bohol for eighty years. On 8 November 1941, the Diocese of Tagbilaran was established and was given jurisdiction over the entire province of Bohol, separating it from Cebu, its mother diocese. On 9 January 1986, the new Diocese of Talibon was created, separating half of Bohol from the Diocese of Tagbilaran. Most Rev. Christian Vicente Fernandez Noel, D.D., was appointed as its first bishop in September 1986 and whose office he held until Pope Francis appointed Most Rev. Patrick Daniel Y. Parcon, D.D. on 6 June 2014 as its second bishop, and eventually installed on 22 August 2014. Today there are 25 parishes in the diocese, ministered by 50 priests. There are also 35 religious sisters active in the running of 16 secondary Catholic schools.

The municipality of Tubigon, Bohol celebrates its feast on May 10, to honor the town patron San Isidro Labrador. History The first settlers in Tubigon settled along the shores of the river that flows through the community. Their exact origins are unknown but they are thought to be early Malays from southeast Asian countries, migrating to the Philippines in small bangkas. Seasonal overflowing of the river flooded the community and led the place to be called \\"Tubigan\\" (meaning \\"place having water\\" or \\"watery\\"), which later morphed into \\"Tubigon\\" (meaning \\"place abounding in water\\"). The first record of the town of Tubigon dates from the early part of the 17th century. In 1816, the community organized itself under a recognized headman, Yguiz Hutora, who was succeeded by teniente Mijares and by teniente Matong in 1818. A chapel was built on an elevated site of the settlement but had no officiating priest. A coadjutor of the Spanish friars from the Calape parish would perform the religious ceremonies. In 1819, by authority of the Spanish Governor of Cebu, Tubigon was formally organized into an independent town by separating from the town of Calape, with Capitan Teniente Matong becoming the first gobernadorcillo. Starting in 1852, the exact boundaries of the municipality were defined. On 8 March of that year, sitio Bacane was made the boundary between Tubigon and Inabanga. In 1856, the boundary with Calape was fixed at Mandaug. On 19 June 1865, the boundary between Tubigon and Catigbian was set at the Sampilangon River and on 14 September 1913, the boundary with Antequera (currently San Isidro) was fixed at sitio Tubod. On 31 January 1919, Tubigon lost five barrios when Clarin was formed by virtue of proclamation by Governor Yeater. Tubigon was badly affected by the 2013 Bohol earthquake, suffering 11 fatalities and damage to some 7,300 homes, as well as total destruction of its town hall and church.

For their secondary education, students go to Valencia High School, a public school. Valencia is the birthplace of former Executive Secretary Juan Pajo. The town of Valencia, Bohol celebrates its feast on January 10, to honor the town patron Sr. Santo Ni√±o. History Its former name used to be Panangatan, which comes from the root word sang-at, meaning \\"to put up on an elevated place\\". This referred to the practice of fishermen from Dimiao and Lila who would put up (sang-at) their boats on the banks of the Panangatan River when taking shelter during the southwest monsoons. Here nipa palms grew along the river, preventing the boats from being washed away by the waves. Panangatan remained part of Dimiao until 1867. That year a Spanish priest was assigned to the place and it became a separate municipality. The priest gave it a new name, naming after his birthplace in Spain. In 1879 Valencia had a population of 7,009. Barangays Valencia comprises 35 barangays: Climate Demographics Economy Valencia Public Market The principal industries of the people today are weaving, pot making, and fishing. The most important produce is coconuts, rice, corn and fish. Market day, locally known as Tabu, is Sunday. Local produce such as fresh fruits, vegetable, fresh meat and live poultry are sold. The days of this weekly community occasion differ from town to town. Badiang Spring resort in barangay Anas is a major contribution to local economic activity. Badiang Spring has continuously flowing water from subterranean rocks, which is its main attraction. Not just domestic tourists but foreign tourists too frequent the lot by the shore. Badiang Spring has separate swimming pools for adults and children as well as accommodation facilities. Culture =Valencia Parish Church= Roman Catholic Church, Valencia The parish of the Santo Ni√±o and the town of Valencia began as barrio Panangatan of Dimiao. Together with adjacent barrios, it was constituted a town in 1869 and a parish in 1871 and named after a city on Spain's southern coast. The church building commenced during the term of Fray Mariano Cornago (1870‚Äì77) and was completed in 1882 by Fray Francisco Arraya, who laid the church's wooden floor. The church walls were of tabique but were later replaced by cement. Heritage Site: The church is cruciform with a steep roof and a pyramidal crossing tower. Cut stone is used in parts of the church like the fa√ßade, however, concrete is found elsewhere. The real treasure of the church is its wooden floor of alternating dark (tindalo or balayong) and light (molave or tugas) wood planks. At the transept crossing an eight pointed flower design is used for the floor, while a herringbone pattern is used elsewhere. The interior is unpainted, unlike most Bohol churches and has altars in the neoclassical idiom. The convent is located not beside the church as is customary but across the street. This structure was renovated in the 19th century. The fencing of the entire campus of the convent is recent.

As digital technology has improved in recent years, this practice has become dominant. Since the mid-2010s, most movies across the world are captured as well as distributed digitally. Many vendors have brought products to market, including traditional film camera vendors like Arri and Panavision, as well as new vendors like RED, Blackmagic, Silicon Imaging, Vision Research and companies which have traditionally focused on consumer and broadcast video equipment, like Sony, GoPro, and Panasonic. , professional 4K digital film cameras were approximately equal to 35mm film in their resolution and dynamic range capacity, however, digital film still has a different look to analog film. Some filmmakers still prefer to use analogue picture formats to achieve the desired results. History The basis for digital cameras are metal- oxide-semiconductor (MOS) image sensors. The first practical semiconductor image sensor was the charge-coupled device (CCD), based on MOS capacitor technology. Following the commercialization of CCD sensors during the late 1970s to early 1980s, the entertainment industry slowly began transitioning to digital imaging and digital video over the next two decades. The CCD was followed by the CMOS active-pixel sensor (CMOS sensor), developed in the 1990s. Beginning in the late 1980s, Sony began marketing the concept of \\"electronic cinematography,\\" utilizing its analog Sony HDVS professional video cameras. The effort met with very little success. However, this led to one of the earliest high definition video shot feature movies, Julia and Julia (1987). Rainbow (1996) was the world's first film utilizing extensive digital post production techniques. Shot entirely with Sony's first Solid State Electronic Cinematography cameras and featuring over 35 minutes of digital image processing and visual effects, all post production, sound effects, editing and scoring were completed digitally. The Digital High Definition image was transferred to 35mm negative via electron beam recorder for theatrical release. The first digitally filmed and post produced feature film was Windhorse, shot in Tibet and Nepal in 1996 on a prototype of the digital- beta Sony DVW-700WS and the prosumer Sony DCE-VX1000. The offline editing (Avid) and the online post and color work (Roland House / da Vinci) were also all digital. The film, transferred to 35mm negative for theatrical release, won Best U.S. Feature at the Santa Barbara Film Festival in 1998. In 1998, with the introduction of HDCAM recorders and 1920 √ó 1080 pixel digital professional video cameras based on CCD technology, the idea, now re-branded as \\"digital cinematography,\\" began to gain traction in the market. Shot and released in 1998, The Last Broadcast is believed by some to be the first feature-length video shot and edited entirely on consumer-level digital equipment.The Last Broadcast is A First: The Making of a Digital Feature http://www.thelastbroadcastmovie.com/ In May 1999 George Lucas challenged the supremacy of the movie-making medium of film for the first time by including footage filmed with high-definition digital cameras in Star Wars: Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace. The digital footage blended seamlessly with the footage shot on film and he announced later that year he would film its sequels entirely on hi-def digital video. Also in 1999, digital projectors were installed in four theaters for the showing of The Phantom Menace. In June 2000, Star Wars: Episode II ‚Äì Attack of the Clones began principal photography shot entirely using a Sony HDW-F900 camera as Lucas had previously stated. The film was released in May 2002. In May 2001 Once Upon a Time in Mexico was also shot in 24 frame-per-second high-definition digital video, partially developed by George Lucas using a Sony HDW-F900 camera, following Robert Rodriguez's introduction to the camera at Lucas' Skywalker Ranch facility whilst editing the sound for Spy Kids. Two lesser-known movies, Vidocq (2001) and Russian Ark (2002), had also been shot with the same camera, the latter notably consisting of a single long take. Today, cameras from companies like Sony, Panasonic, JVC and Canon offer a variety of choices for shooting high-definition video. At the high-end of the market, there has been an emergence of cameras aimed specifically at the digital cinema market. These cameras from Sony, Vision Research, Arri, Silicon Imaging, Panavision, Grass Valley and Red offer resolution and dynamic range that exceeds that of traditional video cameras, which are designed for the limited needs of broadcast television. In 2009, Slumdog Millionaire became the first movie shot mainly in digital to be awarded the Academy Award for Best Cinematography. The second highest-grossing movie in the history of cinema, Avatar, not only was shot on digital cameras as well, but also made the main revenues at the box office no longer by film, but digital projection. Major films shot on digital video overtook those shot on film in 2013. Since 2016 over 90% of major films were shot on digital video. , 92% of films are shot on digital. Only 24 major films released in 2018 were shot on 35mm. Technology Digital cinematography captures motion pictures digitally in a process analogous to digital photography. While there is no clear technical distinction that separates the images captured in digital cinematography from video, the term \\"digital cinematography\\" is usually applied only in cases where digital acquisition is substituted for film acquisition, such as when shooting a feature film. The term is seldom applied when digital acquisition is substituted for video acquisition, as with live broadcast television programs. =Recording= Cameras Arriflex D-21 Professional cameras include the Sony CineAlta(F) Series, Blackmagic Cinema Camera, RED ONE, Arriflex D-20, D-21 and Alexa, Panavisions Genesis, Silicon Imaging SI-2K, Thomson Viper, Vision Research Phantom, IMAX 3D camera based on two Vision Research Phantom cores, Weisscam HS-1 and HS-2, GS Vitec noX, and the Fusion Camera System. Independent micro-budget filmmakers have also pressed low-cost consumer and prosumer cameras into service for digital filmmaking. Flagship smartphones like the Apple iPhone have been used to shoot movies like Unsane (shot on the iPhone 7 Plus) and Tangerine (shot on three iPhone 5S phones) and in January 2018, Unsane's director and Oscar winner Steven Soderbergh expressed an interest in filming other productions solely with iPhones going forward. Sensors Digital cinematography cameras capture digital images using image sensors, either charge-coupled device (CCD) sensors or CMOS active-pixel sensors, usually in one of two arrangements. Single chip cameras designed specifically for the digital cinematography market often use a single sensor (much like digital photo cameras), with dimensions similar in size to a 16 or 35 mm film frame or even (as with the Vision 65) a 65 mm film frame. An image can be projected onto a single large sensor exactly the same way it can be projected onto a film frame, so cameras with this design can be made with PL, PV and similar mounts, in order to use the wide range of existing high-end cinematography lenses available. Their large sensors also let these cameras achieve the same shallow depth of field as 35 or 65 mm motion picture film cameras, which many cinematographers consider an essential visual tool. Codecs Professional RAW video recording codecs include Blackmagic RAW, RED RAW, ARRI RAW and Canon RAW. Video formats Unlike other video formats, which are specified in terms of vertical resolution (for example, 1080p, which is 1920√ó1080 pixels), digital cinema formats are usually specified in terms of horizontal resolution. As a shorthand, these resolutions are often given in \\"nK\\" notation, where n is the multiplier of 1024 such that the horizontal resolution of a corresponding full-aperture, digitized film frame is exactly 1024n pixels. Here the \\"K\\" has a customary meaning corresponding to the binary prefix \\"kibi\\" (ki). For instance, a 2K image is 2048 pixels wide, and a 4K image is 4096 pixels wide. Vertical resolutions vary with aspect ratios though; so a 2K image with an HDTV (16:9) aspect ratio is 2048√ó1152 pixels, while a 2K image with a SDTV or Academy ratio (4:3) is 2048√ó1536 pixels, and one with a Panavision ratio (2.39:1) would be 2048√ó856 pixels, and so on. Due to the \\"nK\\" notation not corresponding to specific horizontal resolutions per format a 2K image lacking, for example, the typical 35mm film soundtrack space, is only 1828 pixels wide, with vertical resolutions rescaling accordingly. This led to a plethora of motion-picture related video resolutions, which is quite confusing and often redundant with respect to the relatively few available projection standards. All formats designed for digital cinematography are progressive scan, and capture usually occurs at the same 24 frame per second rate established as the standard for 35mm film. Some films such as The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey have a High Frame Rate of 48 fps, although in some theatres it was also released in a 24 fps version which many fans of traditional film prefer. The DCI standard for cinema usually relies on a 1.89:1 aspect ratio, thus defining the maximum container size for 4K as 4096√ó2160 pixels and for 2K as 2048√ó1080 pixels. When distributed in the form of a Digital Cinema Package (DCP), content is letterboxed or pillarboxed as appropriate to fit within one of these container formats. center In the early years of digital cinematography, 2K was the most common format for digitally acquired major motion pictures however, as new camera systems gain acceptance, 4K is becoming more prominent. The Arri Alexa captured a 2.8k image. During 2009 at least two major Hollywood films, Knowing and District 9, were shot in 4K on the RED ONE camera, followed by The Social Network in 2010. , 4K cameras are now commonplace, with most high-end films being shot at 4K resolution. =Data storage= Broadly, two workflow paradigms are used for data acquisition and storage in digital cinematography. Tape-based workflows With video- tape-based workflow, video is recorded to tape on set. This video is then ingested into a computer running non-linear editing software, using a deck. Upon ingestion, a digital video stream from tape is converted to computer files. These files can be edited directly or converted to an intermediate format for editing. Then video is output in its final format, possibly to a film recorder for theatrical exhibition, or back to video tape for broadcast use. Original video tapes are kept as an archival medium. The files generated by the non-linear editing application contain the information necessary to retrieve footage from the proper tapes, should the footage stored on the computer's hard disk be lost. With increasing convenience of file-based workflows, the tape-based workflows have become marginal in recent years. File-based workflows Digital cinematography has mostly shifted towards \\"tapeless\\" or \\"file-based\\" workflows. This trend has accelerated with increased capacity and reduced cost of non-linear storage solutions such as hard disk drives, optical discs, and solid-state memory. With tapeless workflows digital video is recorded as digital files onto random-access media like optical discs, hard disk drives or flash memory-based digital \\"magazines\\". These files can be easily copied to another storage device, typically to a large RAID (array of computer disks) connected to an editing system. Once data is copied from the on-set media to the storage array, they are erased and returned to the set for more shooting. Such RAID arrays, both of \\"managed\\" (for example, SANs and NASs) and \\"unmanaged\\" (for example, JBoDs on a single computer workstation), are necessary due to the throughput required for real-time (320 MB/s for 2K @ 24fps) or near-real-time playback in post-production, compared to throughput available from a single, yet fast, hard disk drive. Such requirements are often termed as \\"on-line\\" storage. Post-production not requiring real-time playback performances (typically for lettering, subtitling, versioning and other similar visual effects) can be migrated to slightly slower RAID stores. Short-term archiving, \\"if ever\\", is accomplished by moving the digital files into \\"slower\\" RAID arrays (still of either managed and unmanaged type, but with lower performances), where playback capability is poor to non-existent (unless via proxy images), but minimal editing and metadata harvesting is still feasible. Such intermediate requirements easily fall into the \\"mid-line\\" storage category. Long-term archiving is accomplished by backing up the digital files from the RAID, using standard practices and equipment for data backup from the IT industry, often to data tapes (like LTOs). Chroma subsampling Most digital cinematography systems further reduce data rate by subsampling color information. Because the human visual system is much more sensitive to luminance than to color, lower resolution color information can be overlaid with higher resolution luma (brightness) information, to create an image that looks very similar to one in which both color and luma information are sampled at full resolution. This scheme may cause pixelation or color bleeding under some circumstances. High quality digital cinematography systems are capable of recording full resolution color data (4:4:4) or raw sensor data. Intra- frame vs. Inter-frame compression Most compression systems used for acquisition in the digital cinematography world compress footage one frame at a time, as if a video stream is a series of still images. This is called intra-frame compression. Inter-frame compression systems can further compress data by examining and eliminating redundancy between frames. This leads to higher compression ratios, but displaying a single frame will usually require the playback system to decompress a number of frames from before & after it. In normal playback this is not a problem, as each successive frame is played in order, so the preceding frames have already been decompressed. In editing, however, it is common to jump around to specific frames and to play footage backwards or at different speeds. Because of the need to decompress extra frames in these situations, inter-frame compression can cause performance problems for editing systems. Inter-frame compression is also disadvantageous because the loss of a single frame (say, due to a flaw writing data to a tape) will typically ruin all the frames until the next keyframe occurs. In the case of the HDV format, for instance, this may result in as many as 6 frames being lost with 720p recording, or 15 with 1080i.recording adamwilt.com An inter- frame compressed video stream consists of groups of pictures (GOPs), each of which has only one full frame, and a handful of other frames referring to this frame. If the full frame, called I-frame, is lost due to transmission or media error, none of the P-frames or B-frames (the referenced images) can be displayed. In this case, the whole GOP is lost. DCT vs. DWT compression Discrete cosine transform (DCT) coding is the most common data compression process used in digital film recording and editing, including the JPEG image compression standard and various video coding standards such as DV, DigiBeta, HDCAM, Apple ProRes, Avid DNxHD, MPEG, Advanced Video Coding (AVC) and AVCHD. An alternative to DCT coding is JPEG 2000 discrete wavelet transform (DWT) coding, used in the Redcode and DCI XYZ video codecs as well as digital cinema distribution. =Digital distribution= For theaters with digital projectors, digital films may be distributed digitally, either shipped to theaters on hard drives or sent via the Internet or satellite networks. Digital Cinema Initiatives, LLC, a joint venture of Disney, Fox, MGM, Paramount, Sony Pictures Entertainment, Universal and Warner Bros. Studios, has established standards for digital cinema projection. In July 2005, they released the first version of the Digital Cinema System Specification, which encompasses 2K and 4K theatrical projection. They also offer compliance testing for exhibitors and equipment suppliers. JPEG 2000, a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) based image compression standard developed by the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) between 1997 and 2000, was selected as the video coding standard for digital cinema in 2004. Theater owners initially balked at installing digital projection systems because of high cost and concern over increased technical complexity. However new funding models, in which distributors pay a \\"digital print\\" fee to theater owners, have helped to alleviate these concerns. Digital projection also offers increased flexibility with respect to showing trailers and pre-show advertisements and allowing theater owners to more easily move films between screens or change how many screens a film is playing on, and the higher quality of digital projection provides a better experience to help attract consumers who can now access high-definition content at home. These factors have resulted in digital projection becoming an increasingly attractive prospect for theater owners, and the pace of adoption has been rapidly increasing. Since some theaters currently don't have digital projection systems, even if a movie is shot and post-produced digitally, it must be transferred to film if a large theatrical release is planned. Typically, a film recorder will be used to print digital image data to film, to create a 35 mm internegative. After that the duplication process is identical to that of a traditional negative from a film camera. Comparison with film cinematography =Resolution= Unlike a digital sensor, a film frame does not have a regular grid of discrete pixels. Determining resolution in digital acquisition seems straightforward, but it is significantly complicated by the way digital camera sensors work in the real world. This is particularly true in the case of high-end digital cinematography cameras that use a single large bayer pattern CMOS sensor. A bayer pattern sensor does not sample full RGB data at every point; instead, each pixel is biased toward red, green or blue, and a full color image is assembled from this checkerboard of color by processing the image through a demosaicing algorithm. Generally with a bayer pattern sensor, actual resolution will fall somewhere between the \\"native\\" value and half this figure, with different demosaicing algorithms producing different results. Additionally, most digital cameras (both bayer and three-chip designs) employ optical low-pass filters to avoid aliasing; suboptimal antialiasing filtering can further reduce system resolution. =Grain and noise= Film has a characteristic grain structure. Different film stocks have different grain. Digitally acquired footage lacks this grain structure. It has electronic noise. =Digital intermediate workflow and archiving= The process of using digital intermediate workflow, where movies are color graded digitally instead of via traditional photochemical finishing techniques, has become common. In order to utilize digital intermediate workflow with film, the camera negative must first be processed and then scanned to a digital format. Some filmmakers have years of experience achieving their artistic vision using the techniques available in a traditional photochemical workflow, and prefer that finishing/editing process. Digitally shot movies can be printed, transferred or archived on film. Large scale digital productions are often archived on film, as it provides a safer medium for storage, benefiting insurance and storage costs. As long as the negative does not completely degrade, it will always be possible to recover the images from it in the future, regardless of changes in technology, since all that will be involved is simple photographic reproduction. In contrast, even if digital data is stored on a medium that will preserve its integrity, highly specialized digital equipment will always be required to reproduce it. Changes in technology may thus render the format unreadable or expensive to recover over time. For this reason, film studios distributing digitally-originated films often make film-based separation masters of them for archival purposes. =Reliability= Film proponents have argued that early digital cameras lack the reliability of film, particularly when filming sequences at high speed or in chaotic environments, due to digital cameras' technical glitches. Cinematographer Wally Pfister noted that for his shoot on the film Inception, \\"Out of six times that we shot on the digital format, we only had one useable piece and it didn't end up in the film. Out of the six times we shot with the Photo-Sonics camera and 35mm running through it, every single shot was in the movie.\\" Michael Bay stated that when filming Transformers: Dark of the Moon, 35mm cameras had to be used when filming in slow-motion and sequences where the digital cameras were subject to strobing or electrical damage from dust. Since 2015 digital has almost totally replaced film for high speed sequences up to 1000 frames per second. Criticism and concerns Some film directors such as Christopher Nolan, Paul Thomas Anderson and Quentin Tarantino have publicly criticized digital cinema, and advocated the use of film and film prints. Tarantino has suggested he may retire because he will no longer be able to have his films projected in 35mm in most American cinemas. Tarantino considers digital cinema to be simply \\"television in public.\\" Christopher Nolan has speculated that the film industry's adoption of digital formats has been driven purely by economic factors as opposed to digital being a superior medium to film: \\"I think, truthfully, it boils down to the economic interest of manufacturers and [a production] industry that makes more money through change rather than through maintaining the status quo.\\" Another concern with digital image capture is how to archive all the digital material. Archiving digital material is turning out to be extremely costly, and it creates issues in terms of long-term preservation. In a 2007 study, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences found that the cost of storing 4K digital masters is \\"enormously higher ‚Äì 1100% higher ‚Äì than the cost of storing film masters.\\" Furthermore, digital archiving faces challenges due to the insufficient longevity of today's digital storage: no current media, be it magnetic hard drives or digital tape, can reliably store a film for a hundred years, something that properly stored and handled film can do. Although this also used to be the case with optical disc, in 2012 Millenniata, Inc. a digital storage company based in Utah, released M-DISC, an optical storage solution, designed to last up to 1,000 years, thus, offering a possibility of digital storage as a viable storage solution.

Her parents were Beverly Dennis and Russell Dennis, both of whom were actors throughout the 1950s. Beverly Dennis was cast in supporting roles in several Hollywood features, including such films as William A. Wellman‚Äôs classic 1951 proto-feminist western, Westward the Women, Jean Negulesco‚Äôs drama Take Care of my Little Girl (1951) and appeared regularly on the CBS (and later NBC) variety hour, The Red Buttons Show (1952 ‚Äì 1955). Russell Dennis gained minor roles in William Castle‚Äôs mystery drama, Hollywood Story (1951), and Mark Robson‚Äôs romantic war picture, Bright Victory (1951). Both Beverly and Russell fell victim to the McCarthy Era blacklisting and, in response to being ostracised from their work, soon sought out alternative careers in psychiatry and medicine, respectively.https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/13/obituaries/beverly- dennis-79-actress-who-became-psychotherapist-is-dead.html Beverly Dennis would become a successful therapist whilst retaining a keen interest in social advocacy, particularly for Second-Wave Feminism, in which she worked in furthering female empowerment with some of the most eminent names in theatre, literature, film, and journalism. Russell Dennis died suddenly on March 29, 1964, aged 48, not long after receiving his medical degree. Beverly later re- married to World War II veteran and advertising executive, Jerry Kramer. The family lived on New York‚Äôs Upper West Side, during which time young Amanda Kramer attended Manhattan‚Äôs noted progressive Little Red Schoolhouse (LREI). The family later relocated to Beverly Hills, California. Early life Whilst growing up in New York City of the 1960s and 1970s, Kramer expressed interest in music from a tender age and soon began to train in classical piano. Time and place would also dictate that the young music enthusiast would take inspiration from the emerging art and cultural movements of the times. Buoyed by the raw energy and spirit of punk whilst inspired by the dexterity and freedom of jazz, Kramer‚Äôs interests would be piqued by the emerging musical technologies of the 1980s, which would lead her to the beginning of a most versatile life in music. As a teenager, Kramer began her academic study of music at the Manhattan School of Music Preparatory Division, studying piano with Sonia Vargas. She would continue her studies at University of California at Santa Cruz and the San Francisco Conservatory of Music. Further, it was whilst studying Electronic Music and Video Production at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, Massachusetts, that Kramer would find fellow student, James Cassidy; this fortuitous meeting resulted in Cassidy inviting his talented and learned classmate to join his Minneapolis-based dance-pop group, Information Society (band). With Kramer rounding out the quartet, the group were primed for success. Music Career and Success Heralding her emergence as a musician of note, Information Society (band) released their self-titled major label debut on Tommy Boy/Warner Bros. Records, the resounding success of which certified the album gold. However, the dissolution of relations within the band led Kramer to return to New York City to further an eclectic career that has spanned genres and styles that includes Classical, Pop, Rock, and scoring for film/television. Kramer soon began collaborating with some of the most lauded acts around. First, she joined forces with Anton Fier as a core member of The Golden Palominos, recording several acclaimed albums, including A Dead Horse (1989) and Drunk with Passion (1991). As part of The Golden Palominos, Kramer would write and record with the likes of Michael Stipe, Bob Mould, Bill Laswell, and Richard Thompson, amongst others. Kramer then became a member of 10,000 Maniacs, recording and touring hit records including the platinum-selling releases, MTV Unplugged (1993) and Our Time in Eden (1993) before joining the eminent British group, World Party. Her first live performance as a member of the band would be a Pyramid Stage appearance at the 1994 Glastonbury Festival. In the succeeding years, Kramer would be engaged in much studio and road work, playing on albums by luminaries such as Lloyd Cole (The Negatives, 2000), The Church (Man Woman Life Death Infinity, 2018), and most recently The Psychedelic Furs' first studio record in three decades, Made of Rain. Kramer has been a member of the post-punk band since 2002 and with whom she has completed many international headlining tours. As a skilled and versatile live performer, she has provided further keyboard duties for television performances, tours, and festival appearances with a variety of artists including Eurythmics, Julee Cruise, David Hykes and the Harmonic Choir, Steve Kilbey, and Tom Bailey. From 2007 ‚Äì 2008 she toured with Siouxsie Sioux and recorded the Finale: The Last Mantaray & More Show live DVD. Solo career Kramer has released four solo albums, including Wintermass (with Blake Leyh, 1994), Samsara (1998), Fallen Light Renew (2004) and Under the Sea (2011). These albums represent Kramer‚Äôs diverse and extensive range of vocal and compositional talents, each incorporating the genres of World Music, Classical, Experimental, Jazz, and Ambient to create rich and distinctive body of work. The latter two albums were inspired by the poetry of William Blake and T.S. Eliot, respectively, and feature contributions from notable musicians including Karl Wallinger, Julee Cruise, amongst others.https://amandakramer.bandcamp.com/ Film and Television Composition In addition to her successful recording and touring career, Kramer has composed for film and television. Her work can be heard on the Discovery Channel series, Globe Trekker (later Pilot Guides), and has been featured on various television programmes including the PBS documentary Cayutaville (1998), ABC‚Äôs 20/20 (1997), and the feature film, True Crime (1996).https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1245054/ Education 2010: UCLA, California - course in Harmonic Principals in Tonal and Atonal Music. 2001 - 2002: University of Bristol, Bristol - Masters Diploma in Composition for Film, Television and Theater. 1998 - 2000: The New School University, New York City, New York, Bachelor of Arts degree; emphasis in Music. 1998 -1999: Morley College, London - Orchestral Conducting with Lawrence Leonard. 1996 -1997: Mannes School of Music, extension, New York - Mediaeval Notation; Orchestration. 1995: One year Indian Classical Music study with David Hykes, New York. 1989 -1991: The Juilliard School, extension, New York ‚Äì Music Theory and Analysis with Samuel Zyman. 1985 -1986: School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Massachusetts - Electronic Music and Video Production. 1983: San Francisco Conservatory of Music, California - Harpsichord with Laurette Goldberg. 1980 -1983: University of California at Santa Cruz, California - Music major; Piano with Lena-Liis Kiesel; Voice with Paul Hilliard; Harpsichord with Linda Burman-Hall. 1975 -1977: Manhattan School of Music Preparatory Division, New York; piano with Sonia Vargas.

Based on the sport of association football, the game tasks the player with controlling a football team. The game was released for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive console in December 1993 and ported to numerous other systems in 1994. The game was positively received on release; critics lauded the detail and animation of the footballers in the game, the crowd sound effects, and the overall presentation. The speed the game ran at and issues with the response to the player's input were seen as the game's primary faults. The 3DO version was an enhanced edition with multiple camera views and more detailed graphics than other versions, and was a high-profile showcase for the 3DO's power. The game sold well, served as a pack-in game for the Goldstar 3DO, and led to a sequel, FIFA Soccer 95. It was the first game in the FIFA series. Gameplay Example of FIFA International Soccer gameplay, showing the isometric viewpoint, the way the view moves to keep the ball on-screen and footballer animation. FIFA International Soccer is a video game that created one of the earliest full simulations of association football. In particular, the game is based on international matches. The game utilises an isometric viewpoint, unlike other football games at the time such as Sensible Soccer which utilised a birds-eye view or Kick Off which used a top-down view. The player controls one of the eleven footballers on their team at a time, with the ability to switch players on command. The game allows up to four human players at the same time, each controlling a different footballer. The players can choose to control a footballer on the same team or on opposing teams. The remaining footballers are controlled by the computer. Four modes of play ‚Äî Exhibition, Tournament, Playoffs, and League ‚Äî are available. Exhibition engages the player in a single match. Tournament mode resembles the format of the FIFA World Cup, UEFA European Championship, with the player controlling a team of their choice through a series of matches, starting with three group games with the possibility of progressing to four further games in a knockout format. Playoffs mode takes the same form, but skips the group games and starts at the first knockout game. League consists of eight teams who contest a double round-robin tournament. The game features 76 national teams in total Commentary from Tony Gubba (PC CD-ROM version), plus a team called EA All Stars. Every team has 20 players. The players are fictional (some of them, e.g. Tim Ansell of England or Joe Della-Savia of Italy, are named after people credited as the development team) and look the same, except for darker skin of certain teams' players. An oversight by the developers makes it easy to score a goal by making a player stand in front of the opponent's goalkeeper when he holds the ball in his hands and is about to clear it away. The computer- controlled goalkeeper will kick the ball into the opposing player, giving the latter an easy chance to score. Playable nations There are 76 national teams in the game:                           Development Electronic Arts (EA) had first ventured in the sports games market in 1988 with an American football title, John Madden Football. Updated versions of the game, along with golf and ice hockey games followed under the EASN (Electronic Arts Sports Network) banner. EA's European arm carried out research into the possibility of a sports game that would appeal to a European audience and decided that a football game would stand the best chance of success, predicting high sales figures. EA US gave the go-ahead for the project to proceed, and a team of ten developers at EA's Canadian studios began work on the project led by Bruce McMillan. Initially, the development took place for the Sega Genesis under the working title of EA Soccer, with a small budget of around $50,000-$100,000. Other EA Sports titles held official licences from the leagues depicted to allow real team names, players and stadiums to be included, and with a view to securing the same for their football title, EA signed a five-year deal with football's governing body, FIFA. The deal involved \\"minuscule\\" royalty payments, and on further inspection the reason became clear. The licence didn't include any team names, logos, player names, likenesses or stadiums. The game would therefore only include national teams identified by country names and flags, and player names would be made up - several of the developers added their own names into the game. The licence for the forthcoming 1994 FIFA World Cup tournament was held by US Gold and their game was due for a Spring 1994 release in time for the tournament which was to take place in Summer 1994. EA decided they would need to bring forward their game ahead of the US Gold title, and aimed for a Christmas 1993 release. Questioning the recognition that the FIFA licence held in North America, EA suggested the game be released as Team USA Soccer in North America. Fearing a sales flop, they reversed the decision and decided to release the game worldwide under the FIFA International Soccer title, providing the option of moving unsold stock to other markets. Development of the game was completed in November 1993. In June 1995, Atari Corporation struck a deal with EA to bring select titles from their catalog to the Atari Jaguar CD, with FIFA International Soccer being among them, however, this version was never released due to the commercial and critical failure of the Atari Jaguar platform. Reception =Sales= EA anticipated sales of around 300,000 copies of the game in Europe. In the first four weeks alone, over 500,000 sales were made, and despite its December release, became the best selling game of 1993. =Critical= FIFA International Soccer received mostly positive comments from the press. Reviewing the original Genesis/Mega Drive version, Edge magazine praised the way the crowd sounds reacted to the play on the field as well as the visual detail of the players and their animations with the isometric view. They highlighted that this did make for a slower game than one using a top-down view and described it a more of a simulator than a console game. Mean Machines Sega described the game as the \\"greatest soccer game yet seen\\", praising the \\"superlative presentation\\" and the \\"utterly amazing\\" animation. With only minor concerns around the response time to the players input and the lack of an on-screen clock graphic, they awarded a score of 96%. Computer Gaming World in June 1994 said \\"this is stunning. FIFA ... is a remarkably complete simulation of the sport\\". The magazine stated that \\"In no other game can you achieve such a high degree of pinpoint accuracy when passing\\", and praised players executing offensive or defensive stance depending on location. Next Generation reviewed the Super NES version of the game, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"FIFA International Soccer for the Super NES is a great game. With its extremely fast action, sharp graphics, and sensible gameplay, this title is a winner.\\" GamePro gave the SNES version a positive review, commenting that \\"Strong and varied game play makes this the most realistic soccer game for the SNES.\\" They also praised the graphics, animation, digitized crowd chants, and accessibility to players of all skill levels. They later commented that the Sega CD version is essentially identical to the Genesis and SNES versions aside from the addition of some full motion video clips, but that this is not a bad thing because the previous versions didn't leave any room for improvement. Next Generation reviewed the 3DO version, and noted that this port differed considerably from the original Genesis version and most other ports, with the addition of multiple views, a rotating-camera effect and more detailed graphics. They described it as the \\"killer-app graphics showhorse\\" for the 3DO console, awarding it a maximum five star score. GamePro similarly remarked \\"FIFA 3DO is no mere port-over from the cartridge market.\\" They especially praised the highly detailed graphics, multiple views, realistic gameplay, and six-player support. Reviewing the Amiga port, most publications spoke favourably of the game's appearance. Amiga Power, CU Amiga and The One magazines all highlighted the amount of disk swapping required to play the game as a drawback. Reaction to the changes in the controls required to adapt from the three buttons available on the Mega Drive controller to the single button common on most Amiga joysticks were mixed. Amiga Format said of hitting the button in an attempt to shoot at the goal, \\"occasionally the ball flies into the onion bag; other times it seems you are just passing the ball to the keeper.\\" Amiga Power described the outcome of pressing the button as random. The One however describes the control system as \\"excellent - to the point that it's easier to control\\" in comparison to the Mega Drive. In 1996, Next Generation listed the Genesis and 3DO versions as number 71 on their \\"Top 100 Games of All Time\\", saying it \\"put 3DO on the map after a year of disappointing titles for the system, and ... breathed life into EA's flagging sports line-up.\\" They cited the zooming camera angles and the ability to have up to six players on the 3DO version as highlights. Legacy A sequel, FIFA 95, was released in July 1994 exclusively for the Genesis. This started the FIFA series, with a new game released every year since in the main series, alongside spin-off series games based around a particular tournament. The series passed 100 million total sales in 2010, and EA's licence to use the FIFA title runs through to 2022.

He was born in Highbridge, Somerset, England. His father became a much revered Commissioner in the Army's ranks, and travelled extensively in the interests of the organisation. His mother died when he was 8 years of age. He became an officer in 1882 at the age of 17. Most of his earlier career was spent as an officer in the United States. During his time as an officer in the U.S., there was great divisions amongst the American Salvationists. He was known as the peace maker, thus earning him a lot of respect. In 1888, he married Captain Catherine Price. When Higgins was 42 years of age, Commissioner and Chief of the Staff Bramwell Booth gave him the oversight of the evangelistic work in the United Kingdom. By this time, Higgins was a great speaker, and had a lot of leadership skills which was needed in this role. The Siege of London was a 10-day effort that took place in November 1912. It was an attempt to bring a prayer service to the people out in the core of London. It was such a huge success that it was repeated in 1913. In 1919, General Bramwell Booth appointed him as his Chief of the Staff. Higgins was never one to lead a political agenda, but he took his new role in stride. However, 1929 was a real test for Higgins and a critical time in the history of The Salvation Army, the calling of the first High Council to elect a new General. General Bramwell Booth was asked to resign because of his ill health over the past several months. He refused, however, and was then reluctantly deposed from office, to be succeeded in the election of Higgins. As General Booth sued, the matter was put in the hands of the court. The court ruled in favour of the High Council. Thus, Higgins was the first General to be elected by the High Council. As leader of the International Salvation Army, General Higgins still had his personal touch and warmth towards others. During his term in office as the General, he allowed a centenary of William Booth's birth to be celebrated. He also presided over a gathering in the Royal Albert Hall, and among those taking part was then Prime Minister, The Rt Hon. Stanley Baldwin. When he retired, his farewell meeting was held at the Royal Albert Hall on 1 November 1934, presided over by the then Duke of York (later George VI), who was accompanied by the Duchess (later Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.) The General and his wife then went to live in Florida, and later moved to Canada. The General and his wife had 7 children. He continued to prove himself a true \\"son of the Army\\" by maintaining as much interest in the relatively small corps around them as he had done in the greater issues when in office. Mrs General Catherine Higgins died in 1952. Higgins wrote a number of books, including Stewards of God and Personal Holiness. General Edward Higgins died at age 83.

Released in 1987, it is the fourth game in the Monty Mole series. It was written by Peter Harrap and Shaun Hollingworth with music by Rob Hubbard and Ben Daglish. Gameplay The player controls Monty as he travels around Europe collecting money in order to buy a Greek island - Montos, where he can safely retire. Gameplay is in the style of a flick-screen platform game, similar to many such games of the 1980s such as Technician Ted and Jet Set Willy. Some screens (such as those representing the Eiffel Tower and the Pyrenees) bear some relation to their real-life counterparts but most are just typical platform game screens. Auf Wiedersehen Monty contains many interesting features and peculiarities for the player to discover. Examples include being suddenly attacked by a bull's head in Spain after collecting a red cape (presumably a reference to bullfighting), a car being dropped in one of two places on entering a screen representing D√ºsseldorf in West Germany, a chef's hat found in Sweden (a reference to the Swedish Chef of Muppets fame; also, the two rooms representing Sweden are subtitled Bjorn and Borg), and a record in Luxembourg that when collected makes Monty breakdance to the game's title music (this may be a reference to Radio Luxembourg). It is possible to get to areas of the game more quickly by flying from an airport using air tickets which can be collected throughout the game. Some parts of the game can only be reached in this manner. As well as money, there are other miscellaneous objects to collect in the game for points. This was important as you need a certain number of points to get to Montos. These are often particular to the country Monty is visiting (such as berets in France). Bottles of wine or a glass of beer in West Germany cause Monty to briefly become drunk and his control to become slightly erratic leading to a reversal of controls, repeated jumping or Monty climbing any ladders or drainpipes he encounters. Trivia *The games screens are laid out geographically, the complete map of the game corresponds with a map of Europe. *The money that Monty collects are labeled \\"EC\\", the European Currency Unit, one decade before the euro was introduced *The title was inspired by the then-popular television series, Auf Wiedersehen, Pet *The game won the award for best platform game of the year according to the readers of Crash magazine.http://www.crashonline.org.uk/51/awards.htm *The game was voted number 57 in the Your Sinclair Readers' Top 100 Games of All Time. Sequels Moley Christmas was released later in the same year. A further Monty Mole game, called Impossamole was released in 1990. It took a different form to the previous games being more of a \\"console-style\\" arcade game.

It was released for the PC on June 24, 1996 and versions for PlayStation, SNES, Mega Drive and Sega Saturn followed. FIFA 97 is the fourth game in the FIFA series and the second to use the Virtual Stadium engine. Unlike the first game to use the engine, FIFA 97 features polygonal players as opposed to the 2D sprites used in FIFA Soccer '96. The engine however received complaints for being sluggish in the PC and PlayStation versions. David Ginola (then a Newcastle United player) was pictured on the cover of the game in the European market. He also was used for motion capture for the polygonal models in the game. Bebeto (the Brazilian striker) was featured on the cover for the Americas and Asia-Pacific markets. Game features The main new feature of the game other than the motion capture was the indoor football mode. There are six ways to play the game, including outdoor and indoor, as well as action and simulation modes. 32-bit AI is used, as well as motion blending technology. It is possible to play six-a-side football in an indoor arena with the ball bouncing off the walls meaning there are no throw-ins and therefore a much higher paced game. Leagues available in the game include the English, French, Italian, German, Dutch, Scottish leagues and the Malaysian M-league and other sides, as well as the American A-League clubs with fictional teams, composed of the game's creators such as Bruce McMillan and Penny Lee. Commentary is provided by John Motson and Andy Gray while the presenter is Des Lynam. Multiplayer games are also possible with up to 20-players via LAN and 8-players using modem. The game trailer's tagline was \\"FIFA 97, it will blow you away.\\" Most European domestic leagues are featured in the game, including the English Premier League, but only teams from each nation's highest division are playable. The English clubs featured in the game are those who played in the 1995-96 Premier League. It is also possible to field custom teams made up of players from various real teams. However, these teams can only be played with in friendly matches. Screenshot of FIFA '97, Sega Genesis version.  Commentary  The game's commentary included the names of the majority of players on the game, and the names of the teams were also said by John Motson. To keep the commentary from sounding too robotic, EA Sports recorded Motson saying each phrase four different times, each time in a different tone. Several errors plagued the game's commentary, such as John Millar of Heart of Midlothian being referred to as Joe Miller, who in fact plays for Aberdeen on the game. Also, at times when a goal kick was awarded, the commentator would say that the kick had been given to the opposing team. Another similar error was that a kick-off would be referred to as a cross, as well as a goal in the first minute being described as a goal \\"that would win it surely\\". On rare occasions, when the game was being introduced by Des Lynam, the name of a player involved in the game would be said by John Motson, instead of Lynam saying the names of both teams. For example, a match between Partick Thistle F.C. and Kilmarnock F.C. would sometimes be introduced by Lynam saying \\"Welcome to the big match between-\\", and Motson's voice interjecting with \\"MacPherson.\\" The pronunciation of certain players' names would change depending upon whether they were performing attacking or defensive duties, such as Roy Aitken being referred to as \\"Akin\\" if he made a tackle or clearance. Similarly, Alessandro Del Piero, who was called \\"Del Piero Togon\\" on the game, was referred to as \\"Del Piero Tognon\\", followed by a small hiccuping noise when he performed a tackle. Reception FIFA 97s computer version received a \\"Gold\\" sales award from the Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland (VUD), indicating sales of at least 100,000 units across Germany, Austria and Switzerland. The PlayStation version received a wide range of reviews. GamePro gave it a rave review, particularly applauding the motion captured animations, crowd noises, and \\"detailed, side- busting commentary\\". GameSpot's Stephen Poole disagreed on the commentary, noting that it is on occasion blatantly inaccurate. However, he opined that the slower pace of the gameplay is more realistic. Additionally praising the new indoor soccer feature, motion capture animation, and sharply rendered players, he concluded the game \\"does not disappoint.\\" A reviewer for Next Generation, however, insisted that \\"The simple, sad fact is FIFA '97 is the most disappointing EA Sports game in years.\\" He argued that the slow pace, rather than being realistic, is simply boring. He acknowledged that the visuals are good and the features are comprehensive, but found the slow pace, frame rate, control, and unrealistic ball physics make FIFA '97 a poor offering. The two sports reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly took a middle ground, complimenting the graphics, stats, and realism, but agreeing with Next Generation that the play suffers from the slow pace and controls. They rated it overall decent, but not a contender against the leading soccer games. Both Play Magazine in Issue 15 and Official UK PlayStation Magazine in Issue 15 rated the PlayStation version of the game similarly with a score of 70% and 7/10 respectively. Play when comparing it with FIFA 96 commented that it was \\"Graphically better, but plays worse\\". Reviews for the Saturn port were more uniformly middling. Critics often compared it unfavorably to Sega Worldwide Soccer 97. GamePro also noted that the graphics and audio are inferior to those of the PlayStation version. Saturn Power mentioned numerous aggravations with the controls and configurations, and summarized it as \\"Almost perversely entertaining for a game as flawed as it is.\\" Sega Saturn Magazines Rich Leadbetter found the AI too heavily flawed to provide an accurate simulation of soccer. Like Price, he deemed the game enjoyable despite its flaws, but concluded Sega Worldwide Soccer '97 to be indisputably a wiser purchase. The Genesis and Super NES versions were reviewed in GamePro by two different critics. Both concluded that the game is a must-have for newcomers to the series, but that FIFA fans would likely find the game redundant due to the minimal change from previous installments. GamePro also ran a brief review of the Game Boy version, praising it for managing easy-to-follow graphics despite the small screen. They added, \\"The gameplay isn't exactly speedy - the sprites lope downfield at a sluggish pace - but it's fun working your way through a lengthy tournament to the championship.

The district, like many frontier town red-light districts, got its name from its proximity to wharves in the city. The Levee district encompassed four blocks in Chicago's South Loop area, between 18th and 22nd streets. It was home to many brothels, saloons, dance halls, and the famed Everleigh Club. Prostitution boomed in the Levee District, and it was not until the Chicago Vice Commission submitted a report on the city's vice districts that it was shut down. History The Chicago nightlife district was initially located downtown in the First District. However, after the Great Fire of Chicago in 1871, it moved to the south of the city. Before 1890, the area known as Customs House Levee became a gathering place for players and pimps, and was one of the most notorious criminal districts in Chicago. According to one newspaper, Chicago was at that time considered \\"the most violent, dirtiest cities ‚Äì loud, lawless, ugly, offensive, godless; an oversized, stupid village.\\" In cooperation with the Chicago Outfit, corrupt city councilors \\"Hinky Dink\\" Michael Kenna and \\"Bathhouse\\" John Coughlin, precipitated the rapid rise of vice in the district. From 1893 the pair organized a protection racket in which game parlors and brothels in The Levee had to pay protection money. Kenna and Coughlin formed a group of corrupt city councilors called \\"Gray Wolves\\", which was active from 1890 to 1930. The Levee District was home to many brothels, saloons, dance halls, and similar places. Chicago's first brothels were built on Wells Street. Among the most famous establishments were: * The House of All Nations (between Archer Street and Cullerton Street), where, similar to the Parisian establishment of the same name, girls from different countries of the world could be found * The Little Green House on Bed Bug Row * The Bucket of Blood, an infamous saloon on the southwest corner of 19th Street and Federal. This bar was mentioned in a newspaper in 1916 for serving still liquor after the curfew. The name most likely comes from the fact that in the morning, after numerous brawls and stabbings, blood had to be cleaned from the floor. * Ed Weiss's Capitol, a dance hall owned by Ed Weiss whose brother Louis also owned the brothel The Sapphos * Freiberg's Dance Hall, a brothel between 22nd Street, Wabash Street and State Street. The restaurant offered a bar, dance floor and contact with prostitutes. According to the Chicago Vice Commission, the dance hall was one of the most infamous venues in Chicago, after it was learned that women were often kidnapped and forced into prostitution from there. Kenna and Coughlin resided at Freiberg's Dance Hall. It closed on August 24, 1914. * Everleigh Club, led by Ada and Minna Everleigh on Dearborn Avenue, was regularly frequented by the society's elite. The prostitutes, who called themselves \\"butterflies\\", earned $100 to $400 a week in the brothel, which were phenomenal sums for the time given the prevailing daily wages elsewhere. From this club came the contemporary phrase \\"I'm going to get Everleighed\\", which most likely later became the colloquialism \\"get laid\\". The lowest level of the brothels formed the simple houses in the Bed Bug Row, spanning from Dearborn Avenue and Federal to 19th Street and Arche). The women of color who worked there offered $0.25 services, often under poor hygienic conditions. The Bed Bug Row had a similar bad reputation to the \\"Cribs\\" in New Orleans or the \\"cowyards\\" in San Francisco. In order to receive protection, Levee inhabitants would attend the biggest event in the district, the annual First Ward Ball. There, Levee residents gathered to celebrate the triumphs brought to them by \\"Hinky Dink\\" Kenna and \\"Bathhouse\\" Coughlin. Madams, corrupt businessmen, dance-hall owners, saloon owners, prostitutes, brothel owners, and gamblers attended the event to support these aldermen. The money raised came from the purchase of tickets to the event and of alcohol. When anti-vice reformers protested the ball, Kenna justified it as benefiting the people in the district through educational and community programs. The First Ward Ball of 1908 was the most significant because it was the last one to be attended by the Levee's most prominent figures. That year, anti-vice reformers tried to stop the ball by bombing its venue, The Coliseum. The ball was uninterrupted, however, in 1909, anti-vice reformers worked towards getting the city to revoke the event's alcohol license. They succeeded, and only about 3,000 people attended, less than a quarter of the attendance at the previous balls. That year, reformers like the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) worked towards stopping events like these, claiming that they harmed the families in the Levee. Anti-Vice Reformers Anti-\\"white slavery\\" parade through Chicago's Levee district on October 18, 1909, led by British evangelist Gypsy Smith. A member of the anti-vice Midnight Mission (left), and Levee district prostitutes walking the street (c.1911). Devout Christian communities protested at the beginning of the 20th century against prostitution and gambling in the Levee. At its peak, up to 5,000 prostitutes worked in the local brothels. Increasingly, the public became aware of \\"white slavery\\" cases in which girls from rural areas fell into the hands of pimps and were systematically forced into prostitution. An especially sensational case was that of Madame Mary Hastings, who inflicted torture and forced prostitution on minor girls in her brothel Custom House Place on Jackson Street. The Levee District's success in vice came to an end when reformers such as the WCTU and Chicago Vice Commission (CVC) (established by Carter Harrison, Jr.) publicly exposed the issues of white slavery and alcohol abuse. The WCTU had a \\"department of rescue\\" to save women forced into slavery. They also had a \\"department of social purity\\", which upheld sexual consent laws. The WCTU paid investigators to conduct studies on forced prostitution in Midwest lumber camps. This in turn helped them publish a journal on the stories of women working as prostitutes in Chicago (Levee District), San Francisco, and New York. The CVC focused on terminating vice districts, and on investigating the conditions for women in the Levee. The members spoke to prostitutes, police, and neighborhood organizations. They published a report, The Social Evil in Chicago, which included prostitution statistics and recommendations for improvement. The report concluded that about 5,000 professional prostitutes worked in Chicago, and about five million men were receiving services from them, for which the women received about $25 weekly. They were mostly uneducated and unskilled, and they had little to no opportunities for economic advancement. The report was read around the world and influenced vice commissions in 43 cities to close their own vice districts. Closure of The Levee The difficult process to close down the entire Levee District began on January 9, 1910, when Nathaniel Ford Moore died in Victoria \\"Vic\\" Shaw's brothel. She wanted to frame Minna Everleigh for the death, but Everleigh found out about Moore before Shaw got the chance. Shaw was forced to call the police to report the death after which her brothel was closed. A year later, on October 3, 1911, the state's attorney issued warrants for 135 people associated with the Levee, including Big Jim Colosimo, Ed Weiss, Roy Jones and Vic Shaw. The warrants shut down halls, saloons and brothels. Many people were arrested within the brothels; in Marie Blanchey's brothel, 20 women and 30 men were arrested. Word spread about corruption in the government, and on October 24, 1911, Mayor Carter Harrison ordered the closure of the Everleigh Club. It was shut down the following day. Many businesses in the Levee District closed in 1911, but the district held on for two more years. One of the last brothels to close was Freiberg's Dance Hall, which celebrated its last night on August 24, 1914. Timeline James \\"Big Jim\\" Colosimo * Mid-19th Century ‚Äì Chicago has more arcades than New Orleans and Pittsburgh combined. The metropolis, whose brothels and arcades are larger and more revealing than elsewhere, was once considered the \\"craziest city in the US\\". * 1871 ‚Äì The Great Chicago Fire.

From there, the girls descend to working at hour hotels and then street prostitution. Colosimo and Van Beven lead a \\"White Slave Ring\\", where their victims are often young girls from rural areas, lured to Chicago by the promise of marriage. They were then raped (\\"broken in\\") by the cadets. The girls suffered a martyrdom of drug abuse, beatings and rape. Only a few manage to free themselves from it. Many die prematurely from alcohol and drug abuse, as well as venereal diseases. Van Beven's and Colosimo's system gives the cadets a continuous supply of \\"fresh meat\\". Colosimo and Van Beven stretch their thriving businesses nationwide to New York, St. Louis and Milwaukee. * 1905 ‚Äì Colosimo opens his first saloons and single-hour hotels. 1906 Blanchard's map of Chicago * October 18, 1909 ‚Äì Rodney \\"Gipsy\\" Smith leads a march of 200 Christians through the Levee District. * January 9, 1910 ‚Äì Nathaniel Ford Moore (born January 31, 1884), a well-known American golfer and son of the President of the Rock Island Railway Company, dies in the brothel of Vic Shaw of a narcotic overdose.

Notable persons associated with the Levee District  Caricature of \\"Lords of the Levee\\" ‚Äì \\"Bathhouse John\\" Coughlin and \\"Hinky Dink\\" Kenna *Michael \\"Hinky Dink\\" Kenna was the alderman of the First Ward who owned a saloon on Clark street called the Workingman's Exchange. Here he would bribe people to vote for him by offering a free lunch and mug of beer for a nickel. *\\"Bathhouse\\" John Coughlin ran the First Ward with Hinky Dink and owned a tavern on West Madison named, \\"Silver Dollar Saloon.\\" Many people called him \\"Bathhouse\\" John. The Everleigh Club at 2131‚Äì2133 South Dearborn Street. *Ada Everleigh was the owner and madam of the Everleigh Club with her younger sister Minna. Ada played the role as the executive who balanced the books. She also made it her priority to keep the club clean and spent half of her time wiping the mirrors, straightening oil paintings, and checking the Gold Piano for marks (the Gold Room was her favorite room). The Everleigh Club was the best brothel in the Levee and girls considered it to be a superior position to get picked into staying there. *Minna Everleigh was the owner and madam of the Everleigh Club with her sister Ada Everleigh. She was the mingler, the one who did all the talking for the club. She was almost framed for the murder of two different men, Marshall Field Jr. first and Nathaniel Ford Moore five years later by Vic Shaw, who also convinced Pony Moore (who had no relation to Nathaniel) to go in on it the first time by bribing him $40,000. *Ike Bloom. His real name was Isaac Gitelson and he made arrangements for protection payments with the police for the Levee District. He also operated a dance hall, the Freidberg, which he said was a dance academy to keep reformers from finding out the truth. This dance hall had a bar in the front with a long dance room in the back and an orchestra on the balcony. His rules for the girls in his hall were: she must report in by nine p.m. every night, persuade men to spend at least 40 cents every time they bought a round, and to lure guys to the Marlborough Hotel. *Jim Colosimo, aka \\"Big Jim\\", ran a white slavery ring where he had girls depend on him for praise and protection. Girls would be lured to Chicago by being promised good jobs and nice homes, only to be sold to other brothel owners. He loved diamonds and was always playing with them in his hands; he would buy them from thieves or win them by gambling. In 1920 he was shot in his caf√© and died. *Victoria Colosimo was married to Jim Colosimo and helped him run pool halls and saloons. She operated two of the dives, the Victoria and the Saratoga. Brothel \\"The Paris\\", 2101 Armor Street. The establishment was run by Maurice Van Bever, who was accused of \\"white slavery\\" *Maurice Van Bever, Big Jim's partner; operated two saloons called the Paris and the White City. The trafficking (\\"interstate ring\\" between several states), which he operated together with his wife Julia, confirmed by statements of the minor Loretta Campbell, who was abducted from St. Louis and was picked up in a raid in the \\"White City\\". Van Bever drove hundreds of prostitutes into the homes of Colosimos and was arrested in 1909. *Ed Weiss, brothel owner next to the Everleigh Club who would pay off the Levee cabdrivers to drive drunken men to his door instead of the Everleigh Club. *Vic Shaw, born Emma Elizabeth Fitzgerald. A madam to a house on South Dearborn Street who hated and felt threatened by the Everleigh sisters. Her girls were not treated very well. They were harshly disciplined and not always given proper examinations by doctors. *Pony Moore was the owner of two levee dives called the Turf Exchange Saloon and the Hotel De Moore resort. *John \\"Mushmouth\\" Johnson was the first African American vice lord who opened a saloon and gambling house on State Street.

She was one of the first women to systematically operate \\"White Slavery\\" in around 1890. Using bribes, (about $2.00 per week to the local patrol) or services of the girls to officials, she escaped police investigation for many years. Her houses were considered the worst brothels in the city, in which any kind of perverted wishes were fulfilled. She was credited with saying, \\"If a girl was good enough to be accepted at ordinary brothel, then she was too good for her own\\". From about 1893, she attracted young girls from rural areas of the Midwest of 13 to 17 years of age on the pretext of earning good money in Chicago. In one of her notorious houses, they took their clothes off and were abused by six \\"professional\\" rapists. This was the process called in the jargon of the trade, \\"The Life\\", which included a continuing ordeal of abuse, rape, and inhumane treatment. Following the \\"breaking-in\\", the victims were either smuggled into homes (including Customs House Place on Jackson Street) or resold to other brothel operators for approximately $50 to $300, depending on their age and appeal. The inhumane working hours usually went from noon to five in the morning. During this time the girls often consumed schnapps and absinthe to get through. British journalist William Stead once visited one of Hastings brothels and described the conditions in his socially critical article \\"If Christ came to Chicago.\\" Legend has it that some of the girls managed to smuggle out a note reading \\"I am being held as a slave\\" to alert the police to this crime. In 1895, after nine girls escaped from the brothel under daring conditions, the criminal machinations of Mary Hastings were blown open. The police were forced to act and Hastings fled to Toronto, Canada, never returning to Chicago. In Canada, she operated under the name Madame Gain. Prostitution in Chicago after the Levee District Although the Levee District had closed down in 1912, prostitution continued to be a problem in Chicago. The closing of the Levee had initiated changes throughout the city's sexual commerce. There were no brothels, but that didn't stop many men and women. They moved from brothels and saloons to cabarets, nightclubs and other nighttime scenes. Solicitation was still available, and the sex entrepreneurs were still willing to pay law enforcement to keep quiet. The election of Chicago Mayor William \\"Big Bill\\" Hale Thompson in 1915 reactivated the illegal business in the Levee. Many of the brothels were reopened as hotels, saloons or cabarets. \\"Big Jim\\" Colosimo and his wife Victoria Moresco took over three brothels and control of the district. His Colosimo's Caf√©, frequented by famous guests such as Enrico Caruso, became the center of high society in Chicago. Due to his Italian origins, Colosimo became the target of Sicilian blackmail bands like the Black Hand Gang (La Mano Nera), which increasingly threatened him. For fear of kidnapping, he sought shelter with his co-relatives Johnny Torrio in New York City. Torrio, a cousin of Victoria Moresco, sent Al Capone to reorganize the situation there. Capone began his career in the restaurant in this district The Four Deuces (2222 South Wabash). The four-storey brick building, which also housed an office and a brothel upstairs, was initially owned by Jonny Torrio. It is believed that he tortured his rivals in the basement of the \\"Four Deuces\\". In the beginning of the 1920s, vice syndicates of the time moved to the suburbs where law enforcement was easier to persuade. Although laws were established to control or eliminate prostitution, they were not backed up by the court system. \\"In many cases, the defendant did not appear in trial in which case the charges were dropped and the bond seized.\\" It was shown that even when they were sentenced, none of the prostitutes were sentenced correctly. Only 15 of the 320 cases were found guilty in a group of cases they had selected. In the final decades of the 20th century, establishments similar to brothels reentered the city. New businesses like peepshows, massage parlors, and bars featuring live showgirls opened. In the 1980s, however, most were shut down and turned into condominiums, restaurants, and high-end retail stores.

Written primarily by John Lennon and credited to Lennon‚ÄìMcCartney, it is the second song of the album's climactic medley. Like other tracks on the album (notably \\"Because\\") the song features lush multi- tracked vocal harmonies, provided by Lennon, Paul McCartney and George Harrison. Background The working title was \\"Here Comes the Sun King\\", but was shortened to \\"Sun King\\" to avoid confusion with Harrison's \\"Here Comes the Sun\\". The song slowly fades in from the harbour sounds at the end of \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\". At the end of the song, the music stops abruptly and a drum fill by Ringo Starr leads into the next track, \\"Mean Mr. Mustard\\". A faux mixing of Romance languages occurs in the last three lines of the song. In 1969, Lennon was interviewed about these lyrics and said, \\"We just started joking, you know, singing 'cuando para mucho.' So we just made up... Paul knew a few Spanish words from school, you know. So we just strung any Spanish words that sounded vaguely like something. And of course we got 'chicka ferdy' in. That's a Liverpool expression. Just like sort ‚Äì it doesn't mean anything to me but (childish taunting) 'na-na, na-na-na!'\\" In an interview in 1987, Harrison said that the recording was inspired by Fleetwood Mac's \\"Albatross\\". \\"At the time, 'Albatross' (by Fleetwood Mac) was out, with all the reverb on guitar. So we said, 'Let's be Fleetwood Mac doing Albatross, just to get going.' It never really sounded like Fleetwood Mac... but that was the point of origin.\\" Musical structure The song is in the key of C and the chorus (\\"Here comes the Sun King\\") involves a I (C)‚ÄìImaj7 (Cmaj7 chord)‚Äìv7 (Gm7 chord)‚ÄìVI7 (A7 chord) progression against a C‚ÄìB‚ÄìB‚ÄìA vocal harmony.Pedler, Dominic. The Songwriting Secrets of the Beatles. Music Sales Limited. Omnibus Press, New York, 2003. An interesting feature (according to Pedler) is the substitution of the Gm7 chord for the C7 dominant chord at the word \\"Sun\\". This represents an example of the jazz rule that allows a dominant (V) seventh chord (here C7) to be replaced by a minor chord a fifth above (here Gm7). The synchronous B vocal harmonises with the 3 (B note) of the Gm7 chord. The coda beginning \\"Cuando para mucho\\", which is an exact copy of the instrumental intro, is initially sung to a ii (Fm7 chord), which moves to V‚ÄìI (B6 to E6 chords) on \\"cora-zon\\", then alternates back to ii (Fm7) on \\"Mundo paparazzi\\" and \\"Cuesto obrigato\\" before again V‚ÄìI (B6‚ÄìE6) on \\"para-sol\\" and \\"carou-sel\\". The song is also notable for the vocally constructed ii-on-V 'slash' polychord (Dm7/G; also written G11) arising in the \\"Ahh\\" transition to verse (\\"Here comes...\\" and I (C) chord) while the bass makes the standard V (G note)‚ÄìI (C note) move. The frequent use of added sixth chords in the song accentuate its dreamlike feel. The song also has an example of major 9th harmony in the Cmaj9 chord on \\"Here the Sun King\\"; here, above the tonic C major triad, both B (seventh) and D (ninth) combine in the vocals \\"to form a suitably lush fanfare for the monarch himself.\\" \\"Gnik Nus\\" A portion of the vocals was included as a reversed a cappella in the track titled \\"Gnik Nus\\" for the 2006 album Love. An instrumental section of \\"Sun King\\" was also used at the end of the track \\"Octopus's Garden\\" on the compilation.

The two periods of outstanding achievement were the 7th and 8th centuries, with the metalwork and jewellery from Sutton Hoo and a series of magnificent illuminated manuscripts, and the final period after about 950, when there was a revival of English culture after the end of the Viking invasions. By the time of the Conquest the move to the Romanesque style is nearly complete. The important artistic centres, in so far as these can be established, were concentrated in the extremities of England, in Northumbria, especially in the early period, and Wessex and Kent near the south coast. Anglo-Saxon art survives mostly in illuminated manuscripts, Anglo-Saxon architecture, a number of very fine ivory carvings, and some works in metal and other materials. Opus Anglicanum (\\"English work\\") was already recognised as the finest embroidery in Europe, although only a few pieces from the Anglo- Saxon period remain ‚Äì the Bayeux Tapestry is a rather different sort of embroidery, on a far larger scale. As in most of Europe at the time, metalwork was the most highly regarded form of art by the Anglo-Saxons, but hardly any survives ‚Äì there was enormous plundering of Anglo-Saxon churches, monasteries and the possessions of the dispossessed nobility by the new Norman rulers in their first decades, as well as the Norsemen before them, and the English Reformation after them, and most survivals were once on the continent.Dodwell (1982)'s Chapter 1 gives a detailed analysis of the various causes of destruction of works of art, especially metalwork Anglo-Saxon taste favoured brightness and colour, and an effort of the imagination is often needed to see the excavated and worn remains that survive as they once were.Wilson, 10‚Äì11; Dodwell (1982), chapter 2 Perhaps the best known piece of Anglo-Saxon art is the Bayeux Tapestry which was commissioned by a Norman patron from English artists working in the traditional Anglo-Saxon style. Anglo-Saxon artists also worked in fresco, stone, ivory and whalebone (notably the Franks Casket), metalwork (for example the Fuller brooch), glass and enamel, many examples of which have been recovered through archaeological excavation and some of which have simply been preserved over the centuries, especially in churches on the Continent, as the Vikings, Normans and Reformation iconoclasm between them left virtually nothing in England except for books and archaeological finds. Overview Bird from the Sutton Hoo shield (part replica) Metalwork is almost the only form in which the earliest Anglo-Saxon art has survived, mostly in Germanic-style jewelry (including fittings for clothes and weapons) which was, before the Christianization of Anglo-Saxon England, commonly placed in burials.Dodwell (1982), 3‚Äì4 After the conversion, which took most of the 7th century, the fusion of Germanic Anglo-Saxon, Celtic and Late Antique techniques and motifs, together with the requirement for books, created Hiberno-Saxon style, or Insular art, which is also seen in illuminated manuscripts and some carved stone and ivory, probably mostly drawing from decorative metalwork motifs, and with further influences from the British Celts of the west and the Franks. The Kingdom of Northumbria in the far north of England was the crucible of Insular style in Britain, at centres such as Lindisfarne, founded c. 635 as an offshoot of the Irish monastery on Iona, and Monkwearmouth-Jarrow Abbey (674) which looked to the continent. At about the same time as the Insular Lindisfarne Gospels was being made in the early 8th century, the Vespasian Psalter from Canterbury in the far south, which the missionaries from Rome had made their headquarters, shows a wholly different, classically based art. These two styles mixed and developed together and by the following century the resulting Anglo-Saxon style had reached maturity. However Anglo-Saxon society was massively disrupted in the 9th century, especially the later half, by the Viking invasions, and the number of significant objects surviving falls considerably, and their dating becomes even vaguer than of those from a century before. Most monasteries in the north were closed for decades, if not forever, and after the Canterbury Bible of before 850, perhaps well before, \\"no major illuminated manuscript is known until well on into the tenth century\\".Wilson, 142 (quote), 60 King Alfred (r. 871‚Äì899) held the Vikings back to a line running diagonally across the middle of England, above which they settled in the Danelaw, and were gradually integrated into what was now a unified Anglo-Saxon kingdom. The final phase of Anglo-Saxon art is known as the Winchester School or style, though it was produced in many centres in the south of England, and perhaps the Midlands also. Elements of this begin to be seen from around 900, but the first major manuscripts only appear around the 930s. The style combined influences from the continental art of the Holy Roman Empire with elements of older English art, and some particular elements including a nervous agitated style of drapery, sometimes matched by figures, especially in line drawings, which are the only images in many manuscripts, and were to remain especially prominent in medieval English art. Illuminated manuscripts The evangelist portrait and Incipit to Matthew from the Stockholm Codex Aureus, one of the \\"Tiberius group\\", show the Northumbrian Insular and classicising continental styles that combined and competed in early Anglo-Saxon manuscripts. Early Anglo-Saxon manuscript illumination forms part of Insular art, a combination of influences from Mediterranean, Celtic and Germanic styles that arose when the Anglo- Saxons encountered Irish missionary activity in Northumbria, at Lindisfarne and Iona in particular. At the same time the Gregorian mission from Rome and its successors imported continental manuscripts like the Italian St. Augustine Gospels, and for a considerable period the two styles appear mixed in a variety of proportions in Anglo-Saxon manuscripts. In the Lindisfarne Gospels, of around 700‚Äì715, there are carpet pages and Insular initials of unprecedented complexity and sophistication, but the evangelist portraits, clearly following Italian models, greatly simplify them, misunderstand some details of the setting, and give them a border with interlace corners. The portrait of St Matthew is based on the same Italian model, or one extremely similar, used for the figure of Ezra that is one of the two large miniatures in the Codex Amiatinus (before 716), but the style there is very different; a far more illusionistic treatment, and an \\"attempt to introduce a pure Mediterranean style into Anglo-Saxon England\\", which failed, as \\"perhaps too advanced\\", leaving these images apparently as the only evidence.Wilson, 40, 49 (quote) A different mixture is seen in the opening from the Stockholm Codex Aureus (mid-8th century, left) where the evangelist portrait to the left is in a consistent adaptation of Italian style, probably closely following some lost model, though adding interlace to the chair frame, while the text page to the right is mainly in Insular style, especially in the first line, with its vigorous Celtic spirals and interlace. The following lines revert to a quieter style more typical of Frankish manuscripts of the period. Yet the same artist almost certainly produced both pages, and is very confident in both styles; the evangelist portrait of John includes roundels with Celtic spiral decoration probably drawn from the enamelled escutcheons of hanging bowls.Nordenfalk, 96‚Äì107, Wilson 94 This is one of the so-called \\"Tiberius group\\" of manuscripts, which leant towards the Italian style, and appear to be associated with Kent, or perhaps the kingdom of Mercia in the heyday of the Mercian Supremacy. It is, in the usual chronology, the last English manuscript in which \\"developed trumpet spiral patterns\\" are found.Wilson, 94 Evangelist portrait from the Grimbald Gospels, early 11th century, in the late Winchester style. The 9th century, especially the latter half, has very few major survivals made in England, but was a period when Insular and Anglo-Saxon influence on Carolingian manuscripts was at its height, from scriptoria such as those at the Anglo-Saxon mission's foundation at Echternach Abbey (though the important Echternach Gospels were created in Northumbria), and the major monastery at Tours, where Alcuin of York was followed by another Anglo-Saxon abbot, between them covering the period from 796 to 834. Although Tours' own library was destroyed by Norsemen, over 60 9th century illuminated manuscripts from the scriptorium survive, in a style showing many borrowings from English models, especially in initial pages, where Insular influence remained visible in northern France until even the 12th century. The Anglo-Saxon metalwork produced in the Salzburg area of modern Austria has a manuscript counterpart in the \\"Cutbercht Gospels\\" in Vienna.Wilson, 131‚Äì133; Henderson, 63‚Äì71 By the 10th century Insular elements were relegated to decorative embellishments in England, as the first phase of the \\"Winchester style\\" developed.Dodwell (1993), 90 The first plant ornament, with leaves and grapes, was already seen in an initial in the Leningrad Bede, which can probably be dated to 746. The other large initial in the manuscript is the first historiated initial (one containing a portrait or scene, here Christ or a saint) in the whole of Europe.Wilson, 63 The classically derived vine or plant scroll was to largely oust interlace as the dominant filler of ornamental spaces in Anglo-Saxon art, just as it did in much of Europe beginning with Carolingian art, though in England animals within the scrolls remained much more common than abroad.Wilson, 63‚Äì67 For some long time scrolls, especially in metal, bone or ivory, are prone to have an animal head at one end and a plant element at the other.Seen by Wilson, 64‚Äì67, as \\"degeneration\\", this might also be seen as a return to the habits of La T√®ne style. All these changes were not restricted to manuscripts, and may not have been driven by manuscript style, but we have a greater number of manuscripts surviving than works in other media, even if in most cases illuminations are restricted to initials and perhaps a few miniatures. Several ambitious projects of illumination are unfinished, such as the Old English Hexateuch, which has some 550 scenes in various stages of completion, giving insight into working methods. The illustrations give Old Testament scenes an entirely contemporary setting and are valuable images of Anglo-Saxon life.Dodwell (1993), 118‚Äì120 Manuscripts from the Winchester School or style only survive from about the 930s onwards; this coincided with a wave of revival and reform within English monasticism, encouraged by King √Üthelstan (r. 924/5-939) and his successors. √Üthelstan promoted Dunstan (909‚Äì988), a practising illuminator, eventually to Archbishop of Canterbury, and also √Üthelwold and the French-trained Norseman Oswald. Illumination in a new style appears in a manuscript of the biographies by Bede of St Cuthbert given by √Üthelstan to the monastery in Chester-le-Street about 937. There is a dedication portrait of the king presenting his book to the saint, the two of them standing outside a large church. This is the first real portrait of an English king, and heavily influenced by Carolingian style, with an elegant inhabited acanthus border. However, the initials in the text combine Carolingian elements with animal forms in inventive fashion.Wilson, 156‚Äì157; Dodwell (1993), 95‚Äì96 Miniatures added in England to the continental Aethelstan Psalter begin to show Anglo-Saxon liveliness in figure drawing in compositions derived from Carolingian and Byzantine models, and over the following decades the distinctive Winchester style with agitated draperies and elaborate acanthus borders develops.Dodwell (1993), 96‚Äì104 The Benedictional of St. √Üthelwold is a masterpiece of the later Winchester style, which drew on Insular, Carolingian, and Byzantine art to make a heavier and more grandiose style, where the broad classicising acanthus foliage sometimes seems over- luxuriant. Anglo-Saxon illustration included many lively pen drawings, on which the Carolingian Utrecht Psalter, in Canterbury from about 1000, was highly influential; the Harley Psalter is a copy of it. The Ramsey Psalter (c. 990) contains pages in both the painted and tinted drawing styles, including the first Beatus initial with a \\"lion mask\\", while the Tiberius Psalter, from the last years before the Conquest, uses mainly the tinted. Anglo-Saxon culture was coming into increasing contact with, and exchanging influences with, a wider Latin Mediaeval Europe. Anglo-Saxon drawing had a great influence in Northern France throughout the 11th century, in the so-called \\"Channel school\\", and Insular decorative elements such as interlace remained popular into the 12th century in the Franco-Saxon style.

Metalwork  Sutton Hoo, gold and niello belt buckle Pagan Anglo-Saxon metalwork initially uses the Germanic Animal Style I and II decoration that would be expected from recent immigrants, but gradually develops a distinctive Anglo-Saxon character, as in the Quoit Brooch Style of the 5th century. Anglo-Saxon brooches are the most common survivals of fine metalwork from the earlier period, when they were buried as grave goods. Round disk brooches were preferred for the grandest pieces, over continental styles of fibulae and Romano-British penannular brooches, a consistent Anglo-Saxon taste throughout the period; the Kingston Brooch and Harford Farm Brooch are 7th-century examples. Decoration included cloisonn√© (\\"cellwork\\"), in gold and garnet for high-status pieces. Despite a considerable number of other finds, the discovery of the ship-burial at Sutton Hoo, probably interred in the 620s, transformed the history of Anglo-Saxon art, showing a level of sophistication and quality that was wholly unexpected at this date. The most famous finds are the helmet and matching suite of purse-lid, belt and other fittings of the king buried there, which made clear the source in Anglo-Saxon art, previously much disputed, of many elements of the style of Insular manuscripts. The Fuller Brooch By the 10th century Anglo- Saxon metalwork had a famous reputation as far afield as Italy, where English goldsmiths worked on plate for the altar of St Peter's itself,Wilson, 135 for St Peter's; Dodwell (1982) as next ref. for the reputation. but hardly any pieces have survived the depredations of the Norman Conquest in 1066, and the English Reformation, and none of the large-scale ones, shrines, doors and statues, that we know existed, and of which a few contemporary continental examples have survived.Dodwell (1982):10‚Äì11, 44‚Äì47, 61‚Äì83, 216ff The references to specific works by the 11th century monastic artist Spearhafoc, none of which have identifiably survived, are about works in precious metal, and he is one of a small number of metalwork artists from the period whose name we know and whose work is described in any way. According to several sources, including the Norman chronicler Goscelin, who knew him personally, Spearhafoc \\"was outstanding in painting, gold-engraving and goldsmithery\\", the painting very likely mainly in illuminated manuscripts. It was probably his artistic work which brought into contact with the royal family, and launched his rapid promotion in the church.Dodwell (1982):46 and 55, who quotes Goscelin, and Historia:ciii-cv for the other sources. Even the imprecise details given, mostly by Goscelin, are therefore valuable evidence of what Anglo-Saxon metalwork was like. Anglo-Saxon skill in gold-engraving, designs and figures engraved on gold objects, is mentioned by many foreign sources, and the few remaining engraved figures closely parallel the far more numerous pen-drawn figures in manuscripts, also an Anglo-Saxon speciality. Wall- paintings, which seem to have sometimes contained gold, were also apparently often made by manuscript illuminators, and Goscelin's description of his talents therefore suggests an artist skilled in all the main Anglo-Saxon media for figurative art ‚Äì of which being a goldsmith was then regarded as the most prestigious branch.Dodwell (1982):58, 79‚Äì83, 92‚Äì3 One 11th century lay goldsmith was even a thegn.Wilson, 14 Brooch from the Pentney Hoard, in the Trewhiddle style. Many monastic artists reached senior positions; Spearhafoc's career in metalwork was paralleled in less sensational fashion by his contemporary Mannig, Abbot of Evesham (Abbot 1044‚Äì58, d. 1066),See Dodwell (1982), passim and at the end of the previous century Saint Dunstan had been a very successful Archbishop of Canterbury. Like Spearhafoc, Mannig's biography, with some precise details, is given in the chronicle maintained by his abbey.Gransden:65. History His work also had a miracle associated with it ‚Äì the lay goldsmith Godric stabbed his hand with an awl during the work on the large shrine at Evesham, which was miraculously healed overnight.History:159 and Dodwell (1982):65‚Äì66 Spearhafoc and Mannig are the \\"only two goldsmiths of whom we have extended accounts\\", and the additional information given about Godric, the leader of a team brought in by Mannig for the shrine, is also unique among the surviving evidence. Some twenty years after the miracle, he joined the Abbey of Evesham, presumably in retirement, and his son later became Prior there.Dodwell (1982):48, 80 and 65‚Äì67 In the final century of the period some large figures in precious metal are recorded; presumably these were made of thin sheets over a wooden core like the Golden Madonna of Essen, the largest example of this type of Early Medieval figure to survive from anywhere in Europe. These appear to have been life-size, or nearly so, and were mostly crucifixes, sometimes with figures of Mary and John the Evangelist on either side. Patronage by the great figures of the land, and the largest monasteries, became extravagant in this period, and the greatest late Anglo- Saxon churches must have presented a dazzling spectacle, somewhat in the style of Eastern Orthodox churches. Anglo-Saxon taste revelled in expensive materials and the effects of light on precious metals, which were also embroidered into fabrics and used on wall-paintings.Dodwell (1982), Chapter 2 Sections of decorated elements from some large looted works such as reliquaries were sawn up by Viking raiders and taken home to their wives to wear as jewellery, and a number of these survive in Scandinavian museums. Gold and garnet cloisonn√© (and mud); military fitting from the Staffordshire Hoard before cleaning. While larger works are all lost, several small objects and fragments have survived, nearly all having been buried; in recent decades professional archaeology as well as metal-detecting and deep ploughing have greatly increased the number of objects known. Among the few unburied exceptions are the secular Fuller Brooch, and two works made in Anglo-Saxon style carried to Austria by the Anglo-Saxon mission, the Tassilo Chalice (late 8th century) and the Rupertus Cross. Especially in the 9th century, Anglo- Saxon styles, sometimes derived from manuscripts rather than metal examples, are found in a great number of smaller pieces of jewellery and other small fittings from across northern Europe.Wilson, 9, 133‚Äì137 From England itself, the Alfred Jewel, with an enamel face, is the best known of a group of finely worked liturgical jewels, and there are a number of high quality disk brooches. The most ornate of earlier ones are colourful and complicated with inlays and filigrees, but the 9th century Pentney Hoard, discovered in 1978, contained six splendid brooches in flat silver openwork in the \\"Trewhiddle style\\". In these small but fully formed animals, of no recognisable species, contort themselves in foliage and tendrils that interlace, but without the emphatic geometry of the earlier \\"ribbon\\" style.British Museum Six disc brooches from the Pentney hoard √Üdwen's brooch, an 11th-century Anglo- Scandinavian silver disk brooch, shows influence from Viking art, and a fall- off from the highest earlier standards of workmanship. In 2009 the Staffordshire hoard, a major hoard of over 1,500 fragments of 7th and ?8th century metalwork pieces, mostly gold and military in nature, many with gold and garnet cloisonn√© inlays of high quality, was found by a metal-detectorist in Staffordshire, then in Mercia.Highlights of Anglo-Saxon hoard, The Independent, 24 September 2009, (retrieved 24 September 2009). Jewellery is far more often found from burials of the early pagan period, as Christianity discouraged grave-goods, even the personal possessions of the deceased.Wilson, 12 Early Anglo-Saxon jewellery includes various types of fibulae that are close to their Continental Germanic equivalents, but until Sutton Hoo rarely of outstanding quality, which is why that find transformed thinking about early Anglo-Saxon art. Objects from the Royal Anglo-Saxon tomb in Prittlewell, late 6th century and discovered in 2003, will go on display in 2019. The earliest Anglo-Saxon coin type, the silver sceat, forced craftsmen, no doubt asked to copy Roman and contemporary continental styles, to work outside their traditional forms and conventions in respect of the heads on the obverse, with results that are varied and often compelling. Later silver pennies, with largely linear relief heads of kings in profile on the obverse, are more uniform, as representatives of what was a stable and respected currency by contemporary European standards.Golden Age, 170‚Äì171 A number of complete seax knives have survived with inscriptions and some decoration, and sword fittings and other military pieces are an important form of jewellery. A treatise on social status needed to say that mere ownership of a gilded sword did not make a man a ceorle, the lowest rank of free men.Dodwell (1982), 190 File:2004 sutton hoo 01.JPGReplica helmet from Sutton Hoo File:Alfred Jewel.jpgThe Alfred Jewel, perhaps a pointer for reading, with shaft inserted File:BLW Silver Anglo-Saxon ring.jpgRing, 775-850, in Trewhiddle style File:The Sutton on the Forest Mount YORYM 2009 24.jpgThe Sutton on the Forest Mount. An unusual strap mount in the form of an animal head File:Escrick Ring YORYM 2011 262.jpgThe Escrick ring of gold with a sapphire and glass inset Monumental sculpture and wall painting The Bewcastle Cross (alternative view) Apart from Anglo-Saxon architecture, which survives entirely in churches, with only a handful of largely unaltered examples, monumental stone sculpture survives in large stone crosses, an equivalent to the high crosses of the Celtic areas of Britain. Most sculpture was probably once painted, clarifying the designs, which are mostly in relatively low relief and not finished with great precision, and now almost all badly worn and weathered.Wilson, 152 and passim. Dating is usually difficult. Sculpture in wood was very likely more common, but almost the only significant large survival is St Cuthbert's coffin in Durham Cathedral, probably made in 698, with numerous linear images carved or incised in a technique that is a sort of large-scale engraving.Wilson, 50‚Äì53 The material of the earliest recorded crosses is unknown, but may well have been wood. From various references (to its destruction by Christians) there would seem to have been a tradition of Anglo-Saxon pagan monumental sculpture, probably in wood, of which no examples remain (as opposed to later Anglo- Scandinavian pagan imagery),No unmixed examples, that is to say. Scenes from Germanic mythology still appear in works of the Christian period, as in the Franks Casket and Gosforth Cross. and with which the crosses initially competed. The Anglo-Saxon crosses have survived less well than those in Ireland, being more subject to iconoclasm after the English Reformation. Some featured large figurative sculpture of considerable quality, as on the Ruthwell Cross and Bewcastle Cross (both probably around 800). Vine-scroll decoration and interlace are seen in alternating panels on the early Northumbrian Ruthwell, Bewcastle and Easby Crosses, though the vine-scroll is already more prominent, and has faces to itself. Later Southumbrian crosses often only use vine-scrolls. There may be inscriptions, in the runic or Roman scripts, and Latin or Old English, most famously at Ruthwell, where some of the poem the Dream of the Rood is inscribed together with Latin texts; more often donors are commemorated. It has also been suggested that as well as paint, they may have been embellished with metalwork and gems.Sanbach crosses Typically, Anglo-Saxon crosses are tall and slender compared to Irish examples, many with a nearly square section, and more space given to ornament than figures. However, there are exceptions, like the massive Sandbach Crosses from Mercia, with oblong sections mostly covered by figures on the wider faces, like some Irish crosses. The Gosforth Cross, of 930‚Äì950, is a rare example to survive complete; most survivals are only a section of the shaft, and iconoclasts were more concerned to destroy imagery than ornament. Many crosses must have just fallen over after some centuries; headpieces are the least common survivals, and the Easby Cross was repaired with lead in a way described in early documents.V&A; Museum, Easby Cross, A.88‚Äì1930 Like many monuments from the area of the Danelaw, the Gosforth Cross combines Christian images with those from pagan mythology; apart from a Crucifixion scene, and perhaps scenes of the Last Judgement, all the other images appear to belong to the Norse myth of Ragnar√∂k, the destruction of the gods, a theme detected in other Christian monuments in Britain and Scandinavia, and which could be turned to Christian advantage.Bailey, 18‚Äì22; Wilson, 150 Fragment of cross shaft from St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester; at right with added, but perhaps not inauthentic, colour. Anglo-Scandinavians took up Anglo-Saxon sculptural forms with great enthusiasm, and in Yorkshire alone there are fragments from more than 500 monumental sculptures of the 10th and 11th centuries. However quantity was not matched by quality, and even the products of the main city, York, are described by David M. Wilson as \\"generally miserable and slipshod\\".Wilson, 142‚Äì152; 142 \\"more than 500; 144 (quote) In the early stages the successive styles of Norse art appear in England, but gradually as political and cultural ties weakened the Anglo-Scandinavians fail to keep up with trends in the homeland. So elements of the Borre style are seen, for example in the \\"ring-chain\\" interlace on the Gosforth Cross, and then the complex animals of the Jelling style are mostly rather incompetently depicted in England, but traces of the next Mammen style are hard to detect; they are much clearer on the Isle of Man. They are \\"perhaps, dimly\\" evident in the cross shaft from St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester (illustrated right). In general the traces of these styles in other media are even fainter.Wilson, 142‚Äì149, quote 147 A uniquely Anglo-Scandinavian form is the hogback, low grave-marker shaped like a long house with a pitched roof, and sometimes muzzled bears clutching on to each end. Ornament is sometimes a crude pattern of scoring, or scale-like elements presumably representing roofing shingles, but may include interlace and images.Wilson, 149; Laing's typology is shown in 3 pages of drawings here from the AS Sculpture Corpus website; photo of good examples from Brompton, Yorkshire Many fragments, parts of friezes and panels with figure and ornamental carving, have been recovered by archaeology, usually after being reused in rebuilt churches. The largest group of Anglo- Saxon sculpture is from a former abbey at Breedon-on-the-Hill in Mercia, with a number of elements of different dates, including lively narrow decorative strip friezes, many including human figures, and panels with saints and the Virgin.Wilson, 80‚Äì81 The most intriguing fragments are firstly a group, now at Canterbury Cathedral, from St Mary's Church, Reculver, in Kent, from a large composition with many figure scenes and groups on a curved surface, evidently of high quality, though uncertain date (perhaps early 10th century). A Sacrifice of Isaac and an Ascension can be identified, and parts of standing groups of saints, prophets or apostles.Golden Age, 40‚Äì41; Wilson, 70‚Äì72 Standing equally apart from other survivals is a late slab from the Old Minster, Winchester which appears to show a section of a large frieze with the story from Germanic mythology of Sigmund, which it has been suggested may have been as long as eighty feet wide, and over four feet high. There are literary references to secular narrative tapestries, a tradition of which the Bayeux Tapestry is the only survival, and this may have been a stone equivalent, celebrating Sigmund, who was believed to be an ancestor of the intermarried royal houses of both England and Denmark, many of whom were buried in what was then the largest church in England.Golden Age, 133‚Äì134; Dodwell (1982), 137‚Äì138; Henderson, 171‚Äì173 It is also clear from literary sources that wall paintings were not uncommon, although not a prestigious form, and fragments of painted plaster have been found, as well as a painted face on a reused stone at Winchester, dating to before 903, and so an important early example of the Winchester figure style.Dodwell (1982), 92‚Äì93; Wilson, 10‚Äì13, 155; Golden Age, 44 A metaphor in a letter of Alcuin speaks of \\"stars, like the painted ceiling of a great man's house\\".Wilson, 131 However, no paintings that are at all complete have survived on either wall or panel.

File:Anglo Saxon stone carving 015.jpgWorn relief of an angel File:Gosforth hogsback tombs.jpgHogback tombs at Gosforth, Cumbria Ivory carving Head of a tau cross, with Christ Treading on the Beasts, an especially popular subject in England As in the rest of the Christian world, while monumental sculpture was slowly re-emerging from its virtual absence in the Early Christian period, small-scale sculpture in metalwork, ivory carving and also bone carving was more important than in later periods, and by no means a \\"minor art\\". Most Anglo-Saxon ivory was from marine animals, especially the walrus, imported from further north. The extraordinary early Franks Casket is carved from whalebone, which a riddle on it alludes to. It contains a unique mixture of pagan, historical and Christian scenes, evidently attempting to cover a general history of the world, and inscriptions in runes in both Latin and Old English. We have few Anglo-Saxon panels from book-covers compared to those from Carolingian and Ottonian art but a number of figures of very high quality in high relief or fully in the round. In the last phase of Anglo-Saxon art two styles are apparent: one a heavier and formal one drawing from Carolingian and Ottonian sources, and the other the Winchester style, drawing from the Utrecht Psalter and an alternative Carolingian tradition.Golden Age, 88 A very late boxwood casket, now in Cleveland, Ohio, is carved all over with scenes from the Life of Christ in a provincial but accomplished version of the Winchester style, possibly originating in the West Midlands, and is a unique survival of late Anglo-Saxon fine wood carving.Golden Age, 125‚Äì126;Cleveland Museum of Art, Accession No.: 1953.362 File:Franks Casket back panel.jpgRear panel of the Franks Casket; Titus takes Jerusalem.

The textile arts of embroidery and \\"tapestry\\", Opus anglicanum, were apparently those for which Anglo-Saxon England was famous throughout Europe by the end of the period, but there are only a handful of survivals, probably partly because of the Anglo- Saxon love of using threads in precious metal, making the work valuable for scrap. The Bayeux Tapestry is embroidered in wool on linen and shows the story of the Norman conquest of England; it is surely the best known Anglo-Saxon work of art, and though made after the Conquest was both made in England and firmly in an Anglo-Saxon tradition, points now accepted by French art- historians.Golden Age, 195; Dodwell (1982), 138‚Äì139. However a number of fringe theories persist ‚Äì see the article. See also Henderson, 168‚Äì177 for an extended appreciation. Such tapestries adorned both churches and wealthy houses in England, though at 0.5 by 68.38 metres (1.6 by 224.3 ft, and apparently incomplete) the Bayeux Tapestry must be exceptionally large. Only the figures and decoration are embroidered, on a background left plain, which shows the subject very clearly and was necessary to cover very large areas. All kinds of textile arts were produced by women, both nuns and laywomen, but many were probably designed by artists in other media. Byzantine silks were available, though certainly expensive, in Anglo-Saxon England, and a number of pieces have been found used in burials and reliquaries. Probably, as in later vestments, these were often married with locally embroidered borders and panels. If we had more Anglo-Saxon survivals, Byzantine influences would no doubt be apparent.Dodwell (1982), Chapter V; Dodwell (1993), Chapter 2 The most highly valued embroideries were very different, fully worked in silk and gold of silver thread, and sometimes with gems of various sorts sewn in. These were used for vestments, altar-cloths and other church uses, and similar roles in the homes of the elite. Only a few pieces have survived, including three pieces at Durham placed in the coffin of St Cuthbert, probably in the 930s, after being given by King Athelstan; they were made in Winchester between 909 and 916. These are works \\"of breathtaking brilliance and quality\\", according to Wilson, including figures of saints, and important early examples of the Winchester style, though the origin of their style is a puzzle; they are closest to the wall-painting fragment from Winchester mentioned above, and an early example of acanthus decoration.Wilson, 154‚Äì156, quote 155; Dodwell (1993), 26; Golden Age, 19, 44, though neither these nor any textiles could be lent for the exhibition; St. Cuthbert Embroideries, from Textile Research Centre, Leiden The earliest group of survivals, now re-arranged and with the precious metal thread mostly picked out, are bands or borders from vestments, incorporating pearls and glass beads, with various types of scroll and animal decoration. These are probably 9th century and now in a church in Maaseik in Belgium.Wilson, 108; Dodwell (1993), 27, who gives details of further fragments. A further style of textile is a vestment illustrated in a miniature portrait of Saint Aethelwold in his Benedictional (see above), which shows the edge of what appears to be a huge acanthus \\"flower\\" (a term used in several documentary records) covering the wearer's back and shoulders. Other written sources mention other large-scale compositions.Dodwell (1982), 183‚Äì185; portrait of Saint Aethelwold Other materials Claw beaker in glass Anglo- Saxon glass was mostly made in simple forms, with vessels always in a single colour, either clear, green or brown, but some fancy claw beakers decorated with large \\"claw\\" forms have survived, mostly broken; these forms are also found in northern continental Europe. Beads, common in early female burials, and some ecclesiastical window glass was more brightly coloured, and several monastic sites have evidence of glass production. Vessel and bead production probably continued, at a much lower level, from the Romano-British industry, but Bede records that Benedict Biscop brought glass-makers from Gaul for window glass at his monasteries. It is not clear how much Anglo-Saxon glass was imported, but canes of millefiori coloured glass almost certainly were; one of these was in the purse at Sutton Hoo. Otherwise recycling of Roman glass may have avoided the need to import raw glass; evidence for the production of this is slender. Glass is sometimes used as a substitute for garnet in jewellery, as in some pieces from Sutton Hoo. Enamel was used, most famously in the Alfred Jewel, where the image sits under carved rock crystal, both materials are extremely rare in surviving Anglo-Saxon work. The unique decorated leather cover of the small Northumbrian St Cuthbert Gospel, the oldest Western bookbinding to survive unaltered, can be dated to 698 or shortly before. It uses incised lines, some colours, and relief decoration built up over cord and gesso or leather pieces. Larger prestige manuscripts had metalwork treasure bindings, several of which are mentioned, but there may well have been much decorated leatherwork for secular satchels, purses, belts and the like, which contemporaries did not bother to mention and which represents a gap in our knowledge for the Early Medieval period throughout Europe. Aftermath The front cover of the St Cuthbert Gospel, 690s; the original tooled red goatskin binding is the earliest surviving Western bookbinding Relatively little art survives from the rest of the century after 1066, or at least is confidently dated to that period. The art of Normandy was already under heavy Anglo-Saxon influence, but the period was one of massive despoliation of the churches by the small new ruling class, who had almost entirely dispossessed the old Anglo-Saxon elite. Under these circumstances little significant art was produced, but when it was, the style often showed a slow development of Anglo-Saxon styles into a fully Romanesque version.Zarnecki, 17‚Äì23, 83‚Äì84, 232 The attribution of many individual objects has jumped around across the boundary of the Norman Conquest, especially for sculpture, including ivories. A number of objects are claimed for their period by both the \\"Golden Age of Anglo-Saxon Art\\" and the \\"English Romanesque art: 1066‚Äì1200\\" exhibition catalogues, despite both being published in 1984. These include the ivory triangle mount with angels and the \\"Sigurd\\" stone relief fragment (discussed above), both from Winchester, and the ivory \\"pen-case\\" and Baptism (illustrated above), both in the British Museum.Respectively numbers: Golden Age: 114, 140, 132, 117, and Zarnecki: 190, 97, 185, 180. There are many other examples. The energy, love of complicated twining ornament, and refusal to wholly respect a dignified classical decorum that are displayed in both Insular and Winchester school art had already influenced continental style, as discussed above, where it provided an alternative to the heavy monumentality that Ottonian art displays even in small objects. This habit of mind was an essential component of both the Romanesque and Gothic styles, where forms of Anglo-Saxon invention such as the inhabited and historiated initials became more important than they ever had in Anglo-Saxon art itself, and works like the Gloucester Candlestick (c. 1110) show the process in other media.Henderson, 63‚Äì71 Anglo-Saxon iconographical innovations include the animal Hellmouth, the ascending Christ shown only as a pair of legs and feet disappearing at the top of the image, the horned Moses, St John the Evangelist standing at the foot of the cross and writing, and God the Father creating the world with a pair of compasses. All of these were later used across Europe.Dodwell (1993), 117 The earliest developed depiction of the Last Judgement in the West is also found on an Anglo-Saxon ivory, and a late Anglo- Saxon Gospel book may show the earliest example of Mary Magdalene at the foot of the cross in a Crucifixion.It is the earliest cited by Schiller, II, 117  See also  *Medieval art *Viking art *Migration Period art *List of illuminated Anglo-Saxon manuscripts *Anglo-Saxon architecture *Anglo-Saxon literature *Anglo-Saxon glass Notes  References  * *\\"Dodwell (1982)\\": Dodwell, C.

His love for ancient Greece and Rome, which he studied for much of his life, is also reflected in his works. Maykov spent four years translating the epic The Tale of Igor's Campaign (1870) into modern Russian. He translated the folklore of Belarus, Greece, Serbia and Spain, as well as works by Heine, Adam Mickiewicz and Goethe, among others. Several of Maykov's poems were set to music by Russian composers, among them Rimsky-Korsakov and Tchaikovsky. Maykov was born into an artistic family and educated at home, by the writer Ivan Goncharov, among others. At the age of 15, he began writing his first poetry. After finishing his gymnasium course in just three years, he enrolled in Saint Petersburg University in 1837. He began publishing his poems in 1840, and came out with his first collection in 1842. The collection was reviewed favorably by the influential critic Vissarion Belinsky. After this, he traveled throughout Europe, returning to Saint Petersburg in 1844, where he continued to publish poetry and branched out into literary criticism and essay writing. He continued writing throughout his life, wavering several times between the conservative and liberal camps, but maintaining a steady output of quality poetical works. In his liberal days he was close to Belinsky, Nikolay Nekrasov, and Ivan Turgenev, while in his conservative periods he was close to Fyodor Dostoyevsky. He ended his life as a conservative. Maykov died in Saint Petersburg On March 8, 1897. Biography Apollon Maykov was born into an artistic family. His father, Nikolay Maykov, was a painter, and in his later years an academic of the Imperial Academy of Arts. His mother, Yevgeniya Petrovna Maykova (n√©e Gusyatnikova, 1803‚Äì1880), loved literature and later in life had some of her own poetry published. The boy's childhood was spent at the family estate just outside Moscow, in a house often visited by writers and artists. Maykov's early memories and impressions formed the foundation for his much lauded landscape lyricism, marked by what biographer Igor Yampolsky calls \\"a touchingly naive love for the old patriarchal ways.\\" In 1834 the family moved to Saint Petersburg. Apollon and his brother Valerian were educated at home, under the guidance of their father's friend Vladimir Solonitsyn, a writer, philologist and translator, known also for Nikolay Maykov's 1839 portrait of him. Ivan Goncharov, then an unknown young author, taught Russian literature to the Maykov brothers. As he later remembered, the house \\"was full of life, and had many visitors, providing a never ceasing flow of information from all kinds of intellectual spheres, including science and the arts.\\"Goncharov, A.I. N.A.Maykov. Obituary. Golos (The Voice). 1873. No 238. August 29. At the age of 15 Apollon started to write poetry. With a group of friends (Vladimir Benediktov, Ivan Goncharov and Pavel Svinyin among others) the Maykov brothers edited two hand-written magazines, Podsnezhnik (Snow-drop) and Moonlit Nights, where Apollon's early poetry appeared for the first time. Maykov finished his whole gymnasium course in just three years, and in 1837 enrolled in Saint Petersburg University's law faculty. As a student he learned Latin which enabled him to read Ancient Roman authors in the original texts. He later learned Ancient Greek, but until then had to content himself with French translations of the Greek classics. It was at the university that Maykov developed his passionate love of Ancient Greece and Rome. =Literary career= Apollon Maykov's first poems (signed \\"M.\\") were published in 1840 by the Odessa Almanac and in 1841 by Biblioteka Dlya Chteniya and Otechestvennye Zapiski. He also studied painting, but soon chose to devote himself entirely to poetry. Instrumental in this decision was Pyotr Pletnyov, a University professor who, acting as a mentor for the young man, showed the first poems of his prot√©g√© to such literary giants as Vasily Zhukovsky and Nikolai Gogol. Maykov never became a painter, but the lessons he received greatly influenced his artistic worldview and writing style. In 1842 his first collection Poems by A.N. Maykov was published, to much acclaim. \\"For me it sounds like Delvig's ideas expressed by Pushkin,\\" Pletnyov wrote.Y.K.Grot and P.A.Pletnyov's correspondence. Saint Petersburg, 1896. Vol. 1. P.483. Vissarion Belinsky responded with a comprehensive essay,Belivsky, V., Russian Literature in 1842. The Works of... In 9 Volumes, Vol. 6, p. 207) praising the book's first section called \\"Poems Written for an Anthology\\", a cycle of verses stylized after both ancient Greek epigrams and the traditional elegy. He was flattered by the famous critic's close attention.There was a \\"cult of Belinsky\\" in the Maykov family, partly imposed upon them by Ivan Goncharov, for whom Belinsky was a genius. Maykov paid heed to his advice and years later, working on the re-issues, edited much of the text in direct accordance with Belinsky's views.Lansky, L. The Belinsky Library. Literaturnoye Nasledstvo (The Literary Heritage). Vol. 55, Moscow., 1948, pp. 474‚Äî476. After graduating from the university, Maykov joined the Russian Ministry of Finance as a clerk. Having received a stipend for his first book from Tsar Nicholas I, he used the money to travel abroad, visiting Italy (where he spent most of his time writing poetry and painting), France, Saxony, and Austria. In Paris Apollon and Valerian attended lectures on literature and fine arts at the Sorbonne and the College de France. On his way back Maykov visited Dresden and Prague where he met Vaclav Hanka and Pavel Jozef Safarik, the two leaders of the national revival movement. The direct outcome of this voyage for Apollon Maykov was a University dissertation on the history of law in Eastern Europe. Maykov circa 1850 In 1844 Maykov returned to Saint Petersburg to join the Rumyantsev Museum library as an assistant. He became actively involved with the literary life of the Russian capital, contributing to Otechestvennye Zapiski, Finsky Vestnik and Sovremennik. He also debuted as a critic and published several essays on literature and fine art, reviewing works by artists like Ivan Aivazovsky, Fyodor Tolstoy and Pavel Fedotov. In 1846 the Petersburg Anthology published his poem \\"Mashenka\\", which saw Maykov discarding elegy and leaning towards a more down-to-Earth style of writing. Again Belinsky was impressed, hailing the arrival of \\"a new talent, quite capable of presenting real life in its true light.\\"The Works of Belinsky. Moscow, 1982. Vol. 8. P. 148 The critic also liked Two Fates (Saint Petersburg, 1845). A \\"natural school\\" piece, touched by Mikhail Lermontov's influence, it featured \\"a Pechorin-type character, an intelligent, thinking nobleman retrogressing into a low-brow philistine,\\" according to Alexander Hertzen's review.The Complete Hertzen. In 30 volumes, Moscow, 1954. Vol. 2. P. 411 In the late 1840s Maykov was also writing prose, in a Gogol-influenced style known as the \\"physiological sketch\\". Among the short stories he published at the time were \\"Uncle's Will\\" (1847) and \\"The Old Woman ‚Äì Fragments from the Notes of a Virtuous Man\\" (1848). In the late 1840s Maykov entered Belinsky's circle and became friends with Nikolai Nekrasov and Ivan Turgenev. Along with his brother Valerian he started to attend Mikhail Petrashevsky's 'Secret Fridays', establishing contacts with Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Aleksey Pleshcheyev. Later, having been interrogated about his involvement, Maykov avoided arrest (he did not have a significant role in the group's activities), but for several years was kept under secret police surveillance. In the years to come Maykov, who never believed in the ideas of socialism, often expressed embarrassment over his involvement in the Petrashevsky affair. In an 1854 letter to M. A. Yazykov he confessed: \\"At the time I had very vague political ideas and was foolish enough to join a group where all the government's actions were criticized and condemned as wrong a priory, many of [its members] applauding every mistake, according to the logic of 'the worse they rule, the quicker they'll fall'.Yampolsky, I.G. Extracts From A.N.Maykov's Archives. The Pushkin House's Yearly almanac, 1974. P.37 In the 1850s Maykov, now a Slavophile, began to champion 'firm' monarchy and strong Orthodox values. Writing to Aleksandr Nikitenko he argued: \\"Only a form of political system which had been proven by the test of history could be called viable\\".A letter to A.V.Nikitenko. Yampolsky I.G., Poets and Prosaics, Leningrad, 1986, p. 136 In 1852 Maykov moved into the office of the Russian Committee of Foreign censorship, where he continued working for the rest of his life, becoming its chairman in 1882. In 1847 Maykov's second collection of poems, Sketches of Rome, the artistic outcome of his earlier European trip, was published. Informed with Belinsky's criticism, some poems were built on the juxtaposition of the majestic ruins and lush landscapes of 'classic' Rome with the everyday squalor of contemporary Italy. This homage to the \\"natural school\\" movement, though, did not make Maykov's style less flamboyant; on the contrary, it was in Sketches of Rome that he started to make full use of exotic epithets and colorful imagery. In 1848‚Äì1852 Maykov wrote little, but became active during the Crimean War. First came the poem \\"Claremont Cathedral\\" (1853), an ode to Russia's historical feat of preventing the Mongol hordes from devastating European civilization.The same idea was central to Pushkin's famous letter to Pyotr Chaadayev (October 19, 1836), but the letter had not been published yet, so Maykov was almost certainly unaware of its existence. This was followed by the compilation Poems, 1854. Some of the poems, like those about the siege of Sevastopol (\\"To General-Lieutenant Khrulyov\\") were welcomed by the literary left (notably Nekrasov and Chernyshevsky). Others (\\"In Memory of Derzhavin\\" and \\"A Message to the Camp\\") were seen as glorifying the monarchy and were deemed 'reactionary'. The last 1854 poem, \\"The Harlequin\\", was a caricature on a revolutionary keen to bring chaos and undermine centuries-old moral principles. Now a 'patriarchal monarchist', Maykov started to praise the Nikolai I regime. Another poem, \\"The Carriage\\", where Maykov openly supported the Tsar, was not included in 1854, but circulated in its hand-written version and did his reputation a lot of harm. Enemies either ridiculed the poet or accused him of political opportunism and base flattery. Some of his friends were positively horrified. In his epigrams, poet Nikolay Shcherbina labeled Maykov 'chameleon' and 'servile slave'. While social democrats (who dominated the Russian literary scene of the time) saw political and social reforms as necessary for Russia, Maykov called for the strengthening of state power. After Russia's defeat in the war the tone of Maykov's poetry changed. Poems like \\"The war is over. Vile peace is signed...\\", \\"Whirlwind\\" (both 1856), \\"He and Her\\" (1867) criticized corrupt high society and weak, inadequate officials who were indifferent to the woes of the country and its people. Now openly critical of Nikolai I, Maykov admitted to having been wrong when professing a belief in the monarch.The Voice of The Past, 1919. No 1/4. p. 107 Maykov in the 1850s In 1858 Maykov took part in the expedition to Greece on board the corvette Bayan. Prior to that he read numerous books about the country and learned the modern Greek language. Two books came out as a result of this trip: The Naples Album (which included \\"Tarantella\\", one of his best known poems) and Songs of Modern Greece. The former, focusing on contemporary Italian life, was coldly received by Russian critics who found it too eclectic. In retrospect it is regarded as a curious experiment in breaking genre barriers, with images and conversations from foreign life used to express things which in Russia could not be commented on publicly at the time. In the latter, the author's sympathy for the Greek liberation movement is evident. The early 1860s saw Maykov's popularity on the rise: he often performed in public and had his works published by the leading Russian magazines.Stackenshneider, E.A. Diary and Notes. Moscow, Leningrad, 1934.p. 48 In the mid-1860s he once again drifted towards the conservative camp, and stayed there for the rest of his life. He condemned young radicals, and expressed solidarity with Mikhail Katkov's nationalistic remarks regarding the Polish Uprising and Russian national policy in general. In poems like \\"Fields\\" (which employed Gogol's metaphor of Russia as a troika, but also expressed horror at emerging capitalism), \\"Niva\\" and \\"The Sketch\\" he praised the 1861 reforms, provoking sharp criticism from Saltykov-SchedrinThe Complete –ú. –ï. Saltykov-Schedrin, Vol.5, Moscow, 1966, p. 434 and Nikolay Dobrolyubov. Adopting the Pochvennichestvo doctrine, Maykov became close to Apollon Grigoriev, Nikolai Strakhov, and Fyodor Dostoyevsky; his friendship with the latter proved to be a particularly firm and lasting one. In the 1860s and 1870s Maykov contributed mainly to Russky Vestnik. One of the leading proponents of Russian Panslavism, he saw his country as fulfilling its mission in uniting Slavs, but first and foremost freeing the peoples of the Balkans from Turkish occupation. \\"Once you've seen Russia in this [Panslavic] perspective, you start to understand its true nature and feel ready to devote yourself to this life-affirming cause,\\" wrote Maykov in a letter to Dostoyevsky.Dostoyevsky, F.M. Articles and other materials. Moscow- Leningrad. 1924, Book 2, p. 341 The mission of art, according to the poet, was to develop the national self-consciousness and revive the 'historical memory' of Russians. The Slavic historic and moral basis on which it stood became the major theme of Maykov's poetry cycles \\"Of the Slavic World\\", \\"At Home\\", and \\"Callings of History\\". Well aware of the darker side of Russia's historic legacy, he still thought it necessary to highlight its 'shining moments' (\\"It's dear to me, before the icon...\\", 1868). Maykov was not a religious person himself but attributed great importance to the religious fervor of the common people, seeing it as the basis for 'moral wholesomeness' (\\"The spring, like an artist\\", 1859; \\"Ignored by all...\\", 1872). His religious poems of the late 1880s (\\"Let go, let go...\\", \\"The sunset‚Äôs quiet shine...\\", \\"Eternal night is near...\\") differed radically from his earlier odes to paganism. In them Maykov professed a belief in spiritual humility and expressed the conviction that this particular feature of the Russian national character would be its saving grace. Maykov and revolutionary democrats Unlike his artistic ally Afanasy Fet, Maykov always felt the need for maintaining 'spiritual bonds' with common people and, according to biographer Yampolsky, followed \\"the folk tradition set by Pushkin, Lermontov, Krylov and Koltsov\\". Yet he was skeptical of the doctrine of narodnost as formulated by Dobrolyubov and Chernyshevsky, who saw active promotion of the democratic movement as the mission of Russian literature. In 1853, horrified by Nekrasov's poem \\"The Muse\\", Maykov wrote \\"An Epistle to Nekrasov\\", in which he urged the latter to \\"dilute his malice in nature's harmony.\\" Yet he never severed ties with his opponent and often gave him credit. \\"There is only one poetic soul here, and that is Nekrasov,\\" Maykov wrote in an October 1854 letter to Ivan Nikitin.Russky Bibliofil. 1916, No 7, p. 74. According to Yampolsky, Nekrasov's poem \\"Grandfather\\" (1870, telling the story of a nobleman supporting the revolutionary cause) might have been an indirect answer to Maykov's poem \\"Grandmother\\" (1861) which praised the high moral standards of the nobility and condemned the generation of nihilists. Maykov's poem Princess (1876) had its heroine Zhenya, a girl from an aristocratic family, join a gang of conspirators and lose all notions of normality, religious, social or moral. However, unlike Vsevolod Krestovsky or Viktor Klyushnikov, Maykov treated his 'nihilist' characters rather like victims of the post-Crimean war social depression rather than villains in their own right. The Tale of Igor's Campaign Seeking inspiration and moral virtue in Russian folklore, which he called \\"the treasury of the Russian soul\\", Maykov tried to revive the archaic Russian language tradition.Letter to M.P. Pogodin, October 18, 1869. The Central Russian Literary Archives In his later years he made numerous freestyle translations and stylized renditions of Belarussian and Serbian folk songs. He developed a strong interest in non-Slavic folklore too, exemplified by the epic poems Baldur (1870) and Bringilda (1888) based on the Scandinavian epos. In the late 1860s Maykov became intrigued by The Tale of Igor's Campaign, which his son was studying in gymnasium at the time. Baffled by the vagueness and occasional incongruity of all the available translations, he shared his doubts with professor Izmail Sreznevsky, who replied: \\"It is for you to sort these things out.\\" Maykov later described the four years of work on the new translation that followed as his \\"second university\\". His major objective was to come up with undeniable proof of the authenticity of the old text, something that many authors, Ivan Goncharov among them, expressed doubts about. Ignoring Dostoyevsky's advice to use rhymes so as to make the text sound more modern, Maykov provided the first ever scientifically substantiated translation of the document, supplied with comprehensive commentaries. First published in the January 1870 issue of Zarya magazine, it is still regarded as one of the finest achievements of his career. For Maykov, who took his historical poems and plays seriously, authenticity was the main objective. In his Old Believers drama The Wanderer (1867), he used the hand-written literature of raskolniks and, \\"having discovered those poetic gems, tried to re-mold them into... modern poetic forms,\\" as he explained in the preface.Preface to Strannik. Maykov, A.N. The Selected Works of... 1977. Leningrad, p. 847. In his historical works Maykov often had contemporary Russian issues in mind. \\"While writing of ancient history I was looking for parallels to the things that I had to live through. Our times provide so many examples of the rise and fall of the human spirit that an attentive eye looking for analogies can spot a lot,\\" he wrote.Sukhomlinov. The Poetry of A.N.Maykov and its peculiarities. Russkaya starina. 1899, No 3, p. 486-487. Christianity and paganism Maykov in his later years Maykov's first foray into the history of early Christianity, \\"Olynthus and Esther\\" (1841) was criticized by Belinsky. He returned to this theme ten years later in the lyrical drama Three Deaths (1857), was dissatisfied with the result, and went on to produce part two, \\"The Death of Lucius\\" (1863). Three Deaths became the starting point of his next big poem, Two Worlds, written in 1872, then re- worked and finished in 1881. Following Belinsky's early advice, Maykov abandoned Lucius, a weak Epicurean, and made the new hero Decius, a patrician who, while hating Nero, still hopes for the state to rise up from its ashes. Like Sketches of Rome decades earlier, Two Worlds was a eulogy to Rome's eternal glory, its hero fighting Christianity, driven by the belief that Rome is another Heaven, \\"its dome embracing Earth.\\" While in his earlier years Maykov was greatly intrigued by antiquity, later in life he became more interested in Christianity and its dramatic stand against oppressors. While some contemporaries praised Maykov for his objectivity and scholarly attitude, the Orthodox Christian critics considered him to be \\"too much of a heathen\\" who failed to show Christianity in its true historical perspective.Umansky, A. Apollon Nikolayevich Maykov. Russkoye Bogatstvo. 1897, No 4, p. 41 Later literary historians viewed Maykov's historical dramas favourably, crediting the author for neutrality and insight. Maykov's antiquity \\"lives and breathes, it is anything but dull,\\" wrote critic F. Zelinsky in 1908.Zelinsky, F. The Ancient World in A.N.Maykov‚Äôs Poetry. The Lives of Ideas. Saint Petersburg, 1908, p. 235. For the Two Worlds Maykov received The Russian Academy of Sciences' Pushkin Prize in 1882. Last years In 1858 Grigory Kushelev- Bezborodko published the first Maykov anthology Poems by Ap. Maykov. In 1879 it was expanded and re-issued by Vladimir Meshchersky. The Complete Maykov came out in 1884 (its second edition following in 1893). In the 1880s Maykov's poetry was dominated by religious and nationalistic themes and ideas. According to I. Yampolsky, only a few of his later poems (\\"Emshan\\", \\"The Spring\\", 1881) had 'indisputable artistic quality'. In his later years the poet wrote almost nothing new, engaging mostly in editing his earlier work and preparing them for compilations and anthologies. \\"Maykov lived the quiet, radiant life of an artist, evidently not belonging to our times... his path was smooth and full of light. No strife, no passions, no persecution,\\" wrote Dmitry Merezhkovsky in 1908.Merezhkovsky, Dmitry. Eternal Companions. Dostoyevsky, Goncharov, Maykov. 3rd ed. Saint Petersburg, 1908, p. 66. Although this generalization was far from the truth, according to biographer F. Priyma, it certainly expressed the general public's perception of him. Apollon Maykov died in Saint Petersburg On March 8, 1897. \\"His legacy will always sound as the mighty, harmonious and very complicated final chord to the Pushkin period of Russian poetry,\\" wrote Arseny Golenishchev-Kutuzov in the Ministry of Education's obituary.The Journal of the Ministry of Education. 1897. No.4, section IV.P. 53 Legacy Maykov's initial rise to fame, according to the Soviet scholar Fyodor Pryima, had a lot to do with Pushkin and Lermontov's untimely deaths, and the feeling of desolation shared by many Russian intellectuals of the time. Vissarion Belinsky, who discovered this new talent, believed it was up to Maykov to fill this vacuum. \\"The emergence of this new talent is especially important in our times, when in the devastated Church of Art... we see but grimacing jesters entertaining dumb obscurants, egotistic mediocrities, merchants and speculators,\\" Belinsky wrote, reviewing Maykov's debut collection.The Complete V.G. Belinsky. Vol. 6, Moscow, 1955, p. 7. The sleeve of Poems by Apollon Maykov in 2 volumes, 1858. Hailing the emergence of a new powerful talent, Belinsky unreservedly supported the young author's 'anthological' stylizations based upon the poetry of Ancient Greece, praising \\"the plasticity and gracefulness of the imagery,\\" the virtuosity in the art of the decorative, the \\"poetic, lively language\\" but also the simplicity and lack of pretentiousness.The Works of V.G. Belinsky in 9 Volumes. Moscow, 1979 Vol. 4, pp. 344‚Äì346. \\"Even in Pushkin's legacy this poem would have rated among his best anthological pieces,\\" Belinsky wrote about the poem called \\"The Dream\\".The Complete V. G. Belinsky, Vol. VI, pp. 10‚Äì11. Still, he advised the author to leave the 'anthological' realm behind as soon as possibleThe Complete V.G. Belinsky, Vol. I, p. 27. and expressed dissatisfaction with poems on Russia's recent history. While admitting \\"Who's He\\" (a piece on Peter the Great, which some years later found its way into textbooks) was \\"not bad\\", Belinsky lambasted \\"Two Coffins\\", a hymn to Russia's victories over Karl XII and Napoleon. Maykov's debut collection made him one of the leading Russian poets. In the 1840s \\"his lexical and rhythmic patterns became more diverse but the style remained the same, still relying upon the basics of classical elegy,\\" according to the biographer Mayorova, who noted a strange dichotomy between the flamboyant wording and static imagery, and pointed to the \\"insurmountable distance between the poet and the world he pictured.\\" After Belinsky's death, Maykov started to waver between the two camps of the Westernizers and the Slavophiles, and the critics, accordingly, started to treat his work on the basis of their own political views in relation to the poet's changing ideological stance. Maykov's 1840s' \\"natural school\\"- influenced poems were praised (and published) by Nikolay Nekrasov. His later works, expressing conservative, monarchist and anti-'nihilist' views, were supported by Dostoyevsky, who on more than one occasion pronounced Maykov Russia's major poet. In his 1895 article for the Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary, the philosopher and critic Vladimir Solovyov argued that Maykov's dominant characteristics were \\"a serene, contemplating tone, elaborate patterns, a distinct and individual style (in form, although not in colors) with a relatively lackluster lyric side, the latter suffering obviously from too much attention to details, often at the expense of the original inspiration.\\" Maykov's best works were, the critic opined, \\"powerful and expressive, even if not exceptionally sonorous.\\" Speaking of Maykov's subject matter, Solovyov was almost dismissive: > Two major themes form the foundation of Maykov's poetry, the Ancient Greek > aesthetic and historical myths of the Byzantine-Russian politics; bonded > only by the poet's unreserved love for both, never merge... The concept of > Byzantium, as the second Rome, though, has not crystallized as clear and > distinct in the poet's mind as that of the original Roman Empire. He loves > Byzantine/Russia in its historical reality, refusing to admit its faults and > contradictions, tending to glorify even such monsters as Ivan the Terrible, > whose \\"greatness\\", he believes, will be \\"recognised\\" in due time. [...] > There was also a kind of background theme in his earlier work, the pastoral > pictures of beautiful Russian nature, which the poet had all the better > reason to enjoy for being a devout fisherman. Autograph by Apollon Maikov of his poem \\"Pustinnik\\" (Hermit) The modernist critic Yuly Aykhenvald, analyzing the clich√© formula that bonded \\"Maykov, Polonsky and Fet\\" into a solid group of similar-minded authors, alleged that Maykov \\"to a lesser extent than the other two freed himself from the habit of copying classics\\" and \\"in his earlier works was unoriginal, producing verse that shone with reflected light.\\" Not even his passionate love for classics could help the author submerge \\"wholly into the pagan element,\\" the critic opined. > He was a scholar of antiquity and his gift, self-admittedly \\"has been > strengthened by being tempered in the fire of science.\\" As a purveyor of > classicism, his very soul was not deep or naive enough to fully let this > spirit in or embrace the antique idea of intellectual freedom. Poems, > inhabited by naiads, nymphs, muses and dryads, are very pretty, and you > can't help being enchanted by these ancient fables. But he gives you no > chance to forget for a moment that ‚Äì what for his ancient heroes was life > itself, for him is only a myth, a 'clever lie' he could never believe > himself. All Maykov's strong points, according to the critic, relate to the fact that he learned painting, and, in a way, extended the art into his poetry. Aykhenvald gives him unreserved credit for the \\"plasticity of language, the unequalled turn at working on a phrase as if it was a tangible material.\\" Occasionally \\"his lines are so interweaved, the verse looks like a poetic calligraphy; a scripturam continuam... Rarely passionate and showing only distant echoes of original inspiration, Maykov's verse strikes you with divine shapeliness... Maykov's best poems resemble statues, driven to perfection with great precision and so flawless as to make a reader feel slightly guilty for their own imperfection, making them inadequate to even behold what's infinitely finer than themselves,\\" the critic argued. Another Silver Age critic who noticed how painting and fishing might have influenced Maykov's poetry was Innokenty Annensky. In his 1898 essay on Maykov he wrote: \\"A poet usually chooses their own, particular method of communicating with nature, and often it is sports. Poets of the future might be cyclists or aeronauts. Byron was a swimmer, Goethe a skater, Lermontov a horse rider, and many other of our poets (Turgenev, both Tolstoys, Nekrasov, Fet, Yazykov) were hunters. Maykov was a passionate fisherman and this occupation was in perfect harmony with his contemplative nature, with his love for a fair sunny day which has such a vivid expression in his poetry.\\" Putting Maykov into the \\"masters of meditation\\" category alongside Ivan Krylov and Ivan Goncharov, Annensky continued: \\"He was one of those rare harmonic characters for whom seeking beauty and working upon its embodiments was something natural and easy, nature itself filling their souls with its beauty. Such people, rational and contemplative, have no need for stimulus, praise, strife, even fresh impressions... their artistic imagery growing as if from soil. Such contemplative poets produce ideas that are clear-cut and 'coined', their images are sculpture-like,\\" the critic argued. Annensky praised Maykov's gift for creating unusual combinations of colors, which was \\"totally absent in Pushkin's verse, to some extent known to Lermontov, 'a poet of mountains and clouds' ...and best represented by the French poets Baudelaire and Verlaine.\\" \\"What strikes one is Maykov's poetry's extraordinary vigor, the freshness and firmness of the author's talent: Olympians and the heroes of Antiquity whom he befriended during his childhood years‚Ä¶ must have shared with him their eternal youth,\\" Annensky wrote. Maykov in 1868 D. S. Mirsky called Maykov \\"the most representative poet of the age,\\" but added: \\"Maykov was mildly 'poetical' and mildly realistic; mildly tendentious, and never emotional. Images are always the principal thing in his poems. Some of them (always subject to the restriction that he had no style and no diction) are happy discoveries, like the short and very well known poems on spring and rain. But his more realistic poems are spoiled by sentimentality, and his more 'poetic' poems hopelessly inadequate ‚Äî their beauty is mere mid-Victorian tinsel. Few of his more ambitious attempts are successful.\\"D.S. Mirsky, A History of Russian Literature: From Its Beginnings to 1900, Northwestern University Press: 1999, pp. 230‚Äì31 By the mid-1850s Maykov had acquired the reputation of a typical proponent of the \\"pure poetry\\" doctrine, although his position was special. Yet, according to Pryima, \\"Maykov was devoid of snobbishness and never saw himself occupying some loftier position even when mentioning 'crowds'. His need in communicating with people is always obvious (\\"Summer Rain\\", \\"Haymaking\\", \\"Nights of Mowing\\", The Naples Album). It's just that he failed to realize his potential as a 'people's poet' to the full.\\" \\"Maykov couldn't be seen as equal to giants like Pushkin, Lermontov, Koltsov, or Nekrasov,\\" but still \\"occupies a highly important place in the history of Russian poetry\\" which he greatly enriched, the critic insisted. In the years of Maykov's debut, according to Pryima, \\"Russian poetry was still in its infancy... so even as an enlightener, Maykov with his encyclopedic knowledge of history and the way of approaching every new theme as a field for scientific research played an unparalleled role in the Russian literature of the time.\\" \\"His spectacular forays into the 'anthological' genre, as well as his translations of classics formed a kind of \\"antique Gulf Stream\\" which warmed up the whole of Russian literature, speeding its development,\\" another researcher, F. F. Zelinsky, agreed. Maykov's best poems (\\"To a Young Lady\\", \\"Haymaking\\", \\"Fishing\\", \\"The Wanderer\\"), as well his as translations of the Slavic and Western poets and his poetic rendition of Slovo o Polku Igoreve, belong to the Russian poetry classics, according to Pryima.

It was part of the Epic Cycle, which told the entire history of the Trojan War in epic hexameter verse. The story of the Cypria comes chronologically at the beginning of the Epic Cycle, and is followed by that of the Iliad; the composition of the two was apparently in the reverse order. The poem comprised eleven books of verse in epic dactylic hexameters. Date and authorship The Cypria, in the written form in which it was known in classical Greece, was probably composed in the late seventh century BC,\\"An indication that at least the main contents of the Cypria were known around 650 BC is provided by the representation of the Judgement of Paris on the Chigi vase\\" (Burkert 1992:103). On the proto-Attic pitcher of ca. 640 BC called the Chigi \\"vase\\", Paris is identified as Al[exand]ros, as he was apparently called in Cypria. but there is much uncertainty. The Cyclic Poets, as the translator of Homerica, Hugh G. Evelyn- White notedIn his Preface to Hesiod, The Homeric Hymns, and Homerica \\"were careful not to trespass upon ground already occupied by Homer,\\" one of the reasons for dating the final, literary form of Cypria as post-Homeric, in effect a \\"prequel\\". \\"The author of the Kypria already regarded the Iliad as a text. Any reading of the Kypria will show it preparing for events for (specifically) the Iliad in order to refer back to them, for instance the sale of Lykaon to Lemnos or the kitting out of Achilles with Briseis and Agamemnon with Chryseis\\".Ken Dowden, \\"Homer's Sense of Text\\" The Journal of Hellenic Studies 116 (1996, pp. 47-61). p 48, noting that the observation had been made by Eric Bethe, in Homer: Dichtung und Sage II: Odysee, Kyklos, Zeitbestimmung, 1922:202. A comparison can be made with the Aethiopis, also lost, but which even in its quoted fragments is more independent of the Iliad as text. The stories contained in the Cypria, on the other hand, were fixedW. Kullmann's term Faktkanon, the \\"canon of facts\\" is useful in distinguishing fixed narrative content‚Äî the list and sequence of facts‚Äî from fixed, canonic texts. much earlier than that, and the same problems of dating oral traditions associated with the Homeric epics also apply to the Cypria. Many or all of the stories in the Cypria were known to the composer(s) of the Iliad and Odyssey. The Cypria, in presupposing an acquaintance with the events of the Homeric poem, in the received view thus formed a kind of introduction to the IliadEncyclop√¶dia Britannica, 1911: \\"Stasinus\\" though there is an overlap in events from the death of Palamedes, including the catalogue of Trojan allies. J. Marks observes that \\"Indeed, the junction would be seamless if the Kypria simply ended with the death of Palamedes.\\" The title Cypria, associating the epic with Cyprus,Burkert, (Burkert 1992:103) noting Mesopotamian parallels, concludes \\"these observations must then point to that epoch when Cyprus, though rich and powerful, was still formally under Assyrian domination\\". demanded some explanation: the epic was said in one ancient traditionRecorded in John Tzetzes' Chiliades xiii.638. to have been given by Homer as a dowry to his son-in-law, a Stasinus of Cyprus mentioned in no other context; there was apparently an allusion to this in a lost Nemean ode by Pindar. Some later writers repeated the story. It did at least serve to explain why the Cypria was attributed by some to Homer and by others to Stasinus. Others, however, ascribed the poem to Hegesias (or Hegesinus) of Salamis in Cyprus or to Cyprias of Halicarnassus (see Cyclic Poets). It is possible that the \\"Trojan Battle Order\\" (the list of Trojans and their allies, of Iliad 2.816-876, which forms an appendix to the Catalogue of Ships) is abridged from that in the Cypria, which was known to contain in its final book a list of the Trojan allies. Manuscript tradition In current critical editions only about fifty lines survive of the Cypria's original text, quoted by others. For the content we are almost entirely dependent on a prose summary of the Cyclic epics contained in the Chrestomathy attributed to an unknown \\"Proclus\\" (possibly to be identified with the 2nd-century AD grammarian Eutychius Proclus, or else with an otherwise unknown 5th-century grammarian).The Chrestomathy itself was preserved in the ninth-century Patriarch Photios' renowned Bibliotheca or Myriobiblon, codex 239. Many other passing references give further minor indications of the poem's storyline. Content What follows embeds reports of known content of the Cypria in a retelling of the known events leading up to the anger of Achilles. The poem narrates the origins of the Trojan War and its first events. It begins with the decision of Zeus to relieve the Earth of the burden of population through war, a decision with familiar Mesopotamian parallels.Burkert 1992: 101-04. Compare Atra-Hasis. The war of the Seven against Thebes ensues. The Cypria described the wedding of Peleus and Thetis; in the Judgement of ParisParis is called Alexandros in quotations of Cypria and in the surviving synopsis. among the goddesses Athena, Hera, and Aphrodite: Paris awards the prize for beauty to Aphrodite, and as a prize is awarded Helen, wife of Menelaus. Then Paris builds his ships at Aphrodite's suggestion, and Helenus foretells the future to him, and Aphrodite orders Aeneas to sail with him, while Cassandra prophesies the outcome. In Lacedaemon the Trojans are entertained by the sons of Tyndareus, Castor and Polydeuces, and by Menelaus, who then sets sail for Crete, ordering Helen\\"In the Cypria, Nemesis was Helen's mother, born after Zeus raped the goddess, who had done her best to escape him.\\" to furnish the guests with all they require. Aphrodite brings Helen and Paris together, and he takes her and her dowry back to his home of Troy with an episode at Sidon, which Paris and his men successfully storm. In the meantime Castor and Polydeuces, while stealing the cattle of Idas and Lynceus, are caught and killed: Zeus gives them immortality that they share every other day. Iris informs Menelaus, who returns to plan an expedition against Ilium with his brother Agamemnon. They set out to assemble the former suitors of Helen, who had sworn an oath to defend the rights of whichever one won her hand. Nestor in a digression tells Menelaus how Epopeus was destroyed after seducing the daughter of Lycus, the story of Oedipus, the madness of Heracles, and the story of Theseus and Ariadne. In gathering the leaders, they detect Odysseus' feigned madness. The assembled leaders offer ill-omened sacrifice at Aulis, where the prophet Calchas warns the Greeks that the war will last ten years. They reach the city of Teuthras in Mysia and sack it in error for Ilium: Telephus comes to the city's rescue and is wounded by Achilles. The fleet scattered by storm, Achilles puts in at Skyros and marries Deidameia, the daughter of Lycomedes, then heals Telephus, so that he might be their guide to Ilium. When the Achaeans have been mustered a second time at Aulis, Agamemnon is persuaded by Calchas to sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia to appease the goddess Artemis and obtain safe passage for the ships, after he offends her by killing a stag. Iphigeneia is fetched as though for marriage with Achilles. Artemis, however, snatches her away, substituting a deer on the altar, and transports her to the land of the Tauri, making her immortal. Next they sail as far as Tenedos, where while they are feasting, Philoctetes is bitten by a snake and is left behind in Lemnos. Here, too, Achilles quarrels with Agamemnon. A first landing at the Troad is repulsed by the Trojans, and Protesilaus is killed by Hector. Achilles then kills Cycnus, the son of Poseidon, and drives the Trojans back. The Greeks take up their dead and send envoys to the Trojans demanding the surrender of Helen and the treasure. The Trojans refusing, they first attempt an assault upon the city, and then lay waste the country round about. Achilles desires to see Helen, and Aphrodite and Thetis contrive a meeting between them. The Achaeans next desire to return home, but are restrained by Achilles, who afterwards drives off the cattle of Aeneas, sacks neighbouring cities, and kills Troilus. Patroclus carries away Lycaon to Lemnos and sells him as a slave, and out of the spoils Achilles receives Briseis as a prize, and Agamemnon Chryseis. Then follow the death of Palamedes, the plan of Zeus to relieve the Trojans by detaching Achilles from the Hellenic confederacy, and a catalogue of the Trojan allies. Reception The Cypria was considered to be a lesser work than Homer's two masterpieces: Aristotle criticised it for its lack of narrative cohesion and focus. It was rather a catalogue of events than a unified story. Editions * Online editions (English translation): ** Fragments of the Cypria translated by H.G.

He was also a member of the Roman Curia and held several other positions prior to his elevation to the cardinalate and patriarchate. La Fontaine remained a simple pastor at heart and was known for his gentleness and his welcoming nature as both a bishop and patriarch. He was supportive of some aspects of fascism but came to oppose it when he saw it was becoming a totalitarian regime. La Fontaine was viewed as \\"papabile\\" in the 1922 papal conclave that elected Pope Pius XI and was a serious contender for the papal see, having garnered a great deal of votes until Cardinal Ratti's selection on the fourteenth ballot. His cause of canonization commenced over three decades after his death and he has been titled as a Servant of God. Life =Priesthood and positions= Pietro La Fontaine was born in 1860 in Viterbo as the second of five sons to Francesco La Fontaine and Maria Bianchini. His father was from Geneva in origins and had been a soldier in the papal guard turned watchmaker while his mother was the daughter of Giuseppe Bianchini who served as the administrator general of the properties of the Doria-Pamphili- Landi. His initial education was spent under both the Brothers of the Christian Schools and later the Jesuits before he set himself on the ecclesial path. He began studies for the priesthood in Viterbo in 1874 and was ordained as a priest on 22 December 1883 in the Viterbo Cathedral. He served as a parish priest until he was made a professor of literature and Sacred Scripture from 1882 to 1905, and also served as a spiritual director from 1893 until his appointment as a rector in 1896. In 1906 he served briefly as the cathedral canon and as a chaplain at the Gradi jail. Pope Pius X appointed him as the Bishop of Cassano all'Jonio and he received his episcopal consecration on 23 December 1906 in Rome at the Collegio Capranica chapel from Pietro Respighi with Antonio Maria Grasselli and Raffaele Virili serving as the co- consecrators. On 28 December 1908 an earthquake that had struck Messina and surrounding cities saw him open the doors to the episcopal palace for people to find refuge. He aided the displaced and the wounded and tended to orphaned children. =Episcopate= In 1908 La Fontaine was appointed as the vicar for the Basilica of Saint John Lateran and in 1909 was appointed as the Apostolic Administrator of San Marco e Brisignano, to oversee the diocese until a replacement bishop was found. He was appointed as the Titular Bishop of Caristo on 1 April 1910, and the same year was called to lead the Congregation of Rites but never held the title \\"Prefect\\" since the pope then held that traditional title. He served as a consulter in a papal commission for the codification of the code of canon law. On 2 April 1910 Pius X named La Fontaine as the vicar for Saint Peter's Basilica, where he would participate in the pope's liturgical reform with a particular focus on the reform of breviaries. During World War I he refused to leave his archdiocese even during times of aerial bombardment. In November 1917 came eight hours of bombing which proved to be the fiercest night of Austrian-led attacks. He spent the entire night begging for relief from the Mother of God and vowed he would build a temple in her honor if Venice was spared from further bombings. =Cardinalate= In 1915 he was appointed and installed as the Patriarch of Venice. Pope Benedict XV elevated him to the cardinalate on 4 December 1916 as the Cardinal-Priest of Santi Nereo ed Achilleo; he received the red hat and title on 7 December. La Fontaine's title was later changed to Cardinal-Priest of Ss. XII Apostoli on 7 March 1921. Papabile La Fontaine participated in the papal conclave of 1922 that elected Pope Pius XI, and was himself viewed as \\"papabile\\" for his pastoral qualities. The German cardinals met just after the conclave opened before retiring for the evening, after having deliberated and settling on voting for La Fontaine as their second choice if Pietro Gasparri withdrew his candidature. In the first two ballots he received four votes and had been perceived as both a conservative and compromise candidate; but it became clear that he was no compromise but rather a serious contender. He received nine votes in a later ballot with the sudden shift being seen as Willem Marinus van Rossum lost his four votes to the patriarch. La Fontaine secured seven votes in a later ballot before Cardinal del Val urged his supporters to follow La Fontaine; it led to him securing 13 votes at the fifth ballot. The patriarch secured 22 votes in the seventh ballot though dropped to 21 votes in the eighth due to a cardinal switching his vote to the Archbishop of Milan Achille Ratti who was emerging as a possible candidate. He secured 18 votes on the ninth ballot on 5 February but dropped to eight in the tenth. He secured 23 votes in the ballot afterward and then 22 in the final ballot before dinner. The cardinal secured 18 votes in the 13th ballot but it was Achille Ratti who was elected as Pope Pius XI. He served as a member of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches and as a papal legate to the centennial celebrations of Dante Alighieri in Ravenna on 13 September 1921. He was also the papal legate to the Eucharistic Congress in Chioggia on 15 September 1923 as well as to the Regional Eucharistic Congress in Ancona (1927) and the National Eucharistic Congress in Vienna (30 August 1933). On 22 April 1924 he was granted the Constantinian Order of Saint George. He was frugal in his outlook and before he died sold his gondola, hoping the funds collected would be used for the poor, while eschewing heating in the patriarchal palace during the cold winter months. La Fontaine had supported some aspects of fascism at its outset though he came to oppose it when he saw that it was changing the Italian nation into a totalitarian regime that was encroaching on Church rights and the rights of people. =Death= La Fontaine died on 9 July 1935 at 10:00am from arteriosclerosis. He had been ill since the beginning of that month and had moved to Treviso hoping to recover. He had suffered from diabetes in his later life. Four archbishops and 12 bishops as well as some regional senators attended his 12 July funeral which ended with him being interred in Lido in a chapel he had commissioned himself. His remains were transferred on 8 July 1959 into the Basilica of Saint Mark in the sarcophagus that was once intended for his future successor Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli, who had become Pope John XXIII. Beatification process The cause for his beatification was opened on 22 February 1960 (in a local investigation) under his third successor Giovanni Urbani. Theologians assessed his writings and approved them on 10 November 1971 after asserting his writings were in line with doctrine and contained no errors that would impede the beatification process. The informative process of investigation received validation from the Congregation for the Causes of Saints on 11 March 1988. The current postulator for this cause is Dr. Andrea Ambrosi.

Rosher, A.S.C. (November 17, 1885 ‚Äì January 15, 1974) was a two- time Academy Award-winning cinematographer who worked from the early days of silent films through the 1950s. He was the first cinematographer to receive an Academy Award, along with 1929 co-winner Karl Struss. Biography Rosher with Mary Pickford (1921) Charles Rosher was born in London in 1885. He studied photography in his youth but earned a reputation early as a newsreel cameraman, then moved to the United States in 1909. He subsequently found work for David Horsley working in his production company in New Jersey. Because early film was largely restricted to using daylight, Horsley relocated his production company to Hollywood in 1911, taking Rosher with him, and opened the first movie studio there. This made Rosher the first full-time cameraman in Hollywood. In 1913 he went to Mexico to film newsreel footage of Pancho Villa's rebellion. In 1918, he was one of the founders of the American Society of Cinematographers and served as the group's first Vice-President. In the 1920s, he was one of the more sought-after cinematographers in Hollywood, and a personal favorite of stars such as Mary Pickford, working with her on films such as Suds (1920), Little Annie Rooney (1925), and even Coquette (1929), Pickford's first sound film. His work with Karl Struss on F.W. Murnau's 1927 film Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans is viewed as a milestone in cinematography. He shot five films for producer David O. Selznick, including Rockabye (1932), Our Betters (1933) and Little Lord Fauntleroy (1936). Rosher worked at several studios, but spent the last 12 years of his career exclusively at Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer, photographing such films as Annie Get Your Gun, Show Boat, Kiss Me Kate, and The Yearling. http://www.filmreference.com/Writers-and- Production-Artists-Po-Ro/Rosher-Charles.html Rosher was the father of actress Joan Marsh and cinematographer Charles Rosher, Jr. Death Rosher died of an accidental fall in Lisbon, Portugal on January 15, 1974.

It may also be known as a hemostatic (also spelled h√¶mostatic) agent. A styptic (also spelled stiptic) is a specific type of antihemorrhagic agent that works by contracting tissue to seal injured blood vessels. Styptics are also referred to as local hemostatics. Styptic pencils contain astringents. Antihemorrhagic agents used in medicine have various mechanisms of action: * Systemic drugs work by inhibiting fibrinolysis or promoting coagulation. * locally acting hemostatic agents work by causing vasoconstriction or promoting platelet aggregation.  Medical uses  Hemostatic agents are used during surgical procedures to achieve hemostasis and are categorized as hemostats, sealants and adhesives. They vary based on their mechanism of action, composition, ease of application, adherence to tissue, immunogenicity and cost. These agents permit rapid hemostasis, better visualization of the surgical area, shorter operative times, decreased requirement for transfusions, decreased wound healing time and overall improvement in patient recovery time.  Types  = Systemic = There are several classes of antihemorrhagic drugs used in medicine. These include antifibrinolytics, blood coagulation factors, fibrinogen, and vitamin K. = Local = Topical hemostatic agents have been gaining popularity for use in emergency bleeding control, especially in military medicine. They are available in two forms‚Äîas a granular powder poured on wounds, or embedded in a dressing. = Organic =  Microfibrillar collagen  Microfibrillar collagen hemostat (MCH) is a topical agent composed of resorbable microfibrillar collagen. It attracts platelets and allows for the formation of a blood clot when it comes into contact with blood. Unlike the hemostatic clamp, no mechanical action is involved. The surgeon presses the MCH against a bleeding site, and the collagen attracts and helps with the clotting process to eventually stop bleeding. The practical application for MCH is different from that of the hemostatic clamp.  Chitosan  Chitosan hemostats are topical agents composed of chitosan and its salts. Chitosan bonds with platelets and red blood cells to form a gel-like clot which seals a bleeding vessel. Unlike other hemostat technologies its action does not require the normal hemostatic pathway and therefore continues to function even when anticoagulants like heparin are present. Chitosan is used in some emergency hemostats which are designed to stop traumatic life-threatening bleeding. Their use is well established in many military and trauma units. = Inorganic = Kaolin and zeolite activate the coagulation cascade, and have been used as the active component of hemostatic dressings (for example, in QuikClot).  Styptics  Styptic pencil Alum block and razor Styptics cause hemostasis by contracting blood vessels. A common delivery system for this is a styptic or hemostatic pencil (not to be confused with a caustic pencil). This is a short stick of medication. Anhydrous aluminium sulfate is the main ingredient and acts as a vasoconstrictor in order to disable blood flow. The stick is applied directly to the bleeding site. The high ionic strength promotes flocculation of the blood, and the astringent chemical causes local vasoconstriction. Before safety razors were invented, it was a standard part of a shaving kit and was used to seal shaving cuts. Some people continue to use styptic pencils for minor skin wounds from safety or electric razors.

She co-founded Cisco Systems, and used the money from its sale to pursue interests in animal welfare and women's writing. One of her main projects, Chawton House, is in England, but most of her work remains in the United States. Early life and education Lerner is a northern California native. She received her bachelor's degree in 1975 in international relations from California State University, Chico, a master's degree in econometrics in 1977 from the Claremont Graduate School, and a master's degree in statistics and computer science in 1981 from Stanford University. Cisco In 1984, while working as director of computer facilities for the Stanford University Graduate School of Business, Lerner co-founded Cisco Systems with her then- partner and now-former husband Len Bosack. Lerner and Bosack worked with Stanford students and faculty on a project to better connect all of the school's computer systems. They later adapted software used at Stanford into what would become the foundation for Cisco IOS. Lerner told the story of Cisco's startup on the podcast How I Built This in which Cisco's early days involved building routers in the living room, financing the business using credit cards. She emphasized the collaborative nature of the work and that despite communication protocols being public domain, developed largely from collaborative work at Stanford, Cisco was still able to produce products people wanted to buy.Guy Raz - How I Made This \\"Cisco Systems & Urban Decay: Sandy Lerner\\". NPR. Accessed October 15, 2018 Lerner and Bosack brought in John Morgridge to be the third CEO of Cisco in 1988. On August 28, 1990, Lerner was fired; upon hearing the news, Bosack resigned in solidarity. The two sold all of their stock for $170 million and retired from Cisco. Lerner and Bosack divorced in the early 1990s. Other business projects In 1996, Lerner purchased Ayrshire Farm, an estate in Upperville Virginia. The circa-1912, 42-room Edwardian mansion of native fieldstone has since been restored and was used for a variety of social functions under Lerner's direction. Ayrshire Farm's mission has been to farm sustainably and profitably, promoting the benefits of locally produced, humanely-raised meats and organic produce to the consumer, the community, and children through education, outreach and example. The farm was the first in Virginia to meet both Certified Humane and Certified Organic standards. Lerner placed a portion of her stock earnings into a start-up venture capital limited partnership called \\"& Capital Partners.\\" One of the companies it funded was Urban Decay Cosmetics, with the tag line \\"does pink make you puke?\\"\\"Urban Decay history\\" In February 2000, Moet-Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH), the French luxury goods conglomerate, acquired the firm. It was spun off from LVMH in December 2002. Lerner also owns Hunter's Head Tavern in Upperville, Virginia and Gentle Harvest in Marshall, Virginia. Artistic projects and philanthropy In 1992, through the foundation she shares with Leonard Bosack, Lerner invested money into the restoration of the Chawton House, which was once owned by Jane Austen's brother, Edward Austen Knight. In 2003, it opened as the Centre for the Study of Early Women's Writing, 1600‚Äì1830. In 2016, Lerner resigned from the board of trustees and withdrew the financial support of her foundation.

Being formed from the word \\"brother\\", it often indicates that someone is a \\"little brother\\". Etymology and history The linguist Ian Hancock has described similarities between the African Krio language and Gullah, the creole language of blacks in the isolated Sea Islands of South Carolina, and points out that the Krio expression ('boy') appears in Gullah as , which may account for the \\"Bubba\\" of the American South. Robert Ferguson notes in his book English Surnames that \\"Bubba\\" corresponds with the German , \\"boy\\". This matches Saxon and Hibernian tradition. Because of its association with the southern part of the United States, \\"Bubba\\" is also often used outside the South as a pejorative to mean a person of low economic status and limited education. \\"Bubba\\" may also be taken to mean one who is a \\"good ol' boy\\". At times, it may be used as a term of endearment (or in an insulting sense) for a person, especially to a man, who is either overweight or has a seemingly powerful large body frame. Other uses In the US Army and Marines, \\"Bubba\\" can mean a lay soldier, similar to \\"grunt\\", but with connotations of endearment instead of derision (e.g., \\"Can you make that device easier to work with, because every Bubba is going to have to use it?\\"). The word exists in other languages and carries similar meanings. \\"Bubba\\" is common in Australia and New Zealand as a noun to refer affectionately to a baby. In gun culture, \\"Bubba\\" is a term used for a person who permanently alters or modifies historic firearms, with no regard for its historical value, or as a verb or adjective to describe the act of or an already modified historical firearm. In Yiddish, the word Bobe [with a vowel similar to a shortened version of the vowel of caught + beh] means \\"grandmother\\" and as a form of address, is often rendered by English speakers as \\"Bubba\\" or \\"Bubbie\\".

Canyon homes and that famous ZIP code.\\" Los Angeles Times, 11 July 2004. In the 1920s, the federal government decided to have the Beverly Hills post office serve the area now known as BHPO, which was then a rural area, much of it part of Doheny Ranch. By the 1940s people bought BHPO homes because they were less expensive than in Beverly Hills, despite higher property taxes. In 1963, the area was included within the 90210 ZIP Code, which also covers the northern part of Beverly Hills. 1978 California Proposition 13 equalized property taxes, making BHPO more attractive. Post Office The ZIP Code 90210 is still handled by the Beverly Hills Main Post Office. The original Beverly Hills Main Post Office from 1934 to the 1990s still sits at 469 North Crescent Drive in the Beverly Hills Civic Center, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Includes National Register of Historic Places Inventory - Nomination Form as attachment. In 1990, 325 North Maple Street was rebuilt as the new Beverly Hills Main Post Office; the old Main on Crescent Drive was closed in 1999 when the building was sold back to the City of Beverly Hills. Beverly Hills has other Post Offices in other ZIP Codes as well. City services BHPO residents do not have access to Beverly Hills Police Department or fire services.

The dam's purpose includes flood mitigation, irrigation, water supply and hydro-electric power generation. The dam impounds Lake Burrendong and is filled by the waters from the Macquarie, and Cudgegong rivers as well as Meroo Creek.  History  The idea of building the dam arose in 1909. However, it was not until 1946 until legislation was passed to construct the dam. Construction commenced in 1950. The town of Mumbil expanded to accommodate the workers building the dam. The dam was completed in April 1965 and water began to flow into it for the first time. It was officially opened on 18 August 1967 by Robert Askin, the Premier of New South Wales. The date was chosen because it was the sesquicentenary of the town of Wellington. In September 1969 the dam was nearly full for the first time. The village of Burrendong, once a gold-mining area, was flooded by the construction of the dam. Location and features The Burrendong Dam is a major dam on the Macquarie River within the Macquarie Valley, approximately southeast of Wellington. The dam was built by the New South Wales Water Conservation & Irrigation Commission for the purposes of providing flood mitigation, irrigation, and water supply. The dam wall height is and is long. The water depth is and at 100% capacity the water level is AHD. The surface area of the dam is and the catchment area of the dam is . At 100%, Burrendong Dam has a capacity of . Additionally, the dam has a further flood mitigation capacity of . The spillway on the dam is a gated concrete chute with a release capacity of . Burrendong Dam has three times been recorded at a critically low level of 1.5% in drought. Contrastingly, however, Burrendong has mitigated potentially devastating floods downstream by using its flood capacity and releasing water in accordance with downstream tributary flows, safely reaching 160% of capacity in 1990 and 152.8% in 2010. In January 2020, the lake was again reported to be at 1.6% level. The 32 million first phase of a major upgrade began in 2010 and is expected to be completed during 2015. This project will bring the dam up to modern safety standards including the raising of the main dam wall and saddle dam by as well as modifications to the existing spillway, complemented by construction of an auxiliary spillway and fuse plug. =Power generation= A hydro-electric power station generates up to of electricity from the flow of the water leaving Burrendong Dam. The average output is per annum. The station was completed in August 1996 and was officially opened on 9 February 1999 by the Premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr. At the time, the facility was operated by Power Facilities Pty Limited; and is now managed by AGL Energy.

Throughout Chinese history, the siheyuan composition was the basic pattern used for residences, palaces, temples, monasteries, family businesses, and government offices. In ancient times, a spacious siheyuan would be occupied by a single, usually large and extended family, signifying wealth and prosperity. Today, remaining siheyuan are often still used as subdivided housing complexes, although many lack modern amenities. Names Siheyuan refers to a courtyard surrounded by buildings on all four sides. It also appears in English translation as and, less often, as .  History  Siheyuan dates back as early as the Western Zhou period, and has a history of over 2,000 years. They exhibit outstanding and fundamental characteristics of Chinese architecture. They exist all across China and are the template for most Chinese architectural styles. Siheyuan also serves as a cultural symbol of Beijing and a window into its old ways of life. Modern Beijing's population boom has made housing one of city's biggest challenges. Siheyuan today are typically used as housing complexes, hosting multiple families, with courtyards being developed to provide extra living space. The living conditions in many siheyuan are quite poor, with very few having private toilets. In the 1990s, systematic demolition of old urban buildings took place in Beijing under rapid economic development. Many siheyuan are being torn down to address the problem of overcrowding, and have been replaced by modern apartment blocks.

Many of these are public museums, and preserved historical siheyuans include Lu Xun Memorial, Guo Moruo Memorial, Mao Dun Memorial, Mei Lanfang Memorial, Lao She Memorial and many others. A study by the United Nations Human Settlements Programme in 2008 estimates that there are still about 400,000 residential courtyards remaining in Beijing. The sales market of siheyuan has also been booming in recent years. A report in 2005 finds there are usually around 7,000 to 9,000 residential siheyuans that are on the market for sale, and many are generally priced at 7,000 to 10,000 yuan per square meter. However, the prices vary based on the area and the market. For residential siheyuans in the Dongcheng and Xicheng districts in 2009, the prices can go up to 40,000 yuan per square meter. For siheyuans near the Houhai and Shichahai area, the prices can go up to between 100,000 and 150,000 yuan per square meter. A 2,000 square meter siheyuan near the Shichahai area was sold for 40 million yuan ($6 million) in 2005. Layout of Beijing siheyuan The four buildings of a siheyuan are normally positioned along the north-south and east-west axis. The building positioned to the north and facing the south is considered the main house (Ê≠£Êàø zh√®ng-f√°ng). The buildings adjoining the main house and facing east and west are called side houses (ÂªÇÊàø xiƒÅng-f√°ng). The northern, eastern and western buildings are connected by beautifully decorated pathways (ÊäÑÊâãÊ∏∏Âªä chƒÅo-sh«íu-y√≥u- l√°ng). These passages serve as shelters from the sunshine during the day, and provide a cool place to appreciate the view of the courtyard at night. The building that faces north is known as the opposite house (ÂÄíÂ∫ßÊàø d√†o-zu√≤-f√°ng). Behind the northern building, there would often be a separate backside building (ÂêéÁΩ©Êàø h√≤u-zh√†o-f√°ng), the only place where two-story buildings are allowed to be constructed for the traditional siheyuan. The entrance gate, usually painted vermilion and with copper door knockers on it, is usually at the southeastern corner. Normally, there is a screen wall () inside the gate, for privacy; superstition holds that it also protects the house from evil spirits. A pair of stone lions are often placed outside the gate. Some large siheyuan compounds would have two or more layers of courtyards and even private gardens attached to them. Such is a sign of wealth and status in ancient times. The courtyard dwellings were built according to the traditional concepts of the five elements that were believed to compose the universe, and the eight diagrams of divination. The gate was made at the southeast corner which was the ‚Äúwind‚Äù corner, and the main house was built on the north side which was believed to belong to ‚Äúwater‚Äù, an element to prevent fire. The layout of a simple courtyard represents traditional Chinese morality and Confucian ethics. In Beijing, four buildings in a single courtyard receive different amounts of sunlight. The northern main building receives the most, thus serving as the living room and bedroom of the owner or head of the family. The eastern and western side buildings receive less, and serve as the rooms for children or less important members of the family. The southern building receives the least sunlight, and usually functions as a reception room and the servants' dwelling, or where the family would gather to relax, eat or study. The backside building is for unmarried daughters and female servants: because unmarried girls were not allowed direct exposure to the public, they occupied the most secluded building in the siheyuan. A more detailed and further stratified Confucian order was followed in ancient China. The main house in the north was assigned to the eldest member of the family, i.e. the head of the family, usually grandparents. If the main house had enough rooms, a central room would serve as a shrine for ancestral worship. When the head of the household had concubines, the wife would reside in the room to the eastern end of the main house, while the concubines would reside in the room to the western end of the main house. The eldest son of the family and his wife would reside in the eastern side house, while the younger son and his wife would reside in the western side house. If a grandson was fully grown, he would reside in the opposite house in the south. Unmarried daughters would always reside in the backside building behind the main house. When a funeral is held in a siheyuan, the location of the casket depends on the status of the deceased, but all caskets are oriented so that the head of the deceased points south while the feet point north. If the deceased is the head of the household or his wife, then the casket would be on the center line in the main house. If the deceased was the concubine of the head of the household, her casket would remain in the main house, but could not be in the center. If the deceased is a younger male, then his casket is placed on the center line of the courtyard. If the deceased is a younger female, her casket is placed in the courtyard but cannot be on the center line. Though from antiquity, a siheyuan is a practically sound, engineered structure. Northwestern walls are usually higher than the other walls to protect the inside buildings from the harsh winds blowing across northern China in the winter. Eaves curve downward, so that rainwater will flow along the curve rather than dropping straight down. The rooftop is ridged to provide shade in the summer while retaining warmth in the winter. A siheyuan offers space, comfort, quiet and privacy. Siheyuan walls provide security as well as protection against dust and storms. With plants, rocks, and flowers, the yard is also a garden, and acts like an open-air living room. The veranda divides the courtyard into several big and small spaces that are not very distant from each other. Family members talked with each other here, creating a cordial atmosphere. A number of Western ex-pats living in pre-WWII Beijing extolled the virtues of the siheyuan for an English-speaking audience. Among them were photographer Hedda Morrison, writer Harold Acton, and chronicler and sinologist George N. Kates. Siheyuan in other areas In Gansu, Qinghai and other northwest regions, where dust storms are very strong, courtyard walls tend to be higher. The shapes of siheyuan are also altered: in northwestern China, the north-south span of a siheyuan is generally much longer than the east-west span, while in other provinces such as Sichuan, the opposite is true. In southern China, the houses are built with multiple stories. In the northeast, land is abundant but the weather is cold, so courtyards are built broad and large to increase the exposure to sunlight, and there are more open areas inside the walls. Neo-siheyuan style Recently, a modern version of siheyuan has been developed as a villa product in large scale planned residential communities of China. These new siheyuan are located in new housing development areas of Beijing. In the historic center of Beijing modern siheyuans have been constructed in the period since 2005 using the courtyard concept and ostensibly many of the features of the traditional Beijing house, but using modern techniques and concrete blocks with 'faux' brick facing instead of the traditional carefully laid wide grey Chinese bricks; plastic coated window frames and beams instead of the traditional wood ones coated in natural wood lacquer.

Composed, arranged and recorded by Paul Giovanni and Magnet, it contains folk songs performed by characters in the film (including some by members of the cast). For example, Lesley Mackie, who plays the character of Daisy in the film, sings the opening song, and various others in the CD Soundtrack. Background & Content The songs were arranged to hint at a pre-Christian pagan European culture and vary between traditional songs, original Giovanni compositions and even nursery rhyme in \\"Baa, Baa, Black Sheep\\". Musicians forming the folk band in the film included Michael Cole (Bassoon and concertina) and Ian Cutler (Violin). This mix of songs contributes to the film's atmosphere, contrasting rabble-rousing songs that depict the island's community like \\"The Landlord's Daughter\\" and the child-sung \\"Maypole\\" with the sinister \\"Fire Leap\\" and the erotic \\"Willow's Song\\" before culminating in the islanders' rendition of the Middle English \\"Sumer Is Icumen In\\". The opening music and \\"Corn Rigs\\" are arrangements of the Robert Burns ballads \\"The Highland Widow's Lament\\" and \\"Rigs O' Barley\\", respectively. The instrumental parts of the score are based on traditional Scottish, Irish, and English tunes such as \\"Miri it is\\" the oldest surviving middle English song fragment, the \\"Struan Robertson's Rant\\" strathspey (plays while Sgt. Howie searches the ship for Rowan), the \\"Tenpenny Bit\\" jig (Plays while Lord Summerisle and MacGregor prepare for the festivities), and \\"Drowsy Maggie\\" reel (plays while Sgt. Howie searches a house for Rowan). \\"Chop Chop\\" is based on the nursery rhyme \\"Oranges and Lemons\\". \\"Procession\\" is an arrangement of the tune of the Child Ballad \\"Fause Foodrage\\".The tune of this song is falsely attributed to Willie o Winsbury since the 60s as stated on this thread on Mudcat. The psychedelic guitar solo which plays while Sgt. Howie is looking for Rowan, on the track \\"Searching for Rowan,\\" is based on the melody of the Jacobite song \\"Hey, Johnnie Cope, are Ye Waking Yet?\\". Although some of the music is Scottish, and the film is set in the Hebrides, no traditional Scottish Gaelic numbers are featured. Release The soundtrack was unavailable until a 1998 release on Trunk Records of a mono album dubbed from the music and effects tapes at Pinewood, from the shorter original cut of the film (hence missing the song \\"Gently Johnny\\"). It was not until 2002 that Silva Screen Records released a stereo version using cues from the tape held by Gary Carpenter, mixed with recordings from the first Trunk Records release. This release includes \\"Gently Johnny\\" and the missing lines from \\"Willow's Song\\". A sheet music album of the soundtrack is also available, published by Summerisle Songs. Titled \\"The Wicker Man Complete Piano Songbook\\" the book features all the songs and music from the film, arranged for piano, voice and guitar. Reception Jason Nickey, reviewing the album for Allmusic picked \\"Gently Johnny\\", \\"Maypole\\" and \\"Willow's Song\\" as highlights. \\"Paul Giovanni, together with Magnet,\\" he writes, \\"uses flutes, lyres, harmonicas, and guitars in a mixture of original and traditional material to create a mysterious and sinister world that comes to life apart from the film.\\" Chris Jones wrote for BBC that just as the \\"cult\\" film \\"has now been rightly placed in the pantheon of great celluloid [...] its soundtrack deserves the same accolades.\\" He notes that the \\"lilting (how come folk is always lilting?) melodies of numbers like Corn Rigs, Gently Johnny and Willow's Song are stuffed with a vaguely sinister eroticism, reflecting Woodward's unease as he scratches the tranquil surface of the island community to discover its sinister secret.\\" \\"Maybe it takes a foreigner to get to the dark heart of much of our indigenous music,\\" he concludes, \\"but it's a darkness suffused with beauty. Coupled to the original incidental music [...] this is a vital document of a time when the UK could still produce classic cinema. It's also a really fine album.\\" TightPurpleShirt reviewed the 1998 version of the album for Head Heritage and called it an \\"incredible soundtrack\\", despite criticizing the exclusion of \\"Gently Johnny\\". He notes that the tracks \\"cover everything from traditional folk music, performed by MAGNET [...] Some very, very surreal sound effect sequences and some mildly psyche [sic] guitar work [.T]here is also a track called Hum which if extended across a whole CD could be marketed by any number of drone groups as their best album to date. The whole things a head fuk [sic] from start to finish and its glorious.\\" Legacy =Influence= In 2013, Spin ranked the soundtrack 11th on their list of \\"40 Movie Soundtracks That Changed Alternative Music\\", writing: \\"The soundtrack from American songwriter Paul Giovanni reveled in the British folk idiom that bands like Pentangle had revitalized, weaving together standards as well as \\"Baa Baa Black Sheep,\\" no doubt influencing freak-folkers like Devendra Banhart and Joanna Newsom. Yet for all its pastoral sounds, there was an uncanny eeriness lurking at the edges, a childlike innocence mixed with malice, anticipating the aesthetics of both Animal Collective and Broadcast.\\" =Covers= Some of the songs (most notably \\"Willow's Song\\") have been covered by contemporary artists, such as the Nature and Organisation, Medi√¶val B√¶bes, Doves, Faith and the Muse, Isobel Campbell and the Sneaker Pimps. =Tributes= A live performance of the soundtrack at the 30th annual Brosella Folk Festival in Brussels, on 8 July 2006, underlined the cult status of the film and its music. The organizers were looking for something to mark three decades of the festival and as such, for the final act of the evening, they assembled \\"The Wicker Band\\". This ensemble included many eminent performers from the thriving Flemish folk-rock scene, as well as the singer Jacqui McShee, founding member and continual reviver of the 1960s folk-jazz band Pentangle, and fellow ex-Pentangle member Danny Thompson. The band performed music from the film, plus a few selected songs from the folk and singer-songwriter repertoire that seemed to fit the mood before, shortly after midnight, the director's cut of the film was shown on a giant screen.

There are two types, bashrings and bashplates. Bashring In cycling, bashrings are a protective ring, often made of aluminium or polycarbonate, mounted on the outer part of the chainrings on mountain bikes. They are commonly used on downhill and freeride bikes to protect the chain and chainring in cases of it hitting rocks and other obstacles. The position of the chainring makes it particularly susceptible to rock strikes in this kind of riding. They are also often used on trials bikes for a similar purpose‚Äìto protect the chain and chainring‚Äìalthough they are often used as a tool to get up and over obstacles. It is for this reason that a lot of bashrings aimed at trials riding have a tooth-like profile. They are also used for landing on a log, so are generally wider than those used for downhill and freeride. Finally, bashrings are used a lot on street bikes, where they are used to protect the chain and chainring when grinding obstacles, and again in the case of a crash. Bashplate A bashplate is a device used most often on Mod-class trials bikes, again to protect the chain and chainring. This device, however, is attached to the frame rather than to the crankset. Being more central on the bike (and generally far wider) means that balancing on this is easier, though the fact that it is not attached to the crankarm means it cannot be used to get up obstacles in the same way as a bashring.

At the 2016 census, Kintore had a population of 410, of which 376 (91.9 per cent) identified themselves as Aboriginal Australians. The Kintore Range was named by William Tietkens during his expedition of 1889 after the Governor of South Australia, Algernon Keith- Falconer, 9th Earl of Kintore. In 1979 and 1980 satisfactory water was found in four bores sunk at and near the Kintore Range. In mid-1981 an outstation (homeland) was established there and developed as a resource centre for camps elsewhere in the region, allowing the reoccupation of at least some of the Pintupi country. The community was founded in 1981, when many Pintupi people who lived in the community of Papunya (about from Alice Springs) became unhappy with their circumstances in what they saw as foreign country, and decided to move back to their own country, from which they had been forcibly removed decades earlier due to weapons testing from Woomera in South Australia, as part of the outstation movement. Kintore is overseen by the MacDonnell Regional Council, which is based in Alice Springs. The community also has a NT Government funded primary school, an independent store trading as Puli Kutjarra (meaning Two Rocks/mountains in Pintupi language), an airstrip, an independent health clinic called Pintupi Homelands Health Service, a women's centre called Ngintaka Women's Centre, haemodialysis at The Purple House run by Western Desert Dialysis, a high school run by Yirara College, and an arts centre run by Papunya Tula Artists Pty. Ltd. The town is in the territory electorate of Namatjira and the federal electorate of Lingiari. Kintore is a major centre for the Western Desert art movement which began at the community of Papunya. These people traditionally passed on significant Dreamtime stories by way of art using sand, rock and local plants. Nowadays such paintings are done on canvas and have gained worldwide popularity. A number of members of the famous Aboriginal art company Papunya Tula live at Kintore, among them the deceased artist Ningura Napurrula. In Pintupi, the majority language of the community, Kintore is known as Wa _l_ ungurru (). Kintore is mentioned in the Midnight Oil song \\"Beds are Burning\\" (from the Diesel and Dust album): \\"Four wheels scare the cockatoos/From Kintore east to Yuendumu\\".

It is the first serial made to feature David Brierley as the voice of K9. The serial is set on the planet Chloris. In the serial, Lady Adrasta (Myra Frances) imprisons the Tythonian ambassador Erato in a pit for fifteen years in order to maintain her control over the planet's limited metal supply. The alien time traveller the Fourth Doctor (Tom Baker) attempts to negotiate peace and a trade agreement with Erato. Plot The use of an MK3 Emergency transceiver on the TARDIS identifies a distress signal and brings the craft to the lush jungle world of Chloris, where metal in all forms is a rare and prized commodity. The Fourth Doctor and Romana venture out to discover the remains of an enormous egg in the jungle, and when they meet the inhabitants they find a matriarchy ruled through fear by the icy and callous Lady Adrasta. Without metal to make the tools needed to keep the jungle under control, lush plant life dominates. The Lady Adrasta controls the planet's very last metal mine, holding on to power through the Huntsman and the Wolfweeds. Her throne room contains an array of metal including a shield patterned in the same way as the remnants of the shell. She mentions the Creature which dwells in a deep pit on Chloris. Romana is captured by a party of scavengers, ever keen to find and hoard more metal, and they are particularly impressed by the possibilities of K9. The robot enables her escape and she is briefly reunited with the Doctor before he leaps into the Pit himself, determined to get to the bottom of the mystery and the Pit. Within the Pit he encounters Organon, an astrologer thrown there by Adrasta some time earlier, and then comes face to face with the Creature: indeed, the vast shapeless blob rolls over him. The Doctor calculates it is not, however, dangerous, and is fascinated to note it is a herbivore which produces metal from within itself. It also forms a tentacle and draws a picture which the Doctor recognises as the shield from Adrasta's throne room. Lady Adrasta, her lady-in-waiting Karela, the Huntsman, his Wolfweeds, and some guards, enter the Pit and make their way to the Doctor, Organon and the Creature. The scavengers have raided the throne room for booty, including the alien shield. It exerts influence over two of them, who take it to the Pit and place it on the Creature. It turns out the shield is a communication device. Erato, as the Creature is named, is the Tythonian ambassador to Chloris and came to negotiate a treaty exchanging metal for chlorophyll fifteen years earlier. Its craft was the vast egg found in the jungle. However, Adrasta realised her power was dependent on control of the planet's metal supply and so imprisoned Erato to maintain her status. The Huntsman sets the Wolfweeds on Adrasta as Erato rolls over them both, devouring the Wolfweeds and leaving behind Adrasta's web-covered corpse. The Doctor arranges to have Erato lifted from the Pit. Adrasta's sidekick, Karela, attempts to capitalise on the situation and seize power herself‚Äîbut with the help of K9 the Doctor brings it to nought. The Doctor has rescued the Tythonian just in time ‚Äì it seems Tythonus has declared war on Chloris over the missing ambassador, and has despatched a neutron star to collide with Chloris‚Äô star and destroy the system. It is due to collide within the next twenty-four hours. Erato weaves a metal covering around the star, enabling the Doctor, using the TARDIS gravity beam, to draw the star off course and neutralise the danger. The Doctor's last act on Chloris is to push the Huntsman, now one of the de facto rulers, toward a mutually beneficial trade agreement with Erato and the Tythonians. Production This was actually the first serial of the season to be filmed. As a result, Lalla Ward's performance and manner of dress as Romana is somewhat different from that seen in the previously broadcast serials, since she was still working out her character at the time. It was also the final story to be directed by Christopher Barry, one of Doctor Who's longest-serving contributors. Although the Doctor's solution to the problem of the neutron star, weaving a shell of aluminium around it, has been criticised as silly, the idea was in fact proposed to David Fisher by members of the Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge. Director Christopher Barry and visual effects designer Mat Irvine were called on the carpet by the BBC management for the appearance of the creature Erato. The phallic appearance of the proboscis in the first episode resulted in uncontrolled laughter in the studio and prompted an overnight change to add a pair of pincers to the creature. At the start of the story K9 is seen reading The Tale of Peter Rabbit to the Doctor. =Cast notes= David Brierley makes his debut as the voice of K9 in this story, taking over from John Leeson. Adrasta's engineer, Tollund, was played by former Doctor Who director Morris Barry. Eileen Way, who played Karela, also played the Old Mother in the first Doctor Who story, An Unearthly Child (1963). Geoffrey Bayldon, who played Organon, would go on to portray an alternate version of the Doctor, one who never left Gallifrey, in the Big Finish Production Auld Mortality. Terry Walsh played Doran in Part One; this was his final appearance in the series having appeared in various roles since 1966 as well as acting as fight arranger and the stunt double for both Jon Pertwee and Tom Baker. Broadcast and reception Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping wrote in The Discontinuity Guide (1995) that the bandits were clich√©d and viewers who enjoyed Douglas Adams' humour would appreciate the serial more. They noted that some have described it as \\"a conscious spoof of bad science fiction. On the other hand, it could just be bad science fiction.\\" In The Television Companion (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker wrote that the setting was fleshed out but failed to develop it. They also criticised the characters, acting, dialogue, and direction, though they praised Geoffrey Bayldon as Organon and Myra Frances as Adrasta. In 2011, Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times criticised the monster, but was positive towards Barry's direction and some of the \\"vivid characters,\\" though he noted the bandits and minor characters were lacking. DVD Talk's John Sinnot gave The Creature from the Pit three and a half out of five stars. He described it as having \\"the right mixture of humor and drama,\\" although the monster let down. While Sinnot praised Baker, he criticised Ward's Romana, who had not yet grown into the role. Cliff Chapman of Den of Geek was also more positive, giving it four out of five stars and highlighting the acting, dialogue, and visual quality aside from the realisation of Erato. Commercial releases =In print= A novelisation of this serial, written by David Fisher, was published by Target Books in January 1981. Fisher amuses himself with lengthy discourses on life on Tythonus complete with a glossary. An audiobook was released by the BBC on 7 April 2008 read by Tom Baker as part of the \\"Doctor Who: Classic Novels\\" range. The audio book was broadcast on BBC Radio 7 in April and May 2010. =Home media= The Creature from the Pit was released on VHS in July 2002. It was released on DVD in May 2010.

Walter Fewkes, 1914 Jesse Walter Fewkes (November 14, 1850 ‚Äì 1930) was an American anthropologist, archaeologist, writer and naturalist. Biography Fewkes was born in Newton, Massachusetts, and initially trained as a zoologist at Harvard University. He later turned to ethnological studies of the native tribes in the American Southwest. In 1889, with the resignation of noted ethnologist Frank Hamilton Cushing, Fewkes became leader of the Hemenway Southwestern Archaeological Expedition, named for its patron Mary Hemenway. While with this project, Fewkes documented the existing lifestyle and rituals of the Zuni and Hopi tribes. Fewkes was the first man to use a phonograph to record indigenous people for study. He tested its use among the Passamaquoddy in Maine, before traveling to the Southwest to make his recordings of the Zuni (1890) and Hopi (1891). Benjamin Ives Gilman used these recordings to show that they used musical intervals unlike those in the Western tempered scale. In addition to the recordings, he wrote historically valuable descriptions of the music and musical practice. J. Walter Fewkes at Mesa Verde cliff dwellings circa 1910 Fewkes surveyed the ruins of a number of cultures in the American Southwest, and wrote many well received articles and books. He supervised the excavation of the Casa Grande ruins in southern Arizona, a Hohokam site, and the Mesa Verde ruins in southern Colorado, an Ancient Pueblo site. He particularly focused on the variants and styles of prehistoric Southwest Indian pottery, producing a number of volumes with carefully drawn illustrations. His work on the Mimbres and Siky√°tki pottery styles eventually led to the reproduction of many of these traditional forms and images. The Hopi potter Nampeyo became his friend and reproduced the newly documented traditional designs in her own work. In study of the Hopi Indians religious rituals and festivities Fewkes compiled descriptions and drawings of the Hopis' Katsinam. He commissioned several Hopi artist, knowledgeable in the Katsina cult and with the least outside influence in art, to produce series of paintings of the Hopis' supernatural beings, the Katsinam. This Codex Hopi, a manuscript of all the known Hopi Katsinam was the first permanent documentation of the ceremonial performers and preserved the existence of the Katsinam that otherwise may have ceased to appear.Pecina, Ron and Pecina, Bob. Hopi Kachinas: History, Legends, and Art. Schiffer Publishing Ltd. 2013; . Pp 26‚Äì29 Fewkes was one of the first voices for government preservation of ancient sites in the American Southwest. By the mid-1890s, vandalism of these sites was widespread. In the American Anthropologist for August 1896, Fewkes described a large cliff dwelling called Palatki, or \\"Red House\\", situated in the Red Rock country southwest of Flagstaff, Arizona, and appealed for protective legislation. > If this destruction of the cliff-houses of New Mexico, Colorado, and Arizona > goes on at the same rate in the next fifty years that it has in the past, > these unique dwellings will be practically destroyed, and unless laws are > enacted, either by states or by the general government, for their > protection, at the close of the twentieth century many of the most > interesting monuments of the prehistoric peoples of our Southwest will be > little more than mounds of debris at the bases of the cliffs.

It would be > wise legislation to prevent this vandalism as much as possible and good > science to put all excavation of ruins in trained hands. His research on precolumbian sites of Puerto Rico, Haiti, Cuba, Trinidad, and the Lesser Antilles were culminated into his 1907 book \\"Aborigines of Porto Rico and Neighboring Islands\\". It's an acclaimed text of early archaeology. Fewkes joined the Smithsonian's Bureau of American Ethnology in 1895, becoming its director in 1918.

His Pali monastic name, 'MahƒÅ GhosƒÅnanda', means \\"great joyful proclaimer\\".Somdech Preah Maha Ghosananda - The Buddha of the Battlefields He was well known in Cambodia for his annual peace marches. Early life and education He was born Va Yav in Tak√©o Province, Cambodia in 1913 to a farming family in the Mekong Delta plains.The Biography of Preah Samdech Maha Ghosananda (1913-2007) From an early age he showed great interest in religion, and began to serve as a temple boy at age eight. He greatly impressed the monks with whom he served, and at age fourteen received novice ordination. He studied Pali scriptures in the local temple high school, then went on to complete his higher education at the monastic universities in Phnom Penh and Battambang. He was sponsored by Chuon Nath to travel to India to pursue a doctorate in Pali at Nalanda University in Bihar, at that time an institute known under the name of Nava NƒÅlandƒÅ MahƒÅvihƒÅra.Somdet Phra Maha Ghosananda (1929-) While in India, he studied under the Japanese monk Nichidatsu Fujii, founder of the Japanese peace- oriented sect Nipponzan Myohoji and a former associate of Mahatma Gandhi. In 1965, Maha Ghosananda left India to study meditation under Ajahn Dhammadaro, a famous meditation master of the Thai Forest Tradition. He remained with Ajahn Dhammadaro at his forest hermitage in southern Thailand, Wat Chai Na (located near Nakhon Si Thammarat),for eleven years.  Khmer Rouge era  In 1978, Maha Ghosananda traveled to the refugee camps near the Thai-Cambodian border to begin ministering to the first refugees who filtered across the border. Maha Ghosananda's appearance in the refugee camps raised a stir among the refugees who had not seen a monk for years. The Cambodian refugees openly wept as Maha Ghosananda chanted the ancient and familiar sutras that had been the bedrock of traditional Cambodian culture before Year Zero. He distributed photocopied Buddhist scriptures among the refugees, as protection and inspiration for the battered people. When the Pol Pot regime collapsed in 1979, Maha Ghosananda was one of only 3,000 Cambodian Buddhist monks alive, out of more than 60,000 at the start of the reign of terror in 1976. Throughout 1979 Maha Ghosananda established wats in refugee camps along the Thai-Cambodian border, ordaining monks against the orders of the Thai military.John Amos Marston, Elizabeth Guthrie, History, Buddhism, and new religious movements in Cambodia, University of Hawaii Press, (2004) , p. 201. He also founded more than 30 temples for Cambodian refugees living in Canada and the United States. His entire family, and countless friends and disciples, were massacred by the Khmer Rouge.  Restoration  Maha Ghosananda served as a key figure in post-Communist Cambodia, helping to restore the nation state and to revive Cambodian Buddhism. In 1980, he served as a representative of the Cambodian nation-in-exile to the United Nations. In 1980 Maha Ghosananda and the Reverend Peter L. Pond formed the Inter-Religious Mission for Peace in Cambodia. Together they located hundreds of surviving monks and nuns in Cambodia so that they could renew their vows and take leadership roles in Cambodian temples around the world. In June 1980 the Thai Government decided to forcibly repatriate thousands of refugees. Pond and the Preah Maha Ghosananda organized a protest against the forced repatriation of refugees from Sa Kaeo Refugee Camp.Brian Peter Harvey , An introduction to Buddhist ethics: foundations, values, and issues. Cambridge University Press, 2000, , p. 281. In 1988, Maha Ghosananda was elected as sanghreach (sangharaja) by a small gathering of exiled monks in Paris. He agreed to accept the position provisionally, until a complete, independent monastic hierarchy could be established in Cambodia. At the time, Venerable Tep Vong was the titular head of a unified Cambodian sangha, having been appointed to the position in 1981 by the Vietnamese-backed People's Republic of Kampuchea. In 1989, he returned full-time to Cambodia, taking up residence at Wat Sampeou Meas in Phnom Penh.  Dhammayietra  In 1992, during the first year of the United Nations sponsored peace agreement, Maha Ghosananda led the first nationwide Dhammayietra, a peace march or pilgrimage, across Cambodia in an effort to begin restoring the hope and spirit of the Cambodian people. The 16-day, 125-mile peace walk passed through territory still littered with landmines from the Khmer Rouge. The initial walk consisted of approximately 350 monks, nuns, and lay Buddhists who escorted around 100 Cambodians from refugee camps to their villages in Cambodia. This was carried out without official permission from Thai or Cambodian officials to cross the border. By the time the march reached Phnom Penh it had grown in size significantly, and drew coverage from the international media. In recognition of his contributions, King Sihanouk bestowed on Maha Goshananda the title samdech song santipeap ('Leader of Religion and Peace') later that year. The Dhammayietra became an annual walk which Maha Ghosananda led a number of times, despite the danger during the Khmer Rouge years. In 1995, the Dhammayietra consisted of almost 500 Cambodian Buddhist monks, nuns and precept-taking lay people. They were joined by The Interfaith Pilgrimage for Peace and Life. Together the two groups crossed Cambodia from the Thai border all the way to Vietnam, spending several days walking through Khmer Rouge-controlled territory along the way. For his teachings on non-violence and establishing Buddhist temples throughout the world that root his exiled people in their religion of peace, he was presented with the Peace Abbey Courage of Conscience Award. He had been called \\"the Gandhi of Cambodia.\\"Preah Maha Ghosananda, ‚ÄúGandhi of Cambodia‚Äù, The Economist March 22nd 2007 Maha Ghosananda was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by the chair of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Claiborne Pell. He was again nominated in 1995, 1996, and 1997 for his work in bringing peace to Cambodia. He also acted as an adviser to the Buddhist Peace Fellowship and resided part-time in the Palelai Buddhist Temple and Monastery in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. He died in Northampton, Massachusetts on March 12, 2007.

He is head of Kamal Hossain & Associates, a law firm based in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. Hossain is the founder and president of the Gano Forum political party and leader of the Jatiya Oikya Front alliance. He is widely regarded as an icon of secular democracy in South Asia. Hossain is the leader of the pro-democracy movement in Bangladesh. Educated at the University of Notre Dame and the University of Oxford, he was called to the bar of England and Wales in Lincoln's Inn in 1959. Hossain enrolled as an advocate in the High Court of East Pakistan. He worked on cases with prominent Pakistani lawyers, including Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy and Mahmud Ali Kasuri, early in his legal career. Hossain often worked on habeas corpus cases during the Ayub Khan regime. Between 1961 and 1968, he taught law at Dhaka University. Hossain was the legal counsel of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and the Awami League during the Agartala Conspiracy Case, and was elected vice-chairman of the Pakistan Bar Council in 1970. In 1971, he was part of the League's negotiation team for the transfer of power after the 1970 general election. Hossain was imprisoned in West Pakistan with Sheikh Mujibur Rahman during the war of independence that transformed East Pakistan into Bangladesh. He served in Bangladesh's first post-independence government from 1972 to 1975, initially as law minister and chairman of the drafting committee in the Constituent Assembly. Hossain led the process which produced the 1972 Constitution of Bangladesh. He then served as foreign minister, and led Bangladesh to join the United Nations in 1974. As energy minister, Hossain later enacted the Bangladesh Petroleum Act. He was a research fellow and visiting fellow at Oxford University during the late 1970s. In 1981, he ran as an opposition candidate for president against Abdus Sattar. Hossain fell out with Awami League president Sheikh Hasina during the 1990s, and formed the Gono Forum (People's Forum) party. Hossain has often worked with the United Nations and the Commonwealth of Nations. He was also considered as a candidate for the post of UN Secretary General. Revered in Bangladesh as the \\"conscience of the nation\\", Hossain was compared to Adlai Stevenson by The New York Times in 1981. Hossain has been a leading lawyer in the field of human rights, energy law, corporate law and international arbitration. He served on the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal and as UN Special Rapporteur for Afghanistan. Hossain has been a member of tribunals dealing with maritime disputes between Malaysia and Singapore and Guyana and Suriname. He was a two-term member of the UN Compensation Commission. He is a former vice-president of the International Law Association, former president of the Bangladesh Supreme Court Bar Association; and chairman of the Bangladesh Legal Aid and Services Trust and the South Asian Institute of Advanced Legal and Human Rights Studies (SAILS). Early life and education Hossain's family is from Shaestabad in Barisal; his grandfather, Syed Sadat Hossain, was the zamindar of Shaestabad. The area of Shaestabad was home to several Bengali zaminda. Hossain's father, Ahmed, was an early Bengali Muslim physician and MBBS holder in Calcutta, Bengal Presidency, British India. The elder Hossain was a relative of Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, the third Prime Minister of Bengal and fifth Prime Minister of Pakistan. Kamal Hossain was born on 20 April 1937 in Calcutta. His family moved to Dhaka, East Bengal in 1949 after the partition of British India. Hossain attended St. Gregory's High School, where his classmates included the future academic Anisuzzaman. He received a two-year scholarship to the University of Notre Dame in Indiana, United States at age 16, and studied economics before pursuing a master's degree from the University of Michigan. Hossain's American classmates included Richard V. Allen, future national security advisor to President Ronald Reagan. In the U.S., he joined the Pakistan Students Association with fellow Bengalis Nurul Islam and Golam Wahed Choudhury. Hossain was a member of the association's leadership committee, which was led by Munir Ahmed Khan. He has cited Justice Fazal Akbar as an inspiration to study law. Hossain moved to England from the U.S. in 1958, traveling to London by ship. In England, he met future professor Rehman Sobhan. In 1959, Hossain received a Bachelor of Civil Law degree from the University of Oxford and enrolled as a barrister in Lincoln's Inn. He also enrolled as an advocate in the High Court of East Pakistan. Hossain received a Doctor of Philosophy degree in international law from Oxford in 1964, with his dissertation \\"State Sovereignty and the United Nations Charter\\".  East Pakistan  Hossain began his practice at Original (one of the oldest law firms on the Indian subcontinent, which had established a division in East Bengal during the 1950s), and was invited to join the firm by lawyer Abul Ahmad. At Original, Hossain worked with two Englishmen and Justice Mohammad Hossain. Hossain was at Original from 1959 to 1962, when he came into frequent contact with barrister and former prime minister Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy. Pakistan had come under military rule after a 1958 coup, and Hossain has recounted that he and Suhrawardy often zigzagged their car through Dhaka's streets to confuse (and evade) Pakistani-intelligence vehicles. Through Suhrawardy, Hossain came into contact with Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. He has said that Rahman predicted the collapse of Ayub Khan's regime in 10 years (which it did, in 1969). Hossain defended Maulana Bhashani in a habeas corpus case. He was a lawyer for the English Rally brothers, who owned businesses in the Port of Narayanganj, and worked on a case for Chandranath Films. In 1963, Hossain began independent practice as a barrister. He represented The Daily Ittefaq, one of East Pakistan's largest Bengali-language newspapers, when it was banned by the Pakistani government. East Pakistan Chief Justice Badruddin Ahmed Siddiky told Hossain's lead counsel Mahmud Ali Kasuri to give the floor to Hossain during the Ittefaq case, and Kasuri obliged. The verdict favored Hossain and Kasuri. He joined Dhaka University's Department of International Relations as a part-time lecturer in 1961, and later taught international law. Hossain's academic work at the university continued until 1969, and he was a staunch supporter of the six point movement. During the Agartala Conspiracy Case, Hossain prepared the writ petition and worked on the case with Queen's Counsel Thomas William. In 1967, 1968 and 1969, he was elected vice-chairman of the East Pakistan Bar Council (now the Bangladesh Bar Council). Hossain was elected the last vice-chairman of the All-Pakistan Bar Council in 1969. In 1969 and 1970, he was involved in the round-table conferences between the government of Pakistan and major opposition parties led by the Awami League and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Kamal Hossain was the Awami League's chief political negotiator. After the 1970 Pakistani general election, Sheikh Mujib vacated one of his seats in Dacca and allowed Hossain to be elected to the National Assembly of Pakistan from that seat. Hossain was considered one of Mujib's closest confidantes, along with Tajuddin Ahmad. Between January and March 1971, Hossain negotiated with Pakistan's Law Minister Alvin Robert Cornelius and the Pakistan Peoples Party's lawyer Abdul Hafeez Pirzada over the transfer of power. Bangladeshi political career U.S. President Gerald Ford (right) speaks with Bangladeshi Foreign Minister Kamal Hossain (center) as Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (left) looks on. Hossain was imprisoned in West Pakistan's Central Prison Haripur during the 1971 Bangladesh War of Independence. He was released on 28 December 1971. After his release, he accompanied Sheikh Mujibur Rahman to London and New Delhi, followed by a triumphant homecoming in an independent Bangladesh on 10 January 1972. Hossain was appointed as the first law minister of the newly formed country. One of his chief responsibilities was to frame a constitution. He was chairman of the Constitution Drafting Committee in the Constituent Assembly of Bangladesh. He was 35 years of age at the time, making him one of the youngest constitution drafters in the world. Hossain was credited for leading the successful completion of the constitution's drafting process. The Constitution of Bangladesh was approved on 4 November 1972 and came into force on 16 December 1971. The constitution included a bill of rights and professed parliamentary government (scrapped in 1975 and restored in 1991). However, the constitution also included references to socialism, including language such as \\"realise through the democratic process a socialist society\\". On socialism, Hossain said \\"socialism was very much within the democratic framework and not socialism in the sense of communism. That, again, I think, is something that in the context of our historical experience from the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s was the big issue in those days\\". According to Hossain, the Awami League supported social democracy inspired by the politics of the British Labour Party. He recounted that socialism was an important political current in South Asia, especially during the 1960s and 1970s. For example, the Indian constitution also includes references to socialism. The government of post-1971 leader Zulfikar Ali Bhutto embarked on nationalization in Pakistan. The Dominion of Ceylon was proclaimed as the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka in 1972. Hossain served as a Member of Parliament from Dhaka in the Jatiyo Sangshad. He became the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh in 1973. Hossain secured Bangladesh's admission to the United Nations in 1974. The U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger called Hossain \\"another student of mine\\". Hossain was a signatory to the Delhi Agreement between India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. The agreement sought to normalize relations in the subcontinent after the 1971 conflict. In the agreement, Pakistan pledged to release interned Bengali families in exchange for the return of PoWs held by India and Bangladesh. On dealing with neighboring India, Hossain has said \\"I had a great equation with Mrs Indira Gandhi and her foreign minister Swaran Singh. We discussed the knotty issue of land boundary with so much ease\\". Hossain speaking at the University of Dhaka in 2011 Hossain was also appointed as energy minister. The 1973 oil crisis began to push developing countries like Bangladesh to explore their own oil and gas reserves. There was speculation of large reserves in the Bay of Bengal. Hossain began to study the legal reforms needed for Bangladesh to launch a hydrocarbon industry. 40 foreign companies applied to explore the bay. Under Hossain's tenure in the ministry, Petrobangla was established. Hossain drafted the Bangladesh Petroleum Act after studying the laws of Malaysia and Indonesia. The new law replaced colonial laws and introduced the Production Sharing Contract for multinational energy firms in the country. Hossain offered to resign on several occasions because of pressure due to the Awami League's lobbying activities. However, he continued to serve in Mujib's cabinet, even after the creation of the one party system of BAKSAL that lasted for 6 months between January and August 1975, until the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on 15 August 1975. At the time of the Mujib's killing, Hossain was visiting Yugoslavia on a bilateral visit. He refused invitations to join the martial law government. Fearing for his life and rejecting calls to return, he moved to Oxford University for a period of teaching and research. On BAKSAL, Hossain has said \\"Till 1971 I had not seen any differences between Mujib Bhai (the friend) and Bangabandhu (the leader). After 1972, he became the head of state. But, he never was both the head of the state and head of the party simultaneously. That change came later during the formation of BAKSAL. And that happened in a very complex situation. Through what dynamics he (Mujib) changed I cannot understand\\". The next government, which assumed power after Mujib's killing, functioned as a junta for 3 years headed by a Chief Martial Law Administrator. In 1979, President Ziaur Rahman (who was army chief during the junta) restored multiparty politics, promoted free markets and pursued pro-Western, anti-Communist policies. The 1979 Bangladeshi general election restored the country's parliament. Hossain returned to Bangladesh in the late 1970s during this period of political liberalization. In 1981, Hossain was instrumental in orchestrating Sheikh Hasina's return to Bangladesh from her exile in India (Hasina and Sheikh Rehana could not return to the country since their family's murder in 1975). He contested the 1981 Bangladeshi presidential election as the Awami League's candidate. He lost to then incumbent Justice Abdus Sattar, who had been acting president after the assassination of Ziaur Rahman. Within a year of the election, Sattar was deposed by the military during the 1982 Bangladesh coup d'√©tat. At the time of President Hussain Muhammad Ershad's downfall in 1990, Hossain played a leading role in drawing up the Three- Alliance Roadmap for the restoration of parliamentary democracy after 15 years of presidential government. He was also involved in making the then chief justice Shahabuddin Ahmed the head of the transitional government. Hossain (left) with political activists In 1992, differences between Hossain and Awami League president Sheikh Hasina caused him to leave the party. He set up a small political party called Gano Forum. In 1996, when the Awami League and Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) were at loggerheads, Kamal Hossain and Syed Ishtiaq Ahmed devised a formula that culminated in the introduction of the system of caretaker governance for holding general elections. Similar caretaker governments headed by judges were later adopted in Pakistan, Greece and Bhutan.https://www.ft.com/content/e18e27e6-a012-11e1-90f3-00144feabdc0 In 2003, Hossain was the counsel for The Daily Star editor Mahfuz Anam and Prothom Alo editor Matiur Rahman in a defamation case filed by Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury. In 2006, when the caretaker system was threatened by Prime Minister Khaleda Zia's efforts to influence the election process, Kamal Hossain led the legal battle against the fraudulent voter list drawn up by the Zia government. Hossain also criticized extrajudicial killings by the Rapid Action Battalion under the Zia administration. A Bangladeshi man stares at a campaign banner of the Hossain-led National Unity Front Hossain has criticized human rights abuses under the second and third Hasina administrations. In 2011, he defended Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus in court following Hasina's decision to sack Yunus from the board of Grameen Bank. In 2018, Hossain defended the photographer Shahidul Alam in court after Alam was detained on charges of criticizing Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Hossain has also supported the deposed chief justice Surendra Kumar Sinha who struck down a constitutional amendment allowing parliament to impeach supreme court judges. In October 2018, Kamal Hossain announced a new alliance called Jatiya Oikya Front (National Unity Front), which received backing from the BNP. Hossain addressed political rallies in different Bangladeshi cities during October and November 2018. He addressed a rally in Sylhet on 24 October. In Chittagong on 27 October, he warned the Hasina government of legal consequences if the opposition's election demands were not met. At a rally in Suhrawardy Udyan in Dhaka on 6 November 2018, Hossain said \\"The state does not belong to any king or queen. It is the people who are the sole owners of the state and their ownership must be realized\\". He secured a major breakthrough in Bangladeshi politics by requesting Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to have a dialogue with the BNP. The US Ambassador to Bangladesh Marcia Bernicat lauded the dialogue initiative. The first round of talks took place on 1 November 2018 and the second round on 7 November 2018. Hossain also met with the Chief Election Commissioner, attended the Mawlid prayer in Bangabhaban and the military reception on Armed Forces Day. The official campaign period began on 8 November 2018. Previous free and fair elections in Bangladesh were usually a festive affair. Despite the dialogue and assurances of a peaceful election atmosphere from Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, the campaign period was marked by persecution of civil society, media and the opposition; and human rights abuses by security forces. Human Rights Watch noted that \\"widespread surveillance and a crackdown on speech, have contributed to a climate of fear extending from prominent voices in society to ordinary citizens.\\" The Awami League's affiliated student and youth wings mobilized its members who were armed with bamboo poles to attack the opposition. Hossain's motorcade was attacked on 14 December 2018. The 2018 Bangladeshi general election was held amid widespread allegations of vote rigging, ballot box stuffing and intimidation of opposition polling agents. Hossain said \\"There was an unprecedented vote robbery, which is a mockery of democracy. The government has exploited state machinery to suppress opposition and secure a stage- managed victory. We call upon the Election Commission to declare the election void and demand a fresh election under a non-partisan government\\". After the election commission refused demands for a new election, Hossain called the incoming government illegitimate. He said \\"We need a united movement of citizens, political parties and human rights organizations that are committed to the realization of human rights and the institutionalization of democracy in the country. I hope the international community will take note of the current situation in Bangladesh. And on the basis of the United Nations Charter and resolutions, it shouldn't recognize any government which doesn't have the consent of the people\\".I hope the international community will take note of the current situation in Bangladesh.

We will continue to support the work in this context, in the interest of the people of Bangladesh. The relevant national authorities should now ensure a proper examination of allegations of irregularities and commit to full transparency in their resolution\\". The US State Department stated \\"We strongly encourage all parties to refrain from violence and request the Election Commission work constructively with all sides to address claims of irregularities. Bangladesh‚Äôs impressive record of economic development and respect for democracy and human rights are mutually reinforcing, and we look forward to continue working with the ruling government and opposition towards advancing these interrelated goals\\".

Public perception Hossain welcoming Indian foreign minister Natwar Singh in Dhaka, 2005 Hossain is the vanguard of liberal, secular politics in modern Bangladesh. He has been described as the \\"elder statesman\\" of Bangladesh, a \\"father figure\\" in the political arena; and the \\"conscience of the nation\\". An article in The Daily Star on the occasion of Hossain's 70th birthday states \\"If anything, in these past many years, he has in a way been transformed into an effective moral voice for the country. His opinions on the issues that matter, his presence on the national and global stage, all of these have reinforced our feeling that this man of the law also happens to be our point of reference on all other matters which exercise our imagination\\".https://www.southasiafoundation.org/chairperson_bangladesh.htm In 1981, The New York Times reported that Western diplomats compared Hossain to the former US senator and presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson, who was reputed for his intellectual demeanor. In 2018, an article in The Diplomat magazine described Hossain as a \\"shrewd\\" back-channel player. In regional neighbors India and Pakistan, Hossain is celebrated as a secular icon with impeccable credentials.https://timesfindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/talkingturkey/sheikh- hasina-wins-big-but-could-a-secular-opposition-formation-be-taking-shape-in- bangladesh/ Hossain delivered a speech at the Pakistan Institute of International Affairs in 2012, which was titled \\"Building a peaceful South Asia in response to the aspirations of all our peoples\\". =Political criticism= During the 2018 election campaign, Shah Ali Farhad, who works in the Awami League's Centre for Research and Information, wrote in the Bangla Tribune that Kamal Hossain was a \\"not so conscientious\\" politician. He criticized Hossain for holding the presidency of Gono Forum since its founding, arguing that the party had \\"no prospects of a new leadership in sight\\". Hossain has been labelled a \\"Pakistani collaborator\\" and a \\"Ahmadi\\" Muslim, despite being one of Bangladesh's founding leaders and a Sunni Muslim. He has been accused of betraying the family of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Arun Kumar Goswami, a political science professor at Jagannath University, criticized Hossain for not being a mass leader, stating \\"The politics Dr. Kamal Hossain wants to introduce would not work in Bangladesh. You cannot succeed in politics here without having connection with the people\\". Goswami was in turn refuted by Moudud Ahmed, who stated \\"I can refer a number of politicians who succeeded with lesser contact with people than that of Dr. Kamal Hossain\\". In response to Hossain's demand for a caretaker government in 2018, Sheikh Hasina said such a provision was not included in Bangladesh's first constitution drafted by Hossain himself under her father's tenure. The BNP responded to this charge by pointing out that Hasina herself led the campaign for starting caretaker governance for elections in 1996. Former president A. Q. M. Badruddoza Chowdhury and his son Mahi B. Chowdhury initially supported Hossain as part of the National Unity Front, but later switched to support for the Awami League and began to criticize Hossain's political ambitions. During a hearing in the Supreme Court in 2017, Hossain used an expletive against Attorney General Mahbubey Alam and was censured by chief justice Surendra Kumar Sinha. During the election campaign period in December 2018, Hossain was asked about the underground relationship between the BNP and the Jamaat. Hossain told the reporter to \\"keep quiet\\" but later regretted his reaction after protests from two journalist trade unions. He later called the BNP-Jamaat relationship \\"stupid\\".

The historic hotel (1914) is located in downtown Calgary, Alberta at 133 9th Avenue Southwest adjacent to the Calgary Tower and Palliser Square. It is the city's oldest and most luxurious hotel and celebrated its centennial on June 1, 2014. Lobby When the Canadian Pacific Railway pushed west in 1883, Calgary was essentially a mounted police post and trading centre. With an influx of tourists, mainly en route to Canadian Pacific's Banff Springs hotel, a hospitality spot in Calgary was an essential link. Groundbreaking for the building was on May 12, 1911, on property owned by the Canadian Pacific Railway. It was built by P. Lyall and Sons Construction Company with materials such as stone, steel, reinforced concrete and brick at a cost of $1,500,000. The hotel opened on June 1, 1914. Like all of the flagship Canadian hotels in the Fairmont chain, it was built by the Canadian Pacific Railway and was a property of Canadian Pacific Hotels and Resorts (CP Hotels) until the company purchased the Fairmont Hotel chain and changed its name to Fairmont Hotels and Resorts in 1999. The hotel was named after Captain John Palliser, who was an explorer in the region during the 1850s. Architect Lawrence Gotch of E. and W.S. Maxwell of Montreal designed the Edwardian building with a characteristic Chicago school look. The building was originally eight stories high, with three stories added in 1929, making it Calgary's highest building until 1958. It has been renovated and expanded a number of times throughout its history, including a $28 million renovation in 2000. Further enhancements and renovations in recent years included an update to Fairmont Gold and many guest rooms. The Palliser, and the Hotel Macdonald in Edmonton, received the first two liquor licences from the Alberta Liquor Control Board when Alberta repealed Prohibition in 1924.

WRFA would amend that part of title VII which is codified at 42 U.S.C. 2000e(j). In its current form (as of 2013), 42 U.S.C. 2000e(j) forbids discrimination on the basis of religion, including \\"all aspects of religious observance and practice, as well as belief, unless an employer demonstrates that he is unable to reasonably accommodate to an employee's or prospective employee's religious observance or practice without undue hardship on the conduct of the employer's business.\\" The 2013 version of WRFA would delete the phrase \\"he is unable,\\" and substitute for it: \\"the employer is unable, after initiating and engaging in an affirmative and bona fide effort.\\" In other words, an employer would be required to make a \\"bona fide effort\\" to accommodate each religious practice or observance, and would be relieved of this duty only if the employer could prove that the effort resulted in \\"undue hardship.\\" WRFA would also add an additional provision, to be codified at 42 U.S.C. 2000e(j)(2), further limiting employers' ability to deny accommodations with respect to \\"the practice of wearing religious clothing or a religious hairstyle, or of taking time off for a religious reason.\\" In such cases, the employer's proposed choice of accommodation would not be considered reasonable (or lawful) \\"unless the accommodation removes the conflict between employment requirements and the religious practice of the employee.\\" In order to refuse accommodation to these categories of religious practices, an employer would be required to meet a stringent definition of undue hardship by showing that \\"the accommodation imposes a significant difficulty or expense on the conduct of the employer's business.\\" With these provisions, WRFA expressly attempts to supersede the Supreme Court's decision in Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison, 432 U.S. 63 (1977) (see Section 2, \\"Findings,\\" para. 3). In that case, the Supreme Court held that an employer could deny an employee‚Äôs request for religious accommodation based on any burden greater than a de minimis burden on the employer. WRFA was first introduced in the House of Representatives in 1994 by Jerrold Nadler (D-NY). As originally introduced, the proposed 42 U.S.C. 2000e(j)(2) would not have been limited to religious clothing, hairstyle and holiday observances. The bill was introduced in the Senate in 1999, by Senator John Kerry (D-MA), and again in 2002. Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) introduced the bill again in 2003. In 2005, WFRA was once again introduced in the Senate by Senators Santorum and Kerry, and in the House of Representatives by Representatives Mark Souder (R-IN), Carolyn McCarthy (D-NY), Bobby Jindal (R-LA), and Anthony Weiner (D-NY). Other supporters of the bill included Senator Hillary Clinton (D-NY) and Senator Ted Kennedy (D-MA). The bill did not pass either house. In 2010, the Act was reintroduced in the Senate as the Workplace Religious Freedom Act of 2010 (S. 4046). In 2012, the Act was again reintroduced in the Senate as the Workplace Religious Freedom Act of 2013 (S. 3686). In each case, the Act's sponsor was Senator John Kerry (D-MA). In its various incarnations, the scope of WRFA was narrowed to encompass religious dress, grooming, and holidays. Although WRFA has consistently had supporters in both parties, it has yet to pass. This legislation has garnered the diverse support of various religious groups including, the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations, the Southern Baptist Convention, the National Council of Churches, the North American Council for Muslim Women, the Sikh American Legal Defense and Education Fund, the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the Jewish Council for Public Affairs ,the Council on American Islamic Relations, B'nai B'rith International, the American Jewish Committee, Agudath Israel of America, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and other groups. When first introduced, WRFA was opposed by the ACLU.ACLU Letter on the Harmful Effect of S. 893, the Workplace Religious Freedom Act, on Critical Personal and Civil Rights The ACLU considered the bill \\"poorly-written\\" and argued that it could legalize certain acts of discrimination in the name of religion. The ACLU was also concerned that other employees might be forced to carry additional workloads to accommodate the religious practices of co-workers, and that the secular nature of the workplace would be eroded. They and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and several other business organizations opposed it as placing undue legal burdens on employers. When the scope of the provision which would create 42 U.S.C. 2000e(j)(2) was narrowed, supporters of the bill claimed that the ACLU dropped its opposition, although the ACLU itself declined comment. Michael J. Eastman, executive director of labor law policy for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said of the revised bill, \\"We are not in the habit of supporting bills that make it easier to sue our members.\\" See also *Workplace spirituality References External links *IPA Public Policy Library *Church State Council *American Jewish Committee Urges Enactment of WRFA *Remarks of Hillary Clinton at the Seventh-day Adventist Annual Religious Liberty Dinner regarding WRFA *Library of Congress - H.R. 1445 *Library of Congress - S. 677 *ACLU statement opposing the bill *American Humanist Association statement opposing WRFA Category:2005 in American law Category:Clothing controversies Category:Labor relations in the United States Category:United States proposed federal legislation Category:Freedom of religion in the United States Category:Religious clothing Category:Christianity and law in the 21st century ","title":"Workplace Religious Freedom Act"},{"id":"2090827","text":"The Roman Catholic Diocese of Monterey-Fresno was formerly a Latin suffragan diocese of the Roman Catholic Church in California, United States.

Fossils from New South Wales and New Zealand are estimated to be 50 million years old, corresponding to the Paleogene. They grow to 4 ‚Äì 30m tall, and some are dry-season deciduous. Several species (though not all) are pachycaul plants with a very stout stem for their overall size, used to store water during periods of drought. The leaves show intraspecific variation and generally range from entire to deeply palmately lobed with long slender leaflet-like lobes joined only right at the base. Their sizes range from 4 ‚Äì 20 cm long and wide. All species are monoecious with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. The flowers have a bell-shaped perianth consisting of a single series of fused lobes which is regarded as a calyx despite being brightly coloured in most species. The female flowers have five separate carpels that can each form a woody fruit containing several seeds. The flower colour is often variable within species. Eastern forest species drop their foliage before flowering but those of the drier regions carry the flowers while in leaf. A few species of Kurrajong, as the tree is known in the Dharuk language, are popular garden trees and have been introduced to hot dry regions including the Mediterranean, South Africa and the western United States. These species are also hybridised for horticultural purposes, B. populneo-acerifolius being one example. Kurrajongs are known to bloom erratically in cultivation. Name The name Brachychiton is derived from the Greek brachys, short, and chiton, tunic, in referring to its loose seed coats. The generic name is often misconstrued as being of neuter gender, with the specific epithets then incorrectly amended. Thus B. rupestre and B. populneum are sometimes seen in horticultural books and magazines. Kurrajong comes from Dharuk garraju≈ã \\"fishing line\\", as fishing lines were made from kurrajong bark.

The ARBA is headquartered in Knox, Pennsylvania in the United States. Its membership is composed of rabbit and cavy breeders throughout, fanciers, and pet owners in North America and many countries throughout the world. The ARBA serves to promote the domestic rabbit and cavy fancy, as well as commercial rabbit production. The American Rabbit Breeders Association sets official breed standards for recognized rabbit breeds and cavy breeds. Every five years the ARBA publishes a detailed guide entitled Standard of Perfection. This guide is beneficial to rabbit and cavy (guinea pig) breeders, providing a reference to those interested in understanding the conformation standard for the variety of breeds recognized by the ARBA. ARBA recognizes 49 breeds of rabbit and 13 cavy breeds. Checkered Giant rabbit Rabbit shows The ARBA sanctions rabbit shows throughout the year, all over the USA and Canada. These shows, sponsored by local clubs, fairs, and show circuits, give rabbit and cavy fanciers the chance to have their animals examined by educated judges and compared to other breeders' animals and the standard. The ARBA holds a large national convention show once a year, which draws in fanciers from across the country and around the world. The 2005 ARBA convention was documented in the film Rabbit Fever. The 2006 ARBA Convention was held in Ft. Worth, Texas, the 2007 ARBA Convention was held in Grand Rapids, Michigan, 2008 in Louisville, Kentucky, 2009 in San Diego, California, 2010 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, 2011 in Indianapolis, Indiana, 2012 in Wichita, Kansas, 2013 in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and 2014 in Ft. Worth, Texas. Rabbit raising education This organization helps all levels of rabbit keepers and breeders, including 4-H participants to fanciers, pet owners to commercial producers. The ARBA also produces educational materials such as a guide book, 'Raising Better Rabbits & Cavies', as well as informative books on each registered breed, and a poster with photographs of the recognized breeds of rabbits and cavies, and rabbit registrar and judge training materials. The judges education program is an ongoing program for established judges. Unified judging and registration system The ARBA has a standardized judging system in which rabbits are judged against the respective breed standard, set by a 100-point scale, and published in the Standard of Perfection. It is a book detailing all of the recognized breeds in the United States and their attributes. The association has licensed judges since the early 1900s who may judge at sanctioned shows and fairs. The registration system maintains records on all rabbits which have passed a registration examination to ensure the animals are healthy and meet the ARBA Standard for the rabbits' breed. ARBA licensed registrars conduct the examination. Registrations are ranked Red, White and Blue to distinguish how many ancestors of the subject rabbit have been previously registered. ARBA Library and Hall of Fame The ARBA Library, located at the headquarters in Knox, Pennsylvania, houses the world's largest single repository of books and writings on domestic rabbits. It is an archival library, not a lending library. It holds over 10,000 items/pieces, which are housed in the collection, and it continues to constantly grow. The next largest similar collection is at the United States National Agricultural Library in Maryland, and it holds about 1,300 pieces. The British National Library, London also has an extensive collection. Access to the Library for research by members is available by appointment only. ARBA Youth Scholarship The ARBA offers a Youth Scholarship program for high school graduates who wish to further their education. The recipients must have graduated with a minimum 3.0 grade point average and be enrolled in their first year of higher education.

Simpson, Montclair College Preparatory School was one of the oldest private, co-educational, independent, secondary schools in the San Fernando Valley. A rigorous, traditional college preparatory education was offered to students in grades six through twelve. The school was governed by a board of directors which set the overall direction of the school. Montclair Prep maintained faculty academic advisement and standards committees that worked with the administration to maintain the highest caliber of academics and to provide a small group of social, athletic, and cultural extracurricular activities for its students. In May 2011, Gazi Kabir, a social studies teacher, was arrested for having sex with a 15-year-old student on multiple occasions. He was previously accused of child annoyance in 2007, and his teaching certificate had been suspended for misconduct for two weeks by the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing. During the 2000s the school's American football team saw increasingly little participation, and switched to eight-man football. In July 2011, Montclair announced that it was dropping all athletic programs, as well as the middle school portion of the school. In addition, seventy percent of the faculty was laid off.

The station is owned by West Palm Beach, Florida-based Ion Media Networks (the former Paxson Communications). KPPX-TV's offices are located on Camelback Road on the northeast side of Phoenix, and its transmitter is located atop South Mountain on the city's south side. History In February 1981, during an open window for low-power TV station applications, San Bernardino, California-based Community Service Television Company applied for a construction permit to build a translator station on channel 51, to serve Phoenix from atop South Mountain. Two years later, on March 28, 1983, Saul Dresner filed a petition with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to allot UHF channel 51 to Tolleson, Arizona, for a full power television station. He presented sufficient evidence to support the allotment and expressed interest in applying for a station, and the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on June 9. On May 29, 1984, having received Mexican concurrence, the FCC allotted UHF channel 51 to Tolleson. On November 23, Great Arizona Broadcasting Co., owned in part by Dresner, submitted an application to build a full power television station on the new allocation. More than twenty competing applications followed, and the FCC set up a hearing before an administrative law judge to determine which applicant would be the most qualified to build and operate the new station. Great Arizona Broadcasting subsequently withdrew its application, and on November 18, 1987, Judge Edward Luton released a decision granting the application of Aztec Broadcasting Corp., and denying the nine applications which remained. Several of the denied applicants appealed the decision, and the FCC scheduled a hearing before a Review Board on May 6, 1988, to present exceptions to the initial decision. After hearing the arguments, the Review Board reversed the initial decision, and granted a permit to Hector Garcia Salvatierra instead. The FCC granted the construction permit on December 21, 1988. More appeals followed, and on September 5, 1990, the FCC released a Memorandum Opinion and Order upholding the decision of the Review Board. The decision was again appealed, this time to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and on October 7, 1991, the Court of Appeals upheld the decision of the FCC Review Board. The new station was originally proposed for bilingual operations using stereo and separate audio program, but activity on the construction permit stopped. In March 1993, while the full power construction permit remained inactive, the FCC issued a construction permit for the low power translator station that had submitted an application twelve years earlier. The permit was valid until September 1994, and the new station received the call sign K51EI. K51EI was not constructed in the allotted time, and shortly before the permit expired, Community Service Television Company requested a six-month extension, which was granted in December 1994. However, in January 1995, Salvatierra secured a site license to build his station's facilities on South Mountain, then requested and received the call letters KAJW the following month. The K51EI permit was allowed to expire in June 1995, and in February 1996, the permit was canceled and call sign deleted. On July 31, 1996, Salvatierra entered into an agreement with Paxson Communications (now Ion Media Networks). Under terms of the agreement, Salvatierra created a new ownership entity called America 51, L.P., sold 49% interest of the new company to Paxson for $5.4 million, transferred the construction permit and site license to Paxson to build the television station, and gave them the right to purchase the remainder of the company for $6.6 million once the TV station had been on air for one year. Salvatierra filed the pro forma application the following week to assign the construction permit from Hector Garcia Salvatierra to America 51, L.P. The station changed its call letters to KPPX in March 1998 to reflect its pending affiliation with Paxson's new Pax TV network (now Ion Television), and the station signed on the air February 15, 1999, broadcasting under Program Test Authority until its license was granted on April 20, 2000. Salvatierra sold the remaining interest in the company to Paxson Communications in November 2000. =Sale to Scripps and possible resale= On September 24, 2020, the Cincinnati-based E. W. Scripps Company (owner of KNXV-TV and KASW) announced that it would purchase Ion Media for $2.65 billion, with financing from Berkshire Hathaway. With this purchase, Scripps will divest 23 Ion-owned stations, but no announcement has been made as to which stations that Scripps will divest as part of the move (KPPX-TV is likely to be one of the divested outlets since Scripps already owns two stations in the Phoenix market). The proposed divestitures will allow the merged company to fully comply with the FCC local and national ownership regulations. Scripps has agreed to a transaction with an unnamed buyer, who has agreed to maintain Ion affiliations for the stations.E.W. Scripps scales up with $2.65 billion Berkshire-backed deal for ION Media Digital television RabbitEars TV Query for KPPX =Analog-to-digital conversion= In 1997, the FCC specified UHF channel 52 as the transition digital channel for KPPX-TV and granted a construction permit to build transition facilities on March 1, 2001. The station began digital operations pursuant to Program Test Authority on November 1, 2002, and the FCC granted the license to cover digital operations on December 20. Because its pre-transition digital channel was outside the range of core frequencies designated by the FCC (channels 2-51)‚Äîthe high band UHF channels (52-69) being removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition‚ÄîKPPX-TV chose channel 51 for its permanent digital television operations, where it would move at the end of the digital transition, which, at the time, was scheduled for February 17, 2009. Although the DTV Delay Act became law on February 11, 2009 postponing the required analog shutoff until June 12, 2009, KPPX made the decision to proceed with final conversion on February 17, which was approved by the FCC. KPPX-TV shut down its analog signal on February 17, 2009, the original target date for full-power television stations in the United States to transition from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate (which Congress had moved the previous month to June 12). The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 52, which was among the high band UHF channels (52-69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition, to its analog-era UHF channel 51. In January 2016, KPPX-TV submitted a petition to the FCC to change RF channel from 51 to 31 as part of an agreement to allow T-Mobile to begin service in the adjacent 700 MHz band. Finding that the petition warranted consideration, the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) in April, and approved the Tolleson allotment change in June. The following month, KPPX-TV submitted an application to change channels, which was immediately approved by the FCC. The station completed the move to channel 31 in October. =FCC spectrum repack= KPPX-TV was assigned channel 14 in the FCC Spectrum Repack, and was scheduled to change channels in Phase 10, to be completed by July 3, 2020. However, citing concerns of signal interference between channel 14 and the adjacent land mobile band at 460 MHz - 470 MHz, the station asserted that it was unable to construct facilities that would not cause prohibited interference. The FCC agreed, and allowed KPPX-TV to request alternate facilities during the first priority filing window. The station has requested to remain on channel 31. Pornography controversy On March 12, 2007, during a 9 p.m. airing of an Ion Life rebroadcast of a Tom Brokaw-hosted NBC special, State of U.S. Health Care, a station employee inserted about 30 seconds of a pornographic film into the broadcast, prompting telephone calls to local news media outlets and the local cable provider, Cox Communications. Parent company Ion Media Networks conducted a rigorous investigation into what they called \\"an intolerable act of human sabotage\\", and shortly thereafter, announced that the employee found to be responsible had been fired, threatening further legal action. Newscasts From 2001 until 2005, when NBC entered into a shared services agreement with Pax TV, KPPX aired tape delays of KPNX's 6:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. newscasts at 6:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. References External links  Category:Ion Television affiliates PPX-TV Category:Television channels and stations established in 1999 Category:1999 establishments in Arizona ","title":"KPPX-TV"},{"id":"2090861","text":"Anna Julia Haywood Cooper (August 10, 1858 ‚Äì February 27, 1964) was an American author, educator, sociologist, speaker, Black liberation activist, and one of the most prominent African-American scholars in United States history. Born into slavery in 1858, Cooper went on to receive a world-class education and claim power and prestige in academic and social circles. Upon receiving her PhD in history from the Sorbonne in 1924, Cooper became the fourth African-American woman to earn a doctoral degree. She was also a prominent member of Washington, D.C.'s African-American community and a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority. Cooper made contributions to social science fields, particularly in sociology. Her first book, A Voice from the South: By a Black Woman of the South, is widely acknowledged as one of the first articulations of Black feminism, giving Cooper the often-used title of \\"the Mother of Black Feminism.\\" From Biography =Childhood = Anna \\"Annie\\" Julia Cooper (n√©e Haywood) was born enslaved in Raleigh, North Carolina in 1858. She and her mother, Hannah Stanley Haywood, were held in bondage by George Washington Haywood (1802‚Äì1890), one of the sons of North Carolina's longest serving state treasurer John Haywood, who helped found the University of North Carolina, but whose estate later was forced to repay missing funds. Either George, in whose household her mother worked in bondage, or his brother, Dr. Fabius Haywood, in whose household her older brother Andrew was enslaved, were probably Anna's father; Anna's mother refused to clarify paternity. George became state attorney for Wake County, North Carolina and with a brother owned a plantation in Greene County, Alabama. Cooper worked as a domestic servant in the Haywood home and had two older brothers, Andrew J. Haywood and Rufus Haywood. Andrew, enslaved by Fabius J. Haywood, later served in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Rufus was also born enslaved and became the leader of the musical group Stanley's Band. =Education= In 1868, when Cooper was nine years old, she received a scholarship and began her education at the newly opened Saint Augustine's Normal School and Collegiate Institute in Raleigh, founded by the local Episcopal diocese for the purpose of training teachers to educate the formerly enslaved and their families. The Reverend J. Brinton offered Cooper a scholarship to help pay for her expenses. According to Mark S. Giles, a Cooper biographer, \\"the educational levels offered at St. Augustine ranged from primary to high school, including trade-skill training.\\" During her 14 years at St. Augustine's, she distinguished herself as a bright and ambitious student who showed equal promise in both liberal arts and analytical disciplines such as mathematics and science; her subjects included languages (Latin, French, Greek), English literature, math, and science. Although the school had a special track reserved for women ‚Äì dubbed the \\"Ladies' Course\\" ‚Äì and the administration actively discouraged women from pursuing higher-level courses, Cooper fought for her right to take a course reserved for men, by demonstrating her scholastic ability. During this period, St. Augustine's pedagogical emphasis was on training young men for the ministry and preparing them for additional training at four-year universities. One of these men, George A.C. Cooper, would later become her husband. He died after only two years of marriage. Cooper's academic excellence enabled her to work as a tutor for younger children, which also helped her pay for her educational expenses. After completing her studies, she remained at the institution as an instructor. In the 1883‚Äì1884 school year, she taught classics, modern history, higher English, and vocal and instrumental music; she is not listed as faculty in the 1884‚Äì1885 year, but in the 1885‚Äì1886 year she is listed as \\"Instructor in Classic, Rhetoric, Etc.\\" Her husband's early death may have contributed to her ability to continue teaching; if she had stayed married, she might have been encouraged or required to withdraw from the university to become a housewife. After her husband's death, Cooper entered Oberlin College in Ohio, where she continued to follow the course of study designated for men, graduating in 1884. Given her academic qualifications, she was admitted as a sophomore. She often attempted to take four classes, rather than three as was prescribed by the College; she also was attracted to Oberlin by its reputation for music, but was unable to take as many classes in piano as she would have wished. Among her classmates were fellow black women Ida Gibbs (later Hunt) and Mary Church Terrell. At Oberlin, she was part of the \\"LLS\\", \\"one of the two literary societies for women, whose regular programs featured lectures by distinguished speakers as well as singers and orchestras\\". After teaching briefly at Wilberforce College, Cooper returned to St. Augustine's in 1885. She then went back to Oberlin and earned an M.A. in Mathematics in 1888, making her one of the first two Black women - along with Mary Church Terrell, who received her M.A. in the same year - to earn a Master's degree. In 1900 she made her first trip to Europe, to participate in the First Pan-African Conference in London. After visiting the cathedral towns of Scotland and England, she went to Paris for the World Exposition. \\"After a week at the Exposition she went to Oberammergau to see the Passion Play, thence to Munich and other German towns, and then to Italy through Rome, Naples, Venice, Pompeii, Mt. Vesuvius, and Florence.\\" =Washington DC years = She later moved to Washington, DC. In 1892, Anna Cooper, Helen Appo Cook, Ida B. Bailey, Charlotte Forten Grimk√©, Mary Jane Peterson, Mary Church Terrell, and Evelyn Shaw formed the Colored Women's League in Washington, D.C. The goals of the service-oriented club were to promote unity, social progress and the best interests of the African-American community. Helen Cook was elected president. Cooper would develop a close friendship with Charlotte Forten Grimk√© ‚Äì Cooper began teaching Latin at M Street High School, becoming principal in 1901.Busby, Margaret, \\"Anna J. Cooper\\", Daughters of Africa, London: Jonathan Cape, 1992, p. 136. She later became entangled in a controversy involving the differing attitudes about black education, as she advocated for a model of classical education espoused by W.E.B. Du Bois, \\"designed to prepare eligible students for higher education and leadership\\", rather than the vocational program that was promoted by Booker T. Washington. As a result of this, she left the school. Later, she was recalled to M Street, and she fit her work on her doctoral thesis into \\"nooks and crannies of free time\\". M Street School A Voice from the South During her years as a teacher and principal at M Street High School, Cooper also completed her first book, titled A Voice from the South: By a Black Woman of the South, published in 1892, and delivered many speeches calling for civil rights and women's rights. Perhaps her most well-known volume of writing, A Voice from the South, is widely viewed as one of the first articulations of Black feminism. The book advanced a vision of self-determination through education and social uplift for African-American women. Its central thesis was that the educational, moral, and spiritual progress of Black women would improve the general standing of the entire African-American community. She says that the violent natures of men often run counter to the goals of higher education, so it is important to foster more female intellectuals because they will bring more elegance to education. This view was criticized by some as submissive to the 19th-century cult of true womanhood, but others label it as one of the most important arguments for Black feminism in the 19th century. Cooper advanced the view that it was the duty of educated and successful Black women to support their underprivileged peers in achieving their goals. The essays in A Voice from the South also touched on a variety of topics, such as race and racism, gender, the socioeconomic realities of Black families, and the administration of the Episcopal Church. =Later years= LeDroit Park neighborhood of Washington, D.C. The home is located beside Anna J. Cooper Circle. Cooper was an author, educator, and public speaker. In 1893, she delivered a paper titled \\"The Intellectual Progress of the Colored Women of the United States since the Emancipation Proclamation\\" at the World's Congress of Representative Women in Chicago. She was one of five African-American women invited to speak at this event, along with: Fannie Barrier Williams, Sarah Jane Woodson Early, Hallie Quinn Brown, and Fanny Jackson Coppin. Cooper was also present at the first Pan-African Conference in London, England, in 1900 and delivered a paper titled \\"The Negro Problem in America.\\"Sylvester Williams, Spartacus Educational. In a 1902 speech she said: In 1914, at the age of 56, Cooper began courses for her doctoral degree at Columbia University, but was forced to interrupt her studies in 1915 when she adopted her late half-brother's five children upon their mother's death. Later on she transferred her credits to the University of Paris-Sorbonne, which did not accept her Columbia thesis, an edition of Le P√®lerinage de Charlemagne. Over a decade she researched and composed her dissertation, completing her coursework in 1924. Cooper defended her thesis \\"The Attitude of France on the Question of Slavery Between 1789 and 1848\\" in 1925. Cooper‚Äôs retirement from Washington Colored High School in 1930 was by no means the end of her political activism. The same year she retired, she accepted the position of president at Frelinghuysen University, a school founded to provide classes for DC residents lacking access to higher education. Cooper worked for Frelinghuysen for twenty years, first as president and then as registrar, and left the school only a decade before she passed away in 1964 at the age of 105. At the age of 65, she became the fourth Black woman in American history to earn a Doctorate of Philosophy degree. Her work was eventually published in an anthology of medieval French literature, and was requested for classes and the bookstore at Harvard. =Frelinghuysen University= Cooper's later years were much involved with Frelinghuysen University, of which she was the president. This was an institution providing continuing education to working African Americans at hours that did not interfere with their employment. After the University found servicing its mortgage prohibitive, she moved it to her own house. =Death= On February 27, 1964, Cooper died in Washington, D.C., at the age of 105. Her memorial was held in a chapel on the campus of Saint Augustine's College, in Raleigh, North Carolina, where her academic career began. She was buried alongside her husband at the City Cemetery in Raleigh. Artistry =Writings= Although the alumni magazine of Cooper's undergraduate alma mater, Oberlin College, praised her in 1924, stating \\"The class of '84 is honored in the achievement of this scholarly and colored alumna,\\" yet when she tried to present her edition of Le P√®lerinage de Charlemagne to the college the next year, it was rejected.Shilton, Katherine, \\"'This Scholarly and Colored Alumna': Anna Julia Cooper's Troubled Relationship with Oberlin College\\", Oberlin College, 2003.

Cooper"},{"id":"2090865","text":"Linear multistep methods are used for the numerical solution of ordinary differential equations. Conceptually, a numerical method starts from an initial point and then takes a short step forward in time to find the next solution point. The process continues with subsequent steps to map out the solution. Single-step methods (such as Euler's method) refer to only one previous point and its derivative to determine the current value. Methods such as Runge‚ÄìKutta take some intermediate steps (for example, a half-step) to obtain a higher order method, but then discard all previous information before taking a second step. Multistep methods attempt to gain efficiency by keeping and using the information from previous steps rather than discarding it. Consequently, multistep methods refer to several previous points and derivative values. In the case of linear multistep methods, a linear combination of the previous points and derivative values is used.  Definitions  Numerical methods for ordinary differential equations approximate solutions to initial value problems of the form : y' = f(t,y), \\\\quad y(t_0) = y_0. The result is approximations for the value of y(t) at discrete times t_i : : y_i \\\\approx y(t_i) \\\\quad\\\\text{where}\\\\quad t_i = t_0 + i h, where h is the time step (sometimes referred to as \\\\Delta t ) and i is an integer. Multistep methods use information from the previous s steps to calculate the next value. In particular, a linear multistep method uses a linear combination of y_i and f(t_i,y_i) to calculate the value of y for the desired current step. Thus, a linear multistep method is a method of the form : \\\\begin{align} & y_{n+s} + a_{s-1} \\\\cdot y_{n+s-1} + a_{s-2} \\\\cdot y_{n+s-2} + \\\\cdots + a_0 \\\\cdot y_n  & \\\\qquad {} = h\\\\cdot\\\\left( b_s \\\\cdot f(t_{n+s},y_{n+s}) + b_{s-1} \\\\cdot f(t_{n+s-1},y_{n+s-1}) + \\\\cdots + b_0 \\\\cdot f(t_n,y_n) \\\\right)  & \\\\Leftrightarrow \\\\sum_{j=0}^s a_jy_{n+j} = h\\\\sum_{j=0}^sb_jf(t_{n+j},y_{n+j}), \\\\end{align} with a_s=1. The coefficients a_0, \\\\dotsc, a_{s-1} and b_0, \\\\dotsc, b_s determine the method. The designer of the method chooses the coefficients, balancing the need to get a good approximation to the true solution against the desire to get a method that is easy to apply. Often, many coefficients are zero to simplify the method. One can distinguish between explicit and implicit methods. If b_s = 0 , then the method is called \\"explicit\\", since the formula can directly compute y_{n+s} . If b_s e 0 then the method is called \\"implicit\\", since the value of y_{n+s} depends on the value of f(t_{n+s}, y_{n+s}) , and the equation must be solved for y_{n+s} . Iterative methods such as Newton's method are often used to solve the implicit formula. Sometimes an explicit multistep method is used to \\"predict\\" the value of y_{n+s} . That value is then used in an implicit formula to \\"correct\\" the value. The result is a predictor‚Äìcorrector method.  Examples  Consider for an example the problem : y' = f(t,y)=y, \\\\quad y(0) = 1. The exact solution is y(t) = \\\\mathrm{e}^t . = One-step Euler = A simple numerical method is Euler's method: : y_{n+1} = y_n + hf(t_n, y_n). \\\\, Euler's method can be viewed as an explicit multistep method for the degenerate case of one step. This method, applied with step size h = \\\\tfrac{1}{2} on the problem y' = y , gives the following results: : \\\\begin{align} y_1 &= y_0 + hf(t_0, y_0) = 1 + \\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\cdot1 = 1.5,  y_2 &= y_1 + hf(t_1, y_1) = 1.5 + \\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\cdot1.5 = 2.25,  y_3 &= y_2 + hf(t_2, y_2) = 2.25 + \\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\cdot2.25 = 3.375,  y_4 &= y_3 + hf(t_3, y_3) = 3.375 + \\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\cdot3.375 = 5.0625. \\\\end{align} =Two-step Adams‚ÄìBashforth= Euler's method is a one-step method. A simple multistep method is the two-step Adams‚ÄìBashforth method : y_{n+2} = y_{n+1} + \\\\tfrac{3}{2} hf(t_{n+1},y_{n+1}) - \\\\tfrac{1}{2} hf(t_n,y_n). This method needs two values, y_{n+1} and y_n , to compute the next value, y_{n+2} . However, the initial value problem provides only one value, y_0 = 1 . One possibility to resolve this issue is to use the y_1 computed by Euler's method as the second value. With this choice, the Adams‚ÄìBashforth method yields (rounded to four digits): : \\\\begin{align} y_2 &= y_1 + \\\\tfrac32 hf(t_1, y_1) - \\\\tfrac12 hf(t_0, y_0) = 1.5 + \\\\tfrac32\\\\cdot\\\\tfrac12\\\\cdot1.5 - \\\\tfrac12\\\\cdot\\\\tfrac12\\\\cdot1 = 2.375,  y_3 &= y_2 + \\\\tfrac32 hf(t_2, y_2) - \\\\tfrac12 hf(t_1, y_1) = 2.375 + \\\\tfrac32\\\\cdot\\\\tfrac12\\\\cdot2.375 - \\\\tfrac12\\\\cdot\\\\tfrac12\\\\cdot1.5 = 3.7812,  y_4 &= y_3 + \\\\tfrac32 hf(t_3, y_3) - \\\\tfrac12 hf(t_2, y_2) = 3.7812 + \\\\tfrac32\\\\cdot\\\\tfrac12\\\\cdot3.7812 - \\\\tfrac12\\\\cdot\\\\tfrac12\\\\cdot2.375 = 6.0234. \\\\end{align} The exact solution at t = t_4 = 2 is \\\\mathrm{e}^2 = 7.3891\\\\ldots , so the two-step Adams‚ÄìBashforth method is more accurate than Euler's method. This is always the case if the step size is small enough.  Families of multistep methods  Three families of linear multistep methods are commonly used: Adams‚ÄìBashforth methods, Adams‚ÄìMoulton methods, and the backward differentiation formulas (BDFs). = Adams‚ÄìBashforth methods = The Adams‚ÄìBashforth methods are explicit methods. The coefficients are a_{s-1}=-1 and a_{s-2} = \\\\cdots = a_0 = 0 , while the b_j are chosen such that the methods have order s (this determines the methods uniquely). The Adams‚ÄìBashforth methods with s = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are (; ): : \\\\begin{align} y_{n+1} &= y_n + hf(t_n, y_n) , \\\\qquad\\\\text{(This is the Euler method)}  y_{n+2} &= y_{n+1} + h\\\\left( \\\\frac{3}{2}f(t_{n+1}, y_{n+1}) - \\\\frac{1}{2}f(t_n, y_n) \\\\right) ,  y_{n+3} &= y_{n+2} + h\\\\left( \\\\frac{23}{12} f(t_{n+2}, y_{n+2}) - \\\\frac{16}{12} f(t_{n+1}, y_{n+1}) + \\\\frac{5}{12}f(t_n, y_n)\\\\right) ,  y_{n+4} &= y_{n+3} + h\\\\left( \\\\frac{55}{24} f(t_{n+3}, y_{n+3}) - \\\\frac{59}{24} f(t_{n+2}, y_{n+2}) + \\\\frac{37}{24} f(t_{n+1}, y_{n+1}) - \\\\frac{9}{24} f(t_n, y_n) \\\\right) ,  y_{n+5} &= y_{n+4} + h\\\\left( \\\\frac{1901}{720} f(t_{n+4}, y_{n+4}) - \\\\frac{2774}{720} f(t_{n+3}, y_{n+3}) + \\\\frac{2616}{720} f(t_{n+2}, y_{n+2}) - \\\\frac{1274}{720} f(t_{n+1}, y_{n+1}) + \\\\frac{251}{720} f(t_n, y_n) \\\\right) . \\\\end{align} The coefficients b_j can be determined as follows. Use polynomial interpolation to find the polynomial p of degree s-1 such that : p(t_{n+i}) = f(t_{n+i}, y_{n+i}), \\\\qquad \\\\text{for } i=0,\\\\ldots,s-1. The Lagrange formula for polynomial interpolation yields : p(t) = \\\\sum_{j=0}^{s-1} \\\\frac{(-1)^{s-j-1}f(t_{n+j}, y_{n+j})}{j!(s-j-1)!h^{s-1}} \\\\prod_{i=0 \\\\atop i e j}^{s-1} (t-t_{n+i}). The polynomial p is locally a good approximation of the right-hand side of the differential equation y' = f(t,y) that is to be solved, so consider the equation y' = p(t) instead. This equation can be solved exactly; the solution is simply the integral of p. This suggests taking : y_{n+s} = y_{n+s-1} + \\\\int_{t_{n+s-1}}^{t_{n+s}} p(t)\\\\,dt. The Adams‚ÄìBashforth method arises when the formula for p is substituted. The coefficients b_j turn out to be given by : b_{s-j-1} = \\\\frac{(-1)^j}{j!(s-j-1)!} \\\\int_0^1 \\\\prod_{i=0 \\\\atop i e j}^{s-1} (u+i) \\\\,du, \\\\qquad \\\\text{for } j=0,\\\\ldots,s-1. Replacing f(t, y) by its interpolant p incurs an error of order hs, and it follows that the s-step Adams‚ÄìBashforth method has indeed order s The Adams‚ÄìBashforth methods were designed by John Couch Adams to solve a differential equation modelling capillary action due to Francis Bashforth. published his theory and Adams' numerical method . = Adams‚ÄìMoulton methods = The Adams‚ÄìMoulton methods are similar to the Adams‚ÄìBashforth methods in that they also have a_{s-1} = -1 and a_{s-2} = \\\\cdots = a_0 = 0 . Again the b coefficients are chosen to obtain the highest order possible. However, the Adams‚ÄìMoulton methods are implicit methods. By removing the restriction that b_s = 0 , an s-step Adams‚ÄìMoulton method can reach order s+1 , while an s-step Adams‚ÄìBashforth methods has only order s. The Adams‚ÄìMoulton methods with s = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 are (; ): : y_{n+1} = y_n + h f(t_{n+1},y_{n+1}), This is the backward Euler method : y_{n+1} = y_n + \\\\frac{1}{2} h \\\\left( f(t_{n+1},y_{n+1}) + f(t_n,y_n) \\\\right), This is the trapezoidal rule : \\\\begin{align} y_{n+2} &= y_{n+1} + h \\\\left( \\\\frac{5}{12} f(t_{n+2},y_{n+2}) + \\\\frac{2}{3} f(t_{n+1},y_{n+1}) - \\\\frac{1}{12} f(t_n,y_n) \\\\right) ,  y_{n+3} &= y_{n+2} + h \\\\left( \\\\frac{9}{24} f(t_{n+3},y_{n+3}) + \\\\frac{19}{24} f(t_{n+2},y_{n+2}) - \\\\frac{5}{24} f(t_{n+1},y_{n+1}) + \\\\frac{1}{24} f(t_n,y_n) \\\\right) ,  y_{n+4} &= y_{n+3} + h \\\\left( \\\\frac{251}{720} f(t_{n+4},y_{n+4}) + \\\\frac{646}{720} f(t_{n+3},y_{n+3}) - \\\\frac{264}{720} f(t_{n+2},y_{n+2}) + \\\\frac{106}{720} f(t_{n+1},y_{n+1}) - \\\\frac{19}{720} f(t_n,y_n) \\\\right) . \\\\end{align} The derivation of the Adams‚ÄìMoulton methods is similar to that of the Adams‚ÄìBashforth method; however, the interpolating polynomial uses not only the points t_{n-1},\\\\dots, t_{n-s} , as above, but also t_n . The coefficients are given by : b_{s-j} = \\\\frac{(-1)^j}{j!(s-j)!} \\\\int_0^1 \\\\prod_{i=0 \\\\atop i e j}^{s} (u+i-1) \\\\,du, \\\\qquad \\\\text{for } j=0,\\\\ldots,s. The Adams‚ÄìMoulton methods are solely due to John Couch Adams, like the Adams‚ÄìBashforth methods. The name of Forest Ray Moulton became associated with these methods because he realized that they could be used in tandem with the Adams‚ÄìBashforth methods as a predictor- corrector pair ; had the same idea. Adams used Newton's method to solve the implicit equation . = Backward differentiation formulas (BDF) = : The BDF methods are implicit methods with b_{s-1} = \\\\cdots = b_0 = 0 and the other coefficients chosen such that the method attains order s (the maximum possible). These methods are especially used for the solution of stiff differential equations.  Analysis  The central concepts in the analysis of linear multistep methods, and indeed any numerical method for differential equations, are convergence, order, and stability. = Consistency and order = The first question is whether the method is consistent: is the difference equation : \\\\begin{align} & y_{n+s} + a_{s-1} y_{n+s-1} + a_{s-2} y_{n+s-2} + \\\\cdots + a_0 y_n  & \\\\qquad {} = h \\\\bigl( b_s f(t_{n+s},y_{n+s}) + b_{s-1} f(t_{n+s-1},y_{n+s-1}) + \\\\cdots + b_0 f(t_n,y_n) \\\\bigr), \\\\end{align} a good approximation of the differential equation y' = f(t,y) ? More precisely, a multistep method is consistent if the local truncation error goes to zero faster than the step size h as h goes to zero, where the local truncation error is defined to be the difference between the result y_{n+s} of the method, assuming that all the previous values y_{n+s-1}, \\\\ldots, y_n are exact, and the exact solution of the equation at time t_{n+s}. A computation using Taylor series shows that a linear multistep method is consistent if and only if : \\\\sum_{k=0}^{s-1} a_k = -1 \\\\quad\\\\text{and}\\\\quad \\\\sum_{k=0}^s b_k = s + \\\\sum_{k=0}^{s-1} ka_k. All the methods mentioned above are consistent . If the method is consistent, then the next question is how well the difference equation defining the numerical method approximates the differential equation. A multistep method is said to have order p if the local error is of order O(h^{p+1}) as h goes to zero. This is equivalent to the following condition on the coefficients of the methods: : \\\\sum_{k=0}^{s-1} a_k = -1 \\\\quad\\\\text{and}\\\\quad q \\\\sum_{k=0}^s k^{q-1} b_k = s^q + \\\\sum_{k=0}^{s-1} k^q a_k \\\\text{ for } q=1,\\\\ldots,p. The s-step Adams‚ÄìBashforth method has order s, while the s-step Adams‚ÄìMoulton method has order s+1 . These conditions are often formulated using the characteristic polynomials : \\\\rho(z) = z^s + \\\\sum_{k=0}^{s-1} a_k z^k \\\\quad\\\\text{and}\\\\quad \\\\sigma(z) = \\\\sum_{k=0}^s b_k z^k. In terms of these polynomials, the above condition for the method to have order p becomes : \\\\rho(\\\\mathrm{e}^h) - h\\\\sigma(\\\\mathrm{e}^h) = O(h^{p+1}) \\\\quad \\\\text{as } h\\\\to 0. In particular, the method is consistent if it has order at least one, which is the case if \\\\rho(1)=0 and \\\\rho'(1)=\\\\sigma(1). = Stability and convergence = The numerical solution of a one-step method depends on the initial condition y_0 , but the numerical solution of an s-step method depend on all the s starting values, y_0, y_1, \\\\ldots, y_{s-1} . It is thus of interest whether the numerical solution is stable with respect to perturbations in the starting values. A linear multistep method is zero- stable for a certain differential equation on a given time interval, if a perturbation in the starting values of size Œµ causes the numerical solution over that time interval to change by no more than KŒµ for some value of K which does not depend on the step size h. This is called \\"zero-stability\\" because it is enough to check the condition for the differential equation y' = 0 . If the roots of the characteristic polynomial œÅ all have modulus less than or equal to 1 and the roots of modulus 1 are of multiplicity 1, we say that the root condition is satisfied. A linear multistep method is zero-stable if and only if the root condition is satisfied . Now suppose that a consistent linear multistep method is applied to a sufficiently smooth differential equation and that the starting values y_1, \\\\ldots, y_{s-1} all converge to the initial value y_0 as h \\\\to 0 . Then, the numerical solution converges to the exact solution as h \\\\to 0 if and only if the method is zero-stable. This result is known as the Dahlquist equivalence theorem, named after Germund Dahlquist; this theorem is similar in spirit to the Lax equivalence theorem for finite difference methods. Furthermore, if the method has order p, then the global error (the difference between the numerical solution and the exact solution at a fixed time) is O(h^p) . Furthermore, if the method is convergent, the method is said to be strongly stable if z=1 is the only root of modulus 1. If it is convergent and all roots of modulus 1 are not repeated, but there is more than one such root, it is said to be relatively stable. Note that 1 must be a root for the method to be convergent; thus convergent methods are always one of these two. To assess the performance of linear multistep methods on stiff equations, consider the linear test equation y' = Œªy. A multistep method applied to this differential equation with step size h yields a linear recurrence relation with characteristic polynomial : \\\\pi(z; h\\\\lambda) = (1 - h\\\\lambda\\\\beta_s) z^s + \\\\sum_{k=0}^{s-1} (\\\\alpha_k - h\\\\lambda\\\\beta_k) z^k = \\\\rho(z) - h\\\\lambda\\\\sigma(z). This polynomial is called the stability polynomial of the multistep method. If all of its roots have modulus less than one then the numerical solution of the multistep method will converge to zero and the multistep method is said to be absolutely stable for that value of hŒª. The method is said to be A-stable if it is absolutely stable for all hŒª with negative real part. The region of absolute stability is the set of all hŒª for which the multistep method is absolutely stable . For more details, see the section on stiff equations and multistep methods. = Example = Consider the Adams‚ÄìBashforth three-step method :y_{n+3} = y_{n+2} + h\\\\left( {23\\\\over 12} f(t_{n+2}, y_{n+2}) - {4 \\\\over 3} f(t_{n+1}, y_{n+1}) + {5\\\\over 12}f(t_{n}, y_{n})\\\\right). One characteristic polynomial is thus :\\\\rho(z)=z^3-z^2=z^2(z-1)\\\\, which has roots z=0, 1, and the conditions above are satisfied. As z=1 is the only root of modulus 1, the method is strongly stable. The other characteristic polynomial is \\\\sigma(z) = \\\\frac{23}{12}z^{2} - \\\\frac{4}{3}z + \\\\frac{5}{12} First and second Dahlquist barriers These two results were proved by Germund Dahlquist and represent an important bound for the order of convergence and for the A-stability of a linear multistep method. The first Dahlquist barrier was proved in and the second in . =First Dahlquist barrier= A zero-stable and linear q-step multistep method cannot attain an order of convergence greater than q + 1 if q is odd and greater than q + 2 if q is even. If the method is also explicit, then it cannot attain an order greater than q . =Second Dahlquist barrier= There are no explicit A-stable and linear multistep methods. The implicit ones have order of convergence at most 2. The trapezoidal rule has the smallest error constant amongst the A-stable linear multistep methods of order 2.

It concerned the constitutional validity of Part IIID of the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Act 1991,. which regulated political advertising during election campaigns, and required broadcasters to broadcast political advertisements free of charge at other times. The High Court found the laws to be invalid, since they contravened an implied freedom of political communication in the Australian Constitution. Background to the case In 1992, the Government of Australia (\\"the Commonwealth\\") under Prime Minister Bob Hawke passed the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Act 1991, which inserted part IIID into the Broadcasting Act 1942. The changes had a number of effects, the most important of which prohibited the broadcasting of politically related material on electronic media such as radio and television during the period leading up to a State or Federal election (except in news, current affairs or talkback programs). The laws also obliged broadcasters to provide \\"free time\\" to political parties to air advertisements. Kim Beazley, then the Minister for Transport and Communications, said that the changes were designed to limit corruption, and prevent donors to political parties from exerting undue influence, by restricting the amount of political advertising that could be broadcast. He said that due to the practical cost of advertising, it was only the major parties and very wealthy individuals who could afford to broadcast advertisements. The Government said they had wanted to avoid a situation such as that in the United States, where it is virtually impossible for anyone but the very rich to participate in the political process. With some exceptions, the laws prohibited broadcasters from broadcasting matter for or on behalf of the government or government agencies, and from broadcasting political advertisements (\\"matter intended or likely to affect voting in the election\\", or matter explicitly referring to the election) on behalf of themselves or other individuals during an election period. The \\"free time\\" would be divided between the parties based on the amount of representation they had in the Parliament, with only five percent available to other groups, who had to apply for an allocation of free time. The eight plaintiffs in the case were commercial television broadcasters who held broadcasting licences under the Broadcasting Act. They asked the High Court to declare that Part IIID of the act was invalid. In a related action which was heard at the same time, the Government of New South Wales also challenged the laws, particularly their application to by-elections. The Government of South Australia intervened in the case in support of the Commonwealth. The case The most important argument made by the plaintiffs was that the new laws interfered with a right to free political speech which was implied in the Constitution. They also argued that the parts of the Act requiring that broadcasters give \\"free time\\" to certain people was an unjust acquisition of property. The Government of New South Wales argued that the laws were discriminatory against the states and they interfered with the proper business of State Governments. =Freedom of speech= The principal argument from the plaintiffs was that the changes to the Broadcasting Act contravened an implied right to freedom of participation and communication in political processes. They argued that this right to free political speech arose from the system of representative government which is provided by the Constitution, or alternatively, it arose from the \\"common citizenship of the Australian people.\\" Sir Maurice Byers QC, who acted for the plaintiffs, paraphrasing former Justice Isaac Isaacs argued that the principle that governments are responsible to the citizens who elect them \\"permeates the Constitution, forming part of the fabric on which the written words of the Constitution are superimposed,\\" and as such, all voters should be entitled to make comment on political issues. The plaintiffs argued that since a right to free political communication was recognised in other parliamentary democracies, such as in the United States by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, and in Canada by the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, it should be recognised in Australia. They said that because the provisions in Part IIID limited the allocation of \\"free time\\" to people or groups already represented in the Parliaments, new parties or people not in the Parliament would not be able to express their views. The Commonwealth argued that the laws enhanced rather than diminished the electoral process, because they prevented corruption, and allowed parties which did not have large amounts of money to have access to radio and television broadcasting. They said that the Parliament has valid powers to protect the integrity of the electoral process under sections 10, 29, 31, 51(36) and 51(39) of the Constitution. Furthermore, they argued that even if there was some implied right to freedom of political communication, this could not override valid legislation. The Commonwealth also pointed out that similar laws operated in countries such as the United Kingdom, France, Norway and Sweden, and that countries such as Canada, Germany, Japan and New Zealand had a system of allocating free broadcasting time for political purposes during election periods. The Government of South Australia, who intervened in support of the Commonwealth, said that if the framers of the Constitution had intended to include provisions for a right of free speech as in the United States Constitution, they would have done so. They said that although some freedom of communication could reasonably be implied into the Constitution, the parts of the Act in question did not have the effect of preventing \\"free and meaningful elections\\" from taking place, and so the laws were not invalid. The High Court agreed that the new part IIID of the Broadcasting Act had the effect of limiting the freedoms previously enjoyed by citizens to publicly discuss political matters. However, the question remained as to whether there was some sort of Constitutional basis for these freedoms, or whether the Commonwealth was justified in restricting them. While the court agreed that similar laws had been put in place overseas, that did not change the fact that the laws impaired freedom of communication, and privileged those political parties or interest groups who were already represented in the Parliament. The laws would not only disadvantage candidates challenging sitting members, but would severely hinder groups such as trade unions, charities or employers' groups, who may very well have a legitimate desire to make political statements. =Acquisition of property= The plaintiffs also argued that to force broadcasters to give portions of \\"free time\\" to the represented political parties and members of parliament had the effect of taking away their right to charge money for broadcasting advertisements. They suggested that taking away their advertising time and in effect giving it to the legislators constituted an acquisition of property by the Commonwealth, which according to section 51(xxxi) of the Constitution, has to be done \\"on just terms.\\" The Commonwealth argued that the laws made no unjust acquisition of property, since broadcasting licences were not immune to being modified by the Parliament. They said that it was fair and just to require broadcasters to provide a limited amount of free service in the public interest. In any event, the Commonwealth suggested that \\"free time\\" granted by the Act was not a form of property anyway, since it could not be transferred to other people, one of the essential features of any form of property. Ultimately the court did not decide on this issue, although Justice Brennan said that he agreed with the Commonwealth's argument that the \\"free time\\" was not a form of property. =Interference with State rights= The Government of New South Wales, in addition to supporting the claims of the other plaintiffs, also argued that Part IIID of the Broadcasting Act was invalid because it interfered with the executive functions of the States, and contravened sections 106 and 107 of the Constitution which protects the individual State Constitutions. They said that to interfere with the right of State Governments to make political advertisements went far beyond any legitimate power given to the Parliament of Australia by the Constitution. They also said that in any event, the changes to the Act should not apply to by-elections. The Commonwealth argued that Part IIID of the Act did not single out the States, nor interfere with their proper activities, since State elections were treated in exactly the same way as Federal elections were. The decision The court decided that a right to freedom of political communication was essential to the system of representative government provided for in the Constitution. at 37. The court expressed the view that the reason why Australia does not have a bill of rights is because the framers of the Constitution believed that since Australia had a system of representative government, which gave all voters an equal share in political power, laws to protect rights were simply not necessary. To undermine the system of representative government was contrary to this trust which the people gave to the Parliaments, and was not permitted by the Constitution. Although this right is not an absolute one, it is still a right which allows for free and public political discussion. The court also decided that the relevant laws, contained in Part IIID of the Broadcasting Act, were invalid because there was no reasonable justification for the way they restricted the freedom of political communication. The court decided that the laws also impaired certain functions of the States in terms of their rights to make political advertisements, and so the laws were also invalid for that reason. Consequences The case was one of the earliest in a series of cases in which the High Court found implied rights in the Constitution. This trend reached a High-point in Theophanous v Herald & Weekly Times Ltd,. which found that the implied right to freedom of political communication could be used as a defence in a defamation action. Although that is no longer the case, the limited right to freedom of communication remains. It was emphasised in later cases like Lange v ABC,. that political communication was not a personal right, rather a constitutional restriction on legislative power. In discussing the nature of representative government, Chief Justice Mason expressed the view that although the Constitution originally drew its authority from the British Imperial Parliament, it would indeed be appropriate in modern times to recognise that Australian sovereignty derives its force from the Australian people.

He was the son of Guy of Montfort and Helvis of Ibelin (daughter of Balian of Ibelin). The coat of arms of Monfort-Castres is the coat of arms of Monfort, with a label of four points azure. Life At his father's death at the siege of Varilhes in the Albigensian Crusade in 1228, he succeeded to his French seigneuries. His first wife was Eleonore de Courtenay (d. bef. 1230), daughter of Peter II of Courtenay. Philip joined the party of his uncle, John of Ibelin, against the representatives of Frederick II. In 1244, he was created Constable of Jerusalem, but was subordinate to Walter IV of Brienne at the Battle of La Forbie. Philip was one of the few Christian knights to escape the disaster there. In 1246, Henry I of Cyprus, then Regent of Jerusalem, created him Lord of Tyre as a reward for his services to the baronial party. While the legality of this grant was somewhat dubious, it was recognized by Hugh I c. 1269; but Hugh reserved the right to buy back the fief. Philip was married a second time, after 1240, to Maria of Antioch- Armenia, the elder daughter of Raymond-Roupen of Antioch and hence Lady of Toron and pretender of Armenia. He joined the Seventh Crusade, and was employed as the ambassador of Louis IX of France in negotiations for a truce and retreat from Damietta. In 1256, he expelled the Venetians from Tyre, an action which helped to precipitate the War of St. Sabas. During that conflict, he attempted to relieve the Genoese in Acre in 1258, but was repulsed, which helped decide the struggle for the Venetians. In 1266, he lost Toron to the Sultan Baibars; but even in Philip's old age, Baibars feared both his energetic leadership and the possible success of his appeals to Europe for aid. In 1270, Philip was killed by an Assassin possibly in the employ of Baibars. He was succeeded by his son Philip II in his French possessions, and by his son John of Montfort in Outremer.

The serial is set on the interstellar cruise ship Empress. In the serial, drug smugglers Tryst (Lewis Fiander) and Dymond (Geoffrey Bateman) try to smuggle the deadly drug Vraxoin on the ship contained in alien beings called the Mandrels. Plot The TARDIS arrives close to an unstable area on the interstellar cruise ship Empress, which has emerged from hyperspace at the same co- ordinates as the trade ship Hecate, causing a dimensional crossover that the Fourth Doctor and Romana realise must be repaired. The Doctor offers his services to detach the two craft. Rigg, captain of the Empress, is suspicious of the Doctor's alias as a representative of Galactic Salvage but nevertheless agrees to let him try and separate the two craft by reversing the smaller craft at full thrust. The Doctor is accompanied on this task by Rigg's co- pilot, Secker, who, it becomes apparent, is a drug addict. He is addicted to the organic substance Vraxoin, whose origins are unknown, but whose properties are lethal and dangerous. Secker heads off alone into the unstable area and while there is attacked by a clawed monster and left for dead. K9 arrives from the TARDIS and is tasked with cutting through the locked ships. Also aboard the Empress are a zoologist named Tryst and his assistant Della, with their CET (Continual Event Transmuter) Machine, which stores portions of planets on electro-magnetic crystals. Their collection is large and ethically dubious. Their most recent stop was on the planet Eden where one of their expedition was killed, but both Tryst and Della are reluctant to provide too many details. Romana, however, examines the Eden projection when she is on her own and is sure she has seen eyes staring out at her from the dark and forbidding jungle. When she later looks at the projection again an insect appears from within it and stings her. The Doctor and Rigg find the wounded Secker and send him to the sickbay where he dies. When the Doctor finds Secker's drugs stash he is prevented from acting when someone stuns him and steals the evidence. Once he has recovered, he returns with Rigg and K9 to cut through the power source. Once a hole is made a roaring creature appears, flexing its vicious claws. K9 repels the creature with blaster fire while the Doctor and Rigg refit the segment of the craft. The Doctor continues to try to separate the two ships while also trying to source the Vraxoin on the craft. Rigg is positive there are no drugs on his craft, but events soon take a sinister turn, which proves him wrong. When Romana wakes up an unseen hand spikes her refresher drink with the drug, but it is Rigg who ends up drinking it. He soon starts to show signs of addiction and altered perception and heads off alone as his cravings grow. After the Doctor and K9 fail once more to separate the two ships, he spots a silver-suited stranger and pursues him through the passenger deck and into the blurred area between ships. The Doctor loses his quarry, but manages to relieve him of a radiation band, which he dropped and proves that he was on Tryst's expeditionary team in the past. The clawed monsters are loose near there. When the Doctor flees back to the Empress he discovers Rigg has become addicted and Tryst accuses Della of smuggling Vraxoin, in league with her late partner Stott, who was killed on Eden. Two Azurian Customs and Excise officers now board the craft, Fisk and Costa, and start to suspect the Doctor of smuggling because of the traces of Vraxoin in his pocket. The Doctor and Romana make a break for it and head to the CET Machine room where they evade capture by leaping directly into the projection. Inside the projection, the Doctor and Romana are menaced by the jungle plants and must hide to avoid the clawed monsters, which obviously originate from Eden and roam freely in this section of the planet. They soon meet up with the fugitive previously sighted by them both, Stott, who takes them to his sheltered cubicle. It seems that he is a Major in the Intelligence Section of the Space Corp and has been hiding in the projection for the past 183 days while he tries to establish the source of the Vraxoin, which he knows is from Eden but not from which organic source. He also names the vicious creatures as Mandrels. The trio exit the projection and return to find the Empress under siege from the marauding beasts, which have now started killing the passengers (as shown in the picture above). Rigg too is killed, shot down by Fisk during a mad search for Vrax. The Mandrels, on display at the Doctor Who Experience. The Doctor, Romana and K9 evade the creatures while trying once more to separate the two spacecraft. In the process, the Doctor incinerates one of the Mandrels, which disintegrates into raw Vraxoin. The beasts are evidently the source of the drug. He reapplies himself to the technical task and, with the help of his companions, the ships are finally parted ‚Äì but the Doctor disappears from the Empress in the process. The separation has been a success, with the elusive Dymond having returned to his own craft at the right time. Fisk warns him not to leave too quickly, but Dymond is keen to get away. The Doctor is also on the Hecate, having been caught up in the separation of the two ships, and, without being noticed, soon finds evidence of Dymond's complicity in the drug running project. Dymond returns to the Empress by shuttle, and the Doctor smuggles himself on board. Back on the Empress, Romana finds Della and confides in her that Stott is still alive, but Della is soon arrested by the Customs men and they are separated. The Doctor rejoins Romana on the Empress and says he has seen evidence that the smugglers are planning to use an intuca laser to transport the Eden projection between the two crafts. He is now certain that Dymond's ally is Tryst and, when Stott arrives, he also confirms the source of the Vraxoin. Fisk and Costa turn up to arrest the Doctor, but Stott pulls rank and warns them to back off. In another part of the craft, Tryst is reunited with Della and confesses all about his part in the smuggling racket. She flees when a Mandrel arrives and distracts Tryst, who is rapidly trying to escape with Dymond. They head back to the Hecate. The Doctor has meanwhile rounded up the Mandrels using K9's dog whistle, having worked out they are pacified by ultrasonics. He leads them all back into the projection and then slips out, leaving the creatures trapped. His next task is to reverse the CET transfer process to stop the smugglers getting away with the Vraxoin supply. After allowing Tryst and Dymond to transport the Eden projection to the Hecate, he activates the CET and traps them within a new projection ‚Äì they are ready for the Customs Officers to walk in and arrest them. With the ships separated and the drug runners caught, the Doctor and friends slip away back to the TARDIS with the Eden project. They restore everything to their home planets and can only hope no one else discovers the secret of the Mandrels. Production This story would be the final Doctor Who serial written by Bob Baker, who worked on it alone, rather than with his usual writing partner Dave Martin. Alan Bromly is credited with directing this story, but he quit partway through filming as a result of a vehement dispute with Tom Baker. As a result, producer Graham Williams wound up having to complete the director's duties uncredited. The unpleasantness of this whole incident led Williams to decide that he wished to leave the series. Bromly never directed another story for the series and in fact went into full retirement soon afterwards. Broadcast and reception The British tabloid newspaper The Sun wrote that the Mandrels were terrifying monsters, as no publicity shots had been taken for them (which, as later reported, was untrue). However, the majority of critics were more scathing and many of them saw the Mandrels as being thoroughly unconvincing (particularly the Doctor Who Appreciation Society, which described them as \\"cute rejects from The Muppet Show\\"). Writer Bob Baker on the recent DVD release also expressed his disappointment with the Mandrel design. Mark Braxton of Radio Times considered the serial to be \\"something of a flawed diamond\\". Braxton noted that the sets were \\"perfectly decent, for the most part\\" but thought the Mandrels were \\"the least frightening monster the show ever produced.\\" The review concluded by stating \\"Overall, this sobering, sideways take on Paradise Lost deserves respect, in conception and narrative if not always in the finished product.\\" MM Gilroy-Sinclair of Starburst said the show was \\"a story with some big ideas and some shoddy production values.\\" He was unimpressed by the Mandrels and the \\"plodding\\" story but praised the performances of Tom Baker and Lalla Ward. Despite his criticisms, Gilroy-Sinclair ended his review by stating \\"it actually has some wonderful moments, it is surprisingly mature; it‚Äôs clever and has some fabulous acting.\\" Cultbox's Malcolm Stewart described the serial as \\"Serious-minded but facetiously performed\\". However, he also stated that \\"For all the deficiencies in presentation, Nightmare of Eden is still a story with real science and genuine imagination at its heart.\\" Commercial releases =In print= A novelisation of this serial, written by Terrance Dicks, was published by Target Books in August 1980. =Home media= Nightmare of Eden was released on VHS in January 1999.

It originates at the northwest extremity of Lake Sevan and flows south through the Kotayk Province and Armenia's capital, Yerevan; the lake in turn is fed by several streams. In the Ararat plain it joins the Aras River along the border with Turkey. A series of hydro-electric plants have been constructed on the river. Its waters are in demand to irrigate crops. Names The river was called Ildaruni in Urartian. In Turkic it's known as Zangu, Zanga, Zangi, or Zengy (; ). Geography The Sevan Lakes (with 30 rivers contributing to its storage), the largest located in the central part of the country and the Hrazdan River which originates from it, together form the \\"Sevan-Hrazdan Management Area\\", which is one of the five sub-basins of the 14 sub-basins of Kura and Araks basins of Armenia. The river originates from the lake at an elevation of . The river which flows from the lake in a southern direction passes through a deep gorge as it enters on the western side of the Yerevan city, and then debauchees into the Aras River on the southern side of the city. The geological formations along the river course are made up of lava flows (existing as basalts) generated from three volcanoes in the Gegham range. The lava surfaces represent environments that existed in the form of \\"lakes, river channels and floodplains\\". The chronology of landscape of the upper most layer of basalts indicates an age of 200,000 years. The river drains a total catchment area of . Precipitation volume is 1572 million cubic metre from an annual rainfall of with a maximum of in May and a minimum of during August. The average temperature recorded in the basin varies from in January to in July with diurnal variation with the lowest night temperature of in January and highest day temperature of in July. The total flow in the river is 733 million cubic meter. The regulated outflow into the river, which forms the Ararat Valley, is utilized for irrigation and hydro-power benefits. File:Davtashen panorama.jpgA panorama of the Hrazdan River gorge and Davtashen from Arabkir, Yerevan =Fauna= The fauna reported from the river includes 33 species of chironomids and 23 species of blackflies. The chironomids belong to five subfamilies of Tanypodinae, Diamesinae, Prodiamesinae, Orthocladiinae, and Chironominae. 25 species of invertebrates comprising two species of rotifers, 13 species of cladocerans and 10 species of copepods have been recorded in the river. While the fish species contained in the lake consist of the Sevan trout (Salmo ischchan) or ‚ÄúPrince Fish,‚Äù siga, crucian, carp, crayfish, bojak (Salmo ischchan danilewskii) and winter bakhtak (Salmo ischchan ischchan) and summer bakhtak (Salmo ischchan aestivalis), the river is reported to have species of crayfish as well as karas and crayfish in abundance. Development The lake waters have been used for irrigation from the 19th century, and from early 20th century Hydro- power development has also been implemented. The lake waters were planned to be used through the river for irrigating in the Ararat Valley out of which an irrigation of was created. The hydro-power development was planned on the river as the Sevan‚ÄìHrazdan Cascade involving seven schemes in a stretch of the river with a total installed capacity of 560 MW with mean annual energy generation of around 500 million kilowatt hours; it is the largest hydro-power generating scheme in Armenia. This scheme was implemented between 1930 and 1962. These are small and medium size projects built as run-of-the river power plants. The seven power stations are: Sevan HEP with installed capacity of 34.2 MW with two units completed in 1949; the Hrazdan HEP of 81.6 MW with two units commissioned in 1959; the Argel HEP with installed capacity of 224 MW completed in 1953; the Arzni HEP with capacity of 70.6 MW with installation of 3 units commissioned in 1956; the Kanaker HEP with installed capacity of 100 MW with 6 units completed in 1936; the Yerevan-1 HEP commissioned in 1962 with installation of 44 MW with 2 units; and the Yerevan-3 with capacity of 5 MW with one unit commissioned in 1960. However, priority of release of water from the lake is for irrigation and accordingly the power stations are operated. The civil works involved construction of diversion works, open canals or tunnels and power house which over the years were in need of substantial rehabilitation as they were all built around the middle of the twentieth century. In 2003, the International Energy Corporation\\", a Closed Joint Stock Company, acquired the projects from the Public Services Regulatory Commission of the country under a license No. 0108 for generation of electrical energy. Right from the time of acquisition they started rehabilitating the projects to maximize power generation. The works were completed during 2004. The works were carried out under a US$25 million loan from the Asian Development Bank. River pollution The river water is polluted by effluent flows from agricultural, commercial, industrial, and residential development, but particularly by the untreated wastewater from Yerevan. This affects the water quality in the river with dissolved oxygen (DO) levels (less than 5% of the saturated dissolved oxygen level) remaining much lower than the permissible limits. A study carried out in 2008 indicates that a 16 km stretch of the river, from 2 km upstream of the Yerevan waste water outfalls to 14 km below, is insufficiently aerated to provide a healthy environment for aquatic life.

Sometimes spelled Ma-ayon, it is from Roxas City, the seat of the provincial government. Etymology As to the origin of the name of Maayon not much has been written about it, but folks speak of several versions and one among those considered most popular was when a group of Spanish soldiers while pursuing the insurgents, discovered a settlement near the bank of the river. Finding the people to be hospitable and nice, they asked for the name of the place. Since the natives did not understand the Spanish language, they assumed that what the Spaniards were asking for what is the status of the harvest, for them it was harvest time. The natives answered \\"Maayo man\\". So the Spaniards named the settlement \\"El Pueblo de Maayon\\". Thus, the name Maayon was derived from that word and to this very day, it is known as such. History Maayon first became a town during the early American era. However, during the Cadastral Survey, it was reverted to a barrio status under the Municipality of Pontevedra. For nearly half a century, the residents fought hard and long for its restoration to a separate and distinct entity. Their untiring efforts were empty rewarded when in 1955, Carmen Dinglasan Consing, representative of the first District of the Province of Capiz field House Bill No. 2098 in the lower chamber of Congress. Senator Justinano S. Monta√±o sponsored and steered the bill until its approval. Finally on March 30, 1955 President Ramon Magsaysay signed the bill re-creating the lot Municipality of Maayon, Capiz in a ceremony held in Malaca√±an.

Pan-ay is the site of the famous coral-stone Santa Monica Church, home to the largest Catholic Church bell in Asia. History The town originally called Bamban was changed by the early Spaniards to Panay, a word which means ‚Äúmouth of the river.‚Äù This is also the location of a fortress built by Juan de la Isla in late 1570. The Paseo de Evangelizacion 1566 can be found in the town plaza and was erected through the efforts of Rev. Msgr. Benjamin F. Advincula. 1566 was the year the Spaniards arrived in the island of Panay and became the second Spanish settlement in the country next to Cebu. Miguel Lopez de Legazpi transferred the Spanish settlement from Cebu to Panay in 1569 due to the lack of food. The town was formally founded in 1572 (1581 according to Jorde), although by that time Legazpi had moved the capital of the Philippines, further north, to Manila. Fr. Bartolome de Alcantara was named the prior of the town with Fr. Agustin Camacho as assistant. A prosperous town due to trade, Pan-ay became capital of captivating Capiz for two centuries, until Capiz was named capital. The town name was eventually given to whole island. After 1607, Fr. Alonso de M√©ntrida, noted for his linguistic studies and Visayan dictionary became prior. In the 18th century, Pan-ay was famous for its textile industry which produced a cloth called suerte and exported to Europe. In the 19th century, Don Antonio Roxas, grandfather of Pres. Manuel Roxas, opened one of the largest rum and wine distilleries in the town. The Augustinians held the parish until 1898, when administration transferred to the seculars. The first church was built before 1698 when it is reported that a typhoon had ruined it. In 1774, Fr. Miguel Murgu√≠a rebuilt the church, but it was later damaged by a typhoon on 15 January 1875. Fr. Jose Beloso restored the church in 1884. The church is best known for its 10.4 ton bell popularly called dakong lingganay (big bell). The bell was cast by Don Juan Reina who settled in Iloilo in 1868. Reina who was town dentist was also noted as a metal caster and smith. The bell was cast at Pan-ay from 70 sacks of coins donated by the townspeople. The bell was completed in 1878. It bears an inspiring inscription which translated reads: ‚ÄúI am God‚Äôs voice which shall echo praise from one end of the town of Pan-ay to the other, so that Christ‚Äôs faithful followers may enter this house of God to receive heavenly graces.‚Äù Barangays Panay is politically subdivided into 42 barangays.

History The coastal town sprang out from an Austronesian settlement in the early 16th century when indio natives managed to escape oppression from Spanish colonial authorities. The settlement was then known as Sibala, named after the river that ran through the coastal village. In 1570, however, the settlement was seized by Spanish forces and the guardia civil took full control of the village fortifying it with a military garrison. It later flourished into a bigger town and was renamed after its designated patron La Nuestra Se√±ora del Pilar (Our Lady of the Pillar). In the 18th century, it adopted the (Holy Trinity) La Santisima Trinidad as its municipal patron after a wooden image of the Holy Trinity from the wreckage of a Spanish galleon ship en route from Mexico was found in the town's coastline. Augustinian friars were initially assigned to preach in the town since then until it would later receive its permanent parish priest and Roman Catholic Church. In 1887, there had been an armed insurgency known as the Battle of Balisong during the Philippine Revolution in an attempt to overthrow Spanish authorities in the municipality led by local revolutionaries with the support of other resistance groups in Capiz, namely from the neighboring towns of Pan- ay and Pontevedra. In 1949, the sitios and barrios of Aranguel, Culilang, Pandan, Pinamihagan, Cadoulan, Quiajo, Sangcal, Pondol, Marita, Madulano, Jabuyana, Bo-ac, Cabugcabug, Goce Badiangon, Bayuyan, Agbobolo, Cubay, Ibaca, and the sitio of Lotudlotud, which was converted into a barrio of Elizalde, were separated from the municipal jurisdiction of Pilar to form a separate town, namely President Roxas, by virtue of Republic Act No. 374. Barangays Pilar is politically subdivided into 24 barangays. Climate Demographics In the , the population of Pilar, Capiz, was people, with a density of . Most of the town's population are made up by Austronesian descendants, such as Capiznon and Hiligaynon, followed by Aetas and a few of Chinese and Spanish ancestry. Culture Roman Catholicism combined with indigenous superstitious traditions have a strong imprint on the town's local culture. An iconic 12-foot landmark of the Virgin Mary is visible at a mountaintop in Barangay Dulangan, built by an affluent Filipino-Chinese businessman from Roxas City. A chapel facing the figurine has been erected where occasional thanksgiving masses are held during special occasions. The town celebrates its annual feast along with the coming of the sacred Santisima Trinidad (The Holy Trinity), an early 18th-century wooden figurine from Mexico found by local fishermen in the shores of the town during the British invasion of the Philippines in 1762. The figurine is believed to have been brought over by a galleon trading ship from the port of Acapulco, Mexico, but destroyed by British warships on its route to Luzon and was washed off to the coast of Pilar. It is on display in the altar of the town's church, the Parish of the Most Holy Trinity. The town also has its own Baptist church, Iglesia Filipina Independiente and Iglesia ni Kristo Parish. The barangays of Dulangan and Casanayan are known to be satellite villages of the municipality. The town is also known for its rich heritage oral folklore and supernatural practices. The Legend of the Golden Ship, a trading ship owned by deities that docks on the town's coast en route to a parallel world and the enchanted Balisong Caves inhabited by beautiful fairies but highly territorial are popular stories that have been passed down for generations. Barangay Casanayan is home to the mummified corpse of Lola Bebe or Maria de Juan Basa√±es, a migrant from Cavite who married a town local but died from heart attack in 1929 only to be found fully intact in her grave several decades later. The cadaver is believed to be miraculous as it has healed many residents from illness and is preserved by family descendants for public viewing. Economy Pilar has an income classification of third class. Development in basic infrastructure has been stagnant during the last decades. Annual income is low and poverty rates are said to be high, although the town has also seen greater years. The rural municipality is said to be rich in natural resources such as aquatic and mineral wealth. It used to be a strong seafood producer in the province and once even possessed its own sugar and mining industry. Major agricultural produce of the town include fish, prawn, crab, rice, sugar, cattle and poultry. Other notable industries include shell craft and wood furniture.

The community is home to Feliza, a binukot who has expertise in chanting the suguidanon, one of the most significant epic chants of the Western Visayas region. Feliza is the last known person who can speak the Ligbok language in her community, making her the last bastion for the thousand-year old language in Tapaz. Her death would translate to the death of the language in Tapaz itself and the suguidanon epic chant as well. Also, Feliza has traditional tattoos on her skin which were inscribed when she was chosen as a binukot. In 2016, after reports came out on the dying Ligbok language and suguidanon epic chant, the government began documenting the language and epic chant and teaching the language to younger generations of Panay-Bukidnon in Tapaz.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oR8ApbrjA-s Marugo lake in San Antonio barangay is most popular tourist destination. History The first people who arrived and settled in what is now Tapaz are the Panay-Bukidnon people who speak the indigenous Ligbok language. When the Spanish arrived in Panay, they established Dumalag town. Eventually, Tapaz was founded in 1835 but it continued being a part of Dumalag town for many years. In 1862 and 1863 two letters were made to declare parish under the patronage of St. Jerome. Both were signed by Governor General Lemery, but they were never executed. Finally, in 1874, Tapaz was declared an independent parish by Jaro Bishop Mariano Cuartero. In 2016, the Ligbok language of the Panay-Bukidnon of Tapaz was confirmed to be dying out. This triggered a massive conservation program for the language and the epic chant spoken by the Panay- Bukidnon.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oR8ApbrjA-s Geography Tapaz lies within the latitude 11¬∞ 09‚Äô to 11¬∞ 09‚Äô 42\\" and the longitude of 121¬∞ 11‚Äô to 122¬∞ 34‚Äô 45\\".

(then called the Caterpillar Tractor Company). It was the first modern tractor to use the elevated drive sprocket to improve durability, operator comfort, and ease of maintenance. History The Caterpillar D10 was the result of a need for a tractor larger than the Caterpillar D9. At this time, competitors were building bulldozers that were more powerful than the D9. Allis Chalmers introduced at Conexpo 69 in Chicago a HD-41 which was the largest crawler in the world. In 1974 after AC and Fiat merged their construction equipment divisions the 524 hp 41-B was introduced. For example, the Fiat-Allis 41-B track-type tractor had at the time, while the D9H had . In 1976 Japanese company Komatsu came out with an even larger bulldozer called the D455A at and . The first pilot D10 was D10X1 and was shown in July 1973 at a big Caterpillar corporate meeting. Other prototypes would follow in 1975 and 1977. In March 1977, prototypes P-1 through P-10 would appear and be subsequently dispatched to different job sites. The D10 was introduced at a dealer meeting by Caterpillar in the fall of 1977. Between 1978 and 1986 nearly 1,000 D10s were made at Caterpillar's East Peoria plant. The D10 had sales of their Fiat-Allis/Komatsu competitive sized bulldozers combined. With the introduction of the N-Series tractors in 1986-87 their model numbers were pushed up. For example, the D9N replaced the D8L, the D10N replaced the D9L and the D11N replaced the D10. The D10 was so big that it could do about 50 percent more production than the D9H. High Drive system CAT D10N at work in Rishon LeZion, Israel Among modern tractors, the High Drive (elevated sprocket) design is unique to Caterpillar products. The concept originated in 1914 with Caterpillar predecessor C. L. Best Tractor's 30 Humpback; this tractor was discontinued a year later, and the only other tractor to use the concept until the D10's introduction was the Cletrac Model F, built between 1920 and 1922. The elevated sprocket system was first applied to a 10-machine test run of the D10 in 1977.\\"Cat‚Äôs elevated sprocket that changed the dozer market\\", Equipment Journal, September 19, 2017 It separated the suspension from the tractor's drive train, dramatically reducing stress on both and increasing their durability.Caterpillar Equipment: High Drives and Final Drives Prior to this, the combined system, which put the drive axle under constant strain of the vehicle's load and terrain beneath it, was prone to frequent failure. Elevating the drive sprocket allowed for a more absorbent suspension, which provided better traction, reduced component wear and operator fatigue, and isolated the drive sprocket in a flexible section of the machine's tracks. It also allowed for the relocation of the transmission behind and beneath the operator, providing better weight distribution and improved traction, and permitting more compact location of both the blade and rear implements. The high-drive system also eliminates the traditional geared final drive in favor of modular system employing a hydraulic planetary final drive, which withstands engine torque better, since it distributes the forces over multiple gear teeth instead of a single tooth as in the traditional system. The disadvantage is that the track moves around one more idler, reducing track life. Caterpillar claims to have alleviated this with the SALT (Sealed and Lubricated Track), a permanently lubricated track system which was introduced on their track-type tractors in the early 1970s. Introduction When the D10 was introduced in 1977, it was the most powerful track-type tractor ever built at . The Cat D10 could be ordered with up to a U-blade, and weighed in at . Later versions weighed in at . The U-blade was high and could push according to Caterpillar's literature. The November 1977 issue of Excavating Contractor magazine had a 2-page story on the bulldozer titled \\"Cat Uncorks The New D10\\". One of the first D10s is currently sitting in front of the East Peoria, Ill plant where it was made. A picture of this D10 can be found on pages of a book titled \\"The Caterpillar Century\\" on pages 298-297. Caterpillar put the 1,786 cid V-12 twin turbocharged D348 in the D10 to power it. This had already proven itself in the 777 off-highway hauler and the 550 hp 10 yard 992/992B wheel loaders from 1968 on. The early D10s came with a single big black exhaust stack up front. But some engine problems came up with exhaust system routing which resulted in two exhaust stacks up front to correct this problem. This new look took root in 1980. At the time Caterpillar's bulldozer lineup was the D3, D4E, D5B, D6D, D7G, D8K, and D9H with the addition of the D10. In 1986 an even larger dozer, the Caterpillar D11N was introduced to replace the D10. The D11 carried on the success of the elevated drive sprocket system in large bulldozers. The currently available D10T model, and preceding D10R and D10N variants, are not the original D10's successors but the D11N, D11R and the current D11T are.

The Viet Cong (also known as the National Liberation Front, or NLF), a South Vietnamese communist common front, aided by the North, fought a guerrilla war against anti-communist forces in the region. The People's Army of Vietnam, also known as the North Vietnamese Army (NVA), engaged in a more conventional war, at times committing large units to battle.

History Dr. Sbaitso was distributed with various sound cards manufactured by Creative Labs (the name was an acronym for Sound Blaster Artificial Intelligent Text to Speech Operator) in the early 1990s. The program \\"conversed\\" with the user as if it were a psychologist, though most of its responses were along the lines of \\"WHY DO YOU FEEL THAT WAY?\\" rather than any sort of complicated interaction. When confronted with a phrase it could not understand, it would often reply with something such as \\"THAT'S NOT MY PROBLEM\\". Dr. Sbaitso repeated text out loud that was typed after the word \\"SAY\\". Repeated swearing or abusive behavior on the part of the user caused Dr. Sbaitso to \\"break down\\" in a \\"PARITY ERROR\\" before resetting itself. The program introduced itself with the following lines: HELLO [UserName], MY NAME IS DOCTOR SBAITSO. I AM HERE TO HELP YOU. SAY WHATEVER IS IN YOUR MIND FREELY, OUR CONVERSATION WILL BE KEPT IN STRICT CONFIDENCE. MEMORY CONTENTS WILL BE WIPED OFF AFTER YOU LEAVE, SO, TELL ME ABOUT YOUR PROBLEMS. The program was designed to showcase the digitized voices the cards were able to produce, though the quality was far from lifelike. Additionally, there was a version of this program for Microsoft Windows through the use of a program called Prody Parrot; this version of the software featured a more detailed graphical user interface.

In 1924, tragedy struck and her father died of pneumonia, then her mother died six months later.https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:MMBH-6LK In 1917, she enrolled to study chemistry at Indiana University, graduating with Phi Beta Kappa, Sigma Xi, and other honors. She also attended graduate school which she eventually left after marrying Alfred Kinsey. She first met him briefly when he visited Indiana University before joining the faculty and they met again at a zoology department picnic in 1920. The couple were married from 3 June 1921 until Alfred's death in 1956. Alfred was bisexual and polyamorous. Clara and Kinsey had an open relationship.

It is a resident breeding species from southern Florida, the Caribbean, parts of Central America, south to western Ecuador, Brazil, northern Argentina and southern Chile. It was introduced to Gal√°pagos around the 1960s and is potentially impacting native and endemic species across the archipelago. Description The smooth-billed ani is a mid-sized species, larger on average than the groove-billed ani but smaller than the greater ani. It measures in length and weighs . The adult is mainly flat black, with a long tail, deep ridged black bill and a brown iris. The flight is weak and wobbly, but the bird runs well and usually feeds on the ground. This species is called \\"el pijul\\" in Venezuelan folklore. It is mentioned in the popular Veracruz song \\"El Pijul\\". Habitat This ani is found in open and semi-open country and areas under cultivation. The nest, built communally by several pairs, is a deep cup lined with leaves and placed usually high in a tree. A number of females lay their chalky blue eggs in the nest and then share incubation and feeding. This common and conspicuous species has greatly benefited from deforestation. Breeding Each female is capable of laying up to seven eggs, and nests have been found containing up to 29 eggs, but it is rare for more than ten to hatch. Incubation is 13‚Äì15 days, with another 10 days to fledging. Up to three broods may be raised in a season, with the young of earlier broods helping to feed more recent chicks.

It was created as a lobby group to promote independent candidates before the 1940 general election. The Conservative and Liberal parties, and the more conservative remnants of the United Farmers, recognizing the widespread popularity of the Social Credit party, ran joint candidates as independents in what was called the \\"Independent Movement\\" or the \\"Unity Movement\\". Calgary mayor Andrew Davison was named leader. At the 1940 election, Independent candidates won 42 per cent of the vote, only 1,400 fewer votes than Social Credit. However, not all these were anti-SC activists belonging to the AUM/ICA. Some were actual independent candidates running under their own steam. Be that as it may, the Independent Movement did have considerable support and did elect 19 MLAs. The \\"party\\" might have done better but for their support being spread out across the province and not concentrated enough in specific districts to translate into seats, especially outside the cities. (In the cities the STV-PR system in use ensured they would receive their fair portion of city seats.) In some rural districts, Independents lost races to Socred incumbents by small margins, despite the AV system in use in rural districts in those days. And Social Credit was returned for a second term. The Independents did, however, succeed in slashing Social Credit's previous crushing majority; the Socreds won only 36 seats, down from 56 when the writs were dropped. Independent candidates won 19 seats, enough to make Davison Leader of the Official Opposition. The Liberal Party under leader Edward Gray chose only to support Independent candidates that it played a hand in nominating and it nominated other candidates under its own banner, one of whom was elected to a seat. Gray felt that candidates should not be 'machined' into the field and left it up to individual Liberal constituency associations to support Unity Movement candidates or to put forward their own Liberal candidates. Many former supporters of the United Farmers joined the Co- operative Commonwealth Federation which ran its own candidates, none of whom were elected. A Labor candidate A.J. Morrison was elected in the coal-mining area of Edson. The campaign ads for the Independents typically read: \\"Be Independent of the new \\"Social Order\\". Vote Independent! Paid for by the Independent Citizen's Association of Alberta.\\" In 1944, James H. Walker, an Independent MLA who had been a United Farmers candidate, was elected the first permanent leader of the Independents over David Elton. Strains within the coalition had begun to take their toll with Liberal MLAs leaving the caucus before the beginning of that year's legislative session. The Liberals chose not to run separately in the general election, however, and Walker led the Independents into the 1944 provincial election but the party failed to run a full slate of candidates. Only three Independent MLAs were elected, and Walker lost his own seat. In 1945, the Independents chose J. Percy Page as their leader and he became Leader of the Opposition. He led the party, now called the Independent Citizen's Association, into the 1948 election, but by that time the Liberals had left the coalition and ran their own slate of candidates. The party received only 1.35% of the vote, losing all of its seats. The party folded, and the Conservative Party re-emerged in the 1950s.

Its current population is about 50,000. Geography Elvis Presley Boulevard Whitehaven is a neighborhood in South Memphis and is roughly bounded by Brooks Road on the north and the Mississippi state line on the south, with the Illinois Central Railroad on the west and Airways Boulevard on the east. The major traffic artery of the community is U.S. Route 51, later known as Elvis Presley Boulevard. This roadway began as a toll \\"Plank Road\\" built between Memphis and Hernando, Mississippi in 1852. Whitehaven is no longer its own city, but a part of Memphis. History The community takes its name from a Colonel Francis White, who was an early settler and major property owner. White was influential in getting a rail line to run through what was first called White's Station, later Whitehaven. This Mississippi and Tennessee Railroad was chartered in 1853, and the first trains ran in 1856. The first \\"White Haven\\" post office was opened in 1871. The roads and train tracks connected the cotton farms of the Mississippi Delta to Memphis markets, establishing strong commercial links. Some of the other founding family names are Raines, Hale, McCorkle, and Harbin. E. W. Hale moved to the area in the 1880s and opened a store near what is now Whitehaven High School on Elvis Presley Blvd. Hale's Store was a landmark for many decades. In 1926, WREC radio began operations there, and in 1928 Whitehaven Hoyt B. Wooten was one of the first six television licensees in America. His original home is the centerpiece of a private development called Lion's Gate. Much of the later residential and commercial development was done by Carrington Jones and Lacy Mosby in the mid 20th century, to provide housing for \\"baby boom\\" families who moved from Memphis to a pleasant environment in the old community. This gradually transformed plantation tracts to neighborhoods in the late 1940s and 1950s. Originally a farm community, Whitehaven was developed as a residential suburb of Memphis in the 1950s and early 1960s. In 1950 Whitehaven had a population of 1,311.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Atlas, 1958 Edition, p. 411 In 1960 Whitehaven had a population of 13,894.World book Encyclopedia, 1967 Edition, Vol. 18, p. 115 Whitehaven was annexed by the city of Memphis January 1, 1970. It was integrated in the late 1960s and white flight ensued over the next two decades. Whitehaven is now a part of South Memphis. Education Four high schools are in the Whitehaven area: Fairley High School, Hillcrest High School, Pathways In Education, and Whitehaven High School. Whitehaven High School was opened by 1911 with evidence of the Memphis public library, Digg Memphisschool dating back to 1893 and was the only high school in the community until Hillcrest opened during the 1960s. A strong rivalry developed between the two schools, and the Hillcrest/Whitehaven game became one of the major events in the community during football season. Bishop Byrne, a private co-educational Catholic high school adjacent to Saint Paul Church on Shelby Drive, opened in 1966 and closed in 2013. =Public Schools in 38116 (Whitehaven)= * Whitehaven High School * Hillcrest High School (Green Dot Charter system affiliate) * Havenview Middle School * A.

Elvis Presley bought his famous home in 1957; soon afterward the farmland surrounding the estate was subdivided into homesites. During the two decades he lived in Whitehaven, Elvis spent as much time as possible at his home and was a beloved neighbor to residents there. =Southland Mall= For the next decade there was rapid development, with Whitehaven Plaza shopping center becoming the area's commercial center. Southland Mall opened at the corner of Shelby Drive and Elvis Presley Blvd in 1966 and is still a destination for shoppers from all over the region. It greatly helped the community to prosper. Southland Mall was the first enclosed mall in Memphis. =David Carnes Park= Located on Whitehaven Lane, the park is named for the early African-American landowner and blacksmith David Carnes, whose property is now the site of the park. David Carnes park underwent a $5.4 million renovation by BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee and reopened in August of 2019. The park includes a splash pad, playground, walking paths, fitness equipment, obstacle course, turfed multipurpose field, and multiple pavilions.

Thurman (born January 12, 1951) is a former U.S. Representative from Florida. She is a Democrat.Congressional background Early life and education She was born on January 12, 1951 in Rapid City, South Dakota, but has spent most of her life in Florida. She received her associate degree from Santa Fe College in Gainesville in 1970 and later her bachelor's degree in education from the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida in 1973. She is married to John Thurman. They have two children, McLin (Macky) and Liberty Lee, and make their home in Dunnellon, Florida. Early political career Thurman was first elected to public office in 1974, when she won a seat on the city council of Dunnellon, Florida, on which she served until 1983. She served as Mayor of Dunnellon from 1979 to 1981. She served in the Florida State Senate from 1983 to 1993. Congresswoman Florida gained three congressional districts after the 1990 census. One of them was the 5th District, which stretched from Gainesville to the far northern portion of the Tampa Bay Area. It was an open secret that this district was drawn for Thurman. She was elected to the House from that district in 1992 and was reelected four more times with no serious opposition. Thurman was recognized as an expert on health, veterans, and tax issues. She was only the sixth woman to serve on the House Ways and Means Committee. On Ways and Means she fought for lower prescription drugs, increased access to health insurance, and tax relief. Prior to her appointment to Ways and Means in 1996, Congresswoman Thurman served on both the House Agriculture Committee and the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight. After the 2000 census, the Republican-controlled Florida legislature reconfigured the 5th to make it friendlier to Republicans. She lost heavily Democratic Gainesville and surrounding Alachua County while picking up some heavily Republican territory between Tampa and Orlando. The new 5th contained much of the territory located in the State Senate district of that body's President Pro Tem, Ginny Brown-Waite. Nonetheless, Thurman ran for reelection. Even though the redrawn district had gone narrowly for George W. Bush in 2000 (Al Gore had won her old district handily), Thurman just barely lost to Brown-Waite. Since Thurman left office, the Democrats have cleared the 40 percent barrier in the district, now numbered as the 11th, only once. Post-Congress career In 2005 Thurman was elected Chairman of the Florida Democratic Party (FDP), succeeding Chairman Scott Maddox, who resigned in order to seek the Democratic nomination for governor.Elected chair of FDP Thurman resigned on November 12, 2010 following the midterm elections.Resigned as chair of FDP Thurman is a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One.

It is the most extensively investigated terrestrial isopod species. Description Armadillidium vulgare may reach a length of , and is capable of rolling into a ball when disturbed; this ability, along with its general appearance, gives it the name pill-bug and also creates the potential for confusion with pill millipedes such as Glomeris marginata. It can be distinguished from Armadillidium nasatum and Armadillidium depressum by the gap that A. nasatum and A. depressum leave when rolling into a ball; A. vulgare does not leave such a gap. Ecology Armadillidium vulgare is able to withstand drier conditions than many other woodlouse species, and is restricted to calcareous soils or coastal areas. It feeds chiefly on decaying plant matter, but also grazes lichens and algae from tree bark and walls. It is able to regulate its temperature through its behaviour, preferring bright sunshine when temperatures are low, but remaining in shadow when temperatures are high; temperatures below or above are lethal to it. A. vulgare is less susceptible to cold during the night, and may enter a state of dormancy during the winter in order to survive temperatures that would otherwise be lethal. Distribution The native distribution of A. vulgare ranges across Europe, especially in the Mediterranean Basin. In the United Kingdom, A. vulgare is very common in southern and eastern England, but is more confined to coastal areas in the north. Similarly, in Ireland, A. vulgare is common in the south and east, but rarer in the north and west. A. vulgare has also been introduced to many locations in North America, where it may reach population densities of up to 10,000 individuals per square metre. It is now one of the most abundant invertebrate species in California coastal grassland habitats. It has also been introduced, to a lesser extent, to sites across the world. Relationships with humans Because of their unusual yet non-threatening appearance, some Armadillidium vulgare are kept as pets in areas throughout the U.S., typically among children. Different lineages are bred, usually in regards to color, in order to provide stock to hobbyists. One supposed variation, \\"Punta Cana,\\" is often referred to as Armadillidium sordidum, while others insist it is a variety of A. vulgare. Keeping a pet pill bug requires a very moist habitat with limited light and abundant decaying botanical matter. They can often live up to three years. Among non- hobbyist adults, they are often seen as unwanted (but essentially harmless) home pests. Mitochondrial genome Most metazoans have circular mitochondrial genomes, but A.vulgare has an unusual combination of both circular and linear mitochondrial DNA.

According to the , it has a population of people. It was created in 1769. History In the summer of 1578, the natives of Tala-ugis trudged up from the coast to establish a settlement northward in the interior along Suage River.Iloilo History Part 1 - Research Center for Iloilo The first settlers were led by families of Gamuk, Hutikon, Uganet and Pagdakton, who settled themselves in what is currently known as barangays Matag-ub, Danao, Yabon and Quipot. More than a century later, Spaniards came along these parts of Panay. Early in 1738, Datu Buhawi of Yabon recognized the Spanish government, thus subjugating himself and his barangay to Spanish rule. But, Datu Dumagtol of nearby Ubian refused to follow suit. He led his subjects to the mountains to resist against the Spanish colonizers. The Spanish governor Francisco Bayot de Ocampo recommended to the Principal√≠a to transfer the seat of government, and in the following year (1770), the settlements were strengthened in their administration in what they called \\"Janiuay\\". While there is no certainty, there are several legends of how the place got its name. One is that it came from the ruling Datu's sons named \\"Han\\" and \\"Oway\\". Another is that the words \\"hani\\" (whisper) and \\"oway\\" (rattan) were combined. A strong typhoon followed by heavy rain in June 2008 caused the Suage river to overflow, damaging river bank communities and infrastructures. The flooding caused the river to be re-drawn and encroached the river banks by about 200 meters from its original location. Suage bridge remains structurally sound despite the flooding and encroachment. Geography Two rivers coming from the north-west cuts in parallel through Janiuay. One is the Suage River and the other is the Magapa River which provide natural irrigation supporting the mainly agricultural town of Janiuay. The Suage river bridge was once witness to fierce fighting between Japanese Imperial forces and the combined Filipino and American troops including the recognized Ilonggo guerrilla fighters. The Magapa river bridge was built after World War II. Janiuay is from Iloilo City. Barangays Janiuay is politically subdivided into 60 barangays. = Santo Tomas = Santo Tomas approximate population is 500-800. Santo Tomas (Pakol to locals) is bounded by Madong in the east, Mangil in the north-east and Danao in the south west. It is accessible by three class C feeder roads in the east, south-west and south- east. Agriculture centers around rice, corn, coffee, beans, sugar cane, and copra. Traces of sweet mango farms are starting to gain roots especially close by the public elementary school. General topography is flat rice fields on the east and hill-valley-hill dotted by bamboos, coffee, mango, banana, coconuts and other fruit tree crops in the remaining areas. Water source are via deepwells and rice produce is primarily dependent on rainfall. Motorbike and tricycle are the easiest mode of transportation and also four-wheels during festive events. Ride is some 30 minutes from the town proper. Electricity is subscribed by 15-25% of the population. Wireless cellphone carrier SMART covers the area and is generally available in 20-25% of the population. English language is generally understood and spoken fairly by locals in certain situation with foreigners. Danao-Santo Tomas Elementary School established during the 1950s is located on the highest hill of the surrounding barangays and view of rice fields in the east is impressive especially in the morning. An old artesian well stands within the school grounds - part of an effort to secure deep water for the school in the 1960s (WVA). = Danao = Pueblo Danao has a history. It was established by Fr. Eugenio Moya in 1766. It lasted for eight years until Fr. Moya was forced to move to adjacent Pueblo Yabon for fear on his life on errant moros and the locales. The moros and the locales set camp in the forest of Danao away from forced labor edict from Spanish Principalia and administered by priests of Poblacion Janiuay. The moros and the locales raised in arms against Catholic conversion and had attempted to poison and kill Fr. Moya. Pueblo Danao became a prized possession disputed by Pueblo Quipot and Principalia Masin (now Maasin) because of its rich farmland in the west bounded by the Suage river and the rumor about rich mineral deposits in the hills of Kantong (now Danao Gantong). When Pueblo Quipot was moved to Poblacion Janiuay in 1769, Pueblo Danao was downgraded to a barrio and became part of Janiuay. Danao is divided into three mini locales (mini-barrangay), Danao I, Danao 2 and Danao Gantong. Each mini barangay has about a population of 300- 400. Danao is bounded by Santo Tomas (North-West), Mangil (North), Madong (East), Tambal (South-West),Calmay (West), Caraudan (West) and Aguingay (South-West). It is accessible by two class C feeder roads from Poblacion Janiuay in the east, south-west and south-east. Agriculture centers around rice, corn, coffee, beans, sugar cane, and copra. Traces of sweet mango farms are starting to gain roots especially close by the public elementary school. General topography is flat rice fields on the east and hill-valley-hill dotted by bamboos, coffee, mango, banana, coconuts and other fruit tree crops in the remaining areas. Water source are Suage river in the south-west and via deepwells and seasonal rainfall in the east. Four wheels are a means of transportation including motorbike and tricycle. Ride is some 30 minutes from the town proper. Electricity is subscribed by 15-25% of the population. Wireless cellphone carrier SMART covers the area and is generally available in 20-25% of the population. English language is generally understood and spoken fairly by locals in certain situation with foreigners. Danao-Santo Tomas Elementary School established during the 1950s straddles Sto- Tomas and Danao Gantong. An old artesian well stands north of the school grounds - part of an effort to secure deep water for the school in the 1960s (WVA). It is believed that the well was an exploratory bore hole to determine and analyze the mineral content of the sub-surface of the surrounding area. Bore hole samples including sediment samples from surrounding open wells (Rapo, Brasileno, Casiple) were collected and sent for analysis. No new samples are requested by the Bureau of Mines. lorenzo arillo is the longest brgy. captain of brgy. danao (1960-2003). = Matag-ub = Matag-ub was formerly Pueblo Binogsukan in 1766. Aetas set camp in these areas helping the Moros raid and fight wars with the Augustinian priests Marin, Carvajal, Gorrosari and Llorente of Poblacion Janiuay for forced labor erecting the churches and cemetery of Poblacion Janiuay. =Climate= Demographics In the , the population of Janiuay was people, with a density of . Economy Cultivation of rice, corn, sugar, copra, coffee, banana, abaca fiber, fowls (and gamefowls), goat and cattle raising are the main sources of livelihood. Commerce for these products are generally brought into the town proper for market. The rainfall generally dictate the commerce of these products as the river go dry in summer months. Most of these are coming from the west, north- west and south-west of the town. Transportation and telecommunications Janiuay can be accessed from all directions with good paved concrete and asphalt road infrastructures from the east, north and south. Mode of transport can either be jeeps, motorcycles fitted with cabs for 2-5 persons locally known as tricycles for inter barangay transport. Intertowns are plied by buses, jeeps and private vans. Within the town, \\"trysikad\\" - a bicycle fitted with a cab for 2 people are commonly available. Communication is generally available with nationwide carriers such as PLDT, Globelines and Smart competing with local and aging analog Pantelco. Electricity is sourced from electric cooperative Ileco II supplying 75% of the town proper and about 25% of the neighboring barangays.  Landmarks  =Heritage buildings= Janiuay prides itself on two heritage infrastructure dating back from 1760. The Janiuay Catholic Church was built of sandstone, limestone and layered bricks and was completed in February 1770. Its belfry used to carry three magnificent bells, the largest weighing close to a ton. World War II damaged the belfry, and the bells were lowered to ground after the war. The largest bell crashed down during the relocation and suffered a crack in length from its lip upwards. When sounded it gives a distinct baritone rattling sound that can be heard for miles. It is now mounted in the new church's belfry built in the late 60s. Another heritage infrastructure is the Janiuay Cemetery. It was built much later, in 1870, and is also walled with ancient sandstone and bricks brought from distant locale some 30 km away in what is now known as the town of Dingle. Spanish Fr. Llorente directed the construction of this cemetery in the Gothic design of his time. The Janiuay town cemetery is located a kilometer east of Janiuay Catholic Church. Janiuay is also home to several heritage mini sugar mills owned by landed Spanish mestizos and Swiss descent. These mini sugar mills have seen their own time and once produces brown sugar. Wrought steel rotary crushers driven by water buffaloes or carabaos extract sugar from canes and cooked in large vat until brown and solid. =Other landmarks= * Janiuay Old Prison and Town Hall - Post Hispanic infrastructure with walls and wrought iron bars. * Janiuay Pilot Elementary School - established before World War II * Janiuay National Vocational School - (Now West Visayas State University - Janiuay Campus) - established before World War II. * Janiuay Protestant Church - First outside of Iloilo City * Iglesia ni Cristo Church in Barangay Jibolo * Janiuay Public Market * Janiuay Cattle Market - the only in Iloilo Province. * Janiuay Town Hall and Plaza * Janiuay Public Library * St. Elizabeth Academy (Now St. Julian Academy) established in the 1960s * Janiuay Emergency Hospital.

To the north of the Benedict Canyon neighborhood is the neighborhood of Sherman Oaks, to the west is the neighborhood of Beverly Glen, to the east are Beverly Park and Franklin Canyon, and to the south is the city of Beverly Hills.Benedict Canyon Association, map Geography Benedict Canyon is a ravine that drops in a north-to-south direction from its high point at the crest line in the Santa Monica Mountains; to the east of the Canyon are its two sisters, Franklin Canyon and Coldwater Canyon. Rainwater percolating over the ancient strata of all three canyons emerges at their lowest altitude as the springs feeding Franklin's Lake and Creek. A cross- section of the land reveals granite, of volcanic origin, layered between worn river rocks and ocean bottom mud. In upper Benedict Canyon are the subdivisions of Benedict Hills, which consists of 107 homes,Benedict Hills HOA and Benedict Hills Estates, which consists of 229 homes between Deep Canyon and Mulholland Drive, just east of Hutton.Benedict Hills Estates Association History Benedict Canyon was a part of Rancho de las Aguas (\\"Ranch of the Waters\\"), which also included present-day Beverly Hills. It was named by Edson A. Benedict, a storekeeper and native of Boonville, Missouri, who took a homestead in the Canyon in 1868. With help from his wife and sons, E. A. Benedict built an apiary that was so bountiful that in one year, they were reported to have made a single shipment of of honey from Santa Monica Pier. One of Mr. Benedict's sons, Pierce E. Benedict, later went on to be elected to the city of Beverly Hills Board of Trustees at the time of its incorporation. In August 1969, the Tate Murders took place in Cielo Drive. Sharon Tate, Roman Polanski's pregnant wife, and four others were killed by followers of Charles Manson at the couple's 10050 Cielo Drive home. The place was later renamed 10066 Cielo Drive, and ultimately the house was razed, and another erected in its place. Author and LSD enthusiast Timothy Leary spent the last years of his life in a house in Benedict Canyon, where he died in 1996. Sunset Residences Homes range from smaller one-story family residences to large properties. Homes are predominantly single-family and owner-occupied and have two or more bedrooms. The median year in which the homes were built is 1960. Vegetation and plants Cielo Drive in Benedict Canyon Benedict Canyon has a mix of vegetation and growth that is endemic to Southern California - oaks and grasses on the lower slopes, and chaparral and lupine on the higher hillsides. Along nearby Franklin's Creek can be found sycamores, ferns and vines. Evergreens, such as pines, cypresses, deodars and eucalyptus, were planted as settlers moved in, and built homes and parks. Vegetation types within the Santa Monica Mountains range from moist coastal canyon bottoms in the Santa Monica Mountains, to desert transitional areas at the headwaters of the Santa Clara River. With the exception of the areas that border the Mojave Desert, all of the vegetation within the zone is influenced by the effects of the Pacific Ocean. The resulting cool, wet winters and hot, dry summers create a Mediterranean-type ecosystem. By far, the dominant vegetation sub-type is chaparral. Chaparral is composed of drought- and fire-tolerant evergreen shrubs that range in height from four to ten feet. Unless recently subjected to fire, or some other type of disturbance, this plant community is generally too dense to penetrate. Another unique shrub community to Southern California is sage scrub, which varies between coastal and inland types. Sage scrub vegetation contains fewer stout, woody shrubs, and more openings with fine, delicate plants. The expansive valley floors between the mountain ranges were plowed and farmed long ago. They are now entirely developed. The precise former native plant cover of the San Fernando, Simi and Santa Clarita Valleys was never adequately recorded. It is suspected that native perennial bunch grasses were dominant elements. Throughout the zone, over ninety-five percent of the native grasslands have been displaced by foreign invasive plants. The most common riparian (stream-related) woodland species are various willows, coast live oak, California sycamore, and Fremont's cottonwood. Less common species that are relics of the last Ice Age include white alder, bigleaf maple, and black cottonwood. On slopes, and in valleys where rainfall concentrates, groves of evergreen coast live oaks are common throughout Benedict Canyon. These evergreen oaks provide food and shelter for numerous species of wildlife. Deeper soiled areas in the Santa Susana Mountains, the Simi Hills and the Santa Monica Mountains support the deciduous valley oak. A widely dispersed tree in the Santa Monica Mountains, and to a lesser extent in other ranges, is the California black walnut. Wildlife The animal population is pretty much the same as it was 10,000 years ago. Grizzly bears are an exception, as they were killed off by early settlers of the area. The most common medium-sized and large mammals are coyotes, mule deer, bobcats, raccoons, and skunks. Just away from the urban edge, other predators, such as grey fox, mountain lion, American badger, long-tailed weasel, and ringtailed cat, occupy various niches. The ecosystem's top predator, the mountain lion, is present everywhere except the fragmented eastern end of the Santa Monica Mountains that bisects the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Because they fear humans, however, they are rarely seen. Also, there are numerous prey species‚Äîsuch as rabbits, squirrels, rats, mice, and other rodents. Seven species of hawks, eight species of owls, peregrine falcons, golden eagles, northern harriers, American kestrels, and white-tailed kite share in this bounty of prey. Benedict Canyon is also part of the Pacific Flyway. As a result, the resident Southern California bird species often share company with neo-tropical migrants and other species, such as Canada geese. There are over eighteen species of snakes and eight species of lizards. The most common snakes are pacific rattlesnake, gopher snake, California king snake, and California striped racer. The rattlesnake is the only venomous snake in California. They seek shade during the hottest summer afternoons and hibernate during the winter. The zone supports five species of frogs, three species of toads, and five species of newts and salamanders. As in most parts of the world, frog populations have declined, probably due to climate change and pollution. The widely scattered perennial streams still support unique populations of native fish. Topanga and Malibu Creeks contain tidewater gobies, arroyo chub, and the endangered Southern California Distinct Population Segment of steelhead. The Santa Clara River supports these species as well as the federally listed endangered, unarmored three spine stickleback. Some of the upper reaches of the Los Angeles River at the foot of the San Gabriel Mountains harbor populations of the Santa Ana sucker and speckled dace. Community The Benedict Canyon Association (BCA), started in 1948, is an example of neighborhood activism. The BCA is dedicated to preserving the beauty, safety, environment and quality of life in the Canyon. Because of their early efforts, Benedict Canyon remains the only canyon that is 100% residential. The Hillside Ordinance to limit building height at and stipulate restrictions on set-back, side yards or parking, was a product of Association lobbying and participation. That ordinance was also the basis of the recent defeat of the proposed villa on top of the Mark Hughes hilltop, an event cheered by many residents. Current and past beautification projects of the Association include the repair and repaving of roads, repainting of guardrails, repair of Upper Benedict Canyon, and a subsidized monthly service of clearing debris and trimming vegetation that spills on the roadway. \\"Adopt Fire Station 99\\" is another community grass roots organization representing about 9,000 residents in the Mulholland-Benedict Canyon area. Going hand-in- hand with the BCA, residents helped to generate the media attention, popular support, and political will that defeated the city's plan to reduce from two to one the number of paramedics available at each Fire Station to deliver emergency care. Celebrities A number of celebrities live or have lived in Benedict Canyon. Some of them are: Fire danger Bottlenecks on the neighborhood's narrow canyon roads have been noted as a primary concern. As part of the plan, the Department of Transportation tows away cars that are parked illegally on narrow hillside streets on \\"red flag days,\\" when fire danger is high. When fire conditions reach the critical red flag level‚Äî wind and relative humidity below 15%‚Äîillegally parked vehicles that restrict access are ticketed and towed. Fire departments notify residents by raising red flags over the 103 fire stations in Los Angeles. Over the last ten-plus years (2015), the maximum number of Red Flag days per year was 12.Fire Department - Red Flag Day Parking Restriction  City of Los Angeles The normal range is between four and seven days per year. Brush clearance is a year-round responsibility to those homeowners living in Benedict Canyon. Fire officials said that both the foliage and the lack of recent fires in the area are cause for concern, not comfort, noting the Oakland Hills fire of October 1991 that killed 25 and destroyed 3,276 residences under similar conditions.

Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter pointed out that Tate and Polanski first met on the set of The Fearless Vampire Killers (1967). Also, while admiring the view, Don is startled by the howling of coyotes outside the house, evoking two additional Tate references: Tate dined there with Abigail Folger, Wojciech Frykowski, and Jay Sebring, at 8 p.m. on the night they were later murdered, and Megan assures Don the wild animals are not as close as they sound: \\"It's just what happens to the sound in the canyons,\\" she says, sharply echoing the second line of Helter Skelter: The True Story of the Manson Murders (1974), which reads, \\"The canyons above Hollywood and Beverly Hills play tricks with sounds.

It is considered to be a key stamp in any collection of US stamps. The stamp was issued to fulfill a need for a reduced rate, 2-Cent denomination for newspaper, magazine, and local deliveries; and was often used to \\"make up\\" higher rates, or split in half to make up lower ones (a 1-Cent stamp) due to shortages at the local post office. During the Civil War, the \\"Black Jack\\" was supposed to have been favored by both North and South, but as soon as the South got news of the North making a stamp depicting one of their own heroes, they printed a 2-Cent stamp depicting the same portrait of Jackson on their own 'Red Jack' postage stamp in reaction. After the War was over, poverty inspired people to wash off the cancellation from the stamps and attempt to use them again. The Government then decided to put an antitheft device onto the stamps known as a grill. This grill, which consisted of various rows of tiny indentations into the stamps, was supposed to make it impossible to wash off the cancellations without being detected; but people usually got around this by bisecting the stamp, and then reusing that portion that didn't have a cancellation on it. The first grill applied to a Black Jack stamp is known as the \\"Z\\" grill, introduced in January 1868. Over the next few months, the Post Office successively employed three smaller grill patterns (D, E and F) in the production of this stamp.

A banzai charge is the term used by the Allied forces to refer to Japanese human wave attacks and swarming mounted by infantry units. This term came from the Japanese cry , shortened to banzai, specifically referring to a tactic used by Japanese soldiers during the Pacific War.  Origin  The charge of Saig≈ç Takamori inspired the government that the charge was their final, honorable action. The banzai charge is considered to be one method of , a suicide attack, or suicide before being captured by the enemy such as seppuku. The origin of the term is a classical Chinese phrase in the 7th-century Book of Northern Qi, which states \\"\\", \\"A true man would [rather] be the shattered jewel, ashamed to be the intact tile.\\"http://chinesenotes.com/beiqishu/beiqishu041.html Among the rules there existed a code of honor that was later used by Japanese military governments. With the revolutionary change in the Meiji Restoration and frequent wars against China and Russia, the militarist government of Japan adopted the concepts of Bushido to condition the country's population to be ideologically obedient to the emperor. Impressed with how samurai were trained to commit suicide when a great humiliation was about to befall them, the government educated troops that it was a greater humiliation to surrender to the enemy than to die. The suicide of Saig≈ç Takamori, the leader of old samurai during the Meiji Restoration, also inspired the nation to idealize and romanticize death in battle and to consider suicide an honorable final action. During the Siege of Port Arthur human wave attacks were conducted on Russian artillery and machine guns by the Japanese which ended up becoming suicidal. Since the Japanese suffered massive casualties in the attacks, one description of the aftermath was that \\"[a] thick, unbroken mass of corpses covered the cold earth like a coverlet\\". In the 1930s, the Japanese found this type of attack to be effective in China. It became an accepted military tactic in the Japanese army where numerically weaker Japanese forces, using their superior training and bayonets, were able to defeat larger Chinese forces. The Japanese here did not face massed automatic weapons but rather the bolt action rifle of the Chinese, which could not fire as rapidly as a machine gun.  In World War II  Imperial Japanese Army soldiers lie dead on the sandbar at the mouth of Alligator Creek on Guadalcanal after being killed by US Marines during the Battle of the Tenaru, August 21, 1942 During the war period, the Japanese militarist government disseminated propaganda that romanticized suicide attacks, using one of the virtues of Bushido as the basis for the campaign. The Japanese government presented war as purifying, with death defined as a duty. By the end of 1944, the government announced the last protocol, unofficially named , implying the will of sacrificing the entire Japanese population of 100 million, if necessary, for the purpose of resisting opposition forces. During the U.S. raid on Makin Island, on August 17, 1942, the U.S. Marine Raiders attacking the island initially spotted and then killed Japanese machine gunners. The Japanese defenders then launched a banzai charge with bayonets and swords, but were stopped by American firepower. The pattern was repeated in further attacks, with similar results. During the Guadalcanal campaign, on August 21, 1942, Colonel Kiyonao Ichiki led 800 soldiers in a direct attack on the American line guarding Henderson Field in the Battle of the Tenaru. After small-scale combat engagement in the jungle, Ichiki's army mounted a banzai charge on the enemy; however, against an organized American defense line, most of the Japanese soldiers were killed and Ichiki subsequently committed suicide. On May 29, 1943, during the Battle of Attu, the beleaguered Japanese soldiers led by Colonel Yasuyo Yamasaki in Attu Island, Alaska, launched a massive banzai charge through American lines near Massacre Bay and were quickly wiped out all night despite intense fighting. At the end of the battle, only 29 remained of the Japanese force that had numbered roughly 2,600, while the Americans lost 549 combatants out of the 15,000. The largest banzai charge of the war took place during the Battle of Saipan. General Yoshitsugu Sait≈ç gathered almost 4,300 Japanese soldiers, walking wounded and some civilians, many unarmed and ordered the charge. On July 7, 1944, it slammed directly into the Army's 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 105th Infantry Regiment, who would lose almost 2,000 menHarold Goldberg, D-Day in the Pacific: The Battle of Saipan, Indiana University Press, 2007. pp. 167‚Äì194 in the 15 hour pitched battle. In the end, U.S. Army and Marine lines would hold, and almost all the Japanese soldiers taking part in the charge would be killed. Banzai charges were always of dubious effectiveness. In the early stages of the Pacific War, a sudden banzai charge might overwhelm small groups of enemy soldiers unprepared for such an attack. However, by the end of the war, a banzai charge's participants suffered horrendous losses while inflicting little damage in return, particularly if launched against an organized defense with strong firepower, such as automatic weapons, machine guns and semi-automatic rifles. At best, they were conducted by groups of the last surviving soldiers when the main battle was already lost, as a last resort or as an alternative to surrender. At worst, they threw away valuable resources in men and arms in suicidal attacks which only hastened defeat. Some Japanese commanders, such as General Tadamichi Kuribayashi, recognized the futility and waste of such attacks and expressly forbade their men from carrying them out. Indeed, the Americans were surprised that the Japanese did not employ banzai charges at the Battle of Iwo Jima.Derrick Wright, The Battle for Iwo Jima, Sutton Publishing, 2006. Page 80.According to military historian Shigetoki Hosoki, \\"This writer was stunned to find the following comments in the 'Iwo Jima Report,' a collection of memoirs by Iwo Jima survivors. 'The men we saw weighed no more than thirty kilos and did not look human. Nonetheless, these emaciated soldiers who looked like they came from Mars faced the enemy with a force that could not be believed. I sensed a high morale.' Even under such circumstances, the underground shelters that the Japanese built proved advantageous for a while. Enemy mortar and bombing could not reach them ten meters underground. It was then that the Americans began to dig holes and poured yellow phosphorus gas into the ground. Their infantry was also burning its way through passages, slowly but surely, at the rate of ten meters per hour. A telegram has been preserved which says, 'This is like killing cockroaches.' American troops made daily advances to the north. On the evening of 16 March, they reported that they had completely occupied the island of Iwo Jima.\\"Picture Letters from the Commander-in-Chief, page 237.

Influenced from the design of Nodong-1 of North Korea, its extensive modification and engineering took place in Kahuta Research Laboratories (KRL) in 1990s with an objective of developing an electronic system that uses a single stage liquid fuel rocket motor to carry a payload of 700 kg to a range of 1,500 km.Pakistan Pushes To Improve Missile Strike Capabilityhttp://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/pakistan/1998/980406-ghauri.htm This is enough to reach most, if not all of India.

Sultan Muhammad Ghauri, a Turk who successfully campaigned in the northwestern region of India between 1176 and 1182, but was defeated in his first battle in northern India by Indian King Prithviraj Chauhan; but Ghauri returned in June 1192 when he defeated Prithviraj. He captured Delhi in 1199, but established his kingdom formally in 1206. However, the JS HQ has officially codenamed the missile \\"Hatf‚Äì5 (Ghauri‚ÄìI); the Hatf codename originates from the name of the sword or lance of Muhammad. =Design and development= According to the American intelligence estimates in 1999, the Ghauri‚ÄìI is influenced and its design development is based on the Rodong-1 missile of North Korea.Report to Congress, January ‚Äì June 1999. Unclassified Report to Congress on the Acquisition of Technology Relating to Weapons of Mass Destruction and Advanced Conventional Munitions. Central Intelligence Agency. According to the American Federation of Atomic Scientists, the Ghauri‚ÄìI is believed to inherit a warhead spin-up mechanism from the Rodong 1 and it is stated that this feature could improve accuracy up to 190m CEP‚Äî although this is still debatable. The mechanism involves using steering vanes to spin the missile after 100 seconds of flight time. After 110 seconds, the rocket motor stops and the warhead separates from the rocket motor. The warhead then enters a more stable re-entry trajectory due to its spinning motion. Warhead accuracy would be further enhanced if the Ghauri's inertial navigation system is capable of being updated by GPS satellite signals. By Pakistan's own unofficial admission, the technology transfer took place in 1990s in return of the instructions on enrichment methods for uraniumHussain, Zahid (2007). \\"Rogue in the Ranks\\". Frontline Pakistan (google books). New York City, NY State, United States: Columbia University Press, 2007. pp. 163‚Äì1966 [221]. . Not much has been publicized as controversy surrounds the claim that North Korean nuclear efforts were well advanced before the instructions on enrichment methods uranium were provided. According to the Pakistani military reports, the original design of the missile was flawed and the missile's frontal conic nose section material burned up due to generated shock waves and hypersonic effect on re-entry during its first test flight in 1998. High stress and high temperature shift caused the material to melt during the re-entry while its vintage electronic systems, engine system, and propellant had to be replaced. Eventually, the conic nose section was redesigned by rounding the cone which allowed the missile to travel from subsonic flow to supersonic flow. The KRL, with assistance from the NESCOM, DESTO, and NDC, engaged in heavy reengineering of much of the missile electronic system. The liquid fuel systems are incapable of storing fuel for any long period of time; the Ghauri‚ÄìI requires fueling for several hours before launch, making it vulnerable to a first strike. It is believed that this is why Pakistan has not pursued liquid fuel systems other than the Ghauri‚ÄìI and Ghauri-II. It also makes it less likely that the Ghaur-I would be armed with a nuclear warhead,http://www.defensenews.com/article/20121128/DEFREG03/311280005/Pakistan- Test-Fires-Medium-Range-Ballistic-Missile although it has been stated that it is capable of being loaded with \\"all types\\" of warheads. Contrast to the Shaheen program that went under the joint conjecture of Pakistan's Air Force and the Army, the Ghauri program was designed for the Pakistan Army which was setting to accuracy goal for a highly accurate missile designed to strike high-value targets. The solid-fueled Shaheen-IA is believed to be an alternative missile system for the Ghauri‚ÄìI. However, it has been stated that the Ghauri‚ÄìI has the advantage of lower cost than solid-fueled systems. This makes it particularly useful in testing launch and control systems. It has been speculated that the Ghauri‚ÄìI design may serve as a starting point for a future Pakistani space launch vehicle. Operational history and tests The Ghauri's mock-up displayed at the Lahore Railway Station.c. 2004. The Ghauri‚ÄìI was first test fired at 7:25hrs on 6 April 1998 from the Tilla Test Range near Malute, Jhelum Cantt which is about 76mi (122.31 km) south of the Islamabad.http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/pakistan/hatf-5.htm It was fired from a transporter erector launcher and traveled in a flight lasting 9 minutes and 58 seconds. It climbed to a height of 350km before turning in the direction of its planned impact area in the desert of Balochistan where it hit the designated target at 7:33hrs. At the time, Pakistani military's information source, the ISPR stated that the missile hit its designated target in the desert of Balochistan. Official Pakistani military reports revealed that the first test was not successful because the missile's conic nose melted due to tremendous amount of heat during the re-entry phase of its flight. After redesigning nose by rounding it to avoid the hypersonic effect but traveling from subsonic to supersonic flow, Ghauri‚ÄìI was successfully test fired for second time as then-Prime Minister Zafarullah Jamali witnessed the test. On 21 December 2010, the Ghauri‚ÄìI was again successfully test fired for a third time.Pak successfully test fires Ghauri Hataf-V On 12 November 2012, the Ghauri‚ÄìI was successfully test fired for a fourth occasion by the Strategic Missile Group of the Army Strategic Force Command. The test-flight was monitored by the new Strategic Command and Control Support System (SCCSS) and is believed to have been geared towards testing the SCCSS rather than the missile itself. On 15 April 2015, Ghauri-I was again test fired from Tilla Test Range; it was fired from the transporter erector launcher.

University of Michigan athletic director On January 5, 2010, Brandon was named athletic director at the University of Michigan, succeeding Bill Martin. University President Mary Sue Coleman said she chose Brandon because she believed his financial management experience would serve the department well as it grew larger and increasingly complex. Soon after arriving, Brandon established a marketing department, which began investing in resources for athletes and established a student loyalty program. Within a few years, Brandon began returning surpluses in the hundreds of millions of dollars, which the university used for a number of major facilities improvements. An opinion editorial in the Detroit News credited Brandon with raising academic standards for athletes and bringing in more counseling and tutoring resources for athletes. Michigan Athletics, under Brandon's leadership, raised student season ticket prices amid a slump in student attendance nationally, which drew scrutiny from student government officials after roughly a third fewer students bought season tickets. On September 30, 2014, a graduate student posted a petition on the website of the University's Central Student Government asking that Brandon be fired. By midnight of October 1, the petition had grown to over 10,000 signatures.

Macquarie Park is located 13 kilometres north-west of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of the City of Ryde. Macquarie Park is often referred to as North Shore. Macquarie Park was part of the suburb of North Ryde until it was gazetted as a suburb in its own right on 5 February 1999, and many businesses still use North Ryde as the address. Both suburbs share the 2113 postcode but Macquarie University, which is located at the northern part of the suburb, has its own postcode of 2109.  Aboriginal culture  Wallumatta Nature Reserve The whole area between the Parramatta and Lane Cove Rivers was originally known by its Aboriginal name Wallumatta. Contact with the first white settlement's bridgehead into Australia quickly devastated much of the population through epidemics of smallpox and other diseases. Their descendants live on, though their language, social system, way of life and traditions are mostly lost. The Aboriginal name survives in a local reserve, the Wallumatta Nature Reserve, located at the corner of Twin and Cressy roads, North Ryde. Very few remnants of Sydney Turpentine-Ironbark Forest still exist. The most substantial undisturbed area is the Wallumatta Nature Reserve in North Ryde, which is owned and managed by the National Parks and Wildlife Service.

Macquarie Park is named for Governor Lachlan Macquarie (1762‚Äì1824), a British military officer and colonial administrator who served as the Governor of New South Wales from 1810 to 1821. The area that is now Macquarie Park was part of the suburb of North Ryde from the late 19th century. The area was once filled with market gardens, poultry farms and vast tracts of bushland, with many beautiful picnic spots and waterfalls. The mid-1960s saw the establishment of Macquarie University and the 'Macquarie Park Employment Area' which saw the rezoning of 'Green Belt' bushland to allow for industrial activities. The initial concept for Macquarie Park was based on the idea of a similar hi-tech industrial area surrounding Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, the goal being to provide for the interaction between industries and the university.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia , page 189 During the 1970s, companies such as Amalgamated Wireless Australasia Limited, Beiersdorf, Racal and Universal Press located their corporate headquarters in the area. Macquarie Park has since gained a reputation of being a leading high-tech industrial area in Australia. It attracts many local and international companies from high-tech fields including electronic, scientific, computing, medical, communication, pharmaceutical and business supply. Economy Macquarie Park is Northern Suburb's centre for major commercial and retail districts. The \\"Sydney global economic corridor\\", is used to describe a geographical \\"arch\\" of Sydney, home to international corporations. = Corporate headquarters = The corporate prestige, close access to facilities and aesthetically pleasing environment are an attraction for many corporations. Macquarie Park had a total number of 32 308 jobs in 2001, making it the fourth largest concentration of jobs in NSW after Sydney CBD, North Sydney and Parramatta. Large businesses in the suburb include: AC Neilsen, Avaya, AstraZeneca, BOC, Canon, CA, Compuware, CSC, Kyocera, Fujitsu, Fuji Xerox, Ford Motor Co/Premiere Automotive Group (Aston Martin, Jaguar, Volvo, Land Rover), General Motors (Holden & Saab), George Weston Foods, Hitachi, Hyundai, Johnson & Johnson, Kenwood, Kimberly-Clark, Lucent Technologies, Metcash, Microsoft, Nestle Purina, Nortel Networks, Novartis, Bilfinger Berger, Optus (moved in late 2007 from North Sydney), Oracle Corporation, Orix, Philips, Raytheon, Sanofi-Aventis, Siemens, Memjet, Smiths Medical, Sony, Toshiba, TPG Telecom, Warner Music Group, Wesfarmers Industrial & Safety. = Former = Businesses have previously operated in Macquarie Park include: * Australian Radio Network: Mix 106.5 (until 2006, when it moved to Hornsby until demise on January 20, 2014, KIIS 1065 is operating from their new state-of-the-art studios in Chatswood) *Australian Radio Network: 101.7 WSFM & Edge 96.1 (until 2017 when it moved to Hornsby) *Network Ten (until 1991, when it moved to Ultimo then Pyrmont in 1996) *Global Television Studios (until mid-2007) *Foxtel (until mid-2017, when it moved to Gore Hill) = Retail and shopping = Macquarie Centre is a major regional shopping Centre opposite Macquarie University and next to Macquarie University Station. There are also two smaller nearby shopping centres, Eden Park Centre on Lane Cove Road and Lachlan's Line (currently under construction with stage one due to open at the end of 2019). = Restaurant and cafes = Macquarie Park has a wide variety of restaurants and cafes and is known as a major dining destination in the Northern Suburbs of Sydney. There are a large number of restaurants ranging from Australian to Chinese (including Cantonese), Japanese and Korean restaurants and eateries. = Hotels = There are many hotels in Macquarie Park.

Macquarie University Station Precinct  A substantial re-development of the Macquarie University Station Precinct (also known as the Herring Road Precinct) in Macquarie Park is planned as part of the NSW state government's \\"Priority Growth Precincts\\" program (originally known as the \\"Urban Activation Precincts\\" program). The objective is to provide housing and employment close to transport to help meet Sydney's growth needs, including up to 2,400 new homes by 2021 and up to 5,800 by 2031 that are within a ten- minute walk from Macquarie University Station. Following public display and consultation, the rezoning proposal was finalised in September 2015. Transport Macquarie University station Macquarie Park has access to the M2 Hills Motorway, that runs through the northern part of the suburb. It is serviced by Forest Coach Lines, Hillsbus, State Transit, Transit Systems and Transdev NSW bus services. During peak hour, the whole area gets very congested with traffic. , and stations are underground stations on the Metro North West Line which opened on 26 May 2019. Until 30 September 2018 they were on the Epping to Chatswood rail line operated by Sydney Trains. The line opened on 23 February 2009 and closed for metro conversion on September 30, 2018. At the 2011 census, only 27.3% of employed people travelled to work on public transport and 42.4% by car (either as driver or as passenger). Education Macquarie University is one of Australia's largest universities.

It is the last broadcast of David Brierley's voice as K9 (as John Leeson returned in the next season). The serial is set on the planets Skonnos and Crinoth. In the serial, minotaur-like aliens called the Nimons plot to invade Skonnos by creating a tunnel in time and space linked between two artificial black holes. Plot The glory days of the Skonnan Empire are long since past, but many of its citizens and soldiers yearn for conquest. The arrival of the mysterious horned Nimon on Skonnos brought hope of imperial restoration. The fearsome creature from within its labyrinth has promised to rebuild the Empire providing it receives a series of tributes from the Skonnans and their fawning, arrogant leader Soldeed. This tribute is to comprise groups of youthful sacrifices from the nearby planet Aneth, as well as a supply of hymetusite crystals. Young people have thus been abducted and transferred to the labyrinth. On the final collection, however, the interstellar craft bearing the sacrifices breaks down in space. The ancient war craft has worn out, and when the co-pilot over extends the engines, the Pilot is killed when a control panel explodes. The Fourth Doctor, Romana and K9 are in the TARDIS console room where he is making modifications to the ship. Various controls are disconnected, but unfortunately the area of space he has chosen to materialise the ship in is close to a manufactured black hole and they are in danger of being drawn in. He extends the TARDIS door force field to a nearby spaceship ‚Äì the Skonnan battle cruiser ‚Äì and he and Romana board it. Once aboard the Doctor notices an abundance of radioactive hymetusite crystals, and soon finds a hold full of young prisoners. They are from Aneth, and one, Teka, has a seemingly misplaced faith in another prisoner, Seth, to free them from their incarceration. The Co-Pilot investigates the hold and discovers the Doctor and Romana. He takes them to the bridge at gunpoint and forces them to fix the ship. Romana suggests adapting the ship to use a hymetusite crystal power source, and one is brought to her while the Doctor returns to the TARDIS to gather supplies. Aboard the TARDIS the Doctor learns from K9 of the collapse of the Skonnan Empire in civil war. With the Skonnan craft repaired the Co-Pilot starts to move his ship away; the TARDIS is stranded and facing obliteration in the vastness of space. The Doctor bounces the TARDIS off the approaching asteroid and starts to repair the console in order to pilot the ship to Skonnos and confront the evil there. The planet is dominated by the Nimon, which exists within its labyrinthine Power Complex into which only Soldeed may venture. The Nimon is angry when Soldeed reports that the last batch of sacrifices have not arrived and says it will withhold the arms that will help rebuild the Skonnan Empire. Soldeed emerges from the Power Complex and hears from his guard captain Sorak that the ship has been found. It arrives on Skonnos and Soldeed leads the party of greeting, being unnerved to see Romana aboard. The Co-Pilot lies that she is the cause of all the problems on the ship, being a pirate who stole aboard and killed the Captain. Soldeed does not believe this and then forces the Co-Pilot into the Nimon Power Complex where he faces certain death. Moments later Romana and the Anethans are loaded up with hymetusite and sent into the maze. The TARDIS materialises in the central square of Skonnos and the Doctor is taken to Soldeed. He soon escapes, and heads into the Power Complex. Deep in the Complex ‚Äì whose walls seem to shift and change creating various labyrinthine patterns that all lead to the Nimon ‚Äì Romana finds husks of previous Anethans, drained of life. The Co-Pilot also arrives, still pleading for his life, and when the Nimon appears it despatches the desperate soldier first before turning its mighty horns on Romana and the cowering Anethans. The Doctor arrives and distracts the Nimon, saving Romana, Seth and Teka who run after him. The other Anethans are too scared to leave. The Nimon has reached the power source room and starts manipulating the controls. A shimmering tunnel appears, and a travel globe bearing two more Nimons comes down it. They announce that the planet Crinoth is dying and that all the Nimons must continue the Great Journey of Life to Skonnos. Once the Nimons leave the Doctor examines the globes: they are travelling vessels that have journeyed down a tunnel set between two black holes. The Doctor accidentally sends the globe down the tunnel with Romana in it but before he can reverse this Soldeed arrives and uses his staff to destroy the control panel. Romana arrives in the dying world of Crinoth and encounters many Nimons and a broken old man named Sezom, who helped the Nimons establish themselves on his world and now knows they have destroyed it. He has also discovered that when jacenite is integrated into the staff that he was supplied with by the Nimons, it has the ability to stun them. He gives Romana a piece, but is killed by a Nimon while she escapes. Seth stuns Soldeed and the Doctor attempts to repair the transportation system. Before he completes the repairs the Nimons return to the power source room and restrain him. They then reverse the tunnel, returning Romana from Crinoth. Romana tosses the jacenite to Seth, who now has possession of Soldeed's staff, and he uses it to stun two of the Nimons. Having managed to free himself from Soldeed's laboratory, K9 arrives in time to deal with the remaining one. Soldeed, having escaped from the power source room, has seen the multiple Nimons and his faith is badly damaged. He is shot down by Seth but manages to trigger a chain reaction which will destroy the Complex. The Doctor and his party make their way out, guided through the labyrinth by K9. They escape and join up with the remaining members of the Skonnan military council, all of whom evacuate the main square as the Nimon Power Complex explodes. Later the Doctor watches as Seth and Teka pilot a spacecraft away from Skonnos, having been granted their freedom. Elsewhere Crinoth can be seen disintegrating. It seems that the Nimon threat is over. =Outside references= The Doctor alludes to the story of Theseus and the Minotaur, of which the Nimon story is a partial retelling. Broadcast and reception Paul Cornell, Martin Day and Keith Topping gave a mixed review of the serial, stating \\"With its cheap design work, and a wonderfully watchable OTT performance from Graham Crowden, The Horns of Nimon is by turns brilliant and dull\\". Doctor Who: The Television Companions David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker noted that the show had acquired a low reputation but they considered this to be undeserved. Although \\"admittedly a little more light hearted than usual\\" it did feature a performance by Tom Baker which was \\"rather more serious and intense here than in most other stories of a similar vintage\\". Production values were \\"no worse than on many other stories of this era, and rather better than on some\\" and the story was \\"ingenious and fun\\". Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times was very critical of the serial which he described as \\"a turgid quagmire of vapid characters, amateur dramatics, mirthless antics and clattering sets\\". Although the script contained \\"interesting concepts\\" these were not portrayed well due to the \\"absurd\\" Nimon costumes. Mulkern also thought the cast gave \\"terrible performances\\" with the exception of Tom Baker and Lalla Ward. Den of Geeks Andrew Blair selected The Horns of Nimon as one of the ten Doctor Who stories that would make great musicals. Commercial releases =In print= A novelisation of this serial, written by Terrance Dicks, was published by Target Books in October 1980. Dicks begins with a history of the Skonnan Empire and Soldeed, culminating in the arrival of the Nimon. Original author Anthony Read completed a new novelisation for audiobook publisher AudioGO in 2013, but with that company's suspension of operations and Read's death in 2015, the likelihood of its eventual release is now unclear. =Home media= The Horns of Nimon was released on VHS in June 2003. It was released in a DVD box set entitled Myths and Legends along with The Time Monster and Underworld in March 2010. In Region 1 North America DVD, Horns of Nimon as a single title, with extras and commentary, was released on 6 July 2010. This serial was released as part of the Doctor Who DVD Files in Issue 139 on 30 April 2014.

It is a playoff system of the top 8 finishers in a competition to determine which two teams will play in the grand final. The teams play each other over three weeks, with two teams eliminated each week. Teams who finish in a higher position in the competition are given an easier route to the grand final. In top level sport, the system was used by the Australian Football League from 1994 until 1999, and by the National Rugby League from 1999 to 2011. How it works Week 1 * 4th qualifying final: 1st v 8th * 3rd qualifying final: 2nd v 7th * 2nd qualifying final: 3rd v 6th * 1st qualifying final: 4th v 5th The organisation of the rest of the finals series is dependent upon whether teams won or lost in week 1 and their final ranking on the ladder before the finals. The two lowest-ranked losers are eliminated from the finals, while the two highest-ranked winners progress straight to week 3. Week 2 * 1st semi final: 4th highest-ranked winner v 2nd highest-ranked loser * 2nd semi final: 3rd highest-ranked winner (from week 1) v 1st highest-ranked loser (from week 1) The two losing teams are eliminated, the two winning teams progress to week 3. Week 3 * 1st preliminary final: 1st highest-ranked winner (from week 1) v winner of 1st semi final * 2nd preliminary final: 2nd highest-ranked winner (from week 1) v winner of 2nd semi final The two losing teams are eliminated, the two winning teams progress to week four. Week 4 * Grand final: winner of 1st preliminary final v winner of 2nd preliminary final Scheduling A key element of an effective McIntyre system is scheduling in week 1. In the first week games must be played in the following order: 4 v 5, 3 v 6, 2 v 7, 1 v 8. Teams in the first two games are playing for the chance of a bye in the second week of the finals. If the final two games ultimately go as predicted, then the chance of a bye or the risk of elimination disappears. Therefore, those games need to be played last so that there is never a situation where two teams know that their result would not matter. 1st: Advances with a win to preliminary final (week 3). Must play the semi final with a loss, cannot be eliminated in week 1, and has an 18,75% of winning the tournament. 2nd: Same as 1st, but has a more difficult opponent in week 1 (7th instead 8th). 3rd: Advances to preliminary final with a win AND at least one upset in one of the two last qualifying finals (1st or 2nd loses his qualifying final). Must play the semi final with a win and no upset in last two qualifying finals or a loss if there is at least one hopeful result in two last qualifying finals. Is eliminated if he loses AND 1st and 2nd too. (Has a 15.625% of winning the tournament). 4th: Advances to preliminary final with a win AND there are at least two upsets in remaining qualifying finals.

Advances to semi final with a win and is eliminated with a loss (He has a 6,25% of winning the tournament). 8th: Same as 7th (but he has a more difficult opponent in week 1 -1st instead 2nd). 1st, 2nd, 7th and 8th depend on themselves. 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th depend on their results and other qualifying finals results Example The 2010 NRL Final Series: At the qualifying finals, team 1 won and so went straight through to the preliminary finals. Team 4 also went through to the preliminary finals, because they won while teams 2 and 3 lost. However, teams 2 and 3 were not eliminated, but played again in the semi finals, because two teams ranking lower than them on the ladder also lost. Those two losing teams ranking lower than them, teams 5 and 8, were eliminated. Advantages The major advantages of the system are the number of different combinations of teams which could make the final game and that no matches are repeated in the first three weeks. When compared to other final eight systems, many of which split the participants into two groups, the McIntyre system means only two of the 28 possible combinations (1v7 and 2v8) are impossible in the grand final. The top two teams after the regular season are rewarded by being given a 'second life' within the finals. If either of these two teams lose to their much lower- ranked opponents in the first week, then one of the two losing teams ranked lower than them are eliminated, which means the 1st- and 2nd-ranked teams can withstand a loss in the finals and their season will continue, albeit with significant disadvantages. This 'second life' advantage for the highest-ranked teams on the ladder can flow on to teams 3 and 4 (and possibly teams 5 and 6.) If only one of the top two on the ladder loses in the first week, then team 3 is not eliminated if it has lost. Similarly, if only one of the top three on the ladder loses in the first week, then team 4 is saved from elimination if it has lost. If the top two teams win in the first week, then teams 7 and 8 will be the ones to be eliminated. Only two teams drop out, so even if they were to lose their games, teams 5 and 6 would still have another chance in the second week. Criticisms With its adoption by the NRL, debate has arisen over its fairness. The McIntyre system rewards teams who have form coming into the finals rather than during the whole season. The advantages given to a victor in the first week of the finals, even if that team is initially ranked 6th to 8th, includes a home final in the second week against a team ranked 3rd to 6th coming off a loss. This advantage given to lower-ranked teams that win in the first week are significant compared to the alternate final 8 system used by the AFL, which protects teams coming 1st to 4th from elimination and never give home finals to teams ranked 7th or 8th, regardless of whether they win or lose their matches. In 2008, the first week of the NRL finals saw the then reigning grand finalists the Melbourne Storm lose to the 8th placed New Zealand Warriors. Granted a home final as a week 1 winner, the Warriors then defeated the Sydney Roosters in the second week and proceeded to the final 4, the first team ever to make it that far from 8th position, whereas the Storm had to travel to Brisbane and win away to continue on. This scenario was exceeded in 2009 when the Parramatta Eels, who had finished 8th defeated St George Illawarra Dragons. Parramatta, with a home advantage, proceeded to defeat the Gold Coast Titans in week 2, whereas the Dragons were eliminated from the competition in week 2 in their away match against the Brisbane Broncos. This gave them the dubious distinction of being the first minor premiers to be eliminated after two consecutive losses since the inception of the McIntyre System. Parramatta became the first team ranked last of the finalists to contest the grand final, only to lose to the 4th-placed Melbourne Storm, although this Premiership has been struck from the record due to salary cap breaches by the Storm. For the record, at least one top four team has lost its qualifying final in every year since this system was introduced in 1999, until 2011 when all top four teams won their qualifying final. Another criticism is that, like many other top-8 systems, there is the possibility of games in the first week that are effectively meaningless, where teams have no risk of elimination and results only determine respective opponents and home ground advantage in the second week. In the McIntyre system if first-week results go as planned, then first defeats eighth and second defeats seventh. This leaves the teams who finished from third to sixth effectively playing \\"dead rubbers\\" in the first week, with the results merely reshuffling the order of these four teams. There is a requirement therefore that the 4v5 contest be played first. This raises a further criticism that the fate of the loser in this match is dependent upon the performance of the higher-ranked teams. A good example of this was the Dragons v Penrith final in 2004. The Dragons lost by a mere point, however, due to the higher ranked Bulldogs and Broncos losing the Dragons were eliminated. This also makes scheduling much less flexible, since the first vs eighth game must be the last game played, in order to prevent the teams between third and sixth entering their qualifying finals knowing that the game is already a dead rubber. The newly formed ARL Commission accepted a recommendation to scrap the system as of 2012 on 22 February 2012. It was replaced by the final eight system currently used by the AFL. Another anomaly of scheduling is that in the second week a team may play a higher-ranked opponent than the team they defeated, and similarly a first week loser may play an easier opponent than the team that defeated them. In the second week of the McIntyre system the third highest winner (i.e. the strongest winner of those playing) plays the highest-ranked loser rather than the second highest loser (i.e. the weakest loser). This may ensure no repetition of games in the second week, but it means higher-ranked teams end up with more difficult opponents simply for the sake of more interesting scheduling. An example of this happened in 2005 when the Wests Tigers (4th) defeated the North Queensland Cowboys (5th) in week one of the finals and were 'rewarded' in week 2 with a game against the 3rd placed Brisbane Broncos. Meanwhile, the Cowboys (ranked 5th and first week losers) played the Melbourne Storm who were ranked 6th. In 2011, the 6th-placed New Zealand Warriors were beaten convincingly by the Brisbane Broncos (ranked 3rd) in its qualifying final by the score of 40-10\\\\. Following that match, then-Warriors coach Ivan Cleary was quoted as saying \\"the way we played tonight, we don't deserve to be in the finals\\". That loss saw them at risk of being eliminated initially, but were granted a reprieve after the two lower-ranking teams, North Queensland and Newcastle, also lost their finals. A sudden reverse in form would see them advance to the grand final, thus becoming the third team (after the St. George Illawarra Dragons in 1999 and the Sydney Roosters the season previous), to advance to the grand final after finishing sixth at the end of the season. Ultimately, the Warriors would lose to the second-placed Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles who had a much easier run to the decider. Competitions In addition to the NRL, the McIntyre Final Eight System is also used in the Rugby League National League Three in Great Britain, the NSWRL Premier League and Jersey Flegg competitions.

The lake is formed by the damming of the Obey River, 7.3 miles (12 km) above its juncture with the Cumberland River at river mile 380. Portions of the lake also cover the Wolf River. Dale Hollow is one of four major flood control reservoirs for the Cumberland; the others being Percy Priest Lake, Lake Cumberland, and Center Hill Lake. It is also the site of Dale Hollow Lake State Park on the north (Kentucky) side. Location Dale Hollow Reservoir lies mainly in northern Tennessee, where it covers portions of Clay, Pickett, and Overton Counties. Small arms of the lake also extend northward into the Kentucky counties of Cumberland and Clinton. The project consists of 27,700 acres (112 km¬≤) of water and 24,842 acres (101 km¬≤) of surrounding land. History Dale Hollow Dam and Lake was authorized by the Flood Control Act of 1938 and the River and Harbor Act of 1946. The project was completed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers in 1943. Hydroelectric power generating units were added in 1948, 1949 and 1953. The project was designed by the Corps of Engineers and built under their supervision by private contractors. The hydroelectric generators of Dale Hollow Dam are used to supply power to the surrounding countryside. The dam, power plant and reservoir are currently operated by the Nashville District of the Corps. Recreation Sunset over Dale Hollow, from the Obey River Campground The lake is also used recreationally. Water sports are moderately popular, especially water skiing. Wakeboarding and tubing are two more water sports that can be seen regularly. The main recreational use is fishing. Dale Hollow is well known as a prime location for smallmouth bass fishing, currently holding the world record for the largest such fish ever taken (11 lb., 15 oz). It is the lake that is linked with the name Billy Westmoreland, famed smallmouth angler of Celina, Tennessee. The lake and surrounding rivers, the Cumberland River and the Obey River also contain other species such as largemouth bass, crappie, muskellunge, walleye, catfish, gar, and trout. The Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency and Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife each maintain jurisdiction over the lake's waters within their respective states. There is a reciprocal fishing agreement between the agencies, so recreational fisherman may be licensed by either state in order to fish in the reciprocal zone. Fishermen in areas of the lake outside the zone must be licensed by the governing agency. Islands View from Geiger Island Geiger Island is an island in Dale Hollow Lake.

In the United States it was known as Johnny in the Clouds and distributed by United Artists.Variety film review; 20 June 1945, p. 11. It was produced by Anatole de Grunwald and directed by Anthony Asquith. The screenplay was co-written by noted dramatist, Terence Rattigan, as a significant reworking of his 1942 play Flare Path, which incorporated his Royal Air Force (RAF) experiences as a Flight Lieutenant. The film stars Michael Redgrave, John Mills, Rosamund John and Stanley Holloway. The title, The Way to the Stars, is often assumed to have been taken from the Latin motto of the RAF, Per ardua ad astra. However, the literal translation of the RAF motto is \\"Through adversity to the stars\\". The alternative title, Johnny in the Clouds, is derived from the poem recited in the film as tribute to a dead aviator. Plot Pilot Officer Peter Penrose (John Mills) is posted in the summer of 1940 as a pilot to (the fictional) No. 720 Squadron, at a new airfield, RAF Station Halfpenny Field. He is a very green \\"15-hour sprog\\" Bristol Blenheim pilot and is assigned to B Flight, under Flight Lieutenant David Archdale (Michael Redgrave). When No. 720 Squadron's commanding officer, Squadron Leader Carter (Trevor Howard, in his second but first credited film role), is shot down, Archdale takes over. While Penrose develops into a first- class pilot, he meets Iris Winterton (Renee Asherson), a young woman living with her domineering aunt at the Golden Lion hotel in the nearby town. Archdale marries Miss Todd (Rosamund John), the popular manager of the hotel, who is known to everyone as Toddy. The Archdales later have a son, Peter. The action flashes forward to May 1942. The squadron is now flying Douglas Boston bombers. When Penrose shows signs of strain from extensive combat, Archdale has him posted to controller school, but is himself shot down and killed over France on Penrose's last mission. Penrose had been courting Iris, despite her aunt's disapproval, but Archdale's fate weighs heavily on his mind. Not wanting Iris to suffer if the same happened to him, he stops seeing her. No. 720 Squadron is sent to the Middle East, but Penrose remains behind as a ground controller for a United States Army Air Forces B-17 Flying Fortress bombardment group, which takes over the airfield. He befriends USAAF Captain Johnny Hollis (Douglass Montgomery) and Lieutenant Joe Friselli (Bonar Colleano). On 17 August 1942, the American airmen participate in the first attack by the USAAF on Occupied France, later ruefully acknowledging that they underestimated the difficulties involved. Afterwards, Penrose is posted to flying duties with an RAF Avro Lancaster bomber squadron. In 1944, Penrose, now a Squadron Leader and Pathfinder pilot, makes an emergency landing at Halfpenny Field, where he meets Iris again. Iris had decided to leave her aunt for good and join up. Toddy persuades a still-reluctant Penrose to propose to Iris, saying that she did not regret her own marriage in spite of her husband's death. Hollis, who has formed a platonic relationship with Toddy, is killed while trying to land a damaged returning bomber with a large bomb still on board rather than bail out and risk it crashing into the village. Poetry Two poems supposedly written by David Archdale were used in the film. They were written by John Pudney earlier in 1941 or 1942. The first poem is Missing. Archdale is portrayed as reciting it to Toddy shortly before their marriage, after his close friend Squadron Leader Carter is killed in action. Archdale tells Toddy that \\"I try and say things I feel that way sometimes. Sort of hobby\\" and tells her she's the only one who knows he writes poetry. Missing Less said the better. The bill unpaid, the dead letter, No roses at the end, Of Smith, my friend. Last words don't matter, And there are none to flatter Words will not fill the post Of Smith, the ghost. For Smith, our brother, Only son of loving mother, The ocean lifted, stirred Leaving no word. The second and better known of the two poems in the film is For Johnnny, portrayed as having been found by Peter Penrose on a piece of paper after David Archdale's death. Penrose gives it to Toddy Archdale, who later in the film gives it to Johnny Hollis' friend Joe Friselli to read after Hollis is killed. For Johnny Do not despair For Johnny-head-in-air; He sleeps as sound As Johnny underground. Fetch out no shroud For Johnny-in-the-cloud; And keep your tears For him in after years. Better by far For Johnny-the-bright-star, To keep your head And see his children fed.

In 1945, he was released from the service to help rewrite it with Anatole De Grunwald as a film screenplay of The Way to the Stars. Although Michael Redgrave and John Mills were the leads, the film offers very early performances from two actors who would themselves become international film stars in later years: Jean Simmons and Trevor Howard.Shiach 2006, p, 34. Filming was mainly in North Yorkshire and some of the locations remain little changed. RAF Catterick was used to film the RAF Halfpenny Field scenes, Bedale was used for street scenes outside the pub in the local small town, the Golden Lion Hotel in Northallerton was used as the pub, and Constable Burton Hall was used as the USAAF headquarters. Footage of B-17 Flying Fortresses landing and taking off was filmed at RAF Grafton Underwood in Northamptonshire. One of the USAAF aircrew involved recorded in his diary seeing B-17s of the 384th Bombardment Group (Heavy) and ground scenes including the crash of Captain Holliss' B-17 being filmed at Grafton Underwood. As well as B-17s, the other aircraft used in filming were Avro Ansons, Bristol Blenheims, Hawker Hurricanes, and a Douglas Boston. They came from a variety of training and operational USAAF, RAF and Free French units, the Boston being from 342 Squadron, RAF / Groupe de bombardement Lorraine. There was a real airfield with a name resembling the fictional RAF Halfpenny Field, RAF Halfpenny Green airfield in Staffordshire. This was not used for filming and was used for training pilots, unlike the fictional airfield's role as a bomber airfield. That airfield is now home to Wolverhampton Halfpenny Green Airport. Reception On initial release the film was popular in Britain, one reviewer in June 1945 stating that \\"it must rank as one of the outstanding British films of the war years\\". However, it performed poorly in the U.S. where it was released post-war as Johnny in the Clouds with a prologue added.Harrison's Reports film review; 24 November 1945, p. 186. According to Kinematograph Weekly the film performed well at the British box office in 1945.Robert Murphy, Realism and Tinsel: Cinema and Society in Britain 1939-48 2003 p 208 The 'biggest winners' at the box office in 1945 Britain were The Seventh Veil, with \\"runners up\\" being (in release order), Madonna of the Seven Moons, Old Acquaintance, Frenchman's Creek, Mrs Parkington, Arsenic and Old Lace, Meet Me in St Louis, A Song to Remember, Since You Went Away, Here Come the Waves, Tonight and Every Night, Hollywood Canteen, They Were Sisters, The Princess and the Pirate, The Adventures of Susan, National Velvet, Mrs Skefflington, I Live in Grosvenor Square, Nob Hill, Perfect Strangers, Valley of Decision, Conflict and Duffy's Tavern. British \\"runners up\\" were They Were Sisters, I Live in Grosvenor Square, Perfect Strangers, Madonna of the Seven Moons, Waterloo Road, Blithe Spirit, The Way to the Stars, I'll Be Your Sweetheart, Dead of Night, Waltz Time and Henry V. Later reviews considered the film \\"... one of the more thoughtful of British war movies ...\\"Shiach 2006, p, 31. and an \\"excellent drama about a British airfield and the men stationed there, focusing mainly on personal relationships in wartime.\\"Maltin, Leonard. \\"Leonard Maltin Movie Review.\\" Turner Classic Movies.. The British Film Institute describes the film as \\"one of the most effective and understated films about the conflict made during the Second World War, though it features no combat scenes and only three (brief) shots from inside a cockpit\\". The BFI Screenonline reviewer stated that the film \\"effectively comments on the traditional emotional reticence of the British by weaving a critique of it into the fabric of the story, turning it into a theme of the film. The introduction in the film's second half of the American flyers (as exemplified by the wise-cracking Bonar Colleano, making his film debut) further emphasises this. It also puts into relief the film's main focus - Penrose's development from callow youth into a burned-out, emotionally detached pilot, and his eventual return to life and love\\".

The Cypress area is located along U.S. Highway 290 (Northwest Freeway) is twenty-four miles (35 km) northwest of Downtown Houston. The Cypress urban cluster ranks 50th in the top 100 highest-income urban areas in the United States. Large scale residential and commercial development beginning in the 1980s transformed the once rural area into one of the Houston area's largest suburban communities. History The recent find of a San Patrice projectile point at the Dimond Knoll site nearby on Cypress Creek attests to a human presence in the area by 7500 BC. By the early historic era, the area around present-day Cypress was populated by Atakapa and Akokisa Indian tribes, but they soon disappeared after the appearance of German settlers in the 1840s; The German heritage is most notably reflected in the names of some of the major thoroughfares of the area, such as Huffmeister and Telge Roads. General Sam Houston and his Texas Army camped in the area on March 22, 1836 on the way to Harrisburg, which is now in East Houston, just days before the Battle of San Jacinto. The area remained mostly rural until the early 1990s when developers began construction of several master-planned communities. The area is often referred to as Cy-Fair or Cypress-Fairbanks, which comes from when the Big Cypress School and Fairbanks High School combined in the 1930s to form Cy-Fair High School and the Cypress-Fairbanks Independent School District. In March 2008, the Cypress Historical Society (CHS) was formed as a non-profit corporation with its primary mission being \\"...to discover, educate, promote, collect, preserve and make available to the public, historical documents and artifacts of the Cypress area\\".Cypress Historical Society - Home The CHS organization holds regular events aimed at exposing Cypress' residents to the historical and cultural foundation upon which the area was built. Geography Longwood is a heavily wooded golf course community located in North Cypress. Cypress is located near the intersection of US Highway 290 and Spring-Cypress Road. Cypress is located within the Cypress Creek and Little Cypress Creek watershed. There are no official boundary lines for the exact area, but roads commonly mentioned to bound the area include FM 529 road as the southern border, HWY 6 and FM 1960 as the eastern border, and HWY 249 as the northern border. Cypress has two distinct geographic profiles separated by Highway 290. The area northeast of US 290 is forested and thickly wooded, while the area southwest of 290 is predominately ranch land and grassy prairie dotted with scrub brush, Live oaks and Post oaks. Cypress falls under the jurisdiction of Harris County Precincts 4 and 5 (separated by Cypress Creek). Major arteries include Highway 290 to the South and State Highway 249 to the east.

Design and development Northrop 1929 flying wing (X-216 H). Photo from Aero Digest March,1930 Jack Northrop became involved with all-wing aircraft designs in the late-1920s, with his first Flying Wing being built in the 1928‚Äì1930 time period. That first prototype, the 1929 Flying Wing X-216H, evolved from earlier design studies. The X-216H had twin rudders with a single horizontal stabilizer running between them; both rudders were connected by twin booms to the thick, all-wing blended fuselage. The aircraft had an open cockpit in the center wing section and single, rear-facing, pusher propeller connected to a piston engine blended into the all-wing shape. The X-216H was first test flown in 1929 with Edward Bellande at the controls;Maloney 1988, p. 1. the aircraft displayed adequate performance and was noted for its unique all-metal stressed skin and multi-cellular construction. At about this same time, Jack Northrop became aware of Walter and Reimar Horten's prewar record-setting \\"tailless\\" flying wing glider designs being tested in Germany beginning in 1934.Coleman 1988, p. 84. The N-1M was one of a progression of experimental aircraft that further developed Northrop's all-wing concept. The aircraft was produced in the United States and was developed during 1939 and 1940 as a flying testbed for the purpose of proving Jack Northrop's vision of a practical Flying Wing. Built mostly of specially laminated layers of glued wood, the design of both wooden wings allowed for easy configuration changes with the central blended fuselage, which was made of tubular steel. The aircraft first flew on 3 July 1941 at Baker Dry Lake in California.O'Leary 2007 Operational history Northrop's Chief Test Pilot Vance Breese flew the N-1M on its maiden flight, unexpectedly bouncing into the air during a planned high-speed taxi run. He reported that the aircraft could fly no higher than five feet. Flight could only be sustained by maintaining a precise angle of attack, but Theodore von K√°rm√°n solved the problem by making adjustments to the trailing edges of the elevons. Control of the aircraft was achieved through the use of a system of elevons and wingtip rudders. The elevons served in tailless type aircraft both as elevators and ailerons, while split flaps on the downward angled wingtips took the place of a conventional rudder; they were later straightened after that angle proved unnecessary during flight testing.Darling 2009 The flight test program continued with Moye W. Stephens, Northrop Test Pilot and Secretary to the Northrop Corporation, serving as a test pilot. Early tests showed the N-1M to be satisfactory in stability and control, but overweight and underpowered. The aircraft's two Lycoming O-145 four-cylinder engines (buried in the wing to reduce drag) were replaced by two six-cylinder 6AC264F2 air-cooled Franklin engines. By November 1941, after 28 flights, Stephens reported that when attempting to move the N-1M about its vertical axis, the aircraft had a tendency to \\"Dutch roll.\\" The oscillations proved to be manageable when adjustments were made to the aircraft's wing configuration. The N-1M proved to be basically sound, paving the way for Northrop's later and much larger Northrop YB-35 and YB-49 aircraft. The aircraft was donated to the United States Army Air Forces in 1945 and was placed in the storage collection of the National Air Museum the following year. It sat there for nearly three decades, but was brought back to static, non-flying status, in its final flight configuration, after several years of restoration during the 1980s. The N-1M is now on public display at the National Air and Space Museum's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center. Specifications (N-1M) See also References =Notes= =Citations= =Bibliography= * Coleman, Ted.

The Government of Bangladesh has classified JMJB as a terrorist organisation and banned it. It is related to Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh, and is described by Bangladesh Police as an off shot.  Early history  Formed in the late 1990s in Bagmara Upazila in Rajshahi District, JMJB came into spotlight through its murder spree in the North-western region of Bangladesh. In the early days it received support from some in the government to tackle communist insurgent. The group also attacked Awami league politicians with the support of the BNP-Jammat-I-islami government. According to US diplomatic cables released by wikileaks, the then Prime Minister Khaleda Zia's son Tariq Rahman requested the release of JMJB leader to the home ministry. In 23 February 2005 the organisation was banned by the government.  Leadership  Their leaders include its chief Siddikul Islam alias Bangla Bhai, and Shaykh Abdur Rahman. After the Government of Bangladesh proclaimed a large reward for the capture of Bangla Bhai, he was captured by police and Rapid Action Battalion in Mymensingh District on 6 March 2006.Top Bangladesh militant captured: police , Reuters news report, 6 March 2006. JMJB is run by three leaders Muhammad Asadullah Al-Ghalib, Bangla Bhai, and Shaykh Abdur Rahman. Bangla Bhai, and Shaykh Abdur Rahman were executed on 30 March 2007.  Ideology  The JMJB is extremely critical of the Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh, which it deems as heretical due to the latter's participation in the Bangladeshi political establishment and patronisation of secularism and sacrilege of Islamic values and principles. The Group is inspired by the ideology of the Afghan Taliban. They were patronised by some Bangladesh Nationalist Party government members to attack left-wing guerrilla movement by Purbo bangla Communist Party. They wanted to establish sharia law in Bangladesh.

The third installment in Hammer's Frankenstein series, it stars Peter Cushing, Sandor El√®s and Kiwi Kingston. Plot A child witnesses an intruder steal the corpse of one of her recently dead relatives. Terrified, the child flees from the cabin where she is hiding, and encounters Baron Victor Frankenstein. The body snatcher takes the corpse to Frankenstein's secret laboratory. Meanwhile, a local priest discovers the theft. The child who witnessed the theft identifies both the body snatcher and his employer. Forced to leave town, Frankenstein and his assistant, Hans, return to the Baron's hometown of Karlstaad, where they plan to sell valuables from the abandoned Frankenstein chateau to fund new work. Arriving in the village, they rescue a deaf-mute young woman from being harassed by a gang of thugs. Arriving at the chateau, they find all the valuables stolen. The following day, Frankenstein and Hans go out for a meal, and Frankenstein notices the local Burgomeister is wearing one of his valuables; a ring. Frankenstein and Hans are recognised by the authorities, and they flee, eventually hiding at the hypnotist, Zoltan's, exhibit. Zoltan clashes with the police and is arrested, covering the escape of Frankenstein and Hans. Later that evening, Frankenstein and Hans breaks into the Burgomeister's apartments to get the valuables back, but the police arrive. Frankenstein and Hans flee and encounter the deaf-mute girl. She leads them to her shelter in a cave. Frankenstein finds his original creation frozen in the cave. He and Hans build a fire to melt the ice and free the creature. They take it to the chateau and restore it to life. However, the creature's brain is unresponsive. Frankenstein, desperate to restore active consciousness to his creation, comes up with the idea of obtaining the services of Zoltan to reanimate the creature's mind. Zoltan has been banished from Karlstaad for not having a license to perform. After clever psychological manipulation by the Baron, he agrees to the task. Zoltan is successful, but has less than scientific interests at heart. With the creature responding only to his commands, Zoltan uses it to rob and take revenge upon the town's authorities. Frankenstein evicts Zoltan, who then instructs the creature to kill Frankenstein, but the creatures kills him instead. The creature goes into a fit of rage and accidentally sets the lab on fire. Hans escapes with the girl, and the couple watch as smoke pours from the chateau where the lab is. A massive explosion ensues, causing the section where the lab was to topple over the cliff. Hans remarks, \\"They beat him after all.\\" The Baron's fate is unknown.

The film breaks continuity from the preceding film, The Revenge of Frankenstein. Denis Meikle described the break: \\"Any pretext of a connection to The Revenge of Frankenstein is dispensed with in a brazen display of contempt for continuity. A flashback creates a prior history that is wholly unrelated to the last Sangster script and is instead plundered from Universal's Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman.\\" The film was in production from 14 October to 16 November 1963 at Bray Studios in Windsor, Berkshire and on location at Black Park Country Park in Wexham, Buckinghsamshire. The film was made during Hammer's six-year co-production pact with Columbia Pictures. This led to the company to make a few production a year with Universal Pictures, with The Evil of Frankenstein being the only film that Hammer made that was financed by Universal in 1963. The film's version of the Monster is noted for resembling the one in Universal Pictures' original Frankenstein series of the 1930s and 1940s, including the distinctive laboratory sets as well as the flat-headed look of Jack Pierce's monster make- up which had been designed for Boris Karloff. Earlier Frankenstein films by Hammer had studiously avoided such similarities for copyright reasons. However, a new film distribution deal had been made between Hammer and Universal. As a result, Hammer had free rein to duplicate make-up and set elements. Additional scenes for American television were filmed on 14 January 1966 at Universal Studios in Los Angeles. Release The Evil of Frankenstein had its premiere in London on 19 April 1964 at the New Victoria Theatre. It received a general release in the country in 31 May 1964. It later received a release in the United States by Universal Pictures on 8 May 1964. The film was shown with a 97 minute running time on NBC in the United States on their NBC Saturday Night at the Movies block on 2 January 1968.  Critical reception  From contemporary reviews, Howard Thompson of The New York Times wrote, \\"For the first half, the latest Frankenstein go-round has a succinct pull and a curious dignity ... the picture begins to say something about superstition and hypocrisy. Then it simply goes hog-wild (monster gets drunk) and heads for the ash heap.\\" Variety gave the film a lukewarm review, writing that the direction was \\"deft enough over the more preposterous patches\\" and that there was \\"always something going on,\\" but that the dialogue sometimes provoked unintended laughter and that some of the supporting cast \\"tend to ham it up to the make-believe's detriment.\\" The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote that the monster made \\"a welcome return to tradition in a close approximation of Boris Karloff's celebrated make-up\\" and that the Baron's lab equipment was \\"as photogenic as ever,\\" but that the film was \\"sadly tatty\\" in all other respects, concluding: \\"Saddled with an uninspiring cast, and a Bavarian village so stagy that the villagers rhubarbing away into their Olde German beermugs seem almost real by comparison, Freddie Francis finds the going too uphill by half.\\" From retrospective reviews, AllMovie's review of the film was mixed to negative, calling it \\"dismal\\" and \\"the worst of Hammer Films' Frankenstein series\\". the film has an average critic's approval of 57% on Rotten Tomatoes.

History = Founding ethos = Bryanston was founded in 1928 by a young schoolmaster from Australia named J. G. Jeffreys. Armed only with his confidence and enthusiasm, he gained financial support for the school during a period of severe economic instability with financial backing from Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 9th Earl of Shaftesbury, he paid ¬£35,000 for the Bryanston House and its of immediate grounds. The school occupies a palatial country house designed and built in 1889‚Äì1894 by Richard Norman Shaw and modelled on the chateau at Menars in the Loire valley. Shaw designed the house for Viscount Portman to replace an earlier one. The building and estate was the biggest in Dorset and the last of the grand stately homes to be built in England. The home had been occupied by the Portman family for 30 years at the time of its sale, however, death duties made it impossible for the 4th Lord Portman to hold on to his family estate.Holdsworth, Angela (editor). Bryanston Reflections: Et nova et vetera, London: Third Millennium Publishing, 2005, The school's main lawn and fa√ßades There were just seven teachers and 23 boys of various ages in the first term. Jeffreys innovated whilst respecting good traditions, reflected in his choice of school motto, Et Nova Et Vetera. His was the first English school to adopt the Dalton Plan, its combination of the new and the old being of particular appeal. The system was flexible enough to offer a combination of lessons in the classroom and time for assignment work in subject rooms, which gave the students freedom to decide which pieces of academic work to focus their attention. Students are required to keep a daily record on a chart showing their use of working and leisure time, meeting with their tutors on a weekly basis to ensure effective monitoring of their progress. =Subsequent developments= The school opened on 24 January 1928 with 23 pupils and seven members of staff. In 2004, the school had around 650 pupils and 80 teachers.

Wilan√≥w Palace survived Poland's partitions and both World Wars, and so serves as a reminder of the culture of the Polish state as it was before the misfortunes of the 18th century. It is one of Poland's most important monuments. The palace's museum, established in 1805, is a repository of the country's royal and artistic heritage and receives around 3 million visitors annually. The palace and park in Wilan√≥w hosts cultural events and concerts, including Summer Royal Concerts in the Rose Garden and the International Summer Early Music Academy. The palace, together with other elements of Warsaw Old Town, is one of Poland's official national Historic Monuments (Pomnik historii), as designated on 16th September 1994. Its listing is maintained by the National Heritage Board of Poland. Since 2006, the palace has been a member of the international association of European Royal Residences. History Wilan√≥w Palace was built for king John III Sobieski in the last quarter of the 17th century and later was enlarged by other owners. It represents the characteristic type of baroque suburban residence built entre cour et jardin (between the entrance court and the garden). Its architecture is original, a merger of generally European art with distinctively Polish building traditions. Upon its elevations and in the palace interiors ancient symbols glorify the Sobieski family, especially the military triumphs of the king. Wilan√≥w Palace as seen from north-east by Bernardo Bellotto (1777). After the death of John III Sobieski in 1696, the palace was owned by his sons and later by the famous magnate families Sieniawskis, Czartoryskis, Lubomirskis, Potockis and Branicki family of the Korczak coat of arms. In 1720, the property was purchased by Polish stateswoman El≈ºbieta Sieniawska who enlarged the palace. Between 1730 and 1733 it was a residence of Augustus II the Strong, also a king of Poland (the palace was exchanged with him for the Blue Palace at Senatorska Street), and after his death the property came to Sieniawska's daughter Maria Zofia Czartoryska. Every owner changed the interiors of the palace, as well as the gardens and grounds, according to the current fashion and needs. In 1778 the estate was inherited by Izabela Lubomirska, called The Blue Marquise. She refurbished some of the interiors in the neoclassical style between 1792‚Äì1793 and build a corps de garde, a kitchen building and a bathroom building under the supervision of Szymon Bogumi≈Ç Zug. In the year 1805, the owner Stanis≈Çaw Kostka Potocki, opened a museum in a part of the palace, one of the first public museums in Poland. A most notable example of the collections is Potocki's equestrian portrait made by renowned neoclassical French artist Jacques-Louis David in 1781. Besides European and Oriental art, the central part of the palace displayed a commemoration of king John III Sobieski and the glorious national past. The palace was damaged by German forces in World War II, but it was not demolished after the 1944 Warsaw Uprising. After the war, the palace was renovated, and most of the collection stolen by Germany was repatriated. In 1962 it was reopened to the public. Design =Exterior structure= The structure was designed by Augustyn Wincenty Locci.Augustyn Wincenty Locci, the author of Wilan√≥w Palace at the Wilan√≥w Palace Museum retrieved 9 November 2011 The architecture of the palace is a unique example of different building traditions - reminiscent of Polish aristocratic mansions with side towers, the Italian suburban villa and French palaces entre cour et jardin with two oblong wings on each side of the cour d'honneur. Sundial with Chronos. During the first stage of construction, between 1677 and 1680 it was a typical Polish manor house with four alcove towers attached to the one-storeyed square building. Between 1681-1688, the building was enhanced and two gallery wings ending with towers were added. This new appearance was probably inspired by Palladio's Villa Montagnana. Shortly after the king's death the third stage of the reconstruction was accomplished. Between 1688-1696 the pavilion above the main building was erected and the towers were covered with baroque spires, all resembling the Villa Doria Pamphili in Rome (especially its initial design by Giovanni Francesco Grimaldi). The north wing, erected by El≈ºbieta Sieniawska. The king and his librarian Adam Adamandy Kocha≈Ñski took active part in the design and construction of the palace. The latter was responsible for the ideological and artistic programme, where motives and decoration elements played an essential role in glorifying the monarch, his wife and the Republic - busts of king and queen among the effigies of ancient characters, gods and goddesses, Roman emperors and empresses (such as the Dioscuri, Zeus-Amun, Sibyl, Romulus, Rhea Silvia, Alexander the Great, Cleopatra, Dido and Vespasian among others), Eagle and Pogonia, personifications of the Commonwealth regions (Masovia and Greater Poland, Samogitia, Red Ruthenia and Royal Prussia).Statues of Polesia, Podolia, Volhynia and Smolensk with Chernihiv, intended to embellish the fa√ßade of the southern gallery were never accomplished. They were issued by sculptors Andreas Schl√ºter (many reliefs and other secondary aspects of the fa√ßade), Stefan Szwaner and a stucco decorator named Antoni of Wilan√≥w. Some of the sculptures were made in the Low Countries by Louis Willemsens and Artus Quellinus the Elder' workshop, shipped to Gda≈Ñsk and then transported to Warsaw. An ornate sundial on the south wall with Chronos, together with the opposite composition with Uranus on the north wall, were intended to underline the king's patronage of science and orderliness in the Serenissima during his reign. They were executed by Antoni of Wilan√≥w, according to the design by Johannes Hevelius (astronomical aspect), Adam Adamandy Kocha≈Ñski (mathematical aspect) and Augustyn Locci (artistic aspect). The side wings embracing a courtyard, initiated by the king, were built long after his death by El≈ºbieta Sieniawska. They were constructed in the fourth stage of the enlargement between 1720-1729. Powerful Sieniawska was very concerned in maintaining the substantial historical residence of the Rex victoriossimus (Victorious King), as it was called. Despite that she transformed the palace into a French style palais enchant√© according to design by Giovanni Spazzio, with two new wings harmonious with the 17th century corps de logis. She employed the most renowned architects and artists for this undertaking, such as previously mentioned Spazzio, Johann Sigmund Deybel, J√≥zef Fontana, Jan Jerzy Plersch and Giovanni Rossi. While the original royal palace was decorated with reliefs depicting the deeds of John III, the new wings were adorned with battlefield achievements of Sieniawska's husband and father-in-law - Adam Miko≈Çaj and Miko≈Çaj Hieronim Sieniawski (nota bene Sobieski's comrades). =Interior space= Plafond with Allegory of Autumn by Jerzy Siemiginowski-Eleuter. The most prominent Polish and foreign artists participated in the decoration of the palace interiors. It was entrusted to painters Martino Altomonte, Jan Rayzner of Lviv, Michelangelo Palloni, sculptor Stefan Szwaner and stucco decorators Szymon J√≥zef Bellotti, Antoni of Wilan√≥w and Abraham Paris. They were supervised by the official court painters Claude Callot and later by Jerzy Siemiginowski-Eleuter. The latter, one of the greatest Polish painters of that time, had a significant influence on the palace's subsequent internal aspects (plafonds in the state rooms, frescoes). Internal decoration was also superintended by Adam Kocha≈Ñski, a great admirer of China, who supported closer economic relations of the Commonwealth with the \\"Central nation\\". Due to his influence, Wilan√≥w and other residencies were full of luxury Chinese imports and chinoiserie. African servant carrying a parrot (detail of a fresco by Giuseppe Rossi). The 17th-century palace inventories included the works of the greatest contemporary and ancient masters, like Rembrandt (Portuguese rabbi, Jewish Girl in a beret, The Adoration of the Magi, Abraham and Hagar, Portrait of an old man in the so-called Dutch Room of the palace), Pieter van Laer, called Bamboccio (Travellers), Anthony van Dyck (Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane), Ferdinand van Kessel (batalistic scenes, allegorical paintings and still lifes), Raphael, Caracci brothers, Guido Reni and Bernardo Strozzi. The chambers were filled with precious furnishings, like silver folding screen, silver pyramid with 11 baskets, a three-storeyed silver fountain or a silk baldachin presented by the Shah of Persia. Unfortunately they were scattered by the successive proprietors, appropriated by Friedrich August of Saxony and transported to Dresden or looted by the Germans during World War II (e.g. John III's tortoise-shell cabinet, never retrieved). Among the artists appointed for decoration of the palace's interiors in the 18th century were Giuseppe Rossi, an Italian fresco painter, who adorned the chambers with trompe-l'≈ìil paintings and stucco decorators Francesco Fumo and Pietro Innocente Comparetti. Following the example of Queen Marie Casimire, who ordered a painting of herself as a goddess on the palace plafonds, El≈ºbieta Sieniawska embellished the Lower Vestibule with a fresco of Flora. On her initiative the walls in the royal chambers were covered with Genoan velvet. The walls of the second floor, that is the Great Dining Room, were covered with frescoes depicting Apollo, Minerva and Hercules as an allegory of Virtus Heroica (Heroic Valor), Hebe symbolizing Venustas (Beauty) completed with panoplies. Sieniawska's daughter, Maria Zofia Czartoryska, furnished the palace with new fireplaces made of white-cherry marble and crowned with mirrors in rich rococo frames. In the contract with King Augustus II Maria Zofia obliged him to preserve the palace unchanged. Therefore, his actions were limited to finishing the new dining room, called the White Room in the southern wing and to the decoration of some unfinished interiors. The plafonds and other paintings were executed by Julien Poison, Johann Samuel Mock and Lorenzo Rossi, while the decorative lacquer panneaux in the Chinese Room were made by Martin Schnell. =Garden= The Palace Gardens An integral part of the palace, almost since its beginning, is the garden. Initially it had the character of a baroque Italian garden in a semicircular form surrounding the palace on the east. In its composition this geometric garden fitted in well with the ancient patterns and the palace arrangement. It consisted of an upper garden located on a terrace with two arbours in the form of lanterns in each corner, and lower garden. During the third stage of the reconstruction of the palace the geometric garden parterres were replaced with embroidered parterres √† la fran√ßaise inspired by Andr√© Le N√¥tre's treaties. At that time the garden was embellished with gilded lead sculptures by Gaspar Richter of Gda≈Ñsk and vases carved in cherry marble from Chƒôciny. In the beginning of the 18th century the garden was enlarged, the late baroque parterre ornamentation was replaced with r√©gence motives completed with Sieniawska's coat of arms Szreniawa in the northern parts and her monogram in the southern part. In 1784 Izabela Lubomirska transformed neighbouring territories of Wilan√≥w folwark into a jardin anglo-chinois according to Szymon Bogumi≈Ç Zug's design. This new garden with rich vegetation, sinuous paths and cascades was inspired by works of William Chambers, Thomas Whately and August Moszy≈Ñski.

The building was opened in 1932 on the site of the Hotel Cecil and stands behind the original facade of the hotel, between the Adelphi building and the Savoy Hotel. Broadly Art Deco in style, it was designed by Frances Milton Cashmore of the architectural firm of Messrs Joseph. Description Standing 58 m (190 ft) tall, with of floor space, Shell Mex House has 12 floors (plus basement and sub-basement) and is immediately recognizable from the River Thames and the South Bank by the clock positioned on the south side of the building (flanked by two large, hieratic figures at the south corners in marble by the sculptor William Charles Holland King). The clock, which was known for a time as \\"Big Benzene\\", has the biggest clock face in the UK, at 7.62 metres in diameter, just 0.02 metres more than the clocks on the Liver Building in Liverpool; it was supplied by Gillett & Johnston of Croydon. The building faces the river and the Strand. It was described by architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner as \\"thoroughly unsubtle, but...hold[s] its own in London's river front.\\" History The building was for many years the London headquarters of Shell-Mex and BP, for which it was originally built. Shell-Mex and BP was a joint venture company created by Shell and British Petroleum in 1932, when they decided to merge their United Kingdom marketing operations.Reference and contact details: GB 1566 SMBP Title:Shell-Mex and BP Archive Dates of Creation: 1900‚Äì1975 Held at: BP Archive GB 1566 SMBP Upon the UK marketing separation of Shell and BP in 1976, Shell Mex House became the head office of Shell UK, which was Shell's UK operating company. Changes in the way that Shell was run in the 1990s led to the disposal of the property by Shell. Today, simply known as 80 Strand, most of its floors are occupied by companies belonging to Pearson plc. The green plaque marking the formation of the Royal Air Force The entrance of the building, which is set back from the Strand, is through a large gated archway. A green plaque was affixed to the wall just inside the gate in March 2008, proclaiming: \\"The Royal Air Force was formed and had its first headquarters here in the former Hotel Cecil 1st April 1918\\". Below it is a brass plate stating: \\"This plaque was unveiled by the Chief of the Air Staff Air Chief Marshal Sir Glenn Torpy KCB CBE DSO ADC to mark the 90th anniversary of the formation of the Royal Air Force\\". During World War II, the building became home to the Ministry of Supply, which co- ordinated the supply of equipment to the national armed forces. It was also the home of the Petroleum Board, which handled the distribution of petroleum products during the war. It was badly damaged by a bomb in 1940. The building reverted to Shell-Mex and BP on 1 July 1948, with a number of floors remaining occupied by the Ministry of Aviation (latterly the Board of Trade, Civil Aviation Division) until the mid-1970s. During this time, until the department's move to the present location in Farnborough, the building was also the headquarters for the Air Accidents Investigation Branch.Final report (Archive) Swiss Federal Department of Transport and Power - Translated by the Department of Trade Accidents Investigation Branch. p. 3.

The Kandharis were said to have offered ¬£530 million for the building, but they were competing with other interested groups, including Menorah, the Israeli insurer, an Irish company, and several British companies. An offer believed to be for ¬£520 million ($1.02 billion) was made in December 2006 by Istithmar, the investment agency of the Dubai government, which withdrew its offer before completion.

During the 2003 NFL season, Witherspoon was the only Panther linebacker to start every game, where he once again filled in for an injured Morgan at middle linebacker. He intercepted his first pass off New Orleans Saints quarterback Aaron Brooks. During Super Bowl XXXVIII, Witherspoon posted a career-high 16 tackles. He ended the campaign with a total of 99 tackles, one sack and one interception. The following year, \\"Spoon\\" was one of the few defensive players to start every game for the Panthers, who were wracked with injuries. Despite the loss of key personnel like defensive tackle Kris Jenkins, the Panthers led the league in interceptions. Witherspoon set personal bests with three sacks and four interceptions and a then career-high of 103 tackles. In 2005, his final year with the Panthers, Witherspoon played in 15 games and finished the season 81 tackles, 2.5 sacks and two interceptions.

In 2007, he recorded 110 tackles and a career-high seven sacks and was named Team MVP for 2007.NFL.com Stats courtesy of NFL.comhttp://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/sports/stories.nsf/rams/story/FC153562E3B1B0F3862573BD005FFC84?OpenDocument =Philadelphia Eagles= On October 20, 2009 Witherspoon was traded from the Rams to the Philadelphia Eagles in exchange for wide receiver Brandon Gibson and a fifth round draft pick in 2010. In his first game as an Eagle against the Washington Redskins on October 26, 2009, he recorded six tackles, an interception (returned for a touchdown), sack, and a forced fumble. During the season, he played in 17 games, becoming the fifth player since bye weeks were reintroduced in 1990 to do so, as he was traded prior to St. Louis's bye week to the Eagles after the Eagles bye week.

He enjoyed two top twenty hits on the UK Singles Chart - \\"You're a Lady\\" (1972), which typifies his signature use of brass bands and choral arrangements for a nostalgic and romantic feel, and \\"Hold On To Love\\" (1975). In the 1980s, Skellern formed the band Oasis with Julian Lloyd Webber and Mary Hopkin and established a musical comedy partnership with Richard Stilgoe in cabaret. Over his career, Skellern wrote and performed music for film, television and stage. Skellern's songs have been recorded by Andy Williams, Davy Jones, Brigitte Bardot, Ringo Starr and Jack Jones, amongst others. After developing an inoperable brain tumour, Skellern was ordained as a deacon and priest of the Church of England in October 2016. He died only four months later. Career Peter Skellern was born in Bury, Lancashire, to Margaret (n√©e Spencer) and John Skellern. He attended Derby High School and studied piano at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. After graduating with honours in 1968, Skellern struggled to make headway in a career as a concert pianist and instead focused on pursuing popular music. Answering a Melody Maker advert, Skellern joined the band The March Hare as keyboardist. This gave the classically-trained musician experience in rock and pop. The March Hare became Harlan County in 1970, but failed to achieve any success and disbanded. Skellern continued to pursue a career in pop, represented by the band's manager Johnny Stirling. This led to a record deal with Decca for recording and Warner Music for publishing, signed on 5 May 1972. Skellern's first song to become a hit was \\"You're a Lady\\", released 11 August 1972. The record featured Skellern accompanied by members of the Congregation, who had previously recorded the top ten hit \\"Softly Whispering I Love You\\", and the Hanwell Band. \\"You're a Lady\\" reached number 3 on the UK Singles Chart and number 50 in the United States Billboard Hot 100. The accompanying album You're a Lady and subsequent singles failed to chart. Success for Skellern followed three years later with \\"Hold On to Love\\" which reached number 14 on the UK chart. He also sang the theme song to the London Weekend Television series Billy Liar (1973). For three years in the 1970s he worked on BBC Radio 4's Stop the Week. A non-charting song, \\"Too Much I'm in Love\\", received radio play. In 1978 Skellern had a minor hit with the 1930s Ray Noble song \\"Love Is the Sweetest Thing\\" (which featured backing by the Grimethorpe Colliery Band), winning the Music Trades Association award for best middle of the road song. This followed his departure from Island Records after his previous album, Hard Times, had failed to chart despite a guest appearance by George Harrison. In 1981 he wrote, composed and performed in a series of musical playlets for the BBC called Happy Endings. Two years later he hosted the Private Lives television chat show. He wrote the lyrics for the song \\"One More Kiss, Dear\\" from the film Blade Runner (1982). In 1984, Skellern performed the theme song for the London Weekend Television programme Me and My Girl. In the same year, he formed a group called Oasis with cellist Julian Lloyd Webber and Mary Hopkin. The group released a self-titled album in 1984 on the Warner Bros. Records label which earned a silver record. The group performed live on television, but a planned concert tour was cancelled when Mary Hopkin became ill. In 1987, Skellern wrote and performed the theme music and song for the Yorkshire Television series Flying Lady. Skellern provided the voice of Carter Brandon in the BBC Radio adaptations of Peter Tinniswood's Uncle Mort's North Country. The show was produced by Pete Atkin. Skellern collaborated with Richard Stilgoe in cabaret and in musical comedy with comic songs such as \\"Joyce the Librarian\\". They released three live albums; A Quiet Night Out, By the Wey and Who Plays Wins. Toward the end of his career Skellern wrote pieces of sacred choral music, including \\"Waiting for the Word\\" (which was written for the BBC's Songs of Praise programme of 19 August 2001), Six Simple Carols and The Nativity Cantata written for a Hemel Hempstead choir, the Aeolian Singers. The work was first performed by them in 2004 and was later recorded. =Illness and death= In October 2016, it was revealed that Skellern had developed an inoperable brain tumour and that he had fulfilled a lifelong calling to be ordained in the Church of England. Under a special faculty from the Archbishop of Canterbury, he was ordained both as a deacon and priest on 16 October 2016 by the Bishop of Truro. Skellern died as a result of the brain tumour in February 2017 at the age of 69, at Lanteglos- by-Fowey, Cornwall. He was survived by his wife Diana, two children and five grandchildren. Legacy In 1972, the same year that \\"You're a Lady\\" was released, the song was covered in France by folk singer Hugues Aufray under the title \\"Vous ma lady\\", followed later in the year by Brigitte Bardot with Laurent Vergez in a duet version released on 3 January 1973.Brigitte Bardot complete discography on Brigitte Bardot, Initiales B.B., 3 CD box set, released in 1993 by Phonogram France and Philips, p. 30. Davy Jones from the Monkees also recorded a version. It has been extensively covered since, by artists such as Johnny Mathis on his 1973 album Me and Mrs. Jones and Telly Savalas on his 1974 album Telly. Skellern's other songs have been also recorded by a number of other singers, such as Andy Williams who included \\"Make It Easy for Me\\" on his 1973 album Solitaire and \\"My Lonely Room\\" on his 1975 album Andy. Ringo Starr recorded Skellern's \\"Hard Times\\" on his 1978 album Bad Boy. In her 1985 eponymous BBC television comedy series, Victoria Wood performed an affectionate parody of Skellern's style in a song entitled \\"Northern Boy\\", accompanied by a brass band and choir. On 17 April 2017, Tim Rice introduced an hour-long tribute for Skellern on BBC Radio 2.

Hsu in India, was a Chinese scholar and translator, indologist and philosopher. He translated 50 of the Upanishads into classical Chinese. He also translated Nietzsche's Also sprach Zarathustra, Kalidasa's lyric poem Meghaduuta (Cloud Messenger), and several of Sri Aurobindo's works into Chinese. He was familiar with Greek, Latin, English, French, as well as Sanskrit and German. A 16-volume edition of his complete works was published in 2006. His life and studies He was born into a wealthy family in Changsha, Hunan. His name was \\"Hu\\"() by birth. Fancheng is his Pen name. The childhood of Xu was marked by a complete study of Classical Chinese. He was taught by the student of the late Qing dynasty Confucian scholar Wang Kaiyun. He was a friend and student of Lu Xun in his early life. From 1927 to 1929, he studied History at Zhongshan University and then Western Literature in Fudan University. He studied Fine Art and Philosophy at the University of K√∂nigsberg, Germany from 1929 to 1932. From 1945 to 1978, he studied and taught in India, thus escaping the Cultural Revolution. He lived in Pondicherry from 1951 to 1978, he was provided an independent house by Mother Mira Alfassa near the beach, where XuFancheng translated various Indian literature such as Bhagavad Gita, Upanishads, Kalidasa meghdootam, Also Sprach Zarathustra, Confucianism, Lao Tze's philosophy and many more. He also was a great Chinese painter. After returning to China in 1978, he worked as a professor at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences , and all his works were collectively published in 16 volumes in China. Xu was an acquaintance of Lu Xun. His study in K√∂nigsberg was at first inspired by Lu's advice. Throughout his entire life, his academic achievement and his fame were not proportionate. Partly due to the fact that Xu did not have any student to succeed in his study. Xu possessed the ability to translate Sanskrit texts into Classical Chinese while both languages are archaic and not commonly spoken by people in India and China.  Legacy  Xu‚Äôs translations were little known in China in the past, but today there is a growing interest in his writings and through them in Sri Aurobindo‚Äôs philosophy and vision. In 2006 Xu's Collected Works were brought out by some of his students and colleagues and in 2009 the China Daily reported on his ‚Äúunending search for spirituality‚Äù. In 2010 there was an exhibition in Auroville and Pondicherry to commemorate his centenary. Around the same time some Chinese nationals, inspired by his writings, came to visit the Ashram and Auroville. In 2017 Lao Zhaohui, the Chinese Ambassador to India and a former student of Xu Fancheng, came for a visit and was especially interested in seeing his 300 paintings. Later on in a speech he greatly appreciated Xu‚Äôs work and his merits, calling him one of the bridges between China and India. In 2018 there was an exhibition and symposium on Xu in Pondicherry, inaugurated by Lao Zhaohui. The Ambassador was accompanied by some prominent scholars, and various notable speakers addressed the audience.Ganguli (2018), p.137 Literature *F.C. Hsu (1978). Chinese Words.

Mountain Ash RFC is a member of the Welsh Rugby Union and is a feeder club for the Cardiff Blues. Early history The team was founded in 1875 at a meeting in the Mountain Ash Inn, but their first game in earnest was not until 1891, against Swansea at the Washery Field. Some of their early fixtures were against Llanelli, Cardiff and Newport. Mountain Ash provided their first Wales international in 1892, when Frank Mills was selected for the Home Nations Championship, though at the time he had left Mountain Ash and was then representing Cardiff. It only took another four years for Mountain Ash to claim their first full international to represent Wales while still playing for the club, when Fred Miller was chosen to face Ireland in the 1896 Home Nations Championship. They managed to beat the touring Canadian team in 1904, and in the same year, moved headquarters to the Cresselly Inn. Four years later, they moved to the Recreation Ground, and established their headquarters at the Glancynon Hotel, their current clubhouse. In 1912, the team toured the south of France, and managed to beat Bayonne RFC and Pau, but the outbreak of the First World War made it difficult for the club to continue. The situation grew even worse during the Second World War, when there were no games played from 1939 to 1946. They survived through this period, however, often maintaining at least one player in the Welsh team. In 1953, the county council removed the grandstand and the perimeter fence from the Recreation Ground, which proved to be devastating for the club, as most first class clubs refused to play there. During the late 1959/60 season, Mountain Ash had an excellent season losing only four matches under the captaincy of Denis Bryant, who became the club President in the 1970s, and was also instrumental in the creation of the senior second team in the 1960/61 season. In 1963 the first clubhouse was opened by former Welsh international Judge Rowe Harding, which was followed by silverware in the 1964/65 season when they won the Mid District Championship. In 1994-1995, the club moved to the Parc Duffryn Pennar Ground. In 2000-2001, as part of the club's 125-year celebrations, a game was played against Public School Wanderers. At present There are two senior teams, a youth team and a junior section. There is a clubhouse in the town attended by an enthusiastic supporters club and committee. The home ground, Parc Duffryn Pennar has modern facilities, including floodlights and a well maintained playing surface. Many representative games have been played there, including schoolboy internationals. Tours such as one to Canada in 2005 and South Africa in 2007 are regular features. The first senior team play in the Division One east of the Welsh League. They are coached by Mike Butts and Robert Downes.

If its operating quality decreases at all, the decrease is proportional to the severity of the failure, as compared to a naively designed system, in which even a small failure can cause total breakdown. Fault tolerance is particularly sought after in high-availability or life-critical systems. The ability of maintaining functionality when portions of a system break down is referred to as graceful degradation.Adaptive Fault Tolerance and Graceful Degradation, Oscar Gonz√°lez et al., 1997, University of Massachusetts - Amherst A fault-tolerant design enables a system to continue its intended operation, possibly at a reduced level, rather than failing completely, when some part of the system fails.Johnson, B. W. (1984). \\"Fault-Tolerant Microprocessor-Based Systems\\", IEEE Micro, vol. 4, no. 6, pp. 6‚Äì21 The term is most commonly used to describe computer systems designed to continue more or less fully operational with, perhaps, a reduction in throughput or an increase in response time in the event of some partial failure. That is, the system as a whole is not stopped due to problems either in the hardware or the software. An example in another field is a motor vehicle designed so it will continue to be drivable if one of the tires is punctured, or a structure that is able to retain its integrity in the presence of damage due to causes such as fatigue, corrosion, manufacturing flaws, or impact. Within the scope of an individual system, fault tolerance can be achieved by anticipating exceptional conditions and building the system to cope with them, and, in general, aiming for self- stabilization so that the system converges towards an error-free state. However, if the consequences of a system failure are catastrophic, or the cost of making it sufficiently reliable is very high, a better solution may be to use some form of duplication. In any case, if the consequence of a system failure is so catastrophic, the system must be able to use reversion to fall back to a safe mode. This is similar to roll-back recovery but can be a human action if humans are present in the loop.  History  The first known fault- tolerant computer was SAPO, built in 1951 in Czechoslovakia by Anton√≠n Svoboda. Its basic design was magnetic drums connected via relays, with a voting method of memory error detection (triple modular redundancy). Several other machines were developed along this line, mostly for military use. Eventually, they separated into three distinct categories: machines that would last a long time without any maintenance, such as the ones used on NASA space probes and satellites; computers that were very dependable but required constant monitoring, such as those used to monitor and control nuclear power plants or supercollider experiments; and finally, computers with a high amount of runtime which would be under heavy use, such as many of the supercomputers used by insurance companies for their probability monitoring. Most of the development in the so-called LLNM (Long Life, No Maintenance) computing was done by NASA during the 1960s, in preparation for Project Apollo and other research aspects. NASA's first machine went into a space observatory, and their second attempt, the JSTAR computer, was used in Voyager. This computer had a backup of memory arrays to use memory recovery methods and thus it was called the JPL Self-Testing-And-Repairing computer. It could detect its own errors and fix them or bring up redundant modules as needed. The computer is still working today. Hyper-dependable computers were pioneered mostly by aircraft manufacturers, nuclear power companies, and the railroad industry in the USA. These needed computers with massive amounts of uptime that would fail gracefully enough with a fault to allow continued operation while relying on the fact that the computer output would be constantly monitored by humans to detect faults. Again, IBM developed the first computer of this kind for NASA for guidance of Saturn V rockets, but later on BNSF, Unisys, and General Electric built their own. In the 1970s, much work has happened in the field . For instance, F14 CADC had built-in self-test and redundancy. Ray Holt. \\"The F14A Central Air Data Computer, and the LSI Technology State-of-the-Art in 1968\\". In general, the early efforts at fault-tolerant designs were focused mainly on internal diagnosis, where a fault would indicate something was failing and a worker could replace it. SAPO, for instance, had a method by which faulty memory drums would emit a noise before failure.Fault tolerant computing in computer design Neilforoshan, M.R Journal of Computing Sciences in Colleges archive Volume 18, Issue 4 (April 2003) Pages: 213 ‚Äì 220, Later efforts showed that to be fully effective, the system had to be self-repairing and diagnosing ‚Äì isolating a fault and then implementing a redundant backup while alerting a need for repair. This is known as N-model redundancy, where faults cause automatic fail-safes and a warning to the operator, and it is still the most common form of level one fault-tolerant design in use today. Voting was another initial method, as discussed above, with multiple redundant backups operating constantly and checking each other's results, with the outcome that if, for example, four components reported an answer of 5 and one component reported an answer of 6, the other four would \\"vote\\" that the fifth component was faulty and have it taken out of service. This is called M out of N majority voting. Historically, the motion has always been to move further from N-model and more to M out of N due to the fact that the complexity of systems and the difficulty of ensuring the transitive state from fault- negative to fault-positive did not disrupt operations. Tandem and Stratus were among the first companies specializing in the design of fault-tolerant computer systems for online transaction processing.. Terminology An example of graceful degradation by design in an image with transparency. Each of the top two images is the result of viewing the composite image in a viewer that recognises transparency. The bottom two images are the result in a viewer with no support for transparency. Because the transparency mask (center bottom) is discarded, only the overlay (center top) remains; the image on the left has been designed to degrade gracefully, hence is still meaningful without its transparency information. A highly fault-tolerant system might continue at the same level of performance even though one or more components have failed. For example, a building with a backup electrical generator will provide the same voltage to wall outlets even if the grid power fails. A system that is designed to fail safe, or fail-secure, or fail gracefully, whether it functions at a reduced level or fails completely, does so in a way that protects people, property, or data from injury, damage, intrusion, or disclosure. In computers, a program might fail-safe by executing a graceful exit (as opposed to an uncontrolled crash) in order to prevent data corruption after experiencing an error. A similar distinction is made between \\"failing well\\" and \\"failing badly\\". Fail-deadly is the opposite strategy, which can be used in weapon systems that are designed to kill or injure targets even if part of the system is damaged or destroyed. A system that is designed to experience graceful degradation, or to fail soft (used in computing, similar to \\"fail safe\\"Stallings, W (2009): Operating Systems. Internals and Design Principles, sixth edition) operates at a reduced level of performance after some component failures. For example, a building may operate lighting at reduced levels and elevators at reduced speeds if grid power fails, rather than either trapping people in the dark completely or continuing to operate at full power. In computing an example of graceful degradation is that if insufficient network bandwidth is available to stream an online video, a lower-resolution version might be streamed in place of the high-resolution version. Progressive enhancement is an example in computing, where web pages are available in a basic functional format for older, small-screen, or limited-capability web browsers, but in an enhanced version for browsers capable of handling additional technologies or that have a larger display available. In fault-tolerant computer systems, programs that are considered robust are designed to continue operation despite an error, exception, or invalid input, instead of crashing completely. Software brittleness is the opposite of robustness. Resilient networks continue to transmit data despite the failure of some links or nodes; resilient buildings and infrastructure are likewise expected to prevent complete failure in situations like earthquakes, floods, or collisions. A system with high failure transparency will alert users that a component failure has occurred, even if it continues to operate with full performance, so that failure can be repaired or imminent complete failure anticipated. Likewise, a fail-fast component is designed to report at the first point of failure, rather than allow downstream components to fail and generate reports then. This allows easier diagnosis of the underlying problem, and may prevent improper operation in a broken state. =Single fault condition= A single fault condition is a situation where one means for protection against a hazard is defective. If a single fault condition results unavoidably in another single fault condition, the two failures are considered as one single fault condition. A source offers the following example: Redundancy Redundancy is the provision of functional capabilities that would be unnecessary in a fault-free environment.Laprie, J. C. (1985). \\"Dependable Computing and Fault Tolerance: Concepts and Terminology\\", Proceedings of 15th International Symposium on Fault-Tolerant Computing (FTSC-15), pp. 2‚Äì11 This can consist of backup components that automatically \\"kick in\\" if one component fails. For example, large cargo trucks can lose a tire without any major consequences. They have many tires, and no one tire is critical (with the exception of the front tires, which are used to steer, but generally carry less load, each and in total, than the other four to 16, so are less likely to fail). The idea of incorporating redundancy in order to improve the reliability of a system was pioneered by John von Neumann in the 1950s.von Neumann, J.

(1976). \\"Fault-Tolerant Systems\\", IEEE Transactions on Computers, vol. 25, no. 12, pp. 1304‚Äì1312 space redundancy and time redundancy. Space redundancy provides additional components, functions, or data items that are unnecessary for fault-free operation. Space redundancy is further classified into hardware, software and information redundancy, depending on the type of redundant resources added to the system. In time redundancy the computation or data transmission is repeated and the result is compared to a stored copy of the previous result. The current terminology for this kind of testing is referred to as 'In Service Fault Tolerance Testing or ISFTT for short. Criteria Providing fault-tolerant design for every component is normally not an option. Associated redundancy brings a number of penalties: increase in weight, size, power consumption, cost, as well as time to design, verify, and test. Therefore, a number of choices have to be examined to determine which components should be fault tolerant:Dubrova, E. (2013). \\"Fault-Tolerant Design\\", Springer, 2013, * How critical is the component? In a car, the radio is not critical, so this component has less need for fault tolerance. * How likely is the component to fail? Some components, like the drive shaft in a car, are not likely to fail, so no fault tolerance is needed. * How expensive is it to make the component fault tolerant? Requiring a redundant car engine, for example, would likely be too expensive both economically and in terms of weight and space, to be considered. An example of a component that passes all the tests is a car's occupant restraint system. While we do not normally think of the primary occupant restraint system, it is gravity. If the vehicle rolls over or undergoes severe g-forces, then this primary method of occupant restraint may fail. Restraining the occupants during such an accident is absolutely critical to safety, so we pass the first test. Accidents causing occupant ejection were quite common before seat belts, so we pass the second test. The cost of a redundant restraint method like seat belts is quite low, both economically and in terms of weight and space, so we pass the third test. Therefore, adding seat belts to all vehicles is an excellent idea. Other \\"supplemental restraint systems\\", such as airbags, are more expensive and so pass that test by a smaller margin. Another excellent and long-term example of this principle being put into practice is the braking system: whilst the actual brake mechanisms are critical, they are not particularly prone to sudden (rather than progressive) failure, and are in any case necessarily duplicated to allow even and balanced application of brake force to all wheels. It would also be prohibitively costly to further double-up the main components and they would add considerable weight. However, the similarly critical systems for actuating the brakes under driver control are inherently less robust, generally using a cable (can rust, stretch, jam, snap) or hydraulic fluid (can leak, boil and develop bubbles, absorb water and thus lose effectiveness). Thus in most modern cars the footbrake hydraulic brake circuit is diagonally divided to give two smaller points of failure, the loss of either only reducing brake power by 50% and not causing as much dangerous brakeforce imbalance as a straight front-back or left-right split, and should the hydraulic circuit fail completely (a relatively very rare occurrence), there is a failsafe in the form of the cable-actuated parking brake that operates the otherwise relatively weak rear brakes, but can still bring the vehicle to a safe halt in conjunction with transmission/engine braking so long as the demands on it are in line with normal traffic flow. The cumulatively unlikely combination of total foot brake failure with the need for harsh braking in an emergency will likely result in a collision, but still one at lower speed than would otherwise have been the case. In comparison with the foot pedal activated service brake, the parking brake itself is a less critical item, and unless it is being used as a one-time backup for the footbrake, will not cause immediate danger if it is found to be nonfunctional at the moment of application. Therefore, no redundancy is built into it per se (and it typically uses a cheaper, lighter, but less hardwearing cable actuation system), and it can suffice, if this happens on a hill, to use the footbrake to momentarily hold the vehicle still, before driving off to find a flat piece of road on which to stop. Alternatively, on shallow gradients, the transmission can be shifted into Park, Reverse or First gear, and the transmission lock / engine compression used to hold it stationary, as there is no need for them to include the sophistication to first bring it to a halt. On motorcycles, a similar level of fail-safety is provided by simpler methods; firstly the front and rear brake systems being entirely separate, regardless of their method of activation (that can be cable, rod or hydraulic), allowing one to fail entirely whilst leaving the other unaffected. Secondly, the rear brake is relatively strong compared to its automotive cousin, even being a powerful disc on sports models, even though the usual intent is for the front system to provide the vast majority of braking force; as the overall vehicle weight is more central, the rear tyre is generally larger and grippier, and the rider can lean back to put more weight on it, therefore allowing more brake force to be applied before the wheel locks up. On cheaper, slower utility-class machines, even if the front wheel should use a hydraulic disc for extra brake force and easier packaging, the rear will usually be a primitive, somewhat inefficient, but exceptionally robust rod-actuated drum, thanks to the ease of connecting the footpedal to the wheel in this way and, more importantly, the near impossibility of catastrophic failure even if the rest of the machine, like a lot of low-priced bikes after their first few years of use, is on the point of collapse from neglected maintenance. Requirements The basic characteristics of fault tolerance require: # No single point of failure ‚Äì If a system experiences a failure, it must continue to operate without interruption during the repair process. # Fault isolation to the failing component ‚Äì When a failure occurs, the system must be able to isolate the failure to the offending component. This requires the addition of dedicated failure detection mechanisms that exist only for the purpose of fault isolation. Recovery from a fault condition requires classifying the fault or failing component. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) categorizes faults based on locality, cause, duration, and effect. # Fault containment to prevent propagation of the failure ‚Äì Some failure mechanisms can cause a system to fail by propagating the failure to the rest of the system. An example of this kind of failure is the \\"rogue transmitter\\" that can swamp legitimate communication in a system and cause overall system failure. Firewalls or other mechanisms that isolate a rogue transmitter or failing component to protect the system are required. # Availability of reversion modes In addition, fault-tolerant systems are characterized in terms of both planned service outages and unplanned service outages. These are usually measured at the application level and not just at a hardware level. The figure of merit is called availability and is expressed as a percentage. For example, a five nines system would statistically provide 99.999% availability. Fault- tolerant systems are typically based on the concept of redundancy.  Fault tolerance techniques  Research into the kinds of tolerances needed for critical systems involves a large amount of interdisciplinary work. The more complex the system, the more carefully all possible interactions have to be considered and prepared for. Considering the importance of high-value systems in transport, public utilities and the military, the field of topics that touch on research is very wide: it can include such obvious subjects as software modeling and reliability, or hardware design, to arcane elements such as stochastic models, graph theory, formal or exclusionary logic, parallel processing, remote data transmission, and more. =Replication= Spare components address the first fundamental characteristic of fault tolerance in three ways: * Replication: Providing multiple identical instances of the same system or subsystem, directing tasks or requests to all of them in parallel, and choosing the correct result on the basis of a quorum; * Redundancy: Providing multiple identical instances of the same system and switching to one of the remaining instances in case of a failure (failover); * Diversity: Providing multiple different implementations of the same specification, and using them like replicated systems to cope with errors in a specific implementation. All implementations of RAID, redundant array of independent disks, except RAID 0, are examples of a fault-tolerant storage device that uses data redundancy. A lockstep fault-tolerant machine uses replicated elements operating in parallel. At any time, all the replications of each element should be in the same state. The same inputs are provided to each replication, and the same outputs are expected. The outputs of the replications are compared using a voting circuit. A machine with two replications of each element is termed dual modular redundant (DMR). The voting circuit can then only detect a mismatch and recovery relies on other methods. A machine with three replications of each element is termed triple modular redundant (TMR). The voting circuit can determine which replication is in error when a two-to-one vote is observed. In this case, the voting circuit can output the correct result, and discard the erroneous version. After this, the internal state of the erroneous replication is assumed to be different from that of the other two, and the voting circuit can switch to a DMR mode. This model can be applied to any larger number of replications. Lockstep fault-tolerant machines are most easily made fully synchronous, with each gate of each replication making the same state transition on the same edge of the clock, and the clocks to the replications being exactly in phase. However, it is possible to build lockstep systems without this requirement. Bringing the replications into synchrony requires making their internal stored states the same. They can be started from a fixed initial state, such as the reset state. Alternatively, the internal state of one replica can be copied to another replica. One variant of DMR is pair-and-spare. Two replicated elements operate in lockstep as a pair, with a voting circuit that detects any mismatch between their operations and outputs a signal indicating that there is an error. Another pair operates exactly the same way. A final circuit selects the output of the pair that does not proclaim that it is in error. Pair-and-spare requires four replicas rather than the three of TMR, but has been used commercially. =Failure-oblivious computing= Failure-oblivious computing is a technique that enables computer programs to continue executing despite errors. The technique can be applied in different contexts. First, it can handle invalid memory reads by returning a manufactured value to the program, which in turn, makes use of the manufactured value and ignores the former memory value it tried to access, this is a great contrast to typical memory checkers, which inform the program of the error or abort the program. Second it can be applied to exceptions where some catch blocks are written or synthesized to catch unexpected exceptions. Furthermore, it happens that the execution is modified several times in a row, in order to prevent cascading failures. The approach has performance costs: because the technique rewrites code to insert dynamic checks for address validity, execution time will increase by 80% to 500%. =Recovery shepherding= Recovery shepherding is a lightweight technique to enable software programs to recover from otherwise fatal errors such as null pointer dereference and divide by zero. Comparing to the failure oblivious computing technique, recovery shepherding works on the compiled program binary directly and does not need to recompile to program. It uses the just-in-time binary instrumentation framework Pin. It attaches to the application process when an error occurs, repairs the execution, tracks the repair effects as the execution continues, contains the repair effects within the application process, and detaches from the process after all repair effects are flushed from the process state. It does not interfere with the normal execution of the program and therefore incurs negligible overhead. For 17 of 18 systematically collected real world null-dereference and divide-by- zero errors, a prototype implementation enables the application to continue to execute to provide acceptable output and service to its users on the error- triggering inputs. =Circuit breaker= The circuit breaker design pattern is a technique to avoid catastrophic failures in distributed systems. Disadvantages Fault-tolerant design's advantages are obvious, while many of its disadvantages are not: * Interference with fault detection in the same component. To continue the above passenger vehicle example, with either of the fault-tolerant systems it may not be obvious to the driver when a tire has been punctured. This is usually handled with a separate \\"automated fault- detection system\\". In the case of the tire, an air pressure monitor detects the loss of pressure and notifies the driver. The alternative is a \\"manual fault-detection system\\", such as manually inspecting all tires at each stop. * Interference with fault detection in another component. Another variation of this problem is when fault tolerance in one component prevents fault detection in a different component. For example, if component B performs some operation based on the output from component A, then fault tolerance in B can hide a problem with A. If component B is later changed (to a less fault-tolerant design) the system may fail suddenly, making it appear that the new component B is the problem. Only after the system has been carefully scrutinized will it become clear that the root problem is actually with component A. * Reduction of priority of fault correction. Even if the operator is aware of the fault, having a fault-tolerant system is likely to reduce the importance of repairing the fault. If the faults are not corrected, this will eventually lead to system failure, when the fault-tolerant component fails completely or when all redundant components have also failed. * Test difficulty. For certain critical fault-tolerant systems, such as a nuclear reactor, there is no easy way to verify that the backup components are functional. The most infamous example of this is Chernobyl, where operators tested the emergency backup cooling by disabling primary and secondary cooling. The backup failed, resulting in a core meltdown and massive release of radiation. * Cost. Both fault-tolerant components and redundant components tend to increase cost. This can be a purely economic cost or can include other measures, such as weight. Manned spaceships, for example, have so many redundant and fault-tolerant components that their weight is increased dramatically over unmanned systems, which don't require the same level of safety. * Inferior components. A fault-tolerant design may allow for the use of inferior components, which would have otherwise made the system inoperable. While this practice has the potential to mitigate the cost increase, use of multiple inferior components may lower the reliability of the system to a level equal to, or even worse than, a comparable non-fault-tolerant system. Examples Hardware fault tolerance sometimes requires that broken parts be taken out and replaced with new parts while the system is still operational (in computing known as hot swapping). Such a system implemented with a single backup is known as single point tolerant and represents the vast majority of fault-tolerant systems. In such systems the mean time between failures should be long enough for the operators to have time to fix the broken devices (mean time to repair) before the backup also fails. It helps if the time between failures is as long as possible, but this is not specifically required in a fault-tolerant system. Fault tolerance is notably successful in computer applications. Tandem Computers built their entire business on such machines, which used single-point tolerance to create their NonStop systems with uptimes measured in years. Fail-safe architectures may encompass also the computer software, for example by process replication. Data formats may also be designed to degrade gracefully. HTML for example, is designed to be forward compatible, allowing new HTML entities to be ignored by Web browsers that do not understand them without causing the document to be unusable. Related terms There is a difference between fault tolerance and systems that rarely have problems. For instance, the Western Electric crossbar systems had failure rates of two hours per forty years, and therefore were highly fault resistant. But when a fault did occur they still stopped operating completely, and therefore were not fault tolerant.

Thus most Mongol conquest and plundering took place during the warmer seasons, when there was sufficient grazing for their herds. The rise of the Mongols was preceded by 15 years of wet and warm weather conditions from 1211-1225 that allowed favourable conditions for the breeding of horses, which greatly assisted their expansion.

Barrel by barrel botanicals are infused in the spirit-water; a mix to create a so-called \\"Riga Black Balsam essence\\". After that, the essence is blended with the rest of the ingredients and bottled in ceramic bottles. Riga Black Balsam is produced by JSC Latvijas Balzams and has received more than 100 awards at international fairs throughout its history.Riga Black Balsam History  Recipe  The traditional recipe was created in 1752 by Abraham Kunze, a pharmacist living in Riga. It consists of 24 natural ingredients, including 17 botanicals ‚Äì bilberries/blueberries, raspberries, birch buds, bitterwort root, peppermint leaves, Artemisia absinthium stalks and leaves, ginger root, Valerian root, sweet flag root, Melissa officinalis leaves and stems, Tilia cordata blossom, oak bark, St John's wort, buckbean leaves, black pepper, Citrus aurantium skins and nutmeg. According to tradition only the Head Liquor Master and several of his apprentices know the exact secret recipe. The original recipe was lost during the resettlement of Baltic Germans or the following World War II. After the war, the recipe was carefully restored by a joint effort of former employees. Since then the recipe has remained unchanged.

Sims) is the stage name of Matthew Sims, a Berlin-based American DJ, performance artist and producer. A native of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Sims began his career in the local music scene. Sims was involved in several groups, the most notable of which was Citizen King, an Alternative Rock band famous for their 1999 hit \\"Better Days (And the Bottom Drops Out)\\", which reached #25 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. However, Citizen King would not see any further success, and the band disbanded by 2002. Around the same time, Sims relocated to Los Angeles, where he continued his music career as a solo artist. Starting Mount Sims as an electronic music act, later releases have also shown influences from post punk, new wave, and Dark wave. Sims is almost exclusively responsible for every aspect of his music, providing vocals, instrumentation, and production. He was originally supported by two dancers, whereas the last incarnation under the altered spelling Mt. Sims was a three-piece band that included Rand Twigg on bass and Andre Lange on drums. His first album, \\"Ultra Sex\\" on International DeeJay Gigolo Records in Europe and Emperor Norton Records the US, was released to good reviews. It was influenced by German and British New Wave bands, funk, and electronica. It was a concept album that focused on the themes of technology and sexuality. The album contains the tracks \\"How We Do\\" and \\"Rational Behaviour\\". Mount Sims' second album \\"Wild Light\\" (Released in 2005 on International DeeJay Gigolo Records) is a much darker album than the previous release. Its themes are death and information. Major musical influences are dark wave and post- punk. David J of Bauhaus played bass on some of Wild Light's songs. Roger Joseph Manning, Jr. was responsible for some of the synth production. It contains the songs \\"No Yellow lines,\\" \\"Lights on,\\" and \\"Restless,\\" a single featured in Amped 3. Mount Sims is responsible for Madonna's remixes of her song \\"Nobody Knows Me\\", from her 2003 album American Life, in which he was noted to time compress a speech by Charles Manson in order to construct different electronic drums, which he then placed in the remix. In addition, Mount Sims' song \\"Torn into\\" was featured in the film Lost in Translation. Mt. Sims' third album \\"Happily Ever After\\" (2008/Hungry Eye Records) continues on the influences of the previous release with its themes focusing on obsession, isolation, horror, and madness. It was produced by Thomas Stern of Crime & the City Solution and features guest appearances by Jessie Evans (formerly of Subtonix, Autonervous, and The Vanishing), Toby Dammit (Swans, The Residents, and Iggy Pop), and Bryan Black (Motor). The album artwork was created by Peter Wu with layout by Dez of Crossover. In 2008, he joined the band The Silures, which was founded by Vitalic and Linda Lamb in 2002. In 2009, he quit the group. In 2010, he collaborated with The Knife and Planningtorock on the electronic opera Tomorrow, In a Year. It is based on Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species and was released as a studio album. It was also in 2010 that he collaborated with Warp Records artist Leila for her album U&I;, of which he contributed his voice to her electronic compositions.

It is located within the City of Joondalup. The name was coined by developers in the 1970s from the line of a reef visible several kilometres offshore. The name was formally adopted in 1974, replacing the prior name of Beaumaris, a name still retained by one of the shopping centres and one primary school. The suburb is divided in two by Hodges Drive, with the development to the south often referred to as 'old' Ocean Reef (there are only a few years between the two). The boat harbour sits on this midway point at the western end of Hodges Drive, and there is a shopping centre in each end of the suburb - Beaumaris Shopping Centre in the north and Ocean Reef Shopping Centre to the south. Roadworks have recently been completed to extend the foreshore road from Hodges Drive (south) to Shenton Ave (north), extending the 'Sunset Coast' drive into the adjacent suburb of Iluka. Located some 8 km north of the popular Hillarys Boat Harbour, the Ocean Reef Boat Harbour provides a public launching ramp for boats and a small fishing harbour. During recent years the City of Joondalup has prepared concept plans for the development of a world class recreational, residential, boating and tourism marina at the Ocean Reef Boat Harbour site (Ocean Reef Marina). The proposed development encapsulates high levels of environmental sustainability and community amenity. In 2009 the City of Joondalup asked the people of Ocean Reef and the surrounding suburbs what they thought of the proposed development. Out of a total of 11,728 survey respondents, an overwhelming majority - 93.9% - were in favour of developing the site and 95.6% approved of the concept plan. The Council has endorsed proceeding with the preparation of the necessary Business Case and Structure Plan for government approval. Ocean Reef is served by three primary schools (Beaumaris Primary, St Simon Peter Catholic Primary, and Ocean Reef Primary). A dune walkway and cycle path hugs the coast from south to north, offering access to several small beaches, picnic areas, rest stops, and access paths into the suburb itself. A large protected dune area which is at times around 400 metres wide separates the houses from the Indian Ocean.  Demographics  In the , Ocean Reef had a population of 7,840; 50% male and 50% female. The median age of Ocean Reef residents was 42, and median weekly personal income was $760. Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people made up 0.6% of the population. The most popular religious affiliations in descending order in the 2016 census were No Religion 29.9%, Catholic 26.7%, Anglican 18.9%, Not Stated 7.4% and Christian, nfd 2.6%.

The straight man among his group of friends, this semi-fictionalized version of comedian Jerry Seinfeld was named after, co-created by, based on, and played by Seinfeld himself. The series revolves around Jerry's misadventures with his best friend George Costanza, neighbor Cosmo Kramer, and ex-girlfriend Elaine Benes. He is usually the voice of reason amidst his friends' antics and the focal point of the relationship. An eternal optimist, he rarely runs into major personal problems. Jerry is the only main character on the show to maintain the same career (a stand-up comedian, like the real Seinfeld) throughout the series. He is the most observational character, sarcastically commenting on his friends' quirky habits. Much of the show's action takes place in Jerry's apartment located in New York City at 129 West 81st Street, apartment 5A. He and his friends also frequently have coffee or meals together at Monk's Caf√©. Jerry appeared in all 180 episodes of Seinfeld (including several two-part episodes) and is the only character in the show to appear in every episode.Neither George nor Kramer appear in \\"The Pen\\"; Elaine does not appear in the pilot, \\"The Trip, Part I\\" and \\"The Trip, Part II\\"; Kramer also does not appear in \\"The Chinese Restaurant\\". Personality In the show's setting, Jerry is the straight man, a figure who is \\"able to observe the chaos around him but not always be a part of it.\\"BBC Comedy Guide: Seinfeld Plot lines involving Jerry often concern his various relationships ‚Äì Jerry often finds \\"stupid reasons to break up\\" with women; which, according to Elaine, occurs \\"every week.\\" Jerry is generally completely indifferent to what goes on in his friends' lives, seeing their misery as merely an entertaining distraction, as well as an opportunity for joke material. He often plays along with their hare-brained schemes, even encouraging them, often just to see them fail. In the episode \\"The Serenity Now\\", Jerry is perplexed by his experience of crying, asking \\"What is this salty discharge?\\". In \\"The Foundation\\" Elaine points out that he has \\"never felt remorse,\\" to which Jerry replies, \\"Yeah, I feel kinda bad about that.\\" He will often nonchalantly state, \\"That's a shame\\" when something bad happens (often due to his or his friends' actions). A recurring joke is Jerry behaving unchivalrously towards Elaine, such as not helping her carry groceries or heavy objects, ignoring her when she is upset, and on one occasion taking a first class upgrade on a flight for himself, leaving Elaine in economy. Jerry, George and Elaine all share a general trait of not letting go of other character's remarks and going to great lengths to be proven right. In one episode, Jerry goes out of his way to rent a house in Tuscany, just because Elaine's boyfriend told him there weren't any available. Another example is when he buys his parents the same car over and over again, at great financial loss. Despite his usual indifference to his friends and their actions, Jerry apparently is very satisfied with his life, to the point that he actually feels worried about anything that might threaten the group lifestyle. In \\"The Invitations\\", for example, Jerry admits that he feels depressed about George getting married, seeing as how George will eventually leave the group and Jerry will never see him again. Once Elaine told him that she was also \\"getting out\\" of the group, Jerry became so worried about a near future of just him and Kramer that he unknowingly almost walked into a car while crossing the street. In \\"The Bizarro Jerry\\", Jerry also grows panicky about losing the group dynamic when Kramer becomes too busy with his fake job and Elaine temporarily leaves to join the Bizarro group, claiming that \\"The whole system's breaking down!\\" Jerry himself perfectly sums up his relation to his three friends in the episode \\"The Letter\\". In a deleted scene from that show, he claims that his friends are \\"not more important\\" than his girlfriends, but \\"they're as important.\\" Unlike George and Elaine, Jerry rarely runs into major personal problems. In \\"The Opposite\\", this tendency is explicitly pointed out, as Jerry goes through a number of experiences after which he invariably \\"breaks even\\", even as his friends are going through intense periods of success or failure. Even when Elaine threw Jerry's $20 bill out of the window, he unexpectedly found one in his coat pocket, evening out his luck. In \\"The Rye\\", during a particularly trying time for Elaine, she angrily tells Jerry, \\"You know, one of these days, something terrible is going to happen to you. It has to!\\" Jerry simply replies, \\"No, I'm going to be just fine.\\" Many of the problems he does run into are the result of the actions of his nemesis Newman, a disgruntled postal worker. In \\"The Old Man\\", George asks \\"What kind of a person are you?\\" in which Jerry replies \\"I think I'm pretty much like you, only successful.\\" However, Kramer persuades Jerry to do things that he's reluctant to do. In \\"The Mango\\", Kramer gets Jerry to buy fruit for him after Kramer is banned from the store over an argument with the owner. This continues until the owner bans Jerry, because his order is similar enough to Kramer's that it's obvious he's buying fruit for Kramer. The most famous example is in \\"The Chicken Roaster\\" in which Kramer and Jerry exchange apartments. This results in the two of them also switching personalities. In several arguments with Jerry, Kramer is incredibly stubborn, protecting his own interests. Examples of this include arguments in \\"The Chaperone\\", \\"The Face Painter\\" and \\"The Caddy\\". Probably the only exception is \\"The Kiss Hello\\" in which Kramer kissed Jerry as George walked in. Jerry always wears a suit whenever he has to do his stand-up comedy act. In a few cases, Jerry wears an unusual item of clothing. Kramer has persuaded Jerry to wear the \\"pirate shirt\\" in \\"The Puffy Shirt\\", the cowboy boots in \\"The Mom & Pop Store\\" and the fur coat in \\"The Reverse Peephole\\". Like George, Jerry's hairstyle remains relatively the same throughout the series, though the length and thickness of it alters, especially from Season 3 onwards. There is one noticeable episode in which Jerry receives a bad haircut when he reluctantly agrees to get his hair done by an incompetent Italian barber in \\"The Barber\\". As in real life, Jerry is a fan of comic book characters, particularly of Superman, who is his hero. As far as sports, Jerry is a fan of the New York Mets as evidenced as early as the episode \\"The Baby Shower\\" in which Kramer persuades him to install illegal cable by saying \\"The Mets have 75 games on cable this year.\\" Jerry is also a fan of the New York Yankees, the New York Knicks, the New York Giants, the New York Rangers, and even the Chicago Cubs. In early episodes, a New York Yankees hat sits on the counter near his computer. Later on, by the middle of Season 3, it was replaced with a Mets cap, possibly to better reflect Seinfeld's real-life support of the Queens side. While a Mets fan, he has once attended a Yankees games (in the sixth season). In the first episode of Season 6 and the first episode of Season 7, Jerry is shown watching a Yankees game with George. Jerry never smokes a cigarette but is seen smoking a cigar in \\"The Calzone\\", \\"The Wizard\\" and \\"The Voice\\". Jerry also does not appear to have any particular interest in alcohol as he is rarely seen drinking beer or any other alcoholic beverage; however, he is seen drinking beer with George once in \\"The Shower Head\\", wine at various meals, and keeps a bottle of Hennigan's scotch in his apartment, though he claims that he only uses it as a paint thinner. He is also seen doing a shot of Hennigans during season 3 episode 12 ‚ÄòThe Red Dot‚Äô when he is trying to lie for George's tight spending habits relating to a gift he bought for Elaine Background Jerry and George grew up in New York City. George recalls in \\"The Outing\\" that the two were friends ever since an encounter in gym class in their school days. In \\"The Betrayal\\", Jerry mentions that he once beat George up in the fourth grade. Flashbacks in episodes such as \\"The Library\\" portray Jerry and George in high school. A pizza place which they frequented is portrayed in \\"The Frogger\\". Jerry and George attended school together at Edward R. Murrow Middle School, John F. Kennedy High School and Queens College. After college, Jerry briefly worked as an umbrella salesman and claims to have invented the \\"twirl\\" to make the umbrella look more attractive. He eventually quit the job in order to focus more on his comedy career. Family Jerry's parents are Morty and Helen Seinfeld, a retired Jewish couple living in Florida. Unlike George, who usually can't stand his parents, Jerry gets along reasonably well with his parents, but he still prefers they live in Florida rather than New York, so that they do not interfere with his private life (a ‚Äúbuffer zone‚Äù). Although born and raised Jewish and he considers himself a Jew, Jerry apparently does not practice and generally does not observe many traditions. In \\"The Bris\\", he implies he is circumcised, repeatedly asking people if they have \\"ever seen one\\" - in reference to an uncircumcised penis. He also mentions having a sister in the episode \\"The Chinese Restaurant\\", though she is never named, never appears on screen, and is never mentioned again after this episode. In order to avoid his old friend Joel in \\"Male Unbonding\\", Jerry pretends to have promised to tutor his nephew; it is unclear if the nephew really exists or is simply fabricated as part of the excuse. Jerry has an eccentric uncle, Leo, who appears in 15 episodes. Uncle Leo has a son, Cousin Jeffrey, who works for the parks department, about whom he constantly talks, but who never appears. In \\"The Stake Out\\", Jerry speaks to an \\"Uncle Mac\\", as well as a cousin \\"Artie Levine\\". In \\"The Truth\\", Jerry mentions a cousin named \\"Douglass\\" who has an addiction with Pepsi. In \\"The Pony Remark\\", Helen, Morty, Jerry, Elaine and Leo attend a 50th-anniversary party for Manya and Isaac, an elderly couple whose relationship to Jerry is never explicitly defined. Manya is described as a Polish immigrant. In the same episode, Jerry references having an \\"Aunt Rose\\", and Helen mentions a family member named \\"Claire\\" who is getting married. In \\"The Soup\\" episode, Jerry mentions an \\"Aunt Silvia\\", who he compares to Elaine in terms of conversation. Jerry's maternal grandmother, Nana, is an elderly woman with memory problems, occasionally unable to tell the past from the present, living alone in the city. Nana makes appearances in \\"The Pledge Drive\\", \\"The Kiss Hello\\" and \\"The Doodle\\". Relationships Jerry is notorious for his detached approach towards relationships and for breaking up with women for the slightest of flaws or for the most minor of reasons. According to the ninth-season DVD release of the series, Jerry has had 73 different girlfriends seen or alluded to over the course of the series. =Elaine= Jerry and Elaine are depicted as having dated in the past and apparently a lot longer than they each date other people in the series. During the run of the show, they are shown mainly as best friends, sometimes even joking with one another about their failed dating relationship. However, they do date briefly during the run of the show. In \\"The Deal\\", they create a set of rules whereby they can sleep together but remain only friends. However, their theory is ruined when Elaine gets upset at Jerry for wanting to leave after a sexual encounter instead of sleeping over (one of the rules they discussed was that sleeping over was optional, but not whose option it was). By the end of the episode the two decide to be a couple again. Later in \\"The Pen\\" Jerry tells his parents that \\"we decided that we don't work out as a couple.\\" That is the only time in the run of the show they are shown as anything more than friends. In \\"The Mango\\", Jerry is upset at learning that Elaine had faked her orgasms while they were together. The fact cause such problems between the two, that Elaine agrees to sleep with Jerry in an effort to \\"save the friendship\\". The final scene, however, shows the two in bed, with Jerry looking distraught and gesturing towards his groin, suggesting that he was unable to perform. Elaine then asks if there is any mango left, with a stunned Jerry then taking some and successfully giving Elaine an orgasm off- screen. There are hints throughout the series that suggest that Jerry and Elaine still have feelings for each other: *In \\"The Stake Out\\", Elaine becomes jealous when Jerry flirts with another woman, Vanessa, at a party that Jerry is accompanying her to. *In \\"The Tape\\" when Jerry listens to an erotic message on his tape recorder, he becomes obsessed with finding who's the person on the tape; eventually, he pushes George into revealing that it's Elaine and it was supposed to be a joke. *In \\"The Junior Mint\\", Elaine asks Jerry to accompany her to the hospital as her boyfriend, Roy, to fool one of her ex's. Jerry smiles and responds \\"Well, I believe I've played that role before to some critical acclaim.\\" At the hospital, Jerry appears annoyed when Elaine begins to show interest in her ex once again (due to her ex having lost weight), although this may be because he was bored of her ignoring him or to tease her for his own amusement. *In \\"The Cadillac\\" after Jerry buys his parents a Cadillac and Elaine realizes how much money he has, she becomes very flirtatious towards him. *In \\"The Abstinence\\" when Elaine is denying sex to her current boyfriend, Ben, in the hope that it will help him pass his medical licensing exam, she begs Jerry to have sex with her, but, after a brief moment of consideration, he turns her down. *In \\"The Serenity Now\\" when Jerry's emotions come flooding out after being locked up inside him, he confesses his love for Elaine and proposes to her. Later, the horrifying tale of George's life frightens him back into his formerly cold demeanor and he takes back his proposal, much to Elaine's dismay since she was willing to get married (even though she was initially hesitant). *In \\"The Finale\\", when their plane appears to be crashing, Elaine begins saying to Jerry \\"I've always loved...\\", but is interrupted as the plane levels out. Later on, she claims that she intended to say \\"I've always loved United Airlines.\\" =Long term relationships= Other than Elaine, Jerry has only dated a few other women for more than one episode: * He starts dating Vanessa in \\"The Stake Out\\" and breaks up with her in \\"The Stock Tip\\". They break up because of an uncomfortable weekend trip to Vermont. * He dates Marla, a virginal woman in the closet business, in \\"The Virgin\\" and \\"The Contest\\" and Tia, a model, in \\"The Airport\\" and \\"The Pick\\". These relationships are atypical in that both women break up with Jerry for reasons of disgust, rather than it being the other way around. * He dates Dolores (whose name he forgets, guessing it to be Mulva, having the clue that it rhymes with a part of the female anatomy) in \\"The Junior Mint\\" and \\"The Foundation\\". (Season 4 then Season 8). This was the only time he dated a woman in two non-consecutive episodes. * He dated Rachel in the following episodes: \\"The Raincoats, Part I\\" (a two-part episode), \\"The Hamptons\\", and \\"The Opposite\\". Rachel ends the relationship, but Jerry, who was \\"even steven\\" at the time, didn't become upset, and was confident that he would find another girlfriend. =Engagements= Only twice in the series has Jerry considered marriage. * The first time was with his \\"perfect\\" girlfriend, Jeannie, in the Season 7 finale, \\"The Invitations\\", but he soon learned that he didn't want to be with someone exactly like himself. In the first Season 8 episode, \\"The Foundation\\", Jerry tells Elaine that he had a perfectly mutual break-up with Jeannie over the summer. * Jerry almost got engaged a second time, to Elaine. In the Season 9 episode \\"The Serenity Now\\", after Jerry undergoes a personality change and becomes deeply sensitive and emotional, he proposes to a shocked Elaine. She leaves the apartment, but returns later to accept his proposal. By that point, however, he had gone back to his old self and he turns her down. =Breakups= Jerry's approach to relationships is notoriously fickle, and he has broken up with women, or provoked them into breaking up with him for trivial reasons. *For eating her peas one at a time (\\"The Engagement\\"). *For refusing to taste his pie at the coffee shop (\\"The Pie\\"). *Because she once dated Newman (\\"The Big Salad\\"). *Because she would not give him a massage (\\"The Masseuse\\"). *Because she got covered in toilet water after a pipe exploded (\\"The Pothole\\") *Because she liked a commercial that he hated (\\"The Phone Message\\"). *Because she had large thick hands like a man's (\\"The Bizarro Jerry\\"). *Because she never laughed at his jokes (\\"The Switch\\"). *Because she had an irritating laugh (\\"The Bubble Boy\\"). *Because she seemingly encouraged people to mistake her as being Chinese (\\"The Chinese Woman\\") *Because only his parents like her (\\"The Van Buren Boys\\") Likewise, some of Jerry's girlfriends have dumped him for trivial reasons. *Because he admitted to changing the size 32 to size 31 of all his jeans because he \\"doesn't want to be a 32\\" (\\"The Sponge\\"). *For snooping around her closet having become suspicious of her wearing the same dress on every date (\\"The Seven\\"). *Because he is caught spitting out fatty meats his girlfriend cooked for him in to napkins after going on a health kick (\\"The Wink\\"). *Because she discovered he'd been getting her drunk so he and his friends could play with her collection of antique toys (\\"The Merv Griffin Show\\"). *Because he refuses to use her toothbrush (\\"The Doodle\\") *Because he cheats on his pretend-wife to give another woman his family dry-cleaning discount (\\"The Wife\\"). *Because she thinks she saw him pick his nose, when Jerry was in fact only scratching it from the side (\\"The Pick\\"). *Because she did not think his stand-up comedy act was funny and refuses to date someone whose work she does not respect (\\"The Ex-Girlfriend\\"). In \\"The Invitations\\", Jerry and his fianc√©e had what he described as \\"the world's first truly mutual breakup\\" after she acted in the same manner as him, noting \\"I can't be with somebody like me. I hate myself.\\" =Guest star girlfriends= The following celebrities starred as Jerry's girlfriend or romantic interest: *Teri Hatcher in \\"The Implant\\" and in \\"The Finale\\". *Marcia Cross in \\"The Slicer\\". *Courteney Cox in \\"The Wife\\". *Jami Gertz in \\"The Stall\\". *Jane Leeves in \\"The Virgin\\", \\"The Contest\\", and \\"The Finale\\". *Jennifer Coolidge in \\"The Masseuse\\". *Janeane Garofalo in \\"The Invitations\\". *Kristin Davis in \\"The Pothole\\" and \\"The Butter Shave\\". *Amanda Peet in \\"The Summer of George\\". *Marlee Matlin in \\"The Lip Reader\\". *Catherine Keener in \\"The Letter\\". *Debra Messing in \\"The Wait Out\\" and in \\"The Yada Yada\\". *Christine Taylor in \\"The Van Buren Boys\\". *Lauren Graham in \\"The Millennium\\". *Lori Loughlin in \\"The Serenity Now\\". *Melinda Clarke in \\"The Muffin Tops\\". *A. J. Langer in \\"The Fatigues\\" *Paula Marshall in \\"The Outing\\" *Anna Gunn in \\"The Glasses\\" *Ali Wentworth in \\"The Soup Nazi\\". =Newman= Jerry has a long-running hatred of Newman, describing him as his \\"sworn enemy\\" in \\"The Andrea Doria\\" and showing general contempt for him at their every meeting. Newman usually reciprocates, although at other times he seems quite pleased by Jerry's hostility, as if it is a testimony to his effectiveness at irritating him. The origin of their feud is never explained. Jerry's snide greeting for him with \\"Hello, Newman\\" (in response to Newman's \\"Hello, Jerry\\") becomes a trademark of their relationship. Even Jerry's mother utters the greeting, with as much displeasure as Jerry, in \\"The Raincoats, Part II\\". Jerry wants to be rid of Newman so badly that he once even helped him on his postal route so that he could get a prized transfer to Hawaii (\\"The Andrea Doria\\"). Despite their antagonistic relationship, Jerry and Newman have ended up working in unison on rare occasions. In \\"The Sniffing Accountant\\", Jerry worked with Kramer and Newman to find out if their accountant was on drugs. In \\"The Soul Mate\\", Jerry and Newman help each other with their romance problems. Newman told Jerry about Kramer's crush on his then-girlfriend, Pam, while Jerry helps Newman get a chance to date Elaine. Certain instances would even define their relationship as one of friendship, or at least mutual tolerance, built around their shared friend, Kramer. In \\"The Pick\\", Jerry casually walks over to Newman's apartment and brings him back to his own, to examine Elaine's Christmas card. Newman apparently puts up little fight and doesn't make any sarcastic remarks, then leaves without a confrontation. In \\"The Old Man\\", Jerry says \\"my friends\\" in reference to Kramer and Newman and in \\"The Bottle Deposit\\" he has no qualms about leaving Kramer and Newman alone in his apartment, trusting they'll \\"keep an eye on one another.\\" In \\"The Barber\\", Jerry allows Newman to use his bathroom, albeit reluctantly, and even watches Edward Scissorhands with him. Career and finances Jerry is very successful financially, and occupationally stable in comparison with his friends (and perhaps with other stand-up comedians in general). He never seems to be at a loss for money, in comparison to both George and Elaine, whose careers go through both highs and lows but are often unsuccessful or short of money. Throughout the series Jerry suffers numerous financial and material losses, but these do not seem to have long-term impacts on his situation. Examples include: *Jerry buys his father a Cadillac Fleetwood and buys it back after his parents sell it, spending over $20,000. Jerry himself seems to only drive luxury European makes, such as a BMW 5 Series and a SAAB 900 Convertible, although in early episodes such as \\"The Ex-Girlfriend\\", he drives a mid-1970s American coupe, and also a Ford Econoline conversion van in \\"The Junk Mail\\". In \\"The Apartment\\", it is revealed that Jerry could easily lend Elaine $5,000 for an apartment. Also, Jerry is regularly called upon to pay the check for the group at Monk's and allows Kramer to depend on him for food. Despite his apparent financial security, his parents seem to think he needs money, offering to pay for everything when they visit him (even if they have no money, as seen in \\"The Watch\\") and occasionally urging him to find a new job. *In \\"The Checks\\", Jerry is revealed to be famous in Japan where he appears in the opening montage of Japanese TV's \\"Super Terrific Happy Hour\\" and he even continues to earn royalties from each appearance (although each royalty check is only for twelve cents, due to the heavy difference between the worth of Japanese and American currency.) *Jerry spends most of the series making a living from stand-up comedy, except for the periods when he and George co- write their own sitcom. Jerry also acts in the pilot episode of their show \\"Jerry\\", playing himself. *Twice, Jerry is encouraged to switch to a career at Bloomingdale's in their Executive Training Program. First his parents suggest it after he bounces a check; then in another episode, George and Kramer suggest it after he starts dating a \\"loser\\". While Jerry's career is successful and his opening and closing stand-up bits always go as planned, his stand-up performances depicted within the show occasionally go awry. *In \\"The Red Dot\\", an inebriated club patron cuts Jerry's stand-up short over the usage of the phrases \\"on the wagon\\" and \\"off the wagon\\". *In \\"The Trip, Part I\\", the hotel chambermaid throws Jerry's notes away causing him to stumble and bumble his way through a performance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. *In \\"The Fire\\", Jerry is thrown off his act by Kramer's girlfriend Toby, who heckles him and later sees his entire crowd run for the exits when George screams \\"he's got a gun!\\" when referring to a prop comic. *In \\"The Diplomat's Club\\", Jerry's manager warns him that the pilot of the plane in which he flew to the show in was in the audience. Jerry tells that there is no way that could bother him but when he takes the stage, he can't stop looking at the pilot. *In \\"The Abstinence\\", Jerry is twice bumped from playing an assembly at his old middle-school. When he finally takes the stage, he's promptly booed for his opening act about homework. David Letterman later calls him to bump him from the Late Show due to the poor middle-school performance. *In \\"The Butter Shave\\", Jerry intentionally performs hackneyed comedy material in a successful attempt to prove that, without his warming up the audience first, Kenny Bania, who performs following him, will not get any laughs. *In \\"The Finale, Part II\\", Jerry performs stand-up for his fellow inmates in jail but gets no laughs, except from Kramer, and is heckled and threatened by one of the prisoners. Cleanliness Jerry has an obsessive insistence on cleanliness and neatness. *In \\"The Pothole\\", Jerry inadvertently knocks his girlfriend's toothbrush into the toilet bowl, and after she uses it, he is unable to bring himself to kiss her. As revenge, she proceeds to put one item of his in the toilet without telling him what it was; a distraught Jerry, thinking it could be anything, ends up throwing away virtually every item in his apartment in panic. Upon learning it was the toilet brush, he reassures himself that it can be replaced (his girlfriend is later bombarded with toilet water following a plumbing accident in her bathroom, causing him to break up with her). Elaine says that in some instances, his cleanliness can verge into a serious disorder. *In \\"\\"The Outing\\", Jerry comments that most people think he's gay because he's \\"thin and neat\\". *In \\"The Statue\\", he is delighted to find how thorough his new cleaner has been, to the extent of decoagulating the dried matter from the nozzle of his bottle of dishwashing liquid. *In \\"The Voice\\", he throws out a belt because it touched the edge of a urinal. *In \\"The Butter Shave\\", he throws out a shoelace because it touched the floor of a public bathroom. *In \\"The Couch\\", after Poppie's gastro-intestinal disorder causes him to urinate on Jerry's couch, Jerry, rather than having the cushion cleaned, gives the couch away. *In \\"The Blood\\", when Kramer announces that he moved his blood from the blood bank into the building, Jerry panics until Kramer tells him that the blood is in his apartment. Jerry tells him that if any blood gets into his apartment he will \\"freak out\\". Later when Kramer's freezer breaks, Jerry freaks out again, checking his freezer for the blood, thinking that the bowl of jello and the jug of tomato juice is blood. Kramer proceeds to drink the juice, causing Jerry to freak out even more. * In \\"The Pie\\", Jerry is horrified when Poppie neglects to wash his hands after using the bathroom and refuses to eat the food Poppie prepares for him. * In \\"The Apology\\", while Elaine is talking to Jerry about a germaphobic woman in her office, Jerry starts meticulously cleaning a spot where Kramer spilled soda. Elaine says about the woman, with implied commentary about Jerry, that she is probably \\"one of those neurotic clean freaks\\". * In \\"The Chinese Woman\\", Jerry almost gets into a state of panic when he finds out that Kramer is not wearing any underwear. * In \\"The Limo\\", Elaine corrects someone who has misidentified Jerry as a Nazi, explaining that \\"he's just neat.\\" * In \\"The Implant\\", a girlfriend of his comments that \\"he would have made a great Nazi\\" because \\"everything has to be just so\\". Reception In 2007, Entertainment Weekly placed the Jerry Seinfeld character eighth on their list of the \\"50 Greatest TV icons\\". For his portrayal, Jerry Seinfeld was nominated four times for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Television Series ‚Äì Musical or Comedy, out of which he won one, along with being nominated five times for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series, for which he never won.

There are more than ten summits above 2000 m (Ploƒçno 2228 m, Veliki Jelinak 2179 m, Veliki Vilinac 2118 m, etc.), vertical cliffs (Pesti brdo, Mezica stijene, Strmenica ...). It also includes lakes of Blidinje, Crepulja and Crvenjak. The Diva Grabovica canyon (6.2 km) goes into the mountain. Bio-life is characteristic of its three climate areas: conifers above 1200 m, plateau with grass and junipers; numerous endemic species (like Munika Pine). ƒåvrsnica is well known as a home of chamois. Climate The mountain exhibits three types of climate: Mediterranean at the base of the mountain, central European on hillsides and alpine on summits and plateaus. Six months have average temperatures below zero degrees Celsius. January and February have 15-23 days of snow precipitation. Snow layer thickness can be 2.5-3 m. Strong wind can make snowdrifts even 15 m thick. The upper plateau is under the snow from November until April -- in hidden parts snow remains whole year. = Trivia = Hajduƒçka Republika Mijata Tomiƒáa, a self-proclaimed micronation, the parodical project, is located between this mountain and the mountain Vran.

The film stars Lionel Atwill, Fay Wray, Glenda Farrell, and Frank McHugh. This film, along with Warner's Doctor X, were the last dramatic fiction films made using the two-color Technicolor process.\\"Notes\\" TCM.com Plot Ivan Igor (Lionel Atwill) is a sculptor who operates a wax museum in 1921 London. He gives a private tour to a friend, Dr. Rasmussen (Holmes Herbert) and an investor, Mr. Galatalin (Claude King) showing them sculptures of Joan of Arc, Voltaire, and his favorite, Marie Antoinette. Formerly a stone sculptor who did wax modeling as a hobby, he explains he turned to wax sculpting completely because he felt more \\"satisfied\\" that he could reproduce \\"the warmth, flesh, and blood of life far better in wax than in cold stone\\". Mr. Galatalin, impressed by his sculptures, offers to submit Igor's work to the Royal Academy after he returns from a trip to Egypt. Unfortunately business at the museum is failing due to people's attraction to the macabre (a nearby wax museum caters to that). Igor's partner Joe Worth (Edwin Maxwell) proposes to burn the museum down for the insurance money of ¬£10,000. Igor will not allow such a travesty, but Worth starts a fire anyway. Igor tries to stop him and he and Worth get into a fight. As they fight, wax masterworks are melting in the flames. Worth knocks Igor unconscious, leaving the sculptor to die in the fire. Igor survives, however, and reemerges in 1933, 12 years later, in New York City, reopening a new wax museum. His hands and legs have been badly crippled in the fire and he must rely on assistants to create his new sculptures. Meanwhile, spunky reporter Florence Dempsey (Glenda Farrell), on the verge of being fired for not bringing in any worthwhile news, is sent out by her impatient editor, Jim (Frank McHugh), to investigate the suicide of a model named Joan Gale (Monica Bannister). During this time, a hideous monster steals the body of Joan Gale from the morgue. When investigators find that her body has been stolen, they suspect murder. The finger initially points to George Winton (Gavin Gordon), son of a powerful industrialist, but after visiting him in jail, Florence thinks differently. Florence's roommate is Charlotte Duncan (Fay Wray), whose fianc√©e Ralph (Allen Vincent) works at Igor's new wax museum. While visiting the museum, Florence notices an uncanny resemblance between a wax figure of Joan of Arc and the dead model. At the same time, Igor spots Charlotte and remarks on her resemblance to his sculpture of Marie Antoinette. Igor employs a couple of shady characters: Professor Darcy (Arthur Edmund Carewe), a drug addict, and Hugo (Matthew Betz), a deaf-mute. Darcy also works for Joe Worth, now a bootlegger (among his customers is none other than Winton). While investigating an old tenement where Worth keeps his contraband, Florence discovers a monster connected with the museum, but cannot prove any connection with the disappearance of Joan Gale's body. Darcy is seen running from the house and is caught by the police. When brought to the station, he eventually breaks down and admits that Igor is, in fact, the killer and that he has been murdering people (including a missing judge whose watch was found on Darcy's person), stealing their bodies, and dipping them in wax to create lifelike sculptures. Charlotte, visiting Ralph at the museum, is trapped there by Igor, who it is revealed can still walk. When Charlotte tries to get away, she pounds away at his face, breaking a wax mask that he has made of himself, to reveal that he had been horribly disfigured. He also shows her the dead body of Joe Worth, whom Darcy had been tracking down for some time. When she faints, he straps her onto a table, intending to douse her with molten wax and make her his lost Marie Antoinette sculpture. Florence leads the police to the museum just in time: for a man supposedly crippled by fire, Igor moves with surprising speed and agility, successfully fighting off the police, but is finally gunned down. He falls into the giant vat of molten wax which was intended for Charlotte. Charlotte is saved when Ralph moves away from the table she is strapped to from where the wax is about to pour onto her. When Florence reports her story to her editor, Jim, he proposes to her. Having to choose between money (Winton) and happiness (Jim), she picks the latter.

Belden, who had also written a play called The Wax Museum, which had been optioned by Charles Rogers, an independent producer. This had been discovered by Warner's copyright attorney, but the studio optioned the story from Belden for $1,000 before getting the attorney's report. Rogers dropped his option on the play when threatened with a lawsuit from the co-author of a Broadway play with a similar plot. A follow-up to Warner's earlier horror film Doctor X (1932), Mystery involved many of the same cast and crew, including actors Lionel Atwill, Fay Wray, Arthur Edmund Carewe and Thomas Jackson; director Michael Curtiz; art director Anton Grot; and cameraman Ray Rennahan.Steffen, James. \\"Mystery of the Wax Museum (1933)\\" TCM.com The film also re-used Doctor Xs opening theme music by Bernhard Kaun. Mystery of the Wax Museum was the last feature film under a 1931 Technicolor contract. Warner had already noted the public's apathy with the more artificial color system. Technicolor was greeted with hostility by critics and public awash in its unreal hues and humdrum quality control since 1929. The considerable additional expense of the compromised two-color spectrum, which was a fine idea when color was a novelty, was now anathema. Warners had tried without success to get Technicolor to permit them to swap out the last feature commitment for a series of shorts, but when the studio violated the contract by filming Doctor X with an additional black-and-white unit - thereby permitting them to process prints at their own lab and avoid paying Technicolor thousands of dollars - Technicolor dug in their heels and refused. Consequently, Mystery of the Wax Museum was the last studio feature using the two-color Technicolor. Technicolor founder Herbert Kalmus declared it \\"the ultimate that is possible with two components.\\" The combination of the two-color process with the lighting of Rennahan and the set designs of Grot, greatly improved quality control in printing, and an unreal atmosphere worked well for the film's story. The process may have outgrown its welcome, but it ended on a high note; contemporary exhibitor reviews in The Film Daily document that the color was greatly admired by both theatre owners and their audiences, often citing it as \\"beautiful\\" or \\"the best color I have ever seen\\". The process had combined separation photography printed with red and green dyes to create a color image with a reduced spectrum. When the three-color process became available Warner Bros. was the first to use it for live-action shorts like Service With a Smile. The extremely bright light required for filming under the Technicolor process melted the wax figures, though many characters (Queen Victoria, Disraeli, Joan of Arc) were portrayed by actors. About half of the figures are portrayed by actors. This was the plan from the start, and may have been as much out of a desire to add life-like verisimilitude to the exhibits as to protect wax mannequins from the heat. Reception Upon its release, Time magazine felt it was a good mystery film but was disappointed with the abrupt ending and lack of an explaining-it-all scene.\\"Cinema: The New Pictures: Feb. 27, 1933\\" ‚Äì Time However Mordaunt Hall of The New York Times wrote: \\"It is all very well in its way to have a mad scientist performing operations in well- told stories, but when a melodrama depends upon the glimpses of covered bodies in a morgue and the stealing of some of them by an insane modeler in wax, it is going too far.\\" Hall found it \\"too ghastly for comfort\\" - although he praised the comic performances of Glenda Farrell and Frank McHugh. The Variety reviewer said that the story was \\"loose and unconvincing\\" but liked the gruesome makeup and said that the film should do well at neighborhood cinemas. Box Office At the box office, the film did better in Europe than it did in the US, but still made a profit of $80,000. According to Warner Bros the film earned $325,000 domestically and $781,000 foreign.It was Warner's fifth top grosser of the year. Preservation Mystery of the Wax Museum was never reissued domestically, however, it was reissued in Franco's Spain in 1940. Over time it came to be considered a lost film. In 1936, Technicolor-Hollywood ceased servicing two-color printing and is said to have issued a \\"last call\\" to their customers for prints as the final imbibition rigs were converted for three-color; records show scattered print runs of some two-color subjects after that date. But the response of most studios was to junk the two-color negatives (which had been stored at Technicolor) of their now-obsolete films. A precious few negatives survived, including the Eddie Cantor musical Whoopee!, which was taken in by Goldwyn in their vaults. Correspondence indicates that in 1940 Goldwyn wanted to make two-color prints for Spain, and Technicolor was still able to service them. Warner Bros. kept the negatives for their two-color cartoons but not their live-action product. By the late 1950s, when the Warner library was being sold in a package for television to Associated Artists Productions, 1957 MOVIES FROM AAP Warner Bros Features & Cartoons SALES BOOK DIRECTED AT TV Mystery of the Wax Museum was deemed lost. The title remained on the sales list, but the negative vaults held no preprint to service it. William K. Everson reported that Warner's London exchange kept a 35 mm color print on hand and he saw the film there in 1947 in free screenings to celebrate the 20th Anniversary of Sound. He reports that the print subsequently began to decay and was destroyed. A 35 mm nitrate copy of Reel 1, the \\"lab reference\\" reel (Reel 1 with the fire sequence), was still held by Technicolor-Hollywood in the 1960s and screened by historian Rudy Behlmer; today, that reel is not in the Technicolor Collection of the Academy Film Archive and is presumed to have decomposed decades ago. In early 1970 the Warner Bros. studio reference print was found in former studio head Jack Warner's personal collection, as reported by Daily Variety on June 17th. The AFI made a new negative, rather unsuccessfully (cameraman Ray Rennahan told historian Richard Koszarski that it looked so dismal that he walked out of the screening room). United Artists made their own low-contrast negative for TV prints, losing virtually all of the color. The nitrate print screened at Graumann's Chinese Theatre in the early summer, then again at Alice Tully Hall in the 8th New York Film Festival on September 26, 1970, at 4:00 pm, as part of a retrospective, Medium Rare 1927-1933, of films not seen since their first release. It was released in UA's Prime Time Showcase television package in August 1972, first broadcast on the BBC in London before playing sixteen domestic TV markets. In Washington D.C. Mystery of the Wax Museum played on WTOP's Saturday night classic film series \\"Cinema Club 9\\" in late 1972. In New York City, it had its first airing in 1973 on WPIX-TV in a Sunday morning slot, cut by 15 minutes for commercials. Later it became a staple on the station's Saturday night Chiller Theater. In 1988 the new owner, Turner Entertainment, made yet another negative, this one more faithful to the color but hagridden with damage, splices, and missing footage. The Jack Warner nitrate print resides at UCLA, who also hold a French workprint in the PHI collection. The workprint, uncovered by a Los Angeles collector in the early 2000s, has indifferent, pallid plus-green color, French subtitles, an English track, with some reels mute. In 2019 the Film Foundation sponsored a digital 4K restoration by the UCLA Film & Television Archive with funding from the George Lucas Family Foundation. The Warner print, with superior color but still exhibiting pickups at reel ends culled from different prints, was the primary resource. Made from different matrixes, the French workprint was less pleasing but yielded shots and ends of reels that were tattered, broken or missing in the main print, along with some lost lines of audio. Other missing audio needed to be picked up from other Warner movies, including a line of Glenda Farrell's that was pulled in from Life Begins (1932). Following Rennahan's directives in his oral histories as to how he lit for two-color and what palette he aimed to achieve, the new restoration revealed subtle degrees of color that were latent in the nitrate print but obscured by cross- contamination of the color dyes. Home media A mediocre color version of the film, woefully manipulated to look blue/pink, was released as an extra in standard definition on the Warner Bros DVD and Blu-ray for House of Wax. Warner Archive Collection released the film in 1080p HD as a stand-alone Blu- ray on May 12, 2020, utilizing a Rec. 709 submaster of the UCLA restoration. With correct color, restored sound and digital correction of picture wear and tear, the Blu-ray garnered universally rave reviews with many commenters noting that it was as if seeing the film for the first time. The Blu-ray contains two audio commentaries, one by Curtiz biographer Alan Rode, the other by UCLA preservationist Scott MacQueen. MacQueen's commentary shares excerpts from interviews he conducted with Fay Wray and Glenda Farrell. In addition to the Blu-ray release, the restoration was performed at 4K and theatrical DCPs are available for archival and theatrical screening. Remakes The film was remade as House of Wax (1953), starring Vincent Price and directed by Andre De Toth. Whereas the original was more of a mystery film and set in a contemporary New York City, the remake focused more on the horror elements and took the story back to a gaslight, turn-of-the-century setting. However, both films did have one unusual tendency in common: they were vehicles for gimmicks. Mystery was filmed in the early two-color Technicolor process, and House of Wax showcased two other then-novel film technologies, 3-D and stereophonic sound. An unsold TV pilot officially based on the earlier films Chamber of Horrors (1966), was salvaged as a theatrical feature release and offered its own gimmick, a \\"horror horn\\" that would blare as the image flashed red prior to scenes of violence and murder. The horror film House of Wax (2005) was also credited as being based on the 1953 film and the same original play, though it owes nothing but a shared title with the Vincent Price movie.

It is best known for its sole hit song, \\"A Question of Temperature,\\" which made the Billboard charts in February 1968, peaking in the top 40. Two members of the band, Don Henny and Ed Schnug first played together in a band called Adam, which made one single for the Mala label entitled \\"Eve\\" in 1966. Adam's gimmick was that all four members of the group adopted the first name \\"Adam\\". They were probably not the first to use this idea, but they were far from the last; a similar ruse would be used by other bands, including The Donnas. After Adam disbanded, Henny and Schnug were joined by Mike Appel and Jay Saks and adopted the name \\"The Balloon Farm\\". The band's first single was \\"A Question of Temperature\\", which was released in October 1967. First pressings of the 45 rpm single contained a typographical error that rendered the title as \\"A Question of Tempature\\". Another typo, which was never fixed, was the name of the song's producer, Peter Schekeryk, which was spelled \\"Shekeryk\\", even after the title of the song was fixed. The single reached a peak of #37 on the Billboard Hot 100, and in the years since has become something of a garage-psych classic. It has appeared on numerous thematic compilations, including the Rhino box set Nuggets and Acid Dreams. The follow-up single \\"Hurry Up Sundown\\" flopped, and the Balloon Farm was dropped by Laurie before it was able to record an entire album. However, one of the band's unreleased songs, \\"Sunshine Rides on a Trolley\\" (also known as \\"Sunshine Rides on a Trolley Car\\"), was recorded in Australia by Robbie Snowden, who had a moderate hit with it in 1967. Later in 1968, the Balloon Farm resurfaced with yet another new name, Huck Finn, and one single on the Kapp label, \\"Two of a Kind\\". After that, the band broke up. Three people involved with the hit \\"A Question of Temperature\\" gained greater fame in the 1970s. Schekeryk would become Melanie's manager and husband. Arranger, Charlie Morrow would become internationally known for jingles including Hefty Wimpy, large scale art events like TootN Blink and New Wilderness International Solstice celebrations and, in the new millennium, the invention of MorrowSound True3D 3D audio effect. Appel, after cowriting \\"Doesn't Somebody Want to Be Wanted\\" and several LP cuts for The Partridge Family, would become the first manager of Bruce Springsteen. Notable covers \\"A Question of Temperature\\" was recorded by Brownsville Station on its 1973 album Yeah!, the same LP on which \\"Smokin' in the Boy's Room\\" appears. It was recorded in 1974 by TNT, a Harrisburg PA area garage band led by Erik Lindgren, and appears on their CD \\"Mod Psych Power Pop from Central PA.\\" It was recorded by several artists in the 1980s, including The Lords of the New Church on their debut album, Mindflux, Human Sexual Response, Julian Cope as a B-side to \\"Charlotte Anne\\" in 1988, and the Vancouver-based punk band The Young Canadians.

Released in 2003, it marks a departure for the band, with stronger socially and politically lyrics than the duo's previous albums, as well as showcasing the duo exploring a larger musical palette. Some of the album's lyrics concern rural issues which Knightley had taken to heart in previous years, including in the aftermath of their previous lyrical album Cold Frontier (2001). Prior to the release of Country Life, the duo had released an instrumental album named The Path. Both The Path and Country Life were released close together. The album was packaged in a lavish set which included a bonus disc of demo versions and other bonus material. The album's title track was also promoted by the band's first music video. The album received a positive reception, with praise greeting the album from the likes of Tom Jewsbury of the BBC,BBC - Radio 2 - Folk and Acoustic Iain Hazlewood of Spiral Earth, and Jane Brace of The Living Tradition.Show Of Hands - Country Life CD review - The Living Tradition Magazine The album ranked at number 22 in the \\"Devon's Top 50 Albums\\" poll organised by BBC Radio Devon in April 2004 to find the all-time favourite albums of Devonians.The Turntable ¬ª Oh My The duo toured in support of the album from 2003‚Äì2005. Background and recording After completing and releasing their eighth studio album Cold Frontier (2001), Show of Hands embarked on a nationwide tour in which they played a great deal of unreleased or \\"rare\\" material. The band's live album Cold Cuts (2002) was drawn from material from the tour. The tour coincided with the start of writing material for the album. Both the recording of Cold Frontier and the subsequent tour were in an era of several social and political concerns for Knightley, culminating in the more \\"heavy\\" lyrics that landed on the album. With a focus on rural issues, Steve Knightley of the duo named the album Country Life. The duo had been commissioned by the National Trust and English Heritage to record an instrumental album to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the South West Coast Path. The resulting album, The Path (2003), was quickly recorded as the duo were preparing for their next canonical album. As such, the duo entered a busy in period in which they were working on two albums. The Path was released on 14 April 2003,History  Show of Hands by which point Country Life had been recorded at Riverside Studios in Exeter in the early part of 2003. The album was co-produced between Mick Dolan and the duo. Music and composition The album's title song is about the desecration of British country life. At the time of release, Jane Brace of Living Tradition described Country Life as the duo's \\"most ambitious, exciting and keenly awaited project to date\\". Iain Hazlewood of Spiral Earth noted \\"the diversity of musical style, mood and pace on the album is always held in control; as an album it is totally cohesive - nothing unbalances it,\\" and noted the album incorporates elements of Celtic, Spanish, South American, rock and blues, but also that despite this, \\"they don't fall into the trap of creating 'world' music that isn't rooted to any real place or time. Their place is the West Country and South West of England, their time is anytime they damn well like.\\" Tom Jewsbury of the BBC said the duo \\"steer ever closer to the mainstream market with this latest studio album. All the usual SOH ingredients are present: soulful vocals, accomplished instrumentation, excellent production, original compositions featuring politically-charged lyrics, the occasional nod to the tradition.\\" The album contains ten songs written by Steve Knightley, as well as the duo's arrangements of two traditional folk songs and Kelly Joe Phelps's \\"Tommy\\", the latter being a \\"raw tale of schizophrenia\\" about \\"a misfit\\" and featuring Phil Beer's \\"unusual voice\\". The title track and album opener, \\"Country Life\\", is a \\"stirring\\" and \\"finely honed rant about the desecration of British country life\\" and \\"an acerbic indictment of modern values\\". Inspired by the 2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth outbreak, it became something of a break-though recording for the band that has brought their work to a wider audience. The song examines rural poverty and social exclusion from the experiences of an extended family, and was partly born from Knightley's frustration that English rural areas lacked a meaningful musical voice. Steve Knightley had commented that ‚Äúcities in England have got their voices ‚Ä¶ The only countryside music bordered on a joke, like the Wurzels.\\" Nonetheless, Knightley does not claim to speak for rural people or to be presenting an \\"authentic‚Äü rural voice, with the story told by the particular character of an angry young man. \\"Reynardine\\" features Knightley's finger percussion on a cuatro. The album's mood changes quickly on the second track, \\"Hard Shoulder\\", a song about a long-standing friendship. The song was described as \\"soaked through with the poignancy of hindsight and memory.\\"NetRhythms: A to Z Album and Gig reviews \\"Hard Shoulder\\" is followed by \\"Suntrap\\", featuring Spanish guitar playing from Beer, and the poignant and gentle \\"Smile She Said\\", which tells of the journey of a relationship in five \\"exposures\\". Following this is the traditional song \\"Reynardine\\" which music written by Knightley. The song also features Knightley's hallmark finger drumming, this time on the cuatro, which he was taught by exiled Chilean musician Vladamir Vega during their time in Alianza in 1991. The track an unusual pulsating treatment. Knightley's singing on the ballad \\"Seven Days\\" is accompanied by young West Country singer Jenna Witts, with whom Knightley and Seth Lakeman recorded the album Western Approaches with the following year. Following the aforementioned cover of \\"Tommy\\" are the \\"jaunty\\" song \\"Be Lucky\\", the traditional folk song \\"Adieu Sweet Lovely Nancy\\" which again features Beer on vocals, and had originally been recorded by the duo with Alianza in 1991, and the \\"gentle\\" song \\"I Promise You\\". Before the album closer \\"Don't Be a Stranger\\", which was a former concert closer for the duo, is the upbeat \\"Red Diesel\\", about Terry, \\"the kind of guy that modern society doesn't really have much time for\\". The track features Knightley's mandocello and Beer's mandolin forming a \\"foot tapping\\" rhythm. Terry is a minor criminal who complains that \\"there ought to be a law for keeping out the yuppies and the grockles\\". Release and reception Country Life was commercially released 20 October 2003 on the band's own label Hands on Music with the catalogue number HMCD19, but had already been sold at the duo's concerts since the middle of the year. The album was released as a double disc set, with the album on the first disc (subtitled The Album), and a bonus disc entitled The Demos, which contained demo versions of the album's songs \\"Country Life\\", \\"Hard Shoulder\\" and \\"I Promise You\\". The bonus disc also contained other CD- ROM bonus material, namely the music videos for \\"Country Life\\" and their older song \\"The Train\\", a photo slideshow set to \\"I Promise You\\", a lyrics section set to \\"The Exe Estuary\\" from their previous album The Path, live footage from their 2001 performance at the Royal Albert Hall and a downloadable screensaver. The bonus disc prompted the BBC to say the album was \\"lavishly packaged\\". Although no singles were released from the album, the title track had a music video produced for it. Helped to be promoted by a tour in 2003, including a performance at the Trowbridge Village Pump Festival where copies of the album was signed, the album was released to a positive critical reception. Tom Jewsbury of the BBC said the album would \\"have SOH's mighty fan base in seventh heaven.\\" Iain Hazlewood of Spiral Earth said that \\"Country Life is one of their defining moments\\" and \\"a deceptively complex album, repeated listening reveals a musical and emotional depth that just picks you up and runs off with your imagination. Jane Brace of The Living Tradition said she had \\"racked [her] brains for a way to describe this band and failed. And therein lies the 'riddle' of Show of Hands. Just when you think you've got a handle on them and decided it's 'acoustic with attitude' or out and out English folk they'll throw in some rock, shades of country, a reel of Celtic, a bit of bluegrass and then recreate the sitar sounds of India in the blink of an eye. They are without a doubt the coolest chameleons I've seen. and the release of Country Life proves they just get better and better. David Kidman of NetRhythms said the album is \\"another excellent product all round. Probably Show Of Hands' best\\".

As with various other laudatory titles of Semitic origin, such as \\"King of Kings\\", Sultan of Sultans can express a claim of imperial rank up to and including universal legitimate sovereignty. Although the notion and title of an emperor is largely alien to Islamic tradition, the Ottoman dynasty, which employed the title of \\"Sultan of Sultans\\" in its official full style, had perhaps the best claim to usage due to its territorial extent and great length. The Ottomans also adopted the traditional Byzantine imperial title Caesar for their own ruler (the Padishah). The Sultans of Delhi Sultanate used this title to signify their rule over entire Indian subcontinent as hundred of Indian Rajas (Prince) ruled under their suzerainty. But they also considered themselves beneath the Caliph however they were independent. The title has also been appropriated for local use by various regional Muslim rulers, especially in Bengal Sultanate. The Shahanshah (Persian for \\"King of Kings\\") of Iran also claimed, with slightly less legitimacy, to be the \\"Sultan of Sultans\\".

Throughout history, the Ishmaelites have been associated with Arabs (more specifically, North Arabians). Indeed, two prominent North Arabian tribes, the Qedarites and Nabateans, have names corresponding to two of Ishmael's sons. The original sequence of events, who called whom which name first and how this relates to the tradition of Abraham as a patriarch and forefather is unclear. Even today, many call upon Ishmael as their people's ancestor, notably Muslim Arabs. Traditional origins = Hebrew Bible = According to the Book of Genesis, Abraham's first wife was named Sarah and her Egyptian slave was named Hagar. However Sarah could not conceive. In chapter 16 Sarah (then Sarai) gave her slave Hagar in marriage to Abraham, in order that Abraham might have an heir. Hagar conceived Ishmael from Abraham, and the Ishmaelites descend from him. After Abraham pleaded with God for Ishmael to live under his blessing, chapter 17 states: Chapter 25 lists his sons as: = Samaritan Asa·π≠ƒ´r = The Samaritan book Asa·π≠ƒ´r adds: = Josephus' Antiquities = Josephus also lists the sons and states that they \\"...inhabit the lands which are between Euphrates and the Red Sea, the name of which country is Nabath√¶a.)\\" = Targum Onkelos = The Targum Onkelos annotates Genesis 25:16, describing the extent of their settlements: \\"And they dwelt from Hindekaia unto Chalutsa, which is by the side of Mizraim, from thy going up towards Arthur.\\" = Quran = \\"Allah has gifted all of Ishmael, Elisha, Jonah and Lot a favour above the nations. With some of their forefathers and their offspring and their brethren; and We chose them and guided them unto a straight path\\". = Kebra Nagast = The 14th century Kebra Nagast says \\"And therefore the children of Ishmael became kings over Tereb, and over Kebet, and over N√¥b√¢, and S√¥ba, and Kuergue, and K√Æf√Æ, and M√¢k√¢, and M√¥rn√¢, and F√Æn·∏≥√¢n√¢, and ‚ÄôArs√Æb√¢n√¢, and L√Æb√¢, and Mase'a, for they were the seed of Shem.\\" Historical records of the Ishmaelites Assyrian and Babylonian royal inscriptions and North Arabian inscriptions from 9th to 6th century BC, mention the king of Qedar. Of the names of the sons of Ishmael the names \\"Nabat, Kedar, Abdeel, Dumah, Massa, and Teman\\" were mentioned in the Assyrian royal inscriptions as Arabian tribes. Jesur was mentioned in Greek inscriptions in the First Century BC. The Qedarite Kingdom continued long after the demise of the last native Babylonian king Nabonidus, but the Nabataean Kingdom emerged from the Qedarite kingdom because of the continuity in geography and language between the two tribes some two hundred and fifty years later. Many Arabic tribes names of the time of Muhammad (and now) such as Asad, Madhhij, and the ancestor tribes of Muhammad: Ma'ad and Nizar were found in the Namara inscription dated 325 AD in the Nabatean script. Genealogical trace of the ancestry of Arabs  Medieval Arab genealogists divided Arabs into three groups: * \\"Ancient Arabs\\", tribes that had vanished or been destroyed, such as  øƒÄd and Thamud, often mentioned in the Qur'an as examples of God's power to destroy those who did not believe and follow their prophets and messengers. * \\"Pure Arabs\\" of South Arabia, descending from Qahtan son of Hud. Some of the Qahtanites (Qahtanis) are said to have migrated from the land of Yemen following the destruction of the Ma'rib Dam (sadd Ma'rib). * The \\"Arabized Arabs\\" (musta\`ribah) of center and North Arabia, descending from Ishmael the elder son of Abraham through his descendant Adnan. Such as the ancient tribe of Hawazin, or the modern-day tribes of Otaibah and Anazzah. Abu Ja'far al-Baqir (676‚Äì743 AD) wrote that his father Ali ibn Husayn informed him that prophet Muhammad had said: \\"The first whose tongue spoke in clear Arabic was Ishmael, when he was fourteen years old.\\"Wheeler, 2002, p. 110-111. Hisham Ibn Muhammad al-Kalbi (737‚Äì819 AD) established a genealogical link between Ishmael and Muhammad using writings and the ancient oral traditions of the Arabs. His book, Jamharat al-Nasab (\\"The Abundance of Kinship\\"), seems to posit that the people known as 'Arabs' (of his time) were all descendants of Ishmael. Ibn Kathir (1301‚Äì1373) writes, \\"All the Arabs of the Hijaz are descendants of Nebaioth and Qedar.\\" Medieval Jewish sources also usually identified Qedar with Arabs and Muslims.Alexander, 1847, p. 67.Alfonso, 2007, p. 137, note 36. According to author and scholar Irfan Shah√Æd, while Western scholars viewed this kind of \\"genealogical Ishmaelism\\" with suspicion, the concept can be supported, > Genealogical Ishmaelism was viewed with suspicion as a late Islamic > fabrication because of the confusion in Islamic times which made it such a > capacious term as to include the inhabitants of the south as well as the > north of the Arabian Peninsula. But short of this extravagance, the concept > is much more modest in its denotation, and in the sober sources it applies > only to certain groups among the Arabs of pre-Islamic times. Some important > statements to this effect were made by Muhammad when he identified some > Arabs as Ishmaelites and others as not.Shah√Æd, 1989, p. 335-336. Ishmaelism in this more limited definition holds that Ishmael was both an important religious figure and eponymous ancestor for some of the Arabs of western Arabia. Prominence is given in Arab genealogical accounts to the first two of Ishmael's twelve sons, Nebaioth (, Nabƒ´t) and Qedar (, QaydƒÅr), who are also prominently featured in the Genesis account. It is likely that they and their tribes lived in northwestern Arabia and were historically the most important of the twelve Ishmaelite tribes. It is believed that the first person to speak Arabic clearly was Ishmael from Greek literature sources: \\"Isma‚Äôil grew up among the Jurhum an Arabic speaking tribe, learning the pure Arabic tongue from them. When grown up he successively married two ladies from the Jurhum tribe, the second wife being the daughter of Mudad ibn ‚ÄòAmr, leader of the Jurhum tribe.\\" In accounts tracing the ancestry of Muhammad back to Ma'ad (and from there to Adam), Arab scholars alternate, with some citing the line as through Nebaioth, others Qedar.al-Mousawi in Boudreau et al., 1998, p. 219. Many Muslim scholars see Isaiah 42 (21:13-17) as predicting the coming of a servant of God who is associated with Qedar and interpret this as a reference to Muhammad.Zepp, Ira G.

Lawrence \\"Larry\\" Semon (February 9, 1889World War I Draft Registration Card at ancestry.com : \\"Lawrence Semon, born Feb 9 1889 West Point, Mississippi, Motion Picture Director for Vitagraph Co, living in Brooklyn, New York, signed Lawrence Semon on 5 Jun 1917\\" ‚Äì October 8, 1928) was an American actor, director, producer, and screenwriter during the silent film era. In his day, Semon was considered a major movie comedian, but he is now remembered mainly for working with both Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy before they started working together. He is also sometimes noted for directing (as well as appearing in) the 1925 silent film The Wizard of Oz, which had a slight influence on the better-known 1939 talkie The Wizard of Oz released by MGM. The film was included in the 2005 three-disc DVD version of the 1939 film, along with other silent Oz movies. Early life Born in West Point, Mississippi, Semon was the son of a travelling Jewish vaudeville magician Zera Semon, who billed himself as \\"Zera the Great\\". His mother, Irene Semon (n√©e Rea) worked as his assistant. Along with his older sister, Semon joined his parents' act until his father's death. After completing his education in Savannah, Georgia, Semon moved to New York City, where he worked for The New York Sun and later The New York Morning Telegraph as a cartoonist, comics artist and graphic artist.https://www.lambiek.net/artists/s/semon_larry.htm While working as an artist, Semon appeared in monologues in vaudeville, where he attracted the attention of Vitagraph Studios. In 1915, he was offered a contract with the company. Career After signing with Vitagraph, Semon worked behind the scenes as a scenario writer, director, and film producer for actor Hughie Mack's films. He occasionally cast himself in bit parts in the films he worked on. When Mack left Vitagraph, Semon began playing the lead roles. He usually played a white-faced goof in derby hat and overalls who would enter any given setting (a bakery, a restaurant, a construction site, a prison camp, etc.) and cause chaos, with people being covered with debris and property being destroyed. His short slapstick comedies were made and released quickly and prolifically, making Semon very familiar to moviegoers. As his fame grew, his films expanded from one reel (about 12 minutes) to two reels, and Semon was given a free hand in making them. This became a dangerous policy because Semon became notorious for being expensive and extravagant: his two-reel comedies could easily cost more than an average five-reel feature film. As a former cartoonist, Semon staged similarly cartoony sight gags, using elaborate special effects. No gag was too big for Semon. He loved chase sequences involving airplanes (sometimes using three in a film), exploding barns, falling water towers, auto wrecks and/or explosions, and liberal use of substances in which to douse people. A typical Semon comedy might involve barrels of flour, sacks of soot, gallons of ink, gobs of jam, or pits filled with mud. For example, in Semon's The Bell Hop, a man sleeping under the spray of a malfunctioning fountain imagines he is swimming in the ocean, and in his sleep he dives off the bed, through the floor, and into a vat of paint in the lobby below. Oliver Hardy recalled in an interview that Semon, when staging his comedy short The Sawmill in a lumber camp, would not use traditional, painted stage sets. Instead, Semon insisted on building permanent log cabins complete with modern conveniences. The production budget soared, and his bosses at Vitagraph finally demanded that Semon become his own producer and underwrite his productions personally. Semon tried to reverse his money problems by entering the more lucrative field of feature films. He produced and starred in a few features in the mid-1920s, including the financial disaster The Wizard of Oz in 1925;\\"Larry Semon\\", obituary, Variety, October 10, 1928, p. 57, col. 1. Internet Archive. Retrieved November 28, 2018. but by 1927 he was back in short subjects released through Educational Pictures. After filing for bankruptcy in March 1928, Semon returned to vaudeville. While traveling on the vaudeville circuit, he suffered a nervous breakdown and went back to Los Angeles. Death After returning to Los Angeles, Semon was admitted to a sanatorium in Victorville, California, where on October 8, 1928‚Äîat the age of 39‚Äîhe died of pneumonia and tuberculosis. His wife Dorothy Dwan was reported to be at his bedside when he died. In its obituary for Semon, the trade paper Variety speculated that ongoing stress related to his dire financial circumstances was a contributing factor in his demise, alluding to the 1925 production of The Wizard of Oz as the major cause of his money woes: Nicknames French audiences knew him as Zigoto, Italian ones as Ridolini, and Spanish ones as Jaimito (\\"Jimmy\\") in pre-war releases and Tomas√≠n (\\"Tommy\\") in the 1940 rereleases by Manuel Rotellar.Claudia Sassen quotes Juan Gabriel Tharrats.

The film featured Christopher Jones as the highly influential singer Max Frost. The songs performed by Frost and his band, a group that was never formally named in the film, were credited to Max Frost and the Troopers in the subsequent singles and album. The band name \\"Troopers\\" is based on the term \\"troops,\\" the designation Frost used in the film to refer to his friends and followers. A studio group appeared on the soundtrack album for the film, along with incidental music penned by Cynthia Weil and Barry Mann and composed by Les Baxter; however, the songs were not originally credited to Max Frost and the Troopers, but rather to The 13th Power. Owing to the success of the song \\"Shape of Things To Come\\" as a single, an accompanying album by Max Frost and The Troopers, Shape of Things to Come, was issued on the Tower record label in 1968. Musicians playing on the album are believed to include members of Davie Allan and The Arrows (who also released the \\"Shapes of Things to Come\\" without lyrics) with lead vocals by Paul Wibier (who also wrote a majority of the songs on the album). The music is high-energy rock with some psychedelic touches. The group was produced by Harley Hatcher and Eddie Beram for Mike Curb Productions. Their first single was recorded with Curb's Tower subsidiary Sidewalk Records. Subsequent singles were taken from their album. Their final single, \\"Sittin' in Circles,\\" was performed in the film Three in the Attic by Davie Allan and the Arrows. The B-side of that single, \\"Paxton Quigley's Had The Course,\\" was a Chad & Jeremy composition. The soundtrack album for the 1968 film The Glory Stompers, starring Dennis Hopper, contains two additional songs credited to Max Frost and the Troopers: \\"There's A Party Going On\\" (which was released as their first single) and \\"You Might Want Me Baby.\\" Later, \\"Wild In The Streets: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\\" was released, which included the singles from the original \\"Shape of Things to Come\\" LP and an additional four songs: \\"Wild in the Streets,\\" \\"Listen to Music,\\" \\"Love to Be Your Man,\\" and \\"Fourteen or Fight.\\" A European release of the Shape of Things to Come album, released in 2014 on the Captain High label, includes the entirety of the Wild in the Streets soundtrack album as bonus tracks.

It is located north of Masham and south of Bedale on the eastern slopes of the Ure Valley at the entrance to Wensleydale and the Yorkshire Dales National Park. It is 11 miles North of Ripon, 4 miles from the A1, 11 miles from the main railway line at Northallerton and 18 miles from Teesside Airport. Its population was 180 in 2000, 190 in 2005, 224 in 2011 and 240 in 2016. The village lies at the junction of Watlass Lane and Watlass Moor Lane. At the centre of the village is the triangular village green with its trees, cricket pitch and children's playground, surrounded by houses, some of which are built from local stone. Thornton Watlass Church dates from the 11th century and the village also has a primary school and a public house called the Buck Inn. The village forms part of the Thornton Watlass Estate, and Thornton Watlass Hall, an ancient two- storey gabled stone house, lies just to the north of the village. History Thornton Watlass Church A prehistoric feature in the Thornton Watlass area is Gospel Hill tumulus, a Scheduled Ancient Monument, at about 1 km northwest of the village. The site of the priory is now a scheduled ancient monument. Saxon remains of two cross-heads are evidence that people lived in the area before the Norman conquest in 1066. They are on display in Thornton Watlass Church. The Domesday book of 1086 mentions the separate villages of Thornton and Watlass. Before the Norman conquest the Saxon owners of these villages were Ulward and Stan; however, Thornton is shown in the Domesday book as being owned by Ribald, brother of Alan Earl of Richmond. Thornton Watlass Hall and estate has been owned by the Dodsworth family since 1415. The Anglican Church of St Mary the Virgin stands a little way outside the village to the southwest. It was rebuilt, with the exception of the tower, in 1868 in the Perpendicular style. The tower contains some living accommodation (including toilet) and was probably used as a place of safety in times of strife. The village school was built in 1872. Thornton Watlass today Today the village has about fifty houses and a few farms, with a population of 222 at the 2011 Census. The Church of England primary school is federated with Snape Community School and had 41 children on the roll in 2007 aged between 4 and 11 years, taught in two mixed-age classes. By 2016, the pupil numbers had dropped to 25. There is also provision for under-5s in the village hall. The village public house, restaurant and hotel, The Buck Inn overlooks the village green. Specialities include locally brewed real ale, Sunday lunchtime jazz, and a large room for conferences and functions. Just to the north of the village, Thornton Watlass Hall is a private home, but also provides hotel accommodation. The Hall has been featured over the years on several television dramas, including All Creatures Great and Small (BBC), Wuthering Heights (ITV) and Heartbeat (ITV) where it has featured as Ashfordly Hall and Websters Hotel for the past nine years.

It still carries the Capital Subdivision today and is the world's oldest multiple arched stone railroad bridge. The Capital Subdivision is a railroad line owned and operated by CSX Transportation in the U.S. state of Maryland and the District of Columbia. The line runs from near Baltimore, Maryland, southwest to Washington, D.C., along the former Baltimore and Ohio Rail Road (B&O;) Washington Branch.CSX Timetables: Capitol (sic) Subdivision The subdivision's Alexandria Extension provides a connection to Virginia and points south.http://wiki.radioreference.com/index.php/WS- Capital_Sub http://www.multimodalways.org/docs/railroads/companies/CSX/CSX%20ETTs/CSX%20Baltimore%20Div%20ETT%20%234%201-1-2005.pdf CSX Baltimore Division Timetable Route description =Main line= The northeast end of the line is at Halethorpe, Maryland, just north of the historic Thomas Viaduct, where it meets the Baltimore Terminal Subdivision and the Old Main Line Subdivision. Its southwest end is at the yard north of Union Station, at a junction with the Metropolitan Subdivision and Amtrak's Northeast Corridor. Between Elkridge and Laurel, the Capital Subdivision's rail alignment forms the border between Howard and Anne Arundel counties, having been built before Howard County was created from western Anne Arundel County in 1844. MARC Train's Camden Line, descended from B&O; commuter service between Baltimore and Washington, operates over the entire length of the main line. =Alexandria Extension= The Alexandria Extension runs south 7.2 miles (11.6 km) from a junction at Hyattsville, Maryland to the Anacostia Railroad Bridge and the RF&P; Subdivision in Southeast D.C. This busy route is used by freight trains to Virginia. It runs past Benning Yard and interchanges with the Landover Subdivision. History =Main line= The Thomas Viaduct about 20 years after its construction in 1835 In 1831 the Maryland General Assembly authorized the B&O; to build a branch from their main line within 8 miles (13 km) of Baltimore, to Washington.Chapter 158 of the 1830 Session Laws of Maryland, February 22, 1831. As this line would take much business from the parallel turnpikes, especially the Washington and Baltimore Turnpike, the charter specifically allowed those companies to subscribe to the stock of the railroad. Construction began in July 1833, and the line opened on August 25, 1835, splitting from the B&O; main line at Relay, roughly 7 miles (11 km) from Baltimore. Notable structural features on the original line include the Thomas Viaduct, the first multi-span masonry railroad bridge in the United States, and the largest bridge in the country when it was completed in 1835; and the earliest example of an iron truss bridge designed by Wendel Bollman and installed at Savage. Note: the present-day Bollman Truss Railroad Bridge, located on a railroad spur in Savage, was originally built for an unknown location on the Old Main Line, and relocated to Savage in 1877. =Washington depots= Union Station in Washington, D.C. The first B&O; passenger station (1835‚Äì1851) was located west of the Capitol, at 2nd Street and Pennsylvania Avenue NW. In 1851 the New Jersey Avenue Station was built at a point slightly north of the Capitol, on New Jersey Avenue NW, in the area now called Union Station Plaza. Trains reached that location via the current location of West Virginia Avenue, street-running trackage on I Street NE and Delaware Avenue, and private right-of-way just south of the current location of Louisiana Avenue. When the Washington Terminal Company opened the new Union Station in 1907, that alignment was changed to the current routing, partially using the former location of Delaware Avenue. =Alexandria Extension= The Alexandria Extension, originally called the Alexandria Branch, was built in 1874 and ran 12.5 miles (20.1 km) to Shepherds Landing along the eastern shore of the Potomac River, to provide a connection to Virginia. The B&O; had lost access to the Long Bridge across the river in 1870 due to political maneuvering by the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad (B&P;)(controlled by the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR)). In order to efficiently route its trains to points south of Washington, the B&O; set up a car float operation at Shepherds Landing, which carried freight cars across the river to Alexandria, Virginia. The ferry operation was discontinued in 1906 when the B&O; obtained trackage rights from PRR. The B&O; built a connecting track from the Alexandria Extension to the B&P;'s Anacostia Railroad Bridge, which provided access to PRR tracks in southwest D.C. (now called the CSX RF&P; Subdivision) and the Long Bridge. During World War II, the B&O; re-activated the Shepherds Landing crossing at the request of the U.S. Army. The Army had requested an additional Potomac River crossing for troop movements to supplement those on the Long Bridge, and the Corps of Engineers built a temporary bridge across the river in 1942. Both B&O; and PRR trains traveled over the 3,360 foot (1,020 m) bridge. Train operations on the bridge ceased in 1945 at the end of the war, and the bridge was demolished in 1947.National Railway Historical Society, Washington, D.C. Chapter. \\"Timeline of Washington, D.C. Railroad History.\\" Accessed 2010-08-21. For many years the junction at Hyattsville, called Alexandria Junction, was controlled by JD Tower. B&O; built its first interlocking tower building at the site in 1894, and rebuilt the tower in 1912 and again in 1917. CSX closed this tower in 1992, and demolished it in 1994 after a fire.JDTower.org . Accessed 2009-12-24. The original track from the junction at Anacostia Bridge to Shepherds Landing became known as the Shepherd Branch. This spur served several industries, including Bolling Air Force Base and the Blue Plains Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant. (Shown as \\"Shepherd Industrial Track\\" on the diagram.) The Blue Plains plant was the only customer on the branch when rail service ended in 2001. =Acquisition= The Chesapeake and Ohio Railway acquired control of the B&O; in 1962, and the B&O; and C&O; both became a subsidiaries of the Chessie System in 1973. In 1980 the Chessie System merged with the Seaboard System to form CSX Corporation. In 1987 the CSX Corporation merged the B&O; into the C&O;, then, later that same year, merged the C&O; into CSX Transportation (CSXT),http://trn.trains.com/railroads/railroad- history/2006/06/csx-merger-family-tree which now owns the line.

Biology and biogeochemistry Iron sulfides occur widely in nature in the form of iron‚Äìsulfur proteins. As organic matter decays under low-oxygen (or hypoxic) conditions such as in swamps or dead zones of lakes and oceans, sulfate-reducing bacteria reduce various sulfates present in the water, producing hydrogen sulfide. Some of the hydrogen sulfide will react with metal ions in the water or solid to produce iron or metal sulfides, which are not water-soluble. These metal sulfides, such as iron(II) sulfide, are often black or brown, leading to the color of sludge. Pyrrhotite is a waste product of the Desulfovibrio bacteria, a sulfate reducing bacteria. When eggs are cooked for a long time, the yolk's surface may turn green. This color change is due to iron(II) sulfide, which forms as iron from the yolk reacts with hydrogen sulfide released from the egg white by the heat. This reaction occurs more rapidly in older eggs as the whites are more alkaline. The presence of ferrous sulfide as a visible black precipitate in the growth medium peptone iron agar can be used to distinguish between microorganisms that produce the cysteine metabolizing enzyme cysteine desulfhydrase and those that do not. Peptone iron agar contains the amino acid cysteine and a chemical indicator, ferric citrate. The degradation of cysteine releases hydrogen sulfide gas that reacts with the ferric citrate to produce ferrous sulfide.

The class became the standard British shunting locomotive during the Second World War, and production continued until 1964 at various locomotive manufacturers. Background The 48150 class were built for the Guest Keen Baldwins Iron & Steel Company in 1937, being an enlarged version of a design dating from 1923. These developed into the 50550 class of 1941‚Äì42, with various modifications. At the outbreak of the Second World War, the War Department had initially chosen the LMS 'Jinty' 3F 0-6-0T as its standard shunting locomotive, but was persuaded by Hunslet that a simplified version of their more modern 50550 design would be more suitable. The first locomotive was completed at their Leeds works at the start of 1943. Construction Hunslet subcontracted some of the construction to Andrew Barclay Sons & Co., W. G. Bagnall, Hudswell Clarke, Robert Stephenson and Hawthorns and the Vulcan Foundry in order to meet delivery requirements. After D-Day they were used on Continental Europe and in North Africa as well as at docks and military sites in Britain. A total of 377 had been built for the War Department by 1947 (on orders placed during the war), with two further engines having been built for collieries (without the permission of the Ministry of Supply). When the end of the war reduced the need for locomotives, the military started to review its fleet: * 90 locomotives were kept by the military for use on their railways. * 75 locomotives were sold to the LNER and classified as J94. * 27 that had been loaned to Nederlandse Spoorwegen were sold to that company in 1947, becoming the NS 8800 class. * 11 were loaned to the Nederlandsche Staatsmijnen, who bought 9 of those. Others were sold for industrial use. A number of those used on the continent are believed to have worked on light and industrial railways in France, six going to the Chemins de Fer Tunisiens in 1946. One was used in Valentigney on the Peugeot industrial branch line. Post-war construction Austerity at Bickershaw Colliery, Greater Manchester As the final War Department locomotives were being delivered, the National Coal Board was placing orders for identical locomotives to be used at their collieries. Between 1948 and 1964, 77 new \\"Austerity\\" locomotives were built for the NCB. A further fourteen engines were ordered in 1952 by the British Army to supplement its 90 existing engines. The Yorkshire Engine Company also built eight locomotives to this design in 1954 for use in ironstone quarries and at Scunthorpe Steelworks. It has been suggested, although it has not been proven, that Hunslet sold some of the parts for the eight \\"Austerities\\" to the Yorkshire Engine Company as part of a subcontract settlement for the GWR 9400 Class 0-6-0PTs, ordered by the GWR from Hunslet and partially subcontracted to the Yorkshire Engine Company. Hunslet undertook the rebuilding of many NCB locomotives and when the Army started to sell off locomotives again in 1959, they bought 15 examples that were to be rebuilt and sold on. The NCB bought 13 of these, the 14th was sold directly into preservation and the final locomotive was scrapped without being rebuilt. Ultimately from first to last, a total of 485 examples were constructed between 1943 and 1964. The NCB continued to use Austerities in the 1970s and a small number remained in service until the early 1980s, notably at Bickershaw Colliery, Greater Manchester. Some of the examples that survived the longest were those fitted with mechanical stokers and Kylpor blast pipes or Giesl ejectors to improve their performance and reduce smoke. Preservation Hunslet 0-6-0ST Austerity WD75008 takes on water from the water tower at Peterborough Nene Valley on the Nene Valley Railway Barclay 0-6-0ST Austerity WPR No. 15 and her train are seen at Yarwell on the Nene Valley Railway 70 Austerities have been preserved on heritage railways, many in working order. Several have been painted as LNER Class J94s to represent mainline rather than industrial use. During the \\"Rocket 150\\" celebrations in 1979, NCB Bold Colliery \\"Austerity\\" No. 7 Robert also participated in the cavalcade of locomotives at Rainhill. Not all have survived intact; the boiler of RSH 7135 of 1944 was used on the replica broad gauge locomotive \\"Iron Duke\\" built at the National Railway Museum in 1985. A former Hunslet Austerity at the Watercress Line has been rebuilt from an 0-6-0ST into a 0-6-0T Thomas the Tank Engine lookalike, and another one into Douglas, also from The Railway Series. Models The Hunslet \\"Austerity\\" was produced as a model by Kitmaster from 1961 onwards in 00 gauge. The Kitmaster toolings were sold to Airfix in 1962 and later Dapol in 1981 when Airfix stopped production of model railway items; Dapol continued to use the Kitmaster toolings until they were destroyed by a fire at Dapol's Winsford headquarters in 1994. Dapol subsequently created a replacement moulding to allow production of these locomotives; this tooling was sold in 1996 to Hornby who have continued to produce the \\"Austerity\\" as both the J94 class and in various industrial liveries. Graham Farish and subsequently Bachmann have produced the \\"Austerity\\" as the LNER/BR J94 class for N gauge. DJmodels now produces J94 and austerity tanks in 00 gauge in a variety of liveries including BR as well as several industrial liveries.http://www.hornbymagazine.com/2016/08/02/hattons-receives-dj- austerity-tanks/  References   Bibliography     External links * Austerity Locomotive Owners Association Category:0-6-0ST locomotives Austerity Category:War Department locomotives Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1943 Category:Industrial locomotives of Great Britain ","title":"Hunslet Austerity 0-6-0ST"},{"id":"2091646","text":"Fabryczna is one of the five administrative boroughs (dzielnicas) of Wroc≈Çaw, Poland.

The New Inquisition is a book about ontology, science, paranormal events, and epistemology. Wilson identifies what he calls \\"Fundamentalist Materialism\\" belief and compares it to religious fundamentalism. Description In The New Inquisition Wilson criticizes the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal by claiming that scientists don't give a fair hearing to anyone they don't already agree with. Something else he criticizes is that the dependence on the military-industrial complex is the norm. He proclaims that instead of this dictatory attitude scientists should apply skepticism, or a kind of agnostic principle, when faced with new ideas. According to Wilson, science these days glorifies the \\"Idol of Materialism\\". He calls their belief \\"Fundamental Materialism\\" and likens it to religious fundamentalists. Wilson suggests a principle that \\"refuses total belief or total denial and regards models as tools to be used only and always where appropriate and replaced (by other models) only and always where not appropriate\\". It is intended to be deliberately shocking, Wilson states that he \\"does not want its ideas to seem any less startling than they are.\\" =Topics= The book's subtitle Irrational Rationalism and Citadel of Science, summarizes its topics; *;'Models, Metaphors and Idols' : comments on primate psychology and quantum mechanics *;'Skepticism and Blind Faith' : comments on book burning, biological surrealism and Game Rules *;'Two More Heretics and Some Further Blasphemies' : comments on werewolves and other things *;'The Dance of Shiva' : comments on Bell's theorem, Po and mysterious fires *;'Chaos and the Abyss' : comments on phantom kangaroos and other things *;'\\"Mind\\", \\"Matter\\" and Monism' : comments on coincidence *;'The Open Universe' : further comments on energy fluctuations and \\"spooks\\" *;'Creative Agnosticism' : further comments on the human brain, and how to use one =Summary= The New Inquisition is the author's term for what he refers to as a tendency within mainstream science to forbid certain forms of theories from being classed as \\"science.\\" He cites the cases of Wilhelm Reich, Rupert Sheldrake, and the Mars effect controversy, among others, in support of a central claim that a materialist bias within the scientific community has led to some speculations and theories he claimed were unjustly thought of as unscientific. The Citadel is the author's term for the military-industrial complex that he claims funds mainstream science and is the source of its bias. The book lists a large list of paranormal reports, (from the Fortean Times among others) with Wilson's tour of the history of modern physics. He is particularly interested in Bell's theorem, and Alain Aspect's experimental proof of Bell's theorem. Wilson opines that the implications of Aspect's proof include that magic is possible, and that \\"the sum total of all minds is one\\".Schr√∂dinger, chapter 23 He claims it is not a coincidence that the Darwinian model of evolution best suits the \\"reality tunnel\\" of the Citadel, and that biologists such as Sheldrake who have alternative theories of evolution are drummed out of mainstream science. On the topic, he states, Among the concepts covered is the idea of \\"absolute laws of physics\\" - he ends up saying that every \\"law\\" that has been investigated seemed to be subject to anomalous results from time to time, and that there may be some other parallel universe with absolute laws of physics that are always obeyed, but Wilson has not seen any sign of it around in this one. Wilson draws on a large number of accounts of recorded events said to be \\"paranormal\\" but dismissed by materialist science as mass hallucination, e.g. the visions in F√°tima, Portugal, and various UFO sightings. He comments that when it comes to 70,000 people having a mass hallucination, it's difficult to see how the explanation is any less occult than the events the explanation purports to explain. \\"You try it\\", he writes. \\"See if by any means you can induce a mass hallucination [...] try, saying, hey, take a look at that light over there brighter than the sun.\\" The book lists many phenomena that the author claims do not fit neatly into a materialist account of the world, and secondly, the book introduces various interpretations of quantum physics that may or may not provide a ground for explanation. The book concludes with the idea which he claims Schr√∂dinger supported, that the sum total of all minds is one, and that individual brains are best understood as local receivers, of an overall transmission which is always everywhere. The author repeatedly says \\"I am not asking you to believe any of this stuff, I'm just asking you to dispassionately observe your own reaction to these accounts\\". Critical reception Jim Lippard described the quality of research in the book as \\"very shoddy\\". The book had a large number of typographical errors. He also said that Wilson's message about avoiding dogmatism was worthwhile, that the book was entertaining but that readers should be careful about taking Wilsons' explanations seriously. Lippard listed inaccuracies about the Esperanza Stone, fish falling from the sky and the alleged Mars effect.Book Review: The New Inquisition: Irrational Rationalism and the Citadel of Science By Robert Anton Wilson 1987, Falcon Press, 240pp., Jim Lippard, Phoenix Skeptics News (later The Arizona Skeptic) vol. 1, no. 5, March/April 1988, pp. 3-6.) Kristin Buxton compared Wilson to Martin Gardner, noting that Gardner has written on many of the topics that Wilson writes about in the book, taking very different points of view. She pointed out that Gardner doesn't think it is easy to exactly define pseudoscience, nor does Gardner think his ideas are infallible. She mentioned that other reviewers had pointed out problems with the research and that the book needs to be read with care. She concluded with suggesting a merging of the views of Robert Anton Wilson and Martin Gardner as a possible new approach to science.Model Agnosticism vs. A New Idolatry: A Critique of Robert Anton Wilson's The New Inquisition, Kristin Buxton Scientist Carl Sagan criticized Wilson's characterizing people skeptical of the phenomena he relates as an \\"inquisition\\" in his book The Demon-Haunted World, writing: \\"Wilson... describes skeptics as a 'new inquisition.' But to my knowledge no skeptic compels belief. Indeed, on most TV documentaries and talk shows, skeptics get short shrift and almost no air time. All that's happening is that some doctrines and methods are being criticized-at the worst, ridiculed-in magazines like The Skeptical Inquirer with circulations of a few tens of thousands. New Agers are not much, as in earlier times, being called up before criminal tribunals, nor whipped for having visions, and they are certainly not being burned at the stake. Why fear a little criticism? Aren't they interested to see how their beliefs hold up against the best counterarguments skeptics can muster?\\"Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, Random House Publishing Group, 1996, p. 301 References Editions File:NewInquisition2.jpgAlternative cover design * Robert Anton Wilson, The New Inquisition: Irrational Rationalism and the Citadel of Science. 1986. 240 pages. * Robert Anton Wilson, The New Inquisition: Irrational Rationalism and the Citadel of Science. 1994. 256 pages.

It was originally classified as the 4800 Class when introduced in 1932, and renumbered in 1946. Although credited to Collett, the design dated back to 1868 with the introduction of the George Armstrong 517 class. Precursors Like the 48xx/14xx, the 517 Class was a lightweight loco for branchline work; it was built at Wolverhampton Works between 1868 and 1885. In this period evolutionary changes included: * 517-570 ‚Äì with wheelbase, inside bearings to trailing wheels, and saddle tanks built 1868-1869. * 571-576 ‚Äì with wheelbase, outside bearings and side tanks built 1869-1870 * 826-836, 838-849, 1154‚Äì1165, 202-05, 215-222, 1421‚Äì1432, 1433‚Äì1444, 1465-1482 ‚Äì all with wheelbase with side tanks built 1873-1883 * 1483-1488 ‚Äì with wheelbase and side tanks built 1884-1885 Later gradual changes included: Belpaire fireboxes, boilers rated at as opposed to , full cabs, extended bunkers and the progressive conversion of short wheelbase locos to or . From 1924 onwards, several were converted to run with an autocoach, and in this configuration were the direct ancestors of the 48xx class. In this form, the updated 517's were but a small step away from the 48xx. The wheelbase was still , the boiler still rated at only , and the wheels and . New was the Collett-style cab and bunker and the boiler nominally to a new design. A three bar crosshead was added to the motion. This was a 1924 innovation introduced with the GWR 5600 Class and also seen in the 1930s-built 5400, 6400 and 7400 classes of pannier tanks. Into service 1409 with an autotrain. The 4800 Class was designed as a more modern version of the 517 Class, which were by then beginning to show their relative age. The first locomotive, No 4800, was built by Swindon Works and entered service in 1932, with a further seventy-four engines of this type following up to 1936. During this period, Swindon also built twenty 5800 Class engines, which were broadly similar but which were not fitted with autotrain equipment or the Swindon top feed as later fitted to a number of 4800 class engines. The 4800 Class locomotives retained their original numbers until the GWR decided to experimentally convert twelve 2800 Class 2-8-0s for oil-firing. It was decided that the converted engines would be reclassified as the 4800 Class and so the 75 tank locomotives already carrying this designation were reclassified as the 1400 Class with running numbers 1400-1474. The engines did not revert to their original classification after the experiment ended in 1948. They could reach a maximum speed of 80 mph which was much faster than the diesel railcars designed to replace them could reach. The 1400 Class was designed to work with the GWR design of autocoach, a specialist coach designed for push-pull working and which could also be used with engines of other classes such as the 517's, the GWR 5400 Class, the GWR 6400 Class and the older GWR 2021 Class. This lack of auto gear was the cause of earlier scrapping of the 5800 Class as there was no work for them. The last, no. 5815, was withdrawn from Swindon shed in April 1961. The auto-fitted locos fared little better; scrapping commenced in 1956 and all were withdrawn by early 1965. Nos. 1442 and 1450 were withdrawn from Exmouth Junction shed in May 1965. By the early 1960s several had been 'in store' (parked in an out-of-the-way siding with a tarpaulin over the chimney) for some time, being occasionally steamed to replace failed diesels.  Preservation  \\"Tivvy Bumper\\" locomotive 1442 in its original resting-place on Blundell's Road, Tiverton, photographed in 1968Four examples have been preserved, all late withdrawals from service in the 1963-1965 period.

Description  It is located between Gap and Brian√ßon and at the eastern end of one of the largest artificial lakes in Western Europe: the Lac de Serre-Pon√ßon. The Canadian town of Embrun, Ontario was named after Embrun in 1856.  History  Embrun was formerly known as Ebrodunum ( in Greek language sources). There is some variation in the writing of the first part of the name. It is Epebrodunum in Strabo's text, but later translators corrected it. Strabo (iv.) says that from Tarasco to the borders of the Vocontii and the beginning of the ascent of the Alps, through the Druentia and Caballio, is 63 miles; and from thence to the other boundaries of the Vocontii, to the kingdom of Cottius (the Alpes Cottiae), to the village of Ebrodunum, 99 miles. Ebrodunum was in the civitas (tribal state) of the Caturiges, and just on the borders of the Vocontii, as it appears. The position of Ebrodunum is easily determined by the itineraries and the name. Ptolemy (iii. 1) mentions Eborodunum as the city of the Caturiges, and no other. In the Jerusalem Itinerary Ebrodunum is called Mansio, like Caturiges (modern Chorges), which was also in the territory of the Caturiges. There are Roman remains at Chorges, and none are mentioned at Embrun, though it appears that the cathedral of Embrun is built on the site of a Roman temple, or that some of the materials of a temple were used for it. Ebrodunum was, for a time, the capital of the Roman province of Alpes Maritimae. In the feudal age, it was an important archbishopric see. The town was sacked in 1585 by Huguenots and in 1692 by the duke of Savoy during the Nine Years' War. In stage 17 of the 2013 Tour de France, Embrun was the starting point for an individual time trial. In 2017, stage 19 of the Tour de France started at Embrun.  Ecclesiastical history  Embrun was the see of a bishopric since the fourth century, which became a Metropolitan archbishopric in the fourteenth century and was suppressed in the French Revolution.

Winters are rather cold and snowy. Winter nights are very cold (about -3 ¬∞C) compare to the other French cities. That's because Embrun is very far from the French coasts, and near the mountains. It creates a severe climate throughout the year. In spite of the cold winters, summers tend to be hot and hazy. The afternoon average temperatures are around 28 ¬∞C, but can sometimes exceed 35 ¬∞C.

Starting with The Quatermass Xperiment, he scored such classic films as The Curse of Frankenstein and Dracula. He also occasionally scored non-Hammer films including Windom's Way (1957) and Torture Garden (1967). Early years and World War II Bernard was educated at Wellington College, previously attended by Christopher Lee, the future star of many Hammer horror films Bernard was to score. In an interview late in his life, Bernard recalled that in his mid-teens three of his favourite books were The Devil Rides Out, She, and The Hound of the Baskervilles. While still a schoolboy, Bernard met Benjamin Britten when the composer came to consult the school's art master, Kenneth Green, about the stage designs for Peter Grimes.Huckvale (2008): p. 106 Britten took interest in an inter-house music composition, and advised Bernard on the music he was writing. The two stayed in touch during Bernard's service in the RAF from 1943 to 1946, and Britten encouraged him to learn the principles of composition. During the war, Bernard worked with the team dedicated to breaking the code of the German Enigma machine, specialising in deciphering intercepted Japanese messages. During those years, on occasion Bernard came to London to turn pages for Britten while he played piano in recitals. In 1944 Bernard met Paul Dehn, who was then a Major working for Military Intelligence, Section 6 (MI6). This was the start of a lifelong partnership, the two moving in together in an apartment on London's King's Road while Bernard was still serving with the RAF in 1946. Musical training and first scores After being demobbed, Bernard enrolled as a student at the Royal College of Music (RCM) in 1947, studying under Herbert Howells. He graduated in 1949. In 1950 Britten asked him to copy out the full score of his new opera Billy Budd for his publishers Boosey & Hawkes,Bridcut, p. 254 inviting him to stay at his home in Aldeburgh. He went to the opera's opening night with Benjamin Britten's housekeeper and the librettist, E. M. Forster. Paul Dehn, by now a writer and critic, asked Bernard to collaborate with him on the original screenplay for the Boulting Brothers film Seven Days to Noon (1950). For this Paul Dehn and James Bernard shared the 1952 Academy Award for the Best Writing, Motion Picture Story. Then in 1953 Bernard received his first commission to write incidental music: for a radio play by Patric Dickinson, The Death of Hector.Huckvale (2006): p. 39 Not having been taught orchestration at the RCM, Bernard often turned for advice to Imogen Holst, whom Britten had recommended when Bernard had asked for someone \\"with whom I could study or go to or take things to\\".Huckvale (2006): p. 40 Bernard also sought her assistance when writing incidental music for a broadcast radio production of The Duchess of Malfi, which starred Richard Burton, Peggy Ashcroft and Paul Scofield.Huckvale (2006): p. 41 The music for this so impressed John Hollingsworth, effectively the music director of Hammer Film Productions, that when the composer originally scheduled to score The Quatermass Xperiment fell ill the job was offered to Bernard. Work for Hammer The Quatermass Xperiment was scored for strings and percussion only at John Hollingsworth's instruction: \\"I don't think he trusted me with anything more than a small string orchestra\\", Bernard later suggested. \\"At that time John Hollingsworth was one of the chief conductors of the Royal Ballet at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, so he used players from the Opera House orchestra,\\" Bernard elsewhere wrote.Larson (1996): \\"Introduction\\" by James Bernard, p.xii The score, predating Bernard Herrmann's for Psycho by five years, has been cited as the first film score to treat strings in an unconventional, non-romantic manner,Huckvale (2006): p. 49 including the use of tone clusters and asking string players to bow on the wrong side of the bridge.Huckvale (2006): p. 51 Again, Bernard showed the score to Imogen Holst before he committed it to the recording sessions for the soundtrack. Following his scores to X the Unknown and Quatermass 2, Bernard scored Hammer's first horror film, The Curse of Frankenstein (1957). This included some music he had originally composed for The Duchess of Malfi.Huckvale (2006): p. 45 Next came Dracula (1958), in which the title cue featured a motif based on the sound Dra-cu-laaaaa, inspired by a suggestion Paul Dehn made to Bernard. Other Hammer horror scores include The Kiss of the Vampire (1962), The Gorgon (1964), Dracula: Prince of Darkness (1966), The Plague of the Zombies (1966), The Devil Rides Out (1968), Dracula Has Risen from the Grave (1968), Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed (1969), Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell (1974) and The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires (1974). He also scored non- horror Hammer films such as The Hound of the Baskervilles (1959), The Stranglers of Bombay (1959), The Terror of the Tongs (1961), The Damned (1963), The Secret of Blood Island (1964), and She (1965). A distinctive trait in Bernard's Hammer scores are their use of clashing harmonies, often created by doubling a motif a tone higher, as in his famous Dracula theme. His music is also frenzied and pacey at times, frequently making use of percussion such as timpani and snares. The Devil Rides Out (1968) and The Plague of the Zombies (1966) are good examples of this. However, he could also write lushly romantic melodies, such as appear in Frankenstein Created Woman (1967), Taste the Blood of Dracula (1970) and Scars of Dracula (also 1970). Unlike the majority of film composers, Bernard orchestrated almost all of his work.Tom Vallance \\"James Bernard\\", The Independent, 18 July 2001. Retrieved on 27 March 2009. Final decades Paul Dehn died in 1976. Working on She (1965), Bernard first met the man who later became his second life partner, actor Ken McGregor (died January 24, 1994), with whom he lived in Jamaica until McGregor's death there in 1994. Bernard then moved back to London and lived there for the remainder of his life.Alexander Gleason \\"Obituary: James Bernard\\", The Guardian, 20 August 2001. Retrieved on 27 March 2009. In later years, he was called upon by silent film historian Kevin Brownlow to write an original score for F. W. Murnau's classic silent horror Nosferatu (1922/1997) and for Brownlow's documentary Universal Horror (1998) on the horror films of the American studio. He also wrote the score to Paul Cotgrove's 2001 short horror film Green Fingers (starring Hammer veteran actresses Ingrid Pitt and Janina Faye).

They are divided into two groups referred to as the first and the second kind. A linear Volterra equation of the first kind is : f(t) = \\\\int_a^t K(t,s)\\\\,x(s)\\\\,ds where ∆í is a given function and x is an unknown function to be solved for. A linear Volterra equation of the second kind is : x(t) = f(t) + \\\\int_a^t K(t,s)x(s)\\\\,ds. In operator theory, and in Fredholm theory, the corresponding operators are called Volterra operators. A useful method to solve such equations, the Adomian decomposition method, is due to George Adomian. A linear Volterra integral equation is a convolution equation if : x(t) = f(t) + \\\\int_{t_0}^t K(t-s)x(s)\\\\,ds. The function K in the integral is called the kernel. Such equations can be analyzed and solved by means of Laplace transform techniques. The Volterra integral equations were introduced by Vito Volterra and then studied by Traian Lalescu in his 1908 thesis, Sur les √©quations de Volterra, written under the direction of √âmile Picard. In 1911, Lalescu wrote the first book ever on integral equations. Volterra integral equations find application in demography, the study of viscoelastic materials, and in actuarial science through the renewal equation.  Conversion of Volterra equation of the first kind to the second kind  A linear Volterra equation of the first kind can always be reduced to a linear Volterra equation of the second kind, assuming that K(t,t) eq 0. Taking the derivative of the first kind Volterra equation gives us:{df\\\\over{dt}} = \\\\int_{a}^{t}{\\\\partial K\\\\over{\\\\partial t}}x(s)ds + K(t,t)x(t)Dividing through by K(t,t) yields:x(t) = {1\\\\over{K(t,t)}}{df\\\\over{dt}} - \\\\int_{a}^{t}{1\\\\over{K(t,t)}}{\\\\partial K\\\\over{\\\\partial t}}x(s)dsDefining \\\\widetilde{f}(t) = {1\\\\over{K(t,t)}}{df\\\\over{dt}} and \\\\widetilde{K}(t,s) = -{1\\\\over{K(t,t)}}{\\\\partial K\\\\over{\\\\partial t}} completes the transformation of the first kind equation into a linear Volterra equation of the second kind.  Numerical solution using trapezoidal rule  A standard method for computing the numerical solution of a linear Volterra equation of the second kind is the trapezoidal rule, which for equally-spaced subintervals \\\\Delta x is given by:\\\\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx \\\\approx {\\\\Delta x\\\\over{2}}\\\\left[f(x_{0}) + 2\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} f(x_{i}) + f(x_{n}) \\\\right ]Assuming equal spacing for the subintervals, the integral component of the Volterra equation may be approximated by:\\\\int_{a}^{t}K(t,s)x(s)ds \\\\approx {\\\\Delta s\\\\over{2}}\\\\left[K(t,s_{0})x(s_{0}) + 2K(t,s_{1})x(s_{1}) + \\\\cdots + 2K(t,s_{n-1})x(s_{n-1}) + K(t,s_{n})x(s_{n}) \\\\right ]Defining x_{i} = x(s_{i}), f_{i} = f(t_{i}), and K_{ij} = K(t_{i},s_{j}), we have the system of linear equations:\\\\begin{aligned} x_{0} &= f_{0}  x_{1} &= f_{1} + {\\\\Delta s\\\\over{2}}\\\\left(K_{10}x_{0} + K_{11}x_{1} \\\\right )  x_{2} &= f_{2} + {\\\\Delta s\\\\over{2}}\\\\left(K_{20}x_{0} + 2K_{21}x_{1} + K_{22}x_{2} \\\\right )  &\\\\vdots  x_{n} &= f_{n} + {\\\\Delta s\\\\over{2}}\\\\left(K_{n0}x_{0} + 2K_{n1}x_{1} + \\\\cdots + 2K_{n,n-1}x_{n-1} + K_{nn}x_{n} \\\\right ) \\\\end{aligned}This is equivalent to the matrix equation:x = f + Mx \\\\implies x = (I-M)^{-1}fFor well-behaved kernels, the trapezoidal rule tends to work well.  Application: Ruin theory  One area where Volterra integral equations appear is in ruin theory, the study of the risk of insolvency in actuarial science. The objective is to quantify the probability of ruin \\\\psi(u) = \\\\mathbb{P}[\\\\tau(u) < \\\\infty], where u is the initial surplus and \\\\tau(u) is the time of ruin. In the classical model of ruin theory, the net cash position X_{t} is a function of the initial surplus, premium income earned at rate c, and outgoing claims \\\\xi:X_{t} = u + ct - \\\\sum_{i=1}^{N_{t}}\\\\xi_{i}, \\\\quad t \\\\geq 0 where N_{t} is a Poisson process for the number of claims with intensity \\\\lambda. Under these circumstances, the ruin probability may be represented by a Volterra integral equation of the form:\\\\psi(u) = {\\\\lambda\\\\over{c}}\\\\int_{u}^{\\\\infty}S(x)dx + {\\\\lambda\\\\over{c}}\\\\int_{0}^{u}\\\\psi(u-x)S(x)dx where S(\\\\cdot) is the survival function of the claims distribution.

History To the southwest of the village is Arbury Banks, the remains of an Iron Age hill fort which have been largely removed by agricultural activity. In 2002 a local metal detectors found a silver Roman figurine of a goddess, Dea Senuna. A subsequent archaeological dig over four summers revealed 26 more gold and silver objects situated in a major open-air ritual site.Lucas, Julie (10 August 2018). History: the goddess of Ashwell. Hertfordshire Life. The Buckinghamshire family of Nernewt (Nernuyt) held land here in the 14th century, which was originally part of the Abbot of Westminster's manor. This land became the manor of Westbury Nernewtes.Parishes of Ashwell from British HistoryNational Archives The village has a wealth of architecture spanning several centuries. There was also a great fire of Ashwell on Saturday 2 February 1850, without fatalities. The village itself is mostly in a fine state of preservation, from the medieval cottage to the fine town house, plastered or timbered, thatched or tiled, in Tudor, Carolean or Georgian brick. 'Scheduled' listed buildings include the St. John's Guildhall of 1681, the carefully restored Foresters Cottages, the Chantry House with its 15th-century window, the 16th-century town house (now a local museum), the Maltings (now converted into flats), and a small brick house which was first built in 1681 as a school by the Merchant Taylors. Ashwell Bury, a large Victorian house, was remodelled by Edwin Lutyens in the 1920s. Lutyens also designed the Grade 2 listed Ashwell War Memorial, unveiled in 1922. Ashwell also has a village lock-up that was used to detain drunks and suspected criminals. The village used to be home to a number of local breweries and, accordingly, a variety of public houses in its past, but currently has just three pubs: The Rose and Crown, the Three Tuns and the Bushel and Strike. Since 1850 the village has been served by Ashwell and Morden railway station which is about a mile and half from the centre of the village in the hamlet of Odsey in Cambridgeshire. Church The parish church of St Mary the Virgin dates almost entirely from the 14th century and is renowned for its ornate church tower which stands at , and is crowned by an octagonal lantern with a leaded 'spike'. The church also contains some medieval graffiti carved on its walls which highlights the plight of survivors of the bubonic plague pandemic known as the Black Death. In 2013, the village church became the centre of a nationally reported row over the quarter-hourly chiming of the clock. Complaints about the chimes during the night were initially received in the summer of that year, which North Hertfordshire District Council (NHDC) was legally obliged to investigate. In December, the council ruled that the chimes are \\"prejudicial to health\\" and have to be silenced between 11 pm and 6 am. Complying with the ruling has meant turning off the chimes altogether, although the parish council has asked the diocese in St Albans if it can install a timing mechanism that will restrict the chimes to the legally appointed hours, and has launched an appeal to raise the ¬£1,900 cost. The chiming clock was initially installed in 1898, but was turned off for 18 months in 2011 and 2012 while repairs were carried out. A public meeting on 19 January 2014 discussed the future of the chimes.(23 December 2013) Complaints silence church bells for first time in 117 years telegraph.co.uk(19 August 2013) Ashwell villagers row over 'silencing' church bells BBC News ‚Äì Beds, Bucks & Herts(23 December 2013) Ashwell silences 'sleep disturbing' St Mary's church chimes BBC News ‚Äì Beds, Bucks & HertsRoss-Millar, Lucy (12 December 2013) Church bells at risk from pleas for silent night cambridge-news.co.uk In May 2015, a timer had been installed to silence the church bells overnight. Geography Ashwell Springs, a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest, is a perennial source of the River Cam. The cool water of the chalk springs contain a rare species of stenothermic flatworm (Platyhelminthes; Tricladida) associated with cold surface waters or subterranean groundwater that is only known from this location within East Anglia. The springs now depend upon artificial flow augmentation during drier periods, due to the impact of local groundwater abstraction from the chalk aquifer for public water supply. The village is a \\"green oasis\\" with many trees and this contrasts with the surrounding landscape dominated by intense agricultural production, principally of wheat, with rather limited aesthetic or biodiversity interest. Sport Ashwell has several successful sports teams from under-12s to veterans. The adult first football team have won several trophies and are currently in the Hall's of Cambridge Sunday league premier division. The cricket team won the Cambridgeshire Junior Cup in 2003 and currently play in Division 1 of the Cambridgeshire league. There are many other clubs and societies catering for all interests. Ashwell have a junior soccer side called the Academicals, which are from age 5 to 18.

The film was directed by Don Sharp and was written by producer Anthony Hinds, credited under his writing pseudonym John Elder. It was Sharp's first movie for Hammer and he would go on to make several films for the company. Plot Gerald (Edward de Souza) and Marianne Harcourt (Jennifer Daniel), are a honeymooning couple in early 20th-century Bavaria who become caught up in a vampire cult led by Dr. Ravna (Noel Willman) and his two children Carl (Barry Warren) and Sabena (Jacquie Wallis). The cult abducts Marianne, and contrives to make it appear that Harcourt was travelling alone and that his wife never existed. Harcourt gets help from hard-drinking savant Professor Zimmer (Clifford Evans), who lost his daughter to the cult and who finally destroys the vampires through an arcane ritual utilising the Seal of Solomon that releases a swarm of bats from Hell. Cast * Clifford Evans as Professor Zimmer * Noel Willman as Dr. Ravna * Edward de Souza as Gerald Harcourt * Jennifer Daniel as Marianne Harcourt * Barry Warren as Carl Ravna * Brian Oulton as 1st disciple * Noel Howlett as Father Xavier * Jacquie Wallis as Sabena Ravna * Peter Madden as Bruno * Isobel Black as Tania * Vera Cook as Anna * John Harvey as Police sergeant * Carl Esmond as Anton Stangher (TV movie only) * Virginia Gregg as Rosa Stangher (TV movie only) * Sheilah Wells as Theresa Stangher (TV movie only) Background Originally intended to be the third movie in Hammer's Dracula series (which began with 1958's Dracula with Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing, and was followed by 1960's The Brides of Dracula with Cushing alone), it was another attempt by Hammer to make a Dracula sequel without Christopher Lee. The final script, by Anthony Hinds, makes no reference to \\"Dracula,\\" and expands further on the directions taken in Brides by portraying vampirism as a social disease afflicting those who choose a decadent lifestyle. The job of directing was offered to Don Sharp, who later said he had never seen a horror film before being asked to the job by Tony Hinds. Hinds told Sharp he thought the director would be ideal based on Sharp's other work. The director watched Curse of Frankenstein, Dracula and Stranglers from Bombay and became enthusiastic.Koetting p 8 \\"What intrigued me about them was after about 20 minutes I was totally hooked despite a totally absurd situation,\\" he said later. \\"I thought it was wonderful - here was a genre with its own ground rules and self contained world and you could be theatrical but treat it realistically to grab the audience and make them believe something absurd.\\"Koetting p 8 Sharp said he was worried that \\"as Hammer progressed, the goal seemed to be for each picture to top the one before it and they were becoming satiated with violence. So I persuaded Tony that it was better to suggest 'Is it going to happen?' and give the audience a little touch of it, and then go on and really get your big shock at the end. There could be a good size shock in the middle too but not all the time.\\"Koetting p 9 Sharp said \\"I've always believed there needs to be a separation between suspense and shock. You lead on a mood but if you introduce the shock moment too quickly then it's expected. If you hang on keeping the same mood and tempo as the rest of the sequence, and then shatter the mood with a sudden violent moment, that's when it really works.\\"Koetting p 9 The film went into production on 7 September 1962 at Bray Studios. It was not released until 1964.Koetting p 10 This is the only credited feature film screen role of Jacquie Wallis, who plays Sabena. The film's climax, involving black magic and swarms of bats, was originally intended to be the ending of The Brides of Dracula, but the star of that film, Peter Cushing, objected that Van Helsing would never resort to black sorcery. The paperback novelization of Brides does, however, use this ending. Alternate version Retitled Kiss of Evil for American TV, Universal trimmed so much of the original film for its initial television screening that more footage had to be shot to fill the missing time. Additional characters that didn't appear at all in the original release were added, creating a whole new subplot. Every scene that showed blood was edited out, e.g. the pre-credits scene in which blood gushes from the coffin of Zimmer's daughter after he plunges a shovel into it. Also, in the televised version it is never revealed what Marianne sees behind the curtain (Ravna lying on his bed with blood trickling from the corners of his mouth), a sight which makes her scream. A couple of the cuts result in scenes that no longer make sense: while the theatrical release had Harcourt smearing the blood on his chest into a cross-shaped pattern (keeping the vampires away as he escapes), the televised version omits the blood-smearing, leaving the vampires' inaction unexplained. The additional footage shot for the televised version revolves around a family, the Stanghers, who argue about the influence of the vampiric Ravna clan but never interact with anybody else in the movie. The teenage daughter, Theresa, throws over her boyfriend in favor of Carl Ravna (unseen in these scenes) who has given her a music box which plays the same hypnotic tune that he plays on the piano elsewhere in the movie. Critical reception Howard Thompson of The New York Times wrote, \\"Until the picture floridly hops off the track toward the end, this horror exercise is a quietly stylish, ice-cold treat, beautifully tinted, well-directed (Don Sharp) and persuasively acted (Edward de Souza and Jennifer Daniel have the leads).\\" Variety wrote, \\"Horror fans will dig this latest effort from the Hammer Film shop in Britain. It is a slickly-produced color story of evil doings in Bavaria, circa 1910, replete with suspense, demonism and mystery tightly wrapped in a skillful package of effective performance and well-paced direction.\\" The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote, \\"No new developments seem to have emerged in the vampire world, and this film is a straightforward and rather tame rehash of the standard formula ... The direction is competent enough, though Don Sharp reveals no flair for this kind of thing, and there is a signal lack of atmosphere.\\" Home video release In North America, the film was released on 6 September 2005 along with seven other Hammer horror films- The Brides of Dracula, Nightmare, The Evil of Frankenstein, The Curse of the Werewolf, Paranoiac, Night Creatures, The Phantom of the Opera-on the 4-DVD set The Hammer Horror Series (ASIN: B0009X770O), which is part of MCA- Universal's Franchise Collection. This set was re-released on Blu-ray on 13 September 2016. In July 2020, Scream Factory released the film with a Collector's Edition Blu-ray that included both 1.85:1 and 1.66:1 aspect ratios, as well as the TV version Kiss of Evil in standard definition.

The line-up was Stewart Lupton (vocals), Tom Frank (bass), Paul Maroon (guitar and pedal steel), Matt Barrick (drums), and Walter Martin (organs, keyboards). After the band's break-up, Maroon, Barrick, and Martin went on to form The Walkmen. History Jonathan Fire*Eater was formed from a childhood band called The Ignobles. All the members of Jonathan Fire*Eater attended high school at the D.C. private school St. Albans School. Lupton, Martin, and Barrick formed the Ignobles in junior high school. Maroon joined as the guitarist and Ryan Cheney signed on as the vocalist. Lupton played bass. In 1993, the members went to college, mostly in New York City, and Jonathan Fire*Eater was formed with Cheney departing and later joining The Cunning Runts and Lupton taking over vocal duties. St. Albans alum Tom Frank joined as a new bassist. In 1995, they released their eponymous debut on Tucson, Arizona's Third World Underground Records, which featured \\"Christmastime, Halloween\\", \\"To The Tigers\\", and other tracks. Later that year, a self-titled EP on PCP established their reputation with the frenetic tracks \\"The Public Hanging of a Movie Star\\" and \\"When Prince Was a Kid\\". In 1996, the five-song mini-album Tremble Under Boom Lights was released by the Medicine label, featuring well-produced offers such as \\"The Search for Cherry Red\\" and \\"Give Me Daughters\\". Reviews were positive, with AllMusic describing Tremble as \\"a ferocious record\\" despite its \\"minor flaws.\\" By this time, the band was receiving considerable media and industry attention. They were courted by Calvin Klein to model and opened for Brit Pop stars Pulp and Blur. As Lupton said in a 1996 New York Times Magazine profile, \\"Right now the record companies are sort of circling like vultures.\\" In early 1997, Jonathan Fire*Eater signed with David Geffen's nascent DreamWorks music label. Their major label debut, Wolf Songs for Lambs, was released by DreamWorks in 1997 to tepid critical response. Not long after the album's release, tensions between Lupton and the other members and a general wariness of mainstream success led to the band's breakup. They played their last show at the Central Park bandshell on July 28, 1998. Jonathan Fire*Eater was once called \\"possibly the most hyped young group that nobody has ever heard of\\".Lackluster Set Douses Hype Fueling Jonathan Fire Eater: Los Angeles Times, December 6, 1997.

Maroon, Barrick, and Martin later went on to form The Walkmen and Lupton has pursued his music career through his band The Childballads, who put out their debut album in January 2007. The latter has toured with Cat Power and the Kills. In 2009, he released an EP in a new band, The Beatin's, which he formed with Carole Wagner Greenwood. Titled A Little Give And Take, the limited edition vinyl included Lupton's poetry and the duo's art and writing. Tom Frank pursued a career in journalism as T.A. Frank. Stewart Lupton died on May 27, 2018 at the age of 43. Legacy In addition to being a precursor to the Walkmen, Jonathan Fire*Eater has also been cited as an influence by many of the early New York City-based groups of the post-punk revival, including Interpol and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and comparisons were drawn between the band and the Strokes. The Kills, also considered part of the post-punk revival, covered \\"The Search for Cherry Red\\"; their version was released as a B-side to their single \\"Pull A U\\".

It is commonly included in a Swedish Christmas dinner table, but is often eaten on other occasions including Easter. The dish is also common in Finland where it is known as janssoninkiusaus. Preparation Close-up view of a Janssons frestelse dish The potatoes are cut into thin strips and layered in a roasting tin, alternating with the sprats and chopped onions in between. Salt and pepper is put over each layer, then cream is added so that it almost fills the tin. It is finally baked in an oven at for about one hour. The website V√§lmatade historier, recipe and article on Janssons frestelse, discussing the name (in Swedish) The recipe is often mistranslated into English, with anchovies being substituted for sprats. This is because sprats (Sprattus sprattus) pickled in sugar, salt and spices have been known in Sweden as ansjovis since the middle of the 19th century, while true anchovies (Engraulis encrasicolus) are sold in Sweden as sardeller (sardelles). Also, small herrings (Clupea harengus) may be used instead of sprats. Name and origin It has often been associated with the opera singer Per Adolf \\"Pelle\\" Janzon (1844‚Äì1889), remembered as a gourmand. However, another claim for the origin of the name has been made by Gunnar Stigmark (1910-2001) in an article ‚Äì \\"S√• var det med Janssons frestelse\\" ‚Äì which appeared in the periodical Gastronomisk kalender. According to Stigmark, the name was borrowed from the film Janssons frestelse (1928) featuring the popular actor Edvin Adolphson; as a name for this dish it was coined by Stigmark's mother and her hired cooking lady for the particular occasion of a society dinner, whence it spread to other households and eventually into cookbooks.

The players in the starting lineup are commonly referred to as starters, whereas the others are substitutes or bench players. The starters are commonly the best players on the team at their respective positions. Consequently, there is often a bit of prestige that is associated with being a starter. This is particularly true in sports with limited substitutions, like baseball or association football (soccer). When listing a team's lineup, it is common in some sports to include each player's uniform number and their position, along with their name. Position are often designated by abbreviations that are specific to the sport (for example, in American football; \\"SS\\" for strong safety). In both baseball and basketball, it is common for a player's position to be denoted by a number, for example: in baseball scorekeeping the shortstop position is \\"6\\", while in basketball the small forward position is known as the \\"three\\". Thus, the lineups for some sports can include a uniform number, the player's name, and an abbreviation (consisting of letters or numbers) denoting a position. Starting lineup in specific sports =American football= In American football since the 1950s, most upper level teams use a three-platoon system, each with its own starting lineup. The starting lineups for offense and defense, each with eleven players, typically get the most attention. The starting lineups are defined as the eleven players who take the first offensive or defensive play from scrimmage of a given game. (An offensive player does not have to be on the team that gets possession first to be considered a starter, nor does a defensive player have to be on the team that does not; the first play from scrimmage after the first change of possession counts as well.) The third platoon, special teams, in modern times is composed mostly of backup and reserve players from the offensive or defensive platoons, with the exception of the placekicker or punter; the players who, for instance, take part in the opening kickoff are typically not considered starters. The player positions dictate certain responsibilities and privileges in regard to handling the ball. A uniform numbering system restricts players' ability to change positions in the middle of the game. ;Offense The offensive lineup is heavily restricted by rules that have been adopted over the course of the game's development. Several positions (indicated with * in the list below) are mandatory and must appear in any lineup, starting or otherwise. Others can be used or unused at the discretion of a team's coach, provided that no more than 11 players are on the field at any given time and at least seven (usually exactly seven) are positions along the line of scrimmage. * Quarterback‚ÄîOfficially listed in the high school rulebooks as a \\"snap receiver,\\" the starting quarterback is usually the focal point of a team's offense. Though technically not required (the snapper can in theory snap the ball onto the ground), the position is universally used. * Running back‚ÄîIn the pro set formation and the I-formation, there are two, the halfback and the fullback. Some teams forgo designating a full back, and instead replace him with an extra tight end, H-back, or wide receiver. Other teams may utilize three starting running backs, especially at lower levels of play where the passing game is not as developed. Historically, teams which utilized the T-formation or the Single-wing formation had three starting running backs as well. * Center*‚ÄîThe player in the middle of the line of scrimmage. (This player is almost always the player who snaps the ball, although this role by rule can be taken by any player on the line of scrimmage.) * Left and right guards*‚Äî Lines up on each side of the center. * Left and right tackles*‚Äî Lines up outside the guards. * Tight end‚Äî lines up outside the tackles. Most teams designate at least one starting tight end, though some may have two starting tight ends (by playing with either one less wide receiver or one less running back). Some offensive philosophies, such as the run and shoot offense forgo the tight end entirely. * Wide receiver‚ÄîModern offenses always have at least two starting wide receivers, though historically the position was the last to develop, originally gaining its modern form as teams moved either a tight end (whose name was changed to a \\"split end\\") or running back (whose name was changed to \\"flanker\\") out wide to be in a better position to catch passes away from the defense. Many modern offenses designate three wide receivers as starters, rarely (but not unknown) are teams that will designated four starting wide receivers, such as the run and shoot offense popular in the 1990s. * Nonstandard positions such as slotback, wingback, or H-back may also be starters depending on the offensive philosophy of the team. In addition to the center, guards and tackles, at least two ends (be they tight ends or split end wide receivers) must also be in the lineup. ;Defense In recent history the 4-3 defense (4 defensive linemen plus 3 linebackers) formation has been standard among college and professional squads. However, the 3-4 (3 defensive linemen plus 4 linebackers) formation is becoming more popular among professional and NCAA Division I teams. Unlike offenses, defenses have no restrictions on positions, and the standard lineups have developed largely through tradition, experimentation, trial and error. * Defensive tackle‚ÄîDepending on formation a team may have up to two defensive tackles. If there is only one he is called the Nose Tackle (NT) * Defensive end‚ÄîA team has two defensive ends which play outside the defensive tackles * Linebacker‚ÄîA team will generally start between two and four linebackers, depending on the defensive strategy. Most teams either play a 4-3 defense (with 4 lineman and 3 linebackers) or a 3-4 defense (with 3 linemen and 4 linebackers), while some teams employ a nickel defense as their starting defense, such teams typically only use 2 linebackers. Starting linebackers may be designated with names like \\"outside linebacker\\", \\"inside linebacker\\", \\"middle linebacker\\", etc. depending on where they play and the defensive philosophy of the team. *Defensive back‚ÄîA team will usually start four defensive backs, though rarely teams may start five by removing a linebacker from the field. Those defensive backs are known as: **Cornerback‚ÄîPlays outside and near the line of scrimmage, with a primary responsibility of covering the other team's wide receivers on pass plays **Strong safety‚Äîplays behind, but close to, the linebackers, usually on the same side of the field as the other team's tight end, the strong safety plays like a linebacker/defensive back hybrid. **Free safety‚ÄîDeepest player on the field, whose primary responsibility is as a last line of defense on long passes or to stop running plays that all other players have missed. **Nickel back‚ÄîIn teams which start five defensive backs, the fifth back is called the \\"nickel\\" (by analogy to the U.S. five-cent coin, known as the nickel) Such a player typically plays on the line of scrimmage, between one of the cornerbacks and the defensive end, often to cover another team's third wide receiver. * Nonstandard defensive positions such as the \\"rover\\" position (first employed by George Webster) are rare but may be used as well. ;Special teams The third phase, special teams, generally designates only a few positions as \\"starters\\", other than these specialists the other positions on the field are taken up as secondary positions by players who normally play offense or defense. *Kicker‚ÄîAlso called the placekicker, kicks the ball on plays where it must be kicked from the ground, either kickoffs or field goals. *Punter‚ÄîKicks the ball in situations where it must be kicked by dropping it from his hand. This occurs on punts and free kicks. *Long snapper‚ÄîSnaps the ball on field goals and punts, where the ball must normally go much farther than the center usually snaps it. *Kick returner and Punt returner‚ÄîCatches and attempts to run back kickoffs, free kicks and punts. On some teams this may be the same player, and others may use two different players for these roles. *Gunner‚ÄîPlays outside on kickoffs, free kicks, and punts; is usually the first player to reach the other team's returner. Rarely has been a starting-level player, though some such as Steve Tasker and Matthew Slater have achieved wide recognition for their skills primarily as gunners. =Association football= In Association football, Starting lineup is termed a starting 11 (starting eleven) or starting XI. The starting 11 or starting XI is a list of the players who will actively participate in the game when the match begins. The starting 11 consists of 11 players, with 1 designated goalkeeper. All other positions are optional, and teams can vary the player formations they use. The formation are often described using the numbers of defenders, midfielders and striker/attackers used. For example, a commonly used formation is 4-4-2, which means there are 4 defenders, 4 midfielders and 2 strikers. Some formations may list 4 numbers, which usually differentiates between defensive and attacking midfielders, e.g. 4-2-3-1 would mean 4 defenders, 2 defensive midfielders, 3 attacking midfielders, and 1 striker. =Australian rules football= In Australian rules football, a team starts with eighteen players on the field. The traditional positions are as listed below, however in modern football the players are organised into three main groups, forwards, midfielders and defenders, each consisting of between four and eight players. Only four midfielders from each team are allowed to start inside the centre square, the other 14 players can start anywhere on the field. * Three forwards (one Full- forward, two Forward pocket) * Three half forwards (one Centre half-forward, two Half-forward flank) * Three centres (one Centre, two Wing-men) * Three half backs (one Centre half-back, two Half-back flank) * Three backs (one Fullback, two Back pocket) * Three followers (one Ruckman, one Ruck rover, one Rover) =Baseball= The starting lineup in baseball comprises either nine or ten players. In the National League of Major League Baseball and the Central League of Nippon Professional Baseball, there are nine players in the starting lineup and all players bat. American League (MLB) and Pacific League (NPB) teams have the option of using a designated hitter (DH) in place of the pitcher in the batting order. The DH does not play when the team is on defense. # P ‚Äì Pitcher # C ‚Äì Catcher # 1B ‚Äì First baseman # 2B ‚Äì Second baseman # 3B ‚Äì Third baseman # SS ‚Äì Shortstop # LF ‚Äì Left fielder # CF ‚Äì Center fielder # RF ‚Äì Right fielder In softball, where ten players are in the field, the tenth is usually placed in the outfield (OF); if placed between the infield and outfield, the extra fielder is known as a \\"rover.\\" The designated hitter (DH), when used, is designated with the number zero. In variants of the game where all nine positions plus a designated hitter must bat, the designated hitter is instead known as an extra hitter (EH). =Basketball= In the National Basketball Association (NBA), two starting players are traditionally announced as guards, two as forwards, and one as a center. At least ten minutes before the game is scheduled to begin, the scorers need to be supplied with the name and number of each player who is to participate in the game. The various positions are not mentioned anywhere in the official NBA rule book, and most players play more than one position. The starting lineup on a basketball team usually comprises five positions and is called the 2-1-2 lineup: # PG ‚Äì Point guard # SG ‚Äì Shooting guard # SF ‚Äì Small forward # PF ‚Äì Power forward # C ‚Äì Center In American college basketball, a starting lineup is announced for each team before the game. Starting players are designated as either centers, forwards, or guards. A team can name at most one center, but otherwise any combination of positions is allowable, as long as five players are named. Lineups of three guards, one forward, and one center, or of three guards and two forwards, are the most common alternate lineups. =Canadian football= In Canadian football, a team starts with 12 players on offense, 12 players on defense, and a special teams squad of 12 players for punts, kickoffs, and extra point attempts. As in American football, most of the special teams players are starters or bench players for offence or defence. Because of substantial differences between the two codes‚Äîmost notably the larger field and only having three downs to advance the ball 10 yards instead of four‚Äîoffensive formations are somewhat different in the Canadian game. Most notably, tight ends are almost completely absent in Canada. The Canadian Football League has an additional rule that at least seven of the 24 offensive and defensive starters in a game be Canadian citizens. These seven starters can be of any position except quarterback. ;Offence: # QB ‚Äî Quarterback‚ÄîExplicitly mandatory until 2009; effectively mandatory since then. # RB ‚Äî Running back. Optional, but almost universally used, specially in a starting lineup. Note that the term halfback in Canada refers to a defensive position and is not used in regard to a running back. # FB ‚Äî Fullback. Optional. # C ‚Äî Centre. Mandatory. # LG, RG ‚Äî Left and right guards on either side of the centre. Mandatory. # LT, RT ‚Äî Left and right tackles on either end of the five-man offensive line. Mandatory. # SB ‚Äî Slotback, a similar position to the wide receiver (in fact, in the American game a slotback is considered a type of wide receiver), but lines up closer to the interior linemen and just off the line of scrimmage. # WR ‚Äî Wide receiver. Canadian football typically does not use tight ends, and so wide receivers are almost always split ends. ;Defence: Defences are broadly similar to those in the U.S., with the extra player used as a defensive back. Since most of the positions are essentially identical to those in American football, only the main differences will be listed here. # S ‚Äî Safety, plays mainly deep pass support. Roughly corresponds to the \\"free safety\\" in the American game. # DH ‚Äî Defensive halfback(s), generally assigned to cover the slotback(s) when in man-to-man coverage. Most formations will use two halfbacks. Roughly corresponds to the \\"strong safety\\" in the American game. ;Special teams: Positions generally similar to those in the U.S. =Gaelic football & hurling= Gaelic football and hurling, as well as ladies' Gaelic football and camogie, use the same starting lineup. Teams consist of one goalkeeper and fourteen outfield players (underage teams may play 13-a-side, omitting the full back and full forward positions). Teams lineup in six lines, with the goalkeeper furthest back and the full-forward line closest to the opposing team's goal. Players play on the left or right of the field looking in the direction they are attacking. Position numbering is fixed and positions are set up so that every attacker has a corresponding defender: for example, a right corner forward (jersey number 13) will be marked by a left corner back (4). Players sometimes swap positions during a match and there are sometimes tactical variations in formation, such as dropping one of the six forwards back to provide a third midfielder. Up to five substitutions are allowed during normal time (and another three if there is extra time), from a bench of 9 or sometimes 11 substitutions; substitutions are not numbered in any particular order. # Goalkeeper (jersey number 1) # Right corner back (2) -- full back (3) -- left corner back (4) # Right half (or wing) back (5) -- centre back (6) -- left half back (7) # Two midfielders (or centre-fielders) (8, 9) # Right half (or wing) forward (10) -- centre (centre half) forward (11) -- left half forward (12) # Right corner forward (13) -- full forward (14) -- left corner forward (15) =Hurling & camogie= The starting lineup in hurling or camogie is the same as that for Gaelic football. =Ice hockey= In ice hockey, a team starts out with six players on the ice: *Two defensemen *A goaltender *Three forwards: **A center **A left-winger **A right-winger The starting forwards are typically known as the top line or first line, as most professional teams rotate four distinct three- man forward lines and three defense pairings. In ice hockey, a team must submit their starting lineup to the opposing team's captain and to the officials before the game. If a team inserts any other player into the lineup at game time, the opposing captain can direct the official to call a starting the wrong lineup penalty, a two-minute minor. =Lacrosse= The starting lineup in field lacrosse comprises ten players: 3 Attackmen, 3 Defensemen, 3 Midfielders, and 1 Goalkeeper. A team may start a Long-Stick Midfielder for a defensive advantage. A team may have a player reserved exclusively to take face-offs, known as a FOGO. # A ‚Äì Attackmen # D ‚Äì Defensemen # M ‚Äì Midfielder # G ‚Äì Goalkeeper # LSM ‚Äì Long-stick Midfielder # FOGO ‚Äì Face-Off Specialist \\"Face-Off, Get-Off\\" =Netball= In netball, a team starts with seven players on the court: # GS ‚Äì Goal shooter # GA ‚Äì Goal attack # WA ‚Äì Wing attack # C ‚Äì Centre # WD ‚Äì Wing defence # GD ‚Äì Goal defence # GK ‚Äì Goal keeper =Rugby League= A Rugby league football starting lineup is # 1 ‚Äì Fullback # 2 and 5 ‚Äì Wingers # 3 and 4 ‚Äì Centres # 6 ‚Äì Stand-off # 7 ‚Äì Halfback # 8 and 10 ‚Äì Front row forwards # 9 ‚Äì Hooker # 11 and 12 ‚Äì Second row forwards # 13 ‚Äì Lock forward =Rugby Union= Rugby union starting lineups consist of: # Two Props ‚Äì 1 (loosehead) and 3 (tighthead) # Hooker ‚Äì 2 # Two Locks ‚Äì 4 and 5 # Two Flankers ‚Äì 6 and 7 # Number Eight ‚Äì 8 # Scrum-Half ‚Äì 9 # Fly-Half ‚Äì 10 # Two Wings ‚Äì 11 and 14 # Two Centres ‚Äì 12 and 13 # Fullback ‚Äì 15 =Volleyball= The starting lineup for a volleyball match typically includes: #One setter #Two outside hitters #One opposite hitter #Two middle blockers Variations do exist ‚Äì sometimes there will be two setters, or three outside hitters without a true opposite. Though the libero is typically announced with the starting lineup, he or she is not considered to be part of it, as the libero will replace one of the above players (typically a middle blocker, as teams will want to split their middle blockers, with one beginning in the front row) before the first rally.

It is the seat of the Municipality of La≈°ko. Traditionally the area was part of the Styria region. The municipality is now included in the Savinja Statistical Region. The town is located at the foothills of Hum Hill on the Savinja River. It was first mentioned in written documents dating to 1227 and was granted town privileges in 1927.La≈°ko municipal site It is known to have been settled since the Iron Age and Roman archaeological finds are common in the area, though the precise location of the Roman settlement is not known.Slovenian Ministry of Culture register of national heritage reference number e≈°d 12264 Today the town is best known for its annual Festival of Beer & Flowers (Pivo - Cvetje) and the local La≈°ko Brewery, the largest brewery in the country. In 2010, La≈°ko was heavily affected by flooding. The town's coat of arms depicts three white fleurs-de-lis on a blue field. Name La≈°ko was attested in written sources in 1145 under the German name Tyver (and as Tyvre in 1182, Tyuer in 1342, and Tyffer in 1461). The name de Lasca was attested in 1483. The Slovene name is derived from *La≈°ko selo 'Vlach village'; the first element comes from Slavic *V»çlx—ä, referring to the Romanized Celtic population or to other Romance speakers. The Slovene name presumably refers to pre-Slavic ethnic settlement or to medieval settlers from a Romance-speaking area, and it predates the arrival of Italian settlers from the Bergamo area that arrived in La≈°ko after 1554. The German name T√ºffer is believed to derive from Slavic deber 'river strait', referring to the narrowing of the Savinja River. This name is still found in the village of Debro, which lies immediately upriver from La≈°ko and was once known in German as Ober T√ºffer (literally, 'upper T√ºffer'). History Archaeological finds confirm prehistoric settlement in the La≈°ko area. Stone axes discovered on the southeast slope below the old castle date back to the eighth century BC. Two silver Celtic coins have been found in La≈°ko, and several stone funerary monuments dating to the Roman era have been found. The Roman road from Celeia to Zidani Most and onward to Neviodunum passed through La≈°ko.Savnik, Roman, ed. 1976. Krajevni leksikon Slovenije, vol. 3. Ljubljana: Dr≈æavna zalo≈æba Slovenije. pp. 186‚Äì189. One of the oldest buildings in La≈°ko is called ≈†tok or Weixelberger Manor (). The property dates back to the mid-15th century, with records showing that it was given to Nikolaj Behaim by the Counts of Celje in 1437. It was acquired by Sigismund Weixelberger before 1506 and he built the manor at the site. At the end of the 15th century La≈°ko was targeted in Ottoman attacks and was burned at least once. Peasant revolts also took place in the own in 1515 and in 1635. La≈°ko was struck by plague outbreaks several times, especially in 1646 and 1647. Schooling was established in La≈°ko by around 1600. A lower primary school was set up under Empress Maria Theresa in the 18th century. The oldest large-scale industry in La≈°ko dates back to the 18th century. A major fire devastated La≈°ko in 1840, destroying half of the houses in the town. High water on the Savinja River also destroyed the town's bridge several times in the mid-19th century. The railroad reached La≈°ko in 1849. A leather factory was established in 1929, and a textile factory in 1934. =Mass graves= La≈°ko is the site of two known mass graves from the period immediately after the Second World War. The Funeral Chapel Mass Grave () is located west of the La≈°ko Brewery, under the funeral chapel outside the east wall of the town cemetery. The grave contains the remains of Croatian prisoners of war that were murdered after the war. The Cemetery Mass Grave () is located in an unmarked part of the town cemetery. The grave contains the remains of Croatian victims that were discovered during excavations and reburied. Castle The local castle, known as Tabor Castle, dates to the 12th century, although it was first mentioned in written sources dating to 1265. It was burned down during Ottoman Raids in the late 15th century and was extended in the 16th century.Slovenian Ministry of Culture register of national heritage reference number e≈°d 14849 Brewery Brewing in the town dates back to 1817, when the bell-maker Ivan Steinmetz set up a brewery there. The La≈°ko Brewery was sold to Heineken in 2016. Church The parish church in the settlement is dedicated to Saint Martin and belongs to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Celje. It is a Romanesque building dating to the 13th century with various later additions and adaptations.Slovenian Ministry of Culture register of national heritage reference number e≈°d 309 Spa The healing properties of the local waters have been known since antiquity. La≈°ko developed as a health resort towards the end of the 19th century.Jeannie Bastian. The Town of Beer & Flowers. Accessed November 15, 2006. In 1818 a report appeared in a Graz newspaper about the La≈°ko springs. The water temperature was measured at and the establishment of a health spa was announced. An engineer named R√∂del began to work systematically on the springs during the construction of the railway line. Work progressed from September 1852, when he purchased the land, until May 1854, when he ceremoniously opened the spa. The three springs were each given a name: the Emperor's Spring, Franz's Spring, and Joseph's Spring. The spa was given the name Kaiser Franz Josef Bad, after Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria. Along with a building with a pool, R√∂del also rearranged the nearby mill and built a luxurious mansion. In 1857 the spa was purchased by a Viennese professor and cosmopolitan named Stein, who invited the cream of Viennese society to the health spa. For this purpose he built an extension onto the spa building with a dance hall and planted a park. He also took care of his guests' social life. Stein was later forced to sell the spa. The spa's reputation returned under a later owner named Gunkel, who radically renovated it and in 1882 built his own hydroelectric power plant, the first on Slovene soil, which lit up most of the buildings and the whole park. In cooperation with the brewery, they began to brew thermal beer. During World War I the spa played the role of a military hospital. The property was left in disrepair after the war, but was partly renovated in 1923. Later the spa passed into the hands of the Pensions Institute (Pokojninski zavod) and the Central Office for Workers' Insurance (Osrednji urad za zavarovanje delavcev). In October 1953, the spa was registered as a medical rehabilitation centre. Further development mainly followed the needs of the healthcare service and to a large degree it was the fruit of cooperation with the orthopedic (later neurological, traumatology, and neurosurgical) clinics in Ljubljana, regional hospitals, and health centres across Slovenia. The La≈°ko Thermal Spa Resort is becoming one of the most important health spas and tourist centres in Slovenia.

The 2nd Engineer Battalion, 40th Mobility Augmentation Company, makes a bridge for the 3rd Battalion, 41st Infantry Regiment near Oro Grande Range, N.M., during Iron Focus. The M104 Wolverine Heavy Assault Bridge is an armored military engineering vehicle created by General Dynamics Land Systems, designed to provide deployable bridge capability for units engaged in military operations. Background Since the 1960s the United States Army has made use of armored bridge-laying vehicles based on the M48 Patton/M60 series of tanks. In recent years, however, the Army discovered that the aging M60 AVLB (Armored Vehicle Launched Bridge) was too slow to keep up with the M1 Abrams' top speed of roughly 70 km/h during field maneuvers. Additionally, the Abrams was so heavy that it could safely cross the AVLB's bridge only at a very slow speed. Program development for a new armored bridge-laying vehicle began in 1983, and by 1994 General Dynamics Land Systems and the German MAN Mobile Bridges GmbH (since 2005 Krauss-Maffei Wegmann) had been awarded a contract. The first prototype vehicles were being tested by 1996, and the first production models were delivered by 2003. It is unclear why the vehicle was subject to such a long development time. Description Because the Wolverine is essentially an M1A2 SEP tank with LeguanBridge laying system LEGUAN - KMW bridge-laying gear instead of a turret, it shares virtually all of the parent vehicle's speed, mobility, survivability, and automotive components. This commonality was a key design factor in the Wolverine's development. The Wolverine also features an advanced communications package designed to keep it in contact with local field commanders. However, the vehicle itself is unarmed. The Wolverine is operated by two crewmen who sit within the hull. Both crewmen have access to the bridging controls, while the bridge is carried in two sections, stacked above the hull. Once a bridging site is chosen the vehicle securely anchors itself in place with a spade. The two sections of the bridge are joined together, and then the entire bridge is extended across the obstacle and dropped into place. The crewmen have the ability to make minor corrections during launch, if needed. Once operations are complete, the Wolverine drives across the bridge and retrieves it from the other side simply by reversing the process. The bridge can be launched in under five minutes or retrieved in less than ten minutes, all without the crewmen ever leaving the safety of their vehicle. Once launched, the 26-meter Leguan bridge can support a 70-ton vehicle moving at 16 km/h, or 10 miles per hour. The Wolverine thus allows the heaviest of vehicles to cross craters, ditches, and damaged bridges at combat speed. This mobility is a decisive advantage for armored units. Future plans and replacement To date the United States Army has received 44 Wolverines, which have been distributed to a few select engineer units. The Army had originally intended to purchase 465 vehicles; however, budget cuts and a shift in philosophy toward a lighter fighting force meant that the Army no longer needed hundreds of bridgelaying vehicles. While the Army did not plan to purchase any more Wolverines, it had, at the time, reserved the right to restart production if necessary. However, in 2016 the Wolverine's replacement the Leonardo DRS Joint Assault Bridge (JAB),ASA(ALT) Weapon Systems Handbook 2018 Page 32 lists how this handbook is organized. 440 pages. was chosen, thus effectively ending the Wolverine program. The M1074 Joint Assault Bridge also has an Abrams tank chassis, but is combined with an scissor bridge. While the M104 was intended to replace the AVLB, it was found to be too expensive and complicated to maintain and operate. While the JAB's bridge is shorter, it has a faster deployment time of three minutes, compared to the Wolverine's 3-5 minute set-up time.

During postgraduate studies, he assisted Masatoshi Nakayama in teaching karate to US military personnel. Brazil Following completion of his tertiary studies, Harada took a position with the Bank of South America in S√£o Paulo, Brazil. His manager there, on learning of his new employee's martial art training, asked him to conduct a demonstration; following this, fellow employees and other associates began training under his direction. Initially, the karate training took place in a judo dojo. Harada wrote to Funakoshi to request affiliation with the JKA, but the latter apparently wrote back advising him to start his own karate organisation. This marked the birth of Karate-do Shotokan Brazileo. In 1956, Funakoshi awarded Harada the rank of 5th dan, which was then the highest rank in Shotokan karate.de'Claire, J. (c. 2009).

In April 1957, Egami sent Harada a telegram to inform him that Funakoshi had died. In the period that followed, political troubles saw many of Funakoshi's senior students (including Harada) form the Sh≈çt≈çkai group separate from the JKA. United Kingdom By 1963, Harada had around 16 yudansha (students holding black belt status) at his dojo. At the time, karate students in Paris had heard of him and saved enough money to buy him an airline ticket to their city; Harada resigned from the bank, intending to take a year to travel before returning to Brazil.

During the game, announcer Red Barber states that Loes was the son of Greek immigrants who had changed his last name. Further, says Barber, Loes would not tell Barber what his original last name was because, according to Loes, Barber would be unable to pronounce, spell or remember that name. Loes distinguished himself in several ways in the 1952 World Series.

The Camp Mountain train disaster is still the largest loss of life in a rail accident on the Queensland railway network with 16 fatalities, including both the driver and fireman of the train; 38 were injured. History and background A branch line was opened from the North Coast railway line at Mayne Junction (north of Bowen Hills station) to Enoggera in 1899, to Ferny Grove and Samford in 1918, finally reaching Dayboro on 27 September 1920. By 1908, banana growing in the Samford district had become one of the area's most important industries, and in 1926 and 1927, more bananas were sent from Samford railway station, just down from Camp Mountain, to Sydney and Melbourne than any other station in Queensland. This successful industry existed until the banana bunchy top virus wiped out the crops in the early 1930s. Dairy farming and timber were other industries in the district and out to the end of the line at Dayboro, as well as the quarrying of granite at Camp Mountain, used in the foundations of Brisbane City Hall. Traffic on the Dayboro line by 1947 was light, with three weekly mixed train services, a daily railmotor service, and another on Thursdays and Saturdays. Most suburban passenger services from Brisbane terminated at Mitchelton, with the occasional through service to Ferny Grove. Picnic excursion The train was chartered by the social and recreation club for employees of the Department of Trade and Customs, who were travelling to a picnic venue at Closeburn to celebrate the Labour Day public holiday. The special train, service number E91, consisted of a 4-8-0 C17-class steam locomotive, No. 824, and six wooden suburban passenger carriages, Evans Cars numbered 740, 739, 742, 741, 743 and 744. It was one of a number of chartered trains to travel on the line on the day, conveying groups to numerous picnic locations in the scenic country area north-west of Brisbane. The service departed from Roma Street railway station at 8:50am, then Central railway station in Brisbane at 8:59am. It was estimated that the train carried 215 passengers, most of them Customs employees and their families for a family day out consisting of a picnic lunch with dancing and games of cricket. Incident After receiving authority from Ferny Grove railway station to enter the section of track to Samford, the train slowly climbed the Samford Range. Especially due to the hilly area, the speed limit on the Dayboro line at the time was on straight sections of track, and through curves. As the train descended Camp Mountain Knob, it suddenly picked up speed before the first curve, approximately after crossing the peak of the Samford Range. Carriages rocked dangerously, causing luggage to fall from overhead racks, lighting fixtures rattled, and women and children began screaming. The locomotive left the rails on a left-hand curve with a radius of six chains (approximately ) at an estimated speed of . The locomotive tipped onto its right side and ploughed into an embankment, the coal tender upended, and water tank set free. The first carriage struck the water tank squarely, with the three leading passenger carriages telescoped into the wreckage; all of the front carriage and the two leading compartments of the second were destroyed, while the leading bogie of the third carriage derailed. The force of the accident was significant, causing the total length of the engine, coal tender, water tank and first three carriages to compress from , to . Damage to the trailing three carriages was minimal. Rescuers inspect the wreckage of the Camp Mountain train disaster. The guard of the train, Mr GE Evans, was sitting in the rear carriage, looking out of the left window. The force of the crash threw him into the corner of his compartment. He picked himself up after the train stopped, rushed to the top of the cutting beside the line as a vantage point to see what had happened, then returned to the carriage and applied the handbrake. He deemed that the time of the accident was 9:48am, after looking at his watch displaying 9:50am and allowing two minutes since the time of impact. Evans took the first aid kit from the Guard's compartment and passed it to a passenger towards the front of the train. He then took the breakdown kit, rushed back along the line passed and set three detonators and red flags to warn and stop the expected following train. The train's whistle sounded constantly after the accident, alerting locals of an incident having occurred. The first call to the headquarters of the Queensland Ambulance Service Transport Brigades was received at 10:08am, and in 70 minutes 18 cars and 26 men were on the scene. The fireman of the train, Mr Angus Knight from Grange, was killed instantly from being crushed by the wheels of the engine. The driver, Mr Charles Hind, 50, of Woolloongabba was alive, however pinned across the thighs and knees against the train's boiler in the cabin. Scalded with escaping steam, an ambulance officer gave Hind a syringe of the painkiller morphine, which he injected into himself. Driver Hind was only recently transferred to the Mayne Depot, had not driven trains on the line past Ferny Grove before, and was being tutored by Fireman Knight. A former employee of Queensland Government Railways who was on the following train, Mr Patrick Campbell, spoke to Hind when he was trapped. He asked what had happened, and Hind replied that he did not know the line he was driving on, and therefore would not have been entirely aware of the terrain and conditions. The driver died in hospital the next day. Court inquiry A Court Inquiry was held into the crash, headed by Supreme Court of Queensland Judge, Sir Alan Mansfield, and attended by railway experts, several passengers and local witnesses. The inquiry found that the driver had been rostered to drive a train on a line he had little knowledge of, and was driving the train with excessive speed. In his findings, Judge Mansfield said: The driver was charged with having the foremost accountability for the excessive speed the train was travelling at, with shared blame directed to both the fireman and guard. The cost of compensation for the deaths and injuries from the accident was ¬£23,554. Line closure Memorial cairn to commemorate the Camp Mountain train disaster After the construction of Samford Road over the Samford Range after World War II, traffic on the Dayboro line declined, with a general shift to road transportation. The Dayboro line was closed beyond Ferny Grove in 1955 and the line in the vicinity of the accident site was converted into a sealed rural road, McLean Road South. The accident site is commemorated with a stone cairn and plaque on the northern side of McLean Road South, erected by the Pine Rivers council in 1988. Locomotive No. 824 from the accident was repaired and placed back into service, working around South East Queensland. In 1958 it was transferred to Toowoomba, and withdrawn from service in May 1967, exactly 20 years after the disaster. At that point, as a donation to the Bungil Shire Council, it was towed to the South-Western Queensland town of Injune, approximately north-west of Brisbane, at the end of a branch line from Roma that had recently closed on 1 January 1967. It sits behind the town's ambulance station and a high fence, and is listed in a town map as an \\"historical steam train\\". The locomotive has incorrect numbers and builder's plates, as they were purchased by a railway enthusiast when it was withdrawn from service. At 10:00am on 8 May 1947, memorial services were held at The Cathedral of St Stephen and St John's Cathedral in Brisbane. Seven victims of the disaster rest in five Brisbane cemeteries.

Career =Films= He featured in three of the St Trinian's films, starting as an army major in Blue Murder at St Trinian's. He later appeared as Butters, assistant to Education Ministry senior civil servant Culpepper-Brown (Eric Barker) in The Pure Hell of St Trinian's and played the part of Culpepper-Brown in The Wildcats of St Trinian's. From the 1960s onwards he also appeared in several Hammer horror films, including The Phantom of the Opera (1962), Dracula: Prince of Darkness (1966), Frankenstein Created Woman (1967), Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed (1969) and Vampire Circus (1972). He was a close friend of Hammer's most important director Terence Fisher. Walters played Sherlock Holmes's sidekick Doctor Watson in four unrelated films: Sherlock Holmes and the Deadly Necklace (1962), The Best House in London (1969), The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother (1975) and Silver Blaze (1977). =Television= Walters' television appearances included the Granada series Crown Court, both as a judge and as a barrister. He also appeared as a barrister in the BBC Series A P Herbert's Misleading Cases starring Roy Dotrice as Albert Haddock. Walters also had roles in The Lotus Eaters and Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. Walters was considered for the role of Captain Mainwaring in Dad's Army, before the part was assigned to Arthur Lowe ‚Äì Walters was offered the role by producer David Croft but turned it down. In 1974 he played the Prince of Wales in the TV drama Jennie - Lady Randolph Churchill. Personal life In the DVD commentary to The Man Who Haunted Himself, actor Roger Moore mentioned that co-star Walters lived in Dolphin Square in Pimlico, London in which some scenes of the film were shot. Walters and Richard Hope-Hawkins visited the ailing Terry-Thomas in Barnes, London in 1989. Walters had starred with Thomas in the Boulting Brothers' film Carlton- Browne of the F.O. and was shocked at his appearance (he was ill with Parkinson's disease). That visit resulted in the Terry-Thomas Gala held in the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in the same year which raised funds to help Thomas live the rest of his life in comfort. Hope-Hawkins was with Walters and actress Siobhan Redmond when he died in a London nursing home. Actor Ian Bannen gave the main address at his funeral held at Golders Green.

Dated to about 5400 years ago (approx. 3500 BCE), Watson Brake is considered the oldest earthwork mound complex in North America. It is older than the Egyptian pyramids or England‚Äôs Stonehenge. Its discovery and dating in a paper published in 1997 changed the ideas of American archaeologists about ancient cultures in the Southeast and their ability to manage large, complex projects over centuries. The archeologists revised their date of the oldest earthwork construction by nearly 2000 years, as well as having to recognize that it was developed over centuries by a hunter-gatherer society, rather than by what was known to be more common of other, later mound sites: a more sedentary society dependent on maize cultivation and with a hierarchical, centralized polity. The arrangement of human-made mounds at Watson Brake was constructed over centuries by members of a hunter-gatherer society. It is located near Watson Bayou in the floodplain of the Ouachita River, near present-day Monroe in northern Louisiana, United States. Watson Brake consists of an oval formation of eleven earthwork mounds from three to in height, connected by ridges to form an oval nearly across. Watson Brake is dated to 1,900 years before the better-known Poverty Point in northern Louisiana; begun about 1500 BCE, it was previously thought to be the earliest mound site in North America. Mound building in the Americas started at an early date. The discovery and dating of Watson Brake as a Middle Archaic site demonstrate that the pre-agricultural, pre-ceramic, indigenous cultures within the territory of the present-day United States were much more complex than previously thought. While primarily hunter-gatherers, they planned and organized large work forces over centuries to accomplish the complex mound and ridge constructions. Monumental constructions have marked the rise of social complexity worldwide. The earthen mounds of Eastern North America are linked to mankind's monument tradition. Discovery and dating Schematic plan of the Watson Brake Site In the early 1980s, Reca Bamburg Jones, a local resident, brought this site to the attention of professional archaeologists. By 1981, after logging had revealed more of the site, Jones identified the pattern of eleven mounds connected by ridges, a complex that was 280 yards across. In 1983, Jones and John Belmont published the site in a survey of pre- history in the Ouachita River Valley. Around this time Joe W. Saunders, then regional archaeologist for the state, was shown the site.Lori Tucker, \\"Ouachita River Mounds: A Five Millennium Mystery\\", Louisiana Folklife, 2000, accessed 26 October 2011 The site had been privately controlled since the 1950s. Approximately half the site is still owned by several family members, who have allowed archaeological excavations and associated work, but do not permit public viewing. Recognizing the site's significance, in 1996 The Archaeological Conservancy purchased half the site and later sold it to the state for preservation. Since the 1990s, radiocarbon dating by a team from Northeast Louisiana University established the great antiquity of the site. The team of Joe W. Saunders et al. published a paper in Science in 1997 that established the age of the mound complex.Joe W. Saunders*, Rolfe D. Mandel, Roger T. Saucier, E. Thurman Allen, C. T. Hallmark, Jay K. Johnson, Edwin H. Jackson, Charles M. Allen, Gary L. Stringer, Douglas S. Frink, James K. Feathers, Stephen Williams, Kristen J. Gremillion, Malcolm F. Vidrine, and Reca Jones, \\"A Mound Complex in Louisiana at 5400-5000 Years Before the Present\\", Science, 19 September 1997: Vol. 277 no. 5333, pp. 1796-1799, accessed 27 October 2011 The analysis of 27 radiocarbon dates indicates that the site was initially occupied around 4000 BCE during the Middle Archaic period. Mound construction began at approximately 3500 BCE, and continued for approximately 500 years. During that time period, the mounds were enlarged in several stages. Excavations indicate that there was sufficient time between building episodes for midden deposits of residents to accumulate on top of the mounds and ridges. In addition, teams from the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Washington dated the site by using sand grains and organic acids in the soils.Am√©lie A. Walker, \\"Earliest Mound Site\\", Archaeology Magazine, Volume 51 Number 1, January/February 1998 Evidence of the middens indicate that Watson Brake may have been used as a \\"base by mobile hunter-gatherers from summer through fall.\\" Saunders and his team suggest that the building episodes at Watson Brake coincide with periods of unpredictable rainfall caused by El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation events. They may represent \\"a communal response to new stresses of droughts and flooding that created a suddenly more unpredictable food base.\\" Midden remains showed the population relied on fish, shellfish, and riverine animals, supplemented by local annuals: goosefoot (Chenopodium berlandieri), knotweed (Polygonum spp.), and possibly marshelder (Iva annua). Over time, the people consumed more terrestrial animals, such as deer, turkey, raccoon, opossum, squirrel, and rabbits, which was likely related to changing habitat and waterway conditions. The site appears to have been abandoned around 2800 BCE. This may have been caused by a \\"decline in the main channel, gravel/sand shoal habitats, backwater swamps, and small-stream habitats\\" near the site. Together with other Middle Archaic sites in Louisiana and Florida, Watson Brake shows the development of complex societies among hunter-gatherer peoples. They occupied the site only on a seasonal basis, but were capable of planning and organizing complex monumental construction over a period of several hundred years. In contrast to Poverty Point, where residents made projectile points with materials traded from distant locations, including Wisconsin and Tennessee, the artifacts of Watson Brake show local materials and production. The projectile points are Middle to Late Archaic in age, and were produced more casually than those at Poverty Point. The people heated local gravel for cooking stones to steam some of their food. They created and fired earthenware items in a variety of shapes, but researchers have not yet determined their functions. Ownership and management Eight members of the Gentry family have owned most of the site since the 1950s. One member declines to sell property to the state, so the site is not available for public viewing. The family have granted specific permission to individual archaeologists to conduct research on site.Robert \\"Rob\\" Redding Jr., \\"Why the Public May Never See Watson Brake\\", Redding News Review, 3 May 2009, accessed 26 Oct 2009 See also * Marsden Mounds * Poverty Point References External links * Amelie Walker, \\"Earliest Mound Site\\", NewsBrief, Archeology', Volume 51 Number 1, January/February 1998 * \\"Man-made mounds said oldest in North America\\", 'The Japan Times, September 20, 1997 * \\"A Mound Complex in Louisiana at 5400-5000 Years Before the Present\\", Science, 19 September 1997 * OCR Carbon Dating of the Watson Brake Mound Complex PDF * Ancient Earthworks of Eastern North America Category:Mounds in Louisiana Category:Archaic period in North America Category:Geography of Ouachita Parish, Louisiana Category:4th- millennium BC establishments ","title":"Watson Brake"},{"id":"2091823","text":"In mathematics, a stiff equation is a differential equation for which certain numerical methods for solving the equation are numerically unstable, unless the step size is taken to be extremely small. It has proven difficult to formulate a precise definition of stiffness, but the main idea is that the equation includes some terms that can lead to rapid variation in the solution. When integrating a differential equation numerically, one would expect the requisite step size to be relatively small in a region where the solution curve displays much variation and to be relatively large where the solution curve straightens out to approach a line with slope nearly zero. For some problems this is not the case. In order for a numerical method to give a reliable solution to the differential system sometimes the step size is required to be at an unacceptably small level in a region where the solution curve is very smooth. The phenomenon is known as stiffness. In some cases there may be two different problems with the same solution, yet one is not stiff and the other is. The phenomenon cannot therefore be a property of the exact solution, since this is the same for both problems, and must be a property of the differential system itself. Such systems are thus known as stiff systems.  Motivating example  Explicit numerical methods exhibiting instability when integrating a stiff ordinary differential equation Consider the initial value problem The exact solution (shown in cyan) is We seek a numerical solution that exhibits the same behavior. The figure (right) illustrates the numerical issues for various numerical integrators applied on the equation. One of the most prominent examples of the stiff Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is a system that describes the chemical reaction of Robertson: If one treats this system on a short interval, for example, t \\\\in [0, 40] there is no problem in numerical integration. However, if the interval is very large (1011 say), then many standard codes fail to integrate it correctly. Additional examples are the sets of ODEs resulting from the temporal integration of large chemical reaction mechanisms. Here, the stiffness arises from the coexistence of very slow and very fast reactions. To solve them, the software packages KPP and Autochem can be used.  Stiffness ratio  Consider the linear constant coefficient inhomogeneous system where \\\\mathbf y, \\\\mathbf f \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^n and \\\\mathbf A is a constant, diagonalizable, n \\\\times n matrix with eigenvalues \\\\lambda_t \\\\in \\\\mathbb{C}, t = 1, 2, \\\\ldots , n (assumed distinct) and corresponding eigenvectors \\\\mathbf c_t \\\\in \\\\mathbb{C}^n, t = 1, 2, \\\\ldots , n . The general solution of () takes the form where the Œ∫t are arbitrary constants and \\\\mathbf g(x) is a particular integral. Now let us suppose that which implies that each of the terms \\\\exp ( \\\\lambda_t x ) \\\\mathbf c_t \\\\rightarrow 0 as x \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty , so that the solution \\\\mathbf y(x) approaches \\\\mathbf g(x) asymptotically as x \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty ; the term \\\\exp ( \\\\lambda_t x ) \\\\mathbf c_t will decay monotonically if Œªt is real and sinusoidally if Œªt is complex. Interpreting x to be time (as it often is in physical problems), \\\\Sigma_{t=1}^n \\\\kappa_t \\\\exp ( \\\\lambda_t x ) \\\\mathbf c_t is called the transient solution and \\\\mathbf g(x) the steady-state solution. If Re(\\\\lambda_t) is large, then the corresponding term \\\\kappa_t \\\\exp ( \\\\lambda_t x ) \\\\mathbf c_t will decay quickly as x increases and is thus called a fast transient; if  Re(\\\\lambda_t)  is small, the corresponding term \\\\kappa_t \\\\exp ( \\\\lambda_t x ) \\\\mathbf c_t decays slowly and is called a slow transient. Let \\\\overline{\\\\lambda}, \\\\underline{\\\\lambda} \\\\in \\\\\\\\{ \\\\lambda_t, t = 1, 2, \\\\ldots , n \\\\\\\\} be defined by so that \\\\kappa_t \\\\exp ( \\\\overline{\\\\lambda} x ) \\\\mathbf c_t is the fastest transient and \\\\kappa_t \\\\exp ( \\\\underline{\\\\lambda} x ) \\\\mathbf c_t the slowest. We now define the stiffness ratio as  Characterization of stiffness  In this section we consider various aspects of the phenomenon of stiffness. \\"Phenomenon\\" is probably a more appropriate word than \\"property\\", since the latter rather implies that stiffness can be defined in precise mathematical terms; it turns out not to be possible to do this in a satisfactory manner, even for the restricted class of linear constant coefficient systems. We shall also see several qualitative statements that can be (and mostly have been) made in an attempt to encapsulate the notion of stiffness, and state what is probably the most satisfactory of these as a \\"definition\\" of stiffness. J. D. Lambert defines stiffness as follows: > If a numerical method with a finite region of absolute stability, applied to > a system with any initial conditions, is forced to use in a certain interval > of integration a step length which is excessively small in relation to the > smoothness of the exact solution in that interval, then the system is said > to be stiff in that interval. There are other characteristics which are exhibited by many examples of stiff problems, but for each there are counterexamples, so these characteristics do not make good definitions of stiffness. Nonetheless, definitions based upon these characteristics are in common use by some authors and are good clues as to the presence of stiffness. Lambert refers to these as \\"statements\\" rather than definitions, for the aforementioned reasons. A few of these are: # A linear constant coefficient system is stiff if all of its eigenvalues have negative real part and the stiffness ratio is large. # Stiffness occurs when stability requirements, rather than those of accuracy, constrain the step length. # Stiffness occurs when some components of the solution decay much more rapidly than others.  Etymology  The origin of the term \\"stiffness\\" has not been clearly established. According to Joseph Oakland Hirschfelder, the term \\"stiff\\" is used because such systems correspond to tight coupling between the driver and driven in servomechanisms. According to Richard. L. Burden and J. Douglas Faires, > Significant difficulties can occur when standard numerical techniques are > applied to approximate the solution of a differential equation when the > exact solution contains terms of the form eŒªt, where Œª is a complex number > with negative real part. ... Problems involving rapidly decaying transient > solutions occur naturally in a wide variety of applications, including the > study of spring and damping systems, the analysis of control systems, and > problems in chemical kinetics. These are all examples of a class of problems > called stiff (mathematical stiffness) systems of differential equations, due > to their application in analyzing the motion of spring and mass systems > having large spring constants (physical stiffness). For example, the initial value problem with m = 1, c = 1001, k = 1000, can be written in the form () with n = 2 and and has eigenvalues \\\\overline{\\\\lambda} = -1000, \\\\underline{\\\\lambda} = -1 . Both eigenvalues have negative real part and the stiffness ratio is which is fairly large. System () then certainly satisfies statements 1 and 3. Here the spring constant k is large and the damping constant c is even larger. (Note that \\"large\\" is a vague, subjective term, but the larger the above quantities are, the more pronounced will be the effect of stiffness.) The exact solution to () is Note that () behaves quite nearly as a simple exponential x0e‚àít, but the presence of the e‚àí1000t term, even with a small coefficient is enough to make the numerical computation very sensitive to step size. Stable integration of () requires a very small step size until well into the smooth part of the solution curve, resulting in an error much smaller than required for accuracy. Thus the system also satisfies statement 2 and Lambert's definition.  A-stability  The behaviour of numerical methods on stiff problems can be analyzed by applying these methods to the test equation subject to the initial condition with k \\\\in \\\\mathbb{C}. The solution of this equation is . This solution approaches zero as t\\\\to\\\\infty when \\\\mathrm{Re} \\\\, (k) < 0. If the numerical method also exhibits this behaviour (for a fixed step size), then the method is said to be A-stable.This definition is due to . (Note that a numerical method that is L-stable (see below) has the stronger property that the solution approaches zero in a single step as the step size goes to infinity.) A-stable methods do not exhibit the instability problems as described in the motivating example.  Runge‚ÄìKutta methods  Runge‚ÄìKutta methods applied to the test equation y' = k\\\\cdot y take the form y_{n+1} = \\\\phi(hk)\\\\cdot y_n, and, by induction, y_n = \\\\left(\\\\phi(hk)\\\\right)^n\\\\cdot y_0. The function \\\\phi is called the stability function. Thus, the condition that y_n \\\\to 0 as n \\\\to \\\\infty is equivalent to \\\\phi(hk) < 1. This motivates the definition of the region of absolute stability (sometimes referred to simply as stability region), which is the set \\\\\\\\{z \\\\in \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\,\\\\phi(z)< 1 \\\\\\\\}. The method is A-stable if the region of absolute stability contains the set \\\\\\\\{ z \\\\in \\\\Complex  \\\\mathrm{Re}(z) < 0 \\\\\\\\}, that is, the left half plane. = Example: The Euler methods = The pink disk shows the stability region for the Euler method. Consider the Euler methods above. The explicit Euler method applied to the test equation y' = k\\\\cdot y is : y_{n+1} = y_n + h\\\\cdot f(t_n, y_n) = y_n + h\\\\cdot(ky_n) = y_n + h\\\\cdot k\\\\cdot y_n = (1+h\\\\cdot k)y_n. Hence, y_n = (1 + hk)^n\\\\cdot y_0 with \\\\phi(z) = 1 + z. The region of absolute stability for this method is thus \\\\\\\\{ z \\\\in \\\\mathbb{C}  1+z < 1 \\\\\\\\} which is the disk depicted on the right. The Euler method is not A-stable. The motivating example had k = -15. The value of z when taking step size h = 1/4 is z = -15*1/4 = -3.75, which is outside the stability region. Indeed, the numerical results do not converge to zero. However, with step size h = 1/8, we have z = -1.875 which is just inside the stability region and the numerical results converge to zero, albeit rather slowly. = Example: Trapezoidal method = The pink region is the stability region for the trapezoidal method. Consider the trapezoidal method : y_{n+1} = y_n + \\\\tfrac{1}{2}h\\\\cdot \\\\left(f(t_n,y_n)+f(t_{n+1},y_{n+1})\\\\right), when applied to the test equation y' = k\\\\cdot y, is : y_{n+1} = y_n + \\\\tfrac{1}{2}h\\\\cdot \\\\left(ky_n+ky_{n+1}\\\\right). Solving for y_{n+1} yields :y_{n+1}=\\\\frac{1+\\\\frac{1}{2}hk}{1-\\\\frac{1}{2}hk}\\\\cdot y_n. Thus, the stability function is :\\\\phi(z)={1+{1\\\\over 2}z \\\\over 1-{1\\\\over 2}z} and the region of absolute stability is :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ z \\\\in \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\left\\\\ \\\\left {1+{1\\\\over 2}z \\\\over 1-{1\\\\over 2}z} \\\\right < 1 \\\\right.\\\\right\\\\\\\\}. This region contains the left-half plane, so the trapezoidal method is A-stable. In fact, the stability region is identical to the left-half plane, and thus the numerical solution of y' = k\\\\cdot y converges to zero if and only if the exact solution does. Nevertheless, the trapezoidal method does not have perfect behavior: it does damp all decaying components, but rapidly decaying components are damped only very mildly, because \\\\phi(z) \\\\to 1 as z \\\\to -\\\\infty . This led to the concept of L-stability: a method is L-stable if it is A-stable and \\\\phi(z) \\\\to 0 as z \\\\to \\\\infty . The trapezoidal method is A-stable but not L-stable. The implicit Euler method is an example of an L-stable method.The definition of L-stability is due to . = General theory = The stability function of a Runge‚ÄìKutta method with coefficients A and b is given by : \\\\phi(z) = \\\\frac{\\\\det(I-zA+zeb^T)}{\\\\det(I-zA)}, where e denotes the vector with ones. This is a rational function (one polynomial divided by another). Explicit Runge‚ÄìKutta methods have a strictly lower triangular coefficient matrix A and thus, their stability function is a polynomial. It follows that explicit Runge‚ÄìKutta methods cannot be A-stable. The stability function of implicit Runge‚ÄìKutta methods is often analyzed using order stars. The order star for a method with stability function \\\\phi is defined to be the set \\\\\\\\{ z \\\\in \\\\Complex  \\\\phi(z) > \\\\mathrm{e}^z \\\\\\\\}. A method is A-stable if and only if its stability function has no poles in the left-hand plane and its order star contains no purely imaginary numbers.The definition is due to ; see also .  Multistep methods  Linear multistep methods have the form :y_{n+1}=\\\\sum_{i=0}^s a_i y_{n-i}+h\\\\sum_{j=-1}^s b_j f(t_{n-j},y_{n-j}). Applied to the test equation, they become :y_{n+1}=\\\\sum_{i=0}^s a_i y_{n-i}+hk\\\\sum_{j=-1}^s b_jy_{n-j}, which can be simplified to :(1-b_{-1}z)y_{n+1}-\\\\sum_{j=0}^s (a_j+b_jz)y_{n-j}=0 where z = hk. This is a linear recurrence relation. The method is A-stable if all solutions {yn} of the recurrence relation converge to zero when Re z < 0\\\\. The characteristic polynomial is :\\\\Phi(z, w) = w^{s+1}-\\\\sum_{i=0}^s a_iw^{s-i} - z\\\\sum_{j=-1}^s b_jw^{s-j}. All solutions converge to zero for a given value of z if all solutions w of Œ¶(z,w) = 0 lie in the unit circle. The region of absolute stability for a multistep method of the above form is then the set of all z \\\\in \\\\mathbb{C} for which all w such that Œ¶(z,w) = 0 satisfy w < 1\\\\. Again, if this set contains the left-half plane, the multi-step method is said to be A-stable. = Example: The second-order Adams‚ÄìBashforth method = The pink region is the stability region for the second-order Adams‚ÄìBashforth method. Let us determine the region of absolute stability for the two-step Adams‚ÄìBashforth method : y_{n+1} = y_n + h \\\\left( \\\\tfrac32 f(t_n, y_n) - \\\\tfrac12 f(t_{n-1}, y_{n-1}) \\\\right) . The characteristic polynomial is : \\\\Phi(w,z) = w^2 - (1+\\\\tfrac32z)w + \\\\tfrac12 z = 0 which has roots : w = \\\\tfrac12 \\\\Big(1 + \\\\tfrac32 z \\\\pm\\\\sqrt{1 + z + \\\\tfrac94 z^2}\\\\Big), thus the region of absolute stability is : \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ z \\\\in \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\left \\\\ \\\\left \\\\tfrac12 \\\\Big(1 + \\\\tfrac32 z \\\\pm\\\\sqrt{1 + z + \\\\tfrac94 z^2}\\\\Big) \\\\right < 1 \\\\right.\\\\right\\\\\\\\}. This region is shown on the right. It does not include all the left half-plane (in fact it only includes the real axis between z = ‚àí1 and z = 0) so the Adams‚ÄìBashforth method is not A-stable. = General theory = Explicit multistep methods can never be A-stable, just like explicit Runge‚ÄìKutta methods. Implicit multistep methods can only be A-stable if their order is at most 2. The latter result is known as the second Dahlquist barrier; it restricts the usefulness of linear multistep methods for stiff equations. An example of a second-order A-stable method is the trapezoidal rule mentioned above, which can also be considered as a linear multistep method.See .

It is served by the main line Ashwell and Morden railway station to the south in the neighbouring parish of Steeple Morden. The parish is combined with the parishes of Abington Pigotts, Guilden Morden and Tadlow to form \\"The Mordens\\" ward, which is represented on South Cambridgeshire District Council by one councillor. History =Parish= The parish of Guilden Morden is long and thin in shape covering an area of in the very south-western corner of Cambridgeshire. The parish's long western border largely follows the course of the River Cam from the point where it rises at Ruddery Spring, and which separates it from Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire. At its southern tip the parish meets the ancient Icknield Way (now the A505). Most of its long eastern border follows a stream that divides it from neighbouring Steeple Morden, and reaches its short northern border with Tadlow at Tadlow Bridge. The area has been occupied for at least 2000 years and probably much longer; an axehead dating from 6000 BC has been found in the parish. A significant cemetery dating from Roman times has also been found in the south of the parish, containing at least 180 burials and indicating an important nearby settlement. The Guilden Morden boar, an Anglo-Saxon copper alloy figure of a boar that may have once served as the crest of a helmet, was found around 1864 or 1865 in a grave. The Saxon village was probably built after that of its neighbour Steeple Morden from which it has been separate since at least the Norman Conquest. The hamlet of Odsey on the Baldock to Royston road was formerly home to a Cistercian grange. A hamlet named Redreth was listed until the 14th century, probably south of the village and perhaps deserted as a result of the Black Death. The name is derived from the Old English Gylden More Dun, meaning \\"Golden\\" (rich or productive) \\"Moor Hill\\".Guilden Morden, English Place-Name Society database at the University of Nottingham =Manor= The manor here belonged for several centuries to the Hasilden family. Thomas Hasilden (c.1322-1401) had a Royal grant of free warren in his manors of Steeple and Guilden Morden in 1374. He was then resident at Morden Hall, an ancient mansion. He was Comptroller of the household of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, and was retained for life to served him in peace or in war. He also held the manor of Soham in Cambridgeshire from the Duke as superior. In July 1381 he was commanded to meet the Duke at Berwick-upon-Tweed with seventy men- at-arms and sixty lances from his estates. He was a Knight of the Shire for Cambridgeshire in 1384 and also served in four other Parliaments. The manor continued in this family until Francis Hasilden, High Sheriff of Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire in 1509 (died early in 1522) settled his estates on his only child Frances who conveyed them by her marriage to Sir Robert Peyton, knt., of Iselham.Waters, Robert E C, B.A., Barrister of the Inner Temple, Genealogical Memoirs of the Extinct Family of Chester of Chicheley & c., London, 1878, vol. 1, and 216-7. Church St Mary's Church The parish church of Guilden Morden has been dedicated to St Mary since at least the 15th century. The oldest parts of the nave date back to the 13th century, with the majority of the building added in the 14th century. The present building consists of a chancel, aisled and clerestoried nave with south porch, and a west tower with a short spire. The tower dates from the 15th century, and the present spire replaced an older one in 1972. The basin of the font is 12th century. In 1522 Francis Hasilden, Lord of the Manor of Guilden Morden, was buried in the north aisle \\"before Jesus's Altar\\" in a tomb which cost his estate ¬£20 sterling.Waters, 1878, p.216. Village life In the village there is one open pub the King Edward VII. There is a second pub, named the Three Tuns, which was open by 1851 and closed in 2013; it is currently (2018) the subject of a campaign in the village seeking to purchase and reopen it. Next to the King Edward there is a small village shop, which is now closed. The Six Bells pub, which opened next to the church before 1801, closed some time in the 1960s or 70s, and The Black Swan opened on Swan Lane in the late 19th century and closed in the 20th century. The village's other former pubs are The Pear Tree (47 New Road), The Chestnuts, The Pig and Whistle (63 High Street), The Fox, and The Black Horse (Potton Road). Guilden Morden Primary School, founded in 1847, opened on its current site in 1974. The school has around 120 children from reception to year 6. The children then go on to Bassingbourn Village College in most cases. In addition the village has a pre-school.Guilden Morden Primary School A fete is held each September on the recreation ground in aid of the village hall.

She was regularly cast in films produced by the Hammer studio. Early life The daughter of David Farmer, a trader in metals, and Eleanor (nƒóe Best), she was born in Maidstone, Kent, although the family later moved to Bray in Berkshire, near the location of Bray Studios, later used by Hammer. Her younger brother is the city financier Michael Farmer, now a Conservative life peer. Both of their parents were alcoholics, as her brother related in his maiden speech in the House of Lords in 2014, and the two children \\"experienced the poverty, neglect and shame that are such potent drivers of social exclusion\\". David Farmer's company was liquidated and he died before his elder child was seven. Suzan Farmer trained at the Central School of Speech and Drama. Career Suzan Farmer had lead roles in several Hammer swashbuckling and horror films of the 1960s. The first of these was The Scarlet Blade (US: The Crimson Blade, 1963), an English Civil War tale with Lionel Jeffries and Oliver Reed, while The Devil-Ship Pirates (1964), concerned a ship allied with the Spanish Armada and was the first of her three films with Christopher Lee in the lead. Dracula, Prince of Darkness (1966) and Rasputin, the Mad Monk (1966) were made back-to back using the same sets and an overlapping cast. In the Dracula film, she was targeted by Lee's vampire, but fought him off sending him to a cold, watery end assisted by Francis Matthews, who played her husband, and also her brother in Rasputin. Another of her horror film roles, this time for a company other than Hammer, was as support in Die, Monster, Die! (aka, Monster of Terror, 1965), starring Boris Karloff as her character's father, but she found Karloff himself rather distant. The thriller Persecution (1974), with Ralph Bates as her husband, was a failure both critically and at the box-office. Other films include the war drama 633 Squadron (1964) as an RAF driver, plus the comedy Doctor in Clover. A regular performer in British television series, Farmer appeared in an episode of the Patrick McGoohan series Danger Man (\\"No Marks for Servility\\", 1964) and also featured in other ITC series in the 1960s and 70s, including UFO (\\"Survival\\", 1971), Man in a Suitcase, The Persuaders!, and in four episodes of The Saint playing four different characters. She appeared in a BBC television adaptation of Dostoyevsky's The Idiot (1966) and played Sally Carstairs in their version of Edmund Crispin's detective novel The Moving Toyshop (1964). Other television appearances were in the 1968 series The Caesars (1968), an episode of the BBC science fiction anthology series Out of the Unknown (1969), an episode of the ATV series Thriller (\\"Death in Deep Water\\", 1975) and in the BBC's science fiction series Blake's 7 (\\"Deliverance\\", 1978). For a month in 1978, Farmer was a cast member of Coronation Street playing a divorced chiropodist who treated Albert Tatlock, who briefly went out with Ken Barlow's girlfriends. On stage, she was a founding member of John Fraser's London Shakespeare Group, playing Olivia in a production of Twelfth Night which opened in Beijing, China and had a residency at the Donmar Warehouse in 1982. The group toured West Africa performing extracts from the plays for 60,000 children. Personal life and death Farmer was married to the actor Ian McShane from 1965 to 1968. Her acting career had ended by the mid-1980s, and she later became reclusive and suffered from depression and alcoholism. Farmer died on 17 September 2017, aged 75, of cancer.

As the Prince Rong peerage was not awarded \\"iron-cap\\" status, this meant that each successive bearer of the title would normally start off with a title downgraded by one rank vis-√†-vis that held by his predecessor. However, the title would generally not be downgraded to any lower than a feng'en fuguo gong except under special circumstances. The first bearer of the title was Yongqi (1741‚Äì1766), the fifth son of the Qianlong Emperor. In 1765, he was awarded the status of a qinwang (prince of the first rank) by his father under the title \\"Prince Rong of the First Rank\\".

The labouring-class poet Robert Bloomfield (the shoemaker poet) died in Shefford after his publishers went bankrupt and Bloomfield was forced to move from London into a cottage rented to him by a friend. In Shefford one of his daughters died in 1814 and his wife became insane. In order to support himself he tried to carry on business as a bookseller but failed, and in his later years was reduced to making Aeolian harps which he sold among his friends.Chamber‚Äôs Cyclopaedia of English Literature, Edinburgh, 1844, vol.2, pp.283-4, at Google Books, With failing eyesight, his own reason threatened by depression, he died in great poverty in the town in 1823. He was buried at Campton, as was usual for those dying in Shefford. Between 1868 and 1974 Shefford was the site of St Francis' Boy's Home (orphanage) that was situated on High Street next to the Roman Catholic Church dedicated to St Francis of Assisi. The church remains in use as a place of worship. The orphanage buildings, which are seen on the right of the picture, have been turned into flats. The orphanage buildings are the most imposing in the town and date from the 1880s. Many files regarding the home can be found at the Bedfordshire and Luton Archives and Records Service at Borough Hall in Bedford. There are Home Office and Department for Education Inspection Reports available that cover the period from 1962 to 1969. During World War II an entire Jewish children's community came into being in Shefford as 500 pupils from Judith Grunfeld's school were billeted in and around the town. The school was moved in 1939 and remained in Shefford until 1945. This was part of \\"Operation Pied Piper\\" where schools were moved in anticipation of wartime bombing. A book was written about this time, titled \\"Shefford: The Story of a Jewish School Community in Evacuation, 1939-1945\\", telling the story of the evacuated school. Geography The River Flit and the River Hit run through the town. The Flit runs from Flitwick and joins the River Ivel on the edge of Shefford. The Ivel eventually joins the River Great Ouse just north of Sandy. The name Shefford is derived from sheep-ford because there had been a sheep market and ford crossings over the two rivers that run through the town. Shefford Hardwick was a hamlet located west of the parish, north of Ampthill Road. The rural settlement became a civil parish in its own right in 1858, but was merged into the parish of Shefford in 1933 as the farmstead expanded. Facilities Shefford incorporates a fire station, bowls club, sports club, a Memorial Hall, a Community Hall, many pubs and a brewery.

It is named after the Byzantine Christian theologians and missionaries Cyril and Methodius. As of 2018‚Äì19 school year, a total of 25,220 students are enrolled at the university. Furthermore, the teaching and research staff number 2,390 people; this is further supported by over 300 members in the university's institutions. The primary language of instruction is Macedonian, but there are a number of courses which are carried out in English, German, French, Italian and minority languages. History During the Bulgarian administration of Vardar Banovina (1941‚Äì1944) the new authorities established in 1943, in Skopje, Macedonia's first institute of higher education ‚Äì the Tsar Boris III University. Due to the withdrawal of the Bulgarian administration in the Autumn of 1944, the University stopped its educational activity. However, after the establishment of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia, on the third session of the Presidium of the Antifascist Council of the National Liberation of Macedonia, held in April 1945, one of the items on the agenda was the question of opening a Macedonian university to replace the Bulgarian one. At the end of 1946, the concept of a university began to be realized and the official opening ceremony for the Faculty of Philosophy, the cornerstone of the University of Skopje, took place on 29 November of that year. This marked the beginning of a Macedonian state university. The first faculty consisted of the Department of History and Philology and the Department of Mathematics and Natural Science, while the Medical Faculty and the Faculty of Agriculture and Forestry were added in 1947. Fifty-eight students enrolled during the first academic year of 1946‚Äì1947; in the next year this number grew to 907. The development of higher education in Macedonia was characterized by rapid growth, and several other faculties were added in the following years. Parallel to the education activities in the existing faculties, scholarly research was undertaken with the development of independent institutes of research. Thus, the Institute of National History was founded in 1948, followed by Institute of Folklore in 1949, and the Institute of Economics in 1952. Today, there are 10 research institutes affiliated with the University of Skopje. After the great 1963 Skopje earthquake, which destroyed most of the city of Skopje, the university was leveled and some of the most modern laboratories in Yugoslavia were destroyed. By this time the University of Skopje was the third largest in Yugoslavia. It was quickly rebuilt on the premises of a much larger and modern urban campus. At the request of Yugoslav authorities, scientists from UNESCO's Department of Natural Sciences were sent to meet with the university's scientists to develop plans for the rehabilitation of the university's science laboratories. As a result, a large donation of equipment for science teaching and research was gathered from around the world through UNESCO's international programme of aid to Skopje. At present, the University of Skopje is carried out in the spirit of the 1991 Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia, which incorporated the social, economic and political changes that had taken place after Macedonia proclaimed its independence from the Former Yugoslav Federate State. On 3 August 2000 the Parliament of the Republic of Macedonia brought the new Law on Higher Education which adopted the overall European standards of higher education. The management organs of the university are the University Senate, consisting of two staff members from each faculty and scientific research institutes, five appointed members by the government of the Republic of North Macedonia and five students delegated from the Student Organization; the University Board, consisting of the rector, the vice- rectors, the secretary general, the deans of the faculties, the directors of the scientific-research institutes and one student representative; and the rector.

In 2006 it was bought by Bayer AG and merged to form the Bayer subsidiary Bayer Schering Pharma AG, which was renamed Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals in 2011. Schering was listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and had 26,000 employees as of 2004. The American pharmaceutical company Schering-Plough, formerly the Schering Corporation, was originally the US subsidiary of Schering AG, and merged with Merck & Co. in 2009. History In 1851, Ernst Christian Friedrich Schering opened the Gr√ºne Apotheke (Green Pharmacy) in Berlin's Chausseestra√üe, and in 1871 converted into the name Chemische Fabrik auf Actien (formerly E. Schering). This date is the company's date of incorporation. The company grew strongly in the following years. In 1913, the company employed 935 workers, 112 master craftsman and 180 office employees. In addition to the Berlin site, two factories were also located in Russia (Moscow and Wydriza) with over 1,000 workers and a plant in Great Britain. Turnover at the time was about 10 million German gold mark, created with the production of photochemicals and pharmaceuticals. Important products produced were salicylic acid, the antigout preparation atophan, various sleeping and disinfecting agents. At the beginning of the 1920s, Schering took over the wash and colouring company located in the Berlin district K√∂penick. In 1922, the management acquired the majority of shares in the chemical factory Chemischen Fabrik auf Actien (formerly E. Schering) from the Upper Silesian . In 1937, the companies Kokswerke und Chemische Fabriken AG and the Chemischen Fabrik auf Actien amalgamated with the sister company Schering-Kahlbaum AG and, on the same day, renamed on account of the internationally respected name Schering to Schering Aktiengesellschaft. The pharmaceutical business thus became part of a mining and chemical group, which also produced radiographic products and pesticide products. Schering was the manufacturer of Primodos. = Bayer takeover 2006 = In March 2006, Merck KGaA announced a ‚Ç¨14.6bn bid for Schering, which by 2006 had annual gross revenue of around ‚Ç¨5 billionSchering AG press release.

It stands almost above sea level on the edge of a limestone plateau above the valley of the River Wye, above an ancient meander of the river. To the west, Cinder Hill drops off sharply into the valley. It is sheltered behind the crumbling walls of the 12th century St Briavels Castle. History Little is known about the origin of St Briavels. The name is thought to be from a much-travelled early Christian missionary, Brioc, whose name also appears in places as far afield as Cornwall and Brittany. Later King Offa of Mercia built Offa's Dyke from the mouth of the River Wye near Chepstow to Prestatyn and local remains can still be seen in the nearby Hudnalls Wood. The Normans thought it an ideal site for one of the many castles built from Chepstow to Chester to check the intrusion of the warlike Welsh tribesmen from the Welsh Kingdom of Gwent into the more peaceful areas east of the Severn and Wye rivers. At Windward, the highest point in the parish, the land rises to above sea level; St Briavels Castle itself is somewhat lower at and nestles into the hillsides, with a commanding view of the Wye Valley between Tintern and Redbrook. The castle and St Mary's Parish Church, built in 1089, must have been the site of a considerable community, for the castle was the home of the Constable of the Forest of Dean, a region stretching northwards and eastwards toward the city of Gloucester. Cut off from the rest of England by the tidal Severn River to the east and the treacherous tidal Wye to the west, the Forest was in many ways more isolated than most other parts of the country. As a result, this area produced a culture, language and way of living peculiarly its own. The Forest is full of ancient customs and traditions. Between the 11th century and 13th centuries the shire counties were split into hundreds. The hundred of St Briavels is the largest in the Forest of Dean and its boundaries approximate to the Forest boundaries. The village was garrisoned by Miles of Gloucester for King Henry I as early as 1130. The castle was later granted to him with the Forest of Dean in July 1141 when he was made Earl of Hereford. In 1155 the castle and the Forest of Dean were held by the Crown after the revolt of Roger Fitzmiles, 2nd Earl of Hereford. It then remained as a Crown possession for the rest of the Middle Ages. The castle has been a hunting lodge of King John of England, and was also visited by Henry II, who made the castle the administrative and judicial centre for the Forest of Dean. Between 1876 and 1959, while industry was booming in the Forest of Dean, St Briavels was served by the Wye Valley Railway, and St Briavels Station was situated a mile away near Bigsweir bridge. =Freemining= Coal mining, iron ore extraction, stone quarrying and forestry with Verderers have all been important primary sources of income in the Forest of Dean. In the Middle Ages, local miners were highly valued for their digging skills during military campaigns. It is said that, after a particularly successful job undermining the foundations of Berwick Castle at Berwick-on-Tweed, King Edward I granted 'Free-Mining' status to all Forest of Dean coal and ore miners. This authority gave Freeminers the right to dig for minerals anywhere in the Forest of Dean except beneath churchyards, orchards and gardens. To be a Freeminer, an individual has to be \\"born and abiding within the 'Hundred of St Briavels', of the age of 21 and upwards who shall have worked for a year and a day in a coal or iron ore mine or stone quarry within the Hundred\\". In the late middle ages and early modern period open cast stone mining was prevalent in the woods to the west of the village. Many millstones used in the mills and cider presses of the time were quarried in the Hudnalls and rolled down the hillside to be transported away by barges on the River Wye. Between the 16th century and 18th century timber from the Forest was heavily relied upon for the construction of ships - and almost became exhausted, supplying to the demands of Drake, Raleigh and Nelson. A Forester, is a resident natural of the Forest of Dean, born within the ancient administrative area of the Hundred of St Briavels. There are still several traditional Forester families living and working in the area keeping the ancient traditions and rights alive. Freemining, free roaming sheep grazed on common land, and grazing of pigs in the Forest, are rights and responsibilities extended to the people of St Briavels that are still exercised today, although more so elsewhere in the Forest of Dean. Other peculiarities to the area include the ancient right for 'sheep badgers' to let their flocks roam freely and pigs were also allowed to forage freely in the Forest. Firewood was also allowed to be gathered from the local Hudnalls wood.  Amenities and village life St Mary's Church, St Briavels The village has one pub - The George, a junior school, a church, two chapels and a doctors' surgery. It also has a well regarded village shop and delicatessen called The Pantry operating from a small building opposite The George. The Congregational church, dating from the 1870s, has Gothic Revival architecture. Village life today is centred on the school, church, the Pavilions, Assembly Rooms, The George and the Pantry. The Assembly Rooms has a hall with a stage for entertainment and special events for the local close knit community. It also has a small office for hire with Internet and telephone options. Today the Pavilions hold a very popular and well established monthly 'Local Produce and Suppliers Market', a local farmers' market offering a fine selection of organic vegetables, rare breed pedigree pork, award-winning local cheeses, cider, wine, honey and a range of delicacies. The St Briavels Assembly Rooms are used by the community for classes, playgroups and various events. A recent grant from DEFRA of ¬£94,000 is currently being spent on updating the Rooms for increased usage. The general character of the village is typified by a mid 19th century core, complemented to the east by a large number of houses built during the 1970s. Although many residents now no longer work in the area the village retains a relatively vibrant community. The St Briavels Bread and Cheese Dole tradition is said to date back to the time of Miles de Gloucester, 1st Earl of Hereford (then lord of the Forest of Dean) in the 12th century. Each year on Whit Sunday bread and cheese is thrown from the wall of the castle to local 'Dole Claimers' dressed in medieval costume. 'Dole claimers' could be anyone who paid a penny to the incumbent Earl of Hereford entitling them to gather firewood from the nearby Hudnalls wood. Some believe in the power of these edible morsels and preserve them for good luck (miners originally used them as charms to protect against accidents underground). Today some people choose to place them in matchboxes and rest them under their pillow to inspire dreams of the future. An annual summer f√™te, known as 'The Carnival', attracts large crowds and is usually held on the second Saturday afternoon in June. Five carnival floats gather and fancy dress contestants congregate around the village green. The floats include St Briavels School, St Briavels Infants, St Briavels Juniors, St Briavels Playgroup and the Carnival Queen Float. The floats then process through the village, finally parking at the bottom of the recreation ground. A community group called 'Heartbeat St. Briavels' has been set up to provide and maintain defibrillators throughout the village. Cinderhill Farm, which breeds British Saddleback pigs, is open for visitors Fridays to Sundays, free of charge. Governance The village is a populous part of 'Newland and St Briavels' electoral ward. This ward starts in the north at Newland and stretches south to St. Briavels. The total ward population taken at the 2011 census was 3,297. Surrounding parish Upper Meend and Lower Meend are locales situated on the west of the village on the slope leading down to the valley floor where the River Wye runs. Nearby hamlets and settlements include St. Briavels Common (which has not been common land since the Enclosure Acts but retains its name), Cold Harbour (an old English place name), Mork, the Fence, the Hudnalls, and Triangle, which lies towards Brockweir. The villages of Llandogo, Penallt and Whitebrook lie on the Welsh side of the Wye Valley in Monmouthshire. At the base of the valley, the Bigsweir Bridge across the Wye is one of the world's first iron bridges. Railways St Briavels railway station was a station along the Wye Valley Railway. It was built in 1876 during the construction of the line on the Monmouthshire side of the River Wye at Bigsweir, and was intended to serve the nearby villages of St Briavels, across the river in the Forest of Dean, and Llandogo, which is further down the Wye Valley. The station was renamed three times during its life: firstly Bigsweir Station, then St Briavels and Llandogo Station, and finally St Briavels Station. The station was closed to passenger services on 5 January 1959 and the line closed to freight in 1964.B. M. Handley and R.

As a small village of 79 residents (2010), it is known merely for its name, the German word for America, which was given to it in the 19th century. In 1836, a spinning factory was built on the left bank of the river Zwickauer Mulde, but houses for workers and clerks were not built until 1870. Initially, because a bridge was only built much later, workers and visitors coming from the right bank of the river had to cross the water using stepping stones or boats to access the place. As \\"crossing the pond\\" in those times was chiefly understood as emigrating to America, the factory was named \\"Amerika\\" by the local population. The name became official in 1876 (incidentally, the centennial of the United States of America) when the village's railway station was named \\"Amerika\\". The factory was closed in 1991. Amerika was part of Arnsdorf until 1993 and, together with the latter, became part of Penig in 1994. In 1995, the town of Penig bought the buildings from the Treuhandanstalt, and new trades and a museum (including workshops of locksmiths and file cutters, powered by a refurbished water turbine) have been established since.

J. Beal Botanical Garden is a botanical garden located on the campus of Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan, United States. It is claimed to be the oldest continually maintained university botanical garden in the United States, and is open to the public without charge year round during daylight hours. The garden displays 1,800 plant taxa, in economic, systematic, landscape and ecological groupings. The botanic garden was started by Prof. William James Beal as part of the Department of Botany to serve as an outdoor teaching and research laboratory. Work towards starting the garden began in 1872 with a nursery, followed 1873 by test plots of 140 species of forage grasses and clovers in a portion of the garden referred to as \\"Sleepy Hollow\\". Shortly after founding the botanic garden, Professor Beal established an arboretum on campus in 1874 which began as two rows of swamp white oaks. For the period of time from 1877 to 1924, the garden was known as \\"The Botanic Garden\\" or \\"Wild Garden\\" at Michigan Agricultural College. Shortly after Professor Beal's death on May 12, 1924, the garden was officially named for him on December 17, 1924 by the Michigan State Board of Agriculture upon the recommendation of the Department of Botany. After Professor Beal's retirement in 1910, Professor H.T. Darlington was appointed Director of The Botanic Garden in 1914 and served until 1930. The gardens developed from these starting points until 1950, when they were reorganized and redesigned by Prof. Milton Baron to form today's four main collections. In 1954, the garden began participating in the international seed exchange program, publishing its first Index Seminum, and in 1961 was extended with a collection of acidophilous plants including rhododendrons, azaleas, and ferns. More recently, a collection of Michigan's endangered plants was added in 1986, and the non- flowering vascular plant collection was started in 2001 with ephedras, conifers, ginkgo, cycads, ferns, horsetails and clubmosses.

The ship was built in 1994 by Brodosplit in Split, Croatia. She was originally ordered by Euroway and was to be called Frans Kockum but never sailed under that name. The ship was also temporarily renamed Thomas Mann during construction. She first sailed under the name Crown of Scandinavia. Crown Seaways has three sister ships: Amorella and Gabriella in the Viking Line fleet and Isabelle in the Tallink fleet. History Euroway originally planned to operate two cruiseferries on a route connecting Malm√∂, Sweden to Travem√ºnde, Germany. To achieve that two identical cruiseferries were ordered from Brodosplit, Croatia, to be called Frans Suell and Frans Kockum. The ships were a somewhat enlarged version of Amorella and Isabella that the shipyard had built for SF Line in 1988 and 1989, respectively. Due to the Croatian War of Independence the delivery of Frans Suell was delayed by nearly a year, from 1991 to 1992. Poor profitability of the route, further delays in construction of the second ship and a joint operations agreement with Silja Line made Euroway decide to cancel the order for Frans Kockum. The Crown of Scandinavia in its former livery, departing Oslo (2010). After the order was cancelled, the ship was renamed Thomas Mann and work on her was continued, but at a more leisurely pace. In March 1994 the Thomas Mann sailed from the shipyard in Split to the Fincantieri shipyard at Trieste, Italy for minor modifications. On 2 May 1994 DFDS made a tentative agreement to purchase the ship, and bought her ten days later. The ship was finally delivered on 11 June 1994. From Trieste she sailed to Lloyd Werft, Bremerhaven, Germany, where stern sponsons were added to the ship for increased stability. On 26 July the ship was renamed Crown of Scandinavia and began sailing on Scandinavian Seaways (a marketing name for DFDS passenger operations) Copenhagen ‚Äî Helsingborg ‚Äî Oslo -service. In 1999 the company name reverted to DFDS Seaways. In January 2005 the ship was rebuilt at √ñresundsvarvet, Landskrona, Sweden. On 15 October 2006 the call at Helsingborg was dropped from the route in order to cut down fuel and pilot expenses. In July 2020 and after a break of 46 years, Frederikshavn was introduced as a port of call in both directions. =2014 engine incident= On 27 April 2014, the vessel experienced engine problems near the Danish island of Anholt, whilst travelling from Copenhagen towards Oslo. It is reported that passengers heard a loud bang, a shudder and smoke at about 21:30, when the vessel suffered an engine failure and crank explosion. The ship soon continued on its way towards Oslo.

Libera regularly performs concerts in many countries, including the UK, the US and Asia, and regularly makes recordings for their own album releases and other projects. Many members also sing in the parish choir of St. Philip's, Norbury, in South London. According to a 2009 Songs of Praise TV special, the group usually consists of approximately 40 members between the ages of seven and sixteen, including new members who are not yet ready to fully participate in albums or tours. The group recruits from a variety of backgrounds in the London area, and does not require its members to belong to any specific denomination. In addition to recording albums, touring and making regular TV appearances as Libera, the group sings on a weekly basis as part of the full choir of men and boys at parish choral services. Libera is run as a not-for- profit registered UK charity, \\"providing the opportunity for suitable boys to train as vocalists from any background\\". Members do not get paid for their work within Libera, but their expenses are covered when touring. The group's name comes from its signature song, \\"Libera\\", which is based on the \\"Libera Me\\" portion of the Requiem Mass. Libera is the Latin singular imperative of liberare, meaning \\"to free\\". History The Anglican (High Church) parish of St. Philip's, Norbury has a long choral tradition. Their first non-traditional commercial work was in 1984, when the boys of the St. Philip's Choir backed Sal Solo on his song \\"San Damiano\\". In 1987, the boys of St. Philip's Choir released the single, \\"Sing Forever\\". In 1988, the choir released the single \\"Adoramus\\". In 1988, the choir released their first full commercial album, Sing For Ever under the name St. Philip's Choir. The title track for this album was chosen by the BBC as the first Children in Need telethon anthem. The second album, New Day, released in 1990, was the first album to use the name Angel Voices. During the 1990s, the names \\"St. Philip's Boy Choir\\" and \\"Angel Voices\\" were both used to refer to the choir. The third album, Angel Voices, was released in 1992. It was re-released in 1993, with the choir referred to as the St. Philip's Boy's Choir. Angel Voices 2 was released in 1996 and Angel Voices 3 was released in 1997. Both were released under the name of St. Philip's Boy's Choir, by the record label MCI.Lacrymosa.org In 1999, Robert Prizeman released a single and a CD, Libera. The CD contained seven remixes of his original song, \\"Libera\\". The first four tracks feature Libera with Daren Geraghty as the main soloist; the last 3 tracks are performed by other artists. In the same year, the choir, calling itself Libera, performed the song on the TV programme Sunday Live. In 1999, the choir released another album entitled Libera, published by Warner Classics. From that point on, the choir has been consistently referred to as \\"Libera\\" when acting in its commercial capacity. The next Libera album, Luminosa, was released by Warner Classics in 2001. In 2003, Warner Classics re-released Libera and Luminosa as a two CD set entitled Complete Libera. Ever since 2004, Libera has been under contract with EMI. Their first EMI album was Free. Visions came out in 2005. Libera's 2006 album, Angel Voices, was nominated as Album of the Year by the Classical Brit Awards. New Dawn was released in March 2008. In December 2008, they released their first double CD entitled Eternal (The best of Libera) which contains 26 tracks taken from earlier albums and six new tracks. Their album Peace was released in 2010. November 2011 saw the release of Libera: The Christmas Album. Libera as a charity Libera became a registered charity in 2007 under the guidance of the late Steven Philipp (whose son Ben was a soloist in the choir). A US arm of that charity was set up in 2014. Television appearances and concerts As Angel Voices, the group made frequent appearances on UK television, mostly on the BBC. During the earlier years as Libera, the group seldom made any TV appearances and concerts were also few and far between. It is only since the group turned into a registered charity in the UK, where a board of trustees consisting largely of parents of members makes all decisions, that Libera have made regular tours (usually three times a year) and more frequent TV appearances. Major roles in the 1992 TV programme Titchmarsh on Song, presented by Alan Titchmarsh, and the 1993 TV programme Thora on the Straight and Narrow, introduced Angel Voices to a wider public.Lacrymosa.org The show featured the first public performance of the song \\"De Profundis\\", which would become \\"Libera\\" and give the choir its name. Libera has made numerous music videos for Songs of Praise and Classic FM TV. Other TV appearances include guest spots on GMTV, Blue Peter, Sunday Live, Christmas Cooks, Top of the Pops, Wogan, and Last Choir Standing. In 1994, St. Philip's Choir sang in an episode of the TV series Poirot. In 2003, Libera was the last act to perform on the UK version of the famous TV series This is your Life; they performed for guest Aled Jones. During the episode, it was mentioned that Libera had performed at Aled Jones' wedding. In February 2007, Libera appeared on the television contest When Will I Be Famous? presented by Graham Norton on BBC One. They won, and were invited back the following week. Libera has made several TV appearances in Japan and Korea. Libera also recorded the signature tune for Songs of Praise. Their rendition of \\"How Can I Keep From Singing\\" was featured on a British television ad for Waitrose. On 30 and 31 May 2007, Libera recorded two free concert performances at the Pieterskerk in Leiden, the Netherlands, with the cooperation of the American Public Television. Footage from the performances was combined to create the TV special Angel Voices: Libera in Concert. The programme was featured on Public Broadcasting Service channels in the United States and released by EMI on DVD and CD. The DVD includes a bonus feature entitled \\"Libera in Their Own Words\\", which features interviews of some of the boys. A 35-minute special about Libera aired in January 2009 as an episode of the BBC1 TV show Songs of Praise. On 22 December 2013, Libera were featured singing an arrangement of Silent Night in the BBC1 Songs of Praise Christmas Big Sing, recorded in the Royal Albert Hall. Supporting roles Libera has provided choral backing to a number of artists, including Aled Jones, Bj√∂rk, Luciano Pavarotti, Hayley Westenra, Peter Skellern, Jos√© Carreras, Neil Diamond, Cliff Richard, and Michael Crawford. Libera has also sung for several film soundtracks, including Romeo & Juliet, The Merchant of Venice, Shadowlands and Hannibal. A movie preview for The Curious Case of Benjamin Button uses a brief selection from one of their songs, but they do not appear in the film's final soundtrack. Several Libera members have performed solo work outside of Libera while still members of the choir. For example, Tom Cully sang for Silence, Night and Dreams by Zbigniew Preisner, and can be heard singing in an episode of the British television series Foyle's War. In 2002, Libera member Steven Geraghty was a featured soloist for the soundtrack of the PlayStation 2 game Ico. More recently, Libera member Ciaran Bradbury-Hickey helped to record the soundtrack of [Road] which is a short film about motorbike racing. Former Libera member Ben Crawley did solo work for Paul Joyce's production of The Snow Queen in 2004. Style =Music= Libera has a distinctive sound. All of its singers are boys, most with unchanged boy soprano (also known as treble) voices, with those boys in their early teens singing the lowest parts. Almost all their songs are either new compositions by Robert Prizeman or new arrangements of classical and contemporary tunes. Prizeman often composes and arranges pieces with individual soloists in mind, to emphasize the variety of characteristics and qualities in the boys' voices. His compositions blend innovative textures, meditative soloists and vibrant ecstatic chorus harmonies that stretch across the full range of the boys' range. Libera's music frequently combines elements of Gregorian chant, classical composers such as Debussy, Beethoven and Pachelbel, as well as contemporary pop and new age music. Some of their songs, such as \\"Sanctus\\", have appeared in different versions on several of their albums. Some more contemporary songs have been covered by the group, such as Enya's Orinoco Flow. Most of Libera's lyrics come from traditional hymns, the Latin Rite liturgy, and contemporary songs by artists ranging from Brian Wilson and Billy Joel to Enya. However, lyrics from various poems and original lyrics are also used. For example, We are the Lost uses the poems \\"In Flanders Fields\\" by John McCrae and \\"For the Fallen\\" by Laurence Binyon, along with a single stanza from the English hymn, \\"O God, Our Help in Ages Past\\" by Isaac Watts. While most of the Libera's original lyrics are written by Robert Prizeman, other individuals, including former Libera soloist Steven Geraghty, have also contributed new lyrics to recent albums. Libera uses a variety of instrumentation. Robert Prizeman, Ian Tilley and Steven Geraghty play electronic keyboards, piano and organ. Steven Geraghty also played clarinet for Free, Visions and Angel Voices, and percussion for Visions and Angel Voices. All of their EMI albums feature Fiona Pears on the violin. Angel Voices: Libera in Concert has additional backing by Il Novecento Orchestra. The City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra provides backing to their New Dawn album. =Clothing= For most of their performances, the boys of Libera wear distinctive white hooded robes based on monastic cowls. The boys can be seen wearing the robes on the covers of several albums. Other Libera uniforms include white or black hoodies and black slacks with light blue shirts. Some of their videos have featured the boys wearing ordinary, casual clothing. =Cover art= Common motifs in the cover art of the choir's albums include birds, clouds, light as well as pictures of the choristers. The 2017 release of Hope adapts this theme using a line drawing of robed choristers. The 1993 release of Angel Voices, Angel Voices 2, Angel Voices 3, Libera, Luminosa and Welcome to Libera's World all feature white birds (presumably doves, the bird of peace) on their covers. Sing Forever, the 1992 release of Angel Voices, Angel Voices: Libera in Concert and New Dawn show several of the boys dressed in white robes. Free and Visions both show a single, ghostly figure in white robes against a cloudy background. On album Free the ghostly figure featured is Callum Payne. The 2006 Angel Voices album shows several boys wearing what appear to be white hoodies.

She is the mother of Mexican actor Luis Gatica, the wife of Lucho Gatica, the niece of Puerto Rican actress Mapy Cort√©s, and the niece in law of Mexican actor Fernando Cort√©s. Mapita Cort√©s is also the cousin of famous Paquito Cordero, two years her junior. Biography Cort√©s was Miss Puerto Rico in the 1957 Miss Universe pageant and finished as one of the top five finalists. Mapita Cort√©s had demonstrated desire to become an actress since she was a child. As she and her cousin grew, her cousin became a known personality in Puerto Rico. Mapita Cort√©s, however, tried her luck in Mexico, since her aunt had adopted her and was a celebrity there. Mapita Cort√©s took her last name from her uncle and aunt. Cort√©s became a sensation in the Mexican film industry during the 1950s, when she appeared in 1958's Misterios de Ultratumba (\\"Mysteries of the Afterlife\\", aka The Black Pit of Dr. M). This movie became a contemporary Mexican classic. Cort√©s then starred or played important roles in a number of films, following her uncle and aunt's footsteps by becoming a celebrity on her own in Mexico. She decided to establish herself in the North American country permanently after enjoying success there. While she was doing films, another celebrity, Chilean singer Lucho Gatica, fell in love with her and the two began a romance that would lead to a marriage on May 21, 1960. They had five children: Luis, Mapy (Maria del Pilar), A√≠da, Juanita, and Alfredo. Their son Luis Gatica (born in 1961), would eventually also become a celebrity as a telenovela actor and rock music singer during the 1980s. Mapita Cort√©s and Lucho Gatica divorced after 18 years of marriage. After marrying Lucho Gatica, Mapita Cort√©s semi-retired from the world of show business, becoming a housewife instead and attending to her children. But she returned to activity sporadically, becoming what is known as a character actress in some of Mexico's most famous telenovelas. In 1989, she participated alongside Ver√≥nica Castro in Televisa's Mi peque√±a Soledad, which became a major hit across Mexico, the United States and even Europe, giving Mapita Cort√©s a degree of celebrity in countries like Russia and others. Mapita Cort√©s also had the opportunity to work alongside Mariana Levy, who died in 2005.

They marry and move to the city, where her powers tend to influence everyone she meets while working in the shop. Through her advice, she helps others and eventually finds the true man of her dreams in a psychiatrist (Jeff Daniels). The Butcher's Wife was a critical and commercial failure, grossing only $9 million at the box office. According to her 2019 memoir Inside Out, Moore regretted starring in the film, saying she only did it to increase her fee after the success of Ghost. Plot As a clairvoyant, Marina awaits signs from beyond that her true love, whoever he may be, is waiting for her, somewhere. When New York butcher Leo Lemke shows up on the tiny North Carolina island of Ocracoke, where Marina lives, she is convinced that he is the man predestined to be her husband. After the wedding, Marina moves into Leo's blue-collar neighborhood, where she successfully commiserates with such eccentrics as withdrawn teenager Eugene, frustrated singer Stella Keefover, unlucky-in-love actress Robyn Graves, over analytical psychiatrist Dr. Alex Tremor, and closeted lesbian dress shop clerk Grace. But what Marina fails to grasp about her powers is that she can see the future of strangers far more clearly than her own, and love is unpredictable no matter how many ways you have to look for it. The film makes use of several phenomena that can be described as occult portents that meeting a love match is imminent or occult tools to help strengthen, seal or bring about love, luck and happiness. These include the sudden \\"finding\\" of a ring that would serve as a wedding band, falling stars with twin tails, zig- zagged rainbows and found objects symbolizing a change in the finder's path that will cause it to cross with their beloved.

It was created in 1977 through the spin-off of divisions of the Varta Group. The first CEO was Herbert Quandt. The group comprises the divisions BYK (coating additives and instruments), Eckart (metal effect pigments and metallic printing inks), Elantas (insulation materials for the electrical and electronics industries) and Actega (coatings and sealant compounds for the packaging industry). The Altana Group has 47 production facilities and 65 service and research laboratories worldwide. In 2019, the company, with about 6,500 employees, posted revenues of approximately ‚Ç¨2.25 billion.  History  Altana's roots go back to 1873, when Heinrich Byk founded the chemicals factory Dr. Heinrich Byk Chemische Fabrik in Oranienburg. The company grew, and in 1931 it was renamed BYK-Gulden Lomberg. In 1941 majority control of the company was acquired by AFA (Akkumulatoren-Fabrik AG) which was renamed VARTA in 1962. In 1977 VARTA was split into three companies, one of which was Altana. From 1977 to 2010, Altana was publicly traded on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. Altana was also admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange from 2002 to 2007. On 19 December 2006 the majority of shareholders voted to approve the sale of the pharmaceuticals division to the Danish company Nycomed. Nycomed is owned by an investment consortium led by Nordic Capital and Credit Suisse. With the sale of the pharmaceuticals division, headquartered in Konstanz, Germany, Altana lost a major pillar of its business. At that time, 9,000 of the company's 13,500 employees were working for Altana in the pharmaceuticals sector, generating two-thirds of the company's total revenue. And indeed, the balance-sheet revenues fell by around 60 percent in 2006, but gained over six percent in 2007. The patent for pantaprazole, the main revenue-generator for the former pharmaceuticals division, expired in 2009/2010. While the Altana Management Board justified the divestiture of the pharmaceutical business with delays in the approval of new products, increased research and development costs as well as strict regulatory requirements in the US and Europe, shareholder activists asserted that the Management Board had invested too little in the pharmaceutical business in the preceding years and had failed to develop successor products in time to compensate for the revenue losses to be expected due to the expiry of the pantaprazole patent at the end of the decade. The pharmaceuticals division was sold for ‚Ç¨4.6 billion. The entire proceeds from the sale were disbursed to the shareholders, who received a special dividend of ‚Ç¨33 per share. Critics expressed discontent that the main shareholder benefited most from the sale of the pharmaceuticals division. Until 1 January 2007, the company was organized into the pharmaceuticals division Altana Pharma AG, formerly Byk Gulden Lomberg Chemische Fabrik, headquartered in Konstanz, and the specialty chemicals division Altana Chemie AG based in Wesel. Since the sale of the pharmaceutical business to Nycomed, Altana has been operating exclusively in the specialty chemicals segment. This restructuring was accompanied by a change in the company logo, which was unified across all subsidiaries. On 6 November 2008, main shareholder SKion GmbH (Germany, owned by Susanne Klatten) issued a public takeover offer of ‚Ç¨13 per share for all outstanding shares, an action which drove up the stock price. A company spokesperson stated that the intention was to delist the company from public trading. To achieve this, SKion issued a second takeover offer of ‚Ç¨14 per share to the remaining shareholders on 9 November 2009. On 30 December 2008, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange announced that Altana would be removed from its MDAX index, as the increase in the share held by SKion had pushed the portion of stock held in free float to under ten percent. By June 2010, SKion held 95.04 percent of all shares. In Germany, the stock was traded mainly on the Frankfurt and Stuttgart Exchanges and the Xetra platform; internationally, it was admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange and the NASD Group, now FINRA, in the US. After SKion acquired the entire Altana stock through a squeeze-out, trading in this stock was suspended effective 27 August 2010.

Lutwyche, J BBC located behind the circular Temple of Vesta at the eastern edge of the Roman Forum, between the Regia and the Palatine Hill. The domus publica, where the Pontifex Maximus dwelled, was located near the Atrium until that role was assumed by the emperors. The Atrium Vestae was a three-story 50-room palace in the ancient Roman Forum built around an elegant elongated atrium or court with a double pool. To the very east is an open vaulted hall with a statue of Numa Pompilius, the mythological founder of the cult. The complex lay at the foot of the Palatine Hill, where a sacred grove that was slowly encroached upon lingered into Imperial times, when all was swept away by the Fire of Rome in 64. The House of the Vestals was rebuilt several times in the course of the Empire. After the dissolution of the College of the Vestals and the introduction of compulsory Christianity by Theodosius I in the late 4th century AD, the House of the Vestals continued to serve as a residence building. It now housed officials of the imperial court, and subsequently the papal court. Archaeological finds from this period include a hoard of 397 gold coins from the 5th century and another 830 Anglo-Saxon coins dating from the 9th and 10th centuries. The site was abandoned in the 11th/12th century. Today, remains of the statues of the Vestals can be seen in the Atrium Vestae.

He and his brother Dan founded a blues band called The Prime Movers, which regularly played Chicago; other members included \\"Blue\\" Gene Tyranny (Robert Sheff). When the drummer left, they replaced him with Iggy Pop (James Osterberg), then 18 years old. The Prime Movers gave him the nickname \\"Iggy\\" as he had played in the band The Iguanas. According to biographer Jim Ambrose, the two years Osterberg spent in the band made him aware of \\"art, politics, and experimentation\\". In 1977 Erlewine founded Matrix Software. He was the first person to program astrology on microcomputers and make astrological programs available to the astrological community. He has published more than forty books on astrology and related topics. Michael Erlewine and his band, the Prime Movers, were inducted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame in 2015. Family Erlewine and his wife have four children. He is the uncle of American music critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine. All Music Guide In the 1990s, Erlewine founded the All Music Guide (allmusic.com), the All Movie Guide (allmovie.com), and the All Game Guide (allgame.com). The first site in particular has become an important popular music reference that licenses its content to numerous other websites. Erlewine regained control of Matrix Software (astrologysoftware.com) in November 2008 and continues as director of that company. Television channel Erlewine is the host on a 12-segment television channel called Spirit Grooves / Dharma Grooves, featuring topics on alternative awareness and reaching some 540,000 viewers.

It is down the line from and measured from via . It is operated by Great Western Railway. History The station was opened by the South Devon Railway Company on 30 May 1846 as the terminus of its first section from Exeter. The line was extended to on 31 December 1846. The single platform was augmented by a second one late in 1848. At this time it was a broad gauge railway. Teignmouth was the original headquarters of the South Devon Railway, the station and offices being described as a \\"primitive apology for a station\\" and locally dubbed the 'Noah's Ark'. Trains were worked from Exeter by atmospheric power from 13 September 1847 and these were extended to Newton Abbot from 17 December 1847 until all the atmospheric trains were suspended on 9 September 1848. The atmospheric engine house was situated adjacent to the platform on the side furthest from the town, the area then being used as permanent way workshops until about 1876. The South Devon Railway was amalgamated into the Great Western Railway on 1 February 1876. When first built the station was situated between two tunnels but the West Tunnel was opened out by June 1881 and the Eastcliffe Tunnel leading to the Sea Wall was removed by 1884, when the distinctive lattice girder bridge at the end of the Sea Wall was installed. The canopy and buildings of 1895 still stand On 20 May 1892 the line was converted to standard gauge. The station was completely rebuilt soon after, the work being completed early in 1895. It now had a similar scale of facilities as those found at other big West Country resorts which had new stations during the last quarter of the century, and . To accommodate longer trains the westbound platform was extended in 1938 and could then handle 15 coach trains, but the opposite platform could not be extended due to the entrance to the goods yard. The Great Western Railway in turn was nationalised into British Railways on 1 January 1948. General goods traffic at Teignmouth ceased on 14 June 1965 but coal traffic continued to be handled until 4 December 1967. This allowed the extension of the second platform to the length of Inter City trains, although this did not happen until 1981. The signal box, which was built at the west end of the westbound platform in 1896, was closed on 14 November 1986 when the new Panel Signal Box at Exeter took over control of the line. The station was closed for two months during the repair of the railway and sea wall at Dawlish caused by the great storm of February 2014. The iron work supporting the roof was repainted during this period. Refurbishing of the pedestrian bridge between the platforms commenced in 2016. =Station Masters= *Mr. Gardener/Gardner ???? - 1863 (afterwards station master at Newton Abbot) *Joseph Pearce/Pearse 1863 - ???? *John Clarke Boundy ???? - 1897 *W.G.

In early 20th century classification of African languages, Sudanic was a generic term for languages spoken in the Sahel belt, from Ethiopia in the east to Senegal in the west. Scope The grouping was based on geographic and loose typological grounds. One of its proponents was the German linguist Carl Meinhof. Meinhof had been working on the Bantu languages, which have an elaborate noun-class system, and he labeled all languages not in Hamito-Semitic or Bushman that lacked such a noun-class system Sudansprachen. There were two main branches; Eastern Sudanic was largely equivalent to Nilo-Saharan sans Nilotic, and Western Sudanic to Niger‚ÄìCongo sans Bantu. Background The Sudanic languages corresponded largely to Nilo-Saharan and Niger‚ÄìCongo A on this map. Westermann, pupil of Carl Meinhof, carried out comparative linguistic research on the then Sudanic languages during the first half of the twentieth century. In his 1911 study he established a basic division between 'East' and 'West' Sudanic, roughly comparable to today's distinction of Niger‚ÄìCongo and Nilo-Saharan. His 1927 collaboration with Hermann Baumann was devoted to the historical reconstruction of the West Sudanic branch. He compared his results with Meinhof's Proto-Bantu reconstructions but did not state the obvious conclusion that they were related, perhaps out of respect for his teacher. French linguists like Delafosse and Homburger, not hindered by such concerns, were quite explicit about the unity of West Sudanic and Bantu, mainly on the basis of synchronic lexicostatistical data. In his 1935 \\"Character und Einteilung der Sudansprachen\\", Westermann conclusively established the relationship between Bantu and West Sudanic. This marked the beginning of the establishment of the Niger‚ÄìCongo family, though it was not until 1963 that Greenberg's classification of African languages solidified and popularized the concept of Niger‚ÄìCongo. Nilo-Saharan Some comparative linguists including Christopher Ehret have used the term \\"Sudanic\\" specifically within the context of Nilo- Saharan to refer to a theoretical clade (monophyletic group) within the broader Nilo-Saharan phylum. According to Ehret, Sudanic is one of two primary branches of Nilo-Saharan, the other being Komuz (which he renames Koman).

Its registered office is in Munich, and it is a member of the Cash Group. Since 2005, UniCredit Bank AG has been a subsidiary of UniCredit S.p.A., an Italian financial service provider headquartered in Milan. When the transfer resolution was entered in the commercial register in 2008, the equities of the minority shareholders were transferred to the principal shareholder, UniCredit S.p.A., as part of a squeeze-out. HVB thus became a wholly owned subsidiary and has not been listed on a stock exchange since that time. Operating in Germany, HVB mainly focuses on private clients business and corporate banking, customer-related capital market activities and private banking (also known as wealth management). As a mixed mortgage bank, it performs banking operations as a universal bank within the meaning of the Mortgage Banking Act and, as a mortgage bank, is also authorised to issue pfandbriefs.  History  = Origins = The oldest roots of UniCredit Bank AG go back to Bayerische Staatsbank, which was founded during the second half of the 18th century. Inspired by the K√∂nigliche Bank Berlin, Margrave Karl Alexander von Brandenburg-Ansbach founded his own bank, the Hochf√ºrstlich-Brandenburg- Anspach-Bayreuthische Hofbanco, using a small amount of operating capital, namely 15,000 guilders. The margrave resorted to this plan for economic reasons, as he wanted to avoid the fees charged by the foreign banks and access the aid funds provided by England for his soldier trade. The war between England and France in North America had led England to conclude contracts with German counts and request troops from them in exchange for aid funds. After the Napoleonic wars, the margravates of Ansbach and Bayreuth came to the Kingdom of Bavaria, and the bank became the K√∂ngliche Bank [Royal Bank]. The end of the monarchy in Bavaria in 1918 saw the renaming of the bank to Bayerische Staatsbank. In 1971, the Bayerische Bank merged with Bayerische Vereinsbank. The Bayerische Vereinsbank was the result of a private initiative by Munich-based and Augsburg-based court bankers, members of the nobility as well as common merchants in 1869. The \\"fairy-tale\\" king Ludwig II granted the initiative the concession to set up a public company limited by shares under the name \\"Bayerische Vereinsbank\\". Two years ago, it received permission for land-financing transactions and thus became a \\"mixed institution\\". Unlike most banks, Bayerische Vereinsbank was then allowed to carry out mortgage banking business operations in addition to the banking business. After the beginning of the 1950s, Bayerische Vereinsbank opened its first branch offices abroad. Through the merger with the Bavarian Statebank, one of the largest banks in Germany emerged. Bayerische Vereinsbank also included Bayerische Handelsbank AG, S√ºddeutsche Bodencreditbank AG and N√ºrnberger Hypothekenbank AG. The expansion of the banking group resulted from, amongst others, the merger with the Bankhaus R√∂chling (Saarbruecken) and, in 1991, with Simonbank (D√ºsseldorf). During the 1960s, Bayerische Vereinsbank started to expand throughout Germany and abroad, and, in 1998, was the third-largest bank in Germany. Bayerische Hypotheken- und Wechsel-Bank (short form: Hypo-Bank) was founded in 1835 on the initiative of King Ludwig I of Bavaria. It was a \\"mixed institution\\" from the very beginning, had the right to issue Pfandbriefs since 1864, and developed into the largest mortgage bank in Germany during the 19th century. Hypo-Bank also began to expand throughout Germany and internationally in the 1960s. = After the first merger = In 1998, Bayerische Hypo- und Wechselbank and Bayerische Vereinsbank, two institutions which were steeped in tradition, were merged to form Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank Aktiengesellschaft. Following the merger, Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank followed the \\"Bank of the Regions\\" strategy. It expanded its network into the promising markets of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE - Central and Eastern Europe). During the period from 2000 to 2002, it completed the integration of the Austrian Bank Austria Creditanstalt and created HVB Group. Within the Group, Bank Austria Creditanstalt was responsible for the CEE countries, It, in turn, expanded in Central and Eastern Europe, and bought, amongst others, the Bulgarian bank Biochim, the Serbian Eksimbanka and the Romanian Banca Comerciala Ion »öiriac. Bayerische Hypotheken- und Wechsel-Bank entered the merger with a large mortgage as it had substantial encumbrances stemming, in particular, from the allocation of mortgage loans to the new federal states. The Chairman of the Management Board of Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank - which resulted from the merger -, Albrecht Schmidt, later estimated the real- estate encumbrances, which had cropped up \\"unexpectedly\\", at being around DM 3.5 billion. This was followed by a bitter dispute between the Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank and the former management board chairman of Hypo-Bank, Eberhard Martini, during the course of which Mr Martini lost his post on the Supervisory Board. The public prosecutor Munich I also initiated preliminary proceedings against Eberhard Martini and additional management board members of the former Hypo-Bank, which were, however, then ceased in 2001 against the payment of fines. The fine imposed on Eberhard Martini in this conjunction amounted to DM 700,000. In March 2003, Hypo Real Estate, the real-estate financing subsidiary of Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank, was spun off and went public. A minority share in Bank Austria Creditanstalt was also listed on the stock exchange. = After the second merger = In 2005, Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank was taken over by the Italian financial institution Unicredit S.p.A.. In the same year, Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank integrated Vereins- und Westbank Hamburg, which, for its part, was the result of merger of Vereinsbank in Hamburg and Westbank in 1974. Logo of Vereins- and Westbank in its 2000 annual report. Vereinsbank in Hamburg was also steeped in tradition. It was founded in 1856 on the initiative of renowned merchants in Hamburg. Westbank, on the other hand, hails from Schleswig-Holstein, and was created in 1943 from a forced merger of several smaller banks in northern Germany. It was initially called \\"Schleswig-Holsteinische und Westbank\\", and was renamed \\"Westbank\\" in 1968. In 2006, Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank took over the corporate clients portfolio of Westfalenbank AG, which had been founded in 1921 by leading companies in the Rhineland-Westphalian industrial district on Bochum. However, there was already a connection between the two institutions since Bayerische Hypotheken- und Wechselbank AG acquired a part of Westfalenbank in 1971. In 2006, the significant majority holding in Bank Austria, the largest bank in Austria, was sold to the parent company UniCredit for ‚Ç¨13 billion without an auction process. This subsequently led to a number of lawsuits by free HVB shareholders. The investment company Activest was sold to a UniCredit fund subsidiary called Pioneer Investments. In January 2007, UniCredit Group announced its intention to carry out a squeeze-out at Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank. The price in this respect was established at ‚Ç¨38.26 per share. Logo of Bayerische Hypo- and Vereinsbank until March 2008. A decision on the squeeze-out was taken at the Shareholders Meeting on 26 June 2007. Following the Shareholders Meeting, over 100 actions to set aside a shareholders' resolution by free HVB shareholders took place; this represents a record for Germany. At the Shareholders Meeting, the Bonn-based lawyer Thomas Heidel was selected as special representative pursuant to ¬ß 147 German Stock Corporation Act, who, amongst other things, was to look into possible claims for damages in conjunction with the sale of the Bank Austria shareholding UniCredit, for its part, lodged an action to set aside a shareholders' resolution in turn.MHP News , with related links.

On 15 September 2008, the squeeze-out adopted by the Shareholders Meeting in June 2007 was entered into the commercial register at the Register of Companies in Munich. As such, all the shares of Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank were transferred to UniCredit by force of law. The listing of shares on the stock exchanges was discontinued at short notice. In April 2008, Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank aligned its market profile to that of UniCredit Group. The brand name HypoVereinsbank was retained; however, the previous blue logo was replaced by black lettering preceded by the red UniCredit logo. Logo of UniCredit Bank AG until 31 July 2010. At the same time, Bank Austria received a new logo. Thus, Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank and Bank Austria aligned their brands optically to the overall brand profile of UniCredit Group. In a second step, Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank Aktiengesellschaft was renamed UniCredit Bank AG on 15 December (amongst other reasons, due to the danger of confusion with Hypo Real Estate, which was spun off in 2003); the brand name HypoVereinsbank was, however, retained. The integration of UniCredit CAIB AG to UniCredit Bank AG, which was announced in February 2010, was completed on 1 July 2010 with its entry in the Commercial Register. The newly founded UniCredit Bank AG - Zweigniederlassung Wien serves as an interface to the customers in Austria and CEE, and focuses on the initiation of transactions as well as the sale of CIB products. The integration constitutes a further milestone in the consolidation of the Groupwide Markets and Investment Banking in UniCredit Bank AG, and hence manages the largest share by far of the investment banking business of UniCredit Group. In August 2014, the company announced the sale of the Direktvank subsidiary. BNP Paribas paid ‚Ç¨354 million for the 81.4% share in DAB held by HVB. HypoVereinsbank sold its interest in PlanetHome AG in June 2015. The transfer of the equities was completed on 16 June 2015. Financial investors AP Capital Investments and Deutsche Invest Equity Partners purchased PlanetHome AG and its subsidiaries. Cooperation with PlanetHome shall remain unaffected by the sale of the equities.

Its cultural commitment extends from the work of the Hypo Cultural Foundation, with the in Munich, right through to the sponsorship of music festivals and international competitions (e.g. Bayreuther Festspiele, Rheingau Musik Festival, Bachfest Leipzig, Richard-Strauss-Festival and the singing competition Competizione dell'Opera). For more than 30 years, the bank has been supporting young artists with its own cultural promotion programme, Jugend kulturell. This includes a series of events throughout Germany, exhibitions in the various genres of the Fine Arts and an annual competition for the Jugend kulturell Award. Furthermore, HVB hosts the UniCredit Festival Night in Munich's city centre. The annual kick-off event of the Munich Opera Festival presents performances from the world of opera, concert, dance, songs and literature. The UniCredit Festival Night is organised in cooperation with the Bavarian State Opera. The HypoVereinsbank Art Collection also plays an important role in the bank's promotion of culture. At present, it comprises over 20,000 artworks, ranging from antiquity right down to the present day, which are distributed among 600 branch offices around the world.laut Sammlung HVB The Collection focuses on older masterpieces (e.g. Leandro Bassano and Fran√ßois Boucher); classical, modern and contemporary art (e.g. Kurt Schwitters, Georg Baselitz and Gerhard Richter), light art (e.g. Dan Flavin) and photography (e.g. Henri Cartier-Bresson).

In some cases they will also work with local civilians within a military area of operations. Although the term chaplain originally had Christian roots, it is generally used today in military organizations to describe all professionals specially trained to serve any spiritual need, regardless of religious affiliation. In addition to offering pastoral care to individuals, and supporting their religious rights and needs, military chaplains may also advise the executive on issues of religion, and ethics, morale and morals as affected by religion. They may also liaise with local religious leaders in an effort to understand the role of religion as a factor both in hostility and war and in reconciliation and peace. On the role of chaplains in multinational operations. Military chaplains normally represent a specific religion or faith group but work with military personnel of all faiths and none. Some countries, like the Netherlands and Belgium, also employ humanist chaplains who offer a non- religious approach to chaplain support. From 1918 to 1942, political commissars in the Soviet Red Army monitored and shaped the beliefs, loyalties and enthusiasms of Soviet soldiers and officers in a context of official state atheism.

Royal Navy chaplains undertake a 16-week bespoke induction and training course, including a short course at Britannia Royal Naval College, and specialist fleet time at sea alongside a more experienced chaplain. Naval chaplains called to service with the Royal Marines undertake a commando course at Commando Training Centre Royal Marines, Lympstone and if successful serve with a front-line Royal Marines unit. British Army chaplains undertake seven-weeks training at The Armed Forces Chaplaincy Centre Amport House and the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst.http://www.army.mod.uk/rolefinder/role/25/chaplain/ Royal Air Force chaplains must complete 12 weeks Specialist Entrant course at the RAF College Cranwell followed by a Chaplains' Induction Course at Armed Forces Chaplaincy Centre Amport House of a further 2 weeks. In the United States, the term, nomination, is not generally applied to the process of becoming a military chaplain. Individuals volunteer, and if they are accepted, they are commissioned as military staff officers in the Chaplain Corps. Members of the clergy who meet the qualifications for service as an officer in the military are free to apply for service with any of the three United States Chaplain Corps: the Army, Navy, and Air Force each has a Chaplain Corps, with Navy chaplains also assigned to serve with Marine Corps units, Coast Guard units, and the Merchant Marine Academy. Some clergy, like rabbis, can apply without permission from any individual or organization within their faith group; others, in faith groups that have a hierarchy established to make decisions on the postings or positions of their members, must be granted permission from the appropriate official, such as the appropriate Bishop. As the application process proceeds, and the military determines whether the applicant will meet standards in areas such as health, physical fitness, age, education, citizenship, past criminal history, and suitability for service, which includes supporting the free exercise of religion for men and women of all faiths, an endorsement from an endorsing agency that is recognized by the Department of Defense, representing one or more faith groups in the United States, will be required, in part to ensure that the separation of church and state is honored. Neither the government as a whole nor the military in particular will be put into the position of determining whether an individual is a bona fide priest, minister, rabbi, imam, etc. (The requirement for such an endorsement has been in force since 1901, and today many of the various religious endorsing agencies work together under such non-governmental voluntary umbrella groups as the National Conference on Ministry to the Armed Forces.) Although ordination is usually required for chaplain service, some \\"equivalent\\" status is accepted for individuals from religious groups which do not have ordination, such as the Church of Christ. Additionally, in cases where an endorsing agency is not yet established for an individual's religion, it is possible for him or her to be endorsed by the endorsing agency of another group, a process which was followed for the first Muslim chaplains in the military. In any event, this endorsement is recognized as necessary, but not sufficient for acceptance as a chaplain: in other words, the military will not accept an individual for service as a chaplain, nor allow him or her to continue to serve, without such an endorsement remaining in force; however, the decision as to whether to accept that individual remains with the military service, and the individual can be rejected for a number of reasons, including the needs of the military, even with the endorsement of an endorsing agency. Non-combatant status The Geneva Conventions are silent on whether chaplains may bear arms. However, the Conventions do state (Protocol I, 8 June 1977, Art 43.2) that chaplains are non-combatants: they do not have the right to participate directly in hostilities. It is generally assumed that during World War II, chaplains were unarmed. Crosby describes an incident where a US chaplain became a trained tank gunner and was removed from the military for this \\"entirely illegal, not to mention imprudent\\" action. At least some British chaplains serving in the Far East, however, were armed: George MacDonald Fraser recalls \\"the tall figure of the battalion chaplain, swinging along good style with his .38 on his hip\\" immediately behind the lead platoon during a battalion attack. Fraser asks, \\"if the padre shot [an enemy], what would the harvest be ... apart from three ringing cheers from the whole battalion?\\" The Reverend Leslie Hardman, the British Second Army's senior Jewish chaplain, who became well known for his work amongst the liberated prisoners after the capture of Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, was another who insisted on being armed while on active service. In recent years, both the UK and US have required chaplains, but not medical personnel, to be unarmed in combat, although the US does not prohibit chaplains from earning marksmanship awards or participating in marksmanship competitions. Other nations, notably Norway, Denmark and Sweden, and also Australia,\\"Afghanistan: Chaplains provide comfort to troops\\", SBS World News, 29 October 2012 make it an issue of individual conscience. There are anecdotal accounts that even US and UK chaplains have at least occasionally unofficially borne weapons: Chaplain (then Captain) James D. Johnson, of the 9th Infantry Division, Mobile Riverine Force in Vietnam describes (Combat Chaplain: A Thirty-Year Vietnam Battle) carrying the M-16 rifle while embedded with a combat patrol. Since 1909 US chaplains on operations have been accompanied by an armed chaplain assistant. However, perhaps on this occasion it was felt that an unarmed uniformed man would draw unwelcome attention. Captured chaplains are not considered prisoners of war and must be returned to their home nation unless retained to minister to prisoners of war.Third Geneva Convention, 12 August 1949, Chapter IV Art 33 Inevitably, serving chaplains have died in action. The US Army and Marines lost 100 chaplains killed in action during World War II: the third highest casualty rate behind the infantry and the Army Air Forces. Many have been decorated for bravery in action (five have been awarded Britain's highest award for gallantry, the Victoria Cross, and nine have received the Medal of Honor). The Chaplain's Medal for Heroism is a special US military decoration given to military chaplains who have been killed in the line of duty, although it has to date only been awarded to the famous Four Chaplains, all of whom died in the sinking in 1943 after giving up their lifejackets to others. In 2006, training materials obtained by US intelligence showed that insurgent snipers fighting in Iraq were urged to single out and attack engineers, medics, and chaplains on the theory that those casualties would demoralize entire enemy units. Among the training materials, there included an insurgent sniper training manual that was posted on the Internet. Among its tips for shooting US troops, there read: \\"Killing doctors and chaplains is suggested as a means of psychological warfare.\\" Chief of chaplains/chaplain general Anglican Archbishop Riley addressing a crowd as 'Chaplain-General to the AIF' Military chaplains are often supervised by a chaplain general or chief of chaplains, on the staff of the leader of the nation's military forces. In some countries, like Israel, Canada, and South Africa, one chief of chaplains/chaplain general serves in that position for all chaplains of all religions, in all branches of the military. In many other countries, such as France, there is a separate chaplain general/chief of chaplains for each faith group represented by chaplains. In other countries, like the United States, there is one chaplain general/chief of chaplains for each branch of the military. So, for example, in the United States, there is an Army, Navy, and Air Force chief of chaplains. They meet on as representatives to the Armed Forces Chaplains Board,Armed Forces Chaplains Board (AFCB). Instruction Number 5120.08 (August 20, 2007). US Department of Defense. Retrieved 2010-09-09. to discuss issues that cross service lines, but each reports as a staff officer of his or her service, to the Chief of Staff of the Army or Air Force, or the Chief of Naval Operations of the Navy. (In the United States, Navy chaplains serve Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard personnel. Navy chaplains also assigned to the Merchant Marine Academy, for Merchant Marine personnel.) International organization The International Military Chiefs of Chaplains Conference grew out of a conference NATO chiefs of chaplains organized by the United States European Command (USEUCOM) in 1990. It welcomes any chief of chaplains (or chaplain general, an equivalent term used by many nations). Religions and faith group organizations Worship Pennants may be flown above the Ensign =Christianity= Catholic Church Fr. Thomas Mooney, a Catholic chaplain of the 69th Infantry Regimer of the New York State Militia, at a mass with fellow soldiers at Fort Corcoran, Arlington Heights, Virginia, 1861 Catholic chaplains are generally organized into military ordinariates, such as the Archdiocese for the Military Services, USA. Potential Roman Catholic chaplains must seek permission from their diocesan bishop or religious superior to serve as a military chaplain. While serving as a chaplain, the priest or deacon remains incardinated in his home diocese, but is temporarily under the direction of the prelate of the ordinariate for the duration of his service. Protestant denominations Each of the various Protestant Christian denominations may set its own requirements for certification as a minister.Serving the Lord as a Chaplain in the Armed Forces of the United States of America (adopted by the Home Missions Commission, June 2000). North American Baptist Conference. Retrieved 2010-09-10. =Judaism= Austrian Jewish military service during WWI (1914-18). Besides the Military Rabbinate of Israel, today, military rabbis serve throughout several countries of the world, most notably in the US military forces, and various European armies. Since the rise of the Christian religion in Europe and worldwide, as a matter of course Christians fought against Christians over and over again. During World War I, for the first time a substantial number of Jews served on all sides of the war, and so did military rabbis. As a result of 18th and 19th centuries\` emancipation, \\"military field rabbis\\" served on all fronts and in all combating nations. Badges and insignia Badges and insignia vary widely across nations and services; though generally include some form of symbol specific to the individual chaplain's religion. In addition to badges and insignias for individual chaplains, certain nations, including the United States, fly a Church or Worship Pennant during the time a chaplain leads a religious worship service, especially on ships at sea. On United States Navy ships it is the only pennant that flies above the United States flag. Military chaplains by country =Argentina= Roman Catholic military chaplains served in the Argentine armed forces since the early nineteenth century, and wore officers¬¥ uniforms and ranks. However, the use of these was discontinued in the 1970s in the Army and the Air Force, and in the 2000s in the Navy, due to allegations of some chaplains supposedly abusing their military position and thus discouraging their subordinates to approach them when in need. Nevertheless, chaplains continue to wear combat uniform (but no rank insignia) when accompanying the troops in field operations or exercises, and are still considered as a part of the officers corps. No specific provisions exist for the spiritual support to non-Catholics. =Armenia= The Armenian Army has a sponsored chaplaincy program which is jointly funded by the Ministry of Defence of Armenia and the Armenian Apostolic Church. More than 50 clergymen serve as chaplains in the Armed Forces of Armenia. They often organize religious programs and offer opportunities for prayer, especially before each military exercise conducted by the armed forces. The clergy program was created in 1997 on the initiative of Karekin I and the directive of Minister of Defense Vazgen Sargsyan. A combined clergy company will usually take part in the quinquennial Independence Day Parade on Republic Square. All military chaplains are commissioned army officers.https://horizonweekly.ca/en/76334-2/http://www.blagovest- info.ru/index.php?ss=2&s;=3&id;=43078 =Australia= Army and Air Force An Australian chaplain wearing the \\"Large Box Respirator\\" also known as the \\"Respiratory Tower\\" during the First World War, Bois Grenier Sector on 5th June 1916. Chaplains in the Australian Defence Force (ADF) have almost the same status as chaplains in the British armed services. Chaplains in the Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) are commissioned officers and wear the uniform of officers of their particular branch of the services as well as the rank to which they are qualified. Chaplains in the Australian Army and the Royal Australian Air Force begin their commission as a Captain (Army) or Flight Lieutenant (RAAF) respectively. There are five levels or \\"divisions\\" for the seniority of chaplains in the Australian Army and Air Force with each division corresponding to a worn rank. The highest \\"division\\" is Division 5 who are \\"principal chaplains,\\" of which there are three per service representing the three major Christian denominations: Catholic, Anglican and Protestant. The principal chaplains of the Army wear the rank of brigadier and in the RAAF, air commodore. Australian Army chaplains, whatever their rank, are mostly referred to as \\"Padre\\" by officers and soldiers alike. The title is also widely used in the RAAF for their chaplains. Navy :See: Royal Australian Navy#Chaplains Like chaplains in the Australian Army and RAAF, Royal Australian Navy (RAN) chaplains are commissioned officers and wear the uniform of an RAN officer, but like chaplains in the British Royal Navy (RN) they do not wear a rank. Rather they wear the same cross and anchor emblem worn by RN chaplains on their shoulder rank slides and do not have gold braided rings or executive loops on their winter sleeve coat or summer shoulder boards. Like other chaplains in the ADF, Navy chaplains have five divisions of seniority. Whilst Australian Navy chaplains do not wear rank, they are accorded a certain rank for protocol and ceremonial occasions and for saluting purposes. Division 1, 2 and 3 Australian Navy chaplains are accorded the rank and status as commander (lieutenant colonel equivalent in the Australian Army). Division 4 Australian Navy chaplains are accorded the rank and status of captain (equiv. of Colonel). Division 5 Australian Navy chaplains are \\"principal chaplains,\\" and these three chaplains, representing the three major Christian denominations: Catholic, Anglican and Protestant, are accorded the rank and status of commodore. The title \\"Padre\\" for chaplains is less common and not officially encouraged in the Royal Australian Navy, although it is known to be used by some sailors and Navy chaplains in preference to the more formal title of \\"chaplain\\" or form of address towards an officer such as \\"sir.\\" Like British Royal Navy chaplains, Royal Australian Navy chaplains wear a slightly different peaked cap to other Navy officers which apparently was designed by Winston Churchill. Heads of denominations In the Australian Defence Force (ADF), the heads of military chaplaincy for those Christian denominations and of the Jewish faith that have an official association with the ADF, are also members of the ADF's \\"Religious Advisory Committee\\" (RAC). With respect to the Catholic and Anglican churches, their Bishops are members of RAC and they and the other members of RAC have the status of a two star General (US) or Major General (Australian Army), or Rear Admiral (RAN) or Air Vice-Marshal (RAAF). The Anglican and Roman Catholic strands of Australian Defence Force Chaplaincy have websites that explain their church's mission within the Australian Defence Force. While the Protestant strand does not have a website, one of their chaplains has a representative blog site.http://www.padresponderings.com =Belgium= Belgium has chaplains for its army, and is mainly a Catholic chaplaincy.http://www.army-chaplaincy.be/befr/ =Canada= A cadre of Canadian service members, led by a chaplain, carry the transfer case The Canadian Armed Forces Chaplaincy has approximately 192 Regular Force chaplains and 145 Reserve Force chaplains representing the Protestant, Roman Catholic, Muslim and Jewish faiths. The mission of this Branch is to \\"support and enhance the effectiveness of the CF as a whole ‚Äì its leadership, the individual men and women who serve and their families ‚Äì through the provision of comprehensive religious and spiritual support, advice, and care.\\" The vision of the Chaplaincy is to \\"be an operationally relevant Chaplaincy that supports and cares for all CF personnel and their families, wherever they live and serve, empowering them spiritually and morally to meet the demands of military service.\\" Their role is to: *Foster the religious, spiritual and moral well-being of members and their families *Offer a ministry of presence in a multitude of environments (at home and abroad) *Participate in the life of the worshipping community *Officiate at special functions *Advise the Commanding Officer regarding the spiritual and ethical well-being and morale of their unit *Liaise with civilian religious faith groups *Collaborate with other care providers *Provide directed care after critical incidents When offering prayers during parades and ceremonies, it is customary that the order to remove headdress be given to those on parade. In November 2004, Court Martial Appeal Court of Canada ruled that this order was \\"not lawful\\" since it unjustifiably required all attendees to show participation in a prayer that may not believe. Following this ruling, non-believers are now permitted to retain their headdress just like Jews and Sikhs do in accordance with their faith. =Denmark= Known in Danish as Feltpr√¶sten (), there are 95 Church of Denmark military chaplains serving in the Danish armed forces, ministering to all personnel regardless of their particular faith or lack of faith. Chaplains are uniformed, and the chaplaincy service has a system of internal grades separate from the usual ranking system, allowing each chaplain to be regarded as equal in rank to the person he is addressing. In most countries non- combatant personnel carry no weapons, but Danish chaplains are permitted to carry a sidearm for purposes of self-defence. { ! Grade !! Navy !! Army !! Air Force - !

During the Second World War or to Finland the Winter War, Continuation War, and Lapland War Finland was unique among German allied Axis powers in including Jewish soldiers in its military as well as having field chaplaincy services available for them. =France= French military chaplains Jewish, Muslim and Catholic, Place de Strasbourg 2013 During the Middle Ages, the cloak of Saint Martin of Tours, (cappa Sancti Martini), one of the most sacred relics of the Frankish kings, would be carried everywhere the king went, even into battle, as a holy relic upon which oaths were sworn. The clergyman who served as custodian for the cloak in its reliquary was called a capellƒÅnus, and, by extension, all clergymen who officiated in reliquaries, sanctuaries, or chapels were eventually called cappellƒÅni. This eventually gave chapelain in Old French and was borrowed into English.Ducange, Glossarium, s.v \\"Capella)\\", noted in Encyclop√¶dia Britannica 1911, s.v. \\"Chapel\\". Saint Louis was the king who gave legal status to the military chaplains, since chaplains serving under their lord in the Crusades were the first to be militarized. In 1531, during the Battle of Kappel, the Swiss reformist Huldrych Zwingli became the very first Protestant military chaplain to be killed on the battlefield. The modern French Aum√¥nerie militaire (military chaplaincy) was created and instituted by a July 8, 1880 Act of Parliament, which sets forth how the chaplaincy functions with regard to the Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish faiths. The Secularism Act (1905), which establishes a strict separation of church and state in the French government, does not however apply to the military. The defense minister appoints three command-level military chaplains‚Äîone per faith‚Äîin charge of all chaplains. The chaplains, serving in the army, are assigned by one of these three military chaplains. The first Muslim chaplain-general, Abdelkader Arbi, was commissioned in 2006. French military chaplains wear a uniform since World War II, but have no rank or rank insignia. The modern military chaplaincy is rooted in that war, where military chaplains were incorporated in almost every Free French Forces fighting unit and made up of personnel from England, France, or any of its imperial domains. After the war, military chaplains were sent to occupation zones in Germany and Austria. In the 1950s, military chaplains were sent in the French Union's territories, including Indochina and Algeria. In 1954, pastor Tissot was one of the last paratrooper volunteers to jump over the besieged Dien Bien Phu fortified camp in northern Vietnam. On May 7, he was made prisoner of the Viet Minh and sent to a re-education camp, deep in the jungle. Since 1984, French military chaplains are involved in every military operation‚Äîincluding the Gulf War‚Äîfrom Rapid Reaction Force (Force d'Action Rapide) units to navy ships. In France, the existence of military chaplains has come under debate because of the separation of church and state; however, their position has been maintained . =Germany= World War I and before Field Rabbi Dr. Aaron T√§nzer during World War I, with the ribbon of the Iron Cross.He also earned the Knight's Cross of the Order of Franz Joseph, among others. T√§nzer served at the front, looked after soldiers, organised soup kitchens for the suffering populace and served in military hospitals. The brassard of the red cross shows him as noncombatant. He wears the Star of David as insignium. Initially only Christian chaplains worked in German armies. Only after the French Revolution did Jews become citizens with equal rights in Germany for the first time. An integration of Jewish soldiers within the army gave the German Reich the opportunity to recognize the Jewish urge to fight for the German ‚ÄúFatherland‚Äù. The times of common Christian suppression and supremachy status changed and more and more German Jews served in the liberal French Armies of the German territories under French influence, e.g. in the Bavarian army. In Prussia, king Frederick the Great also showed religious tolerance, but in case of the Jews he exerted intolerance. The Jews were divided into six classes, and only the privileged first class had de facto equal rights as citizens. Very few Jewish soldiers in the Prussian army of the 18th century left historical traces, e.g. Konstantin Nathanel of Salomon, who was promoted to general in 1760. Although the Jewish presence in Germany is older than Christianity, the first \\"field rabbinat\\" was introduced during World War I. The German Kaiserreich appointed c. 30 military rabbis. Field rabbi Dr. Leo Baeck wrote the ‚ÄúIsraelite Field Prayer Book‚Äù. World War II German Christian Field Service for German Soldiers during WWII, the army chaplain gives segen to the German troops with \\"God with us\\" on their belt buckle, 1941; 95% of all Germans being ChristiansHeschel, Susannah, The Aryan Jesus: Christian theologians and the Bible in Nazi Germany, p. 20, Princeton University Press, 2008 Germany had a tradition of appointing Catholic and Evangelical military chaplains and Jewish military field rabbis. This was continued in the Army and Navy of the Wehrmacht, for the Roman Catholic and Protestant denominations only. A total of 95% of all Germans being Christian, German soldiers during Nazi times continued to belong to the churches and had the words \\"Gott mit uns\\" (God with us) on the belt buckles of every Army and Navy enlisted men and non-commissioned officers. Despite this proportion of Christians, the totalitarian national socialistic government of the German Reich tried to weaken the authority and influence of the churches over their German adherents. Besides the international Jewish question, the international character of the Catholic church was another challenge. A few Catholics who devoutly resisted the Nazis, suffered imprisonment and hardship. The case was solved by the Reichskonkordat (1933) between the Holy See and Nazi Germany. The government of the German Reich early established an pastoral ministry for the German Army and the Reichskonkordat settled the appointment of an Army bishop. Therefore, the military chaplains could more freely operate out of the Catholic hierarchy. Franz Justus Rarkowski, S.M., became ordained the Catholic military Field Bishop (Feldbischof) of Nazi Germany in 1938 until 1945. German military chaplains who served the Wehrmacht were part of the German mainstream and lent the Nazi war effort legitimacy. The Christian military chaplains served between strange poles. While the Nazi ideology was at its core pagan (the elite SS units never allowed chaplains), 95% of Germans were baptized Christians. German soldiers during the Nazi era continued to belong to the churches and had the words \\"Gott mit uns\\" (God with us) on their belt buckles. ‚ÄúBeing a chaplain in the German army had always been a prestigious position and the Nazis wanted people who represented that old military tradition (..) and not sow discord or division. They wanted people who were not troublemakers.\\" The German military chaplains mostly wanted to bring the word of the Christian God to men in the field and to deliver the sacraments, make their families proud and serve their country. ‚ÄúThe motives of the chaplains were not unusual, (..) their noble, personal and professional motives turned them into a legitimating force in a war of annihilation.‚Äù Military chaplains in Nazi Germany were rigorously screened. First, names were put on the desks of the local civilian bishops, and then the names had to be approved by the according ministry for church affairs. Eventually the names were cleared by the military's chaplaincy office and the Gestapo (\\"Secret State Police\\"). =Organization and clothing= Throughout the Third Reich period, only the Army and Navy had military chaplains. When needed, other branches of the armed forces acquired chaplains from the Army or Navy or from nearby parish. In the Heer (Army), military chaplains were organized into Group 3b (Pastoral Group) of the General Army Office under the Army High Command. In mid 1935, four groups of military chaplains were introduced. In 1936, similar groups were introduced for the Kriegsmarine although the evolution over time was different. The groups are as follow. * Oberpfarrer (Higher Priest) * Pfarrer (Priest) * Standortpfarrer im Hauptamt (Garrison Priest in Main Office) * Standortpfarrer im Nebenamt (Garrison Priest for Outside Appointment) German military chaplains did not get into the ordinary military rank system, but received privileges like any other regular officers. Army chaplains had four different types of clothing: * Feldbluse (Field Dress). Field dress was identical for enlisted men, non-commissioned officers, and officers, and was worn on the battlefield. For military chaplains, the field dress was worn with officer-quality collar patches and without shoulder boards. Long trousers with shoes or breeches with officer boots could be worn. Two-pronged officer's belt was used. * Dienstrock (Service Dress). Service dress was the typical dress for officers, with high-quality materials and tailor-made. For military chaplains, the field dress was worn with officer- quality collar patches and without shoulder boards. Service dress was normally used behind the lines although photographic evidences also show this kind of uniform was worn on the battlefield. Long trousers with shoes or breeches with officer boots could be worn. Two-pronged officer's belt was used, sometimes with cross strap. * √úberrock (Frock Coat). Frock coat was used for formal occasions and when ordered, and worn over the service dress. The piping was violet. * Mantel (Overcoat). Overcoat worn by military chaplains was identical to those worn by officers. However, no shoulder boards were attached. This was worn over the field dress or service dress. No weapon was permitted to be carried by chaplains, but one photographic evidence shows a chaplain with a pistol holster on his left waist. For the headdresses of the Army chaplains, the most common were: * Schirmm√ºtze (Visor Cap). Officer-quality visor cap with violet as the branch color (Waffenfarbe) for military chaplains. Between the national eagle and cockade, there was a small Gothic cross, either made of metal or embroidered. * Feldm√ºtze (Field Cap). Officer-quality field cap with silver pipings and violet soutache as the Waffenfarbe. Between the national eagle and cockade, there was a small Gothic cross, usually embroidered. All the buttons, national eagles, cockades, Gothic crosses, and cap chinstraps were silver for military chaplains and gold for Field Bishops. The collar patches had violet underlay and violet piping for Catholic chaplains, and field grey underlay and violet piping for Protestant (Evangelist) chaplains. For the Kriegsmarine, the uniform was identical to naval jacket of regular officers, but without sleeve laces and with chaplain collar patches. The collar patches were different to those of the Army. Two-prong officer's belt or brocade belt could be worn. Although the official regulation states that military chaplains had to wear golden pectoral cross, there were two standard- issue crosses that were worn: * For Catholic chaplains, Corpus Christi was present on the cross. The cross itself was made either of metal or silver, with black wood insert. Long metal chains went through a loop at the top of the cross to be worn around the neck. * For Protestant (Evangelist) chaplains, the cross was plain and made of metal or silver. Long metal chains went through a loop at the top of the cross to be worn around the neck. Photographic evidences show numerous variety of pectoral crosses worn by German military chaplains during World War II. Oftentimes, German military chaplains were issued an armband with a red cross sign and violet stripe to show their neutrality on the battlefield, in accordance with the Geneva Conventions, which designated chaplains as neutral parties. This was called Armbinde mit Neutralit√§tsabzeichen (Armband with Neutrality Sign). Among other things, military chaplains also wore standard liturgical vestments such as chasuble, cope, and stole. =Gallery= File:Johannes_Maria_Assmann_JS.jpgJohannes Maria Assmann, Catholic Prussian military bishop, 1899 File:Kardinal Bettinger Krieg 1916JS.jpgCatholic Archbishop Cardinal Bettinger visiting the German Western Front, 1916 File:Altargeschirr Militaerseelsorge.JPGGerman Kriegsmarine suitcase with altar dishes of a Protestant military chaplain, 1940 File:Massagraf nabij Solingen-Ohligs, aan voorzijde stadshuis.jpgLiberated foreign Protestant, Catholic and Jewish chaplains conduct funeral services for the reburial of 71 political prisoners, exhumed from a mass grave near Solingen, Germany, in front of the city hall, May 1945 File:Military chaplains anointing of the Sick.pngPolish‚ÄìSoviet War, chaplain anointing a dying soldier Federal Republic of Germany Ecumenicism in line of succession: Dean Dr. Slaczka, Brig Gen Leidenberger, and Chaplain Weeke at a funeral service, ISAF, 2009 German religious constitutional law and its state-church law is involved in the democratic national identity of modern Germany, especially in various articles of the German Constitution. Initially, a \\"military-chaplaincy\\" contract was only signed between the state and the Protestant Church, but was extended to all other religious communities for reasons of parity. Furthermore, the 1930s Reichskonkordat between the Holy See and Germany is still in force. In Germany, military chaplains of the Bundeswehr have no rank but have a special civilian status as part of the armed forces. Military rabbis or chaplain were banned during Hitler‚Äôs rule and were reintroduced to the German military on May 29, 2020, by the Germany Parliament into law since 1957.

The Military Rabbinate is a unit in the Israel Defense Forces that provides religious services for military personnel, Jewish and non-Jewish, and makes decisions on issues of religion and military affairs. The Military Rabbinate is headed by the Chief Military Rabbi, who carries the rank of a Brigadier General. The Military Rabbinate constitutes the body responsible for religious institutions in the military. In every unit or military base there are Military Rabbinate military personnel assigned responsibility for conducting or coordinating religious services, overseeing Kashrut laws of the kitchen, and the maintenance of the synagogue and religious supplies. Actively serving military personnel can request Military Rabbinate representatives to perform marriage ceremonies and Brit milah for baby boys. The unit also oversees the legal and religious certification of marriages and divorces of individuals during their military service. The Military Rabbinate is responsible for treating the bodies of soldiers in accordance with religious law, including the identifications and post-mortem treatment of bodies, and conducting military funerals. The Military Rabbinate also coordinates the burial of enemy soldiers and the exhuming of bodies in conjunction with prisoner exchanges. The Military Rabbinate was founded in 1948 by Rabbi Shlomo Goren, who headed it until 1968. =The Netherlands= The Netherlands has chaplains of Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, and humanist faiths, provided by the De Diensten Geestelijke Verzorging (DGV) or the Spiritual Care Services.

International Encyclopedia of Uniform Insignia Association. Retrieved 2010-09-09. Since 1968, however, all chaplains have been senior officers and accorded the protocol status of colonel / captain (navy). They carry the military rank of chaplain and the rank insignia, which is unique to the Chaplains Service, comprises a Chi Rho monogramme surrounded by a triangle. The monogramme represents the first two letters of Christ in Greek. It originates from the days of Constantine, the first Emperor of Rome to grant religious freedom to Christians. His own conversion to the Christian faith was initiated by a dream in which the Chi-Rho monogramme appeared to him. The triangle surrounding the monogramme is the symbolic representation of the Holy Trinity. During the vision of the monogramme, Constantine heard the Latin words in hoc signo vinces. The English translation of these Latin words is: \\"In this sign, you will conquer\\". This is the motto of the Chaplains Service and forms part of the Corps Badge. In 1998, after working as chaplain general in exile for the ANC, the African National Congress, during the fight against apartheid, Fumanekile Gqiba was appointed as the first black chaplain general for SANDF, the South African National Defense Force. In 2004, Major General Gqiba left the military to accept his appointment as South African Ambassador to Israel. In the SANDF Chaplain Service, the Hindu faith is represented by a Regular Force chaplain. The rank is Cpln (Vipra) and the mode of address Vipra. The rank insignia is a deepa (lamp) with flame. This is the symbolic representation of enlightenment, the life objective of all Hindus. Muslims do not have Regular Force chaplains in the SANDF because they are small in number. They are however served by part-time workers through the Chaplains Service of the SANDF and are addressed according to their religious customs as imams. Christian chaplains are generally referred to and addressed as Padre. They may however, be addressed according to the practice of their religious bodies e.g., Father, Pastor, Umfundisi (Zulu and Xhosa), Moruti (Sotho), Dominee (Afrikaans) etc. The official written form of address is Cpln (for chaplain) followed by the appropriate ecclesiastical title of the respective chaplain e.g., Cpln (Rev), Cpln (Fr), Cpln (Pastor), Cpln, etc. Along with chaplains from many other nations in the southern region of the continent of Africa, South African chaplains participate in SARMCA, the South Africa Regional Military Chaplains Association, which is a component organization of SADC, the Southern African Development Community.

In recent years, military chaplains have taken a more important role in the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Since the Russian military intervention in Ukraine that began in 2014, many Ukrainian citizens with a religious background have volunteered to serve in the armed forces as chaplains to certain battalions and regiments in the Ukrainian Ground Forces fighting in the Anti-Terrorist Operation Zone during the ongoing War in Donbass. The purpose of utilizing these chaplains, according to Prime Minister of Ukraine Arseniy Yatsenyuk was to needed to boost Ukrainian army morale during the conflict. Originally, the Ukrainian Catholic Church designated around 70 priests to work with their designated units, all of which came from the Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant faiths. The Center of Military Chaplaincy of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church is a notable chaplaincy organization in Ukraine that provides counseling and pastoral care to officers, soldiers and their families. Today, a chaplain is not an official military position, but rather a volunteer service. A notable Ukrainian military chaplain is Ivan Hrynokh, who served with the Nachtigall Battalion during the Second World War.https://www.ncronline.org/news/world/ukrainian- catholic-church-welcomes-plan-add-military-chaplaincy =United Kingdom= Cap Badge of the Royal Army Chaplains' Department Mass in a Dutch field in the front line, 6 October 1944. The first English military-oriented chaplains were priests on board proto-naval vessels during the eighth century AD. Land based chaplains appeared during the reign of King Edward I, although their duties included jobs that today would come under the jurisdiction of military engineers and medical officers. A priest attached to a feudal noble household would follow his liege lord into battle. In 1796 the Parliament of Great Britain passed a Royal Warrant that established the Army Chaplains' Department in the British Army. The Department was awarded its \\"Royal\\" prefix in 1919 in recognition of their chaplains' service during World War I. The current form of military chaplain dates from the era of World War I. A chaplain provides spiritual and pastoral support for service personnel, including the conduct of religious services at sea or in the field. In the Royal Navy chaplains are traditionally addressed by their Christian name, or with one of many nicknames (Bish; Sin-Bosun; Devil Dodger; Sky-Pilot etc.). In the British Army and Royal Air Force, chaplains are traditionally referred to (and addressed) as padre or as Sir/Ma'am (although not the latter in the RAF). Many Padres in the British Army will insist on not being referred to as Sir/Ma'am as they are explicitly outside of the chain of command in the units to which they have been attached, which emphasises their pastoral role rather than a command position. In the Royal Navy chaplains have no rank other than \\"chaplain\\" while in the British Army they hold commissioned relative rank but are universally referred to as Padre. On the foundation of the Royal Air Force Chaplains' Branch an attempt was made to amalgamate these differing systems creating \\"Relative Rank\\", where rank is worn but without executive authority. In practice chaplains of all three services work in similar ways using what influence and authority they have on behalf of those who consult them or seek their advice. During World War II the head of chaplaincy in the British Army was an (Anglican) chaplain- general, (a major-general), who was formally under the control of the Permanent Under-Secretary of State.C. D. Symons, Chaplain-General to the Forces An assistant chaplain-general was a chaplain 1st class (full colonel) and a senior chaplain was a chaplain 2nd class (lieutenant colonel).Brumwell, P. Middleton (1943) The Army Chaplain: the Royal Army Chaplains' Department; the duties of chaplains and morale. London: Adam & Charles Black All chaplains are commissioned officers and wear uniform. British Army and Royal Air Force chaplains bear ranks and wear rank insignia, but Royal Navy chaplains do not, wearing a cross and a special version of the officers' cap badge as their only insignia. Chaplains in the armed forces were previously all Christian or Jewish. The first Jewish chaplain was appointed in 1892 and some 20 to 30 were commissioned during World War II. Until recent times, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has employed only Christian chaplains, with the Jewish community providing an honorary chaplain under long-standing arrangements, although Jewish chaplains have served in the Territorial Army. In October 2005 the Ministry of Defence appointed four chaplains to the military; one each from the Buddhist, Hindu, Muslim and Sikh faith communities. The Museum of Army Chaplaincy holds information and archive material relating to the history of the Army Chaplains' Department. In the era before call signs the radio \\"appointment title\\" for the Padre was \\"Sky pilot\\". =United States= Monument to Catholic Father Francis P. Duffy in Times Square in front of a Celtic cross. He typically was involved in combat and became the most highly decorated cleric in the history of the US Army In the United States, military chaplains have an officer's rank based on their years of service and promotion selection from among their peers. Chaplains serving in the US Armed Forces wear the uniform of their respective branch of service, and normally wear clerical attire only during the performance of a religious service. The position of rank and chaplain faith group insignia varies in each military department and may vary significantly from one type of uniform to another within a military department. The US Army, Air Force, and Navy (as a component of the Department of the Navy, the Marine Corps is supplied by US Navy chaplains) require an 'ecclesiastical endorsement' from the candidate's faith group (which in the case of the Navy must be one registered with the Department of Defense).Army Chaplain Corps: Requirements webpage. GoArmy.com. Retrieved 2010-09-09.Air Force Chaplain Corps official website. Retrieved 2016-01-25. The Civil Air Patrol, the volunteer auxiliary of the US Air Force, also has chaplains, who must meet the same standards for appointment as active-duty Air Force, Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard chaplains. They wear the same insignia as US Air Force chaplains and can be called upon to assist Air Force chaplains. US military chaplains, both individuals and in groups, have been involved in a number of controversies. Complaints have been made against chaplains for mandatory prayers, coercion, and using government money to promote Evangelical Christianity.\\"Soldier alleges religious bias at Lakenheath\\".

One appellate case, Katcoff v. Marsh (1985) upheld the system as a permissible attempt to support service members in the \\"free exercise\\" of their religious beliefs, though others have described the details of the chaplaincy system as violations of the legal principles that the federal government maintain neutrality and avoid becoming entangled in religious affairs.

Its motto is \\"Spearhead of Logistics,\\" and it is currently the second-largest branch of the Army.USATCFE Overview The officer in charge of the branch for doctrine, training, and professional development purposes is the Chief of Transportation (COT). The current Chief of Transportation is Brigadier General Jered P. Helwig. History =Early history= Civil War During the American Civil War, transportation proved to be an integral part of military logistics through the organization of railroads as a viable and efficient means of military transportation. The US Army centralized the management of rail into the United States Military Railroad (USMRR). The Army Quartermaster purchased eight City-class ironclads on the Mississippi River in February 1862, a full month before the USS Monitor and CSS Virginia set sail. City Point, Virginia in 1864 would become the largest port operation in the Western Hemisphere in 1864. By 1864, five of the nine divisions in the Quartermaster Department dealt exclusively with transportation. A substantial number of battles were won because of the field commander's ability to swiftly and effectively move troops and supplies. Most wounded soldiers were carried away in a banana-shaped cart called a gondola. Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War During the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, the task of mobilizing and deploying a largely volunteer force to Cuba and the Philippines magnified the need for a separate transportation service within the Quartermaster Department. Army transporters worked with both the civilian railroads and the maritime industry to pull together a successful intermodal operation. World War I The Pop Valve a self-published magazine of the 19th Grand Division while based at Nevers, France in WWI The American Expeditionary Force that deployed to France during World War I emphasized the need for a single transportation manager. William W. Atterbury, a former railroad executive, was commissioned as a brigadier general and appointed as the Director-General of Transportation and a separate Motor Transport Corps of the National Army was established to manage trucks on 15 August 1918. The United States Army School for Truck Drivers had been established by 9 July 1918; and the Transportation Corps of the AEF was abolished after the war, The M.T.C. subsequently conducted Transcontinental Motor Convoys in 1919 and 1920. =World War II= On 9 March 1942 the Transportation Service was established as part of the Services of Supply, and on 31 July 1942 the Transportation Service became the Transportation Corps.http://www.lonesentry.com/gi_stories_booklets/transportationcorps/index.html In March 1942, the transportation functions were consolidated into the Transportation Division of the newly created Services of Supply. By the end of the war the Transportation Corps had moved more than 30 million soldiers within the continental United States; and 7 million soldiers plus 126 million tons of supplies overseas. From the beginning in England in late May 1942, the Transportation Corps operations in the ETO were directed by Major General Frank S. Ross who had been selected by Maj. Gen. John C. H. Lee, Commanding General, Services of Supply (after the D-Day Invasion called the Communications Zone, or Com-Z), European Theater of Operations. One of the greatest feats of the Transportation Corps, via the Military Railway Service, was the rebuilding of France's shattered railroad network after D-Day and the transportation of 1,500 locomotives and 20,000 railway cars specially built for the lighter French track system starting With D-Day +38. To speed the process, and avoid delays caused by French channel ports and docks destroyed by the retreating Germans, the Transportation Corps brought the heavy railroad stock across the channel and across the beaches in specially built LSTs. As allied forces rapidly advanced across France in the summer of 1944, a special transportation operation nicknamed the Red Ball Express was carried out. The Red Ball Express provided around the clock truck convoys from allied held ports to supply troops on the front in a giant, one-way loop. There were other lesser known truck-route express operations: the Green Diamond Express operated out of Cherbourg due south, to serve the forces advancing on Brittany and Brest. Later the White Ball Highway Express operated out of Le Havre to the same depots served by the Red Ball. Later still, the A B C Highway moved men and supplies from the Belgian port of Antwerp to the front. The story of the Red Ball Express was told in the 1950s movie Red Ball Express. There was a short lived television series in the early 1970s named Roll Out which focused on the experiences of a fictional African American motor transportation unit involved with the Red Ball Express. =Cold War= The Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union extended from 1945 into 1991, spanning the Gulf War. When the Soviet Union cordoned off the city of Berlin in 1948, the Transportation Corps played a vital role in sustaining the city. Two years later, on 28 June 1950, President Harry S. Truman established the Transportation Corps as a permanent branch of the Army. Korean War During the Korean War, the Transportation Corps kept the UN Forces supplied through three winters. By the time the armistice was signed, the Transportation Corps had moved more than 3 million soldiers and 7 million tons of cargo. Vietnam War The Vietnam War saw the most diversified assortment of transportation units ever assembled. For over a decade the Transportation Corps provided continuous support for American and allied forces through an unimproved tropical environment using watercraft, amphibians, motor trucks and Transportation Corps aircraft. The enemy threat to convoys required a unique solution - gun trucks. On 31 July 1986, the Transportation Corps was inducted into the U.S. Army Regimental System. =Gulf War= In 1990 the Transportation Corps faced one of its greatest challenges with the onset of the Gulf War. During Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm, the Transportation Corps working out of ports on three continents demonstrating its ability to deploy and sustain massive forces. =Post Cold War= Operations in Somalia, Rwanda, Haiti, Bosnia, and Iraq have also seen the deployment of large numbers of transportation units. =Operation Enduring Freedom= When the coalition forces invaded Afghanistan, the Transportation Corps opened up the air line of communication into the country and until 2008, a single movement control battalion managed all logistics in Regional Command-East. As the number of brigade combat teams increased in Afghanistan in 2006, the Transportation Corps began ground convoy operations. =Operation Iraqi Freedom= The 143rd Transportation Command opened the port and supported the push to Baghdad in March 2003. After Baghdad fell in April, the maneuver operation matured into a sustainment operation with a hub and spoke supply line. Once the enemy began attacking convoys, the truck drivers responded with an age old solution of hardening trucks with steel and adding machine guns thus making gun trucks and convoy security a permanent part of Transportation doctrine. No matter how great the threat, the Transportation Corps delivered the goods. During Operation New Dawn, the Transportation Corps was responsible for retrograding all the equipment out of Iraq by the December 2012 deadline. Move to Fort Lee According to a September 2010 article in the Army News Service, \\"The first students to attend classes at the new Fort Lee Transportation School will be those enrolled in the transportation management coordinator course - MOS 88N (Military Occupational Specialty). It is the only one of the seven transportation MOS- producing courses that will be taught at Fort Lee (the others are taught elsewhere).\\" For example, Cargo Specialist (MOS 88H), Watercraft Operator (MOS 88K) and Watercraft Engineer (MOS 88L) training is conducted at Fort Eustis, Virginia, as Fort Eustis is the main housing of the Army's Watercraft. Motor Transportation Operator (truck driver, MOS 88M) training is conducted at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. Railway training for Army Reserve soldiers (MOSs 88P, 88T, and 88U) and Army civilian employees has remained at Fort Eustis, as there are only warehouse tracks and no railway system available for training at Fort Lee.

Blow's works are characteristically large scale, colourful abstract collages made from discarded materials. Born in London, she suffered scarlet fever as a child, spending weekends and holidays at her grandparents' fruit farm in Kent. There she spent time painting, before enrolling at Saint Martin's School of Art between 1941-1946, and then the Royal Academy Schools, 1946-1947. She later enrolled at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Rome, where she met Alberto Burri, her partner of a few years. Blow and Burri travelled in Italy together before moving to and working in Paris, and Burri became a life long influence in her work. Early life Sandra Betty Blow was born on 14 September 1925 in Newington, London. She came from a Jewish family; her father, Jacob, who was a fruit wholesaler, and her mother had three children, Sandra was the second. During her childhood, Blow spent weekends and holidays in Kent at her grandparents' fruit farm. In 1934, Blow suffered with scarlet fever, followed by rheumatic fever, from which her heart never fully recovered. After attending a local primary school, Blow was educated at a private girls school. At the age of fourteen, Blow was evacuated with her mother and two brothers to Paddock Wood in Kent, near her grandparents' fruit farm, where she spent her time reading, drawing and painting.A precautionary safety measure. Britain declared war on Germany 3 September 1939. After leaving school at 14, Blow enrolled at Saint Martin's School of Art in 1941, where she studied until 1946 under teachers including Ruskin Spear. During this time she joined the artists' social scene, meeting people such as Lucian Freud, John Minton and Francis Bacon. She spent a short period in 1947 at the Royal Academy schools, but found the teaching dull, so instead travelled to Italy to study classic art. There she was inspired by Nicolas Carone to enrol at Accademia di Belle Arti in Rome. There she met Alberto Burri, with whom she began a relationship that would influence her work for the rest of her life and they travelled together in Italy during 1948. Blow and Burri worked together in Paris during 1949, but finding Burri's influence too overwhelming, Blow returned to the UK in 1950 to pursue her work free of his influence. The pair would create works in response to the each other throughout the 1950s and 60s and although Burri rose to international recognition, Blow remained the better artist. Blow faced the challenge of not only establishing herself as a woman artist in the 1950s but also as an abstractionist. The first sale of any of her works was to Roland Penrose, a founder of the Institute of Contemporary Arts, which proved to be a pivotal moment in her career. Blow's success further changed when the leading London gallery, Gimpel Fils, began representing her work from 1951. Under Gimpel Fils, Blow had regular exhibitions and secured her first solo show in New York. The gallery also represented St Ives artists, including Barbara Hepworth, beginning Blow's life-long connection with the British coastal town. In 1957, Blow moved to St Ives for one year and would return there years later to live permanently. In 1960, Blow began teaching painting at the Royal College of Art, where she remained until 1975 and earned a position as honorary fellow, whilst also painting in her studio in Chelsea, London. She was elected to the Royal Academy in 1978. Artwork Space and Matter, 1959, Tate Gallery. Typical of Blow's work, employing collage effects with unorthodox materials such as liquid cement, chaff and charcoal. After her structured training at Saint Martin's, Blow was influenced by Nicolas Carone and his approach to colour and space. He in turn had been influenced by Hans Hofmann. Blow was also influenced by Alberto Burri, who was progressing towards abstract art informel, using materials such as sacking. Blow and Burri started a relationship, and travelled together throughout Italy during 1948, influencing each other's styles. It was through him that she started to use \\"poor\\" non-art materials, as seen in her painting Space And Matter in which she used liquid cement plus chaff and charcoal, but his lasting influence was in his commitment to art and his interest in the different textures of the world. Blow's work was at the forefront of the British abstract art movement of the 1950s. She was one of the most original woman painters in Britain, challenging the \\"'macho' cult\\" surrounding abstract art. Her works emphasise surface textures, creating a tactile quality, and tend to use simple, large geometric shapes. Blow would regularly use collage effects in her paintings and in her early work, would sometimes dye her canvas with tea to produce natural colours. Blow's later works would demonstrate a greater use of colour and simple, geometric forms. One well-known piece by Blow, illustrating her improvisatory approach to the use of materials, Space And Matter, 1959, is a painting of oil on board plus other experimental materials, creating the impression of wood and tar as well as flame and sea spray. In the 1970s, Blow collaborated with architect Eric Defty on a series of paintings. This collaboration saw Blow begin to incorporate geometric shapes among her organic forms in her later paintings and turn increasingly to square canvases as an architectural component of her work. Blow's work was widely exhibited during her lifetime. Notable exhibitions of her work include sales made to the Museum of Modern Art and the Tate Gallery, the 1958 Venice Biennale, the 1960 Guggenheim International Award (which she won), the 1961 Liverpool John Moores University exhibition and at the Victoria and Albert Museum. Despite moving to St Ives in the 1990s, Blow continued working in London, participating in the Royal Academy's Summer Exhibitions and being honoured with a retrospective in the newly completed Sackler Galleries in 1994. In 1995, she completed her \\"only large scale experimentation with glass\\", an illuminated glass screen named Flight Structure, which was installed in Terminal 3 of Heathrow Airport. This was installed by the airside entrance and the artist styled the work to convey the transition from security to flight. It has now been moved to the airport's head office in the Compass Centre. In 2001-2002, Space and Matter, became the title of an exhibition of Blow's work at Tate St Ives. Later life Blow lived in a flat in South Kensington, London, since the 1960s but was forced to move due to rising rents. In 1994, she moved to St Ives, Cornwall, and there have been retrospectives of her work at the Royal Academy and Tate St Ives. Blow never had children, which had been a purposeful decision in her twenties, but she later regretted it. Blow died at the Royal Cornwall Hospital after a heart valve replacement operation resulted in a cerebral haemorrhage.

The Marvel character is based on the Wendigo legend of the Algonquian peoples. The monster first appeared in The Incredible Hulk #162 (April 1973), created by writer Steve Englehart and artist Herb Trimpe, fighting the Incredible Hulk. The Wendigo is not one specific person, but instead is the manifestation of a curse that can strike anyone who commits an act of cannibalism in the Canadian north woods. Originally only one person can become the Wendigo at the time, which has led to one Wendigo being cured if another person was struck with the curse. In later years it has been revealed that a pack of Wendigoag lived in the Bering Strait. At one point the Wendigo curse infected the Hulk, turning him into Wendihulk, although he was later cured. While normally depicted as a savage beast with no control, Wendigoag have appeared as part of various villainous groups, showing some restraint when not fighting. The Wendigo character has also appeared in several Marvel cartoon series. Publication history The Wendigo first appeared in The Incredible Hulk #162 (April 1973), and was created by Steve Englehart and Herb Trimpe. Englehart recalled, \\"I knew about the legend of the Wendigo, and thought, between his strength and his sad story, that he sounded like a good Hulk opponent.\\" Fictional character biography Several people have been afflicted with the curse of the Wendigo, including Paul Cartier, Georges Baptiste, Francois Lartigue, Lorenzo, Mauvais and others. The curse is regional to the woods of Northern Canada and takes place, under the right conditions, when a person in the forests of Canada feeds on human flesh. This \\"Curse of the Wendigo\\" was created by the Northern Gods (also known as \\"the Inua\\") in an effort to deter human cannibalism.Thor/Hercules: Encyclopaedia Mythologica, Chaos War: Alpha Flight #1. Marvel Comics. The cannibal transforms into a superhumanly strong, nearly indestructible, fur-covered monster: the Wendigo. He or she then roams the woods eating human beings. The Wendigo frequently fights the Hulk, Wolverine, and Alpha Flight. Paul Cartier transformed into the Wendigo, battles the Hulk, and escaped.Hulk #162. Marvel Comics.

A local Canadian super- hero, Talisman, arrives and claims to have a magical cure for the Wendigo's condition. After a long battle, the Wendigo is defeated by a combined attack from his two opponents, and placed into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody. This Wendigo is apparently later taken in by the Canadian-based Department K and is given an electric collar that keeps the usually mindless beast under control and is integrated as a member of Weapon: P.R.I.M.E., a team of operatives each with a personal grudge against Cable.X-Force (Vol. 1) #11. Marvel Comics. Their first mission is to take down Cable, but X-Force proves to be more than capable, as Cable teleports all their belongings out of the base and triggers the autodestruct device, though the device malfunctions and blows up early. Cut off from Cable, X-Force helps Kane, Bridge and Rictor escape the exploding base, while Grizzly, Wendigo (now referred as Yeti) and Tigerstryke are missing. Bridge and Kane still want to arrest X-Force and calls in S.H.I.E.L.D. reinforcement, but Rictor sides with X-Force, since his grudge is only against Cable, not his former teammates.X-Force (Vol. 1) #13-14. Marvel Comics. Later the Wendigo's collar is exchanged with a neurological implant which gives more control to the man inside the beast, even allowing him to speak.X-Force (Vol. 1) #22-23.

During the Chaos War storyline, it is revealed that a pack of Wendigo exist in the Bering Strait after Red Hulk is attacked by a Wendigo, attracted by his camp fire while cooking a meal. A Wendigo bites the Red Hulk on the shoulder and he bleeds hot radioactive blood. The Red Hulk kills one Wendigo, while the others come to claim the body and eat it. It is also revealed that the Great Beasts are forced to manipulate the curse of the Wendigo to allow the transformation of several people instantly instead of only one, in order to create an army to fight with them against the Chaos King Amatsu-Mikaboshi.Loeb, Jeph (w), Adams, Arthur (a). \\"Where Monsters Dwell\\", King Size Hulk #1 (July 2008).

However, both creatures are easily defeated by Hulk and are imprisoned along with Arm'Cheddon in the Dark Dimension by Umar until Tyrannus and Fin Fang Foom raids the dimension, allowing them to escape in the chaos.The Incredible Hulk #633. Marvel Comics. A later confrontation between two Canadian meat packing plant employees resulted in one accidentally killing the other, and the perpetrator trying to cover it up by running the body through the meat grinder. This resulted in a mass outbreak of the Wendigo Curse, which was greatly exacerbated by the curse being transmitted via bite wounds inflicted by the Wendigos, in a process akin to lycantrophy.Amazing X-Men #8. Marvel Comics. An infection of this phenomenon beyond Canada's borders is initially prevented by the mystical limitations of the Wendigo Curse.Amazing X-Men #9-10. Marvel Comics. With the uncontrollably of the outbreak, the Great Beast Tanaraq (the \\"father\\" of the Wendigo) gains enough power to overthrow his fellows and intended to spread the curse across the entire world.Amazing X-Men #11. Marvel Comics. However, the combined efforts of the X-Men, the other Beasts, and Guardian defeat his plan, resulting in the elimination of the curse.Amazing X-Men #12. Marvel Comics. Spider-Woman, with the help of Captain Marvel and Porcupine, later shuts down a Canadian restaurant that had been secretly serving its customers human flesh in an attempt to instigate another outbreak of Wendigo. When Jimmy Hudson appears on Earth-616 following the 2015 \\"Secret Wars\\" storyline, the townspeople mistake him for a Wendigo and shoot him before an actual Wendigo attack occurred. Recovering from the gunshot wound, Hudson fights the Wendigo.X-Men: Blue #1. Marvel Comics. Roxxon later goes on an archaeological expedition to find a Wendigo. When a Wendigo attacks a scientist named Ella Stirling, she is saved by Weapon H.Weapon H #1. Marvel Comics. It was revealed that Roxxon executive Mr. Banks had a miner named Philips Waggoner eat a Wendigo meat at the site where the Avingnon Party resided during a blizzard. The result of this turned Philips Waggoner into an Ur-Wendigo which is more powerful than any normal Wendigo and can grow larger when it ate flesh. The Ur-Wendigo caught up to Weapon H and tried to eat him whole only for Doctor Strange to appear. As the Ur-Wendigo is immune to enchantments, Weapon H borrowed Doctor Strange's Ax of Angarruumus and allowed himself to be eaten by the Ur-Wendigo in order to kill it from within.Weapon H #2. Marvel Comics. Powers and abilities The Wendigo possesses a variety of superhuman physical abilities as a result of transformation by an ancient mystical curse. The curse causes anyone that ingests the flesh of another human, while within the Canadian wilderness, to transform into the Wendigo. The Wendigo possesses superhuman physical strength of an unknown limit. It is known that the Wendigo possesses sufficient strength to go toe-to-toe with the Incredible Hulk. Aside from its vast strength, the tissues of the Wendigo's body are considerably stronger than those of a human being, providing it with superhuman durability. A Wendigo's body can resist high caliber machine gun rounds without sustaining injury. If a Wendigo is injured, it can recover from the physical trauma with tremendous speed and efficiency, giving rise to the quote \\"strike him down and he shall only rise again\\". The dense fur covering the Wendigo's body grants it immunity to the harsh conditions of the extreme cold weather common in the areas in which the Wendigo has appeared. The Wendigo can be rendered unconscious by sufficient force, such as severe physical injury and trauma, but it has even been able to regenerate from being completely disemboweled. It has even survived its heart being ripped from its chest. However, consumption of a removed heart will confer all powers and even the form of the Wendigo on whoever consumes it. It is not known what effect psionic attacks would have on or against a Wendigo. Despite the Wendigo's great size, it can run at speeds greater than that of an Olympic level athlete. The enhanced musculature of the Wendigo generates less lactic acid than the muscles of a human being, granting it superhuman levels of stamina. The Wendigo's fingers and toes are tipped with razor sharp, retractable claws that are capable of piercing even the Hulk's skin, a feat usually reserved for adamantium, due to a combination of the toughness of the claws and the Wendigo's massive physical strength. Even though each Wendigo was once a human being, in most cases very little is left of the person it once was. It possesses little intelligence and can be considered non-sentient, and with the exception of brief and rare instances, is unable to remember things about its former life. It also lacks the ability to speak anything other than its own name, which it often will yell and repeat during its attacks. Sorcerers such as Mauvais and Lorenzo have been able to avoid this aspect of the curse, using magic to gain the power of the Wendigo while keeping their intelligence and the power of speech. Other Wendigo In Amazing Spider-Man #277, a creature called Wendigo appears. This Wendigo seemed to be a ghost-like being whose very presence in New York caused a blizzard to strike. Though the creature only makes its appearance at the end of the comic, the story makes it obvious that it is stalking Spider-Man the entire time he was chasing a group of kidnappers. This Wendigo seemed to be able to change size and become invisible; it was also reptilian in appearance and pale green in color.Amazing Spider-Man #277 In Spider-Man issues #8‚Äì12 (the \\"Perceptions\\" story arc), a Wendigo creature is blamed in the deaths of several children near Hope, British Columbia and terrorizing the town. Spider- Man's alter ego, Peter Parker, is sent to take pictures during the media frenzy that follows. Wolverine, having previous experience with Wendigo creatures and having concern for the creature's welfare, comes to the town and contacts Peter Parker directly, seeking Spider-Man's assistance. Together Spider-Man and Wolverine are able to determine the real cause of death among the children. The Wendigo in \\"Perceptions\\" has an appearance very similar to other incarnations of the Wendigo, yet seems to be a different manifestation. For example, this version of Wendigo is more vulnerable to harm than those that battled the Hulk as it suffers a significant wound from a hunter's bullet, and sustains injury when struck by a car. Additionally, it does not appear very aggressive, unless provoked, nor is it interested in consuming human flesh, feeding primarily on deer. In fact, when the Wendigo comes across the corpse of a child, the creature attempts to return the body to town instead of consuming it.Spider-Man #8 Other versions =Earth X= In the Earth X continuity, there appears a unique twist on the classic Wendigo. This variation of Wendigo is unlike the previous; while the Wendigo curse afflicts only one person at a time, an army of Wendigo is formed in this continuity, due to the curse afflicting Jamie Madrox after he chooses to eat one of his own duplicated bodies in response to the strict rationing of food that came with the declining animal population. =MC2= The Wendigo makes another appearance in the MC2 imprint of Marvel Comics, an alternate future featuring, among others, the children of existing Marvel superheroes. In an issue of Wild Thing, Hulk, Doctor Strange, Wolverine, and Wolverine's daughter Wild Thing encounter a large number of Wendigos, which turn out to be a lost cub scout troop that had eaten its scoutmaster. Doctor Strange is able to remove the curse from the children and remove their memory of the events.Wild Thing #0 =Infinity Warps= In Warp World, a copy of the Marvel Universe which was folded in half during the Infinity Wars storyline, Wendigo was fused with Tigra creating Wentigra. Greer Baptise was a detective who was mortaly wounded by a gunshot and was retrieved by a cult known as the Cat People. In order for her to survive, they offered her to eat human meat which cursed her into becoming Wentigra. She was then unwillingly cured by Weapon Hex (fusion of X-23 and Scarlet Witch).Secret Warps: Weapon Hex Annual #1. Marvel Comics In other media =Television= * Wendigo appeared in The Incredible Hulk cartoon series, with vocalizations provided by Leeza Miller McGee. As seen in the episode \\"And the Wind Cries...Wendigo!\\", the Wendigo is the result of a curse placed upon a Native American warrior. When the Wendigo captured Betty Ross, the Hulk and General Thunderbolt Ross had to work together to save Betty. After being defeated by Hulk Wendigo reverted to its human form. * Wendigo appears in Wolverine and the X-Men. This version is also shown to have horns whose bite turns others into Wendigos.

It was originally believed to have been created by a mystic curse, but it is later revealed that the creature is actually a S.H.I.E.L.D. super- soldier experiment gone wrong conducted by Fury. With Hulk's help, Wolverine used the formula-filled darts to cure the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents and defeat Wendigo.Wolverine and the X-Men ‚Äì \\"Wolverine vs. Hulk\\" * Wendigo makes a non- voiced cameo appearance on Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes as an escaping inmate of the Raft. * Wendigo makes appearances in various Marvel cartoons seen on Disney XD, voiced by Dee Bradley Baker. ** Wendigo appears in Avengers Assemble.

In the episode \\"Wendigo Apocalypse\\", the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. encounter Wolverine during their Canada vacation, where Wolverine has been bitten by the Wendigo. ** The Wendigo King appears in Ultimate Spider-Man: Web Warriors. In the episode \\"Contest of Champions\\" [Pt. 1], Collector's and Grandmaster's game of 'Last Man Standing' has Wendigo King with Kraven the Hunter and Molten Man against Spider-Man, Iron Man and Hulk. Spider-Man learned from Hulk about the Wendigo and is advised not to let it bite. Spider- Man managed to defeat Wendigo by making it fall into one of Kraven's traps and then hitting it with electrified webbing. =Film= * A pack of Wendigos appear in Iron Man and Hulk: Heroes United, watching Hulk and Abomination fight. Wendigos later battle Hulk and Iron Man in a cemetery but the Wendigos are warded off by the two Avengers. * In the unproduced X-Men: Fear the Beast, Wendigo was planned to be the main villain. This version would have been the Paul Cartier version who was depicted as a fellow scientist friend of Hank McCoy who had a similar mutation and accidentally transforms himself into the mindless Wendigo. =Video games= * The Wendigo appeared in the X-Men arcade game as the boss of Stage 3. He returns in Stage 7, as the second boss of five after Blob and before the White Queen, on Magneto's base in Asteroid M. * Wendigo appears as an early boss in X2: Wolverine's Revenge. Among the game's unlockable cut scenes is a humorous out-of-continuity moment involving the Wendigo entering a recording studio (and having trouble due to its size) and delivering its sole line (\\"WEN-DI-GO!\\") into the microphone. * In the game X-Men Origins: Wolverine, there are super-soldier monstrosities called W.E.N.D.I.G.O.

English is used as a language of instruction in all subjects. English teaching materials are adapted by the teachers to suit the difficulty level of the students. Language assistants encourage students to try out new words and structures. These situations promote natural conversation with native speakers and the students have the opportunity to practice English in practically all of the subjects. Tutorials, which take place primarily in the first year, are lessons in which only two students work with one native speaker. In that way, the students do not only receive full attention, but also experience their own language skills more directly. Student-centered work with authentic English resources is among the most common methods applied from the very beginning.

It is owned by Townsquare Media. Its studios and offices are located in Ewing and its broadcast tower is located near the Quaker Bridge Mall in Lawrence Township in Mercer County, New Jersey at (). History The station went on the air on August 27, 1962, as WBUD-FM. Its call sign subsequently changed in 1967 to WBJH, which stood for Bill and Joy Hardin, the son and daughter-in-law of the owner. The station's call sign changed to WTRT in 1979 and rebranded as \\"The New T-101 FM\\". In 1980, the station's call sign was changed to WKXW-FM, under its new owner Fidelity Communications. It was playing a hot adult contemporary format as \\"The All New Kix 101 & A 1/2 FM\\" and later \\"Kix 101.5\\". By the late 80s, the station evolved into more of a gold-based adult contemporary format. Its weekend Saturday oldies show evolved into an all oldies format from the 1950s through early 70s on overnights and weekends before the change to its current weekday talk format, which came in 1990 when it was sold to Press Communications. The sale to Millennium Radio Group took place in 2001. On March 1, 1990 at 5pm, ‚ÄúNew Jersey 101.5‚Äù, conceived by Sabo Media CEO, Walter Sabo, became the first full-time FM Talk station in America targeted for a younger audience. Mark Sheppard, who later went to middays, kicked off the format playing Bill Haley & The Comets' \\"Rock Around The Clock\\". Since the 1990s, the station has a talk and news format during the week, with oldies music on the overnights and weekend. Initially, the oldies format was 1960s-based with a few pre-1964 oldies and a 1970s oldie or two each hour. By the early-to-mid-1990s, more 1970s music was added and by the early-2000s, 1980s music from 1980-1982 was added occasionally. Between 2000 and 2005, music from between 1986 and 1989 was added to the lineups. Gradually, at the same time, songs from 1964 and older were gradually reduced in the late-1990s and gone by 2000. In September 2007, 1960s music was removed from the \\"60s, 70s, and 80s\\" weekend music programming ID, and nearly all 1960s music had been removed from the playlist. However, in May 2012, \\"60s\\" was added back to the weekend music programming ID, coinciding with a limited but steady increase in music airplay focusing on select titles by well-known artists. In the mid-to-late-1990s, music was ended on weekday overnights and now airs strictly on weekends and maybe some holidays. The station has, at times, provided a simulcast on various AM and FM stations in the Atlantic City area, beyond the reach of its main transmitter. The most recent simulcast ceased in June 2009 when then-WXKW changed formats to ESPN Sports Radio. In 2011, California-based Oaktree Capital signed a deal to buy Millennium Radio Group; after taking over, Oaktree transferred the Millennium stations to Townsquare Media. =Controversies= In 2008, the station's parent company was sued by a photographer for copyright infringement, and defamation with regards to the online posting of a photocopy of a New Jersey Monthly magazine photograph. Photographer Peter Murphy sent a notice of copyright infringement to the station to remove a photo Craig Carton and Ray Rossi, which had been photocopied from a March 2006 issue of the magazine; the station also posted \\"photoshopped\\" versions of the picture that were submitted by listeners. While the station complied with the takedown request, Carton and Rossi complained on-air about Murphy's conduct, allegedly saying that Murphy was \\"not to be trusted\\" and that people \\"should avoid doing business\\" with him. Carton and Rossi also alleged that Murphy \\"was a homosexual.\\" In April 2008, Murphy brought suit for direct, contributory, and vicarious copyright infringement, violation of the DMCA, and defamation of character against Millennium Radio Group, Carton, and Rossi. The Third Circuit ruled that the station's actions did constitute both a violation of the DMCA and copyright infringement, which vacated the district court's judgment. On July 26, 2018, the station came under fire after hosts Judi Franco and Dennis Malloy referred to New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal as \\"turban man\\" while on air. The hosts were suspended for 10 days.The Latest: Sikh group says radio station should apologize - AP NEWShttps://eu.northjersey.com/story/news/new-jersey/2018/07/25/attorney- general-grewal-called-turban-man-nj-radio-hosts/838984002/ In December 2018, Judi Franco garnered controversy when called the state's \\"Move Over\\" law \\"silly\\" and unnecessary in an opinion piece she posted on the station's website under the headline \\"Dead cops make bad laws.\\" New Jersey-centric branding The station has strongly branded its New Jersey-ness, with its announcers frequently self-identifying \\"New Jersey 101.5\\" and with its bumper message intoning \\"Not New York. Not Philadelphia. Proud to be New Jersey!\\", as well as its branded New Jersey Fast Traffic and New Jersey Instant Weather. The New Jersey-centric nature of the station is emphasized in the traffic reports, in that they refer to traffic direction on bridges and tunnels as \\"entering New Jersey\\" or \\"leaving New Jersey\\" instead of the more traditional designations of \\"into the city/inbound\\" or \\"out of the city/outbound\\". As well, current temperatures of different samples of towns in New Jersey are given after the weather reports. Despite the station's branding, the 101.5 signal does not reach the majority of Cape May, Salem and Sussex Counties while the signal's coverage of Atlantic, Bergen, Cumberland and Hudson Counties is poor at best, though streaming and smart speaker (Currently only available on Alexa devices) options do allow full-state reach of the station through other means. Ratings The way WKXW has been able to maintain a strong listener base can be attributed to several factors, including: *Radio stations in New York City and Philadelphia tend to only mention New Jersey issues, news, politics, etc. in short regional rundowns outside of the most high-profile stories, if at all (for instance, state weather is mentioned by some New York and Philadelphia stations under the vague terms \\"The Beaches\\" or \\"The Jersey Shore\\" without delineation of location for those observations). For decades the station was the highest rated FM Talk station measured, according to Arbitron/Nielsen Media. *New Jersey has only two English speaking commercial television stations: Secaucus-licensed WWOR-TV (channel 9) and Wildwood-licensed WMGM-TV (channel 40), an NBC affiliate until the start of 2015 (currently a True Crime Network station owned by Univision with no breakaways from network programming). Both stations no longer have news departments or local newscasts. WMGM-TV covers the outer fringes of the Delaware Valley and Philadelphia, while WWOR-TV primarily serves the New York Tri-State Area. On July 2, 2013, traditional newscasts (which were nominally focused on New Jersey issues) on WWOR were discontinued for an outside produced interview program called Chasing New Jersey, which later took on a generic social media focus under the title Chasing News with only a vague focus on New Jerseyan issues. WMGM-TV ended their NBC affiliation on January 1, 2015 due to the 2017 Spectrum Incentive Auction. The news department was also terminated, though it remains under contract to the owners which sold off the station license, and they may relaunch it on another station. Altice USA also offers the regional cable news channel News 12 New Jersey to the subscribers of several pay-TV systems in the state. PBS member network NJTV is the only remaining television operation with a New Jersey-focused newscast, but was converted to private ownership from state backing in July 2011 under Chris Christie's campaign promises to cut state expenses, and is currently operated by Newark-licensed WNET (operating from a New York City base), which also airs the NJTV newscasts on WNET itself for Northern New Jersey. Smaller independent stations such as WMBC-TV, WMGM-TV and WACP also have newscasts to serve local audiences of Northern and Southern New Jersey, respectively, except WMBC-TV's news also focuses on New York and Fairfield County, Connecticut, but SNJ Today News was cancelled in February 2019, due to budget issues, SNJ Today was subsequently sold off to the Hope Loft non-profit in Cumberland County, New Jersey. Local news will return to South Jersey in October 2020, from New Jersey News Network on WNWT-LD 37. There was also WOND radio news at 6 PM and SJNtv, which disbanded in July 2020. Townsquare News Network The station is the flagship broadcasting arm of the Townsquare New Jersey News Network as heard on twelve radio stations throughout the state. The network consists of WOBM-FM in Toms River, WOBM-AM in Lakewood, WCHR-FM in Manahawkin, WJLK-FM in Asbury Park, WADB-AM in Tinton Falls, WFPG-FM in Atlantic City, WSJO-FM in Egg Harbor City, WPUR-FM in Atlantic City, and WENJ in Atlantic City. Various bureaus throughout the state share stories with the Ewing headquarters. Format The station's proprietary format was created in 1990. It was idea of Sabo Media CEO Walter Sabo. Sabo, a former NBC and ABC executive, branded the station, built its approach to call-in radio and gave the station its Jersey-centric point of view. His initiatives were carried out by Jay Sorensen and Perry Michael Simon, with the help of Press Broadcasting chief Bob McAllan and general manager John Dziuba. Subsequent program directors include Leigh Jacobs and Eric Johnson.

Initially founded as the Bats Theatre Company in 1976, then established in its current form around 1988, it has seen the development of many performing arts talents of New Zealand. History = Building = The building that BATS now occupies was built in 1923. According to the BATS website, it was originally built to be the Oddfellows Britannia Lodge for the Manchester Unity Oddfellows building, then was purchased by the Savage Club in 1944 and used as a performance venue and as a dance hall, before being bought in the 1970s by the Royal Antediluvian Order of Buffaloes (RAOB) to serve as the site of their lodge temple. Prior to becoming Bats Theatre, the performance venue was known as Unity Theatre. = Initial formation = The Bats Theatre Company was founded in 1976 by Rodney Bane and David Austin. BATS is an acronym of \\"Bane Austin Touring Society\\". The building became the permanent home of the Bats Theatre Company in 1978 and the venue was renamed Bats Theatre in 1979. BATS operated its theatre space in the lower floor, while the ROAB continued to own the building and hold meetings upstairs of the theatre space. By the 1980s, Bane and Austin had moved on to other things, and the BATS venue had become simply a space that could be leased. According to playwright Ken Duncum, BATS Theatre in the 1980s \\"existed as a place that could be rented for 60 dollars a day ‚Äì they didn't mind what you did in it\\". = Creation of current form = BATS was established in its present form by Simon Bennett and Simon Elson either in 1984, 1988, or 1989. BATS began as a venue for the work of young and emerging writers, directors and actors, many of whom were graduates of Toi Whakaari, New Zealand's National Drama School. BATS states that its fundamental philosophy is to build a new young audience for theatre by presenting diverse, relevant and challenging performance work, and that it focuses on being accessible for both its audience and incoming theatre companies, giving support to many developing arts practitioners and new New Zealand work. According to a 2002 theatre compendium, nearly all the productions at BATS had been New Zealand works. = Renovations and upgrades = In 2011, the ROAB decided to sell the building, asking a price of $1.9 million, potentially leaving the theatre without a home. BATS attempted to purchase the building but was unable to raise the funds. The building was purchased by film director Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh later that year with the intent to provide a stable home for the theatre. After the sale, the building underwent extensive renovation and earthquake strengthening, and was closed from February 2013 to November 2014. The renovations included adding two more performances spaces and a rehearsal area, which included taking over space formerly used by the ROAB. During the renovations BATS relocated to a temporary theatre space on the corner of Cuba Street and Dixon Street. This space was branded BATS: Out of Site and had a 78-seat venue and bar. = COVID-19 response = The theatre closed on 19 March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. During its closure, it presented some live shows streamed over the internet. It has since reopened.  Venue  BATS Theatre is at 1 Kent Terrace in the suburb of Mount Victoria. The venue has three performance spaces (seating 86, up to 80, and up to 40 people), a rehearsal space, green room, and dressing room, and a bar. According to a 2011 article, the theatre employed five full-time staff. Works Most of the productions at BATS Theatre are New Zealand works. Ninety per cent of its annual programme of 60 to 70 shows are New Zealand and world premieres. BATS is largely funded by Creative New Zealand and Wellington City Council. = Notable performances = Many productions which started at BATS have gone on to national and international success, including many significant new New Zealand plays. The farce The Sex Fiend (1989) by Stephen Sinclair and Danny Mulheron and Ken Duncum's Blue Sky Boys (1991) received national recognition as did Verbatim (1993) by Miranda Harcourt, Frangipani Perfume (1998) by Makerita Urale, Banging Cymbal, Clanging Gong (2002) by Jo Randerson, Vula (2002) directed by Nina Nawalowalo, And What Remains (2006) by Miria George and Apollo 13: Mission Control (2008) by Kip Chapman. Krishnan's Dairy by Jacob Rajan, which premiered at BATS in 1997, was announced for adaptation into a feature film. Other successful New Zealand names in theatre and comedy have presented early works at BATS, including Flight of the Conchords, Duncan Sarkies, Rhys Darby, So You're a Man, The Naked Samoans and MƒÅori playwrights Hone Kouka and Riwia Brown. The comedy play Benedict Cumberbatch Must Die written by Abby Howells, premiered at BATS temporary 'Out of Site' venue in June 2014.http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/CU1406/S00128/perfect-benedict- cumberbatch-inspires-new-show.htm = Experimental theatre = The venue continues to be a home to much of Wellington's young and experimental theatrical talent, with titles such as On the Conditions and Possibilities of Helen Clark Taking Me as Her Young Lover, The Intricate Art of Actually Caring and After Kafka. BATS frequently hosts two or three different plays in one night. = Annual events = The Young and Hungry Season is run annually at BATS. According to Young and Hungry, the programme started in 1994 at BATS and provides 15‚Äì25 year olds with a platform to create and experience theatre, and has expanded to include works in Auckland. BATS also runs the STAB season annually. BATS hosts shows each year as part of the annual New Zealand Fringe Festival. The BATS website claims that a founder of BATS, Simon Elson, created the festival and that it was originally called the BATS Fringe Fest. BATS also hosts shows in the annual NZ Comedy Festival.

One-man bands also often sing while they perform. The simplest type of \\"one-man band\\" is a singer accompanying themselves on acoustic guitar and playing a harmonica mounted in a metal \\"harp rack\\" below the mouth. This approach is often taken by buskers and folk music singer-guitarists. More complicated setups may include wind instruments strapped around the neck, a large bass drum mounted on the musician's back with a beater which is connected to a foot pedal, cymbals strapped between the knees or triggered by a pedal mechanism, tambourines and maracas tied to the limbs, and a stringed instrument strapped over the shoulders (e.g., a banjo, ukulele or guitar). Since the development of Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) in the 1980s, musicians have also incorporated chest-mounted MIDI drum pads, foot-mounted electronic drum triggers, and electronic pedal keyboards into their set-ups. In the 2000s and 2010s, the availability of affordable digital looping pedals has enabled singer-musicians to record a riff or chord progression and then solo or sing over it. History and meanings =Live instruments= Pipe and taborers, from the 13th-century illuminated manuscript, Cantigas de Santa Maria The earliest known records of multiple musical instruments being played at the same time date from the 13th century, and were the pipe and tabor. The pipe was a simple three-holed flute that could be played with one hand; the tabor is more commonly known today as a snare drum. This type of playing can still be heard in parts of rural France, in England and Spain. An Elizabethan-era woodcut shows a clown playing the pipe and tabor. An 1820s watercolour painting shows a one-man band with a rhythm-making stick, panpipes around his neck and a bass drum and tambourine beside him. Henry Mayhew's history of London street life in the 1840s and 1850s described a blind street performer who played bells, the violin and accordions.Henry Mayhew, London Labor and the London Poor, (Dover Publications, Inc., New York, 1968), Vol. 3, p. 161. Reprint of 1861-62 edition published by Griffin, Bohn and Company. Guitarist Jim Garner played guitar with his hands and triangle with his feet, and Will Blankenship of the Blankenship Family of North Carolina played harmonica, autoharp and triangle in shows during the 1930s. In the 1940s, entertainer and clown Benny Dougal used a crude \\"stump fiddle\\" (a single string stretched on a stick) with a footpedal-operated pair of cymbals. Blues singers such as \\"Daddy Stovepipe\\" (Johnny Watson) would sing, play guitar, and stomp their feet for rhythm, or used a foot pedal to play bass drum or cymbal. One of the earliest modern exponents of multiple instruments was Jesse Fuller. Fuller developed a foot-operated bass instrument which he called the \\"footdella\\", which had six bass strings which were struck by hammers. In \\"one-man-band\\" shows, Fuller would use his \\"footdella\\", a footpedal-operated \\"sock\\" (bass drum), a homemade neck harness (for a harmonica, kazoo and microphone), and a 12-string guitar. Fate Norris, of the Skillet Lickers, a hillbilly string band of the 1920s and early 1930s developed a geared mechanical contraption with footpedals that enabled him to play guitar, bells, bass fiddle, fiddle, autoharp and mouth harp. Joe Barrick, who was born in Oklahoma in 1922, wanted a way of accompanying himself on fiddle, so he built a contraption with a guitar neck on a board with footpedals to operate the notes. Subsequent versions of this \\"piatar\\" also had bass guitar and banjo necks and a snare drum which are played by foot-operated hammers. To change notes on the guitar-family instruments, a foot treadle operates a mechanical fretting device. Two notable one-man blues bands active in Memphis in the 1950s were Doctor Ross and Joe Hill Louis, playing guitar, harmonica and bass drum/high-hat. A musician in London performs on electric guitar and a small drum kit. The simple guitar and harmonica combination (as used by such musicians as Tex Williams, Anton Newcombe, Jimmy Reed, Bob Dylan, Neil Young, and Ray Dorset of Mungo Jerry) is so common now that it is rarely considered to be a one-man band. British-born Don Partridge made the classic one-man band outfit (bass drum on the back, guitar and harmonica) famous in the streets of Europe, and was an early busker to enter the Top Ten of the UK Singles Chart, with his hit singles \\"Rosie\\" and \\"Blue Eyes\\" in 1968. Modern one-man bands include such performers as Ben de la Garza, Hasil Adkins and Sterling Magee, better known as \\"Mister Satan,\\" from Satan and Adam. Vic Ellis of Sussex :\\"The one-man band exists, in all its uniqueness and independence, as a most elusive yet persistent musical tradition. As a category of musicianship it transcends cultural and geographic boundaries, spans stylistic limits, and defies conventional notions of technique and instrumentation. Defined simply as a single musician playing more than one instrument at the same time, it is an ensemble limited only by the mechanical capabilities and imaginative inventiveness of its creator, and despite its generally accepted status as an isolated novelty, it is a phenomenon with some identifiable historical continuity.\\" =Studio recording= The term \\"one-man band\\" is also colloquially used to describe a performer who plays every instrument on a recorded song one at a time, and then mixes them together in a multitrack studio. While this approach to recording is more common in electronica genres such as techno and acid house than traditional rock music, some rock performers such as Joe Hill Louis, Stevie Wonder, Prince, Lenny Kravitz, Paul McCartney, Kevin Parker, Kabir Suman, Dave Edmunds, John Fogerty, Emitt Rhodes, Todd Rundgren, Pete Townshend, Steve Winwood, Roy Wood, Nik Kershaw, and Les Fradkin have made records in which they play every instrument (one after the other). Mike Oldfield was noted for using this recording technique during the recording of his 1973 album Tubular Bells. Other examples of a one-man band in the recording studio are Dave Grohl for the first studio album by the Foo Fighters, Trent Reznor for Nine Inch Nails, jazz piano player Keith Jarrett for his album No End, Peter Tagtgren for Pain (musical project), Chris Carrabba for the first two albums released by Dashboard Confessional, Varg Vikernes for Burzum and Billy Corgan for Smashing Pumpkins since 2009. Nash the Slash (1948-2014) played all instruments on his recordings. He also played solo concerts from 1975 to 2012, using synchronized drum machines and synthesizers as he plays either an electric violin or electric mandolin. Some artists record and mixed their music in a multitrack studio and synchronize it with video multitrack video playing on all instruments, creating a one-man band illusion. One-man bands in this context have become more common in extreme metal, especially black metal, where a number of bands apart from Burzum consist of only one member. Such artists include Nargaroth, Xasthur, Falkenbach, Arckanum, Nortt, Horde, and others. While most of these bands do not play live, some such as Nargaroth hire additional musicians for live performances. \\"One-woman band\\" is not used very often in the vernacular, but women have increasingly had a presence as musicians in most forms of music. Examples of one-woman bands are Merrill Garbus, who performs as Tune-Yards and plays every instrument on all recordings , and Edith Crash who creates \\"dark and haunting, drawn-out melodies\\"Your Guide To The 2016 Echo Park Rising Festival . =Live looping= Chris Lejeune 2007 In the 2000s, as digital looping pedals became widely available, performers have been able to use a mixture of previously recorded music, delay effects, and looping devices in live performances of everything from beatboxing to classical violin. Live looping performers create layered looped accompaniment for musical solos that are sung or played later in the song. Using this technology, a simultaneous combination of various instruments and vocals, or one instrument played in different ways, can be created over the course of one musical piece which rivals the sounds of studio recording. Notable artists who incorporate this technique live include Ed Sheeran, Keller Williams, That 1 Guy, Zach Deputy, and KT Tunstall. Rick Walker is another looper and multi-instrumentalist who has organized looping festivals, including a long-running annual one in Santa Cruz, California, and others in various countries. Developments Hasil Adkins performing at Seidel Lanes as part of the \\"Rock n' Bowl\\" concert series presented by the Roots Cafe in Baltimore, Maryland. Since the development of Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) in the 1980s, musicians have also incorporated chest-mounted MIDI drum pads, foot-mounted electronic drum triggers. Some \\"one-man bands\\" use organ-style pedal keyboards to perform basslines. A small number of MIDI enthusiasts use custom-made MIDI controllers connected to different parts of their bodies to trigger music on synthesizers. Custom-made MIDI controllers range from wind-operated controllers to small triggers mounted on the arms or feet. At a certain point, the use of body MIDI controllers may come to resemble performance art, because the musical sounds are triggered by the performer assuming certain poses or dancing. One of the pioneers of this performance art is McRorie Live Electronic, who uses drum sensors on his shoes, tom sensors on his chest, separate rhythm and bass keyboards and vocal lead instruments. With the use of 2000s-era digital loop pedals, which can record and then repeat a short musical phrase, performers can play a riff or groove and then solo over the repeated loop. An example of this technique is by Canadian musician Jay Robinson who creates full band arrangements live. A one-man band busking in Calgary, Alberta With the rise in availability and affordability of electronic devices came innovation with the traditional acoustic \\"one-man band\\" instruments. One example is the Farmer Musical Instrument Co! based in the US. Pete Farmer sells acoustic foot-played percussion instruments that allow musicians to play a range of traditional drum kit sounds, the foot drum Deluxe, or tambourine and shaker pedals for tapping out simple beats. With the development of technology and prominence of video sharing sites like YouTube, musicians are now able to record each instrument individually and then compile a video as if it were all done in real time. Non-musical meanings The term is also used in a general sense to refer to a person who runs a small business alone (a sole-proprietorship business), particularly if the operation requires that person to assume multiple different roles, in a manner akin to the way a musical \\"one-man band\\" performer plays different instruments and sings at the same time. In some small businesses, the owner also produces the product or service, markets it and delivers it to clients. In TV news, the phrase refers to a reporter who also functions as her own cameraperson via the use of a tripod. In 2011, professional wrestler Heath Slater climbed to fame with the nickname \\"The One- Man Rock Band\\", which was later changed to \\"The One-Man Southern Rock Band\\" in reference to him being billed from West Virginia.

Pierre Perret resides in the city of Nangis.  Biography  He spent a long part of his childhood in the caf√© which his parents owned, where he learned to work with jargon and slang. At the age of 14 he signed up to the conservatoire de musique de Toulouse and to a dramatic arts institute. But he wasn't admitted to the Conservatoire national sup√©rieur de musique et de danse de Paris because he had some problems with military justice during his military service.Sax, Mule & Co, Jean-Pierre Thiollet, H & D, Paris, 2004, p. 56-57. In the meantime, he set up his first band of four musicians in his own name, with whom he played at events throughout the region. In 1957, he was snapped up by Eddie Barclay who signed him on. It was in the studio of Barclay where he met his future wife, Simone Mazaltarim. In 1958, Perret carried on touring round Parisian cabaret bars and crossed France and Africa as a part of the American group, The Platters. In November that year, a pleurisy forced him to take two years off in a sanatorium. A master of the subtleties of the French language and French slang (he even rewrote some of Jean de La Fontaine's fables), his songs are often cheeky (for example Le zizi (The willy)), asking questions in a seemingly naive child's tone, but has written more serious political songs, such as La b√™te est revenue, La petite kurde, Vert de Col√®re or Lily. In 1995, he recorded in duet with Sophie Darel the French song Ma√Ætre Pierre for the album C'√©tait les Ann√©es Bleues. He participated in the committee for the simplification of the administrative language (COSLA).

The Act of Emancipation had slightly improved the position of the Catholics. However the campaign for Repeal of the Union led by Daniel O'Connell had failed. The struggle for reform of land ownership had taken center stage. Land reform was important as it directly affected the lives of ordinary people. However, there was still a need to create meaningful political structures which would have introduced a measure of self-government to Ireland. The form of these structures was a matter of division and debate. The Central Board scheme was developed by Joseph Chamberlain in 1884-1885. This would have offered a form of local government which it is arguedLyons, 1974 would have fallen considerably short of legislative independence. The exact structure of the Board was subject to negotiation, however it was proposed to be indirectly elected with membership drawn from the existing county councils Comerford, 1996 and powers mainly over local government issues. Chamberlain had received some support from the Catholic bishops. His contact with Charles Parnell was ironically Captain O'Shea who led him to believe that this would be acceptable as a final settlement. However Chamberlain's proposal was too radical for Gladstone who had not yet accepted the merits of Home Rule for Ireland. Lack of support led him to tender his resignation. Later in 1886 he was an opponent of the Home Rule Bill. Rejection of his Central Board scheme may have created personal feelings of bitterness towards the Irish Parliamentary Party. Joseph Chamberlain was a leading Liberal who had been a successful businessman and had led the reform of the administration of the City of Birmingham, England. He also served in the important post of President of the Board of Trade. Strengths All Ireland proposal, would have given good experience to Irish politicians and a Forum as an alternative to the parliamentary delaying tactics utilized in struggle for Home Rule. Weaknesses Powers to be devolved were strictly limited and mere local autonomy would have been opposed by militants.

Distilleria Liquore Strega in Benevento, Italy. Its distinctive yellow color comes from the presence of saffron. Strega is bottled at 80 proof (40% ABV), which is an alcohol content comparable to most hard liquors, but it has a sweetness and viscosity typical of liqueurs. Among its approximately 70 herbal ingredients are mint and fennel, giving it a complex flavor with minty and coniferous notes. Strega is considered a digestif. It is used for flavoring torta caprese, a type of cake.  History  Strega was developed in 1860 by the father‚Äìson team of Carmine Vincenzo Alberti and Giuseppe Alberti. The company experienced growth until Giuseppe Alberti's death in 1894.http://www.strega.it/pagina.php?codice=33 Alberti's four sons Ugo, Vincenzo, Francesco and Luigi took control. The company received a royal warrant of appointment to the Italian King. Strega became well known for its colourful and artistic advertising.http://www.strega.it/pubblicita_liquori/48_strega_and_advertising.html# One poster was designed in 1906 by in the art nouveau style.http://ecx.images- amazon.com/images/I/51kPuRkDC1L._SY355_.jpg Strega is the Italian word for \\"witch\\" and since legends of witchcraft at Benevento date back to the time of the Lombard invasion, it was a natural choice of name for the liqueur. The liqueur is sometimes called \\"the witch\\" in the English-speaking world.  Strega Prize  The Premio Strega (Strega Prize), the most prestigious literary award in Italy today, was founded in 1947 by Guido Alberti, then owner of the company, together with his friends the writer Maria Bellonci and her husband Goffredo.  Awards  The San Francisco World Spirits Competition, one of several international spirit ratings organizations, has evaluated Strega liqueur on three occasions since 2005. The ratings organization gave the spirit gold medals in 2005 and 2011 and a silver medal in 2008.

The inhabitants are called Castelsarrasinois. It is the second most populous commune in Tarn-et-Garonne after Montauban. History The first certain evidence of the town dates from 961. The name, Castel Sarracenum, would indicate that the castle was built in the Saracen era. The early history of the city is marked by wars; against the English until the end of the 12th century, then the Albigensian Crusade during the first part of the 13th century, and then the Shepherd's Crusade of 1320 that resulted in the deaths of many Jews in the city. The region was much affected by the Hundred Years' War, and again, during the wars of religion of the 16th century, the city's largely Catholic population was in frequent conflict with the generally Protestant surrounding region. The region is calmer during the following centuries, up to the time of the French Revolution. Castelsarrasin was the finish of Stage 17 in the 2007 Tour de France.

It is preserved in two versions of which one (Hr√≥Flat) is found in Flatey Book (GKS 1005 fol 344-348, ca 1387-1395) and the second one (Hr√≥ AM 557 4¬∞) in the Sk√°lholtsb√≥k (AM 557 4¬∞ 41r-42v, ca 1420-1450) in Copenhagen. In the version of √ìl√°fs saga helga which is found in the Flatey Book, it is inserted together with Styrbjarnar √æ√°ttr Sv√≠akappa in the description of Olaf Haraldsson's wooing of the Swedish princess Ingegerd Olofsdotter. Their purpose appears to be to present the Swedish court, its traditions and √ûorgn√Ωr the Lawspeaker. Synopsis =Building a fortune= He had one blue eye and one black eye, and he was a skilled smith and trader. However, each time his trade had made him wealthy, he went to sea and lost it all. The third time, he went to king Sweyn and asked him to be his business partner. The king consented although his court advised him not to deal with such an unlucky man as Hr√≥i. However, the king's good luck prevailed over Hr√≥i's back luck and Hr√≥i became a wealthy man, and one day he shared the wealth with the king and finished their partnership, against the king's wishes who'd rather he stay at the court and marry. =The framing= Then he went to Sweden and struck a deal with Helgi a red-haired courtier of king Eric the Victorious. However, after the deal had been made and the goods delivered, Hr√≥i came to fetch the merchandise, and discovered that Helgi had tricked him. Helgi said that he had delivered the goods, but Hr√≥i had not been there to fetch them and so Helgi had taken them back. Helgi also stated that Hr√≥i had broken the king's law by not guarding his goods, so that a thief might steal them. Then Hr√≥i met Helgi's brother √ûorgils who took Hr√≥i's knife claiming that Hr√≥i had taken it from him in Normandy. Then he met Helgi's second brother, √ûorir, a one-eyed man who claimed that Hr√≥i had taken one of his eyes from him at Sams√∏ with magic and that this was why Hr√≥i had different eyes. √ûorir then said that Hr√≥i was to be at the thing and to be sentenced by the king for stealing his eye and for stealing his brother's knife. The two men then parted, but the next day Hr√≥i overheard some men saying that Hr√≥i was about to be before the king and that the king always judged in favour of Helgi and his brothers. He then met a beautiful girl called Sigrbj√∂rg who had heard of him as Hr√≥i the Fool, and she said that she was the daughter of √ûorgn√Ωr the Lawspeaker and that he was no friend of Helgi and his brothers. She then invited Hr√≥i to hide in her bower and to listen what was said. Hr√≥i hid and heard √ûorgn√Ωr the Lawspeaker arrive. √ûorgn√Ωr asked his daughter if she know whether Hr√≥i would be at the thing the next day. He also asked her why she sighed so heavily and guessed that she had met Hr√≥i and discovered that he was a good man. √ûorgn√Ωr said that he would be at the thing the next day and see to it that justice was done against the three brothers. When √ûorgn√Ωr was gone, Sigrbj√∂rg told Hr√≥i to join her father the next day. =Before the court of the Swedish king= The next day Hr√≥i accompanied √ûorgn√Ωr the Lawspeaker to the court at Uppsala and √ûorgn√Ωr presided the interrogation. On the accusation from Helgi, Hr√≥i answered that he had bought everything that was in the warehouse, but Helgi had not kept his part of the bargain since he had not delivered the moths and the other bugs in it. Consequently, he had the right to have Helgi as his thrall, and this was seconded by √ûorgn√Ωr. On √ûorgil's accusation that Hr√≥i had stealen his knife in Normandy, Hr√≥i retorted that he remembered this man and that he had murdered his brother Sigurd. √ûorgn√Ωr stated that such men deserved death. Concerning √ûorir's accusation of the stolen eye, Hr√≥i suggested that the stolen eye be removed from his head, and the last eye from √ûorir's head. Then the eyes would be weighed and if they weighed equally it would be proven that they came from the same head, and that Hr√≥i had stolen √ûorir's eye. If √ûorir would not agree to this, he would be proven a liar in this case and in others. However, √ûorir did not agree on this procedure, and so √ûorgn√Ωr stated that those three men were wicked and unmanly and had too long weaved webs of lies around them. They had also too long been trusted by the king, and that there was no longer any other decision by the king to make than to give the three brothers as the property of Hr√≥i. King Eric the Victorious agreed. Hr√≥i then sentenced √ûorgils and √ûorir to death and banished Helgi from Sweden for life. =What happened afterwards= Hr√≥i asked √ûorgn√Ωr for his daughter's hand and married her. He returned to Denmark with his goods and told Swein Forkbeard about the events and gave him many Swedish goods. Hr√≥i and the king would remain friends for life. However, when Hr√≥i returned to Sweden he found his father-in-law √ûorgn√Ωr the Lawspeaker dead, but his son √ûorgn√Ωr had succeeded him as lawspeaker, and this √ûorgn√Ωr was the wisest of men. Hr√≥i and his brother-in-law √ûorgn√Ωr the Lawspeaker shared the inheritance in concord and Hr√≥i was considered by all to be an excellent man. Many Swedish noble families were descended from him.

Sanjan is located around 70 km from the Valsad city. It is the earliest settlement of the Parsis in India. Geography Sanjan Bandar, also called old Sanjan is the initial settlement. Sanjan is situated on the banks of Varoli River. Transport The town is served by Sanjan railway station which lies on New Delhi‚ÄìMumbai main line. The nearest airport is Surat Airport in Surat. History Sanjan is believed to have been founded by Zoroastrian refugees who sought asylum in Gujarat in 698 AD. A widely believed legend is that the Zoroastrians were offered a filled pot of milk by Jadi Rana, the King of Sanjan to signify that his kingdom was full. In response, the Zoroastrians poured sugar into the milk without spilling any milk, stating they would adapt to the kingdom and cause no disorder, to which the King agreed. Those Zoroastrians, whose descendants are today known as the Parsis (since they came from Pars/Persia), are thought to have named the settlement after Sanjan in Greater Khorasan, the city of their origin. Sanjan was captured by Mahmud Begada of the Delhi Sultanate in the 1480s. Later, Sanjan was captured and became part of the Portuguese Northern Provinces until it was captured by the Marathas under Chimnaji Appa in his campaign against the Portuguese (1733‚Äì39). Sanjan fell to British forces during 18th century. It became part of Bombay State upon independence of India, and later became part of Gujarat. =Excavations= From 2002 to 2004, the World Zarathushti Cultural Foundation (WZCF) (Mumbai) and the Indian Archaeological Society (IAS) (New Delhi), conducted three seasons of archaeological excavations at the ancient mounds immediately North and East of Sanjan Bandar. The excavation Directors were (late) Dr S P Gupta of the IAS and Dr Kurush F Dalal. Three years (2002, 2003 & 2004) of excavations have revealed a large city (approx 2 km x 1 km) on the banks of the Varoli Creek/River which was occupied from the 8th to the 13th centuries AD. The houses were made of burnt brick and had solid stone foundations, they were equipped with sophisticated drainage in the form of adjacent Ringwells. That the city was involved directly in the trade activities of the Indian Ocean littoral is evidenced by the large amounts of West Asian and Chinese ceramics as also by the numerous numismatic finds and the large amounts of West Asian glassware and beads. West Asian ceramics identified for the first time include Sassanian-Islamic Turquoise Glazed Ware, sgraffito ware, Kashan Lustre ware, Tin glazed ware and other associated wares like Celadon. Chinese wares like eggshell ware, Yeuh and Qingbai porcelains and glazed stoneware were also recovered though in smaller numbers. The ceramics were studied and published by Dr. Rukshana Nanji. The published report is the first volume in the Sanjan Excavation Report Series. The glass was studied by Ms. Rhea Mitra-Dalal. Human remains were studied by Dr Veena Mushrif-Tripathi and published as the second volume in the series. The site has also yielded the first definitive proof of Parsi (Zoroastrian) occupation at Sanjan in the form of a dokhma or Tower of Silence (a uniquely Zoroastrian mortuary structure). The excavations and explorations have also yielded interesting art historical data in the form of Hindu (Shilahara Period) sculptural and structural remains.

The Fang are also the largest ethnic group in Gabon, making up about a quarter of the population. In other countries, in the regions they live, they are one of the most significant and influential ethnic groups.Equatorial Guinea People and Society; Cameroon People and Society; Gabon People and Society; CIA Factbook Language The Fang people speak the Fang language, also known as Pahouin or Pamue or Pangwe. The language is a Southern Bantu language belonging to the Niger-Congo family of languages.Fang, Ethnologue The Fang language is similar and intelligible with languages spoken by Beti-Pahuin peoples, namely the Beti people to their north and the Bulu people in central. Their largest presence is in the southern regions, up to the Ogoou√© River estuary where anthropologists refer them also as \\"Fang proper\\". They have preserved their history largely through a musical oral tradition. Many Fang people are fluent in Spanish, French, German and English, a tradition of second language they developed during the Spanish colonial rule in Equatorial Guinea, the French colonial rule in Gabon and the German-later-French colonial rule in Cameroon. History The Fang people are relatively recent migrants into the Equatorial Guinea, and many of them moved from central Cameroon in the 19th century. Early ethnologists conjectured them to be Nilotic peoples from the upper Nile area, but a combination of evidence now places them to be of Bantu origins who began moving back into Africa around the seventh or eighth century possibly because of invasions from the north and the wars of West Africa and sub-Saharan Africa. Their migration may be related to an attempt to escape the violence of slave raiding by the Hausa people, but this theory has been contested. The Fang people were victims of the large transatlantic and trans-Saharan slave trade between the 16th and 19th century. They were stereotyped as cannibals by slave traders and missionaries, in part because human skulls and bones were found in open or in wooden boxes near their villages, a claim used to justify violence against them and their enslavement. When their villages were raided, thousands of their wooden idols and villages were burnt by the slave raiders. Later ethnologists who actually spent time with the Fang people later discovered that the Fang people were not cannibalistic, the human bones in open and wooden boxes were of their ancestors, and were Fang people's method of routine remembrance and religious reverence for their dead loved ones. Society and culture A head dress of the Fang people with embedded artwork. They have a patrilineal kinship social structure. The villages have been traditionally linked through lineage. They are exogamous, particularly on the father's side. Polygamy was accepted in the culture of the Fang people. The independence of villages from each other is notable, and they are famed for their knowledge of animals, plants and herbs in the Equatorial forests they live in. They are traditionally farmers and hunters, but became major cocoa farmers during the colonial era. Under French colonial rule, they converted to Christianity. However, after independence their interest in their own traditional religion, called Biere, also spelled Byeri, has returned, and many practice syncretic ideas and rites. One of the syncretic traditions among Fang people is called Bwiti, a monotheistic religion that celebrates Christian Easter but over four days with group dancing, singing and psychedelic drinks.J.

Their wooden masks and idol carvings are on display at numerous museums of the world. Discovery of Fang artwork was source of inspiration for much of the European avant-garde artwork created during the 20th century. Much of the art is either used for their masquerades, or function as reliquaries and effigies. All are primarily made by the men of the village. There is reason to believe that many of these reliquaries were made during the Fang's migration as a form of burial which was also portable. Reliquary guardian head, Fang peoples, Gabon. Late 19th to early 20th century. Wood, metal, oil patina = Wooden heads = One of the most popular art forms attributed to the Fang culture are the wooden reliquary heads, many of which contain the skull or bones of ancestors. There is a characteristic heart- shaped face and large bulbous forehead. The heads are very abstract and focus on geometric form and covered in a black patina. Some appear to 'cry', which is streaks of resin made from a mixture of palm oil and other seed oils. They are tied to the ideas of welfare and social power. There is a characteristic heart shaped, concave face with a large bulbous forehead. The heads are often tied to welfare and social power. Heads are an effigy and can be affixed to a wooden reliquary box/barrel. The bones and skulls of deceased leaders are kept in cylindrical boxes that are decorated with wooden sculptured figures. These bones are believed to be have special powers that protect the well-being of the community. The bones are always within the possession of the deceased leader's family and it's kept hidden from the eyes of the uninitiated and of women. = Reliquary figures = Throughout Gabon, these figures serve as talisman or guardian to protect the remains of ancestors. Known as bieri, byeri or mwan bian, these reliquary figures widely range in style, but most common characteristics are: * short, rounded body parts * long torso * a large head * a prominent forehead and concave face Some earlier figures had cavities in the abdomen as a place to store bones of ancestors. The figures aren't completed until they are ceremoniously presented and rubbed with palm oil. Members of the community will continually visit figures and rub them with oil so they maintain their protective powers. 417x417px It was during colonization that many of these reliquaries had to be destroyed due to missionary and government pressure.  Music  Music plays a central to the oral history of the Fang. The mvet is a musical instrument popular in the Fang society, which is played by the mbomo mvet. The instrument is a chordophone with attached resonators. Often, one resonator is regarded as 'male' and the other as 'female'. Some mvet come with two, three, or even five strings. To become a master mbomo mvet takes years of dedication and sacrifice. The mbomo mvet will often pass through villages once a month to play at the council house where all members of the village will gather to be entertained. Members of the community participate by keeping time while the mbomo mvet plays the sings praises to the ancestors. See also * Beti-Pahuin peoples References =Bibliography= * James W.

It sits at the bottom of Grand Canyon, on the east side of Bright Angel Creek, a little over half a mile north of the Creek's confluence with the Colorado River. Opened in 1922, Phantom Ranch is a member of Historic Hotels of America, the official program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. History The site of Phantom Ranch and the areas around it were used by various Native American peoples for millennia. Numerous artifacts, including split-twig figurines carbon dated at 4000 years old, have been discovered in nearby caves. Puebloan peoples built pit houses and a ceremonial kiva in the area around AD 1050, and likely survived by hunting and growing corn, beans, and squash. Paiute and Havasupai people also inhabited Grand Canyon for many centuries and probably visited the area, although no direct evidence of this has yet been discovered. The earliest recorded visit by European Americans took place in 1869, when John Wesley Powell and his company camped at the beach at the confluence of Bright Angel Creek and the Colorado River. It was Powell who gave Bright Angel Creek its name, contrasting its clear, sparkling waters with the turbulent, salty, muddy waters of a creek he and his men had passed earlier and named Dirty Devil.Dirty Devil River , Bureau of Land Management Powell explored the area briefly and discovered the Puebloan ruins. In 1903, after Fran√ßois E. Matthes completed his pioneering survey work of Grand Canyon for the US Geological Survey, Edwin Woolley and other investors formed the Grand Canyon Transportation Company, hoping to develop the tourist potential of the Canyon's north rim in the same way that the Santa Fe Railroad was doing at the south rim. Woolley hired his son-in-law David Rust to improve an ancient Native American route that Matthes had used to travel down Bright Angel Creek to the Colorado River. By 1907 Rust and his crew had completed the trail work and added a small tent camp alongside the Creek at the bottom. Rust planted native willows and cottonwoods to give the camp shade, grew alfalfa (for livestock), peaches, and plums, and raised chickens and rabbits as food for guests. Theodore Roosevelt, who as president had declared Grand Canyon a National Monument in 1908, traveled down to the camp during a hunting expedition in 1913; in honor of this visit the site became known as Roosevelt Camp. Roosevelt's enthusiasm for Grand Canyon helped lead to its incorporation into the National Park System in 1919. Rust's concession for the camp was transferred to the Fred Harvey Company, which hired American architect Mary Colter to design permanent lodging for the site. Construction presented a major challenge, as all the building materials except rock had to be hauled down by mules. Colter's solution was to create buildings from on-site rock and rough-hewn wood, in an architectural style that would come to be known as National Park Service Rustic.Berke, Arnold: Mary Colter: Architect of the Southwest. p. 118. Princeton Architectural Press, 2002. Fred Harvey officials had intended to call the new lodge Roosevelt Chalet, but Coulter insisted on the more evocative \\"Phantom Ranch\\", taking the name from nearby Phantom Creek and Phantom Canyon. When the Ranch opened on November 9, 1922, it consisted of a central cooking and dining hall surrounded by three guest cabins and a caretaker's cabin; other structures, not designed by Coulter, included a barn, chicken house, rabbit run, blacksmith shop, and water reservoir. The Ranch's initial success quickly led to plans for enlargement and additional features. A small orchard and a vegetable garden were planted using some of the same land that Rust had previously cultivated. In 1925 four tent cabins, each sleeping four persons, were added, followed by a wooden bath house and an electric power generator. In 1927‚Äì28 Coulter oversaw the construction of a recreation hall, eight new cabins, and an enlargement of the dining hall. During the Great Depression the Civilian Conservation Corps made a number of upgrades to the Ranch, including a mule corral, the Trans-Canyon Telephone Line, improved plumbing and sewage systems, and a 35' x 70' pond-shaped swimming pool, fed by the waters of Bright Angel Creek. The 1930s saw the Ranch's popularity continue to grow, its isolation and relaxed atmosphere drawing many wealthy and notable guests, some of whom would stay for days or even weeks at a time. The writer Adrian Harbin, after a 1937 visit, wrote: Through the end of World War II mule riding was the main method of getting around in Grand Canyon and the most popular way for tourists to experience the views that only traveling below the rims could bring. This began to change in the late 1940s as more and more people‚Äïmany of them former soldiers who were used to walking long distances with packs on their backs‚Äïbecame interested in the idea of hiking for recreation and sight-seeing. Well into the 1950s commercial mule trips from both the south and north rims were responsible for transporting about 2/3rds of the guests that stayed at Phantom Ranch, with hikers taking any remaining space (mostly in the four tent cabins from 1925) on a first-come, first-serve basis. As the popularity of hiking continued to grow, however, the need for different priorities became apparent. During Easter weekend in 1964 nearly 1000 hikers arrived at the Ranch with the intention of spending the night, leading the National Park Service to finally establish a reservation system for the Ranch and begin looking for ways to add additional hiker accommodations. The growing crowds and a natural disaster combined to put increasing strains on the Ranch's infrastructure as the 1960s progressed. In 1966 an immense flash flood swept through the inner canyon, stranding visitors and mules at the Ranch and damaging or destroying numerous buildings and structures in the area. The flooding also uprooted many of the cottonwood trees lining the banks of Bright Angel Creek. By the time the waters receded most of nearby Bright Angel Campground had been destroyed as well. Repairs from the flood took several years to complete. The increase in visitors in this period caused recurring maintenance problems for the swimming pool which, along with more stringent hygiene regulations, led to the pool's permanent closing by the early 1970s. A sewage treatment plant, replacing the overburdened septic tanks that had been installed by the CCC in the 1930s, was completed in 1981. In June 2020, the sewage treatment plant began experiencing problems and it soon became clear that \\"critical rehabilitation\\" would be needed. The project has been estimated to take 18 to 24 months and in the meantime, usage levels in the area were reduced in order to reduce the load on the plant. Hiker dormitories, already closed since March 2020 due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, are to remain closed through 2021, along with the showers; nearby Bright Angel Campground will be limited to 50 percent capacity. Visitation levels have been much above its designed capacity and the $3 million rehabilitation is only a temporary measure; the plant will eventually need to be fully replaced. Phantom Ranch in the 21st century Phantom Ranch remains a very popular destination, and is considered one of the most difficult hotels in the United States to get reservations for. All accommodations are offered 15 months in advance via a monthly lottery system and usually sell out immediately. The site currently includes nine regular cabins which sleep 1‚Äì4 persons, four or five of which are taken almost every night by mule riders. In addition, there are two large cabins, sleeping 8‚Äì10 persons, which are used by Colorado River boat groups and big hiking parties. All cabins are equipped with bedding, a cold water sink, a toilet, liquid soap, and hand towels; cabin guests shower in the centrally located Shower House. There are also four hiker dormitories (two for men and two for women), which were built in the 1970s, replacing the four 1925 tent cabins. Each dormitory has 10 beds set up in bunks, a sink, a toilet, and a shower; bedding, towels, and soap are provided. Total capacity for the Ranch is about 90 guests per night. (The dormitories are currently closed due to both COVID social distancing restrictions and the need to upgrade the sewage treatment plant.) The dining hall, now called Phantom Ranch Canteen, serves breakfast and dinner on a strict schedule and requires advance reservations; the Canteen is open to the public during non-meal hours, offering a small variety of items including snacks, beverages, stamps, T-shirts, postcards, headlamps, and first-aid supplies. Additional facilities include the mule corral, a small amphitheater, employee housing, a ranger station (with limited emergency medical services), and a heliport. Cottonwood trees, a few of which date back to the time of Rust's tent camp, line the creek and shade the buildings. Campers from Bright Angel Campground are not allowed to use the Shower House, but may reserve meals at the Canteen. The only modes of access to and from Phantom Ranch are trails (used by both hikers and mules) and the Colorado River. The North Kaibab Trail leads 13.6 miles to the North Rim. Two trails lead to the South Rim. One is the 9.3 mile route that crosses the Silver Bridge, follows the River Trail for two miles, and then climbs the Bright Angel Trail to Grand Canyon Village. The other is the steeper 7.1 mile route across the Black Bridge and up the South Kaibab Trail. The two bridges, about 700 meters apart, are the only Colorado River crossings within a several- hundred-mile span. Phantom Ranch has no official mail service (unlike Supai, Arizona), but concessionaires have traditionally transported letters and postcards by mule. Packages are excluded from this service.

Until February 2005 he was Argentina's military bishop (obispo castrense), that is, the head of the military chaplains, with the status of Subsecretary of State. Biography Baseotto was born on April 4, 1932, and ordained as a priest in 1957. In the 1980s, he served in the diocese of A√±atuya, Santiago del Estero, a province ruled in a quasi-feudalistic fashion by the indefinitely-reelected old-time Peronist Carlos Ju√°rez. During this time, he was reportedly in close relation with the Ju√°rez family. He was in charge of the Sunday programming schedule in a local TV channel and several times he was formally accused of anti-Semitism due to public statements on air. Among other things, in 1986 he affirmed that most of the Jewish community in Argentina \\"devotes itself, with much skill and often with very few moral principles, to big business... It does not matter the means... If pornography is good business, [the Jew] sells pornography. And if drugs are good business, he sells drugs...\\". He also claimed that \\"the means for spreading culture are in the hands of the Hebrews\\", who are \\"desintegrat[ing] the bases\\" of the national civilization and culture. He never went to court or apologized for these statements.P√°gina/12, 6 March 2005. ‚ÄúSi la pornograf√≠a es negocio, el hebreo vende pornograf√≠a. Y si la droga es negocio, vende droga‚Äù. Baseotto was also allegedly involved in the murder of Jimena Hern√°ndez in 1988. According to some sources, he ordered the murder of the girl because she discovered by mistake a meeting between the bishop and drug traffickers. Baseotto ordered Pablo L√≥pez to kill her and then masked his escape, making him pass by a false priest in the diocese of which he was in charged, A√±atuya. In 1992 Baseotto was appointed bishop of his diocese. He spent a total of 27 years in A√±atuya. During his time, he was acknowledged as a supporter of the provincial government and especially of its police force, accused of innumerable abuses and violations of human rights. In bishops' meetings he repeatedly refused to condemn or criticize the policies of President Menem's administration (denounced by most other bishops as causes of poverty). He once stated that laws on reproductive and sexual health (passed in several provinces), which make the State responsible for providing contraceptives to the population, \\"legitimize prostitution\\", and compared them to Nazism. He also made this comparison referring to aborted fetuses (\\"segregated\\", he claimed, as when \\"non-Aryans\\" were selected for extermination). In November 2002, Baseotto was appointed military vicar (vicario castrense) by Pope John Paul II. Due to a previous agreement with the Vatican, this post implies an official position as Subsecretary of State (with monthly wages of about 4,500 Argentine pesos, about 1,500 USD). On 10 December 2004, during the Mass of the Dead for the Country, Baseotto justified the violations of human rights committed during the so-called Dirty War: \\"It was a war, and in a war it is impossible to avoid excesses\\". (See also Theory of the two demons.) On 18 February 2005, Baseotto became a national focus of controversy after he sent a letter to the national Minister of Health Gin√©s Gonz√°lez Garc√≠a, accusing him of committing \\"apology of crime\\" because of the minister's support for the legalization of abortion in Argentina. Baseotto expressed his disgust by paraphrasing Mark 9:42 (\\"And whosoever shall cause one of these little ones that believe on me to stumble, it were better for him if a great millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea\\") and suggesting that Gonz√°lez Garc√≠a should be given that treatment.La Capital, 18 February 2005.

Besides the usage of scripture (widely acknowledged as inappropriate even by other Catholic bishops), Baseotto was heavily criticized because this \\"punishment\\" echoes the infamous vuelos de la muerte (\\"flights of death\\") whereby prisoners of the last military regime were dumped into the Atlantic Ocean from planes. The conflict escalated and caused the Argentine government to relieve Baseotto from his job as the head of the military chaplains. This prompted accusations on the part of Catholic observers (also fueled by right-wing opposition leaders and media) that such actions threatened religious freedom. The government pointed out that Baseotto was still a bishop and could celebrate Mass and perform pastoral duties wherever he chose ‚Äî he would simply not be on the payroll of the state.Catholic News Agency, 21 March 2005.

Players typically specialize or naturally play in a certain way, based on what they can do best. Based on their style, players generally fit into one of three types, baseliners, volleyers, all-court players. Many players have attributes of all three categories but, at times, may also focus on just one style based on the surface, or on the condition, or on the opponent. A baseliner plays from the back of the tennis court, around/behind/within the baseline, preferring to hit groundstrokes, allowing themselves more time to react to their opponent's shots, rather than to come up to the net (except in certain situations). A volleyer plays nearer towards the net, preferring to hit volleys, allowing less time for their opponent to react to their shots, rather than to stay/play from further back on the tennis court (except in certain situations). All-court players fall somewhere in between, employing both baseliner strategies and volleyer strategies depending on the situations. A player's weaknesses may also determine strategy. For example, most players have a stronger forehand, therefore they will favor the forehand even to the point of \\"running around\\" a backhand to hit a forehand. Baseliner = Offensive baseliner = An offensive or aggressive baseliner tries to control and dictate play by hitting powerful groundstrokes for winners usually from the area of the baseline or behind it. An effective offensive baseliner can overpower many opponents; however, when going for winners, they can also produce many errors since they have to repeatedly and correctly execute some difficult strokes, such as down-the-line winners landing near the corner. Fatigue, loss of focus, mis-hitting the ball, and hesitating are some reasons for errors. Two great old-time players, R. Norris Williams and Ellsworth Vines, were famous for being unbeatable when their strokes were \\"on\\". However, they played with such little margin for error in making their strokes that when they were making more mistakes they could be beaten by other players. Another advantage of this strategy is that the player can weaken his opponent's confidence by successfully landing difficult shots which in turn may increase his own confidence. Hard courts are generally considered to be the best surface for an offensive baseliner who often hit higher risk shots. However, offensive baseliners can often excel on both grass and clay courts as well. On grass, they can execute their \\"winners\\" and the fast, low bounce makes it harder for opponents to retrieve; whereas on clay courts, some offensive baseliners might like the slow and high bounce because it gives them a longer time to change their grip and foot-positions in order to set up for an offensive shot or winner. Offensive baseliners with height especially have an advantage on clay courts because the high bounces land in their hitting zones, allowing them to strike the ball cleanly and more powerfully. One great example for this is Maria Sharapova, who is 6'2\\", and the high bounce of the ball really helps her produce winners and force errors from her opponents. She had the hardest hit backhand at the 2013 French Open from the women's side, when she punished a first serve from Jelena Jankovic, producing a backhand return winner. Ivan Lendl was the first player to popularize this style of playing in modern era professional tennis. Steffi Graf and Monica Seles were the pioneers on the women's side. Serena Williams is also known for excelling with this style. Rafael Nadal is accomplished at an offensive baseline playstyle, using a variety of high-spin shots and powerful flat strokes to dominate play, most notably on clay, which he is known to be very good at (though he usually prefers to play a defensive baseline style). Novak Djokovic is also a notable aggressive baseliner, with his powerful and precise backhand which is widely regarded as the best backhand in the men's game. Serena Williams is considered the greatest offensive baseliner in women's tennis history due to her powerful serve and powerful forceful groundstrokes. = Defensive baseliner = A defensive baseliner, counter-puncher or retriever, tries to return every ball and relies on the opponent making mistakes. The trademarks of a counterpuncher include consistent shots with low error rate, as well as precise placement that makes it hard for their opponent to execute an aggressive shot. Counterpunchers also have a tendency to anticipate and are usually equipped with extremely good passing shots, thus enabling them to turn many defensive situations into offence. The game of the defensive counter-puncher has more to do with physical endurance and willingness to get every ball back in play as well as mental determination to keep from getting bored or trying for too much. Their game plan often involves moving their opponents back to the court and outmaneuvering their opponents. One example is former world number one Caroline Wozniacki who moves her opponent around the court without going for high risk winners. While on defence, she gets every ball back and constantly mixes up the pace, to frustrate her opponents. While they tend to make relatively few errors because they do not attempt the complicated and ambitious shots of the aggressive baseliner, the effective counterpuncher must be able to periodically execute an aggressive shot, either using the pace given by their opponent or using precision and angle. Speed and agility are key for the counterpuncher, as well as a willingness to patiently chase down every ball to frustrate opponents. Returning every aggressive shot that the opponent provides is often the cause of further errors due to the effort required in trying increasingly harder and better shots. However, it is noted that for some faster players, including Ga√´l Monfils, Gilles Simon, Lleyton Hewitt and Andy Murray, standing too deep behind the court can hinder their attacking abilities. At lower levels, the defensive counter-puncher often frustrates their opponent so much that they may try to change their style of play due to ineffective baseline results. At higher levels, the all-court player or aggressive baseliner is usually able to execute winners with higher velocity and better placement, taking the counterpuncher out of the point as early as possible. Most counter-punchers often excel on slow courts, such as clay. The court gives them extra time to chase down shots and it is harder for opponents to create winners. However, some counter-punchers who have the ability to mix up their game and turn defense into offense, like Lleyton Hewitt, Andy Murray and Agnieszka Radwanska have excelled on faster courts like hard and grass as well as slower courts. Counter-punchers are often particularly strong players at low-level play, where opponents cannot make winners with regularity. Volleyer A serve and volleyer has a great net game, is quick around the net, and has fine touch for volleys. Serve and volleyers come up to the net at every opportunity when serving. They are almost always attackers and can hit many winners with varieties of volleys and drop volleys. When not serving, they often employ the \\"chip-and-charge\\", chipping back the serve without attempting to hit a winner and rushing the net. The serve-and-volleyers' strategy is to put pressure on the opponent to try to hit difficult passing shots. This strategy is extremely effective against pushers. Serve-and-volleyers benefit from playing on fast courts, such as grass or fast concrete. The quick bounce and faster pace of play give them an advantage because opponents have less time to set up for a passing shot. However, the number of serve-and-volley players is decreasing in today's professional tennis, because this strategy requires more experience to master and defeat other playing styles (as well as changes in racquet technology that have improved players' passing shots). In addition to this, there has been a trend toward the slowing down of tennis surfaces over the past few years. The serve-and-volley technique works better on faster surfaces because the volleyer is able to put more balls away without the baseliner being able to chase them down. Although serve and volleyers may be a dying breed, there are still some great players who employ this tactic. The Frenchman Micha√´l Llodra has been considered by many to be the best pure serve and volleyer of today's game. Bill Tilden, the dominant player of the 1920s, preferred to play from the back of the court, and liked nothing better than to face an opponent who rushed the net ‚Äì one way or another Tilden would find a way to hit the ball past him. In his book Match Play and the Spin of the Ball, Tilden propounds the theory that by definition a great baseline player will always beat a great serve-and-volleyer. Some of the best matches of all time have pitted great baseliners such as Bj√∂rn Borg, Mats Wilander or Andre Agassi against great serve-and-volleyers such as John McEnroe, Boris Becker, Stefan Edberg, or Pete Sampras. Some players, such as Tommy Haas, Roger Federer and Andy Roddick will only employ this strategy on grass courts or as a surprise tactic on any surface. Roger Federer uses this commonly against Rafael Nadal, to break up long rallies and physically taxing games.  All-court player  All-court players, or all-rounders, have aspects of every tennis style, whether that be offensive baseliner, defensive counter-puncher or serve-and-volleyer. All- court players use the best bits from each style and mix it together to create a truly formidable tennis style to play against. In game situations they are very versatile; when an all-court player's baseline game is not working, he/she may switch to a net game, and vice versa. All-court players have the ability to adjust to different opponents that play different styles more easily than pure baseliners or serve and volleyers. All-court players typically have the speed, determination and fitness of a defensive counter- puncher, the confidence, skill and flair of offensive baseliners and have the touch, the agility around the net and tactical thinking of the serve-and- volleyer. However, just because the all-court player has a combination of skills used by all tennis styles does not necessarily mean that they can beat an offensive baseliner or a defensive counter-puncher or even a serve-and- volleyer. It just means it would be more difficult to read the game of an all- court player. Perfect examples for all-rounders are Boris Becker or Pete Sampras in men's singles and Daniela Hantuchova or Martina Hingis in women's singles. Serving strategy Holding serve is crucial in tennis. To hold serve, serves must be accurately placed, and a high priority should be placed on first serve percentage. In addition, the velocity of serve is important. A weak serve can be easily attacked by an aggressive returner. The first ball after the serve is also key. Players should serve in order to get a weak return and keep the opponent on the defense with that first shot. For example, following a wide serve, it is ideal to hit the opponent's return to the open court. There are three different types of serves and each one of them can be used in different situations. One type of serve is the serve with slice. The slice serve works better when the player tosses the ball to the right and immediately hits the outer-right part of the ball. This serve is best used when you hit it wide so you get your opponent off the court. Another type is the kick serve. To achieve a good execution, the player must toss the ball above the head and immediately spin the bottom-left part of the ball. Since the ball is tossed above the head, it is necessary for the player to arch correctly under the ball. This serve is best used as second serve because the amount of spin that is added to the ball makes it very safe. The kick serve is also effective when a change of rhythm is needed or when the opponent struggles with the high bounce that results from the effect. A third type of serve is the flat one. To execute this serve, the player must toss the ball right in front and immediately hit the middle-top part of the ball. This is usually a very hard serve and therefore risky. However, if the flat serve is executed with enough power and precision, it can turn into a great weapon to win points faster. Doubles strategy Though strategy is important in singles, it is even more important in doubles. The additional width of the alleys on the doubles court has a great effect on the angles possible in doubles play. Consequently, doubles is known as a game of angles. There are three basic doubles strategies: * both-up strategy (also called \\"two-up\\" strategy) * up-and-back strategy (also called \\"one-up/one-back\\" or \\"I\\" strategy) * both-back strategy (also called \\"two-back\\" strategy) =Both-up strategy= The ideal is both-up strategy, often called \\"Attacking Doubles\\" because the net is the \\"high ground\\", and the both-up strategy puts both players close to it, in a position to score because of their excellent vantage points and angles. A team in the both-up formation, however, is vulnerable to a good lob from either opponent at any time. To be successful with Attacking Doubles, teams must have effective serves and penetrating volleys to prevent good lobs and good overhead shots to put away poor returns. Teams that play attacking doubles try to get into the both-up formation on every point. When serving, their server follows most first serves to the net and some second serves. As a result, attacking doubles is also called serve-and-volley doubles. When receiving, their receiver follows most second-service returns to the net. At the professional level, attacking doubles is the standard, though slowly degrading, strategy of choice. =Up-and-back strategy= At lower levels of the game, not all players have penetrating volleys and strong overhead shots. So, many use up-and-back strategy. The weakness in this formation is the large angular gap it creates between partners, a gap that an opposing net player can easily hit a clean winner through if they successfully poach a passing shot. Nonetheless, up-and-back strategy is versatile, with elements of both offense and defense. In fact, since the server must begin each point at the baseline and the receiver must be far enough back to return the serve, virtually every point in doubles begins with both teams in this formation. Teams without net games strong enough to play Attacking Doubles can still play both-up when they have their opponents on the defensive. To achieve this, a team would patiently play up-and-back for a chance to hit a forcing shot and bring their baseliner to the net. Australian Doubles and the I-Formation are variations of up-and-back strategy. In Australian doubles, the server's partner at net lines up on the same side of the court, fronting the opposing net player, who serves as a poaching block and blind. The receiver then must return serve down the line and is liable to have that return poached. In the I-Formation, the server's net partner lines up in the center, between the server and receiver so he or she can poach in either direction. Both Australian Doubles and the I-Formation are poaching formations that can also be used to start the point for serve-and-volley doubles. =Both-back strategy= Both-back strategy is strictly defensive. It is normally seen only when the opposing team is both-up or when the returner is passing the net player on the return. This might be a good tactic when the opponent has a serve with a lot of pressure and an aggressive player at the net. From here the defenders can return the most forcing shots till they get a chance to hit a good lob or an offensive shot. If their opponents at net become impatient and try to angle the ball away when a baseliner can reach it, the defender can turn the tables and score outright. However this strategy leaves the volley court open to drop shots from the opposition.

Farley Building is the main United States Postal Service building in Midtown Manhattan in New York City. It was designed by McKim, Mead & White in the Beaux-Arts style and built along with the original Pennsylvania Station in 1912. The building sits at 421 Eighth Avenue, on the west side of the avenue across from Pennsylvania Station and Madison Square Garden between 31st Street and 33rd Street. The main facade of the Farley Building was conceived as a Corinthian colonnade braced at the end by two pavilions. The imposing design was meant to match in strength the colonnade of the old Pennsylvania Station. Inside is a gallery with Corinthian columns and a ceiling decorated with the emblems of ten major nations that existed at the building's completion. The building is famous for bearing the United States Postal Service creed: \\"Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds.\\" The James A. Farley Building was formerly the General Post Office Building. The building was designated a New York City Landmark in 1966 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. It was officially renamed in 1982 as a monument and testament to the political career of the nation's 53rd Postmaster General James Farley. Since 2010, plans have been under way to integrate Moynihan Train Hall into the landmark as part of the Penn Station Expansion. Description The Farley Building consists of the old general post office building and its western annex. The Farley building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and occupies two full city blocks, an footprint straddling the tracks of the Northeast Corridor and the Farley Corridor (sub- district B) in western Midtown Manhattan. The building fronts on the west side of Eighth Avenue, across from Pennsylvania Station and Madison Square Garden. It is located at 421 Eighth Avenue, between 31st Street and 33rd Street in the New York City borough of Manhattan. The Farley Post Office was the only Post Office in New York City open to the public 24 hours a day, seven days a week. However, because of the Great Recession in 2009, its windows started closing at 10:00 p.m. = Facade = A carefully detailed Corinthian colonnade under the inspirational inscription The monumental facade on Eighth Avenue was conceived as a Corinthian colonnade braced at the end by two pavilions. The imposing design was meant to match in strength the colonnade of Pennsylvania Station (also designed by McKim, Mead, and White), which originally faced the General Post Office Building from across Eighth Avenue. An unbroken flight of steps the full length of the colonnade provides access. The main floor is above a raised basement that rises out of a dry moat giving light and air to workspaces below. Each of the square end pavilions is capped with a low saucer dome, expressed on the exterior as a low stepped pyramid. The building prominently bears the inscription: Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds, which is frequently mistaken as the official motto of the United States Postal Service. It was actually supplied by William Mitchell Kendall of the firm of McKim, Mead & White, the architects who designed the Farley Building and the original Pennsylvania Station in the same Beaux-Arts style. The sentence is taken from Herodotus' Histories (Book 8, Ch. 98) and describes the faithful service of the Persian system of mounted postal messengers under Xerxes I of Persia. The U.S.P.S. does not actually have an official motto or creed, but nonetheless the inscription on the building is often cited as such. = Interior = leftInside the Eighth Avenue entrance, the visitor finds an unbroken vista down a long gallery that parallels the colonnaded front. The north end of the gallery houses a small Museum of Postal History. McKim, Mead, and White's range, which continues its Corinthian giant order as pilasters between the window bays, was simply repeated in order to carry the facade to Ninth Avenue. The ceiling of the front reception hall is decorated with carved national emblems or coats of arms of ten major nations at the time of the building's construction: the United States, the United Kingdom, the German Empire, the French Third Republic (represented by the cipher \\"R.F.\\" for R√©publique Fran√ßaise since lacking an official national emblem), the Russian Empire, the Kingdom of Italy, the Kingdom of Spain, Belgium, Austria-Hungary, and the Netherlands. History The original building was one of the last built under the Tarsney Act. Up until 1893, all federal non-military structures were designed by in-house government architects in the Office of the Supervising Architect in the United States Treasury Department. The 1893 act introduced by a Missouri Congressman permitted the Supervisory Architect to pick private architects following a competition. Supervisory architect James Knox Taylor picked McKim for the New York post office. In 1913, the act was repealed partially in light of a scandal in which Taylor had picked his former Minnesota partner Cass Gilbert to design the Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House. =Construction= As part of the planning of Penn Station in the early 1900s, the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) proposed that the United States Post Office Department construct a post office on 8th Avenue, across from the station. In February 1903, the U.S. government accepted the PRR's proposal and made plans to construct what would later become the Farley Post Office. A contract to build the Post Office was let in March 1911. The original monumental structure was built in 1912 and opened for postal business in 1914. Circa 1912 The building's size was doubled in 1934 by then Postmaster General James A. Farley, who expanded the general Post Office to The Ninth Avenue side. The expansion replaced the City Hall Post Office at Park Row and Broadway, built 1869-80. Postmaster General Farley's historical association to the landmark is due to this expansion. Farley's building supply firm, the General Builders Supply Corporation, had received a federal contract under the Hoover Administration to provide building materials for the construction of the Post Office Annex. The General Builders Corporation supplied building materials toward the construction of such landmarks as the Empire State Building, Rockefeller Center, and the United Nations Headquarters. Farley was accused by then Senator Huey Long of Louisiana of receiving preferential treatment from the Roosevelt Administration, a charge that later proved to be false, as Farley would be cleared by the Senate of any wrongdoing in what would be known as \\"The Long-Farley Affair of 1935\\". =Operation= Morgan Annex Upon opening in 1914, it was named the Pennsylvania Terminal. In July 1918, the building was renamed the General Post Office Building. The building was made a New York City designated landmark in 1966. In 1982, the Penn Station post office was dedicated as the James A. Farley Building. (97th Congress, H.Res. 368 3 February 1982). James Farley was the nation's 53rd Postmaster General and served from 1933 to 1940. He was also the supreme Democratic Party boss of New York State at the time, was responsible for Franklin D. Roosevelt's rise to the Presidency,http://tvnews.vanderbilt.eduprogram.pl?ID=488627 and is the first Roman Catholic politician in American history to have crossover appeal as a candidate for the office of the Presidency of the United States of America. Farley, a native New Yorker, was instrumental in the political careers of Alfred E. Smith and Franklin D. Roosevelt, having served as campaign manager to both. Farley was a Democratic candidate for U.S. president in the 1940 United States presidential election, running against Roosevelt in the primary. The Farley Building was instrumental to maintaining service levels in the New York City area following the September 11 attacks, when it served as a backup to operations for the Church Street Station Post Office located across the street from the World Trade Center complex. Advances in automated mail processing technology, coupled with adjustments to postal distribution and transportation networks, now make it feasible for the Morgan Center to handle high volumes of mail. =Plans= The Farley Building seen in 2018 Portions of the landmark James Farley Post Office are being adaptively reused and converted to house a new concourse for Amtrak. The Amtrak facility within the historic Farley Post Office will be named the Moynihan Train Hall. A first phase, consisting of new exits and a mezzanine within the James Farley Post Office, broke ground on October 18, 2010. A second phase, comprising a new train hall within the Farley Building, started construction in August 2017. Beyond retail lobby services, other postal operations that would remain in the building will include Express Mail, mail delivery, truck platforms, and a stamp depository. Administrative offices for the Postal Service's New York District will also be headquartered within Farley, and Operation Santa Claus will remain at the building. In August 2020, Facebook signed a lease for all of office space in the Farley Building, following a similar acquisition that the company made at nearby Hudson Yards the previous year. The lease came during the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, when most Manhattan office workers were working remotely, so it was seen at the time as a major positive for Manhattan's office market. In popular culture The Farley Building is home to \\"Operation Santa\\", made famous in the classic film Miracle on 34th Street (1947). The building is the inspiration for the post office in Terry Pratchett's novel Going Postal (2004), with its \\"Glom of nit\\" legend. It is also depicted three-dimensionally and serves as a main home base for the fictional Catastrophic Emergency Response Agency (CERA) in the 2016-released video game Tom Clancy's The Division.

It houses designated collections of national importance that span the full range of objects, archives, photographs, film and books. It is also the location of the University of Reading's special collections archive, housing hundreds of collections of rare books, manuscripts, typescripts and other objects of importance. The museum is run by the University of Reading, and is situated in Redlands Road to the rear of the institution's London Road Campus near to the centre of Reading in southern England. The location was formerly known as East Thorpe House and then St. Andrews Hall. It is an accredited museum and accredited archive as recognised by Arts Council England and the National Archives. History The museum's site was originally occupied by a house known as East Thorpe, designed in 1880 by Alfred Waterhouse for Alfred Palmer (of the Reading biscuit manufacturers Huntley & Palmers). Palmer was an important early benefactor of Reading University and in 1911 East Thorpe was extended to become St Andrews Hall, a hall of residence for women attending the university. The museum itself was founded in 1951, growing out of the university's long academic connections with agriculture. It originally occupied premises on the University of Reading's main Whiteknights Campus, opening to the public in 1955. St Andrews Hall closed as a hall of residence in 2001. The site was then redeveloped for the use of the museum, with the cost of ¬£11m being shared by the university, the Heritage Lottery Fund and public donations. The redeveloped museum opened in 2005 and retains the original East Thorpe building, with the addition of an adjoining new building. The two contrasting buildings overlook restored gardens, providing a setting for a rural collection in an urban environment. The Museum underwent a period of further redevelopment from 20132016, funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund, the Wellcome Trust, and the University of Reading. The Museum officially reopened on 22 October 2016 with ten new galleries, including a gallery dedicated to Ladybird Books artwork held by the University of Reading Special Collections. In February 2019, a bat was found on the museum's premises. The museum named the bat MERLin and issued him a library card. Collections The Museum holds over 25,000 objects, almost all of which are on display, and which provide a material record of rural England covering 1750 to the present day. It cares for a collection of livestock portraiture, representations of rural life, agricultural hand tools, ploughs, farm machinery, sewing machines and other equipment. The museum has a specialist library and houses other collections including the library of the Tools & Trades History Society.Tools & Trades History Society File:The Museum of English Rural Life (geograph 4500687).jpgEntrance to the Museum File:The Welcome Case in the Museum of English Rural Life.jpgThe Welcome Case File:Detail of the Making Rural England gallery, The Museum of English Rural Life.jpgDetail of the Making Rural England Gallery File:A Year on the Farm gallery, The Museum of English Rural Life.jpgA Year on the Farm Gallery File:Museum of English Rural Life 2.jpgThe rear garden, with the original East Thorpe House in the centre  References   External links  * Category:Museums established in 1951 Category:Alfred Waterhouse buildings Category:Rural history museums in England Category:Agricultural museums in England Category:Museums of the University of Reading Category:English coast and countryside Category:1951 establishments in England Category:Musical instrument museums ","title":"Museum of English Rural Life"},{"id":"2092472","text":"Cover of the first edition of Le Silence de la mer. Le Silence de la mer (, The Silence of the Sea) is a French novel written during the summer of 1941 and published in early 1942 by Jean Bruller under the pseudonym \\"Vercors\\". Published secretly in German-occupied Paris, the book quickly became a symbol of mental resistance against German occupiers. Plot summary In the book, Vercors tells of how an old man and his niece show resistance against the German occupiers by not speaking to the officer who is occupying their house. The German officer is a former composer, dreaming of brotherhood between the French and German nations, deluded by the Nazi propaganda of that period. He is disillusioned when he realizes the real goal of the German army is not to build but to ruin and to exploit. He then chooses to leave France to fight on the Eastern Front, cryptically declaring he is \\"off to Hell.\\" Adaptations The book was translated into English by Cyril Connolly and published in 1944 under the title Put Out the Light. An English language adaptation called The Silence of the Sea was transmitted by the BBC TV service on 7 June 1946 as part of their first evening's programming following the resumption of TV broadcasting after the end of World War II. A film, Le Silence de la mer, based on the book and directed by Jean-Pierre Melville, was released in 1949. A second English-language TV adaptation was broadcast by the BBC in 1981, and a stage version by John Crowther was performed by The Heywood Society in the theatre at Peterhouse, Cambridge in 1985, with the (presumably ironic) title Talking in the Night.Cantab Magazine, February 1985. Le Silence de la Mer (2004), a French-Belgian TV movie based on the novels by Vercors was shot from 1 to 28 April 2004 in Tusson and directed by Pierre Boutron for France 2 television. This film was awarded at the Festival of Fiction of Saint-Tropez in 2004 three awards: best TV film, best female (Julie Delarme) and best music (Ang√©lique et Jean-Claude Nachon).

Halim Abdul Messieh El-Dabh (, ·∏§alƒ´m  ªAbd al-Masƒ´·∏• al-·∏åab ª; March 4, 1921 ‚Äì September 2, 2017) was an Egyptian American composer, musician, ethnomusicologist, and educator, who had a career spanning six decades. He is particularly known as an early pioneer of electronic music. In 1944 he composed one of the earliest known works of tape music, or musique concr√®te. From the late 1950s to early 1960s he produced influential work at the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center. Early life El-Dabh was born and grew up in Sakakini, Cairo, Egypt, a member of a large and affluent Coptic Christian family that had earlier emigrated from Abutig in the Upper Egyptian province of Asyut. The family name means \\"the hyena\\" and is not uncommon in Egypt. In 1932 the family relocated to the Cairo suburb of Heliopolis. Following his father's profession of agriculture, he graduated from Fuad I University (now Cairo University) in 1945 with a degree in agricultural engineering, while also studying, performing, and composing music on an informal basis. Although his main income was derived from his job as an agricultural consultant, he achieved recognition in Egypt from the mid- to late 1940s for his innovative compositions and piano technique. =Early electronic music in Cairo= It was while he was still a student in Cairo that he began his experiments in electronic music. El-Dabh first conducted experiments in sound manipulation with wire recorders there in the early 1940s. By 1944, he had composed one of the earliest known works of tape music or musique concr√®te, called The Expression of Zaar, pre-dating Pierre Schaeffer's work by four years. Having borrowed a wire recorder from the offices of Middle East Radio, El-Dabh took it to the streets to capture outside sounds, specifically an ancient zaar ceremony, a type of exorcism conducted in public. Intrigued by the possibilities of manipulating recorded sound for musical purposes, he believed it could open up the raw audio content of the zaar ceremony to further investigation into \\"the inner sound\\" contained within. According to El-Dabh, \\"I just started playing around with the equipment at the station, including reverberation, echo chambers, voltage controls, and a re-recording room that had movable walls to create different kinds and amounts of reverb.\\" He further explains: \\"I concentrated on those high tones that reverberated and had different beats and clashes, and started eliminating the fundamental tones, isolating the high overtones so that in the finished recording, the voices are not really recognizable any more, only the high overtones, with their beats and clashes, may be heard.\\" He thus discovered the potential of sound recordings as raw material to compose music. His final 20‚Äì25 minute piece was recorded onto magnetic tape and called The Expression of Zaar, which was publicly presented in 1944 at an art gallery event in Cairo. Following a well received 1949 performance at the All Saints Cathedral in Cairo, he was invited by an official of the U.S. embassy to study in the United States. Move to the United States Coming to the United States in 1950 on a Fulbright fellowship (as expanded to include Egypt via the Smith-Mundt Act of 1948), El-Dabh studied composition with John Donald Robb and Ernst Krenek at the University of New Mexico; with Francis Judd Cooke at the New England Conservatory of Music; with Aaron Copland, Irving Fine, and Luigi Dallapiccola at the Berkshire Music Center; and with Irving Fine at Brandeis University. El-Dabh and his family rented a house in Demarest, New Jersey before buying a home in Cresskill, New Jersey where they lived for some time.Seachrist, Denise A. \\"The Musical World of Halim El-Dabh\\", pp. 54 and 95, Kent State University Press, 2003. . Accessed July 8, 2011. From page 54: \\"Elated that his wife had finally agreed to join him in New York, El-Dabh sought more suitable accommodations for his family and located a house for rent in Demarest, New Jersey.\\" From page 95: \\"Mary and the girls were delighted to return to the United States, and when El-Dabh purchased a home in Cresskill, New Jersey, Mary was optimistic that her peripatetic husband was finally ready to settle down.\\" El-Dabh soon became a part of the New York new music scene of the 1950s, alongside such like-minded composers as Henry Cowell, John Cage, Edgard Var√®se, Alan Hovhaness, and Peggy Glanville-Hicks. He obtained U.S. citizenship in 1961. Among El-Dabh's works are four ballet scores for Martha Graham, including her masterpiece Clytemnestra (1958), as well as One More Gaudy Night (1961), A Look at Lightning (1962), and Lucifer (1975). Many of his compositions draw on Ancient Egyptian themes or texts, and one such work is his orchestral/choral score for the Sound and Light show at the site of Great Pyramid of Giza, which has been performed there each evening since 1961. El-Dabh's primary instruments are the piano and darabukha (an Egyptian goblet- or vase-shaped hand drum with a body made of fire-hardened clay), and consequently many of his works are composed for these instruments. In 1958 he performed the demanding solo part in the New York City premiere of his Fantasia-Tahmeel for darabukha and string orchestra (probably the first orchestral work to feature this instrument), with an orchestra under the direction of Leopold Stokowski. In 1959 he composed several works for an ensemble of percussion instruments from India, for the New York Percussion Trio. =Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center= After having become acquainted with Otto Luening and Vladimir Ussachevsky by 1955, by which time El-Dabh he had been experimenting with electronic music for ten years, they later invited him to work at the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center in 1959 as one of the first outside composers there, where he would become one of the most influential composers associated with the early years of the studio. El-Dabh's unique approach to combining spoken words, singing and percussion sounds with electronic signals and processing contributed significantly to the development of early electroacoustic techniques at the center. Some of his compositions also made extensive use of Columbia-Princeton's RCA Synthesizer, an early programmable synthesizer. He worked there sporadically until 1961, creating various tape works, including at least two in collaboration with Luening. Other composers he had become acquainted with at Columbia-Princeton include John Cage, Aaron Copland, and Leonard Bernstein. El-Dabh produced eight electronic pieces in 1959 alone, including his multi-part electronic musical drama Leiyla and the Poet, which is considered a classic of the genre and was later released in 1964 on the LP record Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center. His musical style was a contrast to the more mathematical compositions of Milton Babbitt and other serial composers working at the center, with El-Dabh's interest in ethnomusicology and the fusion of folk music with electronic sounds making his work stand out for its originality. According to El-Dabh: \\"The creative process comes from interacting with the material. When you are open to ideas and thoughts the music will come to you.\\" In contrast to his peers (such as Otto Luening, John Cage, and La Monte Young) who sounded, according to The Stranger, more like \\"math equations (artists out to prove a point) than actual music,\\" El-Dabh's experimental electronic music were \\"more shapely and rhythmic constructions\\" that incorporated traditional stringed and percussion sounds, inspired by folk music traditions (including the Egyptian and Native American traditions). Making full use of all ten Ampex tape recorders available to him at Columbia, his approach to composing electronic music was for immersion, with his seamless blending of vocals, electronic tones, tape manipulation such as speed transposition, and music looping, giving Leiyla and the Poet an \\"unearthly quality\\" that made it influential among many composers at the time. The number of musicians who have acknowledged the importance of his recordings to their work range from Neil Rolnick, Charles Amirkhanian and Alice Shields to rock musicians such as Frank Zappa and The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band. The \\"organic textures and raw energy\\" of Leiyla and the Poet in particular inspired many early electronic music composers. Leiyla and the Poet also featured a \\"sonorous, echoing voice, sonar signals, distorted ouds, percussion that sounds like metal,\\" and \\"shadowy, shifting dream music.\\" Other works he composed there include the 1959 pieces \\"Meditation in White Sound\\", \\"Alcibiadis' Monologue to Socrates\\", and the chimey, rhythmic \\"Electronics and the Word\\", as well as the 1961 piece \\"Venice\\" which is reminiscent of Steve Reich's field recording experiments in the mid-1960s. El-Dabh also helped introduce an \\"Egyptian folk sensibility\\" to Western avant-garde music. A definitive collection of El- Dabh's electronic work was restored by Mike Hovancsek. This CD, titled Crossing into the Electric-Magnetic, includes a collaboration with Otto Luening, environmental recordings, and wire recordings that the liner notes cite as \\"arguably the earliest example of electronic music.\\" =Later life and career= Like B√©la Bart√≥k before him, El-Dabh has also conducted numerous research trips in various nations, recording and otherwise documenting traditional musics and using the results to enrich his compositions and teaching. From 1959 to 1964 the most significant of these trips included investigations of the musics across the length and breadth of Egypt and Ethiopia, with later fieldwork being conducted in Mali, Senegal, Niger, Guinea, Zaire, Brazil, and several other nations. During the 1970s, El-Dabh served as a consultant to the Smithsonian Institution and conducted research on the traditional puppetry of Egypt and Guinea. El-Dabh served as associate professor of music at Haile Selassie I University (now Addis Ababa University) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, professor of African studies at Howard University (1966‚Äì69), and professor of music and Pan-African studies at Kent State University (1969‚Äì91); he continued to teach courses in African studies there on a part-time basis until 2012. Among the awards and honors he has received are two Fulbright awards (1950 and 1967), three MacDowell Colony residencies (1954, 1956, and 1957), two Guggenheim Fellowships (1959‚Äì60 and 1961‚Äì62), two Rockefeller Foundation fellowships (1961 and 2001), a Meet-the-Composer grant (1999), an Ohio Arts Council grant (2000), and two honorary doctorates (Kent State University, 2001; and New England Conservatory, 2007). El-Dabh is probably the best known composer of Arabic descent and his works are highly regarded in Egypt, where he was considered the foremost living composer among that nation's \\"second generation\\" of contemporary composers. He was invited back to his homeland in April 2002 for a festival of his music at the newly constructed Bibliotheca Alexandrina in Alexandria, Egypt; most of the compositions presented were heard by the Egyptian public for the first time. Many of El-Dabh's scores are published by the C. F. Peters Corporation and his music has been recorded by the Folkways and Columbia labels. Previously unpublished works are also being produced by Deborah El-Dabh of Halim El-Dabh Music, LLC. The first biography of the composer, The Musical World of Halim El-Dabh by Denise A. Seachrist, was published by the Kent State University Press in 2003. He has been a frequent performer and speaker at both the WinterStar Symposium and the Starwood Festival, where he performed with lifelong friend and master drummer Babatunde Olatunji in 1997, and where El- Dabh's concert of traditional sacred African music was recorded in 2002. In 2003 he was part of a three-day tribute to the late Olatunji called the SpiritDrum Festival, with Muruga Booker, Badal Roy, Sikiru Adepoju, Jeff Rosenbaum, and Jim Donovan of Rusted Root. In 2005 he performed and ran workshops at Unyazi 2005 in Johannesburg, which was the first electronic music symposium and festival to be hosted in Africa. He is a National Patron of Delta Omicron, an international professional music fraternity.Delta Omicron He is survived by his wife and his three grown children. Ancestry and identity A 2003 biography by Denise A. Seachrist describes the multilayered ethnic and racial identity of El-Dabh. As a young student in Egypt, he was inspired by the secularism and pan-Arabism of Gamal Abdel Nasser, but became disenchanted with Arab identity when Nasser failed to act against the institutionalized discrimination against Egypt's Copts. After he immigrated to the United States, El-Dabh encountered racism. Because he was of Upper (southern) Egyptian descent, he notes that he was darker-skinned than most Egyptian immigrants to the United States.Denise A. Seachrist, The Musical World of Halim El-Dabh (Kent: Kent State University Press, 2003): . El-Dabh was noted for his support for the African American community, and his activism on behalf of civil rights, which he says were motivated by his own experiences of racism. Throughout the late 50s and 1960s, he donated or marched with various civil rights organizations. His ties to African American culture were deepened when he taught music and African American studies at Howard University.Denise A. Seachrist, The Musical World of Halim El-Dabh (Kent: Kent State University Press, 2003): . In 2003 El-Dabh appeared on a television program with Henry Louis Gates to analyze his genetic ancestry; the results showed him to be approximately 94% Egyptian (overwhelmingly from Upper Egypt), 3% European, and 3% sub-Saharan African.Denise A.

She contributed significantly to the early development of the discipline of geography in the United States, particularly studies of human geography. She is most closely associated with work in anthropogeography and environmentalism, and the debate about \\"environmental determinism\\". Early life Semple was born in Louisville, Kentucky, the youngest of five children by Alexander Bonner Semple and Emerine Price. Education Semple's early education was guided by her mother, Emerine Semple, as well as private tutors. Semple followed her sister, Patty Semple, to Vassar where she graduated as valedictorian and was the youngest member of her graduating class. Semple graduated in 1882 with a BA in History from Vassar College at the age of 19, and continued on at Vassar to earn an MA in History in (1891). She became interested in geography while visiting London, where she encountered the works of Friedrich Ratzel. She went to Germany to seek out Ratzel and study with him at the University of Leipzig. As a woman, she was prohibited from matriculating, but she was able to gain permission to attend Ratzel's lectures, the only woman in a class of five hundred male students.Brown, Nina. Ellen Churchill Semple: The Anglo-Saxons of the Kentucky Mountains, 1901. Center for Spatially Integrated Social Science. Accessed 2015-3-12. She continued to work with Ratzel and produced several academic papers in American and European journals, but was never conferred a degree. Career Semple was the first woman to become president of the Association for American Geographers. Semple was a pioneer in American geography, helping to broaden the discipline's focus beyond physical features of the earth and bringing attention to human aspects of geography. Her innovative approach and theories influenced the development of human geography as a significant subfield and influenced the social sciences across disciplines, including history and anthropology. Semple taught at the University of Chicago from 1906 to 1920, but her first permanent academic position was offered to her in 1922 at Clark University. She was the first female faculty member, teaching graduate students in geography for the next decade, but her salary was always significantly less than her male colleagues. She also lectured at the University of Oxford in 1912 and 1922. Her first book, American History and its Geographic Conditions (1903) and her second, Influences of Geographic Environment (1911), were widely-used textbooks for students of geography and history in the United States at the start of the 20th century. Semple was a founding member of the Association of American Geographers (AAG). She was elected AAG's first female President in 1921, and remains only one of six women to hold that office since the organization's founding in 1904. Theoretical contributions =Environmental determinism and anthropogeography= :: \\"Man is the product of the earth's surface.\\" (Semple 1911:1). Semple was a key figure in the theory of environmental determinism, along with Ellsworth Huntington and Griffith Taylor. Influenced by the works of Charles Darwin and inspired by her mentor Freidrich Ratzel, Semple theorized that human activity was primarily determined by the physical environment. Although environmental determinism is today heavily critiqued and has lost favor in social theory, it was widely accepted in academia in the late 19th-early 20th centuries.Cresswell, Tim (2013) Geographic Thought: A Critical Introduction. Wiley-Blackwell, Malden, MA. Still, Semple's influence can be seen in the works of many modern-day geographers, including Jared Diamond. In a series of books and papers she communicated certain aspects of the work of German geographer Friedrich Ratzel to the Anglophone community. Standard disciplinary accounts often attribute to Semple a prevailing interest in environmental determinism, a theory that the physical environment, rather than social conditions, determines culture; however her later work emphasized environmental influences as opposed to the environment's deterministic effect on culture, reflecting broader academic discontent with environmental determinism after the First World War. In her work Influences of Geographic Environment on the Basis of Ratzel's System of Anthropo-Geography (1911), she describes people and their associated landscapes, dividing the world into key environmental types. Semple identifies four key ways that the physical environment: 1) direct physical effects (climate, altitude); 2) psychical effects (culture, art, religion); 3) economic and social development (resources and livelihoods); 4) movement of people (natural barriers and routes, such as mountains and rivers). Semple's work also reflects discussions and conflicts within geography and social theory about determinism and race. Indeed, in some works she challenges popular ideas of her time about race determining social and cultural differences, suggesting that environment was a more important factor in cultural development. Semple's theories of environmental determinism have been criticized as overly simplistic and often replicating the same themes of racial determination through \\"nature\\". However, Semple's work has more recently been revisited for its early examination of issues which are now central to political ecology. Semple believed that mankind originated in the tropics but gained full maturity in the temperate regions of the world.\\"where man has remained in the tropics, with few exceptions, he has suffered arrested development. His nursery has kept him a child.\\" =Fieldwork= Semple conducted fieldwork for her research in Kentucky and the Mediterranean, an innovative practice that was uncommon in geography at the time. From 1911 to 1912, she undertook an eighteen-month journey which visited Japan, Korea, China, the Philippines, Java, Ceylon, India, Egypt, Palestine, Lebanon, and Turkey in addition to places in Europe and the United States. The main focus of the trip was a three-month visit to Japan, facilitated by her Vassar classmate ≈åyama Sutematsu, which produced unusually positive depictions of Japan during a period of high anti-Japanese sentiment in the United States. During her fieldwork, she took notes on human- environment relations, cultural features of the landscape, and made detailed observations of housing, structures, livelihoods, and daily life. Late life Semple continued to teach geography until her death in 1932. She died in West Palm Beach, Florida, and is buried in the Cave Hill National Cemetery in Louisville. Awards and recognition In 1914 Semple received the Cullum Geographic Medal from the American Geographical Society, \\"in recognition of her distinguished contributions to the science of anthropogeography\\". She was President of the Association of American Geographers (now the American Association of Geographers) from 1921 to 1922 and was awarded the Helen Culver Gold Medal by the Geographic Society of Chicago, in recognition of her leadership in American Geography. Semple Elementary School in Semple's hometown of Louisville was named in her honor.

Rehoming of Carolina dogs has recently become popular, and they can make good domestic pets with proper socialization. Since 2008, artificial selection efforts to establish them as a standardized breed (usually capitalized as Carolina Dog) has made some progress, with recognition in two smaller national kennel clubs, and acceptance into the breed- establishment program of a major one. Originally a landrace breed, the Carolina dog was rediscovered living as free-roaming population by I. Lehr Brisbin Jr., though originally documented in American dog-related publications in the 1920s. Carolina dogs show admixture with dog breeds from east Asia. Discovery One of the earliest publications to document the \\"Indian\\" dogs of North America was an article by Glover Morrill Allen, in 1920. Allen postulated that these \\"Larger or Common Indian Dogs\\" were descended from Asian primitive dogs: Allen cites late nineteenth-century studies of skeletal remains of dogs that could be found from Alaska to Florida to the Greater Antilles and westward to the Great Plains, and were excavated from Indian mounds as well: These dogs were publicized by I. Lehr Brisbin Jr., a senior research ecologist at the University of Georgia's Savannah River Ecology Laboratory, who first came across a Carolina dog while working at the Savannah River Site, which was depopulated and secured of all trespass and traffic for decades beginning in 1950. Establishment and recognition Pet Carolina dog at home Since 1996, Carolina dogs can be registered with the United Kennel Club (UKC), which has published a detailed, formal Carolina Dog breed standard. UKC focuses on hunting dogs and other working dogs, and categorizes the Carolina in their \\"Sighthound & Pariah Group\\", along with other breeds such as the Basenji of Africa and the Thai Ridgeback. A breed standard has also been issued by the American Rare Breed Association (ARBA). ARBA includes the Carolina in their Group 5 along with the Canaan dog and the New Guinea singing dog. In July 2017, the American Kennel Club (AKC, the largest dog breed registry in the United States) accepted the Carolina Dog breeding program into its Foundation Stock Service (FSS), the first step toward official AKC breed recognition. AKC has the dog listed under their \\"Hound\\" group. Description Pet Carolina dog at rest in a yard Carolina dogs are a medium-sized; height ranges from 17 to 24 inches (45‚Äì61 cm), and weight from 30 to 65 pounds (15‚Äì30 kg). The ears are characteristic and are erect, very long, and moderately slender, tapering way up to elegantly pointed tips and they can be individually turned to the direction of any sound, providing extremely sensitive hearing. The dog ranges in build from muscular yet slender and graceful to somewhat stockier animals. The dogs legs are also graceful but strong. The hind midsection is firm and narrow. The overall build in a healthy, properly fed Carolina dog is svelte to somewhat stockier, strong and athletic. Paws are relatively large. The snout and the notably elongated, fox- like ears are spitz-like. The tail is usually upturned and often has a hooked kink in it. The coat is usually short and smooth, characteristic of a warm- climate dog. Colors vary, and may include reddish ginger, buff, fawn, black- and-tan, or piebald with or without white areas on toes, chest, tail tip and muzzle. The eyes are at an oblique angle and almond shaped. The eyes vary in color, but are usually dark brown or medium to dark orange. The area along the edges of the eyes is often (but not always) a distinctive black \\"eyeliner\\" coloration which becomes more pronounced by contrast in lighter-colored dogs. The lips are often black, even in light-colored dogs. Frequently, puppies have a melanistic mask that usually fades as the adult coat comes in. Behavior and temperament =Breeding in the wild= Female Carolina dogs have three estrus cycles in quick succession, which settle into seasonal reproductive cycles when there is an abundance of puppies. This is thought to ensure quick breeding in the wild before diseases, like heartworm, take their toll. DNA evidence Carolina dog \\"Hunter\\" that participated in DNA testing Brisbin (1997) conjectured that some of the Carolina dog's ancestors arrived with prehistoric Americans. In 2013, a study looked at the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sampled from Carolina dogs. The study showed that 58% of the dogs carried universal haplotypes that could be found around the world (haplotypes A16, A18, A19, and B1), 5% carried haplotypes associated with Korea and Japan (A39), and 37% carried a unique haplotype (A184) that had not been recorded before, and that is part of the a5 mtDNA sub-haplogroup that originated in East Asia. In contrast, the Australian dingo and the New Guinea singing dog both belong to haplotype A29 which is in the a2 sub-haplogroup, hence there is no genetic relationship in the mtDNA. Also in 2013, another study of several dog breeds in the Americas ‚Äì among them the Carolina dog, the Peruvian Hairless Dog, and the Chihuahua indicated an ancient migration from East Asia. In 2015, a study was conducted using mitochondrial (female lineage marker), Y-chromosome (male lineage marker), and autosomal genetic markers in 4,676 purebred dogs from 161 breeds and 549 village dogs from 38 countries. The study tested for the degree of admixture with European breed dogs. The study found no yDNA haplotypes indigenous to North American dogs outside of the Arctic. However, the mtDNA of Carolina dogs contained between 10%‚Äì35% pre- Columbian ancestry (mtDNA haplotype A184) that clustered with East Asian dogs. In 2018, a study compared sequences of fossil North American dogs with fossil Siberian dogs and modern dogs. The study indicates that dogs entered North America from Siberia 4,500 years after humans first arrived, were isolated for 9,000 years, and became extinct after European contact when they were replaced by Eurasian dogs; the pre-contact dogs exhibit a unique genetic signature that is now gone, with their nearest genetic relatives being the Arctic dog breeds. Three Carolina dogs in the study exhibited up to 33% pre-contact / arctic lineage, however the study could not rule out this being the result of admixture with modern Arctic dog breeds.

It implemented the provisions of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. The \\"narcotics\\" included in the Act are drugs such as heroin, cocaine and cannabis. The Act prohibits activities such as possession of a \\"narcotic\\", possession for the purpose of trafficking, cultivating, importing or exporting. Section 3 of the Act prohibits the possession of the \\"narcotic\\". A person is authorized to have a narcotic in his or her possession if he or she requires the narcotic for his business or profession and is a licensed dealer, a pharmacist, or a practitioner who is registered and entitled to practice in the province in which he has such possession. The maximum penalty for possession of narcotics is 7 years' imprisonment. Section 4 of the Act prohibits the trafficking of a narcotic or the possession of a narcotic for the purpose of trafficking. Section 2 of the Act defines \\"traffic\\" as (a) to manufacture, sell, give, administer, transport, send, deliver or distribute, or (b) to offer to do anything referred to in part (a). The maximum penalty for the offense of trafficking is life imprisonment. Section 5 of the Act prohibits importing or exporting narcotics. This offence has a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. The minimum penalty of importing or exporting narcotics is 7 years' imprisonment. Section 6 of the Act prohibits the growing of opium or marijuana without a federal licence. The penalty for the offence is a maximum of 7 years in prison. Revision of the Act In February 1994, Bill C-7 proposed a revision of illegal drug legislation. The new drug legislating aimed to be more coherent and consistent with Canada's obligations under the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances signed in 1988. Failing to succeed, the bill was reintroduced in the House of Commons on March 6, 1996, as Bill C-8. The House of Commons referred Bill C-8 to the Canadian Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which conducted a detailed study of it. The Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs proposed 15 amendments as well as the striking of a joint parliamentary committee of the House of Commons and the Senate, which would review Canada's drug policy. Bill C-8 was passed and received Royal Assent on June 20, 1996, and is thus Canada's current illegal drug legislation, known as Canada's Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.

The practice is commonly associated with the moors of Scotland where the principal quarry is red deer. However, the skill is found worldwide and is of extremely long standing. Many other species such as cats and hyenas also stalk their prey. Among hunter-gatherers, where their quarry is timid, stalking is a way of livelihood in order that they may catch what they hunt. Nowadays, stalking is frequently done for purposes of photography or observation of animal behaviour rather than for killing. Whatever the means of killing, the hunter has to be near the quarry in order to achieve it. Most animals are very sensitive to the presence of predators. In many cases, their sense of smell is highly developed, detecting anything with an unusual scent. The stalker therefore needs to approach from down-wind. Similarly, care needs to be taken to avoid being seen and heard. The deerstalker is a type of hat associated with Sherlock Holmes and Elmer Fudd. Notable for its slight rain-brim to the front and back, with a camouflage checked twill pattern and fold-down earpieces for selective warmth or to raise when listening for deer.

According to the manufacturer, the ingredients include peanuts, coconut oil, corn syrup and salt. In the United States, Beer Nuts are a staple of bar snacks and are often referred to as \\"the quintessential American bar food\\". Although Beer Nuts do not contain any beer, the name suggests that they are intended as a side dish to beer consumption. History BEER NUTS Production Plant and Company Store in Bloomington, Illinois The company began in 1937 when Edward Shirk and his son Arlo took over the Caramel Crisp confectionery store in Bloomington, Illinois, which sold a product called \\"Redskins,\\" \\"slightly sweet, lightly salted\\" glazed peanuts with their red skins intact. Beginning in 1950, this product was sold packaged as \\"Shirk's Glazed Peanuts\\" in local liquor stores. By 1953, local food distributor Eldredge C. Brewster helped expand the product to a national brand, and the Beer Nuts trademark was registered. By the 1960s, the product was available in all 50 states, and by the 1970s, the Shirks shipped 10 million pounds of Beer Nuts nationally. The company's product line has since expanded to other nuts, such as cashews and almonds, and various snack mixes, gift baskets and holiday packaged items. The Beer Nuts brand has been registered as a trademark since 1955 and has been successfully protected in court on several occasions from competing brands who used similar names. Beer Nuts has been described as ‚Äùsomething of a case study in brands avoiding genericization‚Äù. The company remains family owned with production still based in Bloomington, operating out of the 100,000-square-foot facility it relocated to in 1973. Other countries In Australia, beer nuts refers to salted roasted peanuts with the testa (red skin) intact. They are sold unglazed.

They are most famous for their 1989 debut album Leather Boyz with Electric Toyz and the two singles from it; \\"Rock and Roll (Is Gonna Set the Night on Fire)\\" and \\"I Wanna Be with You\\". The band broke up in 1991 but reformed in 1995, releasing several new records since that time, and continue to the present. History After rehearsing and playing a few shows on the Sunset Strip, Pretty Boy Floyd got their big break at MCA Records. Their debut album named Leather Boyz with Electric Toyz was released in 1989 and produced by producer Howard Benson. Two singles, and accompanying promotional videos were released from the album; \\"Rock and Roll (Is Gonna Set the Night on Fire)\\" and \\"I Wanna Be with You\\", which gained rotation on MTV. They were also having success in Europe at the time, by being the cover subject of hard rock magazine Kerrang! on December 16, 1989. Pretty Boy Floyd became embroiled in a dispute over the copyright of their band name, with a Canadian band, also called Pretty Boy Floyd. The Canadian group released their debut Bullets and Lipstik the same year, but after a negotiated settlement agreed to surrender use of the name. Their music featured on two film soundtracks, first the demo version of \\"48 Hours\\" was included on the 1989 film The Karate Kid Part III. Two years later the previously unreleased \\"Slam Dunk\\" was released on the Ellen Barkin movie Switch soundtrack. However, by that time MCA Records had dropped the band. By late 1995 Pretty Boy Floyd had reformed. They recorded a five-song EP, A Tale of Sex, Designer Drugs, and the Death of Rock n' Roll, in 1998. The band featured former Big Bang Babies guitarist Keri Kelli, Steve Summers (Steven Podwalski), Kristy Majors (Chris Maggiore, Jr.), and Kari Kane (Cary Ayers). In February 2006 they toured the United States and then broke up again. Majors released Sex, Drugs 'N' Rock N Roll and toured Europe in March 2007. On March 1, 2008, Majors and Kane joined Summers to play on stage at The Knitting Factory in Hollywood, California. In 2009, the band celebrated their 20th anniversary of the release of Leather Boyz with Electric Toyz with a world tour. Troy Patrick Farrell was hired as the drummer, and Criss 6 of Los Angeles-based M√∂tley Cr√ºe tribute band True 2 Crue was hired as the new bassist. Original bassist, Vinnie Chas (Charles Pusateri) died on April 5, 2010 from heart failure. Kari Kane (Cary Ayers) has worked as a special effects make-up artist since 2011. In April 2011, they announced a new album of original material and a tour to support the album. The band has also announced that Ben Graves formerly of Murderdolls and has been hired as the new drummer. They set out on the \\"America Rocks Tour\\" with Jack Russell's Great White, Faster Pussycat and Lillian Axe on June 15, 2012. During the tour, Majors and Summers got into an argument and the band ended up quitting the tour early. In April 2014 Majors announced his new band, \\"Kristy Majors and the Thrill Kills\\", which consisted of two previous members of Pretty Boy Floyd: JK Famous on bass and Ben Graves on drums. The band released one album and one music video. Summers kept busy by doing an album for the band Shameless as well as doing some solo shows worldwide. In July 2015, Steve Summers and Kristy Majors announced they would reunite together and were in the process of finishing their album. The new version of the band included JK Famous on bass and Tod \\"T\\" Burr on drums. The band debuted at the Cathouse Live 30th Anniversary Festival in Irvine, California, and had a string of shows to follow. The band continued to tour through 2016 and were awarded at the Hair Metal Awards show in Las Vegas alongside Scorpions and Twisted Sister. In August 2016, the band parted ways with Tod \\"T\\" Burr and brought back Ben Graves on drums. In December 2017, the band released \\"Public Enemies\\". The album was described by Majors as \\"The true follow up to Leather Boyz With Electric Toyz\\". They released a music video for the first single, \\"Feel The Heat\\". The album was well received by fans and critics which resulted in shows worldwide in 2018. Former Sweet F.A. Drummer Nick \\"Tricky\\" Lane was added to the lineup in early 2018, making his first appearance with the band at Frontiers Rock Festival in Italy.

The movie was directed by Robert Stevenson, produced by Bill Walsh and starred Helen Hayes, Stefanie Powers, Ken Berry, and Keenan Wynn reprising his villainous role as Alonzo Hawk (originated in the films The Absent-Minded Professor and Son of Flubber starring Fred MacMurray as Professor Ned Brainard). Herbie Rides Again was followed by two more theatrical sequels, Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo and Herbie Goes Bananas. A later theatrical sequel, Herbie: Fully Loaded, was released in 2005. The title is referenced in the trailer for the 1975 British comedy film Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Plot Notorious real estate magnate and demolition baron Alonzo Hawk (Keenan Wynn) is ready to build his newest indoor shopping center, the 130-story Hawk Plaza in San Francisco. His only obstacle is the 1892 firehouse inhabited by \\"Grandma\\" Steinmetz (Helen Hayes), widow of its former owner, Fire Captain Steinmetz, and aunt of mechanic Tennessee Steinmetz; her displaced neighbor, flight attendant Nicole Harris (Stefanie Powers); and their sentient machines: a 1963 Volkswagen Beetle known as Herbie, \\"the Love Bug;\\" an early 20th-century orchestrion that plays on its own; and a retired cable car from the defunct Clay Street Line, known as \\"Old No. 22.\\" Hawk has made numerous attempts at evicting Mrs. Steinmetz, intending to imprison her in a retirement home of his own making; but Hawk's lawyers have been unsuccessful in these attempts, while Mr. Barnsdorf, the construction boss, is growing impatient with Hawk's alleged indecision, reminding him that the whole thing is costing him $80,000 a day (equal to $ today). Therefore, when Hawk's lawyer nephew Willoughby Whitfield (Ken Berry) comes to visit him, Hawk sends him to Mrs. Steinmetz in their stead. Mrs. Steinmetz takes a liking to the young lawyer due to his youthful looks and good manners, in contrast to Hawk's henchmen. It is during her chatting with him that she explains the backstories of Herbie and Old No. 22, which Herbie found on a vacant lot whose owners were using it as a chicken house. She also explains that Tennessee has gone to Tibet to visit his ailing philosophy teacher, while Herbie's former owner, Jim Douglas, has gone to Europe racing foreign cars. On first meeting Willoughby, Nicole punches him in the face upon learning that he works for Hawk, but then tries to make up to him by offering him a ride in Herbie. Herbie goes berserk after Willoughby insults him twice, eventually taking the two to a car version of a joust tournament, which Herbie wins over a character named \\"The Red Knight\\" (strongly resembling retired racer Peter Thorndyke from the previous film), earning Willoughby a whopping $3.00 (equal to $ today). The two then go to lunch, but Nicole tells Willboughy an uninterrupted monologue on all the horrible things Hawk has done, including building a parking garage on the very same lot where Joe DiMaggio and his brothers learned to play baseball. Willoughby is upset about this and accidentally tells her that Hawk is his uncle, which enrages Nicole. She hits him with a broiled lobster in response, sending him splashing into the waters of Fisherman's Wharf below. Having become disillusioned towards his uncle, Willoughby decides to tell him face to face that he will not continue doing his dirty work. However, as he is approaching the office, he overhears his uncle threatening body harm on him for not getting in contact, so he resorts to telling him on the phone instead. Hawk flips out and shouts at his nephew, shattering the glass on the phone booth. Having lost him, Hawk decides to resort to harassment to force Mrs. Steinmetz out, the first act of which is to capture Herbie. Hawk is initially successful with his hotwiring skills, but while driving him on the street, Hawk insults the car who retaliates by causing a series of traffic collisions and jams (even going as far as barging into a police car, which causes a chain reaction of wrecks) and discards Hawk at his own office door, where Hawk orders his subordinates to capture Herbie again, followed by a policeman giving Hawk several tickets for traffic offenses. While Herbie takes Mrs. Steinmetz to market, they are chased by Hawk's men; whereupon Herbie makes several daring escapes culminating in travelling through the 1909 landmark Sheraton Palace Hotel and along a suspension cable on the Golden Gate Bridge, leaving Mrs. Steinmetz unfazed (and unaware) of his activity throughout. Hawk's secretary catches sight of Herbie on the bridge, but Hawk assumes she's getting hysterical and orders her to take two aspirins and lie down. Willoughby initially tries to go home in disguise, but is convinced by Nicole to stay after she hears him criticize his uncle while talking to his mother on the telephone. Mrs. Steinmetz asks Nicole and Willoughby to pick up some more groceries for her, and then suggests that they ought to drive to the beach. Nicole insists that they will just go and get some broccoli, which Willoughby later confesses he doesn't like, but Herbie still goes to the beach as a result of Hawk's personal chauffeur chasing him, leading Nicole to think that Mrs. Steinmetz talked him into doing it. They enjoy a nice moment at the beach, with Willoughby and Nicole falling for each other. While heading home, they discover that the roadway has been blocked (due to Hawk's chauffeur having bribed a man to do so), so Herbie resorts to surfing through the coastal bay to find an alternate route. On their return to the firehouse after dark, they find that every item of furniture has been removed by Hawk; whereupon Mrs. Steinmetz, Willoughby, Nicole, and Herbie track the theft to a warehouse. The four break in and recover Steinmetz's belongings, all of which had been loaded into \\"No. 22.\\" Upon hearing Willoughby's voice, the orchestrion attracts their attention by playing \\"Pomp and Circumstance.\\" Hawk's hired security guards catch them in the act, but Herbie's acts of pushing other items off the warehouse shelves trap them and allow the trio to escape. Mrs. Steinmetz rides in \\"No. 22,\\" while Willoughby and Nicole follow in Herbie. An inebriated old-timer named Judson (John McIntire) joins Mrs Steinmetz aboard \\"No. 22,\\" thinking himself on a public cable car. Hawk pursues upon discovering the trio escaped, but Herbie distracts him and later rescues Mrs. Steinmetz and Judson from a potential crash after \\"No. 22\\" rolls down a hill (as well as into a building during a special dinner party) by getting Willoughby close enough so that he can jump aboard and use the handbrake. During this time, Mrs. Steinmetz becomes enamored with Judson (while being entirely oblivious to the fact the car is rolling down the hill). The next morning, Mrs. Steinmetz decides to confront Hawk herself. Accompanied by Willoughby in spite of Nicole telling him not to let her do this, Mrs. Steinmetz drives Herbie onto the window-cleaning machine of Hawk‚Äôs skyscraper to reach his 28th-floor office (after Hawk fired his window cleaner), where they overhear a telephoned conversation with Loostgarten (Chuck McCann), an independent demolition agent, about the deal to demolish the firehouse. In response, she activates the window cleaning machine to fill the office with foam and water. This done, Herbie pursues Hawk around the building's perimeter (in response to Hawk throwing an ashtray at him) - even following him outside onto a ledge - until Mrs Steinmetz orders him to desist by mentioning a used car lot, and saying she would have to hate to call the used car man, Mr. Honest Al. Disguising his voice to resemble his uncle's, Willoughby directs Loostgarten to demolish Hawk's own house. Late that evening, Loostgarten telephones Hawk to confirm the demolition, waking Hawk from several nightmares showing himself at the mercy of Herbie; Hawk then gives confirmation, but realizes too late that he has condemned his own residence, and subsequently attacks Loostgarten after a portion of his house is collapsed from a wrecking ball. In the morning, Hawk calls a truce with Mrs. Steinmetz (as well as plant a phony story in the newspaper with the headline \\"HAWK GIVES UP\\"!), and thinking him to be sincere, Willoughby and Nicole go for dinner (to the same restaurant they were before when Nicole hit Willoughby with the broiled lobster), while Mrs. Steinmetz invites Judson to a similar meeting; in spite of this, Hawk violates the truce by sending earthmovers to crush the firehouse and its inhabitants, prompting Herbie to go in search of Nicole and Willoughby. In the absence of Herbie, the only means of defense is an antique fire hose, which Judson uses against the earthmovers, until it explodes and sprays all over him. Having obtained Nicole and Willoughby, Herbie rounds up several other Volkswagen Beetles from various places in the city (some of which leave their owners behind), and comes after Hawk and his men as an army and ruin his scheme, taking advantage of Hawk's irrational fear of Herbie. Hawk is pursued from the grounds by Herbie, and after nearly getting knocked down by a police car, Hawk is arrested after telling his bizarre tale of an army of Beetles chasing him. Later, Nicole and Willoughby are married, and ride Herbie through an arch formed by his new Volkswagen Beetle friends.

Dan Tobin, Raymond Bailey, Iggie Wolfington, Robert S. Carson, and John Zaremba played some of Hawk's attorneys; Disney regular Norman Grabowski played \\"Security guard #2;\\" John Myhers played the San Francisco's Office of the President announcer; and Alan Carney played a judge at the Chicken Tournament. =Deleted scenes= The GAF View-Master reel set for the film shows a still from a deleted sequence where one of Hawk's nightmares has him about to be treated by a pair of white VW Beetle doctors, who decide to \\"take his carburetor out and have a look at it\\". As they approach Hawk, he is woken by Loostgarten. =Vehicles= The Herbies used for the film consisted both of 1963 and 1965 Beetles. The included 1965 models make for some bad continuity errors as the windows are noticeably larger on the 1965 cars. This was to become worse in subsequent Herbie films as even later model cars were included. One of the VW Beetles used in the deleted nightmare sequence (see above) was first used in The Love Bug as a stunt car during the El Dorado race (also used for interior filming). Many years after Herbie Rides Again, the car's red cross, mechanical arms, and eyeball headlights were removed and restored to former appearance. =\\"World's Highest Building\\"= \\"Hawk Plaza\\" is shown as a shining, twin-tower 130-story San Francisco skyscraper touted as \\"The World's Highest Building\\". Coincidentally, The Towering Inferno, released six months later, featured \\"The Glass Tower,\\" a shining, single-tower 138-story San Francisco skyscraper touted as \\"The Tallest Building in the World.\\" In actuality, New York's twin towers of the World Trade Center, \\"The Tallest Buildings in the World\\" had officially opened in 1973, and Chicago's 108-story Sears Tower claimed that title in May 1974, just one month before Herbie Rides Again was released. Release =Box office= Herbie Rides Again opened on June 6, 1974 in 2,178 theaters and 1,761 drive-in theaters. The film grossed $38,229,000 at the United States and Canada box office, generating Disney $17,500,000 in theatrical rentals. The film earned rentals of around $13,300,000 overseas, giving worldwide rentals of almost $31 million. =Home media= Herbie Rides Again was released on VHS on October 15, 1981, re-released on November 6, 1985, January 5, 1992, October 28, 1994 and September 16, 1997.

He fought with a volunteer corps of escaped Virginia Colony slaves in the Ethiopian Regiment and the \\"Black Brigade\\" associators. Tye died from tetanus and lockjaw from a musket wound in the wrist following a short siege in September 1780 against Captain Joshua Huddy. Tye was one of the most feared and effective guerrilla leaders opposing the American patriot forces in central New Jersey.\\"Colonel Tye\\", Africans in America, PBS Early life and slavery Titus Cornelius was born into slavery in Colt's Neck, Monmouth County, Province of New Jersey and originally owned by John Corlies, a Quaker. Corlies's farm was located along the Navesink River, near the town of Shrewsbury, and Titus worked there in his early life. At the onset of the American Revolution, there were about 8,200 slaves in the Province of New Jersey, second only to the Province of New York among the northern American colonies, in both the number and percentage of African- Americans. Corlies, Titus's owner, held slaves despite his denomination's increasing opposition to slavery. By the 1760s, it was Quaker practice to teach slaves how to read and write and to free them at age 21. Yet, Corlies gave his slaves \\"no learning [and was] not inclined to give them any\\". Known to be hard on his slaves, Corlies severely whipped them for minor causes. Corlies also kept his slaves past the age of 21, and he was one of the last slaveholders in the region. In late 1775, a delegation from the Shrewsbury Meeting of the Society of Friends approached Corlies about his treatment of his slaves. The group of Quakers disapproved of Corlies's refusal to provide his slaves an education and his lack of adherence to the 1758 Quaker edict to end slavery. Corlies responded by saying that \\"he has not seen it his duty to give [the slaves] their freedom\\". Titus learned on his own about property, wealth, commodities, and the political leanings of the families in the area. Later, in 1778, the Society of Friends revoked Corlies's membership because of his unyielding refusal to emancipate his slaves. Prelude to Revolution left In November 1775, John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore, the royal governor of Virginia, issued a proclamation offering freedom to all slaves and indentured servants who would leave American masters and join the British. Lord Dunmore's act successfully prompted conspiracy among slaves in the Atlantic region, as many African Americans left their rebel masters to join the British. The proclamation and the disruption of the war contributed to an estimated nearly 100,000 slaves escaping during the Revolution, some to join the British. Planters considered Dunmore's offer a \\"diabolical scheme\\"; it contributed to their support for the Patriot cause. John Corlies's runaway advertisement for Tye Titus Cornelius coincidentally escaped from Corlies's property the day after Dunmore's proclamation and he joined British forces. Titus observed the Quakers' unsuccessful attempts to persuade Corlies to free his slaves. Reaching his twenty-first birthday also inspired Titus to escape, as it marked the age when most Quakers freed their slaves. Carrying only a small amount of clothing \\"drawn up at one end with string\\", Titus left Corlies's property and walked toward Williamsburg, Virginia. Corlies placed advertisements in Pennsylvania newspapers, promising a reward of \\"three pounds of proclamation money\\" for capturing Titus. American Revolutionary War Battle of Monmouth =Ethiopian Regiment service= Assuming the adopted name of \\"Tye\\", Titus enlisted in the Ethiopian Regiment. In his first experience seeing action at the Battle of Monmouth in June 1778, Tye captured Captain Elisha Shepard of the Monmouth militia and brought him to his imprisonment at the Sugar House in British-occupied New York City. Fought near Freehold, New Jersey, the Battle of Monmouth proved to be indecisive militarily, but it introduced British and Patriot forces to Tye's great ability as a soldier. =Leadership of Black Brigade= Colonel Tye's knowledge of the topography of Monmouth County and his bold leadership soon made him a well-known and feared Loyalist guerrilla commander. The British paid him and his group, consisting of blacks and whites, to destabilize the region. Orchestrated by Royal Governor William Franklin, the Loyalist son of Benjamin Franklin, this plan was an act of retaliation, in response to the Patriot confiscation of Tory properties. When Monmouth Patriots began to hang captured Tories under the vigilante law that governed Monmouth County, Franklin and other British officials raided Patriot towns. On July 15, 1779, accompanied by a Tory named, John Moody and 50 African Americans, Tye executed a daring raid on Shrewsbury, New Jersey, during which they captured 80 cattle, 20 horses, and William Brindley and Elisha Cook, two well-known inhabitants. British officers paid Tye and his men five gold guineas for their successful raids. Tye and his fellow guerrilla fighters operated out of a forested base called Refugeetown in Sandy Hook. They often targeted wealthy, slaveholding Patriots during their assaults, which frequently took place at night. Tye led several successful raids during the summer of 1779, seizing food and fuel, taking prisoners, and freeing many slaves. By the winter of 1779, Colonel Tye served with the \\"Black Brigade\\", a group of 24 black Loyalists. Tye's group worked in tandem with a white Loyalist unit, known as the \\"Queen's Rangers\\", to defend British-occupied New York City. Traveling undetected into the towns of Monmouth County, Tye and his men seized cattle, forage, and silverplate, and returned the resources to the weakened British forces. The Black Brigade also helped to usher escaping slaves to their freedom inside British lines, and later assisted their transportation to Nova Scotia for resettlement. They also raided patriot sympathizers in New Jersey, captured them, and brought them to the British in return for rewards. Due to their unjust treatment as slaves, the Black Brigade often aimed their raids at former masters and their friends. Because the members of the Black Brigade knew the homes of Patriots from their time as slaves, the Patriots feared the Black Brigade more than the regular British army. German Lutheran Pastor Henry Muhlenberg Letter from David Forman to Governor Livingston describing Tye's attacks Henry Muhlenberg, a German Lutheran pastor sent to the colonies as a missionary, commented on how formidable the Black Brigade was: \\"The worst is to be feared from the irregular troops whom the so-called Tories have assembled from various nationalities‚Äì for example, a regiment of Catholics, a regiment of Negroes, who are fitted for and inclined towards barbarities, are lack in human feeling and are familiar with every corner of the country.\\" Reports that African Americans planned massacres of whites in Elizabeth and in Somerset County inflamed the local population's fear of Tye and his men. Led by David Forman, the brigadier general of the New Jersey militia, the Monmouth County Whigs organized the Association for Retaliation to protect themselves against Tye and other Loyalist raids. Panicked white Patriots pleaded with Governor William Livingston to send assistance. For example, David Forman wrote to Livingston detailing the extent of Tye's attacks. Livingston responded by invoking martial law. This was a catalyst that convinced more African Americans to flee to British-held New York. For example, 29 male and female African Americans left slave owners in Bergen County during this time. In response, Livingston and his officials encouraged slaveholders to remove their slaves to more remote parts of New Jersey. On March 30, 1780, the Black Brigade captured Captain James Green and Ensign John Morris. In the same raid, Tye and his men looted and burned the home of John Russell, a Patriot known for his raids on Staten Island. Shortly thereafter, Tye and his men killed Russell and wounded his young son. Beginning in June 1780, Tye led more attacks in Monmouth County. His forces attacked and killed Joseph Murray in his home in retaliation for Murray's vigilante executions of loyalists. He also raided Barnes Smock, a leader of Patriot militia in Monmouth County. Tye captured 12 of Smock's supporters and destroyed his artillery. In one noteworthy raid on June 22, 1780, Tye and his men captured James Mott, the second major in the Monmouth's militia regiment; James Johnson, a captain in the Hunterdon militia, and 6 other militia men. On September 1, 1780, Tye led a small group of African Americans and Queen's Rangers to Colt's Neck, New Jersey, with the aim of raiding the home of Captain Joshua Huddy. Known for his swift execution of captured Loyalists, Huddy was an important target for Tye and his band. Tye briefly captured Huddy, but in a surprise attack, a party of Patriots helped Huddy escape. Huddy and a female servant had managed to resist Tye's band for two hours before the Loyalists set fire to the house. The Patriots injured Tye in the fight, firing a musket ball through his wrist. Death Colonel Tye developed tetanus and gangrene from the wound suffered in the raid against Huddy. Tye died two days later from the infection. Colonel Blucke, the new leader of Black Brigade Colonel Stephen Blucke, who commanded the Black Loyalist unit, the Black Company of Pioneers, led Tye's troops following his death. Blucke successfully led the group for the rest of the war, even operating after the British surrender at Yorktown. On March 24, 1782, a group of avenging Tories captured the rebel Huddy and interned him aboard a British prison ship. On April 12, 1782, the Tories hanged Huddy on a beach at the foot of the Navesink Highlands. Legacy Often considered one of the most effective and respected African-American soldiers of the Revolution, Tye made significant contributions to the British cause. Although never commissioned an officer by the British Army, Colonel Tye earned his honorary title as a sign of respect for his tactical and leadership skills. The British often granted such titles to other noteworthy black officers in Jamaica and other West Indian islands. The British army did not formally appoint anyone of African descent to such positions; however, the Royal Navy did commission black officers. Tye's knowledge of the swamps, rivers, and inlets in Monmouth County was integral to the British efforts in New Jersey during the war. As the commander of the Black Brigade, he led raids against American patriots, seized supplies, and assassinated Patriot leaders during the war. Colonel Tye served as an example of the role of African Americans during the Revolutionary War. Lord Dunmore's proclamation involved the African-American population in the war in a manner not yet seen. The promise of freedom inspired African-American men like Tye to join the Loyalist cause. Tye and his men captured important Patriot militiamen, launched numerous raids, and seized scarce resources from the local population. Their actions gained the attention of Governor William Livingston, who invoked martial law in New Jersey as a result in an attempt to restore order. The actions of Tye and other former slaves provoked whites' fear that wartime abolition would cause further dislocation and disorder in the region. Further, Tye's exploits intensified white anxieties about slave revolt and served to reinforce anti-abolition sentiment.

Massaquoi. Content In his 1999 autobiography the author, former managing editor of Ebony, tells the story of his growing up in Hamburg. He was born in 1926 as son of a German mother and a Liberian law student, the only independent black African state at that time apart from Ethiopia. His grandfather was the Liberian consul-general to Hamburg. When his father and grandfather went back to Liberia in 1929, his mother decided to stay in Germany. She made her living working as a nurse, and she and the little boy had to move from the elegant villa to a modest cold- water apartment in the workers‚Äô quarter Barmbek. He was shunned but was never a target of Nazi persecution like Jews and Roma were. He was rebuffed when he applied for membership in the Hitler Jugend (Hitler Youth), while every young male Aryan German was obliged to be a member. Because he was underweight, he was not drafted to join the German Army. Background In the 1930s only a few black people lived in Germany, most of them in the Rhine area, children of German mothers and French-African soldiers. During World War I France had recruited troops from its African colonies, mainly from Senegal. These children in the French-occupied Rhineland were called Franzosenkinder (Frenchmen's children). In the northern part of Germany black people were so rare that most people had never seen one. Nazi Germans considered mixed race children, like Massaquoi, a threat to the racial purity they sought. Many black and mixed race children were rounded up and sterilized or used for scientific experiments. Some were held in concentration camps and some simply ‚Äúdisappeared.\\" Massaquoi was fortunate enough not to be detained by the Nazis and explains that, ‚Äúblacks were so few in numbers that they were relegated to low-priority status in the Nazis' lineup for extermination.\\" In the book, Hans Massaquoi describes his childhood dream to join the Hitler Youth. The Hitler Youth was established in 1926 to recruit soldiers, but in 1933 it transitioned to a new role teaching children loyalty to Hitler and Nazism. In German schools like the one Massaquoi attended, children were taught ‚Äúlove for Hitler, obedience to state authority, militarism, racism, and anti-Semitism.‚Äù When Massaquoi describes his longing to be a ‚Äúgood German‚Äù like he was taught in school, and is greatly disappointed when he is told he cannot join the Hitler Youth like his classmates who all ‚Äúhad cool uniforms and they did exciting things ‚Äî camping, parades, playing drums.\\" Translation to German and screenplay Destined to Witness, in German titled Neger, Neger, Schornsteinfeger (Negro, Negro, Chimney Sweep), was a great success in Germany, remaining on top of the bestselling list of the German weekly Der Spiegel for a couple of months. A screenplay has been adapted from the book and movie shooting started in 2005. The film was run first on October 1 and 2 in 2006 as a two-parter on German ZDF TV channel.

They are shrubs or small trees with leaves that are sometimes flat, otherwise circular in cross section in which case they are sometimes divided. The flowers are usually arranged in groups in leaf axils and resemble those of other genera, especially Grevillea. Hakeas have woody fruit which distinguishes them from grevilleas which have non-woody fruit which release the seeds as they mature. Hakeas are found in every state of Australia with the highest species diversity being found in the south west of Western Australia. Description Plants in the genus Hakea are shrubs or small trees. Some species have flat leaves, whilst others have leaves which are needle-like, in which case they are sometimes divided and sometimes have a groove on the lower surface. The flowers are arranged in groups in leaf axils and are surrounded by bracts when in bud. The flowers have both male and female parts and are borne on a short stalk called a pedicel. The sepals and petals, jointly called tepals, form a curved tube which sometimes splits open as the flower develops. The style is longer than the tepal tube and is curved before its tip is released. When released, the tip of the style is a pollen- presenter. The fruit of hakeas is woody and persists on the plant until burned in a bushfire or until the plant dies. The fruit then splits open to release two winged seeds. Hakeas are similar to other plants in the Family Proteaceae, but have undivided leaves arranged alternately, sessile flowers arranged in loose groups in the axils of leaves or bracts, unlike those in the Banksia. Hakeas are similar to species of Grevillea but are distinguished from them in having persistent, woody fruits. (Those of grevilleas are not persistent and not woody. The upper and lower surfaces of the leaves of hakeas are similar (dissimilar in grevilleas), and the ovary and style are glabrous (but hairy in grevilleas). Taxonomy and naming The genus Hakea was first formally described in 1797 by Heinrich Schrader and Johann Christoph Wendland and the description was published in Sertum Hannoveranum. The genus is named after Baron Christian Ludwig von Hake, an 18th-century German patron of botany. Distribution Species of hakea are found in all states of Australia. Horticulture Hakeas are popular ornamental plants in gardens in Australia, and in many locations are as common as grevilleas and banksias. Several hybrids and cultivars have been developed, including 'Burrendong Beauty'. They are best grown in beds of light soil which are watered but still well drained. Some showy western species, such as Hakea multilineata, H. francisiana and H. bucculenta, require grafting onto hardy stock such as Hakea salicifolia for growing in more humid climates, as they are sensitive to dieback. Many species, particularly eastern Australian species, are notable for their hardiness, to the point they have become weedy. Hakea gibbosa, H. sericea, and H. drupacea (previously H. suaveolens) have been weeds in South Africa, Hakea laurina has become naturalized in the eastern states of Australia and is considered an environmental weed, and Hakea salicifolia, Hakea gibbosa, and Hakea sericea are invasive weeds in New Zealand.

Ball worked in India for twenty years before returning to take up a position in Ireland. Valentine was born in Dublin, the second son of Robert Ball and Amelia Gresley Hellicar. He received his early education at Chester and later at the private schools of Dr. Henry and Dr. Benson at Dublin. He then went to the University of Dublin obtaining a B.A. in 1864, M.A. in 1872 and LL.D. in 1889. He was elected Fellow of the Geological Society of London in 1874. Ball joined the Geological Survey of India in 1864 and served until 1881. He also contributed to studies in ornithology and anthropology. He was made a Fellow of the Calcutta University in 1875. His expertise on central India where he had explored for coal-fields also led to his advice being sought for the alignment of the railway line to be laid between Bombay and Calcutta. He was also among the early scientists who visited Narcondam Island in 1873 along with James Wood-Mason. Returning to Ireland in 1881, he became professor of geology and mineralogy at the University of Dublin. In 1883 he became director of the Dublin Science and Art Museum, now the National Museum of Ireland. He was a secretary of the Royal Geological Society. He was a regular contributor to Stray Feathers, the ornithological journal founded by Allan Octavian Hume. The Andaman scops owl (Otus balli) was named after him by Hume. His writings included Jungle-Life in India (1880), The Diamonds, Coal, and Gold of India (1881), The Economic Geology of India (1881) and numerous notes to the journals. A list of 62 of his publications was included as an appendix to his book Jungle Life in India. A translation of Tavernier's Travels in India (1889) was published posthumously by his widow. Ball married Mary, the eldest daughter of John Stewart Moore, of Moyarget, Antrim in 1869 and they had two daughters Maude Mary Ball and Ethel Gresley Ball who became artists while their only son Robert Gordon served in the West African army medical staff and was invalided in Togo.Biographical note in the second edition of the translation of Tavernier's Travels in India Publications 150px *Ball, V. 1874.

Fine's work assimilated neoclassical, romantic, and serial elements. Composer Virgil Thomson described Fine's \\"unusual melodic grace\\" while Aaron Copland noted the \\"elegance, style, finish and...convincing continuity\\" of Fine's music.http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/collections/fine/index.html Fine was a member of a close-knit group of Boston composers in the mid-20th century who were sometimes called the \\"Boston Six\\" or \\"Boston School.\\" Other members of the Boston School included Arthur Berger, Leonard Bernstein, Aaron Copland, Lukas Foss, and Harold Shapero. Life Fine was born in Boston, Massachusetts, where he studied piano, and received both bachelor's and master's degrees from Harvard University, where he was a pupil of Walter Piston. Fine was a conducting pupil of Serge Koussevitzky, served as pianist for the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and studied composition with Nadia Boulanger at the Fontainebleau School of Music in Paris and at Radcliffe College. From 1939 until 1950, he taught music theory at Harvard and conducted its Glee Club, becoming a close associate of Leonard Bernstein, Igor Stravinsky and Aaron Copland. From 1950, he taught at Brandeis University, where he was Walter S. Naumburg Professor of Music and founded the School of Creative Arts. Between 1946 and 1957, he also taught composition at the Tanglewood Music Festival in the Berkshires. Irving Fine died in Natick, Massachusetts in August 1962. He was 47 years of age. The cause of death was heart disease.David C. F. Wright, \\"Irving Fine\\", biography, written 1982, published as a booklet by the author, 1983. Reprinted at Wrightmusic.com (accessed September 15, 2015). Music Among Fine's compositions are a violin sonata; a string quartet; Fantasia for string trio; Music for Piano; Partita for wind quintet; Toccata concertante for orchestra; Notturno for strings and harp; Serious Song, subtitled a \\"lament for string orchestra\\"; Diversions for piano and orchestra; and the Symphony (1962), which premiered at Tanglewood less than two weeks before his untimely death following a heart attack (Fine conducted the premiere when Charles Munch, who was originally to have conducted, fell ill). Fine's choral works, which are frequently performed, include two sets of choruses from Alice in Wonderland; Childhood Fables for Grown-ups, settings of various poems about his composer friends, including Leonard Bernstein, Lukas Foss, and Harold Shapero; The Choral New Yorker, The Hour-Glass, McCord's Menagerie, and Mutability song cycles; and others. He also created choral arrangements of his colleague and friend Aaron Copland's Old American Songs. Educational legacy Notable composition students of Irving Fine include Gustav Ciamaga, No√´l Lee, Halim El-Dabh, and Richard Wernick. Towards the end of his life, Fine notably collaborated with Wernick on the musical Maggie, a work based on the Stephen Crane novel of the same name. A Professorship of Music at Brandeis University is named in Fine's honor. The composer Arthur Berger served as Irving G. Fine Professor of Music from 1969 to 1980 (and as Emeritus Professor until his death in 2003). The current Irving G. Fine Professor of Music is Eric Chasalow. Brandeis University is also home to the Irving Fine Society, founded in 2006 by music director Nicholas Alexander Brown. The society comprises the Irving Fine Singers and the Gifford 5, a woodwind quintet. The mission of the society is to perform \\"the music of 20th and 21st century composers who have made significant contributions to the longevity of classical music,\\" frequently performing the music of its namesake, Irving Fine.

He represented the state of Maryland in the Continental Congress, and the second district of Maryland in the House of Representatives. Early life Joshua was born to John Seney (1730‚Äì1795) and Ruth (n√©e Benton) Seney in 1756 on the family farm near Church Hill in the Province of Maryland. His grandfather, Solomon, was a French Huguenot refugee who arrived in Maryland around 1727. By the time Joshua was born the family were prosperous farmers and planters. He was educated in local schools and then attended the College of Philadelphia (now the University of Pennsylvania), graduating in 1773. Career After Seney was admitted to the bar, he confined himself to a private practice. In 1779, he served as the High Sheriff of Queen Anne's County, Maryland. =Continental Congress= During the early days of the Revolutionary War Seney busied himself with the care of the family's farms since his father was active as a Lt. Colonel in the militia. He was appointed the sheriff of Queen Anne's County in 1779. He was elected to the Maryland state House of Delegates, and served there from 1785 to 1787. In 1788, Seney was sent as a delegate to the Continental Congress. =United States Congress= After returning to his farm, Seney was again called to political service when he was elected to the First United States Congress in 1789. He was re-elected for the 1791‚Äì1793 term as an Anti- Administration candidate but resigned from Congress on December 6, 1792 to take up his new duties as a judge of the state court for the district of Baltimore. He served as Chief Justice of the Third Judicial District of Maryland from 1792 to 1796. In 1798, Seney ran for Congress again as a Republican. He defeated the incumbent Federalist, William Hindman but died before taking office. Personal life Seney was married to Frances \\"Fanny\\" Nicholson (1771‚Äì1851) of the prominent Nicholson family of Maryland. Fanny was the daughter of Commodore James Nicholson and was the sister of Catherine \\"Kitty\\" Nicholson (wife of William Few), Hannah Nicholson (wife of Albert Gallatin), James Witter Nicholson (husbanbd of Ann Griffin, daughter of Isaac Griffin), Maria Nicholson (wife of John Montgomery), and Jehoiadden Nicholson (wife of James Chrystie).

It is also the name of a Christian feast day commemorating this visit, celebrated on 31 May in Western Christianity (2 July in calendars of the 1263‚Äì1969 period, and in the modern regional calendar of some countries whose bishops' conferences wanted to retain the original date, notably Germany and Slovakia) and 30 March in Eastern Christianity. The episode is one of the standard scenes shown in cycles of the Life of the Virgin in art, and sometimes in larger cycles of the Life of Christ in art.  Narrative  Statue of the Visitation at Church of the Visitation in Ein Karem, Israel Mary visits her relative Elizabeth; they are both pregnant: Mary with Jesus, and Elizabeth with John the Baptist. Mary left Nazareth immediately after the Annunciation and went \\"into the hill country ... into a city of Judah\\" () to attend to her cousin () Elizabeth. There are several possibilities as to exactly which city this was, including Hebron, south of Jerusalem, and Ein Karem. The journey from Nazareth to Hebron is about in a direct line, probably up to half as far again by road, depending on the route taken. Elizabeth was in the sixth month before Mary came (). Mary stayed three months, and most scholars hold she stayed for the birth of John. Given the prevailing cultural traditions and needs for security, it is probable that Joseph accompanied Mary to Judah then returned to Nazareth, and came again after three months to take his wife home. The apparition of the angel, mentioned in Matthew 1:19‚Äì25, may have taken place then to end the tormenting doubts of Joseph regarding Mary's maternity. In the Gospel of Luke, the author's accounts of the Annunciation and Visitation are constructed using eight points of literary parallelism to compare Mary to the Ark of the Covenant. Some Catholic commentators have maintained that the purpose of this visit was to bring divine grace to both Elizabeth and her unborn child. Even though he was still in his mother's womb, John became aware of the presence of Christ, and leapt for joy as he was cleansed from original sin and filled with divine grace. Elizabeth also responded and recognised the presence of Jesus, and thus Mary exercised her function as mediatrix between God and man for the first time.Holweck, Frederick. Visitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 11 October 2013 In response to Elizabeth, Mary proclaims the Magnificat (My soul doth magnify the Lord) . The word \\"blessed\\" is rendered in Greek not by the word \\"makarios\\" but as \\"evlogimeni\\", which is the feminine second person singular, used only this once in the New Testament. Its masculine third person singular counterpart \\"evlogimenos\\" is used only for Jesus and only on this occasion and when he was welcomed into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday with: \\"Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord\\". The masculine/mixed gender third person plural \\"evlogimenoi\\" is used by Jesus only when referring to the righteous who are to be raised to life in the Last Judgement.  Feast  = Western Christianity = Eastern Christianity fresco of the Visitation in St. George Church in Kurbinovo, North Macedonia The theme of the Feast of the Visitation centers on Mary responding to the prompting of the Holy Spirit to set out on a mission of charity.Samaha S.M., Br. John M. The Visitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary (PDF) This feast is of medieval origin. In 1389 Pope Urban VI, hoping thereby to obtain an end to the Great Western Schism, inserted it at the urging of John of Jenstein, archbishop of Prague, in the Roman Calendar, for celebration on 2 July.Calendarium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969), p. 93 In the Tridentine Calendar, it was a Double. When that Missal of Pope Pius V was replaced by that of Pope Clement VIII in 1604, the Visitation became a Double of the Second Class, or, as it would be called from 1960 by Pope John XXIII's reform, a Second-Class Feast.General Roman Calendar of 1960 It continued to be assigned to 2 July, the day after the end of the octave following the feast of the birth of John the Baptist, who was still in his mother's womb at the time of the Visitation. The 1969 revision of the calendar moved it to 31 May, \\"between the Solemnity of the Annunciation of the Lord (25 March) and that of the Nativity of St. John the Baptist (24 June), so that it would harmonize better with the Gospel story.\\"Calendarium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969), p. 128 The Catholic Church in Germany (together with the Lutheran church) has, with the consent of the Holy See, kept 2 July date as a national variation of the General Roman Calendar. Similarly, the Catholic Church in Slovakia has also retained the original date, because of an important national pilgrimage to the Basilica of the Visitation in the town of Levoƒça that has been held in the first weekend of July since the 13th century. 2 July is observed also by Traditionalist Catholics who use a pre-1970 calendar, and by Anglicans who use the 1662 Book of Common Prayer (in some Anglican traditions it is merely a commemoration rather than a feast day). In the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church, the Visitation is the second Joyful Mystery of the Rosary. = Eastern Christianity = The celebration of a feast day commemorating this event in the Eastern Orthodox Church is of relatively recent origin, dating only to the 19th century. The impetus to establish a feast day in the Liturgical calendar of the Orthodox Church, and the composition of a service to be included in the Menaion, were the work of Archimandrite Antonin Kapustin (1817‚Äì1894), head of the Russian Orthodox Ecclesiastical Mission in Jerusalem. The Gorneye Convent in Jerusalem, which was built on the traditional site of the Meeting of the Theotokos (Virgin Mary) and St. Elizabeth, celebrates this Feast on 30 March. (Julian Calendar 30 March corresponds, until 2099, to Gregorian Calendar 12 April.) If 30 March falls between Lazarus Saturday and Pascha (Easter), the Visitation Feast is transferred to Bright Friday. Celebration of the Feast of the Visitation has not yet been accepted by all Orthodox jurisdictions. In Syriac Christianity the feast of the Visitation is celebrated on the third Sunday in the Season of Announcements prior to Christmas.

It also features Barbara Shelley, Francis Matthews, Suzan Farmer, Richard Pasco, Dinsdale Landen and Ren√©e Asherson. The story is largely fictionalized, although some of the events leading up to Rasputin's assassination are very loosely based on Prince Yusupov's account of the story. For legal reasons (Yusupov was still alive when the film was released), the character of Yusupov was replaced by Ivan (Matthews). The emphasis is on Rasputin's terrifying powers both to work magic and to seduce women. Plot In the Russian countryside, Rasputin heals the sick wife of an innkeeper (Derek Francis). When he is later hauled before an Orthodox bishop for his sexual immorality and violence, the innkeeper springs to the monk's defence. Rasputin protests that he is sexually immoral because he likes to give God \\"sins worth forgiving\\" (loosely based on Rasputin's rumored connection to Khlysty, an obscure Christian sect which believed that those deliberately committing fornication, then repenting bitterly, would be closer to God). He also claims to have healing powers in his hands, and is unperturbed by the bishop's accusation that his power comes from Satan. Rasputin heads for Saint Petersburg, where he forces his way into the home of Dr Zargo (Pasco), from where he begins his campaign to gain influence over the Tsarina (Asherson). He manipulates one of the Tsarina's ladies-in-waiting, Sonia (Shelley), whom he uses to satisfy his voracious sexual appetite and gain access to the Tsarina. He places her in a trance and commands her to cause an apparent accident that will injure the czar's young heir Alexei, so that Rasputin can be called to court to heal him. After this success, he hypnotizes the Tsarina to replace her existing doctor with Zargo (who has previously been struck off after a scandal). However, Rasputin's ruthless pursuit of wealth and prestige, and increasing control over the royal household, attracts opposition. Sonia's brother, Peter (Landen), enraged by Rasputin's seduction of his sister, enlists the help of Ivan to bring about the monk's downfall. Peter, in challenging the monk, is horribly scarred by acid thrown in his face, and suffers a lingering death. Tricking Rasputin into thinking his sister Vanessa (Farmer) is interested in him, Ivan arranges a supposed meeting. However, Zargo has poisoned the wine and chocolates, which the Monk starts to consume. Soon Rasputin collapses, but the poison is not enough to kill him. In the ensuing struggle between the three men, Zargo is stabbed by Rasputin and quickly dies. Ivan manages to throw Rasputin out of the window to his death. Cast *Christopher Lee as Grigori Rasputin *Barbara Shelley as Sonia *Richard Pasco as Dr Boris Zargo *Francis Matthews as Ivan *Suzan Farmer as Vanessa *Dinsdale Landen as Peter *Ren√©e Asherson as Tsarina *Derek Francis as Innkeeper *John Welsh as The Abbot *Joss Ackland as The Bishop *Robert Duncan as Tsarvitch *Alan Tilvern as Patron *Bryan Marshall as Vassily *Brian Wilde as Vassily's Father Production Rasputin the Mad Monk was filmed back-to- back in 1965 with Dracula: Prince of Darkness, using the same sets at Hammer's Bray Studios. Lee, Matthews, Shelley and Farmer appeared in both films. In some markets, it was released on a double feature with The Reptile. It was the third collaboration between Christopher Lee and Don Sharp, following The Devil Ship Pirates and The Face of Fu Manchu. Lee later said, \\"The only way you can present him is the way he was historically described. He was a lecher and a drunk, and definitely had healing powers. So he was a saint and a sinner... There were very few good sides to him. Rasputin is one of the best things I‚Äôve done. \\" \\"I think it's the best thing Chris Lee's ever done,\\" said Sharp in 1992. \\"Rasputin was supposed to have had this ability to hypnotise people, well Chris practically developed that ability.\\"Murphy p 23 Filming started 8 June. Don Sharp says the budget was cut during filming, causing the loss of several key scenes. He also claims Yusopov's lawyers threatened Hammer shortly before filming was to commence, necessitating last minute rewriting of the script.Koetting p 11 A scene of Sonia's suicide was filmed but not shown. The original ending had the lifeless Rasputin lying on the ice with his hands held up to his forehead in benediction. However, it was considered controversial for religious reasons, and was removed. Stills of the original ending still exist. Sharp says the final fight scene between Francis Matthews and Christopher Lee was greatly cut by Tony Keys when Sharp had to leave the film during editing. Sharp had greatly enjoyed the experience of making his first two Hammer films - Kiss of the Vampire and Devil Ship Pirates - but not Rasputin.Koetting p 11 As a child in the 1920s, Lee had actually met Rasputin's killer, Felix Yusupov. In later life Lee met Rasputin's daughter Maria. A novelization of the film was written by John Burke as part of his 1967 book The Second Hammer Horror Film Omnibus. Reception According to Fox records, the film and The Reptile needed to earn $1,200,000 in rentals to break even and made $1,645,000, meaning it made a profit.

However, Germany participates in the NATO nuclear weapons sharing arrangements and trains for delivering United States nuclear weapons. Germany is among the powers which possess the ability to create nuclear weapons, but has agreed not to do so under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and Two Plus Four Treaty. Along with most other industrial nations, Germany produces components that can be used for creating deadly agents, chemical weapons, and other WMD. Alongside other companies from the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, India, the United States, Belgium, Spain, and Brazil, German companies provided Iraq with precursors of chemical agents used by Iraq to engage in chemical warfare during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War.Al Isa, I. K. (1-12-2003) Fresh information on the Iraqi chemical program; Iraqi money and German brains cooperated in building chemical weapons. Al Zaman, London. Federation of atomic scientists. Referenced 21-11-2006. History =World War I= One of the major combatants in World War I, Germany was the first to develop and use chemical weapons such as mustard gas and phosgene. These kinds of weapon were subsequently also employed by the Allies. The use of chemical weapons in warfare during the Great War was allegedly in violation of clause IV.2 'Declaration concerning the Prohibition of the Use of Projectiles with the Sole Object to Spread Asphyxiating Poisonous Gases' of the 1899 Hague Declarations, and more explicitly in violation of the 1907 Hague Convention on Land Warfare, which explicitly forbade the use of \\"poison or poisoned weapons\\" in warfare. =World War II= During World War II, Germany conducted an unsuccessful project to develop nuclear weapons. German scientists also did research on other chemical weapons during the war, including human experimentation with mustard gas. The first nerve gas, tabun, was invented by the German researcher Gerhard Schrader in 1937. During the war, Germany stockpiled tabun, sarin, and soman but refrained from their use on the battlefield. In total, Germany produced about 78,000 tons of chemical weapons. By 1945 the nation had produced about 12,000 tons of tabun and of sarin. Delivery systems for the nerve agents included 105 mm and 150 mm artillery shells, a 250 kg bomb and a 150 mm rocket.Smart, Jeffery K. Medical Aspects of Chemical and Biological Warfare : Chapter 2 ‚Äì History of Chemical and Biological Warfare: An American Perspective, (PDF: p. 14), Borden Institute, Textbooks of Military Medicine, PDF via Maxwell-Gunter Air Force Base, accessed 4 January 2009. Even when the Soviet army neared Berlin, Adolf Hitler decided not to use tabun in a last ditch effort against the Soviets. The use of tabun was opposed by Hitler's Minister of Armaments, Albert Speer, who, in 1943, brought IG Farben's nerve agent expert Otto Ambros to report to Hitler. He informed Hitler that the Allies had stopped publication of research into organophosphates (a type of organic compound that encompasses nerve agents) at the beginning of the war, that the essential nature of nerve gases had been published as early as the turn of the century, and that he believed that Allies could not have failed to produce agents like tabun. This was not in fact the case, but Hitler accepted Ambros's deduction, and Germany's tabun arsenal remained unused.Paxman, J.; Harris, R. (2002). A Higher Form of Killing: The Secret History of Chemical and Biological Warfare (2002 Rando edition). Random House Press. pp.82‚Äì84. =Cold War and beyond= As part of the accession negotiations of West Germany to the Western European Union at the London and Paris Conferences, the country was forbidden (by Protocol No III to the revised Treaty of Brussels of 23 October 1954) to possess nuclear, biological or chemical weapons. This was reiterated in domestic law by the War Weapons Control Act (Kriegswaffenkontrollgesetz). During the Cold War, nuclear weapons were deployed in Germany by both the United States (in West Germany) and the Soviet Union (in East Germany). Despite not being among the nuclear powers during the Cold War, Germany had a political and military interest in the balance of nuclear capability. In 1977, after the Soviet deployment of the new SS-20 IRBM, West German chancellor Helmut Schmidt expressed concern over the capability of NATO's nuclear forces compared to those of the Soviets. Later in the Cold War under the chancellorship of Helmut Kohl, the West German government expressed concern about the progress of the nuclear arms race. Particularly, they addressed the eagerness of Germany's NATO allies, the United States and United Kingdom, to seek restrictions on long-range strategic weapons while modernizing their short-range and tactical nuclear systems. Germany wanted to see such short range systems eliminated, because their major use was not deterrence but battlefield employment. Germany itself, straddling the division of the Eastern and Western blocs in Europe, was a likely battlefield in any escalation of the Cold War and battlefield use of nuclear weapons would be devastating to German territory. In 1957 the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) was created to promote the use of nuclear energy in Europe. Under cover of the peaceful use of nuclear power, West Germany hoped to develop the basis of a nuclear weapons programme with France and Italy.Die Erinnerungen, Franz Josef Strauss ‚Äì Berlin 1989, p. 314 The West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer told his cabinet that he \\"wanted to achieve, through EURATOM, as quickly as possible, the chance of producing our own nuclear weapons\\".Germany, the NPT, and the European Option (WISE/NIRS Nuclear Monitor) The idea was short-lived. In 1958 Charles De Gaulle became President of France, and Germany and Italy were excluded from the weapons project. Euratom continued as the European agency for the peaceful use of nuclear technology, falling under the institutions of the European Economic Community in 1967. Protest in Bonn against the deployment of Pershing II missiles in West Germany, 1981 Germany ratified the Geneva Protocol on 25 April 1929, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty on 2 May 1975, the Biological Weapons Convention on 7 April 1983 and the Chemical Weapons Convention on 12 August 1994. These dates signify ratification by the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany), during the division of Germany the NPT and the BWC were ratified separately by the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) (on 31 October 1969 and 28 November 1972, respectively). Before German reunification in 1990, both West and East Germany ratified the Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany. Germany reaffirmed its renunciation of the manufacture, possession, and control of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons. In addition to banning a foreign military presence in the former East Germany, the treaty also banned nuclear weapons or nuclear weapon carriers to be stationed in the area, making it a permanent Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone. The German military was allowed to possess conventional weapons systems with nonconventional capabilities, provided that they were outfitted for a purely conventional role. The United States provides about 60 tactical B61 nuclear bombs for use by Germany under a NATO nuclear weapons sharing agreement. The bombs are stored at B√ºchel Air Base and in time of war would be delivered by Luftwaffe Panavia Tornado warplanes. As well as being a breach of the Protocols to the (revised) Treaty of Brussels (terminated in 2010), many countries believe this violates Articles I and II of the Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty (NPT), where Germany has committed: :\\"... not to receive the transfer from any transferor whatsoever of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices or of control over such weapons or explosive devices directly, or indirectly ... or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices ...\\". The U.S. insists its forces control the weapons and that no transfer of the nuclear bombs or control over them is intended \\"unless and until a decision were made to go to war, at which the [NPT] treaty would no longer be controlling\\", so there is no breach of the NPT. However German pilots and other staff practise handling and delivering the U.S. nuclear bombs.Nassauer, O. (2001) Nuclear sharing: is it legal? Even if the NATO argument is considered legally correct, such peacetime operations could arguably contravene both the objective and the spirit of the NPT. Like other countries of its size and wealth, Germany has the skills and resources to create its own nuclear weapons quite quickly if desired. The Zippe-type centrifuge was, indeed, invented by captured Germans working in the Soviet Union in the 1950s, and URENCO operates a centrifuge uranium enrichment plant in Germany. There are also several power reactors in Germany that could be used to produce bomb-grade plutonium if desired. In 2007, former German defence secretary Rupert Scholz stated that Germany should strive to become a nuclear power.Tagesspiegel: Ex-Minister: Atomwaffen f√ºr Deutschland 27 January 2007 In September 2007 the French president Nicolas Sarkozy offered Germany to participate in the control over the French nuclear arsenal. Chancellor Merkel and foreign minister Steinmeier declined the offer however, stating that Germany \\"had no interest in possessing nuclear weapons\\".Spiegel Online International Due to concerns over Vladimir Putin's actions, Merkel reversed her position, stating to the German press, \\"As long as there are nuclear weapons in the world, we need to have these capabilities, as NATO says.\\"Deutsche Presse-Agentur, \\"Merkel Shifts Stance to Say NATO Must Keep Nuclear Defence,\\" 22 October 2010 NATO member states, including Germany, decided not to sign the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, a binding agreement for negotiations for the total elimination of nuclear weapons, supported by more than 120 nations.

His best known films were made for Hammer in the 1960s, and included The Kiss of the Vampire (1962) and Rasputin, the Mad Monk (1966). In 1965 he directed The Face of Fu Manchu, based on the character created by Sax Rohmer, and starring Christopher Lee. Sharp also directed the sequel The Brides of Fu Manchu (1966). In the 1980s he was also responsible for several hugely popular miniseries adapted from the novels of Barbara Taylor Bradford. Early Career =Early life= Sharp was born in Hobart, Tasmania, in 1921, according to official military records and his own claims, even though reference sources cite 1922 as his year of birth. He was the second of four children. He attended St Virgil's College and began appearing regularly in theatre productions at the Playhouse Theatre in Hobart, where he trained under a young Stanley Burbury. He later said this was prompted \\"by a desi re not to study to become an accountant, which is what my parents wanted for me.\\"Midnight p 14 Among the plays Sharp appeared in were You Can't Take It With You and Our Town. He also directed a production of Stage Door.Anthony Hayward, Don Sharp: Film director who made his mark with 'Kiss of the Vampire' from The Independent dated 29 December 2011, accessed 30 December 2011 He studied accountancy in the evenings but this was interrupted by war service. =War Service= Sharp enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force on 7 April 1941 and was transferred to Singapore. In addition to his military duties he appeared in radio and on stage with a touring English company. Among his radio performances were Escape and the Barretts of Wimpole Street. \\"The acting bug had definitely gotten hold of me,\\" says Sharp, \\"and I did a bit of it while I was in the RAAF as well, in the odd moment.\\" Sharp was invalided out before the city fell to the Japanese. He returned to Melbourne and recuperated at Heidelberg Hospital. He spent the majority of his war service in Melbourne, appearing in amateur theatre productions of \\"Quality Street\\" and \\"The Late Christopher Bean\\" as well as recorded broadcasts and ABC plays. In early 1943 he moved to Hobart. He appeared in a theatre production of Interval by Sumner Locke Elliott, also serving as assistant director. Following this he appeared in a theatre revue, Khaki Capers, notably in a sketch which figured a flag flown over the air force station in Singapore which Sharp had brought back with him. Sharp was discharged from the air force on 17 March 1944 at the rank of corporal. =Acting career= After the war Sharp did not want to return to Hobart. He auditioned for and won an understudy's position in J. C. Williamson Limited version of the Broadway comedy Kiss and Tell ; when a bout of laryngitis injured one of the leads two weeks later, Sharp stepped into the role. He toured in the production from 1944-1945 then went on to appear in such plays as Arsenic and Old Lace (1945) and The Dancing Years. He worked for Morris West's production company in radio and played a small role in Smithy (1946), one of the few feature films shot in Australia at this time. Sharp also toured Japan performing for the occupying troops there. From Japan he went to London in 1948. \\"\\"I could have gone on with a theatrical career in Australia,\\" says Sharp, \\"but what I really wanted was movies. So I went to England.\\" =Move to England= Arriving in England in 1948, Sharp got some stage work quickly \\"but I couldn't even get an appointment to see a casting director\\" for films. He was sharing a flat with an assistant director and they decided to make their own movie. He co-wrote Ha'penny Breeze (1950), with a fellow Australian, Frank Worth. Together with another man, Darcy Conyers, they formed a production company and raised finance to make the ¬£8,000 film. Sharp also played a leading role, did the accounts and helped with the direction. The film was not a large hit but it was theatrically released. Sharp also got a small role in a British radio adaptation of Robbery Under Arms (1950). Sharp said \\"Shortly after, a number of influential film people made contact with me, but none of them offered me a job as an actor‚Äî they all asked if I would write for them!\\"Midnight p 15 Sharp was unable to cash in on Ha'penny Breeze as he came down with tuberculosis and spent two years in hospital. When he recovered he got some acting roles in such films as The Planter's Wife (1952), Appointment in London (1953), The Cruel Sea (1953) and You Know What Sailors Are (1954). He also played the character Stephen \\"Mitch\\" Mitchell in the 1953 British science fiction radio series, Journey into Space. He began to turn increasingly to writing and directing. Sharp said his background as an actor was useful for his development as a director, in particular it developed his sense of timing: > You‚Äôve got to know, for example, a thing I was taught early in theatre ‚Äì if > there's a scene in a movie, in a play, that always gets good laughs, on a > good night, when there's a good and laughing audience, you‚Äôll get laughs in > the build-up to it, in the five or ten minutes beforehand, because it's a > good audience who's appreciative of what's going on. On a bad night, when > the audience are not laughing, increase your pace, get them at the point. > And this teaches you a control of speed and how to control an audience. . . > . Working with good actors, you get a feeling of timing with them; although > sometimes the timing between them can be good but their overall pace, which > is quite different, can be wrong ‚Äì its context in the film, because of the > situation in the film, perhaps there should be that little more urgency, > therefore pace, in the scene. He worked on the screenplay to Background (1953). A new government-backed film company, Group Three, had a brief to support new talent and Sharp sold them an original script called Child's Play (1954). Group Three liked it and bought a story of Sharp's, originally called The Norfolk Story. He turned this into a novel called Conflict of Wings (1954), the title under which it was filmed; Sharp collaborated on the screenplay with John Pudney. He and Pudney then wrote The Blue Peter (1955) for Group Three. Sharp also directed second unit. Director =Early Films= Child's Play and Blue Peter were children's films. Sharp turned director for The Stolen Airliner (1955) for the Children's Film Foundation, based on a script by Pudney. Sharp made some documentaries: As Old as the Windmill (1957), The Changing Life (1958), and Keeping the Peace (1959). After directing second unit on Carve Her Name with Pride (1958) and Harry Black (1958), he wrote and directed The Golden Disc (1959), the first British rock 'n' roll movie ‚Äì released a year before the Cliff Richard vehicle Expresso Bongo (1959) and a full two years ahead of Beat Girl (1960). It starred Mary Steele, who Sharp married two years earlier. He wrote and directed another film for the Children's Film Foundation, The Adventures of Hal 5 (1959). He followed it with Linda (1960), a teen drama starring Carol White for Independent Artists, which went out as a support feature for Saturday Night and Sunday Morning (1960) and is now considered a lost film. Then came a low-budget thriller, also for Independent Artists, The Professionals (1960), which screened on US TV as part of the Kraft Mystery Theatre. He went into TV, doing episodes of Ghost Squad (1961‚Äì62) and The Human Jungle (1963). He directed second unit on The Fast Lady (1962) for IA. He directed Two Guys Abroad (1962) with George Raft, which was intended as a pilot for a TV series or as a B movie, but ended up not being released at all. =Hammer Films and Harry Alan Towers= Sharp received an offer from Tony Hinds of Hammer Films who had seen The Professionals and was looking for a director for Hammer's vampire movie The Kiss of the Vampire (1963). Sharp had never seen a horror movie before but agreed after watching several Hammer films.Koetting p 8-9 According to his obituary Sharp helped make an \\"atmospheric, suspenseful gothic horror and giving a depth to the characters that was sometimes missing in Hammer's other vampire productions.\\" The Kiss of the Vampire is now one of Hammer's highest regarded horrors; Sharp's New York Times obituary says \\"Not a few Hammer fans contend that \\"The Kiss of the Vampire\\" is one of the greatest Gothic horror movies ever made\\". The Kiss of the Vampire was shot in 1962. Sharp followed it with another teen movie in the vein of The Golden Disc, It's All Happening (1963), with Tommy Steele.Koetting p 10 He returned to Hammer for a swashbuckler, The Devil-Ship Pirates (1964). It starred Christopher Lee, who would make several movies with Sharp.Koetting p 11 Sharp followed it with another in the horror genre, Witchcraft (1964), for producer Robert L. Lippert. Sharp called it \\"a little four-week movie, very quickly done, but it received some lovely notices\\". He contributed to the script of Legend of a Gunfighter (1964) and spent several months directing second unit on Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines (1965). Sharp sayd \\"I had to think very hard about going back to second unit after directing a half-dozen features‚Äî but it was so tempting, especially after my air force days. So I did it; and it was tremendously exciting, and a marvelous movie to work on.\\" Sharp did find shooting footage with old airplanes very slow - \\"you're fortunate if you can get two set-ups in a day\\" so when it was over he asked his agent to get him any job. Lippert had a sequel to The Fly, Curse of the Fly (1965), and Sharp did it. \\"I'm afraid they'd pretty much run out of ideas,\\" said Sharp who says he and the writer \\"both had the feeling, 'Oh dear, what a pity they're making another one'.\\"Midnight p 16 Sharp reteamed with Lee for The Face of Fu Manchu (1965), produced by Harry Alan Towers. Sharp later said \\"I like Harry, a great deal... but Harry will get more kick out of making $5 in a slightly crooked and fast way, than he would making $100 legitimately; he's a dealer rather than a movie maker, and he enjoys getting the best part of a deal. But he does have a certain enthusiasm, and a sense of showmanship. In order to make a good film while work-ing with Harry, you have to be insistent.\\" Fu Manchu was a big hit and led to four sequels; Sharp only directed the first of these, but he worked several more time for Towers who later said \\"I kept using Don because his films came in on budget and were without exception very successful. On top of that he was a most agreeable person of very good character ‚Äì no tantrums ‚Äì clear headed ‚Äì resourceful; a gentleman too.\\" The movie would give Sharp a reputation for action movies. He later stated his philosophy: > You can‚Äôt do big action sequences and then have flabby, everyday stuff round > it. Those movies have got to have a feeling of latent energy in there. . . . > You can‚Äôt do action sequences as an entity in themselves. They‚Äôve got to be > part of the way a whole movie is developing. You‚Äôve got to have, apart from > energy, a very good sense of editing, what a camera can do... a sense of > timing... and an ability to have a visual of exactly what it's going to look > like... Also, I enjoyed it.... some directors... didn‚Äôt get the same > enjoyment out of it; it was a necessity rather than a pleasure. I always > liked doing it, liked doing action . It was back to Hammer for Rasputin, the Mad Monk (1966), with Lee in the title role. Sharp disliked this experience working for Hammer as the budgets were being tightened.Koetting p 11-12 Sharp followed it with a spy spoof for Towers, Our Man in Marrakesh (1966), starring Tony Randall. For Towers he also made The Brides of Fu Manchu (1966), again with Lee. Sharp then made two films shot in Ireland: The Violent Enemy (1967), a thriller about the IRA from a novel by Jack Higgins, and Jules Verne's Rocket to the Moon (1967), an adventure tale in the vein of Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines for Towers. He returned to TV, directing some episodes of The Avengers (1968) and The Champions (1969), before writing and directing Taste of Excitement (1969), for the same producers as The Violent Enemy. Sharp was offered The Vengeance of She at Hammer but been unable to take the job.Koetting p 13 =Puppet on a Chain= Sharp said he was \\"out of work for about a year\\" when he got an offer to direct a boat chase sequence for Puppet on a Chain (1971), based on a novel by Alistair MacLean. The producers liked his work so much they hired him to shoot some additional footage. In 2007 Sharp said the film earned him a reputation as \\"The Doctor\\" and he was still getting royalties from the movie. Michael Carreras of Hammer asked Sharp to take over the Seth Holt who had died while directing Blood from the Mummy's Tomb (1971) but Sharp was unable as he had a contract to make a film for the producers of Puppet in Israel. That film was not made. According to Filmink \\"it‚Äôs a great shame Sharp only worked with\\" Hammer three times \\"because he was one of their best ever directors.\\" Sharp directed a pair of horror movies ‚Äì Dark Places (1973), with Lee, and Psychomania (1973), the final movie of George Sanders. The latter has become a cult classic. He called it \\"great fun to do, especially after doing several films in a row like The Violent Enemy. It was a great change, geared for a younger audience as it was.\\"Midnight p 18 Callan (1974) was a big screen adaptation of the TV series starring Edward Woodward (1967‚Äì72). It was followed by another thriller, Hennessy (1975), with Rod Steiger in the title role, as an IRA man out to assassinate Queen Elizabeth II. In 1975 Sharp worked on producer Harry Saltzman's abandoned pet project The Micronauts, a \\"shrunken man\\" epic to have starred Gregory Peck and Lee Remick. Carreras offered Sharp the job of directing To the Devil a Daughter for Hammer and he was interested but Sharp ultimately pulled out due to dissatisfaction with the script. Sharp directed the fourth version of The Four Feathers (1978), made for American TV but released theatrically in some markets. He then directed the remake of The Thirty Nine Steps (1978), with Robert Powell (who had been in Four Feathers). Producer Greg Smith said he hired Sharp \\"because he's one of Britain's best action adventure directors and he was familiar with the period.\\" He directed (and co-wrote) Bear Island (1979), an adventure tale from the novel by Alistair MacLean starring Richard Widmark, Donald Sutherland and Vanessa Redgrave. It was one of the most expensive Canadian films ever made and a box office flop. =Later career= Sharp returned to TV with episodes of Hammer House of Horror (1980) (\\"Guardian of the Abyss\\") and QED (1982) (TV series). He had a big ratings success with the mini series A Woman of Substance (1984), based on the novel by Barbara Taylor Bradford, with Jenny Seagrove and Deborah Kerr. After What Waits Below (1985) with Powell, he focused on television. Tusitala (1986) was an Australian mini series shot in Samoa. Hold the Dream (1986), was a mini-series sequel to Woman of Substance, with Jenny Seagrove reprising her role. Tears in the Rain (1988) was a TV movie from a novel by Pamela Wallace which gave an early starring role to Sharon Stone. Act of Will (1989) was another mini series based on a novel by Barbara Taylor Bradford, which starred Liz Hurley.

The Assumption of the Virgin Mary or Assumption of the Holy Virgin, is a painting by Peter Paul Rubens, completed in 1626 as an altarpiece for the high altar of the Cathedral of Our Lady, Antwerp, where it remains. In Rubens' depiction of the Assumption of Mary, a choir of angels lifts her in a spiraling motion toward a burst of divine light. Around her tomb are gathered the 12 apostles ‚Äî some with their arms raised in awe; others reaching to touch her discarded shroud. The women in the painting are thought to be Mary Magdalene and the Virgin Mary's two sisters. A kneeling woman holds a flower, referring to the lilies that miraculously filled the empty coffin. The Antwerp Cathedral of Our Lady opened a competition for an Assumption altar in 1611. Rubens submitted models to the clergy on February 16, 1611. In September 1626, 15 years later, he completed the piece. There is a smaller studio version, with some differences, in the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.

In 1866 he began to contribute to The Irish Times and other Dublin papers. He was the first journalist killed in the Kurdufan area during the Sudan campaigns while reporting for The Daily News. Early life Edmund O'Donovan was the son of John O'Donovan (1809‚Äì1861), a well-known Irish archaeologist and topographer. He was educated in medicine at Trinity College in Dublin. As teenagers, O'Donovan and most of his brothers joined the Irish Republican Brotherhood, a secret society banded together to achieve Irish freedom. He was arrested three times and detained for some months. He was subsequently an active IRB organiser in the north of England, while turning to journalism as a career. His sense of enjoyment and pranks was pronounced. He delighted in adventures and was a skilled linguist, as well as a weapons expert. O'Donovan remained on excellent terms with Irish revolutionaries to the last. Newspaper career He began his newspaper career with The Irish Times in 1866. After the Battle of Sedan, fought on 1 September 1870 during the Franco‚ÄìPrussian War, O'Donovan joined the Foreign Legion of the French army, and was wounded and taken prisoner by the Germans. In 1873, the Carlist rising attracted him to Spain, and he wrote many newspaper letters on the campaign. From 1876 O'Donovan represented the Daily News during the rising of Bosnia and Herzegovina against the Turks, and in 1879, for the same paper, made his adventurous and famously hazardous journey to Merv. On arrival at Merv, the Turcomans, suspecting him of espionage for the Russians, detained him. The British officer and spy, Lieutenant Colonel C.E. Stewart, who was posing as an Armenian horse trader, expressed surprise that the journalist should be so intrepid, but O'Donovan had told him he was determined to record General Skobelev's troop movements in southern Transcaspia when staying at Mahometabad for weeks. But O'Donovan resolutely decided on watching the Turcomans' stronghold of Geok Tepe, when the Russian advance began. He had negotiated for safe passage when he fell ill, fearing the worst from Persian obstruction. Astutely, O'Donovan refused to reveal Stewart's secret identity to the paper, but events were subsequently released in a book on The Merv Oasis as well as a report to the Royal Geographic Society. In 1881 he was released to greet the Turcomans at Geok Tepe, who were under the impression he was there to assist them. The Turcoman garrison was about 10,000 soldiers and 40,000 civilians. On the other side the Russian general could call on 7,000 men. The Turcomans fought fiercely to defend the fortress, while Skobelev used mortars to shell it. The Turcomans were overwhelmed when the Russians breached the walls with explosives and swarmed into the fortress. Bloody slaughter ensued, later justified by Skobelev as necessary to control the enemy. Stewart disappeared from Mahometabad, and reported to the British Mission in Tehran.Col. H.C. Stewart, \\"Through Persia in Disguise\\" O'Donovan had witnessed the whole grisly business from a vantage point out of harm's way high in the hills overlooking the city.Hopkirk, p.404-6, 442 Viceroy Lord Curzon later wrote > I do not think that any sight could have impressed me more profoundly with > the completeness of Russian conquest than the spectacle of these men, only > eight years ago the bitter and determined enemies of Russia... What O'Donovan had witnessed was the end of Turcoman independence. London was deeply concerned that the Russians would march on Merv, which was a natural gateway to Afghanistan and Herat. St. Petersburg, having dismissed General Skobelev, renounced all claim to Merv when the Tsar himself approached Lord Dufferin, the British ambassador. The consequence was to switch the city from Russian allied hands, Persia, to the Turcomans; the Cossacks continued to accompany the Turcomans to Merv for trade, where in the meantime, the story ran that O'Donovan had been installed by the local chieftains as The Supreme Ruler. When they discovered his newspapers were not bank notes, he fled for his life to Tehran, from what he described as \\"a city of hovels\\". It was only after several months' captivity that O'Donovan managed to get a message through to his principals in Persia, whence it was telegraphed to England. The adventures were described in The Merv Oasis published in 1882. The following year O'Donovan, still in search of adventure, accompanied the ill-fated expedition of Hicks Pasha to the Egyptian Sudan; he perished along with most of the Anglo-Egyptian expeditionary force at the Battle of El Obeid. Memorial O'Donovan is listed as one of seven journalists on a war memorial in St Paul's Cathedral in London for journalists who were killed during the Mahdist War between 1883 and 1885.

Other terms used to describe regression in children with autism are autism with regression, autistic regression, setback-type autism, and acquired autistic syndrome. There is no standard definition for regression, and the prevalence of regression varies depending on the definition used. Some children show a mixture of features, with some early delays and some later losses; and there is evidence of a continuous spectrum of behaviors, rather than, or in addition to, a black-and-white distinction, between autism with and without regression. Presentation Approximately 25‚Äì30% of children with autism spectrum disorders stop speaking after beginning to say words, often before the age of two. According to Ami Klin, \\"Most examples of autistic regression... are based upon a child's loss of a handful of words... it's possible that these children were only echoing sounds they heard from their parents\\"Hughes, V. (2008, May 16). SFARI. Retrieved August 6, 2008, from Simons Foundation: http://sfari.org/news/contradictory-results-on-regressive-autism-divide- researchers Some children lose social development instead of language; some lose both. After the regression, the child follows the standard pattern of autistic neurological development. The term regressive autism refers to the appearance that neurological development has reversed; it is actually only the affected developmental skills, rather than the neurology as a whole, that regresses. It is more usual for autistic neurological development not to include such aberrations, with age-appropriate autistic symptoms being clear from birth. Skill loss may be quite rapid, or may be slow and preceded by a lengthy period of no skill progression; the loss may be accompanied by reduced social play or increased irritability. The temporarily acquired skills typically amount to a few words of spoken language, and may include some rudimentary social perception. There are several intermediate types of development, which do not neatly fit into either the traditional early onset or the regressive categories, including mixtures of early deficits, failures to progress, subtle diminishments, and obvious losses. If regression is defined strictly to require loss of language, it is less common; if defined more broadly, to include cases where language is preserved but social interaction is diminished, it is more common. Cause Regression in autism spectrum disorders is well documented; attribution of regression to environmental stress factors may result in a delay in diagnosis. The apparent onset of regressive autism is surprising and distressing to parents, who often initially suspect severe hearing loss. A controversy occurred following a fraudulent study linking the MMR vaccine to autism, but since then, studies have shown no connection between autism and the MMR vaccine.https://www.nap.edu/read/13164/chapter/6#144 There are also studies being done to test if certain types of regressive autism have an autoimmune basis. Research There are some who believe that regressive autism is simply early-onset autism that was recognized at a later date. Researchers have conducted studies to determine whether regressive autism is a distinct subset of autism spectrum disorders. Over the years, the results of these studies have contradicted one another. Some researchers believe there is still nothing to support a definitive biological difference between early-onset and regressive autism. However, emerging research shows that males with regressive autism have brains that are six percent larger than anyone with early-onset autism. The brains of females with regressive autism show no difference in brain size. Other disorders involving regression Other disorders that involve regression include total blindness from birth, childhood disintegrative disorder, Rett syndrome, Landau-Kleffner syndrome, and childhood onset neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. Batten Disease). \\"Reversible\\" regression could anticipate non-pure Tourette syndrome.

Doinel is to a great extent an alter ego for Truffaut, sharing many of the same childhood experiences, looking somewhat alike and even being mistaken for one another on the street. Although Truffaut did not initially plan for Doinel to be a recurring character, he eventually returned to the character in one short-subject and three full-length films after introducing him in his debut feature, The 400 Blows (1959). In all, Truffaut followed the fictional life of Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre L√©aud) for over 20 years, shows him in romance with Christine (Claude Jade) in Stolen Kisses, then the marriage of Antoine and Christine (Bed and Board) and the divorce of the couple Antoine and Christine in Love on the Run. Recurring characters Fran√ßois Truffaut and Claude Jade while Avant-Premiere of their third Doinel- film Love on the run Doinel was played in all five movies by Jean-Pierre L√©aud. Doinel's lover and later wife, Christine Darbon, was acted by Claude Jade in three films Stolen Kisses, Bed and Board and Love on the Run. The director's love to Claude Jade shines through his alter-ego Doinel. His unrequited love interest Colette Tazzi (Marie-France Pisier) appears in the short film, in a brief uncredited cameo in Stolen Kisses and in the last film. Patrick Auffay appears as Antoine's friend Ren√© in the first two films. Fran√ßois Darbon appears as Colette's father in the second and as a military adjudant in the third film. Daniel Ceccaldi and Claire Duhamel as Christine's parents in Stolen Kisses and Domicile conjugal. A lover of Antoine's mother, M. Lucien, has been played by Jean Douchet in the first and by Julien Bertheau in the last movie. A writer friend of Antoine, played by Jacques Robiolles appears in Stolen Kisses and Bed and Board. The son of Antoine and Christine, Alphonse, is played in Bed and Board by four girls and in Love on the Run by Julien Dubois. In the 2005 radio play Alphonse's Journal (Le journal d'Alphonse) in which only Christine (Claude Jade) and Alphonse reappearing, Alphonse is spoken by Stanislas Merhar. Numerous other characters re-appear through flashbacks utilizing footage from earlier films in Love on the Run. The Adventures of Antoine Doinel The set of five films has been named \\"The Adventures of Antoine Doinel.\\" The set is made up of the following: =The 400 Blows= Truffaut's debut was the film The 400 Blows. The 1959 film introduces us to the 14-year-old Doinel, a troubled Parisian boy who skips school, eventually turning to street life and petty crime in response to neglect at home by his parents. Towards the end of the film, he is sent to a reform school, from which he escapes for places unknown. =Antoine and Colette= The next appearance of Doinel was in the film short Antoine and Colette, which was part of the 1962 omnibus film L'amour √† vingt ans. Doinel is now age 17 and becomes obsessed with Colette, a music student, but she only wants to be friends. =Stolen Kisses= In the third installment, Stolen Kisses (1968), a more mature Doinel attempts to return to civilian life after a dishonourable discharge from the military. His romantic forays are rocky with Christine (Claude Jade), and then his boss's wife (Delphine Seyrig as Fabienne Tabard). =Bed and Board= In 1970, Doinel and Christine have married in Bed and Board, but Doinel suddenly becomes obsessed with a young Japanese woman (Hiroko Berghauer). =Love on the Run= Doinel's adventures come to a close in 1979's Love on the Run, where his romantic attentions pass from his ex-wife Christine to disc-seller Sabine Barnerias (Doroth√©e). In Antoine and Colette and Love on the Run, flashbacks to Doinel's earlier life consist of footage from the previous films. Christine Darbon Christine Darbon, portrayed by actress Claude Jade, first appears in the life of Antoine in Stolen Kisses. Subsequently she appeared in two more films, Bed and Board (now Christine Doinel) and Love on the Run, where, after divorcing Doinel, she again becomes Christine Darbon. Truffaut uses the occasion to examine three states, three ages, of the woman: loved from a distance (Stolen Kisses), married and misled (Bed and Board), divorced but still on good terms (Love on the Run). Christine is characterized by her good behaviour, the promptness of her glance, a sense of sacrifice which is by no means \\"tragic\\". In the film Love on the Run, Antoine and Christine were the first couple in the country to divorce under a new law allowing dissolution of a marriage by mutual consent. In a case of life imitating art, Christine can be seen as part of Truffaut's autobiography. While Antoine is seeking to seduce Christine in Stolen Kisses, in real life Truffaut fell in love with the actress who portrayed Christine, Claude Jade, becoming engaged to her. The two however did not wed. The character of Christine Darbon left an important and indelible mark on Truffaut's work: She is a character who never really reveals her emotions, whose sad smile is her only weapon to fight Antoine's cruelty, and whose soft glance barely manages to hide an inner wound.

Life Huida a Egipto ca. 1712 - 1714. Antonio Palomino was born to a respectable family at Bujalance, near C√≥rdoba in 1655. He studied philosophy, theology and law at C√≥rdoba, and had lessons in painting from Juan de Vald√©s Leal, who visited there in 1672, and afterwards from Juan de Alfaro y Gamez in 1675. After taking minor orders Palomino moved to Madrid in 1678, where he associated with Alfaro, Claudio Coello, and Juan Carre√±o de Miranda, and executed some indifferent frescoes. He soon afterwards married a lady of rank, and, having been appointed alcalde of the mesta, was himself ennobled; in 1688 he was appointed painter to King Charles II. The artist visited Valencia in 1697, and remained there for three or four years, again devoting himself to fresco painting, including the ceilings of the church of the Santos Juanes. Between 1705 and 1715 he spent considerable amounts of time in Salamanca, Granada and C√≥rdoba; in the latter year the first volume of his work on art, El Museo pict√≥rico y escala √≥ptica, appeared in Madrid. He painted the ceiling fresco in the dome of the sacristy of the Cartuja de Granada. After the death of his wife in 1725 Palomino took priest's orders. He died on 13 August 1726. El Museo pict√≥rico y escala √≥ptica Palomino's El Museo pict√≥rico y escala √≥ptica first appeared in 1715‚Äì24 in a three-volume folio edition. The first two parts, on the theory and practice of the art of painting, have had little influence. The third, subtitled El Parnaso espa√±ol pintoresco laureado, contains a large amount of important biographical material relating to Spanish artists, which, despite its uneven style, has led to the author being called \\"the Spanish Vasari\\" . It was partially translated into English in 1739 as An account of the lives and works of the most eminent Spanish painters, sculptors and architects; an abridgment of the original (Las Vidas de los pintores y estatuarios espa√±oles) was published in London in 1742, and appeared in a French translation in 1749. A German version was published at Dresden in 1781, and a reprint of the entire work at Madrid in 1797. A modern English translation of the abridgment by Nina Ayala Mallory came out in 1987 from Cambridge University Press ().

It is about south of North Weald Airfield and north of Romford. The airfield is just within the M25, close to the junction with the M11. Stapleford Aerodrome has a CAA Ordinary Licence (Number P472) that allows flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction as authorised by the licensee (Herts & Essex Aero Club Limited).Civil Aviation Authority Aerodrome Ordinary Licences History =The 1930s= Stapleford opened as Essex Aerodrome in 1933 as a base for Hillman's Airways, which provided a service to Paris and other European cities using De Havilland DH.84 Dragon and DH.89 Dragon Rapide biplanes. Amy Johnson was one of the Hillman Airways pilots. After running into financial difficulties, Hillman was bought up by Whitehall Security Corporation Ltd and merged with three other airlines that they already owned to form British Airways Ltd. Operations began in 1936, but after 4 months all flights were moved to Heston Aerodrome, leaving just a small number of private aircraft. The RAF took an interest in the airfield in 1937, and in 1938 No 21 Elementary and Reserve Flying Training school was established at Stapleford. Training was provided by Reid and Sigrist Ltd, under contract to the Air Ministry. One of the most famous students was J.E. \\"Johnnie\\" Johnson who became the RAF's top scoring pilot and reached the rank of Air Vice Marshal. =Second World War= The airfield was requisitioned shortly after the start of the Second World War as RAF Stapleford Tawney. A long perimeter track and dispersal points were built and some accommodation buildings were erected. By the end of March 1940 the airfield was ready to become a satellite station for North Weald. The first squadron to make regular use of Stapleford was No. 151 Squadron, making patrols from the base from August 1940. Six aircraft were lost and two pilots, including squadron leader Eric King, killed in action on 30 August. After a short stay, the squadron was moved to RAF Digby, Lincolnshire, but one aircraft struck a crane after take off and burst into flames. The pilot, Pilot Officer Richard Ambrose, was killed; he is buried in Epping cemetery. No. 46 Squadron arrived in September, having lost all their Hurricane fighters when the aircraft carrier was sunk while evacuating the squadron from Norway. Other units to use Stapleford included the secret No. 419 Flight, formed in August 1940 as the operational air-arm of the Special Operations Executive (SOE). They were intended to use Armstrong Whitworth Whitleys to drop agents and supplies behind enemy lines. Westland Lysanders would be used to pick up agents as well as other important people. Because of heavy Luftwaffe attacks on North Weald, the flight moved to Stapleford on 4 September. The Whitley was a rather large aircraft to use Stapleford's grass runways. Only two operations were carried out from Stapleford; one to Brest and the other to Fontainebleau. The flight then moved to RAF Stradishall, Suffolk, on 9 October. Other squadrons at Stapleford were No. 242 Squadron and the RAF's oldest, No. 3 Squadron and, in 1941, a new Air Sea Rescue squadron was formed at Stapleford - No. 277 Squadron. In March 1943, Stapleford was taken out of Fighter Command and placed under the command of No. 34 Wing of the Army Co-operation Command. Stapleford played an important part in the preparations for D-Day and many units arrived. On 20 November 1944 a V-2 rocket landed in the middle of the airfield leaving a crater 60 feet in diameter. On 23 January 1945 another rocket landed on the airfield camp site killing 17 personnel and injuring 50. A number of the personnel are buried in the church cemetery at North Weald. Stapleford's wartime role ended in 1945, with the last personnel leaving before VE Day. A memorial at the airfield recalls those who lost their lives. =Post-war= In 1946, Stapleford Aerodrome was taken over by the Royal Engineers. 869 Mechanical Equipment Squadron RE was the only plant unit in the UK and held a large inventory of bulldozers, scrapers, road rollers, cranes, excavators, draglines and all the plant items that the army had acquired - most of it worn out. The newest of the equipment was used throughout the UK in clearing minefields (armoured bulldozers) and constructing shooting ranges etc. The unit name was changed to Number 1 Plant Park Squadron RE and moved to Bordon, Hampshire, in September 1948. In 1953 Roger Frogley and his brother Buster transferred the Herts and Essex Aero club from Broxbourne in Hertfordshire to Stapleford. The hangars were renovated and they began flying Tiger Moths and Austers. In 1955 Edgar Percival, the famous pre-war aircraft designer, set up a company at Stapleford under his name and started a production line for his EP9 crop-spraying aircraft. A total of 40 aircraft were built. Today The airfield is home to the privately owned Stapleford Flight Centre. For around 40 years it has trained pilots for PPL up to CPL and ATPL qualifications. It has a fleet of over 40 aircraft. Other companies on the site provide business charter services, London sightseeing flights and aircraft engineering services. The airfield has two parallel runways 03/21, one being partly asphalt at one end, and a shorter grass runway 10/28. Lambourne VOR is located at the south of the airfield. Accidents and incidents On 3 October 2015 a Beechcraft King Air 200 G-BYCP operated by London Executive Aviation crashed shortly after departure killing both pilots on board.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england- essex-34433340https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-37641599 References *http://www.iaopa.eu/mediaServlet/storage/gamag/feb08/GA_p34-p35.pdf  External links  *Detailed historical record about Stapleford Aerodrome * Stapleford Flight Centre Category:Airports in England Category:Transport in Epping Forest District Category:Airports in the London region Category:Airports established in 1933 Category:1933 establishments in England ","title":"Stapleford Aerodrome"},{"id":"2092709","text":"Saskia Rao-de Haas (born 1971) is a virtuoso cellist and composer from the Netherlands based in New Delhi, India.

They follow a set of 29 principles/commandments given by Guru Jambeshwar (1451-1536). They are not a caste but a sect. As of 2019, there are an estimated 960,000 followers of Vishnoi sect residing in north and central India.Akash Kapur, A Hindu Sect Devoted to the Environment, New York Times, 8 Oct 2010. Shree Guru Jambeshwar founded the sect at Samrathal Dhora in 1485 and his teachings, comprising 120 shabads, are known as Shabadwani. He preached for the next 51 years, travelling across India. The preaching of Guru Jambhoji inspires his followers as well as the environmental protectors. Background =Etymology= Guru Jambeshwar gave his followers 29 precepts, bis means 20 in the local dialect and noi means nine in the local dialect, which became the \\"Bis+Noi\\" name for the sect. In local dialect, it is often said, ‚Äú‚Äù which means those who will follow these twenty-nine principles by heart, Guru Jambhoji will bless them and they will be a Bishnoi (Vishnoi). =History= Bishnoi sect was founded by Shree Guru Jambeshwar (1451-1536), also known as Jambhoji. Some people have used the term Vishnoi, meaning followers of Vishan, the all mighty god, while some refer to themselves as Bishnoi. Shree Guru Jambeshwar himself did not refer to Bishnoi but does mention Vishan. Adherents are also known as Prahladapanthi because of their devotion to Prahlada, another Hindu deity. Shree Guru Jambeshwar announced a set of 29 tenets. These were contained in a document called Shabadwani, written in the Nagri script, which consists of 120 shabads. Of his 29 tenets, ten are directed towards personal hygiene and maintaining good basic health, seven for healthy social behaviour, and four tenets to the worship of God. Eight tenets have been prescribed to preserve bio-diversity - although most adherents are unaware of that, or such things as global warming, as a concept \\\\- and encourage good animal husbandry. These include a ban on killing animals and felling green trees, and providing protection to all life forms. The community is also directed to see that the firewood they use is devoid of small insects. Wearing blue clothes is prohibited because the dye for colouring them is obtained by cutting a large quantity of shrubs. 29 rules The 29 tenets of Bishnoism state: # Observe a 30-day state of ritual impurity after child's birth and keep mother and child away from household activities. # Observe 5-day segregation while a woman is in her menses. # Bathe daily in the morning before sunrise. # Obey the ideal rules of life: modesty, patience, or satisfactions, cleanliness. # Pray twice every day (morning and evening). # Eulogise God, Vishan, in the evening (Aarti) # Perform Yajna (Havan) with the feelings of welfare devotion and love. # Use filtered water, milk, and cleaned firewood. # Speak pure words in all sincerity. # Practice forgiveness from the heart. # Be merciful with sincerity. # Do not steal nor harbor any intention to do it. # Do not condemn or criticize. # Do not lie. # Do not indulge in dispute/debate. # Fast on Amavasya. # Worship and recite Lord Vishnu in adoration. # Be merciful to all living beings and love them. # Do not cut green trees, save the environment. # Crush lust, anger, greed, and attachment. # Cook your food by yourself. # Provide shelters for abandoned animals to avoid them from being slaughtered in abattoirs. # Do not sterilize bulls. # Do not use or trade opium. # Do not smoke or use tobacco or its products. # Do not take bhang or hemp. # Do not drink alcohol/liquor. # Do not eat meat, always remain purely vegetarian. # Do not use violet-blue color extracted from the indigo plant. Places of pilgrimage The Bishnoi have various temples, of which they consider the most holy to be that in the village of Mukam in Nokha tehsil, Bikaner district, Rajasthan. It is there where the Major Vishnoi Temple is. Khejarli massacre The Bishnoi narrate the story of Amrita Devi, a member of the sect who inspired as many as 363 other Bishnois to go to their deaths in protest of the cutting down of Khejri trees on 12 September 1730. The Maharaja of Jodhpur, Abhay Singh, requiring wood for the construction of a new palace, sent soldiers to cut trees in the village of Khejarli, which was called Jehnad at that time. Noticing their actions, Amrita Devi hugged a tree in an attempt to stop them. Her family then adopted the same strategy, as did other local people when the news spread. She told the soldiers that she considered their actions to be an insult to her faith and that she was prepared to die to save the trees. The soldiers did indeed kill her and others until Abhay Singh was informed of what was going on and intervened to stop the massacre. Some of the 363 Bishnois, who were killed protecting the trees, were buried in Khejarli, where a simple grave with four pillars was erected. Every year, in September, i.e., Shukla Dashmi of Bhadrapad (Hindi month) the Bishnois assemble there to commemorate the sacrifice made by their people to preserve their faith and religion.

His later career included many horror films and television shows. Early life and career Born in London where his father was a Billingsgate fish merchant, Baker was educated at a Lyc√©e in Rouen, France, and at the City of London School. From 1934 to 1939, he worked for Gainsborough Pictures, a British film production company based in the Islington district of London. His first jobs were menial, making tea for crew members, for example, but by 1938 he had risen to the level of assistant director on Alfred Hitchcock's The Lady Vanishes (1938). He served in the Army during the Second World War, transferring to the Army Kinematograph Unit in 1943 to make better use of his skills as a production manager and director on documentaries. One of his superiors at the time was novelist Eric Ambler, who insisted on Baker being given his first big break directing The October Man, from an Ambler screenplay, in 1947. Ambler also adapted Walter Lord's A Night to Remember for Baker's 1958 screen version. His next two films, The Weaker Sex (1948) and Paper Orchid (1949) were popular but overshadowed by the success of Morning Departure (1950), also featuring John Mills. Morning Departure drew international attention to Baker's talent and prompted Darryl Zanuck, production head of 20th Century Fox, to invite him to Hollywood, though his first film for the company - I'll Never Forget You - was made in the UK.Tom Vallance Obituary: Roy Ward Baker, The Independent, 14 October 2010 During the early 1950s, Baker worked for three years at Fox where he directed Marilyn Monroe in Don't Bother to Knock (1952) and Robert Ryan in the 3-D film noir Inferno (1953). He returned to the UK in 1953 and continued to work on films. He worked for television during the 1960s and early 1970s. He directed episodes of The Avengers, The Saint, The Persuaders!, The Champions, Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased) - all of them adventure series created with an eye on the American market. His experience of working with low budgets in television made him well suited to his next career move into cheaply produced but lavish- looking British horror films. He directed, among others, Quatermass and the Pit (1967) The Vampire Lovers (1970) and Scars of Dracula (1970) for Hammer, and Asylum (1972) and The Vault of Horror (1973) for Amicus. He also directed Bette Davis in the black comedy The Anniversary (1968), and co-directed (with renowned Hong Kong director Chang Cheh) the Hammer-Shaw Brothers Studio collaboration The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires. In the latter part of the 1970s he returned to television, and throughout the 1980s continued to work on shows such as Minder. He retired in 1992. Later years In 2000 Baker published his memoirs, Director's Cut: A Memoir of 60 Years in Film, and in 2002 sold his production files and letters at auction. He contributed interviews to several DVD extras, such as the extras included with The Saint and Randall & Hopkirk - Deceased and took part in the 2007 BBC 2 documentary series British Film Forever, and in Mark Gatiss's October 2010 BBC 4 series, A History of Horror, in which he gave his final recorded interview.

He became rector of Great Linford, BuckinghamshireBurke's Extinct and Dormant Baronetcies (2nd edition, London: John Russell Smith, 1844) in 1589. Napier was appointed a curate to preach in his place while he practised astrology, which was intertwined with his devout Anglicanism and interest in medicine. He claimed to speak with the archangel Raphael frequently, and occasionally with the archangel Michael. His clients included Emanuel Scrope, 1st Earl of Sunderland as well as the Earl of Bolingbroke and Lord Wentworth, who reputedly protected him from the actions of magistrates. His sister, Mary Napier married Sir Thomas Myddelton of Chirk Castle, the son of Sir Thomas Myddelton, Lord Mayor of London who was also one of his patients. It was said of him that he was so devout that his knees grew horny by much praying, and he reputedly died in that posture on 1 April 1634 and was buried on 15 April.

It is currently owned and operated by iHeartMedia. Its studios are located at The Rotunda shopping center in Baltimore, and the transmitter is based atop Television Hill in the city's Woodberry district. History =WITH-FM/DJ-104= 104.3 signed on in 1949 as WITH-FM, the FM sister to WITH-AM 1230 (now WRBS). WITH-FM was Maryland's pioneer FM station, with local legend Jack Wells serving as its first announcer. In the 1970s, WITH-FM became Top 40 WDJQ-FM \\"DJ-104\\". By the late 70s, DJ-104 made an attempt to do an all-Disco format, which failed in the ratings and the station went back to Top 40 at the end of 1979. =B-104= In June 1980, Scripps-Howard Broadcasting acquired WDJQ-FM, and at Noon on July 2, 104.3 became WBSB under the handle \\"B-104\\", but retaining the previous Top 40 format.https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1980s/1980/RR-1980-07-11.pdf B-104 was one of Baltimore's top-rated FM stations during the 80s and was home to \\"Brian and O'Brien\\" one of Baltimore's most notable morning drive time shows. Radio & TV personalities Glenn Beck and Pat Gray hosted a show on B-104 for several years in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Other notable air personalities were: Ken Merson (The Merson Person), Willie B., Gary Murphy, Sean Hall, Tom Gilligan, Kris Earl Phillips, Ann Duran, J.R. Russ, Lisa Kay, ‚ÄúDowntown‚Äù Billy Brown and Brian Carter. =Variety 104.3/Soft 104.3= In the early 1990s, Top 40 radio suffered a decline in audience and revenue due to the rise of alternative rock and hip hop. Many stations around the country flipped to other formats; WBSB was one of those. On February 18, 1992, at 9 a.m., after playing a montage of station memories, the station flipped to \\"Variety 104.3\\", a Hot AC competitor to WWMX, which was a mainstream AC at the time. The first song on \\"Variety\\" was \\"Listen to the Music\\" by The Doobie Brothers.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1992/RR-1992-02-21.pdfhttp://formatchange.com/chr- wbsb-b104-becomes-hot-ac-wvrt-variety-1043/ In January 1993, the station changed its call letters to WVRT. The station suffered from low ratings during this time. Ironically, Capitol Broadcasting, the owners of WWMX, bought the station from E. W. Scripps in the Fall of 1993. On December 13, the station began stunting with a simulcast of WWMX. At Midnight on December 20, the stunting switched to a one song per day loop, as well as liners redirecting listeners to WWMX. Finally, on January 12, 1994, at 6 p.m., the station flipped to \\"Soft 104.3\\" WSSF, a soft AC competing with well-established WLIF.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1994/RR-1994-01-21.pdf Capitol sold the station to American Radio Systems in 1994. =104.3 The Colt/104.3-OCT= After just 9 months of \\"Soft\\", on October 14, 1994, at 3 p.m., the station flipped to '70s-based classic hits as \\"104.3 The Colt\\", using the call letters WOCT. The first song on \\"The Colt\\" was Bachman‚ÄìTurner Overdrive's \\"You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet\\". The station later evolved into a classic rock format.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1994/RR-1994-10-21.pdf In 1998, American Radio Systems merged with CBS Radio/Infinity Broadcasting. The company was forced to sell 1 station due to being over the ownership limitations of 5 FM stations in a market. As a result, WOCT was sold to Jacor Communications, which would merge with the station's current owner iHeartMedia (then known as Clear Channel Communications) a year later. Following the sale, the station changed its format again, this time to a harder classic rock format as \\"104.3-OCT.\\" =Baltimore 104.3/B-104.3= In 2001, the station returned to mainstream classic rock as \\"Baltimore 104.3\\", and then a year later briefly brought back the heritage \\"B-104\\" name as WXFB (\\"B-104.3\\"). =Smooth Jazz 104.3/Channel 104.3= On September 5, 2003, at 10 a.m., the station flipped to Smooth Jazz as WSMJ.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/2000s/2003/RR-2003-09-12.pdf During WSMJ's (near) five-year run, it was nominated by the Radio & Records Industry for \\"Smooth Jazz Station of the Year\\" in 2005, as well as, one nomination and one win for \\"Program Director of the Year\\" in 2005 and 2007. On May 23, 2008, at 9 a.m., after playing Neither One of Us (Wants to Be the First to Say Goodbye) by Gladys Knight & the Pips, the station began stunting with Christmas music. At Noon the same day, the station launched into a 1990s-intensive modern rock format similar to other Clear Channel modern rockers in Grand Rapids, MI, Philadelphia, and Hartford, CT as Channel 104.3. The first song on \\"Channel\\" was No Way Back by The Foo Fighters. WSMJ Baltimore Flipping WSMJ Becomes Channel 104.3 On May 29, 2008, the station changed its call letters to WCHH. The WCHH call letters were last used in 2003 by an Urban Contemporary station in Charlotte, North Carolina. In January 2009, the transmitter was moved from northeast of the city to Television Hill near downtown, with hopes of improving signal coverage in the Howard and Anne Arundel County suburbs. =Z104.3= Z104.3 logo from November 4, 2009 to July 1, 2014 At 10 a.m. on November 4, 2009, after playing No Way Back by The Foo Fighters (which was also the first song played on \\"Channel\\"), the station briefly stunted again, this time with R&B; music as \\"Charm 104.3\\", before officially flipping to Top 40 at Noon as \\"Z104.3\\". The first song played on \\"Z\\" was 3 by Britney Spears.http://talk.baltimoresun.com/showthread.php?t=223614http://www.fmqb.com/article.asp?id=1574788https://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/1402/channel-104-3-baltimore- becomes-chr-z104-3/ The station changed calls to WZFT on November 20, 2009. The debut of \\"Z104.3\\" marked the first time that Baltimore had a Top 40 station since 2001, when WXYV flipped to mainstream urban, and also brought the CHR format back to 104.3 after a 17 year absence. Hot AC-formatted WWMX- FM, a former sister station now owned by Entercom, had been leaning towards a Mainstream Top 40 direction beginning the preceding year to try and fill that void. On July 1, 2014, WZFT updated its logo, mirroring a logo similar to sister station WHTZ in New York. HD Radio On June 26, 2019, WZFT-HD2 flipped to iHeart's \\"Pride Radio\\" format of Top 40/Dance music targeting the LGBTQ community.iHeartMedia Expands Pride Radio to 12 Additional Markets Previously, the HD2 subchannel carried hip-hop music as \\"The Beat\\", urban AC music from iHeart's \\"All My Jams\\" channel, and alternative rock as \\"Alt 104.3\\".

The clk-1 (clock-1) gene encodes this protein that is necessary for ubiquinone biosynthesis in the worm Caenorhabditis elegans and other eukaryotes. The mouse version of the gene is called mclk-1 and the human, fruit fly and yeast homolog COQ7 (coenzyme Q biosynthesis protein 7). CLK-1 is not to be confused with the unrelated human protein CLK1 which plays a role in RNA splicing.  Structure  The protein has two repeats of approximately 90 amino acids, that contain two conserved motifs predicted to be important for coordination of iron. The structure and function of the gene are highly conserved among different species. The C. elegans protein contains 187 amino acid residues (20 kilodaltons), the human homolog 217 amino acid residues (24 kilodaltons, gene consisting of six exons spanning 11 kb and located on chromosome 16). Mitochondrial function Ubiquinone is a small redox active lipid that is found in most cellular membranes where it acts as a cofactor in numerous cellular redox processes, including mitochondrial electron transport. As a cofactor, ubiquinone is often involved in processes that produce reactive oxygen species (ROS). In addition, ubiquinone is one of the main endogenous antioxidants of the cell. The CLK-1 enzyme is responsible for the hydroxylation of 5-demethoxyubiquinone to 5-hydroxyubiquinone. It has been shown that mutations in the gene are associated with increased lifespan. Defects of the gene slow down a variety of developmental and physiological processes, including the cell cycle, embryogenesis, post-embryonic growth, rhythmic behaviors and aging. Nuclear function CLK-1 and COQ7 predominantly localise to mitochondria to participate in the ubiquinone biosynthetic pathway which is found there. However, a small pool of CLK-1 and COQ7 translocates to the nucleus in response to the production of ROS by normally functioning mitochondria in both worms and human cells, respectively. Translocation of CLK-1 and COQ7 represents a mitochondrial to nuclear retrograde signalling pathway that acts to suppress mitochondrial stress responses. The mitochondrial and nuclear pools of CLK-1 are thought to contribute independently to worm lifespan regulation. The nuclear form of CLK-1 and COQ7 is thought to regulate gene expression through an unidentified mechanism.

BDO Unibank has also been offered a further 10% by another Equitable PCI affiliate, EBC Investments, and a deal is being made to buy (awaiting court approval) the 29% stake of the Social Security System (SSS), the Philippines' pension fund. Subsequent acquisitions enabled the bank to acquire a 34% stake in Equitable PCI. On December 1, 2005, BDO Unibank shares were listed as a component of the PSE Composite Index for the first time.

Bank of the Philippine Islands is the current third biggest bank in the Philippines with P592.6 billion (as of June 2007). BDO Unibank. has asked Equitable PCI to study their offer until January 31, 2006. BDO Unibank President Nestor Tan also expressed of a possibility of a three-way merger with Chinabank, also an SM Group- controlled bank.

Although Romualdez and the GSIS have shown stiff opposition to the BDO Unibank-Equitable PCI merger, the SSS is still studying the possibility of a merger. In fact, UBS studied the deal and claims that the merger through the stock swap option is a \\"win-win\\" situation. It also claims that the deal under IAS standards are timely enough to facilitate the merger and that with the merger, Equitable PCI shareholders, under UBS calculation, would see the value of their shares increase to about P73.60 per share, more than the fair value target price of 67 pesos.

Zwiebelfl√∂te) is a musical instrument of the woodwind family used during the 16th and 17th centuries. It produces music akin to a comb and paper, and is still manufactured as a toy. The eunuch flute's sound highly resembles a kazoo. The eunuch flute, unlike a kazoo, is held horizontally against the mouth while the user vocalizes into the aperture. The eunuch flute consists of a wooden tube widening out slightly to form a bell. The upper end of the tube is closed by means of a very fine membrane similar to an onion skin stretched across the aperture like the vellum of a drum. The mouthpiece, a simple round hole, is pierced a couple of inches below the membrane. Into this hole the performer sings, their voice setting up vibrations in the membrane (technically a mirliton), which thus intensifies the sound and changes its timbre to a bleating quality. A movable cap fits over the membrane to protect it. Marin Mersennus has given a drawing of the eunuch flute together with a description. cites L'Harmonie universelle (Paris, 1636), livre v. prop. iv. pp. 228-229. He states that the vibrations of the membrane improve the sound of the voice, and by reflecting it, give it an added charm. There were concerts of these flutes in four or five parts in France, adds Mersennus, and they had the advantage over other kinds of reproducing more nearly the sound of the voice. The Irish writer Samuel Beckett wrote a series of fifty-nine small poems in French called mirlitonnades after the instrument.

Early life Dalton was born in Chelmsford, Massachusetts. He studied under French physiologist Claude Bernard in France. Dalton had two understudies: John Green Curtis and William Stewart Halsted. Dalton and Curtis were associated with the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York. Dalton was a professor of physiology at the college; however, it is unclear whether his son was as well. Dalton received his undergraduate and medical degrees from Harvard University. Career The anatomy of the brain was primarily drawn by Europeans prior to Dalton's more detailed and precise sketches of the brain. Dalton received an award from the American Medical Association in 1851 for his essay \\"Corpus Luteum\\". He was a professor at the University at Buffalo for a brief time, but resigned in 1854. Dalton served as a professor or chairperson at the Vermont medical college and the Long Island College Hospital. John became the president of the College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1884. Dalton served as a surgeon in the national service during the American Civil War from 1861 to 1864. Prior to his resignation in 1864, Dalton was a prominent member in the medical corps of the national service. He served in the 7th New York Militia regiment in 1861. Dalton joined the national services as soon as the war commenced. He was primarily a surgeon during this time, and spent a lot of time treating the wounded. John was originally in the US Navy, with the rank of medical officer. However, he spent time as well in the army corps, where he served as the medical inspector in the 6th Army Corps. He was transferred to the Army of the Potomac where he was made chief medical inspector of the field-hospitals.

On this Purnima (full moon) during the three days of the month of Jyeshtha in the Hindu calendar (which falls in May-June in the Gregorian calendar) a married woman marks her love for her husband by tying a ceremonial thread around a banyan tree. The celebration is based on the legend of Savitri and Satyavan as narrated in the epic Mahabharata. History The legends dates back to a story in the age of Mahabharata. The childless king Asvapati and his consort Malavi wish to have a son. Finally, the God Savitr appears and tells him he will soon have a daughter. The king is overjoyed at the prospect of a child. She is born and named Savitri in honor of the god. Method of Vat Purnima Vrata in Skanda Purana, which is the 14th of Puranas. About Vat Savitri Puja She is so beautiful and pure, and intimidates all the men in her village that no man will ask for her hand in marriage. Her father tells her to find a husband on her own. She sets out on a pilgrimage for this purpose and finds Satyavan, the son of a blind king named Dyumatsena who lives in exile as a forest-dweller. Savitri returns to find her father speaking with Sage Narada who tells her she has made a bad choice: although perfect in every way, Satyavan is destined to die one year from that day. Savitri insists on going ahead and marries Satyavan. Three days before the foreseen death of Satyavan, Savitri takes a vow of fasting and vigil. Her father-in-law tells her she has taken on too harsh a regimen, but she replies that she has taken an oath to perform the regimen and Dyumatsena offers his support. The morning of Satyavan‚Äôs predicted death, he is splitting wood and suddenly becomes weak and lays his head in Savitri‚Äôs lap and dies. Savitri places his body under the shade of a Vat (Banyan) tree. Yama, the god of Death, comes to claim Satyavan's soul. Savitri follows him as he carries the soul away. She first asks for eyesight and restoration of the kingdom for her father-in-law, then a hundred children for her father, and then a hundred children for herself and Satyavan. The last wish creates a dilemma for Yama, as it would indirectly grant the life of Satyavan. However, impressed by Savitri's dedication and purity, he offers her one more chance to choose any boon, but this time omitting \\"except for the life of Satyavan\\". Savitri instantly asks for Satyavan to return to life. Yama grants life to Satyavan and blesses Savitri's life with eternal happiness. Satyavan awakens as though he has been in a deep sleep and returns to his parents along with his wife. Meanwhile, at their home, Dyumatsena regains his eyesight before Savitri and Satyavan return. Since Satyavan still does not know what happened, Savitri relays the story to her parents-in-law, husband, and the gathered ascetics. As they praise her, Dyumatsena‚Äôs ministers arrive with news of the death of his usurper. Joyfully, the king and his entourage return to his kingdom. Savitri Though the tree does not play a significant role of the story, it is worshiped in memory of the love in the legend. The festival is followed by married women only, and is prohibited for children and widows. Festival Vat Purnima in English means a full moon related to the banyan tree. It is a Hindu festival celebrated strictly in the Northern and Western Indian states Maharashtra, Goa, Gujarat . , The period of the festival is observed over three days, usually the 13th, 14th and 15th days in the month of Jestha (May‚ÄìJune). Women observe a fast and tie threads around a banyan tree and pray for the well-being of their husbands. =Fast and tradition= On the occasion of Vat Purnima, women keep a fast of three days for their husbands, as Savitri did. During the three days, pictures of a Vat (banyan) tree, Savitri, Satyavan, and Yama, are drawn with a paste of sandal and rice on the floor or a wall in the home. The golden engravings of the couple are placed in a tray of sand, and worshiped with mantras (chanting), and Vat leaves. Outdoors, the banyan tree is worshiped. A thread is wound around the trunk of the tree, and copper coins are offered. Strict adherence to the fast and tradition is believed to ensure the husband a long and prosperous life. During the fast, women greet each other with \\"‡§ú‡§®‡•ç‡§Æ ‡§∏‡§æ‡§µ‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§π‡•ã\\" (English: \\"Become a Savitri\\"). It is believed that until the next seven births their husband will live well. In his book, B. A. Gupte provides a Pauranic excerpt to suggest that the mythology behind the festival is symbolic of natural phenomena. He notes that it is the representation of the annual marriage of the earth and nature represented by Satyavan and Savitri. It is like the way the earth dies every year and is rejuvenated by the powers of nature. He points out that the Vat tree was likely chosen due to the mythological aspects connected to the tree that are known to Indians. In the present day, the festival is celebrated in the following way. Women dress in fine sarees and jewelry, and their day begins with the offering of any five fruits and a coconut. Each woman winds white thread around a banyan tree seven times as a reminder of their husbands. They fast for the whole day.

The short was released on January 18, 1958, and stars Speedy Gonzales. Summary While Speedy is playing ping-pong (by himself), a hungry hawk named Se√±or Vulturo swoops down and tries to eat the mice. Synopsis It's Cinco de Mayo, and the mice are celebrating with their own carnival similar to the human celebration with Speedy Gonzales playing ping-pong by himself as many mice look on while a couple of the mice chat about Speedy going steady with everybody's sister. However, the celebration is interrupted as Se√±or Vulturo sees the carnival and decides to have a supper of mouse burgers. When his shadow is seen zooming overhead, the mice panic and flee to safety. Speedy notices the commotion and goes to ask what's going on. As several mice point out Vulturo and fear their celebration is ruined, Speedy assures them he will fix Se√±or Vulturo, \\"but good.\\" However, one mouse points out Vulturo already going for his first victim, crying for help, and Speedy realizes that's his cue. Speedy is able to fly in and rescue the mouse, replacing him under his sombrero with a firecracker. When Vulturo discovers the switch, he's unable to avoid having the firecracker go off and burn his foot, forcing him to douse it in a nearby rain bucket while the mouse backs away praising Speedy with repeated thanks for saving his life as he retreats to cover. After Speedy assures the mouse it was nothing, he goes back to deal with Vulturo, spooking him into landing in the rain barrel, before asking if someone gave Vulturo the hot foot. Vulturo admits, then denies it happened, before suspecting Speedy of stealing his supper. When Speedy admits his crime, Vulturo asks him why before preparing to squash him for stealing his supper. However, Speedy dodges the slaps, even taunting Vulturo with some dancing and singing, before retreating back to his mouse hole while still singing as Vulturo gives pursuit, attempts to belly-slide to catch Speedy when he dives for him, then crashes headlong into Speedy's mouse hole, flattening his beak into a flat shape before Speedy wobbles it back into its normal appearance, then bugs out, leading to Vulturo giving pursuit once more. When Speedy notices he's being followed, he asks Vulturo if he's following him, but Vulturo feigns ignorance, saying he would not do a thing like that, leading to Speedy accelerating and putting some distance between him and Vulturo before arriving at a railroad crossing, where when Speedy sees a train coming, he tries to warn Vulturo, but Vulturo is unable to stop in time before being clobbered by the train. Speedy comes over to check on him, and uses his tail feathers to brush him off as he reprimands him about looking both ways before crossing the tracks. Once done, Speedy returns the tail feathers, and takes his leave. Before Vulturo can resume the chase after putting his tail feathers back on, he's hit again by a sidecar, sending him crashing back to the ground to sulk in silent annoyance. Speedy soon arrives at a rock outcropping outside town, and gets the feeling he's being watched. As it turns out, Vulturo is on another cliff with a large cannon, preparing to blast Speedy with it once he has Speedy lined up in the crosshairs, but once he does, and lights the fuse, Speedy catches on, zooms behind Vulturo, and spooks him into standing in front of the cannon so he gets blasted instead, blowing his beak off. As Vulturo snorts out an annoyed sigh, Speedy returns his beak to him. Vulturo is grateful, and Speedy suggests that since Vulturo can't and probably won't catch him, Speedy knows one, fat, juicy mouse that would be perfect for Vulturo and will show him where that mouse lives. With that, Speedy takes off, and Vulturo follows after him. Speedy leads him back into town, but upon reaching the mouse hole, Speedy dives in while Vulturo crashes into the wall. As his head begins to split open, he quickly grabs his sombrero to cover it, then asks Speedy where the mouse he was talking about is as he climbs back to his feet. Speedy however, says that Vulturo has the wrong mouse hole as there's no one in that hole except for chickens, complete with Speedy clucking like one to fool him. Vulturo is not convinced in the slightest, but plays along, saying he'll look somewhere else, but has a plan to lure Speedy out. Taking one of those toys with the ball attached to a string that a person tries to land in the cup to a nearby explosives shed, Vulturo drops a few light drops of volatile nitroglycerin into the cup so when the ball lands in it, the simple catch would set off the explosive. Once done, Vulturo carefully takes the toy back to Speedy's hole, plants it in front with a card, then knocks on the wall to get Speedy's attention before ducking around the corner to hide. Speedy comes out to see who's there, but soon notices Vulturo's leg and foot peeking out from around the corner, and realizes Vulturo is trying to lure him out into a trap. Not at all fooled, Speedy plays along as he goes to read the card, then decides to try the toy out, purposefully playing with it wrong to lure out Vulturo. It works. Annoyed by Speedy's stupidity, Vulturo emerges to show Speedy how it is done, but this allows Speedy to run up to the roof and catch the ball at the top of its swing, holding it taut. When Vulturo notices, he's instantly nervous at what could come next. When Speedy asks if he gives up, Vulturo refuses, and Speedy drops the ball, causing it to land in the cup and set off the nitroglycerin. When the smoke clears, Vulturo has had his feathers and sombrero blown off, and he finally throws up the white flag and surrenders. As a result, the carnival gets back underway, and Speedy is the presenter for a ball toss game where a mouse gets three balls for 1 peso to win the Swiss cheese prize. The target: the still-featherless Se√±or Vulturo, who admits that while the balls don't bother him, the darts do, revealing his backside being used as a dart board for another carnival game with the same deal: 3 darts for one peso, as three darts land bulls-eyes on the target, causing him to yelp in pain from each hit. Voices Mel Blanc provided the voice for both Speedy and Vulturo.

Overview The poem was written in 1886 and is considered to be one of Yeats's more notable early poems. The poem is based on Irish legend and concerns faeries beguiling a child to come away with them. Yeats had a great interest in Irish mythology about faeries resulting in his publication of Fairy and Folk Tales of the Irish Peasantry in 1888 and Fairy Folk Tales of Ireland in 1892. The poem reflects the early influence of Romantic literature and Pre-Raphaelite verse. :Where dips the rocky highland :Of Sleuth Wood in the lake, :There lies a leafy island :Where flapping herons wake :The drowsy water rats; :There we've hid our faery vats, :Full of berries :And of reddest stolen cherries. :Come away, O human child! :To the waters and the wild :With a faery, hand in hand. :For the world's more full of weeping than you can understand. :Where the wave of moonlight glosses :The dim grey sands with light, :Far off by furthest Rosses :We footed all the night, :Weaving olden dances :Mingling hands and mingling glances :Till the moon has taken flight; :To and fro we leap :And chase the frothy bubbles, :While the world is full of troubles :And is anxious in its sleep. :Come away, O human child! :To the waters and the wild :With a faery, hand in hand, :For the world's more full of weeping than you can understand. :Where the wandering water gushes :From the hills above Glen-Car, :In pools among the rushes :That scarce could bathe a star, :We seek for slumbering trout :And whispering in their ears :Give them unquiet dreams; :Leaning softly out :From ferns that drop their tears :Over the young streams. :Come away, O human child! :To the waters and the wild :With a faery, hand in hand, :For the world's more full of weeping than you can understand. :Away with us he's going, :The solemn-eyed: :He'll hear no more the lowing :Of the calves on the warm hillside :Or the kettle on the hob :Sing peace into his breast, :Or see the brown mice bob :Round and round the oatmeal chest. :For he comes, the human child, :To the waters and the wild :With a faery, hand in hand, :For the world‚Äôs more full of weeping than he can understand. Publication history The poem was first published in the Irish Monthly in December 1886. The poem was then published in a compilation of work by several Irish poets Poems and Ballads of Young Ireland in 1888 with several critics praising the poem. It was later published in his first book of poetry The Wanderings of Oisin and Other Poems as well as Fairy and Folk Tales of the Irish Peasantry. In modern culture The poem was first set to music as his Op.38 by the English composer Cyril Rootham, originally for SATB voices and piano (1911) and then for SATB chorus and small orchestra (1912). The poem was also set to music and recorded by Loreena McKennitt on her 1985 debut album Elemental and again on Nights from the Alhambra (2006). Subsequently, additional musical versions were recorded by the folk rock group The Waterboys, appearing on their 1988 album Fisherman's Blues, with portions of the poem spoken by Tomas Mac Eoin; Heather Alexander on her 1994 album Wanderlust; and Hamilton Camp on his 2005 album Sweet Joy in the song \\"Celts\\". Another version, set to music and recorded on the Danny Ellis album 800 Voices, was released in 2006. In 2012, Merrymouth, a folk band led by Simon Fowler of Ocean Colour Scene recorded the poem set to a melody written by Fowler and music by Merrymouth (Fowler, Sealey, McNamara) for their debut album Simon Fowler's Merrymouth. The renowned American composer Eric Whitacre has also set this poem in a piece for The King's Singers and the National Youth Choir of Great Britain. British composer and guitar virtuoso Steve Hackett recorded a version of Yeats' poem under the title \\"Waters of the Wild\\" on his 2006 album Wild Orchids. Keith Donohue's novel The Stolen Child (Nan A. Talese, 2006) was inspired by the poem. The refrain is prominently featured in Steven Spielberg's film A.I. Artificial Intelligence. The poem is also featured in the television series Torchwood episode \\"Small Worlds\\", being spoken by a fairy who steals a young girl. The novel Dies the Fire also incorporates the poem into elements of Wiccan rituals. An Irish dance show called The Prophecy is based upon the poem. It is performed by Scottish-based company Siamsoir Irish Dancers and has won an award for the Best Dance and Theatre act at the world's largest Robert Burns festival, The Big Burns Supper in Dumfries. The refrain is featured in the 2014 movie Song of the Sea, which is based largely on Celtic mythology. The novella \\"The World More Full of Weeping\\" by Robert Wiersema references this poem. The novel \\"Shutter Man\\" by Richard Montanari references the last stanza of the poem. On the television show The Finder, the line \\"Come away, O human child\\" is seen inscribed on Eloise Jade Knox's headstone in episode 10, The Conversation. American hard rock band The Sword, in the liner notes from their debut album Age of Winters, quotes the refrain of the poem, among artwork of trees and faeries.

It runs from Illinois Route 116 in Pontiac north to U.S. Route 14 south of Harvard. This is a distance of . Illinois 23 was established in 1918 as one of the original 46 SBI routes. The routing of Illinois 23 has not changed since its establishment. Route description Illinois 23 is a major arterial route in rural central and north-central Illinois. It is a parallel to the Interstate 39/U.S. Route 51 combination approximately 20 miles (32 km) to the west. The road starts near downtown Pontiac and runs as the main highway north, intersecting with Interstate 55 and former U.S. Route 66. From this point, Illinois 23 continues as a 2-lane highway, turning west and running through Cornell. After that, it turns back north to travel through the middle of Streator, where the route splits to follow two different one-way streets (Park Street and Bloomington Street). Route 23 continues through Grand Ridge to Ottawa, where the road follows 1st Ave and State street, to form a concurrent with Illinois Route 71‚ÄîIllinois 71 across the Illinois River. The highway once again splits into two one-way streets (Columbus and LaSalle Streets) through downtown Ottawa, until a block south of its junction with U.S. Route 6, where Illinois 71 departs toward the east. North of Ottawa, Illinois 23 has a full diamond interchange with Interstate 80. Illinois 23 has two additional concurrencies with U.S. Route 34 and U.S. Route 52, though no notable cities are present between Ottawa and DeKalb. Illinois 23 runs under Interstate 88 with no interchange, though access is available via Fairview Drive to two parallel roads with interchanges (Peace Road and Annie Glidden Road). Between DeKalb and Sycamore, Illinois 23 has four lanes. In Sycamore, Illinois 23 briefly overlaps Illinois Route 64. After one final concurrency at Illinois Route 72 near Genoa, Illinois 23 has an interchange with Interstate 90. It runs through Marengo and terminates south of Harvard at U.S. Route 14. Major intersections Notes * In downtown DeKalb, Route 23 (the main north-south street) intersects as 4th Street with Illinois Route 38 (the main east-west street) at a railroad crossing, as two Union Pacific tracks pass through the crossing.

There are four different types of fields that have a distinct impact on the actuation in the work-energy picture of actuation. The field lines that connect the vertical sides of the fingers (blue) and those that connect the top sides of the fingers (red) are associated with the component of the force that tends to align the fingers. Those that connect the top sides of one finger with the vertical sides or the distant top sides of the other (green), tend to disengage the fingers. The field lines that connect the tips of the finger with the sides of its neighbors (brown) do not contribute to the actuation force. Comb-drives are microelectromechanical actuators, often used as linear actuators, which utilize electrostatic forces that act between two electrically conductive combs. Comb drive actuators typically operate at the micro- or nanometer scale and are generally manufactured by bulk micromachining or surface micromachining a silicon wafer substrate. The attractive electrostatic forces are created when a voltage is applied between the static and moving combs causing them to be drawn together. The force developed by the actuator is proportional to the change in capacitance between the two combs, increasing with driving voltage, the number of comb teeth, and the gap between the teeth. The combs are arranged so that they never touch (because then there would be no voltage difference). Typically the teeth are arranged so that they can slide past one another until each tooth occupies the slot in the opposite comb. Restoring springs, levers, and crankshafts can be added if the motor's linear operation is to be converted to rotation or other motions. The force can be derived by first starting with the energy stored in a capacitor and then differentiating in the direction of the force. The energy in a capacitor is given by: E = \\\\frac{1}{2} C V^2 F = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\frac{\\\\partial C}{\\\\partial dx_{drive}} V^2 Using the capacitance for a parallel plate capacitor, the force is: F = \\\\frac{-1}{2}\\\\frac{nt\\\\epsilon_o\\\\epsilon_rV^2}{d} V = applied electric potential, \\\\epsilon_r = relative permittivity of dielectric, \\\\epsilon_o = permittivity of free space (8.85 pF/m), n = total number of fingers on both sides of electrodes, t = thickness in the out of plane direction of the electrodes, d = gap between electrodes.

Founded in 1962, NAIS represents independent schools and associations in the United States, including day, boarding, and day/boarding schools; elementary and secondary schools; boys', girls', and coeducational schools. NAIS has affiliate members internationally as well. NAIS's mission is to be the national voice of independent schools and the center for collective action on their behalf. Membership As of the 2010-11 school year, NAIS represented approximately 1,400 member independent schools and associations in the US, serving more than 562,000 students and 121,000 teachers, administrators, and other staff. Membership in NAIS is open to independent pre-college schools that are operated by nonprofit organizations. To become a full member of NAIS, a school must have operated for at least five years and must be accredited by an accrediting organization approved by NAIS.Membership, NAIS website, accessed October 6, 2010  Criteria for accreditation  Over the course of a 10-year cycle, associations prepare a self-study demonstrating compliance with the Criteria for Effective Independent School Accreditation Practices. The criteria provide common ground for member associations by delineating best practices, policies, and procedures. In addition, associations use the Model Core Standards‚Äîa set of ‚Äúideal‚Äù standards‚Äîin assessing their own standards. As part of the process of ‚Äúaccrediting the accreditors,‚Äù each member association: * Hosts a visit from a team composed of commission members; * Receives written recommendations from the commission; and * Engages in followup activities designed to improve the state or regional accreditation process. Accountability serves two purposes: ongoing association improvement and advancement, and the assurance of excellence in the accreditation process for member associations and their independent schools. Background =History= The NAIS was organized in 1962, the result of the merger of the Independent Schools Education Board and the National Council of Independent Schools. In response to requests from several state, regional, and national accrediting organizations, the NAIS commission on accreditation was established by the NAIS Board of Trustees in 2001 and convened for the first time in 2002. The 19 member commission's work was intended to assure the quality of independent school accrediting programs. A primary responsibility of the commission was to developing a public understanding of, and credibility for, state and regional accrediting programs. In addition, the commission, * developed criteria for effective independent school accreditation practices, exemplary standards, and models of successful accreditation policies and procedures. * engaged in research to inform accreditation practice. The commission met on a regular basis and was guided by established operating protocols. It was composed of members from state and regional accrediting associations that were members of NAIS as well as at-large members, and NAIS Board members. After several years of planning to create a new, international organization, the NAIS commission on accreditation disbanded in 2018. The successor organization, the International Council Advancing Independent School Accreditation (ICAISA), began formal operations in 2018 as an independent 501(c)(3) organization. = Organizational Structure = The NAIS board of trustees is made up of an eighteen members, led by the officers and the Executive Committee. Board members serve three-year terms. The board appoints the NAIS president, who oversees association business with the aid of a small staff. The member associations of NAIS are accountable to one another through a process patterned on the independent school accreditation model. Over the course of a 10-year cycle, associations prepared a self-study demonstrating compliance with the Criteria for Effective Independent School Accreditation Practices. The criteria provided common ground for member associations by delineating best practices, policies, and procedures. In addition, associations used Model Core Standards ‚Äî a set of ‚Äúideal‚Äù standards ‚Äî in assessing their own standards.

Sir Thomas Middleton Chirk Castle Origins He was the son of Sir Thomas Myddelton, Lord Mayor of London, by his first wife, Hester Saltonstall, daughter of Sir Richard Saltonstall, Lord Mayor of London. Career He matriculated at Queen's College, Oxford, on 22 February 1605, and became a student at Gray's Inn in 1607. He was knighted on 10 February 1617, and was Member of Parliament for Weymouth and Melcombe Regis, 1624‚Äì25, and for the County of Denbigh in 1625 and 1640‚Äì1648. First Civil War During the Civil War he became prominent as Sergeant Major General of the Parliamentary forces in North Wales. In the summer of 1642 he was sent to his constituency to exercise his influence on behalf of the Parliament, and accordingly, in December 1642, he addressed to his countrymen a letter with strong advice to submit to and assist Parliament. By the king's order, Colonel Robert Ellice of Gwasnewydd, near Wrexham, seized Myddelton's residence, Chirk Castle, in his absence in January 1643. A garrison was placed there under Sir John Watts. By a parliamentary ordinance, dated 11 June 1643, Myddelton, who had by that time returned to London, was appointed Sergeant-Major-General for North Wales. On 10 August he reached Nantwich in Cheshire, where he was joined by Sir William Brereton, 1st Baronet. They proceeded on 4 September to Market Drayton, and on 11 September to Wem, which they seized, garrisoned, and made their Shropshire headquarters. While they were still engaged in fortifying Wem, Arthur Capell, 1st Baron Capell of Hadham, with reinforcements from Staffordshire, marched on Nantwich, but was defeated outside Wem in two separate conflicts, on 17 and 18 October. After this victory Brereton and Myddelton left Nantwich on 7 November, were joined at Stretton by Sir George Booth with troops from Lancashire, and crossing the River Dee at Holt, entered North Wales, where Wrexham, Hawarden, Flint, Mostyn, Mold, and Holywell were taken. But all these place were given up quickly after the landing at Mostyn on 18 November of about 2,500 royalist soldiers from Ireland, and the leaders were criticised. Myddelton's troops were militiamen, while his opponents were trained soldiers. In February 1644 Myddelton's command in North Wales was confirmed by a fresh commission. He left London about the end of May 1644, and marched to Nantwich, and thence to Knutsford, where a muster of all the Cheshire forces was intended, against Prince Rupert and Lancashire. But about 4,000 royalists laid siege to Oswestry. Myddelton hurried there before the arrival of his colleagues, and raised the siege on 2 July. Returning to Nantwich, Myddelton for some time watched Prince Rupert's movements, making occasional raids into Montgomeryshire. On 4 September he captured the garrison at Newtown, and the same day advanced to Montgomery, and without any resistance Montgomery Castle was surrendered to him by its owner, Edward Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Cherbury. Sir Michael Ernely, who was in command of the royalist forces at Shrewsbury, marched upon Montgomery to recover it. Myddelton sallied out to collect provisions but Ernely intercepted his return, and defeated him outside the town. Myddelton's foot-soldiers, under Colonel Thomas Mytton, succeeded in re-entering the castle, which Ernely at once besieged; but Myddelton retired to Oswestry, and after obtaining reinforcements from Lancashire returned, accompanied by Brereton and Sir William Fairfax. They arrived on 17 September in sight of Montgomery, where the whole strength of both parties in North Wales and the borders was now assembled. After a desperate conflict, in which Fairfax was mortally wounded, the parliamentarians completely routed their opponents. Myddelton was left for a time in command at Montgomery, but after the capture of Powis Castle on 3 October the county generally declared for Parliament, and Myddelton was therefore able to turn to Shrewsbury, where he captured most of the outposts, and blocked the passages to the town. On 2 November 1644, Myddleton marched with his troops on Machynlleth. As they passed Mathafarn, they were ambushed by a Royalist force led by Rowland Pugh. Pugh was defeated and in retaliation, Myddleton burned Mathafarn to the ground on 29 November 1644. Myddelton appeared on 21 December 1644 before his own residence of Chirk Castle, still held by Sir John Watts, who after a three days' siege was able to write on Christmas Day to Prince Rupert that he had beaten Myddelton off. Interregnum period By the self-denying ordinance Myddelton was superseded and the command was transferred to his second wife's brother-in-law, Colonel Thomas Mytton. When, however, there was a general reaction in the county in favour of the king in 1648, Myddelton was one of the persons to whom the principal inhabitants of Flintshire and Denbighshire, in their fidelity to parliament, entrusted the management of their county affairs. However, he disapproved of the king's trial, and was excluded from Parliament in 1649. On 14 May 1651 Myddelton was ordered by the council of state to enter into a bond of ¬£10,000 for his general good behaviour, and having received the security it was further ordered on 16 May that the garrison should be withdrawn from his house. In 1659 he joined the Cheshire Rising led by George Booth, and proclaimed Charles II as king in Wrexham market place. As a result, General John Lambert besieged Chirk Castle, after defeating Booth. He compelled Myddelton to surrender on 24 August 1659. Myddelton and his brothers were given notice to quit the country. After the Restoration At the Restoration of the Monarchy Sir Thomas is said to have received ¬£60,000 in compensation and his son was made a baronet as Sir Thomas Myddelton, 1st Baronet of Chirk Castle. Marriages and progeny He married twice: *Firstly to Margaret Savile, daughter and heiress of George Savile of Wakefield in Yorkshire, without progeny. *Secondly to Mary Napier, a daughter of Sir Robert Napier, 1st Baronet (1560-1637), of Luton Hoo, Bedfordshire, by whom he had seven sons and six daughters, including: **Sir Thomas Myddelton, 1st Baronet (1624‚Äì1663), eldest son and heir, created a baronet in 1660. He was besieged by Lambert in Chirk Castle in August 1659, and left two sons, Sir Thomas Myddelton, 2nd Baronet (c. 1651‚Äì1684) MP for Denbigh, and Sir Richard Myddelton, 3rd Baronet (1655‚Äì1716), MP for Denbigh 1685‚Äì1716, both of whom succeeded in turn to the baronetcy. Sir Richard's son, Sir William Myddelton, 4th Baronet (1694‚Äì1718) died unmarried in 1718, when the baronetcy became extinct and the estates reverted to Robert Myddelton of Llysvassi, a son of the parliamentary general's third son Richard, from whom Robert Myddelton- Biddulph, later owner of Chirk Castle, traced descent. **Ann Myddelton, wife of Edward Herbert, 3rd Baron Herbert of Chirbury.

(previously Ferrovie dello Stato), () is a state-owned holding company that manages infrastructure and services on the Italian rail network. One of the subsidiaries of the company, Trenitalia, is the main rail operator in Italy, and another, TrainOSE, is a rail operator in Greece. History =Early years= Ferrovie dello Stato (State Railways) was instituted by an act on 22 April 1905, taking control over the majority of the national railways, which up until that time were privately owned and managed. The president was nominated by the government. The first Director General was Riccardo Bianchi. With the rise of Fascism, a centralization policy was carried out. The board of directors and chief administrator office were abolished at the end of 1922. The institution was administered by a commissioner, appointed by the King until April 1924. Since then, Ferrovie dello Stato was managed by the newly born Ministry of Communications (including rail transport), under Costanzo Ciano. After the armistice on 8 September 1943, Italy was divided and train operations were separately directed too, with headquarters in Salerno for the south and Verona for the north. At the end of 1944, the Ministry of Communications was split and the new Ministry of Transport was created, including the general management of Ferrovie dello Stato, and in 1945, the company was renamed Azienda Autonoma delle Ferrovie dello Stato. =From World War II to 1985= The period after World War II was particularly tough for Ferrovie dello Stato, since most of the Italian rail network was severely damaged and the rolling stock was obsolete. The network was rebuilt almost entirely by 1952. Since then, a period of renewal started. New trains were introduced, among them the ETR 300, and many sections of the national network were electrified and sometimes doubled. In 1957, the new ALn 442/448 multiple unit was introduced, greatly reducing travel time on the Italian network. During these years, the rolling stock was generally renewed and expanded with the mass construction of electrical and diesel multiple units, like the Ale 883, ALe 840 and ALn 772. The FS ALn 668 diesel multiple unit was introduced in 1956. In the following years, 3 MU out of 4 were 668, which replaced many older units. Many electrical multiple units were also introduced during this period, like the ALe 601, progenitor of the Ale 801/940 and ALe 803 EMU, still in use today on regional service.See \\"L'elettrificazione delle FS\\" (1961), published by the Ferrovie dello Stato. During the 1970s, electronic cars were first introduced on the Italian network, starting with the G.A.I. trains for regional and metropolitan service. The new E.444 was the first attempt on high-speed rail, with a top speed of . The ETR 401 (1976) was the first prototype of the new Pendolino class. Following other network improvements, works for the first Italian high-speed rail line started in these years. The Direttissima line from Florence to Rome was partially opened in 1986 and concluded in 1992. In 1986, trains were travelling the line at , surpassing for the first time the previous maximum limit of 180 km/h on the Italian network. In 1988, the ETR 450 Pendolino was travelling regularly at , today's top speed on the line. The line was the fastest in Europe after the French TGV lines. The old logo was renewed in 1982 and again in 1994, with the introduction of the XMPRLivrea XMPR in Italian wikipedia livery. The FS was left unchanged in its administrative structure until the end of 1985. From the following year, after 80 years, the Azienda Autonoma delle Ferrovie dello Stato was replaced by a new company, Ferrovie dello Stato. =1986‚ÄìPresent= Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane Frecciarossa high speed train. The newly born Ferrovie dello Stato underwent major structural transformations between 1986 and 1992. The workforce was reduced to half: from 216,310 employees in 1988 to 112,018 in 1999. Divisions were created to rationalize the management. The company was privatized in 1992 with the creation of the new Ferrovie dello Stato SpA, a joint-stock company, following a European guideline. However, the privatization was only nominal, since shares were still owned by the Italian Government. On 1 June 2000, the company's two main divisions, service and infrastructure, were separated and two different independent companies were created: Trenitalia, responsible for transport service, and Rete Ferroviaria Italiana, responsible for the management of the rail infrastructure. Both companies were still subsidiaries of Ferrovie dello Stato Holding SpA. In 2011 Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane bought the German Netinera. In July 2016 Busitalia (part of Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane) purchased the Dutch company Qbuzz. In February 2017 Trenitalia bought from National Express the British Train operating company c2c. In September 2017, an agreement to buy 100% of TrainOSE (the Greek railways) for ‚Ç¨45 million was signed. Company structure =Subsidiaries= Trenitalia Trenitalia is the most important subsidiary of the company, as it manages all the trains of the company group. Trenitalia is the primary train operator in Italy. It was established in 2000 following a European Union directive on the deregulation of rail transport. TrainOSE and others Other company subsidiaries include TrainOSE, the sole operator for passenger and freight services in Greece, which is under the company's management since 2017, Busitalia, Centostazioni, Fercredit, Ferservizi, FS Logistica, FS Sistemi Urbani, Grandi Stazioni, Italferr, Netinera, Rete Ferroviaria Italiana, which manages the infrastructure of the Italian rail network, and Mercitalia, the group's freight operations subsidiary, founded in 2017 =Ferry service= Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane owns and operates a ferry service for rail trains connecting the mainland to Sicily, crossing the Strait of Messina. They carry InterCity, InterCityNotte and goods wagon by means of ferry boats. Until 2009 there was another ferry service for freight transport, which was activated in 1961 to connect the continent to the Sardinia, between Civitavecchia and Golfo Aranci. Since 2010, after the regular service has been suspended, there is an on-call service for Messina Marittima and Villa San Giovanni Mare railway stationVilla San Giovanni Mare. =Former CEOs= The former company CEOs were: Lorenzo Necci (1989‚Äì1996), Giancarlo Cimoli (1996‚Äì2004), Elio Catania (2004‚Äì2006), Mauro Moretti (2006‚Äì2014), Michele Mario Elia (2014‚Äì2015), and Renato Mazzoncini (2015‚Äì2017).

It is typically accompanied with prayers seeking health and happiness for their loved ones. Etymology Vrata (Sanskrit: ‡§µ‡•ç‡§∞‡§§) means \\"vow, resolve, devotion\\",Monier Monier-Williams (1899), Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Oxford University Press, page 1042, Article on Vrata and refers to the practice of austerity, particularly in matters related to foods and drinks by people in Hindu and Jaina culture, as part of a pious observance or prayers seeking health, fertility, long life or happiness for her loved ones. Derived from the root ‚Äòvr‚Äô (\\"will, rule, restrain, conduct, choose, select\\"), the word is found over 200 times in the Rigveda. It is also found in other Vedic literature including the Upanishads, but the context suggests that the meaning of the word in the Vedic era was not as a personal pious observance, and instead was related to ·πõta and dharma, in the sense of inner principles and universal laws that keep order in the cosmos. Every man's vocation, as in hymn 9.112.1 of the Rigveda, is called his Vrata. Thus, whatever profession one is devoted to, resolves to do his best in, is deemed Vrata in the Vedic literature. The act of sacrifice, in another context such as in hymn 1.93.8 of the Rigveda, is also called a Vrata. The post-Vedic texts use the term as a form of self-imposed restrictions on food and behavior, sometimes with a vow. The concept evolves as a form of religious votive rite, personalized and interiorized, one that does not need a public ceremony or a private one, but that is privately observed. Its meaning retains a sense of personal sacrifice (fast, or restricted diet), in exchange for hope, accompanied with a prayer to a personally defined or cherished divinity, and propelled by the wish for the well being of one's loved ones. The Grihya- sutras (domestic life manuals), the Puranas and the epics describe the practice particularly in the context of Vedic students, brahmins, and women, as \\"devotion, solemn vow, holy practice, resolve, dedication\\".  Hinduism  Vrata is a religious votive rite, a vow often involving abstinence from food, particularly common with women. It may be accompanied with elaborate prayers, other rites such as charity or visit to a temple, sometimes observed during festivals or with sanskara (rite of passage) ceremonies. It is found in ancient Hindu texts such as the Vedas, but in a fluid context that is not in the sense of pious observances. The Hindu Upanishads conceptualize Vrata as an ethical and behavioral discipline process, one where food is respected, the needy helped, the stranger welcomed, the student carries on the pursuit of knowledge. The Puranas link the practice to the empowering concept of Shakti of a woman, while the Dharmasastras link the practice to one possible form of penance through the concept of PrƒÅya≈õcitta for both men and women. A vrata is a personal practice, typically involves no priest, but may involve personal prayer, chanting, reading of spiritual texts, social get together of friends and family, or silent meditation. =Reasons= A Vrata may be motivated by many factors and is observed by both genders, but far more often by women. The most common are temporal wishes, such as the speedy recovery of a sick child, success or happiness for a loved one, fertility, ward off negativity or dangers, make prayers and good wishes for someone departing for a distant place. In the case of women, the prayers are usually on behalf of brother(s), children or husband, but sometimes for her own prosperity, mind-body balance and health. Sociologists who have interviewed women who observe Vrata report that the practice is explained, according to Anne Pearson, as something that gives \\"peace of mind\\", that she has made an effort to the best of her abilities and out of duty towards those important to her in her life, she has a sense of contentment in her heart and intellect, and thus she feels she has achieved something. It is also an expression of care and love, a reminder of ethical principles of the Hindu traditions. A Vrata is sometimes a result of voluntary vow or part of practice by a brahmacharya (student) or grihastha (householders) that they feel as obligatory before or during certain spiritual or religious practice. Utsavas, or religious festivals, share some elements with vratas, incorporating the practice of restraining food and similar austerity, as a part of the festive observance. Some Vrats are for religious (dharma) or soteriological goals (moksha), some are for nonreligious reasons, some celebration of one's cultural tradition, and others are a form of quid pro quo sacrifice to get or give divine help to someone. Another reason for observing Vratas is the belief that they are a form of sorry, self-correction, penance and expiatory (prƒÅya≈õcitta). Vratas are discussed as a means to prƒÅya≈õcitta in Dharmasastra texts. Many prƒÅya≈õcitta vratas in these texts suggest it include the feeding of \\"Brahmins, blind, poor and helpless\\", as well as other acts of charity. However, a Vrata can consist of many different activities. Other examples of Vrata activity include fasting, burning incense sticks, prayers before a deity, meditating and such activities. The ≈õmrtis go into great detail on the subject of vratas, discussing even the details pertaining to what type of flowers should be used in worship. Men and women, state the Dharmashastras and the Puranas, can expiate their sins through the use of vratas. For prƒÅya≈õcitta, the Vratas are the second most discussed method in the Puranas, after the Tirtha. =Observances and practices= A Vrata is observed either as an independent private ritual at a date of one's choice, as part of a particular ceremony such as wedding, or as a part of a major festival such as Diwali (Lakshmi, festival of lights), Shivaratri (Shiva), Navratri (Durga or Rama), Ekadashi (Krishna, Vishnu avatars). A typical Vrata involves a fast for a fixed period of time, usually a full day, where either no food is eaten, or only one meal is eaten in the entire day, or only a certain food such as milk is consumed during the period of the Vrata. Other observances include sleeping on the ground or a short sleep, or alternatively yoga with meditation, reading scripture and charitable giving (dƒÅna). Some Vratas are more elaborate, such as those associated with major festivals or tirtha or rite of passage ceremonies, involving weeks of preparation, the drawing of Vrata mandala from various colored grain flour, wall decoration, cleaning of the house, special bath and festive dress, charity, a visit to a Hindu temple for a dar≈õana of the inner sanctum or puja within one's home. In Nepal, Hindus visit Pashupatinatha temple for example, families light lamps on Balacaturdasi on a winter night and then set them afloat in Bagamati river next morning, followed by strewing grains for birds. Kane lists hundreds of Vrata found in Hindu texts. =Types= The puranas denote various types of vratas, such as, *‚Äòkayika-vrata‚Äô. It is a vrata pertaining to the body. The stress is on physical austerity like fasting. *‚Äòvachika-vrata‚Äô or vrata pertaining to speech. Here much importance is given to speaking the truth and reciting the scriptures. *‚Äòmanasa-vrata‚Äô or vrata pertaining to the mind. The emphasis here is on controlling the mind, by controlling the passions and prejudices that arise in it. A vrata may also be classified by its time period, such as Vrata for a day is a dina-vrata, a paksha (week or fortnight) is a vaara-vrata or a paksha-vrata. = Nirjala- vrata (nirjal vrat) = It consists of complete fasting without drinking water. Hence, it is called Nirjala(Without water or waterless) vrata. Unlike normal(common) vratas in which consumption of fruits, juices, milk, water and sugar is allowed, the 'vrati' doesn't eat or drink anything at all (to purify their body). It is common in Hindu festivals such as Nirjala Ekadashi, and chhath.  Jainism  Five vrata-s (vows) are one of the codes of conduct for Jain householders. Any of the vows (vratas) that govern the activities of both monks and laymen. These are similar to the Yamas of yoga, and include the vow of ahimsa, satya, asteya, brahmacharya and aparigraha. Jainism also has seven supplementary vows, called the Shila-vratas, which suggest additional virtues. Fasting is part of vrata observances in Jainism, and some involve congregational fasting at temples. Vrata among Jaina women may involve complete or partial fasting on certain specific days; a pilgrimage or tirtha to a particular place or places, as well as virtuous actions to others. Vrata is viewed as a form of austerity, with the power to remove karma from jiva (soul) and gain punya (merit). Laypersons aren't expected to observe these vows strictly. Once a layperson has gone through the preliminary stages of spiritual discipline (gunasthana), that person may promise to observe 12 vows for a stated period of time and may renew the pledge at the completion of that time.

There were four generally very similar submachine guns in this series: the Sa 23, Sa 24, Sa 25, and Sa 26. The primary designer was Jaroslav Holeƒçek (1923-1977), chief engineer of the ƒåesk√° zbrojovka Uhersk√Ω Brod arms factory. Design The Sa 23 series utilize a straightforward blowback action, with no locked breech, and fire from the open bolt position. They also use a progressive trigger for selecting between semi-automatic fire and fully automatic fire. Lightly pulling on the trigger will fire a single shot. Pulling the trigger farther to the rear in a continuous motion will fire fully automatically, until the trigger is released or the magazine is empty. The Sa 23 series were submachine guns with a telescoping bolt, in which the forward part of the moving bolt extends forwards past the back end of the barrel, wrapping around that barrel. This feature reduces the required length of the submachine gun significantly and allows for better balance and handling. Handling was further improved by using a single vertical handgrip housing the magazine and trigger mechanism, roughly centered along the gun's length. The gun's receiver was machined from a single circular steel tube. The design of the Sa 23 series submachine guns is most notable in the West for having inspired the open-bolt, blowback-operated, telescoping bolt design of the slightly later Uzi submachine gun.Hogg 1979:157 Variations *The Sa 23 (vz. 48a) was the first variant, using a fixed wood stock and firing standard 9√ó19mm Parabellum ammunition. Has a straight vertical pistol grip and ammunition magazine. Magazines were issued with 24 and 40 round capacity. *The Sa 25 (vz. 48b) was the second and perhaps best known variant, using a folding metal stock, still firing 9√ó19mm Parabellum ammunition. Other than the folding stock, is identical to the Sa 23 and uses the same 24 and 40 round magazines. The Sa 24 and Sa 26 were introduced after Czechoslovakia joined the Warsaw Pact, and were redesigned to fire 7.62√ó25mm Tokarev standard Soviet type pistol ammunition. *The Sa 24 (vz. 48a/52) corresponds to the Sa.23, using a fixed wood stock and firing 7.62√ó25mm Tokarev ammunition. Can be visually distinguished from Sa.23 as it has a slightly forwards-slanted pistol grip and ammunition magazine, though the main receiver and other components are otherwise visibly identical. It was issued with 32-round magazines. *The Sa 26 (vz. 48b/52) corresponds to the Sa.25, with a folding metal stock but otherwise identical to the Sa.24, using the same 32-round magazines. Usage The Sa 23 and 25 models were used by Cuba during the 1960s and 70s, and some can be seen in photos of the Bay of Pigs invasion. After the Sa 25 was declared obsolete in 1968, many of the 9mm weapons were sold around the world. The surplus weapons were exported to other communist countries including North Vietnam. A somewhat-modified copy of the 9√ó19mm Parabellum model was produced in Rhodesia in the early 1970s as the LDP and given the nickname \\"Rhogun\\". Manufacture was later transferred to South Africa where it was briefly marketed as the Sanna 77 in semi-automatic fire only.

It is a bowed string instrument with between 9 and 16 gut strings and a fretted neck. When played, it is held between the legs in the manner of a cello or viol (viola da gamba). It was used in italian operas and oratoriums to accompany the human voice, specially the gods. Because the lira da gambe can not play the bass, there must be a bass instrument, theorbo, harpsichord or viola da gamba. The sources describe, that the instrument was used for the special sound, although it is an imperfect instrument. Important is, to pay attention to the minor or major terz. Description The Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians describes the lirone as essentially a larger version of the lira da braccio, which has a similar wide fingerboard, flat bridge, and leaf-shaped pegbox with frontal pegs.Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, ed. L. Macy (accessed 11 November 2006) Its flat bridge allows for the playing of chords of between three and five notes. History The lirone was primarily used in Italy during the late 16th and early 17th centuries (and particularly in the time of Claudio Monteverdi) to provide continuo, or harmony for the accompaniment of vocal music. It was frequently used in Catholic churches, particularly by Jesuits. Performers Despite the resurgence in Baroque instrument performance during the 20th century, only a handful of musicians play the lirone. Notable performers on the instrument include Erin Headley of England, Imke David (Weimar), Claas Harders and Hille Perl of Germany, Annalisa Pappano of the United States, Laura Vaughan of Australia, and Paulina van Laarhoven of the Netherlands.

He currently works as the manager of River Ecuador in Ecuador. Playing career An attacking midfielder, Trobbiani was one of the promising young stars to rise in Boca Juniors during the early 1970s. As a juvenile, he debuted in 1973 with the national team when Omar Sivori drafted him for the \\"phantom squad\\" that had to play Bolivia for a ticket to the 1974 World Cup. Following the exit of Reinaldo Merlo, he wore the national colours, before Boca's then coach Rogelio Dom√≠nguez was aware of his existence. In 1975, Trobbiani shared Boca's midfield with Ben√≠tez, Su√±√© and Potente, and was criticized for hogging the ball, to the point that fans called him calesita (merry-go-round). After the 1976 season, Trobbiani was sold to Spain in 1976. Boca used the money to buy many players in the local market, starting a major winning streak with coach Juan Carlos Lorenzo. Trobbiani played for Spanish sides Elche and Real Zaragoza, and acquired European discipline and tactical depth. When he returned to play for Boca in 1981 alongside Diego Maradona, fans saw a more effective player. The team won the 1981 Metropolitano. In mid-1982, Trobbiani was transferred to Estudiantes de La Plata. Coach Carlos Bilardo made Trobbiani play as a deep-lying centre-forward linking the strong midfield (Russo, Ponce and Sabella) to strikers Trama and Gottardi. The team won two back-to-back championships. Before the 1986 World Cup in Mexico, Trobbiani was playing for Elche CF. National coach Bilardo called Trobbiani for the tournament, making it clear that he would mainly be used for tactical practice games. He worked tirelessly during the month-long stay in Mexico, where he was Jorge Valdano's roommate, and was rewarded with exactly two minutes of play‚Äîthe last two minutes of the final match against Germany. His only touch of the ball was a back-heel pass. Before retirement, Trobbiani showed his class at Chilean side Cobreloa, Ecuadorian side Barcelona SC (with whom he reached the Copa Libertadores finals in 1990) and back in Argentina with Talleres de C√≥rdoba Managerial career Trobbiani in 2016 Trobbiani went on to coach several teams in South America, with little success. He was sacked from Universitario de Deportes from Peru at the end of 2004. Between 2006 and 2008, he worked as Russo's assistant coach at Boca Juniors, together with former teammate Gottardi. Between 2008 and 2009 he returned to Chilean football to work as the manager of Cobreloa, where he played in the late 1980s. In 2009, he was appointed as the manager of Peruvian side Cienciano. On March 20, 2011 he was involved in a bitter dispute with fellow Argentine manager Guillermo Rivarola of Sporting Cristal after the ex-River player complained to the referee in order to get Trobbiani sent off.Marcelo Trobbiani vs Guillermo Rivarola, manager dispute On September 18, 2013, as coach of Sport Huancayo, he was accused of racism and discrimination by three Brazilian players, Rafael Da Silva, Andrey Nunes y Kleyr Vieira who play in the team.

Built by Cammell Laird and launched on 25 February 1967, she was decommissioned in 1996. Construction Renown, like the other Resolution- class submarines, was ordered on 8 May 1963 and was laid down at Cammell Laird's Birkenhead shipyard on 25 June 1964. Construction was slower than planned, with poor performance by Cammell Laird and its workforce resulting in both Renown and sister ship being delayed. In 1966, it was discovered that due to lax interpretation of drawings, Renowns torpedo storage compartment differed in length by from the lead ship , and in November that year, broken bits of metal were found in the submarine's primary cooling circuits, the removal of which delayed construction by two months. Renown was launched on 25 February 1967 by Edna Healey, wife of Denis Healey, the Secretary of State for Defence. By October 1967, Revenge was six months behind programme, and the Ministry of Defence considered towing the unfinished Renown and Revenge to Barrow-in-Furness for completion by Vickers-Armstrongs. She was formally commissioned on 15 November 1968. Design Renown was long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draught of . Service Renown struck the entrance to a dock when leaving Lairds for sea trials in February 1969, and collided with a merchant ship, MV Moyle in the Irish Sea on 13 October 1969, which resulted in Renowns commanding officer being found guilty of hazarding his submarine at the resulting court-martial and relieved of command. Renown finally became operational in November 1969. In 1974 Renown suffered structural damage when she struck the bottom of the sea during sea trials off Scotland. Renown carried out test firings of Chevaline, which was a modification of the Polaris missiles to enable them to penetrate Soviet anti- ballistic missile defences, in early 1982, and was fully operational with Chevaline late that year. In the 1990s the ageing Resolution-class was becoming difficult for the Royal Navy to operate, suffering from an increased number of defects, and Renown was forced to remain alongside at Faslane due to defects in 1995 before being decommissioned on 24 February 1996.

It is not actually a :squirrel, nor a :mouse, though it is a rodent. Not much is known about them because they are very hard to keep alive in captivity. To achieve gliding flight, it uses two membranes (patagia) which fold up when not in use. When the limbs are stretched wide in a star-shape, the membranes become taut and allow the rodent to glide from tree to tree. Being arboreal, Idiurus spends all of its time in the trees, living in hollow trunks in groups of 2 to 40. Limit information suggests that it is mainly frugivorous. It has a long tail in proportion to its body, sporting two lines of raised scales, and patches of scaly skin to help it grip trees, but the rest of its body is furry. The tail is longer than the body and is also used to balance, like a primate's tail. Long-eared scaly-tailed flying squirrels are about 20 cm long and weigh 30g.

She was deputy minister in the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) from 1996 until 1999, during which time she also was a founding member of the Guguletu Community Development Corporation. From 1997 she served as member of the national executive committee of the African National Congress (ANC), as well as being the provincial vice-chairperson of the ANC Western Cape. Mlambo- Ngcuka was Minister of Minerals and Energy from June 1999 to June 2005. During this time she was a driving force behind the government's policy of creating New Order Mining Rights which ended a period where big mining firms which controlled nearly all South Africa's minerals reserves, were able to hold mining rights to them in perpetuity. Mlambo-Ngucka's policy of 'use it or lose it' created a situation where mining rights became available to a much broader segment of the population including many previously disadvantaged black people. She served as acting Minister of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology from February 2004 to April 2004.

On 22 June 2005, President Thabo Mbeki appointed her as deputy president of South Africa, after he relieved Jacob Zuma of the post the week before. Mlambo-Ngcuka's husband, Bulelani Ngcuka, was head of South Africa's National Directorate of Public Prosecutions at the time and charged with fighting organised crime. It was the NDPP which had determined that criminal charges should be brought against Zuma. It is Zuma's position that the charges against him are politically motivated. Soon after her appointment she was booed by Zuma supporters at a rally in KwaZulu-Natal, an incident that was not covered by the public broadcaster, the SABC, which led to accusations of bias. In August 2005, commenting on the slow pace of the Willing Buyer Willing Seller land reform program in South Africa, she stated that South Africa could learn about land reform from Zimbabwe. This comment caused alarm and was condemned by the parliamentary opposition.

Controversies During Mlambo-Ngcuka's tenure as Minister of Minerals and Energy the parastatal company PetroSA made an advance payment of ZAR15 million (approx. $1.5 million) to a private company Imvume, which in turn made a ZAR11 million donation to the ANC ahead of the 2004 elections. It is alleged that Imvume has close links to the ANC. These events have been dubbed the \\"Oilgate\\" scandal by South African media. Although there was never any evidence that Mlambo-Ngcuka was involved in any way media reports cast suspicion her way. In order to clear her name Mlambo-Ngcuka asked South Africa's Public Protector to investigate the issue. The subsequent report cleared her completely. Because Mlambo-Ngcuka's brother Bonga Mlambo was involved with Imvume on a planned hotel project at the time, he was at first alleged to have been involved in Imvume's oil business. These allegations also proved to be groundless. Mlambo- Ngcuka faced another controversy during the South African political scandals in January 2006 when it emerged that she went with her family and a friend Thuthukile Mazibuko-Skweyiya in December 2005, on a taxpayer-funded holiday at the cost of ZAR4 million to the United Arab Emirates. This was dubbed the Gravy Plane scandal by the South African media, and came at a sensitive time, as the ANC was preparing to fight local government elections. Once again Mlambo-Ngcuka asked the Public Protector to investigate and once again she was cleared of any wrongdoing. The public protector found that the South African security services had decided that because of security reasons a government plane be used for the journey and that Mlambo-Ngcuka had no role in influencing this decision. Personal life Mlambo-Ngcuka is married to the former head of the National Prosecuting Authority, Bulelani Ngcuka. They have five children, four of whom were adopted.

Al-Zahir assumed the caliphate after the disappearance of his father al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah. According to the Hijri Calendar, his birth date is 3rd of Ramzaan 395 A.H. Reign At the time of al-Hakim's disappearance on 14 February 1021, his sister, Sitt al-Mulk, took the reins of power. She disregarded the previous appointment of a cousin, Abu'l-Qasim Abd al-Rahim, as heir apparent by al-Hakim, and instead raised al- Hakim's 16-year-old son Ali to the throne. Ali received the public oath of allegiance on 28 March, with the regnal name al-ZƒÅhir li-i øzƒÅz Dƒ´n AllƒÅh. His rival, Abu'l-Qasim, was recalled from Damascus, where he was serving as governor, to Cairo, where he died‚Äîreportedly by suicide‚Äîa few months later. Until her death in February 1023, the government was conducted by Sitt al- Mulk, who according to historian Thierry Bianquis proved \\"a true stateswoman\\". Al-Zahir himself never displayed much interest in wielding power, instead spending his days in idle pleasure drinking wine and enjoying the black slaves of his harem. He was the first Fatimid monarch to actively shift the responsibility of governing onto his officials, inaugurating a trend that would eventually lead to the complete political impotence of the Fatimid caliphs. Under this regime, the FƒÅtimid state slipped into crisis - in Egypt, famine and plague led to anarchy in the years 1023-1025, and in Palestine and Syria, there was a revolt amongst the Bedouin (1024‚Äì1029). The coalition of rebels was fragmented by FƒÅtimid diplomacy, after which General Anushtakin al- Dizbari was able to defeat it militarily. Meanwhile, in 1028 one of the governing circle,  ªAlƒ´ ibn Ahmad Jarjarai, was able to eliminate his colleagues and take over the office of vizir, which he managed to retain until 1045. He enjoyed good relations with the Byzantine Empire, even though the suzerainty over Aleppo was constantly disputed, occasionally coming to arms. To improve relations with Byzantium and the Christian subjects of the realm, the rebuilding of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, destroyed in 1009, was authorised under his caliphate in a treaty with the Byzantine Emperor Romanus III. Actual building work, funded by the Byzantines, was not undertaken until 1042. Death and succession The period of his Imamate was sixteen years. After  ªAlƒ´ died of the plague 13 June 1036, his son became the eighth caliph under the throne name of al-Mustansir.

He joined the Greeks in the expedition against Troy. Pausanias in his Description of Greece (2.20.3) says that in Corinth there is a Temple of Fortune to which Palamedes dedicated the dice that he had invented. Plato in The Republic (Book 7) (through the mouthpiece of Socrates) remarks that Palamedes claimed to have invented numbers. Expedition against Troy After Paris took Helen to Troy, Agamemnon sent Palamedes to Ithaca to retrieve Odysseus, who had promised to defend the marriage of Helen and Menelaus. Odysseus did not want to honor his oath, so he plowed his fields with an ass and an ox both hitched to the same plow, so the beasts of different sizes caused the plow to pull chaotically. Palamedes guessed what was happening and put Odysseus' son, Telemachus, in front of the plow. Odysseus stopped working and revealed his sanity.Apollodorus, Epitome, Apollod. Epit. E.3.7 =Death= The ancient sources show differences in regards to the details of how Palamedes met his death. Odysseus never forgave Palamedes for ruining his attempt to stay out of the Trojan War. When Palamedes advised the Greeks to return home, Odysseus hid gold in his tent and wrote a fake letter purportedly from Priam. The letter was found and the Greeks accused him of being a traitor.Hyginus, Fabulae, 105 Palamedes was stoned to death by Odysseus and Diomedes. According to other accounts the two warriors drowned him during a fishing expedition.Pausanias 10.31.2, citing the epic Cypria. Still another version relates that he was lured into a well in search of treasure, and then was crushed by stones. Although he is a major character in some accounts of the Trojan War, Palamedes is not mentioned in Homer's Iliad. Ovid discusses Palamedes' role in the Trojan War in the Metamorphoses. Palamedes' fate is described in Virgil's Aeneid. In the Apology, Plato describes Socrates as looking forward to speaking with Palamedes after death, Plato. Apology, 41b. and intimates in the Phaedrus that Palamedes authored a work on rhetoric.Phaedrus, 261b Euripides and many other dramatists have written dramas about his fate. Greek alphabet Hyginus revives an old account that Palamedes created eleven letters of the Greek alphabet: In modern culture In one modern account, The Luck of Troy by Roger Lancelyn Green, Palamedes was double-dealing with the Trojans. Defense of Palamedes Defense of Palamedes is a text by Gorgias, describing the defense speech that Palamedes gave when charged with treason. Vondel play The major Dutch playwright Joost van den Vondel wrote in 1625 the play \\"Palamedes\\", based on the above Greek myth. The play had a clear topical political connotation, the unjust killing of Palamedes standing for the execution of the statesman Johan van Oldenbarnevelt six years earlier - which Vondel, like others in the Dutch Republic, considered a judicial murder. In Vondel's version, responsibility for the killing of Palamedes is attributed to mainly to Agamemnon; the play's harsh and tyrannical Agamemnon was clearly intended to portray Prince Maurits of Nassau. Authorities in Amsterdam found no difficulty in deciphering the political meanings behind Vondel's Classical allusions, and imposed a heavy fine on the playwright. References  Sources  * D. R.

He is a Saracen pagan who converts to Christianity later in his life, and his unrequited love for Iseult brings him into frequent conflict with Tristan. Palamedes' father is King Esclabor. His brothers, Safir and Segwarides, also join the Round Table. The romance Palamedes was named after him. In medieval stories Le Morte d'Arthur illustration by Aubrey Beardsley: \\"How King Marke and Sir Dinadan heard Sir Palomides making great sarrow and mourning for La Beale Isoud.\\" Palamedes first appears in the Prose Tristan, an early 13th-century prose expansion of the Tristan and Iseult legend. He is introduced as a knight fighting for Princess Iseult's hand at a tournament in Ireland; he ultimately loses to the protagonist Tristan, to the delight of the princess. Tristan spares him but forbids him to bear arms for a year or to pursue Iseult's love ever again. After Iseult's wedding to King Mark, Palamedes rescues Iseult's servant Brangaine, joins the Round Table and engages in a number of duels with Tristan that are usually postponed or end without a clear winner. They eventually reconcile, but share a love‚Äìhate relationship through the rest of the narrative. Palamedes also appears in the Post-Vulgate Cycle, Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur, and even gave his name to his own prose romance, the early 13th-century Palamedes that now exists only in fragments, detailing the adventures of two generations of Arthurian heroes. Some stories reveal Palamedes' background: his father Esclabor was an exiled king of Babylon who traveled to Britain, where he rescued and befriended King Pellinore. Many tales also have Palamedes as the hunter of the Questing Beast, an abomination only the chosen can kill. The hunt is as frustrating and fruitless as the pursuit of Iseult, and in most versions remains uncompleted. However, in the Post-Vulgate Palamedes' conversion to Christianity during the Grail Quest allows him release from his worldly entanglements, and Percival and Galahad help him trap the beast in a lake, where he finally slays it. Malory has Palamedes and his brother Safir joining Lancelot after the great knight's affair with Queen Guinevere is exposed. The brothers eventually accompany Lancelot to France, where Palamedes is made Duke of Provence. He is eventually killed by Gawain. In modern culture *In The Once and Future King by T. H. White, Palamedes (as Sir Palomides) appears in Part Two, The Queen of Air and Darkness, as a questing partner of King Pellinore. (In the original version, The Witch in the Wood, Sir Palomides was tutor to the sons of King Lot.) Sir Palomides attempts to aid Pellinore in his pursuit of the Questing Beast and then assumes the quest himself. Like White's Pellinore, Sir Palomides is a broad comic character. His death at the hands of Gawain receives mention in Part Four, The Candle in the Wind. *Palamedes is a character in the book series The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel by Michael Scott. *The story is also immortalised by Aleister Crowley in The High History of the Good Sir Palamedes (published in The Equinox, volume 1, number 4, special supplement). *Marcel Proust gave the name to a character in his In Search of Lost Time, Palam√®de baron de Charlus. *In The Black Knight (film) (1954), Sir Palamedes is played by Peter Cushing as a traitorous spy in the court of King Arthur.

It has interred approximately 5,000 individual since it officially opened its site in 1987. It serves as a national cemetery in Federal Region IV, to serve veterans residing in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Tennessee, and Mississippi. History The Georgia Militia originally constructed Fort Mitchell in order to sustain a military presence in the area during the Creek War of 1813 to 1814. Shortly after the fort's completion, the Georgia Militia launched an attack against the British at Tuckabatchie and Hothlewali. The militia was ambushed and driven back to Fort Mitchell by a combined force of Creeks and British. Thereafter, until 1825, a small force continued to garrison at the fort. From 1817 to 1825, Fort Mitchell gradually emerged as a center of commerce for trade with Native Americans. In 1817, a trading house, or factory, was established where produced goods were available to local tribes at prices below what they could otherwise afford. In 1818, a post office was added to the newly extended Federal Road that crossed through Fort Mitchell from Augusta, Georgia, and westward into the Alabama Territory. In 1821, an Indian agency was created at Fort Mitchell, and Colonel John Crowell was appointed agent to the Creeks. While Crowell managed the agency, his brother, Thomas, ran the tavern, which later served as an officer's quarters. Fort Mitchell became central to the protection of Native Americans as settlers consistently violated the Creek territory as defined under terms of the 1814 Treaty of Fort Jackson. In response to Native American protests, a new fort was constructed and occupied by the 4th U.S. Infantry in summer 1825, and it remained garrisoned almost continually through 1840. The second fort encompassed the first, and while much larger, was similar in design. The use of force against white trespassers was effective. In 1831, a group of white settlers invaded the Indian community of Ola Ufalal (now Eufaula), evicted the Creeks, burned their houses, and built their own settlement. The U.S. marshal protested the settlers' actions, and when defied, the commandant at Fort Mitchell dispatched a company to demand the surrender and evacuation of the town. The residents complied and retreated across the Chattahoochee River. President Andrew Jackson was committed to a policy of removing Native Americans, however, and was not eager to use force against settlers who were supported by the laws of Georgia and Alabama. For every ejection of a trespasser evacuated by troops at Fort Mitchell, 10 intruders would cross the river and enter Creek territory. The hopelessness of the military's position was reflected in the celebrated Hardeman Owen killing. Owen had planned but failed to murder the U.S. marshal. Troops at Fort Mitchell were called out to capture Owen, and in the ensuing melee he was killed. Georgia authorities charged the trooper who fired the fatal shot with murder and demanded the Army hand him over. The commandant refused. Tensions ran high and almost erupted into open warfare. In an attempt to settle the dispute, Francis Scott Key was dispatched by the administration to investigate the affair. He took up residence at Fort Mitchell and composed a report on the condition of the Creeks and the cause of the recent turmoil. He charged that the evils perpetrated on the Native Americans were caused by the weakness of the U.S. government in facing the aggressive actions of the settlers. Key went on to negotiate a settlement, which, after he returned to Washington, was rarely honored. Creek desperation reached a crisis point in spring 1836. Under the leadership of Chief Eneah-Mathla, an estimated 1,500 warriors attacked the settlements. General Winfield Scott was ordered to intervene and succeeded in overcoming the attack. By July 1836, an estimated 1,600 Creek people were concentrated at Fort Mitchell in preparation for a forced expulsion West. Approximately 2,000 to 3,000 were eventually marched from Fort Mitchell to Montgomery, \\"shedding tears and making the most bitter wailings.\\" This route is known as the Trail of Tears. In late 1980s, the old post cemetery at Fort Mitchell was officially identified as the location for a national cemetery in Federal Region IV and was opened in May 1987.

Name The name of the settlement is derived from the Slovenian word lipa 'linden tree'.Snoj, Marko. 2009. Etimolo≈°ki slovar slovenskih zemljepisnih imen. Ljubljana: Modrijan and Zalo≈æba ZRC, pp. 234‚Äì235. The species is common in the area and is a national symbol of Slovenia. The staff at the Lipica Stud Farm plant a new linden tree for every foal born. History From the 14th century until 1947, Lipica was part of the municipality of Trieste.Savnik, Roman, ed. 1968. Krajevni leksikon Slovenije, vol. 1. Ljubljana: Dr≈æavna zalo≈æba Slovenije, pp. 319‚Äì320. When Charles II, Archduke of Inner Austria (son of Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor) decided to establish a new stud farm in the 16th century, the Spanish horse was considered the ideal horse breed. Because the soil and climate in the Karst region is similar to that of Spain, Lipica was chosen as the perfect spot for the new farm. The Lipica stud farm was established in 1580 and the first horses were bought from Spain in 1581 (24 broodmares and six stallions). The farmers living in the area at the time were evicted and resettled in La≈æe. A coal mine operated east of the settlement from 1778 to 1817. Coal mining was attempted at the site again in 1857 and at sporadic later dates, but was deemed uneconomical because it is deposited only in lenses. Coal from the mine was once used at the sugar refinery in Rijeka. In 1947, Lipica was annexed to Yugoslavia and incorporated into Slovenia, one of the country's constituent republics, which became independent in 1991. =Mass grave= Lipica is the site of a mass grave associated with the Second World War. The Lipica Shaft Mass Grave () is located about southwest of the tree- lined boulevard by the stud farm. It contains an undetermined number of human remains.De≈æman, Jo≈æe. 2008.

Lipica Stud Farm Lipica Stud Farm Lipica is the origin of the Lipizzan horse. The Lipizzan breed as known today was fully developed in the time of Maria Theresa of Austria, whose husband was greatly interested in horse-breeding. During the Napoleonic wars, the stud farm was relocated to Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r. In 1802, an earthquake struck Lipica, killing large numbers of horses. The stud farm was relocated to ƒêakovo in 1805, to Pecica (near Mez≈ëhegyes) in 1809, to Laxenburg during the First World War, and then to Kladruby nad Labem. After the First World War, when Lipica was awarded to Italy, most of the horses were returned to Lipica. On 16 October 1943, the stud farm and 178 horses were relocated to Hostou≈à. After the Second World War, the farm had only 11 horses; all of the others had been confiscated by the Germans during the war. In the 1960s, Lipica was opened to tourists and new development began. In 1996, Lipica became a public institution that is owned by the Republic of Slovenia and has made significant progress since then. Queen Elizabeth II visited Lipica and its stud farm on 22 October 2008 and was presented with a Lipizzan horse as a gift from the Slovenian people.BBC News 22 October 2008 The queen's horse remains at the Lipica Stud Farm because it was requested that the farm care for it on her behalf. Today the Lipica Stud Farm is fully functional and breeds the finest horses for haute-√©cole riding. The stud farm now also includes a hotel and leisure complex with a golf course, as well as the Lipikum Museum dedicated to various aspects of the stud and the Lipizzan breed, including guided tours of the stud farm.Lipica Stud Farm site The Lipica Open The Lipica Open is an international orienteering competition that is held every year on the second weekend of March.

Common characteristics  Ford Focus body styles: sedan, station wagon and hatchback Without any equipment, upholstery and exterior trim is usually determined by the trim level, the car model often defines the platform (which determines the engines, drivetrains and chassis options available), body styles and aesthetic theme. Some models have only one body style (e.g. the Mazda 2 hatchback), while other models are produced in several body styles (e.g. the Audi A3, which has been produced in hatchback, sedan and convertible body styles). In some cases, a manufacturer has marketed a body style as a separate model ‚Äî for example the Volkswagen Jetta and the BMW 4 Series, which are based on the Volkswagen Golf and BMW 3 Series platforms respectively. Some models have an only engine (or electric/hybrid powertrain) option available, while other models have multiple powertrains available. In the North America, a model can also be called a \\"nameplate\\". The Chevrolet Suburban is the oldest automobile nameplate in continuous production, dating to 1934, and the 1940-1996 Chrysler New Yorker was another long-running North American car nameplate. However, the term \\"nameplate\\" is also sometimes used to describe an entire brand, rather than a specific model. = Country- specific model names = The same car model may be sold by the automaker in different countries under different model names. Examples include Mitsubishi Pajero / Montero, Mazda MX-5 / Miata, Volkswagen Golf / Rabbit and Ford Everest / Endeavour. Model years The model year (MY) is a manner of indicating the version of a car that has been produced and changed over multiple years. Trim level Beyond the standard equipment that is fitted to all vehicles in for a model, additional features (such as the upholstery, interior equipment, safety features and exterior aerodynamic/styling upgrades) are often determined by the trim level of the vehicle. Many manufacturers also allow additional equipment to be added to a vehicle by purchasing individual options (such as alloy wheels) or 'packages' of bundled options (such as a \\"safety package\\" consisting of lane departure warning system, collision avoidance system and additional airbags).

The rulers of Bawlake, Kantarawadi and Kyebogyi standing in the back row. Territories claimed by Thailand in the Shan and Karenni States during World War II and Saharat Thai Doem northern province. The Karenni States, also known as Red Karen States, was the name formerly given to the states inhabited mainly by the Red Karen, in the area of present-day Kayah State, eastern Burma. They were located south of the Federated Shan States and east of British Burma. The British government recognised and guaranteed the independence of the Karenni States in an 1875 treaty with Burmese King Mindon Min, by which both parties recognised the area as belonging neither to Burma nor to Great Britain. Consequently, the Karenni States were never fully incorporated into British Burma. The Karenni states formed for a time the \\"Kayah State\\" in post-independent Burma,Map of Shan States c.1910 but on 29 April 1959 both the Shan and the Kayah rulers formally surrendered their ruling powers to the Burmese government.Shan and Karenni States of Burma History There are no historical data on the Karenni States before the 19th century. According to local tradition in the early times of the Karenni states there was a principality led by a \\"Sawphya\\" that was under the over lordship of a Shan prince. This state finally became independent in the 18th century. In the 19th century the Karenni state was divided into five principalities (sawphyas). =British rule in Burma= In 1864 a Karenni prince requested the status of British protectorate for his state, but the British authorities did not show any interest. After the death of this prince in 1869 his two sons renewed the petition claiming that they feared Burmese ambitions on their state. The British refused again, but agreed to arbitrate before the King of Burma. Since the Burmese monarchy insisted in their demands on the Karenni territories, the British granted recognition to four states, Kyebogyi, Namekan (Nammekon), Naungpale and Bawlake, which became independent under British protection on 21 June 1875. Kantarawadi state, however, remained independent without official protection.Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 15, p. 36. The Karenni States were recognized as tributary to British Burma in 1892, when their rulers agreed to accept a stipend from the British government. An Assistant Superintendent of the Shan States was based at Loikaw as Agent of the British government. He was exercising control over the local Karenni Rulers, being supervised by the Superintendent at Taunggyi. On 10 October 1922 the administrations of the Karenni states and the Shan states were officially unified to establish the Federated Shan States, under a commissioner who also administered the Wa States. This arrangement survived the constitutional changes of 1923 and 1937. By the 1930s, the Mawchi Mine in Bawlake was one of the most important sources of tungsten in the world. On 27 May 1942, during World War II, nearby Kengtung State was invaded and its capital captured by the Thai Phayap Army. Following a previous agreement between Thai Prime Minister Plaek Phibunsongkhram and the Japanese Empire, in December the same year the Thai administration occupied Kengtung and parts of M√∂ngpan. The annexation by Thailand as Saharat Thai Doem northern province was formalized on 1 August 1943. Thailand left the territories in 1945, but officially relinquished its claim over the trans-Salween part of Kantarawadi State only in 1946 as part of the condition for admission to the United Nations and the withdrawal of all wartime sanctions for having sided with the Axis powers.David Porter Chandler & David Joel Steinberg eds. In Search of Southeast Asia: A Modern History. p. 388 =Post-independence Burma= The Constitution of the Union of Burma in 1947 proclaimed that the three Karenni States be amalgamated into a single constituent state of the union, called Karenni State. It also provided for the possibility of secession from the Union after 10 years. In 1952, the former Shan state of Mong Pai was added, and the whole renamed Kayah State, possibly with the intent of driving a wedge between the Karenni in Kayah State and the rest of the Karen people in Karen State, both fighting for independence. Under the Burmese government control, the states subjected to changes throughout the small state. Resources like the hydropower and mining led to massive military presence around the state; thus, leading many of its people without a home and more problems to arise. The heavy military presence had created issues that people of the state faces as consequences. Mistreatments of the local people include land taken away by the military, human rights violations like forced labor and sexual violence and overall safety of the people resulting from landmine planted around the state. States There were five Karenni states, divided into two regions. =Western Karenni= The Western Karenni States were the four Karenni states located west of the Salween River: * Kyebogyi, , population 9,867 in 1901. * Bawlake, , population 5,701 in 1901. * Naungpale, , population 1,265 in 1901. * Nammekon, , population 2,629 in 1901. =Kantarawadi= Kantarawadi State was also known as \\"Eastern Karenni\\". It had an area of and a population of 26,333 in 1901. More than half of its territory was located east of the Salween River, an area that was annexed by Thailand during World War II.

History Gaskill has been interested in making music and playing drums for as long as he can remember. His father bought him his first drum, a snare, at the age of 4. From there, he pieced together a full kit. He grew up in a very musical family with both his dad and brother being guitar players. The three actually started an all-instrumental band called Jerry and the Knights. Gaskill played his first bar gig when he was seven years old with this group and was paid $2 for his efforts. Jerry and the Knights played at different functions such as talent shows, wedding receptions, parties and so on until his mid-teens. He then joined a local band called Frog Ocean Road who he had admired. Gaskill played with them until he was 18, at which time he had a self professed \\"Born Again\\" experience. He then became involved in the local Christian music scene playing at churches and jamming with other like-minded musicians. In 1978, Gaskill decided to attend Evangel College in Springfield, Missouri and moved there with the intention of becoming a Biblical Studies major. He never lost the musical bug and was quick to involve himself in the local music circles. He was soon introduced to singer Greg X. Volz who was putting a new band together and asked Gaskill to participate. They also asked bassist Doug Pinnick to move to Springfield and join the band. Pinnick accepted, but a month after his arrival, the project fell apart. Gaskill was soon asked, along with Pinnick, to join the Phil Keaggy band (presumably through Keaggy's previous work with Volz) which they accepted. He went on a national tour with Keaggy for about a year. During the band's show in Springfield, Gaskill was asked by a member of the opening band if he would lend them his drums. That person happened to be Ty Tabor who was filling in for the drummer who had quit the band the night before. At one point, Gaskill became involved in a demo project for the Tracy Zinn Band that had Tabor as a member. The two hit it off and were later involved in other projects together. After the Keaggy job, Gaskill and Pinnick (who had also been jamming with Tabor) decided to try getting their own band together. The group was rounded out by Tabor and guitarist Dan McCollam. They called themselves The Edge, then three years later Sneak Preview, which eventually morphed into King's X several years later. Gaskill has enjoyed a long and storied career with King's X and continues with them to this day. The album Gretchen Goes to Nebraska was based in part on a story that he wrote. He has appeared as lead vocalist on 3 King's X tracks and is an integral part of their famous 3-part vocal harmonies. Gaskill suffered a heart attack on February 25, 2012, and was rushed to a hospital where he underwent emergency surgery. After his release from hospital he posted a video message on Facebook, thanking everyone who had supported him through his illness and then married his long term partner, Julie, in Las Vegas. In October of the same year, Gaskill's Sea Bright, New Jersey home was completely destroyed by Superstorm Sandy.Condrand, Ed. \\"King‚Äôs X drummer Jerry Gaskill talks road back to Asbury Park\\", Asbury Park Press, November 18, 2016.

King's X canceled all future shows until further notice. Projects In addition to King's X, Gaskill has performed on the albums Let It Go by Galactic Cowboys, Red Line by the Texas blues guitarist Jay Hooks, Ty Tabor's solo album Safety, Black Sugar Transmission's 2007 debut album (helmed by Andee Blacksugar, who also played guitar in Gaskill's solo band in 2005) and Doug Pinnick's Poundhound albums and Supershine project. Gaskill released a solo album, Come Somewhere, in April 2004. He sang all lead vocals as well as performed all drum, acoustic guitar, and some electric guitar tracks. It was produced by and featured his King's X cohort Ty Tabor, and was recorded at Tabor's Alien Beans Studios.
